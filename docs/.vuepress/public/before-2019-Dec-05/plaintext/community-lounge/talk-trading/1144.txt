[17-Sep-19 07:24 PM] Tek#5253
so yeah I would pick dash

[17-Sep-19 07:25 PM] Tek#5253
I mean BCH is probably secure too but dash is more secure because of the above facts

[17-Sep-19 07:25 PM] Tek#5253
or you could notorise to ETH, but its competition

[17-Sep-19 07:26 PM] Tek#5253
I think?

[17-Sep-19 07:26 PM] Neko#5830
I think btc needs to raise the blocksize

[17-Sep-19 07:26 PM] Neko#5830
but kmd should have an alternative

[17-Sep-19 07:27 PM] Neko#5830
any  coin

[17-Sep-19 07:27 PM] Tek#5253
btc is going to lower it

[17-Sep-19 07:27 PM] Tek#5253
they want to lower it

[17-Sep-19 07:27 PM] Tek#5253
and work on high fee base model

[17-Sep-19 07:27 PM] Tek#5253
and second layer

Is what he's proposing

[17-Sep-19 07:27 PM] Tek#5253
this man also believes the earth is flat.

[17-Sep-19 07:27 PM] Tek#5253
just so you know

[17-Sep-19 07:28 PM] Tek#5253
and he is a core lead dev

[17-Sep-19 07:28 PM] Tek#5253
all the good devs have left for different projects

[17-Sep-19 07:28 PM] Neko#5830
what a nutjob

[17-Sep-19 07:28 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[17-Sep-19 07:29 PM] phm87#7395
@Tek  about using segwit tx to notarize, I had several conversations with jl777 about it. He won t do it. It requires more work than I imagine (kmd, nspv, eldctrum, ...) but is can lower tx fee a lot, up to 85% less

[17-Sep-19 07:30 PM] Tek#5253
eh i'd just start working on an alternative

[17-Sep-19 07:30 PM] Tek#5253
BTC is on a path to failure

[17-Sep-19 07:31 PM] Tek#5253
it's also no secret that many mining pools and giants actually like BCH more

[17-Sep-19 07:31 PM] Tek#5253
lets not forget that the majority signalled for 2mb blocks

[17-Sep-19 07:31 PM] Tek#5253
and that core denied that signal

[17-Sep-19 07:32 PM] Tek#5253
and just did their own thing

https://decrypt.co/9278/segwit-transactions-now-make-up-over-50-of-bitcoin-payments
SegWit transactions now make up over 50% of Bitcoin payments
The move towards SegWit will result in cheaper and faster transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain.

[17-Sep-19 07:37 PM] jorian#4555
it basically means a 2mb block

[17-Sep-19 07:37 PM] Tek#5253
no it doesn't

[17-Sep-19 07:37 PM] jorian#4555
speaking in terms of number of transactions

[17-Sep-19 07:38 PM] Tek#5253
yeah. still core devs hijacked the btc project

[17-Sep-19 07:38 PM] Tek#5253
and did what the majority didnt want to do

[17-Sep-19 07:38 PM] Tek#5253
but its okay

[17-Sep-19 07:38 PM] Tek#5253
im happy with this course of history

[17-Sep-19 07:38 PM] Tek#5253
I was late to the party

[17-Sep-19 07:39 PM] Tek#5253
and BTC being cripple and on failure course is just an opportunity for me

[17-Sep-19 07:39 PM] Tek#5253
last time and first time I used BTC was in 2017

[17-Sep-19 07:39 PM] Tek#5253
they fucked up

[17-Sep-19 07:39 PM] Tek#5253
ive found the good projects

[17-Sep-19 07:40 PM] Tek#5253
I have my position

[17-Sep-19 07:40 PM] Tek#5253
I build my position over the past year

[17-Sep-19 07:40 PM] Tek#5253
now I wait.

[17-Sep-19 07:40 PM] Tek#5253
and hope BTC continues its path of failure

[17-Sep-19 07:41 PM] Tek#5253
its like a second chance since I missed the boat to buy BTC at a (few) hundred dollars

[17-Sep-19 09:55 PM] nocturnal#2177
btc hash rate mooning this year and consistently rising year on year

[17-Sep-19 09:57 PM] nocturnal#2177
so no shortage of miners @Tek

[17-Sep-19 09:59 PM] nocturnal#2177
dont buy alts just because youre salty about missing out on cheap btc

[17-Sep-19 09:59 PM] nocturnal#2177
we all wish we could go back and buy a few hundred üòÇ

[17-Sep-19 10:00 PM] nocturnal#2177
if btc fails its bad news for all of crypto

[17-Sep-19 10:00 PM] nocturnal#2177
including your portfolio

[17-Sep-19 10:00 PM] nocturnal#2177
but it wont i dont think for a long time

[18-Sep-19 04:54 AM] Tek#5253
Your comments indicate you don't know what the fuck I'm talking abour

[18-Sep-19 04:55 AM] Tek#5253
>> hurr Durr there's many miners

[18-Sep-19 05:07 AM] actionslacks#4072
the cost to mine a pow coin has pretty solid correlation with the price it's traded at.

[18-Sep-19 06:22 AM] jorian#4555
this gives them a reason to go on a fullblown money extravaganza

In summary, it allows LINE users (the primary social app of Japan) to acquire several coins including BCH through a simple exchange interface. I don't see any facility for using that directly to make payments, but I may have missed it or it may be coming in the future.

[18-Sep-19 11:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[18-Sep-19 11:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But there are red clouds too, which seems bad until we get above it

[18-Sep-19 11:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
then more white lines

[18-Sep-19 11:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I like cloudy

[18-Sep-19 12:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
unless btc and alts both go up

[18-Sep-19 12:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
