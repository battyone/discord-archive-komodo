Ok but then after time ofcourse the arbitrage profitability will tend to 0 right ?

[17-Aug-19 10:20 PM] crumb#2550
classical pricing model

[17-Aug-19 10:20 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
In theory but not reality

[17-Aug-19 10:20 PM] crumb#2550
no one makes bread anymore right?

[17-Aug-19 10:20 PM] crumb#2550
you make 0 dollars, anyway

[17-Aug-19 10:21 PM] crumb#2550
dude next door drops the price

[17-Aug-19 10:21 PM] crumb#2550
see what i'm getting at?

[17-Aug-19 10:21 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yes sure

[17-Aug-19 10:21 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Will be nice to see how this evolves :)

[17-Aug-19 10:22 PM] crumb#2550
yes

[17-Aug-19 10:22 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
When is release mates ?

[17-Aug-19 10:22 PM] crumb#2550
no official word yet. you can register for beta, to check it out before officially released

[17-Aug-19 10:22 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yeah I am in

[17-Aug-19 10:23 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Kk

[17-Aug-19 10:23 PM] crumb#2550
in AtomicDEX ama they said they plan to get the desktop version out end of this year / early 2020

[17-Aug-19 10:24 PM] crumb#2550
so i think they'll release some time before that

[17-Aug-19 10:24 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Good good

[17-Aug-19 10:24 PM] crumb#2550
or they wait the desktop to get ready, idk

[17-Aug-19 10:25 PM] crumb#2550
rough timeline is end of year

[17-Aug-19 10:25 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
👍

[17-Aug-19 10:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I can’t remember what does kmd do for benefitting with the dex? Was it liquidity multiplier only for kmd?
0 conf trading using kmd as collateral
Reduced fees?

[17-Aug-19 10:37 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Been a while since I’ve checked out barterdex or any of the dexes on komodo 😅

[17-Aug-19 11:37 PM] yorklab#7270
10 percent discount on trading fees if using KMD. Trading fees will be used to buy KMD.

[18-Aug-19 01:24 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
I like it , this has potential to pump my bags 😂

[18-Aug-19 01:24 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
What happens with those kmd though

[18-Aug-19 01:25 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Need to be burned for further gains

[18-Aug-19 01:25 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
👀

[18-Aug-19 01:31 AM] yorklab#7270
They go into various funds like DEX.

[18-Aug-19 01:40 AM] Caglio#3337
I want that kmd for myself

[18-Aug-19 01:40 AM] Caglio#3337
Invest in me

[18-Aug-19 02:06 AM] richardt#2807
All that sounds good, but the problem is getting things out of beta.  KMD doesn't have enough devs

[18-Aug-19 03:02 AM] PTYX#6840
I doubt that's the case

[18-Aug-19 03:08 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
K64 is dead

[18-Aug-19 03:08 AM] Caglio#3337
Is it ?

[18-Aug-19 03:08 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Didn’t spend too much on it thankfully

[18-Aug-19 03:08 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Swing and a miss

[18-Aug-19 03:08 AM] Caglio#3337
No goldman sachs ?

[18-Aug-19 03:09 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
You got hollow, cheers to you

[18-Aug-19 03:09 AM] Caglio#3337
Twilight punkster lied to us ?

[18-Aug-19 03:09 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
guaranteed

[18-Aug-19 03:09 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Though there is no news

[18-Aug-19 03:09 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just me ranting

[18-Aug-19 03:09 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah but price is soon gonna be 1:25

[18-Aug-19 03:10 AM] Caglio#3337
Little price drops

[18-Aug-19 03:10 AM] Caglio#3337

[18-Aug-19 03:10 AM] Caglio#3337

[18-Aug-19 03:11 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
They told a good story

[18-Aug-19 03:11 AM] Caglio#3337
Better story, than the games

[18-Aug-19 03:12 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Probably got $100k worth of KMD

[18-Aug-19 03:12 AM] Caglio#3337
Even more I guess

[18-Aug-19 03:12 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Oh yeah how’d the game thing go

[18-Aug-19 03:12 AM] Caglio#3337

[18-Aug-19 08:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yep and it fits into what James and the team have been doing.

One thing i would love to see is what is Komodo's just cause / vision that we are working towards to. @polycryptoblog is there anything like that defined anywhere?

[18-Aug-19 08:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Regardless of the rebrand, i would love to see a over all vision statement that we can all get behind. Once we have that, we attract others that want to see that eventuality just as much as we do

[18-Aug-19 08:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jl777c what do you think?

[18-Aug-19 08:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
One of the other concepts is, we are not the first, we are not the best, when playing a infinite game, there is only ahead and behind. This is dependent on a "competitor" to Komodo, dont know if there is one 😛

[18-Aug-19 08:16 AM] Audo#5667
hey guys, here are our current vision/mission statements

TAGLINE: Komodo: An Open, Composable Multi-Chain Platform

MISSION STATEMENT

VISION STATEMENT

Komodo’s vision is an open and free internet with thousands of application-specific blockchains working in unison to perform complex business functions in a decentralized and trustless manner, all while maintaining a spirit of collaboration and cooperation in the blockchain space.

[18-Aug-19 08:17 AM] Audo#5667
it is especially hard to come up with a concise, clear and meaningful vision statement

[18-Aug-19 08:18 AM] Audo#5667
let me know what you guys think, we can tweak it around. I agree a vision statement we all can get behind is an important one

[18-Aug-19 08:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Not knocking whoever wrote that but i would say there would be many other projects with very similar vision statements

[18-Aug-19 08:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Plus for a normie, that means nothing, too much buzz words

[18-Aug-19 08:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But as you said, coming up with something that resonates with everyone is very hard and i dont have an answer to that 😄

[18-Aug-19 08:21 AM] ph03nix#3115
i like the vision statement

[18-Aug-19 08:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
One other thing, the vision statement should not be something that is achievable but something we work towards to. I think for the most part Komodo has done what is set in the vision statement (not thousands of chains) @Audo

[18-Aug-19 08:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Also it is way too long, no one will remember what the vision statement is 😛

[18-Aug-19 08:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Some that i like and are simple:

TED: Spread ideas.

[18-Aug-19 08:36 AM] Audo#5667
I agree, but I also think we must first find a longer form vision statement and then once we are happy with it we think of a way to condense it into a single sentence.

[18-Aug-19 08:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586
One other thing to consider, we dont want to confuse  a goal as a vision, a goal is a step towards the vision

[18-Aug-19 08:41 AM] Audo#5667
I remember jl777 once said how he envisions everyone to be running their own personal blockchain at some point. Maybe something close to that, also it refers to the multi-chain tech.

[18-Aug-19 08:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Komodo - Freedom to interact trustlessly

[18-Aug-19 08:48 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I like something like that, dont even need to mention blockchain or any of the other buzz words but something our users/devs/everyone can get behind. They may have different ideas about what the vision statement may mean but each wants to work towards that.

I don't think you have to stand apart in single sentence description. You can't turn blockchain tech into a unicorn saddle

[18-Aug-19 09:31 AM] Bittersweet#9376
I like the original statements @Audo

[18-Aug-19 10:06 AM] costa2439#3771
good video to show people

[18-Aug-19 10:42 AM] Audo#5667
I think we should have both, a few word / short sentence vision + a bit longer explanation that opens it up more

What happened with Lisk? anyone know? -25% against btc last 24h

[18-Aug-19 12:03 PM] meatspoon#7860
What KMD (and many other projects) needs is some use case examples that Joe Six-Pack can understand. There are too many buzz words without concrete examples of a use case. Ends up sounding like a techy circle jerk.
