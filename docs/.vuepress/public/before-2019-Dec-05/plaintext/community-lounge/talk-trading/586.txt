when the community thinks getting on exchanges with fake volume has actual value

[26-Apr-19 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
even getting on exchanges with real volumes, doesnt have much value when we are already on binance

[26-Apr-19 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
give it two more years

[26-Apr-19 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
i think by then we will see a separation between the whitepaper "hopes and dreams" projects who cant get anything to actually work will fade strongly and the ones that deliver and get real adoption will start rising

Rip MobileGo. That thing really did go belly up.

[26-Apr-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
they used to have marketcap almost as much as KMD, if I remember right

[26-Apr-19 07:33 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
It was up there. Almost purchased some myself but didn't. There were a few red flags that kept coming up so avoided it.

[26-Apr-19 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
all things considered $100 million is not so bad a place to be. of course it is still well below where we should be when the market understands that KMD is not just a zcash fork

OBV - on balance volume   KMD , looks pretty nice https://charts.cointrader.pro/snapshot/N4ESY.png

My KMD rewards makes it easy to ignore the market down turn like this. I do like to watch other train wrecks though with other coins.

if you start following the technical developments, your focus will not be on  daily ups and downs of the irrational lemmings markets

[26-Apr-19 07:45 PM] crumb#2550
then price movements don't seem to matter so much anymore

[26-Apr-19 07:46 PM] crumb#2550
it happened to me 🤓

[26-Apr-19 07:47 PM] crumb#2550
so yes. take a break OR start learning about tech @coingirl87

[26-Apr-19 07:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
TBFair JL, it's only 40 BTC that the unknown exchange wanted to charge 😛

[26-Apr-19 07:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Unless you're talking about another.

[26-Apr-19 07:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Which you likely are whether we know it or not.

[26-Apr-19 07:59 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I loving the KMD chart. Any other coin and I would say it was on a verge of a massive bull but the market tends to make me wrong with the random tether fud and all.

[26-Apr-19 08:06 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Cheap komodos everywhere

[26-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Markus#5464
ofc it is way too manipulated and ppl wonder why wall street didnt start trading cryptos or why a bitcoin etf keep getting delayed. When things like this happen whats now going on with bitfinex and tether its not very strange to me why everything keep getting delayed.

[26-Apr-19 09:04 PM] Markus#5464
For things to become reality when it comes to even a ETF first they would need to get rid of majority of the wash trading exchanges and definitely tether

[26-Apr-19 09:14 PM] phm87#7395
What is the difference between an ETF and an ETP ? Exchange Traded Fund and Exchange Traded Product I think but how do they differ ?

sometimes supports dont hold 😦

[26-Apr-19 09:19 PM] crumb#2550
@Deleted User i know very well that coingirl is a big KMD holder. that is why it is surprising that she comes here quite often to complain about price. even tho, james has explained to her many times the possible reason why prices act irrationally.

but hey, everybody has the right to vent. i don't mind, really. just sorta surprised that big-time holders follow price action so closely. even when they don't plan to sell short term

[26-Apr-19 09:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the more you have is the more 2 cent change matters?

[26-Apr-19 10:10 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Fuck dumpers. 😛

[26-Apr-19 10:11 PM] Alexfrog#1338
anyone who dumps KMD after a 50% decline in satoshi price deserves to be hated on

[26-Apr-19 10:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There's an irony of people complaining that it was 17k and now complaining that others are selling at 18k

[26-Apr-19 10:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you collect rewards on KMD, anyone buying at 17k and selling at 18k made greater return than you do 😛

[26-Apr-19 10:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and in a few days, not a year

[26-Apr-19 10:21 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
If there is nothing to complain the people Sure will find something :)

[26-Apr-19 10:21 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Alexfrog i dumped at 1845 dont be mad

[26-Apr-19 10:21 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i hope you lost money dumping that low 😛

[26-Apr-19 10:22 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Hmm

[26-Apr-19 10:22 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
No

[26-Apr-19 10:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`If there is nothing to complain the people Sure will find something :)`
So true, I find something new every day 😛

[26-Apr-19 10:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_dumped some at 18.5 and made 5.71%_ * in a day

[26-Apr-19 10:27 PM] Alexfrog#1338
if you bought with btc and sold and got less btc, it counts as losing, even if the btc is worth more USDshitcoins now

[26-Apr-19 10:27 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Congratz bro :)

[26-Apr-19 10:27 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Lovely pump

[26-Apr-19 10:28 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Alexfrog its fine :)

[26-Apr-19 10:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if you bought with btc and sold and got less btc`
buy at 17.5 and sell at 18.5 --- it's not *less*

[26-Apr-19 10:28 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Hahaha

[26-Apr-19 10:28 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[26-Apr-19 10:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[26-Apr-19 10:32 PM] Alexfrog#1338
best thing about it is that I can trade it in KMD, and make KMD profits 😉

[26-Apr-19 10:33 PM] Alexfrog#1338
then hodl the KMD for 5% gains

[26-Apr-19 10:33 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

Obvious buy

[26-Apr-19 10:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
traders are only second to utility in providing value increase

[26-Apr-19 10:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
holders actually create a value decrease 
that's why recessions last longer when no one spends

[26-Apr-19 10:37 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

Would be nice if KMD pushes to 20K sats now and not bleed back after a nice candle.

[27-Apr-19 11:46 AM] Tek#5253

[27-Apr-19 11:46 AM] Tek#5253
ffs

[27-Apr-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810

[27-Apr-19 11:51 AM] Tek#5253

[27-Apr-19 11:51 AM] Tek#5253

[27-Apr-19 11:55 AM] mrlynch#5735
lol, he was buying 40btc worth last week

[27-Apr-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
that doesnt count

[27-Apr-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
he means the marketwide selloff where 90% of coins went down as BTC dominance grows

[27-Apr-19 11:57 AM] mrlynch#5735
_still waiting for the percentdropacolypse shirt_

[27-Apr-19 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
where are all the ones crying about how KMD is always dropping more? today KMD is #8 on binance gainers vs BTC

[27-Apr-19 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
and also eighth on CMC gainers of top 100

[27-Apr-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
if KMD goes down when all others do and then also goes down when all the others are going up, then maybe worry a little

[27-Apr-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
after all the up and down, trading at $1, #54 in overall CMC (that is polluted by a lot of non-coins, stablecoins, etc)

[27-Apr-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
few coins have held up so well, especially without giant marketing spending

[27-Apr-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
remember coins that used to be in the top 50, like peercoin (250+), blackcoin (450+)

[27-Apr-19 12:03 PM] Tek#5253
fren, I always complain

[27-Apr-19 12:03 PM] Tek#5253
imagine complaining about bagholding the KMD bottom

[27-Apr-19 12:03 PM] Tek#5253
> thats me

[27-Apr-19 12:03 PM] Tek#5253
pls don't sell your entire stack fren

[27-Apr-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i havent sold any of it
