_thinks the US should just do a feken eDollar and get all of these fektards out of the crypto space_

[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> I dont know what is happening but its going way worse than i thought

It's all "horrible" until BTC hits $25k and the "great fappening" happens all over again

[22-Jun-18 06:29 PM] Tyrael#0138
happens if you can't see into the future

[22-Jun-18 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> Im talking about the eos thing

[22-Jun-18 06:32 PM] Tyrael#0138
ah, i forgot.. siu is big bag holder of EOS

[22-Jun-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> No, not at all.

[22-Jun-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> But some big eos whales are here where i live.

[22-Jun-18 06:35 PM] Tyrael#0138
as long they stay clean and have good "social credits" all will be fine !

[22-Jun-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> Nah, i really dont like this account banning thing

[22-Jun-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> The ends dont justify the means

[22-Jun-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> Ive been invited to work on a group that wants to make an exchange here in PR, but they are very cocky with eos... :(

[22-Jun-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> Im slowly convincing the right people about using the barterdex backend

[22-Jun-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> At least the devs are totally convinced but the money people still seem to need a push for convicing

[22-Jun-18 08:09 PM] jeezy#3408
@jl777c   they can already do that. they can lock any account and they can even withdraw from any account in EOS

[22-Jun-18 08:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
O.O

[22-Jun-18 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
but I think the BP needs to have some conference call?

[22-Jun-18 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
why not just eliminate that step and make an automated process? That would be far more govt friendly and that seems to be the main concern for EOS. It is the blockchain for govts to control the easiest

[22-Jun-18 08:13 PM] jeezy#3408
so it will pump the  most next alt season,  reading between the lines here,    go all in on EOS and XRP  roger!

[22-Jun-18 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems to be turning into XRP2.0

[22-Jun-18 08:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think its much worse than xrp

[22-Jun-18 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the 2.0 is supposed to do a lot better job and EOS seems to be doing that

[22-Jun-18 08:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I want to find the way to integrate eos into barterdex

[22-Jun-18 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
if EOS is basically a refactored bitshares, artem will be able to add support for it as it had multisig and secp256 crypto

[22-Jun-18 08:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Would be nice to have an exit door

[22-Jun-18 08:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
For eos users

[22-Jun-18 08:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hmm, will communicate with him, try to put him into contact with the devs im working with.

@KomodoPlatform is extremely undervalued where it's at.

No need to be grandma friendly, just need to make a shitload of money by spending the least amount of money to make it

[23-Jun-18 12:38 PM] RAE#3178
Any one have ideas why KMD's volume is increasing at the moment?

[23-Jun-18 12:39 PM] RAE#3178
Did I miss some news or something? Bittrex has 78 BTC moving through and it's in the green (marginally though).

[23-Jun-18 12:43 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Maybe someones or people see the mid 20's as a good deal.

[23-Jun-18 12:46 PM] RAE#3178
People just like Komodo.

[23-Jun-18 12:48 PM] RAE#3178
People will like Komodo more when the fundamentals are well known - and when fundamentals again matter in the markets.
