It's too early to shill, people only understand on the surface. so if we talk about atomic swaps or CC we've lost 99.99% of people

[14-Jul-19 01:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[14-Jul-19 02:06 PM] Alright#0419
the people you're talking about are the worse kind of crypto people IMO

[14-Jul-19 02:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we need someone that makes the sheep feel like they understand and can see the future of kmd

[14-Jul-19 02:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[14-Jul-19 02:06 PM] Alright#0419

good, a few more

[14-Jul-19 02:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
IMO Barry Shillbert is a good target to convince about KMD

[14-Jul-19 02:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that guy not only does shill, he also makes sure that hedge funds who buy crypto buy the coin he shills

[14-Jul-19 02:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he also makes sure to get the coin listed in as many exchanges as possible

[14-Jul-19 02:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he is the one maintaining ETC alive for example.

[14-Jul-19 02:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and the reason why ETC is on coinbase and such

[14-Jul-19 02:22 PM] Markus#5464

No, puerto rico is in the caribbean

[14-Jul-19 03:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
Can anyone in a nutshell explain how the new Dex will handle liquidity?  seems like one of the major problems with old barterdex was liquidity or the unlikelihood that someone out there wanted to trade the exact quantity of the exact coin you wanted for the exact price denominated in a second coin...

[14-Jul-19 03:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
with prices moving so quickly the way they do, it almost seems like CEX's are superior for the time being

[14-Jul-19 03:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
once prices stabilize a bit, in a couple years, Dex's might not have as much of a liquidity problem
