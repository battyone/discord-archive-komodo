[19-Jun-19 12:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[19-Jun-19 12:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[19-Jun-19 12:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I went looking if it really did change something in their own code, but it was more fun to see it all replaced with bitcoin core

[19-Jun-19 12:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if they cancel this PR, I say "Do it again!" 😂

[19-Jun-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
i see, it seems they haved merged in that PR yet

i know about BUY KMD

[19-Jun-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD sale at binance, the big selloff

[19-Jun-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD to $1 soon

[19-Jun-19 12:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And i bought too soon. 🐷

[19-Jun-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
50 BTC of volume since binance opened, it seems down to 16k or so to find support and at that point, who hasnt sold who will sell at slightly higher prices

[19-Jun-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
not exactly the blowoff sell, but maybe that is all the sell side volume there is

[19-Jun-19 12:51 PM] PHBA2061#2530
Coinbene's volume surges again ...

[19-Jun-19 12:58 PM] yorklab#7270
I think many don't want to sell at a loss so they are waiting for a higher price to get out.

[19-Jun-19 12:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What loss?

[19-Jun-19 01:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Price was at 1.47 when the hack happened

[19-Jun-19 01:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Still above that

[19-Jun-19 01:00 PM] yorklab#7270
That doesn't mean that's where they bought it.

[19-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Tek#5253
glad I sold after the hack tbh.

[19-Jun-19 01:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
How come?

[19-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Tek#5253
cuz I can pick up way cheaper now

[19-Jun-19 01:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It topped after the hack, not before

[19-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Tek#5253
I didn't sell the top

[19-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Tek#5253
but its still below what i sold for

[19-Jun-19 01:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We are back to when the hack happened

[19-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Tek#5253
I have unrealistic orders at 13k and 14k too

[19-Jun-19 01:05 PM] yorklab#7270
In any case the dip is short-term and it'll be nice when the hack is old news.

[19-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Tek#5253
japanase exchange listing next month if im correct

[19-Jun-19 01:06 PM] yorklab#7270
Yes, many good things to come for sure.

technically a swap cannot be with oneself, no? 🤔

[19-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Lumbi#8378
@Tek VRSC, ARRR & LABS are ecosystem coins

[19-Jun-19 01:34 PM] Tek#5253
I think he has both

[19-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Lumbi#8378

`i just dont want to risk gettign stuck with shitcoin bags`

`BTC is shitcoin to many too. I remember Genie hates it `
It's important to note the distinction that I hate BTC and not bitcoin 😉

[19-Jun-19 02:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
confused.... what is the difference in your understanding ?

[19-Jun-19 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BTC is the centralized bastardization of bitcoin driven by personal gain, economic decisions of CEXs, and self aggrandizing parties

BTC goal = not P2P
bitcoin goal = P2P

[19-Jun-19 02:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you mean bitcoin as protocol is good and BTC being a currency is what you not like?

[19-Jun-19 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, because the goal of BTC is for it to *not* be a currency, but rather a commodity

[19-Jun-19 02:16 PM] Malti#3948
the name 'PIRATE' made me at least look at the coin, then realized Fishy and co were super active in discord and super focused on adoption, so decided to buy a stack (which i lost in a boating accident obviously)

[19-Jun-19 02:16 PM] Malti#3948
so it is the name that made me look

[19-Jun-19 02:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, now clearer. thanks 👍

[19-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Malti#3948
