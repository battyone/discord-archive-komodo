2012 halving reduced the new supply by $302,400 per week.

2016 halving reduced the new supply by $8,190,000 per week.

2020 halving will reduce the new supply by $63,000,000 per week.

Making the next #Bitcoin halving the most dramatic yet.

@Cryptoon how do halvennings usually affect alts

[18-Oct-19 12:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Waiting for alt season üò¨

[18-Oct-19 12:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
look at last ARRR halving, it puuuuumped

[18-Oct-19 12:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if btc halves, not sure, wasnt around myself in2016 yet üò¶

[18-Oct-19 12:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but if btc price increases, it wouldnt be illogical to assume that a lot of money would also flow into alts!

[18-Oct-19 12:38 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I presume it could be a very dangerous time for Btc as well, if profitability turns off a lot of miners

[18-Oct-19 12:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the contrary, no?

[18-Oct-19 12:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if price follows halving

[18-Oct-19 12:39 PM] JimD#9272
The current theory for alt season is that Eth 2.0 and defi applications on the Eth blockchain will cause the next alt season

[18-Oct-19 12:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so half the btc, but if price goes x3 it's still profitable

[18-Oct-19 12:40 PM] JimD#9272
It looks like it takes a few months for the halvening price shock to really kick in from the last few times its happened

[18-Oct-19 12:40 PM] JimD#9272
I think BTC is going down in the short term

[18-Oct-19 12:40 PM] JimD#9272
6K is when I start buying again

[18-Oct-19 12:41 PM] jorian#4555

[18-Oct-19 12:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But a lot of people eyeing 6k

[18-Oct-19 12:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the 4chan prophecy guy said flash drop to 5.5 or 6,3k (cant remember which) and then facemelting pump to 9k and 15k for the month

[18-Oct-19 12:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or something like that

[18-Oct-19 12:44 PM] JimD#9272
I got my cash sitting on an exchange waiting for that to happen ü§∑

[18-Oct-19 12:45 PM] jorian#4555
also saw a graphic of BTC dropping 40% and not more

[18-Oct-19 12:45 PM] jorian#4555
and we're basically at the 40% already

[18-Oct-19 12:45 PM] jorian#4555
if history repeats itself, it's up from here

[18-Oct-19 12:47 PM] JimD#9272
Could be.  Im suspicious though

[18-Oct-19 12:59 PM] jorian#4555
there is still a stress test coming

[18-Oct-19 12:59 PM] jorian#4555
i'm hoping it will bring some good media attention

[18-Oct-19 01:04 PM] JimD#9272
Would be awesome if they could build a nice looking web client and make it feel like the CEX most commoners are used to

80k sats at 10k usd btc is what, 8usd?

[18-Oct-19 04:37 PM] Markus#5464
yes 8$

[18-Oct-19 04:38 PM] Markus#5464
1 / 0,0008 = 1250
10000 / 1250 = 8$

[18-Oct-19 04:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But by then 50k btc, so 40$ kmd guaranteed

coinbase/gemini/sofi/fidelity/robinhood and more "legit" insured US institutions... i am sure they will climb on board soon giving out interest on crypto holdings as well.

[18-Oct-19 09:06 PM] Privatoshi#9487
@dan. I don't see it.
Interest is already making up hundreds of millions, on single platforms

Dai & Maker on compound & the fulcrum

[18-Oct-19 09:06 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Now sUSD and SETH, with Synthetix

[18-Oct-19 09:06 PM] dan.#2473
how much do they give

[18-Oct-19 09:07 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Depends on the crypto, of course.
Some are run by a DAO

[18-Oct-19 09:07 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Lending rates change.

[18-Oct-19 09:07 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Frequently

[18-Oct-19 09:08 PM] Privatoshi#9487
DAI was over 13% lending, 22% borrowing

[18-Oct-19 09:08 PM] dan.#2473
theyre part of this too arent they? i think people will chase this ROI in crypto, especially with stablecoins

[18-Oct-19 09:08 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I disagree.

[18-Oct-19 09:08 PM] dan.#2473
defi and centralized things

[18-Oct-19 09:08 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Bc most depend on collateralization

[18-Oct-19 09:08 PM] Privatoshi#9487
150% of what you borrow

[18-Oct-19 09:09 PM] Privatoshi#9487
And if your rate of borrowed crypto, falls below 25%, you are liquidated

[18-Oct-19 09:09 PM] dan.#2473
i guess i dont entirely follow those platforms.

[18-Oct-19 09:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What if they borrow against crypto to buy more crypto
