any word on when an official komodo team agama will be released?

[04-Jul-19 07:50 PM] Markus#5464
In Antara AMA they said agama project will be given to Verus to continue on it

Daily and 4h look sexy

[04-Jul-19 08:05 PM] p.#1126
1400 seems like a nice lvl b4 namek

[04-Jul-19 08:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They will release atomicdex as allinone multi coin wallet/ dex I think

[04-Jul-19 08:08 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Cryptoon look at the atomicdex website, someone trading 3k KMD for 2BTC fulfilling your promise üòÑ

#theprophecy

[04-Jul-19 08:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If the prophecy comes true I will rain 1000 arrr in here

[04-Jul-19 08:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No wait

[04-Jul-19 08:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
When the prophecy comes true!

[04-Jul-19 08:12 PM] actionslacks#4072
many have been waiting for kmd to make it's move.  fomo dont fail us now

[04-Jul-19 08:13 PM] Grisu#3373
just get a drink and enjoy the show :>

[04-Jul-19 08:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
they should have wait till the 10, atomicdex fomo, 15, website/rebrand fomo, big partnership fomo, CZ using Komodo tech fomo üòõ

[04-Jul-19 08:16 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Would be at 100k sats only

[04-Jul-19 08:17 PM] hyperDEX#6586
In saying that, anyone that needed a excuse to get out, got out at 10k sats

[04-Jul-19 08:17 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Right now it is people taking profits, once we get back to 20k i think it will be much easier to move up

[04-Jul-19 08:18 PM] hyperDEX#6586
:troll_thuglife:  also we will surpass waves soon

[04-Jul-19 08:19 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Waves collect 30,000 BTC, KMD collected less than 3,000

[04-Jul-19 08:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
On the 15th if the team releases something else, i would say top 40 not out of the question

[04-Jul-19 08:24 PM] p.#1126
14th will be interesting

[04-Jul-19 08:24 PM] p.#1126
Ppl tend to abandon ship pre release

[04-Jul-19 08:26 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Hope it won't be sell the news

[04-Jul-19 08:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
I tend to abandon @p. 's mom post release

[04-Jul-19 08:30 PM] p.#1126
Same here, funny how you feel after pouring out a gallon

[04-Jul-19 08:30 PM] p.#1126
Momswap

[04-Jul-19 08:30 PM] p.#1126

indeed, BTC can handle all crypto transactions forever with no problems whatsoever. üòÑ

[05-Jul-19 06:12 AM] actionslacks#4072
just read the list of current coins supported: BTC, USDC, ETH, BCH, LTC, DASH, QTUM, BAT, DGB, DOGE, RFOX, VRSC, KMD.  looks like kmd is shooting to kill. eth swaps right out of the gate.  world domination imminent

[05-Jul-19 06:19 AM] Alexfrog#1338
14k

[05-Jul-19 06:21 AM] Alexfrog#1338

if you can swap eth for kmd on your phone without kyc, it's over. hire an accountant.
