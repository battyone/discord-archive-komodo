there's something off when the "evidence" creates more questions than answers. it's like craig wright style evidence or proof

[06-Sep-19 10:53 PM] yorklab#7270
If the $1.3B valuation proves to be true, it could make some people rich. So there is a lot at stake here. The truth can't come out soon enough.

[06-Sep-19 10:58 PM] PTYX#6840
it'll be interesting how the refunds will be processed

[06-Sep-19 10:59 PM] PTYX#6840
they asked users for a digitaprice screenshot to proof they purchased at a certain time. how will they know if it's real? is DP giving out information?

[06-Sep-19 11:02 PM] PTYX#6840
they published it, nothing secret

What exactly about k64 is valued at $1.3b?

[07-Sep-19 12:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They dont have intellectual property since the tech they say they will use is open source

[07-Sep-19 12:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Name?.? Dont think so. The office at the hague? Greatly doubt so... The games they showed at the expo??? They were not even minimally done...

[07-Sep-19 01:11 AM] PHBA2061#2530
$1.3B is indeed an unrealistic number based on what they currently have (or reveal so far).
If they're serious let's see how long does it take to update the K64 whitepaper, the current WP still have Redfox Labs as partner & some blurred parts ...

[07-Sep-19 01:18 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I wonder why they need to prove anything to stakeholders on discord (through the signing of NDAs etc) when they have a $78mill investment opportunity. All the investors on discord wouldnt be a drop in the ocean compared to that. Why would they put so much effort into trying to prove they're legit? Why not just settle the massive investment and release products for people to use? There is no need to prove anything when you have a legit product people can use and you have a massive budget to use for marketing etc.

"Lightning Network Micropayments Are Not Trustless at All"

[07-Sep-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
as BTC txfees rise, the issue becomes more important, but that is the exact usecase for LN, to avoid the high BTC txfees

[07-Sep-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
```The problem occurs if the value-in-flight is below the BTC dust threshold, in which case it can‚Äôt be used as a third output in the channel-state transaction.

‚ÄúIt is thus not possible to use hash- and time-locks to protect the payment if the payment is too small,‚Äù ```
