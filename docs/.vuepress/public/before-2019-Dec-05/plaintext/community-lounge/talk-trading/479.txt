Oh right I understand. Agreed, I was more enquiring about what the comparable offerings were. But reading your message again, you were asking me! To answer, im not sure, I'd have to do more research before I could say. Maybe someone that knows in this channel could answer?
I agree with your philosophy on investing. My thoughts are that although other coins maybe be offering similar offers to this, we should always question the validity and legitimacy of such offerings in our ecosystem.

[19-Mar-19 11:41 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Also, as we have seen in most things crypto related, judging price for things like this is a difficult task.

[19-Mar-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a lot like real estate, where the same price would be a total bargain in one location, but a total overprice in another location

[19-Mar-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
the RFOX valuation to me is within reason, it just depends on if you feel it is a good long term investment. certainly the days of flipping ico for immediate big gains are over, so any such thing should be based on a long term thinking

[19-Mar-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
now, take my words with grains of salt as I like RFOX in that it will bring new funds into the ecosystem so that likely colors my feelings for it other than just a pure investement analysis of it in isolation

[19-Mar-19 11:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I personally think $5million is ok for starting a business like this

[19-Mar-19 11:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
From my experience from chainmakers, its really tough to get started with less than that. Even though we have managed ourself with nothing else than our notary nodes and my own money

[19-Mar-19 11:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think and investment of $5m would be just what we needed to pay for development of some customized tools that create a good brand image.

[19-Mar-19 11:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Not really sure how much experience you guys have in the real world with raising money, but raising 5M with nothing to show for it besides a whitepaper is an insane amount of money üòÉ

[19-Mar-19 11:49 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And development is really hard to coordinate and expensive, especially in crypto.

[19-Mar-19 11:49 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah definitely, I can definitely see the positives in that respect. 
Personally, I was more drawing to attention the way they were going about their offering and opening discussions to peoples thoughts on it.  Thanks for sharing yours thoughts!
Siu, i think for a company offering promises, its hard to justify that amount of money, dont you think?

[19-Mar-19 11:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I recently raised 1.5M for a new venture of mine, but I have 35 people working for me and we will have at least 5-6M in revenues this year

[19-Mar-19 11:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Valuation was approx 1x yearly revenue

[19-Mar-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
crypto is a different world

[19-Mar-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
compared to bull market craziness, this is pretty sedate

[19-Mar-19 11:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah, but still, saying 5M is normal to basically just start a crypto consultancy firm is crazy tbh

[19-Mar-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
if you feel that way, then dont invest

[19-Mar-19 11:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Consultancy is relatively low overhead, mostly personel expenses which should be covered with revenues, at least after a year or two

[19-Mar-19 11:51 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I have not read the whitepaper, but yeah, with $1.5million we could get a lot done hehhe

[19-Mar-19 11:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Just giving some input from my experiences in the real world

[19-Mar-19 11:52 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Totally agreed. @Cryptoon

[19-Mar-19 11:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
the thing I would like to see more in these types of startups is a real business plan, how will they generate revenues/ebitda etc

[19-Mar-19 11:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Give a detailed businessplan with revenues/costs etc

[19-Mar-19 11:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Kind of like OOT did for their past year

[19-Mar-19 11:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think it would have been nice for them to get a project up and running first as a showcase of what they are impulsing.

[19-Mar-19 11:55 AM] jorian#4555
rfox has been live and dpowed for 8 months now. 380,000 blocks have been mined so far, and diff is exploding, not a real surprise

[19-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Alright#0419
lol at 400 blocks since jl answered that question :troll:

[19-Mar-19 11:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So the ZEX snapshot is already made? Why isnt this in the whitepaper? (or I missed it?)

[19-Mar-19 11:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
' All ZEX holders will receive 1 RFOX for each ZEX on an agreed-upon date. '

[19-Mar-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810

[19-Mar-19 01:24 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
If you had a zex balance before block 180500 then you will be included in the snap shot for Redfox yes

[19-Mar-19 01:24 PM] kaks#6612
feels bad man i have low zex balance

[19-Mar-19 01:25 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I only mind a few aswell back in Nov by looks of it.

[19-Mar-19 01:25 PM] Alright#0419

[19-Mar-19 01:26 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
hopefully DP spread the love to Zex holders on the exchange. Needs to be asked

[19-Mar-19 01:27 PM] kaks#6612
free *DP* for all zex miners and traders

Depends how long the 'bleeding' takes. Might be a small pump inbetween. But nothing signifcant imo. Ending of Q1 will def be interresting!

New trendline is insanely steep

Insane how CZ & the binance team created this hype cloud arround Binance Launchpad

[19-Mar-19 03:01 PM] sœÜldat#8733
Komodo $KMD already do everything what $CELR expects to do.
People like money, not real technology.
So sad.

[19-Mar-19 03:03 PM] Alecandro#1179
KMd team just needs to keep doing what they‚Äôre doing. The money will catch up with the tech eventually

[19-Mar-19 03:05 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
PPl want that quick easy binance 2-3x as with all the other junk launched on there

[19-Mar-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
what marketcap did CELR achieve?

[19-Mar-19 03:06 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
But i must say, the fact the launchpad model is a failure and cannot handle the masses that want to buy. It creates some nice trading opportunities that i can take advantage of because those other 30k ppl who could not buy today will try to buy on first day of trading creating some nice voltillity

[19-Mar-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
how much did they raise

[19-Mar-19 03:07 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
No idea ill have a look

[19-Mar-19 03:08 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

so how does this compare with RFOX?

[19-Mar-19 03:13 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I think Rfox has more to show than this does

[19-Mar-19 03:14 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
the 13mill obvs comes with all the CZ hype etc so i guess it was easy to achieve for them

[19-Mar-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
the market is what the market is, so objectively speaking on a comparables basis RFOX is a better deal

[19-Mar-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
that is all we can say. whether CELR will be good or bad, really depends on the timing of bull market coming alive
