It's kinda cute actually

[20-Jul-19 12:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yeah

[20-Jul-19 12:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
I wanna hug him... but I am scared he will bite me or i will get scabies.

`proselytizing about KMD’s superiority`
proselytizing about BTC’s inferiority (to nearly everything)
get it right

[20-Jul-19 12:50 PM] richardt#2807
If we had more ComputerGenie's in the world, KMD would be worth much more 😄

[20-Jul-19 12:51 PM] meatspoon#7860
We would need millions of Genies tho. That sounds like.... too many.

[20-Jul-19 12:51 PM] designer#4893
merchant has no choice but to collude with politicians in order to continue his business. In this process, the ostensible justice of users' rights and social values is thoroughly trampled on.

[20-Jul-19 12:51 PM] richardt#2807
Yeah, but KMD would be like $100

[20-Jul-19 12:51 PM] meatspoon#7860
Sounds like an irresponsible thing to do to humanity

[20-Jul-19 12:51 PM] richardt#2807
I wouldn't mind

[20-Jul-19 12:51 PM] Tek#5253
Jesus doesn't like genies; let's hang him

[20-Jul-19 12:51 PM] richardt#2807
haha

[20-Jul-19 12:52 PM] designer#4893
how will you win politics? public power is really scary.

[20-Jul-19 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Jesus doesn't like genies; let's hang him`
Lies!!
I have 9 friends named Jesus and they all like me just fine

[20-Jul-19 12:52 PM] p.#1126
the big fat #1 next to it seems so inferior

[20-Jul-19 12:52 PM] richardt#2807
I call BS... nobody has 9 friends named Jesus

[20-Jul-19 12:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
But they aren’t the real Jesus. They are just BTC jesuses.

[20-Jul-19 12:52 PM] richardt#2807
😄

[20-Jul-19 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I call BS... nobody has 9 friends named Jesus`
Seems you've never been to Texas 🤷🏽

[20-Jul-19 12:53 PM] Tek#5253
Too hot for me

[20-Jul-19 12:54 PM] richardt#2807
Now that I think about, maybe ComputerGenie was KMD's marketing strategy

[20-Jul-19 12:55 PM] designer#4893
blockchain philosophy of decentralization is already seriously undermined. and the value of decentralization will be further diluted by the complex political interests of each country, the lure of commercialization, strengthened regulations and the entry of global companies into blockchain businesses.

[20-Jul-19 12:56 PM] designer#4893
Whether Satoshi Nakamoto wanted it or not, the U.S. and China would try to utilize Bitcoin in a way favorable to their countries and we would have to accept the order they designed.

[20-Jul-19 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` maybe ComputerGenie was KMD's marketing strategy`
there's no part of my involvement with rendering purchased merchandise pointless and swapping out a shield for an egg being fertilized

[20-Jul-19 12:58 PM] Markus#5464
thought i read notary nodes were involved in voting for the logo?

[20-Jul-19 12:59 PM] richardt#2807
I meant the part where you convince everyone to sell everything and buy KMD

[20-Jul-19 12:59 PM] richardt#2807
that most important job

[20-Jul-19 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`thought i read notary nodes were involved in voting for the logo?`
If we were, no one informed me, my 1st seeing of it was when it was announced that the website was updated

[20-Jul-19 01:00 PM] Markus#5464
Ok

[20-Jul-19 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I meant the part where you convince everyone to sell everything and buy KMD`
I wouldn't even do that, why would I try to convince others to?

[20-Jul-19 01:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
KMD has its place as do 100 other currencies

[20-Jul-19 01:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
Just not btc.

[20-Jul-19 01:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
Or wait!  Btc has its place in the dustbin of history, or something like that

[20-Jul-19 01:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
Did I do that right?

[20-Jul-19 01:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BTC's place is in the pits of hell so that Bitcoin can return

[20-Jul-19 01:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
Lol, close.

[20-Jul-19 01:02 PM] richardt#2807
My bad, I meant the part where you convince everyone to completely drop BTC and buy other currencies of your choosing, one of which happens to be KMD

[20-Jul-19 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I love that @p. "blocks" me and then reads all my comments anyway 🤣

[20-Jul-19 01:03 PM] p.#1126
💒

[20-Jul-19 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and buy other currencies of your choosing`
Only 2 people even know of more than 1/2 of my coins of choosing, and the other one is my wife 🤷🏽

[20-Jul-19 01:04 PM] p.#1126
its a treat

[20-Jul-19 01:04 PM] p.#1126
like how stupid while tryng to sound smart will it be this time

[20-Jul-19 01:04 PM] Markus#5464
probably only ecosystem coins

[20-Jul-19 01:04 PM] p.#1126
who cares coin

[20-Jul-19 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`probably only ecosystem coins`
I only hold any useful amount of 3 of those
feel free to guess again 😛

kmd chips pirate

[20-Jul-19 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
2 out of 3 aint bad

[20-Jul-19 01:05 PM] richardt#2807
Didn't know this was a guessing game

[20-Jul-19 01:06 PM] meatspoon#7860
Genie is just so playful.

[20-Jul-19 01:06 PM] richardt#2807
plays well with others

[20-Jul-19 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Didn't know this was a guessing game`
yes, and if you guess correctly you get 1 WLC

[20-Jul-19 01:09 PM] richardt#2807
I don't want WLC.  Just want you to simply convince people to drop BTC and buy KMD, that's all.  Is that too much to ask?

[20-Jul-19 01:09 PM] p.#1126
yes

[20-Jul-19 01:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
He really needs to try harder.

[20-Jul-19 01:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
And he needs to dial up the pretentiousness and haughty attitude.  More of that makes arguments more convincing.

[20-Jul-19 01:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
People need to be insulted into ditching btc

[20-Jul-19 01:11 PM] p.#1126
....

[20-Jul-19 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Just want you to simply convince people to drop BTC and buy KMD, that's all. Is that too much to ask?`
Yes because it's not a do x then do y issue
it's an issue that
x =x
y=y
not
x>y

[20-Jul-19 01:11 PM] p.#1126
but x is so much greater than y

[20-Jul-19 01:11 PM] p.#1126
u just dumb

[20-Jul-19 01:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
So... x<y?

[20-Jul-19 01:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
And is x the grapes or the bananas?  I am confused.

[20-Jul-19 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`And is x the grapes or the bananas?`
yes

[20-Jul-19 01:13 PM] richardt#2807
apples = apples, bananas = bananas,  apples not > than bananas or vice versa because people don't live in reality

[20-Jul-19 01:14 PM] richardt#2807
something like that, I think

[20-Jul-19 01:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
It’s all coming together for me now

[20-Jul-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```diff
apples = apples, bananas = bananas, apples not > than bananas or vice versa  because people don't live in reality
- people don't live in reality
+ in reality, some times people want banana pudding and some times people want an apple pie
```

[20-Jul-19 01:16 PM] richardt#2807
It makes more sense when you live in ComputerGenie's reality... so get there already, meatspoon!

[20-Jul-19 01:16 PM] meatspoon#7860
How did you get that footage of me?!

{Reactions}
😆 (2) 

[20-Jul-19 01:18 PM] meatspoon#7860
I imagine Genie’s day to day being like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas... but with dialogue that is waaay less witty.

[20-Jul-19 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but with dialogue that is waaay less witty.`
true, you do keep typing

[20-Jul-19 01:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
Zing!!

[20-Jul-19 01:21 PM] richardt#2807
I wonder if Genie has nightmares about BTC at night

[20-Jul-19 01:21 PM] richardt#2807
Or do dreams exist in his reality?

[20-Jul-19 01:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yeah, like it is pinning him down, slowly forcing its way inside him.  He awakens screaming and strangely erect.

{Reactions}
😓 

[20-Jul-19 01:27 PM] richardt#2807
So BTC is like Genie's prison rapist

[20-Jul-19 01:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yeah. He is forced to share a cell with BTC. He does not get top bunk.

[20-Jul-19 01:30 PM] Malti#3948
I miss the days that @siu - Chainmakers posts a lot of charts and occasionally @Hollowman9000 advertises his paid group instead of all this fighting

[20-Jul-19 01:31 PM] richardt#2807
We're not fighting.  I apologize if it seems that way

[20-Jul-19 01:32 PM] richardt#2807
Just trying to envision Genie's reality, that's all

[20-Jul-19 01:34 PM] Malti#3948
I used to try to do the same with other people in here, doesn’t work. I like genie in his own unique way :abusedsmily:

[20-Jul-19 01:34 PM] Malti#3948
Other people can be blocked and then don’t be bothered 😉

[20-Jul-19 01:35 PM] richardt#2807
Guess I'm just a bit frustrated he hasn't been able to convince more people to dump BTC and get on-board KMD... I'll have to keep waiting I guess

[20-Jul-19 01:36 PM] meatspoon#7860
Sheesh, I was having fun.  Seemed like everyone was.  Comedically busting chops ain’t fighting.

[20-Jul-19 01:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
I get the arguments about why btc is not perfect. But isn’t it still waaay better than the USD in many ways?

[20-Jul-19 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
anyone that thinks that was "fighting" isn't ready for the interwebz and should definitely find their #safespace
