that will determine their target for this cycle.

[11-May-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
not saying they can achieve any target, but if they budget for it, maybe some crazy stuff is possible

$1,000 a month for preparing a camel vs. girlfrined expenses... that is some tight math

Binance scam is running rampant from email

[11-May-19 06:51 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Received an email" Good afternoon. Welcome to the official Binance support fund.

We inform you about the recent hack of our exchange. You have probably already seen in the news that the abomination managed to seize a small part of our company's assets.

In this regard, we work hard on our security and try to correct this incident. Currently, withdrawal and deposit of funds is unavailable, it will not last long, most likely it will take less than a month.

We give you tremendous regrets and, as compensation, our foundation allocates to all users and holders. 5 BNB coins as compensation for any inconvenience.

To register for a pass go to the official registration form."

[11-May-19 06:53 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
there have been rumors that Bitfinex is processing  USD withdrawals by opening Bank accounts with the client's ID in foreign countries. Someone posted a screenshot a few days ago of a bank transfer coming from an account with his name. Now a journalist of TheBlock says to have received other similar proofs in private. This is not going to end well

Here's me saying something similar at $10,000 in 2017. Was I wrong or right to call for caution $10,000 before the top? Depends on the time frame.

i guess we should talk about real "short squeezes".  
it builds up like a perpetual motion machine. 
the people who first get liquidated , forcing price up
will revenge trade and reshort and get blown out and so one
