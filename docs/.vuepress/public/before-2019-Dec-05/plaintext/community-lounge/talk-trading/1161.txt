KMD back to 2018 bear season low.  And this year's rektseason may not be over yet üò¨

[27-Sep-19 03:07 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
It's actually worse than the 2018 low. The USD price might be the same but at least in 2018 that 50 cents was 14k sats and not the 7k sats of today.

[27-Sep-19 03:18 AM] actionslacks#4072
I know, I cant believe it's down this far while everything else is mooning.

[27-Sep-19 03:19 AM] richardt#2807
Well, not everything went all the way down to 2018 lows either

[27-Sep-19 03:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
It's almost as if there's some kind of equation that predicts kmd's price performance relative to It's technical implementations.

[27-Sep-19 03:27 AM] richardt#2807
Yeah it's almost as if the better the tech, the less people are interested in it

[27-Sep-19 03:28 AM] richardt#2807
the more use cases, the less users there are

It is true that all the alts have gone down, but komodo has gone from 40 to 70 in coinmarketcap even with everything it is doing.

[27-Sep-19 08:18 AM] costa2439#3771
If I have a bad project, I would like to raise the price to get rid of it.  If I have a good project, I would like it to be cheap to accumulate.  maybe whales think like that

[27-Sep-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
how many new projects have arrived?

[27-Sep-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
and if 30 new projects arrive is rank 40 vs rank 70 directly comparable?

[27-Sep-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
also 40 has only been at the high end after big price increases, KMD has been 50 to 60 rank on a long term basis, even with hundreds of new projects arriving

[27-Sep-19 08:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I went through the top 50 mcap a month ago

[27-Sep-19 08:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
many projects that went from 10million mcap to 500 million on obscure exchagnes etc

@Cryptoon creating an arbitrary marketcap using fake volumes on inflated supply coins... it is not so hard

[27-Sep-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
i think there are some coins that are run by small exchanges, who then have the CEX that sets the price of the coin, which determines the marketcap. and it is mostly just entries in their own DB

[27-Sep-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so while CMC is indeed the top 100 list and has many projects that are real, it also has some projects that are not so real. look at the coins list, it has much less clutter. there we are around 40, but there are several new projects like theta, hypercash, etc.

[27-Sep-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
also, altcoin prices at BTC dominance of 70% doesnt leave a lot of room for all the other coins

[27-Sep-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to wait until the BTC dominance is below 50% to see how well KMD is doing in the market

coinmarketcap should list only projects with a minimum of running time, 2 or 3 years, not if they will have a filter for that

all I can say is that it seems the kmd team is  doing everything right

whitepaper doesnt even cover half of what it has actually delivered

[27-Sep-19 12:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Remember when Nano/Raiblocks went ballistic because it provided a solution to a big problem in the market at the time being quicker transactions, I foresee KMD being similar but in regards to when every CEX gets heavily KYC'd/regulated

SUPERNET

Total Coin Supply: 816,000

The SuperNET asset chain is both backed by financial assets that the Komodo team actively manages, and can also produce revenues for asset coin holders. The name SuperNET derives from the former name of the Komodo team; we no longer focus on this name. The following website shows a detailed and real-time analysis of the SuperNET financial holdings: SuperNET Portfolio Analysis

Any revenues generated by assets held in the SuperNET portfolio are distributed to the holders of the SuperNET asset coins. For instance, SuperNET holds a considerable number of DEX. During a payout from dex fees, the appropriate amount of revenue shares that would be transferred into the SuperNET portfolio are instead directly rerouted to the holders of the SuperNET asset coins.
