DP is a great exchange... it'd be nutz to lose it.

[05-Aug-19 04:09 PM] SHossain#0007
`DP is a great exchange...`

from what I understand DP is just hardforking their DP chain, but leaving the CEX as is.

[05-Aug-19 04:43 PM] Oszy#5734
no, they change the coin to a KMD assetchain, and separate the coin from the CEX. whole coin team is leaving the cex

[05-Aug-19 04:43 PM] Oszy#5734
read on their discord they may even change the name of the cex

[05-Aug-19 04:52 PM] CoinKing88#1540
KMD is the new stablecoin, very nicely stable @ 1 dollar üòÑ

[05-Aug-19 05:11 PM] Tek#5253
