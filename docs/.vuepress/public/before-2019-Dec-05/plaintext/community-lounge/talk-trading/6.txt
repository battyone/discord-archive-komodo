TIL if you "HODL" your #EOS for more than 3 years without moving the tokens around, you lose them. Per their "constitution": https://t.co/KSEi3WUe0P

Off to a great start. Like this Redditor, I've also learned today that getting an #EOS account isn't as simple as generating a public/private key pair. You need someone else with an existing account (and EOS tokens) to create an account for you. Yes, that's right.

Sup guys, this is the channel to discuss various coins?

[16-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Hegelian#0018
@grewalsatinder why are you bullish on BCH?

[16-Jun-18 02:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not bullish on BCH. üòÉ

[16-Jun-18 02:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm just a opportunist. skeptic.

[16-Jun-18 02:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
right now it's the opportunity to buy it cheap. if in case it goes high, I'll sell it.

[16-Jun-18 02:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
in case.

[16-Jun-18 02:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and mostly in long term they go high

[16-Jun-18 02:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[16-Jun-18 02:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
BCH is intended to add some feature-set which will not exactly be like BTC, and I'm all interested to see how that all folds out in future.

[16-Jun-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <tolken> been meditating on prices for a while now, how to convert between various ones, gettin better but its still a bit of a brain twister.

[16-Jun-18 02:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have no sides to pick in BTC vs BCH.

[16-Jun-18 02:53 PM] Hegelian#0018

ButtcoinSub4k, i think that they ask, just not in public.

[16-Jun-18 07:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It‚Äôll be just as ridiculous

[16-Jun-18 07:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But the fight through previous resistance will look like 2014-2016

[16-Jun-18 07:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Top of the next bull will be just as stupid

[16-Jun-18 07:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
