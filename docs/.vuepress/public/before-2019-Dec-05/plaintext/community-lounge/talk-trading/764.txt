Paper wallet

[14-Jun-19 08:13 AM] Hegelian#0018
What is best paper wallet method?

[14-Jun-19 08:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
No experience with paper wallets for btc myself

[14-Jun-19 08:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Something you can generate offline on a standalone computer would be ideal

[14-Jun-19 08:18 AM] jorian#4555
but Binance is opening a US division

[14-Jun-19 08:18 AM] jorian#4555
https://www.binance.us

[14-Jun-19 08:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah but probably will be 100% kyc enforced with complete transparency to the us govt?

[14-Jun-19 08:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Now I think you can still have some lower limits without kyc on binance, no?

yesterday I encountered one of the most bearish signals since long imo

[14-Jun-19 08:30 AM] Malti#3948
i was talking to a girl in a bar and we went on about bitcoin as a topic and she assumed i was rich

[14-Jun-19 08:30 AM] Malti#3948

Is the info on komodo on coinmarketcap correct? Less than $1 million daily volume?

@Malti why is that a bearish signal? i remember end of 2017 when practically everyone was talking about BTC

[14-Jun-19 08:36 AM] jorian#4555
that was bearish

[14-Jun-19 08:36 AM] Malti#3948
it was a joke ðŸ˜‰

[14-Jun-19 08:36 AM] jorian#4555
oh

[14-Jun-19 08:36 AM] jorian#4555
it's early still

[14-Jun-19 08:37 AM] Malti#3948
it's just funny that couple of months ago if you mention blokchain or crypto people were like "lol you must be poor now"

[14-Jun-19 08:37 AM] Malti#3948
and now it's changing hehe

[14-Jun-19 08:37 AM] Malti#3948
i mean if it works with dem ladiez, i'm a happy man hahah

[14-Jun-19 08:38 AM] jorian#4555
i helped some people set up a wallet 3 months ago. back then they were like: bitcoin, that's dead right? but then i convinced them now is the time to buy

[14-Jun-19 08:38 AM] jorian#4555
and now they're happy

[14-Jun-19 08:38 AM] Malti#3948
yes, have been doing that as well last couple of months

[14-Jun-19 08:39 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Right now, the funny thing about bitcoin is

[14-Jun-19 08:39 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
It's not going fast enough to fomo

[14-Jun-19 08:39 AM] jorian#4555
smart money flowing in

[14-Jun-19 08:39 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
But not slow enough to ignore it

[14-Jun-19 08:39 AM] Malti#3948
do we want pure fomo?

[14-Jun-19 08:40 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
So it's like

[14-Jun-19 08:40 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
We are watching it

[14-Jun-19 08:40 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
And people want it to be cheaper

[14-Jun-19 08:40 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
But it's not

[14-Jun-19 08:40 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
And it's not going fast enough to say I can't miss this

[14-Jun-19 08:40 AM] Malti#3948
i want it to be 10 cents and 1 mio at the same time

[14-Jun-19 08:40 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Like that grey area it's in

[14-Jun-19 08:41 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
So I'm excited XD

[14-Jun-19 08:41 AM] jorian#4555
ðŸ‘€

[14-Jun-19 08:41 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
But at the end of the day today is the cheapest day of bitcoin

[14-Jun-19 08:42 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Just like property

[14-Jun-19 08:42 AM] phm87#7395
(I deleted my msg, it was not cool)

[14-Jun-19 08:42 AM] jorian#4555
too many people expect it to go down

[14-Jun-19 08:42 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Very interesting

[14-Jun-19 08:42 AM] jorian#4555
well for you it was really cool

[14-Jun-19 08:43 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
It's behaving more and more like an inflation hedge right now

[14-Jun-19 08:43 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
It wasn't like this in 2014~2018

[14-Jun-19 08:43 AM] phm87#7395
At work, I am a Tester so I don't see bugs as a bad thing

[14-Jun-19 08:43 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
It was a ICO driven market but now it's a totally different thing

[14-Jun-19 08:45 AM] jorian#4555
if 2016-2017 was an ICO driven market, what will be driving next bull market? i don't see people waking up to the inflation thing

[14-Jun-19 08:45 AM] jorian#4555
gold might as well be a good replacement

[14-Jun-19 08:47 AM] phm87#7395
Pacte law in France allow to insurances to buy crypto

[14-Jun-19 08:47 AM] phm87#7395
It changed few weeks ago

[14-Jun-19 08:47 AM] phm87#7395
Facebookshitcoin will also attract ppl towards btc and crypto

[14-Jun-19 08:48 AM] jorian#4555
facebookshitcoin is bad but necessary

[14-Jun-19 08:49 AM] phm87#7395
No github no explorer. As bad as euro but without history politics and army

[14-Jun-19 08:50 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Gold takes too much work

[14-Jun-19 08:51 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
And too much middlemen trying to take their cut in the middle

[14-Jun-19 08:52 AM] phm87#7395
Gold production kill about 1000 ppl per year. 0 or 1 per year with btc mining

[14-Jun-19 08:52 AM] phm87#7395
Gold production pollutes a lot chemically also (mercury ?)

[14-Jun-19 12:11 PM] Caglio#3337
SINKING !

[14-Jun-19 12:12 PM] Caglio#3337
My advice, sell all, buy tommorow for 2-3 k satoshies less

[14-Jun-19 12:16 PM] Caglio#3337
@ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™ on the other hand, if you rob old Italian lady that came to visit your country during the summer, you can always sell gold

[14-Jun-19 12:47 PM] p.#1126
Hmmmm

100k wall turned 30

[14-Jun-19 01:04 PM] willofleo#7505
Binance just shot it self in the feet , the moment it became a physical company , U,S constitute a large portion of it volume

[14-Jun-19 01:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
weak to strong hands

[14-Jun-19 01:05 PM] willofleo#7505
if this is not a blessing for mm 2 dex I dont know what is

[14-Jun-19 01:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
binance using mm 2.0 would be better ðŸ˜›

[14-Jun-19 01:07 PM] willofleo#7505
Yes it is  very possible who knows given the legal possibilities it actually logical as mm.2 complies the whole bureaucratic jargon

[14-Jun-19 01:08 PM] willofleo#7505
my point of a billion dollar dex valuation still stands

[14-Jun-19 01:08 PM] willofleo#7505
so long as Dev dont mess up mm2 launch again ðŸ˜ƒ

[14-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Caglio#3337
told you, im back in

[14-Jun-19 03:13 PM] Markus#5464
Only bad thing i see about mm 2.0 is that it will be like a free gateway for hackers to wash their stolen crypto

[14-Jun-19 03:15 PM] bishop#9773
How is that any different than doing the same thing on a CEX w/o KYC

[14-Jun-19 03:16 PM] Markus#5464
cause a CEX can freeze funds

[14-Jun-19 03:16 PM] Markus#5464
and exchanges like Binance does that

[14-Jun-19 03:16 PM] bishop#9773
People that want to wash, use throw away accounts

[14-Jun-19 03:16 PM] bishop#9773
it's effortless to create new accounts on binance, use the 2 btc daily limit and move on

[14-Jun-19 03:17 PM] Markus#5464
account does not even matter

[14-Jun-19 03:17 PM] Markus#5464
they will track ur transactions

[14-Jun-19 03:17 PM] Markus#5464
and see that u deposit stolen funds

Bump 1 day until launch of komodo assetchain dex

It wouldn't be hard to imagine users allowing addresses to be blacklisted in mm

[14-Jun-19 03:19 PM] bishop#9773
to not deal with parties if need be

[14-Jun-19 03:20 PM] Markus#5464
how is that decentralized then

[14-Jun-19 03:20 PM] bishop#9773
because the users control whether or not they filter transactions from others

[14-Jun-19 03:20 PM] bishop#9773
it wouldn't be global blacklisting

[14-Jun-19 03:20 PM] Markus#5464
not everyone will do that or even know addresses of stolen funds

[14-Jun-19 03:21 PM] bishop#9773
just like a CEX is less likely to continue to follow broken down utxos from stolen funds after X number of hops over X period of time
