granted AWS probably runs a big percentage of the internet...

[22-Feb-19 11:28 PM] Gordon Freeman#4502
You are right. Then I need to reformulate. Will aws accept pirate soon, ARRR.😂

[22-Feb-19 11:30 PM] Gordon Freeman#4502
And jl777c, how does it feel to reveal such news after months and years of work?

[22-Feb-19 11:31 PM] jl777c#5810
dealing with these big companys there are so many restrictions about what you can say, when, etc.

[22-Feb-19 11:32 PM] Gordon Freeman#4502
Yeah, who does the communication part?

[22-Feb-19 11:32 PM] jl777c#5810
steve is the one

[22-Feb-19 11:33 PM] jl777c#5810
at least we are showing the komodo is a top crypto project, no just because china says so, but now AWS also

[22-Feb-19 11:34 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure the other AWS crypto at the same level, but i dont think any of them are an actual top 50 coin, they are mostly service providers from what I have seen. but it didnt look into all 5 of the others

[22-Feb-19 11:35 PM] jl777c#5810
not even sure there are 5 others

[22-Feb-19 11:35 PM] Markus#5464
which once are the others?

[22-Feb-19 11:35 PM] jl777c#5810
I just keep writing code and let the others deal with the marketing stuff, they are doing a fine job

[22-Feb-19 11:36 PM] Gordon Freeman#4502
SHossain, true that

[22-Feb-19 11:38 PM] Gordon Freeman#4502
jl777c, go on writing code. There is probably noone better out there.

[22-Feb-19 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
if you keep doing the same thing long enough, eventually you get to be halfway decent at it.

[22-Feb-19 11:43 PM] Gordon Freeman#4502
Yeah. Hope you still have fun doing it

[22-Feb-19 11:50 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[23-Feb-19 12:27 AM] Likewise#6767

[23-Feb-19 12:27 AM] Likewise#6767
lets see if we go anywhere.

[23-Feb-19 12:30 AM] Likewise#6767
daily candles dont look very promising

[23-Feb-19 12:34 AM] Likewise#6767
looking more and more like dead cat bounces

[23-Feb-19 12:46 AM] Markus#5464
yea we struggle crossing 24k, bounce back and forth around it

[23-Feb-19 12:47 AM] Markus#5464
lets see if we can close this week above 50ma on weekly

[23-Feb-19 12:49 AM] Likewise#6767
Volume has dried up, not a good sign, we will probably dick around this range again......tedious

[23-Feb-19 12:50 AM] Markus#5464
yea :/

[23-Feb-19 12:54 AM] Likewise#6767
progress 😉

[23-Feb-19 12:56 AM] Likewise#6767

[23-Feb-19 12:57 AM] Likewise#6767
Another weekend where my tradional market peers can take the piss out of me lol

[23-Feb-19 12:57 AM] Likewise#6767

[23-Feb-19 12:57 AM] Markus#5464

[23-Feb-19 12:57 AM] Likewise#6767
thanks will do

[23-Feb-19 09:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Dried volume during a pullback is a good thing

[23-Feb-19 09:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Dried volume on a pump is a bad thing

1D $BTC

next week should be a lot of fun

TA - E2E + A&E + mean reversion
FA - CME futs open, $ETH HF

Target = $4750-$5000
SL = $3600

R:R @ current price = 3
R:R @ $3700 = 8+

*E2E will likely wait for bullish TK cross, currently not the case

[23-Feb-19 03:45 PM] Caglio#3337
Yes

[23-Feb-19 03:45 PM] Caglio#3337
First you start with Komodo

[23-Feb-19 03:45 PM] Caglio#3337
Then you end up as a rich pimp

[23-Feb-19 03:46 PM] Caglio#3337

quess we going down to 22k, no support around 24k

[23-Feb-19 05:51 PM] yorklab#7270
Because of Bitcoin's big jump over $4,000 I suppose.

[23-Feb-19 06:02 PM] Markus#5464
yea thats a sweet jump i suppose, lets see where it leads

[23-Feb-19 06:03 PM] Markus#5464
will most likely get rejected by 21ma on weekly chart

[23-Feb-19 06:03 PM] Markus#5464

Im considering buying again after about a year of sitting the sidelines

[23-Feb-19 09:42 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Anyone know whats the best procedure to convert fiat to crypto for canadians these days?

[23-Feb-19 09:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
bittrex?

[23-Feb-19 09:42 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Oh yeah I guess they do direct USD now?

[23-Feb-19 09:43 PM] Sdunbar#5064
no more going through coinbase first?

[23-Feb-19 09:43 PM] Sdunbar#5064
ive really been out of this game for a long time so if im talking nonsense i apologize haha

[23-Feb-19 09:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you could go with cb, I just don't like their reporting practices (not sure how it impacts those in CA)

[23-Feb-19 09:44 PM] Sdunbar#5064
If i do that I'm guessing I'll get tagged with more fees overall right

[23-Feb-19 09:44 PM] Sdunbar#5064
buy there first then transferring

[23-Feb-19 09:45 PM] Sdunbar#5064
rather than just going more direct with bittrex?

[23-Feb-19 09:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at that pricepoint, the "double trade" fees would be nominal

[23-Feb-19 09:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, basically a coin toss if CA tax reporting isn't a factor

[23-Feb-19 09:48 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Fair enough

[23-Feb-19 09:49 PM] Sdunbar#5064
thanks for the information

👍🏽 

[23-Feb-19 09:49 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I told myself if KMD ever dropped to 0.25USD I was going to buy a lot

[23-Feb-19 09:49 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I don't think that will happen now

[23-Feb-19 09:49 PM] Sdunbar#5064
~0.50 was the bottom I now believe

[23-Feb-19 09:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is hoping for another bounce off 65 cents 🙏🏽_

[23-Feb-19 09:50 PM] yorklab#7270
For me, when I send money to Coinbase via ACH it takes about week but costs nothing. If you trade on Coinbase Pro and buy at the bid it also costs nothing.

[23-Feb-19 09:50 PM] Sdunbar#5064
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  seems unlikely to me now that market sentiment seems to have shifted a good deal again

[23-Feb-19 09:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's why I said hoping for and not planning on 😛

[23-Feb-19 09:51 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Does coinbase still accept credit card?

[23-Feb-19 09:51 PM] yorklab#7270
Yes

[23-Feb-19 09:52 PM] Sdunbar#5064
looks like that is the only method for canada actually

[23-Feb-19 09:52 PM] Sdunbar#5064
no bank transfer as far as i can see

[23-Feb-19 09:52 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Ok thanks for the info

[23-Feb-19 09:52 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I'm off for a while

[23-Feb-19 09:53 PM] Sdunbar#5064
will get it sorted out tonight

[23-Feb-19 09:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Sdunbar  gonetcoins.com is a Canadian company

[23-Feb-19 10:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Sdunbar for EU I think SEPA wiretransfer to kraken is free and within 1 business day

[23-Feb-19 10:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Then kraken -> binance or trex for kmd whichever has lowest fees

[23-Feb-19 10:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
For convenience: bitpanda probably fastest

[23-Feb-19 10:11 PM] Alright#0419
welcome back @Sdunbar

[23-Feb-19 10:59 PM] Vertigo#0439
I still have some $5 Komodo in my wallet lol

[23-Feb-19 11:00 PM] Vertigo#0439
I think I bought 10 for $50 back in the good ole days. (2017)

[23-Feb-19 11:02 PM] Vertigo#0439
Bitcoin was going to $1000000 they said

[23-Feb-19 11:02 PM] Vertigo#0439
Last chance they said.

[23-Feb-19 11:02 PM] Vertigo#0439
😂

[23-Feb-19 11:03 PM] Vertigo#0439
At least I don't have any $12 $13 Komodo sitting on my wallet.

[23-Feb-19 11:10 PM] Sdunbar#5064
@Alright thanks man
