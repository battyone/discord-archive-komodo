```Apple now has $245 billion cash on hand.

The total crypto market cap is $113 billion.

A single company can purchase every single coin and token in the entire marketplace. 

Twice!

Still think you are late to the party?``` Completely inaccurate about buying every single coin, twice over. I get where you are going with this though to put things into perspective.

[30-Jan-19 01:34 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah prices would sky rocket lol

[30-Jan-19 01:59 PM] KSanJuan#9608
WhaleBro has been brilliant about filling its crypto bags... big orders but rarely chasing the order book..first seen back on September 2nd and still accumulating.

15 days later, the Cryptopia hack continues
After going dormant for many days following the $16 million heist, the Cryptopia hackers started up again today, siphoning an additional 1,675 ETH (worth about $180k at today's rates).

`Think i hurt his feelings`
I never have to worry about that because he uses "monetize my narcissism" mode and I don't follow douche's so I never see his shit

[30-Jan-19 02:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
*The hacker has the private keys and can withdraw funds from any Cryptopia wallet at will.*

[30-Jan-19 02:08 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
"monetize my narcissism" 🤣 👍

[30-Jan-19 02:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
how the fuck is that even possible

[30-Jan-19 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
#rootAccess

[30-Jan-19 02:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
they stole the private keys, and deleted Cryptopia's copy

[30-Jan-19 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
which means, the authorities can put all the servers in a jail cell and nuke it from orbit, doesn't matter

[30-Jan-19 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
they are just going to drain funds until the end of time , or those wallets get abandoned

[30-Jan-19 02:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
probably no offsite, no paper backups, and attacker deleted cryptopia's network-accesible backups

[30-Jan-19 02:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
why would they keep the keys network accessible anyway?

[30-Jan-19 02:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Cold wallets the same?

[30-Jan-19 02:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It seems only ETH coins are affected though?

[30-Jan-19 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm guessing that is just guessing

[30-Jan-19 02:30 PM] Tek#5253
hey frens

[30-Jan-19 02:32 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Hey Tek

[30-Jan-19 02:34 PM] Tek#5253
I've put some restrictions on my computering time

[30-Jan-19 02:34 PM] Tek#5253
this way I actually get shit done 😄

[30-Jan-19 02:35 PM] Tek#5253
also seems to benifit my eyes

[30-Jan-19 02:35 PM] Tek#5253
screens hurt my eyes

[30-Jan-19 02:38 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
lol I need to do this also, but working from home not much choice

[30-Jan-19 03:07 PM] Tek#5253
I've switched jobs to something where I'm not infront of a computer all day

[30-Jan-19 03:08 PM] Tek#5253
used to be a programmer / devops engineer

[30-Jan-19 03:08 PM] Tek#5253
but I get way to stressed, mentally fatigued watching a computer all day.  So I'm moving to some other industry and going into management

[30-Jan-19 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ewwww

[30-Jan-19 03:20 PM] Tek#5253
its gonna be great bro

[30-Jan-19 03:20 PM] Tek#5253
instead of doing the hard work myself I just delegate and see that work is being done

[30-Jan-19 03:21 PM] Tek#5253
I'm gonna be a project manager and quality engineer

[30-Jan-19 03:21 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I went from engineer to middle management - i never knew how needy engineers are form this side 🤣

[30-Jan-19 03:21 PM] Tek#5253
interesting, are you still in IT? I'm moving into (green) eneregy systems

[30-Jan-19 03:22 PM] Tek#5253
I'll be managing installment of solar panels and other stuff

[30-Jan-19 03:22 PM] Tek#5253
so maybe if i'm lucky I can strike a deal and get cheap solar panels, and set up a mining rig too

[30-Jan-19 03:23 PM] Tek#5253
not attached to the local net

[30-Jan-19 03:23 PM] Tek#5253

[30-Jan-19 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's exactly 0 part of me that would ever consider giving up sitting here, doing what I want, and most days not getting dressed until after noon for listening to shit from someone else because a 3rd someone didn't do something

[30-Jan-19 03:24 PM] Tek#5253
