Do you use that exchange @CHMEX KYC required?

[19-Jul-19 10:46 AM] CHMEX#0686
No I don't use that one. I believe there have KCY yes and some Asian Pirates have used it. I did not hear complains so far

[19-Jul-19 10:47 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Ok thanks, Just looking at 24hr turnover seems ok guess its bots tho tbh

They've temporary blocked social network news websites on last elections as I read in news

[19-Jul-19 11:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Porn and VPN providers websites blocked for many years already

[19-Jul-19 11:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, in Russia they blocked Linkedin for example lol

[19-Jul-19 11:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Because Linkedin doesn't accept to share users personal data with government

[19-Jul-19 11:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Now there is some law project of total russian internet isolation

[19-Jul-19 11:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Kinda as in China

[19-Jul-19 11:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Thats insane yeah

[19-Jul-19 11:59 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, but in overall people aren't much tech savvy here you know

[19-Jul-19 12:01 PM] TonyL#3577
I mean that not much people able to setup VPN or even know what is it/such possibility

@sasha35625 You are asking the 3rd time now and the answer is still the same. We dont want to increase income via shady short sighted ways which make twitter whiners happy. We simply want more transactions! Is it so hopeless that you dont even try the legit way? 
And yes ....

kinda like what china wants to do with hong kong

[19-Jul-19 12:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its more like US will just leave us alone and wont spend more time with us

[19-Jul-19 12:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but that could be the tip of the iceberg for all of the US debt to start crumbling down.

@Indie3k1 Staking is very important, this is the future of crypto economy. You need to enable people to make 5-10% legitimately on their crypo holdings, without risk.

[19-Jul-19 12:37 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Waves getting a 20% pump over adding the ability have dapps was laughable to me. Like welcome to 2017 Waves.

[19-Jul-19 12:40 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Now Sasha wants to add a 5% interest for holding Waves. I'm beginning to expect on who our whalebro is.

[19-Jul-19 12:47 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
If Sasha hadn't completely screwed me on his NXT assets, I might have actually cared about Waves to stay in it but I took the profit and never looked back. Glad I did.

[19-Jul-19 12:48 PM] CHMEX#0686
so maybe that 8m is some sort of coldstore?

[19-Jul-19 12:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
yeah i think so

[19-Jul-19 12:49 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
For a long time the wallet we thought was whalebro ended up being Binance cold storage. Could still be it.

[19-Jul-19 12:50 PM] hyperDEX#6586
They are holding it for whalebro üòÉ

[19-Jul-19 12:51 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
That could very well be the case. Prepare for moon pump and slowly sell off when it hits their target.

I sort of do hope that Sasha will pull (another) rabbit out of his hat, but I am not holding my breath... they are throwing an AMA in an hour or so
maybe they got Vitalik on the hook to do some wavy finger impressions or so

[19-Jul-19 01:20 PM] Neko#5830
