the latest iteration of barterDEX core and mobile GUI

[04-Jun-19 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the feedback i am seeing with the beta testers is mostly cosmetic, or extreme cases like "if the battery dies during a swap, when i charge it and turn it on the completed swap isnt shown automatically"

[04-Jun-19 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
also, i would imagine if you lose your phone after you start a trade, you wont see any confirmation either, or if you turn it off in the middle of a swap, it wont complete. basically things like that

[04-Jun-19 06:55 AM] 차미숙#8912
I wasn't too sure about dex era until now

[04-Jun-19 06:55 AM] 차미숙#8912
I was sure about dex hype though lol

[04-Jun-19 07:09 AM] jl777c#5810
it will take some time to ramp up usage, but once it starts getting traction, it is basically unstoppable

[04-Jun-19 07:10 AM] Tek#5253
fuck

[04-Jun-19 07:10 AM] Tek#5253
I could have profited whale bros pump but I didn't

[04-Jun-19 07:14 AM] Keppie#5156
Dompening on big brother Bitcone

[04-Jun-19 07:16 AM] Tek#5253
if it were truly the bull market

[04-Jun-19 07:16 AM] Tek#5253
now is the timme to buy

[04-Jun-19 07:16 AM] jorian#4555
shorts crossed longs again

[04-Jun-19 07:17 AM] Tek#5253
m thinking lower 7000

[04-Jun-19 07:17 AM] Tek#5253
but I doubt its going to go lower than that

[04-Jun-19 07:21 AM] 차미숙#8912
All it matters is you get rid of your fiat into property or crypto

[04-Jun-19 07:21 AM] 차미숙#8912
The price does not matter imo

[04-Jun-19 07:22 AM] Tek#5253
thats what im doing

[04-Jun-19 07:22 AM] Tek#5253
i got a year of savings left

[04-Jun-19 07:22 AM] Tek#5253
abouts

[04-Jun-19 07:22 AM] Tek#5253
im going all in by the next halving

[04-Jun-19 07:23 AM] Tek#5253
target is 7200 i think

[04-Jun-19 07:25 AM] Tek#5253
if this is a bullmarket, the btc dumps are done to make the bots sell the good alts more cheaply

[04-Jun-19 08:07 AM] Tek#5253
19k should break if BTC goes stable

[04-Jun-19 08:07 AM] Tek#5253
at 8k

[04-Jun-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
i think a medium term target of 6000 sats is not unrealistic. if it gets past that, then who knows how far it would go, relatively small supply still

[04-Jun-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
for VRSC

[04-Jun-19 08:56 AM] Mische#6695
What about K64?

[04-Jun-19 09:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I have a small vrsc bag, been performing nicely the past month

[04-Jun-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
still early for K64. VRSC is testing their pbaas now

[04-Jun-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
biggest ROI is buying in right as things change significantly

[04-Jun-19 09:10 AM] Cryptoon#3362
wish I had bigger balls and bought more at the absolute bottom a month ago 😦

[04-Jun-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
like PIRATE with the halvening and CMC listing

[04-Jun-19 09:25 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Cryptoon still waiting on a dm back 😛

[04-Jun-19 09:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
from whom?

[04-Jun-19 09:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
me?

[04-Jun-19 09:30 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
yes

[04-Jun-19 10:00 AM] Tek#5253
its not time to sell kmd right? @jl777c ?

[04-Jun-19 10:00 AM] Tek#5253
its buying time

[04-Jun-19 10:00 AM] Tek#5253
BUY BUY BUY

[04-Jun-19 10:00 AM] Tek#5253
sell after the june launch

[04-Jun-19 10:02 AM] 차미숙#8912
Why would you ask James for that

[04-Jun-19 10:02 AM] 차미숙#8912
That is like asking vitalik, is it time to sell ether

[04-Jun-19 10:02 AM] Keppie#5156
I think Vitalik would agree on selling Eth lol 😄

[04-Jun-19 10:02 AM] allbits#5898
@Tek is constantly badgering jl777 by tagging him for silly questions

[04-Jun-19 10:03 AM] Tek#5253
> constantly

[04-Jun-19 10:03 AM] allbits#5898
yes

[04-Jun-19 10:03 AM] Tek#5253
well vitalik gave away a lot of millions of ETH

[04-Jun-19 10:03 AM] Tek#5253
I bet he knows when to buy and sell

[04-Jun-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
if you feel KMD has reached its full valuation, then sell

[04-Jun-19 10:03 AM] Tek#5253
I honestly believe now is time for collecting

[04-Jun-19 10:03 AM] Tek#5253
whalebro is collecting

[04-Jun-19 10:04 AM] 차미숙#8912
No one knows

[04-Jun-19 10:04 AM] 차미숙#8912
Even God is bag hodling

[04-Jun-19 10:04 AM] Tek#5253
jl can easily predict the pumps though

[04-Jun-19 10:04 AM] Tek#5253
if you are head of development you know whats going on

[04-Jun-19 10:07 AM] CHMEX#0686
i think the current kmd price shows you that this is not true

@jl777c that is how you do marketing 😄

[04-Jun-19 10:14 AM] 차미숙#8912
Like a woke up in a coma and ask the nurse how much is btc

[04-Jun-19 10:14 AM] 차미숙#8912
And the nurse does not know what btc is and the only coin that exists is tron

[04-Jun-19 10:14 AM] 차미숙#8912

Lastly, very smart move for @justinsuntron, now the whole traditional financial industry has eyes on #crypto (and $TRX of course).  Who is this #crypto kid?  Kudos for pushing adoption, Justin! 👐👍👏
