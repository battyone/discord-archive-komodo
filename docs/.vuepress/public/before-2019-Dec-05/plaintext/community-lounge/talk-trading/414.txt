1319BTC Daily Volume

[13-Feb-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
volume picking up on trex USD

[13-Feb-19 08:44 PM] Matthias#2174
and given the higher volume/data points for BTCUSD, the proxy chart actually has more data so it ends up being much better for technical analysis

[13-Feb-19 08:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
short of physically having all 3, and having them all actively trading, USD/BTC/KMD is a false representative of USD/KMD
especially when markets diverge or return to equilibrium
There's less than 40% of the time where it's a valid calculation (this is doubly true when FUD or unicorns farting rainbow blows BTC/USD up or down)

[13-Feb-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
I used to convert all the currencies to virtualized aggregates and then used the ratio of those as the price

[13-Feb-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
that is not the usage

[13-Feb-19 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
the point is to be able to get as clean a signal out of the available time series data

[13-Feb-19 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to filter out the noise

[13-Feb-19 08:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the point is to be able to get as clean a signal out of the available time series data`
yes, but the reality is that like 2 in 10k people actually do that 😣

[13-Feb-19 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
but with everything moving relative to everything else, noise can be very subjective

[13-Feb-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess maybe i am one and maybe mattias is the other?

[13-Feb-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
@Matthias i found for forex, basically eliminating all the arbitrage noise, ended up with the cleanest signals

[13-Feb-19 08:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i guess maybe i am one and maybe mattias is the other?`
well, using a singular source (or at least implied as though), I wouldn't think the latter

[13-Feb-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
any single contract was significantly noisier than the ratio of two abstractions of currencies

[13-Feb-19 08:52 PM] Matthias#2174
To your point @jl777c , /BTC pairs tend to have more noise compared to /USD pairs and even proxy /USD.

[13-Feb-19 08:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the real mindfek is the realization that if USD/BTC/KMD is a valid representation of USD/KMD, then I'm even more right about the lack of value for BTC in the equation and the rock just needs to die 🙂

[13-Feb-19 08:55 PM] Matthias#2174
I honestly don't see the issue with that. The fact that you cannot immediately sell KMD for USD at the price provided by the proxy chart, doesn't make the chart invalid or unreliable.

[13-Feb-19 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
price is not a fixed point anyway, it is more like a wave function

[13-Feb-19 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
different probability of being different price at any moment in time

[13-Feb-19 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
lower and lower probability the further out you go, but this is why sometimes you see flash crashes and fat fingers

[13-Feb-19 08:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`The fact that you cannot immediately sell KMD for USD at the price provided by the proxy chart, doesn't make the chart invalid or unreliable.`
Actually, it means exactly that
If chart Y says that CoinX has the USD value of $1 and CoinX actually has more or less buying power than $1 then the chart is factually and measurably inaccurate

[13-Feb-19 08:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
people tend to forget that CoinX is a currency

[13-Feb-19 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if the charts purpose is to extract the signal with least noise, then it is quite valid.

[13-Feb-19 09:06 PM] Matthias#2174
Depends what you want to do with the chart. Since they tend to be more reliable than /BTC pairs, I will stick with that.

[13-Feb-19 09:13 PM] Alecandro#1179
here's another interesting note on volumes on binance. 2 days into this weekly candle and already we're close to making the largest weekly volume candle since KMD has been on binance

[13-Feb-19 09:14 PM] Alecandro#1179
Another "mere" 3.5M KMD volume on binance before monday would make largest volume weekly candle so far

[13-Feb-19 09:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if the charts purpose is to extract the signal with least noise, then it is quite valid.`
If it's done in that manner, then yes I agree

[13-Feb-19 09:28 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
the "noise" actually is also important part of the chart 😃

[13-Feb-19 09:29 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
time chart shows value changing in time - but you can use it to extract  avg  / mean value + fluctuations - both useful

[13-Feb-19 09:29 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
fluctuations I believe are useful for bot trades - if you know what are fluctuations you can set your buy at avg - fluct and sell at avg + fluct

{Reactions}
👆🏽 💯 

[13-Feb-19 09:30 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or so

[13-Feb-19 09:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆🏽 as a general rule, the only real use for pseudo value charts --- day traders

[13-Feb-19 09:51 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but only in theory - you can use such trading if market semi-stable - in reality market no so stable usually

[13-Feb-19 09:52 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
currently BTC seems pegged to 3.4-3.6k - before it was aroudn 6.5k - but who knows for how long it will be like that and which way it goes later ? if you know at least for how long it will be semi-stable - then you can play like that

[14-Feb-19 06:47 AM] wolfgang#3508
kmd up 10%

[14-Feb-19 06:48 AM] wolfgang#3508
thoughts on why it is so?

[14-Feb-19 06:56 AM] Alexfrog#1338
because it should be 100k+ sats, and its not, and its correcting a small amount of that imbalance

[14-Feb-19 06:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_still thinks the price of BTC should be measured in sats of KMD and not the other way round_

@wolfgang a lot of positive news and as usual a bunch of new tech coming out weekly

[14-Feb-19 07:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Rebrand around the corner

[14-Feb-19 07:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Partnership with communications agency

[14-Feb-19 07:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And for a project which arguably has the best tech in the cryptosphere, it’s a shame that we arent in the top 10/20

[14-Feb-19 07:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So its only long overdue

[14-Feb-19 07:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hell... if a shitcoin like ltc can pump 50% or whatever it was

[14-Feb-19 07:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd should be able to pump 5000% 😉

@Cryptoon  It doesn't work like that lol

[14-Feb-19 08:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Offcourse not

[14-Feb-19 08:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I was only partially serious

[14-Feb-19 08:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
People are always looking for reasons why coin x or y is pumping

[14-Feb-19 08:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But as history has shown there doesnt need to be one

[14-Feb-19 08:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Trading moves can be part of waves etc completely unrelated to FA news

[14-Feb-19 08:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If the kmd price would be fully correllated with tech coming out, we would have been #1 for the past year 😃

weird graph

[14-Feb-19 09:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
dont know that one

[14-Feb-19 09:14 AM] Mark81#4505
Its a inverted price of komodo. If you turn your phone upside down you'll be watching it normal.

[14-Feb-19 09:15 AM] linuxcaptain#2335
damp it to 0.0004 👌

[14-Feb-19 09:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Mark81 yeah noticed that, not really sure what the advantage is though :p

[14-Feb-19 09:21 AM] jorian#4555
it's better to turn it 90 degrees, and see that price follows a diagonal line with spikes left and right

[14-Feb-19 09:21 AM] Mark81#4505
Good point!

[14-Feb-19 09:27 AM] jorian#4555

Hi Gents, we are looking for few beta testers to test the speed of redeeming KSB in EUR USD and AUD
ideally 20 tests of $10 each
or equivalent
we will test in App after that (in a few weeks or so)

[14-Feb-19 12:39 PM] FabØ#8941
please contact me in DM if interested I will put a little group together for full transparency on timing and results
