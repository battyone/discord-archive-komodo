historically a very good chance to hit 35k sats, but actually very unlikely to hit 10k sats

[20-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Tek#5253
would that be th ATL of the past ~3 years

[20-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Tek#5253
10k?

[20-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Malti#3948
i love these discounts 35 days before the evolve campaing!

[20-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Top was 125k sats on safu

[20-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Tek#5253
last time they did a campaign it went up very hard so

[20-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Tek#5253
lets hope this time will be even better

[20-Jun-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it hit 6k sats for a brief time

[20-Jun-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
way in the early days before binance

[20-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
All time low was in the hundreds of satoshis

[20-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Tek#5253
should I set a buy order at 6k incase a whale market dumps 2k BTC worth of KMD

[20-Jun-19 12:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That would take an incredible coincidence

[20-Jun-19 12:27 PM] Tek#5253
flash crashes happen a lot tbh

[20-Jun-19 12:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Wealthy enough to have that amount of KMD and a big enough dumbass to dump to that level instantly

[20-Jun-19 12:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Doubtful

[20-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Tek#5253
i've put a buy order at 7777 sats

[20-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Tek#5253
i don't think it will hit

[20-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Tek#5253
but maybe if bitcoin moons panic will ensure

[20-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Tek#5253
and it could happen

[20-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
BTC goes to $50k maybe

[20-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Tek#5253
if btc goes 2x then KMD will dump 2x

[20-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Tek#5253
so 20k is enough

[20-Jun-19 12:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I would not bet against KMD when it takes off

[20-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sell volumes are always small during those BTC rise dumps

[20-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Tek#5253
thats true

[20-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Tek#5253
however without whalebro it wouldn't have come back up

[20-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Imagine being the tard that dumps at those levels

[20-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
BTC stabilizes and KMD resumes rise

[20-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You sold the bottom

[20-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Neck yourself

[20-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Tek#5253
KMD recently only had rizen because of whale bro pushing it up

[20-Jun-19 12:30 PM] hyperDEX#6586
How do you know whalebro is not the one dumping?

[20-Jun-19 12:30 PM] hyperDEX#6586
😄

[20-Jun-19 12:30 PM] p.#1126
And our delusional visions of grandeur of course

[20-Jun-19 12:30 PM] p.#1126
Dont forget that

[20-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Tek#5253
He had a buy order yesterday at 17k but removed it

[20-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Tek#5253
@hyperDEX he probably did sell too

[20-Jun-19 12:30 PM] p.#1126
Whalemanipulator

[20-Jun-19 12:30 PM] p.#1126
U mean

[20-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
HyperDEX is whalebro confirmed, and he’s dumping

[20-Jun-19 12:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Push up, push down make coin

[20-Jun-19 12:31 PM] Tek#5253
yeah true

[20-Jun-19 12:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont have enough for ramen hollowman 😦

[20-Jun-19 12:31 PM] p.#1126
Maker, good for him

[20-Jun-19 12:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
A supertanker of ramen

[20-Jun-19 12:31 PM] p.#1126
Guess 7k sats it is

[20-Jun-19 12:31 PM] p.#1126
Btc 15k

[20-Jun-19 12:32 PM] p.#1126
We all continue to have visions of 40k sats

[20-Jun-19 12:33 PM] Markus#5464
that 12k order at 15.8k is lower by 1 sats every few mins he is pushing down price 😄

[20-Jun-19 12:34 PM] p.#1126
:3040_kingpeepo:

[20-Jun-19 12:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
😃  like i said someone is pushing down and will push up later 😃

[20-Jun-19 12:34 PM] Markus#5464
no worries let him push down to my buy orders

[20-Jun-19 12:34 PM] Markus#5464
i approve

[20-Jun-19 12:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[20-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Markus#5464

[20-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Tek#5253

[20-Jun-19 12:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[20-Jun-19 12:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[20-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Tek#5253
lmao i put an order at 314 sats too

[20-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Tek#5253
incase it really flashcrashes

[20-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Tek#5253
it was the lowest order I could make on binance

[20-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Tek#5253
however there are even lower buy orders

[20-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Tek#5253
why can others make lower buy orders but I cant?

[20-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Tek#5253
theres a 200k buy order aat 3 sats

[20-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Tek#5253

Squeeze the balloon, surely the other part won’t inflate (DEXs)

[20-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I might cash out a tiny bit into fiat before i consider all centralized exits impassable

[20-Jun-19 01:23 PM] JimD#9272
When KMD to fiat atomic swap

[20-Jun-19 01:25 PM] gcharang#6833
```
KMD to fiat atomic swap
```
only possible approximate for now is stable coins

for true fiat atomic swaps, nation states will have to embrace actual cryptocurrencies as their state currencies
