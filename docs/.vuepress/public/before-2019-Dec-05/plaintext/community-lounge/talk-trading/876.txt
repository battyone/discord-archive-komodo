When people keep saying that most $ALTS won't survive

That many $ALTS are going to zero

That we'll never, ever see an Altseason again

This is exactly the moment in Crypto that you want find yourself in

The k64 event was really well produced. I dont think it was a brownsheet production event

btc not doing shit and kmd is going down

[30-Jun-19 09:59 AM] Markus#5464
then btc start going up again and kmd falls even more

[30-Jun-19 09:59 AM] Markus#5464
this market :PeepoThink:

[30-Jun-19 10:01 AM] Markus#5464
Also kmd would never get added on bitmex, enough if someone market buys for 2000$ and its up like 3%, go 100x long and u made 300% in 1 min

dPoW required for nSPV

[30-Jun-19 11:29 AM] Oszy#5734
prepare yourselves üöÄ

[30-Jun-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
any chain that wants to scale up to a lot of users will need superlight clients

[30-Jun-19 11:31 AM] Oszy#5734
could this work on Z?

[30-Jun-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
it could work to validate that utxo is valid very efficiently, but the mechanics of signing ztx, that is a separate problem

[30-Jun-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
once the zsigning is solved for lite client, then the issue of verifying utxo can use nSPV

[30-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Oszy#5734
awesome.

[30-Jun-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
basically the problem of "given a txid, prove that it really was confirmed in the blockchain", the standard SPV node would need all blockheaders to make sure they all connect and match the longest chain

[30-Jun-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
nSPV just needs the blockheaders from the prior notarization to the next notarization, ie. about 10 headers per utxo

[30-Jun-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so instead of needed 2GB of headers for a million blocks, 20kb per utxo

[30-Jun-19 11:40 AM] Oszy#5734
yea that's a huge improvement

[30-Jun-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
even 100 utxos in a wallet would be 2MB of headers data

[30-Jun-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
and most wallets have 10 or less, a frequent rewards collection usually leads to a single utxo

[30-Jun-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so 20KB vs 2GB

[30-Jun-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
plus the normal txproofs ( a few kb)

[30-Jun-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
and there is no need to query N different nodes to make sure it is valid (statistically) as the notarization data cannot be faked

[30-Jun-19 11:41 AM] Oszy#5734
so a standard SPV right now uses 2GB of data to verify 1 tx?

[30-Jun-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
an SPV wallet (not electrum which is an API wallet) would need all the headers to independently validate any txid

[30-Jun-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
most would store it locally, so it is a onetime thing, but still that is a lot of data

[30-Jun-19 11:42 AM] Oszy#5734
oh i was mixin it up with electrum

[30-Jun-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
equihash coins have 2kb, bitcoin protocol is 80 bytes per header

[30-Jun-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it will essentially give electrum api wallet performance without any servers

[30-Jun-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
only for coins with dPoW

[30-Jun-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
the existing p2p network would be able to support hundreds of thousands, or even millions of nSPV clients

[30-Jun-19 11:46 AM] Oszy#5734
very good, grats for figuring it out ü§ù

[30-Jun-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
we still need to implement it, but since it is so simple, it wont require any major work on top of an existing SPV client

[30-Jun-19 11:47 AM] Oszy#5734
if someone can do it it's you :pirate:

[30-Jun-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
also, it actually requires a komodo ecosystem coin to work that is notarized, just notarization wont be enough as it requires additional daemon support

[30-Jun-19 11:48 AM] Oszy#5734
a new one or an existing one?

[30-Jun-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
what do you mean?

[30-Jun-19 11:49 AM] Oszy#5734
i mean each coin that wants to use nSPV will need a new second coin?

[30-Jun-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
no, no

[30-Jun-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
i mean a coin that just has dPoW is not enough

[30-Jun-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it would need to be a komodo runtime or sourcecode fork

[30-Jun-19 11:50 AM] Oszy#5734
ah okay clear

[30-Jun-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and if sourcecode fork would need the nSPV specific extensions

[30-Jun-19 11:50 AM] Oszy#5734
get it now üóí

[30-Jun-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the entire p2p network will be supporting all the nSPV nodes, with a bit more workload by the addressindex=1 spentindex=1 nodes

[30-Jun-19 11:51 AM] Oszy#5734
are there any coins with dPow now that are not komodo ecosystem coins?

[30-Jun-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, we have several, CHIPS, GAME, EMC2, and a few others

[30-Jun-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
different codebase that added dPoW

[30-Jun-19 11:52 AM] Oszy#5734
oh yes chips

[30-Jun-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess they can always add the nSPV extentions, but that is more work. runtime forks will get it automatically

[30-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Interesting that it needs dPoW for it to work

[30-Jun-19 12:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Any chain that is aiming for adoption and scalability while wanting lite wallets will need dpow

[30-Jun-19 12:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Seems like this alone would create a very strong usecase for KMD...

[30-Jun-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, 1000 chains wanting dPoW is not so crazy and if each buys 10k KMD so they cover annual notarization costs via the rewards...

[30-Jun-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a big if, but at least in the realm of possible, if we can get a lot of ecosystem projects

[30-Jun-19 12:07 PM] Markus#5464
What does this in the end mean? In what ways does it improve already existing spv

[30-Jun-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the difference between needing 2GB vs 20kb to 200kb?

[30-Jun-19 12:08 PM] Markus#5464
Alright

[30-Jun-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
getting notarized SPV security at API wallet speeds

[30-Jun-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
basically the best of both worlds

[30-Jun-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
both speed and security can be achieved. essentially nSPV node would be very very close security model as a full node would be

[30-Jun-19 12:10 PM] Markus#5464
Ok i see

[30-Jun-19 12:10 PM] Markus#5464
nice

[30-Jun-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
and this allows basically arbitrary scalability of the user base

[30-Jun-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
electrum wallets dont

[30-Jun-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
and it is a fully decentralized nSPV infrastructure that uses the existing full nodes

[30-Jun-19 12:12 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
The scalability is unheard of... with SPV the download size still grows as the chain grows. With nSPV the download size stays limited to last dPoW header plus subsequent headers....

[30-Jun-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
but enough people complain about the time it takes to sync the chain

[30-Jun-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so this allows people to sync to the latest notarized headers and know it is the mainchain, without needing any but a few headers

[30-Jun-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and yes the new address without any utxo, just needs that latest one or two notarizations to "sync up" to the mainchain

[30-Jun-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
a few seconds at most

[30-Jun-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
especially for a manychain universe, the time and resources it takes to be able to transact on the chain is an important metric

[30-Jun-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[30-Jun-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
for each utxo, you need the prior notarization and the following

[30-Jun-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
10 to 20 headers

[30-Jun-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
per utxo

[30-Jun-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[30-Jun-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
just the ones between notarizations of that utxo

[30-Jun-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
let us consider a utxo at height 1000005 and assume notarizations happened at 1000000 and 1000010
