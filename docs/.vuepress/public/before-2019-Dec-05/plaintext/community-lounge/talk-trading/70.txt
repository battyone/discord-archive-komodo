KMD noob question: in order to receive monthly rewards do I have to sign in to the wallet once a month, or have a transaction of 10+KMD per month?

[27-Jul-18 09:53 PM] CHMEX#0686
You have to send the complete balance to your self.
Once you login to agama there is a claim button which will do exactly that

[27-Jul-18 09:56 PM] shak3nbak3#2279
Thanks, but I've already been able to claim twice, but I thought I read somewhere that in order to keep receiving rewards that you have to have at least one transaction per month

[27-Jul-18 09:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
At least one per year

[27-Jul-18 09:57 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes that is correct in about 41 days you will have to claim it once a month. This change is activated with block 1m

[27-Jul-18 09:59 PM] CHMEX#0686 (pinned)
Rewards

Currently, the rewards mechanism will cap the amount of accrued rewards after 1 year. For example, if the coins sit in the same address for more than a full year, the amount of rewards will stop accruing at 5% total. This mechasism is being changed to cap the amount of accrued rewards after 1 month. This means in order to receive the maximum amount of rewards, a user must claim them at least once per month. This in turn, changes the amount of rewards to 5.1% per year.
This change is being made to encourage users to be active and use KMD more often.

[27-Jul-18 10:01 PM] shak3nbak3#2279
Thanks for the explanation!

[28-Jul-18 07:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362
talks about kmd?

[28-Jul-18 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
they probably just didnt notice as it was embedded in a graphic and got past their anti-KMD text filtering

[28-Jul-18 07:46 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
why they are anti- ? owners related to NXT or what ?

[28-Jul-18 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
if a project doesnt pay for placement, i think they filter out, how else to explain lack of KMD mentions

[28-Jul-18 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the sponsored articles are pure advertising, the non-sponsored still costs money

[28-Jul-18 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the market price action articles are not paid for

well that's the business of marketing - need to pay if want to be visible in the media. Alternative is to you some tricky ways of viral marketing. but for viral oyu need outstanding idea + outstanding execution + maybe even some luck while making some movie/add.

[28-Jul-18 08:24 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
media are not really free media - they live from adds

[28-Jul-18 08:25 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
alternative would be media living from donations - but somehow does not work that way

[28-Jul-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
living from ads is fine, but when 90% is paid placement it seems a bit wrong

[28-Jul-18 08:25 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
and sponsors also liek to impact messages

I agree it's wrong i nthe sense of false information / wrong education. And in my view marketing should have educational part very important.

[28-Jul-18 08:29 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
here I feel good point to sell my old propaganda - creating decentralized media/forum platform could give a chance to change that also and bring new possibilities and I find it one of most important challanges for internet nation as what we really discussed here is not media nor ads. It's information processing by masses of people. And current information processin is far from reality as we can see, also because tools missing so people can organize better way. Some tools are slowly being built by some teams, hope someone will do it right.

[28-Jul-18 09:05 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
not sure if it's worse being ignored or get misleading hit pieces like it happened to Waves
