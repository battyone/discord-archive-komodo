dash will be more secure than bitcoin

[25-Jun-19 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the market cost of ARRR represents that enough miners would take 2 cents today rather than $2 next week 🤷🏽

"XRP will become even more decentralized than even bitcoin is"
-some retarded youtubers

[25-Jun-19 12:05 PM] Malti#3948

i just want a nice financial cushion to stop striving for a career that I hate but will gain me good money and start doing what I love

[25-Jun-19 12:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
careers are over-rated

[25-Jun-19 12:08 PM] Malti#3948
like 99% of people I suppose :abusedsmily:

[25-Jun-19 12:08 PM] Malti#3948
yeah, but finding an idea to start a business is hard

[25-Jun-19 12:09 PM] Malti#3948
currently working on launching my first prodcut on a webshop, but that's for the experience, not for the money

[25-Jun-19 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
move out of the city, buy a nice cheap house in the country-side and turn it into a home, and you're set

[25-Jun-19 12:09 PM] Malti#3948
but for that you need around 200-500k$, no?

[25-Jun-19 12:10 PM] Malti#3948
how would I pay for my daily expenses?

[25-Jun-19 12:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've owned 14 houses in my life, none less than 2400 square feet, none ever cost more than $48k USD and none were ever on less than 0.66 acres of land

[25-Jun-19 12:12 PM] Malti#3948
damn

[25-Jun-19 12:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's all about what conveniences you want and what trade-offs you're willing to make

[25-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Malti#3948

[25-Jun-19 12:14 PM] Malti#3948

[25-Jun-19 12:14 PM] Malti#3948

[25-Jun-19 12:15 PM] Malti#3948

[25-Jun-19 12:15 PM] Malti#3948

[25-Jun-19 12:15 PM] Tek#5253

[25-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Keppie#5156
Anyway, there are deals in the south of Belgium. But you need to be willing to sacrifice a few things

[25-Jun-19 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`its not for sale`
It was in the "for sale" section, so I have no clue 🤷🏽

[25-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Malti#3948
haha no worries CG

[25-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Malti#3948

[25-Jun-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810

[25-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Tek#5253
I think so

[25-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Malti#3948

[25-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Tek#5253
OCCUPATION LIMITEE à 3 ANS.  > you can only stay for 3 years

[25-Jun-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810

[25-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Keppie#5156
Its wrong 😄

[25-Jun-19 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Anyway, there are deals in the south of Belgium. But you need to be willing to sacrifice a few things`
yeah, that's what I was getting at, there are places that are inconvenient that are multiples lower than urban and suburban areas in most places of the world

[25-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Keppie#5156
Anyway, we have a shithole capital according to Trump

[25-Jun-19 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I just assumed "deposit" was a "lost in translation" thing 🤷🏽

[25-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Tek#5253
Bouquet doesn't even translate

[25-Jun-19 12:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
3 year "deposit" seemed insane to me
