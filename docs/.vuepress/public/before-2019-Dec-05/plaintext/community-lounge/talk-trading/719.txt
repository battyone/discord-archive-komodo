No, pkr is time wasting extras. Simple is fine but copying ftp (company with checkered past) is not an ideal path to spread the word

@jl777c  what else will be activated to kmd chain hardfork?

[01-Jun-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
new notaries and all the CC that has been in development will be available from master branch for CC activated chains

[01-Jun-19 11:20 AM] Markus#5464
Will that mean that ledger will need forever to update kmd once again?

[01-Jun-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
i think the general rule that ledger takes forever for anything will survive intact

[01-Jun-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
but, the existing version could be forward compatible with the hardupdate if it is just following the longest chain. basically it wont see any chain as having been notarized, so as long as there is only the notarized chain, it could still work

[01-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Markus#5464

bull market is back

[01-Jun-19 11:39 AM] Markus#5464
bull market may be back but we will need a significant correction to reset NVT and weekly stochastic, never in bitcoin history have they stayed at this lvl without getting resetted so it would probably make ppl quite worried

[01-Jun-19 11:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I see perturbations in the 7th/12th derivative velocity index when cross-referenced with the integral volumes of each Elliot iteration.

We could go up or down.

The market doesn't "need to do anything"

[01-Jun-19 02:27 PM] PTYX#6840
@Hollowman9000 don't forget to account for the downward speed of dumpage.

[01-Jun-19 02:28 PM] klein#5233
I would "like" for BTC to consolidate

[01-Jun-19 02:28 PM] klein#5233
market does not care

[01-Jun-19 02:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@PTYX I counter that with integral analysis of Elliott iterations on relativistic Lorentz contractions

[01-Jun-19 02:30 PM] actionslacks#4072
I can 100% confirm that something will happen.

[01-Jun-19 02:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
