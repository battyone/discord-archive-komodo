[16-Aug-19 03:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User yeah, that is a common scam. People invite me to join their discord and then put a label on me to make it look like they have devs

[16-Aug-19 03:00 PM] dukeleto#7326

[16-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Caglio#3337

k64 was always fishy , think about it ,an acclaimed funding of 70 odd million ,  which is and still larger  (more than2x)  the market cap on MANA , which is quite a prolific blockchain game project , I was thinking why dont they just buy up that project for less than half the price so I assumed they where just stupid people with too much money.

[16-Aug-19 04:09 PM] PTYX#6840
70 M for a startup from a VC is high tier to say the least.

[16-Aug-19 04:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Someone DM me their discord please

[16-Aug-19 04:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[16-Aug-19 04:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Thx

[16-Aug-19 04:32 PM] dan.#2473
They could of said 4m from stranger x and no one would bat an eye and probably get away with it . That's plenty to make 1 good viable gaming product.

[16-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Caglio#3337
I got banned, but its ok

[16-Aug-19 04:34 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[16-Aug-19 04:36 PM] Caglio#3337
Threaten ?

[16-Aug-19 04:36 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
No way he was asking questions

[16-Aug-19 04:36 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
You belittle him tell him to sell lmao

[16-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah good idea, noone wants to buy for the price they scammed us

[16-Aug-19 04:37 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Well atleast alecandro dude was confident they have the funding

[16-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Caglio#3337

[16-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Caglio#3337

[16-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Caglio#3337

[16-Aug-19 04:38 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[16-Aug-19 04:39 PM] Caglio#3337

[16-Aug-19 04:39 PM] Caglio#3337
So I can party like an animal ‚ù§

[16-Aug-19 04:40 PM] Caglio#3337

[16-Aug-19 04:40 PM] Caglio#3337

[16-Aug-19 05:13 PM] debaas#3337
Was kinda expecting kmd to have bounced by now. The market is wrong!

[16-Aug-19 05:14 PM] Markus#5464
Patient is the key

[16-Aug-19 05:22 PM] Markus#5464

[16-Aug-19 05:51 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Damn bakkt already manipulating price before launching

[16-Aug-19 05:52 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Kinda expect the same that happened when future s were introduced

[16-Aug-19 05:52 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Rekting the market with shorts

[16-Aug-19 05:56 PM] debaas#3337
Always wonder who is selling at these prices. People who are so rekt they want to get out? Hardly believe these coins come from miners or stakers.

[16-Aug-19 05:56 PM] dan.#2473
people selling and buying on the way down mostly at this point

[16-Aug-19 05:57 PM] dan.#2473
these big moves are not bots

[16-Aug-19 06:01 PM] jspook16#3059
Bills gotta get paid

[16-Aug-19 06:09 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@debaas big traders and their bots

[16-Aug-19 06:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Buy wall 777 bounce sometimes to get people confident in it , people buy , withdraw wall , people sell , stop losses trigger , they panic , buy and repeat

[16-Aug-19 06:11 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Or simply they sell because think btc will moon more

[16-Aug-19 06:16 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Ofc it's bots  @dan. if he just wanted to buy he can buy small increments here , but he has the big ass wall 60k Komodo that when sold into too much automatically cancled order

[16-Aug-19 06:16 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Don't think they or he risk it just to get dumped upon

[16-Aug-19 06:17 PM] dan.#2473
no it was completely eaten, didnt remove it

[16-Aug-19 06:17 PM] dan.#2473

[16-Aug-19 06:19 PM] dan.#2473

[16-Aug-19 06:36 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Ah ok

[16-Aug-19 06:36 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
This is bullish

[16-Aug-19 06:37 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
But with this we have fallen out a little wedge

[16-Aug-19 07:26 PM] Markus#5464
well next destination = 0

[16-Aug-19 07:26 PM] Markus#5464
