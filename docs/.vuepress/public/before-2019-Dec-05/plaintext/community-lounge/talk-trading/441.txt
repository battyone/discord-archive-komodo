[25-Feb-19 01:06 AM] Markus#5464
kmd looking good tho

[25-Feb-19 01:07 AM] Likewise#6767
oh yes, that held up nicely during the BTC and other alts dump

[25-Feb-19 01:07 AM] Markus#5464
and we closed above 50ma on weekly chart

[25-Feb-19 01:08 AM] Likewise#6767
Yes I use a 60 hahah hence I tend not to pay to much attention to them

[25-Feb-19 01:08 AM] Markus#5464
hopefully we can get above 30k soon

[25-Feb-19 01:09 AM] Likewise#6767
With losing so much market cvap on BTC does tell us that we are far fron a bull run, far  from hard cash going in, if so we would see the opposite

[25-Feb-19 01:10 AM] Likewise#6767
The more derivatives BTC will get, the smaller the chances are for a decent 2017 run.

[25-Feb-19 01:10 AM] Likewise#6767
Futures just wont allow that to happen and short heavily at each resistance, so far it seems bears are way stronger then bulls.....

[25-Feb-19 01:11 AM] Likewise#6767
so......back to the beach it is I guess lol

[25-Feb-19 01:11 AM] Markus#5464
haha

[25-Feb-19 01:11 AM] Markus#5464
i quess the big players didnt accumulate enough

[25-Feb-19 01:12 AM] Likewise#6767
The way I see it is that big players shor the fuck out of it, if they would be buying we would see massive green candles.

[25-Feb-19 01:12 AM] Likewise#6767
sad but true

[25-Feb-19 01:12 AM] Markus#5464
but i think they buy it OTC

[25-Feb-19 01:12 AM] Markus#5464
so it wont affect price

[25-Feb-19 01:12 AM] Likewise#6767
that's the narrative being spelled yes.......

[25-Feb-19 01:13 AM] Likewise#6767
they'll hedge, buy in OTC, short on the futures market

[25-Feb-19 01:14 AM] Markus#5464
well i think we will wait yet another month or 2 before we will see potential bull market starting, kmd looking good considering what rest of market doing so it will be interesting to see what kmd will do when rest pump hard

[25-Feb-19 01:14 AM] Likewise#6767
buy as hodl, shoprt on futures market till they think we have seen enough bear.......their pockets are bigger then ours ðŸ˜‰

[25-Feb-19 01:15 AM] Markus#5464
well im quite comfortable in current market situation i keep accumulating more cheap kmd ðŸ˜„

[25-Feb-19 01:16 AM] Likewise#6767
sure, guess that was what the URA etf buyers thought ;).

[25-Feb-19 01:18 AM] Likewise#6767
have a look at that one........

[25-Feb-19 01:20 AM] Likewise#6767
downhill since inception and that is far from the only one. This is what is not good about ETF's and other derivatives that are not backed up. BTC could take a similar path if too many are not backed up by deliverable BTC. so many on twitter seem not to grasp that.

[25-Feb-19 01:20 AM] Markus#5464
well thats true

[25-Feb-19 01:22 AM] Likewise#6767
personally for BTC I'd be happy and selling if and when we hit 10K$. saved my ass in 2017 when all was yelling for 25 30K, I sold mine at 15K

[25-Feb-19 01:23 AM] Likewise#6767
have more trust in KMD then BTC to frank

[25-Feb-19 01:23 AM] Markus#5464
well it all depend of ur stack but seems like ur btc stack is quite huge so ofc even 10k then is extremely profitable

[25-Feb-19 01:24 AM] Likewise#6767
well yes, you need to buy enough so if an asset does a times 3 you made good money

[25-Feb-19 01:25 AM] Markus#5464
and whats ur thoughts of btc reaching 100k like bob loukas says is possible in his market cycle vid?

[25-Feb-19 01:25 AM] Likewise#6767
my swedish neighbour in thailand is laughing, thsi guys earns a good salary, back in 2017 when I started talking btc he was cynical eventually bought in, he bought 3 right away at 4K sold them at together with mine at 15K. My swedish neighbour is happy and wants more ;0

[25-Feb-19 01:26 AM] Likewise#6767
I think that the chance is always there but I tend to belive in steps, lets get a bull run going, take it to 5 6K 10K before talking 100K. step wise ðŸ˜‰

[25-Feb-19 01:27 AM] Likewise#6767
but sure I'll hodl some just in case in 2020 we are the dick eating MA from John

[25-Feb-19 01:27 AM] Markus#5464
yea ofc haha, even 30-50k next bull run is already a huge success if it would be like that

[25-Feb-19 01:28 AM] Markus#5464
haha John changed his opinion and prediction like 200 times already ðŸ˜„

[25-Feb-19 01:28 AM] Likewise#6767
yes I'd be happy and have mpore belive in 100K if we first breach hte 2017 high

[25-Feb-19 01:28 AM] Likewise#6767
my prediction staus the same, just have ti understand that I have hodl stash and trading stash

[25-Feb-19 01:29 AM] Markus#5464
do u trade kmd at all or just hodl to a certain price?

[25-Feb-19 01:31 AM] Likewise#6767
traded some to gain but not that often, much easier to buy hodl, TBH trading SPX500 and others is more fun and rewarding then crypto. the main goal for KMD is to hodl, then again nto sure where, as said if it reaches 8$ I'm out

[25-Feb-19 01:32 AM] Likewise#6767
I'd like to see 8 to 10$ , then again at 5$ I will be a very happy camper

[25-Feb-19 01:32 AM] Likewise#6767
as you get older you get more realistic ðŸ˜‰

[25-Feb-19 01:33 AM] Markus#5464
Yea well depends of ur stack also, if u got lets say 100k kmd then 8$ is already massive gain

[25-Feb-19 01:34 AM] Likewise#6767
yesterday had a fgriend on twitter telling me he has a 40$ target for KMD, how do they come to those numbers?? Lers make it ar ound 50$ lol

[25-Feb-19 01:34 AM] Markus#5464
well its very possible but lets begin with 5$ then 10$ ðŸ˜„

[25-Feb-19 01:34 AM] Likewise#6767
if there is one thing I learned about trading/investing........do it big, make your money, get out, go to the beach

[25-Feb-19 01:35 AM] Likewise#6767
indeed ðŸ˜‰

[25-Feb-19 01:35 AM] Likewise#6767
hence I'm here talking to you youngsters waiting for my last run ðŸ˜ƒ

[25-Feb-19 01:35 AM] Likewise#6767
hence why I'm getting impatient lol

[25-Feb-19 01:36 AM] Markus#5464
yea i wish i could do like that but im quite new to trading so havent had the time to gain bigger experience but so far im doing pretty good i think cause i never did a loosing trade

[25-Feb-19 01:37 AM] Likewise#6767
put 50K$ in a trading account, dont use the leverage they give you, just use times 4 or 5. If you know basic TA and global macro in depth you should be able to make good returns.

[25-Feb-19 01:38 AM] Markus#5464
so basically just basic TA and 5x leverages then risk is slim u get liquidated

[25-Feb-19 01:38 AM] Likewise#6767
choose your broker wisely, dont day trade lol dont overtade, dont revenge trade.

[25-Feb-19 01:38 AM] Likewise#6767
well no lol, basic TA but u do need to understand global macro well, at least that is how we trade. works for us.

[25-Feb-19 01:39 AM] Likewise#6767
hats off for guys who can daytrade and make consistent profits out of it. I cannto do it, I like my trades to growm and i add as the trend continues, gives for good for profits, all using good MM and RR

[25-Feb-19 01:40 AM] Markus#5464
well i traded kmd this past weeks and managed to catch very close to the tops and bottoms i quess thats not so bad

[25-Feb-19 01:40 AM] Likewise#6767
that is good, very good, means you got an eye for it.

[25-Feb-19 01:41 AM] Likewise#6767
but you have to ask yourself, if you need to make a living out of it. Can I do this constantly and be profitable. If the answer is yes go for it.

[25-Feb-19 01:42 AM] Markus#5464
well i see trading as freedom if u succeed in it cause then ur not forced to work for someone else if u dont want and ur profits are endless as long as u do it right

[25-Feb-19 01:42 AM] Likewise#6767
I'm sure if you know TA add some global macro, you can make more money trading oil futures or the SPX500, use that money to buy crypto.

[25-Feb-19 01:43 AM] Likewise#6767
I know, I havent stopped working at 36

[25-Feb-19 01:43 AM] Markus#5464
and u dont have a cap how much u earn each month

[25-Feb-19 01:43 AM] Likewise#6767
I take profits usually per quarter.

[25-Feb-19 01:44 AM] Likewise#6767
I stopped working at 36

[25-Feb-19 01:44 AM] Markus#5464
and well nobody will become wealthy working for someone else either, with trading u definitely can become

[25-Feb-19 01:44 AM] Likewise#6767
you can achieve financial freedom, that is the best feeling

[25-Feb-19 01:45 AM] Likewise#6767
but dont beleive the guys selling u lies, do nit start an account with 5K and overleverage, bound to go wrong.

[25-Feb-19 01:47 AM] Likewise#6767
a lot of guys lose like this. Much better seeking out a real trading/market education, open an account with 50 and be nimble on the leverage.

[25-Feb-19 01:47 AM] Likewise#6767
anyway that is just the way it worked for me.

[25-Feb-19 01:47 AM] Markus#5464
well i believe u

[25-Feb-19 01:47 AM] Markus#5464
and i appreciate ur words

[25-Feb-19 01:48 AM] Likewise#6767
yet I read many who do so much better then me. yet every time on twitter when we want to compaire results.....they have none ;). Well I like to tell you because in my beginning years I went through some of the mistakes and they were costly. So no need to make them, any questions if I know the answer  feel frree to ask

[25-Feb-19 01:49 AM] Markus#5464
Yea i have read alot about how ppl empty not 1 but even 2 savings accounts doing mistakes

[25-Feb-19 01:51 AM] Likewise#6767
indeed. Look at Anton Kreil free vids on youtube, lots of good materials. I did my courses with them, dont want to chill them because they are not the cheapest but among the better ones out there. You will see lots of interviews that are worth listening to, all hsi mentors are proven traders, not just "teachers" who have never made a profitable trade

[25-Feb-19 01:52 AM] Markus#5464
will check into that

[25-Feb-19 01:52 AM] Markus#5464
ofc quality content have its price, like everything else ðŸ˜„

[25-Feb-19 01:53 AM] Likewise#6767
indeed :). Or we can listen to John Mcafee lol

[25-Feb-19 01:53 AM] Likewise#6767
the dick line chart lol

[25-Feb-19 01:53 AM] Markus#5464
he is just shilling coins he own for his own good but ppl dont understand that haha

[25-Feb-19 01:54 AM] Likewise#6767
indeed, a scammy drunk nothing more

[25-Feb-19 01:55 AM] Likewise#6767
like yesterday some guy on tiwtter with 20K followers says; Peter Brandt said BTC will go to 67K.........Peterdidnt say that. Now not one except for my arrogant self, told the guy he should learn how t oread

[25-Feb-19 01:55 AM] Likewise#6767
That is the issue in crypto, full of wrong info spread by guys with an agenda or just because they are plain dumb.

[25-Feb-19 01:56 AM] Likewise#6767
annoying and gives teh whole show a bad taste

[25-Feb-19 01:56 AM] Markus#5464
Not only ppl doing that, also media spreading fud from time to time and ppl take it deadly serious

[25-Feb-19 01:56 AM] Likewise#6767
oh yeah sure

[25-Feb-19 01:56 AM] Likewise#6767
most people are sheep, sheep are not good traders ðŸ˜‰

[25-Feb-19 01:57 AM] Markus#5464
probably thats why they say 90% or whatever the percentage of traders go with losses

[25-Feb-19 01:57 AM] Likewise#6767
yep, as a trader you need to look at the world with a bit of a cynical view, need to question things.

[25-Feb-19 01:58 AM] Likewise#6767
hence us old guys are cynics yet a great quality to have especially in the land of crypto

[25-Feb-19 01:59 AM] Likewise#6767
if I had to put in 10K in each coin that I eve read  that was going to be the numero uno, damn lol O'd be flat broke with all them experts

[25-Feb-19 02:00 AM] Markus#5464
yea thats why always do ur own researsh, and to me kmd is the way to go in crypto and btc, dont see same quality in any other

[25-Feb-19 02:00 AM] Markus#5464
well btc is btc ðŸ˜„

[25-Feb-19 02:00 AM] Likewise#6767
One line from Anton I love about success. Your ATM card will tell you how succesful you are if the number looking back at you makes you happy.

[25-Feb-19 02:00 AM] Likewise#6767
true, why I own KMD ðŸ˜‰

[25-Feb-19 02:02 AM] Markus#5464
haha thats true tho with atm ^^

[25-Feb-19 02:02 AM] Likewise#6767
remember back in 2018, when all was yelling to buy the dip........strange that nobody was telling yous to sell........of course not they were selling ðŸ˜‰

[25-Feb-19 02:03 AM] Likewise#6767
I sold in 2017 when I started hearing about futures coming on the market, kinds knew that was going to be the end soon. My bet was righjt.

[25-Feb-19 02:04 AM] Markus#5464
whats ur bet on ETF's and all those bigger companies starting to offer crypto investments?

[25-Feb-19 02:05 AM] Likewise#6767
Well those with deliverable BTC should help the market, however the derivatives they are not good fpor price IMO.

[25-Feb-19 02:05 AM] Likewise#6767
the ones with no actual BTC back up is not good for price.

[25-Feb-19 02:05 AM] Likewise#6767
IMO

[25-Feb-19 02:06 AM] Markus#5464
yea i quess we will see hard to predict it might be totaly opposite but we will see ^^
