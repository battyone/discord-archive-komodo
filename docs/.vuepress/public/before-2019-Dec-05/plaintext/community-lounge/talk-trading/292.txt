[20-Nov-18 08:27 AM] PHBA2061#2530
is there anyone here who believes that cypherpunk is going to be a reality ?

[20-Nov-18 08:32 AM] Caglio#3337
@Cryptoon did u said opium ( :

[20-Nov-18 08:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Opium gets you high, hopium gives you hope ;p

[20-Nov-18 08:41 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
it's interesting USDT=0.95 USD

[20-Nov-18 08:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
arbitrage between usd and usdt cant happen fast enough

[20-Nov-18 08:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
whenever the dust settles it goes back to parity

[20-Nov-18 08:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I dont think this means anything other than people seeking refuge in usdt too fast

[20-Nov-18 08:45 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
if ever USDT collapses while being still popular = BTC and alsts pump heavy

[20-Nov-18 08:51 AM] LocoMB#8593
@Cryptoon  cool graph! do you have a version where the axis labelings are legible? I'd like to keep that for posterity!

[20-Nov-18 08:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I just got it straight from some crypto group on facebook, sorry mate üò¶

[20-Nov-18 08:52 AM] LocoMB#8593
nvm - just a gimmick anyway (I saved this version)

[20-Nov-18 08:52 AM] Caglio#3337
I wish I am not broke as fuck rn, would love to buy myself some more Komodos

[20-Nov-18 08:52 AM] Caglio#3337
But then I cant buy everything else I planned !

[20-Nov-18 08:52 AM] Caglio#3337
Maybe I should visit a casino ?

[20-Nov-18 08:53 AM] LocoMB#8593
ofc would be possible to go to some BTC data source and create it, but since I dont have the infrastructure for that running I'd blow a full day for this, so I'll have to live w/o it

[20-Nov-18 08:53 AM] Sdunbar#5064
I've got money but told myself I'd wait for 25 cents

[20-Nov-18 08:53 AM] Sdunbar#5064
although I only ever half expected to see that

[20-Nov-18 08:53 AM] Sdunbar#5064
seems more plausible now

[20-Nov-18 08:54 AM] Sdunbar#5064
25 cents I'll get in for quite a bit

[20-Nov-18 08:54 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Had no money back when I first said that though haha

[20-Nov-18 08:54 AM] Sdunbar#5064
but have some now

[20-Nov-18 08:54 AM] Caglio#3337
I actually think 30-40 will be possible also... we will see tho

[20-Nov-18 08:54 AM] Caglio#3337
I am still tilted I get into it on 6$

[20-Nov-18 08:54 AM] Sdunbar#5064
i got in originally all over the place

[20-Nov-18 08:55 AM] Sdunbar#5064
2.23 was the lowest back a year ago

[20-Nov-18 08:55 AM] Sdunbar#5064
and then as high as like 10?

[20-Nov-18 08:55 AM] Sdunbar#5064
somewhere around there

[20-Nov-18 08:55 AM] Caglio#3337
I see, my average is about 3$

[20-Nov-18 08:55 AM] Sdunbar#5064
I got lots for free during barterdex testing though and am forever thankful to JL for that since I was very broke at the time

[20-Nov-18 08:56 AM] Caglio#3337
This community is one of the best, people here are really friendly

[20-Nov-18 08:56 AM] Caglio#3337

[20-Nov-18 08:59 AM] FishyGuts#5085
üí™üêô

[20-Nov-18 08:59 AM] Sdunbar#5064

[20-Nov-18 09:00 AM] Caglio#3337
U were the only one that wasnt been there for personal gains, but actually shared it with others, I never actually subscribed for that, but enjoyed watching it

[20-Nov-18 09:00 AM] Caglio#3337
And wtf is this ( : a tip oO ?

[20-Nov-18 09:00 AM] Caglio#3337
*bows*

[20-Nov-18 09:00 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We‚Äôre in this together brother!    Don‚Äôt lose faith.

[20-Nov-18 09:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The tech will@find adoption.   Not today... not tomorrow.    But it will.   There is too many great applications for its use and too many smart people trying to make it happen.

[20-Nov-18 09:01 AM] Caglio#3337
Nah Im going to buy more on my paycheck, I used to be a degenerate gambler so its not that bad

[20-Nov-18 09:01 AM] Caglio#3337
I actually believe in the project, and I wont kill myself cos of losses

[20-Nov-18 09:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
üòÇ

[20-Nov-18 09:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
At least with crypto... when you lose, you still have coins. üòú

[20-Nov-18 09:02 AM] Caglio#3337
That is true

[20-Nov-18 09:02 AM] Caglio#3337
Btw I have a really big adoption plans for komodo after a rebranding

[20-Nov-18 09:03 AM] Caglio#3337
Marketing plans*

[20-Nov-18 09:03 AM] Caglio#3337
Would be more correct

[20-Nov-18 09:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I was coaxed into helping a project recently that buckled ‚Äî- I have 600k coins worth about $50. Lol.

[20-Nov-18 09:03 AM] Sdunbar#5064
I'm not in for more than I could afford (wasn't very much) so I'm okay too

[20-Nov-18 09:03 AM] Caglio#3337
@Sdunbar thing is

[20-Nov-18 09:03 AM] Caglio#3337
I am from a really poor country

[20-Nov-18 09:03 AM] Caglio#3337
Well its not that poor, but lets just say my paycheck is about 500$

[20-Nov-18 09:03 AM] Sdunbar#5064
$500 USD?

[20-Nov-18 09:03 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah

[20-Nov-18 09:04 AM] Caglio#3337
And I invested about 10 times that money

[20-Nov-18 09:04 AM] Caglio#3337
So its not a little money here

[20-Nov-18 09:04 AM] Caglio#3337
I mean specially cos it cut in like 5 times

[20-Nov-18 09:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
There have to be factors at play with your wages and economy that crypto could solve.

[20-Nov-18 09:04 AM] Sdunbar#5064
I only make about $650 USD per paycheck and I live in Canada, but I do only work 32 hours a week

[20-Nov-18 09:04 AM] Caglio#3337
I work 200 hours per month

[20-Nov-18 09:05 AM] Caglio#3337
which would be 50 hours weekly

[20-Nov-18 09:05 AM] Caglio#3337
Nightshifts also, holidays also

[20-Nov-18 09:05 AM] FishyGuts#5085
What is your native language?

[20-Nov-18 09:05 AM] Caglio#3337
Croatian

[20-Nov-18 09:05 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Damn, yeah that is tough

[20-Nov-18 09:05 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Seko

[20-Nov-18 09:05 AM] Sdunbar#5064
I work 32 hours buy choice because I value the 3 days off a week

[20-Nov-18 09:05 AM] Sdunbar#5064
more than I value having money haha

[20-Nov-18 09:05 AM] Sdunbar#5064
my job is basically unlimited overtime

[20-Nov-18 09:05 AM] Sdunbar#5064
and I take basically none

[20-Nov-18 09:06 AM] Caglio#3337
Well I am happy with my work, not with a paycheck, but I have a great work ( :

[20-Nov-18 09:06 AM] Caglio#3337
Anyway, a lot of people I know here, started to invest in crypto to solve our financial problems

[20-Nov-18 09:06 AM] Caglio#3337
So far everyone got burnt

[20-Nov-18 09:06 AM] Sdunbar#5064
yeah

[20-Nov-18 09:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Their time window is not long enough.

[20-Nov-18 09:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Be patient.

[20-Nov-18 09:07 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah but, our biggest problem

[20-Nov-18 09:07 AM] Caglio#3337
Was, we all were in money

[20-Nov-18 09:07 AM] Caglio#3337
I mean I had 30 litecoins that I bought at 80$ piece

[20-Nov-18 09:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The solution to more money NOW  is hard work.  Period.   The solution to more money later is investing wisely and patience.

[20-Nov-18 09:07 AM] Caglio#3337
and they were 300$ per piece

[20-Nov-18 09:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Ahhhh

[20-Nov-18 09:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Well

[20-Nov-18 09:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
You learned to take profits yes?   Next time?

[20-Nov-18 09:07 AM] Caglio#3337
Thats why I am being so mad at myself, I actually had really nice profit

[20-Nov-18 09:07 AM] Caglio#3337
Thing is

[20-Nov-18 09:07 AM] Caglio#3337
I would probably went out of LTC now if it hits 80

[20-Nov-18 09:08 AM] Sdunbar#5064
I was sitting at like 300% + on initial and didnt sell either

[20-Nov-18 09:08 AM] Caglio#3337
I used to love community, but lately I cant listen to them anymore

[20-Nov-18 09:08 AM] Sdunbar#5064
but my entire investment is not very high

[20-Nov-18 09:08 AM] Caglio#3337
And their whole bullshit
