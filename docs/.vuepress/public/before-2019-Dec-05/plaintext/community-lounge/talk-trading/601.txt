We changed the ‘c’ in ICO to an ‘e’ so it’s more better this time

[03-May-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
at least it is going up a bit after losing 75%

[03-May-19 08:25 PM] PHBA2061#2530
the problem is people took the risk and speculate into something they don't fully understand ...

[03-May-19 08:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I’d say they didn’t even partially understand

OCEAN protocol- wasn't that the one that was supposed to also make you breakfast and take the dog for a walk after telling you the stockmarket prices in advance?

why do all these people think they're entitled to a refund?

[03-May-19 08:35 PM] LocoMB#8593
its predictive powers told it that dog shit would be in high demand soon- so just keep stashing away those mutt droppings, gonna be a real fortune soon!

[03-May-19 08:38 PM] PHBA2061#2530

they raised 20 to 50 million and people expect instant returns? the big returns come from undersubscribed offerings, such big ones need to deliver big just for people to breakeven

[04-May-19 10:18 AM] Markus#5464
didnt someone say that top 78 wallets hold 95% of chips supply

[04-May-19 10:19 AM] Markus#5464
pretty centralized in my opinion

[04-May-19 10:20 AM] mrlynch#5735
```
centralized
adj.
Having things physically towards the center; consolidated or concentrated
adj.
Having power concentrated in a single, central authority
```

[04-May-19 10:21 AM] mrlynch#5735
78 is not centralized

[04-May-19 10:21 AM] Markus#5464
If Chips want to grow it means those 78 wallets holding 95% would need to sell their token/coins to increasse circulation of supply in other way nobody can use it cause theres not enough supply to be used
