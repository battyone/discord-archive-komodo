tx fees a side

[27-Jun-19 03:34 PM] tolken#2655
@meatspoon no gas fees are ridiculous and unacceptable.

[27-Jun-19 03:36 PM] tolken#2655
fees are one thing, but the global network fee on eth gets out of hand when there‚Äôs congestion.

[27-Jun-19 03:45 PM] tolken#2655
Imagine paying $5 every time you want to interact with a dapp. Let‚Äôs say it takes on average 3 interactions to use that dapp, and all you want to do with the dapp is check your balance and make a payment. Yeah, that‚Äôs what eth has been like.

[27-Jun-19 03:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôve found the reason for the dump
