And what is bitmex insurance

[01-Apr-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the percentage of each bet they take and put into a fund, for your protection

[01-Apr-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it is in addition to the normal fee

we can say that it pays off

[01-Apr-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
everytime someone is rekt the insurance fund gets to front run the bankruptcy closeout logic. dont see why it is needed as the bet is being bankrupted, but 20,000 BTC seems a good thing to have in pocket than not

[01-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How does that equal black swan event?

[01-Apr-19 04:31 PM] sœÜldat#8733
with that Bitmex can afford dPoW

[01-Apr-19 04:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That‚Äôs like

[01-Apr-19 04:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[01-Apr-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
you laugh, but it is only 7 years of PoP BTC tx

[01-Apr-19 04:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Hollowman9000 not really sure why that would equal or cause a black swan event, but thought it was interesting to see how big the insurance fund was

[01-Apr-19 04:34 PM] sœÜldat#8733
without volatility

[01-Apr-19 04:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Wonder if they cap it at some point and just start pocketing the surplus

[01-Apr-19 04:37 PM] Caglio#3337
When you look like this, its really better to be a trader

[01-Apr-19 04:37 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean this happened a million times, has price even once stick to the top ?

[01-Apr-19 04:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[01-Apr-19 04:38 PM] Caglio#3337

[01-Apr-19 04:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Coinbene skewing the cmc results because there it is trading at 0,93$

[01-Apr-19 04:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[01-Apr-19 04:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[01-Apr-19 04:39 PM] Caglio#3337
I see

[01-Apr-19 04:39 PM] Caglio#3337
Then its ok, not that bad at all

[01-Apr-19 04:39 PM] sœÜldat#8733
cmc averages the price according to all exchanges

[01-Apr-19 04:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Coinbene is 22,6k

[01-Apr-19 04:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[01-Apr-19 04:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think their bots suck

[01-Apr-19 04:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The only time the price matters is when you want to sell or buy üòÉ

[01-Apr-19 04:41 PM] Caglio#3337
I have coinbase app on phone

[01-Apr-19 04:41 PM] Caglio#3337
and agama

[01-Apr-19 04:41 PM] Caglio#3337
I saw in agama how my portfoilio went sick way down

[01-Apr-19 04:41 PM] Caglio#3337
so I checked into coinbase app üòÑ

[01-Apr-19 04:41 PM] Caglio#3337
cos I put komodo as an asset there

[01-Apr-19 04:41 PM] Caglio#3337
It showed really big spike towards

[01-Apr-19 04:41 PM] Caglio#3337
So I finally went on cmc

[01-Apr-19 04:41 PM] Caglio#3337
And seen almost 25k

[01-Apr-19 04:41 PM] Caglio#3337
which is like big drop, from 28 we had or almost 28 not sure

[01-Apr-19 04:42 PM] Caglio#3337
But if they are holding on binance its ok

[01-Apr-19 04:42 PM] Caglio#3337
I guess agama wallet takes info from cmc also

[01-Apr-19 04:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe y'all should just hang out at the beach and drink a bear, catch a few waves, instead of counting the grains of sand. Just sayin' üëº

[01-Apr-19 04:43 PM] Caglio#3337
Drink a bear ‚ù§

shexy 

[01-Apr-19 04:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
agama wallet is going to have some type of caching and lag and not be the same as hitting the API directly or looking directly at an exchange

[01-Apr-19 04:43 PM] sœÜldat#8733
something like 80% of traders have to base themselves on cmc

[01-Apr-19 04:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
CMC is asking me to donate to them to make their amazing reliable fair and balanced stats even better

[01-Apr-19 04:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
I thought I was in an alternate timeline

[01-Apr-19 04:44 PM] Caglio#3337
Hahaha

[01-Apr-19 04:44 PM] sœÜldat#8733
to donate what ?

[01-Apr-19 04:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
i know the bear market is over because randos are starting to come out of the woodwork asking for forks and airdrops and weird shite

[01-Apr-19 04:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
CMC has a popup to donate to their fucking scammy asses

[01-Apr-19 04:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
even tho they charge devs like me to access their API, which used to be free

[01-Apr-19 04:45 PM] sœÜldat#8733
they know where to find the best ones

[01-Apr-19 04:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
those who have the most to gain don't want the normals to know the bear market is over, gotta stock up

[01-Apr-19 04:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How often does their API update?

[01-Apr-19 04:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Can‚Äôt you work around that and scavenge from their website?

[01-Apr-19 04:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@pbca26 would know how often agama updates. I guess every 5 minutes or so

[01-Apr-19 04:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you hit any API too often you will burn CPU cycles constantly and maybe get rate-limited or banned. CMC might enforce that you wait X minutes/etc, i stopped using CMC

[01-Apr-19 04:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
coingecko has a free API

[01-Apr-19 04:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
coingecko.com /en/api

[01-Apr-19 04:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
those link previews are just too damn big

[01-Apr-19 04:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
There‚Äôs a meme for that

[01-Apr-19 04:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I know it

[01-Apr-19 04:49 PM] sœÜldat#8733
"there is one meme for all" God

[01-Apr-19 04:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Verus is a stablecoin

[01-Apr-19 04:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Hasn‚Äôt really budged

[01-Apr-19 05:03 PM] pbca26#5430
@dukeleto once a minute on atomicexplorer
agama syncs prices from atomicexplorer every 2 min
it's neither a trading app nor aims to have 100% accurate prices

[01-Apr-19 05:04 PM] pbca26#5430
so 2 mins seems fair in this case

[01-Apr-19 05:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
so worst case is 3 mins out of date with API, seems reasonble

[01-Apr-19 05:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
i had to slow stuff down to every 10 minutes with some wallets, for most that is fine

[01-Apr-19 05:05 PM] pbca26#5430
yes, i can make it request more frequent but then i'll have to move atomic to more powerful hw
don't really want to do that

[01-Apr-19 05:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Hollowman9000 if you could pamp vrsc that would be great, i am mining a ton of it. Current prices don't spark joy in me

[01-Apr-19 05:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Think vultr will terminate my account if I mine with an instance?

dunno about on free credit though üòõ

[01-Apr-19 05:18 PM] Alright#0419
I know google cloud will terminate the VPS if it's using free credit

[01-Apr-19 05:18 PM] Alright#0419
