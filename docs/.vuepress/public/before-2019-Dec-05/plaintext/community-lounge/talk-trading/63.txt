im having a hard time selling my Jumblr on BDEX for KMD. shows utxo 0 but my inventory shows i have utxo's. any suggestions?

[21-Jul-18 07:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sometimes takes a while to recognize them

[21-Jul-18 07:29 PM] c2k#4915
maybe, but just not working for me

[21-Jul-18 07:30 PM] c2k#4915
although i havent tried it yet im guessing it would be similar on hyperdex

[21-Jul-18 08:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Selling on hyper not possible as you cant keep up an order yourself

[21-Jul-18 08:41 PM] c2k#4915
can anyone tell me if JUMBLR is active on BDEX today?

[21-Jul-18 08:42 PM] c2k#4915
id like to sell ~10 for  KMD or PANGEA

[21-Jul-18 08:52 PM] jansako#3330
I have not been able t sell into the 'buy' orders that are on the orderbooks for weeks now. I suspect the bob's only have tiny UTXO's left on them, but even trying to sell 0.011 of an asset for 0.02 KMD does not work.  Regardless of what BarterDEX says about 'average UTXO size'.

[21-Jul-18 08:52 PM] jansako#3330
This goes for SN, DEX, JUMBLR, MSHARK, REVS, BOTS. Did not try the others.

[21-Jul-18 08:53 PM] jansako#3330
There are just no 'public' buyers, but you can sometimes get lucky and sell a bit if you have a bob order up.

[21-Jul-18 08:56 PM] jansako#3330
I am not buying them myself either, so this is not a complaint or criticism!

[21-Jul-18 09:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You can reset utxo by sending the entire balance to yourself

[21-Jul-18 09:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I saw some jumblr earlier, pretty sure jl has marketmakers for all of the assetchains running

[21-Jul-18 10:25 PM] jansako#3330
Yes, he does. Except they are not buying anything for quite a while now. Pretty sure those bobs got dumped on until their last komodoshi. Once they sell some of their inventory, I am sure the KMD will be available on the  buy side again.

[21-Jul-18 10:54 PM] bishop#9773
I haven't had any luck using BD 1.07 or higher... still rocking BD 1.06 and did a couple smaller swaps this morning

[21-Jul-18 11:36 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
@hyperDEX , there's a chance I'll be that Rust dev. I'm not up to speed yet, but if you have something for me to prefetch or just throw some thoughts around you know where to find me.

We need now to define of this is a new bull or just a corrective wave up

Turkish Lira will be the one to watch tomorrow

[23-Jul-18 11:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Turkish central bank needs to increase intrest rates, or we will see a serious weakening of the turkish lira

[23-Jul-18 11:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And +- 20billion in usd loans will be in danger of default

If turkey can afford F35 fighter jets from US and an air defence S400 from russia... they can pay back 20B .. no mercy

We need to confirm sustained price action above 20sma weekly

[23-Jul-18 12:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
