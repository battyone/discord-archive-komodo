[30-May-19 11:55 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

[30-May-19 11:55 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

[30-May-19 11:55 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

[31-May-19 12:00 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

very happy with the growth

[31-May-19 12:10 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I'm not happy with the cashout vs last bull, but anyone that hasn't averaged since then just really hasn't tried (imo)

[31-May-19 12:10 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

[31-May-19 12:48 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Good bit of dumping at 2k sats now

[31-May-19 12:48 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Former resistance is now the support

[31-May-19 12:49 AM] Vertigo#0439

Support ticket?

[31-May-19 12:52 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
They have a daily cap for unverified, did you max out?

[31-May-19 12:54 AM] Vertigo#0439
Ohhh

[31-May-19 12:54 AM] Vertigo#0439
Maybe

[31-May-19 12:55 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[31-May-19 12:55 AM] Vertigo#0439
No $250

[31-May-19 12:55 AM] Vertigo#0439

[31-May-19 12:55 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[31-May-19 03:43 AM] Markus#5464
not always good to be a perma bull in a uptrend

[31-May-19 04:24 AM] cipi#4502
lol, my Binance bot did over 18 BTC volume on KMD/BTC yesterday (30.05. UTC)
totally crazy

[31-May-19 04:28 AM] PTYX#6840
damn, did you scalp?

[31-May-19 04:40 AM] cipi#4502
you mean if i made a profit? sorry, no english native speaker here :-)
that is hard to say, since i can only see if it is a profit or not when i compare my balance at equal BTC->KMD prices...
normally it does make a small profit, big price changes that happen fast are not good for my profits though, that is clear
but i think i managed to make it more resilient to such big  price changes by simply adding more balance to my account, so that the script can buy (or sell) 10 times in a row without getting out of funds for the respective side
but profit is not my first intention anyway, i want to provide liquidity to BTC/KMD... and if that is possible without taking losses it is ok for me

[31-May-19 05:23 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Cipi is whalebro

[31-May-19 05:25 AM] Alexfrog#1338
confirmed

[31-May-19 05:25 AM] Alexfrog#1338
and he is also the bots

[31-May-19 05:29 AM] cipi#4502
lol.. i fear i am not whalebro, would love to be a whale though
btw, you don't need that much balance for a liquidity provider bot... i started with 2000 KMD and you can make couple of BTC volume a day (i think 1-5) with only 2000 KMD... in the meantime i increased it a bit

If bitcoin does not care about TA then idk why it hit target of 9100 before retracing

[31-May-19 09:46 AM] Markus#5464
It was what TA was telling

[31-May-19 09:49 AM] Markus#5464
Some ppl were hoping for 9600 cause that would be target of the ‚Äùbull flag‚Äù which was not even a bullflag

[31-May-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
correction to 3100!
