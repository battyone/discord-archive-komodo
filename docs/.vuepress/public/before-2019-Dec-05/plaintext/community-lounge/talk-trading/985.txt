The difference between the 2017 #altszn and the next one is that this new one won't just have whitepapers. Projects in the next #altszn will have products and users. 

They are still risky investments, but the industry is much healthier now.

All eyes on the Fed later today with the first rate cut in a decade - no fireworks expected if we get a 25bps cut. 

Consensus seems a little bearish into the event with calls for the top in equity markets & further upside in gold price.

Will watch if the Fed starts movin...

[31-Jul-19 03:33 PM] PHBA2061#2530

[31-Jul-19 03:39 PM] debaas#3337
most of the fiat went in at 60 cents

[31-Jul-19 03:39 PM] debaas#3337
so up in usd .. lol

[31-Jul-19 03:44 PM] coingirl87#6489
To be honest...kmd had a big rebrand with amazing stuff...but...since rebrand nothing Happened on market side...volume is lower than before...rank on cmc is lower than before and price is lower...people all the time say thats a good time to accumulate kmd but i think there are only kmd hodler...sometimes there is a small pump but thats only from our whalebro/sis . Kmd People/holder just hopping for next altcoin bullrun to sell all kmd. Its really sad because kmd has amazing tech but market is not interested in this...only interested in big coins top 20 and big player like facebook with scam tech

[31-Jul-19 03:45 PM] coingirl87#6489
I hope i am wrong but  i think komodo will never come back to ath

[31-Jul-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
in terms of USD you are wrong, i am confident of that

[31-Jul-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be it wont ever get back to ATH in satoshis, in the scenario where BTC is marching to 100k and beyond

[31-Jul-19 03:48 PM] debaas#3337
All altcoin volume is down alot lately

[31-Jul-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
in the long run, if KMD can just hold onto where it is now, that would be quite an achievement and equate to a large increase in USD

[31-Jul-19 03:48 PM] debaas#3337
yep

[31-Jul-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
what people keep forgetting is we get coins like the new bitfinex coin out of nowhere and all other coins drop a notch, sunnyking launches some new PoS coin, and all the coins below 40, drop a notch

[31-Jul-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
stablecoins gain a bunch of deposits and push down all the other coins

[31-Jul-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
etc.

[31-Jul-19 03:49 PM] debaas#3337
Also, when we see companies moving into blockchain and using antara, thats when we see bigger price movements i think. You first need adoption, then monitization of the coin.

[31-Jul-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[31-Jul-19 03:49 PM] debaas#3337
ANd that is not happening overnight

[31-Jul-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
we might well be in a period of consolidation for years

[31-Jul-19 03:49 PM] debaas#3337
Took BTC 10 years to finally been taking serious

[31-Jul-19 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the y word, not even the m word and certainly not the w word

[31-Jul-19 03:50 PM] designer#4893
at least for the next few years, it's unlikely that all the altcoins will see the ATH.

[31-Jul-19 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if you remember the dotcom bubble, after it burst, it took something like 5 years for the survivors to exceed their bubble highs. not sure of exact time

[31-Jul-19 03:50 PM] debaas#3337
The only coins you see pump now are pump n dumps, all the tradeogre coins, all basically useless stuff, getting pumped on low volume

[31-Jul-19 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
google was a fraction of yahoo

[31-Jul-19 03:50 PM] debaas#3337
yup

[31-Jul-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
over time google won the search wars and it is doing fine

[31-Jul-19 03:51 PM] debaas#3337
i remember switching to google, because it was what we nerds liked. yahoo was the market leader then

[31-Jul-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
yahoo had all the advertisers and the cashflow

[31-Jul-19 03:51 PM] debaas#3337
now i am paying them 500k a year to advertise my business ðŸ˜„

[31-Jul-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
investors valued it at multiple of google as google was for nerds

[31-Jul-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
and had no revenues

[31-Jul-19 03:52 PM] debaas#3337
yeah investors got fucked on yahoo lol

[31-Jul-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
unexpectedly in spite of all the yahoo marketing, it turns out people who are searching prefer search results than being marketed whatever yahoo had to market to them

[31-Jul-19 03:52 PM] debaas#3337
yup

[31-Jul-19 03:52 PM] allbits#5898
Could take years? Might never reach ath in satoshis? jl capitulation?? Time to buy!

[31-Jul-19 03:53 PM] debaas#3337
this is why i sticked to google at the time. it was just simply better, no bullshit. just 1 thing they offered, Search. and it worked

[31-Jul-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
so the "advantage" that yahoo had, its advertisers was really its downfall

[31-Jul-19 03:53 PM] debaas#3337
KMD will get there one day. Even if it takes another 10 years ðŸ˜ƒ

[31-Jul-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i have never been a moonboy, and i did qualify that the BTC march to 100k scenario could preclude a KMD satoshi ATH (15x now and 10x for BTC) so that is a 150x from here.

[31-Jul-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
actually put in those terms it doesnt seem impossible at all, so not saying it cant, just saying it might not

[31-Jul-19 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
all i know is that all the technical problems that blockchain faces have to be solved before it can scale and achieve mass market usage

[31-Jul-19 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
any project that is spending on marketing before they have all the tech solved will just end up badly

[31-Jul-19 03:56 PM] debaas#3337
I just hope to see businesses moving into blockchain and choose komodo. Value of the coin comes after

[31-Jul-19 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo is a multifaceted project not limited to any single area

[31-Jul-19 03:56 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
Does Antara have any businesses using it? I thought I remember talk on discord about companies being announced during the rebrand but I could be mistaken.

[31-Jul-19 03:56 PM] alen#3721
I wonna know that too

[31-Jul-19 03:56 PM] alen#3721
Is there a list

[31-Jul-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
why would the companies working on their projects in secret want to tell you?

[31-Jul-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
almost every day i see new people asking how to do this and that

[31-Jul-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
presumably some (or many) of them are from companies as most individuals really dont care about making some cutting edge blockchain

[31-Jul-19 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
who are they? they dont tell me (most of the time) maybe they tell the biz people under NDA, but again you wont see it in the public until it comes out and i think a lot of them are in the experiment with this blockchain thing, stage

[31-Jul-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
likely it will take a successful pilot project, a second iteration or even third

[31-Jul-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
all this takes money and antara saves companies a lot of money

[31-Jul-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
since companies like money, they should like antara

[31-Jul-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
but none of this is going to change the BTC dominance overnight and boost the KMD price to the moon

[31-Jul-19 04:01 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
True, I just remember it being discussed that companies using Antara would be disclosed in the rebrand. But that could have been some random person who said it in discord and not an official team member so figured Iâ€™d ask if anyone knew.

[31-Jul-19 04:01 PM] coingirl87#6489
@jl777c  i really like your calculation of 150x....i think i can say that it is the hope of all hodlers but at the moment nothing...really nothing speaks for it...

[31-Jul-19 04:01 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
KMD is clearly an active project that will survive to then next alt season.

[31-Jul-19 04:01 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
Easy money if you have patience

[31-Jul-19 04:02 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
To the* next alt season

[31-Jul-19 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
if the next alt season is about projects with actually working tech that can scale and solve the fundamental problems of crypto, then that should speak for itself. its not like people dont know about KMD, it is that we dont have a justinsun doing antics to pump the price all the time

[31-Jul-19 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
so KMD is boring

[31-Jul-19 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
just set it and forget it, collect the 5%, sell some only when you need the cash for whatever

[31-Jul-19 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
in time it will work out quite well

[31-Jul-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
trying to trade it short term.... you will need to wait for my trading AI to have any chance at making money consistently doing that

[31-Jul-19 04:04 PM] coingirl87#6489
Thats what i do all the time ðŸ˜…

[31-Jul-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
just stay calm. the altmarket is closed for the season

[31-Jul-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
come back in the winter maybe we get the dec/jan spike like we do sometimes. maybe BTC does something idiotic again, i hear they want to reduce blocksize to 400kb

[31-Jul-19 04:06 PM] Alecandro#1179
@jl777c so you think KMD has 150x USD chances?

[31-Jul-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly. at what probability and what timeframe, no idea.
