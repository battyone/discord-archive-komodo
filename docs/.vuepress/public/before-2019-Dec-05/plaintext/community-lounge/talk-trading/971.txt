@LocoMB 
it's like this
he read something on reddit posted by someone the *didn't* reddit and now believes that he knows wtf he's on about

[25-Jul-19 05:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you canot make a new pool`
That's, officially, the dumbest and most wrong thing you've typed yet

[25-Jul-19 05:58 PM] LocoMB#8593
indeed 🤣

[25-Jul-19 05:59 PM] LocoMB#8593
maybe it's the heatwave in Europe- I am sitting near the North Sea and even here it is hot ☀

[25-Jul-19 05:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ck just made a new pool last year and all you need to do to duplicate it is pull the git and slap some hash at it

[25-Jul-19 06:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
come to think of it. -I'll take a dip 🍹 🏖

Guess I need some education on this as well.  So hashrate is what secures the chain, but nodes are what validate it? (honest question)

`So hashrate is what secures the chain, but nodes are what validate it? `
yes

[25-Jul-19 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
all nodes validate that all blocks (and transactions in blocks) are valid

[25-Jul-19 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is invalid, it will reject it

[25-Jul-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
now with enough hashrate, you can reorg the chain and what was once valid can become invalid, and what was invalid can become valid

[25-Jul-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
hashrate mines the blocks, but it cannot mine illegal blocks

[25-Jul-19 06:02 PM] Tek#5253
i can't find where i got the 52 max pools form

[25-Jul-19 06:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but it cannot mine illegal blocks`
and for @Tek's edification, "illegal" is defined by....

[25-Jul-19 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
unfortunately, both of you are a little bit right and a little bit wrong, depending on the exact context

[25-Jul-19 06:03 PM] Tek#5253
all truths are but half truths. Kybalion.

[25-Jul-19 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
also 6 mining pools would be enough to 51% attack BTC

[25-Jul-19 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and given enough of a sustained 51% attack, can indeed censor or reorg the chain

[25-Jul-19 06:04 PM] Tek#5253
Yeah but if all the mining pools decide to reverse a transaction. its not actually a 51% attack

[25-Jul-19 06:04 PM] richardt#2807
I can see how that can be confusing.  So in other words, nodes decide which block is valid and hashrate solidifies it?

[25-Jul-19 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC uses only the longest chain rule

[25-Jul-19 06:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my point is that there isn't a context where consensus code declares blocks invalid and they are still valid (except on their own fork that's not recognized by the majority)

[25-Jul-19 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so whatever is the longest chain (as determined by hashrate) is valid

[25-Jul-19 06:04 PM] Tek#5253
there you go.

[25-Jul-19 06:05 PM] Tek#5253
any idea where I got the 52 max pools from? I can't find it

[25-Jul-19 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the point is that censoring a tx would become valid, but it cant invalidate a valid transaction

[25-Jul-19 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
so to censor permanently would require a permanent 51% censorship attack

[25-Jul-19 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
which is silly

`any idea where I got the 52 max pools from? I can't find it`
your imagination or the delusions of someone on reddit

[25-Jul-19 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
theoretically possible, but silly

[25-Jul-19 06:05 PM] Tek#5253
few months ago , the mining pools on BCH reversed a transaction.

[25-Jul-19 06:06 PM] Tek#5253
it wasnt a 51% attack

[25-Jul-19 06:06 PM] Tek#5253
as it was over 80% of hash that decided

[25-Jul-19 06:06 PM] Tek#5253
if not all hash

[25-Jul-19 06:06 PM] Tek#5253
that decided

[25-Jul-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
what they did was reorged the chain and SPENT the funds in the "correct" way

[25-Jul-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
due to the anybodycan spend rule, so it was a valid tx in the reorged chain

[25-Jul-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
once it is spent, you cant double spend it, as that would be illegal

[25-Jul-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
however it was a special case due to new rules going into effect for not protecting against the spend

[25-Jul-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
in legacy coin, they wont every make such changes

[25-Jul-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so you cant practically censor a tx forever

[25-Jul-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
eventually some miner will mine the "evil" tx, especially if it has a big txfee (bribery attack) and it gets confirmed

[25-Jul-19 06:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
reorging the reorged reorg with a reorg
👆🏽 that's actually happened on the German mark coin

[25-Jul-19 06:08 PM] Tek#5253
anyway, the word is the mining pools actually like BCH better and will drop BTC eventually. they just mine it right now cause its more profitable

[25-Jul-19 06:09 PM] Tek#5253
also, Jihan will dump bsv to $4

[25-Jul-19 06:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`also, Jihan will dump bsv to $4`
and where on reddit did you get that?

[25-Jul-19 06:10 PM] Tek#5253
I got it on memo.cash

[25-Jul-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
the miners will mine whatever coin has the most profits for most of the time, with a preference to BTC even if it is slightly less profitable

`I got it on memo.cash`
some random person with random motives posted some random thing on some random site, so it must be true

[25-Jul-19 06:12 PM] Tek#5253
its a rumor. but we'll see

[25-Jul-19 06:13 PM] richardt#2807
Speaking of reorgs and 51% attacks, does anybody still talk/care about the 51% on ETC at the beginning of this year?  Or did people buy into the whole "if it can't be 51% attacked, it's not decentralized"

[25-Jul-19 06:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`its a rumor. `
because all rumors about jihan and bm are true, right? 😛

[25-Jul-19 06:14 PM] Tek#5253
the previous rumours I have collected there all came true

[25-Jul-19 06:14 PM] Tek#5253
so maybe this one will too

[25-Jul-19 06:15 PM] Tek#5253
he does have a million bsv

[25-Jul-19 06:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because what businessman wouldn't dump rather than slowly taking 100x more?

[25-Jul-19 06:16 PM] Tek#5253
he'll do it because csw attacked BCH

[25-Jul-19 06:17 PM] Tek#5253
to end BSV

[25-Jul-19 06:17 PM] Tek#5253
its eliminating competition

[25-Jul-19 06:17 PM] Tek#5253
what business man wouldn't want to eliminate competition?

[25-Jul-19 06:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not "competition" when you hold 3 coins and make miners for all 3

and my mining farm too

[25-Jul-19 07:15 PM] Markus#5464
dumping BSV to 4$ would only result in some ppl getting their orders filled at those prices to make sweet gains when it goes back to 100$ instantly

[25-Jul-19 07:15 PM] Markus#5464
just like when waves flash crashed to 1 sats

[25-Jul-19 07:15 PM] Markus#5464
quick xxx gains for some ppl who had smart placed orders

the market has matured. arb bots are keeping prices relatively consistent across markets.

[25-Jul-19 10:28 PM] actionslacks#4072
the low hanging fruit gets picked very quickly now

[25-Jul-19 10:29 PM] richardt#2807
Forget pumps.  I'd like to see another big dip so I can buy more at cheap prices 😄

[25-Jul-19 10:32 PM] actionslacks#4072
the tension in the market is palpable. the number of eyeballs on these charts and bots pointed at exchange api's is probably much larger now than in 2017

[25-Jul-19 10:35 PM] richardt#2807
It's harder to day trade nowadays.  But the best results come from buying/selling while looking at the market as a whole anyway.

I really think $TRX is just gonna decay to oblivion. 

Justin's latest apology on weibo basically means he's terrified to promote Tron publicly now, plus he's already made off w/ hundreds of millions. If Tron must compete on tech and not hype, this will enter price discove...
