[10-Aug-19 03:03 PM] Caglio#3337
yeah, if others dont gain anything üòÑ

[10-Aug-19 03:03 PM] Buddz1993#5380
And I‚Äôm glad that development is being done backstage that‚Äôs why im not worried

[10-Aug-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it is like a big storm outside, i dont worry about the lawn

[10-Aug-19 03:03 PM] Caglio#3337

i still collect my monthly rewards, knowing that in the future it will be worth more than it is now

[10-Aug-19 03:04 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I‚Äôm glad you are like that  tbh

[10-Aug-19 03:04 PM] Caglio#3337
Well it can go only 80 cents under

[10-Aug-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, also almost have a 100% static html wallet without javascript, using nSPV

{Reactions}
labs 

[10-Aug-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
which seems impossible to do, but i autogenerate the static html inside the nspv executable

[10-Aug-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
so no JS and certainly no node.js

[10-Aug-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
only 2 external libs

[10-Aug-19 03:05 PM] Buddz1993#5380
As long as you guys can paid devs and everyone in your team to maintain the flow type happening it‚Äôs ok

[10-Aug-19 03:06 PM] Caglio#3337

We need the new emoji logo for kmd the old one is clearly outdated üòÉ

[10-Aug-19 03:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
Is there anything to stop other projects from "borrowing" KMD's solutions?

[10-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Caglio#3337
@meatspoon we can always nicely ask them

[10-Aug-19 03:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[10-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Caglio#3337
Hey @grewalsatinder you bad boy dev

[10-Aug-19 03:12 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, they changed color now, muh innovative

[10-Aug-19 03:12 PM] Buddz1993#5380
@Caglio I have seen projects pumping for less

[10-Aug-19 03:13 PM] Caglio#3337
We need John McAfee to tell us about new best coin out of top 1230

@Caglio üôÇ üëç

[10-Aug-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
@meatspoon you would need competent blockchain devs

[10-Aug-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
and a willingness to just copy, usually competent devs want to make their own variant, not just copy

[10-Aug-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
and the copy pasta devs... well, komodo code base is quite a complex beast and it wont end well if you are blindly copy pasting

[10-Aug-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly at the conceptual level things can be copied

[10-Aug-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
but to copy nSPV...

[10-Aug-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
you would need to enhance your daemon code to support it and start notarizing

[10-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
What if they don‚Äôt copy do something very similar and take credits for it ?

[10-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
What could we do to proof that we were the first to implement them ?

[10-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
If no one ever heard of them in the first place

[10-Aug-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
are they open source?

[10-Aug-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
or they just make a closed source copy? and deny they copied it?

[10-Aug-19 03:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Fair enough

[10-Aug-19 03:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380
We are open source so y

[10-Aug-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is possible, but after all these years, not many. we are doing thousands of commits per month. do you realize the amount of effort it takes to keep up with that?

[10-Aug-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
and a lot of the tech builds on having dPoW notarization

[10-Aug-19 03:19 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I don‚Äôt even imagine in the first place I was just making sure it couldn‚Äôt be done that easly

[10-Aug-19 03:20 PM] Buddz1993#5380
It would require them the tools and very hard work like you said in order to be done and that it‚Äôs something that can be proven time wasted if not done properly

[10-Aug-19 03:20 PM] Buddz1993#5380
And time wasted is money lost these days

[10-Aug-19 03:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
yeah, i guess I am thinking that some projects, like ETH, have so many devs and so much funding, if they see an idea they like, it seems like they could implement it faster than KMD can climb the rigged ladder into the top 10

[10-Aug-19 03:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
even if they said, "KMD had a nice solution for this so we are doing something similar"... that might shine some light on KMD, which would be nice, but....  I am not sure imitating a solution would cause a mass exodus of developers and projects

[10-Aug-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
well, the defense against ETH is that they would need to get rid of GAS

[10-Aug-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
but the entire ETH is built on GAS

[10-Aug-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
all the other platform projects are about locking themselves in, to create a barrier to leaving

[10-Aug-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so the rapid tech evolving makes it only possible to clone by an advanced dev team, which if they really are advanced would feel that they could do better from scratch

[10-Aug-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
the teams that could do it, all built systems with vendor lockin or centralization to varying degrees

[10-Aug-19 03:27 PM] meatspoon#7860
ok, i guess that makes decent sense

[10-Aug-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
and i doubt you could raise funding by saying "we will make a platform that doesnt have vendor lockin"

[10-Aug-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it really is a bit anti-business to do that

[10-Aug-19 03:27 PM] Markus#5464
Btw did u all know that Waves is the worst performing alt coin against btc in top 50?

[10-Aug-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
i know i swapped all of SuperNET WAVES at 4x and 2.4x KMD

[10-Aug-19 03:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
Too bad Epstein died this morning.  I was hoping he would use KMD to catalog his human trafficking empire.

[10-Aug-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
when i found out how they treated the long time NXT asset holders, i decided it was time to phase out

[10-Aug-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
STRAT is also a very sad story

[10-Aug-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
from being more than 10x KMD to now 0.5KMD, i should have divested more at the peak

[10-Aug-19 03:30 PM] Caglio#3337
How is equalizer performing ?

[10-Aug-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
is that a movie?

[10-Aug-19 03:31 PM] Caglio#3337
I thought thats a coin on kmd network

[10-Aug-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
i wouldnt expect justin to not use marketmakers

[10-Aug-19 03:33 PM] Markus#5464
is bittorrent not like the money printer for justin

[10-Aug-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
look for coins that have perfect TA cycles

[10-Aug-19 03:34 PM] Markus#5464
JL do u believe BTC is market made by Tether?

[10-Aug-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
odds are they have aggressive market makers

[10-Aug-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
tether is a small influence on BTC

[10-Aug-19 03:34 PM] Caglio#3337
I like that justin persona

[10-Aug-19 03:34 PM] Caglio#3337
How did he get so wealthy ?

[10-Aug-19 03:34 PM] Markus#5464
everytime Tether print new USDT btc seem to pump a while later

[10-Aug-19 03:35 PM] Caglio#3337
Is he involved with Triad ?

[10-Aug-19 03:35 PM] Markus#5464
justin is like best friend with CZ

[10-Aug-19 03:36 PM] Caglio#3337
Guy from binance ?

[10-Aug-19 03:36 PM] Markus#5464

[10-Aug-19 03:36 PM] Markus#5464
i mean pls bittorrent first days had volume of 20-30k btc daily

[10-Aug-19 03:36 PM] Markus#5464
after IEO

[10-Aug-19 03:36 PM] Markus#5464
thats far from legit

[10-Aug-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
market makers need to do 10x or more that the real volume to paint the TA picture they need

[10-Aug-19 03:37 PM] Markus#5464
pumped from 6 sats to 32 or so in few days

[10-Aug-19 03:37 PM] Markus#5464
look BTT now

[10-Aug-19 03:37 PM] Markus#5464
its 5 or 6 sats

[10-Aug-19 03:38 PM] Markus#5464
