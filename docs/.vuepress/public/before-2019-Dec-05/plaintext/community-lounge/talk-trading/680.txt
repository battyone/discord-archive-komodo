ATH was 0.169KMD

[25-May-19 05:14 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
.25 - .3 kmd after halving is possible + awesome roadmap 2.0

[25-May-19 05:14 AM] Alecandro#1179
I’d love that

[25-May-19 05:14 AM] Alecandro#1179
Let’s gooooooooooooooo

[25-May-19 05:19 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
top volume on DP , Graviex and Tradeogre

[25-May-19 05:19 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so the demand is there

[25-May-19 07:11 AM] BlockTech#6895
So short term 0,12KMD, mid term 0,08, long term : 1.00KMD :)

[25-May-19 07:16 AM] BlockTech#6895
Maybe with the CMC circulation supply updated (market cap) we will see some new traction. And a pump is probable soon. To much good news in a small time frame for ARRR 👌

[25-May-19 07:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@peddycb @Gordon Komodo eql plan sounded good, i have about 80k of them i think? Once dico was over, it became clear quite fast that they were just trying to pump/dump promising masternodes and whatnot

[25-May-19 07:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Then one of the founders stole a bunch of money (not putting it in multi sig adresses gg)

[25-May-19 07:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
They never really answered questions regarding team funds/presale amounts etc when someone was dumping huge amounts for a couple of sats each

[25-May-19 07:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And then the final months it just really bled out completely when a couple teammembers had family problems on top of all that, which is something you dont wish upon anyone offcourse

[25-May-19 09:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
I see, so eql is gone. I can say after lurking in that channel that there was a more clubhouse type feel with very little technical discussion.  Seemed like a noble mission. that fail sucks. condolences to all who took the haircut.

Just want to point out that after ~10 months of development, LABS has finally launched 😊  Right now it's in a "slow start" phase in which block rewards are tiny, it'll be this way for ~6 more days. It's 49/51 equihash POW/ pos64 POS with 20% of emissions split between notaries via a pay per notarization mechanism. 

For anyone that doesn't know what it is, it's the first coin to implement KMD's momom scaling tech. This allows us to be "one coin, many chains". It allows us to put CCs into production much easier than any single chain could. We can have a separate chain for each CC, meaning a hard fork in 1 CC will not affect any other chain. 

For now, it's all CLI based. Hoping to get it(the main chain) integrated into Agama by the end of the month. We'll have a listing on Barterlly sometime next week and a listing on Zaddex when it launches. 

The purpose of the coin is to incentivize testing of CCs. There is a mechanism in which 1% of weekly emissions can be claimed in bug bounties. You find a bug, make a claim, if >50% of notaries agree this claim is fair, it's paid out. Testing is not it's only usecase. We can implement CCs without hard forking our main chain. This allows anyone to write a CC and get it running on LABS relatively easily. 

Within the next 2 weeks or so, @TonyL will be running a prices CC test on LABS. This is good chance to learn CCs and komodo tech in general and be rewarded via the bounty mechanism. If anyone is interested in diving into blockchain development, LABS is the perfect place to get started 😃

100800/week indefinitely

[25-May-19 10:46 AM] Alright#0419
can be up to 101808/week though because of bounty mechanism

[25-May-19 10:46 AM] Alright#0419
bounty mechanism does not carry over week to week, if there isn't a claim, the coins just never come into existence

[25-May-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
about 5 mil per year emission

[25-May-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
in 20 years, will be 100 million

[25-May-19 11:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And should people want to have their cc or whatever tested they need to put up the bounty and buy LABS?

[25-May-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
LABS will be the currency to get the CC testing expertise

@Markus bittIRS should no longer be considered a legitimate exchange

[25-May-19 11:54 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
They’re irrelevant

[25-May-19 11:54 AM] Markus#5464
Pretty sad

[25-May-19 11:54 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Hempcoin should pursue real listings

[25-May-19 11:55 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Are they an ecosystem coin?

[25-May-19 11:55 AM] Markus#5464
idk if they are yet

[25-May-19 01:09 PM] Markus#5464
@jl777c Do u think bear market is over?

[25-May-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[25-May-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
i have said that since $4200+ breakout

[25-May-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
as that was the technical definition of the end of bear

[25-May-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
not saying we are in full bull market

[25-May-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
but we are not in bear anymore

[25-May-19 01:10 PM] Markus#5464
Isnt it abit worrying that we never created a higher low since 3.2k tho?

[25-May-19 01:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But tone and hyperwave says 1.3k dammit

[25-May-19 01:10 PM] p.#1126
11.5k is equilibrium to break that confirms bull

[25-May-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
so dreams of $1500 BTC are gone

[25-May-19 01:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
😦

[25-May-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
why does the price have to follow any specific pattern, when any of a few dozen INDIVIDUAL people can paint whatever chart pattern they want

[25-May-19 01:12 PM] Markus#5464
Obviously doesnt have to but i think it would be more healthy to not go straight to the moon without any significant correction

[25-May-19 01:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Was it healthy from 6k to 3k in 3 days or whatever?

[25-May-19 01:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
TA only works when everyone things it works

[25-May-19 01:13 PM] Markus#5464
Didnt that happen during the hash war tho

[25-May-19 01:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The whales control this market, they know what TA tells them should happen and most of the time they will follow that but they only need 1 big fake out here and there to make the big bucks

[25-May-19 01:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Whales need a reason to push market up or down?

[25-May-19 01:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
They are in it to make money, they dont care which way

[25-May-19 01:14 PM] Markus#5464
ye sure

[25-May-19 01:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Like what they say in AA, something about having no control over ones situation

[25-May-19 01:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That is what we are in , the higher power here in this case is the blue whale pushing markets up and down

[25-May-19 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
you can wait for the correction from $8k back to $3500, but since in a deep bear it only went from $6K to $3k, it seems very unlikely for such to happen

[25-May-19 01:16 PM] Markus#5464
well i dont mean any dramatic 60% drop

[25-May-19 01:16 PM] Markus#5464
but even a correction to 6.5k

[25-May-19 01:16 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I think tone still calling for a 50% retracement

[25-May-19 01:17 PM] crumb#2550
consolidating within a say 7200-8200 range for some time can also be considered a "correction"

[25-May-19 01:18 PM] Markus#5464
I listened to Tone, i think alot of ppl get him wrong, he had 3 targets for the bottom one was 5k, 2nd 3k and lowest worst case was 1300 he even said that himself that it wont happen at this point

[25-May-19 01:18 PM] crumb#2550
we don't need big pullbacks, although they can and will happen anyway to some extent

[25-May-19 01:18 PM] Markus#5464
ye sure thats  correction over time then

[25-May-19 01:20 PM] crumb#2550
so probably price will fall, rise or stay the same. there, you have my perfectly good market prediction :troll:

[25-May-19 01:20 PM] Markus#5464
stay the same is probably not likely 😄

[25-May-19 01:20 PM] crumb#2550
i covered all the bases as any good market commentator would

[25-May-19 01:21 PM] crumb#2550
always can come back and say: see, i was right!

[25-May-19 01:21 PM] Markus#5464
but the idea behind range betwen 7.2k and 8.2k i like that

[25-May-19 01:21 PM] Markus#5464
hope it will be reality

[25-May-19 01:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Can we have a 3k BTC but KMD at 70k sats?

[25-May-19 01:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
pretty please

[25-May-19 01:22 PM] crumb#2550
that would work too

[25-May-19 01:23 PM] crumb#2550
i allow it :abusedsmily:

[25-May-19 01:23 PM] hyperDEX#6586
1k BTC 200k KMD 😄

[25-May-19 01:25 PM] crumb#2550
what baffles my mind is this constant need for a narrative for price movements. accept the (organized) chaos
