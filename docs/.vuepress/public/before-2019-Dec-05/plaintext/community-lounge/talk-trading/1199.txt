[06-Nov-19 05:26 PM] CHMEX#0686

[06-Nov-19 05:28 PM] Neko#5830
what are the news

[06-Nov-19 05:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Bug fixes and new cc I think

[06-Nov-19 05:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ARRR performing pretty sweet

[06-Nov-19 05:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the past week

[06-Nov-19 05:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Volume picking up as well

[06-Nov-19 06:09 PM] Flint#6435
if, following the volumes, the price of the asset rises, then the market supports this growth and this trend means we will move even higher, but not without minor corrections

$KMD / $BTC #komodo

At resistance & overextended at the moment

FOMO wicks here are likely

Side note: This local level has historical significance as a support

Last time this level was successfully flipped into support was in March 2017, after which KMD reached its curr...

need to break and hold above

[06-Nov-19 09:17 PM] debaas#3337
hmm send some to bittrex because binance wallet was in maintenance. get 1/30 confirm been there for 30 min...

[06-Nov-19 09:18 PM] debaas#3337
this on bittrex end of course, not on the blockchain explorer

[06-Nov-19 09:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Iirc on bittrex for me it went from 1/30 to confirmed all of a sudden on the website

[06-Nov-19 09:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Check explorer for real confirmations

[06-Nov-19 09:59 PM] Oszy#5734
that's probably because they use dPow confs

[06-Nov-19 10:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I dont think they do

[06-Nov-19 10:03 PM] Oszy#5734
they must be if what you wrote has happened

[06-Nov-19 10:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It just doesnt update on the bittrex website, just check the explorer, once the tx hits 30 confs it will be confirmed on bittrex and just go to 30/30

[06-Nov-19 10:05 PM] Oszy#5734
ah so they lack updating it regularly that happens on a lot exchanges yeah

[06-Nov-19 10:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If dpow confs in theory they would only need 10 raw kmd confirmations on average

[06-Nov-19 10:06 PM] Oszy#5734
that's what i thought was happening üòÑ

[06-Nov-19 10:13 PM] debaas#3337
deposit went through

[06-Nov-19 10:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
most exchanges do checks every x mins, most that use dpow wait for 20 confs or so

[06-Nov-19 10:13 PM] debaas#3337
just delayed

[06-Nov-19 10:14 PM] debaas#3337
yeah at 20 confirms it updated

[06-Nov-19 10:14 PM] debaas#3337
then at 30 it was done

A thread on altcoins.

They are nuanced. We have:
-Protocol coins
-Utility tokens
-Security tokens
-Non-fungible tokens

But to an investor, there's only 2 types of altcoins. Oscillators and Degenerators. You can spot them on this chart of the entire market.

Interesting thought, but the guy shows his hand by only offsetting alts to btc. What if/when alts decouple from btc? Then the whole premise doesnt stay true anymore, no?

[07-Nov-19 12:05 PM] Markus#5464
i think its also interesting cause how are u suppose to read that chart and find supposed reveral points when there is no history behind it

I can reveal that KMD is a oscillator, i expect KMD to moon within 5 minutes of this message

you might use the tip bot

We are back to march 2017 in sats, time for another big spike

[07-Nov-19 03:03 PM] meatspoon#7860
I think most of us need more than a big spike.  Many of us need close to ATH or better to feel like our investment in KMD is being recognized as a good one by the market.

[07-Nov-19 03:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
30k sats and 50k usd btc is also fine by me tbh ;p

[07-Nov-19 03:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
yeah, i would accept that
