if you have comp skills your potential for making $$ increases dramatically. moreso if you do software as it can scale just doing something once

[20-Aug-18 01:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

coding + business skills is key

[20-Aug-18 01:38 PM] dan.#2473
coding on its own is not as good

[20-Aug-18 01:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[20-Aug-18 01:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
one thing I'd recommend to my own younger self is "FOCUS ON LEARNING C and C++".

[20-Aug-18 01:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And make anything, whatever, and keeping practicing.

[20-Aug-18 01:40 PM] dan.#2473

[20-Aug-18 01:40 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
@grewalsatinder Care to elaborate?

[20-Aug-18 01:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I started my computer education from O Level. some course which I think is recognised internationally.
learned Foxpro, visual foxpro, visual basic, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Computer Fundamentals.
That was almost of 6+ months of course.
It was also the hardest exams to pass for even top scorers. I did well until I didn't well till I came to C/C++.
Left this course incomplete, and continued with my degree.
then got carried away with Linux OS and that lead me to system administration.
but as hobbyist been deving, animating and designing along side sys admin job.
later got full time job as web developer and increased on that skill more. I never got that joy doing sys admin stuff that I got from doing programming.

[20-Aug-18 01:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
today I realised I need the core system level programming skills to advance on what I need to do. So, I'm back on learning and sharpening my skills on that.

[20-Aug-18 01:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
C++ and Go language.
and React.js to upskil

[20-Aug-18 01:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I should have tried a little bit harder and gave myself more tries to pass those O Level C/C++ exams.

[20-Aug-18 01:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm still young, so it's not too late. can start any point. no time is late.

Yeah, that's what I also say to people that don't know what to do with their lives.

[20-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If you are young and still don't have any solid commitments in real life such as a house, wife, children etc, it's still relatively easy to pivot into a new venture

[20-Aug-18 02:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
By solid commitments I mean stuff that costs a lot of money to maintain. Such as debt payments etc.

[20-Aug-18 02:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Because once you have those you need a steady stream of income to support those and pivoting to other industries/ventures/learning new skills becomes harder to do

[20-Aug-18 02:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
more than money making mind, it Must be what pleases one to do something mind.

when it comes to work, I always give the advice of first find out what gives you the most pleasure doing something.
put your mind to that and learn everything possible about that and just focus on that.
either part time, or volunteer or however. that something will always lead you to where you want in financial terms, disregard of what you started with it at first.
```

[20-Aug-18 02:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
For sure

[20-Aug-18 02:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

Do you have to push through not bothering and push through shit to find something you love

[20-Aug-18 02:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or do you just love it from the start

[20-Aug-18 02:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
And know its the right thing LOL

[20-Aug-18 02:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you can't decide on something which you like doing most until you try doing many things, just to explore and end up with what you find the most which pleases you.

[20-Aug-18 02:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Quit my crappy deskjob in 2015 to join a startup for less pay. Bought into the capital of said startup by end of 2015, growing on average 50% yearly, bought more capital this year, make a lot less money than some of my friends, but it feels really good when venture capital firms come knocking interested in your company saying how good you are doing =p

[20-Aug-18 02:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Feels better saying you dont need their money also üòÑ

Venezuela just devalued the bol√≠var by 95% and pegged it to a cry...
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced a series of major changes over the weekend in another desperate attempt to prop up the country's flailing economy.

what i do like about pegging to a trustless environment is, it can instill trust, altho i know nothing about their crypto's legitness

[20-Aug-18 02:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
It is not legit.  it is pegged to Venezuelan oil reserves/production which has been getting its teeth kicked

[20-Aug-18 02:53 PM] dan.#2473
ah

[20-Aug-18 02:54 PM] meatspoon#7860

[20-Aug-18 02:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
how legit were the results though

[20-Aug-18 02:56 PM] meatspoon#7860
the government convinced the people there was such a thing as a free lunch.  and the people believed it

[20-Aug-18 02:56 PM] meatspoon#7860
what elections are legit?  kind of a philosophical question, but worth pondering

[20-Aug-18 02:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
people tend to vote for candidates that promise them free stuff.  governments that go far enough down that path of free stuff end up like Ven
