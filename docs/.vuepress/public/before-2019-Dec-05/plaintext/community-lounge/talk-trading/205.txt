So he could double spend on two test chains?

[14-Oct-18 01:08 AM] Geocold51#6462
@0x03 What's your beef?

[14-Oct-18 01:09 AM] 0x03#8822
no beef mate

[14-Oct-18 01:09 AM] 0x03#8822
i watched your stream

[14-Oct-18 01:09 AM] 0x03#8822
had a good laugh every bunch of minutes

[14-Oct-18 01:09 AM] 0x03#8822
and i actually admire your balls to show up here

[14-Oct-18 01:09 AM] 0x03#8822
but you HAVE to take a bit of trolling after this

[14-Oct-18 01:09 AM] Alright#0419
You'll pay me $2000 to doublespend on a test chain on live stream?

[14-Oct-18 01:09 AM] Geocold51#6462
Why's that? You make it seem as if I failed entirely

[14-Oct-18 01:10 AM] 0x03#8822
considering what amount of info you tried to hide but then leaked and your broad statement on what you would accomplish today

[14-Oct-18 01:11 AM] 0x03#8822
meh, you didnt exactly do what you said either

[14-Oct-18 01:11 AM] Geocold51#6462
What did I say I would do?

[14-Oct-18 01:11 AM] Geocold51#6462
What did I do?

[14-Oct-18 01:11 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It was a good try,  maybe some preparation next time

[14-Oct-18 01:11 AM] Alright#0419
....ok back to this $2000....

[14-Oct-18 01:11 AM] Alright#0419
...?

[14-Oct-18 01:11 AM] Geocold51#6462

[14-Oct-18 01:12 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Geocold51 I told you it wouldn‚Äôt be a walk in the park :abusedsmily:

[14-Oct-18 01:12 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
But

[14-Oct-18 01:12 AM] Geocold51#6462
It was tho

[14-Oct-18 01:12 AM] Geocold51#6462
It wasn't hard

[14-Oct-18 01:12 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Appreciate you showing up

[14-Oct-18 01:13 AM] Geocold51#6462
There was no complex part of it

[14-Oct-18 01:13 AM] Japesmith#0609
He means coming in here

[14-Oct-18 01:13 AM] Geocold51#6462

[14-Oct-18 01:13 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Alright  I'll give 2k pirate to watch a 51 on bitcoin private

[14-Oct-18 01:14 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[14-Oct-18 01:14 AM] 0x03#8822

[14-Oct-18 01:14 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Alright knows I‚Äôm good for it

[14-Oct-18 01:15 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just as @Geocold51 is soon to find out

[14-Oct-18 01:15 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôm a man of my word, anonymous or otherwise

[14-Oct-18 01:16 AM] Geocold51#6462
@0x03 Go for it? You had a criticism, it was unclear. You did not articulate your thoughts that well or your thoughts were just not focused, idk. You sort of just had a general platitude.  I'm simply trying to help you take a thought from your head and write it out.

[14-Oct-18 01:16 AM] Geocold51#6462
But

[14-Oct-18 01:16 AM] Geocold51#6462
if that's too hard

[14-Oct-18 01:16 AM] Geocold51#6462
I understand

[14-Oct-18 01:17 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I like this guy

[14-Oct-18 01:17 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
You should stick around

[14-Oct-18 01:17 AM] Japesmith#0609
I think it's @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ under another name

[14-Oct-18 01:17 AM] Japesmith#0609
He has the same charm üò¨

[14-Oct-18 01:18 AM] bishop#9773
@Geocold51 Can you please clarify what you meant by this: ```
I mean, I'm not engaged in your little world on KMD. I don't consider it really interesting
It's pretty centraliziing```

[14-Oct-18 01:18 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
He takes issue with the 64 notaries I assume

[14-Oct-18 01:18 AM] Geocold51#6462
^

[14-Oct-18 01:18 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
As opposed to 6 pools like on btc

[14-Oct-18 01:18 AM] 0x03#8822
@Geocold51 i had a lot of other criticism before which you just didnt at all respond

[14-Oct-18 01:19 AM] 0x03#8822
so what on earth makes you believe you can expect an answer from me now

[14-Oct-18 01:19 AM] 0x03#8822
ü§£

[14-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
most coins you'd need to corrupt a handful of pool ops

[14-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Geocold51#6462
I did not find them salient.

[14-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
KMD you'd have to corrupt 53 OPs

[14-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
some of which are teams of people

[14-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yus

[14-Oct-18 01:19 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ typing

[14-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Geocold51#6462
You make it seem like i care if you respond. I'm not like OH MAN 0X03 Didn't repsond i'm heartbroken.

[14-Oct-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
After a few more elections there will be more OPs aswell... less and less people will have multiple nodes

[14-Oct-18 01:20 AM] 0x03#8822
all i'm saying is that if it takes you 9 hours to realize 'all your coins' dont work cause your system clock is off - don't broadcast 51% attacks

[14-Oct-18 01:20 AM] 0x03#8822
OK?

[14-Oct-18 01:20 AM] Geocold51#6462
I mean

[14-Oct-18 01:20 AM] Geocold51#6462
how often are you checking a syncing chain?

[14-Oct-18 01:20 AM] Geocold51#6462
Once ever nine hours

[14-Oct-18 01:21 AM] Geocold51#6462
It wasn't nine hours of work.

[14-Oct-18 01:21 AM] 0x03#8822
ok another angle

[14-Oct-18 01:21 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Who checks a chain? that's what notify is for

[14-Oct-18 01:21 AM] 0x03#8822
if you wanna 'attack' a coin and do have to ask random people (like me) in the discord of said coin for help in setting up a pool

[14-Oct-18 01:21 AM] 0x03#8822
YOU SHOULDNT

[14-Oct-18 01:21 AM] Geocold51#6462
i didn't have to tho

[14-Oct-18 01:21 AM] Geocold51#6462
Nobody answererd

[14-Oct-18 01:21 AM] Geocold51#6462

[14-Oct-18 01:22 AM] Geocold51#6462
you mean to tetll me

[14-Oct-18 01:22 AM] Geocold51#6462
you don't ask questions?

[14-Oct-18 01:22 AM] Geocold51#6462
You don't google?

[14-Oct-18 01:22 AM] Alright#0419
just write a guide on how to do it if you want to get your point across

[14-Oct-18 01:22 AM] Geocold51#6462
You only have googleable questions?

[14-Oct-18 01:22 AM] Alright#0419
livestream isn't vital

[14-Oct-18 01:22 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`I solved my problem`
I watched like 30 mins of that vid; you have a lot of problems and I don't think any of them are "solved"

[14-Oct-18 01:23 AM] Geocold51#6462
All of them were

[14-Oct-18 01:23 AM] Geocold51#6462
We got teh longer chain

[14-Oct-18 01:23 AM] Geocold51#6462
We were offline building said chain

[14-Oct-18 01:23 AM] 0x03#8822
i think it's safe if i give up now

[14-Oct-18 01:23 AM] Geocold51#6462

@Geocold51

[14-Oct-18 01:26 AM] 0x03#8822
you do realize the fact that you gave off the uni in which you are studying may be enough to (if shit hits the fan) get you expelled in the worst case? not saying this is bound to happen

[14-Oct-18 01:26 AM] 0x03#8822
but it's not impossible either

[14-Oct-18 01:26 AM] 0x03#8822
imagine some other coins fanbois doxxing you and ringing up the IT dept of your uni

[14-Oct-18 01:26 AM] Geocold51#6462
WHy would that happen?

[14-Oct-18 01:27 AM] Geocold51#6462
I'm not breaking any rules or laws.
