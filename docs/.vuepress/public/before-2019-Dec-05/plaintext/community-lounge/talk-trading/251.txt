10000 satoshi?

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  @jl777c Those are usually the EFSP Types, unfortunately quite a big part of humans, it's a real hassle to deal with them imho, but since they make up such great numbers, you can't get around it. I don't hang around them though. I try to stay away from them. I studied communication, rapport and so on for job related to get more out of deals with them.

[25-Oct-18 03:32 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Spaces like these here, usually don't have them

[25-Oct-18 03:32 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
It's the opposite spectrum here.

[25-Oct-18 03:32 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592

Half Of The News Outlets We Asked Would Take Cash To Post Our Content
Posing as a PR agent, a BREAKER reporter reached out to a range of cryptocurrency media agency asking if they would publish paid content without disclosing it as sponsored. The results were more damning than we expected.

They're all paid off, which is why KMD doesn't get mentioned.

@sclear I have tried to withdraw KMD on BotChat following the instructions but the withdrawal did not occur. Should I do some special action? Thx for answer

[25-Oct-18 03:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'll chip in some precious kmd if they can provide metrics on how much clicks etc on average an article gets so at least you know how much return you will get for your paid shill

[25-Oct-18 03:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[25-Oct-18 04:28 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
In this case it makes it a fight against windmills as well. Staying in your range of influence is more productive. If you were to call out all the bullshit that's happening in the world you would never stop arguing. Let the apathy into your heart, concentrate on the things within your reach, improve yourself, your surrounding, improve kmd, then it won't matter that some bought of journalist didn't mention it in a small article.

It's getting to the point that they have to make blatant and glaring omissions, only to defend their incompetence with blanket statements when called out on their bs. But I agree that the best thing is to ignore the crypto-media and focus on making kmd harder and harder to ignore until it just takes over due to superior tech.

the cryptoverse youtuber? @Hollowman9000

[25-Oct-18 06:30 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
He did some analysis on komdo a few months back and had only good things to say about komodo

[25-Oct-18 06:31 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
He might have simply forgot about it, it's hard to keep up with 1200 coins. I don't even know all top 50. There is probably a few in the top 100 which are interesting and working, but which I haven't looked into

[25-Oct-18 06:33 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
i got into komodo through word of mouth and checked out the slack channel, only then I got into the tech and dex, and after getting more info I started buying, can't imagine to do that for all coins though, too much info

[25-Oct-18 06:35 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
From what I understand some ppl go crazy on that with excel spreadsheets and review all the coins and all the ICOs, i remember some werid youtuber had a list of deep reviews for like 200+ ICOs

[25-Oct-18 06:35 PM] actionslacks#4072
If I had more time I would do more research but based on the stuff I have looked into I‚Äôm pretty confident this is the bleeding edge of blockchain. If there is another project with more going on they are keeping it a secret.

Can anyone justify KMDice being at the same price as Verus? We dont want to turn into a community that tries to con each other into holding bags of test coins.

supply and demand....but i think you can get it ffor free from a faucet

[26-Oct-18 03:51 AM] Jetter73#2234
Well i know which one is under valued and which one is vastly over valued. The miners can dictate the price but they are the only ones to benefit from mining these chains that are nothing more than a test chain.

[26-Oct-18 03:52 AM] Jetter73#2234

[26-Oct-18 03:56 AM] Jetter73#2234
The whole thing is silly, you have miners that mine to make a profit. Then you have people that want to pay that needs to pay crazy prices for that token. It wont work. The only way it will work is if it was airdropped to all KMD holders, then you might get more players
