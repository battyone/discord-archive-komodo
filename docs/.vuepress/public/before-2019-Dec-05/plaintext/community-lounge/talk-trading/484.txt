@siu - Chainmakers can you ban him

[21-Mar-19 10:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I never had privileges to ban

[21-Mar-19 10:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
He is just a simple C developer

[21-Mar-19 10:11 PM] PTYX#6840
he's banned apparently

[21-Mar-19 10:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Still see him

[21-Mar-19 10:12 PM] PTYX#6840
i can see him, but not in the channel

[21-Mar-19 10:12 PM] PTYX#6840
he can still PM people

[21-Mar-19 10:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hmm maybe he is talking from chainmakers

[21-Mar-19 10:13 PM] PTYX#6840
well, they only have to be in the server once, then they get the usernames, and usually backout of the server

[21-Mar-19 10:13 PM] PTYX#6840
then they PM you.

yesterday's dump is being bought up... it seems like the market is getting more confident on buying the drops instead of selling into them.

[22-Mar-19 12:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
of btc or kmd?

[22-Mar-19 12:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[22-Mar-19 12:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Wel not need to see, but see if the buy power stays as strong as well

Selling my Z9 mini - looking for around USD $275 plus postage on top (I am in New Zealand) or will accept equivalent in KMD as well.

KMD is finally making the 200 daily sma to curve up a bit.

so i can expect this sideways/slow rise while this curve happens. Once the line starts rising with the price, it will become like the elevator floor.

[22-Mar-19 01:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It’ll be slow

I'm not "implying" anything, I'm saying that if you dump your savings into BTC because someone said it will 3x, then you're going to end up with bad things in places you don't want them
