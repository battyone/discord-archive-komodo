what kind of trading method would you use?

[13-Sep-18 01:17 PM] snowdamn#2414
with mgwCC we might see a traditional FOREX DEX

[13-Sep-18 01:17 PM] snowdamn#2414
limitless trading possibilities if that happens

trading method: with leverage you can milk them for 0.25 BTC per trade very easy

[13-Sep-18 01:19 PM] LocoMB#8593
what? simple EMA trading?

sounds cool

[13-Sep-18 01:21 PM] snowdamn#2414
i use linear weighted MA crosses for signals, not entries

[13-Sep-18 01:22 PM] LocoMB#8593
interesting! what kind of time scale? standard EMA uses 9 and 12 days or so

[13-Sep-18 01:22 PM] LocoMB#8593
I have massaged these things ad nauseam, you can also go to minutes- but it gets meaningless quickly

[13-Sep-18 01:23 PM] snowdamn#2414
for FOREX?

[13-Sep-18 01:23 PM] LocoMB#8593
no, I tried intraday NatGas futures

[13-Sep-18 01:24 PM] LocoMB#8593
not enough volume on NatGas futures for that- but FOREX maybe

[13-Sep-18 01:24 PM] LocoMB#8593
what would you think?

oki - cool!
under the hood, EMA arithmetic is staggeringly primitive

[13-Sep-18 01:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe I‚Äôll start researching it now, be ready by the time CC‚Äôs are ready to deploy

[13-Sep-18 01:30 PM] snowdamn#2414
MAs should never be used for entries, use pivots for entries

[13-Sep-18 01:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôll start my array of Rekt responses now

[13-Sep-18 01:30 PM] LocoMB#8593
pivots as in turning points, or crossovers of diiferently fast MAs?

[13-Sep-18 01:31 PM] LocoMB#8593
with EMAs, you use crossovers of fast vs slow

[13-Sep-18 01:31 PM] snowdamn#2414
no, simple pivots, like prev (O+H+L+C+C)/5

[13-Sep-18 01:32 PM] LocoMB#8593
ah! I think I never checked those..

[13-Sep-18 01:34 PM] snowdamn#2414
with leverage it comes down to risk management

@Hollowman9000  Regions banks gives me no problems and my brother uses U.S. Bank with zero issues

[13-Sep-18 04:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I like @BDexRekt or @DexRekt which you can use in the future for other DEX platforms that might start offering leveraged target practice.

[13-Sep-18 04:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
RT'd @Hollowman9000 I am sure someone here will help you build that bot.

guys, i've been pondering on mgwCC, it's YUGE

[13-Sep-18 05:43 PM] snowdamn#2414
deposits' insurance is the biggest issue, especially with FOREX brokers

[13-Sep-18 05:44 PM] Alright#0419
o.o haven't looked at BLOCK charts in a long while

[13-Sep-18 05:44 PM] Alright#0419
holy crap

[13-Sep-18 05:45 PM] snowdamn#2414
if there is a way for the broker to get commission through a CC, you can transfer operations to Komodo

[13-Sep-18 05:45 PM] snowdamn#2414
üôå

[13-Sep-18 05:50 PM] snowdamn#2414
a licensed broker can maintain access to same market feeds/books

[13-Sep-18 05:50 PM] snowdamn#2414
wow

[13-Sep-18 05:54 PM] snowdamn#2414
so, for the traditional FOREX model (i.e. current operations), mgwCC would play the role of the banks

[13-Sep-18 05:55 PM] snowdamn#2414
first company to try will get their license voided lol üòÇ

[13-Sep-18 05:59 PM] snowdamn#2414
even though safer model because broker cannot spend funds/enter trades really

[13-Sep-18 06:00 PM] snowdamn#2414
am i too naive, @jl777c? or missing any tech limitation?

[13-Sep-18 06:03 PM] snowdamn#2414
well, i guess the brokers can enter trades after they've collected funds from losing trades (that they normally would need to keep for settlement - traditional FOREX corps, not talking about a DEX implementation)

[13-Sep-18 06:03 PM] snowdamn#2414
but customers still have access to remaining funds

[13-Sep-18 06:04 PM] snowdamn#2414
wow

[13-Sep-18 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
once we have cash settlements, where cash is BTC equivalents, then it does seem a lot is possible

[13-Sep-18 06:10 PM] snowdamn#2414
is cash settlements a CC? anywhere i can read about it?

[13-Sep-18 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810

[13-Sep-18 10:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What does Pungo do

[13-Sep-18 10:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@FishyGuts

[13-Sep-18 10:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Short version please.  I am working.   
Pungo reminds me of Supernet.   All avenues of revenue from Peer2Group activities are funneled back into the Pungo Buyback fund.  

One of the drivers for me was their self confidence.   The desire to become owners of their own product based on the fruits of their labor :
You can basically sell your tokens back to the Pungo Group through a fund setup from these revenues mentioned above.     
The buybacks in turn make remaining tokens valuable.    Peer2 has the reloadable debit card already up, running and in use.  They have Peer2Cloud and Peer2Cash which will be part of the Pungo ecosystem.  

It really just feels like a way for them to crowdfund the 3.5 Million they will need to develop this and deploy it and they are willing to share in the ride, but unlike other ICO's, they have working products and future revenue streams / growth in sight.

The ease of use and UX that a client doesn't feel will be big in the adoption arena

[13-Sep-18 10:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I'm putting 1K of my hard earned KMD into it.

[13-Sep-18 11:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I like the underlying model of having an idea and being able to buy back your idea with earnings.

[14-Sep-18 01:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
Anyone else feel like it gets pointless to invest more when you hit a certain plateau ?
Like when I started off with a few hundy and every time I put something in I could physically see the numbers go up, it‚Äôd be a few percentage higher and felt like it was adding on for the long run

[14-Sep-18 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
But when you hit higher numbers and putting in that extra few tenners or hundreds doesn‚Äôt even make a dent LOL

[14-Sep-18 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
Is it a good idea to add bit by bit whenever you can, or would it be better to wait for lump sums to invest

[14-Sep-18 02:32 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
