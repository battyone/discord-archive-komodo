If you can buy tranches of PE funds you can get sick returns tho

`I get so angry seeing so many sells not related to negative news or project stagnation.`
Then trading and "stores of value" might not be for you. Markets never have been, nor will they ever be, "rational" or guided by news and/or utility alone

@Dudealus you are just assuming markets should be like a perfect girlfriend

Selling KMDICE at multiple rates:
0-5k: 0.4 KMD each
5k-15k: 0.35 KMD each
15k+: 0.325 KMD each

Prices debatable.

Sharing info with my mate. Anyone got thoughts or opinions on Quant Network?

[27-Oct-18 06:05 AM] tolken#2655
Awesome, I just noticed that Komodo is listed on Coinbase, not as something to trade, but under a relatively short list of “discover other assets”

[27-Oct-18 06:07 AM] Acura#2748
Do you @tolken have a Link for me ?

[27-Oct-18 06:11 AM] tolken#2655
It’s in the app. From prices, it first lists all of trading coins they support, then there is a “discover more assets” at bottom. Click on that. It looks like it’s more for less just listing top CMC, but still cool to see.

[27-Oct-18 06:12 AM] tolken#2655
The description of Komodo is “Komodo is a crypto currency” 😃 Understatement of the millennium?

@tolken coinbase lists the top 50 coins on their site and app under "other assets". kmd is currently sitting at 50, that's why it's listed on coinbase in their list

KMD oscillates from 48 to 52

a -0.5% dive?

half a percent does not make for any diving

[27-Oct-18 03:01 PM] Meyse#0952
they want to promote dex trading so they make it as inaccessible as possible to trade kmd over their own centralized exchange

[27-Oct-18 03:02 PM] Meyse#0952
it is

@Deleted User most exchanges just did a blanket setting for equihash, binance might be like trex in that they will change if someone contacts and explains that dPoW protects from ds/51

18$ what

[28-Oct-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
when will the $6500 BTC peg be released?

[28-Oct-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
when it does, it should be like an earthquake that has been holding back for a long time. BTC price is fundamentally unstable. this stability of price is unnatural and appears a giant manipulation

[28-Oct-18 10:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I have been thinking the same

[28-Oct-18 10:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362

Once it breaks up/down it will become a huge self fulfilling prophecy

[28-Oct-18 10:06 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@jl777c  or it was unnatural last 2 yaesr and big players were manipulating it, while now - small players left cant do much ?

[28-Oct-18 10:06 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Im thinking one of these 2, cant decide which is more probable

[28-Oct-18 10:06 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Big capital scared escaped for some time, small fishes left and small dont do big waves

[28-Oct-18 10:07 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Also this can be manipulation - making the value seem stable to get some ETF license or so

[28-Oct-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
yes! that seems the likely answer

{Reactions}

[28-Oct-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
fake stability to get ETF license. good theory

[28-Oct-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
watch once it is approved, it will volatalize again

[28-Oct-18 11:06 AM] snowdamn#2414
"small players left cant do much ?" 
yes, but small players would not be able to hold price either

[28-Oct-18 11:06 AM] snowdamn#2414
to prevent further dump IOW

[28-Oct-18 11:09 AM] snowdamn#2414
ETF take is interesting indeed because since they can't increase Volume they can try to present a stable price

Now its likely demand for Pirate and other kmd projects driving price growth. If etf gets approved, 2017  will seem tame. Hopefully whalebro is an investor and not a manipulator.
