True

[06-Oct-18 03:10 PM] tolken#2655
@Hollowman9000 why not try hyperdex? It‚Äôs pretty cool.

[06-Oct-18 03:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Last time I tried I got an error on startup

[06-Oct-18 03:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôll give it a shot

[06-Oct-18 03:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How‚Äôs the orderbook depth

[06-Oct-18 03:17 PM] tolken#2655
I have a fair amount of depth for kmd, btc, bch, eth, ltc, Salt. Will add more if anyone starts fo use it.

[06-Oct-18 03:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How are the prices?

[06-Oct-18 03:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôll download the latest iteration and take a look

[06-Oct-18 03:18 PM] tolken#2655
Problem is not many buyers. Plenty of marketmakers at the moment.

[06-Oct-18 03:19 PM] tolken#2655
Fairly low margins, some near 0, some much higher.  Eth pairs I have up are 0 at the moment.

[06-Oct-18 03:23 PM] tolken#2655
Activity seems unrelated to margin to be honest. I set to 0 margin and people still don‚Äôt buy. I guess people have no problem with their chickens being known.

[06-Oct-18 04:46 PM] jspook16#3059
@Hollowman9000 you trying to go kmd to BTC?

[06-Oct-18 05:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@jspook16 yeah

[06-Oct-18 05:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Hyperdex ain‚Äôt doing much

[06-Oct-18 05:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Reminds me of barterdex :abusedsmily:

[06-Oct-18 05:30 PM] meatspoon#7860
Could have bought a nice AK for the price of an AR upper.  Never met a more finicky rifle than an AR.

[06-Oct-18 05:31 PM] meatspoon#7860
The entire concept of a ‚Äúforward assist‚Äù seems like it should have sent the design back to the drawing board.  I guess i shouldnt get started on gun snobbery tho.

[06-Oct-18 05:32 PM] jspook16#3059
@Hollowman9000 you try shapeshift?

[06-Oct-18 05:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No hyperdex was the first stop

[06-Oct-18 05:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not much going on there

[06-Oct-18 05:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
Kucoin doesnt do KYC, if i remember correctly.

[06-Oct-18 05:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Don‚Äôt see BTC in the list of coins to activate for agama

[06-Oct-18 05:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@CHMEX am I missing something?

You mean the UI isnt perfectly straightforward and easy to understand/use?!

is Einsteinium dpow already live or planned in a future hardfork?

[07-Oct-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
@dukeleto are you dealing with Einsteinium?

[07-Oct-18 07:57 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
their latest newletter said the hardfork was planned but no date, so I think it's not live yet

[07-Oct-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
i havent seen it on the dPoW network yet...

[07-Oct-18 09:00 AM] sœÜldat#8733
Do you think emc2 will be secured by dPoW before October 13th?

[07-Oct-18 09:53 AM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c @KomodoWorld @sœÜldat Einsteinium (EMC2) already being dPoW'ed. 250 notarizations already happened https://komodostats.com/acs.php?ac=EMC2

is it technically legal to 51% attack chains?
