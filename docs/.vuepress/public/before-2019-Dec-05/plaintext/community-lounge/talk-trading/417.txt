ok, so tell me about that progress, price wise, not the project itself. 5-21-2018 we made a high at 0.00041 dec at 0.00025.... we haven't broken that high. Where is the validity of dec 31?

[15-Feb-19 05:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If it it doesn't break 5-21-2018, then no bull run according to the teachings of "Pull a random day out of your ass"

`so a future chart is a different chart`

Here's how JPMorgan's cryptocurrency is different from bitcoin
J.P. Morgan Chase will be the first major U.S. bank to create its own cryptocurrency. In trials set to start in a few months, a tiny fraction of the $6 trillion the bank lends to corporations will happen over something called 'JPM Coin.' The digital token created by engineers...

“We did crypto!”

[15-Feb-19 01:16 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No, not really

[15-Feb-19 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`That dude got me heated when he said "it's like if bitcoin became respectable"`
@PTYX Bitcoin isn't the least bit 'respectable' in the eyes of most here in the states. Almost entirely every reference to it is some silk road type nefarious shit and Hollywood pushes that agenda __every__ week by using it as a reference to how some "bad guy" demands to get paid for doing bad shit.

[15-Feb-19 01:20 PM] PTYX#6840
I've been paying my bills with crypto for the past 4 years. Not once have I bought anything on the dw

[15-Feb-19 01:20 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I read its a clone of ethereum?

[15-Feb-19 01:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That or “lol did you buy that fad?  How much did you lose trololol?”

[15-Feb-19 01:20 PM] PTYX#6840
It's crazy to assume only people in venezuwla and darknet dwellers have a need for it

[15-Feb-19 01:21 PM] PTYX#6840
Anyways, let them rant. I think the banks will lose this one in the long haul

[15-Feb-19 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Not once have I bought anything on the dw`
Yes, **we** know that crypto has real uses, but "normal" people never get to see that

[15-Feb-19 01:21 PM] PTYX#6840
True, when "normal" people are using it daily it won't be "crypto" anymore. It will just be money.

I agree. The fight is full on now.

The best thing that can happen is for BTC to die tbh. I'm with genie

[15-Feb-19 01:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Hate to get political here (😆) but that member of the “Proud Boys” here in the US had his bank account closed by Chase

[15-Feb-19 01:26 PM] PTYX#6840
But their crypto launch does legitimize bitcoin to an extent. It won't take long for people to realize Bitcoin is a better horse.

`Banks have started their own delegitimization`
The sad part is that people in the US have the attention span of a feken puppy and will somehow buy into the idea that banks that needed to be bailed out just a few years ago should be trusted to *own* their own feken currency.
they can't stay solvent with govt backed funds, we should trust them to make their own rules? 🤦🏽
