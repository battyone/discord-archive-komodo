@Deleted User not sure of others, but reading "rich dad poor dad" helped me some.
haven't read but heard good about "The Barefoot Investor" book.

when it comes to work, I always give the advice of first find out what gives you the most pleasure doing something.
put your mind to that and learn everything possible about that and just focus on that.
either part time, or volunteer or however. that something will always lead you to where you want in financial terms, disregard of what you started with it at first.

also learn a bit about Resource Based Economy if can. It might try to take you away from money making mindset, but through it you'll learn a lot of different other things about world.
start with zeitgeist movies, then find "paradise or oblivion" and then try the long TROM documentary.

I recommend these to take your mind off of job oriented mindset. üòÅ

[20-Aug-18 01:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Deleted User if you already have 5M and want to make passive income find yourself a good private banker. Some good funds will yield you 10% yearly

[20-Aug-18 01:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
I wish I had 5m LOL

[20-Aug-18 01:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I wouldn't invest directly in real estate if you are not planning on actively managing it

[20-Aug-18 01:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
not worth paying a real estate manager

[20-Aug-18 01:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
to manage it for you?

[20-Aug-18 01:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But if you have 10-15 years and have some extra disposable income, I would say buy some appartments, pay 20% in cash, borrow the rest, pay off debts with rent/disposable income

[20-Aug-18 01:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
car parks seem decent LOL

[20-Aug-18 01:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
they go for 25k

[20-Aug-18 01:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
In 10-15 years debts are paid and the income is a nice bonus

[20-Aug-18 01:19 PM] Deleted User#0000

[20-Aug-18 01:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
or are there some cons I dont know of

[20-Aug-18 01:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if you need a real estate manager to manage it for you you need a lot of appartments to make it worth your while

[20-Aug-18 01:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Better off investing in real estate funds

[20-Aug-18 01:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[20-Aug-18 01:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Unless you are actively managing it and developping/flipping houses, no way you are making those returns after costs/taxes doing it yourself

[20-Aug-18 01:22 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
That's some good advice @Cryptoon , i second that
