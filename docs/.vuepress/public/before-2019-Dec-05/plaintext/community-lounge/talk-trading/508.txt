[02-Apr-19 05:29 PM] Tek#5253
is this gonna stay up or what

[02-Apr-19 05:29 PM] Tek#5253
this looks more than parabolic

> the dangers of having a stack on the exchange

[02-Apr-19 05:42 PM] p.#1126
securing profits is sure dangerous

[02-Apr-19 05:43 PM] Tek#5253
I insta bought the KMD , RLC and DASH tip

[02-Apr-19 05:43 PM] Tek#5253
with those profits

[02-Apr-19 05:43 PM] Tek#5253
so if nano just stays level and the dips on those also level out

[02-Apr-19 05:43 PM] Tek#5253
I can just sell back at the trendline ( lmao )

[02-Apr-19 05:43 PM] Tek#5253
and then buy my nanies back

[02-Apr-19 05:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
just the tip?

[02-Apr-19 05:44 PM] Tek#5253
i mean dip

[02-Apr-19 05:44 PM] Tek#5253
lmao, well more like mid dip

[02-Apr-19 05:45 PM] Tek#5253
so I see, in my magic ball

[02-Apr-19 05:45 PM] Tek#5253
btc will stay level for a week while alts come back to fill the dips buttcoin cause

[02-Apr-19 05:45 PM] Tek#5253
then buttcoin reks shorters again

[02-Apr-19 05:45 PM] Tek#5253
and it makes another dip on alts

[02-Apr-19 06:22 PM] Markus#5464
a pump like this is not sustainable obviously

[02-Apr-19 06:22 PM] Markus#5464
we will have a correction on btc

[02-Apr-19 06:22 PM] Tek#5253
doubt. it already corrected from above 5k to 4700

[02-Apr-19 06:23 PM] Markus#5464
thats not a correction

[02-Apr-19 06:23 PM] Markus#5464
look at indicators

[02-Apr-19 06:23 PM] Tek#5253
lmao indicators

[02-Apr-19 06:24 PM] Markus#5464
fine blame urself for going against the charts üòÑ

[02-Apr-19 06:24 PM] Markus#5464
maybe thats why u sold nano too early

[02-Apr-19 06:24 PM] Tek#5253
come tomorrow or a in 2 days i'll be able to buy back

[02-Apr-19 06:24 PM] Markus#5464
so like btc...it will correct

[02-Apr-19 06:24 PM] Tek#5253
and I don't need to watch any indicators for that

[02-Apr-19 06:24 PM] Markus#5464
we will retest 4.2k sooner or later

[02-Apr-19 06:25 PM] Markus#5464
this is not a bullrun yet

[02-Apr-19 06:25 PM] Markus#5464
this is a pump

[02-Apr-19 06:26 PM] Markus#5464
dont forget that stochastics are at 100 on weekly btc chart also

[02-Apr-19 06:26 PM] Markus#5464
each time it happened we had a 20-30% crash

[02-Apr-19 06:26 PM] Markus#5464
and history repeats itself

[02-Apr-19 06:34 PM] Alexfrog#1338
we'll see 6k before 4.2k

[02-Apr-19 06:35 PM] Tek#5253
im thinking it migth go to $4500, but back to $4200 would be absurd

[02-Apr-19 06:35 PM] Tek#5253
its been there enough times

[02-Apr-19 06:35 PM] Tek#5253
but rather I think its gonna consolidate here then move up again

[02-Apr-19 06:44 PM] Markus#5464
anything can happen with enough manipulation üòÑ

[02-Apr-19 07:05 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
Guys what is best altcoin to buy now in the dip??

[02-Apr-19 07:06 PM] Alexfrog#1338
obviously KMD

[02-Apr-19 07:07 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
Kmd is too high

for those who wonder, this was recorded in an Internet cafe in Viet Nam, and this is what the man said:
*"Buy , buy, buy,  .....let's buy"*
*"Don't turn the screen off"*   (he meant leave the page opened)
*"Today we hit a jackpot"*
*"4, 5, 6, 7, 8 people succeeded"*

10.4 seconds, why am I not surprised ...

Seems the timing for a shiny easier to use dico wallet / "ido" would get some good attention in the coming months.

3)  U will see capitulation the likes you have not seen yet.  

A lot, if not all of the farm animals will be gone.  A lot of your shitcoins will go to 0. 

And you will see BTC under 1k in 2019. 

And you can take that to the bank.

The Micronesian island of Yap is known for its stone money, known as Rai, or Fei: large doughnut-shaped, carved  disks of (usually) calcite, up to 4 m (12 ft) in diameter (most are much smaller). The smallest can be as little as 3.5 centimetres (1.4 in) in diameter. Rai, or s...

@BittrexIntl @VeriBlock Might want to think about a new system for fair distribution. I can‚Äôt participate regardless but can come up with 10 better ways to help. 

This is not it.

[02-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Why do they want to buy this shit en masse?

[02-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
To manipulate price or what?

[02-Apr-19 09:06 PM] PHBA2061#2530
because of the #IEO tag

[02-Apr-19 09:07 PM] PHBA2061#2530
if you look at the ROI of 3 previous IEO on Binance, you'll understand why they are going crazy for this new IEO trend
