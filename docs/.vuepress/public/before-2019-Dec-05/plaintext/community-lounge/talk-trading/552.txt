KMDBTC a completion of cypher is catching the trader's interest fo...
The priceline making different harmonics with strong up-trend.
Now the price action has almost entered in potential reversal zone of cypher pattern and ready to hit the sell targets soon insha Allah.
The targets are:
Buy between: 0.0002369 to 0.0002075
Sell between: 0.0002601...

Man so many kmd dumpers

[16-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Malti#3948
price is stable around 20k for the moment?

[16-Apr-19 02:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I do elliot wave charting

[16-Apr-19 02:05 PM] Malti#3948
although.. a definition of stable is dificult

[16-Apr-19 02:05 PM] Malti#3948
difficult*

[16-Apr-19 02:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Dont do c&h chsrting though

[16-Apr-19 02:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
O h&s

[16-Apr-19 02:06 PM] Malti#3948
isn't elliot wave charting super subjective?

[16-Apr-19 02:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It can, yes. But if you know the rules and guidelines and combine it with indicators and oscillators you can have a fair estimate of where price will go

[16-Apr-19 02:11 PM] Markus#5464
got any elliot wave TA for current kmd chart?

[16-Apr-19 02:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It can ne subjective to predict, but after the fact, its known that bull trends are 5 waves and bear trends are 3 wavers

[16-Apr-19 02:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Sorry, better said, impulsive waves are 5 wavers and corrective waves are 3 wavers to be specific

[16-Apr-19 02:13 PM] Mark81#4505
what timeframe you use to chart? 1D or 4hour?

[16-Apr-19 02:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
1d, 1w mostly

[16-Apr-19 02:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
4h just to verify 1d

[16-Apr-19 02:15 PM] Malti#3948

Look at james looking for 50btc otc buy orders

[16-Apr-19 02:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Many other teams would use that kind of money to pump and wash trade their coin to make it attractive for noobs

[16-Apr-19 02:41 PM] Malti#3948
with current volume that would indeed be more than enough to manipulate some charts indeed

[16-Apr-19 02:41 PM] Malti#3948
good guy james
