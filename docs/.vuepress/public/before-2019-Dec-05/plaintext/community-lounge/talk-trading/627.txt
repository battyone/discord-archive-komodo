what if this was a real project, by anons, who wanted cover personalities for their legit project, built on KMD?

[10-May-19 05:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
they did so much work, and dug into the latest code and made changes to it. That is not something you expect from people trying to trash you

I have no clues for your country but in Belgium (my country), it is forbidden by law to fake your ID, including on social medias (law was written to aim social medias). Only police have this right but very limited.

Lydia is a fake account yes

[10-May-19 06:48 PM] Malti#3948
Bought

[10-May-19 06:48 PM] Malti#3948
And ibm has no knowledge of a Lydia Schafer working at IBM

[10-May-19 07:04 PM] Markus#5464
Everyone here seem to believe that ”whalebro” got infinite amount of btc to buy support kmd forever, got hard to believe that is the case and if price keep going down and whalebro is not there to push it up well then it can get nasty. Cause im not so sure that 17k will hold.
