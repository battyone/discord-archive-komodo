the 2 million instamine must be overlooked

[15-Apr-19 01:39 PM] Tek#5253
thats the only thing thats really a concern. but those were given away, thats also why dash is so popular. the fists week 2 million dash were mined

[15-Apr-19 01:39 PM] Tek#5253
5 years later

[15-Apr-19 01:39 PM] Tek#5253

[15-Apr-19 01:39 PM] Tek#5253
I mean the network works

[15-Apr-19 01:39 PM] Tek#5253

[15-Apr-19 01:39 PM] Tek#5253

[15-Apr-19 01:39 PM] Tek#5253
I am looking past the instamine

[15-Apr-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
how did they mine it again? and who gave it away?

[15-Apr-19 01:40 PM] Tek#5253
there was a bug, "Evan" gave the coins away, theres some threads about it on bitcointalk

[15-Apr-19 01:40 PM] Tek#5253
the dash team admits this instamine took place

[15-Apr-19 01:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They seem to have used those coins to the right things

[15-Apr-19 01:41 PM] Tek#5253
I think so

[15-Apr-19 01:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They did market evolution app for the lingest time

[15-Apr-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810

[15-Apr-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810

[15-Apr-19 01:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[15-Apr-19 01:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I heard that about 2 years ago

[15-Apr-19 01:42 PM] Tek#5253

[15-Apr-19 01:43 PM] Tek#5253

[15-Apr-19 01:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Anyway, compared to many other projects, they have done things well

[15-Apr-19 01:43 PM] Tek#5253
@Deleted User theres shared masturnodes too

[15-Apr-19 01:43 PM] Tek#5253
you can also lend dash

[15-Apr-19 01:43 PM] Tek#5253
but you need 1000 dash

[15-Apr-19 01:44 PM] jorian#4555
masturnodes seem good

[15-Apr-19 01:44 PM] Tek#5253
to stake

[15-Apr-19 01:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I remember whrn a masternide was worth $7k and i thought it wad outrageously expensive üòÇ

[15-Apr-19 01:44 PM] Tek#5253
its good if you trust the other party

[15-Apr-19 01:44 PM] richardt#2807
Dash's marketing is definitely top notch.  I had some Darkcoin and sold it all before they rebranded to Dash.  Eff me

[15-Apr-19 01:45 PM] Tek#5253
With evolution they basically have a nano second layer kinda thing

[15-Apr-19 01:45 PM] Tek#5253
its really really fast

[15-Apr-19 01:45 PM] Tek#5253
I tested it 2 days ago

[15-Apr-19 01:45 PM] Tek#5253
its as fast as nano

[15-Apr-19 01:45 PM] Tek#5253
and still as secure as buttcoin

[15-Apr-19 01:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Is the level of real activity of the masternodes higher now?

[15-Apr-19 01:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Last i remember it was said that actual voting numbers of masternodes were really low since there is no added incentive for voting

[15-Apr-19 01:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Most just rip the profitd from their investment and that it

[15-Apr-19 01:47 PM] Tek#5253
I'm not really sure about that, but they get to vote about what happens to funds

[15-Apr-19 01:47 PM] Tek#5253
every month , 500k eur comes out of the chain ( at current prices )

[15-Apr-19 01:47 PM] Tek#5253
to be spent for a campaign

[15-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Tek#5253
that can be coding / development

[15-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Tek#5253
but also a adoption campaign

[15-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Tek#5253
like they have in venezuela

[15-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Tek#5253
colombia

[15-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Tek#5253

[15-Apr-19 02:03 PM] Tek#5253

[15-Apr-19 02:04 PM] Tek#5253
dash innovation comes through the self funding model

[15-Apr-19 02:04 PM] Tek#5253
theres people working for dash

[15-Apr-19 02:04 PM] Tek#5253
theres' also mini tasks you can do for dash

[15-Apr-19 02:04 PM] Tek#5253
"dash boost"

[15-Apr-19 02:04 PM] Tek#5253
you make a proposal to do work for dash

[15-Apr-19 02:04 PM] Tek#5253
the masternodes vote yes / no

[15-Apr-19 02:04 PM] Tek#5253
then you get funds

[15-Apr-19 02:04 PM] Tek#5253
or you don't

[15-Apr-19 02:05 PM] Tek#5253
I'm considering working for the DAO myself

[15-Apr-19 02:07 PM] Tek#5253
yes you can do that

[15-Apr-19 02:07 PM] Tek#5253
and thats actually a great idea too

[15-Apr-19 02:08 PM] Tek#5253
m pretty sure if you make such a proposal you will get funds for it

[15-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Tek#5253
ive already asked before if j777 was going to dpow to dash chain

[15-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Tek#5253
but for now only BCH is the backup

[15-Apr-19 02:09 PM] jorian#4555
the chain with the most hashpower after BTC is the backup

[15-Apr-19 02:09 PM] allbits#5898
you keep inaccurately repeating the btc's bitch meme - it's already been explained to you that dpow just goes where the hashrate is. It's not tied to btc. It follows hashrate.  Btc currently had the most by far. You are repeating the meme in bad faith
