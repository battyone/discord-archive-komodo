a lot of the ltc pump back in 2017 was created because people wanted a cheaper alternative to btc to transfer coins from coinbase and the likes to binance/bittrex

[24-May-19 09:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c what is the new change? 🤔 
I understand rawconfirmations shows actual confirmations of transaction and the confirmations shows the 1+ confirmation only if it's notarized.

[24-May-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
3 "confirmations", which is NOT "rawconfirmations"

most exchanges use gettxout or listunspent rpc calls, so those were the ones we added the dpowconfs to, along with a few more. later dukeleto found half a dozen more places that could be used, and that was updated to dpowconfs. after this next hardfork, we will test to see if it works with binance logic

no guarantees though, as if binance logic is to record the height a txid comes in and then subtract from current height, that bypasses all the dpowconfs logic

[24-May-19 09:30 AM] jeezy#3408
I vote for removing all these totally redundant rpc calls and invent new ones that do basically the same but sound different

[24-May-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
great idea! we can break all existing installations and force them to use the segwit!

Our take: Interpreting recent signals from US regulatory agencies
We want to highlight how recent signals from U.S. regulators are creating an uncertain environment for crypto assets, prompting us to take actions that we—and our customers and community—find deeply frustrating. The heart of our argument for a clear, forward-looking regul...

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you were right! regulations are 100% clear. just send in all your privkeys to the govt

[24-May-19 10:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Maybe if people stop going apeshit and writing 10 page documents about how the SEC is wrong in their simplistic determination then there will be less questions about if the SEC is going to keep their simplistic determination or change to something more complex? 🤷🏽

[24-May-19 10:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
At some point there's going to be:
"Well we wouldn't have considered that to be a security, however, the people in the crypto community have shown us that it should be and now we're going to change our view and regulate it"

cryptocoin trading is pretty much like buying lottery tickets (actually much better) so this seems appropriate for this channel: https://twitter.com/MyHushTeam/status/1131957957380444161

Every time I see a person buying a lottery ticket at the store, I feel like telling them "You know the returns on shitcoins are way higher, right? Even when you are down 99%, it's still worth more than a old lottery ticket"

[24-May-19 04:41 PM] jorian#4555
i also know a lottery is just another form of tax

It's For Entertainment Purposes Only

[24-May-19 04:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian when the government has a monopoly as the only ones allowed to run lotteries, I agree with you. They give themselves a monopoly on extracting money via gambling addictions. It's very popular in Canada, for the gov to get their unemployment checks back

[24-May-19 04:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's very effective

just wait for margin liquidations and then do the opposite
