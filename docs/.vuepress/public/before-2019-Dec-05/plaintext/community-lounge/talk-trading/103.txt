It's a bounce prepare to have dreams crushed

[18-Aug-18 05:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I bought under 1€, was it ever under a dollar?

[18-Aug-18 05:58 AM] ryman112#0068
@jspook16 96 cents😎🍻🍻🍻

[18-Aug-18 05:59 AM] ryman112#0068
My fiance was pissed but hey she will be happy eventually lol.....maybe not

[18-Aug-18 07:14 AM] Evitor#6985
I dont think kmd see already the bottom... It is the midle of August... And July and August are always the worst month in crypto. I am careful at this stage

[18-Aug-18 12:08 PM] Buddz1993#5380
tbh if 96 cents is not the bottom idk how low we can go so its better for us that 96 was the bottem.

[18-Aug-18 12:08 PM] Buddz1993#5380
bottom*

[18-Aug-18 12:12 PM] Evitor#6985
I hope so also... But the past show also... Bear end mostly with Start of September.... But we will see how is going on on the next 2 weeks.

[18-Aug-18 12:14 PM] Buddz1993#5380
yep but remember this market is very unpredictable so sometimes what happens in the past doesn't necessarily happens in the future..

[18-Aug-18 12:16 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
in real life past never happens in the future 😃

[18-Aug-18 12:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ye but most of the traders rely on the past to predict the future , but sometimes you cant predict the unpredictable 😃

[18-Aug-18 12:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I truly believe we can see 5-10 $ kmd eoy or beggining of 2019.

[18-Aug-18 12:18 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
there is no obvious pattern, mostly tech analisis is like asking a wizard 😃

[18-Aug-18 12:18 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and explaining what happened in the past and why

[18-Aug-18 12:19 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I cant say the exact intrasic value in btc because its still uncertain..´

[18-Aug-18 12:19 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I also see that usually price movements can be explaine after few months - after few months it's quite obvious like with the Kobayashi lawyer selling massive BTC

[18-Aug-18 12:19 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it was discovered some weeks after I believe

[18-Aug-18 12:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I kinda expect the opposite... in case we keep seeing bear market.
may be I learned wrong that in bear market, nothing matters much, and prices keep declining....

[18-Aug-18 12:19 PM] Buddz1993#5380
What I do know is for example have you guys seen the amount of people that we talking on reddit about Nano achieving 700 tps on a stress test??

[18-Aug-18 12:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and to my little understanding BTC is in bear market, long bear market.

[18-Aug-18 12:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and it will sure affect KMD price too

[18-Aug-18 12:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
may be I'm wrong. may be not.

[18-Aug-18 12:20 PM] Buddz1993#5380
obviosly it will , but we have triggers in motion that can set the btc price up

[18-Aug-18 12:20 PM] Buddz1993#5380
it those triggers are not pulled or failed to be pulled

[18-Aug-18 12:20 PM] Buddz1993#5380
we expect to go even lower..

[18-Aug-18 12:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
possible, maybe those are manipulations ?

[18-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Buddz1993#5380
well most of the failed breakouts were manipulated

[18-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Buddz1993#5380
so

[18-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Buddz1993#5380
if we zoom in the failed breakouts in april now in july etc

[18-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Buddz1993#5380

[18-Aug-18 12:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
700tp/s and everyone loses their minds

[18-Aug-18 12:22 PM] Buddz1993#5380
@Deleted User  exactly my point its insane

[18-Aug-18 12:22 PM] Buddz1993#5380
people are so unware of everything

[18-Aug-18 12:22 PM] Buddz1993#5380
its like its a milestone that they achived

[18-Aug-18 12:22 PM] Buddz1993#5380
achieved*

[18-Aug-18 12:23 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
marketing works like this: if you ann 1000 times that 700 tps is success - people will believe it

[18-Aug-18 12:23 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and if you have 100x more money to advertise it then other projects then you see

[18-Aug-18 12:23 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Im not saying Nano is not a good project

[18-Aug-18 12:23 PM] Buddz1993#5380
its the opposite but the fact that everyone was talking about that

[18-Aug-18 12:23 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
imagine I make 1 billion tps at my flat but I do not announce it extensively - should I be disappointed that nobody praise me ? 😃

[18-Aug-18 12:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I wish to trade and increase my stake of KMD a tiny bit, but even if I find it's profitable, I don't. I'm a bad bad trader. can't afford my trading risk.... 😄

[18-Aug-18 12:24 PM] Buddz1993#5380
we dont need to spend millions in advertising in order to be sucessful

[18-Aug-18 12:24 PM] Buddz1993#5380
its what I think but well

[18-Aug-18 12:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so I'm happy with whatever little or more I have.... 😄

after this much time we can estimate market will never be reasonable, never ever

[18-Aug-18 12:25 PM] Buddz1993#5380
yep its what Im expecting, but if it doesnt happen well more time to accumulate

ahaha

[18-Aug-18 12:25 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
what we could hope that some big players with big volumes could be more reasonable and more people will followe them

[18-Aug-18 12:25 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Im happy with 10% of it

[18-Aug-18 12:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I really hope this long bear market clears out the bad projects.

[18-Aug-18 12:25 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but "well decentralized market" with big amount of not reasonable actions acts like we can see

[18-Aug-18 12:25 PM] Buddz1993#5380
@grewalsatinder  there are too many bad projects it would take 5 or more years

[18-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah as long as people are making money off the bad projects

[18-Aug-18 12:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
once we recover from this long bear market, there is some hope good projects will stay and get their due recognition.

[18-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Buddz1993#5380
exactly..

[18-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
they aint ever gonna learn or do proper research

[18-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
if they make money off every moon, every shilled project then theyll keep doing so

[18-Aug-18 12:26 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@grewalsatinder  if bad projects could be on the top in good times, what stops them in hard times?

[18-Aug-18 12:26 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
they got anyway more money for ads ?

[18-Aug-18 12:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
in 2-3 years many things can change...

[18-Aug-18 12:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
bad projects can't deliver on what they promise... or maybe not to the expectations of promises.

[18-Aug-18 12:27 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
in 2-3 years many good projects may fall as well. Projects success is not dependent always on the tech assumptions. Many times it's about assets managements and communications with people

[18-Aug-18 12:28 PM] Buddz1993#5380
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋  I 100% aggree

[18-Aug-18 12:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 agree on that

[18-Aug-18 12:28 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
idealistic world would be there are only good things made by good people

[18-Aug-18 12:28 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
realistic is quite different to me 😃

even if everything would go to 0 which is very unlikely and nearly impossible I would still be here.

[18-Aug-18 12:29 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
currently I suspended my pro career cause most of the time I was working for people who dont know what they are doing and having them for my bosses somehow does not satisfy my idealistic world, where people who understand make decisions

how seriously do you think the big chinese traders take the china rankings? and how much do you think we paid china rankings to get our number 3 spot?

[18-Aug-18 12:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if KMD goes to near 0 I don't trust whatever you guys says that you'll be here. 🙂
