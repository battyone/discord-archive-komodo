[14-Oct-18 01:33 AM] Geocold51#6462
i am not doing anything unethical

[14-Oct-18 01:33 AM] Geocold51#6462
To assert I am is to promote a chilling effect on security research

[14-Oct-18 01:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
That

[14-Oct-18 01:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I'm not breaking any laws` said everyone that thought they were safe when sued/jailed over P2P music

[14-Oct-18 01:33 AM] Geocold51#6462
But that is ilegal

[14-Oct-18 01:34 AM] Geocold51#6462
This is not.

[14-Oct-18 01:34 AM] 0x03#8822
for a good outside view on the professionality of your actions before, why don't you take the video, show it to one of your profs and have him comment on it

[14-Oct-18 01:34 AM] Alright#0419

[14-Oct-18 01:34 AM] Geocold51#6462

[14-Oct-18 01:34 AM] Alright#0419

[14-Oct-18 01:34 AM] Geocold51#6462
I've spoken with some of them about this

[14-Oct-18 01:34 AM] Alright#0419
just saying

[14-Oct-18 01:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Actually, it *could* fall under fraud if you successfully performed a ds

From one wallet I own to another wallet I own

[14-Oct-18 01:35 AM] Geocold51#6462
I don't have time for this.

[14-Oct-18 01:35 AM] Japesmith#0609
@Geocold51 You have to think of the laws as like a framework, by which a case could be brought against you, and a judgement made. Not a set of rules that you either break or don't break.

@Geocold51 again thanks for making an appearance, we hope you hang around, we’ve all gotten a little salty, but the entertainment has been priceless (the 51% shakeup and all that it spawned)

is KMD better investment than ZEC?

[14-Oct-18 01:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Stephen Daniels Yes

[14-Oct-18 01:38 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
ZEC is on many more exchanges

[14-Oct-18 01:39 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
but KMD mc is small

[14-Oct-18 01:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
KMD has 5.1% monthly rewards for using your KMD (or even just sending it to yourself) and is in a far better market position to grow in multiples than ZEC

[14-Oct-18 01:39 AM] Geocold51#6462
Y'all are confused

[14-Oct-18 01:39 AM] Geocold51#6462

[14-Oct-18 01:39 AM] Geocold51#6462
Notice

[14-Oct-18 01:40 AM] Geocold51#6462
that they all have a requirement of damages caused

[14-Oct-18 01:40 AM] 0x03#8822

[14-Oct-18 01:40 AM] 0x03#8822
just sayin'

[14-Oct-18 01:40 AM] Geocold51#6462
Ohhhh noooo

[14-Oct-18 01:40 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
(ii) an attempt to commit an offense punishable under this subparagraph;

[14-Oct-18 01:40 AM] Alright#0419
you could have done unintentional damage

[14-Oct-18 01:40 AM] Alright#0419
don't think you realize that

[14-Oct-18 01:40 AM] Geocold51#6462
how?

[14-Oct-18 01:40 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Like @Japesmith  said it's about making a case

[14-Oct-18 01:41 AM] Alright#0419
you would have forked EMC into non-update and updated nodes

[14-Oct-18 01:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that they all have a requirement of damages caused`
punitive damages for harm to reputation of the currency *could* be seen as "damages"

[14-Oct-18 01:41 AM] Geocold51#6462
I mean, not an underserved reputation

[14-Oct-18 01:41 AM] Alright#0419
something like that would be consider damage I believe

[14-Oct-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There are laws for just about every thing anyone could ever do, just need to piss off the right person and a case can be made against you easily, even in you did nothing wrong at all.
