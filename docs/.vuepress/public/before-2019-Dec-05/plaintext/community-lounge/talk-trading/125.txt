Idk how it works or if you can make it not able to see how much they sent, refund if only 1 person sent in etcetc

[02-Sep-18 08:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
Would be a fun idea for a game though :P

[02-Sep-18 08:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
Got some harpoonin to do

[02-Sep-18 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
it could work even with a non-random matchup using a commitment round

[02-Sep-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
0. match up with someone
1. commit to an amount and post the hash of it (salted)
2. wait for both commits
3. reveal (verify both hashes, noncompliance is automatic loss)

Could have 1-10, 11-100, 101-1000 min max buyins so there could be a limit to those who plan to always all in, and if 2 people do go all in itd be rng :P

[02-Sep-18 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
if 2 people go all in, wouldnt the one with more just win?

[02-Sep-18 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
in the event of tie, it should go to the dealer

[02-Sep-18 08:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah but if hypothetically someone wanted to make this a game to play for fun like poker blackjack etc, and a megawhale whos always all in, or some people who want to do some 5 10kmd stakes and not risk their whole stack want to play,

[02-Sep-18 08:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
then having limits for buyins could make people play it more actively 😛 I mean if i only had 500kmd, I wouldnt want to go up against someone with 100,000

[02-Sep-18 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
maxlimit tables then

Someone with VERY VERY deep pockets is buying right now. If you are awake this is a historic moment in the making. He is literally BEGGING people to margin short into him on @bitfinex right now. MARGIN SHORTS UP 40%+

[02-Sep-18 09:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If maxlimit tables wouldnt it be optimal to always bet max?

[02-Sep-18 09:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah wait if both bet max it goes to dealer

[02-Sep-18 09:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Prisoners dilemma kind of game

[02-Sep-18 09:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or highest amount loses 10% of their stake, and 2nd place takes all 😂

[02-Sep-18 09:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
and dealer gets a small cut always, better than people calling scam on ties or maxbet grievers

[02-Sep-18 09:44 AM] jorian#4555
would also want to see nolimit

[02-Sep-18 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
i can help any competent C++ coder implement such a game CC, but I wont have time to do it myself anytime soon

[02-Sep-18 09:50 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@Deleted User  have you heard of Fomo3D on Ethereum? It's a similar version  of the game you described here.

[02-Sep-18 10:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
@PHBA2061 saw it in its early stages, regret not fomoing LOL but nah. Looking for a more quick instant game like blackjack etc 😛

[02-Sep-18 10:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Deleted User instead of just one type, make it like a heads or tales type. 😉

[02-Sep-18 10:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
not just more amount but also the lesser amount

[02-Sep-18 10:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or just simple as heads or tales

[02-Sep-18 10:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's from chips games

[02-Sep-18 10:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah heads or tails alone would be good HAHA

[02-Sep-18 10:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
Just wanted to harpoon some cocky people 😛

[02-Sep-18 10:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Looks like bch is working there's a 21.4mb block

[02-Sep-18 02:13 PM] BlackJesus#6161
4hrs worth of BTC tx's in one block

[02-Sep-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
actually 1 hr of 4MB segwit blocks

[02-Sep-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC core supports 4MB blocks as long as they are segwit blocks

[02-Sep-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
plz ignore the contradiction of them saying even 2MB blocks are dangerous, it is only dangerous if it isnt segwit, that must b eit

[02-Sep-18 02:48 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Aren't segwit blocks actually like 1.6-1.7mb worth of transactions spread across 3.7mb worth of space

[02-Sep-18 02:49 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I read something about the change from size to weight was actually a reduction in efficiency

[02-Sep-18 02:50 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Like 4mb block size is 4mb worth of tx whereas 4mb weight is not 4mb worth of tx due to the extra code needed for segwit

{Reactions}
😂 

[02-Sep-18 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the other way around
segwit blocks are "bigger" because of the "slight-of-hand" of not counting signatures towards the weight of a block, as such blocks may be larger in total size than pre-segwit

[02-Sep-18 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
4mb =4mb =4mb

[02-Sep-18 02:51 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I know they lost efficiency implementing segwit

[02-Sep-18 02:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
You cannot tell me the code to implement segwit and rectify signatures on the backend is not extra code

[02-Sep-18 02:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Code = bits bits= space

[02-Sep-18 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Explain SegWit in 2 lines. `
OK
`Core needed to pretend they are improving Bitcoin.
Core lied and said that if you don't count signatures then it's safe to bloat the chain, whereas it's unsafe if you do count them.`

but he might've gotten lost during the discord migration

[02-Sep-18 03:10 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea manfromaus was big on BTC and hated bitcoin cash for some unbeknownst reason. Like he irrationally hated the product of BCH because of "Roger Ver and Jihan Wu taking over bitcoin". when he didn't realize blockstream had already done that.

It blows my mind that they think that is the fastest txs decentralized coin.  I mean thats a bold claim lol gotta do a little research before you say dumb shit.

[02-Sep-18 07:48 PM] jspook16#3059
i think i need some help. I've got bdex running on a remote machine and another bdex on a local. My order that i place on the remote do not show up on the local but the orders i place on the local show up in the remote. Im looking at both instances on the local machine (remote bdex via ssh tunnel)

[02-Sep-18 07:49 PM] jspook16#3059
its almost like my orders on the remote are not being broadcast

[02-Sep-18 07:49 PM] jspook16#3059
