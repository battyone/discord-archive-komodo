TA in markets with single players that can change price so much... they can clearly paint whatever TA pattern they want

[14-Aug-19 05:34 PM] Markus#5464
@jl777c do u see this change in the future? will it become harder for individual rich ppl or groups to rule the market?

[14-Aug-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
as marketcap grows, yes, unless the current superwhales keep pace with overall marketcap growth, but if a lot of fiat money comes in, then it would make it harder. the key is to dilute the percentage holdings of the existing superwhales

The bonds are all going inverse which is a pretty strong recession indicator

It will probably happen so Trump can get a fair shake at 2020 but things are gonna be fucked if we continue down this road for much  longer

[14-Aug-19 06:02 PM] JimD#9272
I wonder if BTC will be a strong hedge though

[14-Aug-19 06:03 PM] JimD#9272
might be a good bet

Why the BTC selloff?

@Bitfinger called btc going under 9k last Sunday.

[14-Aug-19 07:55 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Just chart reading. The gigantaur bear div on the daily was a dead giveaway

[14-Aug-19 07:56 PM] Bitfinger#6245
I hope everyone is slowly realizing that btc dominance is a red herring... a lagging indicator at most

[14-Aug-19 07:56 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@jl777c Is that your meme wall on binance ^^?

[14-Aug-19 07:57 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592

[14-Aug-19 08:01 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Also, that diagonal trend line in my chart that started the downtrend was drawn a year ago... charts never lie. We just make a bull flag under it and push through eventually imo.

[14-Aug-19 08:05 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Most likely see a nice bounce on btc for now but we will likely go lower to scare all the longs... MM doesn't like taking passengers up or down

[14-Aug-19 08:05 PM] Markus#5464
well if its true about the chinese ponzi offloading their stash

[14-Aug-19 08:06 PM] Markus#5464
it can then get real nasty

@Markus @Bitfinger what bitfinger said

[14-Aug-19 08:31 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
News follows price

[14-Aug-19 08:31 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Expect more of those story's

[14-Aug-19 08:32 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Just like libra was suddenly the cause for the recent run up

[14-Aug-19 08:39 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
So probably binance maintainance related to this

[14-Aug-19 08:53 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Yup, you notice how the first binance news about KMD 'staking' did nothing for the price, it continued to tumble. Then they tweet the other day and suddenly price pumps. What most don't realise is the second news came after the bottom was clear in the chart and the 4hr bounced with bullish divergence and that's what drove the pump, not the news.

[14-Aug-19 09:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yes everything is already in the charts , news can be ignored mostly or so is the theory right

[14-Aug-19 09:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Bitfinger

[14-Aug-19 09:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Well I suppose more so in highly liquid assets

[14-Aug-19 09:12 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Yeah that's correct @mrtzmp3. There can be some surprises sometimes but mostly it's late

[14-Aug-19 09:12 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yes but in crypto

[14-Aug-19 09:13 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Things can get outtake whack at times but eventually they get back on track

[14-Aug-19 09:13 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Just remember that pump after 5 billion tether minted , that they typed by ((accident ))

[14-Aug-19 09:14 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Bitfinger over time yeah doesn't matter right

[14-Aug-19 09:14 PM] Bitfinger#6245
I remember the bitcoin eft debacle messed up the charts for weeks before you could see straight

[14-Aug-19 09:16 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Yeah over time things come right,, bear market is just bear market it doesn't reflect on the tech at all, it's just human psychology playing out

[14-Aug-19 09:17 PM] Bitfinger#6245
I've been in btc since $30 so I've seen the market do crazy things for a long time... that's just markets

[14-Aug-19 09:22 PM] Bitfinger#6245
If anyone is interested in understanding markets better just YouTube some vids on 'Auction Theory' it'll open up a new world of understanding the ups and downs

[14-Aug-19 09:23 PM] CoinKing88#1540
As for the endgame for the whales, they will pump it at least 1 time well above 20k. They have that power and they will want to unload a bunch for as much as they can

[14-Aug-19 09:24 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Oh yes @CoinKing88 we will go much higher imo

maybe DASH has spent the most marketing to venezuela, but it seems hardly anybody actually uses it. but repeat something enough times and why do the facts matter

[14-Aug-19 09:54 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Venezuela doesn't even have coffee to sell

[14-Aug-19 09:55 PM] jl777c#5810
it always seemed a bit strange that people would actually use crypto at all in such a country, likely just a small percentage of people are getting all these marketing promotions

@jl777c I know quite a few guys from Zimbabwe and they have no idea about bitcoin or crypto, but in the last bullrun we were made to believe they were driving the price üòÇ

[14-Aug-19 10:00 PM] jl777c#5810
usually the 100th largest economy wont have anywhere close to 1% of effect on the global stage

not even sure if zimbabwe is in the top 100...

[14-Aug-19 10:02 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Just another country going through hyperinflation used by market makers to sell the top to retail
