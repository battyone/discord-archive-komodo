Binance (presently) provides a service people like, so bnb has value. Makes perfect sense. That could all change in a heartbeat though. At the very least, they‚Äôre an exchange, but they‚Äôre also kind of like a new car showroom, they continually are marketing new coins which also draws people in, boosting the use of bnb. Clever establishment.

[05-Jul-19 05:06 PM] tolken#2655
The Binance experience isn‚Äôt that much better or worse than any other exchanges. They‚Äôre excellent marketers though.

Few countries have still huuuge reserves but not enough to bake M0

Yes dow jones oil and army creates some value. But it is not baked

speed overall, it might if you're comparing time from your own wallet to your own wallet

definitely does

but high freq trading, nope

[05-Jul-19 06:21 PM] LocoMB#8593
not sure about big algo traders- speed in CEX is superfast, but getting coins _out_ is super slow

[05-Jul-19 06:21 PM] cascrypto#8206
And easy to use, love bitpanda

[05-Jul-19 06:21 PM] phm87#7395
CEX are doing huge marketing also. They have insurances. I also read some game theories about fees on dex vs cex. We will see in a short while

[05-Jul-19 06:22 PM] LocoMB#8593
doing arbitrage on two CEXes looks like fast and free money, but the iffy part starts where you have to level out your accounts on the different CEXes

[05-Jul-19 06:23 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
the biggest issues w dex vs cex are freedom and secuirty

[05-Jul-19 06:23 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
cex places all kinds of restrictions on when and how you cna trade

[05-Jul-19 06:23 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

Ppl are lucky that Binance is a legit exchange with insurance fund, otherwise those 7k btc stolen would of never been covered by Binance themselves

[05-Jul-19 06:25 PM] LocoMB#8593
yeah like- try sending eg 3,000,000$ from binance to coinbase and 300 BTC the other way because you have too many $$ on binance and too many BTC on coinbase

[05-Jul-19 06:25 PM] phm87#7395
If a hacker steal funds of users on a DEX, it is not sure that anybody will be reimbursed and unsure that dev will fix all leaks

[05-Jul-19 06:25 PM] LocoMB#8593

maybe- time for slow arb traders to shine?!?!

[05-Jul-19 06:27 PM] LocoMB#8593
oh yes, and don't even dream about lugging around a few mill $$ as a private person

[05-Jul-19 06:27 PM] phm87#7395
Most arb bots are on big liquid exchanges. Maybe we should aim to arb small weird unliquid casino exchanges

[05-Jul-19 06:28 PM] phm87#7395
But about DEX, I still don t understand how their marketing can work... no budget no marketing

[05-Jul-19 06:28 PM] Markus#5464
why no budget? they get money non stop from fees

[05-Jul-19 06:29 PM] LocoMB#8593
sinister chicken and egg problem: no liquidity - no liquidity

[05-Jul-19 06:29 PM] phm87#7395
Risk here is that a big CEX said that he launch a DEX but used atomicDEX renamed. Their budget are above kmd team budget

[05-Jul-19 06:29 PM] Markus#5464
and for sure they got bots trading aswell to make profits for themselves

[05-Jul-19 06:30 PM] phm87#7395
Binance can spend 100 millions to launch a failed DEX. Kmd cannot use money they don t have

[05-Jul-19 06:30 PM] phm87#7395
And about atomicdex fees I heard that these fees will go to DEX owners

[05-Jul-19 06:31 PM] Markus#5464
yes thats one thing i dont like....would prefer the fees to go to team to use it for marketing and development

[05-Jul-19 06:31 PM] LocoMB#8593
not sure if they can just copy atomicDEX- I guess they need some kind of moneytransdmitter license and atomicDEX would not be allowed for them because it is totally uncontrollable

[05-Jul-19 06:32 PM] LocoMB#8593
a small part goes to the team for exactly that

[05-Jul-19 06:33 PM] LocoMB#8593
I think the key for atomecDEX lies in hordes of disgruntled individual traders that have been mistreated one way or other by CEXes

[05-Jul-19 06:33 PM] LocoMB#8593

[05-Jul-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
api is already documented

[05-Jul-19 06:35 PM] LocoMB#8593

@Markus "yes thats one thing i dont like....would prefer the fees to go to team to use it for marketing and development" .                                                                                               
Nonsense,  but you like that you could use a DEX correct , well without holders/ initial investors placing their capital at risk to help fund initial development you wont have a dex today,  it a reward well earnt and dev are rewarded with 10% GUI portion and part ownership of Dex which jl777 owns a significant portion of.

Waiting for  jl777 to invent the dCex. Unless it's already been done.

[05-Jul-19 07:36 PM] Alright#0419
that is basically what gateways CC is. I like to think of it as "an on-chain fully transparent CEX"

[05-Jul-19 07:37 PM] Alright#0419
as you deposit coins to the gateway(basically just a large multi-sig with 15 or less signers) then receive a proxy coin/token in return which you can then trade on chain

[05-Jul-19 07:42 PM] actionslacks#4072
so is the mgw asset getting included in anything?

[05-Jul-19 07:43 PM] Markus#5464
@willofleo from ur answer i can see that ur upset that i prefer the funding for the future of Komodo as a platform rather then ppl

[05-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Markus#5464
In the end its my opinion maybe thats why it is not that way it will be

[05-Jul-19 07:47 PM] actionslacks#4072
many people put a large amount of crypto into this project long ago via buying dex and various other assets. crypto that now would be valued at 100x/1000x the price then. if you think their contribution should be disregarded then you are welcome to your opinion.

[05-Jul-19 07:49 PM] Markus#5464
Why would there be a million different coins in the first place

[05-Jul-19 07:50 PM] actionslacks#4072
idk, but if you think dex is pricey now, just wait.

[05-Jul-19 07:50 PM] Markus#5464
Im not interested in coins like that i stick to kmd, others are not of interest to me

[05-Jul-19 07:53 PM] Markus#5464
Dont see any point in those other coins, if u hold them for shares well then start trading u will have alot of higher return

[05-Jul-19 07:55 PM] actionslacks#4072
different strokes for different folks. i prefer watching my balance grow without dealing with exchanges.
