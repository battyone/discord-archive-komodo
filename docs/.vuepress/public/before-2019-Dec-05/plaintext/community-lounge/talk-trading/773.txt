@jorian is kmd short term really looking that bleak ‚òπÔ∏è

[18-Jun-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC dominance rising, 57.2%, KMD rank at 48, higher than before the hack. everyone is expecting a big dump when KMD is enabled at exchanges, but there isnt much evidence to support that, as bittrex and upbit are open and their price is very close to binance

and i think all along huobi and/or hitbtc were open, so there was at least some connection of price to "reality"

the most likely result will be that you wont really be able to tell when the exchanges reopen

[18-Jun-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the primary driver of price seems to be the BTC dominance

does anybody know the meaning of the FATF proposal where all exchanges (and other?) must include KYC info with every transfer?

[18-Jun-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
what about user withdraw and deposit? if the user makes a withdraw, will they send the KYC info to the user? and then does the user have to attach KYC info to each deposit? if not, then instead of withdraw from exchange to another exchange, couldnt users simply withdraw to their wallet and then deposit? it all seems like applying regulations for trains onto cars

[18-Jun-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
and they arent really going to attach the KYC info directly to each tx as there is no room. maybe all withdraws will get an opreturn with a hash to the KYC data?

Godfather wants to know about every deal that happens on his block, so the correct tribute due can be collected.

[18-Jun-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess it would be all regulated entities, so this would not really affect people with their own wallets

[18-Jun-19 09:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It seems more just guidance for nation states to make laws than laws themselves

[18-Jun-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
which means it will just make life difficult for the average user and not provide any barrier to advanced users. i guess it will catch the dumb criminals but not do anything about the smart ones that get 99% of the stolen funds

[18-Jun-19 09:47 AM] jorian#4555

It might not be much of a change from how they are handling it now.  Bloomberg article says it could be similar to this , https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20CVC%20Guidance%20FINAL.pdf

[18-Jun-19 09:56 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
ttal order itself or must be transmitted separately.55
Unhosted wallets are software hosted on a person‚Äôs computer, phone, or other device that allow the person to store and conduct transactions in CVC. Unhosted wallets do not require an additional third party to conduct transactions. In the case of unhosted, single-signature wallets, (a) the value (by definition) is the property of the owner and is stored in a wallet, while (b) the owner interacts with the payment system directly and has total independent control over the value. In so far as the person conducting a transaction through the unhosted wallet is doing so to purchase goods or services on the user‚Äôs own behalf, they are not a money transmitter.

[18-Jun-19 09:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
If the multiple-signature wallet provider restricts its role to creating un-hosted wallets that require adding a second authorization key to the wallet owner‚Äôs private key in order to validate and complete transactions, the provider is not a money transmitter because it does not accept and transmit value.56 On the other hand, if the person combines the services of a multiple-signature wallet provider and a hosted wallet provider, that person will then qualify as a money transmitter. Likewise,
if the value is represented as an entry in the accounts of the provider, the owner does not interact with the payment system directly, or the provider maintains
total independent control of the value, the provider will also qualify as a money transmitter, regardless of the label the person applies to itself or its activities.

[18-Jun-19 09:58 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Looks like Proxy Token DEXs are money transmitters @jl777c

[18-Jun-19 10:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Score one for Atomic Swaps

[18-Jun-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
atomic swaps will dominate

[18-Jun-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
it is unclear if a large multisig makes all the multisig participants money transmitters. that seems silly

[18-Jun-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
so it could be that multisig proxy token DEX are ok

[18-Jun-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
the language around multisig is a bit confusing in that document.

[18-Jun-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, the pure cross chain atomic swap is a nice safe harbor exemption, specifically mentioned

Now it brings up another question, does wallets like wasabi that does coin join = money transmitters lol

[18-Jun-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i wouldnt think so as it is non-custodial

[18-Jun-19 10:08 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I think masternodes based instantsend like dash will have an issue

[18-Jun-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
that was the main theme of those money transmitter doc

[18-Jun-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
if you never are able to spend the funds, then likely you are not a money transmitter

[18-Jun-19 10:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Ah ok makes sense

[18-Jun-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
but the multisig aspect is a bit contradictory as a multisig signer cant spend the funds

[18-Jun-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe they just analzed 2 of 2 and 2of3 multisig, which are the most common

[18-Jun-19 10:09 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I think it‚Äôs the provider maintaining control of the value that‚Äôs the issue

[18-Jun-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
but a 7 of 13 type of multisig, no single signer can reasonably be said to be in possession of the funds and if you never had possession of something, howe can you transmit it?

[18-Jun-19 10:10 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Example: 7/13 collude to steal the real coins and leave users with worthless proxies

[18-Jun-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, but that is theft, not money transmission

[18-Jun-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
it requires a conspiracy among 7 independent parties

[18-Jun-19 10:12 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It‚Äôs the fact they have control of the value of the proxy token.

BITCOOOOOOOON JESUS

[18-Jun-19 10:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
well what if they rebrand to instead of a dex, it is just a p2p platform, to swap useless btcB for BTC? Basically a p2p between the site and a user?

[18-Jun-19 10:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
There is no multisig, hopefully some cold storage and basically becomes a manual OTC desk, where they support proxy assets

[18-Jun-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
if the user is able to trigger a withdraw automatically, then it seems the user has control of their funds

[18-Jun-19 10:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586

lets go

[18-Jun-19 10:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So basically the user is creating their own proxy token on the network

[18-Jun-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
who would trust that use to not spend the BTC

[18-Jun-19 10:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586

Introducing: Bitcoin-Pegged Token on Binance Chain | Binance Blog
We are launching tokens on Binance Chain that will be pegged to leading cryptocurrencies. This will start with a Bitcoin-pegged token that will be traded on Binance and proposed for trading on Binance DEX.
https://public.bnbstatic.com/20190617/13622827-ad6c-474f-82fa-43ca1fd1ee93.png

[18-Jun-19 10:22 AM] Markus#5464
We encourage project teams to follow this approach and issue pegged token of their own coins on Binance Chain. For coins already listed on Binance.com, we will try our best (no guarantee) to facilitate a pegged/native pair.

[18-Jun-19 10:25 AM] jansako#3330
Sounds just like a proxy-token. there are a dime a dozen of those 'DEX's...

[18-Jun-19 10:26 AM] Markus#5464
sounds like binance chain is similar to omni, pegged tokens
