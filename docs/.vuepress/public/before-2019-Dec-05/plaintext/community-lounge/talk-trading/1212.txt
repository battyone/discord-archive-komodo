buuut- I don't really feel like an old geezer only for having my $hittrex account closed for failure to submit KYCed stool samples

[17-Nov-19 11:45 AM] LocoMB#8593
_gosh darn_ !! ü¶ú this looks interesting:
_Launched in Apr 2018, Bilaxy exchange is a centralized exchange registered in the Republic of Seychelles and launched in early 2018, Bilaxy exchange claims to have hundreds of thousands of traders from more than 80 countries all over the world._
will have to take a closer look! üî¨

[17-Nov-19 11:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
They claim 100k+ users from china alone

[17-Nov-19 12:13 PM] coingirl87#6489
In ranking of liquidity exchanges bilaxy is not found

[17-Nov-19 12:13 PM] coingirl87#6489
So volume could be fake

[17-Nov-19 12:15 PM] Markus#5464
not even 1 kmd order above 1k on the orderbook and most of trade history got huge trades

[17-Nov-19 12:16 PM] Markus#5464
and the gap between buy/sell ü§î

[17-Nov-19 12:16 PM] coingirl87#6489
Yeah...its smells like fake

[17-Nov-19 12:16 PM] Markus#5464
1151 buy, sell 1164 meanwhile trade history is full of trades between those 2 values

[17-Nov-19 12:24 PM] Redman#2839
Anyone else find the binance wallet isn't accepting deposits for kmd?

[17-Nov-19 12:28 PM] Markus#5464
their wallet needs update thats why its in maintenance mode

[17-Nov-19 12:29 PM] Redman#2839
Ah right, the chat person wasn't very helpful. I basically got "It's down for maintenance but it's taking a long time compared to most "

[17-Nov-19 12:49 PM] jorian#4555
Will be down for another 2 weeks

[17-Nov-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i expect a week or less

‚ô®Ô∏è ... spring is coming... and I thought I was done putting BTC into alts- only to find myself boosting my stash of KMD @7000 a cpl days ago üê≥

[17-Nov-19 02:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I don‚Äôt recognize any of the top 10 exchanges

[17-Nov-19 02:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Binance is ranked 30

[17-Nov-19 02:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That‚Äôs by ‚Äúadjusted volume‚Äù

[17-Nov-19 02:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Change it to ‚Äúreported volume‚Äù and I recognize bitmex, but that‚Äôs it

... harrr .. had my kitchen drainpipe clogged - ofc not the easy to reach siphon part under the sink, but really the wall part-
dumped in about a 100g of baking soday and a liter of citric acid - house starting burbling and bubbling like some waking nightmare from a cheesy horror movie for half an hour- then, another 5 hours later, the whole thing suddenly was clear again .. 
Very satisfactory experience, I expect something similar to happen with AtomicDex, KMD, the CEXes and the crypto markets in general
probably many crypto service providers will start using KMD/DEX under the hood

[17-Nov-19 05:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What do you have citric acid laying around for?

[17-Nov-19 05:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
HMTD precursor

[17-Nov-19 06:04 PM] LocoMB#8593
naw .. wife bought it to de-calc the coffee maker

[17-Nov-19 06:05 PM] LocoMB#8593
jesus christ!
thats a mouthful: Hexamethylentriperoxiddiamin

[17-Nov-19 06:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Isnt citric acid a powder like substance?

[17-Nov-19 06:06 PM] LocoMB#8593
you can also get it in H2O

[17-Nov-19 06:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I have a lot of it in bulk :p

[17-Nov-19 06:07 PM] LocoMB#8593
is good for decalcing because it doesnt have that vinegar flavour

[17-Nov-19 06:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yep

[17-Nov-19 06:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also needed to make elderflower sirup

[17-Nov-19 06:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But I sell pharma grade in bulk to pharmacists and big pharma companies

Trading in pharma ingredients is trading, no?

[17-Nov-19 06:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyone need a tonne of paracetamol? ;p

[17-Nov-19 06:18 PM] LocoMB#8593
indeed- also, discussing metaphors for the coming market blowout is also trading talk

[17-Nov-19 06:29 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
how does one get into selling pharma ingredients

[17-Nov-19 06:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Started a company that used a lot of pharma ingredients. Then our main supplier got bought by our main competitor, so decided why not do it ourselves

[17-Nov-19 06:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Now control a large part of the chain ourselves üôÇ

[17-Nov-19 06:32 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
that's cool I need to get into something like that

[17-Nov-19 06:33 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
you have a background in chemistry?

[17-Nov-19 06:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
My partner has, not sure if we would do it again if we know what we do now tho :p

[17-Nov-19 06:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Very regulated market, government shit regarding permits etc took a year longer than anticipated

[17-Nov-19 06:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Cash burn doesnt stop because government is fucking up üôÇ

[17-Nov-19 06:36 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
yea lots of regs, I've been thinking about starting up a mushroom farm

[17-Nov-19 06:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Especially when you have 4 cleanrooms empty doing nothing because you are waiting for a piece of paper issued by govt

[17-Nov-19 06:37 PM] LocoMB#8593
trading in the real world sometimes feels so .. unreal when you are stepped in crypto-traing üè™

[17-Nov-19 06:37 PM] LocoMB#8593
like .. those scary regulations

[17-Nov-19 06:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But now doing double digit growth yearly and the barriers to entry are in our in our advantage because they keep others out

[17-Nov-19 06:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So it all turned out fine

[17-Nov-19 06:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Kind of compares to the early crypto projects now

[17-Nov-19 06:40 PM] LocoMB#8593
intersting- so you will be in a pole postion for real world crypto adoption then ?!?!

[17-Nov-19 06:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Keep grinding and make sure you keep ahead of the competition, after a while the barriers to entry are big enough to keep incumbents out

[17-Nov-19 06:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
We dont use crypto atm, dont really see a usecase for that in our company besides payments maybe.

[17-Nov-19 06:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Traceability only needed in to out, not across companies

[17-Nov-19 06:43 PM] LocoMB#8593
not presently, but that may change quickly - if you got plans ready when/if that happens, you'll hit the ground running -and miles ahead of the competition

[17-Nov-19 06:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sure

[17-Nov-19 06:44 PM] LocoMB#8593
dunno -what is the overstock guy doing? Patrick Burne or Byrne?

[17-Nov-19 06:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
For companies/sectors where you need the same traceability across several manufacturers crypto might be usefull.

[17-Nov-19 06:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Automotive/aerospace parts serial numbers?

[17-Nov-19 06:45 PM] LocoMB#8593
yeah, logisitics is huge use case for crypto, all the consultancies are doing that - or supply chain management as they call it also

[17-Nov-19 06:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Luxury watches/design to counter fakes?

[17-Nov-19 06:45 PM] LocoMB#8593
yep!

[17-Nov-19 06:46 PM] LocoMB#8593
diamonds to not have blood diamonds

[17-Nov-19 06:46 PM] LocoMB#8593
even foodstuff

[17-Nov-19 06:46 PM] LocoMB#8593
almost all favourable mentions of crypto in the MSM are about supply chain managment (and don't mentioni that other 'B'-word, bitcoin)

[17-Nov-19 06:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Scan a 3d scan code imbedded in the product to check if you have the real deal on the blockchain

[17-Nov-19 06:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Didnt vechain have a project like that?

[17-Nov-19 06:47 PM] LocoMB#8593
dunno - there are dozens such prjects

[17-Nov-19 06:53 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
see if KMD can hold above $1 now

[17-Nov-19 06:55 PM] tolken#2655
Waiting for $3 bot to be reactivated.

[17-Nov-19 06:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I want to see what we will do once btc starts making significant moves again

[17-Nov-19 07:10 PM] Markus#5464
kmd should reach 1.4$ ish before doing any significant pullback if so dollar wise

[17-Nov-19 07:14 PM] Markus#5464
also 13.8k sats should be next resistance

[17-Nov-19 07:18 PM] LocoMB#8593
I wouldnt be surprised if the update and restricted deposit/withdrawal thing mixes things up lively ü¶ß

[17-Nov-19 07:27 PM] CoinKing88#1540
KMD is not even really outperforming other alts

[17-Nov-19 07:27 PM] CoinKing88#1540
RLC, VET and many more are doing the same move as KMD but "better", we have yet to see KMD outperform those

[17-Nov-19 07:28 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Don't understand why RLC is mooning so hard, its a utility token tot buy computing power. A blockchain and token does not seem needed for that but i might miss the point....

[17-Nov-19 07:30 PM] Markus#5464
12k here we go

[17-Nov-19 07:36 PM] cryptonut#3061
I think we'll see 20k sats again pretty soon

[17-Nov-19 07:39 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Need some major buy support, otherwise only takes a small whale to dump us back to 7k

[17-Nov-19 07:40 PM] cryptonut#3061
yeah i've got some concerns about a whale dump

[17-Nov-19 07:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Papaaammmp

[17-Nov-19 07:41 PM] cryptonut#3061
it seems like this is a long pump that's being walked up buy some big players.. maybe it'll reach a good sell point and they'll unload

[17-Nov-19 07:42 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Seems to be a disconnect between Binance and bittrex

[17-Nov-19 07:43 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Looks like there are no arb bots

[17-Nov-19 07:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I just wish there we more liquidity in atomicDEX :(

[17-Nov-19 07:45 PM] Neko#5830
it needs a desktop app

[17-Nov-19 07:45 PM] jorian#4555
