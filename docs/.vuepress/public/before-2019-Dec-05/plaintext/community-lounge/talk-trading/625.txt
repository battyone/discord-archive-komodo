`With that said, there should be NO reputable exchange that allows someone to essentially be scammed out of $400,000 through any series of buttons clicked on their exchange.`

‚ÄúThank you for contacting Binance Support!  Have you tried turning your brain off and then on again?

Place a 12 gauge muzzle into your mouth and make sure it has solid contact against the back of your throat.  Pull trigger.  Wait for restart.  Please contact us if the above described procedure does not resolve your issue‚Äù

this is some old retired dude that probably uses AOL and hotmail.com

[10-May-19 03:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
he clicked some buttons and they sold him $23 of shitcoins for $400,000

[10-May-19 03:02 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then don‚Äôt fucking throw $400k around in shit you don‚Äôt understand

[10-May-19 03:03 AM] ryman112#0068
He just fucked the 400000

[10-May-19 03:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is a very reasonable opinion. Just don't expect massive amounts of "normal people" to flock to this space if this is considered OK

[10-May-19 03:03 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[10-May-19 03:15 AM] klein#5233
people shorting this will have their stops around 6550 and 6800

[10-May-19 03:15 AM] klein#5233
I think it will fuck alot of people at these levels

[10-May-19 03:17 AM] Alecandro#1179
6300

[10-May-19 03:17 AM] klein#5233

[10-May-19 03:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
6304

[10-May-19 03:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

A golden rule of crypto trading, if over 90% of the people says something is going to happen... it's not going to happen.

[10-May-19 03:29 AM] klein#5233

[10-May-19 03:44 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
BTT almost reaching 9 sats. The amount of moon charts being posted when it was 20 sats was insane. I wonder how many were rekt from that.

[10-May-19 03:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
What is BTT again

[10-May-19 03:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Bitcointalkcoin was the last one I remember using that ticker

[10-May-19 03:47 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Shitty turrent coin with trillions of coins in the supply. Standard scam where you can sell at 1 sat and still make a profit.
