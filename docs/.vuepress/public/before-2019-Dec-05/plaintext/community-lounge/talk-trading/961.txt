Atomic dex should prioritize eth based imo

[23-Jul-19 05:59 PM] 차미숙#8912
How lovely is that atomic swapping slices of property

[23-Jul-19 06:00 PM] 차미숙#8912
It almost made me jizz

[23-Jul-19 06:01 PM] actionslacks#4072
just need to create a deflationary erc20 token to bring it into atomic dex and somehow make it swappable with a 1:1 connected asset chain.

[23-Jul-19 06:03 PM] 차미숙#8912
Right-ly positioned alt will go 1000x

[23-Jul-19 06:03 PM] 차미숙#8912
Not like a pyramid in 2018

[23-Jul-19 06:04 PM] actionslacks#4072
eth would lock up and gas prices will skyrocket if real estate level volume was pointed at it.

[23-Jul-19 06:05 PM] 차미숙#8912
I don't think it would go too high though

[23-Jul-19 06:05 PM] 차미숙#8912
Last time was the ICO mania and people were spamming txs too much

[23-Jul-19 06:06 PM] 차미숙#8912
I would say mildly high

[23-Jul-19 06:06 PM] actionslacks#4072
considering what title companies charge to do transfers it may still be a bargain

[23-Jul-19 06:07 PM] 차미숙#8912
When eth came out, this kind of a thing was a dream

[23-Jul-19 06:07 PM] 차미숙#8912
Now it's a reality bro

[23-Jul-19 06:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You shouldn’t have told us that @coingirl87

So much things to do with a tokenized property

[23-Jul-19 06:08 PM] 차미숙#8912
Shorting longing 100xing lending you name it

[23-Jul-19 06:08 PM] actionslacks#4072
i think the overstock.com guy did some blockchain title transfers in Wyoming already.

[23-Jul-19 06:09 PM] actionslacks#4072
but yeah it's the future, we all know it

[23-Jul-19 06:09 PM] 차미숙#8912
For us though, all dex needs to do is to be ready when the time comes

[23-Jul-19 06:09 PM] 차미숙#8912
Right positioning at the right time

[23-Jul-19 06:09 PM] 차미숙#8912
And 1000x

[23-Jul-19 06:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

“Literally”

[23-Jul-19 06:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
>the future

[23-Jul-19 06:10 PM] actionslacks#4072

[23-Jul-19 06:10 PM] 차미숙#8912
Kinda exciting though

[23-Jul-19 06:10 PM] 차미숙#8912
Not once in history was there a market-way to short housing

[23-Jul-19 06:11 PM] 차미숙#8912
And now it's here

[23-Jul-19 06:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I’m in USSA, gains are only allowed for accredited investors, plebes get door kicker raids because reasons and “possibly supporting terrorism”

[23-Jul-19 06:11 PM] actionslacks#4072
um there was credit default swaps, crash of 2008. bets on housing...

[23-Jul-19 06:12 PM] 차미숙#8912
2008 shorting was basically signing contract with an institution

[23-Jul-19 06:12 PM] 차미숙#8912
You can't like short sell actual houses

[23-Jul-19 06:13 PM] actionslacks#4072
banks kick people out of houses they dont actually own everyday

[23-Jul-19 06:13 PM] 차미숙#8912
Banks just want their principal plus interest

[23-Jul-19 06:14 PM] 차미숙#8912
Not short selling though

[23-Jul-19 06:16 PM] 차미숙#8912
Actually you can short housing indirectly I take that back

[23-Jul-19 06:16 PM] 차미숙#8912
You can short reits

[23-Jul-19 06:17 PM] 차미숙#8912
But still 100x can't be done amirite?!?!?!

[23-Jul-19 06:17 PM] 차미숙#8912
Plus save taxes in dex

[23-Jul-19 06:18 PM] 차미숙#8912
I would love to 100x Manhattan penthouse

[23-Jul-19 06:19 PM] 차미숙#8912
It's on my bucket list now

[23-Jul-19 06:19 PM] actionslacks#4072
well the ussa incetivises millions of houses to sit empty in the midst of a historic homelesss crisis so getting the whole thing out of the hands of the banks couldnt make things any worse.

Nobody expected that they will moon from 0.006 to 0.2$

[23-Jul-19 06:31 PM] coingirl87#6489
And that before bull market 2017

[23-Jul-19 06:31 PM] 차미숙#8912
You know what I didn't expect?

[23-Jul-19 06:31 PM] 차미숙#8912
Siacoin

[23-Jul-19 06:32 PM] 차미숙#8912
I bought them when it was like 2 satoshi or something on polo

[23-Jul-19 06:32 PM] 차미숙#8912
And sold them at like 8x when I needed some cash to go on a trip

[23-Jul-19 06:32 PM] 차미숙#8912
Bummer

[23-Jul-19 06:33 PM] 차미숙#8912
And then we all know what happened

[23-Jul-19 06:33 PM] 차미숙#8912
2x daily was easy peasy

[23-Jul-19 06:33 PM] 차미숙#8912
Even btc lending rate was like 1.5% everyday

[23-Jul-19 06:33 PM] coingirl87#6489
No...what happened?

[23-Jul-19 06:34 PM] 차미숙#8912
But margins never survived to see the 2018 bullrun

[23-Jul-19 06:34 PM] 차미숙#8912
That was the sad thing

[23-Jul-19 06:36 PM] 차미숙#8912
I met this random guy on telegram few years back

[23-Jul-19 06:36 PM] 차미숙#8912
He played world of Warcraft and sold his account for like 5figure bitcoin in 2011 or 2010

[23-Jul-19 06:37 PM] 차미숙#8912
But he lost all of his bitcoin on polo margins

[23-Jul-19 06:37 PM] 차미숙#8912

[23-Jul-19 06:38 PM] 차미숙#8912
But that was my limit of imagination there

[23-Jul-19 06:39 PM] 차미숙#8912
Didn't really account for ICO boom

[23-Jul-19 06:39 PM] Markus#5464
