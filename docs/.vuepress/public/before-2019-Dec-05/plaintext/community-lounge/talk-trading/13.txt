@KomodoWorld @BarterDex @HyperDEXApp Very cool, hadn't seen this before. Do you have a link with more details on the tech? is it similar to how WAVES is functioning currently?

Centralized Exchanges = 0 
Proxy Token = 0.5 
Native token swaps (ie NXT AE/ETH DEX) = 0.75 
Cross Chain Atomic Swaps = 1

Just something i pulled out of my ass, probably should have given it a 5 instead of a 1 LOL

I‚Äôm 80% down from my portfolio ATH

[22-Jun-18 12:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
80% from when?

[22-Jun-18 12:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
December I guess

[22-Jun-18 12:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
First part of jan

[22-Jun-18 12:57 PM] Jazzy#0001
I'm down ~66% from fiat ATH in December/Jan and ~50% down from BTC ATH last September

[22-Jun-18 12:58 PM] Jazzy#0001
My current equivalent BTC holdings are up 6% vs how much BTC I've actually bought with fiat though, so that's something

[22-Jun-18 12:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôm in heavy on KMD

[22-Jun-18 12:58 PM] Jazzy#0001
As long as, you know, it doesn't crash

[22-Jun-18 12:59 PM] Jazzy#0001
Same but for BLOCK which is why the September date for my BTCATH

[22-Jun-18 12:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Of course

[22-Jun-18 12:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôm not heavy now

[22-Jun-18 12:59 PM] Jazzy#0001
Yeah I've tried to reduce my exposure a lot

[22-Jun-18 12:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

I was going to use one of our fancy blocknet emoji to reply to that comment but it seems like mods have nitro emoji-crossposting disabled too

[22-Jun-18 01:01 PM] Jazzy#0001
Yeah everything is locked down pretty tight right now

[22-Jun-18 01:01 PM] Jazzy#0001
Hopefully it gets loosened up soon, it makes discord a much funner platform to use

[22-Jun-18 01:02 PM] PTYX#6840
@Audo set the initial parameters but we can loosen them up for sure

[22-Jun-18 01:02 PM] Jazzy#0001
