yeah I occasionally peek into the slack and the forums- forums didn't have a single posting in 3 weeks

[02-Jun-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
i was correct years ago when i said splitting a coin (NXT) into 2 parts was not wise, let alone a 50% tax to create a third

[02-Jun-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
and finally the market is confirming this

[02-Jun-19 10:14 AM] LocoMB#8593
effectivley stealing 50% of everyones NXT in migrating to IGNIS .. and absolutely noone uses it

[02-Jun-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
i finally totally divested of all things NXT, the other day. the WAVES conversion is such a ripoff, but what to do

having some internal nxtfoundation experiences, this comes as no surprise, given what atrocious interpersonal behaviour I have witnessed by some people towards others there

[02-Jun-19 10:19 AM] LocoMB#8593
yes paying some secretary or so to handle mail.. as soon as some serious business comes up, they will manage to totally alienate the potential partners

[02-Jun-19 10:20 AM] 차미숙#8912
Get some office in seoul -> make an announcement of a future announcement -> yeeee

[02-Jun-19 10:20 AM] LocoMB#8593

At the end of the day, btc will be even more expensive to buy and fresh new set of alts will be on coinmarketcap

[02-Jun-19 10:31 AM] 차미숙#8912
However, btc never really makes u mega rich. Alt does

oh I don't really know, I had a peek a few days ago after not checking in for 6 months or so.. mostly tumbleweeds

[02-Jun-19 11:48 AM] hyperDEX#6586
are the original devs still there or most moved on?

[02-Jun-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
ever since CfB moved onto IOTA, NXT has been dead

[02-Jun-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
their current lead dev said that I have no system design skills and didnt know what I was doing

[02-Jun-19 11:52 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Why are devs so obssesed with telling other devs they dont know what thwy are doing?

[02-Jun-19 11:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If you are a dev you should know there is not one way of doing things

[02-Jun-19 12:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[02-Jun-19 12:06 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I still have some JINN in my NXT account. It is the only thing left tying me to that coin and I'm not sure if JINN will ever be anything.

[02-Jun-19 12:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
didnt they have a swap for it for shares or something? I think i remember them saying they needed to KYC or something

[02-Jun-19 12:10 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
That was the idea for the past few years but still no word on when it will happen.

[02-Jun-19 12:15 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
In the mean time I'll wait for my pennies worth of WCT to come in for all those years of holding coinomat assets. At least Sasha was kind enough to give me a few dollars to buy the lube for the reach around he is giving out.

[02-Jun-19 12:17 PM] hyperDEX#6586
well you only get the dollars after the reach around so dont know how the lube will help 😛

[02-Jun-19 12:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Lube, reach around?... I think you are not seeing the whole picture here 😂 😂

[02-Jun-19 12:18 PM] hyperDEX#6586
typically you are looking in the other direction siu 😛

High voltage transformer explosion 😞

He cut the red wire, I told him to cut the green

[02-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
His name was Roberto

[02-Jun-19 12:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
In transpotimer life we have no name

[02-Jun-19 12:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
In death we have a name

[02-Jun-19 12:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

I expect he is a little dishearten that his coin didn't perform very well so doesn't feel the need to visit this discord. That or he became a performer a local Taiwanese bar and is too busy to show up.

That is one big fat dildo

[02-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I believe WLC was a on demand chain with the NNs. Only creates a block when someone sends some coins.

[02-Jun-19 12:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
i will buy your ticket for 1 KMD @Hollowman9000

My friend bought a lot of bitcoin back in 2011

[02-Jun-19 01:36 PM] 차미숙#8912
But he used it for silkroad

[02-Jun-19 01:37 PM] 차미숙#8912
And then later in January 2018 he bought 10,000 worth of btc and saw it damp

[02-Jun-19 01:37 PM] 차미숙#8912
10,000$

[02-Jun-19 01:37 PM] 차미숙#8912
Didn't see the importance other than his own usage lol

[02-Jun-19 01:40 PM] grumpygoron#4320
This is a weird question, but anyone else having a problem on Twitter where you search for “$kmd” and it shows you results for “$eos”?  Not a joke.  I type in $kmd to twitters search and all results are $eos.  I have no idea why

[02-Jun-19 01:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
nope, works as expected for me searching $kmd

I found one of the biggest gainers this week is 'dentcoin' (nothing to do with 'dentacoin') that is a marketplace for mobile data. At first reading seems interesting but they are an erc20, weird... it's one of those projects that should really have an indepth look at komodo if they want to work at scale.

[02-Jun-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
but most chains dont have much usage, in fact, mostly empty blocks

[02-Jun-19 04:20 PM] Sdunbar#5064
speaking of that, i noticed KMD has about 70k+ transactions/ 24 hrs

[02-Jun-19 04:21 PM] Sdunbar#5064
what accounts for all that useage?

[02-Jun-19 04:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Notarizations, rewards claim, normal txs and some dex txs too.
