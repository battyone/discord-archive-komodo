The CEOs lick Warrens boot

[04-Jun-19 12:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
He  doesn't invest in companies

[04-Jun-19 12:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
He buys control of them and manages them with Berkshire-Hathaway

[04-Jun-19 12:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
SuperNET and Berkshire-Hathaway have way more in common that most might think. I see so many similarities

[04-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Tek#5253
is that a good thing for KMD ?

[04-Jun-19 12:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Warren's fortune is much more than just a couple of 401ks

[04-Jun-19 12:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
Yes, you read correctly. That chart starts in 1965, before most of us were born

[04-Jun-19 12:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
He has surely a well distributed portfolio that no matter what he will be winning

[04-Jun-19 12:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
Imagine investing in the SP500 instead of Berkshire in 1965

[04-Jun-19 12:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also im sure he has more than a dozen quants ready for shorting once the stock market goes full bear

[04-Jun-19 12:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
past performance is not an indicator of the future, but damn. He spanked the sp500

[04-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They did a 10.000x?

[04-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
18.000x

[04-Jun-19 12:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
Why do you think Warren is so rich?

[04-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not bad.

[04-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not bad at all.

[04-Jun-19 12:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
He buys distressed companies on the cheap, gets full control, turns them around and makes them money makers

[04-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
almost as good as my ARRR bag will go in 2 years

[04-Jun-19 12:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is all he does

[04-Jun-19 12:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
That is his play book

[04-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Tek#5253
so boys what stocks are you buying the upcoming crash?

[04-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Tek#5253
I am thinking about buying deutche bank stocks

[04-Jun-19 12:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
stocks?

[04-Jun-19 12:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
what discord am I in?

[04-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I wouldnt touch DB

[04-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Tek#5253
but its almost dead? and surely too big to fail

[04-Jun-19 12:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Tek you should invest in BSV before buying stocks

troll_lol 

[04-Jun-19 12:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That chart looks parabolical, good to short :troll_thuglife:

[04-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I would think banks would be among the first to rebound fueled by higher intrest rates

[04-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
most banks have been cost cutting hard during low intrest times

[04-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Tek#5253
someone will bail out deutche bank, and 10 years later the stock is suddenly worth 100 eur again

[04-Jun-19 12:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
YOLO

[04-Jun-19 12:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Short buffet's death

[04-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Tek#5253
> 10 years

[04-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So once intrest rates normalize they will be money making machines

[04-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Tek#5253
imagine waiting for that

[04-Jun-19 12:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Good old slow drain before more panic

[04-Jun-19 12:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This fall in btc is almost too predictable

[04-Jun-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
FYI Square Cash app will not let you use a Bitpay VISA card to buy BTC. Tried to BTFD but those lamers won't let me

[04-Jun-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers super too predicable

[04-Jun-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is to rake all the newbies over the coals

[04-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Tek#5253
I unironically sold a portion at $8900

[04-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Tek#5253
tfw im finally starting to learn it

[04-Jun-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
I saw people posting "My portfolio is at an ATH" on twitter and I new this was coming

[04-Jun-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
imagine starting to invest in the bear market a few months ago, everything just goes up for no reason

[04-Jun-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
and you are at an ATH

[04-Jun-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
of course these newbs don't know which way is up

[04-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Where do you see support for btc @siu - Chainmakers ?

[04-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
low 7000's?

[04-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or around these levels?

[04-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Tek#5253
if it drops further IM' thinking 7200 is support

[04-Jun-19 12:49 PM] Tek#5253
10% drops is what we need to aim at

[04-Jun-19 12:49 PM] Tek#5253
thats what the JL777 man said

[04-Jun-19 12:50 PM] Tek#5253
and I think he knows satoj

[04-Jun-19 12:50 PM] Tek#5253
: D

[04-Jun-19 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`most banks have been cost cutting hard during low intrest times`

[04-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
bought a wine storage fridge

[04-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
need btc to pump so I can afford filling it

[04-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@blackjok3r I meant cutting their own costs in the sense of cutting staff etc

[04-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
not the costs they charge customers

[04-Jun-19 01:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
those stay the same or even rising

[04-Jun-19 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no I mean they had record profits... the interst rates they charge went up despite the RBA lowering them

[04-Jun-19 01:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Really? That's messed up

[04-Jun-19 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes really

[04-Jun-19 01:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not that much competition or price agreements between banks?

[04-Jun-19 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is 4

[04-Jun-19 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`banks ... cost cutting` 🤣 😂

[04-Jun-19 01:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Here in Belgium and the EU in general I think they are closing physical offices etc

[04-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
no longer having opening hours entire days, the offices that stay open are only accepting customers 9-12 etc

[04-Jun-19 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
big banks "cost cut" only in ways that keep the board paid the same or more

[04-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
who has time to go to a fkin bank at 10 in the morning

[04-Jun-19 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes they are doing that here aswell. Im lucky there is still a bank here, I always go in there to make large transactions.
They told me I was supposed to call 2 weeks in advance to withdraw $7000 for a car lol. But they gave it to me because they know who I am. 😃

[04-Jun-19 01:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
lol I just now get the newsflash that RBA cuts rates to 1,25%

[04-Jun-19 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤣

[04-Jun-19 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My rate on my house is like 5.25% or something crazy

[04-Jun-19 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_never had a mortgage_

[04-Jun-19 01:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I got 2% in 2015; my sister just now got 1,6% and her term is 5 years more...

[04-Jun-19 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[04-Jun-19 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i choose to live in a card board box`
What happens when climate change sets your box on fire?

[04-Jun-19 01:13 PM] Tek#5253
yeah you can 3x to 5x that to know the real actual inflation

[04-Jun-19 01:13 PM] Tek#5253

[04-Jun-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
