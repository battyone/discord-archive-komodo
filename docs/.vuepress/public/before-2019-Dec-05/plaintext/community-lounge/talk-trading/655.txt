85% loss from IEO... then a 50% bounce up! now only down 80% from IEO price. and they went from 30% to 0.3% of BTC transactions

which now brings up the question, how can they secure anything if no miners are paying for the BTC txfees. one of the original unanswered questions

[16-May-19 08:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i did read their whitepaper where they go into length about basic things like how they encoded multisig, but couldnt find how the attack mentioned in https://medium.com/@HjalmarPeters/veriblock-and-its-poop-protocol-f9a39f50b06

VeriBlock and its PooP Protocol
A few days ago I became aware of the VeriBlock-IEO (“Initial Exchange Offering”) conducted by Bittrex. I heard about VeriBlock before…

[16-May-19 08:54 PM] jl777c#5810
that basically makes it DOA

[16-May-19 08:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'm sure the answer is somewhere in that 76 page wp

[16-May-19 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
it wasnt

[16-May-19 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
at least i didnt see it

[16-May-19 08:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
just saw u read it all.. i couldn't find the strength to do that

[16-May-19 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the whitepaper does clarify that any altcoin will need to modify their code to make use if the PoP data

[16-May-19 08:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
miners jumped out like rats on a sinking ship as soon as btc started to pump

[16-May-19 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
and also divert some percentage of their coin supply to the VBK miners. that part is the real economic question, even if PoP miners will pay the BTC price, would any serious coin expose themselves to hacker establishing the attack chain as real, and pay a percentage of coin emissions for this

[16-May-19 08:58 PM] mrlynch#5735
tbf their economic model is flawed to say the least. anyone doing basic 2 and 2 can tell things don't add up

[16-May-19 08:58 PM] mrlynch#5735
fortunately for them the world has an abundance of ppl that jump on silly things

[16-May-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
let us not forget the half million new coins per day

[16-May-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
and that the VBK team has ~70% of all eventual coins, but they have it now

[16-May-19 09:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
unfortunately/fortunately for the crypto space when that vbk thing crashes and burns (more than it has) it will give "piggybacking" a bad namd OR make ppl aware of the risks of buying into hyped, closed source non-sense

[16-May-19 09:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
do we know it's just 70%? they still haven't opened the node have they?!

[16-May-19 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810

i wonder why DCR...

[16-May-19 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
DCR doesnt issue tokens

[16-May-19 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it has staking, but there are many coins that do staking

[16-May-19 09:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
maybe they don't want to take any risks?!

[16-May-19 09:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
is this in the aftermath of the sec regulations?

[16-May-19 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure. SEC regulations means they need to be a money transmitter in any case

[16-May-19 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess they also cant be trading unregistered securities

[16-May-19 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
but DCR didnt do an ICO

[16-May-19 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
very strange

[16-May-19 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
to be safe, they should really delist all coins

[16-May-19 09:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
```The only justification for delisting DCR as a "possible security" would be if they are uncertain about PoS platforms -- but this wouldn't explain why ATOM, EOS, etc remain.

I think what's really happening here is theyre delisting coins with subpar volume & shoehorning an excuse.```

[16-May-19 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
that makes sense

[16-May-19 09:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
they do say it's due to `regulatory uncertainty` so yes, no risks taken

[16-May-19 09:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
guess having uncle sam up their wazoo is not something they entertain

[16-May-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
delist all coins!
