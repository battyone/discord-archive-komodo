just during the bear weak hands sold to stronger ones, so now even less people selling

I wish I had enough skin in the game to be able to just hold

[02-Dec-18 09:40 AM] Tek#5253
but I wont make it

[02-Dec-18 09:40 AM] Tek#5253
I must make trades

im winning not losing, I sold in jan/feb

[02-Dec-18 09:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
both cannot be true; because, words
you cannot be "winning" **and** "can't make it" through the downs; because, words

[02-Dec-18 09:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I must make trades` = **not** winning

[02-Dec-18 09:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
winners make the trades that make the best profitable choices and are never a "must"

[02-Dec-18 09:52 AM] Tek#5253

when they saw it

[02-Dec-18 09:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at +38% over what they bought last week, it makes sense to take a check and bank it
at praying for a future loss, it makes no sense to sell

[02-Dec-18 10:18 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
already for 3 weeks Im struggling to teach CNN to recognize patterns on BTC trades. No success yet. Debuggin if I did wrong labels or sth else. Anyway if it fail it only proves tech analysis is all just guessing arbitrary lines or confirming history, not really predicting future.

[02-Dec-18 10:24 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
what I mean by that - daily trading based on TA seems nonsense... online insiders info or quick action when big signals come (Microsoft buying BTC or so)

[02-Dec-18 03:48 PM] Alecandro#1179
so thoughts on pump this am? Just stuff leading up to the hard fork and rebrand on the 15th?

[02-Dec-18 03:55 PM] Alecandro#1179
well I guess not rebrand, but hard fork

[02-Dec-18 03:55 PM] Alecandro#1179
?

[02-Dec-18 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, I guess I'm just totally lost on trading....
someone please explain to me how a point that's still on a downward trend of any ma longer than a week is considered a "pump"....

[02-Dec-18 03:57 PM] Alecandro#1179
So I guess if you are looking at short term timeframes, a 17% increase in less than a day isn't in the realm of definition for a pump?

[02-Dec-18 03:58 PM] Alecandro#1179
Let me rephrase for you then: Any thoughts on the recent 17% increase in less than 24 hours?

[02-Dec-18 03:58 PM] Alecandro#1179
*Not pump*

[02-Dec-18 03:58 PM] Alecandro#1179
😂

[02-Dec-18 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"short term timeframes"
so, 2 weeks is "long term"? ffs, no wonder you get excited by a 12 cent rebound on a 92 cent drop 🤦🏽

[02-Dec-18 04:00 PM] Alecandro#1179
oh boy, okay man it was just a question

[02-Dec-18 04:00 PM] Alecandro#1179
you just gotta be that guy lol

I'm "that guy" that doesn't understand how 17% increase back from a 66% drop is something conversation worthy

[02-Dec-18 04:02 PM] Alecandro#1179
alright then ✌🏽

[02-Dec-18 04:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from 56 cents, wake me when it hits a 200% increase and we're only down 33%

[02-Dec-18 04:06 PM] PHBA2061#2530
let's just say that Changpeng Zhao finally decided to buy some kmd which caused the +17% ....  😬

[02-Dec-18 04:07 PM] Alecandro#1179
lol well see at least there's some good conversation there

What if I told you that the world is round, doesn't have to revolve  around BTC, and the value of any crypto-currency should be weighed on  its own merits (not some pseudo-fiat value based on its BTC value based  on BTC/fiat value).... https://t.co/AJtykoBMBW

"A federal court in California just ruled against the SEC in an ICO case"

{Reactions}
😮 

[02-Dec-18 08:21 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
"...lots of commentators have taken the position that these cases are all layups. That everyone who sells in an ICO is going to jail. I think that’s intellectually lazy.  I think this decision is evidence that these cases are factually nuanced, legally complex, and quite far from layups"

[02-Dec-18 09:00 PM] Lumbi#8378
weak hands to 0.22$ 😄

completely meaningless frames, but interesting nonetheless

renewed my coinigy subscription today and was playing with a few things

[03-Dec-18 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mostly looking at how charts compare on siteA to siteB to siteC
oddly math isn't always math when it comes to appearance

[03-Dec-18 01:13 PM] jorian#4555
what did you conclude? we're all feked?

[03-Dec-18 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I concluded the same thing I always do:
KMD needs a solid USD market that isn't *directly* tied to BTC/USD...

[03-Dec-18 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or else we're all feked :trollface:

[03-Dec-18 01:21 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

not like one could get back in by selling right now anyway 😛

[03-Dec-18 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
question: why in the hell is there **any** KMD left for sale on dp @ 17k sats? Are there no arb traders left? or am I missing something?

[03-Dec-18 02:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
little volume and not much people trading it seems

[03-Dec-18 02:02 PM] jorian#4555
arbitrage isn't really possible right?

[03-Dec-18 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_digs around and looks for some liquid BTC; because $1400 is $1400_

[03-Dec-18 02:02 PM] jorian#4555
you want to sell at binance i guess?

[03-Dec-18 02:02 PM] jorian#4555
then you first need to get your kmd on binance

[03-Dec-18 02:02 PM] jorian#4555
which isnt possible

[03-Dec-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`arbitrage isn't really possible right?`
Buy on DP, sell on Binance for 1k sats more
that's arb in a nutshell

[03-Dec-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you keep stock on both exchanges, you don't need to tx
