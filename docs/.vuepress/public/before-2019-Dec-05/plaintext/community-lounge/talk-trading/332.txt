How close can bitcoin get to zero?

[06-Dec-18 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
hopefully only 0.01 higher than

usually that means it didn't send, connection issues

[06-Dec-18 05:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then it should go white when you connect and send

[06-Dec-18 05:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and give you option to resend if you lost total connection

[06-Dec-18 05:08 PM] snowdamn#2414

Not if you're a fan of crypto-independance

[06-Dec-18 06:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What most tech coins (and by extension, coin possessors) need is for BTC to strike below summer-2016 prices and stick there
And after that, a renewed interest in the space that is not BTC-centric

🆒 

[06-Dec-18 06:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The more fiat gateways other cryptos start to have, the lest the price will depend on btc

[06-Dec-18 06:30 PM] snowdamn#2414
well, if it's not the bottom, i'll get liquidated soonish

[06-Dec-18 06:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[06-Dec-18 06:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You are on margin?

[06-Dec-18 06:31 PM] snowdamn#2414

[06-Dec-18 06:33 PM] snowdamn#2414
the bet is that BTC bottomed
you can pickup a quick 2x with ETH using fairly low leverage
if it pans out

[06-Dec-18 06:34 PM] snowdamn#2414
not $200 ETH, 2x your bet

[06-Dec-18 06:34 PM] snowdamn#2414
let's see what happens

[06-Dec-18 06:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Margin is how rich people take money away from the poor

[06-Dec-18 06:43 PM] SHossain#0007
i remember buying some ETH around $5 long time ago for trading and traded at loss in short term :p

[06-Dec-18 06:44 PM] snowdamn#2414
ETH will reclaim #2 spot for sure, but is of no use if liquidated :trollface:

yes, frequent trading should only be done with gambling money

excluding bots

[06-Dec-18 06:49 PM] snowdamn#2414
someone please shoot Mr. Bear with tranquilizer

[06-Dec-18 06:54 PM] Lumbi#8378
what's your margin call at @snowdamn ?

[06-Dec-18 06:55 PM] snowdamn#2414
good $20 away

[06-Dec-18 06:55 PM] Lumbi#8378
good whisky, classical music and cigs should help you through 😄

[06-Dec-18 06:56 PM] snowdamn#2414
i made the call the other day, then entered
all is good, i've done this many times
but i always try to have fun when i open these gambling trades! 😀

[06-Dec-18 06:57 PM] Lumbi#8378
some like to live close to the edge... 😉

[06-Dec-18 06:58 PM] snowdamn#2414
nothing wrong going higher with the leverage, but can't go for 2x profit in that case

[06-Dec-18 07:02 PM] snowdamn#2414
@Lumbi check the #s for 3x (at most) leveraged ETH long
no brainer if BTC has bottomed 😉

[06-Dec-18 07:03 PM] snowdamn#2414
no brainer for 2x your bet, i repeat, not $200 ETH

it's almost like his only goal is to do as much damage as humanly possible.

[06-Dec-18 08:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```However, during the split, UnitedCorp said a number of entities took control of the network using “rented hashing”— the process of artificially deploying computing power to a network — to favor the adoption of Bitcoin ABC. ```

`the process of artificially deploying computing power to a network`
That truely sad thing about that is they are likely to get some 80 yr old judge that can't operate his feken phone and have a decent shot at convincing him that there's truth to that statement 😣

not sure anybody has the right to claim damages for a currency, open source at that

[06-Dec-18 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
if this wins, it would set a very dangerous precendent

[06-Dec-18 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
basically any coin with anybody that ever loses money can sue some people somehow associated with the coin for damages? is that what the idea is?

[06-Dec-18 08:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there might be a claim for market manipulation, but no one that knows fekall could uphold a claim over hashrate

[06-Dec-18 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
there are no laws against price manipulation of currencies, are there?

[06-Dec-18 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
there cant be as if there were, all the govts would be guilty

[06-Dec-18 08:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

WOW!

So here is the big kicker in the SV lawsuit:

They want a judge to order that Bitcoin ABC roll back the BCH blockchain to November 15th! They also want a US judge to determine the consensus rules. Seriously, that's what is being asked in the lawsuit!

yes, dPoW is centralized

[06-Dec-18 08:39 PM] jorian#4555
must sue

[06-Dec-18 08:39 PM] jorian#4555
maybe BTC needs to be rewinded to the non-checkpoint stage too

[06-Dec-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so this is the CSW plan to rollback BCH ABC! not with hashrate, but with lawsuit
