So whilst there are setbacks in terms of speed, what we gain is much more.

[11-Aug-19 03:14 AM] ph03nix#3115
speaking of speed, 120 confirms for binance :troll:

[11-Aug-19 03:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well yeah......

[11-Aug-19 03:14 AM] richardt#2807
As long as it's truly easy to use and reliable, it should be pretty popular.  There's also big OTC market out there

[11-Aug-19 03:15 AM] richardt#2807
don't need a lot of speed for OTC

[11-Aug-19 03:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@richardt yes well it has taken us close to 2 years and mm1.0 failing to achieve what we want to get to where we are.

[11-Aug-19 03:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Which is why i think we are at least 1-2 ahead of anything close to us

[11-Aug-19 03:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Once we have the users and the liquidity, just let the market makers  try to keep the price of KMD down.

[11-Aug-19 03:22 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The miners will be pumping coins to Atomicdex I’m sure of as well

[11-Aug-19 03:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Hard to say, kinda like low liquidity exchanges, no much of a pump

[11-Aug-19 03:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But once we have  the liquidity and users, yes we will have the same effect 😄

[11-Aug-19 03:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Maybe i can actually make a few $ listing it in hyperDEX 😄

[11-Aug-19 03:24 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I meant just offloading , not pump as in pumping price , my bad

[11-Aug-19 03:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
oh yes probably, i thought you meant like coinbase listing pump 😄

[11-Aug-19 04:40 AM] tolken#2655
We’ll definitely have liquidity this time.

[11-Aug-19 04:52 AM] jspook16#3059
yes to liquidity

[11-Aug-19 05:00 AM] hastrup#8742
@hyperDEX what are som possible solutions to the trading speed? I know barterdex had 0 con trading if you deposited kmd.

[11-Aug-19 05:05 AM] actionslacks#4072
faster chains? atomic swap speed is dictated by the rate at which the coin's respective blocks are created.

[11-Aug-19 05:20 AM] ph03nix#3115
takes more than 2 hours to deposit to binance

[11-Aug-19 05:58 AM] tolken#2655
Pretty sure 0conf trading is being added back at some point.

[11-Aug-19 05:59 AM] hastrup#8742
@actionslacks I know but that's why 0conf bits was created. Just wanted to know if there are other solutions to this problem.

[11-Aug-19 05:59 AM] hastrup#8742
@tolken ok thx for the info

[11-Aug-19 07:14 AM] designer#4893
Every ICO, IEO founders and token issuers must be held accountable for their scam. Everyone, not just a few. Everyone, regardless how big or small they are. 

All of them will be remembered in history as a scammer, just like those who did exit scams during the Dotcom bubble. But this time, evidence is immutable. 

Time will tell. We’re heading toward one protocol. Everything else will be gone for good.

[11-Aug-19 07:22 AM] hastrup#8742
@designer why do you think there will only be one protocol?

[11-Aug-19 07:30 AM] ph03nix#3115
their can only be one

[11-Aug-19 07:31 AM] ph03nix#3115

$BTC going from $20,000 to $3,000 to $15,000 without fundamentals adjustment (even stronger fundamentals) -> nothing wrong with that. 

Altcoin going down the drain, while producing and releasing a ton of things -> Altcoins are dead. 

It's just whaleplay and marketcycles.

Suckers rally 😂 😂

[11-Aug-19 09:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@hastrup 0conf will be added eventually but maybe there will be something else added later, maybe a reputation system?

Not too sure but there was some talk about a listing fee?

[11-Aug-19 10:54 AM] Caglio#3337
@hyperDEX do you have any ltc

[11-Aug-19 10:54 AM] Caglio#3337

[11-Aug-19 10:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Not he meme, the actual tech. If you scroll up and read what i wrote earlier, hopefully that gives you a indication of what we are about

[11-Aug-19 10:56 AM] Caglio#3337
i would swap kmd for monero also

[11-Aug-19 10:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
how much KMD you want to offload?

[11-Aug-19 10:56 AM] Caglio#3337

[11-Aug-19 10:57 AM] Caglio#3337

[11-Aug-19 10:57 AM] Caglio#3337

[11-Aug-19 10:58 AM] Caglio#3337
kmd should hit 4-5$ to be good for me

[11-Aug-19 10:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It is a big loss to us all but if you cannot see what i have written as something to be excited about, might as well get more LTC i guess?

[11-Aug-19 11:02 AM] Caglio#3337
well ltc donr develop good lately

[11-Aug-19 11:02 AM] Caglio#3337

[11-Aug-19 11:07 AM] Caglio#3337

[11-Aug-19 11:08 AM] Caglio#3337

[11-Aug-19 11:09 AM] Buddz1993#5380

[11-Aug-19 11:09 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Also big lose

[11-Aug-19 11:10 AM] Buddz1993#5380
You know how crypto works

[11-Aug-19 11:10 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Be ready for those 80-90% loss and also be ready for what it’s a loss to turn out into gains in months or even weeks

[11-Aug-19 11:10 AM] Buddz1993#5380
This is a very manipulative market and that’s how things work

[11-Aug-19 11:11 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Sounds to me you missed the profitable BTC train and stayed on the altcoin train... Nothing wrong with that, but investments come with a risk. Especially with the high volatility of crypto.

[11-Aug-19 11:11 AM] Caglio#3337
i dont trade so yeah

[11-Aug-19 11:11 AM] Caglio#3337
hold hold

[11-Aug-19 11:11 AM] Caglio#3337
hold for gains

[11-Aug-19 11:11 AM] Caglio#3337
hold for dick in ass

[11-Aug-19 11:12 AM] Caglio#3337
no recovery is gonna be made

[11-Aug-19 11:12 AM] Caglio#3337
im well aware

[11-Aug-19 11:12 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Than all I can recommend is buy now and hold longer (no investment advice)

[11-Aug-19 11:12 AM] Caglio#3337
but why buy now ?

[11-Aug-19 11:12 AM] Caglio#3337
i mean go even deeper

[11-Aug-19 11:13 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Low prices... how much lower can they go?

[11-Aug-19 11:13 AM] Caglio#3337
its not like ww cannot go any lower

[11-Aug-19 11:13 AM] Caglio#3337
to the 0

[11-Aug-19 11:13 AM] Caglio#3337
we been at 50 cents few months ago

[11-Aug-19 11:13 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
That’s the risk for f any investment.

[11-Aug-19 11:14 AM] Caglio#3337
and thats when we were ovwr 20k sats

[11-Aug-19 11:14 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Don’t invest more than you’re prepared to loose.

[11-Aug-19 11:14 AM] Caglio#3337
imagine btc drops now amd bear market

[11-Aug-19 11:14 AM] Caglio#3337
we are easily at 10 cents

[11-Aug-19 11:15 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Don’t invest more than you’re prepared to loose. <<< this .
