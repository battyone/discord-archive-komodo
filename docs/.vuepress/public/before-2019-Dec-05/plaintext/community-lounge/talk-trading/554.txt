So whitepaper isn't up-to-date!

[16-Apr-19 07:25 PM] zatJUM#9924
Or there's another version and the link on the site doesn't point toward the right version

[16-Apr-19 07:28 PM] Malti#3948
it's because i'm downloading the arrr chain and my roommate is nagging that i might use all the wifi haha

[16-Apr-19 07:31 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`nagging that i might use all the wifi `
then the answer you wanted was "the entire chain is ~2.8GB"

[16-Apr-19 07:32 PM] Malti#3948

this is a clever concept for a decentralized fiat/crypto exchange without escrow or arbitrators, added to my to-do list: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/bdetr2/daihard_the_unkillable_cryptofiat_gateway_any/

Serious post.

1) One of if not the most important factor in trading no one talks about is mental health.

I dont care how good you are at reading a chart if your mind is somewhere else due to external factors you are going to execute trades poorly.

Have any of you ever had a pinched nerve in upper back lower neck?

[17-Apr-19 12:45 AM] Lumbi#8378
@Vertigo takes way more time to heal than you would think (9+ months). a good physical therapist with electro-massage (no joke) can help.

[17-Apr-19 01:15 AM] Vertigo#0439
@Lumbi I went to the emergency room today was the worst pain I ever had specially running through my arm. I Rather be shot than that.

[17-Apr-19 02:31 AM] meatspoon#7860
I have pinched a nerve and herniated a disc in two different incidences.

[17-Apr-19 02:34 AM] Vertigo#0439
Does yours hurt like you rather be decapitated with a spoon too?

[17-Apr-19 02:34 AM] meatspoon#7860
The pinched nerve made my arm and hand go numb a few dozen times throughout the day depending on my posture.  There was not much pain.  The herniated disc was similar with the pins and needles in the hand and arm. But the there was lots of pain. Shooting, aching pain.

[17-Apr-19 02:34 AM] meatspoon#7860
It got to where I couldn‚Äôt sleep more than 3 hours or so a night

[17-Apr-19 02:35 AM] Vertigo#0439
Must be a budged disk probably.... This sucks

[17-Apr-19 02:35 AM] meatspoon#7860
A doctor can prescribe you anti inflamitories and a nerve pain.

[17-Apr-19 02:36 AM] meatspoon#7860
In the mean time, don‚Äôt ‚Äústretch‚Äù anything. I was exacerbating my situation by often stretching my neck which was further inflaming my herniated disc

[17-Apr-19 02:37 AM] meatspoon#7860
Ice the F out of it.

[17-Apr-19 02:38 AM] meatspoon#7860
Some people like to freeze a water bottle and use it as a neck pillow. That can help put traction pressure on the neck too. Positions that help gently elongate the neck can alleviate some of the pain due to inflammation.

[17-Apr-19 02:39 AM] meatspoon#7860
Go see a doc. I waited until it was nearly unbearable. If you start to lose strength in your arm, that‚Äôs a bad sign.

better to sell gradually and maybe push the price down 20%, than get average price of less than 50%
