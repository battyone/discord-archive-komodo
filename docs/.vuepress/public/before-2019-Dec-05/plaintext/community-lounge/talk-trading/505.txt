[02-Apr-19 05:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If you look at bigger timeframe volume for this pump seems to be lacking or am I wrong?

[02-Apr-19 05:35 AM] Alexfrog#1338
this is just a 'finally breaking 4200 and making all shorts cover' pump

[02-Apr-19 05:36 AM] Caglio#3337
So

[02-Apr-19 05:36 AM] Caglio#3337
Btc going up

[02-Apr-19 05:36 AM] Caglio#3337
And kmd satoshi value going down

[02-Apr-19 05:36 AM] Alexfrog#1338
btc never fails to ruin everything

[02-Apr-19 05:36 AM] Alexfrog#1338
kmd was doing well

[02-Apr-19 05:36 AM] Caglio#3337
Well was a small word

[02-Apr-19 05:36 AM] Caglio#3337
Amazing

[02-Apr-19 05:37 AM] Caglio#3337
But when btc stabilizes now

[02-Apr-19 05:37 AM] Alexfrog#1338

[02-Apr-19 05:37 AM] Caglio#3337

[02-Apr-19 05:57 AM] Alexfrog#1338
ok

[02-Apr-19 05:57 AM] Alexfrog#1338
thats a bit hostile, but whatever üòÑ

[02-Apr-19 05:58 AM] designer#4893
behind the development of computers and the Internet were the fierce battle for survival over passwords. because Bitcoin was created by the main stream of encryption technology, it isn't the one that was easy enough for economists to stop without studying.

[02-Apr-19 05:58 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
not nearly as hostile as that term

[02-Apr-19 05:59 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
'alts' is instantly dismissive of all things not BTC in that they are, and always will be, lesser than

[02-Apr-19 06:02 AM] Alexfrog#1338
so you didnt actually block me üòÑ

[02-Apr-19 06:05 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

Market cycle study through sinewave suggests the following:
- Bull market are long as one full wave length: Œª (peak to peak)
- Bear market lasts Œª/2
- Accumulation lasts Œª/2
Currently in accumulation phase.
Note:
Sinewave peaks overlap monthly macd histogram peaks

Literally how I got into mining üòõ

[02-Apr-19 07:16 AM] Tek#5253
I would try mining but taxes on electricity are 21% here, like food and electronics

[02-Apr-19 07:16 AM] Tek#5253
so I can never ever compete

[02-Apr-19 07:16 AM] Tek#5253
price is already high for electricity without taxes

[02-Apr-19 07:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
