When googling ‚Äûatomic swap‚Äú Komodo appears as 3rd which is nice

[25-Jul-19 07:40 AM] Mische#6695
So people not knowing what it is will find Komodo

Friendly reminder, that this channel is to discuss trading. Move off-topic talks in #talk-other-topics

[25-Jul-19 07:49 AM] jansako#3330
@alperC you mustn't come here too often... :abusedsmily: most of the time the convo is about other things when trading is slow...

[25-Jul-19 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant take the off-topic-trading channel away from us!

[25-Jul-19 07:50 AM] Alexfrog#1338
and when things are not slow, its just complaining that the price went down

[25-Jul-19 07:50 AM] Alexfrog#1338
theoretically, there might also be celebrating if the price went up.  but that doesnt ever actually happen üòÑ
