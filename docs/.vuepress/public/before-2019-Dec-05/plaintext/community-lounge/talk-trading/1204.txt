hard to believe they will eat the   exchanges slippage on those big buys

[11-Nov-19 11:45 AM] Mark81#4505
As chinese mining is now legitimazed then also mining hash increase should be coming from china

[11-Nov-19 11:45 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so did the hashrate increase recently?

[11-Nov-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be that doing transactions via exchange is the only practical way

[11-Nov-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
hashrate does appear to be higher in the last days

[11-Nov-19 11:47 AM] Mark81#4505
So how much is fourt biggest privacy coin marketcap as of now?

[11-Nov-19 11:49 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
though the aladdin research still groups KMD as privacy coin

[11-Nov-19 11:50 AM] Neko#5830
it mentions pirate

[11-Nov-19 11:50 AM] Mark81#4505
Also arrr has quite high hashpower. When zcash had same mining power first time it was worth couple hundred dollars at 2017.

[11-Nov-19 11:51 AM] Oszy#5734
with gpu's :p

[11-Nov-19 11:53 AM] Mark81#4505
Komodo is doing proudly its own project and not worrying 100% combatibility with other coins. It is starting to get noticed by researchers and investors.

Seems like komodo holds third place on privacy coins marketcaps

[11-Nov-19 12:08 PM] Mark81#4505
with that $20 dollar target price it would give komodo over $2.33B dollar marketcap.

correct

[11-Nov-19 12:22 PM] richardt#2807
The fact that KMD is still thought of as a privacy coin means it won't reach $20 anytime soon

[11-Nov-19 12:22 PM] Acura#2748
Which Rule says that ?

[11-Nov-19 12:27 PM] Neko#5830
monero reached over 6bi marketcap and its mainly used in the darkweb

[11-Nov-19 12:30 PM] richardt#2807
@Acura I suppose there aren't really any rules in crypto, but people are still misinformed about KMD.

[11-Nov-19 12:36 PM] richardt#2807
However, if it's true chinese investors are noticing and supporting KMD, then $20 may not be so far away

[11-Nov-19 12:57 PM] Mark81#4505
Even that komodo itself aint privacy coin it builds technology that supports invidual privacy. Ie. AtomicDex is privacy for its users.

[11-Nov-19 01:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD is not a privacy coin, it's a factory that can make privacy coins

Looks like @Bilaxy_exchange volume is the driving force behind the recent @KomodoPlatform $KMD uptick. Chinese volume and interest in KMD spiking? Price following the Chinese ratings for this undervalued gem? 🤔🚀

stand out for Komodo and Cosmos.

[11-Nov-19 02:49 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Does Komodo have any Chinese translations for all the articles posted up on the website? Or is it something being constantly worked on in the Chinese komodo groups?

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 let's combine our COMMOD, sell and then we devide

[11-Nov-19 04:29 PM] Flint#6435
coins of confidentiality receive little liquidity; as a rule, the exception is coins that have received recognition and hype, therefore, this can be a problem in the context of the position of the Chinese government regarding a similar class of assets; therefore, it is necessary to widely cover current changes in the main protocol and transfer these functions to an independent pirate chain

@SHossain @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 both of you are just screaming that you are big bagholders of last resort, right?

[11-Nov-19 04:40 PM] Mark81#4505
Are you still mining?

[11-Nov-19 04:40 PM] SHossain#0007
are you interested in buying? 🙂

[11-Nov-19 04:40 PM] SHossain#0007

[11-Nov-19 04:41 PM] SHossain#0007

[11-Nov-19 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not currently mining because of another chain, but not done mining forever, if that's what you're asking @Mark81

[11-Nov-19 04:41 PM] Mark81#4505

[11-Nov-19 04:41 PM] Mark81#4505

[11-Nov-19 04:42 PM] SHossain#0007

Barr coin might be intresting when launched on komodo platform. There is at least one big kmd whale on board.

[11-Nov-19 09:07 PM] Mark81#4505
Yes they paid antara framework launch.

[11-Nov-19 09:07 PM] Aron“XuanLeeeeee“Goldberg#3393
But Barr coin has nothing to do with commod, right?

But what if you are on the go?

[11-Nov-19 09:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I mean... Think about it... If you wanted to take a commod with you before it would be kind of embarasing

[11-Nov-19 09:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Now you can take your commod everywhere and no one will know you have it with you

[11-Nov-19 09:16 PM] mrlynch#5735

Commod should be pegged to a shitcoin index 😬
