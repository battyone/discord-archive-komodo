the problem is when you believe in the project, you always entry early

[15-Apr-19 02:51 PM] dokrates#8987
when you like the project and try to trade with a small percentage, you always fomo

[15-Apr-19 02:51 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
you can always look for other short term opps while you hodl kmd

[15-Apr-19 02:51 PM] dokrates#8987
yep, but i always spend my time reading about the 2-3 holdings i have instead of reading about other coins to trade them

[15-Apr-19 02:51 PM] dokrates#8987

Delisting a coin over social media politics? And people wonder why we have adoption issues?
