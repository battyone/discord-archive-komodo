BREAKING: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission says it will "review" Wednesday's rejection orders for 9 bitcoin ETFs. Pending the outcome of the review, the three August 22 orders have been stayed. Story to come.

@siu - Chainmakers  that is outstanding news

[24-Aug-18 06:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes... i think that finally the marketing and presentation questions can be well answered.

[24-Aug-18 06:24 PM] jspook16#3059
I agree. This might be a good time to get a few more kmd.

[24-Aug-18 06:25 PM] jspook16#3059
Hopefully they provide a timeline at some point

[24-Aug-18 06:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the work is in the starting phase.

[24-Aug-18 06:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Normally this type of project take about 6 months to materialize

[24-Aug-18 06:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so early next year KMD should be getting some great stuff out on the marketing side.

[24-Aug-18 06:27 PM] jspook16#3059
I love KMD

[24-Aug-18 06:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Expect new interfaces for agama and similar software. Also mm2.0 will be out early next year

[24-Aug-18 06:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
by next year i expect that jl777 will have a bunch of new smart contracts ready for public use

[24-Aug-18 06:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im sure 2019 will be the year that KMD will get the attention it deserves.

[24-Aug-18 06:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's getting more attention recently, after the 1M tps test + CC ready it should rank 1 or 2 on CCID based on their metrics and it will bring even more attention
