[24-Oct-18 01:14 PM] PTYX#6840
I had to buy a carrying case because it's like carrying around a small r2d2

[24-Oct-18 01:14 PM] SHossain#0007

It's a heavy mic though.

[24-Oct-18 01:29 PM] PTYX#6840
@benohanlon did you look at the Samsung track?

[24-Oct-18 01:30 PM] PTYX#6840
It's a little more expensive than the Yeti but better quality and smaller size.

[24-Oct-18 01:30 PM] PTYX#6840
Not much smaller though

@CHMEX the vrsc explorer is busted, is that your deal?

[24-Oct-18 01:42 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Thinking a push for 24k if it breaks out in my uneducated opinion

[24-Oct-18 01:43 PM] CHMEX#0686
@Hollowman9000 Yes unfortunatly the new version can't handle the indexes (yet). I should make a note there.

[24-Oct-18 01:58 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@Acura there is another resitance level at 31/32k sats from previous support level before your 46 target

[24-Oct-18 01:58 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592

[24-Oct-18 01:59 PM] blubbi#0643

[24-Oct-18 02:20 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[24-Oct-18 02:20 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
🤞

[24-Oct-18 02:21 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
and weekly pretty much

[24-Oct-18 02:26 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
https://www.tradingview.com/x/gzgqJj6M/ edge to edge on ichimoku, support /resistance levels match fibs, volume and interest provided by whale, in terms of volume profile relatively clear skies above resitance levels, RSI weekly rising and weekly MACD in positive cross

whale bro seems to be gone

[24-Oct-18 02:41 PM] Tek#5253
but KMD still moving up

[24-Oct-18 02:50 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
well he did create a technical pattern and slurped up all the selling pressure

[24-Oct-18 02:50 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
the measured move for the triangle will bring us right above the next resitance level

[24-Oct-18 02:50 PM] Tek#5253
it seems to be breaking resistance

[24-Oct-18 02:51 PM] Tek#5253
do i try to sell this peak or will I get fucked over

[24-Oct-18 02:51 PM] Tek#5253
hmmmmmmm

[24-Oct-18 02:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Dump eet

[24-Oct-18 02:52 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
don't sell now lol, if you want to play it save, set a stop loss in the triangle

[24-Oct-18 02:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Still need to recoup KMD from vrsc and arrr purchases

[24-Oct-18 02:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Dump to 16

[24-Oct-18 02:52 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
or at some sort of similar invalidation level

[24-Oct-18 02:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Time to FUD on twatter

[24-Oct-18 02:52 PM] Tek#5253
I bought most between 17k and 20k so selling now seems a good idea

[24-Oct-18 02:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
DPoW got hacked

[24-Oct-18 02:52 PM] Tek#5253

[24-Oct-18 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Hollowman9000 is on the redneck juice again 😛

[24-Oct-18 02:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 95% attacked KMD with 40,000 z9 miners, all exchange cold wallets emptied

[24-Oct-18 02:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
This is the end

[24-Oct-18 02:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Dump while you still can

[24-Oct-18 02:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Situation will only be better after hitting 12k sats

[24-Oct-18 03:00 PM] Tek#5253

[24-Oct-18 03:00 PM] Tek#5253
really testing my patience

[24-Oct-18 03:03 PM] Tek#5253
Maybe I should have gotten more BCH instead of XMR

[24-Oct-18 03:03 PM] Tek#5253
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

[24-Oct-18 03:04 PM] BlockTech#6895

73Pi transfered in another 400k some hours ago

[24-Oct-18 03:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Pirate is better than XMR, soon all will come to realize this

[24-Oct-18 03:08 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@Tek here is what a trade setup could look like: https://www.tradingview.com/x/DEfZAwFh/ the 4h candle will close in 1h above triangle, unless it starts dumping like crazy, doubt it though, for that you usually place a stop loss at invalidation level of your trade setup

[24-Oct-18 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
