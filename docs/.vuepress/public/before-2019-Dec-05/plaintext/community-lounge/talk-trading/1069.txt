Although the Sahara seems a perfect place for solar (pv) panels, due to the environmental heat they're less efficient than when placed in more moderate climates. Solar towers on the other hand with a mirror system to focus the sunbeams are more efficient...

[13-Aug-19 03:28 PM] Caglio#3337
Or, just rob someone who has big mining rigs

[13-Aug-19 03:28 PM] Caglio#3337
It costs much less

[13-Aug-19 03:46 PM] Markus#5464
