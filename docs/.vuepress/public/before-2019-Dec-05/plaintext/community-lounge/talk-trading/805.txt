[22-Jun-19 12:34 AM] Tek#5253

[22-Jun-19 12:34 AM] yorklab#7270
I still think if ETH ICO was waved then others will have a chance at being waved also.

[22-Jun-19 12:35 AM] Tek#5253
any ICO that was birthed on ETH tho

[22-Jun-19 12:35 AM] Tek#5253

The atmosphere in here is so relaxed without him.

[22-Jun-19 12:46 AM] meatspoon#7860
I hope he didn‚Äôt expire in a session of autoerotic asphyxiation.

[22-Jun-19 12:49 AM] dxer666#8963

Kmd that is

[22-Jun-19 01:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
just wait for the next multi million dollar solidity exploit. Eth is a dumpster fire surrounded with rainbows

[22-Jun-19 01:37 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Eth will go to ath even with their faulty shit

[22-Jun-19 01:37 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im in

[22-Jun-19 01:38 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
No one knows what crypto might gain in satoshis

[22-Jun-19 01:38 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Kmd will do a lower low before doing something relevant

[22-Jun-19 01:38 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
But if you just throw a dart on like top 30 coins and diversify, you will get more dollars

[22-Jun-19 01:38 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
That is like the dummy guide

[22-Jun-19 01:39 AM] actionslacks#4072
I played that game in 2017. I think the 20x days will be a bit fewer and farther between this time

[22-Jun-19 01:40 AM] actionslacks#4072

[22-Jun-19 01:40 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Well i still think there are still so many people who never traded coins other than like MAYBE btc

[22-Jun-19 01:40 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If your throw it on the lower 30 to 50 top coins youll get some other chances

[22-Jun-19 01:40 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Most peeps never bought shitcoins

[22-Jun-19 01:41 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
And most sold during 2018

[22-Jun-19 01:41 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Very few holds shitcoins

[22-Jun-19 01:42 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Btc is just like the entrance drug towards shitcoins

[22-Jun-19 01:43 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Some like coke, some like crack

[22-Jun-19 01:43 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Others like lsd, or extasis

[22-Jun-19 01:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im sure there are a couple of crypto people doing all 4 at once üòÇ

[22-Jun-19 01:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
