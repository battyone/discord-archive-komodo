1) there is only like 2 channels that never went "off topic" and #talk-other-topics is one of them
2) it impacts trade values more than you think

We want to keep talking about our +-1 cent movement in binance

ohh.. you meant THIS drama, LOL

[04-Jan-19 12:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
come on, this is not about KMD, this is about open source licensing

[04-Jan-19 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
iirc it was specifically about 3rd party kmd txes

[04-Jan-19 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
as the author of the code (hyperdex) have all the right to bitch about someone forking and not following rules.

[04-Jan-19 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its part of open source.

[04-Jan-19 12:27 PM] dokrates#8987
my 2cents about the conversation is: You create something, but the credits about it are related to the ego, the ego is an illusion of the mind, all of us gonna die. So if you create something and another steals it, don't care, you created it, you will keep mantaining it, so sooner or later everyone will know you're the creater, therefor your product will be innovative and better in essential, unless they keep stealing all of your updates 😄

[04-Jan-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
first of all, who forked what?

[04-Jan-19 12:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Everyone here is saying what safecoin did to Komodo was justified....

[04-Jan-19 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
http://oss-watch.ac.uk/apps/licdiff/
ffiw: MIT was a piss-poor coice (and is for almost everything)

[04-Jan-19 12:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That is what you are arguing for.

[04-Jan-19 12:29 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Safecoin people are already punished by buying it

[04-Jan-19 12:29 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
did they fork Hypedex too?

[04-Jan-19 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Everyone here is saying what safecoin did to Komodo was justified....`
Short of thier claims to make it "better" and blaming Komodo for the actions of 3rd parties, yes

[04-Jan-19 12:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
No they stole the KMD code and did not mention KMD. Everyone got pissed at that, i didnt see CG blaming James for that right?

[04-Jan-19 12:29 PM] dokrates#8987
wow, conversation is getting bigger and bigger, @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you created a tsunami 😂

[04-Jan-19 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`No they stole the KMD code and did not mention KMD.`
They forked it, not "stole it" and they mentioned Komodo quite often...

[04-Jan-19 12:30 PM] dokrates#8987
you can put the code in bitcoin blockchain once you created it, so you will have a timestamp of it :trollface:

💯 

[04-Jan-19 12:30 PM] hyperDEX#6586
No James made them put that in....

I saw a presentation one of their team members did at a conference and they mentioned KMD, they just said that we charged for dPOW and they would somehow make it free for everyone... no idea how.

[04-Jan-19 12:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
When they forked it they made no mention of KMD anywhere. Then James got them to add it in.

[04-Jan-19 12:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
What you mentioned was after trying to justify it

[04-Jan-19 12:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
well, if they complied then there is no issue.

[04-Jan-19 12:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`no idea how`
If you read their twats, by claiming that a split tx is a notarization 😂

[04-Jan-19 12:33 PM] hyperDEX#6586
They did not follow MIT again

[04-Jan-19 12:33 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So it is the same argument

[04-Jan-19 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@dokrates  I am doing exactly that with #kmdlabs one we have launch version completed... streamign it into a blockchain dpow against KMD->BTC. no one can steal it then.

[04-Jan-19 12:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
unless komodo is willing to take legal action agains it, there is not much more that can be done

[04-Jan-19 12:34 PM] dokrates#8987
@blackjok3r that is smart

[04-Jan-19 12:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
ok, so what is the issue? It's another nail in their coffin showing they are morons, call them out about it if they dare to say anything bad again

First go at STAKED streamer over real internet!
Seems there might have been a small chunk of the file missing off the end, I need to investigate, however all the data in the TGZ extracted and was received ...

@KomodoWorld The issue here is blaming James for using MIT and knowing that people may not abide by the license rules.

[04-Jan-19 12:36 PM] hyperDEX#6586
He is a sucker for spending thousands of hours of his time and using MIT

[04-Jan-19 12:36 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I don't know well the difference between licenses

[04-Jan-19 12:36 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That is the argument @compilate is making. He is justify the actions of the safecoin crew because people are bad....

`The issue here is blaming James for using MIT and knowing that people may not abide by the license rules.`
The issue here is exactly **not** that; it would be that if james went on and on about how much $ he spent *and* was only mad because they made $ and he didn't

[04-Jan-19 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
BTC is MIT so you cant get around ti I dont think

[04-Jan-19 12:37 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The only rule of MIT is to leave the copyright of the project you are forking from.

{Reactions}
👍 (2) 

[04-Jan-19 12:37 PM] hyperDEX#6586
ONLY RULE

[04-Jan-19 12:37 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yet they dont follow that and @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 blames me for saying they did not follow the rule and me wanting them to do so

[04-Jan-19 12:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if they did comply after pointing it out then its no issue

[04-Jan-19 12:39 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That is not the point. Blaming the victim is the problem.

[04-Jan-19 12:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`blames me for saying they did not follow the rule and me wanting them to do so`
No I blame you for picking the weakest license on the planet and crying because they made $ without putting your name in a feken 10MB min file that no one is ever going to feken look at

[04-Jan-19 12:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it shows how rookie they are, but other than that it would be up to komodo to make a legal case.

[04-Jan-19 12:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
get over yourself and go on

[04-Jan-19 12:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Who blamed the victim?

[04-Jan-19 12:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_did (sort of)_

[04-Jan-19 12:40 PM] hyperDEX#6586
You and a few of your mates.

[04-Jan-19 12:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
who is the victim?

http://oss-watch.ac.uk/apps/licdiff/
let me know if you find a set of answers that says MIT is a good idea (meanwhile I'm in 🛀🏽 )

[04-Jan-19 12:41 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I am done. My biggest mistake is investing my own money to get more utility for KMD to make it more valuable. I am sure there are people willing to contribute their time and hire world class devs to do things people think are too hard.

[04-Jan-19 12:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but if BTC is MIT and also ZCASH are, then KMD has to be MIT too, i dont think you can change that.

[04-Jan-19 12:42 PM] hyperDEX#6586
He is blaming me for someone stealing the ledger interest claim app because i put it as MIT

[04-Jan-19 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`My biggest mistake is investing my own money to get more utility for KMD to make it more valuable. `
It's exactly **not** that, your biggest mistake is believing that a license file has magical properties that will stop someone else from making $ off your investment

[04-Jan-19 12:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ohh

[04-Jan-19 12:43 PM] hyperDEX#6586
You are such a delusional person @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 .

[04-Jan-19 12:43 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
they forked the ledger claim app?

[04-Jan-19 12:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but does the interest claim app is profitable?

[04-Jan-19 12:43 PM] hyperDEX#6586
They did and stole the code

[04-Jan-19 12:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
stole?

[04-Jan-19 12:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no credit?

[04-Jan-19 12:44 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Copy/paste portions of it

[04-Jan-19 12:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`stole the code`
one cannot "steal" open source code
because, "open"

[04-Jan-19 12:44 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Lets not forget the fact that my dev got ledger to change their end to make the code work

[04-Jan-19 12:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but to use it with KMD too?

[04-Jan-19 12:45 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That is something even the KMD could not do

[04-Jan-19 12:45 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes basically to beat us to the same solution @siu - Chainmakers

[04-Jan-19 12:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im not getting this... is the app making a profit off claiming interest?

[04-Jan-19 12:45 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes we are hoping to get a % of the claimed amount

[04-Jan-19 12:45 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That was to be used to fund for devs

[04-Jan-19 12:46 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We asked for donations, we got less than 1 KMD from the community

[04-Jan-19 12:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and the "stolen" version is to claim KMD interest too?

[04-Jan-19 12:46 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So this was our last option

[04-Jan-19 12:46 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes

[04-Jan-19 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_looks for his name in the credits since he explained the difference of sapling lock times_

[04-Jan-19 12:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
which app is being used more?

[04-Jan-19 12:47 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I think what most people dont realize is that i got KMD listed on Ledger by buying 50 units at that time, half the money from me and half from James. These were given out to the community.

[04-Jan-19 12:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i dont use ledger so im not aware of this.

[04-Jan-19 12:47 PM] hyperDEX#6586
None yet because it would not have worked

[04-Jan-19 12:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i didnt get one... 😦

[04-Jan-19 12:47 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Luke just fixed the code for the hardfork

[04-Jan-19 12:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and the "stolen" version got updated too?

[04-Jan-19 12:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Just waiting for Ledger to upgrade

[04-Jan-19 12:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
They never got it working, PTYX tweeted that they had "solved" the ledger claim issue.

[04-Jan-19 12:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But it would not have worked until ledger merged the changes luke did

[04-Jan-19 12:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
wait, so the forked version is from chainzilla?

[04-Jan-19 12:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Na Magnum wallet or something?

[04-Jan-19 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
All I see is a bunch of "I..." "I..." "I..." "...money..." "I..." "I..."  "...money..." "...money..." "...money..." "I..." "I..." "...money..." "I..." and not how it matters to the ecosystem....

[04-Jan-19 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Na Magnum wallet or something?`
exactly the crux of the issue, WalletA vs WalletB

[04-Jan-19 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🛀🏽

[04-Jan-19 12:51 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I do not need to justify how much I have contributed to this project. The people that need to know, already know.

[04-Jan-19 12:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but magnum wallet is a closed source for profit wallet.

[04-Jan-19 12:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that makes a difference i guess.

[04-Jan-19 12:55 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We have proof that they just ripped portions of our code. Once we get it working, this will solve a problem the team has had for years and the community has been longing.

[04-Jan-19 12:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if they took open source code without credit and used to for closed source code to profit from it, then yes... it is a violation of the license and i think its legally liable.

[04-Jan-19 12:56 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I just cannot see how i am to blame trying to bring something for the community that will help to fund further community projects.

[04-Jan-19 12:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
agama code has been used for so many things too.
