I never promised any CHIPS tech to be done this year, it looks like next year before it is ready, so that is why we are solving the lack of miner issue at this time.

[31-Aug-18 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
also to be fair, I think it should be acknowledged that the problem was identified and then fixed pretty quickly: http://chips.komodochainz.info/

[31-Aug-18 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but as a side project, I am not making CHIPS my primary project, and it is up to other devs to make progress on it

[31-Aug-18 03:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Someone seems to be marketbuying a ton on binance atm

[31-Aug-18 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
CHIPS is on binance?

[31-Aug-18 03:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sadly no, but kmd is 😃

[31-Aug-18 03:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I can say i know a couple of people with deep pockets that are finally grasping what kmd is

cc, assetchains, all that aside, dpow is just so understated in the current price

[31-Aug-18 03:50 PM] dan.#2473
likely wont come to light until btc does actually moon and people are looking for btc-level security but cannot afford to do so

[31-Aug-18 04:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Everyone and their brother is shorting bitcoin

[31-Aug-18 09:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Pump to $7500

[31-Aug-18 09:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You heard it here first

[31-Aug-18 10:47 PM] Alright#0419
did anything significant happen to DOGE?

[31-Aug-18 11:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Surprised it’s still around tbh

[31-Aug-18 11:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yeah it was funny meme shitcoin

[31-Aug-18 11:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then it became “the joke that got serious”

[31-Aug-18 11:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But it’s still a shitcoin

[31-Aug-18 11:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I wouldn’t buy it or accept it in trade

[31-Aug-18 11:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The only accolades I’ll give is it was a means to exit cryptsy right before the end

[31-Aug-18 11:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
When everything else didn’t work for withdraws

[31-Aug-18 11:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Dump exchange shitcoin for exchange bitcoin, buy exchange dogecoin with said bitcoin, actually get to withdraw from an exchange hot wallet that still had funds

[31-Aug-18 11:34 PM] crumb#2550
i'm also curious about the DOGE move up about 50% on Bittrex as i type this

[31-Aug-18 11:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Gate.io USDT leads the doge volume

[31-Aug-18 11:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Calling shenanigans right now

[31-Aug-18 11:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
May be the kick off of a legit alt season

[31-Aug-18 11:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
BTC has too much volume and can’t be manipulated

[31-Aug-18 11:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Gents, enter doge

[31-Aug-18 11:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Coworker today (no idea I am a cryptoaddict) starts talking about BTC, he got $1k worth for no fee using @RobinhoodApp.  He also said he bought $1k of DOGE because it's so cheap vs. BTC ... I am therefore starting a DOGE stack, because this is apparently what newbs are loo...

i miss the troll box.....maybe something similar can be added to barterdex/hyperdex?

[01-Sep-18 06:18 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
someone wrote DOGE is now tradeble on yahoo finance or sth ... but maybe old news?

[01-Sep-18 06:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  figured out how to have an onchain troll box for barterdex using KV, but hasnt been implemented.

[01-Sep-18 09:57 AM] actionslacks#4072

because people want to trade DOGE equivalent on ETH at $5 gas costs, its so much fun

[01-Sep-18 12:17 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
would be nice coincidence if on the 1 million block there would be also confirmation from whiteblock on 1mln TPS

Anyone understand what dogex is? Is it going to be an Eth token?

[01-Sep-18 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
you get to lock real DOGE and get ETH DOGE, get to pay ETH gas fees for transacting in ETH DOGE and a bit more converting back to real DOGE

[01-Sep-18 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
seems nobody outside of testers will actually do this

[01-Sep-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
but we could have the signal that the bear will go into hibernation for a while. DOGE doubling on nonsensical reason, everything on CMC in the green during the weekend, signals the individual non-institutional purchasing is back

[01-Sep-18 06:24 PM] jspook16#3059
lol dogex is bringing alt season back? thanks for insight @jl777c

[01-Sep-18 06:25 PM] jspook16#3059
I dont understand why they would be ok with such high transaction fees?

[01-Sep-18 06:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
average tx fees are never higher than the average user is willing to pay

[01-Sep-18 07:32 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also gox rehab is a good sign (maybe they will not dump the rest on the market)

[01-Sep-18 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
DOGE txfee is about 0.01 USD

[01-Sep-18 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
seems unlikely DOGE users will pay 500x normal fees

Can someone make a dApp where you have 2 people who send funds into a smart contract, and the one who sent the higher amount takes the pot? 😂

[02-Sep-18 07:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
I mean itd be pretty fun to arc up to the cocky people claiming to be whales by challenging them, or even one of those raffle like games where theres a pot, and the more you put in the higher chance you have of taking the pot

"Harpoon the whale" randomly matched up with someone else in the round and the bigger deposit wins 😮 could be a people putting small amounts hoping to win the smaller stakes, or people going all in hoping to take down someone else whos all in 😀

[02-Sep-18 08:15 AM] PHBA2061#2530
but who will send first ? I'll wait for the other  guy to send his fund first, he will probably do the same thing & both end up not sending anything
