Anything can happen as long as Tether can run their show with nobody stopping it

[21-Aug-19 05:50 PM] Neko#5830
in tether we trust

[21-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Caglio#3337
in k64 we trust

not buying more without reversal confirmation

[21-Aug-19 06:28 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Well it's already being eaten

[21-Aug-19 06:38 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That will happen.   Fundamentals have not changed and progress has been demonstrated so not worried about current market action.   I do wonder what people will do and how they will react when traders focus shifts to Dex .  Not something that can easily be tracked via cmc and like sites.

[21-Aug-19 06:41 PM] Markus#5464
one thing that worry me with dex is that anyone can create a stable coin and mint 100 million of it and pump the hell out of any coin as long as ppl recognize the coin and know its a stable coin

[21-Aug-19 06:41 PM] Markus#5464
most of ppl dont care to even bother finding out if its actually backed or not

[21-Aug-19 06:42 PM] Markus#5464
read a article that whales dont care if Tether is backed or not they will use it anyway

[21-Aug-19 06:42 PM] Markus#5464
So who says u cant create a stable coin backed by air

[21-Aug-19 06:50 PM] Neko#5830
@polycryptoblog it will be the end of shitcoin and fake volulme

[21-Aug-19 06:50 PM] Neko#5830
as we know it

[21-Aug-19 07:04 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Markus  well it does run afoul of securities law and possible fraud.   But you are correct,  nothing stops anyone.  that is why the SEC and similar orgs are scrutinizing algorithmic based stablecoins with no asset backing.

As stablecoins see greater capital inflows and adoption, regulators will likely take a harder look at their compliance status.

Cc-peg and several other methods of stablecoins might prove fruitful in the future

[21-Aug-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems that decentralized solutions end up in regulatory safe harbors, likely due to the problem of enforcing against individual users. its one thing to go after companies running centralized solutions, another to go after individuals en masse, who could well be voters

[21-Aug-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
so decentralization isnt just a good ideal to strive for, it appears to have regulatory benefits also

[21-Aug-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
and maybe this is no coincidence, as with a decentralized solution there isnt trust placed in a single organization with control over the funds

[21-Aug-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
as we see with the CB ARRR token, centralized tokens even if used on a decentralized blockchain, end up devolving to trusting the issuer

In terms of money related stablecoins it does appear the only way to go is decentralized in all aspects like @jl777c said .  I think though we will see a class of stablecoins that does rely on trusted parties but has a clear and common legal structure to deal with issues that arise .   Merchants using blockchains directly for commerce for example,  not in the sense of using crypto to pay for goods, but that the merchants inventory is directly interact-able with customers via atomic swaps.   Basically will be a workaround to not being able to barter physical goods through digital media,  but you can barter titles through digital media.    Consignment would be another example of a stablecoin class.

has anybody been tracking the hacker's funds? i'm curious to know if that big amount is still on the move

[22-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Alright#0419
still moving *some* in just about every block

[22-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Alright#0419
a bit overkill at this point

[22-Aug-19 05:12 PM] jorian#4555
has he been dumping the price to shit?

[22-Aug-19 05:12 PM] jorian#4555
probably

[22-Aug-19 05:12 PM] jorian#4555
and bear ain't over yet

[22-Aug-19 05:12 PM] jorian#4555
or alt-season hasn't started yet, better said

[22-Aug-19 05:13 PM] Alright#0419
Well... I tried to ban the coins, but I was told it was too centralized -_-

[22-Aug-19 05:13 PM] Alright#0419
so....

[22-Aug-19 05:13 PM] jorian#4555

[22-Aug-19 05:20 PM] PTYX#6840
alt-season lol

[22-Aug-19 05:20 PM] PTYX#6840
that was over in 2017. we will not likely see any significant rise in general alt-coin value. BTC will stay on top and it will keep pushing everything down.

[22-Aug-19 05:21 PM] jorian#4555
not in the near future no

[22-Aug-19 05:22 PM] jorian#4555
all hail king BTC

[22-Aug-19 05:22 PM] PTYX#6840
the coins that will sustain value will be very few

[22-Aug-19 05:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also asked myself how much was dumped of the hacked funds

[22-Aug-19 05:22 PM] jorian#4555
the great flush still needs to happen

[22-Aug-19 05:22 PM] PTYX#6840
and it will likely be due to high speculation or high value propositions

[22-Aug-19 05:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Should be a fair amount at this point

[22-Aug-19 05:23 PM] PTYX#6840
95% of altcoins have no value proposition and no revenue models. and some of them are now running on vapors with all their ICO funds burned up

[22-Aug-19 05:23 PM] PTYX#6840
that's unfortunately where the corps will pick up and use the best parts of the tech to create or revamp other things.

[22-Aug-19 05:23 PM] Alright#0419
the amounts still being moved constantly are very small compared to what it initially was

[22-Aug-19 05:24 PM] Alright#0419
so either was satisfied they wouldn't be tracked(doesn't really matter anyway) or dumped most of it

[22-Aug-19 05:24 PM] PTYX#6840
probably damp for btc

[22-Aug-19 05:25 PM] jorian#4555
how much was it again? 7 million?

[22-Aug-19 05:25 PM] PTYX#6840
not sure actually

[22-Aug-19 05:26 PM] Alright#0419
no, not even close

[22-Aug-19 05:26 PM] Alright#0419
verifiable amount was like 800k KMD

[22-Aug-19 05:27 PM] jorian#4555
ah

[22-Aug-19 05:27 PM] Alright#0419
doesn't mean there wasn't more

[22-Aug-19 05:27 PM] Alright#0419
*verifiable*

[22-Aug-19 05:27 PM] Markus#5464
so what is argument that kmds price will rise against btc in the future?

[22-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Alright#0419
it might go up

[22-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Alright#0419
it might also go down

[22-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Alright#0419
#talk-trading

[22-Aug-19 05:28 PM] jorian#4555
yeah, though the trend has been down

[22-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Markus#5464
so lets say kmds price goes to hell, valueation will be pretty much nothing......lets say 1 cent

[22-Aug-19 05:29 PM] Markus#5464
what will drive kmd team to keep motivation up?

[22-Aug-19 05:29 PM] jorian#4555
to me, the team is still building, even more than when the price was at 3$

[22-Aug-19 05:29 PM] jorian#4555
1 cent is reaaally low

[22-Aug-19 05:30 PM] Markus#5464
I mean making all this tech and then see ur coin go to literally zero

[22-Aug-19 05:30 PM] Markus#5464
how would kmd leverage the tech then for its advantage in the eco system?

[22-Aug-19 05:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you get paid in KMD you have to sell it to buy food

[22-Aug-19 05:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
etc

[22-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Markus#5464
at that point most of eco system coins probably are already gone cause they cant keep up with coins not having any value

[22-Aug-19 05:32 PM] Markus#5464
how would projects manage to survive in such situation

There's probably one project making constant revenue/profit in the ecosystem and that's Chainzilla. I'm not sure that even redfox has a revenue stream yet.
