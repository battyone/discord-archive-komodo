[17-Feb-19 04:04 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Well it all depends in what happens in the next hours

[17-Feb-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
better if it stabilizes in the 2300 to 2500 range so it has stronger foundation to climb higher

I think it all depends on a daily close basis

[17-Feb-19 04:09 PM] Wazzup#0510
If we get it

[17-Feb-19 04:09 PM] Wazzup#0510
any pullback into the old range is for buyinh

[17-Feb-19 04:09 PM] Wazzup#0510

[17-Feb-19 04:12 PM] Wazzup#0510
Yeah, it s bullish nonetheless, but buying a breakout is not a healthy habit imo, unless you know how to time it. That's why I encourage confirmation.

[17-Feb-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, wait till 30k to buy

[17-Feb-19 04:13 PM] Wazzup#0510
Good example is the range itself. Every push got stronger and there were definetly people buying them "breakouts" at this lvl

[17-Feb-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
but if this is a bullrun, then buying on 15% to 20% pullbacks from high could do ok

[17-Feb-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
but if this is just a trap, then you will need to wait for the real bull run

[17-Feb-19 04:14 PM] Wazzup#0510

The good thing about crypto is that is not regulated...the trading part is very good as old school Wall street
