It’s a nightmare,  luckily was able to get most what I had out of the wallet but even with giving them dox still are holding like 200k etn of mine .  Just haven’t had to time to fight them on it

[09-Jul-19 11:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Well time to point them at Dero,  use it to get more pirate.

[09-Jul-19 11:42 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
How does that work

[09-Jul-19 11:42 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
The wallet locked your coins due to KYC?

[09-Jul-19 11:45 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

[09-Jul-19 11:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
From where

[09-Jul-19 11:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Are we talking an exchange or the wallet

[09-Jul-19 11:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
They have ridiculous requirements with their webwallet.   https://my.electroneum.com

[09-Jul-19 11:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is the webwallet the only wallet

[09-Jul-19 11:47 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
They only have a cli outside of that

[09-Jul-19 11:47 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I was using that for a bit but fell prey to convienence .

[09-Jul-19 11:48 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Was KYC sprung on you after the fact, Tezos style?

[09-Jul-19 11:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No, it was always KYC , but the ridiculous limits were sudden

[09-Jul-19 11:50 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
And you can’t export your privkeys I take it

[09-Jul-19 11:50 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Nope

[09-Jul-19 11:50 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It’s a centralized coin

[09-Jul-19 11:51 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[09-Jul-19 12:03 PM] meatspoon#7860
Lol, I “mine” ETN with a couple old android mobiles.  I never throw old devices away or sell them.  I immediately sell for BTC or ETH every dinky payout.

[09-Jul-19 12:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
I have watched the price of that shitcoin plummet for so long. Free satoshis, tho. So I ain’t complainin’.

Kmd price isn't budging.... Pamp it

[09-Jul-19 12:16 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@meatspoon  they are centralizing mining and cutting BR by 75% .   It’s got a huge supply already but typically those factors are positive for price.  Less dumpage on market

[09-Jul-19 12:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
@polycryptoblog Yeah, i dont keep up with any of the project's news or anything.  I just collect a few coins from the simulated mobile miners and sell them.  Something for my old devices to do that is productive.

One thought came to my mind today, Bitfinex says 1B has been reserved.....but they dont have anywhere near that figure as a example (did they get 1B in tether come in?), then they open markets, they pump it and get people to buy the LEO to fund their shortfall. By having a premium and selling it above $1 they basically making 200M for free.

[09-Jul-19 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Is there verifiable evidence that USDT is any different? Or is it still "trust us because an undisclosed auditor has agreed that we have undisclosed funds"?
