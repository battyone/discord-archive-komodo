Tek gets a kick out of bullying. Quite sad. I hope he'll find help at some point in life.

[06-Sep-19 05:04 PM] CoinKing88#1540

[06-Sep-19 05:04 PM] CoinKing88#1540

[06-Sep-19 05:08 PM] Tek#5253
I don't need help.

[06-Sep-19 05:08 PM] Tek#5253
You do.

[06-Sep-19 05:08 PM] Tek#5253
if someone attacks me am I not allowed to defend myself?

[06-Sep-19 05:08 PM] Tek#5253
@BanHammer you r just another super pleb.

[06-Sep-19 05:09 PM] BanHammer#8115
Tek is the kind of guy that beats his wife and then claims she deserves it. Always criticizing someone else, but gets mad if he gets criticized

[06-Sep-19 05:10 PM] Tek#5253
When you assume you make an ass out of you and me.

[06-Sep-19 05:10 PM] Tek#5253
All what you are throwing at me is actually your issues.

[06-Sep-19 05:10 PM] Tek#5253
You don't know anything about me.

[06-Sep-19 05:11 PM] tolken#2655
Stop trading punches, trade crypto! ðŸ˜ƒ

[06-Sep-19 05:12 PM] BanHammer#8115
All that I know about you is trash talking. You've created that image for yourself

[06-Sep-19 05:13 PM] BanHammer#8115
usually I would just ignore it, but you're embarrassing me as a fellow Dutchman

[06-Sep-19 05:14 PM] BanHammer#8115
in other news: yay Atomic DEX public beta is out!

[06-Sep-19 05:16 PM] Tek#5253
All I know about the KMD trading channel is people being assholes when I share news about other coins that are good.

[06-Sep-19 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[06-Sep-19 05:18 PM] Tek#5253
