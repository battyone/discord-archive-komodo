Donner Party
The Donner Party (sometimes called the Donner‚ÄìReed Party) was a group of American pioneers who migrated to California in a wagon train from the Midwest. Delayed by a series of mishaps, they spent the winter of 1846‚Äì47 snowbound in the Sierra Nevada. Some of the migrants r...

[06-Aug-19 06:31 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
don't know the price of this transaction, how much enthusiasm everyone has to participate in the test promotion

[06-Aug-19 06:37 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Many of my friends have lost their enthusiasm
Everyone is involved in the project not to lose money, but to hope for project development.
Maybe some friends disagree, but I am telling the truth.
very sad

[06-Aug-19 07:04 AM] Markus#5464
Hope for development?

[06-Aug-19 07:05 AM] Markus#5464
there is no development in kmd?

[06-Aug-19 07:05 AM] Markus#5464
:troll_lol:

[06-Aug-19 07:05 AM] scytale#8488
a lot of development going on here

[06-Aug-19 07:05 AM] Markus#5464
Probably the project with most development going on

[06-Aug-19 07:05 AM] scytale#8488

The team can't see our discussion, only focus on technology, not on the market

[06-Aug-19 07:17 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Without a good market, who knows the best technology?

Everyone thinks that the technical work of the KMD team is excellent.

more when you take out things that arent real cryptos like stablecoins

[06-Aug-19 08:09 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@coingirl87 wait for btc drop and you will see what happens than to your USD value. But the team really has nothing to do with the price , when lern ???

[06-Aug-19 08:10 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Every one and their bots get on btc train

[06-Aug-19 08:10 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Until they switch

[06-Aug-19 08:18 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
However, when the price of BTC drops, KMD is also falling.

[06-Aug-19 08:19 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Ofc nobody wants to loose massive USD value lmao

[06-Aug-19 08:19 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
The bots neither

[06-Aug-19 08:19 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Ratio rises though

[06-Aug-19 08:19 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Just not as much as USD loose value

[06-Aug-19 08:19 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Probably

[06-Aug-19 08:22 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
hope that there will be good news to renew enthusiasm.

[06-Aug-19 08:23 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
I believe that will also promote the development of DEX.

`However, when the price of BTC drops, KMD is also falling.` not always true, otherwise  kmd won't be even in top 100

[06-Aug-19 08:42 AM] coingirl87#6489
The fact that bots dump komodo price tells us what??

Correct...noone cares about komodo because nobody know of komodo.

Thats product of marketing. Tech is one side but markering the other side

Always the same subject from you @coingirl87 .
And every time you were told again and again the reasons why.
How many times do you want us to explain it to you?

[06-Aug-19 08:50 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
so much salt in here., you can feel the toxicity in the air. ppl bought more than they dared to lose. The greed is real. blaming others is stupid. you made the decision to buy, take responsibility. Sell now if you can't handle it, limit your loss, stay in btc

Every  trade  have  both side.  If  bots  and  weak hands sell ,  somebody buys .  I think  whales  use  Binance  OTC,  same as  with BTC  last year        https://i.postimg.cc/sXMWd4gq/otc.png
