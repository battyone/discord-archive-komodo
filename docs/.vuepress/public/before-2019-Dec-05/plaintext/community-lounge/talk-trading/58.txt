riiiight, like JL69 is someone that is valuable to the authoritaaaays?

[20-Jul-18 02:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Only anonymous person in the team is jl777

[20-Jul-18 02:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
All others a known people

[20-Jul-18 02:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You can meet them at the next meeting

[20-Jul-18 02:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
not true.  I remember reading updates on how they hired several people that only had first names

[20-Jul-18 02:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So?

[20-Jul-18 02:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
hahahahahahaha

[20-Jul-18 02:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
oh my god

[20-Jul-18 02:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You know them... they are real people

[20-Jul-18 02:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Are you conflicting a username with a real name?

[20-Jul-18 02:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
I know them, they are real people because a post says they have a first name?!?!

[20-Jul-18 02:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So now people cant use usernames in the internet?

[20-Jul-18 02:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Who are you?

[20-Jul-18 02:11 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
This subject of James being anonymous has been coming up for years. He's not once ran away and we still have a working product to use. That's more than most other coins can say.

of course they can.  JL74 can chat in whatever chat room he likes.  It becomes sketchy when he starts trying to raise money for esoteric tech while hiding behind anonymity

[20-Jul-18 02:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Wtf

[20-Jul-18 02:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, ill stop feeding the trolls.

Price os near a bottom guys... beefcake here is living proof of it

[20-Jul-18 02:12 PM] Meyse#0952
you are probably mad because the price is dumping, but you cant blame it on the devs or whoever else. it just is what it is.

[20-Jul-18 02:14 PM] freakbros#9074
Hey meathead don‚Äôt go away mad just fucking go away

[20-Jul-18 02:18 PM] grumpygoron#4320
The conversation definitely took a turn away from civil but let‚Äôs please not just shout at anyone with concerns.  If we finally do reach a point of more widespread adoption these questions will become more common from new investors.  If they just get shouted at they will leave.  Questions and concerns aren‚Äôt bad guys, if we‚Äôre unable to answer them we‚Äôre only validating the issues.

there are questions and questions though üòõ

[20-Jul-18 02:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Concerns about one dev being anonymous takes away the hard work many non anonymous people are doing

[20-Jul-18 02:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
For example barterdex is now in the hands of Artem Pikulin, he is not anonymous

[20-Jul-18 02:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Jl777 basically just makes ideas become realities and then other non anonymous people take the lead

[20-Jul-18 02:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hyperdex team is not anonymous

[20-Jul-18 02:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Barterdex gui dev is not anonymous

[20-Jul-18 02:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The whole support and marketing teams are not anonymous

[20-Jul-18 02:28 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Agreed.  And again as I said the conversation took a turn but the focus didn‚Äôt begin with that.  I‚Äôm fine with the anonymous side of things.  I‚Äôve just been following Komodo through Slack and Discord for a little over a year now and have noticed a trend of people having basic questions only to get shouted at and told ‚Äújust sell then‚Äù.  Concerns that are brought up here don‚Äôt seem to be welcome which is concerning when we are working towards a stronger public presence and general awareness

[20-Jul-18 02:28 PM] grumpygoron#4320
We want more investors but it typically becomes the current investors who scare the new/potential investors away

[20-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Meyse#0952
yeah, no one needs the "when moon" investors

[20-Jul-18 02:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Marketing... yes... its an issue... when will we see fruition of current work beig done, i dont know

[20-Jul-18 02:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Anonymous... come on... you are in crypto world. You are not buying penny stocks.

[20-Jul-18 02:32 PM] yorklab#7270
There will always be criticism, and in a bad market it will get amplified. Not everyone is going to agree, but you still have to remain civil. If someone does not agree that's fine, leave it at that. There are many who are only observers here who will benefit from the answers.

Indeed for some reason the interest in kmd is low.. overlooked or on purpose left aside.. who will tell.
As with all type of investment.. do not put ALL your money on the same horse. Im buying ZEN, ETC, BTC, ZEC...

$VEN: -83%
$WAN: -80%
$STRAT: -88%
$KMD: -89%

If that's not the depression phase, then I don't know it anymore. Good times ahead.

we can pack up our shit and move to EOS

[20-Jul-18 02:43 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the fact is that the marketing team is working on important partnerships and finding projects with real world use-cases (as a matter of fact Kmd is one of the few that can take real uses now).  All this work is not much eye-catching, not at all, it's all done silently without shiny coindesk articles (that cost 20k each) or shilling by VIPs. The projects already on board are awesome and a lot more is coming. The price doesn't reflect this yet, but I'm happy that money and resources are spent on building long term foundations instead of wasted competing with the garbage of Eos, Tron or Verge on their own terms. If you look around in the channels the work being done on CC, Scaling and other aspects is awesome. I'm in this space from years and I can find only a few that come anything close. Komodo is playing the long term game, sooner or later all this will come together and reward greatly

Well.. buy some EOS.. good to diversify port..

[20-Jul-18 02:45 PM] jorian#4555
the discussion about market price is so stupid. no matter what shit EOS can pull, the price will moon because people are only in it for the gains.

[20-Jul-18 02:46 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Zen and Etc .. have same approach.. in for long term and developing ..

[20-Jul-18 02:59 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Think long term. Think we're building personal computers in 1974. Komodo is Apple in the garage. The fact that Tron or Verge exist at all, is another demonstration of how early it is: 95% of today coins won't survive the impact with real uses. This is not serious game until there isn't a single coin with a marketcap above 10 trillion and a nation state using it.

[20-Jul-18 03:06 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
personally I care way more that Komodo team has the money (i.e. BTC) to pay for all stuff and complete the roadmap, regardless of short term Kmd price

[20-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And they forget that the people developping kmd also have the most to gain

[20-Jul-18 03:22 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
With easy migration tools in place we can campaign to save Erc20 from gas congestion and move them to Kmd. Because if people didn't notice, Ethereum is hitting its scaling limits.

In a kmd bear market jl is probably losing several 10s of millions a day

I think people still dont understand the real capacity of assetchains

[20-Jul-18 03:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
People just take it as another token in a chain

[20-Jul-18 03:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And the fact is that in reality people dont understand what having a real independent blockchain means

[20-Jul-18 03:29 PM] yorklab#7270
You're right, and that's part of the problem. I think the team is in the process of helping others understand.

[20-Jul-18 03:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Having the capacity for example of integrating smart contracts into your chain, contrary to your chain itself being a smart contract is a huge advancenment

[20-Jul-18 03:31 PM] yorklab#7270
To me, it looks like Komodo now understands the issues and are currently addressing them. The bear market makes things look bad now, but it can change overnight.

[20-Jul-18 03:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hopefully everything is in place marketing wise by the markets regain interest
