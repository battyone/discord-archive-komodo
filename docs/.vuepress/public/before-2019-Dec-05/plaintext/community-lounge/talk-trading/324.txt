How Social Media's Powerful 'Silent Majority' Moves Bitcoin Prices
Bitcoin is on fire. The ultra-democratic cryptocurrency with many passionate doubters and acolytes, has taken the tech and financial communities by storm. The value of a single bitcoin has soared from approximately $500 in 2014 to $6,000 (at times, as much as nearly $18,000)....
https://www.stevens.edu/sites/stevens_edu/files/Bitcoin-image2_0.jpg

[30-Nov-18 03:57 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
"Very active users' comments and tweets, Mai's team found, did not move Bitcoin's price much at all. However, the "silent majority" ‚Äî infrequent Twitter and Bitcointalk users who took the time to comment on the cryptocurrency's prospects ‚Äî moved prices more, as much as ten times more, when they posted positive comments."

"This was a big finding, and it does seem to prove that people are trusting the silent majority much more, perhaps because they do not seem to have an agenda," says Mai.

[30-Nov-18 08:30 PM] meatspoon#7860
Someone invite that angry guy back who couldn‚Äôt process more than one comment per 3 minutes and thought that the USD was the only true currency in existence.

Every time he wrote ‚Äústop‚Äù i giggled

[30-Nov-18 09:07 PM] meatspoon#7860
Like everyone had to freeze in time so he could poop out his next pearl of wisdom.  His thoughts were so deep and complex that anyone else typing at the same time would somehow sully them.

Digiprice charges crazy juice on its trades

[01-Dec-18 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
0.2% doesn't count a "crazy" imo

[01-Dec-18 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
```
What is percentage of 0.2% of 10,000?
0.2% √ó 10,000 =
(0.2 √∑ 100) √ó 10,000 =
(0.2 √ó 10,000) √∑ 100 =
2,000 √∑ 100 =
20;
Answer:
0.2% of 10,000 = 20 ```

[01-Dec-18 01:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So far my experience in digitalprice has been good

[01-Dec-18 01:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If they had more volume it would be my go to exchange

[01-Dec-18 01:59 PM] jorian#4555
if that's what everyone thinks

[01-Dec-18 01:59 PM] jorian#4555
ü§∑

[01-Dec-18 02:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
well, eventually it will get more volume. It has been getting more since inception

[01-Dec-18 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
that or it'll be like barterdex and have no volume because it has no volume üòï

[01-Dec-18 02:31 PM] actionslacks#4072
just put some coin on dp, so far so good.

[01-Dec-18 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
>1: why don't you trade on barterdex?

[01-Dec-18 02:35 PM] jorian#4555
yeah that exactly

some whales are needed

[01-Dec-18 02:35 PM] actionslacks#4072
I'll go on barterdex.  I just cant leave my box on all day waiting for trades to happens

[01-Dec-18 02:36 PM] jorian#4555
vps is the way to go

[01-Dec-18 02:38 PM] actionslacks#4072
thats a good idea

[01-Dec-18 02:40 PM] jorian#4555
but to be honest, i think it's better to wait and invest your time in mm2.0

[01-Dec-18 02:41 PM] jorian#4555
bear isn't dead yet and barterdex won't be full of life until bull resurfaces. and looking at the work our 2 artems our doing at mm2.0, mm2.0 is nearer than you think

[01-Dec-18 02:44 PM] actionslacks#4072
I think the sec is doing a great job of advertising for barterdex. dICO may be the only way to do an ICO in the states soon.

[01-Dec-18 02:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the real issue with Barterdex is that its not easy to provide liquidity

[01-Dec-18 02:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the barterdex app and even hyperdex dont work well for sellers, it does for buyers

[01-Dec-18 02:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
sellers need to have more tech knowledge than the average user to have reliable orders up

[01-Dec-18 02:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so that is where the self fulfilling prophecy becomes true

[01-Dec-18 02:48 PM] actionslacks#4072
the pizza/beer testing brought a lot of people in to use it and figure it out. Maybe we should do something like that again once mm2.0 is getting close.

[01-Dec-18 02:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what we need is to make it simple or at least very clear how to become a liquidity provider

[01-Dec-18 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`sellers need to have more tech knowledge than the average user to have reliable orders up`
That's a relatively easy change
The problem with that change not coming in is that we (the core pushers of changes) all kinda "lost interest" in making any changes because of the overall "lack of interest" and it created a never-ending circle

[01-Dec-18 02:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
add the bear market salt on that cake

[01-Dec-18 02:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i helped a couple of people interested in being liquidity providers to set VPS and provide liquidty but the problem was that since they didnt see much orders going through they lost interest and eventually their servers would go dormant or crashed

[01-Dec-18 02:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and since there was no incentive to keep them up running, eventually they gave up

[01-Dec-18 02:53 PM] actionslacks#4072
dp is doing decent volume. idk who it is but getting that volume on the dex would be nice

[01-Dec-18 02:54 PM] actionslacks#4072
of course pirate cant be on it though

[01-Dec-18 02:54 PM] actionslacks#4072
yet

[01-Dec-18 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
if there were 97 hrs in each day and 143 days in each week, BarterDEX GUI would feken rawk

[01-Dec-18 02:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if somehow we could get an exchange like dp to offer liquidity provider infrastructure and interface for the public, i think that would change the tide a bit

[01-Dec-18 02:54 PM] SHossain#0007
mm2.0?

[01-Dec-18 02:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im not sure how mm2.0 will solve the mm server issue
