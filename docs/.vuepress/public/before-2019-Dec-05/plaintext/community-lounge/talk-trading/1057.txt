No rekt , no gain

[10-Aug-19 10:23 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Jumping in if we go up

[10-Aug-19 10:32 AM] Caglio#3337
Stable decline is the best

[10-Aug-19 11:31 AM] Caglio#3337
In the end, it seems only bitcoin matters ðŸ˜ƒ

[10-Aug-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, we wait for 400kb blocks

[10-Aug-19 11:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[10-Aug-19 11:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Just recently but i think it suits me ðŸ˜ƒ

[10-Aug-19 11:33 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, I like funny people

[10-Aug-19 11:34 AM] Caglio#3337
Its better to laugh than its to cry

[10-Aug-19 11:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Unless you are crying because you are laughing too much

[10-Aug-19 11:38 AM] Caglio#3337
Happens sometimes when the weed is good

[10-Aug-19 11:38 AM] Caglio#3337
But rarely :/

[10-Aug-19 11:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am sure if you are still around in 6-12 months you will be crying with happiness that you did not dump

[10-Aug-19 11:47 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, thats the story I heard whole 2018

[10-Aug-19 11:47 AM] Caglio#3337
But I wont sell it now

[10-Aug-19 11:47 AM] Caglio#3337
So I guess I will be here in 6-12 months, unless I die

[10-Aug-19 12:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
loool

[10-Aug-19 12:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I see rekt people  everywhere

[10-Aug-19 12:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
its not only here unfortunately

[10-Aug-19 12:19 PM] Caglio#3337
Yup, rekt all around, btc is dead

[10-Aug-19 12:19 PM] Caglio#3337
alts good

[10-Aug-19 12:19 PM] Caglio#3337
alts bring money

[10-Aug-19 12:19 PM] Caglio#3337
then suddenly bitcoin goes up

[10-Aug-19 12:19 PM] Caglio#3337
sad story ðŸ˜¦

[10-Aug-19 12:21 PM] Buddz1993#5380
and then it goes down before you noticing

[10-Aug-19 12:22 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I wouldnt trade right now ,market sentimet is quite unstable and we can't for sure predict whats about to happen its extremely dangerous.

[10-Aug-19 12:23 PM] Caglio#3337
But it will pull alts again

[10-Aug-19 12:23 PM] Caglio#3337
And I dont trade ( :

[10-Aug-19 12:23 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I wouldn't also

[10-Aug-19 02:11 PM] dan.#2473
I was not expecting a rektening like this

[10-Aug-19 02:11 PM] Caglio#3337
I was

[10-Aug-19 02:11 PM] dan.#2473
How come

[10-Aug-19 02:13 PM] dan.#2473
As much as everyone says this is similar to 15 and 16 bear this is completely different. All this money from alts is literally flowing into btc . Past 2 months the alt market has completely deflated into btc

{Reactions}
ðŸ’¯ 

[10-Aug-19 02:15 PM] dan.#2473
Who knows what happens from here. And all the btc minimalists are gonna cringe but I can see this playing out either way

[10-Aug-19 02:15 PM] Caglio#3337
Well I was sure we are getting rekt, cos people started to shit all over bitcoin everywhere

[10-Aug-19 02:15 PM] Caglio#3337
with their dumb alts

[10-Aug-19 02:15 PM] dan.#2473
A rektening of the majority of the alt market does technically have to happen before btc can moon.

[10-Aug-19 02:16 PM] Caglio#3337
all alts - much breakthrough

[10-Aug-19 02:16 PM] Caglio#3337
We dont need new coin every day

[10-Aug-19 02:16 PM] Caglio#3337
More and more coins = more and more bullshit, plus it takes money from others

[10-Aug-19 02:17 PM] dan.#2473
Yeah no kidding. I do think some will survive. Honestly, probably kmd. As long as there are still main devs coins never die.

[10-Aug-19 02:18 PM] dan.#2473
But the 2014 and 2015 cmc historic pages make me want to PUKE and laugh at the same time

[10-Aug-19 02:18 PM] dan.#2473
Shit changes fast

[10-Aug-19 02:18 PM] Caglio#3337
Lets hope so, I had high expectations, thats why I am in this crypto twitter room, not else... But we will see

[10-Aug-19 02:18 PM] Caglio#3337
I honestly hope 90% of coins die

[10-Aug-19 02:18 PM] Caglio#3337
I am really tired of all the "the best coin ever" talks

[10-Aug-19 02:19 PM] dan.#2473
If you look at the top 100 the past few months there's about 20ish new coins out of the blue that are sustaining rank. It's happening again where alts are getting displaced by new alts .

[10-Aug-19 02:20 PM] dan.#2473
It seems the past few days the polarity in here has died down and we're all much more agreeing to what's going on

[10-Aug-19 02:20 PM] dan.#2473
I thought I was gonna get raped and pillaged before

[10-Aug-19 02:21 PM] dan.#2473
Unless you have BTC, HODLing is the worst friggen alt strategy in the world

[10-Aug-19 02:22 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, but honestly dan

[10-Aug-19 02:22 PM] Caglio#3337
HODL

[10-Aug-19 02:22 PM] dan.#2473
It's like holding GameStop stock or JCPenney stock on the way down

[10-Aug-19 02:22 PM] Caglio#3337
Doesnt the word and stupidity of it make you puke ?

[10-Aug-19 02:22 PM] Caglio#3337
Fucking crypto people are retards

[10-Aug-19 02:22 PM] Caglio#3337
A guy once wrote HODL instead of hold

[10-Aug-19 02:22 PM] Caglio#3337
and the retards are repeating HODL HODL and dying in laughter

[10-Aug-19 02:22 PM] dan.#2473
Yeah it is kind of silly

[10-Aug-19 02:23 PM] Caglio#3337
The exact word shows the sign of being wrong...

[10-Aug-19 02:23 PM] dan.#2473
CNBC loves it they say it all the time, silly mainstream nerds

[10-Aug-19 02:23 PM] Caglio#3337
^ this

[10-Aug-19 02:23 PM] Caglio#3337
But yeah, the worst possible strategy ever

[10-Aug-19 02:24 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont think we will ever recover from this satoshi dump... ever

[10-Aug-19 02:24 PM] Caglio#3337
we might get a rise in price... but we are not recovering

[10-Aug-19 02:24 PM] dan.#2473
Reminds me of 50 something's who bought dotcom stocks and won't let go of the ones that never took off

[10-Aug-19 02:25 PM] Caglio#3337
Well, I already live like I have 0$ value in it

[10-Aug-19 02:26 PM] Caglio#3337
I had big hopes, but after I seen how things work out, I dont have em anymore

[10-Aug-19 02:26 PM] Caglio#3337
Better plan could have got us better price for a while

[10-Aug-19 02:26 PM] Caglio#3337
But eventually noone care about KMD, nor ever will

[10-Aug-19 02:26 PM] Caglio#3337
Once we get out of top 100, which is gonna happen sooner or later

[10-Aug-19 02:27 PM] Caglio#3337
Rekt will be completed

[10-Aug-19 02:27 PM] dan.#2473
I will say I thought the same way my protfolio was almost nothing in 2015 I just said well that was a loss, and it worked out good for me in the end

[10-Aug-19 02:27 PM] Caglio#3337
Well, I am not selling unless I get my money back

[10-Aug-19 02:27 PM] Caglio#3337
Or at least 80% of it

[10-Aug-19 02:27 PM] dan.#2473
Just hold at this point

[10-Aug-19 02:28 PM] Caglio#3337
So its either 0 or whatever

[10-Aug-19 02:28 PM] dan.#2473
You said you're at like 1500 USD

[10-Aug-19 02:28 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah

[10-Aug-19 02:29 PM] Caglio#3337
Now when I look @ that its laughable

[10-Aug-19 02:29 PM] Caglio#3337
1500$ kmd portfolio

[10-Aug-19 02:29 PM] Caglio#3337
whata rich man I am rofl

[10-Aug-19 02:30 PM] meatspoon#7860
Best tech!

[10-Aug-19 02:31 PM] dan.#2473
Caglio, honest suggestion,if you're pretty sure it's gonna continue going down sell and rebuy it. That's what I did .  I'm making bank

[10-Aug-19 02:31 PM] dan.#2473
Well bank is relative

[10-Aug-19 02:31 PM] QualityASSURANCE#1813

[10-Aug-19 02:31 PM] dan.#2473
I've got almost 2x kmd now

[10-Aug-19 02:31 PM] dan.#2473
So whatever your definition of kmd is current ly

[10-Aug-19 02:32 PM] dan.#2473
But if it goes down from here it's not going to be tomorrow

[10-Aug-19 02:33 PM] dan.#2473
I'm treading lightly

[10-Aug-19 02:35 PM] dan.#2473
Daily RSI is oversold and it's been pretty accurate for kmd since the beginning of kmd
