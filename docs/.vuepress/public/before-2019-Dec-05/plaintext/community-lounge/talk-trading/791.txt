It shows no sign of stopping either

[21-Jun-19 02:45 AM] PTYX#6840
Maybe a few people yes. But as a nation the USA is digging itself deeper

[21-Jun-19 02:45 AM] Tek#5253

usa knows its debt can never be repaid, thats why they let it grow as big as possible before the innevatible financial reset that is coming

[21-Jun-19 02:48 AM] Tek#5253

[21-Jun-19 06:07 AM] coingirl87#6489
Its so sad to watch kmd is bleeding so hard . It seems there is no demand for komodo...reasons??? I dont know......when kmd is rising it is only because of whalebro or sis which is supernet. Yes Komodo has one of the best tech but  it doesnt help...coins like bnb rise and rise...not because of tech but because of very good marketing....so my hope is that komodo marketing team will start as soon as with massive action. It doesnt help to have a medicine to fight agains cancer but nobody knows it....thats only my opinion...dont know how others see that...

[21-Jun-19 06:09 AM] Tek#5253
they will release the antara thing and then a marketing campaign will start, so in ~2weeks

[21-Jun-19 06:09 AM] Tek#5253
also new exchange coming up next month

[21-Jun-19 06:30 AM] Tek#5253

>mfw the prophecy underestimated BTC - "/biz/ - Business & Finance" is 4chan's imageboard for the discussion of business and finance, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

[21-Jun-19 07:22 AM] Keppie#5156
according to the prophecy, we are overbought hehe

[21-Jun-19 07:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
much of the money spent on marketing may as well be thrown into a bonfire.  general understanding of crypto hasn't reached the point where 90% of the things going on here could be comprehended by the coinbase crowd anyway. sure bribing your way up cmc works for short term gains, but the trail of dead projects left by the last crash show where misallocated funds can lead even the best ideas. imagine how bad things would be if the recent hack attack had gone off as planned.

[21-Jun-19 10:51 AM] Markus#5464
predicting btc price by date is just silly

[21-Jun-19 10:51 AM] Markus#5464
and make u look like a fool

[21-Jun-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
that guy from the future has been pretty close so far

[21-Jun-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810

[21-Jun-19 10:52 AM] Markus#5464

[21-Jun-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
would be cool if it worked for a few more predictions of his

[21-Jun-19 10:53 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Haha yes it's stupid there are predictions all the way up to a mil per btc... Lets make it happen

[21-Jun-19 10:54 AM] Markus#5464
probably some ppl can predict price somewhat good but those most likely been analysing markets for 20+ years if not longer

[21-Jun-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC is unlike any other market

[21-Jun-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be like if the "internet" was tradeable on exchanges

[21-Jun-19 10:55 AM] Tek#5253
> no correction to 6k

[21-Jun-19 10:55 AM] Tek#5253

[21-Jun-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
i didnt say there wouldnt be a correction to 7k though

[21-Jun-19 10:56 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Its been wel documented that 90% of traders don't outperform the stock market. I guess it's somewhat the same for crypto.

[21-Jun-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
at anytime, can easily pullback 20% to 25%

[21-Jun-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
especially with the "short on bitmex, dump on bitstamp" trick

[21-Jun-19 10:57 AM] Acura#2748
On Okex Exchange we had broken over 10k $

[21-Jun-19 10:57 AM] Markus#5464
kraken been a hot spot for dumps lately aswell but no other exchange follow their dumps 😄

[21-Jun-19 11:01 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jl777c that guy from the future post on reddit will become true if enough people believe in it, just like TA works because there is enough people that think it does 😄

[21-Jun-19 11:01 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So we should all say it is true 😃

[21-Jun-19 11:02 AM] Markus#5464
why would TA not work, how else u gonna trade a market

[21-Jun-19 11:02 AM] Markus#5464
