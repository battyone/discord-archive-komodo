they're probably the best gold provider

[23-Jun-19 03:50 AM] PTYX#6840
and they accept btc

Fat finger pumps, no follow through afterwards üôÑ

[23-Jun-19 03:56 AM] yorklab#7270
Pretty high volume though, and it popped three times within a few minutes, kinda strange.

[23-Jun-19 04:11 AM] ryman112#0068
@meatspoon fairly?  I question this

[23-Jun-19 04:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am pretty sure we have seen the bottom, even @siu - Chainmakers is in disbelief

[23-Jun-19 04:55 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
yea looking better

[23-Jun-19 05:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
It looks like Changelly doesn't have KMD listed currently. I swear they supported KMD before, but I guess their wallet is in maintenance?

[23-Jun-19 05:15 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
They did

[23-Jun-19 05:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog do you know if they stopped supporting KMD or if it's just in maintenance?

[23-Jun-19 06:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I believe just maintenance, but I do not know, they are slow to update at times.

[23-Jun-19 07:27 AM] Raggardy#8007
So really, the price of KMD is dictated by one whale on Binance?

[23-Jun-19 07:30 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No, it‚Äôs just humor

[23-Jun-19 07:30 AM] Raggardy#8007
üòÑ Ah right. I keep seeing Whale bro

[23-Jun-19 07:31 AM] Keppie#5156
Pretty much right tho. Price is dictated by whalebro on binance üòÑ

[23-Jun-19 07:32 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I know for a fact Komodo has more than one whale

[23-Jun-19 07:44 AM] Raggardy#8007
I suppose I'll just have to follow his lead

BOTCF Signal Bot: everyone Pump Announcement- 

Next pump: Tuesday 25 June 20:00 GMT

Exchange : https://www.bittrex.com/
Pairing : BTC
 
PUMP WILL BE UNRANKED (Free for all), ALL PUMPERS WILL RECEIVE COIN SIGNAL AT THE SAME TIME.

Last pump was truly incredible, so many people sent in great #success-sories with really nice profits. As we continue to grow pump will only get better and better, more buying and shilling power are great things. Lets keep up the good work and get ready for another great pump!

[23-Jun-19 09:16 AM] ph03nix#3115

Total #Altcoin Marketcap (excludes bitcoin):

Looks ready for blastoff any day now, targeting a overall 2X in value.

This would add $130 billion dollars to the total cap, $ALTS would absolutely fly at levels not seen since December 2017 / January 2018.

lets see how it will evolve....dont like that 15k spike which pretty much got rekt right away

[23-Jun-19 10:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Market buys does that @Markus

[23-Jun-19 10:52 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No buy support

[23-Jun-19 10:52 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It takes a while to build, in this case looks like sell bots are in control

[23-Jun-19 10:52 AM] Markus#5464
yupp

[23-Jun-19 10:53 AM] Import secure.random()#8925
Do you guys think trading bots are bad for the market in general whats your stance on them?

[23-Jun-19 10:54 AM] Import secure.random()#8925
I think they are pushing out standard investors or traders from taking part as they know there is a high chance the bots will wipe there posisitons out I think the bots being used on the markets are stopping more people from trading them.  In turn slowing the pace.

[23-Jun-19 10:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont think that is the case

[23-Jun-19 10:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
KMD is in a special place where it has decent liquidity but still small enough for bots to take control

_bots...bots everywhere_

[23-Jun-19 10:56 AM] Markus#5464
problem with trading bots trading kmd is their focus always seem to be to dump the price cause everytime price have gone up quite alot volume dry up and price keep falling

[23-Jun-19 10:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Even DEX will get bots someday....

[23-Jun-19 10:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If people were not too silly to sell, the bots wont have anything to buy

[23-Jun-19 10:57 AM] Markus#5464
i think many set stop losses, not sure why then bots try to trigger those

[23-Jun-19 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bots sell aswell

[23-Jun-19 10:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@blackjok3r yes but usually they would have to buy too

[23-Jun-19 10:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
depends what they have been instructed to do I guess?

[23-Jun-19 10:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bot != AI

[23-Jun-19 10:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The way to buy for them is to push price down to buy cheaper, then push price up to sell

[23-Jun-19 10:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackjok3r I heard Wall Street/stock market uses AI in their trading setups etc ü§î

[23-Jun-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would say they do for sure. Preobably in crypto aswell really. He was asking about BOTS though.

[23-Jun-19 11:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, since 2017, the institutional investors arrived

[23-Jun-19 11:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
They would, it is easy money

[23-Jun-19 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
HODL seems to work for stocks aswell... doubnled my super since 2017 lol, without makeing a single contribution or trade.

[23-Jun-19 11:01 AM] Markus#5464
not sure if institutions trade crypto....might just buy cheap and hold until critical moments where its no long worth to hodl where they could lose alot of profits

[23-Jun-19 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thewy would send 0.5% (or something tiny)  of their trading bots to it just because they can I would think...

[23-Jun-19 11:02 AM] Markus#5464
ye maybe

[23-Jun-19 11:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well it is like professional poker players playing against other pros or fish?

[23-Jun-19 11:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Much easier against the dumb money

I have study a lot of bots and HFT system for crypto I know bitmex has serious problem with bot and HFT there for future market basicly setup to wipe out small players with there bot.

[23-Jun-19 11:13 AM] Markus#5464
ofc bitmex is biggest cartel in crypto

[23-Jun-19 11:14 AM] Markus#5464
if there is enough money to be made from liquidating 100x longs they will do it no matter if its manipulation

alot of bearish divergence on btc daily chart

[23-Jun-19 12:03 PM] Markus#5464
i think a pullback to retest 9,4k fib lvl would be healthy

[23-Jun-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
now KMD is one of the top gainers, where are all the doom and gloomers?

[23-Jun-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the lesson is that one days good (or bad) is quite meaningless

[23-Jun-19 12:05 PM] Markus#5464
üëç

[23-Jun-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
only if there is a long term sustained good (or bad) would it have any meaning

[23-Jun-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810

[23-Jun-19 12:06 PM] hyperDEX#6586
we are 2x normal volume too

[23-Jun-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
the reason KMD had bigger negatives than most was that just prior to BTC rampage, it had one of the top gaining for quite a few days

[23-Jun-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
days of above average gain, one day worse than average loss, now we are back to above average gain

[23-Jun-19 12:06 PM] Markus#5464
road to 19k should be imminent

[23-Jun-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
if this sort of fluctuations cause too much stress... maybe just buy a stablecoin
