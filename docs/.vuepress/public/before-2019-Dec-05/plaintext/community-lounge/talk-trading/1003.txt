[04-Aug-19 11:28 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Already many times, I have not seen hope.

[04-Aug-19 11:30 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
I believe that I will buy cheap KMD at 9K.

[04-Aug-19 11:30 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
You had chance at 930

[04-Aug-19 11:30 AM] weldon.gull5#3242

[04-Aug-19 11:31 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
We'll you will need btc moon for this

[04-Aug-19 11:31 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Doesn't look to good on that front I suppose

[04-Aug-19 11:31 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

[04-Aug-19 11:31 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Expect same for btc soon

[04-Aug-19 11:32 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Me

[04-Aug-19 11:32 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
BTC will not change much in the short term, but the price of KMDBTC I think will not improve in the short term.

[04-Aug-19 11:33 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
All the altcoins are falling, and the news for KMD is an opportunity, but it has been following the decline

[04-Aug-19 11:34 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
A market-recognized opportunity missed, and prices will not change much.

[04-Aug-19 11:54 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Only robots, no real deals, soon reached a new lowðŸ˜ˆ

[04-Aug-19 12:01 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Aug-19 12:08 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Aug-19 12:08 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Aug-19 12:08 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Aug-19 12:11 PM] weldon.gull5#3242
I bought a higher price~~, we are just discussing, and can't decide the price here.ðŸ˜›

[04-Aug-19 12:11 PM] Markus#5464
so ur TA is telling u price will go down?

[04-Aug-19 12:12 PM] weldon.gull5#3242
Just my personal opinion, everyone has their own ideas

[04-Aug-19 12:12 PM] Markus#5464
Alright

[04-Aug-19 12:12 PM] weldon.gull5#3242
If you don't want to hear it, I can't say it.

[04-Aug-19 12:12 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Aug-19 12:13 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Aug-19 12:13 PM] weldon.gull5#3242

[04-Aug-19 03:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[04-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Aug-19 03:11 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[04-Aug-19 03:12 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Markus institutions must be waiting in line to get into btc and get chinahustled lol

[04-Aug-19 03:12 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Aug-19 03:13 PM] Markus#5464
even binance coin which was one of the few coins to actually do well during bear market is doing nothing at all

[04-Aug-19 03:13 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Until they all do a 3 times before you can blink an eye

[04-Aug-19 03:14 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
But you are correct

[04-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Markus#5464
i just know that whenever alts pump it will probably be very hard to know when to sell and take profits

[04-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Markus#5464
cause it might go up 200% and ur like i sell half and then it does the same again

[04-Aug-19 03:15 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yup and right now maybe whales make sure we don't hold any when they pump it

[04-Aug-19 03:15 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
So we fomo

[04-Aug-19 03:15 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
