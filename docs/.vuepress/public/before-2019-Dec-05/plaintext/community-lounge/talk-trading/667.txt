Cross chain atomic swaps using a private transaction only chain li...
Even I had said that doing atomic swaps on a blockchain with only private transactions is not possible. At first (and second and third)…

by extending the same idea some CC could be supported, but it wont be automatic and would take a lot of work, and not all things can be supported. so on a case by case basis, it can be evaluated if it is worth the effort

[21-May-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
remember when I recommended to buy PIRATE a couple months ago, when it was 0.05 KMD or less

[21-May-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810

earlier today I invited one of the devs of RPGcoin to check KMD platform and Komodore64-
turns out he is aware of Komodo and has mined in the early days, but hasnt followed the gaming related aspects- if the guy comes by to ask, I am sure he will be very excited about all the gaming aspects like cc_rogue etc

Why ppl seem so surprised that bitcoin etf got delayed again? Doubt it will get approved anytime soon

[21-May-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
seems it is much better if they never get approved

“We noticed pirate network transactions coming from your IP address”

We need your taxes so we can afford to store all your metadata so we can know how much you owe us. But you have to pay someone else to figure out how much you owe us. Dont get it wrong, or else you owe us more.

Lost my good friend dr pavel

[21-May-19 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
how can you lose something that you never even had?

[21-May-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
even with the withdraw address from the exchange known, you can scan the blockchain all you want for that zaddr

[21-May-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
you wont find it

[21-May-19 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
without the privkey or viewingkey for the zaddr, you cant even verify if a zaddr has payments sent to it

[21-May-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, when your country makes PIRATE illegal, please just send them all your coins as they instruct.the women and children need to be protected

[21-May-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
if crypto is information, maybe it is covered by right to privacy?

[21-May-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
civilized countries protect their citizens right to privacy

[21-May-19 11:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by that measure, the US hasn't been civilized in ~ 100 years

[21-May-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, police states tend to not be civilized

[21-May-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
no surprise there

[21-May-19 12:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Hollowman9000 with some new features I am adding, transactions won't need to come from your IP in the future. You can ask any IP on the internet to forward it along for you. In the future, when privacy is ultra-valuable, there may be a cottage industries based on this fact

wow 116k KMD volume for ARRR in DP

[21-May-19 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
somewhere like 40% of my BTC txes get sent from explorers 😛

[21-May-19 12:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers seems like the pre-CMC-listing frenzy

[21-May-19 12:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
many coins don't "exist" until they are on CMC, unfortunately. But that gives a nice edge to all the people that know of various other sites

[21-May-19 12:43 PM] jorian#4555

[21-May-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
how does that affect the value of SV?

[21-May-19 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Cryptoon If you mean ARRR, that's not my view, it's my goal
But I do still have 30k that I need to price to rise another 50% before I can average out and break even on

[21-May-19 01:12 PM] Tek#5253

[21-May-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810

bsv just shot up 70%

[21-May-19 01:12 PM] Tek#5253
bc of this copyright claim

[21-May-19 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and it was "allowed" by the USA state`
You can file too and they'll give you the same claim

[21-May-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
how does that change anything?

[21-May-19 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
