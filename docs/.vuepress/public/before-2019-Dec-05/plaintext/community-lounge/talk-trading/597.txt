Most likely this is just a bulltrap, would be surprised to see bear market being over so quickly

[03-May-19 10:31 AM] Markus#5464
we had no real consolidation

[03-May-19 10:47 AM] Malti#3948
going sideways for over 3 months isn't considered consolidation? (real question)

[03-May-19 10:53 AM] Markus#5464
ask a trading expert everytime i tell my personal view ppl tend to go into troll mode on this channel

[03-May-19 10:53 AM] klein#5233
yes, consolidation in anyones book  realy

[03-May-19 10:53 AM] Alexfrog#1338
the answer is that people get way too bearish after a brutal year and they cant figure out that we bottomed already

[03-May-19 10:53 AM] Alexfrog#1338
it was like this in 2015 too

[03-May-19 10:54 AM] Markus#5464
has nothing to do with bottoming

[03-May-19 10:54 AM] Markus#5464
what im talking about is how we gain this massive growth without any correction at all

Nice move

[03-May-19 11:36 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this move almost guarantees a bull market

[03-May-19 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
it funny how after almost doubling from low, there is still uncertainity. like when BTC dropped from 20k, to 12K. just not possible to know for sure when the market turns

[03-May-19 11:37 AM] jorian#4555
most expect a double bottom, so likely a double bottom won't happen

6k resistance must be fucking massive

[03-May-19 11:38 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Surpassing the $6k - $6800 resistance will most certainly write in stone a new bull market
