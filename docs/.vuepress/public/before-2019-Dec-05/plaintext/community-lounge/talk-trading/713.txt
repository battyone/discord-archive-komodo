adoption will skyrocket in the next decade

[30-May-19 05:47 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
assuming KMD is still one of the best projects at that point, it will thrive

[30-May-19 05:47 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
ADA, XRP, and all kinds of other BS will drop off the map

Wine and cola... hard to imagine the combined taste. Thatâ€™s a European thing, right?

[30-May-19 06:13 PM] Tek#5253
doubt. never heard of it

[30-May-19 06:13 PM] Caglio#3337
You never heard of it ?

[30-May-19 06:14 PM] Caglio#3337

[30-May-19 06:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
I seem to remember a Sicilian friend of mine saying in the south of Italy they drank white wine and coke/sprite and in the north they mixed red wine and cola.

[30-May-19 06:14 PM] Caglio#3337
red wine = bambus

[30-May-19 06:14 PM] Caglio#3337
white wine = lovranski
