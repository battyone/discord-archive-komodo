$KMD is being rebranded on 29 September. Doing so should bring attention to what‚Äôs the dev team is up to: 

- 1 million tps
- HyperDEX (improved DEX)
- MobileDEX (a decentralised exchange for your mobile device)
- Blockchain interoperability

Man I don't know if ETH can ever recover.  People have to dump it to save their projects funding.
