WOW.

The Fedearl Reserve has injected over $100 billion into the financial system in the last 48 hours.

That is more than 50% of the total market cap of Bitcoin.

Rather than fix the structural issues, they keep trying to print their way out of the mess.

Bitcoin rocket ...

preparing cryptocurrency market for next bull market 😅

ye indeed wtf is happening with XLM

[18-Sep-19 03:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
remember seeing such big orders of sell and buys mentioned about KMD before on exchange....

[18-Sep-19 03:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
doesn't that pattern says that whoever is doing that is trying to keep the price of KMD between some price range as long as possible?

[18-Sep-19 03:12 PM] Markus#5464
im happy if we ever hit 30k sats again....then i already made a killing this bull cycle

[18-Sep-19 03:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'd be happy with that price too.... m very much dried out financially and can use some fiat money 😁

[18-Sep-19 03:16 PM] Markus#5464
30k sats and 30k $ btc, then we have 9$ kmd

[18-Sep-19 03:21 PM] Neko#5830
orderbooks are really that shallow

[18-Sep-19 04:04 PM] Mark81#4505
Hmmm... Kmd orderbook is quite impressive with that big buy order but when comparing to any other orderbooks right now is that normal market behavior? I mean shouldn't there be continous buying pressure without big whale trickering market.

[18-Sep-19 04:16 PM] Lumbi#8378
There should be a lot of fire-sales, incl. LUMBER. 🔥

[18-Sep-19 04:29 PM] tolken#2655
fire and lumber don’t mix.

Coincidence this rally happens on day Binance US opens? I realize they don’t have shit for pairs, but still i think Binance banning US customers cast quite a shadow on the market.

[18-Sep-19 05:22 PM] Tek#5253
doubt it has anything to do with binance us

[18-Sep-19 05:22 PM] Tek#5253
it was just time for an altcoin pump

[18-Sep-19 05:28 PM] tolken#2655
Funny though, several of us speculated this would happen.

self-fullfilling-prophecy

[18-Sep-19 05:29 PM] cipi#4502
if everybody thinks this will happen, it WILL happen

[18-Sep-19 05:32 PM] cipi#4502
that is likely also the reason why price predictions of big analysts are correct... the prophecy fullfills itself if many people believe in it

[18-Sep-19 05:36 PM] tolken#2655
clever you are, cipi

[18-Sep-19 05:38 PM] Markus#5464

What’s up between K64 and Komodo?  In their discord too and everyone is talking about how they’re avoiding Komodo discord and “toxicity”.  Wasn’t the user Komodoworld big here?  Now he’s saying he’s avoiding Komodo.  Why?

[18-Sep-19 09:27 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Thought Komodo was a partner with them.  Months ago everyone in here was buzzing about K64.

Considering I heard about K64 in this channel and Komodo was a partner, seems very on topic

[18-Sep-19 09:52 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
whats the deal with k64 and their tall claims these days

[18-Sep-19 09:52 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
im still banned from their discord for criticizing them lol

[18-Sep-19 09:52 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
any proof yet?

[18-Sep-19 09:54 PM] crumb#2550
nothing yet

[18-Sep-19 09:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
I heard Emmanuel left this channel over toxicity as well.  I liked that guy.

[18-Sep-19 10:00 PM] crumb#2550
unfortunately and paradoxically he contributed to the escalation himself also. he was defending the undefendable. until there is proof from authoritative source. all claims should be taken with a grain of salt.

[18-Sep-19 10:02 PM] crumb#2550
i liked him too. very reasonable and competent guy

[18-Sep-19 10:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
yeah, he added value.  he was funny and kind to people.  sad to see him go.

Remember an ecosystem was dropping 5% or something like that or planned to

Need to find my keys if they did 😅

[19-Sep-19 05:39 AM] Audo#5667
I want to clarify few things regarding the above discussion

 - Komodo doesn't ban people unless they impersonate others or spam pump groups
 - Komodo has not been removing messages from channels even if they critizise us
 - There are rumors going on about threats of violence from the Komodo team, which I have been unable to verify myself nor have I heard any explanation about who's been making them, how it happener, nor what they have said exactly. Just claims, which seems to be an attempt to hurt our reputation.

Please be sceptical about what you hear and try to get to the bottom of it. Most of the time everyone just makes claims. If someone knows more about this you can PM the info to me.

Same goes for why Emmanuel left. We don't know for sure why he left as he never said anything. I wish he comes back as he indeed was contributing to the community and had the balls to stand up and disagree, which is all good.

[19-Sep-19 06:17 AM] Oszy#5734
but every time you ask something there they say "don't look at the past, it doesn't matter blablablabla" no real answers ever just bs

[19-Sep-19 06:19 AM] Oszy#5734
and they ban people now who doesn't let themselves and call them out
