Anyone can track anyone's transactions to find out what they hold.  It just takes forensics.

[13-Mar-19 05:17 AM] Justchill#3485
Believe that if two companies were making a multimillion-dollar blockchain transaction they would incorporate a forensics team to have that information.

[13-Mar-19 05:17 AM] Alexfrog#1338

[13-Mar-19 05:39 AM] Alecandro#1179
do you guys think we will retrace back to mid 20's or just form our new support around 30k??

[13-Mar-19 05:40 AM] Markus#5464
RSI on daily chart is on overbought side

[13-Mar-19 05:40 AM] Markus#5464
so i would expect pullback

[13-Mar-19 05:40 AM] Markus#5464
like previous times

[13-Mar-19 05:40 AM] Markus#5464
but maybe we do a 2nd round of what happened on 17th feb

[13-Mar-19 05:43 AM] Alecandro#1179

[13-Mar-19 05:44 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
maybe some whale wants to run for notary nodes

[13-Mar-19 05:44 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the easiest way is to buy a bunch of KMDs and vote for yourselves ðŸ˜„

[13-Mar-19 05:44 AM] Alecandro#1179
interesting....

[13-Mar-19 05:45 AM] Alecandro#1179

[13-Mar-19 05:45 AM] Markus#5464

[13-Mar-19 05:49 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

[13-Mar-19 05:49 AM] Markus#5464

[13-Mar-19 05:52 AM] Alecandro#1179
I love my KMd too much

[13-Mar-19 05:52 AM] Alexfrog#1338
it was only worth the risk at 36k ðŸ˜„

[13-Mar-19 05:52 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
binance wallet only has 660k left

[13-Mar-19 05:53 AM] Alexfrog#1338

[13-Mar-19 05:53 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

[13-Mar-19 05:54 AM] BlockTech#6895

[13-Mar-19 06:02 AM] Alexfrog#1338
its pretty funny that huobi is now the lowest price

[13-Mar-19 06:02 AM] Alexfrog#1338
like who the hell would buy it at 100k+ on huobi when it was 30k elsewhere

[13-Mar-19 06:02 AM] Alexfrog#1338
so stupid

[13-Mar-19 06:07 AM] Markus#5464
maybe no1 did just server sided bot

[13-Mar-19 06:09 AM] Keppie#5156
Jep, its the bots that trigger each other, triggered by a big whale who bought the orderbook

[13-Mar-19 06:11 AM] Keppie#5156
But the question remains why? Insider info?

[13-Mar-19 06:12 AM] Markus#5464
money game probably

[13-Mar-19 06:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
P&D?

[13-Mar-19 06:13 AM] Markus#5464
going down

[13-Mar-19 06:13 AM] Keppie#5156
yea..

[13-Mar-19 06:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Huobi pump to 120k was on low volume because of thin orderbook

[13-Mar-19 06:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Then the arbitrage bots did the rest
