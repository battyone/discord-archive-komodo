[13-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Sdunbar#5064

[13-Mar-19 03:20 AM] Alexfrog#1338
work is just the thing that stops you from making money on trading cryptos

[13-Mar-19 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so stop doing it and just do cryptos ?

[13-Mar-19 03:22 AM] bishop#9773
what if... huobi is foreshadowing 😉

[13-Mar-19 03:22 AM] Alexfrog#1338
what if huobi is a low volume pump on a new exchange to trick people into paying that price on binance 😄

✅ 

[13-Mar-19 03:23 AM] bishop#9773
Well, legit buying going on binance 😛

[13-Mar-19 03:23 AM] Markus#5464

[13-Mar-19 03:23 AM] Mylo#8306
Wtf happened to the price.  I was scrolling thru cmc column of % gained having breakfast and saw kmd  there.  Must have been tech Tuesday 😝

[13-Mar-19 03:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
something is going on here

[13-Mar-19 03:23 AM] bishop#9773
I think the worst part of an aggressive KMD move is ARRR gets sold off

[13-Mar-19 03:23 AM] bishop#9773
and pirate was looking legit too

[13-Mar-19 03:24 AM] Alexfrog#1338

[13-Mar-19 03:30 AM] actionslacks#4072
perhaps someone is trying to unload mega bags from the huobi contest on binance by pumping it on huobi.
