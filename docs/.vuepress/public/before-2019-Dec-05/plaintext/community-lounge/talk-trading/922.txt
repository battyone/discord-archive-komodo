It enables a fundamental right , free exchange between 2 people with no one intermediating .  So far it seems that most governments are ok with it,  but when they realize the extent of trade going on it‚Äôs going to be a worldwide fight in the courts on the limits of government.

@Deleted User Reminds me of all the jokes that were fun as a kid... "What do you call a man with no arms and no legs in front of your door?  Matt."  Or no arms and no legs in the pool.  Bob.

In states they are called drug dealers

i'd complain about the KMD price, but top coins are down like 20+% right now

[15-Jul-19 12:41 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@SHossain This is indeed good news. Great work. automating utxo management is the first step to making it accesible for the masses and in turn for adaption

[15-Jul-19 01:53 AM] richardt#2807
@Alexfrog Good opportunity for KMD to climb up the rankings

[15-Jul-19 01:54 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yup

[15-Jul-19 02:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Everyone needs to zoom out a bit. People have blinders on thinking about this piece is not working and that piece is not working. But what they fail to understand is that there are many moving parts to KMD and that by working on them in parallel, we dont have this, oh this thing is finished, this thing is finished but we will get to a apex where everything gets finished at once.

At this point everything will click.

[15-Jul-19 02:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We needed a crappy mm1.0 to get to mm2.0

[15-Jul-19 02:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We needed crappy marketing to get better marketing
We needed a bear market to kill off the hype surrounding vaporware

[15-Jul-19 02:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We needed the gov to crackdown on CEX to get DEX out.

I joke, it wont change over night

[15-Jul-19 02:14 AM] Mark81#4505
Hello from Monday! Here things are still the same! üòâ

[15-Jul-19 02:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If we started the DEX now, we would have missed the window already. We were building something that was not easy or good to do to pump the price, but the vision that the knowledge of what will come, has gotten us to this point.

[15-Jul-19 02:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So we work on things that will be needed in the future, not what is needed now. If we did it would already be too late.

[15-Jul-19 02:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Mark81 even if we stay the same and the rest of the alts fall, would we have pumped?? üòÑ

[15-Jul-19 02:16 AM] Mark81#4505
Definitely yeah!

[15-Jul-19 02:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No dump = Pump üòÉ

[15-Jul-19 02:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think we can do that hopefully üòÑ

[15-Jul-19 02:16 AM] Mark81#4505
That is inversed pump!

[15-Jul-19 02:16 AM] jspook16#3059
Also known as a prison pump

[15-Jul-19 02:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We need to dump UP üòÑ

[15-Jul-19 02:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
LOL what?

[15-Jul-19 02:19 AM] jspook16#3059
There inverse pump, also known as the prison pump

[15-Jul-19 02:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
At the moment, with mm 2.0 we are playing for keeps for the DEX monopoly

[15-Jul-19 02:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If we can execute it and run with nSPV we will change the crypto landscape.

[15-Jul-19 02:20 AM] jspook16#3059
When would nSPV be implemented?

[15-Jul-19 02:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It is working when i tried it and im a dummy.

[15-Jul-19 02:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
They are trying to get nSPV working with CCs, currently in testing

[15-Jul-19 02:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This is what i mean, there are no many things in alpha/beta that without a good GUI people dont care about. But these are fundamental changes to the crypto space.

[15-Jul-19 02:22 AM] Mark81#4505
How nSPV will change DEX behavior?

[15-Jul-19 02:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Will speed up the process and be able to scale to millions

[15-Jul-19 02:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
These things that other chains with millions and billions behind them cannot solve

[15-Jul-19 02:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
With CC nSPV, smart contracts that can scale to millions

[15-Jul-19 02:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
with dPoW to secure the lot

[15-Jul-19 02:24 AM] Mark81#4505
I have seen talked about possibility to be able to trade before settlements on blockchain happen?

[15-Jul-19 02:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You mean the 0 conf thing that was in mm 1.0? Think that functionality needs to be added into mm 2.0

[15-Jul-19 02:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The functionalities that is in there right now is enough for it to work but not to have these advanced features

[15-Jul-19 02:26 AM] jspook16#3059
Will the dex allow you to be a maker and a taker?

[15-Jul-19 02:26 AM] Mark81#4505
I mean mempool trading.

[15-Jul-19 02:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
yes

[15-Jul-19 02:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Mark81 not too sure about that one

[15-Jul-19 02:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Eventually there will be a market maker functions, where you connect to a CEX, add your fee say 2% and when someone buys on the DEX you autobuy on the CEX

[15-Jul-19 02:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Free money basically

[15-Jul-19 02:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It might start at 5%, then more market makers come in under cutting each other

[15-Jul-19 02:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
then it is 4/3/2/1  but there will be a equilibrium, there will be enough market makers making enough, that it will be a snow ball

[15-Jul-19 02:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Who doesnt like free money? üòÉ

[15-Jul-19 02:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We will be the most liquid dex very quickly

BTC going sub 10K üôÄ

[15-Jul-19 02:30 AM] Mark81#4505
I'm not sure but is multisignature transaction mempoled already with one transaction? If so then maybe that is route for mempool trading.

[15-Jul-19 02:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Maybe @artem.pikulin could answer

[15-Jul-19 02:59 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@hyperDEX @Mark81 The 0-conf trading is not implemented in MM2 yet, also we've not made a decision how it will work, we will consider several options (same way as MM1 or maybe something different).
