What is pirate? @Cryptoon

[08-Sep-19 09:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
100% anon z to z transaction assetchain

[08-Sep-19 09:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Mandatory private transactions

[08-Sep-19 09:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So contrary to ZEC for example where something like 10% of transactions is anonymous, with pirate/ARRR 99,99% is anonymous.

[08-Sep-19 09:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also protected by dPoW

[08-Sep-19 09:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So 51% attack protected

[08-Sep-19 09:48 PM] Geert#4612
Thank you @Cryptoon i read the website and it's interesting. Appears pirate is the real zec.

Eventually, if everything with atomic swaps with Pirate is figured out,  Pirate will act as a privacy layer for all coins available via Atomicdex

I only hold 2 coins.
My investment philosophy is this 
If something is that good, it doesn't need my money, to get better. And, I'm not investing in anything without a working product.

[08-Sep-19 09:53 PM] Privatoshi#7913
I can like a project and not have to hold the coin.

[08-Sep-19 09:53 PM] Privatoshi#7913
The price is irrelevant, in that situation

[08-Sep-19 09:54 PM] Privatoshi#7913
Id go as far as to ask, why should I buy? Who's interest is that serving? Bc me losing money is no good for me, and only I care about me.

[08-Sep-19 09:55 PM] Geert#4612
Mind sharing information with me which 2 coins?

[08-Sep-19 09:56 PM] Privatoshi#7913
One is BTC & the other is a simple swing trade for today. I can't hold an alt, more than 24 hours, without losing money. So I don't

[08-Sep-19 09:56 PM] Privatoshi#7913
It doesn't change how I feel about projects, like Komodo.

[08-Sep-19 09:57 PM] Privatoshi#7913
If it was stock, it would be different.

[08-Sep-19 09:57 PM] Privatoshi#7913
Komodo is a top project..

[08-Sep-19 09:57 PM] Geert#4612
A wise man once said, any strategy, even a bad strategy, is better than no strategy.

[08-Sep-19 09:58 PM] Privatoshi#7913
Another wise man once said, if everyone knew it was a good strategy, they'd be using it, too

[08-Sep-19 09:58 PM] Privatoshi#7913
Good for me, is profitable

[08-Sep-19 09:58 PM] Privatoshi#7913
That's what it comes down to

[08-Sep-19 09:58 PM] Privatoshi#7913
Do you profit?

[08-Sep-19 09:59 PM] Privatoshi#7913
I've never been rescued by a project, while bagholding.

[08-Sep-19 10:00 PM] Privatoshi#7913
It's just trading.
If you profit, you're doing it right.
If you don't profit, you're not.

[08-Sep-19 10:01 PM] Privatoshi#7913
Someone that gets an F, in English, can't be doing it right---just screwed over by this and that.

[08-Sep-19 10:40 PM] Privatoshi#7913
Lol. Projects get ICO monies. Devs usually get a portion of the supply & they usually mine, which is fair. Centralized exchanges make it out, better than everyone, with listing fees. People very respected in crypto & people with capital, get seed prices and private sales. 
And then average users, we get to gather whatever info we can, and TA, and pay a fee and make a simple trade, hoping we can sell higher.
Then miners. They usually have it tough, especially if they are smaller ones.

That's how I see the landscape

[09-Sep-19 01:20 AM] richardt#2807
what you're describing sounds like a pyramid scheme ü§î

[09-Sep-19 02:05 AM] Privatoshi#7913
@richardt  I disagree. I think it sounds like any other market.

[09-Sep-19 06:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
All markets have assymetric information between people on the inside and normies like us

[09-Sep-19 06:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
The smaller the market the bigger the assymetry

[09-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Markus#5464
seems like kmd whales not done yet, many alt coins gaining against btc atm but whales decided to not let kmd be part of it

[09-Sep-19 08:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah at this point it's so obvious a lot of accumulating has been going on for so long

[09-Sep-19 08:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I would be surprised if all of a sudden CZ says, well kmd is my biggest bag after bnb and btc its the futur

[09-Sep-19 08:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and pump that shit through the moon and beyond

[09-Sep-19 08:52 AM] Markus#5464
possible haha

[09-Sep-19 08:53 AM] Tek#5253
bch is doing quite good

[09-Sep-19 08:53 AM] Tek#5253
dash too

[09-Sep-19 08:53 AM] Tek#5253
inb4 dash is trash

[09-Sep-19 08:54 AM] Markus#5464
we already said most alts doing well

[09-Sep-19 08:55 AM] Markus#5464
seeing bch doing bad would be strange it does have too many whales holding it, only reason would be if they want to accumulate more

[09-Sep-19 08:55 AM] Markus#5464
bitmain alone probably hold 1M+ bch

[09-Sep-19 08:55 AM] Tek#5253
it has a lot of shorts open

[09-Sep-19 08:55 AM] Tek#5253
on it

[09-Sep-19 08:56 AM] Markus#5464
roger ver prob also 0.5M

[09-Sep-19 08:56 AM] Tek#5253
so if it hits the right rate on btc/bch its gonna make a massive green dildo

[09-Sep-19 08:56 AM] Tek#5253
it might happen in the next few weeks

[09-Sep-19 08:56 AM] Tek#5253
if btc stays stable

[09-Sep-19 08:57 AM] Markus#5464
btc is reaching end of symmetrical triangle

[09-Sep-19 08:57 AM] Markus#5464
i expect it to touch 9800 then move up again

[09-Sep-19 08:57 AM] Tek#5253
btc gonna stabilise around 10k is my bet

[09-Sep-19 08:57 AM] Tek#5253
and stay there until close to the next halving

[09-Sep-19 08:58 AM] Markus#5464
i doubt too long time left

[09-Sep-19 08:58 AM] Markus#5464
whales need cash flow

[09-Sep-19 08:58 AM] Tek#5253
yeah altseason time until then : D

[09-Sep-19 09:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
does anyone reasonably expect btc to dip below 9k levels or are we just consolidating now for the next btc push up?

[09-Sep-19 09:09 AM] Lumbi#8378
btc will eventually 'melt' marketshare to alts...

[09-Sep-19 09:19 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
regulators work for atomicdex adoption.

[09-Sep-19 09:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
a cashless society wont be as effective with all of these pesky privacy coins.

[09-Sep-19 09:22 AM] hastrup#8742
It's great marketing üëç

[09-Sep-19 09:24 AM] Tek#5253
the bank wars have only just begun

[09-Sep-19 09:24 AM] Tek#5253
the ones that embrace crypto will win

[09-Sep-19 09:27 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
this has been long time coming. It's not a surprise for any pirate.

[09-Sep-19 10:05 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[09-Sep-19 10:06 AM] Oszy#5734
yes

[09-Sep-19 10:06 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i guess its a matter of waiting for follow up on other exchanges

[09-Sep-19 10:19 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Cryptoon strongly expect it

[09-Sep-19 10:21 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Just compare this triangle to the one at 2014

[09-Sep-19 10:21 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's identical

[09-Sep-19 10:21 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Still so many longs

[09-Sep-19 10:59 AM] Tek#5253

[09-Sep-19 11:24 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
