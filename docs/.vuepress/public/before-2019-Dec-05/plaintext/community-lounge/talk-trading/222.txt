Nice little uptick forming on that chart. we are well due that sudden spike imo

[17-Oct-18 10:26 AM] BlockTech#6895
Didn't knew sorry ^^ i throught there was fee to put order ^^.

[17-Oct-18 10:31 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Easy to misunderstand is guess, But yes the fees are only taken once a trade is settled on the platform

[17-Oct-18 10:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Is it me or after 21.7k it jumps to basically 30k?

[17-Oct-18 10:57 AM] jorian#4555
i can't see that far up the orderbook

üëÜüèº was about to ask same thing

[17-Oct-18 11:14 AM] Yassin#3685
not me but whale #1

[17-Oct-18 11:15 AM] Yassin#3685
pretty sure it is same man buy Kmd

[17-Oct-18 11:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So unless it is Binance themselves buying, it looks like it is someone that wants to get 10% of KMD @jl777c

[17-Oct-18 11:16 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
a little kitty told me it is vitalik buterin üòõ

[17-Oct-18 11:17 AM] Yassin#3685
he know some news for buying hard? :trollface:

[17-Oct-18 11:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Looks like he started buying big time in march

[17-Oct-18 11:18 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
He is stocking up to pay the DPOW fees on his shit ton of ERC20 failures

[17-Oct-18 11:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Ouch he started in DEC LOL

[17-Oct-18 11:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
100k at a time, which would have been 70BTC

[17-Oct-18 11:19 AM] Yassin#3685
:abusedsmily:

[17-Oct-18 11:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Anyone want to check all the tx dates and the kmd sat price and get a total BTC spent? üòÑ

[17-Oct-18 11:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Im curious, easily 1500BTC worth i think

[17-Oct-18 11:20 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Its alot to want to Hodl tho isnt it. I mean even if oyu are loaded and want to speculate why so much? surley they realise upon Kmd going to the moon how they gonna get out?

[17-Oct-18 11:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If it moons they can easily get out

[17-Oct-18 11:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If it doesnt moon that is another issue

[17-Oct-18 11:21 AM] Yassin#3685
@hyperDEX i am lazy!! :trollface:

i understand that but lets say we moon and the volume isnt there at $100 kmd what he do then ?

[17-Oct-18 11:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
They have 7.2M already, Add another 900k, 8,1 maybe they want 10

[17-Oct-18 11:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@CryptoNinjaa Who says he needs $100

[17-Oct-18 11:23 AM] snowdamn#2414
my numbers were off

[17-Oct-18 11:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
He might want $20

[17-Oct-18 11:23 AM] snowdamn#2414
it's better

[17-Oct-18 11:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
10M = 500k a year in rewards

[17-Oct-18 11:24 AM] snowdamn#2414
1M KMD will be making $1M a year just off the 5% @ $20

[17-Oct-18 11:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But he doesnt seem to care about rewards, he hasnt claimed any

[17-Oct-18 11:24 AM] jorian#4555

[17-Oct-18 11:24 AM] Yassin#3685

[17-Oct-18 11:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Yassin VC fund taking a chunk may explain it

[17-Oct-18 11:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But they would be claiming the reward i recon

[17-Oct-18 11:26 AM] Yassin#3685

[17-Oct-18 11:26 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[17-Oct-18 11:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
The fact that they dont claim, makes me think 50% chance its binance

[17-Oct-18 11:34 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
How you guys feels about somebody owning 10%

[17-Oct-18 11:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
When did binance list KMD?

[17-Oct-18 11:35 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Not long after it opened i think

"How you guys feels about somebody owning 10%" 
if it's a fund, i feel very comfortable
if it's one entity for 5% HODL, i feel comfortable
if it's speculative üê≥ , üò±

[17-Oct-18 11:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I feel excited.....because they want to make money

[17-Oct-18 11:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586
