[07-Aug-19 04:50 PM] Caglio#3337
I also have a 32 centimeter long penis, I can tie it up in a knot, and beat my women with it

[07-Aug-19 04:50 PM] Caglio#3337
Just saying

[07-Aug-19 04:50 PM] Caglio#3337
Totally true

[07-Aug-19 04:50 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`anyone fell for the pirate chain scam?` you mean ARRR ? how is that a scam ?

[07-Aug-19 04:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Tek  Pirate is still the most profitable to mine

[07-Aug-19 04:50 PM] Tek#5253
obviously just a scam to take your bitcoins

[07-Aug-19 04:50 PM] Tek#5253
> ARRR

[07-Aug-19 04:50 PM] Tek#5253
lmao ticker

[07-Aug-19 04:51 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It is demonstrably the most private coin out there

[07-Aug-19 04:51 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`obviously just a scam to take your bitcoins` prove your point by giving arguments please, don't just say that obvious ...

[07-Aug-19 04:51 PM] Tek#5253
wow bro, don't state the obvious?

[07-Aug-19 04:52 PM] Tek#5253

You said it was obvious ,  he said give arguments to back your point rather than say that’s obvious

[07-Aug-19 04:53 PM] Tek#5253
actually I didn't but he made a shitty sentence

[07-Aug-19 04:54 PM] Tek#5253
implying any of the kmd cones aren't just scams to take your kmd or buttcoins

[07-Aug-19 04:55 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah, I made a shitty sentence, at least you misunderstood it, doesn't matter, now back to your point, do you have arguments to back your point or not? 🙂

[07-Aug-19 04:55 PM] Tek#5253
I misinterpreted in on purpose and no one even got the joke

[07-Aug-19 04:55 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[07-Aug-19 04:55 PM] Oszy#5734
you're doing something wrong, after 2 years I am still in profit  having / trading / mining KMD assets

[07-Aug-19 04:56 PM] Tek#5253
> absolute state

[07-Aug-19 04:56 PM] Oszy#5734
and calling our Pirate as a scam, i can't even comment that.

[07-Aug-19 04:56 PM] Tek#5253

ARRR Pirate is a killer buy, KMD is a killer buy..Can't stop lootin my stash to buy pirate wares, killin me 😱

[07-Aug-19 05:03 PM] p.#1126
like killer as in kill your BTC

[07-Aug-19 05:03 PM] meatspoon#7860
ARRR is the most private because no one owns it

[07-Aug-19 05:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
ARRR was about as half baked as a crypto project could be.  I was watching people talk it up as it began.  It was totally fly-by-the-seat of your pants style

[07-Aug-19 05:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
like KMD, there was no marketing.  a crappy website, a few big miners cranking out ARRR and hyping it

[07-Aug-19 05:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
and just like KMD, everyone saying the tech beats the pants off of Zcash and Monero.... as always, forgetting that first mover advantage means more than tech

[07-Aug-19 05:05 PM] Tek#5253
sounds like as scam

[07-Aug-19 05:05 PM] Tek#5253
😄

[07-Aug-19 05:06 PM] meatspoon#7860
heh, i wouldnt necessarily label it as a scam.  But the hype that the big miners slathered all over it was scammy

[07-Aug-19 05:07 PM] Tek#5253
my frend in my discord almost bought pirate at 2k sats

[07-Aug-19 05:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
whats it at now?

[07-Aug-19 05:09 PM] Markus#5464
500

[07-Aug-19 05:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
Best Tech!

[07-Aug-19 05:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
it was only a few weeks ago in here that people were hyping it talking about "the next leg up"

[07-Aug-19 05:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
my guess is most of those hyping it were miners looking to bukkaki their coins all over fanbois

[07-Aug-19 05:10 PM] Flexatron#8809
Lol the hate

[07-Aug-19 05:11 PM] Markus#5464
first kmd now pirate

[07-Aug-19 05:11 PM] Tek#5253
I don't even understand who would even invest in such a shitty name

[07-Aug-19 05:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
not hate, but after watching the hype train for months in silence, i am gonna throw some shade

[07-Aug-19 05:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
i had my opinions then.  i just didnt share them

[07-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Tek#5253
if you tell a adult investor person "Yeah you should invest in Pirate, the ticker is ARRR" is gonna laugh in your face

[07-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Flexatron#8809
So ZEC and Monero acknowledging arrr is fake as well

[07-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Flexatron#8809
Because price is low now

[07-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Flexatron#8809
Everything is a scam when it's cheaper apparently

[07-Aug-19 05:13 PM] Flexatron#8809
:troll_hmm:

[07-Aug-19 05:13 PM] Tek#5253
implying 90% of alt coins aren't scams to take your buttcoins

[07-Aug-19 05:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
ARRR isnt fake.  and I know all alts are getting hammered.  I am just pointing out the nonsense attitude of KMD maximalists who were saying ARRR was going to out perform Monero and Zcash... a truly absurd statement to make

[07-Aug-19 05:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
not a scam either

[07-Aug-19 05:13 PM] Flexatron#8809
You can only know after a couple of halvings

[07-Aug-19 05:14 PM] SHossain#0007
no matter what you say and how you word it, Tek will say it's scam unless it isn't DASH

{Reactions}
😆 (2) ✅ (2) 

[07-Aug-19 05:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
but KMD purists love to punch well above their weight class

[07-Aug-19 05:14 PM] Tek#5253
Dash xmr bch eth

[07-Aug-19 05:14 PM] SHossain#0007
like no one ever scammed with eth

[07-Aug-19 05:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
"KMD is so much better than shitcoin ETH, we will over take it!"  "ARRR is so much better than Monero, ARRR will overtake it!"

[07-Aug-19 05:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
its like watching a flea talk shit to an elephant

[07-Aug-19 05:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
we all have one of those little friends who gets all tough at the bar after his 4th drink and thinks he can kick everyones ass...  KMD is that diminutive, belligerent, drunk dude.

ARRR is supirior than XMR

[07-Aug-19 05:16 PM] Tek#5253
yeah, try buying anything with ARRR

[07-Aug-19 05:16 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[07-Aug-19 05:16 PM] Tek#5253
idiot

[07-Aug-19 05:16 PM] meatspoon#7860
you can say that and i wont argue against it.  but if you say it will overtake XMR, you are.... probably not correct

[07-Aug-19 05:16 PM] Markus#5464
indeed, remember those smart contract dividend payout on eth......probably hundreds of millions scammed that way

[07-Aug-19 05:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
once again, i am not saying scam.  I am saying "delusions of grandeur".    Big difference

[07-Aug-19 05:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
in technology terms, KMD and PIRATE are outperforming any other project.
keep denying it.

[07-Aug-19 05:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
i am not denying it

[07-Aug-19 05:18 PM] meatspoon#7860
this is part of the problem with KMD folks.  they dont listen

[07-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Tek#5253
> muh tech

[07-Aug-19 05:18 PM] p.#1126
who is confirming this claim, the KMD community or the whole crypto space?

[07-Aug-19 05:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
muh dash 😂

[07-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Tek#5253
atleast dash is usable

[07-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Tek#5253
what do you need kmd for?

[07-Aug-19 05:18 PM] p.#1126
if XMR says, wow ARRR is superior, then it might be

[07-Aug-19 05:18 PM] meatspoon#7860
but 10 dudes sitting around circle jerking about their tech doesnt mean shit when no one else knows about KMD and everyone is dumping their infrastructure dollars into ETH

☝ 

[07-Aug-19 05:18 PM] p.#1126
but no one is saying that but you

[07-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Markus#5464
and Dash indeed didnt start as a scam at all :troll_lol:

[07-Aug-19 05:19 PM] SHossain#0007
LTC is usable. why do you need DASH for?

[07-Aug-19 05:19 PM] Tek#5253
instant payments

[07-Aug-19 05:19 PM] SHossain#0007
why do you need instant payment if you can get payment?

[07-Aug-19 05:19 PM] Tek#5253
cause I use it to buy shit in shops

[07-Aug-19 05:19 PM] Tek#5253

[07-Aug-19 05:20 PM] SHossain#0007
always insulting people

[07-Aug-19 05:20 PM] Tek#5253
> always

[07-Aug-19 05:20 PM] PHBA2061#2530
btc payment is instant too, I bet most people don't even know how to double spend it

[07-Aug-19 05:20 PM] Tek#5253
can't use it in shops, fee too high

[07-Aug-19 05:21 PM] Tek#5253
shops don't acccept it

[07-Aug-19 05:21 PM] Tek#5253
costs too much

[07-Aug-19 05:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

@Tek be respectful and don't be insulting.
