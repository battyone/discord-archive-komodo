Binance resets API keys en masse amidst fear of Syscoin blockchain...
It appears that Syscoin (SYS) cryptocurrency's blockchain has been compromised. Syscoin's blockchain explorer shows that more than one billion of its coins were mined in a single block. This is peculiar because the cryptocurrency's total possible supply is 888 million.

Log charts show exponential vs super exponential growth better some guy told me last year when he was trying to explain that charts cannot go parabolic and that term was mathematically incorrect.
