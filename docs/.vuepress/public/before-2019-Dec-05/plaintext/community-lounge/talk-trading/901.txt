Just reading that usa will try to prevent iran from mining btc. How is that even possible..cut the internet cord or what

[08-Jul-19 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If they stopped mining BTC would they not just mine something else and trade it for BTC... seems to be they would need to cut the whole countrys power to do that.

Iran Accuses US of Looking to Thwart Its Bitcoin Mining Operations...
Iran in recent months has been flooded with Chinese bitcoin miners. Now, an Iranian politician believes the U.S. is looking to stop them.

Why dump pls

[08-Jul-19 08:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
More marketing?!?

[08-Jul-19 08:26 AM] Malti#3948
coingirl has to come back to complain

[08-Jul-19 08:27 AM] actionslacks#4072
china will issue a state sponsored crypto soon. it will likely be a sha 256 algorithm from what i've heard. pointing bitcoin mining infrastructure at it will probably be easy

[08-Jul-19 08:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
whole world is gonna change when king dollar falls

[08-Jul-19 08:40 AM] jansako#3330
TBH it does not make sense for a state to release a POW coin... I would expect a POS or a variant thereof where they have full control over the whole supply at start, and maybe built in functionality that allow them to manipulate balances at will. That is of course a disaster in making, but I just do not see a government like the Chinese (or any other) giving up control if they can gain it instead...

[08-Jul-19 08:41 AM] jansako#3330
Imagine the argument: there can be no hacks or criminal activity if we can just seize the coins & return them to the rightful owner at any time!

[08-Jul-19 08:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
I heard it from jared tate of digibyte at a convention. he's spent some time in china. he mentioned it being a part of the belt and road initiative. this was a couple years ago though. just seems like some things are leaning in that direction. increased hostilities, trade wars, etc

[08-Jul-19 09:01 AM] Markus#5464
bitmex is so terrible... when there is too much activity u cant even market buy u get popup that queue is full lol

[08-Jul-19 09:18 AM] dxer666#8963
when 12k?

[08-Jul-19 09:22 AM] dxer666#8963
kmd

[08-Jul-19 09:27 AM] PHBA2061#2530

[08-Jul-19 09:27 AM] dxer666#8963

`why not today?` that's the million $ question there ...

[08-Jul-19 09:30 AM] dxer666#8963
btc up, alts down in btc value

[08-Jul-19 09:31 AM] dxer666#8963
kmd dumpped from 16k to 13k , maybe we see 12-11k soon

[08-Jul-19 09:41 AM] Malti#3948
nSPV dev goes really well and fast

1/tech

[08-Jul-19 09:41 AM] Markus#5464
knew i should of taken more profits then i did at 16k to buy back cheaper, oh well i quess u learn from mistakes ðŸ‘Œ

[08-Jul-19 09:42 AM] Malti#3948
timing the market is extremely difficult

[08-Jul-19 09:42 AM] Malti#3948
had the discussion yesterday with a no-coiner that was almost scoffing me for not taking all out in december 2017

[08-Jul-19 09:42 AM] Malti#3948
looking at the charts retrospectively is easy

[08-Jul-19 09:43 AM] Malti#3948
but at the time, you don't know what direction it's going and you fomo in a sense

[08-Jul-19 09:43 AM] Markus#5464
well not necessarily, if u look how much kmd went up a pullback was expected but i was also thinking there would be more buy support considering rebrand coming up rly soon

[08-Jul-19 09:43 AM] Malti#3948
yes, but where will the pullback happen, that is always the question

[08-Jul-19 09:44 AM] Malti#3948
going from 10k sats to 13k could make you think 'should get out', but then you see it going to 16k

[08-Jul-19 09:44 AM] Malti#3948
now it's settling around the 14k level

[08-Jul-19 09:44 AM] Markus#5464
I think pullback would of been later if btc didnt breakout from the triangle, but the breakout was pretty weak

[08-Jul-19 09:45 AM] Malti#3948
that's why I refrain from trading as much as possible. I just decide to add on positions or build off on longer term

[08-Jul-19 09:45 AM] Markus#5464
target was 12500 it barely went to 12k

[08-Jul-19 09:45 AM] Malti#3948
btc always done it lol

[08-Jul-19 09:46 AM] Markus#5464
now im not sure, depends how this situation with btc goes on... this might have been a bull trap also

[08-Jul-19 09:46 AM] Markus#5464
cause i dont see any follow up

[08-Jul-19 09:46 AM] Malti#3948
the whole run from 3k to 11K bull trap?

[08-Jul-19 09:47 AM] Markus#5464
no breakout from 11.4k

[08-Jul-19 09:47 AM] Malti#3948
ah

[08-Jul-19 09:47 AM] Malti#3948
yes, let's see how it goes. I hope to see stairway moves in btc to ath with some mini alt szn in between

[08-Jul-19 09:47 AM] Malti#3948
seems to be the most organic for the market imo

[08-Jul-19 09:48 AM] Markus#5464
i want to see btc go sideways that would create nice swings when it comes to alt coins

[08-Jul-19 09:48 AM] Malti#3948
and would mean a more mature market

[08-Jul-19 09:48 AM] Markus#5464
30% swings for kmd

[08-Jul-19 09:48 AM] Malti#3948
well yeah, staircases => btc up 20% (e.g.) then some sideways movement for 20+ days => alts

[08-Jul-19 09:48 AM] Malti#3948
and so on

[08-Jul-19 09:49 AM] Markus#5464
but nobody knows

[08-Jul-19 09:49 AM] Malti#3948
true lol

[08-Jul-19 09:49 AM] Markus#5464
if btc decides to go insane and straight to 16k

[08-Jul-19 09:49 AM] Markus#5464
alts will probably make new lows

[08-Jul-19 09:49 AM] Malti#3948
muh, in the end it wouldn't hurt my portfolio fiat wise that bad

[08-Jul-19 09:50 AM] Malti#3948
btc wise other question, but then again, alt szn will follow

[08-Jul-19 09:50 AM] Markus#5464
well idc about fiat im working on compounding up more btc

[08-Jul-19 09:50 AM] Markus#5464
thats why i do bitmex regularly last times to make more btc

[08-Jul-19 09:50 AM] Malti#3948
you leverage?

[08-Jul-19 09:50 AM] Markus#5464
to then buy alts to make even more btc

[08-Jul-19 09:50 AM] Markus#5464
yes 10x

[08-Jul-19 09:51 AM] Malti#3948
daredevil ðŸ˜„

[08-Jul-19 09:51 AM] Markus#5464
but i do quick trades

[08-Jul-19 09:51 AM] Markus#5464
most of times 2-3 a day

[08-Jul-19 09:52 AM] Malti#3948
which pairs do you mostly leverage?

[08-Jul-19 09:52 AM] Markus#5464
bitcoin only sometimes eth if i see a quick opportunity

[08-Jul-19 09:52 AM] Malti#3948
nice

[08-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Markus#5464
but does rarely happen

[08-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Malti#3948
I don't dare to leverage, really

[08-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Malti#3948
i don't mind going all in on 'shitcoins' lol but leverage nope ðŸ˜„

[08-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Malti#3948
well , I *didn't* mind

[08-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Markus#5464
its scary in the begin before u get a feeling and a good strategy going

[08-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Malti#3948
what's your main indicator?

[08-Jul-19 09:54 AM] Markus#5464
i have made my own indicator to catch possible reversal points when the market is overbought/oversold in lower timeframes like 15/30 min

[08-Jul-19 09:54 AM] Malti#3948
do you have a tradingview chart?

[08-Jul-19 09:55 AM] Markus#5464
yes i use tradingview

[08-Jul-19 09:55 AM] Malti#3948
your own charts? would you be willing to share the link?

[08-Jul-19 09:55 AM] Malti#3948
i don't chart myself, but like to look at others

[08-Jul-19 09:55 AM] Malti#3948
good learning experience

[08-Jul-19 09:56 AM] Markus#5464
considering i trade bitmex on lower timeframes i need fresh data all the time, atm im at work so my charts are not up to date

[08-Jul-19 09:56 AM] Malti#3948
ok ok got it

[08-Jul-19 09:57 AM] Markus#5464
most important when u start with bitmex dont get greedy, take profits

[08-Jul-19 09:59 AM] Malti#3948
when was binance going to open leverage trading?

[08-Jul-19 09:59 AM] Markus#5464
not sure

[08-Jul-19 10:00 AM] Markus#5464
i wonder if they will allow leverage for alts

[08-Jul-19 10:02 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
