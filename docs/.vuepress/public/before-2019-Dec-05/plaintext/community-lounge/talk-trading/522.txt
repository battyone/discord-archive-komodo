deleting channels that have people complaining, banning people for asking legit questions... those are not signs of open communications

[07-Apr-19 08:13 PM] Alright#0419
to clarify, they locked the channel, not deleted, I was mistaken

[07-Apr-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, so people couldnt type anymore, but still it could be seen. if so, then not as bad

[07-Apr-19 08:14 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
what channel are you guys talking about?

[07-Apr-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
but all the aggressive misinformation against dPoW, it just seems a waste of time

[07-Apr-19 08:14 PM] Alright#0419
but yes, they do a large amount of censorship in their discord. They say "no trading talk" and use this to justify deleting comments, but I've seen comments not related to trading deleted en masse

[07-Apr-19 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
did they convince you they have a legit protocol?

[07-Apr-19 08:15 PM] Alright#0419
not at all

Can't argue with that statement.

[07-Apr-19 08:16 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
Hopefully it will come with the new whitepaper

[07-Apr-19 08:17 PM] Alright#0419
It was a productive conversation though. I asked if they were aware that ZEN claims to accomplish the same thing without interacting with a separate chain. Their response was that it had weak subjectivity. I need to research ZEN's mechanism more before I can speak on that though

[07-Apr-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
what did they say about the attack in the medium article

[07-Apr-19 08:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`How can they without showing me code?`
So you no longer trust NH? :troll:

[07-Apr-19 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
detecting the attack is useless to stop it and exchanges cant be bothered to make any changes to their code, i guess maybe if the exchange is heavily vested then they might

[07-Apr-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, ZEN approach is self-referential, and has no external point of reference

[07-Apr-19 08:24 PM] PHBA2061#2530
the guy who wrote the medium article doesn't even care to give a proper response when we pointed out his mistakes, he's just a community member though.

If someone in our community was posting blatantly incorrect info, I would kindly ask them to update it

[07-Apr-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
and invariably, people seem to listen about things like that

[07-Apr-19 08:31 PM] crunchycat#0726
guys I can message ambroid to update his article but also no guarantee he'll listen to me either

[07-Apr-19 08:32 PM] crunchycat#0726
Can someone dm me the incorrect  statement, followed by what is should say and I'll send it to him?

[07-Apr-19 08:32 PM] crunchycat#0726
it's not beneficial to either project if bad info is out there circulating

[07-Apr-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty much everything he said about dPoW is technically incorrect

[07-Apr-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
it might be easier just to remove the lies and just mention that dPoW exists without much details

[07-Apr-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
trying to make VBK sound good by posting misinformation about dPoW, just makes VBK look desperate. many people in the industry know enough about KMD to understand this

[07-Apr-19 08:40 PM] crunchycat#0726
okay characterizing these as "lies" is not helpful since it is actually misinformation.  There's no need to bring emotion into technical ideas/discussion

[07-Apr-19 08:41 PM] crunchycat#0726
if people were messaging ambroid saying "remove these lies!" then I could understand that he didn't reply

[07-Apr-19 08:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Emotion?

[07-Apr-19 08:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
jl is an AI sent to us by crypto gods, he eats dPoW and shits blessed lines of C code.

[07-Apr-19 08:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Doesnt have time for mere mortal stuff like emotions

[07-Apr-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
"Komodo DPoW, which is a centralized solution, qualitatively very similar to PoP."

[07-Apr-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
that is quite bogus, when does misinformation turn into a lie? Maybe when the misinformation is not corrected after the author knows that is incorrect?

[07-Apr-19 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
calling dPoW centralized would be like calling it closed source, when it isnt

[07-Apr-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if the author cannot understand what it means to be centralized then maybe he shouldnt be using it when describing other projects

[07-Apr-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the misinformation part would be "qualitatively very similar", this is i guess arguable at some level, assuming VBK is actually 51% prevention instead of just 51% detection that it looks like. At at some point 10x, 100x, 1000x the BTC tx, it becomes so inefficient that it changes its quality

[07-Apr-19 08:50 PM] crunchycat#0726
So you're talking about the once sentence:
``Komodo DPoW, which is a centralized solution, qualitatively very similar to PoP.``

[07-Apr-19 08:51 PM] crunchycat#0726
oh my bad, just saw the second mention of Komodo in it

[07-Apr-19 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
yes that entire paragraph is just nonsense

[07-Apr-19 08:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_wonders if @crunchycat ever fact-checked and corrected his own article about Komodo_

[07-Apr-19 08:57 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@crunchycat  you can check the medium comment I made too, these are misinformation:
```
In Komodo, which is a system very similar to Delegated Proof of Stake, the Notary nodes automatically put their OP_RETURN proofs into the Bitcoin blockchain just by the virtue of existing. These nodes get their rewards by securing the DPoS system
```
comaparing dPoW to dPoW is just totally wrong ... thank you for forwarding this message to ambroidcrypto ...

lol "I posted an article" meaning I posted a link to an article in the KMD discord

funny how your stories change with every question someone asks you a question about it 🤔

seriously man?  read that post in context

nobody took that as I wrote an article

@crunchycat Either you are lying or you "posted an article" that you used 4th party info in and contacted no one involved :thinking:

the clarification "in context"

[07-Apr-19 09:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you don't "use information" in merely "posting a link"

[07-Apr-19 09:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`nobody took that as I wrote an article`
I did and that's why the clarifying question came

so...read it in context

[07-Apr-19 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
They're my comments, I'm well aware of the context

[07-Apr-19 09:12 PM] crunchycat#0726
then how did you think I wrote that article?

[07-Apr-19 09:13 PM] costa2439#3771
Is Dpow autonomous? or is someone responsible for validating the winners of the elections?

[07-Apr-19 09:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because that's the generally accepted meaning of "I posted an article" as opposed to "I linked to an article"

[07-Apr-19 09:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Autonomous

[07-Apr-19 09:16 PM] costa2439#3771
Can it work without the interaction of any user of this discord?

[07-Apr-19 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
a candidate needs to be able to run a NN node, also the pubkeys need to be known. VOTE2019 is airdropped. The richlist for it determines the winners

[07-Apr-19 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
everybody can calculate their own richlist locally with a getsnapshot rpc call

[07-Apr-19 09:45 PM] costa2439#3771
Ok, thanks

veriblock stopped PoP mining or how come btc unconfirmed transactions became just 6k?

[07-Apr-19 09:51 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
This is how BTC works. I hope you guys will understand that vbk has nothing to do with BTC fees increasing.

[07-Apr-19 09:51 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
In a near future.

[07-Apr-19 09:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` I hope you guys will understand that vbk has nothing to do with BTC fees increasing`
That's a nice delusion you got going on there....

[07-Apr-19 09:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
do you often detach from reality?

[07-Apr-19 09:53 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
Neah. Last night many blocks included 1sat/byte transactions. So I kinda know what I'm talking. Vbk had nothing to do with the 100+ fees that we had in the last week.

[07-Apr-19 09:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you're comparing apples to oranges and determining that bananas aren't avocados because blueberries taste better 😕

[07-Apr-19 09:55 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
As you say dude. You are smart enough to understand that vbk had nothing to do with the 100+ fees. I won't even try to argue with you.

[07-Apr-19 09:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you cannot throw 5100+ txes at a block that only holds 4200 and claim that it has "nothing" to do with fees

[07-Apr-19 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
if you can't see the correlation between VBK and BTC fees rising, you are 🙉 🙈 or 🙊

[07-Apr-19 09:57 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
When feed were 100+ vbk had 7%..so that's no way need your 5k tx.

[07-Apr-19 09:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it may not be the *only* factor, but claiming "nothing" = 💩

[07-Apr-19 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
You have people bragging in the discord about how much they're paying in fees

[07-Apr-19 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
had* I guess

[07-Apr-19 09:58 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
I give you math and you give me shit lol. So stupid. 8% is not 5kts from a 4ktx block. So like wtf

[07-Apr-19 09:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`When feed were 100+ vbk had 7%..so that's no way need your 5k tx.`
yes, and the other 93% created the 80k backlog

[07-Apr-19 10:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I give you math `
where?

[07-Apr-19 10:00 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
So this means 7% increased the fees to 100+?

[07-Apr-19 10:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I missed the "math"; please link again

[07-Apr-19 10:01 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
And why when vbk was in test net with 35% fees were rarely over 10?

[07-Apr-19 10:11 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
Math: 5000=7% and 4000=100% in your eyes.

[07-Apr-19 10:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
math = only *x* txes fit in a block and if you want to be in *x* then you have to pay more than the guy paying *w*

[07-Apr-19 10:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when you create *x* + 900, **every** block, you will cause anyone paying less per weight than you did to pay more to get included

[07-Apr-19 10:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because, feken math

[07-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
This still doesn't amswer my question. I know how txs are" selected" to be included in the next BTC block.

[07-Apr-19 10:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I know how txs are" selected" to be included in the next BTC block.`
so, you *know* that in order to be "selected" people have to pay more than you did, which means you know you're full of 💩

[07-Apr-19 10:19 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
And why when vbk was in test net with 35% fees were rarely over 10? This is my question to you. You blame vbk for the 100+  fee. Please enlighten me

[07-Apr-19 10:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
even if we pretend that your 7% number isn't pulled out your ass, that still means that in order for people to send cash from peer to peer, they have to pay more than an additional 7% did

[07-Apr-19 10:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`You blame vbk for the 100+ fee.`
show me where I did that....

[07-Apr-19 10:22 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
It's not from my ass. It's was on explorer a few days ago. We even got as low as 5,9 or 6,9. Talking shit is very easy. Anyone can do that 😂. Good talk.
