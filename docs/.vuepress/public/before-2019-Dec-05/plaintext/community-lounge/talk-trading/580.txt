Sometimes i read a post about komodo on the chans and it gets complety ignored

[25-Apr-19 03:37 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
What does this mean fkn hell :)

[25-Apr-19 03:42 AM] Alexfrog#1338
some of the FUD about eth (chain bloats massively), is true and has always been true, but the market never seems to care

[25-Apr-19 03:45 AM] richardt#2807
I've seen FUD for KMD out there, just not a lot of it.  It seems the bigger the project, the more FUD is visible

[25-Apr-19 03:46 AM] richardt#2807
I also do find it weird that a lot of people seem to completely dismiss/ignore KMD.  Especially people who you'd think would be interested in it and what it stands for, i.e. Andreas Antonopoulos

Yes eth is a shitcoin but i have also read personal atackss against vitalik , highscool dropout etc, nothing of the likes for jl777. 

Yes its strange its gets ignored on all channels. Guess it will come over time

[25-Apr-19 03:49 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
When big tech picks KMD for some popular application, the big dogs will have a closer look

[25-Apr-19 03:49 AM] richardt#2807
Well, it is a lot easier to FUD someone who is publicly known 😄

[25-Apr-19 03:50 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@richardt you could fud about him being Anonymous tho

[25-Apr-19 03:51 AM] richardt#2807
But that's really about it... hard to dig up dirt on someone you don't know

[25-Apr-19 03:51 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Y got a point lol

[25-Apr-19 03:51 AM] Alright#0419
you guys want FUD? 😂

[25-Apr-19 03:51 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Jl777 is more secure than satoshi.  MacAfee is about to unmask satoshi.  No such threat to James

[25-Apr-19 03:52 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
James > satoshi

[25-Apr-19 03:52 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Alright give it

[25-Apr-19 03:52 AM] Alright#0419
Geez this project sucks, we dont have enough people FUDing it

[25-Apr-19 03:52 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i remember reading people calling jl777 a scammer several years ago

[25-Apr-19 03:52 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
KMD > BTC

[25-Apr-19 03:52 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Hahahaha lmao

[25-Apr-19 03:55 AM] Alright#0419
lack of FUD is likely because we aren't FUDing other projects like crazy

[25-Apr-19 03:55 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
jl777 is anonymous

“So that means the code on github doesn’t work?”

b..but nobody knows who he is, could be a scammer

“So the revolutionary open source toolset he built isn’t actually functioning on my computer?”

An.. anonymous is bad

[25-Apr-19 03:57 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Maybe its just not fuddable

[25-Apr-19 03:57 AM] Alexfrog#1338
I havent gotten a dividend on supernet in over a year.  Jl777 is clearly a scammer. 😄

[25-Apr-19 03:57 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
And gets ignored because everyone wants to buy cheap before blowup

one of the major problems I see with ETFs is that the fund manger will have power over consensus rules to some extent

[25-Apr-19 04:06 AM] Alright#0419
like they will have significant about of coins, they will be able to decide to support forks or not

[25-Apr-19 04:07 AM] Alright#0419
I believe ETFs are objectively bad from a technical perspective

[25-Apr-19 04:10 AM] richardt#2807
I've always wondered if one of the fundamental flaws of crypto is actually the assumption that people want the responsibility of being in full control of their money

[25-Apr-19 04:13 AM] Alright#0419
I can't wait to see the first ETF hack. People will invest in them based on them being "safer". This is so far from the truth. It hurts my brain.

[25-Apr-19 04:13 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Safer as in insured

[25-Apr-19 04:14 AM] Alright#0419
would they liquidate it at that point?

[25-Apr-19 04:14 AM] Alright#0419
I can't see how insurance helps in this situation, if the coins are gone, they're not likely to be recovered

[25-Apr-19 04:14 AM] Alright#0419
insuring it with fiat, does not accomplish what you might think

@bergealex4 I think long long term (30-50 years) you'll be able to do everything on top of Bitcoin and there will be no use for any other cryptocurrency. But for the next Bitcoin bull run, a Lightning Network on top of Litecoin could provide a use case.

and LN

[25-Apr-19 10:47 AM] Tek#5253
just goes to show any LN enabled coin is just the same Blockstream cone

[25-Apr-19 10:47 AM] Tek#5253
wether the underlaying chain is BTC/ LTC or any other of the hundreds of coins that want to scale with LN doesn't matter

[25-Apr-19 10:47 AM] Tek#5253
any LN cone is the same thing

[25-Apr-19 10:48 AM] Tek#5253
so basically we have a pool full of ETH ERC20 shit tokens and a bunch of LN shit token projects

[25-Apr-19 10:49 AM] Tek#5253
then a few that aren't any of these two.

Expecting a slight retrace after days of decline, you are a true wizard 😉

price is disgusting.  i managed to get some more at 18k.  the only consolation is that once its back up, i will have more kmd as a result.
