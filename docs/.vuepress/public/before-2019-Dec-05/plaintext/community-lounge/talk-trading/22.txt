wow EOS is looking like a super solid project now. all of your funds are protected by a random block producer who may or may not be paying attention

[26-Jun-18 10:14 AM] actionslacks#4072
Someone stick a fork in it, or at least get some popcorn. There will be tears.

[26-Jun-18 10:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
didnt we already hit 5.5?

[26-Jun-18 10:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or what was the bottom

[26-Jun-18 10:17 AM] NoLandBeyond#2267
6.94 on finex

[26-Jun-18 10:17 AM] NoLandBeyond#2267
that was the last one

[26-Jun-18 10:18 AM] actionslacks#4072
thats a good idea. a lot of people are gonna be spitting out their coffee soon

[26-Jun-18 10:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
5755 was the last low in finex

[26-Jun-18 10:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
june 24th

[26-Jun-18 10:20 AM] NoLandBeyond#2267
@Cryptoon i was talking about EOS

[26-Jun-18 10:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Aahhh

[26-Jun-18 10:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
my bad

[26-Jun-18 10:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Thought you meant 5.5k usd for BTC

[26-Jun-18 10:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
As that was a support level a lot of people were looking at

[26-Jun-18 10:22 AM] NoLandBeyond#2267
yeah, we will break that support imo

[26-Jun-18 10:23 AM] NoLandBeyond#2267
but will get 1, 2 daily bounces till then...6500 then down then mid 7's then down again

[26-Jun-18 10:23 AM] NoLandBeyond#2267
at least that's what i believe...

[26-Jun-18 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> Wait, but the important question here is... what is so wrong about the EOS blockchain that funds can be so easily stolen if there is no action from bps ?

[26-Jun-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> How in the world they will handle all the hack attempts that constantly occur with a centralized decision making system?

[26-Jun-18 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> Seems like bps will be busy freezing account trying to play the wack a mole game

[26-Jun-18 10:27 AM] NoLandBeyond#2267
the private key generator that some used to register their EOS before mainnet went live was directing them to a hackers link lmao

[26-Jun-18 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> But again, its counter productive for the coin team to be fixing personally all this

[26-Jun-18 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> Seems like a similar thing that what happened to iota

[26-Jun-18 10:30 AM] actionslacks#4072
seems pretty typical. 4 billion isn't enough to afford to hire someone to think bout shit like that, though. better to pay a random block producer 10k a day to ignore his inbox

[26-Jun-18 10:37 AM] NoLandBeyond#2267

[26-Jun-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> Yeah, tron is still not in the present. It still.is the future

The "arbitraitor" attack. This is all getting a bit surreal.

[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> when they have a fishing rod with 4billion in funds being offered to startups... its not so much about being a shitcoin... but more about getting a piece of the cake

its a blockchain but transactions and wallet balances can be changed at any time through "arbitration". Why  didn't I think of that?

With the founders reward, zcash is a regulatable security.

More fun, I will be publishing a paper on how law enforcement can trace it later this year.

Sorry. Privacy is more than what computer geeks think it is. Oh, I used to do forensics for the Fed's. Not so hard.
