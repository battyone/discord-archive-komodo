take your profits kids

[21-Sep-18 11:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I still don't understand how BTC at **any** price over $4200 is a "crash" 😕

[21-Sep-18 11:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_takes his 13x at $6200 and walks away happy_

"but my ripple just got accepted by 6 million more financial institutions"

[21-Sep-18 11:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"Slurp 'N Gulp" isn't a "financial institution" :trollface:

XRP pump after New Years was out of this world, not a HODLer unfortunately

[21-Sep-18 11:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
financial institutions are just office buildings full of tax policy subsidized useful idiots

[21-Sep-18 11:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
much like parking lots

[21-Sep-18 11:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
which are subsidized as well

[21-Sep-18 11:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Great! Now, I'm going to have Pat Benatar stuck in my head all feken day! Thanks!

It could be argued semantically that stay at home moms are long term, exclusive prostitutes

[21-Sep-18 11:38 AM] actionslacks#4072
if you find a good one

[21-Sep-18 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Try that on social media and see how many new female friends you make 😛

[21-Sep-18 11:39 AM] snowdamn#2414
cheap VPS, anyone?

[21-Sep-18 11:39 AM] snowdamn#2414
do you know of any?

[21-Sep-18 11:39 AM] actionslacks#4072
the fairer sex has been programmed and are more susceptible to such propaganda

[21-Sep-18 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"cheap" is a relative term

[21-Sep-18 11:40 AM] snowdamn#2414
relatively cheap :trollface:

[21-Sep-18 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
to some folks $500 per month is "relatively cheap"

I miss the days when SUPERNET was selling for 35KMD 😭

yeah I know, the iron chicken awaits for bdex to kick in again

[21-Sep-18 11:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the main problem with barterDEX atm (other than a fully working GUI) is that "nobody's using it" because "nobody's using it" 😦

[21-Sep-18 11:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
all my shickens are waiting too

[21-Sep-18 11:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
and no one is touching their stash

[21-Sep-18 11:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nah, there's plenty of coins that are priced tradable (COQUI being 1 example), it's just stuck in a giant catch 22 atm

[21-Sep-18 11:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Tbh, in a bearmarket people just trade less. For 2019 being 'the year of the DEX', the bear market couldnt have come at a worse time

[21-Sep-18 11:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that and one of the downfalls is that most folks became "complacent" (for want of a better word) with jl being the only LP and "nobody trading" has stopped others from being LPs

[21-Sep-18 11:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
well for there to be a "year of the dex" there needs to be more than one that actually works

[21-Sep-18 11:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
sure

[21-Sep-18 11:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But atm I'm only buying more with fiat, and hyperdex cant help me with that 😦

[21-Sep-18 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_doesn't have good enough internet to use HyperDEX_

[21-Sep-18 11:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
judging by the dapp traffic on ethereum they cant handle much more transaction volume

[21-Sep-18 11:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
heady days my friends

[21-Sep-18 11:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 not good enough internet? For real?

[21-Sep-18 11:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
to the victor go the spoils

[21-Sep-18 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Cryptoon Since Hyper is all SPV-based, it requires a lot of "back and forth" traffic and the more coins you work with is the worse it becomes on 10MB DSL (especially for a miner like me that's already using a good chunk of their throughput)

[21-Sep-18 11:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
we are perfectly situated to destroy the competition once real demand comes online

[21-Sep-18 11:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
unless blocknet.... pfhh

[21-Sep-18 11:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha, didn't realize that

I ran bdex thru my phone hotspot

[21-Sep-18 11:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
in the middle of nowhere

[21-Sep-18 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I ran bdex thru my phone hotspot`
I live "in the woods", our phones run through an "extender" which uses our internet, so that would actually slow me down 😛

[21-Sep-18 12:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hahaha

[21-Sep-18 12:00 PM] actionslacks#4072
you had the fucking chicken and took the bounty

[21-Sep-18 12:00 PM] actionslacks#4072
partially iirc

[21-Sep-18 12:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you had the fucking chicken and took the bounty`
Yeah and I had to keep DEX to 2 coins and shut down most of my wallets for a week to do that

[21-Sep-18 12:02 PM] actionslacks#4072
well fucking rent an office in a city or some shit. your crocodile tears are meaningless here

[21-Sep-18 12:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I was honestly surprised when they didn't show up shortly after I started mining and our barn was 80F in one corner all winter and our electric bill went up 10x

Tether's Impact on Bitcoin Price Not 'Statistically Significant,' ...
Issuance of tether (USDT), the controversial stablecoin, has had no meaningful impact on the price of bitcoin, a newly published academic study found.

I bought tether at 92 cents, sold it at $1.14, and never looked at it again

[21-Sep-18 12:09 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
USDT is nice to trade for 1 reason - taxes. IF you exchange USD fot BTC you need to tax, if for USDT  - it's crypto:crypto exchange. Do I get it right?

[21-Sep-18 12:10 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@KomodoWorld  It seems like you need and order (or even 2 orders) of magnitute less money (then total CAP) to significantly move price. I'm not sure but it can be like 10% of current BTC calue in USD to move price up 100% or so... might be... so in that terms USDT is significant

[21-Sep-18 12:11 PM] bishop#9773
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 not in the USA

[21-Sep-18 12:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in the US, if you trade x for y (in some CEX or KYC platform), you pay the taxable amount of the USD value of the trade, no matter what x or y is

[21-Sep-18 12:11 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok I hope it's not the case in EU

_is still waiting for the IRS to tell him the USD taxable value of TESTCOINA..._

[21-Sep-18 12:13 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  that means for every trade you need to make a log / save it properly

[21-Sep-18 12:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[21-Sep-18 12:13 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
lots of accounting

[21-Sep-18 12:14 PM] actionslacks#4072
btw its perfectly legal to grow weed here in PNW

[21-Sep-18 12:14 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it's a constant like 1% of overall trade or what?

[21-Sep-18 12:14 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@actionslacks is it also legal to send/trade it?
