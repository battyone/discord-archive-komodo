19043 btc withdrawn from bitfinex past 4 hours

[26-Jun-19 07:38 PM] Markus#5464
in 500+ withdraws

[26-Jun-19 07:39 PM] actionslacks#4072
yes sell everything, it's over.

[26-Jun-19 07:39 PM] Tek#5253
jl 5 days ago : its highly unlikely that it will reach 10k sats.

[26-Jun-19 07:39 PM] LocoMB#8593
so someone really going into BTC to HODL .. oth 500 withdraws makes it ~40 BTC per withdraw

[26-Jun-19 07:40 PM] Ooloo#6672
dont even see people buying KMD though on the way down

[26-Jun-19 07:40 PM] Markus#5464
nah meant each withdraw was more then 500 btc

[26-Jun-19 07:41 PM] LocoMB#8593
it's just fiat pegbots, nothing with any complex intention

[26-Jun-19 07:41 PM] actionslacks#4072
you guys understand how much btc kmd has right?

{Reactions}
😂 

[26-Jun-19 07:41 PM] LocoMB#8593
umm.. not right now, how much?

[26-Jun-19 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
@Tek yes, it was surprising this BTC dominance surge without any pause

[26-Jun-19 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD has ~1700 BTC plus working capital

[26-Jun-19 07:43 PM] LocoMB#8593

[26-Jun-19 07:45 PM] LocoMB#8593
any rumours on who is stocking up on BTC?

[26-Jun-19 07:45 PM] Caglio#3337
Is there any chance someone withdraws @ my address by mistake ?

[26-Jun-19 07:45 PM] Caglio#3337
I think its Huawei

[26-Jun-19 07:45 PM] LocoMB#8593

I think $3 bot gets reenabled with Antara launch.

[26-Jun-19 07:49 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Literally 5kmd to even send btc

[26-Jun-19 07:50 PM] BlackJesus#6161
What a tax

[26-Jun-19 07:51 PM] LocoMB#8593
BTC is the gold standard- lugging around a brick of heavy metal is damn cumbersome,
and only viable for larger transactions..
that is why ther is lots of space for smaller denominations, like silver, diamonds, fine art, moonstones, rare Whiskey, ARRR...

[26-Jun-19 07:53 PM] LocoMB#8593
srsly, _Whiskey_ is recommended as store of value in case of economic collapse.. and old cars too btw

[26-Jun-19 07:54 PM] jspook16#3059
What's happening!!!!!

[26-Jun-19 07:54 PM] jspook16#3059

Not buying it loco

[26-Jun-19 07:55 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Your going to have to do more to convince me block space should be artificially scarce

[26-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Bat'leth#7203
So if I’m reading right the Antara project has no reliance or use of the KMD token?

[26-Jun-19 07:57 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Except for dpow

[26-Jun-19 07:57 PM] LocoMB#8593
@BlackJesus indeed, that is my point: there is plenty of block space, just not in BTC blockchain- plenty room for others to thrive

[26-Jun-19 07:57 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Which isnr mandatory

[26-Jun-19 07:58 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Why can't BTC have more space @LocoMB

[26-Jun-19 07:58 PM] LocoMB#8593
bcs .. physics

[26-Jun-19 07:58 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I mean it was addressed as a problem or else LN wouldn't even be a possibly solution

[26-Jun-19 07:59 PM] LocoMB#8593
you can scale a liiitle bit, but there are like.. physics limts..

[26-Jun-19 07:59 PM] BlackJesus#6161
The btc argument is illogical

[26-Jun-19 07:59 PM] LocoMB#8593
128GB blocks like BullshitVersion are simply crank

[26-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Tek#5253
we should be glad btc is crippling itself

[26-Jun-19 07:59 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I've never advocated for blocks that big it's at a paltry 1mb right now

[26-Jun-19 07:59 PM] LocoMB#8593
there are physical limitations, and there is no need to try to fight these

[26-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Tek#5253
dash has 400mb blocks in the roadmap 😉

[26-Jun-19 08:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
yeah but BSV is tyoing with 128GB blocks?!!?

[26-Jun-19 08:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
dash is trash - and will crash

[26-Jun-19 08:00 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm glad 1mb isn't a limitation on other hardware

[26-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Tek#5253
dash > kmd any day

🤦 

[26-Jun-19 08:00 PM] BlackJesus#6161

[26-Jun-19 08:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
hey that rhymes

[26-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Tek#5253
places I can use dash : everywhre
places i can use kmd: nowhere

hidden premine Ponzi scheme w/ masternodes and shitty privacy

[26-Jun-19 08:01 PM] Tek#5253
stay mad ; dash more market reach than any of the shit coins you hold

[26-Jun-19 08:01 PM] LocoMB#8593

[26-Jun-19 08:01 PM] LocoMB#8593

[26-Jun-19 08:08 PM] LocoMB#8593
srsly- 400mb blocks is a stupid idea, and it will fail.. that will be fun!
in any case, the sleazballs that started this ponzi made out like kings for sure, so they wont care
