@hastrup get elected

[30-Aug-19 11:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am pretty sure NNs would come down with fire upon anybody who sold a node against the rules

[30-Aug-19 11:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's slightly inconvenient, but it can be dealt with. Very risky for whoever buys it and tries to keep it secret

[30-Aug-19 11:56 AM] PHBA2061#2530
with a NN op  as middle-man, anyone can buy a NN node I guess, but ofc you have to trust the middle-man

[30-Aug-19 11:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
thems the rules

[30-Aug-19 11:57 AM] hastrup#8742
Where can I read the rules.

[30-Aug-19 11:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain we got rules written down somewhere?

[30-Aug-19 11:58 AM] hastrup#8742
But let me clear I'm not looking to buy a nn!

[30-Aug-19 11:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ca333 and @kolo are the rule whisperers

[30-Aug-19 11:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
The rules should be written down clearly somewhere.

[30-Aug-19 11:58 AM] hastrup#8742
@dukeleto thx I will look into it

[30-Aug-19 11:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
They have changed a bit over time, and so I agree that we should clarify exactly what the rules are. Especially if some people want to break them, like @Deleted User

[30-Aug-19 11:59 AM] phm87#7395
I began to write some then I stop to write. I found no existing written rules

[30-Aug-19 11:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
@phm87 i support you writing them rules down

[30-Aug-19 11:59 AM] hastrup#8742
But are there some counter measurement if it happens? Or is that also in the rules?

[30-Aug-19 12:00 PM] kolo#1111
Rules exist in whitepaper and never changed much

[30-Aug-19 12:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
These rules are important, for when people outside the community accuse us of things/etc

[30-Aug-19 12:00 PM] phm87#7395
@dukeleto it was a draft. One ip per nn as example

[30-Aug-19 12:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@kolo "who is allowed to buy a NN" is not written down anywhere

[30-Aug-19 12:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
edge cases and stuff

[30-Aug-19 12:01 PM] kolo#1111
Edge cases can’t be solved prior

[30-Aug-19 12:01 PM] phm87#7395
Is it forbidden to use vrack ? (As Iam using on all my servers since 2 years except nn srvs) I think it is not allowed

[30-Aug-19 12:01 PM] phm87#7395
Note: vrack is written in my proposal

[30-Aug-19 12:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
it's not about breaking them, past monthes I proved technically that every enforced rule you manage to build can be bypassed in a matter of minutes, it s about having fair ones, and a real governance

[30-Aug-19 12:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
you saw those as bad behaviour, it was meant to help to refine, nothing more, nothing less

[30-Aug-19 12:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
but am done with this, I just wanted to help

[30-Aug-19 12:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
refining an ecosystem is not done by people always saying yes, but people that dig and find issues, and submit them to fix it, so the system is stronger

[30-Aug-19 12:11 PM] hastrup#8742
I don't care that much what dwy. But what I care about is the selling and buying of the nn there should be a clear rule set what is allow and not. If someone misbehave there should be a vote between the nn and if they agree that x nn have done something wrong then a new public vote should happen for that nn.

[30-Aug-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
generally speaking it is not allowed

[30-Aug-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
only in special circumstances are exception allowed and the team ends up buying it and not using it for notarizations

[30-Aug-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
it is impossible to have rules to cover all possible scenarios, at least not without spending a lot of time and effort to create such a set of rules. so we use the practical approach and deal with these edge cases on a case by case basis

[30-Aug-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
there are 64 NN spots, so losing a few is well within the system design. it has built in redundancy

[30-Aug-19 12:26 PM] hastrup#8742
@jl777c ho decidede what is a special circumstance or a personal attack is? Is it one or many that decide? And what about the person that lost the spot whit one vote. should that person not get the chance to prove how good a nn they go be. While there is a nn just doing nothing. Somone voted for dwy, we are not respecting there wish for him to be a nn. their votes should not go to waste, they should get a chance to vote again for somone else then. I can understand that is not that feasible. But I sound like there is room for improvement in the future.

[30-Aug-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
it is unfortunate that elected notaries sometimes end up in a situation where they are not able to do what they promised to do and insist on getting paid for their spots. each year there seem to be a few spots like this, but the alternate NN isnt in a position to pay for it. last year, we had an alternate NN take over one of the spots. as i say it is impossible to know how best to handle all possible things, we just try to do the best we can with each situation.

[30-Aug-19 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
@hastrup if there is indeed an NN candidate that just missed out and wants one of the spots, they can contact me, but so far nobody has

[30-Aug-19 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
in a sense the people that voted for the NN who bailed out, that is who they voted for. why should they get to vote again?

[30-Aug-19 12:47 PM] hastrup#8742
I don't know if there are a nn that almost got in but I could imagine. Why should the people get to vote again. Thats a good question. In my mind it just sounds fair that if it nn is removed involuntary they are not getting what they voted on. I just don't like it possible to buy the nn that is what I'm the most concerned about. There should be something next in line if someone misbehave.

[30-Aug-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
nobody was removed involuntarily

[30-Aug-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
in fact, it was insisted over and over again, that the NN spots "had to be sold"

[30-Aug-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
by the NN operator

regarding LN

[30-Aug-19 01:05 PM] hastrup#8742
I don't know what happens and maybe that is for the best. We are getting small amounts of info here and there. But if this was the best way to handle it  who I'm i to judge. I don't now what happen or i cant code a solution to for it. I want to live in a world where I can trust code not people. But thx for jl for taking the time and answering me :) I appreciate it

reg "rules of selling NN" - guys do we still talk about decentralized permissionless systems? I find it strange people want enforce rules in here, either we talk about permissionless decentralizations, where rules are enforced by the math and code design or politics and personal issues or personal beliefs?

[30-Aug-19 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You cna only put on chain what youc an put on chain

[30-Aug-19 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
everything else must be off chain

[30-Aug-19 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That is why rules exist... Trying to make solution for all rules in code, is impossible

[30-Aug-19 01:58 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
rules not written anywhere and not published are not that much rules for me and can change without anybody noticing, because... not written you know 🙂

[30-Aug-19 01:58 PM] hastrup#8742
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋  yes that is a good point

[30-Aug-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810

sooner or later voting should happend more often among communities - topic based voting / issued based and so on .... seems Verus want to build such thing

[30-Aug-19 01:59 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
then you do not need to write all rules

[30-Aug-19 01:59 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
just vote on issues

Rules exist in whitepaper and never changed much

[30-Aug-19 02:00 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
the issue is controversy, controversy is the issue, discussion and voting is what is used to solve such in democracy

[30-Aug-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so what to do when an elected NN insists that he has to sell his nodes?

[30-Aug-19 02:01 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
which is less violent solution then just enforcing someone to do/not do sth

[30-Aug-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
you suggest a vote., which if the vote said to not allow it, it wouldnt have stopped the NN operator from continuing to demand that he be able to sell his nodes

[30-Aug-19 02:01 PM] hastrup#8742
so what to do when an elected NN insists that he has to sell his nodes? give the node to the second most vots

[30-Aug-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
give?

[30-Aug-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
who pays the original NN?

[30-Aug-19 02:04 PM] hastrup#8742
so its not possible to "give" the node to a the one whit the second most votes?

[30-Aug-19 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no... because the keys cant change

[30-Aug-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
how? when the elected NN was demanding payment

[30-Aug-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the alternate cant be made to pay for the spot

[30-Aug-19 02:05 PM] hastrup#8742
ok that makes sense can a node be voted for again whit a new set of keys?

[30-Aug-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it can, but there is no sense to do this as these nodes can be idle without hurting things.

[30-Aug-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it is best if the next election, operators that wont continue to notarize are not elected
