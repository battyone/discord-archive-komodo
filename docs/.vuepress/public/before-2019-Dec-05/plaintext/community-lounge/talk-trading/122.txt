While DOW are more blue chip companies

@stealth the rebrand is in the initial phase... still talking and conceptualizing. A rebrand is a process where a marketing agency comes in, evaluates your product and your market and develops a completely new branding concept and plan to deploy it.

[30-Aug-18 02:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Cryptoon yes, but DOW is usually the leader in price action regardless of the fundamentals

[30-Aug-18 02:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
SPX and NASDAQ tend to top first, then DOW

[30-Aug-18 02:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
like small caps top first, then the bigger caps

[30-Aug-18 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
btw I have it on good authority that someone high up in the turkish central bank was fired

No sorry 13th of september new inflation numbers

[30-Aug-18 03:37 PM] dan.#2473
even tho FAANG makes up most of the spy, the big picture is that FAANG is still growing revs ~20 percent yoy

[30-Aug-18 03:37 PM] dan.#2473
in other words their valuations are somewhat merited, outside the slight higher than normal PEs

[30-Aug-18 03:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
current valuations already take into account the growth in revenues, problem is that the moment those revenues take a hit or don't continue growing the rate they have been, the price will take a hit

[30-Aug-18 03:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
bit hit

[30-Aug-18 03:39 PM] dan.#2473
that is true

[30-Aug-18 03:39 PM] dan.#2473
and i just checked PEs, yeah theyre getting up there

[30-Aug-18 03:40 PM] dan.#2473
we will likely see a slowdown in speculation, assuming people stop throwing money at them

[30-Aug-18 03:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ECB balance sheet just hit ATH and I'm not sure they will stop the presses any time soon üò¶

[30-Aug-18 03:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Hi guys. I'm thinking of increasing my kmd holdings by doing a trade. I would like to hear your opinion. Plan: If btc holds it's support (6600-6800)  and starts a pump to trendline (7400-7600) I would Sell KMD for BTC in the beginning,  then sell BTC for USD when it looks like correction starts down to around 6000USD, then rebuy BTC for USD at support and buy (hopefully) cheap KMD at support 16k-ish satoshi. Does it sound stupid? Never done something like this before. Might be KMD holds it's price despite BTC falling. hmm.

[30-Aug-18 04:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I have no advice

good luck

@stnabben we could have all done x10 with trading but we could also have lost 90% exitting at the wrong time

[30-Aug-18 04:46 PM] stnabben#4667
Ye. You guys might be right. It's risky.

[30-Aug-18 04:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
In other news, I‚Äôd have so many more followers on twatter if I could just avoid politics :abusedsmily:

[30-Aug-18 04:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
Can you afford to lose it all ? That s the main question. If that s the case you can mix trading and hodling

[30-Aug-18 04:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Most of cryptotwitter is left wing, my crypto twitter and political twitter aren‚Äôt compatible at all

Do we have a decentralized twitter yet, I thought kimdotcom had something in the works?

[30-Aug-18 05:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think that compared to the right in the US most other countries are pretty center/leftist :p

[30-Aug-18 05:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
True

It's not left or right its progressive and conservative

[31-Aug-18 04:20 AM] BlackJesus#6161
people who want to change  status quos and those who dont want to change anything

[31-Aug-18 04:20 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I'll always be progressive if it affords more rights to other people especially rights I take for granted.

[31-Aug-18 04:20 AM] BlackJesus#6161
At one point in history ending slavery was a progressive stance

[31-Aug-18 04:24 AM] BlackJesus#6161
The whole argument from conservatives is "Everything is fine the way it is look how great everything is" Progressives always think there's room for improvement.

[31-Aug-18 04:25 AM] BlackJesus#6161
If engineers were conservative we'd still be in horse and buggy or thinking that 65mph was upper limit of combustion engines.

[31-Aug-18 04:29 AM] BlackJesus#6161
republicans use to be progressive

[31-Aug-18 04:29 AM] BlackJesus#6161
THE GOP was the progressive party a century ago

[31-Aug-18 04:29 AM] BlackJesus#6161
that is no longer the case

[31-Aug-18 04:29 AM] BlackJesus#6161

[31-Aug-18 04:30 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Not wanting to adopt universal healthcare is a conservative stance

[31-Aug-18 04:30 AM] BlackJesus#6161
