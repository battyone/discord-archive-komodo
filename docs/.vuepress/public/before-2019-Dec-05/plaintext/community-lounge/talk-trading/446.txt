[27-Feb-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
10BTC typo

[27-Feb-19 12:56 PM] Wazzup#0510
but the guy dumped 87btc worth of kmd

[27-Feb-19 12:56 PM] Wazzup#0510
I am assuming he just triggered stops

[27-Feb-19 12:56 PM] Wazzup#0510
and bought it all up

[27-Feb-19 12:56 PM] dokrates#8987
really?

[27-Feb-19 12:56 PM] Wazzup#0510
Yeah

[27-Feb-19 12:57 PM] Wazzup#0510
volume on 1 min

[27-Feb-19 12:57 PM] Wazzup#0510
was like 300 k KMD

[27-Feb-19 12:57 PM] dokrates#8987
yes

[27-Feb-19 12:57 PM] dokrates#8987
but it looks like he dumped 300k

[27-Feb-19 12:57 PM] dokrates#8987
instead of dumped 10btc and then bought 77btc

[27-Feb-19 12:58 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
anyone selling zex, looking to buy a few million on DP (after negotiating a price)

[27-Feb-19 12:59 PM] Wazzup#0510
700 k of kmd traded last hour

[27-Feb-19 12:59 PM] Wazzup#0510
but buy and sell side have under 100k

[27-Feb-19 12:59 PM] Wazzup#0510
this is hilarious lol

[27-Feb-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
deep cleaning of both sides of the orderbook

[27-Feb-19 01:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
My take on this is that we finally are having more traders than whales.

[27-Feb-19 01:09 PM] Wazzup#0510
"traders" come when it has 40% gains on binance

[27-Feb-19 01:09 PM] Wazzup#0510
That s when people fomo in

[27-Feb-19 01:09 PM] Wazzup#0510
and pump it harder

[27-Feb-19 01:10 PM] Wazzup#0510
Tomorrow will be important day with ETH fork and all

[27-Feb-19 01:11 PM] Wazzup#0510
At this point most of the people  know that you buy prefork

[27-Feb-19 01:11 PM] Wazzup#0510
and then sell the news

[27-Feb-19 01:11 PM] Wazzup#0510
So I am waiting for the day things like these will be priced in

[27-Feb-19 01:30 PM] dxer666#8963
0.0002231  to 2933 very good trade

[27-Feb-19 01:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think the flashcrash was whale selling into his own buy orders to trigger stoplosses to buy even more

[27-Feb-19 01:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
marketsell xx btc worth of kmd, have buy orders placed yourself for higher amounts. Dumping causes price to drop triggering conditional sells?

[27-Feb-19 01:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Buy back more kmd then you initially sold

[27-Feb-19 01:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
??? profit

[27-Feb-19 02:13 PM] Alecandro#1179
Seems likely to me^

[27-Feb-19 02:13 PM] Vertigo#0439
Umm is there a way to claim your kmd tips without exposing yourself?

[27-Feb-19 02:14 PM] jorian#4555
