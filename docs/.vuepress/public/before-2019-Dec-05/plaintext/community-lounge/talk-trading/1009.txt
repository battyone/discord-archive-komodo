[05-Aug-19 04:28 AM] Alexfrog#1338
nothing is as rekt as kmd

[05-Aug-19 04:30 AM] Zerkon21#3586
I don't know what is happening with kmd , but if it goed more under it will reach soon my stop loss limit üòï

[05-Aug-19 04:31 AM] Zerkon21#3586
Which is sad, because the tech and team  is very promising

[05-Aug-19 04:31 AM] Markus#5464
why would u have a stop loss this low

[05-Aug-19 04:31 AM] Markus#5464
i can almost surely tell u that ur stop loss will get triggered at the bottom

[05-Aug-19 04:32 AM] Markus#5464
its not worth to sell at this lvls

[05-Aug-19 04:32 AM] Markus#5464
if u wanted to sell u would do it earlier not now

[05-Aug-19 04:33 AM] Markus#5464
But its ur money ur choice

[05-Aug-19 04:36 AM] Markus#5464
Enough if u look overall market condition if u exclude bitcoin

[05-Aug-19 04:36 AM] Markus#5464
u will see ultimate rekt

[05-Aug-19 04:36 AM] Markus#5464
what does that sign?

[05-Aug-19 04:37 AM] Markus#5464
well since bitcoin goes up so quick now and alts keep suffering it means someone is pushing down alts to buy at extreme low prices

[05-Aug-19 04:37 AM] Zerkon21#3586
I really do  hope so
