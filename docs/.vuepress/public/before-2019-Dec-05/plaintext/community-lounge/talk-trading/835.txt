xmr will keep going up / doing good until btc halves.

[24-Jun-19 07:36 PM] Tek#5253
cuz it has less inflation as bitcoin now

[24-Jun-19 07:36 PM] Tek#5253
thats the reason

[24-Jun-19 07:37 PM] Tek#5253
i wonder if they will manage randomX

[24-Jun-19 07:37 PM] Tek#5253
if they don't they will stop trying fo fight asics

[24-Jun-19 07:37 PM] Tek#5253
im ok with both outcomes

Mercia Popescu Bitcoin OG and Trilema owner, Rumored to have a million bitcoins

Is  of the opinion that btc 0.5.4 is the real Bitcoin. Segwit mearly runs alongside it. Addresses that begin with 1 are the real Bitcoin.

Anonymint takes it a step further and believes that some large group seeks to cause segwit to fork off and thus the 0.5.4 reclaims the mantle. Craig Wright hinted at this plan recently, though I'd be more worried about Mr. Popescu.

Bitcoin : If you go on a Bitcoin fork, irrespective which scammer proposes it, you will lose your Bitcoins.

[24-Jun-19 07:41 PM] Tek#5253
man what a load of crap

[24-Jun-19 07:41 PM] Tek#5253
network derives value from usage and the btc network is limited by 1mb blocks

[24-Jun-19 07:41 PM] Tek#5253
eventually it wont be dominant

[24-Jun-19 07:41 PM] Tek#5253
my bet is ETH will be dominant

[24-Jun-19 07:42 PM] Tek#5253
since it has the most markets

[24-Jun-19 07:44 PM] Tek#5253
the prophecy foretold.

[24-Jun-19 07:45 PM] Tek#5253
its simple man

[24-Jun-19 07:45 PM] Tek#5253
if btc was so great, I would have been putting BTC stickers in the city

[24-Jun-19 07:45 PM] Tek#5253
I didn't

[24-Jun-19 07:45 PM] Tek#5253
it were BCH stickers

[24-Jun-19 07:45 PM] Tek#5253
and i got them for free from some dude who likes crypto and bought it from me in a p2p trade

[24-Jun-19 07:46 PM] Tek#5253
cant wait for the kmd ecosystem to explode tho.

[24-Jun-19 07:46 PM] Tek#5253
gonna be such a kmd maximalist

[24-Jun-19 07:46 PM] Tek#5253
my market research indicates that the talent and devs move away from BTC

[24-Jun-19 07:47 PM] Tek#5253
the mercahnts and users too

[24-Jun-19 07:47 PM] Markus#5464
but u see eth taking over btc...so not sure how ur market research is gonna work out

[24-Jun-19 07:47 PM] Tek#5253
ETH is making more name than BTC

[24-Jun-19 07:48 PM] Tek#5253
give it 5 years

[24-Jun-19 07:48 PM] Tek#5253
the only reason I see ETH taking over BTc is bc BTC is crippled

[24-Jun-19 07:48 PM] Markus#5464
dont get it why ur more into eth then kmd then....compare eth to kmd and tell me what u see that is better. Eth developing shit forever and it never finish, JL develop something for 1 week and its a gamechanger

[24-Jun-19 07:48 PM] Tek#5253
no development except ThE LitEnenIN NeteworKe Goin on there

[24-Jun-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
problem with ETH is that most people cant even sync it

[24-Jun-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the chain is way too big

[24-Jun-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
who here runs a full node for ETH?

[24-Jun-19 07:49 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yup

[24-Jun-19 07:49 PM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD's token solution is far better

[24-Jun-19 07:50 PM] alen#3721
At the end of crypto war....tron will win..and i will shoot myself in the head

[24-Jun-19 07:50 PM] Alexfrog#1338
lol

[24-Jun-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
and if nobody can run a full node, then how can it become anything dominant

[24-Jun-19 07:50 PM] Tek#5253
my vision as i see it, all countries will have a few datacenters that run big nodes. if all countries in the world have a datacenter or a few running nodes it will still be decentralized on  a world wide scale

[24-Jun-19 07:50 PM] Tek#5253
but the neckbeard can't run it in his basement obviously

[24-Jun-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
with BTC at least a pruned node can be synced (eventually)

[24-Jun-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
@Tek all these big data centers are very easy to monitor and control

[24-Jun-19 07:51 PM] Tek#5253
if countries stay national, this is not an issue

[24-Jun-19 07:51 PM] Tek#5253
if one word government

[24-Jun-19 07:51 PM] Tek#5253
then this is fucked

[24-Jun-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
FATF, 200 countries all doing the same

[24-Jun-19 07:51 PM] Tek#5253
tho it doesnt' work for ETH actually since they move to proof of stake

[24-Jun-19 07:51 PM] Tek#5253
it only works for PoW

[24-Jun-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
relying on tech that has to be run in a big data center is not very good

[24-Jun-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt matter if PoS, still users wont be able to sync a node

[24-Jun-19 07:52 PM] Tek#5253
users don't need to sync a node

[24-Jun-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
then it isnt decentralized

[24-Jun-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it is distributed

[24-Jun-19 07:52 PM] Tek#5253
it is if every country in the world has competing datacenters mining and providing service

[24-Jun-19 07:53 PM] Tek#5253
its gonna be a tech war, to develop the best mining chips

[24-Jun-19 07:53 PM] Tek#5253
each country will compete with eachother

[24-Jun-19 07:53 PM] Tek#5253
i dont believe in neckbears running nodes in their basements...

[24-Jun-19 07:53 PM] alen#3721
They all gonna buy from china anyway..so they win

[24-Jun-19 07:54 PM] Tek#5253
no, china doesn't have the cheapest electriciyt now

[24-Jun-19 07:54 PM] Tek#5253
thats iran

[24-Jun-19 07:54 PM] Tek#5253
it changes

[24-Jun-19 07:54 PM] Markus#5464
can promise u that there is insane mining equipment u never seen that are kept secret what wont be for sale

[24-Jun-19 07:54 PM] Tek#5253
obviously.

[24-Jun-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
real decentralization comes from a decentralized infrastructure

[24-Jun-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
not a centralized infrastructure

[24-Jun-19 07:54 PM] Tek#5253
well JL

[24-Jun-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
something like a lot of nodl nodes

[24-Jun-19 07:54 PM] Tek#5253
then i have this argument for you

[24-Jun-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
over mesh networks

[24-Jun-19 07:55 PM] Tek#5253
the current internet infrastructure isn't decentralized

[24-Jun-19 07:55 PM] Tek#5253
the cables and hubs that connect the world

[24-Jun-19 07:55 PM] Tek#5253
are centralized

[24-Jun-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
did you not see where i said "over mesh networks"

[24-Jun-19 07:55 PM] Tek#5253
so 5G

[24-Jun-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
you can see the problem with the centralized internet infrastructure

[24-Jun-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
will be the same with the coins only big data centers can run

[24-Jun-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
we need a many chains, each having nodes that normal people can run

[24-Jun-19 07:56 PM] Tek#5253
the thing is tho, people running nodes, they run them in the same centralized data centers

[24-Jun-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
govts can control the corps as corps dont vote

[24-Jun-19 07:56 PM] Duck Tape#9059
@jl777c  Serieus question. What if you die, what then? Like, will Komodo survive without you? This is a question about decentralization. You are very at the center of the whole Komodo project. What if you disappeared?

[24-Jun-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
govts are reluctant to go en masses after their citizens, though i guess in some they dont really care anymore

[24-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Tek#5253
yeah what about the kmd development centraliziatoin

[24-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Tek#5253
if you r gone

[24-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Tek#5253
kmd is ded

[24-Jun-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
actually no

[24-Jun-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
i trained CC devs and they are doing all the CC development now

[24-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Tek#5253
developer centraliziation is a thing too

[24-Jun-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
the mm2 team is in rust, i cant even code in rust

[24-Jun-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont do gui

[24-Jun-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
this hardfork is being done by others

[24-Jun-19 07:58 PM] Tek#5253
Anyway, I'm betting on many things.

[24-Jun-19 07:58 PM] Tek#5253
I'll get some winners

[24-Jun-19 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
so i would say that komodo will be ok even without me. i purposely only did cli coding and avoided all the non-tech side of things

[24-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Markus#5464
Tek i know ur into the gains lets look at this

[24-Jun-19 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
my contributions now are more at the strategic technical level

[24-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Markus#5464
u like bch, if we compare bch being 470$ towards kmd being 1,4$ which one have more potential to grow?

[24-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Tek#5253
why do you think I even have a kmd bag?

[24-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Tek#5253
its my potential 100x

[24-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Tek#5253
bch is a 10x
