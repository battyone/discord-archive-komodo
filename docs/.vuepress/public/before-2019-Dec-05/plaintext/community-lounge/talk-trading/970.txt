they mine the most profitable chain

[25-Jul-19 05:28 PM] Tek#5253
its the same POW

[25-Jul-19 05:28 PM] Tek#5253
DASH does not have the same algo

[25-Jul-19 05:28 PM] Tek#5253
dash also has anti 51%

[25-Jul-19 05:28 PM] Tek#5253
dash is more secure than bitcoin

[25-Jul-19 05:29 PM] actionslacks#4072
@Tek must have scored some of the good stuff.

[25-Jul-19 05:29 PM] Tek#5253
btc isn't decentralized at all

[25-Jul-19 05:29 PM] Tek#5253
anyone who actually researched knows this

[25-Jul-19 05:30 PM] Tek#5253
P.S rumour says Jihan will dump BSV to $4 soon

[25-Jul-19 05:31 PM] washparkdlt#6482
I doubt it will

[25-Jul-19 05:31 PM] Tek#5253
it will happen when btc is regulated and goverments send each other ten thousands of bitcoins

[25-Jul-19 05:31 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Personally. It’s unlikely I think

[25-Jul-19 05:32 PM] washparkdlt#6482
But it’s possible

[25-Jul-19 05:32 PM] Tek#5253
some hacker stole a govt btc? the mining pools will be contacted and the transaction will be reversed.

[25-Jul-19 05:32 PM] Tek#5253
you can bet on it

[25-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Tek#5253
the mining pools all operate in countries in big datacenters

[25-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Tek#5253
its gonna be easy to control eventually

[25-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Tek#5253
mr neckbeard running a node in his basement brings no value. since he brings no hash

[25-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Tek#5253
95% of btc nodes are useless

[25-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Tek#5253
1mb blocks are rtearded

[25-Jul-19 05:34 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Possible isn’t *immutable* and that’s what’s a bummer

[25-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Tek#5253
right now, yeah, eventually, no.

[25-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Tek#5253
52 mining pools.

[25-Jul-19 05:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`95% of btc nodes are useless`
What if I told you that you are wrong and that if those 95% decide what the other 5% do is wrong then the chain goes some other way....

[25-Jul-19 05:36 PM] Tek#5253
what if i told you that's wrong , no hashrate, no value.

[25-Jul-19 05:36 PM] Tek#5253
they just check and progagate blocks

[25-Jul-19 05:36 PM] Tek#5253
they don't make blocks

[25-Jul-19 05:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Only mining nodes matter` is a silly load of shit

[25-Jul-19 05:36 PM] Tek#5253
it isn't

[25-Jul-19 05:36 PM] actionslacks#4072
1mb blocks when the mempool is completely stuffed everyday is evidence of sabotage.

{Reactions}
troll 

[25-Jul-19 05:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If the majority of nodes agree that your block doesn't mean shit, then your block doesn't mean shit (even if you had all the hash in the world)

[25-Jul-19 05:37 PM] Tek#5253
Doubt. no hash, no power.

[25-Jul-19 05:37 PM] phm87#7395
With segwit tx, btc blocks can be bigger (up to 4 MB I think)

[25-Jul-19 05:38 PM] Tek#5253
hashrate decides the longest chain

[25-Jul-19 05:38 PM] Tek#5253
not neckbeards in their basements

[25-Jul-19 05:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` no hash, no power.`
You **really** need to learn what the word "consensus" means 🤦🏽

[25-Jul-19 05:38 PM] Tek#5253
concensus is reached by the mining pools

[25-Jul-19 05:38 PM] Tek#5253
then neckbeard nodes progagate it

[25-Jul-19 05:38 PM] actionslacks#4072
why did i bring up dash when tek showed up 🤦

[25-Jul-19 05:39 PM] phm87#7395
@Tek I think that exchanges decide what wallet version should be used. If no pools update (except one pool) and all exchanges update, then big pools don t decide

[25-Jul-19 05:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`hashrate decides the longest chain`
not if consensus code declares those blocks invalid

{Reactions}
💯 

[25-Jul-19 05:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can run out 400000000000000000 BTC blocks in the next hour with enough hashrate, but if 95% of the nodes declare them all invalid, length means exactly 0

[25-Jul-19 05:41 PM] Tek#5253
So you really think that when a goverment sends 10k bitcoins ( which is now the reserve currency ) to another government and somehow the transaction gets hacked, the 95% neckbeards will get to decide if the other govt gets its bitcoin

[25-Jul-19 05:41 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[25-Jul-19 05:41 PM] Tek#5253
if you haven't realised yet, Blockchain is the step to enslave humanity

[25-Jul-19 05:41 PM] Tek#5253
not free it

[25-Jul-19 05:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽

[25-Jul-19 05:41 PM] phm87#7395
If new wallets does not reject old version blocks, maybe there is no chainsplit (or a big mess)

[25-Jul-19 05:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_goes back to reading the dev channel (where people that type actually understand how this shit works)_

👍 

[25-Jul-19 05:42 PM] washparkdlt#6482
lol

[25-Jul-19 05:42 PM] Tek#5253
yeah, you run windows nodes and get hacked

[25-Jul-19 05:42 PM] Tek#5253
you don't know shit

[25-Jul-19 05:43 PM] Tek#5253
pathetic

[25-Jul-19 05:43 PM] actionslacks#4072
you really think govts are going to use a means of exchange that isnt controlled by central bankers? without a world war?

[25-Jul-19 05:43 PM] phm87#7395
Lol. Xvg have a network split since few days. Some explorers are on 5.0 chain and others on 4.0 chain. No govt can fix this shit

@Tek The irony is that
a) I lost more than you have ever had
b) even after that, I still have more than you'll ever have

[25-Jul-19 05:44 PM] LocoMB#8593
hahahaha! porndogecoindark again rekt?

[25-Jul-19 05:44 PM] Tek#5253
the irony is that, you are a node operatior for "Muh KMD super tech so great" network and you GOT HACKED

[25-Jul-19 05:45 PM] phm87#7395
@LocoMB it is not ahack here but a network pb and chainsplit

[25-Jul-19 05:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1) It was a worm, not a hack
2) I wasn't a NN then
2) how about you try dissing me from something that's even in __this year__ 🤦🏽

[25-Jul-19 05:45 PM] Tek#5253
> i didn't have secure system
> it's not my fault

[25-Jul-19 05:45 PM] Tek#5253
t. computergeenlet

[25-Jul-19 05:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I never said it wasn't my fault
in fact, I've said 100 times the exact opposite

[25-Jul-19 05:46 PM] Tek#5253
then shut up about "I know how all this works and you don't" cuz you can't even run a secure system.

[25-Jul-19 05:46 PM] Tek#5253
now fuck off

[25-Jul-19 05:46 PM] actionslacks#4072
@Tek needs to go ask his dad if he can take the bimmer out to relax

[25-Jul-19 05:46 PM] Tek#5253
I am relax tbh

[25-Jul-19 05:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`cuz you can't even run a secure system.
now fuck off`
You're confusing `didn't` and `can't`, but I can see how it's hard for you to grasp the difference

Did we decide if btc can be rolled back or not?

{Reactions}
😂 😅 

[25-Jul-19 05:51 PM] actionslacks#4072
if it can be then dPoW may have some issues

[25-Jul-19 05:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Did we decide if btc can be rolled back or not?`
With no code change and enough hash, yes
With code change and any amount of hash, no

[25-Jul-19 05:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but that's a fekload of hash needed to do it

[25-Jul-19 05:52 PM] Tek#5253
yeah but all the hash is directed at the pools. so the 52 pools decide

@Tek do yourself a favor and learn how consensus works before speaking on consensus 🤦🏽

[25-Jul-19 05:54 PM] Tek#5253
validating nodes have no power.

[25-Jul-19 05:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so the 52 pools decide`
no, they don't
they never have
they never will

[25-Jul-19 05:54 PM] richardt#2807
Rollback is possible, but improbable.  Wouldn't rolling back the chain undermine the very thing that gives it value?

{Reactions}
💯 

[25-Jul-19 05:54 PM] Tek#5253
they have, on BCH.

[25-Jul-19 05:54 PM] Tek#5253
few months ago

[25-Jul-19 05:54 PM] Tek#5253
and the BCH and BTC miners are the same

[25-Jul-19 05:54 PM] Tek#5253
what do you not understand

[25-Jul-19 05:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`validating nodes have no power.`
ffs, do you even read *your own words*?

[25-Jul-19 05:55 PM] Tek#5253
neckbeard nodes have no power

[25-Jul-19 05:55 PM] Tek#5253
that better?

[25-Jul-19 05:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
validating nodes validate, you silly fek
if it's not valid then it didn't feken happen

[25-Jul-19 05:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because, Bitcoin

[25-Jul-19 05:56 PM] Tek#5253
block gets mined at the pools. pools decide what progagate, neckbeard nodes just save and progagate

[25-Jul-19 05:56 PM] Tek#5253
you silly fek

[25-Jul-19 05:56 PM] LocoMB#8593
whole BTC network was operated by neckbeards for a looong time initially- what's your point? it is called 'decentralization', this is what blockchains are all about

[25-Jul-19 05:56 PM] Tek#5253
its not decentralized

[25-Jul-19 05:56 PM] Tek#5253
52 pools decide

[25-Jul-19 05:56 PM] LocoMB#8593
53 if I make my own - and a bunch of other neckbeards too

[25-Jul-19 05:56 PM] Tek#5253
you canot make a new pool

[25-Jul-19 05:56 PM] Tek#5253
max 52 pools to mine to
