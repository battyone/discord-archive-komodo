i'll stick to Core until Satoshi signals to abort ðŸ¤“ 
but, then again, some will say he already has...

[14-Nov-18 09:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And high hashpower

[14-Nov-18 09:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its called Proof of Work not Proof me what is satoshis real vision (PMWISRV).

haha

[14-Nov-18 09:50 PM] actionslacks#4072
So we got 18hrs until the fork is implemented and the real fireworks start?

[14-Nov-18 09:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No clue

[14-Nov-18 09:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Why not let the users decide

[14-Nov-18 09:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Why do they want to make it about hash?

[14-Nov-18 10:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Because its proof of work

[14-Nov-18 10:22 PM] Vertigo#0439
Bitcoin Gold is the real satoshi balls deep.

[14-Nov-18 10:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@siu - Chainmakers but both forks exist?

[14-Nov-18 10:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or does the one with most hash survive?

[14-Nov-18 10:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I mean all stupid btc forks with 1% of the hash btc has still exist as well, no?

[14-Nov-18 10:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im not sure about the specifics sincerely

[14-Nov-18 11:21 PM] Alright#0419
there is no replay protection by design

[14-Nov-18 11:21 PM] Alright#0419
so one must die

[14-Nov-18 11:49 PM] twistedmind#1523
listen up, satoshi never mentioned gpus so end of story. bch is ver's attempt at control. he is a douch. btc will always be king...

[15-Nov-18 12:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To be fair, bch is the longest chain, btc segwit coin is only btc, because coinbase said it was. Both ate btc IMO.

[15-Nov-18 12:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And both can die for all I care

As long as kmd has a strong chain to notarise to, it cant exactly notariee to itself, maybe we could notaries to versus instead of versus notarising to us, should both btcs die lol

[15-Nov-18 12:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
BTC is like IPv4 now

[15-Nov-18 12:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Pain

[15-Nov-18 12:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
IoT will boost IPv6 usage and demand, hopefully. 
Along with it many other technologies

[15-Nov-18 12:57 AM] meatspoon#7860
I think some of y'all are so far down the rabbit hole that you say stuff like, "no one likes BTC anymore" without realizing that you are light years ahead of the herd (and quite possibly not in the location that the herd will ever cross through).  BTC in many ways is a favorable alternative to legacy banking.  I get it that those people who are very involved and into crypto are more interested in more complicated and nuanced solutions (often to problems that aren't really that common or widespread), but it might behoove you to take a step back and try to see the forest instead of the trees.  One of the biggest problems in our society is arguably that banks have taken control of nearly everything since they print the money.  BTC may be passe or lame to you guys who have come to understand it and then get bored by it over the years, but for lots of people it is still super duper cool.  And for even more people, they haven't even realized it is super duper cool (yet).  The central banks have had us bent over a barrel for over a century at this point, and like it or not, the best tool we have to un-fuck ourselves right now is BTC, not KMD, not ETH, not XMR, not Zcash.  This will certainly change in time, but for the moment, this is just how it is.

[15-Nov-18 01:04 AM] snowdamn#2414
i hate BCH, but i hate Coinbase even more

[15-Nov-18 01:12 AM] snowdamn#2414
BTC was thriving end of 2017 and Coinbase went ahead and legitimized the premature BCH efforts
fork was a non-event before the listing
now almost a year later nothing but idiocy
FML

[15-Nov-18 01:14 AM] snowdamn#2414
i'm talking about legitimizing the premature efforts, not the fork itself

[15-Nov-18 01:14 AM] meatspoon#7860
@Deleted User "why not KMD or any other coin?"  It is this sort of question that reaffirms that you are so deep in the forest you are only seeing trees.  BTC has been around a decade.  It has never failed.  It has massively more brand recognition than anything else.  Will it be displaced over time?  Yes, but not tomorrow, next month or next year.  Quite possible much longer than that.  The reasons as to "why not any other coin" are so long and (seemingly) obvious that I am not sure where to begin

[15-Nov-18 01:15 AM] snowdamn#2414
so why hadn't other projects way ahead of BCH efforts not get listed?
i'm talking about Coinbase, maybe you think i'm saying something else

[15-Nov-18 01:15 AM] meatspoon#7860
also, the average joe isnt going to understand KMD.  But the average Joe understands dollars because they are simple.  "money".  Try explaining multiple asset chains to someone at starbucks and see how quickly their eyes glaze over

[15-Nov-18 01:16 AM] meatspoon#7860
KMD is not "money" so it cant take the place of BTC

[15-Nov-18 01:16 AM] snowdamn#2414
Coinbase did it on purpose
i wouldn't be surprised if fraud was involved

[15-Nov-18 01:17 AM] meatspoon#7860
and having bugs is different than failing

[15-Nov-18 01:17 AM] meatspoon#7860
you are gonna have to work really hard, because KMD is complicated and people have to actually WANT to understand it to understand it.  People dont even have to understand BTC to understand that it is money

[15-Nov-18 01:17 AM] meatspoon#7860
sure, a near miss

[15-Nov-18 01:18 AM] meatspoon#7860
of course

[15-Nov-18 01:18 AM] meatspoon#7860
i am not saying BTC is perfect.  But i am saying it is waaaaaay more battle tested than any other crypto

[15-Nov-18 01:18 AM] meatspoon#7860
and it has waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more brand recognition

[15-Nov-18 01:18 AM] meatspoon#7860
(lots of a's)

[15-Nov-18 01:18 AM] meatspoon#7860
it is waaaaay simpler to understand

[15-Nov-18 01:19 AM] meatspoon#7860
and it has one, single purpose

[15-Nov-18 01:19 AM] meatspoon#7860
ehhh, no

[15-Nov-18 01:19 AM] meatspoon#7860
the average IQ is 100.  that isnt that smart

[15-Nov-18 01:19 AM] meatspoon#7860
i would bet everyone on this board is north of 100 by a lot

[15-Nov-18 01:19 AM] meatspoon#7860
and some of us dont even really get it

[15-Nov-18 01:20 AM] snowdamn#2414
Coinbase fucked us lol ðŸ˜‚

[15-Nov-18 01:20 AM] meatspoon#7860
people who want a currency that governments can fuck us on just want a currency

[15-Nov-18 01:20 AM] meatspoon#7860
i want to get shitty federal reserve notes out of my life.  I dont want to replace them with something super complicated.  I just want a currency that governments cant print into oblivion

[15-Nov-18 01:21 AM] meatspoon#7860
after we have that, sure there is space for smart contract platforms and ecosystem coins and all sorts of stuff

[15-Nov-18 01:21 AM] meatspoon#7860
but KMD and ETH and NEO and whatever else are all fascinating, but they arent currency.  they are complicated and in a sense they have a lot less potential than just a plain, simple, vanilla currency that works

[15-Nov-18 01:22 AM] meatspoon#7860
I applaud everyone who is thinking 10 steps down the line.  but shit, man, its ten steps down the line

[15-Nov-18 01:23 AM] snowdamn#2414
i'm thinking 10 steps down the line when BTC is > $50k ðŸ˜€

[15-Nov-18 01:24 AM] meatspoon#7860
@Deleted User As to your comment of ease of understanding and brand recognition being only marketing problems... shit man, marketing is KMD's biggest weakness.

[15-Nov-18 01:24 AM] actionslacks#4072
@snowdamn, whats the rundown on coinbase? Did I miss something or are you just saying they shouldnâ€™t have started accepting bch?

[15-Nov-18 01:24 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Credit money has its uses,  cryptocurrencies are more like commodity currencies but the value of commodity currencies is contingent upon the underlying demand and/or utility .

[15-Nov-18 01:24 AM] meatspoon#7860
it is really bold to imply that the marketing of KMD can go from sub-par to outclassing the King

[15-Nov-18 01:25 AM] meatspoon#7860
and by "sub par" i am being super kind

[15-Nov-18 01:25 AM] snowdamn#2414
yes, the Coinbase listing shouldn't have happened so fast after fork is what i'm saying

[15-Nov-18 01:25 AM] meatspoon#7860
BTC "marketed" for 10 years with no marketing department.

[15-Nov-18 01:26 AM] meatspoon#7860
well, emmanuel, do you think i am unable to understand what a crypto is?

[15-Nov-18 01:26 AM] meatspoon#7860
no one wants to use it that way

[15-Nov-18 01:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
Can we save the marketing complaints until after the relaunch?

[15-Nov-18 01:26 AM] meatspoon#7860
millions of people want to use BTC that way

[15-Nov-18 01:27 AM] meatspoon#7860
i am hopeful that the rebrand will help

[15-Nov-18 01:27 AM] meatspoon#7860
but yeah, Emmanuel's comment is true

[15-Nov-18 01:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
educating a public that is oblivious to how the current money system works is the biggest challenge. People ask me to explain bitcoin and usually instantly dismiss it as unnecessary.

[15-Nov-18 01:30 AM] meatspoon#7860
@actionslacks exactly!  they will get their minds around BTC eventually, but to expect them to digest something like KMD and ditch BTC for that...... it may happen, but not soon

[15-Nov-18 01:30 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Re: marketing  ---- from someone who has been in the mix of it for awhile ------ we need more boots on the ground  we have a planet to cover and presence is limited in most areas .  Personally advocate meetups and personal interaction.

bitcoin is super easy to understand and it is a tough sell

[15-Nov-18 01:31 AM] meatspoon#7860
i meant comparatively

[15-Nov-18 01:32 AM] meatspoon#7860
explain BTC to someone... it can be done in 5 minutes.  then try explaining KMD to someone

[15-Nov-18 01:33 AM] meatspoon#7860
and @polycryptoblog , yes, your comment is valid too.  But it also underscores what I am saying.  BTC meetups have been going on for years in so many cities.  That is how far behind KMD is if it is trying to dethrone BTC.  Years and years and years away as there arent even any meetup groups yet

[15-Nov-18 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
BTC isnt money any more ... its digital gold

[15-Nov-18 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its ulsess to get rid of banks

[15-Nov-18 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[15-Nov-18 01:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@meatspoon Indenodes has hosted a yearly meetup,  there have been workshops conducted.  Presentations have happened throughout Europe at meetups.  Also some have been done in the US.    This is only year 2 of Komodo

[15-Nov-18 01:37 AM] meatspoon#7860
well, lets not have double standards here, gentlemen.  If the idea is "don't criticize KMD because we are striving forward" why would the same not be true of BTC?  Will BTC transactions not become cheaper, faster and more secure?

[15-Nov-18 01:37 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Maybe not the last one

[15-Nov-18 01:38 AM] actionslacks#4072
It is a war and it should be approached as such. Maybe csw has the right idea after all. We should stop playing nice.

[15-Nov-18 01:38 AM] meatspoon#7860
@polycryptoblog  and because of BTC's success in the last decade, 2 year old projects benefit from accelerated interest.  No doubt.  But my point is that right now in any decent sized city in the US you can find a bitcoin meetup group and attend.  That has been going on for long, long time

[15-Nov-18 01:41 AM] snowdamn#2414
guys, the total crypto market is under quarter trillion again
these are not the times for tech discussions
the whole sector will go to shit without capital inflow
still hopeful it's just a Wall Street scheme...
