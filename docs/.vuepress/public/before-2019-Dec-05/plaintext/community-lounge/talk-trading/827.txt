[23-Jun-19 12:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Na there is lots of sell pressure  right now too, 60BTC to 20k

[23-Jun-19 12:08 PM] Markus#5464
probably ppl who bought between 12k and 15k who set sell orders to take profits

[23-Jun-19 12:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It bottomed after all

[23-Jun-19 12:20 PM] Duck Tape#9059
@jl777c  One of those doom and gloomers is still here. Seems Komodo is crawling slowly out of its grave again. I'm holding my breath.

[23-Jun-19 12:20 PM] Markus#5464
Grave :troll_lol:

[23-Jun-19 12:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Whos the doom and gloomer?

[23-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Tek#5253
Just got a go long signal

[23-Jun-19 12:25 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@siu - Chainmakers you bought back yet?

[23-Jun-19 12:33 PM] Keppie#5156
I underestimated ARRR ü§¶ Sold a hefty chunk on the kmd pair. You'd assume the arrr/kmd ratio would drop with arrr being at ath & kmd atl

[23-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I was thinking of moving some arrr into kmd

[23-Jun-19 12:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But tbh given the marketcap arrr has, it has the potential to gain faster than kmd

[23-Jun-19 12:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So better to keep waiting for the 5$ ARRR that @siu - Chainmakers promised me

[23-Jun-19 12:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I did below 13k sats... I called the bottom yesterday. It got ugly at some point but i guess the sun came out somewhere in the world and someone woke up with a fat gjnger

[23-Jun-19 12:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Never forget

[23-Jun-19 12:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Lol

[23-Jun-19 12:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
5$ arrr eoy

[23-Jun-19 12:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No promises

[23-Jun-19 12:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Just wild guesses

if privacy coin demands goes higher, I hope that ARRR gets multiple x the value of KMD

[23-Jun-19 12:44 PM] bishop#9773
1M ARRR order at 0.20 KMD

[23-Jun-19 12:45 PM] yorklab#7270
ARRR seems like a wildcard to me. With regulation coming in hot and heavy it will never trade on the man exchanges and the average Joe will never buy it. On the other hand if it becomes the de-facto standard in the unregulated exchanges/DEXs then it can really take off.

[23-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Keppie#5156
Jezus christ, should've shut my mouth here

[23-Jun-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
ATL for KMD was about $6 mil marketcap

[23-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Keppie#5156
Btc wise i meant

[23-Jun-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
in BTC was about 6k sats

[23-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Keppie#5156
You know what I mean üòÑ

[23-Jun-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems with ZEC, GRIN, BEAM, all with massive gains, there is something about privacy coins

[23-Jun-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i wonder what it could be

[23-Jun-19 12:49 PM] Keppie#5156
'privacy'

[23-Jun-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, and it seems some are putting two and two together, ie. the regulations safe harbor that a cross chain atomic DEX is and https://medium.com/@jameslee777/cross-chain-atomic-swaps-using-a-private-transaction-only-chain-like-pirate-9679d636b392

Cross chain atomic swaps using a private transaction only chain li...
Even I had said that doing atomic swaps on a blockchain with only private transactions is not possible. At first (and second and third)‚Ä¶

[23-Jun-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
also, there are ongoing dust attacks to deanonymize the BTC addresses, and my guess is also the XMR. only zeroknowledge privacy systems are immune to dust attacks, yes even mimblewimble is deanonymizable via dust attack, especially in conjunction with a grin-reaper data miner

[23-Jun-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i remember recommending PIRATE at 0.03 to 0.05 KMD range

[23-Jun-19 12:52 PM] Keppie#5156
mmm

[23-Jun-19 12:52 PM] Keppie#5156
I bought between 0.05-0.08

[23-Jun-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
and privacy optional systems degrade to transparent

[23-Jun-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
there are also now PIRATE copycats arriving, granted with less tech, but at least zero knowledge privacy only. PIRATE blazed the path to get zaddr deposit/withdraws, so now other coins can follow the leader in privacy tech

[23-Jun-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing against TA, but the FA for PIRATE seems quite powerful, and i hear a top 20 exchange will start trading PIRATE tomorrow

[23-Jun-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i was totally wrong when i said i didnt thing any central exchanges would ever support PIRATE. it does happen

estonian based

[23-Jun-19 12:55 PM] Keppie#5156
But stop shilling ARRR, I need to buy back üòÑ

[23-Jun-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the p2pb2b. not shilling, just explaining the FA

[23-Jun-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont think people realize the impact of a trustless BTC "mixer" using the largest anon set in crypto. PIRATE anon set now is 30x the ZEC anon set

[23-Jun-19 12:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I listened to jl when he said buy pirate

[23-Jun-19 12:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And grabbed the opportunity when it dipped to 600ish sats about a month ago

[23-Jun-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont often make recommendations on trades

[23-Jun-19 12:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I bought but not enough

[23-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Largest buy was in januari tho

[23-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
0.032 kmd I think was lowest I bought

[23-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd was at .70$ usd as well

[23-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
2019 has been good to me so far üòÉ

[23-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Keppie#5156
Been good to all of us

[23-Jun-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, i can recommend to buy KMD at current low prices

[23-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Keppie#5156
JL RECOMMENDS TO BUY KMD. Heard it here first!!

[23-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Keppie#5156
BUY BUY BUY

[23-Jun-19 01:01 PM] actionslacks#4072
shameless self promotion

[23-Jun-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be hard for it to surpass what PIRATE has done

[23-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Keppie#5156
Ya never know

[23-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd is more of a sure thing

[23-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Keppie#5156
Mcap tho

[23-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Arrr more volatile

[23-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Bit of both seems reasonable

[23-Jun-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
my feeling is that the two will trade independently of each other. privacy coins will likely do better than most any other category over the next three years

[23-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Alexfrog#1338
you guys all need to shut up about pirate until it gets back below the .1 KMD I sold it at üò¶

[23-Jun-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
but KMD from current levels... just getting back to ATH is quite a lot of multiplying. I have no specific events or reasons, just an FA based recommendation, combined with the guess that BTC dominance is near its peak at 59%

[23-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I stand by my prediction of 60k sat kmd in 2 weeks

[23-Jun-19 01:05 PM] actionslacks#4072
pirate will open doors for kmd it looks like

[23-Jun-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
@Alexfrog the only way PIRATE will get back to 0.1 is if KMD outgains PIRATE by 2x

[23-Jun-19 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
which is very possible and why PIRATE is so volatile. definitely not anything people that panic over a single down day on CMC

[23-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i thought KMD would rally harder than it.  i had no idea KMD would tank to new lows instead, so sad

[23-Jun-19 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
should even think about getting

[23-Jun-19 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
remember there are wall street AI algos running rampant on almost all top CMC coins

[23-Jun-19 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
they have literally decades of practice convincing the average trader one thing

[23-Jun-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and make the markets do the opposite

[23-Jun-19 01:07 PM] Alexfrog#1338
you all seemed like you were FOMOing on ARRR halving at .1 to .15 KMD, lol.   and it has kept going up while KMD dropped somehow

[23-Jun-19 01:08 PM] Keppie#5156
Imagine KMD in a crypto index fund on wallstreet

[23-Jun-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the PIRATE dropped down after halving

[23-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Alexfrog#1338
only on low volume while DP was disabled during the hack

[23-Jun-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
there is always VRSC to buy before it gets onto CMC

[23-Jun-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
currently trading at close to mining costs, but i see a lot of good things coming from verus

@Cryptoon not sure why u think 60k is possible but if ur right well ill give u a nice tip

[23-Jun-19 01:15 PM] Alexfrog#1338
no way we get to 60k short term

[23-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i hope we get back there some day though

[23-Jun-19 01:17 PM] Alexfrog#1338
wait, i'm sure if i sold we would hit 60k right away üòÑ    but I wont, so it wont happen.

[23-Jun-19 01:17 PM] Markus#5464
thats roughly 330% gain needed....if we manage to do that in 2 weeks then thats pretty insane

[23-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Alexfrog#1338
any uptrend we get going is immediately killed by either BTC moving or a hack üò¶

[23-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
