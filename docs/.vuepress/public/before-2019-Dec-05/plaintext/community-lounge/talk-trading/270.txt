Do I'm alone to think that the KMD price is going down due to PIRATE project?

[12-Nov-18 06:49 AM] OsTa#2589
look like people are mining pirate, sold pirate against KMD and dump KMD on binance against BTC....

[12-Nov-18 06:50 AM] OsTa#2589
wdyt? the more I'm looking the more it's looks true

[12-Nov-18 06:53 AM] OsTa#2589
*Miners are killing the price* by selling all those PIRATE through ARR/KMD/BTC on exchanges. Don't forget they mostly don't care about your project and they are here for the money.

[12-Nov-18 06:54 AM] OsTa#2589
I tried to get answer on the PIRATE telegram, but they say I'm doing FUD and no more than this. But looks...!

Don’t have time to discuss that - I trust the KMD Ecosystem 🏴‍☠️

[12-Nov-18 07:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
If thats the case then pirate is gaining hashrate. and there are buyers for all those dumpers using kmd. any volume is good. Even if the price is going down a little, the usage is whats important imo. Perhaps the whale was simply someone looking to accumulate to manipulate price down as much as possible? who knows and or cares. There's scores of other coins that wont be around in the near future. kmd is not one of them

[12-Nov-18 07:45 AM] OsTa#2589
@actionslacks  thanks for this elaborated answer I have appreciated ! Better than just "it's FUD!" or "SELL if you don't like" words by @Acura

there are good pirates here ARRR !

[12-Nov-18 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Price is irrelavent... around $1 is enough for notary network to remain in a good working condition. Obviously higher is better, but $1 is pretty good generally for majority of the miners of KMD.

[12-Nov-18 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We need to focus on making notaries more expensive... notarise more chains...

[12-Nov-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this will drive up the price ... price will follow usage.

20k KMD worth of PIRATE sold, even if 100% of that was dumped on binance, against 50BTC volumes it doesnt seem it would affect the price so much

[12-Nov-18 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
a more realistic analysis would be that we are in the down cycle of the medium term price oscillation

[12-Nov-18 08:38 AM] OsTa#2589

And the people selling the big amounts are very early pirate adopters and these are more likely holding part of the kmd they are selling arrr for

@OsTa The KMD volumes on the arrr exchange are less than .5% of average daily KMD volume.  
In addition, people are buying KMD to buy arrr as its trading 9:1 instead of BTC.   


If anything... ARRR is bringing positive light to KMD.  The last few interviews I’ve done have been great opportunities to talk about KMD, dPoW and what it’s like to have an asset chain in the ecosystem.  I also talk to people daily who are big influencers about KMD specifically.    
In addition... after 6 months... KMD has 3000 discord members when pirate started.    They have over 5000 in the 6 weeks we have been here and marketing for people to join the discord.   

I’m not saying 2,000 are pirates but you have to assume a good Chunk are.  👍🏴☠️

Digital price has agreed with me to list all future coin listings with KMD pairs.   Effectively making it the first exchange that has KMD as a base trading pair.     They are new and volume is low but they just added ERC20 support and are a solid UX.

That’s sort of an under the table agreement the dev and I have there but it’s effective and active. 
This link is for pirate referral.  The fees earned go towards project development since we didn’t ICO and have no dev fund. 
Use it to buy VRSC / Arbitrage KMD and of course to buy ARRR.

I stand by my view that KMD ecosystem projects strengthen the system.    Take a look at these interviews posted in #deleted-channel and the positive light I’ve put on their questions wondering if we will ever “decouple” from KMD.

Anyone who still naively thinks there will be two chains left standing at the end of the #HashWar needs to read today's statement from @CalvinAyre. He makes it abundantly clear what happens if SV has majority hashpower on the Bitcoin Cash network.
