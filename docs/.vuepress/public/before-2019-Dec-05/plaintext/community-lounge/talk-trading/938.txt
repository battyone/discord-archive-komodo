But creating a dpow’ed blockchain isn’t important. Logo is. Forgot

[16-Jul-19 07:41 PM] Caglio#3337

[16-Jul-19 07:41 PM] Caglio#3337

[16-Jul-19 07:41 PM] Caglio#3337
just to prove world

[16-Jul-19 07:41 PM] Caglio#3337

Cagcoin

[16-Jul-19 07:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
@Caglio I love the toe/finger amputee guy pooping.  You really capture the struggle of the human condition in his weathered grimace.  You can tell its not the first (or last) time he had to take a weird, crab-posture, naked shit in a hole.

[16-Jul-19 07:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
you are not afraid to take risks with your artwork.  I admire that.

I guess I am just sort of confused as to why there isnt some element of a big friggin' lizard in the logo.  Why not a lizard curled into a semicircle with a chain tail?  Shit, you get the "Komodo" in there as well as chain symbolism.

[16-Jul-19 07:45 PM] meatspoon#7860
make that chain tail kinda blocky, and well, you got blockchain too

[16-Jul-19 07:45 PM] dan.#2473
might be hard to fit that level of detail in a logo

[16-Jul-19 07:46 PM] dan.#2473
modern logos are usually flat and simple to look good at any scale/res

[16-Jul-19 07:46 PM] Caglio#3337
ideas by nature could at least steal targaryen symbol and use ir

[16-Jul-19 07:46 PM] meatspoon#7860
but Logo guy should definitely be held underneath finger-amputee man after a Taco Bell binge eating session

It's been 5 minutes, where's Cagcoin coin and logo?

[16-Jul-19 07:47 PM] Caglio#3337
Im waiting someone to make cag coin

[16-Jul-19 07:48 PM] Caglio#3337
I cannot even open web page from my windows xp

[16-Jul-19 07:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I guess I am just sort of confused as to why there isnt some element of a big friggin' lizard in the logo.`
Because that would be like sticking to something identifiable

[16-Jul-19 07:48 PM] dan.#2473
tbh, everyone who is upset go check out the logo packs on the site. the worst rendition of this logo is the *discord* version - the background color for discord doesnt bode well with those colors. and thats out of the teams hands

[16-Jul-19 07:48 PM] Caglio#3337
ur saying how easy its to make coin, im saying how easy is to make logo ( :

[16-Jul-19 07:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dan. the site isn't any better
my avatar literally comes from my wife saying "That looks like a sperm and egg" when I showed her the site

[16-Jul-19 07:52 PM] dan.#2473
ok that is hot

[16-Jul-19 07:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
but yeah, there should definitely be more sperm added to it

the typeface for the current komodo text looks decent with the logo imo

[16-Jul-19 07:54 PM] dan.#2473
i think there is some truth to a lot of what people are saying about it (myself included) but the past is a hard thing to move on from

i love me some 16-bit games, but i cant get teenagers to plug in their snes mini

[16-Jul-19 07:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, the neo-starwars font matches the sperm logo better than the old font would

[16-Jul-19 07:55 PM] dan.#2473

`i love me some 16-bit games, but i cant get teenagers to plug in their snes mini`
It's much easier to buy a snes mini than get this feken tattoo removed

[16-Jul-19 07:56 PM] dan.#2473
cross it out and draw a sperm egg

[16-Jul-19 07:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that would be easy if my ancestors were from somewhere like Ireland or Norway 🤷🏽

[16-Jul-19 07:58 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

[16-Jul-19 08:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`its really just a sperm egg lifestyle from this point forward`
are you saying it's: "fek 'em while you can"?

[16-Jul-19 08:27 PM] meatspoon#7860
saying the logo doesnt mean much is like saying the ugly girl has really nice qualities...

[16-Jul-19 08:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
but the differences are that ugly girls cant help being ugly.  logos can help it

[16-Jul-19 08:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But some like it

[16-Jul-19 08:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what else matters?`
the new terminology changes that loyalists will take years to adopt....

[16-Jul-19 08:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
its like literally the first thing anyone will look at.  and we have a gooey anus

[16-Jul-19 08:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So you think they may be ugly but others fine them attractive 😄

[16-Jul-19 08:29 PM] meatspoon#7860
if the new logo were a girl, she would have excessive chromosomes

[16-Jul-19 08:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
LOL

[16-Jul-19 08:29 PM] meatspoon#7860
maybe her personality is dynamite

[16-Jul-19 08:29 PM] meatspoon#7860
but her face looks like a smashed crab

[16-Jul-19 08:30 PM] meatspoon#7860
I knew a girl like that in university.  man she had some skills, but really hard to look at

The 6 months of work switching logos getting things either edited (unlikely) or newly written to reflect all the changes in imagery and naming.  Getting materials to present made in the new format.   Is what matters.

[16-Jul-19 08:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
True @polycryptoblog because fek what people that have been loyal all along think, right?
The new people matter
