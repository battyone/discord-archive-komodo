pump in 2017: you made 10x.   pump in 2019:  you are now only down 50% on your shitcoin instead of 75%

nSPV nice

[13-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Neko#5830
this will make some news

[13-Nov-19 01:43 PM] jeezy#3408
@Acura  sure,  my point was more like shouldnt there be an official announcement / info page clearly visible and easy to find somewhere  for this important update?   just to clarify... it will be a hardfork?

[13-Nov-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it is in the process

[13-Nov-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a hardupdate

[13-Nov-19 01:44 PM] jeezy#3408
whats the definition of hardupdate

[13-Nov-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
a mandatory update

[13-Nov-19 01:45 PM] jeezy#3408
so there will be no hardfork?

[13-Nov-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont update, you will go on a fork, that is why exchanges are stopped. if we dont do that, then it becomes very likely some would skip the update and go on a fork

[13-Nov-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
what do you mean by hardfork?

[13-Nov-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it is an update, that is a hardforking update, so it is a hardfork, but not one with new coins

[13-Nov-19 01:47 PM] jeezy#3408
makes sense

[13-Nov-19 01:48 PM] jeezy#3408
so to get back on topic,   this is planned for end of this months

[13-Nov-19 01:48 PM] jeezy#3408
so some of those big exchanges will have dep/withdr  deactivated for 2 more weeks

[13-Nov-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
as soon as they update, they can reopen

[13-Nov-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont have an exact time the update is ready yet, team is working on it to get it done soonest

[13-Nov-19 02:05 PM] joe2x4#5987
Perfect time for a pump, when it's hard to dump.

[13-Nov-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
there is 10 million+ KMD on binance. no lack of KMD to sell

[13-Nov-19 02:12 PM] jorian#4555
i'm sure some peeps would've deposited and sold with these prices

[13-Nov-19 02:14 PM] joe2x4#5987
Cold storage peeps left out? I guess we would see an uptick in atomicdex offers then.

[13-Nov-19 02:14 PM] designer#4893
what is Komodo's strategy in this bull market?

[13-Nov-19 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
same as during the bear market and last bull market

[13-Nov-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
continue to improve things

[13-Nov-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess this bull market, KMD becomes popular in asia

KMD pumping and exchanges stopping deposits/withdrawals does seem like too much of a coincidence. But maybe I'm just paranoid

[13-Nov-19 05:32 PM] Oszy#5734
`exchanges stopping deposits/withdrawals` because of a network upgrade

[13-Nov-19 05:34 PM] Mark81#4505
Well it was same thing going on last years hard fork update if i am memorizing correctly.

Yes same and after a day or so a huge dump...

[13-Nov-19 05:35 PM] Oszy#5734
there is 10 million KMD on binance if someone wants to dump would have done it by now üôÇ

[13-Nov-19 05:37 PM] Mark81#4505
Well this time we have come out from bottom pattern so it might be different story. Also other alts are having good gains.

[13-Nov-19 05:37 PM] Oszy#5734
BTC hasn't moved the past couple days

[13-Nov-19 05:37 PM] Oszy#5734
not crashing the parties

[13-Nov-19 05:46 PM] jeffjam#9765
Of course it is manipulation due to closed deposits/withdrawals across the board.

[13-Nov-19 05:51 PM] richardt#2807
Most of that 10mil KMD could be owned by Binance

[13-Nov-19 05:51 PM] richardt#2807
Or other whales.

[13-Nov-19 05:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Altbits withdraw/depo open

[13-Nov-19 05:52 PM] Oszy#5734
either way it goes I read manipulation here üòÑ

[13-Nov-19 05:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Feel free to dump there üôÇ

[13-Nov-19 05:53 PM] Oszy#5734
there's atomicdex too, I don't see  bigger orders on either of them just complaints here :p

[13-Nov-19 05:53 PM] Markus#5464
in the end we are back to more healthier numbers so we should just be happy about it, any market where money can be made being manipulated one or another way so its nothing new
