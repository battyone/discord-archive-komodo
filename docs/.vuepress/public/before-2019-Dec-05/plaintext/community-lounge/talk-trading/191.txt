Well, especially in this crowd, when you ask a vague question you're likely to get a vague answer

[08-Oct-18 09:34 PM] actionslacks#4072
@ryman112 I dont read tea leaves or believe in TA. But whenever conventional markets get shaky btc tends to go up. I’m buying more just to buy more pirate atm.

[08-Oct-18 09:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Buy KMD for buying pirate, I don't take BTC :trollface:

[08-Oct-18 09:52 PM] ryman112#0068
To be specific it seems btc was stuck in a wedge and seems like it will break up or down.  Looks like its leaning on the upside.  Im not a TA guy hence the question.  Just intrested in what the analysis is from the TA guys in here.  I've seen some before in here.

[08-Oct-18 09:52 PM] jl777c#5810
@siu - Chainmakers knows the tea leaves

[08-Oct-18 09:53 PM] ryman112#0068
Thanks @jl777c

[08-Oct-18 09:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah, btc is in a decisive moment

[08-Oct-18 09:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If it break up from here. There will be continuation

[08-Oct-18 09:53 PM] ryman112#0068
Exactly what I was thinking siu

[08-Oct-18 09:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But it needs to show volume on that break

[08-Oct-18 09:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If not, then we go to panic finap capitulation to the lower $5k, maybe even a bit below

[08-Oct-18 09:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
History has always left people expecting a btc lower low

[08-Oct-18 09:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So im not sure at how this will turn out this time

[08-Oct-18 09:56 PM] meatspoon#7860
its gotta get over 6800 with convincing volume

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  where do you get kmd for usd in the states?

[08-Oct-18 09:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
From my Z9minis, they print it like the US Treasury prints $1 bills :trollface:

[08-Oct-18 09:58 PM] actionslacks#4072
Oh cool, so your electric company accepts kmd now?

[08-Oct-18 09:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I bet if I told them that I'd move to a new county if they didn't they might consider it 😛

mayer multiple, long term trendlines since 2014, misery index point that we are at a low point.

[08-Oct-18 10:06 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
past price action indicated that we can still go lower though to last resistance, which is around 5k

[08-Oct-18 10:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_read @bpkdasbaum's article on why BTC should never go below $6x00 and doesn't trust @bpkdasbaum's math after that_

[08-Oct-18 10:10 PM] ryman112#0068
Thanks for the insight!

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  *inhales deeply and breaths out* ... oh boi, you still on that? That was like a week ago, in my humble opinion you really need to learn to let things go, just let the apathy into your heart. The article isn't mine. I brought it up in a discussion as a possibility/insight. There is no one trick indicator or sure thing in the market, there are just different data points that you can base your decisions on. I never did the math in that article.  How da frack did you even come to that conclusion? I had you on ignore for a while because you were talking down, borderline harassing (not just me, but multiple others in here), feels really icky to talk to you. You come off like you need to be right and you are the one and only truth. It's fine to correct information, I simply would welcome if you weren't showing an attitude of patronizing superiority at the same time. I am pretty sure some people are here to learn, get some help, get some insight, see what the KMD community is like. you are an active poster/chatter here, and you are the one they see when they come in as new players interested in KMD here. I personally get the creeps from you, especially now that I know you are stalking me for over a week and trying to get on up on me. jesus. I am inclined to feel others feel similar about it . I don't understand why or how other people accept that. It's one thing to have criticism or get in some healthy dose of doubt, you don't have to be passive aggressive or condescending about it.

Not trying to dogpile anyone, but I am with @bpkdasbaum .  I like the Komodo project but this Discord channel seems like a fairly toxic echo chamber.  Genie/Haiduc likes to tell everyone else their opinions are shit, their investment strategies are shit and their preferred alt coins are shit.  All the while he is a braggart, posting wallet balances, talking himself up.  Its a bad look for the community.  And the mods are too chickenshit to tell him to cool his jets.  Newcomers are likely entering every day to see genie on any given channel telling people how stupid they are while mods and devs shrug and allow their community culture to continue to be tainted by an immature blow-hard.

[09-Oct-18 12:37 AM] allbits#5898
Agreed. I like it when he blows himself up and voluntarily leaves for a while.

[09-Oct-18 12:37 AM] allbits#5898

it's fine to mention strong opinions and still stay respectful.

@meatspoon When exactly is it that you think I posted my wallet balance?

[09-Oct-18 12:52 AM] meatspoon#7860
it was a few weeks ago.  you posted a wallet balance screenshot

[09-Oct-18 12:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@bpkdasbaum Respect must be earned as giving respect for the simple purpose that you exist devoids all meaning of the word

very mature, genie

[09-Oct-18 12:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@meatspoon If I've **ever** posted ss that included a balance, outside of #dev-tradebots, it was accidental

Plenty of other people around always willing to help, and if you ask the genie nicely he will help where he can with anything mining related.

[09-Oct-18 07:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
All in all the kmd community is probably one of the nicest and most helpful ones, where you are always one step away from talking directly to devs or other helpful people.

peoples, genie is a special sort of fellow. if you post something that isnt technically accurate, he will call you on it. granted he is a bit sandpapery but he doesnt swear at people, and generally acts in a factual way. think of him as the community doberman who will go after any non-factual posts. not saying all his opinions are correct, but more of them are correct than incorrect, which in this space makes him an expert
