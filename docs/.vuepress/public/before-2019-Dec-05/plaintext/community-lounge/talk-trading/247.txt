>but wouldnt fomo push the rsi even higher?
Yes, but its in the overbought area already, if it just FOMO now and then take a rest to bounce off the 50 area it would be good.

[24-Oct-18 04:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We need a twitter storm about this... he says dPOW is not relevant to the story but somehow Horizen really is???
