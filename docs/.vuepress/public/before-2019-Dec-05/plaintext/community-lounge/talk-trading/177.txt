I heard about a python machine learning script someone was using back in the day on bitcoin talk. Associating keywords with price action. cool stuff man.

yes it's possible that if someone just tracks keywords on twitter will make more money then those guys doing tech analysis

[28-Sep-18 12:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's not even about capitalism, when the cost of goods sold increases, the price increases; that's basic econ 101

[28-Sep-18 12:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[28-Sep-18 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[28-Sep-18 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to be fair its in  T right now anyway...

[28-Sep-18 12:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you said you wouldnt hold that much in t

[28-Sep-18 12:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Where do you hold your kmd then, because you do not accrue rewards in z address I think?

[28-Sep-18 12:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
(Or so I remember, could be wrong)

[28-Sep-18 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, I don't have that much KMD and if I did I'd be on a beach, somewhere, spending it and not talking to you 😝

[28-Sep-18 12:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
