maybe that is their version of DPoW.  Delayed Pedos of Work.

[19-May-19 03:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
Usar la cadena de Frejoles y horas despues, ya te pasaran los Pedos.

Brimstone wind

[19-May-19 03:49 PM] meatspoon#7860
little burning embers in it

[19-May-19 03:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Jalape√±o poppers do that

[19-May-19 03:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ask me how I know

[19-May-19 03:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
How do you know?  Meticulous research of various sources including Google searches on what foods to avoid if you have a flammable anus?

[19-May-19 03:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I ate homemade jalape√±o poppers and generated copious amounts of fire-driven thrust the next day

[19-May-19 03:55 PM] meatspoon#7860
I usually choose to get a Manzillian at the local waxing spa prior to eating Jalapeno Poppers so that there is less kindling in the area when the brimstone wind comes

[19-May-19 03:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Manzillian?

Welp, time to write Luddite manifestos in a shack in Montana

[19-May-19 03:59 PM] meatspoon#7860
A unibomber reference, i suppose.  That dude was an MK Ultra participant.  Not something the media included in the coverage.

Not that I know of. But the unibomber being a participant in a government mind control experiment which made use of hallucinogenics and psychological torture (as well as kidnapping and poisoning) is noteworthy in my opinion.  Declassified documents on the program and Kazinski‚Äôs participation in it didn‚Äôt seem to interest the mainstream media much though. Still doesn‚Äôt.

If you ever wanted to study the dynamics of a short squeeze recent action in the crypto markets is a good classroom.
