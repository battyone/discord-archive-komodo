[16-Jul-19 12:39 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@FlyingDutchman you mean for running verus in native mode?

üòÇ

[16-Jul-19 12:41 AM] yorklab#7270
@Alecandro I think they are just frustrated. KMD is getting killed and the launch took a while so frustration is setting in.

[16-Jul-19 12:41 AM] Alecandro#1179
KMD is getting killed?

[16-Jul-19 12:41 AM] Alecandro#1179
What are you talking about?

[16-Jul-19 12:41 AM] yorklab#7270
I mean the last week or so.

[16-Jul-19 12:41 AM] Alecandro#1179
So is everything else dude

[16-Jul-19 12:42 AM] Alecandro#1179
It‚Äôs not just a KMD thing

[16-Jul-19 12:42 AM] Alecandro#1179
All alts are getting murdered

[16-Jul-19 12:42 AM] Alecandro#1179
Do you look at anything else?

[16-Jul-19 12:42 AM] yorklab#7270
I know, I know, that's not my point. They see their investment going down so the mood is low.

[16-Jul-19 12:43 AM] yorklab#7270
Yes, I know about the Alts. lol

[16-Jul-19 12:43 AM] COCO#8088
They just have to use twitter to pump it üòÉ

[16-Jul-19 12:43 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Twitter logo changed

[16-Jul-19 12:43 AM] Alecandro#1179
On cue there‚Äôs twitter

[16-Jul-19 12:44 AM] yorklab#7270
If KMD has a big uptick everyone's mood will change. Its a cure-all for everything.

Everything You Need to Know About Power Buttons
A power button is the button used to power an electronic device on or off. A hard power visually indicates when something is one or off, a soft power button does not.
