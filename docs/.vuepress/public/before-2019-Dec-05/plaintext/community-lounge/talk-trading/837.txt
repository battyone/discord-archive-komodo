Everything my friend like most people in this space.  It does give me comfort that you sir answered my questions fast and punctually

[25-Jun-19 07:08 AM] designer#4893
to those who want speed and scalability on Bitcoin,

Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin to survive in a hostile environment to deal with such powerful countries as the U.S. government and the Chinese government.

the desire for performance is that you don't understand the situation.

[25-Jun-19 07:08 AM] ryman112#0068
If I wore hats I would tip my cap to you.  I cant thank you enough for being responsive and direct.  Much respect

[25-Jun-19 07:11 AM] ryman112#0068
I just figured if I had any questions or doubts I would have them solved here.

Hey there 😃 where's the best place to trade some kmd with pirate?

[25-Jun-19 07:16 AM] ryman112#0068
@jl777c thank you for my piece of mind

[25-Jun-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
glad it is sorted

[25-Jun-19 07:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jl777c BTC at 59.9% but since there were random projects with hundreds of millions added, you think that BTC will need to get 65 or 70 to  top out?

[25-Jun-19 07:26 AM] Keppie#5156
@zennie digitalprice.io has the most volume

[25-Jun-19 07:27 AM] zennie#2968
Thanks!

[25-Jun-19 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
@hyperDEX markets tend to go a lot longer than you think it can, it will keep going until it reverses. we will know it when we see it

[25-Jun-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
the thing about dominance vs. price seems to need also the time BTC corrects, allowing the waterskiers to get back on their skis and not just being dragged underwater

[25-Jun-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
right now there are a lot of waterskiiers all fall down

[25-Jun-19 07:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I was watching a show showing liquidity instead of market cap and BTC seems to still be 80%+ of the overall crypto liquidity

[25-Jun-19 07:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No idea if it showed real liquidity vs wash trading etc

[25-Jun-19 07:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
What will be the btc dominance top? I gambling on 64,2%

[25-Jun-19 07:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Vamooooo

[25-Jun-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
dominance peak is indeed the big question.

[25-Jun-19 08:12 AM] Mische#6695
77,7% anyone ?

[25-Jun-19 08:13 AM] Alexfrog#1338
100.0% obv

[25-Jun-19 08:13 AM] Alexfrog#1338
and fees should be $1000 to send it

[25-Jun-19 08:13 AM] Alexfrog#1338
then they will have succeeded in killing crypto

[25-Jun-19 08:13 AM] Mische#6695
130% in Russia

[25-Jun-19 08:16 AM] Keppie#5156
Imagine reversal of the altcoin market perfectly timed with Antara & rebranding + marketing. In for a wild ride !

[25-Jun-19 08:22 AM] Malti#3948
That’s what my dreams are about @Keppie

[25-Jun-19 08:23 AM] Malti#3948
Although, from what I heard, the evolve/antara campaign is focused on getting the word out to devs. So it’s feasible we will see a ‘delay’ in our personal gains from kmd pumping till more even more projects are added into the KMD ecosystem.

[25-Jun-19 08:24 AM] Malti#3948
It’s all about long term growth 🔥

[25-Jun-19 08:37 AM] Lumbi#8378
Alt "slingshot" effect will be massive

[25-Jun-19 08:38 AM] Lumbi#8378

[25-Jun-19 09:07 AM] rainbro7#4735
Gonna buy some new coins for the supernet nav JL777? Been a while since non komodo partnership coins were added. What about ERGO? Mainnet on the 28th. Might be good to watch. Former nxt team people with Cardano and wave experience.

[25-Jun-19 09:12 AM] Alexfrog#1338
he's been converting the other coins into kmd

[25-Jun-19 09:19 AM] coingirl87#6489
Mmhhh...why converting all coins into kmd? He think komodo will rise more than other coins? Why he thinking that?

[25-Jun-19 09:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
if anyone has the best insight into what kmd will do it might be jl :p

[25-Jun-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
i am open about my positive feelings about KMD. just dont accuse me of insider trading as i have been buying KMD pretty consistently

[25-Jun-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
my investment horizon is pretty long term

[25-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Bittersweet#9376
alts seem extremely squished right now, i wonder where btc dominance will go

Can't get much higher

[25-Jun-19 09:45 AM] Sherdogz#6731
It can

[25-Jun-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it could get to 100% if the maximalists are right

Did you make this lumbi hahaha

[25-Jun-19 09:51 AM] Sherdogz#6731
maybe but i can't imagine good projects going to zero. Unless they get abandoned... Keep checking those git commits😄

[25-Jun-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
since in fiat terms, things are actually not any disaster, most projects are fine, so yes 100% is not going to happen

[25-Jun-19 10:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I had a dream yesterday that KMD was at $100

cryptocurrencycheckout.com has Twitch Button and ARRR is supported soon

[25-Jun-19 11:46 AM] Tek#5253

https://www.crypto51.app/

[25-Jun-19 11:46 AM] Tek#5253
115% to be correct

[25-Jun-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
site is incorrect

[25-Jun-19 11:47 AM] Tek#5253
?

[25-Jun-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
pirate is resistant to 51%, that website is incorrect

[25-Jun-19 11:51 AM] Tek#5253
so is dash, its on there too 😉

[25-Jun-19 11:54 AM] Malti#3948
how is dash 51% resistant? do they use dPoW?

[25-Jun-19 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
...but you're welcomed to try a 2 day attack on ARRR at $1,781 per hr 🤣

[25-Jun-19 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the math of that site (or lack thereof) is hilarious

[25-Jun-19 11:57 AM] Malti#3948
@Cryptoon and @siu - Chainmakers promised us 5$ ARRR

[25-Jun-19 11:58 AM] Malti#3948
:PeepoThink: :treasure:

[25-Jun-19 11:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
did they promise that it'd happen *today*?

[25-Jun-19 11:58 AM] Malti#3948
no the 7th

[25-Jun-19 11:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the 7th what of what year?

[25-Jun-19 11:58 AM] Malti#3948
undisclosed

[25-Jun-19 11:58 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
for dPOW coins they should be described better - that attack cost for more then 10 min attack is BTC attack cost + native attack cost

[25-Jun-19 11:58 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so basically they should be next to btc

[25-Jun-19 11:59 AM] Malti#3948
I just like to dream @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[25-Jun-19 11:59 AM] Malti#3948
arrr has been great to me with an average buying price of 0.05$

[25-Jun-19 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a 10 minute "attack" on BTC just makes you a 1 block solo miner

[25-Jun-19 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`arrr has been great to me with an average buying price of 0.05$`
I was an idiot and mined it when the mining cost was multiples higher than that 😭

[25-Jun-19 12:01 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
what I mean is to precisly display 51% cost you need to split <10 min cost and >=10 min cost

[25-Jun-19 12:01 PM] Malti#3948
0.057$ to be correct

[25-Jun-19 12:01 PM] Malti#3948
did you sell them?

[25-Jun-19 12:01 PM] Malti#3948
of you hodl'ed than you can almost start selling that stack to mining price no?

[25-Jun-19 12:01 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and I was the idiot to buy some expensive coins from CG :abusedsmily:

didnt sell them yet

[25-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Malti#3948
did you average down ?

[25-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Malti#3948
I like the 'simplicity' of ARRR

[25-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Malti#3948
it's a privacy coin

[25-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Malti#3948
people understand it

[25-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Malti#3948
so they buy it

[25-Jun-19 12:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, there's many factors to an attack cost, but none of them are thinking you can rent all the hash on NH for a "middle of the road" price that's lower than folks are already renting at

[25-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Tek#5253
@Malti dash rolled out anti 51% tech

[25-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Tek#5253
its called chain locks

[25-Jun-19 12:02 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
name it full utility, not simplicity

[25-Jun-19 12:03 PM] Malti#3948
wdym @passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋

[25-Jun-19 12:03 PM] Tek#5253
well its not yet active, the DIP self activates in about ~1.5 week

[25-Jun-19 12:03 PM] Tek#5253
