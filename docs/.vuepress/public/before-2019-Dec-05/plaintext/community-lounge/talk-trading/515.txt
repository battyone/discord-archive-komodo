`You're assuming everyone was honest back in the day`
@richardt I'm not assuming anything, you're the one making the assertions and I'm asking for you to back those assertions without hyperbole

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  By stating that you don't recall seeing an article on counterfeit cowry, thereby implying it never happened nor was a problem.  That's making assumptions.  And quite a big one at that.

It's not that far-fetched to say that a major problem (yes, in human history) was solved by eliminating the need to trust someone or wonder if the person you're transacting with is completely honest.  Maybe if everyone was honest, then yeah the problem is not that significant.   Too many lying/cheating bastards out there and yes, they existed 5500 years ago too.

If there's an issue with inactivity somewhere, just comment something that's not negative about BTC and have ComputerGenie to join in on the conversation.  That should solve it.   😄

`By stating that you don't recall seeing an article on counterfeit cowry, thereby implying it never happened nor was a problem. That's making assumptions. `
No, that's literally me saying that I'm not aware of the evidence you claim exists and asking for you to provide it.

[04-Apr-19 03:12 AM] richardt#2807
I didn't see that as a question, more of a statement.  Are you back-peddling now?  😄

[04-Apr-19 03:14 AM] richardt#2807
Jokes aside.  Just want to make sure we're on the same page.  The problem we're talking about is trust in regards to the transfer of value, correct?

[04-Apr-19 03:15 AM] richardt#2807
Can you provide evidence that trust was never an issue in history?  You're the one saying it's not a major problem

[04-Apr-19 03:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

`Can you provide evidence that trust was never an issue in history?`
That's not how supporting a claim works, you don't get to make an unsupported claim and then force me to disprove a negative; you make the claim, you must support the claim.

[04-Apr-19 03:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Or, you could just stop using hyperbole and make an actual supportable claim....

[04-Apr-19 03:18 AM] richardt#2807
Pretty sure you're the one making the claim first that BTC sucks because it only solved one problem (an insignificant one)

[04-Apr-19 03:18 AM] p.#1126
LOL  AF TBH ^

[04-Apr-19 03:19 AM] richardt#2807

[04-Apr-19 03:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Pretty sure you're the one making the claim... it only solved one problem`
That's not my claim, that's the claim of Bitcoin.
`an insignificant one`
In the context that you keep framing it in, 5500 years of written human history, double spending of electronic cash is factually insignificant. Stop using hyperbole and your claim will be much closer to valid.

[04-Apr-19 03:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I'm just here to disagree and get you fired up`
Then you're failing because in the grand scheme of things idgaf

[04-Apr-19 03:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@polycryptoblog Your '2)' is a false claim becaise LN isn't part of BTC

[04-Apr-19 03:23 AM] richardt#2807
Everything is false if ComputerGenie doesn't agree with it

@richardt My agreement is with what he said, just not that it's in relation to BTC (because it's a separate app and BTC functions with or without it)

Komodo DPoW, which is a centralized solution, qualitatively very similar to PoP.

Not true. Every full node on the network verifies notarizations and validates the blocks. If a block is found to be contradicting the history known to that node, that notarizatio...

Just one instance of the Komodo team requesting Poloniex to delist BTCD. If you dig deeper, you will find even more references.

This is "crypto economics & game theory" at play. They will defend their opinion even if it is wrong because they have a financial stake in that opinion being true 😂 

I understand I too have stake in my opinion 😅  but the point still stands

By the time it started pumping the chain didnt even work anymore and already 90%+ was in the kmd address held by jl?

[04-Apr-19 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
blaming us for polo keeping BTCD listed well after the chain died? seems par for the course for VBK

[04-Apr-19 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
exchanges just dont do things they are asked to do, but they will revamp their deposit handling code to use the VBK data since grepping the debug.log locally to notice a reorg is much easier?

[04-Apr-19 07:26 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah he comes across as not very educated on the matter

[04-Apr-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
from their roadmap:

[04-Apr-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
Q2, 2019    First Altchain Integration
Q2, 2019    Early Attack Detection Dashboards, Integrations

[04-Apr-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so it seems confirmed that VBK is attack detection and not prevention. so it only costs an altcoin a percentage of block rewards to detect they have been attacked after the fact.

[04-Apr-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
grepping debug.log will achieve the same effect

[04-Apr-19 07:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
It costs the minders 4000 sats to PoP mine, but the ieo was at 2400 sats... so its like they are expecting this shit to pump?

[04-Apr-19 07:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Miners were better off just buying the ieo then

someone commented on that twitter post :
*Instead of putting pop on bitcoin why didn't they just mirror btc hashes 3 blocks later with their own sub chain hashes? that would create no spam on bitcoin while providing a verifiable historical sequence.*
Can someone explain to me what is `mirror btc hashes 3 blocks later with their own sub chain hashes` ? may be I'm too dumb to understand...
either I'm too dumb or it is just nonsense ?
