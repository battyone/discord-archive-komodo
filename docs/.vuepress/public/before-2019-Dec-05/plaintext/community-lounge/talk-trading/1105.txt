```@FishyGuts has met them``` and has been very quiet immediately afterwards. Fishy also has a project with them ? Warchain?

[02-Sep-19 07:14 PM] LocoMB#8593
but the guy was so whacko over the top, he also looted the comapny credit card on all kind of stuff, incl. hookers

[02-Sep-19 07:14 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Warchain ???

[02-Sep-19 07:15 PM] LocoMB#8593
this Goldman Sachs story smells of such a PR booster

[02-Sep-19 07:16 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Ok but wouldn't they know that this will come out one day lmao

[02-Sep-19 07:16 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Can't be a bunch of total retards

[02-Sep-19 07:16 PM] LocoMB#8593
this is not how that kind of person operates- E. Holmes is another perfect example

[02-Sep-19 07:17 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Right right

[02-Sep-19 07:17 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Fucking hell

[02-Sep-19 07:18 PM] LocoMB#8593
this is a broad spectrum - pure narcissists are actually quite funny, like that danish guy I worked with..
a cpl times it was a bit spooky, but after 6 months suddenly I figured the guy out

[02-Sep-19 07:18 PM] LocoMB#8593
and it was also totally hilarious several times

[02-Sep-19 07:19 PM] LocoMB#8593
when his hooekrs called th comapny office for example

[02-Sep-19 07:19 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Lmao

[02-Sep-19 07:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yeah, narcissists are their own breed.  They dont think about consequences the way normal people do

[02-Sep-19 07:19 PM] joe2x4#5987

here is how I learned about it- when I had him figured out, it was easy to handle him

[02-Sep-19 07:20 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Hehe didn't pay the hookers lol

[02-Sep-19 07:20 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
They find his office

[02-Sep-19 07:20 PM] LocoMB#8593

his second wife (swedish) told me, that she called the authorities because he didnt pay child support- and she said:
'they just laughed and said they could not get hold of that slippery fish either'

[02-Sep-19 07:23 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Is it free to read

[02-Sep-19 07:23 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
?

[02-Sep-19 07:24 PM] LocoMB#8593

Interesting with Kmd so murdered lately, Price has barely budged as btc spiked.

[02-Sep-19 08:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586

lmk if he still has more after you are done buying @hyperDEX ðŸ˜„

[02-Sep-19 08:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
No chance of that ðŸ˜›

[02-Sep-19 08:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
haha

[02-Sep-19 08:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
will be interesting after sep 12th what happens with the price

[02-Sep-19 08:30 PM] tolken#2655
The 12th..... remember the 12... why we care about the 12th?

[02-Sep-19 08:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
binance shuts down for us clients

[02-Sep-19 08:35 PM] hyperDEX#6586
If i was in the marketing team that is a good time to promote alternatives to a CEX

[02-Sep-19 08:35 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But we really need to get the market maker done first

[02-Sep-19 08:36 PM] hyperDEX#6586
to fix the liquidity issue

[02-Sep-19 08:38 PM] tolken#2655
@hyperDEX  I wrote a version of that a year ago. Just need to adapt it to mm2.0. Will be interesting to see similarities with what youâ€™re making.

[02-Sep-19 08:40 PM] tolken#2655
Kinda mind blowing thereâ€™s no more obvious  info on the Binance website. Gunna be a rude awakening for a lot of traders. A guy I work with didnâ€™t even believe it was true because he claims there no email or notification to him.

[02-Sep-19 08:42 PM] tolken#2655
Iâ€™m bullish for second half of September. Kmd has taken an undeserved beating. Illogical price action.

[02-Sep-19 08:42 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
No such thing as illogical price action

[02-Sep-19 08:43 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
The hive mind decided this is the price

[02-Sep-19 08:43 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
ðŸ˜‚

[02-Sep-19 08:43 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Or some big market makers

[02-Sep-19 08:43 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
That have logical reasons

[02-Sep-19 08:43 PM] tolken#2655
ðŸ˜› hives are logical now? ðŸ˜›

[02-Sep-19 08:43 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Fair

[02-Sep-19 08:43 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Well actually most are

the beatings will continue until morale improves

[02-Sep-19 08:44 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
:)

[02-Sep-19 09:00 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Nice activity in this range

[02-Sep-19 09:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As binance doesnt require kyc for smallish amounts, cant those people just use proxy?

[02-Sep-19 10:03 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Pretty sure it works

[02-Sep-19 10:03 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
But what happens if you forget to put it on one time

[02-Sep-19 10:03 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
?

[02-Sep-19 10:04 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
They might lock funds but it's just a guess

[02-Sep-19 10:16 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Donâ€™t fuck up

[02-Sep-19 10:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
By nature, circumventing regulations is risky business

Why would you sell for half market value ?

[03-Sep-19 12:00 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Is this a joke I don't understand

[03-Sep-19 12:00 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Ramirez

[03-Sep-19 12:00 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Why

[03-Sep-19 12:00 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Is it a scam attempt

[03-Sep-19 12:00 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
:troll_thuglife:

[03-Sep-19 12:01 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Just HODL

[03-Sep-19 12:02 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Why trow it away

[03-Sep-19 12:02 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Maybe one day you LL be in vacations go cash out

[03-Sep-19 12:03 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Makes no sense because if someone send you btc or tether for it , those coins are equally untradable

[03-Sep-19 12:05 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Also there are VPN s you can trade with , I don't understand this scam

[03-Sep-19 12:05 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Cryptoon @hyperDEX don't get rekt

[03-Sep-19 12:06 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
There are black markets for everything

[03-Sep-19 12:06 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

Is ARRR still a thing?

Yes

If you have some you dont want, I can take them off your hands @jspook16

@hyperDEX we've been ironing out the notary node in addition to dedicating KMD earned from it to server costs

@hyperDEX if you have a question for me, you could message me or @ me like an adult ðŸ˜„

[03-Sep-19 01:33 AM] VoskCoin#1869
@hyperDEX you can analyze my youtube stats, we've never bought subs fans likes thumbs up etc -- to be honest you sound pretty foolish to even say that. You can compare my stats with any "top" crypto channels, my performance is in the top tier, its why VoskCoin continues to grow regardless of the market conditions

[03-Sep-19 01:34 AM] VoskCoin#1869
revshare is literally buying votes, its ridiculous.  We have been very vocal AGAINST revshare, if you want revshare might as well have a KMD bot that rains KMD on discord users & be done w/ it
