i guess the market maker makes a fiat peg price to help people that cant handle a bit of BTC based volatility

[12-May-19 05:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
He should reset that fiat peg to at least $2.50 then :troll_cool:

[12-May-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
why?

[12-May-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
if people sell to him at $1, he will pay $1

[12-May-19 05:50 PM] Alecandro#1179
Wonder how alts will act when binance opens back up

[12-May-19 05:50 PM] Alecandro#1179
What do you guys think?

[12-May-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
depends on if BTC $6000 or $8000

[12-May-19 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
when BTC is on rampage, best to not look at altcoin prices. dominance steadily from 50% to 60%, it is no wonder alt prices down across the board (in BTC) even if roughly the same in fiat prices

[12-May-19 06:01 PM] Alecandro#1179
True dat fam. Well from what I hear, a real alt season could be just around the corner 🤤

[12-May-19 06:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Last time BTC dominance supposedly peaked at 64%, so we'll see what this run brings

[12-May-19 06:24 PM] Alecandro#1179
Didn’t we hit like 62% this time?

[12-May-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
this time? no, where we are at is pretty much the high for this cycle

[12-May-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
until it reverses, altseason wont be

Tbh that token wasnt for profit sharing or anything, just promised lower trading fees, but large accounts already have lower fees so it's purely speculative I think

correlations can change, but at the moment BTC in consolidation is move conducive to KMD pomping

Its either Bitpanda or buy btc off coinbase pro, send it to binance(deposits not open yet) and pay another trading fee

[13-May-19 12:17 PM] Malti#3948
The fees for the purchase of Bitcoin are currently 1.49% and for the sale at 1.29%.
