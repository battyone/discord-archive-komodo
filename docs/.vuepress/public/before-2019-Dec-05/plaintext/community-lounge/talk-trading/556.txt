[17-Apr-19 01:25 PM] dokrates#8987
did he wrote in here any time? or is he shy?

[17-Apr-19 01:26 PM] Tek#5253
no one really knows who he is

[17-Apr-19 01:26 PM] CoinKing88#1540
He speaks through the orderbook, buywalls when happy, marketsells when sad

[17-Apr-19 01:26 PM] Tek#5253
but the buy orders on KMD started popping up after the "100k buttcoins tied to alphabay"

[17-Apr-19 01:26 PM] Tek#5253
started moving

[17-Apr-19 01:26 PM] Malti#3948
is he active on binance or trex?

[17-Apr-19 01:26 PM] Tek#5253
nance

[17-Apr-19 01:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Does anybody remember KMD all time low?

[17-Apr-19 01:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[17-Apr-19 01:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That was a rage quit when something went wrong shortly after launch

[17-Apr-19 01:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I forget what it was

[17-Apr-19 01:28 PM] Tek#5253
m glad KMD is moving again

[17-Apr-19 01:29 PM] Tek#5253
for a bit I was starting to get worried

[17-Apr-19 01:29 PM] Keppie#5156
JL sure got himself a nice deal if he bought 40btc worth last few days 😄

[17-Apr-19 01:29 PM] klein#5233
50btc

[17-Apr-19 01:29 PM] Keppie#5156
Great macro trade if this is the bounce

[17-Apr-19 01:30 PM] Tek#5253
think it will push on

[17-Apr-19 01:30 PM] Q.#9594
needs volume

[17-Apr-19 01:30 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Does Binance receive vote coins as well? CZ could be a NN by default if he wanted to.

[17-Apr-19 01:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Unless they know the binance addresses then I would assume so

[17-Apr-19 01:31 PM] Keppie#5156
Only coins hold in wallets i believe

[17-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Tek#5253
what yall think about Iexec RLC?

[17-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Never heard of it

[17-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Tek#5253
wtf

[17-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Keppie#5156
wallets you hold the private keys to i mean

[17-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
whalebro has enough of these discount prices

[17-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
30BTC buywall at 22k

[17-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Tek#5253
tijd voor maan : D

[17-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Keppie#5156
oh NL 😄

[17-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You think binance doesn’t hold the priv keys to the addresses they use?

[17-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not sure how that works

[17-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Keppie#5156
Binance does, user doesnt

[17-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Of course

[17-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What if

[17-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Binance created a dex

[17-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
just so they regain control of their private keys

[17-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
!!!!!!!

[17-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Keppie#5156
🤔

[17-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Keppie#5156
btw, what's the progress on the website rebrand? Had no time to check the other channels lately

[17-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it's moving along

[17-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but it has a lot of moving parts

[17-Apr-19 01:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Tek latest agama latest release has a voting tool

[17-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[17-Apr-19 01:35 PM] CoinKing88#1540

[17-Apr-19 01:35 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Whalebro has betrayed ys

[17-Apr-19 01:36 PM] dokrates#8987
the buys are endless

[17-Apr-19 01:36 PM] Keppie#5156
huobi 24k

[17-Apr-19 01:37 PM] Keppie#5156
but yea, we need volume

[17-Apr-19 01:37 PM] CoinKing88#1540
This happened to Nano to a few days ago, next day Binance announced a usdt pair

[17-Apr-19 01:37 PM] p.#1126
that would be noooiiice

[17-Apr-19 01:37 PM] Tek#5253
kmd and nano i both picked up this bear market

[17-Apr-19 01:37 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Maybe thats the case too, they annouance ENJ today

[17-Apr-19 01:37 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
That is a lot of reward to miss out on unless 350k kmd is only 10% of your holdings.

[17-Apr-19 01:37 PM] Tek#5253
I actually sent nano to girls in discotheques

[17-Apr-19 01:37 PM] Tek#5253
they understood

[17-Apr-19 01:37 PM] Tek#5253
and it was so fast and easy

[17-Apr-19 01:37 PM] Tek#5253
nano gets the #1 for fast easy noob tier friendly ness

[17-Apr-19 01:38 PM] Keppie#5156
haha @Tek

[17-Apr-19 01:38 PM] Tek#5253
im srs I sent 3 girls and 7 dudes nano until now, I also used Dash for introduction a few days ago

[17-Apr-19 01:38 PM] Tek#5253
never used bitcoin itself for introduction

[17-Apr-19 01:38 PM] Tek#5253
fuck  the fees, fuck the waiting

[17-Apr-19 01:39 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I would like to see a KMD/USDT pair on Binance since I trade in tether often.

[17-Apr-19 01:40 PM] CoinKing88#1540
those 3 girls wanted to see your Nano Balance first i assume?

[17-Apr-19 01:40 PM] Keppie#5156
You send crypto to a dude in a discotheque. Sounds a lot like you're buying drugs of  of them 😄

[17-Apr-19 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
>Hi, I'm a DASH trader, may I buy you a drink

{Reactions}
😂 

[17-Apr-19 01:40 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Haha, dont just pay for their drink @ the bar, NO send crypto so they can buy it for themselves

[17-Apr-19 01:40 PM] Tek#5253
srs if your wallet is so easy that girls in clubs can accept nano in under 3 minutes

[17-Apr-19 01:41 PM] Tek#5253
and mail themselves the recovery seed

[17-Apr-19 01:41 PM] Tek#5253
and they all understand

[17-Apr-19 01:41 PM] Tek#5253
and these girls werent smart

[17-Apr-19 01:41 PM] Tek#5253
