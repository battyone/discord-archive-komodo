pretty nice manipulation of btc price, makes 0 sense for it to be this stable in price for days

[02-Mar-19 06:58 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Yeah I'd agree there

[02-Mar-19 06:58 PM] Sdunbar#5064
ridiculously stable

[02-Mar-19 06:59 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Not sure how it is being done but it is weird

[02-Mar-19 06:59 PM] Sdunbar#5064
stable price is good I guess?

[02-Mar-19 07:14 PM] Markus#5464
wouldnt go long or short when price is stable like this, suddenly it either pump or dump and u lose ur position 😄

[02-Mar-19 09:10 PM] Vertigo#0439
We need another bch fork to drop 1 more k

[02-Mar-19 09:11 PM] peritonlogon#7708
Maybe it's stable because  the Crypto economy itself, not the speculators are driving it, and, day to day, it'a aggregate is more stable than the wild speculation that's built on much noise and very little signal

[02-Mar-19 09:12 PM] peritonlogon#7708
That was also the impression I got during the 2015 bear market

[02-Mar-19 10:28 PM] Vertigo#0439
Crypto is a stable coin now.

[02-Mar-19 11:01 PM] Markus#5464
kmd hella stable today also

[02-Mar-19 11:39 PM] Vertigo#0439
@Hollowman9000 I got a Beretta nano from buds yesterday.

[03-Mar-19 03:28 AM] meatspoon#7860
@Vertigo  Beretta's are fabulous firearms, so impossible to go wrong.  When I was shopping recently for a new CC pistol, I ultimately decided on the Taurus pt 111.  It was half the price of the Nano, it has twice the capacity and higher user ratings.   It surely isn't a Beretta, but if you are adding to the collection, it may be something to consider in the future.

[03-Mar-19 03:58 AM] Vertigo#0439
Yeah I had a taurus tcp but I'm afraid the 380 from that little barrel is not very effective.

[03-Mar-19 04:20 AM] meatspoon#7860
Yeah, my understanding of Taurus brand is that the quality and design varies greatly between different models.  Some are pretty awful, some are mediocre and some are quite nice.   I was really impressed with my pt 111 especially considering the price point.  But some Taurus' i wouldn't carry if you paid me.  I have never fired the tcp, but from what I understand about firefights, i want a bullet hose with deep reservoirs.   6+1 won't cut it for me and my twitchy finger.  I need 12.  Or more.  When KMD and the rest of my portfolio moons, my next carry gun will be the FiveseveN.  I think 20 rounds miiiiight be enough.

[03-Mar-19 04:39 AM] Markus#5464
Funny that BTT was having 20k btc volume just a while ago and now its at 370 btc volume

[03-Mar-19 04:39 AM] Markus#5464

[03-Mar-19 05:47 AM] Markus#5464

[03-Mar-19 09:31 AM] nocturnal#2177
what is this? ^^

[03-Mar-19 09:32 AM] nocturnal#2177
I like it

[03-Mar-19 09:32 AM] nocturnal#2177
but i have no idea what it is

[03-Mar-19 09:40 AM] nocturnal#2177
@hastrup what kind of fees does bitpanda charge? (having trouble verifying at the moment...)

[03-Mar-19 09:45 AM] CHMEX#0686
they dont have fees 
buy and sell are a few % off CMC price

[03-Mar-19 09:45 AM] CHMEX#0686
maybe 5% each way

[03-Mar-19 09:49 AM] nocturnal#2177
so fee is approx 5%? so if I transfer £100 to BTC I pay £5?

[03-Mar-19 09:49 AM] nocturnal#2177
basically same as coinbase?

[03-Mar-19 09:50 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes

[03-Mar-19 09:50 AM] nocturnal#2177
ok thanks

[03-Mar-19 09:51 AM] nocturnal#2177
the first company to offer reasonable fees on fiat-crypto will take over

[03-Mar-19 09:51 AM] nocturnal#2177
at the moment its a fleecing

[03-Mar-19 09:52 AM] CHMEX#0686
I imagine there is great risk involved in a fiat crypto gateway as prices might change quickly hence the high percentage

[03-Mar-19 09:54 AM] nocturnal#2177
mate someone could undercut that in a second

[03-Mar-19 09:54 AM] nocturnal#2177
its vastly overpriced

[03-Mar-19 09:55 AM] nocturnal#2177
just one of many barriers remaining to crypto adoption

[03-Mar-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
dealing with fiat is expensive. marketing to get customers is expensive.it is no where as easy as you make it sound. if it was there would be plenty of providers at below 5%

and of course banks that could do it, definitely dont want to

[03-Mar-19 09:58 AM] hastrup#8742
But what I often do is I check the price of what I get whit x amount so see witch give the most

[03-Mar-19 09:58 AM] nocturnal#2177
yes same

[03-Mar-19 09:58 AM] nocturnal#2177
unfortunately

[03-Mar-19 09:58 AM] nocturnal#2177
no average joe will pay 5%

[03-Mar-19 09:58 AM] hastrup#8742
Sometimes it's bitpanda sometimes its peer2.krd

[03-Mar-19 09:58 AM] nocturnal#2177
to use a new digital currency

[03-Mar-19 09:58 AM] nocturnal#2177
only crypto junkies

[03-Mar-19 09:59 AM] nocturnal#2177
would pay that

[03-Mar-19 09:59 AM] nocturnal#2177
like me 😃

[03-Mar-19 09:59 AM] hastrup#8742
😂

[03-Mar-19 10:00 AM] nocturnal#2177
out of curiosity why is it more expensive to transfer fiat > cypto? (more than crypto > crypto)

[03-Mar-19 10:00 AM] nocturnal#2177
exchanges do it all the time

[03-Mar-19 10:00 AM] nocturnal#2177
with almost zero fees

[03-Mar-19 10:00 AM] nocturnal#2177
(0.01% etc)

[03-Mar-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
you touch fiat, you need to have paid millions in fees

[03-Mar-19 10:01 AM] nocturnal#2177
who to?

[03-Mar-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
to recoup that, even with 5% you need to process tens of millions

[03-Mar-19 10:01 AM] nocturnal#2177
i dont pay anything to trasfer fiat

[03-Mar-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
to governments

[03-Mar-19 10:01 AM] hastrup#8742
@nocturnal if you want to use euro pungo wallet can be used for buying btc eth

[03-Mar-19 10:01 AM] nocturnal#2177
I'll check that out ty

[03-Mar-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
whoever touches fiat on behalf of others must follow all the fiat rules and regulations

[03-Mar-19 10:02 AM] nocturnal#2177
so the money goes on....? taxes?

[03-Mar-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
every country, different rules

[03-Mar-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
just to apply for money transmitter licenses, very expensive

[03-Mar-19 10:02 AM] nocturnal#2177
sure

[03-Mar-19 10:02 AM] nocturnal#2177
needs to be free

[03-Mar-19 10:03 AM] nocturnal#2177
for crypto mass adoption

[03-Mar-19 10:03 AM] nocturnal#2177
it will be in the future

[03-Mar-19 10:03 AM] nocturnal#2177
i have no dubt

[03-Mar-19 10:03 AM] nocturnal#2177
or doubt

[03-Mar-19 10:03 AM] nocturnal#2177
😃

[03-Mar-19 10:04 AM] nocturnal#2177
but exchanges swap btc for usd all the time with low fees.... is that different?

[03-Mar-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
real usd in bank account, or all the "usd" coins

[03-Mar-19 10:06 AM] nocturnal#2177
i mean if you trade btc.usd pair on exchange (not tether etc)

[03-Mar-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
those are just internal DB changes

[03-Mar-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
only deposit/withdraw is real

[03-Mar-19 10:07 AM] nocturnal#2177
yes that makes sense

[03-Mar-19 10:07 AM] nocturnal#2177
i have never withdrawn

[03-Mar-19 10:07 AM] nocturnal#2177
do you pay another 5% at that end?

[03-Mar-19 10:07 AM] nocturnal#2177
Crypto - fiat

[03-Mar-19 10:08 AM] nocturnal#2177
i mean getting btc back into a real bank acccount as fiat

[03-Mar-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
I would imagine the 5% is charged both ways, though maybe there are some vendors that charge less. bitpay might end up with a lower effective fee than 5%, not sure

[03-Mar-19 10:10 AM] nocturnal#2177
haha once you go in on crypto you never withdraw 😂

[03-Mar-19 10:10 AM] nocturnal#2177
thank for the info

[03-Mar-19 10:16 AM] Lumbi#8378
...workin' on setting up a 0.5% fiat -> LUMBER brokerage. once barterxx is running (or DP), LUMBER could easily be atomic swapped in the KMD ecosystem.

[03-Mar-19 10:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
>only deposit/withdraw is real
some country tax laws I think also says they will count tax on all the trades for selling and buying of crypto <-> fiat.

[03-Mar-19 10:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that requires csv of trades from exchanges

[03-Mar-19 10:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and that ends up ripping off cryptocurrency traders, by the governments

[03-Mar-19 10:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's best to just show what minimal possible you can show to government.

[03-Mar-19 10:34 AM] nocturnal#2177
@Lumbi 0.5 i would go for all day long...

[03-Mar-19 10:34 AM] nocturnal#2177
@grewalsatinder yes tax seems a grey area still and varies by territory

[03-Mar-19 10:35 AM] nocturnal#2177
i think some places even crypto-crypto trades are taxable eents
