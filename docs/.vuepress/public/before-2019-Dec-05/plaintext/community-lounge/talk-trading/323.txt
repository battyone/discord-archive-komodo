>i thought you could actually print money that merchants accepted
you can print money, marchants acceptance is hard work.

`no it isnt

The scale upon which it is accepted is irrelevant to a thing existing

to be a real currency government would need to accept it and you should be able to buy gas with it... but its not a requirement for a coin to work as a currency.

[30-Nov-18 12:50 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

A stick whittled into a penis is money if someone is willing to trade with it.

could be argued in today age penis is better :trollface:

[30-Nov-18 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
only old people argue that

[30-Nov-18 12:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but by someone who got banned earlier definition, vaginas are a currency and penises not, because they are more accepted and there are more vaginas than penises
