I really don't count that dump since it was done by the hacker which found a bug to create as many coins as he wanted in the komodo wallet. He was in a rush to sell them on the only "trusted" exchange that didn't turn off trading because the exchange was a two man operation and they don't work on the weekends.

`I don’t see a komodillionaire destroying their own value by overwhelming orderbooks`
While I was using a bit of hyperbole and 'poetic license'; the fact remains that if you have 1M and the price you liquidate at is only 25 cents higher, it's still a $250k profit and in the tens of millions if you bought at $1 and dump from $50 back to $1
Scale matters

What’s your twitter

[24-Sep-18 07:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The AMA doesn’t seem to have any posts in it

[24-Sep-18 07:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe tweet something?  I’ll RT

How are forks resolved

[24-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
On an assetchain with 3 nodes total on the network

[24-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
At some point I started running ahead

[24-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Now 3000 blocks ahead

Somebody halp

[24-Sep-18 09:11 PM] SHossain#0007
which chain @Hollowman9000 ?

[24-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
LIZ

[24-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Something @jspook16 launched

[24-Sep-18 09:13 PM] SHossain#0007
probably, you can stop the chain, and start again with the node ip that has the correct chain

[24-Sep-18 09:13 PM] SHossain#0007
it should find the right chain

[24-Sep-18 09:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Restarted already

[24-Sep-18 09:13 PM] SHossain#0007
if that does not work, stop the chain, delete data dir (except wallet.dat) and start

[24-Sep-18 09:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The node is right

[24-Sep-18 09:14 PM] SHossain#0007
sometimes starting the chain with `-rescan` helps as well

[24-Sep-18 09:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What if I’m the right chain and he’s forked?

[24-Sep-18 09:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I’m longer by 3000 blocks

[24-Sep-18 09:14 PM] SHossain#0007
is there any explorer?

[24-Sep-18 09:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No

[24-Sep-18 09:15 PM] SHossain#0007
then, you need to co-ordinate with him

[24-Sep-18 09:15 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe you are on the right chain, other needs to connect to you...

[24-Sep-18 09:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just curious why this wouldn’t resolve itself

[24-Sep-18 09:17 PM] SHossain#0007
yeah, dPoW helps a lot in this kind of scenerio

`Just curious why this wouldn’t resolve itself`
Because peer banning

[24-Sep-18 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
he says vs she says, without notarized chain, the "right" chain is a matter of opinion

[24-Sep-18 09:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I do

[24-Sep-18 09:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Once you ban a peer for having the "wrong" block, you never give them the "right" one

[24-Sep-18 09:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How do I check if I banned them

[24-Sep-18 09:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
On command line

[24-Sep-18 09:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[24-Sep-18 09:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
For sending

[24-Sep-18 09:36 PM] jspook16#3059
@Hollowman9000 I'll check tonight. Maybe I should just pay for notarization

[24-Sep-18 10:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
There’s no kind of tie-breaker mechanism for blockchains?

[24-Sep-18 10:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Seems like drawing board type shit

[24-Sep-18 10:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
with only 3 nodes, its just better to everyone delete everything and try again

[24-Sep-18 10:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the best method to not get a fork at the very early stages is to start the 2 nodes without mining and then do ./komodo-cli -ac_name=LIZ setgenerate true 1

[24-Sep-18 10:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that way one node will start mining only

[24-Sep-18 10:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if you want to connect other nodes, do so without mining (-gen parameter)

[24-Sep-18 10:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Hollowman9000

[24-Sep-18 10:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What’s difference between 3 and 1000

[24-Sep-18 10:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You’ll still need conflict resolution

[24-Sep-18 10:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
when you have 1000 its easier for the chain to find a consensus on which has the longest chain

[24-Sep-18 10:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
with only 3 nodes of relative similar cpu power, youll get confusion if everyone is mining at the same time

@VitalikButerin The goal is to make light wallets impractical.

The problem is that light wallets are used at all, and that an insufficient % of the network uses their own full node.

[25-Sep-18 03:10 AM] actionslacks#4072
I like the idea of a home appliance that runs a full node. You could distribute a raspi system on a board type deal in an enclosure and make it as plug and play as possible

[25-Sep-18 03:37 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Downloading a blockchain or multiple is impractical for normal users

@polycryptoblog Care to explain that position?

[25-Sep-18 03:44 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Many people who have gotten into this space don't have the knowhow let alone the patience to learn to install run and maintain a full node .  I know it's sad but in terms of adoption trends as cryptocurrency continues to grow less and less technically inclined folks will join

[25-Sep-18 03:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I've had to help with dozens of lite client wallet installs because people were getting confused ,  if they are getting confused with that they will definitely be confused running a full node.

[25-Sep-18 03:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
So, "Don't run a node because you might have to learn to type 1 line into cmd per wallet"... gotcha 👍

[25-Sep-18 03:48 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I don't agree with it either and know we need more full nodes but I don't think relying on the general population to do it is a practical thing

[25-Sep-18 03:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

How about just the 95k miners that exist?

[25-Sep-18 03:50 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
That's an option.  Somehow disband pools? Or that pool in a blockchain option you and James were talking about

[25-Sep-18 03:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is all for putting `getwork` back into the code 😎_

[25-Sep-18 03:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't think we could ever eliminate pools, it's just not realistic, but I will always remain in the belief that far too many exist because the core of Core has made them (or at least a stratum of your own) necessary.

[25-Sep-18 03:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure is slush is stuffed up Core's ass or the other way round 😕

The flip side to that is that the more people that "stay out of it" is the more that it stays entirely centralized around 5 guys

`Why going against light wallets?`
Because Core doesn't code them

[25-Sep-18 05:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The larger picture here is that the more daemon/wallet/whatever brands that exist is the less control they have over the process and the more possible is could be to decentralize the code at some future point.

{Reactions}
💯 

[25-Sep-18 05:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
So, each thing they demonize brings people back to Core, just as the more non-Bitcoin things they pretend are Bitcoin are the more things people give them credit for and the more loyalty they get

[25-Sep-18 05:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
For all the detractors to Core as a group, you have to give them credit for the fact that they are pretty damn good at brand marketing

[25-Sep-18 05:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Beside, this is PukeJr we're talking about, the guy that wrote a 2 page article on how early activation of segwit, not lead by Core, was an attempt to derail and delay segwit 🤦
