[09-Aug-18 05:11 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Even with this market

[09-Aug-18 05:16 PM] crumb#2550
sounds a bit optimistic, but i'd be totally fine when it would happen üòÑ

[09-Aug-18 05:21 PM] Buddz1993#5380
thats why the gap of 10$

[09-Aug-18 05:21 PM] Buddz1993#5380
but 10 $ its achievable

[09-Aug-18 05:21 PM] Buddz1993#5380

The upshot? Expect an approval ‚Äì its a matter of when not if.

[10-Aug-18 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
definitely a reason to dump all crypto

[10-Aug-18 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
some people really believe that the market prices in all things and if the market says something, it must be right

[10-Aug-18 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
when to me it seems very clear the market is not very caring about the facts

[10-Aug-18 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
and for those who think KMD price has suffered in the bear market, take a look at projects like counterparty, peercoin, blackcoin. even zcash has taken a big loss from ATH.

[10-Aug-18 06:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
It's very clear the market is still very easily manipulated

[10-Aug-18 06:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
in the grand scheme of things a 100 billion bitcoin market is very small

[10-Aug-18 07:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The easiest way of manipulating a market is by controlling the media... hey ETF, wait no ETF etc...

[10-Aug-18 07:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
For an ETF, that fund is obligated to hold the underlying assets right?

[10-Aug-18 07:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So in contrast to futures which does not affect real btc trading volume, the ETF's should affect volume for BTC for example?

[10-Aug-18 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes i think so, this is why the ICE deal was so good, as they have a way of securing the BTC in something I guess like an escrow, that is regulated. So that the "institutions" can "trust" it. Also the ICE deal is paid in BTC, rather than in USD like the futures we have already, which seem just a way to "bet" BTC will go either down or up, then manipulate the price to win the bet.

[10-Aug-18 07:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm, so if such an ETF get's approved

[10-Aug-18 07:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
It's safe to say that depending on the size of the fund we will see buy pressure give or take the size of the fund?

[10-Aug-18 07:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Should be good for some fireworks, although I suspect some OTC trades will happen as well

[10-Aug-18 07:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Don't think many 100M usd btc buy orders happen :p

[10-Aug-18 07:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
What if world pension funds invest 0.1% of their holdings in btc as a hedge

44 trillion in pension funds

[10-Aug-18 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
there are many OTC deals for BTC happening, in very large amounts, at a discount to the open market price. This allows to short it, buy it at 5% discount, dump part of it on the open market, push the price down 4%, make money on the shorts but not lose money on the cash buy.

[10-Aug-18 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
$100 mil seems like it is not on the bigger side of these OTC deals, so what we see on the trading market is just a show where they paint the popular TA patterns to reinforce where they want the price to go

[10-Aug-18 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
pick a low volume coin that you can be the main volume of. and see how easy it is to paint whatever TA pattern you want.

[10-Aug-18 07:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
$100M on the smaller side of these OTC trades? üòÆ

With an unverified account on binance, is there no way to trace tx back to you? Or would it be relatively easy

[10-Aug-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am using a basic unverified binance account for ages with no problems, but i am not really trying to hide anything, ie use same address's for ages etc.

[10-Aug-18 12:22 PM] snowdamn#2414
