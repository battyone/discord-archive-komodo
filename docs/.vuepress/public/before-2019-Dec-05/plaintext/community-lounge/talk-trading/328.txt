Why is bch being dumpted this hard?

[04-Dec-18 10:16 AM] actionslacks#4072
Because I have some bch bags

[04-Dec-18 10:18 AM] actionslacks#4072
Sorry for your loss

[04-Dec-18 10:31 AM] snowdamn#2414
leveraged ETH long for a quick 2x ? ü§î

[04-Dec-18 11:03 AM] Vertigo#0439
One of the great things about BTC is that there are only going to be so many Bitcoin ever created. Now when you fork it multiple times  this great thing disappear. That is why BCH and SV should die.

[04-Dec-18 11:04 AM] Vertigo#0439
BTC forks straight to top 10 without proving anything is a disgrace.

[04-Dec-18 11:08 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
a 2mb block increase would have prevented all this fragmentation

[04-Dec-18 11:12 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
but perhaps it's inevitable, perhaps you can't have a *single* open source software as the *only* standard, it's the  wrong instrument like pretending to use an hammer to pull a nail out

[04-Dec-18 11:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
Bitcoin is the victim of it‚Äôs own success.

[04-Dec-18 11:22 AM] actionslacks#4072
I‚Äôm bullish on the bear market. Sounds a little sadistic but it really is a good thing.

Well i lost mine a long time ago.

[04-Dec-18 11:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
This is all completely normal to me

[04-Dec-18 11:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
A little comforting actually

Well shit started hitting the fan fairly recently. And it‚Äôs not over yet.

[04-Dec-18 11:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
But the whole world is going nuts right now honestly

[04-Dec-18 11:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
But yeah i read something about crypto being the proxy retirement plan du jour for millennials and that may be a real disaster. But dude? Chainlink? Really?

[04-Dec-18 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the only problem, is when you need tro convert the cryyptos to other things to use them as currency then the issue arises... Had to sell way more KMd than I would ahve liked for server bills this month...

[04-Dec-18 11:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
Yeah but like @Deleted User said its just your medium of exchange

[04-Dec-18 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My DC depsit having a whole wall of GPUs and a ful node of just about every coin doest take crypto as pyment üòÜ

[04-Dec-18 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and with exchanges closed./... it was a run around to get KMD -> AUD took a few days, lost much fees and spreads

[04-Dec-18 11:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
I lost out on huge gains selling crypto to pay taxes in 2017

[04-Dec-18 11:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
I feel the pain

[04-Dec-18 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I pulled out all my crypto before december run up... not sure If I owe any taxes ... but tbh... I really just dont know... I took it out as cash and spent it all instantlyt on my house and debts

[04-Dec-18 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even if I owed the tax I havent got it

I grew up poor, i have a trade, i know i can make it no matter what. I guess that helps with the ambivalence

[04-Dec-18 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a mechanic trade ... always a perfect backup, own all my tools aswell...

[04-Dec-18 12:01 PM] actionslacks#4072
But i‚Äôve already been through this cycle a few times with crypto.

[04-Dec-18 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was pretty obvious it was going to happen... but there are a lot of new people who just dont know I guess...

Welcome to the puppy mill

[04-Dec-18 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I ont got in last year just before BCH hardfork... as far as taking a position goes, I had suyed BTC as currency a few times years past, and noticed it pretty much always went up, so took a gambe with my tax return, had over a year off work from that $1500 and I did it badly.

[04-Dec-18 12:06 PM] actionslacks#4072
I got in a few years ago, i missed out on giant yachts bro

[04-Dec-18 12:07 PM] actionslacks#4072
I sold 200 eth @ $50. Doesn‚Äôt sting so bad now though

[04-Dec-18 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I used bitpanda to sell... binance at 19k sat bitpanda at 16 üò¶

[04-Dec-18 12:10 PM] actionslacks#4072
No, i‚Äôm a very lucky individual. I‚Äôve been an acolyte of jl777 for many years now. And It has served me well.

wish me luck...

[04-Dec-18 12:20 PM] actionslacks#4072

[04-Dec-18 12:22 PM] actionslacks#4072
Double digits?

[04-Dec-18 12:23 PM] snowdamn#2414
no, i mean for entry here
need a quick run to $150 and then let it ride

[04-Dec-18 12:23 PM] snowdamn#2414
if crypto comes back, ETH is safe bet

[04-Dec-18 12:24 PM] actionslacks#4072
You are probably right, even though I still dont understand why eth is still a thing

[04-Dec-18 12:25 PM] snowdamn#2414
problem is where to place stop
tricky trade this

[04-Dec-18 12:25 PM] actionslacks#4072
Btc seems pretty well pegged to 4k

[04-Dec-18 12:26 PM] actionslacks#4072
Eth already lost out to fucking xrp tho

[04-Dec-18 12:26 PM] snowdamn#2414
well, if they peg ETH to $100, can't lose with this trade

[04-Dec-18 12:26 PM] actionslacks#4072
Xrp! Wtf

[04-Dec-18 12:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
This market is not based on any analogue to reality

[04-Dec-18 12:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
Eth goes to $50 based solely on my last sell price.

[04-Dec-18 12:28 PM] snowdamn#2414
$50 will suck

[04-Dec-18 12:28 PM] snowdamn#2414

i didnt sell much in 2017 because i was scared that big txs to my account would sound the alarms and make the government look into it

[04-Dec-18 12:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there is a good chance i could get accounts frozen and asked for source of funds, which would have been a huge PITA

This Coinbase announcement did not get noticed, so now some people are freaked out by seeing coins move out of cold storage.

which coinbase announcement?

[04-Dec-18 12:38 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
"Coinbase will be running scheduled maintenance across our platform that may cause movements on all Coinbase-supported blockchains."

[04-Dec-18 12:38 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@KomodoWorld  thank you,  very useful information üòÉ

[04-Dec-18 12:55 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@actionslacks  that‚Äôs the one currently people rent to mine verus and all that noise over there right? Which in theory means they aren‚Äôt a scam company and have actual working product?

[04-Dec-18 12:56 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Looking to mine their other coins, most people won‚Äôt try since they call scam but it seems if they‚Äôre using it for verus, then they have a working product and it‚Äôs just a matter of whether they will keep service going. Never understand why company don‚Äôt just mine themselves

[04-Dec-18 01:00 PM] actionslacks#4072
I think they are currently throwing so much hash at verus that cpu/gpu mining have been rendered unprofitable for the time being

[04-Dec-18 01:01 PM] actionslacks#4072
hence the uproar

[04-Dec-18 01:01 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Yeah, and that‚Äôs why I am thinking it means they actually have a decent new miner even though they only ‚Äúrent‚Äù it out and no selling atm

[04-Dec-18 01:01 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Everyone on forum says it‚Äôs scam and they have no miners

[04-Dec-18 01:01 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
But this sort of proves otherwise

[04-Dec-18 01:01 PM] actionslacks#4072
no they are selling

[04-Dec-18 01:02 PM] actionslacks#4072
@ $2500 a pop

[04-Dec-18 01:27 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
it's interesting if mining Verus is actually profitable. If Im not mistaken main volum is on DP and there no volume actually... so mining can only be done by people who do not need to cover costs imediately, as there is no buys

[04-Dec-18 01:28 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
als oseems stupid for a company to make special miner for Verus, where there is no market for Verus (=extreme low liquid)

[04-Dec-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They only selkl the miners for USD.... so by renting them out they dont need to sell the coins... its genius really.

[04-Dec-18 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Must be making a killing off of it... which is what mining is all about. Apparently it takes months to implemnt an algo on an FPGA ... seems like a very very good skill to be pursuing btw üòâ

[04-Dec-18 03:51 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I sent Sasha the info he asked for with the remaining NXT assets and haven't heard shit from him. I guess he's going to leave the holders hanging again.

[04-Dec-18 03:53 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I emailed him too, let's see

[04-Dec-18 03:57 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
All he asked for was NXT address and Waves address. Anyone could claim to have my account if that is all he needed. Expected him to respond by asking to send a traction from the NXT account. So he is either busy or just doesn't care.

[04-Dec-18 04:07 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
in my email I sent a a message signed with my Nxt address, so he can verify it

[04-Dec-18 04:23 PM] snowdamn#2414

might be worth to learn understanding charts tho, could multiply portfolio quite abit :p

unlike stocks, it's a faily safe bet that you can make a good 30% a year just learning to trade simple bollinger bands
