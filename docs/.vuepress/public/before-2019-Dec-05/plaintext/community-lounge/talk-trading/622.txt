This 8/41 ema cross on weekly chart, combined with the bounce off 200sma on weekly makes this a very very very very very very bullish setup in my book.

they want to have the ass stamp of the person who had the coins before you.

in fact- if the account is closed, I think it will be _illegal_ for them to keep my data

[09-May-19 03:58 PM] LocoMB#8593

[09-May-19 03:58 PM] Alright#0419
Do you think they're doing this to simply make it as hard as possible to withdraw coins so they can ultimately keep them?

[09-May-19 03:59 PM] Alright#0419
is there any actual law to support their "we need to know where these came from" policy?

[09-May-19 03:59 PM] LocoMB#8593
no, because I have to say in their favour: this request only came up _after_ I withdrew 5 BTC

[09-May-19 04:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
in fact, BITSTAMP is known to demand source of funds when you try to withdraw fiat- AFTER you sell BTC, so if you don't, they keep your fiat

actually, i couldnt find anything specifically about DEX. the closest seems to be about non-custodial wallet:
"Unhosted wallets are software hosted on a person‚Äôs computer, phone, or other
device that allow the person to store and conduct transactions in CVC. Unhosted
wallets do not require an additional third party to conduct transactions. In the case
of unhosted, single-signature wallets, (a) the value (by definition) is the property of
the owner and is stored in a wallet, while (b) the owner interacts with the payment
system directly and has total independent control over the value. In so far as the
person conducting a transaction through the unhosted wallet is doing so to purchase
goods or services on the user‚Äôs own behalf, they are not a money transmitter."

actually, it is specifically allowed!

[09-May-19 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
Under FinCEN regulations, a person is exempt from money transmitter status
if the person only provides the delivery, communication, or network access services
used by a money transmitter to support money transmission services.72 Consistent
with this exemption, if a CVC trading platform only provides a forum where buyers
and sellers of CVC post their bids and offers (with or without automatic matching of
counterparties), and the parties themselves settle any matched transactions through
an outside venue (either through individual wallets or other wallets not hosted by
the trading platform), the trading platform does not qualify as a money transmitter
under FinCEN regulations.73
