BTC dumped hard and KMD started to follow but then stopped short and is heading back up. Looks like AtomicDEX public beta is having an affect.

We're back to where I thought the bottom was weeks ago so I'm yawning at this stage. Atomicdex latest release is awesome though.

[06-Sep-19 06:59 PM] Bitfinger#6245
We have a nice bullish div on the daily so maybe Forbes can push KMD into the spotlight a little

that 94000 BTC transfer... it said one third was from huobi, but unless it was huobi doing it, seems a very large withdraw... could it be a hack of some sort? when huobi says they are investigating it, that seems a bit ominous

[06-Sep-19 08:22 PM] richardt#2807
I suspect a possible hack.  It seems unlikely that a mega-whale would want to draw attention to himself like that and move all funds to one single address

$1 Billion+ $BTC  was transferred in one transaction yesterday. Where did that come from? ü§î

We took a look and saw that a large percentage of it could be traced to @HuobiGlobal addresses

Can someone give me a tl;dr of what happened with K64? Been offline for 2/3 months

[06-Sep-19 10:18 PM] yorklab#7270
Really short: making  claims about funding without proof. Also claiming that a team member threatened them but still no proof.

[06-Sep-19 10:20 PM] yorklab#7270
What makes things more complicated is that a respected long time Komodo contributor visited the group and says they do have what they claim. But the issue still remains, they have not shown anything verifiable.

[06-Sep-19 10:21 PM] yorklab#7270
I am not taking sides, only stating what has transpired.

[06-Sep-19 10:22 PM] yorklab#7270
I for one hope they have the funds. I would like them to stay with Komodo and have great success.

I still own quite some. Sad to hear it went down this way. So it‚Äôs not sure yet wether the investment firm was a scam move or not?

[06-Sep-19 10:27 PM] Keppie#5156
What has Komodoworld to do with k64

[06-Sep-19 10:29 PM] PTYX#6840
There's no verifiable evidence. It also makes no sense that K64 asks investors to sign an NDA to attend an investor meetup and then ask the attendees to "make sure" they publish their experience.

[06-Sep-19 10:29 PM] PTYX#6840
Why not just publish the evidence they are showing investors?

[06-Sep-19 10:30 PM] PTYX#6840
I don't like taking sides either but it's hard to ignore the facts and someone has to keep asking the hard questions.

[06-Sep-19 10:31 PM] PTYX#6840
It's redundant. I wouldn't ask investors to sign an NDA while simultaneously asking them to publish things about what they saw.

[06-Sep-19 10:31 PM] PTYX#6840
It's makes little sense

[06-Sep-19 10:33 PM] PTYX#6840
Lol, so they sign an NDA, then turn around and publish "I believe now"

[06-Sep-19 10:35 PM] PTYX#6840
We've worked with NDAs enough to understand how they work.

[06-Sep-19 10:35 PM] PTYX#6840
You can go along for the ride but again, their procedure is more of a distraction than a requirement

[06-Sep-19 10:36 PM] PTYX#6840
possibly

[06-Sep-19 10:37 PM] PTYX#6840
or he's just trying to distance himself from the epicenter of the project and now those that vouch for it will be the face of it

[06-Sep-19 10:37 PM] PTYX#6840
probably the smart thing to do at this point for sure

[06-Sep-19 10:40 PM] PTYX#6840
the best thing overall is to leave them be. as i said a few days earlier, you can't really expect to save everyone from a bad investment. as long as they don't leverage Komodo to take in more investments there isn't much we can do. however, i stand by my opinion that asking an investor to sign an NDA to attend an event that is supposed to convince people that they are a legit project while explicitly asking them to publish their findings makes 0 sense.

[06-Sep-19 10:41 PM] PTYX#6840
Also i don't trust anything that i can't verify

[06-Sep-19 10:42 PM] PTYX#6840
if something is presented to me by jl777 and i can't verify it, i don't really trust it. I dont know ricardo but i'd hope everyone would verify something before giving it support. that's just my nature though.

[06-Sep-19 10:43 PM] PTYX#6840
i try to look at it from both angles.

[06-Sep-19 10:43 PM] PTYX#6840
but one angle makes more sense than the other.

[06-Sep-19 10:44 PM] PTYX#6840
yes it's eye opening that we have moved from "trust but verify" to "trust by trusting other people"

[06-Sep-19 10:45 PM] PTYX#6840
i couldnt even verify the supposed meeting's location that was had

[06-Sep-19 10:45 PM] PTYX#6840

it's either centralized or I can cheat at every game

[06-Sep-19 10:45 PM] PTYX#6840
or anything else that was glanced over. you also can't verify the 1.3 billion valuation

[06-Sep-19 10:45 PM] PTYX#6840
nothing is impossible but logic usually points to the most probable outcome

[06-Sep-19 10:46 PM] PTYX#6840
what exactly?

[06-Sep-19 10:47 PM] PTYX#6840
id have to ask where are these offices, who were the officials, and what evidence did GS show him?

[06-Sep-19 10:48 PM] PTYX#6840
anyone can hire 2-3 guys in suits, rent an office, and call it GS

[06-Sep-19 10:48 PM] PTYX#6840
doesn't make it official, just to those that might have seen it and believe it
