kmd uses btc for security no? my question you, maybe not right group but is it possible for kmd security > btc security?

[27-Nov-18 02:51 AM] Torankoku#4818
or can btc and btc security be two separate things? sorry for my ignorance xD

[27-Nov-18 03:01 AM] PHBA2061#2530
in PoW, security is proportional to the "works" provided by miners, Bitcoin is the most secured but theoretically any PoW coin could become more secured than Bitcoin

[27-Nov-18 03:01 AM] PHBA2061#2530
for your 2nd question, ofc Bitcoin & Bitcoin security are 2 different things

[27-Nov-18 03:02 AM] Torankoku#4818
ah, thanks. so essentially, the point at which kmd security exceeds btc could be possible, is what you are saying

[27-Nov-18 03:06 AM] PHBA2061#2530
theoretically yes, if Komodo has enough hashpower.

[27-Nov-18 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No not really... KMD needs a high hashrate coins to mooch off

[27-Nov-18 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What I meant about BTC being usless, as meant as currency... in context of the "hash wars" etc

[27-Nov-18 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if people use it as a currency mempool fills, and it breaks.

[27-Nov-18 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IF it retains value, then its hash rate will remain high

[27-Nov-18 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it is not useless in this case ... because dPoW can use it to secure other chains and data.... BUT without enough block reward at some point the hash rate will dissapear ...

[27-Nov-18 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1-2MB blocks, cant have enough TXs in them to keep current mining profitabilty ...

[27-Nov-18 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is a huge issue.

[27-Nov-18 03:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless BTC is litterally millions of dolalrs ... meaning it would cost your car to send $1 in fees ü§∑

[27-Nov-18 03:59 AM] Torankoku#4818
so if btc price is low, hashrate goes down due to no incentive to keep mining

[27-Nov-18 03:59 AM] Torankoku#4818
if hashrate goes down, then kmd loses value too?

[27-Nov-18 04:00 AM] Torankoku#4818
kmd value then is wholly dependent on btc, which is the current highest hashrate coin, is my understanding from this

[27-Nov-18 04:04 AM] actionslacks#4072
The value is not, the 51% attack prevention is.

[27-Nov-18 04:05 AM] actionslacks#4072
The valuation of any thing in crypto is completely subjective.

[27-Nov-18 04:13 AM] actionslacks#4072
And price can be controlled by whomever can print the fiat.

[27-Nov-18 04:21 AM] Torankoku#4818
perhaps you misunderstand me, my apologies

[27-Nov-18 04:21 AM] Torankoku#4818
i am not trying to focus on price. im trying to understand true value of kmd

[27-Nov-18 04:22 AM] Torankoku#4818
if true value of kmd is protection of 51% attack prevention, this is dependent on hashrate no?

[27-Nov-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the coin we are notarising to has a very low hash rate, and there exists enough hash power out there to easily 51% attack said coin, you would still need to over power noary nodes, who have easy diff mining, whilst in a short term attack, this is possible with enough hash rate, over a long period is quite impossible as far as I understand it.

[27-Nov-18 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So even if BTC hash rate fell subsantially a 51% attack against coins secured by KMD notary nodes would still be ahrder to attack than coins not secured by notary nodes... And taking this further, if there does not exist a fork of BTC with anything near the current hash power of BTC... then crypto has lost the war against fiat and it doesnt really matter any more at this point.

[27-Nov-18 04:55 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
More hashrate drives up difficulty , kmd retargets every block , notaries still mine on easy

[27-Nov-18 04:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not exactly ...

[27-Nov-18 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can hit KMd with very high hash rate and mine blocks very fast in a row for a little time

[27-Nov-18 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it would adjust within 50 blocks ... and then notaries would easy mine ... you would need to exponentially increase hash to maintain a 51%

[27-Nov-18 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even without a high hash rate coin notrised to, there is still a checkpoint in the KMD chain, so reorgs cannot happen, regardless if we notarise to BTC or ourself or any other coin for that matter.

[27-Nov-18 07:29 AM] jorian#4555
read the discussion from 8 hours ago about the 'use' of 2000 chains on CMC and then read `unless BTC is litterally millions of dolalrs ... meaning it would cost your car to send $1 in fees` it almost seems as if we need thousands of chains just to keep tx fees low

3100$ is 200 weekly average, so hopefully we see a bounce there

My $BTC Plan. I personally don't think we've hit bottom, you don't get this long to buy the bottom. Heavy support at $2900-$3100:

‚úÖ 200 WMA support ramp.
‚úÖ 85% 2014 fractal retrace. 
‚úÖ Possible base 3 of parabolic (common retrace).
‚úÖ Looking for bounce to ~$5500-$...

Bought .5 here, just to make sure it keeps going down.

Can‚Äôt wait to find out about the fatal flaw in btc as well.

Maybe he‚Äôll be the first to do atomic swaps.

[27-Nov-18 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
if any blockchain has consistent TB blocks.... well it isnt very practical to use and how can you possibly sync to it? does anybody have 20gbps bandwidth to keep up with this chain? how can you possibly sync, even if you can keep up with the TB blocks? So a TB blocks blockchain is just silly at least for another few decades, which means relying on a TB chain for anything is also pretty silly

[27-Nov-18 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
if BTC hashrate falls, then some other chain will have higher hashrate. This can be deduced as there will be all that mining gear. so KMD would just switch to using whatever is the most secure chain

[27-Nov-18 09:43 AM] snowdamn#2414
thank you for the insight! üëç

[27-Nov-18 09:43 AM] snowdamn#2414
Craig needs a spanking it seems...

[27-Nov-18 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
well he is right that a TB of data is hard to cross correlate... but still you can know that the attacker computing resource will be a lot bigger than any practical blockchain, so without zero knowledge, it will most likely be deanonymized

[27-Nov-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
TB blocks sounds ridiculous ... GB not that bad, but TB is silly.

[27-Nov-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
