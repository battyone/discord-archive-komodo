@Acura can you check to see if zeroknowledge proofs are quantum resistant? i am not sure on that point

[24-Feb-19 07:21 PM] nocturnal#2177
to be fair

[24-Feb-19 07:21 PM] nocturnal#2177
if quantum resistent is analogous to water resistant

[24-Feb-19 07:22 PM] nocturnal#2177
then its probably quite accurate üòÉ

[24-Feb-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
the distinction is total 100% wipeout for sure when QC arrives, vs. a chance of surviving long enough to transition to the quantum secure algos

[24-Feb-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
where quantum secure are proven to be immune to quantum computer of however many qbits

[24-Feb-19 07:23 PM] nocturnal#2177
the implication to the uninitiated is "quantum proof"

[24-Feb-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
likely it will take a QC to create such a thing

[24-Feb-19 07:23 PM] nocturnal#2177
exactly

[24-Feb-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont expect I am talking to uninitiated. I used industry accepted terms in the ways it is accepted to mean

[24-Feb-19 07:24 PM] nocturnal#2177

[24-Feb-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so if there is no point to spend any more than a weekend on quantum resistant stuff, i wont. but as it is I am not aware of any quantum resistant blockchain that is usable

[24-Feb-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so it might be worth spending a full week on it

i would assume zcash zaddr are subject to quantum computer solving as it uses normal encryption

can the same address be reused?

[24-Feb-19 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems they are using Winternitz one time signature scheme

[24-Feb-19 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
they link to dilithium on their site, maybe they plan to upgrade to it?

[24-Feb-19 07:41 PM] tolken#2655
Possibly, might need more than a weekend though.

[24-Feb-19 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it would take me a full week to make a usable dilithium based chain as it would need to support change addresses. and multiple inputs. right now it just spends a single input from a special send tx

Make the chain then ask an organization with a Super Computer if they can break it. That might make for some good marketing. üòÅ

[24-Feb-19 07:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You assume a SC can break standard cryptography

Doesn't matter, still good marketing.

*the implication to the uninitiated is "quantum proof"*

By uninitiated, do you mean those that are below a 1st grade reading level?  

Resistant.
Resistant.

Re-sis-tant. 


Just because you assume that means "Proof" doesn't make you right @nocturnal

That's good cuz i just bought some

damn coinbase put a 3 day hold on my withdrawal though so now i cant buy KMD right now lol

[24-Feb-19 09:43 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Need to get lucky these next 3 days and have btc up and KMD down before i buy

[24-Feb-19 09:48 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Are atomic swaps still happening or is that on hold these days?

[24-Feb-19 10:04 PM] jspook16#3059
Atomic swaps have been released in to the wild. There is no putting them on hold

[24-Feb-19 10:08 PM] Sdunbar#5064
is there a site still tracking them?

[24-Feb-19 10:08 PM] Sdunbar#5064
dexstats always show 0 now

[24-Feb-19 11:33 PM] nocturnal#2177
hey @FishyGuts yes i assumed the incorrect meaning

[24-Feb-19 11:33 PM] nocturnal#2177
however its still largely nonsense if you think about it

[24-Feb-19 11:34 PM] nocturnal#2177
what good is water resistance to a divers watch?

[24-Feb-19 11:34 PM] nocturnal#2177
what good is quantum resistance to a blockchain?

[24-Feb-19 11:35 PM] nocturnal#2177
even the article presented explicitly stated a vague assumption is being made of a 'large' quantum computer

[24-Feb-19 11:35 PM] nocturnal#2177
and that the post quantum resistance is 'plausible' i.e. its possible but no one knows

[24-Feb-19 11:36 PM] nocturnal#2177
if you cant see the point im making i think you are being willfully blind

[24-Feb-19 11:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I take those phrases at base meaning.   Resistant.

[24-Feb-19 11:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Not looking at the math of whats possible, and then determining, without review, that it's "impossible" is a stance you seem smart enough to not take.

[24-Feb-19 11:48 PM] nocturnal#2177
dude its a largely meaningless bit of marketing

[24-Feb-19 11:48 PM] nocturnal#2177
ive looked into quantum computing alot

[24-Feb-19 11:48 PM] nocturnal#2177
im not a physicist

[24-Feb-19 11:48 PM] nocturnal#2177
but that phrase smells bad

[24-Feb-19 11:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Youre discussion and arguments are full of well heelled responses but youre assuming a lot of things, while the other side is too.    Its uinfair to throw away both sides assumptions.

[24-Feb-19 11:50 PM] nocturnal#2177
what am i assuming?

[24-Feb-19 11:51 PM] nocturnal#2177
enlighten me üòÉ

[24-Feb-19 11:52 PM] nocturnal#2177
in short - in quantum cryptography

[24-Feb-19 11:52 PM] nocturnal#2177
you cant encrypt securely against QC without a QC

[24-Feb-19 11:52 PM] nocturnal#2177
so 'resistance' is useless, its like saying i'm nuclear blast resistant if i live 2 seconds longer

[24-Feb-19 11:54 PM] nocturnal#2177
but people are thinking ahead about it which is good

[24-Feb-19 11:54 PM] nocturnal#2177
just that if people believe their own hype machines

[24-Feb-19 11:54 PM] nocturnal#2177
they make different investment decisions

It's unbelievable how sensitive the markets are to Bitcoin. Since that big Dump earlier, every time Bitcoin moves down $30 or $40 some of the Alts (including kmd) sell off quickly.  People are nervous now.

Lost a lot of market cap, back down we go or back to range, no progress onb BTC. What it managed to gain in 4 or 5 days si wiped out in one 15 min candle. Not bullish PA.

[25-Feb-19 01:01 AM] Likewise#6767
just for the fun of it I'm going to throw 500$ at a short BTC.
