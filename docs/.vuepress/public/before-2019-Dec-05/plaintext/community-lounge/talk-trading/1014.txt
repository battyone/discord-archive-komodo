[05-Aug-19 05:23 PM] Tek#5253

[05-Aug-19 05:25 PM] Tek#5253
I can only shill one coin so much

[05-Aug-19 05:25 PM] Markus#5464
i have a feeling the crypto scene is way too early for it to understand the importance of what kmd doing

[05-Aug-19 05:26 PM] p.#1126
explain it to us, vs the other most important projects

[05-Aug-19 05:26 PM] p.#1126

[05-Aug-19 05:26 PM] p.#1126
and cry

[05-Aug-19 05:35 PM] actionslacks#4072
projects dont have to actually have a functional protocol, they're all buying promises. not products.

[05-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Tek#5253
thats wrong bro

[05-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Tek#5253
I have some BCH , DASH and XMR

[05-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Tek#5253
all functional projects

[05-Aug-19 05:37 PM] actionslacks#4072

[05-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Tek#5253

[05-Aug-19 05:39 PM] Tek#5253

This is the way I scout for buys for the ones who were interested.

[05-Aug-19 06:10 PM] Lanii#8302
If you need me to clarify smth holla at me

[05-Aug-19 06:12 PM] Lanii#8302
There is no such thing as "it has to do it this way", there is no 100% in trading but this way I have a couple of rules that I follow that keeps me from getting rekt.
