creatin so many solution would be surprising if KMD will not be big part of any app in 5 years perspective

[23-Jan-19 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` many services allow payments in BTC`
I can't think of 30, much less "many"

[23-Jan-19 02:13 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
once I been to Holland at rando mrestauran there was "BTC accepted" on the back of menu

[23-Jan-19 02:13 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
out of curiosity I asked owner if people really pay BTC

[23-Jan-19 02:13 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
she didnt remember soemone really did ever 😃

[23-Jan-19 02:13 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but "it's there"

[23-Jan-19 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I concede that there may be "many" grass-roots and/or bandwagon places that accept it, but by any definition of scale utility BTC is fairly unused and unaccepted

[23-Jan-19 02:22 PM] PTYX#6840
The reality is that people don't pay for dinner with gold, oil, or bitcoins. They use local currencies.

[23-Jan-19 02:22 PM] PTYX#6840
To bring btc or any other cryptocurrency for that matter to such scale will take many many more years.

[23-Jan-19 02:23 PM] PTYX#6840
Systems that seamlessly interact between the local currencies and the cryptocurrencies could be what is needed. That could be a reason why people are now hailing stablecoin as the "next" thing.

"Day 2 was the day that I realized that most all of the places that used to accept bitcoin in 2013-14 no longer did. Almost all of the places I researched were either gone or had stopped taking crypto a while ago." https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/living-on-bitcoin-day-2-being-unbanked-has-been-easy-but-also-hard/

I remember those times in 2013-14

[23-Jan-19 02:24 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
all hail Core: the best developers in the world! /s

[23-Jan-19 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`with gold, oil, or bitcoins. They use local currencies.`
That comparison is exactly why I feel as I do about BTC
The wp notion *was* for it to be "electronic cash" (something that couldn't even be compared to "oil or gold")
Core has a different vision, and as long as "oil and gold" is "at the top", then that's how __all__ crypto will be "pigeon-holed"

[23-Jan-19 02:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Systems that seamlessly interact between the local currencies and the cryptocurrencies could be what is needed. `
That, quite literally, defeats the entire point

[23-Jan-19 02:27 PM] PTYX#6840
I don't expect a decentralized cryptocurrency to take over any national currency in totality. If you try to go head on against the biggest institutions in the world you'll find yourself in a world of hurt and could meet even more resistance.

[23-Jan-19 02:28 PM] PTYX#6840
By building systems that interact with the two spheres and to a certain degree complies with established laws then you introduce a new model without as much resistance.

[23-Jan-19 02:28 PM] PTYX#6840
Plus, there is also a technological leap when using cryptocurrency.

[23-Jan-19 02:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Bitpay (and a few others) affords you that level of pretending

[23-Jan-19 02:29 PM] PTYX#6840
Probably less than 5% of the population knows how to use them. It will take at least a decade to get a new generation using some sort of blockchain on a daily basis.

[23-Jan-19 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There's no need for them to even know about "blockchain", how many car users do you suppose understand how efi works?

[23-Jan-19 02:32 PM] PTYX#6840
When blockchains are as user friendly as cars I will agree with you

[23-Jan-19 02:33 PM] PTYX#6840
Or as user friendly as a dollar and a bank account for that matter. Which is what we are trying to replace

[23-Jan-19 02:33 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Working with fiat is not always straight forward. most people do not understand how the banking system actually works but they trust it?

[23-Jan-19 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure how much easier it can get than the apps that produce and scan a QR code

[23-Jan-19 02:34 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
People still think they deposit notes in an account and those notes are sat there

[23-Jan-19 02:34 PM] PTYX#6840
Most people in my country wouldn't know how to scan a QR code

[23-Jan-19 02:34 PM] PTYX#6840
There is a technological curve

[23-Jan-19 02:35 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
it will come like the mobile phone rev did imo

[23-Jan-19 02:35 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
everyone hated mobiles

[23-Jan-19 02:36 PM] PTYX#6840
It's probably more dramatic than asking everyone to change from paper mail to emails. How long did that switch take? People still write notes and use telegrams and stuff

[23-Jan-19 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has literally never owned a microPC masquerading as a phone, and finds it sad that he's the one supporting the position that it's easier than making a phone call with one of those things_

[23-Jan-19 02:37 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
using a car for example. majority do not know how the engine works or even how to maintain it. the manufactueres made everything you need to touch with a yellow cap like oil water battery etc. the same is happening with blockchain

[23-Jan-19 02:37 PM] dokrates#8987
nice buys

[23-Jan-19 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CryptoNinjaa That's exactly what I'm saying, there are enough apps out there (on both the user side and the vendor side) that "people can't understand blockchain" is an failed excuse imo

[23-Jan-19 02:38 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
a big atraction to crypto imo over traditional banking is settlement times

[23-Jan-19 02:39 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i agree i do not think they need to know. just the basics

[23-Jan-19 02:39 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
people swapped from mail to email because of time taken

[23-Jan-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
postage cost more money than email

[23-Jan-19 02:40 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
and that

[23-Jan-19 02:40 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
although i dont spend 50 quid a month of stamps but the net i do 🤣

[23-Jan-19 02:40 PM] PTYX#6840
You can't rush adoption in my opinion. It will take time. I wouldn't call it a failed excuse at this point in time.

[23-Jan-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
if email cost the same, maybe would have taken a lot longer due to fax machines

[23-Jan-19 02:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
they are jumping the gun ptyx

[23-Jan-19 02:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
every new tech has taken adoption time and ends up just being the norm

[23-Jan-19 02:43 PM] PTYX#6840
The first email was sent in 1971, pretty cool

[23-Jan-19 02:43 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
supose if you put a smart phone in my hand 15 years ago i would be like wtf is this i cant use it

[23-Jan-19 02:44 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
maybe 17 years i forget how old i am lol

[23-Jan-19 02:44 PM] PTYX#6840
@CryptoNinjaa not only would you not be able to use it, only a few people would be able to talk back to you since there would only be a few

[23-Jan-19 02:44 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah but the smart phone isnt a failure just needed ppl to catch up

[23-Jan-19 02:44 PM] PTYX#6840
definitely

[23-Jan-19 02:44 PM] PTYX#6840
learning curves and all

[23-Jan-19 02:45 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
we also have phones with huge buttons for ease of use lol

[23-Jan-19 02:46 PM] PTYX#6840
They still sell these for grandma

i had to learn how to use a phone but kids now a days are all over it. maybe our children we should focus on ?

[23-Jan-19 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@PTYX by "failed excuse" I mean that it's because it fails on an epic level due to being nothing more than an imaginary excuse
Lack of adoption isn't because it's "hard" or much of anything needs to be "learned"
Lack of adoption is because:
\* We, in the community, portray it as "hard to learn" even when it's not (like I said, it's harder to make a call on an iPhone than it is to make a tx)
\* Even still, BTC is "god" and all "average people" know of it is "dark web", "criminals", and "Silk Road" (usually in that order)
\* We refute silly claims like the one that started this convo in obscure channels like this and not using the same megaphone that detractors use

Guys do you watch si-fi movies sometimes? :pirate: remember a scene where someone use a digital cash? might be a matter of new generation which will see more movies where crypto is used as a cash and this could (through culture/movies) propagate ?

[23-Jan-19 02:50 PM] Tek#5253
