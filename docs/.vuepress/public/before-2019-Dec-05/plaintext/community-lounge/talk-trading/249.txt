to trick other bots lulz

[24-Oct-18 07:26 PM] Alice#9607
@bpkdasbaum the 0.01s are there to move other trades out of sight

[24-Oct-18 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
my guess is these bots use the same algo across all the altcoins during bear

[24-Oct-18 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
and when it flips to bull marketmode will be pushing prices up

[24-Oct-18 07:26 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@Alice oh that's sneaky

[24-Oct-18 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, bots might have a finite unfiltered window of recent trades

[24-Oct-18 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
if they are all sells, it could bias the other bots to sell

[24-Oct-18 07:27 PM] Alice#9607

I don't think whale bro is buying to dump $0.05 cents higher. He may stay a while with all that KMD probably waiting for 10k

[25-Oct-18 09:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
are the tipbot tx all onchain?

[25-Oct-18 09:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or first handled on a centralized tipbot ledger and only on chain when you withdraw/deposit?

Tipbot is centralized software afaik

Aha because for the ARRRbot I thought it said something like wait a moment for the tx to process, so I figured because it was onchain
