Nice KMD volume

[27-May-19 10:19 AM] jkluwu0499#8218
The  Poker looks cool, can KMDice be used too besides from CHIPS?

CHIPS + LightningNetwork + PANGEA + CC = blockchain enforced realt...
Decentralized poker is quite a difficult problem for various technical reasons, but especially the requirement for all players to be able…

[27-May-19 10:21 AM] jkluwu0499#8218
Thanks James. I'll read it 😀

[27-May-19 11:56 AM] Funkyball#2786
Is the poker up and running? I had now idea KMD had a CHIPS asset for poker!

@Funkyball Gui with another layout is nearly complete, this one makes it prettier

[27-May-19 12:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Our friendly whale is back at 15k sats

[27-May-19 12:23 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Thoughts on CHIPS vs ARRR pricing? CHIPS has 5x less coins but would it have 5x utility/value?

They raise lots of sheep in NZ, all good

[27-May-19 12:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@hyperDEX CHIPS having a singular purpose, I'm not sure that it has *more* utility

[27-May-19 12:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Same could be said about pirate

[27-May-19 12:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pirate can be used for millions of things and is already used as a currency

[27-May-19 12:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Will be interesting once it gets going, what the value is placed on it

[27-May-19 12:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Also WTF happened with K64.......1m sold at 42 sats now at 7200 sats today

[27-May-19 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
once everything is live, my guess is that CHIPS will level out at ~$1

[27-May-19 12:30 PM] hyperDEX#6586
21m valuation isnt too big if you consider dentacoin at 70m

[27-May-19 12:30 PM] hyperDEX#6586
or LTC at 7billion lol

[27-May-19 12:35 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
K64 was sold by somebody with fat fingers

[27-May-19 12:37 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It's a massive punt at 7200 sats in my opinion.

[27-May-19 12:41 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@NutellaLicka  fat fingered twice?

[27-May-19 12:42 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah I dunno, they put a message out on their discord saying they fat fingered it. Pretty funny/unlucky tbh. The company is responsible for every coin and accidentally gives away 700k+ I suppose they will make enough selling the rest of them though!

[27-May-19 12:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@hyperDEX I guess you traveled NZ and forgot to give me a text or msg.... 😄

[27-May-19 12:57 PM] Caglio#3337

Caglio, you are missing your calling as a Life Coach

[27-May-19 01:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
I think you and Tek should team up, maybe start your own school to teach the young-uns the ways of the world.

seems like someone is pissed cause he missed the rocket to the moon

[27-May-19 04:12 PM] Markus#5464
cant find other reason why someone would say something like that 😄

[27-May-19 04:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
when governments make things illegal, the price usually skyrockets.

[27-May-19 04:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
we have seen historical examples with booze, drugs, guns, etc

[27-May-19 04:15 PM] 차미숙#8912
How are you guys into crypto if you didn't even think about that scenario

[27-May-19 04:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
my pops visited the USSR way back in the day and American goods were essentially illegal.  He sold several pairs of his jeans for a lot of money.  Friggin' pants from America were illegal and therefor fetched a ridiculous price

[27-May-19 04:16 PM] Markus#5464

[27-May-19 04:16 PM] 차미숙#8912
If the product is what the market demands, premium adds up if made illegal

[27-May-19 04:16 PM] 차미숙#8912
If it's not, well it's going to 0

[27-May-19 04:17 PM] Markus#5464
governments can ban crypto nobody would care, not like governments dont do shady things....pretty much all the time

[27-May-19 04:18 PM] Markus#5464
how is printing endless money legal?

[27-May-19 04:18 PM] jorian#4555
because the law permits it

[27-May-19 04:19 PM] 차미숙#8912
Crypto will one day go through illegal phase. It's gonna happen someday

[27-May-19 04:19 PM] 차미숙#8912
And it will be on the testbed if it can prove itself

[27-May-19 04:19 PM] Markus#5464
china already banned it a couple of times

[27-May-19 04:19 PM] 차미숙#8912
If it survives that test, it's gonna be truly digital gold

[27-May-19 04:20 PM] 차미숙#8912
Right now just speculative digital gold

[27-May-19 04:39 PM] actionslacks#4072
I wish they would make it illegal.  The great thing about KMD being so under the radar is that most don't even understand what is about to happen. They can EMP attack the entire network but outside of that... the genie is out of the bottle and can never be put back in.
