[03-Jun-19 11:49 AM] Markus#5464
well if it gets the real recognition and devs to start building on kmd then it would yes but thats not easy

[03-Jun-19 11:52 AM] yorklab#7270
Everyone assumes it's one person. ü§î

A nice fairy tale people like to tell themselves

[03-Jun-19 11:53 AM] Tek#5253
no, you assume that everyone assumes its one person

[03-Jun-19 11:54 AM] Tek#5253

[03-Jun-19 11:54 AM] dxer666#8963

[03-Jun-19 11:54 AM] Tek#5253
anyone with that much of an interest should probably be here

[03-Jun-19 12:00 PM] Tek#5253
yeah but he removed his previous order too and then came back with a 100 btc order later

[03-Jun-19 12:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
a higher market cap will help project a lot.
more funds, more devs, more development, more exposure to crypto-devs.

[03-Jun-19 12:01 PM] Tek#5253
the bots have clearly run out of funds to dump

[03-Jun-19 12:01 PM] Tek#5253
usually when he removes his order the bots start selling

[03-Jun-19 12:01 PM] Tek#5253
it didn't really happen this time

[03-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Tek#5253
it did happen a few hours ago when he removed his first wall for a whle

[03-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Tek#5253
or maybe itl dump now

Was this airdropped ?

[03-Jun-19 02:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Keppie I believe it was an airdrop test prior to sending out VOTE2019

[03-Jun-19 05:19 PM] BlockTech#6895
I think WhaleBro is gone for a while, ARRR order at 0.13, 0.14 and 0.15KMD gone at the same time he retracted the 500K KMD wall on binance. He is probably waiting for ARRR/KMD to get back to 16k and 0,1KMD. That's my guess.

[03-Jun-19 05:32 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
I wonder how alts will behave when btc pamp

[03-Jun-19 05:32 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Gonna be interesting to see the correlation there

[03-Jun-19 05:38 PM] BlockTech#6895
Never mind, he is back with 600K KMD x)

[03-Jun-19 05:39 PM] BlockTech#6895

I can hardly imagine that this is manual- certainly scripted ü§ñ
simple stuff like that ain't that hard to do - but manually will lead to a fat finger sooner or later üîú üöΩ
so whalebro is sitting there sipping his morning coffee, stroking that Blofeldian persian cat and puts in the params for today

Definitely manual.  No one would let a bot control 100 btc orders.

[03-Jun-19 07:21 PM] p.#1126
could be spread across several accounts

[03-Jun-19 07:23 PM] Alexfrog#1338
we're talking about 100 btc orders that appear and disappear all at once
