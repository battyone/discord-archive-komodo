Then 1000 is just enough to make it

[09-Jan-19 01:18 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
In terms of "making it rich" i would say 1000 kmd could become a nice chunk of value yeah. I always try to accumulate 1000 of any project i see fit. as long as the supply isn't bazinga billions 1000 should see you good if it moons.

[09-Jan-19 02:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362

yeah, except maybe impulsive will gather pace as reality sets in.... multi months for a real breakout seems like an overly long time frame. (Not sure if you intended to draw them with a certain time frame).

Also targets for 5th wave are too conservative IMO and would be nice to see 3rd wave play out like a real 3rd wave and overshoot resistance, but it's a good level to expect some retrace. 60k is on the cards if we really break out. 

buying anywhere below 17k seems optimistic IMO

it's kind of a weird proposition IMO. "Let's do a bank run to make a point, cos we are tired of being impoverished and slaves to the system" "oh shit, we are now completely impoverished and fucked by the system, good point"

The French are clueless. They keep demanding that government coddle them and then they get confused as to how the government has grown into this uncontrollable behemoth.  They keep feeding the beast and then are confused as to why it has grown so large.

Sept - Oct felt like pre breakout too ;)

price action is similar right now, hopefully we actually do something soon and don't turn into hardcore sideways and relentless chop...

equities indexes looks like they're due for a correction down soon, hopefully that doesn't drag bitcoin

Yellow vests’ shocking new move
Yellow vest activists are urging French citizens to empty their bank accounts and spark a massive run on the country’s banks in their longstanding fight with the government — which could lead to the collapse of its banking system.
