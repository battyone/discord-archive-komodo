Is that the QT wallet?

[03-Nov-19 09:08 PM] LeshAft9#0083
the wallet page lists Verus Agama and OceanQT. I know QT is for gui.  I do prefer CLI wallets though

Thanks. Hmm so it's not an HD wallet? I know this is a thing sometimes with zcash forks

[03-Nov-19 09:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not sure exactly if it supports bip32 best to ask in #support

[03-Nov-19 09:19 PM] LeshAft9#0083
OK. I asked because it urges you to backup your wallet.dat file because of change addresses

@jl777c So it sounds like KMD is in much need of something that creates significant revenue to help keep things moving. Hopefully AtomicDEX could fulfill that need one day. Otherwise, it seems alot of it will depend convincing external dev's to build on KMD, risking their own resources.

[04-Nov-19 02:21 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
We will survive Iâ€™m not worried about it, much in the pipeline in terms of revenue generation and usage

@richardt is your opinion that things have not been moving?

[04-Nov-19 08:14 AM] Mark81#4505
Maybe he need to see RedHat moment for KMD just like linux saw. I think Komodo is doing just fine or how can it be that we are able to hire new devs in bottom of bear market?

@jl777c I think things are moving and progress is being made. My concern is that funds continue to decrease while more resources are needed and the tech/products are not at the point to offset all that (in terms of usage and revenue).

[04-Nov-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it is good that vast majority of funds are in BTC

kmd massive dump in the past few months  was probably because of wallet hacker dumping and Sam k64 dumping kmd investors money,

[04-Nov-19 06:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Top supernet holder, can someone explain me what he was doing sending 1 SN to himself back in june?

[04-Nov-19 06:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
consolidating adresses into coldwallet making 1SN utxo's?

[04-Nov-19 06:27 PM] CHMEX#0686
Its consolidating utxos from CRYPTO and DEX

[04-Nov-19 06:27 PM] CHMEX#0686
( notarizations and dex fee )

[04-Nov-19 06:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm and they are held in a random supernet address?

[04-Nov-19 06:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
that holds +-25% of supply? :p

[04-Nov-19 06:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or is that james that consolidates crypto/dex utxo into an address in his control to ease use?

[04-Nov-19 06:29 PM] CHMEX#0686
Maybe not random

[04-Nov-19 06:29 PM] CHMEX#0686
Top holder of most assets

[04-Nov-19 06:30 PM] CHMEX#0686
I guess related to james yes

[04-Nov-19 06:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That DEX balance :3040_kingpeepo:

[04-Nov-19 06:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so juicy

[04-Nov-19 06:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
also regarding kmd richlist... do we really think binance is holding 10M+ in cold storage?

[04-Nov-19 06:32 PM] CHMEX#0686
They said that yes

[04-Nov-19 06:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
they are up from 7million earlier this year, which would mean that more and more people are holding kmd long term on the exchagne?

[04-Nov-19 06:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
crazy

[04-Nov-19 06:32 PM] CHMEX#0686
Its in the distribution report

[04-Nov-19 06:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
aha cool

[04-Nov-19 06:32 PM] CHMEX#0686
Not the address but they said something like 10.5m

[04-Nov-19 06:32 PM] CHMEX#0686
So pretty close

[04-Nov-19 06:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
because it showed '?' after binance cold storage in dexstats, so I thought it's not not official yet maybe

[04-Nov-19 06:33 PM] CHMEX#0686
Never saw them confrming that ( which they will not do) but the transactions indicate it

[04-Nov-19 06:33 PM] CHMEX#0686
Will find out soon enough

[04-Nov-19 06:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
when they claim rewards?

[04-Nov-19 06:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or *if*

[04-Nov-19 06:34 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes

[04-Nov-19 06:46 PM] CoinKing88#1540
would be awesome if i actually bought near the bottom yesterday, bring me 8000 sats tomorrow!

[04-Nov-19 06:47 PM] Mische#6695
I sold a chunk right before the pump because of bills TT

[04-Nov-19 07:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Bottom was 5100 or 5200 2 weeks ago?

[04-Nov-19 07:58 PM] Flint#6435
buyers dominate but according to technical analysis, the asset is heavily overbought and needs short-term correction to take new heights

[04-Nov-19 07:58 PM] ronyi#5719
Just a simple question. Why we need 120conf. on Binance deposite? Just tryed now and little bit shocked...

jokes aside it's binance's decision really

[04-Nov-19 08:03 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes, they were informed they could lower confs and choose not to

[04-Nov-19 08:04 PM] ronyi#5719
Of course @Oszy. Intresting decision

[04-Nov-19 08:05 PM] LeshAft9#0083
maybe they don't believe in dpow

[04-Nov-19 08:05 PM] Oszy#5734
or in themselves ðŸ˜„

[04-Nov-19 08:06 PM] Lanii#8302
@Flint How can something possibly be heavy overbought if its lost over 90% its value from ath?

[04-Nov-19 08:09 PM] Flint#6435
@Lanii  on small time frames! Or do you think that after a 12% increase, the correction should not be? Or are you one of those who believe in the endless native? Do you know the pump and dump circuit? or did you think that this green candle - is it that investors came running to buy?ðŸ˜‚

[04-Nov-19 08:09 PM] Lanii#8302
Im one of those that dont belive in meme rsi

[04-Nov-19 08:10 PM] Lanii#8302
how can something possibly be overbought or oversold when there is a buer to every sell and a seller to every buy

[04-Nov-19 08:11 PM] Flint#6435
remember that after ANY absolutely any growth there is a correction! Iâ€™m talking about this correction! Especially if it is 12% growth in less than 6 hours - look at timeframes and read what candlestick analysis is at your leisure and how timeframes differ

[04-Nov-19 08:14 PM] Lanii#8302
Yes, I agree there is always a correction

[04-Nov-19 08:14 PM] Lanii#8302
but not because rsi is telling you its overbought or oversold

[04-Nov-19 08:14 PM] Lanii#8302
duh

[04-Nov-19 08:15 PM] Lanii#8302
if you expect certain things to happen based on rsi ur bound to get rekt

[04-Nov-19 08:15 PM] Lanii#8302
Markets can stay overbought/oversold for months

[04-Nov-19 08:15 PM] Lanii#8302
and there you are shorting every bounce longing every dip because rsi is telling you to do so

[04-Nov-19 08:15 PM] Flint#6435
why then did we fall from the recent level of 0.0000759 in a couple of hours to 0.0000704? Iâ€™m talking about this correction! There are no real buyers right now - they are manipulating the price to gain the desired position and then again making the pump and making the dump again - after all, the asset has groped for an approximate bottom and the manipulators are feeling the situation

[04-Nov-19 08:15 PM] Lanii#8302
we fell because there are some levels that need to be tested

[04-Nov-19 08:15 PM] Lanii#8302
not because rsi on your 5 min chart is saying so

[04-Nov-19 08:16 PM] Flint#6435
we talk about inside daily timeframes from 5 minutes to 12 hours! stop confusing everything together!

[04-Nov-19 08:18 PM] Flint#6435
and you use the bolinger clouds - they work out themselves perfectly - in a day I only thanks to them increased my portfolio with additional coins after 4 successful transactions
