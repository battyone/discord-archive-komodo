Can zcash and derivatives be tracked via the nullifiers

[31-May-19 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
you mean the nullifier that marks a specific zaddr vout as being spent?

[31-May-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
the thing that makes it hard to track is that unlike taddr tx where the vin is listed as txid+vout, the nullifier is inside the encryption/zksnark

[31-May-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
now if you had viewing keys to a significant part of the spend sequence, then i think you could

[31-May-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so be careful who you share the viewing keys with

[31-May-19 08:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Weak point being crypto exchanges and any other unencrypted means of value transfer, time of generation of nullifier n, nullification of nullifier n and creation of nullifier m on the chain, so on so forth until a nullifier coincides with an account adjustment on some other vulnerable exit point.

[31-May-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure you cant see any transparent info about nullifiers

[31-May-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
that is what being encrypted means

[31-May-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
so even if your txid is leaked (it has timestamp info and the encrypted data), other than that the trail stops. it wont be seen by people not receiving the funds that your nullifier was nullified

[31-May-19 08:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ha, just a drive-by tard‚Äôs loose understanding of how I thought zcash worked

[31-May-19 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
Bitcoin tracks unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to determine what transactions are spendable. In Zcash, the shielded equivalent of a UTXO is called a ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù, and spending a commitment involves revealing a ‚Äúnullifier‚Äù.

Zcash nodes keep lists of all the commitments that have been created, and all the nullifiers that have been revealed. Commitments and nullifiers are stored as hashes, to avoid disclosing any information about the commitments, or which nullifiers relate to which commitments.

What Is Zcash?

[31-May-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
basically the hash of the nullifier is revealed, so it seems even with a QC it wont be able to figure out it was yours

[31-May-19 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
...

[31-May-19 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
When a shielded transaction is spent, the sender uses their spending key to publish a nullifier which is the hash of the secret unique number ("rho") from an existing commitment that has not been spent, and provides a zero-knowledge proof demonstrating that they are authorized to spend it. This hash must not already be in the set of nullifiers tracking spent transactions kept by every node in the blockchain.

Nullifier = HASH(spending key, rho)

The zero-knowledge proof for a shielded transaction verifies that, in addition to the conditions listed above, the following assertions are also true:

For each input note, a revealed commitment exists.

The nullifiers and note commitments are computed correctly.

It is infeasible for the nullifier of an output note to collide with the nullifier of any other note.

[31-May-19 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
###
so as I said, the nullifiers are inside encryption, only the hash of the nullifier is public and that wont do any good to correlate it, even if your txid is leaked. really the all zaddr PIRATE is quite private and even if you tried, you have a hard time to lose the privacy. I think if you had an automatic tweeting of viewkeys for all your zaddrs, that would be what you need to do in order to lose your privacy

i don't understand why people are using apps where someone else other then themselves are holding the keys... simply use Signal instaed of Whatsapp and don't worry about such things

[31-May-19 10:32 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
the issue with using signal is that nobody else wants to switch over, and you can only text others who have the app
