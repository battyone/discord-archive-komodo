[15-Jul-19 11:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[15-Jul-19 11:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its already past 12 in utc

[15-Jul-19 11:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[15-Jul-19 11:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Markus it probably should not have been planned for the date of the notary change. But it is what it is, people are trying to get it out.

[15-Jul-19 11:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[15-Jul-19 11:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
In any looks like there might be some surprises today

[15-Jul-19 11:50 PM] hyperDEX#6586
No idea on the impact of the price but would be good for adoption

[15-Jul-19 11:50 PM] Neko#5830

[15-Jul-19 11:51 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Will leave it for the team to release it all.
