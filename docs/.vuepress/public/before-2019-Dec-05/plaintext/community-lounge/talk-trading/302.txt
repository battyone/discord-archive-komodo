not saying I support them... just sparking conversation

[24-Nov-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its kind of is what BTC was supposed to be ... and it was birthed in the right year

[24-Nov-18 02:21 PM] jorian#4555
as if 30 years ago they could predict this

The Assassination Of Bitcoin
"Cryptocurrencies have proven that there is an appetite for both a cashless digital payment system¬†and¬†digital assets. What central bankers and the world‚Äôs financial elite have figured out is that bitcoin stands in the way of this new world financial order."

if those predictions come true, well üòÖ

[24-Nov-18 02:27 PM] darkistto#5249
Hi guys. Who else thinks it makes sense now to invest in a KMD? Or it is better to wait for the price to fall even more (if Bitcoin falls). Are there any big ads that everyone is waiting for? (KMD)

[24-Nov-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats unknowable

[24-Nov-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if your inner voice says to buy

[24-Nov-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
buy! hard

[24-Nov-18 02:53 PM] darkistto#5249
He tells me to buy. Since we are at the very minimum for all time (year). But on the other hand, the second voice tells me that on Monday-Tuesday another fall BTC will begin. Trying to figure out what to do about it.üòÖ

[24-Nov-18 03:07 PM] meatspoon#7860
Well, you could buy a bit and keep some dry powder.  @darkistto   Sort of dollar cost average this trough

[24-Nov-18 03:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
i am wrestling with the same question.  But ultimately, if we see another bull run, it won't matter much if you bought this dip at $0.64 (current price) or $0.50.  You will have bought and you will be profiting orders of magnitude more than the average Joe who owns no crypto.

[24-Nov-18 03:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
Timing bottoms is frigging hard though, especially if the market is manipulated.  So, not financial advice, and I am not a professional, but you might consider buying a bit now but keeping plenty of fiat on the sidelines.  If it dips again, you can buy more and if come January ETF's are launched and it looks like we are transitioning to a bull market, you will still be able to buy sub $1 KMD on the way back up.

I thought I remember hearing that "subsidies" kick in for kmd notaries at somewhere around .50$ ? is this somewhat correct or am I thinking of something else? thank you

[24-Nov-18 07:49 PM] modereck#4269
@blackjok3r my inner voice says to buy buy more but im -55%  üòÇ

[24-Nov-18 07:54 PM] actionslacks#4072
My inner voice told me to buy bch a month ago. I put it on mute for now.

[24-Nov-18 08:14 PM] Cassius#9158
Don't listen to your inner voice. It's overrated. Right now most people's inner voices are telling them to panic sell.

[24-Nov-18 08:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I‚Äôm thinking of buying more tbh

[24-Nov-18 08:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362

watching this series of crashes is like watching a beautiful unicorn get beaten to death by very ugly orcs

BTC won't be able to move up from 1k range

[24-Nov-18 09:50 PM] Alright#0419
something will replace BTC

[24-Nov-18 09:50 PM] BlackJesus#6161
BCH is going to

only real utility is being literally the securest way to store data

[24-Nov-18 09:51 PM] BlackJesus#6161
the war with SV made BCH's misson even clearer nothing ontop of the chain just "work"

[24-Nov-18 09:51 PM] Alright#0419
but that can be said about whatever is the highest hash rate chain

[24-Nov-18 09:51 PM] BlackJesus#6161
they are going for anything topical just purely toward useability as a currency

[24-Nov-18 09:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
what made it big in the first place.

[24-Nov-18 09:52 PM] Alright#0419
Ver less so IMO

[24-Nov-18 09:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
ver i feel is greatly misunderstood and emotionally immature.

[24-Nov-18 09:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
dunno, mang.   Its gonna be hard for BCH ABC/SV (either of them) to drag the reputation of their project back into the realm of the respectable.  And since they are both headed up by madmen who make questionable decisions.... I dunno

[24-Nov-18 09:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
faketoshi is a text book narcissicist

[24-Nov-18 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
Ver is now supporting a chain that is *entirely* centralized around a single entity though

[24-Nov-18 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
so lost a tonne of respect for him

[24-Nov-18 09:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
It isn't

[24-Nov-18 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
it is

[24-Nov-18 09:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
bitcoin unlimited released their new client

[24-Nov-18 09:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
with isupport for both SV chains and ABC chains

[24-Nov-18 09:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
they are neutral

[24-Nov-18 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
Got rid of the max reorg depth bs?

[24-Nov-18 09:54 PM] BlackJesus#6161
yup

[24-Nov-18 09:54 PM] Alright#0419
and centralized checkpoints?

[24-Nov-18 09:54 PM] BlackJesus#6161
they closed the reorg loophole with a checkpoint

[24-Nov-18 09:54 PM] Alright#0419
lol

[24-Nov-18 09:54 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Do only certain nodes get to make the checkpoints

[24-Nov-18 09:54 PM] Alright#0419
Imagine if KMD had a single notary node deciding what is the true chain

[24-Nov-18 09:54 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm prtetty sure the checkpoints happen arbitralrilty based on some kind of math

[24-Nov-18 09:54 PM] Alright#0419
that is what bitcoin.com is doing with ABC right now

[24-Nov-18 09:54 PM] PHBA2061#2530
how about Komodo rename back to Bitcoin Dark and overtakes both BTC and BCH üòÇ

[24-Nov-18 09:55 PM] BlackJesus#6161

[24-Nov-18 09:55 PM] Alright#0419
POW doesn't matter on ABC anymore

[24-Nov-18 09:55 PM] Alright#0419
longest chain rule no longer applies to ABC

[24-Nov-18 09:55 PM] BlackJesus#6161
it does

[24-Nov-18 09:55 PM] Alright#0419
only "bitcoin.com says this chain is the real chain" rule

[24-Nov-18 09:55 PM] BlackJesus#6161
they had more hashpower and won the hardfork

[24-Nov-18 09:56 PM] BlackJesus#6161

[24-Nov-18 09:56 PM] BlackJesus#6161
4k petabyte

[24-Nov-18 09:56 PM] BlackJesus#6161
about 12% of BTC network hashpower
