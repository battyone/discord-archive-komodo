with such large amounts it isnt as easy as if you only had a few btc worth

[28-May-19 09:26 AM] klein#5233
fair enough, would take time to turn around these positions in illiquid markets

[28-May-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem with ARRR is that there is not way to map it to a normal pubkey

[28-May-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
have you tried selling Ti worth of IOTA OTC?

[28-May-19 09:27 AM] klein#5233
I would have to reconsider my life choices if I ever did

[28-May-19 09:33 AM] cascrypto#8206
IOTA isn't doing to bad and solved their central problem. Do you follow iota development and do you see the potential fotr iot  @jl777c ?

[28-May-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
just following from a distance. it does seem to be doing ok, but maybe KMD has more room to grow

[28-May-19 09:35 AM] cascrypto#8206
Nice answer I like

[28-May-19 09:57 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
KMD at it's lowest, Arrr at it's highest, time to convert 😛

[28-May-19 10:02 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
any command to get all private keys?

[28-May-19 10:03 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Closest thing i have is list.json which has all 64 private key pubkey and pubadd but its a pain to delete everything except priv keys

[28-May-19 10:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Why not send everything to 1 address then get dumpprivkey on that address?

[28-May-19 10:08 AM] CHMEX#0686

This is the easiest way to claim rewards on your ledger s without a app you need to download.

I have reduced the claim fee from 5% of claimed rewards to 0.5% which is a 90% reduction for the next month or so (this will be set in a few hours). Fees collected are used for development funds to build more apps for Komodo and related coins.

Tell your friends @Hollowman9000

With massive innovation of changing N,K values, nobody knows how high this will moon

[28-May-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
The innovation, it's hard to calculate

[28-May-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
Changing address formats!!!!! Light speed ahead of the competition (ZCL), lol

[28-May-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
Zcash Foundation and company are helping this pump, they see it as a way to increase their holdings

[28-May-19 12:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
They are providing devs and servers and much grease to many wheels

[28-May-19 12:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
But for what end? To dump it?

[28-May-19 12:58 PM] gcharang#6833

[28-May-19 12:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
Everybody knows how well Zcash plays with other kids in the sandbox

[28-May-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
wait, the zcash foundation is helping ycash?

[28-May-19 12:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
Yes

[28-May-19 12:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
Zooko himself has promised support

[28-May-19 12:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
And Zcash devs are busy helping them now, running testnet seeds and such

[28-May-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
and ycash is basically a clone with no devs?

[28-May-19 12:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
This all increases the wealth via the ZEC FR going up

[28-May-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
ycash has FR?

[28-May-19 01:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
Yes

[28-May-19 01:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
5% FR instead of ZEC's

[28-May-19 01:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
5% in perpetuity

[28-May-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
going to fund what?

[28-May-19 01:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is a single dev working on YEC as far as I can see, with no blockchain experience at all

[28-May-19 01:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
none at all

[28-May-19 01:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
but he does seem to know C++

[28-May-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
what is going on? very strange, is zcash so desperate for more funds?

[28-May-19 01:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes

[28-May-19 01:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
It seems that spending ~1M USD/month thru a bear market has put them on the ropes

[28-May-19 01:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
anything that helps their financial situation seems to be fair game at this point. Zcash is helping Ycash to come into existence, because all ZEC owners get free YEC. But the people creating YEC don't quite understand the relationship they are in with ZEC

[28-May-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
which is?

[28-May-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
donkey

[28-May-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
expendable tool

[28-May-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
for 5% maybe they dont care?

[28-May-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and this is why ZEC is pumping?

[28-May-19 01:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
The website for YEC was released a few hours ago and almost immediately the price of ZEC jumped, almost at the exact same times

[28-May-19 01:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
That is the only thing I can make of it. I saw mention on Twitter, that tipped me off

[28-May-19 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
crazy. how much do they think yec is going to trade for?

[28-May-19 01:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
This is the ZCL/BTCP thing all over again, but it's a chainfork of ZEC. So ZEC price will pump and dump

[28-May-19 01:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
Some people paid $400 for ZCL to get some BTCP, which is now worth $2

[28-May-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810

`just another lemming money-grab`

[28-May-19 01:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
Yes, everybody will make money for a while, even incompetent/bad/lazy/evil people.

[28-May-19 01:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
YEC is launching with 192,7 params and no dpow, so it will be VERY susceptible to 51% attacks and will be controlled by FPGAs

[28-May-19 01:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 which makes that statement soooo funny 😅

[28-May-19 01:09 PM] dukeleto#7326

It's somewhat bizarre

[28-May-19 01:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
they think they will be added to all the exchanges of the world for free, on account of their big brother Zcash

[28-May-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe zooko will pay for the listings

[28-May-19 01:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c it probably makes a lot of financial sense for zcash people to pay listing fees so they can dump coins on many exchanges

[28-May-19 01:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
Imagine how much ZEC FR will want to be sold when the first exchange supports YEC

[28-May-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
but what about the massive contribution to the fpga community?

[28-May-19 01:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
zetheron customers will be so happy

[28-May-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems like another VBK situation, but with zcash behind it, who knows

[28-May-19 01:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
I feel confident to say that Zcash did not originate Ycash, that is not the case

[28-May-19 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
But Zcash realized quickly that Ycash was very good for their bottom line, even if it looks like a "fight" in marketing world

[28-May-19 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
Ycash was started by Howard Loo, who also created the foundation, and is an old ZEC miner: https://github.com/hloo

I love that the "party line" is always "we love GPUs and want them back" and they always pick some settings that literally disallows about 50 million GPUs that were specifically purchased for mining
