I love to see how positive JL is about pirate

[25-Jun-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
the more regulations they make, the more it seems to motivate me for some reason

Not a CC or network guy

normal crosschain migrate would become an allowed exemption, but this is not needed for some years, no need to worry about it for now

[25-Jun-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
zatomic swaps much much more important

[25-Jun-19 03:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fair enough

Some negative from me

[25-Jun-19 03:49 PM] coingirl87#6489
I will be never positive again

[25-Jun-19 03:51 PM] coingirl87#6489
From #43 ro #63 on cmc in 2 weeks...not because of bitcoin dominance...there must be other reasons

No seriously

[25-Jun-19 03:52 PM] coingirl87#6489
Dont make jokes about that

[25-Jun-19 03:52 PM] c2k#4915
Anyone tracking how much KMD volume has traded since the security breach? Maybe that will provide some hints as to when the thief is near finished

[25-Jun-19 03:53 PM] coingirl87#6489
I am searching for a logic reason

[25-Jun-19 03:53 PM] coingirl87#6489
Because tech from kmd goes up and price down

[25-Jun-19 03:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It‚Äôs a runaway cycle, price dumps, less buy orders due to loss of confidence, harder press down until actual support is found

[25-Jun-19 03:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Set some buys and average it out

Hacker could be one but i dont think, that hacker dump the coins after this perfect scam

[25-Jun-19 03:54 PM] c2k#4915
why wouldnt he/she

[25-Jun-19 03:55 PM] tolken#2655
Perfect?  üòâ

[25-Jun-19 03:55 PM] c2k#4915
i think any thief looks to unload their stolen goods fairly quickly...and discretely

[25-Jun-19 03:55 PM] coingirl87#6489
Because hack was very organized

[25-Jun-19 03:56 PM] coingirl87#6489
So if i were the hacker i would wait until    dex release or another big event

[25-Jun-19 03:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôm waiting for arrr parity then I‚Äôll cycle some back into KMD

[25-Jun-19 03:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Either arrr to 11k sats or KMD to 2300 sats

[25-Jun-19 03:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
2300 sats you‚Äôll have some support from me

[25-Jun-19 03:59 PM] c2k#4915
there seems to be a decent amount of KMD/BTC activity yesterday as price hit previous lows

[25-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Alexfrog#1338
c2k, many millions of KMD have traded since the hack, and it was only 700k KMD, so the thief couldve easily already dumped everything

[25-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Buy order depth on binance is thin as hell

[25-Jun-19 04:01 PM] coingirl87#6489
Thats good?

[25-Jun-19 04:02 PM] c2k#4915
true Alexfrog. just trying to feel for a bottom. like Hollowman said...average down. i started last night

[25-Jun-19 04:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If not having the ability to sustain a heavy dump without plummeting massively in sat price is good

[25-Jun-19 04:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then yes

[25-Jun-19 04:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It is good

[25-Jun-19 04:05 PM] Alexfrog#1338
ive been averaging down since 30k üò¶

BTC broke 11.500 on Binance for a few seconds.

[25-Jun-19 04:34 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Some TA-guys think that is a important resistance, we will see about that

Do we have any precedent of that price?

[25-Jun-19 07:55 PM] coingirl87#6489
Dont know ...only know that at beginning  dex was sold for more than 30kmd on barter dex

[25-Jun-19 07:56 PM] coingirl87#6489
But there is no statistic on dexstats.info anymore

[25-Jun-19 08:03 PM] Oszy#5734

[25-Jun-19 08:19 PM] allbits#5898
There's quite a few bids for dex on barterlly for 10 kmd. And a new one for 11 kmd. No takers so far. Asks for 30+

[25-Jun-19 08:20 PM] tolken#2655

[25-Jun-19 08:22 PM] Oszy#5734
anyone tried crypto.com usd-kmd buy?

[25-Jun-19 08:29 PM] jansako#3330
Coinexchange has a market for both SN & DEX, the buy side is mighty thin but it could be  a place for price discovery, at least until AtomicDex lanuches & DEX goes back to the 30-40 KMD range...
