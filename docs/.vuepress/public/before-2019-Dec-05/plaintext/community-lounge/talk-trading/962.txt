nice

[23-Jul-19 06:41 PM] richardt#2807
Plenty of people gave up on BTC or crypto in general after each of the previous bubbles.  The ones that were persistent and stuck around won/will win ultimately

[23-Jul-19 06:41 PM] 차미숙#8912
Yeah it's hard to stick to btc

[23-Jul-19 06:41 PM] 차미숙#8912
It's boring

[23-Jul-19 06:41 PM] 차미숙#8912
1000x is so much better aint it

[23-Jul-19 06:41 PM] Markus#5464
kmd is even more boring....price doesnt move at all

[23-Jul-19 06:42 PM] 차미숙#8912
It's basically stablecoin

[23-Jul-19 06:42 PM] richardt#2807
KMD price use to be much more exciting 😄

[23-Jul-19 06:42 PM] 차미숙#8912
Why issue tether when we have already accomplished it

[23-Jul-19 06:43 PM] Markus#5464
so i basically just hodl my kmd now in a ledger and trade bitcoin leveraged on bitmex, pretty much only thing u can do atm

[23-Jul-19 06:43 PM] Markus#5464
before u could atleast swing trade kmd abit between like 12k and 15k

[23-Jul-19 06:43 PM] Markus#5464
now not even that

[23-Jul-19 06:44 PM] 차미숙#8912
I think right now the best strategy is to mine us dollars

[23-Jul-19 06:44 PM] 차미숙#8912
And then go all in crypto lol

[23-Jul-19 06:44 PM] richardt#2807
Back in the day, that Binance announcement would have sent it 5x-10x

[23-Jul-19 06:44 PM] 차미숙#8912
10x per announcement is like pre-lisk era

[23-Jul-19 06:45 PM] 차미숙#8912
Lisk era is about 7x

[23-Jul-19 06:47 PM] richardt#2807
missing those days

Gone with the wind

Now you have to play with hand grenades to win big like that

Caglio is on the hunt for a greencard

[23-Jul-19 07:04 PM] Caglio#3337
However I could use her pesos

[23-Jul-19 07:07 PM] Andersen#8337
She is  European  :abusedsmily:

[23-Jul-19 07:11 PM] Caglio#3337
Oh

[23-Jul-19 07:12 PM] Caglio#3337
I need greencard, still, if she is rich enough I wont need greencard, I can be happy even without fulfilling my lifelong dream of flipping burgers in USA

[23-Jul-19 07:16 PM] Andersen#8337
Are  you  sure ? people running  out USSA  ,  it's  mordor  now  :troll_thuglife:

Anyone use CoinBene? Any comment on it and is KYC required there?

[23-Jul-19 07:45 PM] richardt#2807
Never used it, but wouldn't recommend it

[23-Jul-19 07:48 PM] actionslacks#4072
coinbene is usable. their order books and  interface is a bit off putting and seems to enable a lot of fake volume.

[23-Jul-19 07:48 PM] actionslacks#4072
no kyc

[23-Jul-19 07:54 PM] Markus#5464
would never use

Memba when u used to join shitcoin telegrams and the admins would say "we have partnership under NDA we cant announce yet" and you would believe those muppets and fomo buy bags?

Then those bags would go -90% because it wasn't true.

Junkie membas.

[23-Jul-19 07:58 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Literally DAXT, exit scammed late november but the telegram was getting rowdy so they came in claiming someone was to invest money, but NDA, yada yada, end of story we're mid July and theres no investment lol

(3/4) If John misses his next check-in, events will be set into motion that I cannot prevent once they have begun.  John has secreted data with individuals across the world. I know neither their identities or locations. They will release their payloads if John goes missing.

smart people will seek better solutions "outside the scope of the law" if they do that and all it will do is leave a shitton of unsecured "normal" folks
