`Talking shit is very easy. Anyone can do that `
yes, you're a perfect example of that being true

[07-Apr-19 10:24 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
Yep. As you say dude. I'm a very polite guy. You on the other hand...hmm.. Internet!😂 🤦

[07-Apr-19 10:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm far more interested in facts than PC culture

[07-Apr-19 10:28 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
Yep. Your facts are 7%=5000 from a total of 4000(100%). Anyway I think we are also spaming in the wrong channel. So see you around smart guy!

[07-Apr-19 10:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`You blame vbk for the 100+ fee.`
I'm **still** waiting for you to show me where I did that....

Kill it with fire

[07-Apr-19 11:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It’s the only way to be sure.

[07-Apr-19 11:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I’m good with it

[07-Apr-19 11:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Send it

[07-Apr-19 11:29 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
I didn't banned you. So I won't unban you

[07-Apr-19 11:31 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
I think you were ban cuz too much span on open-source. You might wanna DM Tim for that or create a new account.

[07-Apr-19 11:35 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
Ehh.

[07-Apr-19 11:37 PM] PHBA2061#2530
what if the one who banned Emmanuel keep denying then ? if he didn't violate the rules then any mod can unban him right ?

[07-Apr-19 11:40 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
Anything in the world can be done in a better way @Deleted User .

[07-Apr-19 11:40 PM] strugglebus#2266
Emmanuel I got banned too, I am pretty sure it was Shiggidy

[07-Apr-19 11:40 PM] strugglebus#2266
I was in there the same day you were, I asked if the devs were able to sell on trex with the IEO people

{Reactions}
🤦 

[07-Apr-19 11:40 PM] strugglebus#2266
and boom banned

[07-Apr-19 11:45 PM] PHBA2061#2530
shiggidy has admin role, is he a member of  Veriblock team ?

[07-Apr-19 11:47 PM] strugglebus#2266
no, he is an admin or part of most shitcoins he gets "involved" in. my knowledge and experience of him is that hes extremely shady and involved in price manipulation big time. id take nothing that he says about a project and its merits at face value ever.

[07-Apr-19 11:48 PM] strugglebus#2266
vbk is quite a change from what he is usually involved in, which is the shittest of the shittest shitcoins. he gets in early and manipulates prices using alts/friends and different tactics.

[07-Apr-19 11:48 PM] PHBA2061#2530
well, I could also guess what kind of person he is through his tweets  ...

[07-Apr-19 11:50 PM] PHBA2061#2530
meanwhile, there is a ComputerJenny in Veriblock Discord right now who keep asking questions and they think it's CG in disguise 😂

I have a theory as to why there have been these 20% pumps in larger cap alts

[08-Apr-19 02:39 AM] klein#5233
some of these coins were showing weakness in and making lower lows in november december

[08-Apr-19 02:40 AM] klein#5233
some coins where showing strength and bucked the trend

[08-Apr-19 02:41 AM] klein#5233
then we had this move up  recently

[08-Apr-19 02:41 AM] klein#5233
then there was these lagging big moves

[08-Apr-19 02:41 AM] klein#5233
probably from what I think is these dumb money crypto funds

[08-Apr-19 02:43 AM] klein#5233
they are just piling in after the fact

[08-Apr-19 03:47 AM] Sherdogz#6731
It feels like deja vu to me how my btc worth is decreasing. And it always seem to happen in the weekends with low volume 😂

someone needs to invent a coin that you cant dump.  if you sell it after a drop, it just deletes your coins 😄

I distinctly remember @crunchycat boistering about coming back when VBK sourcecode has been disclosed- how about that?
seems to have forgotten about that in his zeal

[08-Apr-19 06:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Btc moving up?

[08-Apr-19 06:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hasnt been disclosed @LocoMB

[08-Apr-19 06:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Deposits on bittrex arent even open yet

[08-Apr-19 06:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So now that market is just the ieo buyers cirlclejerking and trading amongst themselves

[08-Apr-19 06:43 AM] LocoMB#8593
yeah I know- so why is @crunchycat prancing around here, contrary to his claim?

[08-Apr-19 06:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Want to give insiders the chance to dump before you let the testnet miners dump the premine 😃

[08-Apr-19 06:45 AM] LocoMB#8593
a word of advice for @crunchycat  - iirc you said you are not a technical guy- which means that you are in well over your head, and when VBK crashes and burns, you will crash and burn with it (meaning, your poopy online avatar with the name, and the money you invested) - so it would be advisable to try to at least understand the basic technical features of the platforms involved..
is it looks right now, you are nothing but an overzealous acolyte burning himself on a trashy project. while nobody can prevent you from hitting yourself on the head with a hammer, you should understand that that the noise you are making while doing that is getting  mightily on peoples nerves that know better [ _refrains with superhuman strength from plastering two rows of monkey emos_ ]

interesting times for KMD, we could retest 200 ma if we fall further

[08-Apr-19 10:12 AM] Keppie#5156
I'm eyeing our old trendline or s/r 22k sats

[08-Apr-19 10:13 AM] Markus#5464
im wondering how kmd will react if btc decides to crash to 4.2k

[08-Apr-19 10:14 AM] Markus#5464
i quess time will tell cause to me btc is due for a major correction, i personally hope for 3.8k but nobody knows obviously

[08-Apr-19 10:16 AM] Keppie#5156
Think we'll see 5500 first

[08-Apr-19 10:17 AM] Markus#5464
what make u think it will go to 5500

we never closed above this moving average

[08-Apr-19 10:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Week opened below the weekly 8/41 convergence.

[08-Apr-19 10:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
A retest of the weekly 20sma seems most probable

[08-Apr-19 10:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that is around 21k sats.

[08-Apr-19 10:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
doesnt mean the bigger trend changed imo

[08-Apr-19 10:44 AM] Markus#5464
ye ofc it didnt...dont think we will break below it...if we do it will just wick

is bittrex deposits open for the miners yet?

1300 sats price on https://bitmesh.com/exchange?market=btc_vbk#/

Bittrex still closed @jl777c

[08-Apr-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, I can deduce that from the 1300 v 1700 price diffrence. such a large arbitrage doesnt last long, unless people are not able to deposit

when you pay retail at IEO and the IEO sites says that discounts are given OTC to volume buyers.... it seems silly to volume buy at retail, just buy at 1500 sats OTC instead of retail at 2500
