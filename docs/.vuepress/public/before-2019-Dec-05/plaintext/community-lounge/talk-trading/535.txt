also the message that the gov is sending to journalist

If he survived 7 years in the embassy, why would he not survive prison?

[11-Apr-19 09:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Isnt it kind of the same to be be stuck for years in a room?

[11-Apr-19 09:47 PM] Markus#5464
5 years prison, divide that by half for behaving xD

[11-Apr-19 09:48 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
prison has more random characters and factors in play

[11-Apr-19 09:48 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
but that is just me putting my tin foil hat on 😄

[11-Apr-19 09:50 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
watching too many prison break episodes

[11-Apr-19 09:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Probably pay the AB to protect him like Gotti did

[11-Apr-19 09:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
In fact I would expect them to approach assange’s people

[11-Apr-19 09:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Pay us to protect or else, we aren’t being nice by offering

[11-Apr-19 10:34 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
“If he survived 7 years in the embassy, why would he not survive prison?”    In the embassy you don’t have to worry about dropping the soap and some dude trying to bust your cheeks.  Also just general inmate violence,  criminal code of conduct and asshole guards.

[11-Apr-19 11:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah, i understand the fact that prison is much worse. But i refer more to the uncertainty. And also, trump is in power, not hillary. With hillary it would have been much much worse for him. @polycryptoblog

[11-Apr-19 11:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
With trumo i think it will stay simple conspiracy charges with minimum sentence... or at least thst is what i hope for.

`He is not american, why should be judged by the american government in the first place?`
Because governmental overreach is what we do? Why do you think the US has been in a "war on terror" for the last 3 decades?

[11-Apr-19 11:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Enduring Freedom` was supposed to be "long lasting" meaning of "enduring", but the truth is those poor people have had to *endure* the US's "shield" and "storm" ever since '91

[11-Apr-19 11:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
But, what the hell, in '45 we killed 200k people in Japan so that China could have some islands, so I don't know why anyone expects anything different

[11-Apr-19 11:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_gets off his soapbox now_

[12-Apr-19 12:00 AM] meatspoon#7860
Dont you love freedom and democracy?  We are delivering it at gunpoint to everyone wether they like it or not.  It’s the American way.

[12-Apr-19 12:09 AM] meatspoon#7860
In all seriousness, ‘Murica needs to get its beak out of... everything.  It’s happening slowly. The progressives and the Fed have hollowed out the economy and it shouldn’t be too many years before American hegemony fades.

[12-Apr-19 12:10 AM] meatspoon#7860
And cryptos in general should help to erode the USD’s status as a world reserve currency.

[12-Apr-19 12:22 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
There was that whole Pearl Harbor thing and all

[12-Apr-19 12:23 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[12-Apr-19 12:28 AM] meatspoon#7860
I am easy to predict politically, Genie. Non aggression principle here. OG libertarian.

[12-Apr-19 12:30 AM] meatspoon#7860
Hollow, Peal Harbor is interesting. Lots of evidence suggests we knew of it in advance and wanted to be vulnerable to justify our involvement in the war.  Politicians sold out our military... who woulda thunk it?

[12-Apr-19 12:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`There was that whole Pearl Harbor thing and all`
The short answer is that's what happens when we decided that we get to decide who gets what land that isn't ours to decide about because it benefits our trade routes

[12-Apr-19 12:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_wonders why we don't have a #PoliticalQuagmire channel_

[12-Apr-19 12:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The reason why the US is going after him is because of the Iraq war logs and diplomatic cables , allegedly helped Chelsea manning crack a password.  Seems like a trumped up charge

[12-Apr-19 12:55 AM] ryman112#0068
We were warned about the military industrial complex.
WW1 sinking of the lusitania.....people were warned by the german embassy to not board the ship because it would be fired upon.  Well it sank we in war.
WW2 pearl harbor....we knew but ignored because to get a population to support a war they gotta be personally pissed off.
Vietnam was never meant to be won but sustained
The Gulf of Tonkin incident...lol look that up.

[12-Apr-19 12:59 AM] ryman112#0068
We put Saddam in power in Iraq and he wanted to change the currency the oil was sold with away from the American dollar..  So guess what he had to go.  
Hell we trained the Taliban to fight the Russians.....guess that bit us in the ass lol.

If you notice war now days is a permanent thing thats why its a war on terrorism.  There will always be terrorists and therefore always war.  See you always have to have a boogie man to justify the encroachment of peoples rights.

assange dumping btc lol people always trying to look for an answer

[12-Apr-19 01:05 AM] meatspoon#7860
I knew I liked @ryman112 for a good reason.

[12-Apr-19 01:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OMG BTC dumped for 5 minutes! THE END IS NEIGH!

[12-Apr-19 01:06 AM] klein#5233
yeah how about it went straight up

[12-Apr-19 01:06 AM] klein#5233
a pull back is normal

[12-Apr-19 01:06 AM] klein#5233
would also be an incredible stupid thing to do

[12-Apr-19 01:06 AM] klein#5233
dump everything leaves you at risk to exchanges

[12-Apr-19 01:07 AM] klein#5233
of funds being frozen

[12-Apr-19 01:09 AM] klein#5233
if they would even interact with exchanges to begin with

[12-Apr-19 01:09 AM] klein#5233
why risk it

[12-Apr-19 01:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What I learn reading comments in the space as a whole:
view on adoption extends infinitely and is always 🦄s and 🌈s about "replacing fiat"
view on price movement is myopic and from minute to minute is either 🌈s or 😭s

[12-Apr-19 01:13 AM] klein#5233
well I've been buying at these lows

[12-Apr-19 01:14 AM] klein#5233
still seems like normal pull back to me

[12-Apr-19 01:14 AM] klein#5233

“The term “bug” was first used by Thomas Edison back in the 1870’s!  However, the term was popularized in the 1940’s when engineers found an actual moth stuck in the hardware of an early computer, causing a short circuit.  Both the log book in which the error was reported and the moth are now part of the Smithsonian Museum of American History”

#kmdlabs 😛

[12-Apr-19 02:55 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
For general c/c++/whatever type stuff

[12-Apr-19 02:55 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Rolling through learncpp.com now

[12-Apr-19 02:56 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Channel would be absolute beginner to advanced

[12-Apr-19 02:56 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Any and all code type questions

[12-Apr-19 02:58 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
From where to get started to “why won’t my ‘hello world’ compile” to “my motor controller subroutine is malfunctioning at point x”

[12-Apr-19 02:58 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
You get the idea

[12-Apr-19 03:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@jl777c thoughts?

[12-Apr-19 03:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or whoever admins the discord

[12-Apr-19 03:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
would like that kinda channel for myself as well mate

[12-Apr-19 03:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but then again I think stackoverflow covers all such things

[12-Apr-19 03:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so why limit it to just here?

[12-Apr-19 03:03 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just a thought

[12-Apr-19 03:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and if it's in relation to the komodo code stuff, then there are 2 channels

[12-Apr-19 03:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
#ask-a-question #ask-jl777

[12-Apr-19 03:04 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not excluding stackoverflow, just a looser environment, more crypto related people around

[12-Apr-19 03:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yea, I think I get it what you sayin

[12-Apr-19 03:04 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
More real-time I guess

[12-Apr-19 03:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
true

[12-Apr-19 03:05 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
“Or you could try the Komodo discord, they have an active learning to code community there”

[12-Apr-19 03:05 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

🙂

[12-Apr-19 03:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
best this IMO is to find some of james code in either iguana or komodod that does something similar and use it as an example. I managed to learn extremly quickly with this method, combined with stack overflow of course 😉

[12-Apr-19 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
time consuming though... lots and lots of reading

[12-Apr-19 03:08 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@blackjok3r does not want #learntocode because his mentions will be BTFO

[12-Apr-19 03:08 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

@blackjok3r yes, I've been going through iguana code after few lessons on C language

[12-Apr-19 03:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
they make a lot sense after C basics cleared

still making progress on my C language learning path

[12-Apr-19 03:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
After jumbling through different learning materials online, videos, books, the only reliable and the best resource I say is "The C Programming Language" book.

[12-Apr-19 03:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If anyone here need these C/C++ ebooks, have have a good bunch of them

[12-Apr-19 03:13 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I kicked my journey off with codecademy.com

[12-Apr-19 03:13 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
On to learncpp.com

[12-Apr-19 03:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
everyone has their own way of learning mate, whatever gives you most understanding on whatever subject, with whatever way, just do that

[12-Apr-19 03:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I prefer to just jump in, usually get very frsustrating fast though. Not a learning method for everyone.. There have been a few times I amlost rage quit on many projects when getting stuck due to no required skils... But a few days away is usually enough to think of solution. and come back and work it out. There is always a solution to be found. Usually it already exists somwhere, just need to find it lol. I still find myself going back and copy psting code I wrote before rather than try to figure out how to write it again. Most of what I do is really taking other peices of code and plaing them together liek a puzzle to do magic 😂

[12-Apr-19 03:14 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
With cpp.sh (website) as a good online compiler for testing

[12-Apr-19 03:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the only key to it is being persistent to what you are on.
keep it regular, and make it a habit to learn new everyday on that subject.

💯 

[12-Apr-19 03:15 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
But to have a local outlet for all of the above posted and peers in the industry available

[12-Apr-19 03:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Very good advice

[12-Apr-19 03:15 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I think #learntocode could be valuable

[12-Apr-19 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It would help yes... maybe a pin wioth some common materials that are always reccomended by people and thigns liek that.

[12-Apr-19 03:16 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Agreed
