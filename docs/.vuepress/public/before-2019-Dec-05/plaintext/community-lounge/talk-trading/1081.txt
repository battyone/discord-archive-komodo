If you are not the dude pushing it on the streets

[17-Aug-19 05:43 PM] LocoMB#8593
oth, who wants to get hounded around the world like those busloads of Ponzi scammers and exchange con rtists that have been dragged to crypto like horseflies to a pile of dung?

[17-Aug-19 05:43 PM] Caglio#3337
I guess ones that supply you with stuff earn a nice buck

[17-Aug-19 05:43 PM] LocoMB#8593
maybe there is  a small niche for medium sized drug trades- but above a certain level, you get spooks invovled, and that is very dangerous

[17-Aug-19 05:44 PM] Markus#5464
did u guys read of the chinese ponzi scamming 10 million investors?

[17-Aug-19 05:44 PM] LocoMB#8593
street level pushers?!?! peons

[17-Aug-19 05:44 PM] LocoMB#8593
yeah that .. what was it? PlusToken?

[17-Aug-19 05:44 PM] Markus#5464
Yea

[17-Aug-19 05:44 PM] LocoMB#8593
dunno- their names and mugshots are all over the world

[17-Aug-19 05:44 PM] Caglio#3337
lol @ peons

[17-Aug-19 05:45 PM] Markus#5464
idk i never heard of PlusToken

[17-Aug-19 05:45 PM] LocoMB#8593
me neitehr, until now

[17-Aug-19 05:45 PM] LocoMB#8593
but- I would not feel very comfortable knwoing that 10000s of really angry people are after me-

[17-Aug-19 05:45 PM] Markus#5464
but damn over 70k btc and 850k eth

[17-Aug-19 05:45 PM] LocoMB#8593
maybe that is just me though

[17-Aug-19 05:45 PM] Markus#5464
thats huge

[17-Aug-19 05:46 PM] LocoMB#8593
it is huge- and it may get some of them killed

[17-Aug-19 05:46 PM] LocoMB#8593
so now they have to look over their shoulders for the next 30 years or so

[17-Aug-19 05:46 PM] LocoMB#8593
maybe they are cool with it, and have perfect plans for that, I dont know

[17-Aug-19 05:46 PM] Markus#5464
well im sure there have been unknown heads of the operation nobody rly knows about

[17-Aug-19 05:47 PM] Markus#5464
holding the priv keys

[17-Aug-19 05:47 PM] LocoMB#8593
yes, those guys are having a chucke right now- they won't laugh alll the way to the bank, because crypto... but they feel mighty smug now

[17-Aug-19 05:48 PM] LocoMB#8593
but- have there really been unknown heads of the ops? or are they all identified?

[17-Aug-19 05:48 PM] LocoMB#8593
so what if chinese police waterboards the dupes that were caught and they spit out names?

[17-Aug-19 05:48 PM] Markus#5464
dont know but pretty sure there is ppl who are not identified, there have to be

[17-Aug-19 05:49 PM] Markus#5464
Who knows maybe its ran by ppl who were involved in Bitconnect

[17-Aug-19 05:50 PM] LocoMB#8593
still, not worth the risk- what about that fat bulgarian pseudo- lawyer from OneCoin?

[17-Aug-19 05:50 PM] LocoMB#8593
that fat slut is hounded right now - maybe a few in the circle managed to escape with some spoils

[17-Aug-19 05:51 PM] Markus#5464
No idea didnt follow that üòÑ

[17-Aug-19 05:51 PM] LocoMB#8593
yet another Ponzi

[17-Aug-19 05:52 PM] Markus#5464
But from what i read

[17-Aug-19 05:52 PM] Markus#5464
it started with one coin then bitconnect and then regal coin

[17-Aug-19 05:52 PM] LocoMB#8593

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneCoin
OneCoin
OneCoin is a Ponzi scheme promoted as a cryptocoin with a private blockchain, by offshore companies OneCoin Ltd (Dubai) and OneLife Network Ltd (Belize), both founded by Ruja Ignatova in concert with Sebastian Greenwood. OneCoin  is considered a Ponzi scheme, both due to its ...

[17-Aug-19 05:52 PM] Caglio#3337
Loco you are smart guy

[17-Aug-19 05:52 PM] Caglio#3337
They will probably got murdered

[17-Aug-19 05:52 PM] Caglio#3337
at least some of them

[17-Aug-19 05:53 PM] LocoMB#8593
didnt work for most of them:
Ruja Ignatova disappeared in 2017 and was replaced by her brother Konstantin Ignatov near the time a secret US warrant was filed for her arrest. The majority of the top leaders have now disappeared or have been arrested. Konstantin Ignatov was arrested in March 2019[7] and Sebastian Greenwood in 2018.[8]

[17-Aug-19 05:53 PM] LocoMB#8593
yes, and I am sure that this is not the kind of activity you were invovled in

[17-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Caglio#3337
Nope

[17-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Markus#5464
this was last year

[17-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Markus#5464
Divyesh Darji, the Indian head of BitConnect and believed to be a core promoter of the scheme, has reportedly been arrested by the Gujarat Criminal Investigation Department (CID) after arriving in Dubai on his way from Ahmedabad

[17-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Markus#5464
its interesting tho its saying "indian head", that does not mean he is head of bitconnect itself just a country head promoter

[17-Aug-19 05:56 PM] Caglio#3337
Scams are interesting

[17-Aug-19 05:56 PM] Caglio#3337
I would probably earn more by scamming people out of their money

[17-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Caglio#3337
then I did with just holding ( :

[17-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Markus#5464
Bitcoin having a hard time atm it looks like

[17-Aug-19 05:58 PM] LocoMB#8593
yeah crypto has turned into an elaborate waiting game for everybody- 2017 is over

[17-Aug-19 05:59 PM] Markus#5464
u will see big spikes in bitcoin but i dont think anytime soon

[17-Aug-19 06:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
yes, and a few select alts.. (KMD included, I hope) in any case, I belive that KMD has the potential, n contrast to most others

[17-Aug-19 06:00 PM] Markus#5464
KMD will be one yes, i dont see why

[17-Aug-19 06:00 PM] Markus#5464
pretty confident about saying that it will

[17-Aug-19 06:01 PM] LocoMB#8593
KMD tech is way better than ETH, but hey- marketing ü§° VHS vs BETA and all that

[17-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Markus#5464
nothing wrong with marketing, but considering the team size it is quite good its not a easy part

[17-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Markus#5464
ppl will disagree

[17-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Markus#5464
but u have to understand what is required

[17-Aug-19 06:02 PM] LocoMB#8593
yes, given the gargantuan hype that ETH is producing it is remarkably little what comes out

[17-Aug-19 06:02 PM] Markus#5464
I think its not so necessary to compare other cryptos with KMD

[17-Aug-19 06:03 PM] Markus#5464
KMD is on its own lvl, u cant compare it with anything else

[17-Aug-19 06:03 PM] LocoMB#8593
well- there are functionalities that can be compared

[17-Aug-19 06:03 PM] Markus#5464
Yes sure

[17-Aug-19 06:03 PM] Markus#5464
but overall no

[17-Aug-19 06:06 PM] LocoMB#8593
damn! I slowly realized ocer the last year that staying glued to the screen doe _not_ make it develop faster- Cheers!

[17-Aug-19 06:13 PM] Caglio#3337
This talk took quick turn from stealing gin in supermarkets, to ethereum marketing

[17-Aug-19 06:17 PM] Markus#5464
Yes for sure

[17-Aug-19 09:04 PM] Andersen#8337

Have a watch of that if anyone has any doubts. We are playing a infinite game, whilst others are playing a finite game. They may be winning now in terms of price and awareness but we will outlast. @jl777c  thought you might find this interesting.

[17-Aug-19 09:51 PM] Markus#5464
maybe that is JLs plan?

[17-Aug-19 09:51 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes seems to fit in line with it

[17-Aug-19 09:52 PM] Markus#5464
üëå

[17-Aug-19 09:52 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We just have someone that says it in such a manner that @Caglio might understand

[17-Aug-19 09:53 PM] hyperDEX#6586
One thing that we should do though is have a vision statement. Something along the lines of restoring universal freedoms through technology etc...

[17-Aug-19 09:53 PM] Markus#5464
Caglio knows whats up deep inside its just the little devil kicking in reminding him what price he paid

[17-Aug-19 09:53 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Once we have a vision statment everyone will know what we are working towards, maybe that will help

[17-Aug-19 09:55 PM] Markus#5464
Well im excited to see what atomicdex and the marketmaker bot will do, can be pretty damn interesting

[17-Aug-19 10:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
atomicDEX is just 1 aspect

[17-Aug-19 10:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The other is to get the desktop apps out for people to do more advanced stuff like the market maker

[17-Aug-19 10:04 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the most important goal is usage

[17-Aug-19 10:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
There are game theory aspects in the built in arb bot that should help us get to where we need to

[17-Aug-19 10:04 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
none of the projects out there has any usage beside trading

[17-Aug-19 10:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
There is a difference between vision and goal

[17-Aug-19 10:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
MM will bring all the CEX liquidity to the DEX and we will over time have more liquidity than all CEX as we will have a combined orderbook

[17-Aug-19 10:07 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Still financial world is the biggest so if even kmd can reach 1% of the world market

[17-Aug-19 10:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We probably wont

[17-Aug-19 10:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But all crypto is less than 1%

[17-Aug-19 10:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
We need to tap into the other money aupplies

[17-Aug-19 10:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But with our global orderboook we will have the best liquidity

[17-Aug-19 10:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Supplies

[17-Aug-19 10:15 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@hyperDEX is this like a sure thing or theory ?

[17-Aug-19 10:15 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Who says all CEX will connect with kmd

[17-Aug-19 10:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Their api

[17-Aug-19 10:17 PM] crumb#2550
DEXes themselves do not need to connect to Komodo DEX. it's the **users of the exchange** that see the obvious arbitrage opportunities and choose make some money

[17-Aug-19 10:18 PM] crumb#2550
'en masse' hopefully ü§û

[17-Aug-19 10:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
What stops exchanges themselfs from using the bot

[17-Aug-19 10:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Can you see this as possibility

[17-Aug-19 10:18 PM] crumb#2550
nothing

[17-Aug-19 10:19 PM] crumb#2550
everything is possible

[17-Aug-19 10:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Exchanges using it is a good thing

[17-Aug-19 10:19 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Probably have themselfs some bots but if yours is superior

[17-Aug-19 10:19 PM] crumb#2550
but some things are more probable than others
