[31-Aug-18 04:33 AM] BlackJesus#6161
what country is that

[31-Aug-18 04:34 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
was it the system or the people in charge?

[31-Aug-18 04:34 AM] BlackJesus#6161
probably the latter

[31-Aug-18 04:37 AM] BlackJesus#6161
it needs to be made autonomous those kinds of systems

[31-Aug-18 04:37 AM] BlackJesus#6161
when theyu are in place they work without human intervention

[31-Aug-18 04:37 AM] BlackJesus#6161
becuause it takes a few corrupt people to bring them down if there arent enough checks and balances in the system to prevent them for doin g damage.

[31-Aug-18 01:43 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
After spending nearly $30k on CHIPS and having to watch the devs try to keep the chain running a year later, I've held off on spending any more on other Komodo side projects.

[31-Aug-18 01:44 PM] xRobeSx#5136
The devs aren't struggling, miners just need to mine.

[31-Aug-18 01:45 PM] xRobeSx#5136
chips will be fine, have hope

[31-Aug-18 01:47 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Been a year. That hope is taking a while to come. The dollar value of the coin isn't what concerns me. I just want it to reliably work.

[31-Aug-18 01:51 PM] xRobeSx#5136
It was said from the beginning that chips wouldn't be used for gambling anytime soon as it all had to be developed still.

[31-Aug-18 01:51 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Mine it. The network is fine then.

[31-Aug-18 01:55 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I'm not a miner and telling me to be one isn't the fix I'm looking for. I knew it would be a long while before CHIPS would have a use outside of just sending coins but now you can hardly do that. Regardless, all my investment is going toward projects outside of Komodo until I see CHIPS working properly again.

[31-Aug-18 02:05 PM] xRobeSx#5136
If there was a real issue that needed fixing I'd agree with you. People just need to care to mine it...

[31-Aug-18 02:05 PM] xRobeSx#5136
No one wants the small block rewards, and just think someone else will mine it for them..

[31-Aug-18 02:06 PM] xRobeSx#5136
decentralized networks require people to come together and participate in keeping it going. Its not a dev issue, its a community/miner problem

[31-Aug-18 02:14 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Then that problem should have been thought of before it came to be. I'm the guy that buys the coins from the miners so I don't have to go through the trouble of setting up miners myself. I am part of the crowd that gives a reason why anyone would mine a coin. I am not about to start renting or buying miners for one coin when I haven't had to in over four years. If it comes to the point that I have to be the one to mine it, then you might well mark the coin up for dead.

[31-Aug-18 02:16 PM] xRobeSx#5136
How can one predict that miners won't want to mine? If you don't want to, try to find others that might want to. I am mining myself trying to help. Others can as well.

[31-Aug-18 02:19 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm just saying decentralized coins and such require the community to do things. We can't just complain it doesn't work and the devs should fix it..

[31-Aug-18 02:19 PM] xRobeSx#5136
If you own CHIPS then you probably have a financial interest in making sure the network stays healthy

[31-Aug-18 02:19 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Even I thought of the blocks giving out little reward a year later and so expected the devs to know that as well and had a plan for it. There wasn't a plan until recently. I convince a few big investors as well to buy into chips so I think I helped at the start at least.

[31-Aug-18 02:28 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I've been in crypto too long to argue this. I'll just write off the investment as a lose and move on. I will still continue to invest with Komodo but any side project is off the books.

[31-Aug-18 02:28 PM] xRobeSx#5136
hah goodluck

[31-Aug-18 02:28 PM] xRobeSx#5136
thanks for your support

[31-Aug-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
CHIPS core code is still being developed, as long as the network is there when the core code is ready, that is what is important
