Maybe I need to step up to 20MM

Oh no not cmc rankings. We should rebrand and make the new supply 50 quadrillion and then we will be number 1. Lets be honest that is the majority of the cmc list. Basically means nothing. Blocktivity gives a better idea of whats valuable.

a "super legit" "shitcoin"? How does that work?

yep, ETH def is Super Ledgit, *&^*&coin

[13-Oct-18 02:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If Vitalik is moving away from ETH, he better put his energy to make a better architecture blockchain project next

I'm 100% allin on the Komodo ecosystem, but good is good and bad is bad no matter who makes/does it

if N@S has been solved where is the live implementation?

[13-Oct-18 03:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
hidden in an NSA bunker?

maybe you can make a nice infographic about it so I can understand

[13-Oct-18 04:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Maybe the kid is just topically confused and is off on his own talking about 'Network-attached storage (NAS)'? 🤷🏼

[13-Oct-18 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
he is supposed to be some ETH braniac?

whaaat

[13-Oct-18 04:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c what I understand is that since he's got no "Live Implimentation" as an answer, an alternative answer which could make a point of his work bigger than others is what he said in next comment.

[13-Oct-18 04:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
totally avoiding live implimentation or not answered.

[13-Oct-18 04:05 PM] bishop#9773
Face, meet palm

[13-Oct-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
so even though there are no known live implementations, its easy to do so its no big deal?

[13-Oct-18 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and this is the unsolved problem that makes PoS not secure

[13-Oct-18 04:07 PM] snowdamn#2414
i thought N@S wasn't a big deal to begin with
wasn't that always used by BTC maximalists and always downplayed by Crypto 2.0 & 3.0?
Verus CC solution deserves recognition, but why overstate  N@S?

[13-Oct-18 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
N@S is a real problem for PoS, just because maximalists harped on it doesnt make it not true

[13-Oct-18 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
do you really believe stuff like nano is safe?

[13-Oct-18 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
PoS is usually better than nano, but some significant issues exist

[13-Oct-18 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
I try to be objective about all consensus methods and evaluate each on their strengths and weaknesses

[13-Oct-18 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
PoS without N@S problem is quite a good solution

[13-Oct-18 04:24 PM] blubbi#0643
whats N@S

[13-Oct-18 04:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
N@S is real and great, the Easter Bunny and Santa told me so!

[13-Oct-18 04:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😡

[13-Oct-18 04:24 PM] snowdamn#2414
cool, if bigger problem than thought Verus CC solution deserves recognition all the more, but Vlad downplaying N@S is pretty common

[13-Oct-18 04:25 PM] blubbi#0643
N@S is the verus solution__

its one of those theoretical problems that maybe nobody every took advantage of, but if there are billions to be made, then maybe they can

[13-Oct-18 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it wont be a problem until it is a total disaster

[13-Oct-18 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
ok for low value chains

[13-Oct-18 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
but not for any chain that needs to secure a lot of value
