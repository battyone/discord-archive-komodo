Dunno, it's weird

[17-Jul-18 02:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I get to keep my BNTN as well

[17-Jul-18 02:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Blocnation, with the expertise of the Komodo Platform, will issue a full refund via airdrop to all purchasers in the coming days. As the Blocnation team still intends to move forward we will like to show our appreciation to supporters by allowing everyone to hold on to their BNTN balances as we will honor them in the future once the utility use case is established and we look to list on exchanges.

We will update the public as to our plans in the coming month after the refund has been completed and all of our following concerns are addressed.

For those who have questions we have prepared a FAQ list to help address general questions.

Thanks for sticking with us!

- Blocnation Team

oh they didn't reach their goal

[17-Jul-18 02:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They reached the goal, but during ICO the market dropped significantly

[17-Jul-18 02:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And their raised funds were worth less

[17-Jul-18 02:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
etc etc

August 10th we will see what the SEC decides on BTC ETF's

[17-Jul-18 05:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362

the 20sma is the brownish line in the center of the bollinger band cloud

[17-Jul-18 07:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
going below it officially marks a bear market

[17-Jul-18 07:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
going above it, officially marks a bull market

Wash rinse repeat

[17-Jul-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
you are either trader that worries about catching the highs and lows, or a hodler that just watches the market for amusement

[17-Jul-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
former might or might not lead to more profits

[17-Jul-18 08:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Second

[17-Jul-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
with the latter as long as long term the price is going up (it is so far) the all is well

[17-Jul-18 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
during manic bull markets sell enough to last through the bear market

If you‚Äôd stop dumping your dev bags we might get somewhere, price-wise

[17-Jul-18 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
other than that just sell crypto as you need fiat

why not be both hodler and trader or swith from time to time üòõ

[17-Jul-18 08:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I tried trader

[17-Jul-18 08:18 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
maybe long term price go up, but in case you need money when it's down might make sense to be a trader too ?

[17-Jul-18 08:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Didn‚Äôt work out

[17-Jul-18 08:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Now I‚Äôm a hodler

[17-Jul-18 08:19 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I believe if there will be a world fin crisis crypto will go down deeply, prob > 50%

[17-Jul-18 08:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Crypto is funds of last resort for fiat needs

[17-Jul-18 08:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
