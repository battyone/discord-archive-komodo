the one trying to dump price might not be so happy over his failure

2 times this persons 10k sell orders got eaten in matter of seconds

Historical KMDUSD chart looks good.

weekly 8/41 ema golden cross happening

[05-Jul-19 03:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This shows that on the next bull market $40 can be easily achievable.

[05-Jul-19 03:36 PM] CHMEX#0686
Its a different chain has a different revenue stream ( notarization fees) @Stephen Hawking

[05-Jul-19 03:37 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
So where i can easily see how much i will get for my dex? For example i have an amount of 10 dex...is there a overview when and how much i get?

[05-Jul-19 03:38 PM] CHMEX#0686
For dex there is no overview yet

[05-Jul-19 03:38 PM] CHMEX#0686
But I can make one for the known chains

[05-Jul-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
dexstats.info will get it, but until we get lots of trades there wont be lots of fees

[05-Jul-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
that being said, the response to the beta release has been very good

[05-Jul-19 03:42 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
Oh thank you guys...no problem that at the begining there will be not much fees...i am only intetested in a good overview how much fees were collected. If i read correct the payout will always happen when 1.000.000 usd is reached?

[05-Jul-19 03:44 PM] CHMEX#0686
Its a manual process at +-1m usd yes atm

[05-Jul-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is the threshold

[05-Jul-19 03:44 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
What would happen if 1kmd is 1million dollars

[05-Jul-19 03:44 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Do you process it every minute

[05-Jul-19 03:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Adjustments would be made

[05-Jul-19 03:45 PM] CHMEX#0686
Adjust to to 100m yesüôÇ

[05-Jul-19 03:46 PM] CHMEX#0686
Last payout was in dec 2017 for crypto /supernet

[05-Jul-19 03:46 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
So when 1 million is reached every asset holder get 1$ in kmd?

[05-Jul-19 03:47 PM] CHMEX#0686
You get proportial to what you have

[05-Jul-19 03:47 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
For 1 asset

[05-Jul-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it is approx, the KMD that represents the ~1 mil USD will be allocated to the 1 million DEX

[05-Jul-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so yes, approx $1 per DEX

[05-Jul-19 03:48 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Are you going to process dividends from supernet?

[05-Jul-19 03:48 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
I kinda want consistent cash flow from supernet asset

[05-Jul-19 03:48 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
Ok...perfect...i cant wait for it :-)

[05-Jul-19 03:48 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
Thank you guys

[05-Jul-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the DEX revshares that go to SuperNET will be passed through

[05-Jul-19 03:49 PM] actionslacks#4072
ka-ching

[05-Jul-19 03:49 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Exciting

[05-Jul-19 03:50 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
So when can we replace James with an AI?

[05-Jul-19 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
i will automate as much of this as possible, but realistically we are dealing with many different funds sources in different coins

[05-Jul-19 03:50 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Would be exciting if kmd becomes a skynetcoin

[05-Jul-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
however, when atomicDEX has good liquidity across the board, i guess all the consolidation can be done pretty automatically

Crazy...we need a volume of 1.33 billion for 1 milion fees

[05-Jul-19 03:53 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
Thats a lot

[05-Jul-19 04:01 PM] CHMEX#0686
Just think that whales dont want to trade on a CEX

[05-Jul-19 04:02 PM] CHMEX#0686
With atomicDEX they always own the coins

[05-Jul-19 04:03 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
You are rightüëç

[05-Jul-19 04:06 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
Does REVS have any value anymore?

[05-Jul-19 04:07 PM] CHMEX#0686
Revs also benefits from various assets

[05-Jul-19 04:07 PM] CHMEX#0686
If you want to sell I saw some people buying

I accumulated a bunch when barterdex came out in 2017. Just curious if it‚Äôs still worth holding. I‚Äôll keep holding them üòÉ

[05-Jul-19 04:08 PM] CHMEX#0686
Good idea

[05-Jul-19 04:09 PM] CHMEX#0686
Gets a little bid of everything

[05-Jul-19 04:10 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
Yea that was my rationale. Rather bet on all the different aspects of the ecosystem instead of just one. Diversify

[05-Jul-19 04:10 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902

Cex are now the one who basicly control the price of coins and tokens. Wonder what will happen when people turn to dex.

[05-Jul-19 04:42 PM] Markus#5464
i wonder how many CEX's have bots with fake money added into the accounts

[05-Jul-19 04:42 PM] Malti#3948
99% of coins will die

[05-Jul-19 04:42 PM] Malti#3948
And the 1% will prosper

[05-Jul-19 04:46 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
People said that when we had 50 shitcoins

[05-Jul-19 04:46 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
And now we have like 100000 shitcoins

[05-Jul-19 04:46 PM] dan.#2473
Most old shitcoins are gone though

[05-Jul-19 04:47 PM] Malti#3948
Because exchanges keep listing more shitcoins

[05-Jul-19 04:47 PM] dan.#2473
So it happened

[05-Jul-19 04:48 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Btw I always find it funny of the exchange token

[05-Jul-19 04:48 PM] actionslacks#4072
i would guess that whenever a non-stable coin's daily volume is is near half of its total supply it's fake volume

[05-Jul-19 04:49 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Isn't it funny when the very act of buying exchange coins like bnb is how the fee gets created?

[05-Jul-19 04:49 PM] actionslacks#4072
it's a great racket

[05-Jul-19 04:50 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
So basically in a way it is backed by itself

[05-Jul-19 04:50 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Weird shit isn't it?

[05-Jul-19 04:50 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
It's like an infinite loop of itself

[05-Jul-19 04:51 PM] phm87#7395
Binance buys back some BNB with their benefits and burn them. Aim is to raise BNB value

[05-Jul-19 04:51 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Yeah and the benefits are created because people buy and sell bnb

[05-Jul-19 04:51 PM] phm87#7395
Mmmhhh nooo

[05-Jul-19 04:52 PM] phm87#7395
It is the benef of the whole exchange

[05-Jul-19 04:52 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
And all other shitcoins but you get the point

Lots of exchange have their token. BNB is different (bought back with huge money)

[05-Jul-19 04:53 PM] phm87#7395
I don t like bnb. I don t like binance

[05-Jul-19 04:53 PM] phm87#7395
But BNB is different. It is an enhanced super scamshitcoin

So the next time people say crypto is backed by nothing, you can say it is backed by itself

[05-Jul-19 04:54 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
And they will stare at you like u mad

[05-Jul-19 04:54 PM] phm87#7395
I don t talk to ppl about crypto. I agree to their false accusations and I move on

[05-Jul-19 04:55 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Well that could be another way

[05-Jul-19 04:55 PM] phm87#7395
And I recall that since end of Bretton Woods rules, fiat is backed by ... nothing

[05-Jul-19 04:55 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Well fiat is backed by tax

[05-Jul-19 04:56 PM] phm87#7395
USD was the last one to be backed. But as US needed to print money for war

[05-Jul-19 04:56 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
You work your ass off to pay tax and it's based on that

[05-Jul-19 04:56 PM] phm87#7395
No

[05-Jul-19 04:56 PM] phm87#7395
Taxes are a money flow

[05-Jul-19 04:56 PM] phm87#7395
While existing fiat is not

[05-Jul-19 04:56 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Yeah the value of a currency is backed by the country's money flow

[05-Jul-19 04:57 PM] phm87#7395
No. Its price depends on market

[05-Jul-19 04:57 PM] phm87#7395
I can show you counter exemples when I will be home
