Yes. But a bit expensive

@KomodoWorld i want one too

[26-Aug-18 09:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362

is there a site in existence that tells me all KMD and all  AC holdings of a certain address?

[26-Aug-18 01:41 PM] Lumbi#8378
The japanese central bank owns the overwhelming majority of their stock market. They've been propping it up for over a decade and it's actually to the point where there are almost no private investors in japanese equities anymore.

Of course, the same is true for every developed nation and most emerging market nations as well, they're just not as far along in the metamorphosis to economic collapse as Japan. The Fed balance sheet in the US is absolutely atrocious, they're holding trillions in assets to prop up the stock markets.

They keep talking about unwinding the balance sheet but they're doing it in tens of billions per month, at their current rate it would take decades to unwind and of course they're letting the air out of the bubble they inflated when they unwind it. They're just hoping they can do it slowly enough that no one catches on and there's no panic sell and that the actual fundamentals of business underlying the market will kick in and pick up the slack at some point.

They'll probably draw it out till at least the next Potus election, but eventually their strategy for hiding their extreme fiduciary irresponsibility will crash and burn.

waiting is not stressful with BTC > $6k

[26-Aug-18 05:44 PM] snowdamn#2414
it will suck hard if we go below

[26-Aug-18 05:49 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
Everything looks good for a rebound in the upcoming weeks, but i still think BTC is going to 3-4K, and will stabilize around 5K until mid to late 2019. Halving is near then so that should be a decent reason to shoot for new ATH's.

[26-Aug-18 05:51 PM] snowdamn#2414
"mid to late 2019" is too long of a wait (for me)

Bitcoin long term price prediction, with the 'halving' effect factored in. What do you think ?

nice chart, but, if you look closely, it allows for another ATH before 3rd halving üòâ

oh, that's what Widow said before lol

[26-Aug-18 05:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But what if adoption is a catalyst for a price increase and not block reward halving

New logarithmic chart for crypto. Powerful insight here - cliffs are we are still overvalued, it‚Äôs going to be at worst more downside, or at best we start to stabilize here or ASAP and retain that over the next year or so. Market has to stabilize before next bull market ...

[26-Aug-18 06:13 PM] snowdamn#2414
i would need to see BTC at $3k to be convinced big money is not looking for an entry

[26-Aug-18 06:15 PM] snowdamn#2414
maybe even sub $2.5k

[26-Aug-18 06:17 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
I would suppress the price if i was a big whale, so i could accumulate as much as possible for a safe cheap entry price to be ready for the next cycle.

what if there are multiple whales, some are trying to supress price, some to increase it to sell more expensive

[26-Aug-18 06:21 PM] snowdamn#2414
@ $700 we'll have futures being delisted in Chicago...

@passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã  I would work together with the other whales so we all have the same thought üòÖ

how do you know how many of them there is, do you know them> how?

[26-Aug-18 06:29 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
Because let's be honest, 6.5K for 1 BTC is still not a safe entry price for big whales. 3K + ETF approved + next halving + a stable price is a much more safer bet.

[26-Aug-18 06:30 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
what I mean is that there is no 100% that the others do not play the other way

[26-Aug-18 06:30 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
which makes your play risky
