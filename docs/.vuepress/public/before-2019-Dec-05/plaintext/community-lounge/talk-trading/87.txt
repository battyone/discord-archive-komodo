I'll think about it for a bit LOL. I probably used up over $12000 in google credits as well as a lot of time, effort and getting in early too LOL. I fully expect verus to hit 50c to $1 at a minimum, and the stakings gonna be decent with this stack

[07-Aug-18 01:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
but at the same time I  prefer just having kmd

[07-Aug-18 01:23 AM] bishop#9773

@Deleted User If you think it'll hit 50c to a $1 maybe you should just hold on to them

KMD may still be at a bargain  price then

[07-Aug-18 04:17 AM] jspook16#3059
tech is just advancing too fast so price should be dropping ..

[07-Aug-18 04:22 AM] jspook16#3059
Is your komodo stash healthy? If so you can manage your overall risk by holding Verus long term

[07-Aug-18 04:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah just saw a post of jl saying it costed 50c to mine per vrsc, and hashrate doubled since then so $1 or more each is cost atm. With halving and more miners coming, selling at 2c is a bit too litlle. Il hold onto them for now and hope mike does a good job üòÅ  otherwise i can proooobably sell it for more in a few months time anyway

[07-Aug-18 04:50 AM] jspook16#3059
I think thats the smart play for now üòÉ

[07-Aug-18 04:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what does verus mining costs now?

VRSC hashrate drops, so firesale? üòÑ

[07-Aug-18 04:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
just curious

[07-Aug-18 04:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
recent trades I did calculates me to 0.188 usd

[07-Aug-18 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
I think mining cost is about 10 cents per TH, so ranging from 20 to 40 cents now, but if you get a good rate on spot instances, maybe you can reduce the price. of course if you have idle CPU, it only costs electricity, which would probably make it just a few cents, but not sure how much hashrate is available from idle (older) CPU as the latest ones get almost GH and older ones 100 MH

[07-Aug-18 07:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
@jl777c just wondering for this calculation is it cost per vrsc, alculated at 24vrsc per block? 96? Or is it cost per block currently üòÆ

[07-Aug-18 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a variance in cost, so for some people it is the current cost, for others at 24, for others in between.but if just one miner with low cost is selling, then it sets the lowest price

[07-Aug-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
but at 4TH, it seems unlikely anybody has a 10 cents mining cost and closer to 20 to 40 cents, even at 96 VRSC blocks

[07-Aug-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe a large farm with trailing edge laptops can get a very low cost but at a high infrastructure cost

[07-Aug-18 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
that fact that trades are happening about 20 cents each, indicates there are miners with lower cost, the volumes are about 25% of daily new coins. so as long as the 96 blocks are here these prices are likely to be available at this volume. at the 48 halving, then half the supply and half again at 24. at progressively higher price as long as the hashrate doesnt go down

[07-Aug-18 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
after the 96 and 48 miner sales, we then reach the 24 VRSC period where another 12 or so from unlocking the coins, so like a 36+ VRSC block reward and i think then we finally get some sort of stable equilbrium without any coin supply changes happening for 2 years. then as new releases increase adoption, we can see higher and higher prices. What the floor price will be at the 2 year period... that is still unclear,but it seems 50 cents is not an unreasonable guess. and yes, that means people selling at 20 cents are creating a nice bargain for the "patient" buyers willing to wait the eternity of 2.5 months

[07-Aug-18 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
That is why I had no problems buying unlocked VRSC for $5+ in the early days as the math made it clear each VRSC would stake quite a few more
