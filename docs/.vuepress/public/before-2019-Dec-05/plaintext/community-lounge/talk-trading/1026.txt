[06-Aug-19 01:57 PM] actionslacks#4072
i remember celebrating when we got up to 200 ppl in the supernet slack

[06-Aug-19 01:57 PM] actionslacks#4072

in recent weeks every time ive popped in here i've said nothing about the current price, just sayin.  its obvious its a systemic reason at the moment- all alts are shitting

[06-Aug-19 01:58 PM] Markus#5464
@Flint this price action have nothing to do with the agama hack, its alts capitulating and US customers selling their alt coins before Binance close US doors

[06-Aug-19 01:58 PM] Flint#6435
and what remains? do not sell the same)))

[06-Aug-19 01:59 PM] CoinKing88#1540
The Guys who cant figure out the mechanics (alts being compressed when btc moves) should be ignored. Reading only negative rubbish in here isnt helping Anyone

@Markus  and this, too, together

[06-Aug-19 02:02 PM] Markus#5464
Either way ppl panic for nothing, to me it seems like most of ppl here are not traders so if price go to 0.5$ and then within a year to 10$ u dont lose anything being abit more patient

[06-Aug-19 02:02 PM] Flint#6435
it is strange that on June 9, without any news, we saw a peak in prices! and then antara came out but we see a new bottom every day - when do weak hands leave the market? how many binance users are there? binance inferior to coinbene in volume!

[06-Aug-19 02:02 PM] Markus#5464
coinbene is fake volume

[06-Aug-19 02:02 PM] Markus#5464
nobody use it

[06-Aug-19 02:03 PM] actionslacks#4072
crypto has evolved into a potentially international incident with its ability to bypass sanctions that govts spend hundreds of billions to enforce. there is no precedence for the current crypto market and it's implications. its not gonna be predictable. or probably even make any sense at all.

[06-Aug-19 02:04 PM] dan.#2473
tru dat

[06-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Markus#5464
and govt got the money from where?

[06-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Markus#5464
out of thin air

[06-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Flint#6435
@Markus  youre right - but even scammers want to know when the panic will go away - to sleep peacefully!ü§ë

[06-Aug-19 02:04 PM] dan.#2473
their decree yo

[06-Aug-19 02:04 PM] phideas#8309
the core and most important feature of any "crypto" is "censorship resistance"
there wasn't any real push back against crypto from govs yet
if a hard push back event ever happens, only then we gonna see how much resilient crypto projects are
the most resilient (censorship resistant) tech will survive

[06-Aug-19 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`there wasn't any real push back against crypto from govs yet` thats because they want it to exist

[06-Aug-19 02:05 PM] actionslacks#4072
@blackjok3r is probably gonna get hired by the govt soon.

[06-Aug-19 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
exactly üòÑ

[06-Aug-19 02:05 PM] Markus#5464
im sure u will see central banks global coin sooner or later, all fiat, euro, usd and whatever will disappear and u will have a centralized fiat coin

[06-Aug-19 02:05 PM] dan.#2473
cryptos the greatest thing ever for governments but they need to figure out how to control it

[06-Aug-19 02:06 PM] Markus#5464
This is why regulators give a headache to Libra, Facebook is trying to steal central banks idea

[06-Aug-19 02:06 PM] actionslacks#4072
maybe crypto users need to figure out how to control the govt

[06-Aug-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
central banks are bankrupt... they need a new system to replace them anyway

just depends which way it goes

[06-Aug-19 02:07 PM] Flint#6435
@Markus  and who will the issuer be? what provision? bitcoin or gold?

[06-Aug-19 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
having a limited money suppply also by default makes the popuation smaller lol

[06-Aug-19 02:08 PM] Markus#5464
issuer of global coin will probably be Rothschild family, the ppl who own almost all central banks on earth

[06-Aug-19 02:08 PM] Markus#5464
u think they will leave control of worlds money supply?

[06-Aug-19 02:08 PM] Markus#5464
no way

[06-Aug-19 02:08 PM] actionslacks#4072
the federal reserve is building the fednow financial network, due out in 2023 üòÇ

[06-Aug-19 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if it means they know everything everyone ever does.. yes

[06-Aug-19 02:10 PM] actionslacks#4072
the ability to control the money supply is the ultimate power. getting that power back will be difficult. and the current shitstorm is just a warm up.

[06-Aug-19 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
BTC is backed by energy and they have control of that

[06-Aug-19 02:10 PM] joe2x4#5987
This channel is SO much easier to read once cag and Dan blocked. broken record these two.

[06-Aug-19 02:11 PM] Markus#5464
U have to remember that average joe have no clue even about fiat inflation cause they dont bother to educate themselves

[06-Aug-19 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That is why people who do know should tell them about it

[06-Aug-19 02:11 PM] Markus#5464
Ye sure

[06-Aug-19 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I live in a farming town... nearly every person I know who can is getting all their money right now

[06-Aug-19 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
trust in the old system is long lost

[06-Aug-19 02:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
probably the ones who know will also make ventures which will give new jobs to those who did not bother to learn and raise their level of knowledge to get along with new changing economic system.

[06-Aug-19 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or just keep asking us for money :abusedsmily:

[06-Aug-19 02:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
be easy with each other, share your knowledge and make solutions and ventures.

@Markus  with 99% of altcoins, everything is clear! but what about bitcoin and tokenized real-world assets on decentralized exchanges - after all, this is also an uncontrolled trillion-dollar market!

[06-Aug-19 02:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
many of you here will get good amount of financial power as the value of cryptocurrency space will increase in coming years.
think about how you gonna manage that.
You have good amount of time to learn and raise your level of understanding on managing different aspects of such things.
if you think you lack knowledge to manage that level of financial gains you could probably gain in future, you should be investing your time in learning those skills than panicking on prices etc.
Even being a non-developer you have very very rare and good opportunities in your hand, right now.
use it. and be ready for coming years with your newly gained wealth and knowledge.

[06-Aug-19 02:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I feel no worries as at this point I feel insured enough that cryptocurrency market won't go ridiculously down too much enough like we seen in the early years of BTC

[06-Aug-19 02:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

i've been banned for elsewhere for raising doubts about tether, bitfinex, tron, eos, etc. horizen discord banned me for mentioning pirate. the gentlest criticisms elsewhere will get your voice silenced. this discord is much more inclusive than most.

For btc, i think its just a daily correction, too short time period for uptrend, it will continue soon

[06-Aug-19 03:55 PM] Flint#6435
Well, when will we see strong support on the chart ???? everyone just sells coins and no hope for growth in the near future! as many have already noticed a correlation: when bitcoin rises, komodo drops, and when bitcoin drops komodo drops again!

[06-Aug-19 03:56 PM] Oszy#5734
read back the last 8 hours in this channel it's pretty much  what has been discussed

[06-Aug-19 04:01 PM] Flint#6435
not a single tool or functional analysis works or technical analysis - no announcements and news - nothing! everyone goes into bitcoin - dominance is growing - altcoins are dying - but which of them will come to life is an interesting question

[06-Aug-19 04:21 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Is it so hard principle to understand

[06-Aug-19 04:21 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Till btc dominance reverse , or alts show bottoms on weekly it will dump

[06-Aug-19 04:22 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
