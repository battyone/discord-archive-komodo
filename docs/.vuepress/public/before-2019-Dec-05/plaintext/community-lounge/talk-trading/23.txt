@Andersen 
It's an intriguing strategy -- announce first, set an unmanageable and unforgiving deadline to motivate yourself, and then find out whether or not you can do it.

If it works, it will be f'ing brilliant!

Looks like McAfee with him dick

[26-Jun-18 09:31 PM] PTYX#6840

[26-Jun-18 09:31 PM] PTYX#6840

[26-Jun-18 09:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
All you can find is coverband garbage

[26-Jun-18 09:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Vimeo has authentic hendrix

[26-Jun-18 09:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
YouTube sucks

Anyone interested in $250 coupons for Bitmain? I have two

[27-Jun-18 12:14 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'll give you 1 KMD each

[27-Jun-18 12:18 AM] bishop#9773
üò¶

[27-Jun-18 12:18 AM] bishop#9773
Was thinking 40 kmd each, else probably buy two more miners prior to them expiring

[27-Jun-18 12:20 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Giving away $370 or spending $2k...

no

[27-Jun-18 12:52 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
sadly, 1 coupon per 1 item üò¶

[27-Jun-18 10:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Wtf

[27-Jun-18 10:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
We hit 21k today?

[27-Jun-18 10:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
How is this even possible

[27-Jun-18 10:50 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
21?

[27-Jun-18 10:50 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
where?

[27-Jun-18 10:54 AM] Sherdogz#6731
@Hollowman9000 when KMD moon?

[27-Jun-18 11:09 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Hard to say

[27-Jun-18 11:09 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Unless this is notary funding dumping or OG cashout, we‚Äôre witnessing chuckleheads dumping at a loss

[27-Jun-18 11:10 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
or from another angle

[27-Jun-18 11:10 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
New blood getting some rocket seats

[27-Jun-18 11:10 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Which is fine and dandy

[27-Jun-18 11:12 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
define "moon" üòõ

[27-Jun-18 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
moon atm is 35k

[27-Jun-18 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IMO... if it can get there in 5 days I would be happy, have to sell less KMD to pay NN hosting fees that way üòÑ

[27-Jun-18 11:19 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
lol

[27-Jun-18 11:20 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
then I guess I'm holding for supermoon, because I'm not selling any under 50k (other than equipment purchases)

[27-Jun-18 11:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Anything under 1 million sats is chucklehead territory imo

[27-Jun-18 11:21 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
lol

[27-Jun-18 11:23 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
then call me a chucklehead, because I'm OK with my rigs only making $7k per month

[27-Jun-18 11:23 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I might sell some around that price point to wipe out my mortgage

[27-Jun-18 11:23 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Other than that, hodlgang

[27-Jun-18 11:24 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
How many gpus?

[27-Jun-18 11:25 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
40, I think

[27-Jun-18 11:25 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
This antminer rig will obsolete some hardware

[27-Jun-18 11:26 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm working on a stratum that will help solve that; spread hash across all asset chains

[27-Jun-18 11:26 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I don‚Äôt know what a stratum is

[27-Jun-18 11:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@ComputerGenie we had 21.3k sats on bittrex

[27-Jun-18 11:27 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's the "backend" to what most refer to as a "pool"

Tracks brain drain in this space

[27-Jun-18 11:31 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
EOS price being the inverse indicator

[27-Jun-18 11:32 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the problem with price as indicators is that most look at the pseudo USd and not any actual price

[27-Jun-18 11:33 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I look at satoshis

"at a loss" is merely an assumption

Where‚Äôd you get them from?

[27-Jun-18 11:35 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
direct from Bitmain

[27-Jun-18 11:35 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
How long was the wait?
