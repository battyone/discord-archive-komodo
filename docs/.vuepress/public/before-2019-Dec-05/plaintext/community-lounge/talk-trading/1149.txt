not sure how many non-kyc fiat gateways are still in existence

[20-Sep-19 03:18 PM] Markus#5464
the potential coins to be listed to coinbase just look like a bag of shitcoins ðŸ¤”

[20-Sep-19 03:18 PM] Markus#5464
Avalanche, Celo, Chia, Coda, Dfinity, Filecoin, Handshake, Kadena, Mobilecoin, NEAR, Nervos, Oasis, Orchid, Polkadot, Solana, Spacemesh, and Telegram

[20-Sep-19 03:21 PM] Neko#5830
coinbase lost it

[20-Sep-19 03:22 PM] Markus#5464
cant believe it

[20-Sep-19 03:22 PM] Markus#5464
embarassing

[20-Sep-19 03:22 PM] Neko#5830
it is actually

[20-Sep-19 03:41 PM] Tek#5253
those all sound like asbsolute shit

[20-Sep-19 03:41 PM] Tek#5253
except for maybe spacemesh

[20-Sep-19 03:46 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
huh. I think I've heard of only dfinity and telegram before. It's turning in to shitcoinbase now.

[20-Sep-19 03:47 PM] actionslacks#4072
it's a basket of walls st defi vc garbage. the geniuses who handle the hedge funds are moving over to crypto in a big way and your open source idealism isn't invited. coinbase probably made a bunch of money in this deal.

[20-Sep-19 03:59 PM] Grisu#3373
@Cryptoon Bitcoin ATM but you pay 3% fee

Why isn't Coinbase listing KMD?  It is, after all, the best tech.

{Reactions}
ðŸ¤” 

[20-Sep-19 05:31 PM] Neko#5830
probably because of atomicdex

[20-Sep-19 05:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what could be stopping KMD from being listed in coinbase then ??? ðŸ¤” @Steve Lee @Audo

[20-Sep-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
probably lack of million dollar payment

[20-Sep-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
ZEC paid millions for their coinbase listing

[20-Sep-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
likely a million wouldnt be enough (unless you have shared ownership between coinbase)

[20-Sep-19 05:44 PM] Neko#5830
interesting, you have inside sources on this one jl777c?

[20-Sep-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
zcash published a financial report, i think they paid $6 mil+ worth of ZEC for coinbase, not sure the exact details, but it is published

[20-Sep-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it is common knowledge it is pay to play in crypto, unless you have shared ownerships

[20-Sep-19 06:14 PM] Neko#5830
thats a lot of dosh

[20-Sep-19 06:15 PM] Neko#5830
no wonder the price only falls, they must be selling everything from the dev tax

[20-Sep-19 06:27 PM] mobipoi#5774
@Tek "technically you shouldnt even fuck your woman for the complete 9 months she is pregnant" in regards to that nature has it so , as it been researched that women are most highly sexually aroused in their pregnant months , which makes sense as it makes the male high on sex during her most vulnerable month , she could barely move and has to rely on a male in those moment so if he leaves her  survival reduces, hence why women grave sex alots when pregnant and that makes sure the man comes back also oxytocin is released during sex which encourages more pair bonding , again ensuring male comes back after hunt , and preparing for child rearing also testosterone drops in male and self sacrificial act becomes more pronounced etc... so yes sex in those nine months are imprinted in human nature

[20-Sep-19 06:30 PM] mobipoi#5774
Obviously in today's world some of those instincts are not applicable , it like old legacy code running on new software but serves no purpose

[20-Sep-19 06:31 PM] Tek#5253
>> as it has been researched

[20-Sep-19 06:31 PM] Tek#5253
by who? Jew science incorporated?

[20-Sep-19 06:32 PM] mobipoi#5774
It just biology

[20-Sep-19 06:32 PM] Tek#5253
sounds like something you read and parot

[20-Sep-19 06:32 PM] Tek#5253
but don't truly know

[20-Sep-19 06:32 PM] mobipoi#5774
Although birth control pill has it whole effect

[20-Sep-19 06:32 PM] mobipoi#5774
Ok I digress ,

[20-Sep-19 06:33 PM] Tek#5253
dunno man, I do sense some logical thinking in there

[20-Sep-19 06:33 PM] Tek#5253
it seems to make sense for maybe the first 2 months

[20-Sep-19 06:33 PM] Tek#5253
to have sex with your woman when pregnant

[20-Sep-19 06:33 PM] Tek#5253
but yeah once you know she's pregnant

[20-Sep-19 06:33 PM] Tek#5253
you just leave her be man

[20-Sep-19 06:33 PM] Tek#5253
mission succes

[20-Sep-19 06:33 PM] mobipoi#5774
But that's mating strategy

[20-Sep-19 06:34 PM] mobipoi#5774
Child survival it low

[20-Sep-19 06:34 PM] Tek#5253
animoos don't keep fucking the girl animal once she is pregnant. girl animal doesn't want to meet any males once she is

[20-Sep-19 06:34 PM] mobipoi#5774
Both partnership increase survival

[20-Sep-19 06:35 PM] mobipoi#5774
Of off spring and you can impregnate her again

[20-Sep-19 06:35 PM] Tek#5253
either way I transcended above sex for lustfull purposes

[20-Sep-19 06:35 PM] Tek#5253

[20-Sep-19 06:36 PM] Tek#5253
I really can't afford to waste my seed

[20-Sep-19 06:36 PM] Tek#5253
i'll have sex for making child

[20-Sep-19 06:36 PM] Tek#5253
only

discussion ðŸ¤”

[20-Sep-19 06:37 PM] mobipoi#5774
Yes  It depends on sexual dymorphic the women not wanting sex after

[20-Sep-19 06:37 PM] Tek#5253
you don't go around and give your (crypto) seed out to easily either right

[20-Sep-19 06:37 PM] Tek#5253
nah. you only use the seed when you really have to

[20-Sep-19 06:37 PM] Oszy#5734
tbh wasn't expecting trade talk but this is wow ðŸ˜„

[20-Sep-19 06:38 PM] Markus#5464
this is a topic that will never end just saying everyone got different opinions when it comes to sex

[20-Sep-19 06:38 PM] Markus#5464
u can discuss this for hours

[20-Sep-19 06:38 PM] Markus#5464

[20-Sep-19 06:39 PM] mobipoi#5774
Tek mating strategy might be a genetic expression

[20-Sep-19 06:41 PM] mobipoi#5774
Has it advantage such as preserving resources for when off spring comes , high parental investment strategy

[20-Sep-19 06:41 PM] mobipoi#5774
I Don't know everything just some thought but I digress to trading talks

[20-Sep-19 06:42 PM] Tek#5253
I mean maybe I exagerated a bit...

[20-Sep-19 06:42 PM] Tek#5253
I would have sex but just uh not frequently

[20-Sep-19 06:42 PM] Tek#5253
not like in the past where I had le sex with my gf and then also wanked it when she wasn't there n shit

[20-Sep-19 06:43 PM] Tek#5253
like most men seem to do

[20-Sep-19 06:43 PM] Tek#5253
which is totally degenerate
