WTT CRYPTO/KMD - 1/3 - LF 1000 Crypto.

[23-May-19 05:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
WTT DEX/KMD - 1/5 - LF 1000 DEX

[23-May-19 05:18 PM] jorian#4555
how do i read this

[23-May-19 05:18 PM] jorian#4555
you are looking for 1000 CRYPTO for a price of 3 KMD each?

[23-May-19 05:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
yes

[23-May-19 05:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Are there markets for it?  I guess I should look.

[23-May-19 05:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Assumed no since Bdex is down

[23-May-19 05:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
1k crypto for 3k KMD yes. and 1k DEX for 5K KMD

[23-May-19 05:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Maybe its a low bid but its out there. üòõ

[23-May-19 05:29 PM] CHMEX#0686
Accrued dividends for crypto are about 0.5kmd each

[23-May-19 05:29 PM] CHMEX#0686
If you get it good yield

[23-May-19 05:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I make 10% currently on my FIAT.  Too bad it gets devalued constantly

[23-May-19 05:30 PM] jorian#4555
i did a WTB a month ago and people were asking 15 KMD for 1 CRYPTO

[23-May-19 05:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
ffff too much.

[23-May-19 05:31 PM] jorian#4555
yep

[23-May-19 05:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I would consider maybe 5 then.

[23-May-19 05:32 PM] jorian#4555
i wonder how much CRYPTO is still in the hands of james

[23-May-19 05:33 PM] NNoperator#3835
You may have some interest in trades if you post on Barterlly

[23-May-19 05:35 PM] NNoperator#3835
but for DEX you will probably need to increase your asking price

About 30kmd /DEX atm for smaller volume. 50 kmd for big volume

[23-May-19 05:37 PM] LocoMB#8593
these old SuperNET assets are things the current HODLers HODL like pitbulls

[23-May-19 05:37 PM] LocoMB#8593
after all this time- who would sell now? for mediocre profit?

[23-May-19 05:38 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
very close to launch of mm 2 , i would think DEX is a definite HODL üòÑ

Select a pair to see offers

turns up totally empty for me too, so maybe beta needs a bit debugging?

[23-May-19 05:43 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the offer has been cancelled , maybe that's why

[23-May-19 05:44 PM] jeezy#3408

me too

[23-May-19 05:45 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
my link works though , eventhough it looks the same to yours @jeezy

[23-May-19 05:54 PM] mobipoi#5774
If DEX is only 10% of binance given it the most practical dex out there that will be a few hundreds of millions dont forget that with no KYC there is no limit so add in there OTC volume

[23-May-19 05:55 PM] mobipoi#5774
Which apparently it more than the cmc vol

[23-May-19 05:56 PM] mobipoi#5774
Barterdex is  coinbase and binance combined

[23-May-19 05:56 PM] mobipoi#5774
Oh and there is no limit on your location

[23-May-19 05:57 PM] mobipoi#5774
More market participants large or small

[23-May-19 05:58 PM] mobipoi#5774
So a billion valuation in less than2.5 year is possible

[23-May-19 05:58 PM] mobipoi#5774
That my take

[23-May-19 06:08 PM] jeezy#3408
@Gordon Komodo  does it work?

[23-May-19 06:13 PM] jorian#4555
@mobipoi keep in mind that a DEX is different from a Binance-style exchange. There will always be a need for a centralised solution, since no DEX can match the speed in which a CEX operates.

[23-May-19 06:13 PM] jorian#4555
a DEX is an addition, a much needed one, and will probably take away some volume from CEXs

[23-May-19 06:17 PM] mobipoi#5774
That assuming barterdex doesn't come with a Cex solution which I think it will in tandem

[23-May-19 06:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Ok so 250 Crypto for 2250 KMD
and 250 DEX for 4000 KMD
DM me to execute.  We can use Barterlly if you wish.

Verus pump?

[23-May-19 07:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I did decide to use Barterlly DWY.

[23-May-19 07:36 PM] dan.#2473
@FishyGuts check DMs

[23-May-19 07:46 PM] jcity#3639
@FishyGuts is your Barterlly offer public?

[23-May-19 08:05 PM] hastrup#8742
@jcity i think the dex trade is taken üòÉ

[23-May-19 08:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Cryptoon someone definitely went full retard on verus for a bit

[23-May-19 08:15 PM] jcity#3639
@hastrup whys that?

[23-May-19 08:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
nice pump Verus

[23-May-19 08:16 PM] hastrup#8742
@jcity it's not there but the crypto is

@Hollowman9000 well deserved tbh

[23-May-19 08:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Agreed

[23-May-19 08:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Probably binance incoming

[23-May-19 08:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What other reason can it be

[23-May-19 08:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Doubt

üòÉ

[23-May-19 08:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
There‚Äôs typically less than 1 BTC volume on it lately

[23-May-19 08:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Someone probably saw the triple digit gains on the other DP coins and tried to kick off a runaway pump

[23-May-19 08:34 PM] jcity#3639
Btw for anyone wondering... I just completed a swap on Barterlly and it worked perfectly! Thank you to the creators üôå
