put order, pump price

[26-Dec-18 02:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
remove order, let price drop again

[26-Dec-18 02:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
put order again, buying up everything up to a certain pricelevel

[26-Dec-18 02:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
rinse and repeat

[26-Dec-18 02:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
have we really reached a point where $11k USD = 🐋 or am I just not seeing what you guys are talking about?

[26-Dec-18 02:46 PM] house#8741
@Cryptoon ... did you hear anything back from Sasha re: Coinomat ?

[26-Dec-18 02:47 PM] house#8741
I got no reply from email

[26-Dec-18 02:49 PM] house#8741
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 at this point, I think anyone with more than a bitcoin to spare  is considered a whale 😝

[26-Dec-18 02:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[26-Dec-18 02:49 PM] yorklab#7270
I think it was a 50 btc order at the time.

[26-Dec-18 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh, I must have missed that, I've only been seeing like 2-3

[26-Dec-18 02:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@house I'm not following

[26-Dec-18 02:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Was there a mail or something I should have done? 😄

[26-Dec-18 02:52 PM] house#8741
Oh, apologies, thought it was you who had followed up on Sasha’s comment about assets to be recompensed .... hmmm

[26-Dec-18 02:53 PM] house#8741
Have to check back

[26-Dec-18 02:53 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I've emailed Sasha twice. Haven't received anything from him. Best to think he has abandoned the idea again.

[26-Dec-18 02:54 PM] house#8741
Jeez, why he even mention it 🤦

[26-Dec-18 02:56 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
People keep asking about it. A lot of holders of his assets when he claim he wouldn't leave them, which he did. He does need to either step up on what he says he'll do or just not mention anything at all.

[26-Dec-18 02:56 PM] house#8741
Yeup

[26-Dec-18 02:57 PM] house#8741
Wot the heck that shit doin at 3$ is beyond me

[26-Dec-18 02:58 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
James might receive some hate for his assets not performing years after they were handed out but at least he moved them to Komodo. Sasha hasn't done shit after the ico. If he had said "now or never" then everyone would have traded in.

[26-Dec-18 03:00 PM] house#8741
Thanks for saying that *heavy sigh*
Ok, back to positives 😇

[26-Dec-18 03:01 PM] house#8741
So ... how about that xrp ?

The Whale is back at 18K again.

[26-Dec-18 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh, now that I see

[26-Dec-18 04:54 PM] modereck#4269
wow pump it whale!

[26-Dec-18 04:56 PM] modereck#4269

[26-Dec-18 05:14 PM] Lieutenant#1428
whale gone

[26-Dec-18 05:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@house I *think* it was @KomodoWorld that was going to mail him

[26-Dec-18 05:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But dont shoot me if I remembered incorrectly 😄

[26-Dec-18 05:41 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I emailed him but afaik he hasn't answered to anyone

[26-Dec-18 06:01 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
think KMD is about to pull a WAVES?

[26-Dec-18 06:01 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
with the rebranding 2.0?

[26-Dec-18 06:01 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
I can easily see some more excitement enter in soon 😉

[26-Dec-18 06:01 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
ESPECIALLY considering where we are, price wise, with the ichimoku 😉

[26-Dec-18 06:02 PM] Zanzarismo#6500

Fundraiser to get KMD & LUMBER listed on CB? :3040_kingpeepo:

[26-Dec-18 07:35 PM] Lumbi#8378
Seems long overdue for liquidity's sake

[26-Dec-18 07:38 PM] Lumbi#8378
I'm negotiating a 3 for 1 deal: 1BTC for 3 coin add.

[26-Dec-18 07:41 PM] meatspoon#7860
I wasnt gonna say it in the CB chat, but everything in life is negotiable.

[26-Dec-18 07:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
I would imagine there is some flex in their prices

[26-Dec-18 07:42 PM] Lumbi#8378
@meatspoon  where would trading be without it? :3040_kingpeepo:

[26-Dec-18 07:42 PM] Lumbi#8378
It's what we do.

[26-Dec-18 07:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
I would love to see kmd on cb. What other coins are you trying to get listed?

[26-Dec-18 07:43 PM] Lumbi#8378
LUMBER and TRTL

[26-Dec-18 07:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
Talk to Scott Wehman. He likes Turtle a lot.

[26-Dec-18 07:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
He is their PR guy. So if you have anything to offer in terms of PR, that might help grease the gears.

[26-Dec-18 09:15 PM] dokrates#8987
the guy with the buy wall is pretty smart

[26-Dec-18 09:15 PM] dokrates#8987
buys a lot, and as soon price start rising, removes the order

[26-Dec-18 09:15 PM] dokrates#8987
letting the price go down

[26-Dec-18 09:15 PM] dokrates#8987
so he can buy all again

[27-Dec-18 12:13 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
have you guys been charting much lately?

[27-Dec-18 12:13 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
many things seem to be approaching a trend reversal

[27-Dec-18 12:13 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
KMD, and DP chief among them

[27-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
if KMD can close above 18,432 sat today, then that would be above the conservative ichimoku cloud and all but confirm a trend reversal 😉

:3040_kingpeepo:

[27-Dec-18 12:16 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
price is hovering right around it at the moment

[27-Dec-18 12:22 AM] bishop#9773
Clouds... cute.

[27-Dec-18 12:25 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
got a better alternative? LOL

[27-Dec-18 12:25 AM] bishop#9773
Price and volume, keep it simple

[27-Dec-18 12:25 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
yeah, okay.

[27-Dec-18 12:25 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
so what do you expect to happen in upcoming weeks?

[27-Dec-18 12:26 AM] bishop#9773
Test of 22-23k supply if we can take out the 18s

[27-Dec-18 12:27 AM] bishop#9773
Lose 17, look for upper 15s again

[27-Dec-18 12:28 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
I can see that, yeah. I think we'll be retesting the 22-23k range soon aswell, I'm not expecting it to drop back down to 15k however, due to the fundamental drivers

[27-Dec-18 12:28 AM] bishop#9773
Since when have fundamentals mattered for KMD's price till this point?

[27-Dec-18 12:29 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
They always matter, even if they are not the biggest factor of influence, they still determine much potential.

[27-Dec-18 12:29 AM] bishop#9773
lol

[27-Dec-18 12:29 AM] bishop#9773
1/Tech, learn it, live it, love it.

[27-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
I agree, it's not a determining factor for most investors, but it's something to consider nonetheless.

[27-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Likewise#6767
what it will do? range with a pump and dump at times which it has been doing for months on end

[27-Dec-18 12:30 AM] bishop#9773
I have no disagreement about future potential given the backdrop, I'm just saying they haven't at all been reflected in the price

[27-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
I think we're about to break that range though, Likewise.

[27-Dec-18 12:31 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
also, I agree with that Bishop

[27-Dec-18 12:32 AM] bishop#9773
Three months of solid accumulation going on

shexy treasure yassinheart 

[27-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
fundamentals are but one factor, that's all I'm saying. With the rebranding (to be publicly released in a few days) that will drive some masses into the project and if they can propel the price beyond the resistance of ~23ksat, then we're treading into new territory :trollface:

[27-Dec-18 12:33 AM] bishop#9773
I would moderate your expectations of the rebrand

[27-Dec-18 12:33 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
I'm used to being laughed at lol,

[27-Dec-18 12:33 AM] Zanzarismo#6500

Good. The wise plan for generations.

[27-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
many only plan for the weekend, lol

[27-Dec-18 12:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The most important thing about KMD is what no one talks about,  projects in the ecosystem have built mechanisms that pay out and majority of them done without any fundraising.

Chainmakers, peer2 and several others from Notary rewards,  DPoW all has paid , several others are slowly accumulating revenue, Jumblr Dex, soon to be chameleon wallet,   And even more stuff is just getting launched as we speak.    Eventually internal demand will exceed yearly production.  It will take some time but once we exceed it should be a continuous uptrend from then on.

[27-Dec-18 12:43 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
Neato, thanks for that info. I'm learning more everyday :parrot:
