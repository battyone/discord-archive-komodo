Why would they not wanna take profit on something that just 50x:ed their money

[04-Aug-19 06:05 PM] Lanii#8302

[04-Aug-19 06:06 PM] nocturnal#2177
no it doesnt at the moment

[04-Aug-19 06:06 PM] Lanii#8302
if that was the case price action would be the inverse on alts and btc

[04-Aug-19 06:07 PM] dan.#2473
I'm sure it will someday when users and value exist. Not today tho

[04-Aug-19 06:07 PM] nocturnal#2177

[04-Aug-19 06:07 PM] Lanii#8302

[04-Aug-19 06:07 PM] Lanii#8302
while plebs beeing hanging in these chats/forums since late 2017

[04-Aug-19 06:07 PM] Lanii#8302
talking about how this new tech release is gonna change everything

[04-Aug-19 06:08 PM] Lanii#8302
we are just sharing our opinions here

[04-Aug-19 06:08 PM] nocturnal#2177
yeah im not into the cult of a coin thing either

[04-Aug-19 06:08 PM] nocturnal#2177
there is a lot of that

[04-Aug-19 06:08 PM] nocturnal#2177
its funny af

[04-Aug-19 06:08 PM] Lanii#8302
Its pretty retarded to pull the "you are salty" meme every time people dont agree with yu

[04-Aug-19 06:08 PM] nocturnal#2177
but i do think that some alts will be dominant in the future

[04-Aug-19 06:08 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Hehe

[04-Aug-19 06:08 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
He is

[04-Aug-19 06:08 PM] nocturnal#2177
and re salty im just being a troll, dont take it to serious

[04-Aug-19 06:08 PM] dan.#2473
Let's be honest , there are crypto nationalists. Every coin has them. How many people in here know things about other coins. And vice versa for their nationalists

[04-Aug-19 06:09 PM] Lanii#8302
Im so salty longing my longs on btc

[04-Aug-19 06:09 PM] Lanii#8302

[04-Aug-19 06:10 PM] dan.#2473
What's ironic is kmd tech loves btc security.

[04-Aug-19 06:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Some people take their investment in a coin as a extension of theirselfs. Typical narcissistic behaviour . When you say some critic about their coin , they take it as you just spit in their face

[04-Aug-19 06:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@dan.

[04-Aug-19 06:10 PM] dan.#2473
Yes yup very well put

[04-Aug-19 06:10 PM] nocturnal#2177
yup

[04-Aug-19 06:10 PM] dan.#2473
But objectively it should not be the case in an ideal world

[04-Aug-19 06:11 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
No it shouldnt

[04-Aug-19 06:11 PM] dan.#2473
But it's not an ideal world

ppl invest emotionally when they put money in

[04-Aug-19 06:11 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
That's why I mean basically

[04-Aug-19 06:11 PM] Lanii#8302
I do proper TA while your memeing of rsi memes and shit lmao

[04-Aug-19 06:11 PM] nocturnal#2177

[04-Aug-19 06:11 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[04-Aug-19 06:11 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Which is just an opinion

[04-Aug-19 06:11 PM] Lanii#8302

[04-Aug-19 06:11 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[04-Aug-19 06:12 PM] Lanii#8302

[04-Aug-19 06:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
We are all salty retards from time to time.

[04-Aug-19 06:13 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
How many times you repeat the word I , I , I is amazing

[04-Aug-19 06:13 PM] nocturnal#2177
i think btc will be king for several years still

[04-Aug-19 06:13 PM] Lanii#8302
sure lets change the subject

[04-Aug-19 06:13 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Didn't even say you are salty , I just gave a nod to my friend emmanuel

[04-Aug-19 06:13 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Thinking he might be right

[04-Aug-19 06:13 PM] dan.#2473
Nonetheless it's not a bad idea to own the crypto NASDAQ. Think how many plebs went down with Yahoo and the like cause of extreme loyalty . It's good to diverse in a growing space

[04-Aug-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just learn how it works... then what does it matter who wins üòÑ

[04-Aug-19 06:14 PM] dan.#2473
It's fun and games to 100 percent moon shots until it goes the opposite directions

[04-Aug-19 06:15 PM] dan.#2473
Eh people care too much about buying power. Hence why this channel is exploding lately

[04-Aug-19 06:16 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Lanii I say : @Lanii look what becomes btc now for big money?? Device to take little guys money . You say yes as it should be . If your a pleb you deserve to get rekt ..... And you claim  to not be a retard . Even put other words in my mouth. You filthy guy

[04-Aug-19 06:16 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

@Deleted User get a load of him

[04-Aug-19 06:17 PM] Lanii#8302
You were the one putting words into mine, I said if you are a pleb beliving the fact that btc is trash and alts are way better you deserve to get rekt. I never said poor people deserve to get rekt

[04-Aug-19 06:17 PM] Lanii#8302
You are accusing me of doing things that you yourself do

[04-Aug-19 06:18 PM] Lanii#8302
Im telling you, you are either pathetic or really fkn dumb. Or simply both

[04-Aug-19 06:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Hehe

[04-Aug-19 06:18 PM] Lanii#8302
Anyway Imma ignore you now, you provide no value what so ever, cya pleb

[04-Aug-19 06:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Got you dude

[04-Aug-19 06:20 PM] dan.#2473
I'm not even sure TA for alts matters at this point. Whales are doing what they want

[04-Aug-19 06:20 PM] nocturnal#2177
TA = tits and arse

[04-Aug-19 06:20 PM] Lanii#8302
sure thing

[04-Aug-19 06:21 PM] dan.#2473
Lol well then TA always matters

[04-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Lanii#8302
Ta matters if you want to protect your capital

[04-Aug-19 06:21 PM] dan.#2473
üòÇ

[04-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Lanii#8302
Example with kmd now

[04-Aug-19 06:21 PM] nocturnal#2177
im kidding haha

[04-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Markus#5464
i wonder what average age in this chat is, sometimes its getting rly  childish

[04-Aug-19 06:21 PM] nocturnal#2177
it just made me chuckle

[04-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Lanii#8302
you could wait for alts to show some strengh before entering

[04-Aug-19 06:21 PM] dan.#2473
Eleventeen maybe

[04-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Lanii#8302
And ensure you lose a certain % of capital if you were to be wrong with your analysis

[04-Aug-19 06:22 PM] Lanii#8302
Instead of entering blindly and getting rekt

[04-Aug-19 06:22 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
:troll_lol:

[04-Aug-19 06:22 PM] dan.#2473
Sure Lanii but I feel like some alts are just straight up ignoring moving averages I don't even look now. Just of it's trending up or down

[04-Aug-19 06:22 PM] actionslacks#4072
otc desks dont report to cmc

[04-Aug-19 06:22 PM] Lanii#8302
Im sorry to dissapoint you

[04-Aug-19 06:22 PM] Lanii#8302
but moving avegeres are a meme in my opinion

[04-Aug-19 06:23 PM] Lanii#8302
Its just something sold to retail to rek them

[04-Aug-19 06:23 PM] Lanii#8302
Idk why people expect a meme line to make them rich

[04-Aug-19 06:23 PM] Lanii#8302
Doesnt mean they never work

[04-Aug-19 06:23 PM] dan.#2473
Ok well makes sense because that is what I observe lately

[04-Aug-19 06:23 PM] Lanii#8302
They simply don't work enough for you to be profitable

[04-Aug-19 06:23 PM] Lanii#8302
if you want sucess with TA you need to work for it üòÉ

[04-Aug-19 06:23 PM] dan.#2473
It's totally ignored on every time frame
