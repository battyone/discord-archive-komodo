No evidence and no proof for fake claims of k64, liars together. The day will come, you will see, when the monkey is out of the sleeve.

K64 is probably a scam.

You buy K64 now at these prices, you'll probably make a lot of money, or lose a lot of money; no in between.

Just buy KMD

[08-Sep-19 08:23 PM] rikkert#6335
I can not say k64 is a scam, because it has many other people, they have office and some things, but all claims of investers, reports of values 1.3 miljard euros, all is lied and fake claims.

Give out evidence and proof for the claims @Deleted User , if you don't have it, go away and stay quiet. Don't convince people to lose more money, stop shilling.

[08-Sep-19 08:25 PM] allbits#5898
Stop shilling that coin here. KMD disavowed any connection to it

[08-Sep-19 08:26 PM] Geert#4612
I thank everyone for the information, i will make my research. Thank you @Deleted User and thank you also @rikkert for the pdf, i will read now and then do my own research.

Big lie
A big lie (German: große Lüge) is a propaganda technique and logical trick (fallacy). The expression was coined by Adolf Hitler, when he dictated his 1925 book Mein Kampf, about the use of a lie so "colossal" that no one would believe that someone "could have the impudence ...

Preemption of innocence is s principle in criminal law, not open debate. Are you that thick?

[08-Sep-19 08:32 PM] rikkert#6335
Peoples must wake up, stay away from k64, until the investers office, Goldman, speaks. Zo, never.

But he's not a state prosecuting a prisoner in danger of being locked up. Do you see the difference?

Those K64 bags are very heavy I'm guessing

[08-Sep-19 08:35 PM] allbits#5898
Bad choice since it doesn't apply here

[08-Sep-19 08:35 PM] allbits#5898
For example, civil lawsuits don't use the presumption of innocence. Do you see why?

[08-Sep-19 08:36 PM] allbits#5898
You apparently have no idea what you're talking about

[08-Sep-19 08:36 PM] Geert#4612
@rikkert this information is very detailed, thank you. But where is the claim because i can not find it on the website komodore64.com. And nothing is about Goldman and 1,3 billion euros value on the website. You say they say, but where they say?

[08-Sep-19 08:37 PM] Tek#5253
@Geert it's a scam run ;

@Geert A very trusted community member traveled there and saw/talked to various people and claimed that valuation of K64 was true. At this point people are waiting for official confirmation.

@Geert ask @Deleted User if he believes that K64 claims to have 78 million euro investment based on a 1.8 billion valuation. They certainly have been claiming it but have kept it out of public facing documents recently

[08-Sep-19 08:42 PM] Daniel CP#2020
The official Komodo statement on K64:

 Komodo’s overall goal is to provide developers with the ability to build independent and self-sovereign smart chains that avoid the reliance of single-chain blockchain platforms. As such, Komodo has in no way endorsed the Komodore64(K64) project, nor are we responsible for vetting projects that build on Komodo’s open source technology. We are deeply concerned with several seemingly false statements made by members of the K64 team regarding project investments and we strongly advise those interested in participating in their project to practice extreme caution and due diligence ahead of time.

If the valuation of K64 is true, it could go 10 or 20X, if not then it's worthless.

The k64 ceo, have said, they have contracts that under no circumstances, authorise to publish the informations. Let’s forget all for a moment the ridiculous and unrealistic high valuation and investment volume that is a lie. How is it that k64 is authorised to present the reports and documents to KomodoWorld and he can publish the subject matter? This had been pointed out by someone else previously. Many weeks gone by, and more to pass, 1 week is passing, 2 weeks are passing, and in 4 weeks still there will not be an announcement made from the real investers.

@Deleted User 78 million euros startup funding for k64 company?

How much revenue they made in the last year 2018? And when did they got the funding?

[08-Sep-19 08:47 PM] rikkert#6335
I’m amazed that this legally doesn’t violate the contracts of E & Y and Goldman with k64? And would not it be equal when this E & Y report was published directly from k64? Apropos, that would have saved k64 from great damage, and stopped all current problems, before they arise.. First and foremost, the problem with RedFOX and Komodo. Use your loaf 🙂
