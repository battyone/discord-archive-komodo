@jl777c will it be possible to run a website on a blockchain? Maybe it already is

[01-May-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
sure

[01-May-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure how practical it is but website is data, blockchain can store that data

[01-May-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but the active stuff will require the code also, which is another type of data

[01-May-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so a lot of details, but nothing prevents it

[01-May-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess DNS is a bit of an issue

[01-May-19 12:34 PM] Markus#5464
so if u can run a website on a blockchain, would it be a problem for lets say government if someone runs a drug store, would it be possible to take it down?

[01-May-19 12:35 PM] Tek#5253
in 3 months XMR will have less inflation than BTC

[01-May-19 12:36 PM] Tek#5253
ü§î go into xmr 10 days before inflation of xmr is lower than buttcones

[01-May-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
@Markus depends on the blockchain

[01-May-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
you are asking which blockchains can the govt (which one?) take down

[01-May-19 12:39 PM] Tek#5253
@Markus you can save data in a blokchain, then have a website that pulls it

[01-May-19 12:43 PM] Tek#5253
I believe ENJ is already having tradable in game items

[01-May-19 12:44 PM] Markus#5464
pretty sure something like that could blow up real quick

[01-May-19 12:45 PM] Tek#5253
yay

I'm populating browser django components using on chain data storeid in oraclesCC. no reason you couldnt store the raw html, but seems more efficient to just use django templates which reference a batonutxo (or an array of batonutxos) to fill out the dynamic components.

[01-May-19 01:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
There can be a load delay if grabbing too much data though. I clocked calling around 900 `oraclesinfo` at 42 sec (21.5 oracles/sec) which is too long for a webpage to load. workaround is to cron the data into a local json file for site to reference.

[01-May-19 01:14 PM] Markus#5464
i see

[01-May-19 01:14 PM] Markus#5464
interesting

[01-May-19 01:32 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
this is the page - http://oracle.earth/
it's basically every oracle on LABs assetchains. gettting the data for each row was an RPC call (plus the initial RPC call to get all the oracletxids)

The ratio of physical to paper gold is like 1:200.

[01-May-19 04:49 PM] Tek#5253
paper gold is like the second layer.

hey - that is an interesting topic- it probably will belong to #random, buuuut: before speculating about the pyramids purpose, it is neccessary to posit that they were _not_ built by the dynastic egyptians!!! all else is getting ahead of oneself and going nowhere except the loonie bins prepared for this purpsoe by corrupt academic circles..

[01-May-19 05:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
it was built during written history which gives more strength to the Egyptian built argument

@Deleted User eh. I am pretty woke about a lot of stuff. Pyramids were not build by humans

[01-May-19 05:13 PM] Tek#5253
The simply didn't have the tech to build them. mind you they didn't even have a valid way to measure things back then. there was no Meter

first of all: the age of the Sphinx is much larger than 4500 years. much much older that thing

[01-May-19 05:23 PM] LocoMB#8593
at least 12,000 years

second- the dynastic egyptians did not have the technology to build them. they just found them and graffittied their names on some parts of them
