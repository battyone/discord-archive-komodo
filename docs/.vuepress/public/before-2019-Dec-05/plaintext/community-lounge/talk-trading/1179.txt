BCH +21% 😬

[25-Oct-19 05:17 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
BTC starts pumping as soon as China said they want to be leading in blockchain field.

[25-Oct-19 05:21 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
$8700

[25-Oct-19 05:21 PM] Neko#5830
i love how btc just invalidates half of the TAs in a few hours

[25-Oct-19 05:22 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Bitcoin pumps when big btc bag holders have paid their monthly or bimonthly bills.

[25-Oct-19 05:22 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Then it goes up & everyone smiles and buys

[25-Oct-19 05:23 PM] Privatoshi#9487
When a hint of stagnation can be seen, we're going to $3k

[25-Oct-19 05:23 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Meanwhile they increase their BTC holding substantially

[25-Oct-19 05:25 PM] Privatoshi#9487
If you think average buyers can move us from $8k to $13.2k, in a few weeks, you're naive

[25-Oct-19 05:25 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
maybe 4chan dude is a super whale

[25-Oct-19 05:26 PM] Privatoshi#9487
4chan is where they run their operations fo influence the easily influencable

[25-Oct-19 05:26 PM] tolken#2655
Btc’s got a rager goin on.

If KMD requires GAS, like ETH but in KMD, it would've created a token use

[25-Oct-19 05:29 PM] Privatoshi#9487
If you want to sell a NFT in ETH, or make a DAI CDP, you have to have ETH

[25-Oct-19 05:29 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yes, that's why ETH is bloated

[25-Oct-19 05:29 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Agreed

[25-Oct-19 05:29 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I don't like ETH tbh

[25-Oct-19 05:29 PM] Privatoshi#9487
But you need it to do any of that stuff

[25-Oct-19 05:30 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Komodo tech is creative & I think some of the best out there

[25-Oct-19 05:31 PM] Privatoshi#9487
But the coin itself lacked a use case, until AtomicDex

[25-Oct-19 05:32 PM] debaas#3337
Btc looked bearish, this is pure fomo because of china

[25-Oct-19 05:33 PM] Neko#5830
AtomicDex is the GAS

[25-Oct-19 05:34 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
then you should check out Veruscoin , In it's pBaaS, you will need vrsc to launch your own chain / coin, without the bloat like ETH. @Privatoshi

[25-Oct-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to view KMD as an ecosystem, already over 50 chains with dPoW and countless others in dev stage without dPoW. https://dexstats.info/explorers.php
each chain is independent and precisely "sharded", overall capacity is over 10,000 tx per second (assuming 200 tx/sec for 50 chains)
this is live for over a year, it is easily scalable to an arbitrary number of chains (tx/sec or shard equivalents), without the issues that a sharded solution needs.
i will not make KMD into a tax collecting coin

[25-Oct-19 05:39 PM] Lanii#8302
@debaas Just because btc looked bearish doesnt mean you cant get a pump after dumping almost 50%

[25-Oct-19 05:39 PM] Lanii#8302
If you shorted and got rekt, well then you deserved it

[25-Oct-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
by default most all the chains in the ecosystem will end up using KMD as a currency of exchange with people in the ecosystem. there are other use cases, but i think the biggest one will simply be more and more people using KMD to transact with, as their chain is a komodod runtime fork. so the more chains in the ecosystem, with the more people on those teams, the more usage KMD will get

[25-Oct-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, this is not the taxation model that most people seem to like

[25-Oct-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
i was on the other side of this equation when I was developing on NXT. and sure enough, the rules were changed and the taxes went up so high, the dapps became nonviable

[25-Oct-19 05:43 PM] Markus#5464
Dont get all too excited about BTC just yet, watch this first :)

KMD needs to be the tax free platform, i think it is the only one. KMD does have the 5% active user rewards, which is more than most other platform coins. also the atomicDEX dexfees will all be converted into KMD for distribution, so that creates buying pressure. We also have in testing defi chains, that will lock KMD in order to be able to use them

[25-Oct-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
the single chain taxation model "works" if your goal is to make the most demand in the short term, until the chain bogs down and becomes nonviable to be used. eventually, only low frequency/high value transactions that dont mind paying $5 will be left

[25-Oct-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
THAT is not how blockchains will scale to the mass market

[25-Oct-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
the recent price action is global across all alts, some have done much worse than KMD, some have done a bit better.

[25-Oct-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless of the market, i will not support KMD adding taxes to use

[25-Oct-19 05:46 PM] Lanii#8302
@Markus yeh, I wouldnt be excited now, unless I was looking to short ^^

[25-Oct-19 05:46 PM] Lanii#8302
However if we get 7.8-8k I'll be excited

[25-Oct-19 05:47 PM] Lanii#8302
@jl777c Kmd great coin however its such sadness to see it getting rekt even compared to other shitcoins

[25-Oct-19 05:47 PM] Markus#5464
@jl777c wouldnt tax version of blockchain work if u make a cluster of blockchains?

[25-Oct-19 05:47 PM] Lanii#8302
Kmd printing new lows over and over while some other coins  are doing smth

[25-Oct-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
most of the crypto projects now are like very fancy looking cars, the only issue is that maybe the engine doesnt work so well, or maybe there is no engine at all. with KMD we are constantly deploying new tech and pushing the boundaries of the blockchain tech

[25-Oct-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
@Markus charging KMD for every transaction of a smartchain, that is what i mean by taxation. That would make most usage nonviable, especially during the early days. it is important that each smartchain not be burdened with paying a hardcost for each transaction

[25-Oct-19 05:49 PM] Markus#5464
Alright 😛

[25-Oct-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind this is all open source, companies are forking ETH and not using the public chain, due to the txfees

[25-Oct-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
if the txfees are an issue, it will likely just be forked anyway

@jl777c  if the main place of using KMD is DEX on which we may not see liquidity for a very long time, then the same BNB takes big steps to use and trade their token! Just who will explain to people why it is more profitable for them to use kmd for bidding than bnb or btc? ETH has already considered the issue of economic abstraction, but here we have it in its purest form - probably the only thing that has not yet made the last holders to sell is 5% reward! But the same Qtum does the same and the trading volume is 10 times higher! There are many innovations and there is no marketing - except for rare interviews that are watched only by KMD cipher banks and scammers! Initially, we at least had a stake on confidentiality but removed it by transferring it to pirates who might die due to the competition of stronger confidential coins - they simply do not give listing on exchanges and a significant trump card is lost - but it remained with competitors HORIZEN and others! MetalX also agreed with regulators and launch the exchange! What about us? The Komodo project itself, as an exchange and infrastructure, is good and good as a sidechain, but the KMD token itself - what does it do better than the top 10 cryptocurrencies? Without an influx of investment, competitors will eat us up and we will repeat the fate of OBITS - where everything also started well, but in the end the project almost died - although the technologies there are also excellent! If in the Komodo ecosystem it is equally possible to use more liquid and growing assets, then why should tokens be used by institutional?

@BlackJesus  corporate world, bah lol

[25-Oct-19 10:56 PM] actionslacks#4072
@Flint kyc/aml regulations for the atomic dex are not currently applicable as it is non custodial.  Handing a large percentage of your project's capital and coin supply over to centralized exchanges in exchange for a higher spot on the cmc is a pretty pointless endevour when you are busy building the software to make their custodial systems largely obsolete.

[25-Oct-19 11:16 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
@Flint kmd is a solid project but no there is nothing whatsoever that says it must succeed

[25-Oct-19 11:16 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
most alts will burn

[25-Oct-19 11:16 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
kmd has a chande

[25-Oct-19 11:16 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
chance

[25-Oct-19 11:17 PM] Privatoshi#9487
KMD is fine.

[25-Oct-19 11:17 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
just depends if anyone actually starts usuing it or not

[25-Oct-19 11:17 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
yes its fine

[25-Oct-19 11:17 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
is fine good?

[25-Oct-19 11:17 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
depends

[25-Oct-19 11:18 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
time will tell

[25-Oct-19 11:18 PM] Privatoshi#9487
So JL and the other Devs, they're supposed to work on everything, and be expected to market,  or shoulder the blame that some of you aren't happy bc the price has dropped--like every single other crypto

[25-Oct-19 11:19 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
im not sure if you are replying t me or flint, but yes a project must have devs and marketing

[25-Oct-19 11:19 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
for sure

[25-Oct-19 11:19 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
you cant have one and not the other and succeed

[25-Oct-19 11:19 PM] Privatoshi#9487
They have done and continue to do great work. AtomicDex is something I've waited for for a few years now, and it is as good as I ever expected

[25-Oct-19 11:19 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
thats just a reality

[25-Oct-19 11:20 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Atomic Swaps is something that drew me to KMD

[25-Oct-19 11:20 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
it is not unique to kmd at all

[25-Oct-19 11:20 PM] Privatoshi#9487
And they completed tons of other projects, as well

[25-Oct-19 11:20 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Go read your history

[25-Oct-19 11:20 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
but kmd has a high output of innovation

[25-Oct-19 11:20 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
comapred to most cryptos

[25-Oct-19 11:20 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
so they have a beter chance than most

[25-Oct-19 11:21 PM] Privatoshi#9487
They never stop working

[25-Oct-19 11:21 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Or thinking, they're creative too

[25-Oct-19 11:21 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
you cant hold crypto companies to lower standards than normal companies
