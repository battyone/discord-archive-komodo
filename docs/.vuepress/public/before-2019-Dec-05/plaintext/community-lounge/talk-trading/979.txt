[29-Jul-19 02:15 PM] Markus#5464
US ppl cant use Binance and u shouldnt put big amounts on a beta version that have bugs

[29-Jul-19 02:16 PM] Markus#5464

[29-Jul-19 02:21 PM] p.#1126

LAWL

[29-Jul-19 02:21 PM] p.#1126
and how many ppl even care about dex or atomic swaps

[29-Jul-19 02:22 PM] p.#1126
isn't atomic swaps like last year's news?

[29-Jul-19 02:22 PM] p.#1126
not fudding just wondering

[29-Jul-19 02:23 PM] Markus#5464
dont think atomic swaps is main thing they want to showcase

[29-Jul-19 02:23 PM] Markus#5464
but rather a decentralized exchange

[29-Jul-19 02:25 PM] Markus#5464
that also work on mobile

[29-Jul-19 02:26 PM] p.#1126
idex?

[29-Jul-19 02:26 PM] p.#1126
already been like 3 years

[29-Jul-19 02:26 PM] Markus#5464
there is no other atomic swap exchange i think

[29-Jul-19 02:26 PM] Markus#5464
only token dex

[29-Jul-19 02:26 PM] p.#1126
ahhh

[29-Jul-19 02:26 PM] Markus#5464
and they require money transmitter license

[29-Jul-19 02:26 PM] p.#1126
okok i cant read so i dont know these stuffs

[29-Jul-19 02:26 PM] Markus#5464
atomic swap require nothing

[29-Jul-19 02:26 PM] p.#1126

[29-Jul-19 02:27 PM] Caglio#3337

[29-Jul-19 02:27 PM] Caglio#3337
i expect komodo booming, when btc becomes stable coin

[29-Jul-19 02:28 PM] Markus#5464
i gave up having hopes for kmd price.....i will let it stay in ledger either crashing or booming

[29-Jul-19 02:28 PM] Caglio#3337
maybe bitcoin should get ideas by nature

[29-Jul-19 02:28 PM] Caglio#3337

[29-Jul-19 02:29 PM] Markus#5464

[29-Jul-19 02:29 PM] Caglio#3337

Markus don't be so sensitive

[29-Jul-19 02:33 PM] Markus#5464

[29-Jul-19 02:33 PM] Caglio#3337
Yup

[29-Jul-19 02:33 PM] Markus#5464

[29-Jul-19 02:33 PM] Caglio#3337

[29-Jul-19 02:33 PM] Caglio#3337
If I could I would, believe me bro

[29-Jul-19 02:33 PM] Markus#5464

[29-Jul-19 02:34 PM] Caglio#3337
good plan

[29-Jul-19 02:34 PM] p.#1126
for me , if thats the logo, why not rebrand name too , that logo has like nothing that resembles a komodo anything

[29-Jul-19 02:34 PM] p.#1126
but whatever just a logo

[29-Jul-19 02:35 PM] p.#1126
:troll_hmm:

[29-Jul-19 02:35 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@dan. fuck that logo looks appealing

[29-Jul-19 02:35 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Is it icon ?

[29-Jul-19 02:35 PM] dan.#2473
Seems to be Antara's branding logo, I think

[29-Jul-19 02:36 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Damn it's nice

[29-Jul-19 02:37 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Should be main logo???

[29-Jul-19 02:37 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Can we vote on this

[29-Jul-19 02:38 PM] dan.#2473
I don't think that'd be possible at this point, there was a lot of planning

[29-Jul-19 02:40 PM] p.#1126

[29-Jul-19 02:41 PM] p.#1126
and the lack of activity here is also discouraging

[29-Jul-19 02:44 PM] dan.#2473
back in slack days it was called tradebots, and it turned into bdex and trading talk, which didnt really make too much sense, but it worked well.

[29-Jul-19 02:44 PM] p.#1126
