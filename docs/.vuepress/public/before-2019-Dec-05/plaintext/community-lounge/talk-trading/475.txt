[15-Mar-19 11:10 AM] Keppie#5156
It pops up for a sec on the orderbook & vanishes

[15-Mar-19 11:10 AM] Keppie#5156

[15-Mar-19 11:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Confirmations talking to long`
The cure for that is to have a "trading amount" of coinage 😉

[15-Mar-19 11:30 AM] Tek#5253
be glad frens atleast you don't sell early.

[15-Mar-19 11:30 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Haha yeah true... I wasn't planning on trading again this soon and I don't like keeping my money on exchanges

[15-Mar-19 11:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the "trading amount" = what you're willing to lose 
then just funnel profits back into your own wallet(s)

`I panic bought some KMD bags at 29k`
It was 25 3 hrs ago, why would you *buy* at 29? 😕

[15-Mar-19 12:11 PM] modereck#4269
think he means to sell at that price

[15-Mar-19 12:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think he's clowning and meant what he wrote but didn't actually do it

[15-Mar-19 12:14 PM] dokrates#8987
someone is accumulating komodos very hard

[15-Mar-19 12:14 PM] dokrates#8987
soon it will go over 50k sat

[15-Mar-19 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
50k would be nice for me, especially if *before* I buy equipment

[15-Mar-19 12:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As long as we hit 100KMD sats before BTC goes parabolic, I’m cool. 😊

Anyone know of any private islands for sale?   Preferably with pirate ship included?

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 lol you should read I wasn't the one who panic bought

[15-Mar-19 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Anyone know of any private islands for sale? `
If I find one, I'm buying it with my COQUI

[15-Mar-19 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Sherdogz Of that I have no doubt, I just find it hard to believe that a regular in here did
