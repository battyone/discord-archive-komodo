its easy to be a general now, I was greedy, but everyone was like its the next best thing

[13-Aug-19 11:48 AM] Markus#5464
well i dont believe in things before i actually see it happen, until then its just words and hype which usually end up let say not so well

[13-Aug-19 11:48 AM] Caglio#3337
yeah like k64 will

[13-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Caglio#3337
and their revolutionary atomic bomberman

[13-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Caglio#3337
you need to have voodoo 3dfx graphic card to play

[13-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Markus#5464
great example is Pirate, its a great product but the hype when it launched was insane

[13-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Caglio#3337
hype is real with every single shit coin

[13-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Caglio#3337
as the shitcoin discord channels

[13-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Caglio#3337
all are easily top 10 coins

[13-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Caglio#3337
all are dead shit actually

[13-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Caglio#3337
in the sea of other coins

[13-Aug-19 11:50 AM] Caglio#3337
worthless shit noone will ever use

[13-Aug-19 11:50 AM] Caglio#3337
because noone needs them

[13-Aug-19 11:50 AM] Markus#5464
i believe there is very few selected coins that will make it

[13-Aug-19 11:53 AM] Caglio#3337
I agree with that

[13-Aug-19 11:53 AM] Caglio#3337
And that is realistic

[13-Aug-19 11:54 AM] Caglio#3337
Need for 2500 coins, with the number growing each day

[13-Aug-19 11:54 AM] Caglio#3337
Is just retarded

[13-Aug-19 11:54 AM] Markus#5464
thats why i think KMD have a bright future, it does not have same usecase like lets say litecoin and bch

[13-Aug-19 11:54 AM] Caglio#3337
Specially cos only use of those coins, at least for now, is trading them for money

[13-Aug-19 11:54 AM] Caglio#3337
We will see about KMD

[13-Aug-19 11:54 AM] Caglio#3337
Somehow I can see it here in many years from now

[13-Aug-19 11:54 AM] Caglio#3337
But I can also see it having shitty price all those years

[13-Aug-19 11:55 AM] Caglio#3337
constantly developing something, but not moving price with it

[13-Aug-19 11:55 AM] Markus#5464
why would it have a shitty price over next years when we are in a bull cycle?

[13-Aug-19 11:55 AM] Caglio#3337
we just went from 1.80 to 0.80 in this bull cycle

[13-Aug-19 11:55 AM] Markus#5464
and?

[13-Aug-19 11:55 AM] Caglio#3337
now imagine we switch to bear cycle again

[13-Aug-19 11:55 AM] Markus#5464
u should educate urself how market cycles work

[13-Aug-19 11:56 AM] Markus#5464
does not work like that

[13-Aug-19 01:51 PM] Markus#5464

[13-Aug-19 01:51 PM] Caglio#3337
Some ltc, some komodo, some ethereum, some dash, and some IOTA

[13-Aug-19 01:51 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Tek it needs no constant shilling though b

[13-Aug-19 01:51 PM] Tek#5253
dash has many fiat pairings

[13-Aug-19 01:51 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
No matter how subtle

[13-Aug-19 01:51 PM] Tek#5253
you'll see what gets bought when the next bullrun / top starts

[13-Aug-19 01:52 PM] Caglio#3337

[13-Aug-19 01:52 PM] Tek#5253

[13-Aug-19 01:52 PM] Markus#5464

[13-Aug-19 01:54 PM] Markus#5464
Atleast he made a killing selling at 300, probably accumulated all that below 3$

[13-Aug-19 01:56 PM] Caglio#3337
Its nice to see jl shilling ltc

[13-Aug-19 01:56 PM] Caglio#3337
Its an amazing coin, that also did a logo rebrand

[13-Aug-19 01:56 PM] Caglio#3337

[13-Aug-19 02:03 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Look at chart

[13-Aug-19 02:03 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
But I find it an unusual slow drop

[13-Aug-19 02:03 PM] Markus#5464
Yes looking all i can see is a healthy pullback

[13-Aug-19 02:04 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Delusional

[13-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Markus#5464
going from 9k to 12k

[13-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Markus#5464
its not very strange to see a pullback

[13-Aug-19 02:05 PM] Markus#5464
