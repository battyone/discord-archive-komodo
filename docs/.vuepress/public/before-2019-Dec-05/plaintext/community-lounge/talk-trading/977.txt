about new developer docs

[28-Jul-19 02:46 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
is it just me or is k64 overhyped on this channel

[28-Jul-19 02:47 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
i mean theres a lot of competing projects in the blockchain gaming space

[28-Jul-19 02:47 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
and theyve made some real headway in terms of public awareness

[28-Jul-19 02:47 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
what makes k64 special

[28-Jul-19 02:52 PM] tolken#2655
No idea what makes it special. They haven’t really done a good job explaining how or why people should use it - yet. At the bare minimum, it’s special because it’s the only project of its kind that leveraged Kmd, which will let it scale in ways many other projects can’t.

[28-Jul-19 02:53 PM] bishop#9773
I own some but it certainly comes across as more hype than substance. Conflicting information seems to be put out as well and no one really clarifies much of anything.... just the standard wait for more information to be released.

[28-Jul-19 02:54 PM] bishop#9773
And for the size of the team, it seems pretty crazy they are aiming for that many games when they don't have anything to show at this time

[28-Jul-19 02:54 PM] bishop#9773
I'm basically taking a wait-and-see-approach, but certainly not adding anymore

[28-Jul-19 02:56 PM] tolken#2655
It is weird to me that they’re making all these games rarher than just making at least one as a proof of concept and learning from it.

[28-Jul-19 02:56 PM] Neko#5830
>it’s the only project of its kind that leveraged Kmd, which will let it scale in ways many other projects can’t

[28-Jul-19 02:56 PM] Neko#5830
basically this

[28-Jul-19 02:58 PM] tolken#2655
Maybe proof of gameplay is exciting to some people - but maybe it isn’t. I guess@we’ll see.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 nothing makes btc special, other than the fact thst it was the first. since it was the first more people know it and have it. for new startups entering the space, especially in a compettuve cateogry such as gaminng, there is a high level of scrutiny

[28-Jul-19 03:34 PM] Markus#5464
looks like something is about to happen

[28-Jul-19 03:34 PM] Markus#5464
i quess nobody would be surprised if it dumps

[28-Jul-19 03:35 PM] Markus#5464
low volume tho

[28-Jul-19 03:35 PM] Markus#5464
so something is cooking

[28-Jul-19 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, there's your answer:
It's special because some people think it's special

[28-Jul-19 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it could have been just as easily been named `000004379b8ecffefa1da0dec48961bf4ddddb3c3efc147be482e4400441b2ec` and done the same thing

Marketcap of usd is higher than btc whatever usd tech is not very well documented nor its (recent) stats. I found no github no explorer and no blockchain of usd. Why comparing tech when it comes to prices ? XVG have a twitter army and poor tech but its marketcap is comparable to kmd. Or maybe the 1/tech theory is correct, I don t know

[28-Jul-19 03:51 PM] Markus#5464
never used LN probably never will i can wait and obviously wont spend btc on buying things with it

` obviously wont spend btc on buying things with it` not obvious to me?

[28-Jul-19 03:57 PM] Markus#5464
Also discussing what coins and tech or whatever is good and not never leads to anywhere....ppl will always defend their favourites

[28-Jul-19 03:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yeah, who wants to use a currency to buy things? That's just a stupid thing to do

[28-Jul-19 04:24 PM] Alecandro#1179

Trading on Exchanges dropping because of massive testing HyperDEX?

[28-Jul-19 04:34 PM] actionslacks#4072
you can break the law, enter the usa illegally, and the irs will gladly give you a tax id # and give you money every year. Now If you're a legal citizen who dares to speculate on an asset class that the ussa doesnt approve of, you will be targeted and labelled a criminal by the same orginazation. the moment of reckoning is coming.

I left a message to the IRS asking for clarity as I received a letter. I've filed my taxes to the best of my ability given their shitty guidance but they need to specifically tell me what years I need to pull shit out for to review for discrepancies to what they have. Going down the road of filing numerous amended returns when this  feels more like a fishing expedition from a mass mailing to all coinbase customers is silly

[28-Jul-19 04:38 PM] bishop#9773
Then you have all the exchanges that are no more over the years: cryptsy, mintpal, cryptopia, etc. If you didn't save down your trade history, well, you're fucked there

i get phishing emails from coinbase.cam, and all the other variations of their actual email on a regular basis. not only is their customer info apparently readily available the the irs, but to everyone else as well. I anticipate a wave of irs related scams related to this bs.

Why not make cryptos, you know their own type asset class and establish fair rules. Rules are hard to enforce but a million times harder when they make 0 sense

[28-Jul-19 05:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they're not intended to make sense
the whole point is to trip you up, charge you more, and increase revenue
far more "laws" and "regulations" are about creation of government revenue than anything else

[28-Jul-19 05:12 PM] dan.#2473
I'm sure and I tend to agree. The issue with cryptos is this is blatently evident, at least to people who really know the implications of cryptocurrency. I do think the US crypto rules will change due to this but maybe I'm a little too optimistic

[28-Jul-19 05:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the idea is two-fold, actually
the above and the more of a hassle it is, the less adoption will take place and the safer the Fed's hold on power is

[28-Jul-19 05:14 PM] dan.#2473
Definition of a crypto aside, If anything good comes out of things like libra, maybe it's the lobbying money to reform the tax statuses of crypto

[28-Jul-19 05:14 PM] dan.#2473
That's true too. The current status quo inhibits crypto activity

[28-Jul-19 05:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
libra will be an NSA/CIA controlled one-off that will have its own exemptions

[28-Jul-19 05:16 PM] dan.#2473
That may be the case too

[28-Jul-19 05:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not really a "may"
dude said in the hearing that they will not launch without congressional approval
and congress will not approve without governmental ability to enforce seizure and forfeiture

[28-Jul-19 05:24 PM] actionslacks#4072
so its a no go unless govt gets a node? and the ability to roll back transactions? do they even understand how this thing works?

by attacking american's access to crypto they are attacking crypto itself. I would imagine that the majority of crypto investment originates in the states.

[28-Jul-19 07:10 PM] Markus#5464
i think china and so on are way bigger then america when it comes to crypto investments

[28-Jul-19 07:25 PM] actionslacks#4072
Japan buys the most per capita, but when comparing the sheer amount of money thrown at it America has to be at least more than half. The U.S. has the highest number of cryptocurrency users, the highest number of Bitcoin ATMs and also the highest Bitcoin trading volumes globally.
