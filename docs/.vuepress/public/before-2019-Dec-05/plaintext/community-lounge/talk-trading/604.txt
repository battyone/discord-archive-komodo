millions of votes get thrown the last day

[05-May-19 12:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
we only have 14.25% votes cast

[05-May-19 12:58 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Last day will be big because the whales might have more than one person they want to win. Don't want to use your vote on someone that could have won without it your vote when the other lose because they didn't get your vote.

Markus maybe that will be the case in the future, but for now, I believe the 1 per region works okay. 
If you dont want to vote in people/teams that already have a node, then feel free. Have a think about the time/effort/commitment that they have shown over the year though. Maybe they deserve another node to support their income for all their hard work. 
Otherwise you could see what "new blood" is out there and see what they could bring to the ecosystem :)

diva bitch Charles 'I_AM_A_FRICKING_GENIUS' Hoskinson didn't get his pink crab truffles in time, so he threw a tantrum and locked himself in the bathroom- 
team hasn't been able to talk him into coming out again and continuing work
... team did manage to deliver his pink crab truffles, but he changed his mind and wants crisped jupiter antlers instead.. so, no such luck

`not feeling greatness in the name.` well done for basing decisions on names.. i bet komodo didn't sound too great either

binance bots seem to have gone into accumulation mode

[06-May-19 10:13 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The bots seem very convinced that kmd should be a stable coin

[06-May-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
throughout this BTC turbulence, KMD is if anything rising the CMC ranks, at least a little bit

[06-May-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
and that is despite a constant stream of new projects that appear with high marketcaps

[06-May-19 10:20 AM] Tek#5253
and despite the big KMD early birds basically selling their interests everyday

[06-May-19 10:20 AM] Tek#5253
nice.

[06-May-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
if you think big KMD holders are selling at these prices, it seems you dont understand many are holding from BTCD days and you need to compound it to get the 5.1%

[06-May-19 10:25 AM] Tek#5253
even better then.

[06-May-19 10:25 AM] Tek#5253
a coin with interests usually doesn't perform this decent. take a look at ark

[06-May-19 10:25 AM] Tek#5253
they have 10% rewards

[06-May-19 10:26 AM] Tek#5253
its tanking

[06-May-19 10:26 AM] Tek#5253
tfw used to hold ark

[06-May-19 10:26 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

i dont think 10% rewards are enough reason for a coin to go down

[06-May-19 10:27 AM] Tek#5253
Yeah I do, because of the name and bc its on its own address with an ERC20 I stored away ( RLC ) , might need the ETh for gas costs

[06-May-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe ark isnt doing as much as komodo?

[06-May-19 10:27 AM] Tek#5253
I'm pretty sure they aren't

[06-May-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
many people seem to think komodo isnt doing so well, but just to keep up with all the new projects with 50 mil+ funding and not dropping down the CMC rankings, that is not easy

I thought ark was that shitty houseboat coin?

[06-May-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
look at some of the past top 50 coins, like peercoin, counterparty, blackcoin

[06-May-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
and it doesnt matter if PoW, PoS, 10% rewards, etc.

[06-May-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a very crowded market

[06-May-19 10:28 AM] Tek#5253
its just that if there is no buyers and you have 10% rewards

[06-May-19 10:28 AM] Tek#5253
then it will dump hard cause most of the time rewards get sold

[06-May-19 10:29 AM] Tek#5253
pretty sure that there's ARK holders that bought the ICO ( 1 dollar cent )

[06-May-19 10:29 AM] Tek#5253
and just have been selling rewards forever

[06-May-19 10:29 AM] Tek#5253
oh wait it was 10 dollar cents

[06-May-19 10:30 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
