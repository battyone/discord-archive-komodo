IDEAS BY NATURE DO SOMETHING

[19-Jul-19 07:05 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Guys: if you truly lost faith in kmd then just sell your bags and be gone. This constant whining in here is toxic and doesnt help yourself or others.

[19-Jul-19 07:06 AM] CoinKing88#1540
If you really in to rebrandings and marketing over tech you should buy EOS and slowly watch that ship sink

[19-Jul-19 07:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Atomicdex peaked my kmd confidence even more

[19-Jul-19 07:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Like the logo and new website

[19-Jul-19 07:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
This is the long game

[19-Jul-19 07:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Not pump and dump type shit

[19-Jul-19 07:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If that is what you want buy trash like dash

[19-Jul-19 07:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
BOOOOM Cryptoon out bitchezzz

[19-Jul-19 07:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
in case you're new, most crypto hype is a lie. sometimes it seems no amount of earth shattering tech or news will moon kmd. but kmd will still exist when all the current mooned shitcoins are gone. then there will be all new shitcoins getting pumped. ad infinitum

[19-Jul-19 07:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We are where we are because of fundamentals. Tech and the promise of what it can bring has sustained our market position. Yes it sucks that our fiat and BTC value have gone down, but there are many other projects ahead of us in 2018 that are off the first 100 projects now.

[19-Jul-19 07:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Going from <50 to <20 is much easier than <200 to <20

[19-Jul-19 07:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So design decisions aside, if you dont believe in the tech, the team will disappoint you on hype/marketing. If you are in it for the tech and the betterment of this whole space, a misstep here and there is fine when the end result is revolutionary tech that has MASSIVE utility potential.

[19-Jul-19 07:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
mm 1.0 if we are honest, sucked, it was a let down. But without that experience would we have mm 2.0?

[19-Jul-19 07:28 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
the silence about Komodo from large twitter CT and VC, reddit and main crypto news websites is deafening. You could almost believe it didn't exist. Now I find it almost amusing, I know it will take time but everything is set for organic growth and continue improvements. The amazing thing is there are actual products being built on it while so few are taking notice.

The whole point here is we get a POC out, the iterate until we get it to a point where normal users can use it. If we dont do that, we are not innovating, we are just coping what others have done. As i said many times before, we are designing things for the future, not the present. This is how you will know that we will be in a great position when the need becomes apparent.

DEX may not have been a critical need a year ago, CEX is fine, but in the next 6 months is where the war with crypto will start. As much hype and marketing you may have for a project, if you cannot fulfill the needs of the users, they will migrate to someone that can. This is where we are at right now.

[19-Jul-19 08:04 AM] luca_skywalker#0887
any useful dex where I can buy kmd? Or do I need to wait for atomicDEX

[19-Jul-19 08:09 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

[19-Jul-19 08:15 AM] Tek#5253

[19-Jul-19 08:16 AM] Tek#5253
before it was only cheaper to use and fast, instantly transactable.
