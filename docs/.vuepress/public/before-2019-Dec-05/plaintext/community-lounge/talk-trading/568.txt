@Hollowman9000 hand in hand like McDonald's and Burger King

[19-Apr-19 11:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
They both make shitty hamburgers?

[19-Apr-19 11:52 PM] Alright#0419
ie direct competitor

[19-Apr-19 11:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It was a cordial exchange, don‚Äôt get your panties in a bunch

[19-Apr-19 11:54 PM] Alright#0419
Mike keeps the non-cordial exchanges to PMs

[19-Apr-19 11:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Can‚Äôt know what I haven‚Äôt been presented

[20-Apr-19 12:26 AM] jspook16#3059
So it's not a good relationship?

[20-Apr-19 03:00 AM] klein#5233
is there anywhere I can see DEX historical traded prices

[20-Apr-19 03:03 AM] klein#5233
was 9.071912 the last traded price?

[20-Apr-19 03:06 AM] klein#5233
(the coin itself)
was that roughly its average traded price?

[20-Apr-19 06:58 AM] jorian#4555
It used to be much higher, i remember 30KMD

[20-Apr-19 06:59 AM] jorian#4555
some were sold for 22 KMD just a month ago

[20-Apr-19 06:59 AM] jorian#4555
the price that is on barterdex might not be the market price, since barterdex doesn't have liquidity

[20-Apr-19 08:24 AM] klein#5233
thanks

[20-Apr-19 08:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If you want to buy/sell asking here might give you a good indication on price

@Hollowman9000 did Mike just ask jl to connect offline?

New kmd ecosystem project it seems

[20-Apr-19 08:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Sick team üëÄ

[20-Apr-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
just one of many projects that have been developing on KMD. and people wonder how KMD benefits from the ecosystem getting bigger? imagine thousands of such projects, none of them suffering from massive GAS costs

[20-Apr-19 09:13 AM] Markus#5464
Looks like were printing bullflag on daily chart

[20-Apr-19 09:37 AM] klein#5233
is there visibility to the coins dex is holding from fees, apart from the KMD richlist?

[20-Apr-19 09:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@jl777c yeah was talking to @Malti who was saying that big projects are using private blockchains on hyperledger etc. Told him for all we know there are already hundreds of companies using kmd tech as it‚Äôs so easy to just fork off the open source tech and start using it out of the box

[20-Apr-19 09:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If not thousands...

[20-Apr-19 09:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Once they want to go public chain and might use dpow for protection etc, or want to start communicating they will need more kmd tech and/or services and again the ecosystem as a whole wins

[20-Apr-19 09:40 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I mean technically they can protect themselves with dpow if they fork the source code

[20-Apr-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
they dont even have to make a source code fork

[20-Apr-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
just a runtime fork and they are up and running

[20-Apr-19 09:51 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
A little know how, a runtime fork, edit the pubkeys and off to the races?

[20-Apr-19 09:52 AM] Malti#3948
Its just a shame to see that everybody likes  hyperledger, corda & digital asset so much

[20-Apr-19 09:52 AM] Malti#3948
I work together now with guys from IntellectEU and they too like those best .. don‚Äôt get why

[20-Apr-19 09:53 AM] gcharang#6833

@Malti keep plugging the truely good stuff now and then

[20-Apr-19 09:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
become manager and make the executive decision to guide everyone to freedom :p

[20-Apr-19 09:57 AM] Malti#3948
The problem is that as soon as I start talking about kmd, people immediately assume I‚Äôm a bagholder and just pumping mah bags

[20-Apr-19 09:57 AM] Malti#3948
Which is not entirely untrue of course

[20-Apr-19 09:58 AM] Malti#3948
But still üí©

[20-Apr-19 10:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Start leaving copies of the whitepaper everywhere

[20-Apr-19 10:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[20-Apr-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
even the next WP is already obsolete by all the current enhancements due to complete this summer

Everytime BTC is in a critical zone KMD becomes so weak when it comes to buy power :/

[20-Apr-19 12:26 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
My KMD has plenty of buy power; but, then again, I don't deal with BTC outside of market trades üòõ

[20-Apr-19 12:27 PM] Markus#5464
Cause now it seems like KMD getting bullied on again when BTC battle with fib lvl

of the last 100 days, it's only been the last 20 where there's been any significant divergence and that's all been since that 1 major KMD dump day

the chart I shared was done few days ago sorry but I wonder if resistance was involved if the raise of price you're talking about

[20-Apr-19 09:48 PM] Markus#5464
there is resistance at 23k

@FishyGuts i tried to reference the original superNET DPoW whitepaper in my HUSH whitepaper but the link is dead and so it won't render in my references, FYI. It would be nice to be able to reference and point to a DPoW whitepaper. It could mention all the coins which are protected by DPoW now, too
