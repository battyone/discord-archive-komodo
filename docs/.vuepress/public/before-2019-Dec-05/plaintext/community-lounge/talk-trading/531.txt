Giving dwy some love ‚úåÔ∏è

We all waited for the bull market, and now it's here, and we are all destroyed.

[10-Apr-19 11:54 PM] eschata#4715
Doesn't it hurt to see, finally to see the bitcoin chart go up, and the komodo chart go down? That hurts.... That's all I wanted to say...

[10-Apr-19 11:58 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not really

[10-Apr-19 11:58 PM] eschata#4715
How so?

[10-Apr-19 11:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I look at a longer time frame

[11-Apr-19 12:04 AM] eschata#4715
That's true. That's why I didn't sell any of my kmd. But still...okay, I am hyperbolic.... I think we will hit a bottom and go up again....but do you disagee with me? I can imagine that more people feel like me...and that is what I wanted to express....not everyone is a developer....some of us are silly traders that really believe in komodo...so, yes, it must have hurt for investers than me....But yes, I think we are having a correction....if you zoom out than everything looks fine....Still,....for now, it sucks...

Its always like this, not sure about why there are long faces

[11-Apr-19 12:11 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Or am i the only one who remembers how kkd behaved in 2017?

It was huge...almost 20 dollar....And I think we can easily surpass that. But traders have feelings too. I notice that most people are very rational here,, or at least try.....So, let me express my disdain or whatever about the price right now. I just really think the prices at this moment suck...Komodo should be at least 0.01 BTC.

Define organic

[11-Apr-19 12:24 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If by organic you mean more fresh usd entering the market, then yes. Just look at the premium of USD markets vs USDT or whatever other usd token

[11-Apr-19 12:25 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If you see the fiat gateway exchanges at a higher premium than non fiat gateway exchanges, then yes, its new money coming in.

[11-Apr-19 12:29 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Doubt and uncertainty are common qualities of the first stages of any trend change

[11-Apr-19 12:30 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is why for example a leading diagonal got formed as a wave one in kmd

[11-Apr-19 12:30 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
There is still uncertainty about what the larger trend will do

[11-Apr-19 12:37 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is what waves actually represent: market mentality. If you dont understand that, then you wont understand TA.

one of these things is not like the other one

[11-Apr-19 12:38 AM] klein#5233
other of these things doesn't belong

[11-Apr-19 12:39 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You mean the double bottom of kmd

[11-Apr-19 12:39 AM] klein#5233
no

[11-Apr-19 12:40 AM] klein#5233
it didn't make lower lows

[11-Apr-19 12:41 AM] klein#5233
it showed strength

[11-Apr-19 12:42 AM] klein#5233
while every other shitcoin was showing weakness as well

[11-Apr-19 12:47 AM] Alecandro#1179
Love my KMD, I‚Äôm feeling positive about it. Time for next leg up soon I‚Äôm sure

[11-Apr-19 12:49 AM] klein#5233
I also think that part the reason you are seeing these lagging pumps in mid and larger cap coins is from dumb money crytpo funds

[11-Apr-19 12:49 AM] klein#5233
piling in after the  fact on this recent bullish sentiment change

[11-Apr-19 12:50 AM] klein#5233
Those same coins weren't showing strength in the november december lows

[11-Apr-19 12:59 AM] Vertigo#0439
Looks like everyone is dumping alts

Waiting for a BTC run?

[11-Apr-19 01:00 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Imo kmd is forming its own supports independently of how btc moves

[11-Apr-19 01:00 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Of course the bigger leader is btc, but technically, kmd is forming its own case

[11-Apr-19 01:04 AM] Alecandro#1179
Yea I have to agree

[11-Apr-19 01:04 AM] Vertigo#0439
Looks like is forming his own case but down . :troll:

RSI on 1H and 4H oversold

[11-Apr-19 01:21 AM] Alecandro#1179
Almost oversold on daily as well

[11-Apr-19 01:32 AM] Strob#3417
I did not see this too often: KMD down but ARRR making a big jump. At one point it was at least 66% up and now still 28% up according to Coinpaprika even though the ARRR wallet is disabled since  last friday on Crypto-Bridge. I just bought more KMD.

[11-Apr-19 01:32 AM] Alecandro#1179
