unless we break it and start to hug the previous resistance as support and slide it down

[19-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Markus#5464
that would be funny

[19-Aug-19 03:07 PM] Matthias#2174
$0.03 on daily chart is a key support for ARRR. If it holds that level, it could signal a bottom and start its ascent to the Moon. If it drops below, god knows where it's going to head to.

[19-Aug-19 03:07 PM] richardt#2807
So you're saying it could go up, or it could go down?

[19-Aug-19 03:07 PM] richardt#2807
nice

[19-Aug-19 03:08 PM] richardt#2807
very insightful

I‚Äôm no Nostradamus. Just saying 0.03 is key support

[19-Aug-19 03:12 PM] tolken#2655
@richardt no, that‚Äôs not what he‚Äôs saying at all, he‚Äôs saying there‚Äôs a distinct possibility it could go up, down, or possibly sideways.

[19-Aug-19 03:15 PM] richardt#2807
Yeah, but isn't that true for everything?

[19-Aug-19 03:15 PM] richardt#2807
Maybe giving the possibilities of each result would be more helpful

[19-Aug-19 03:32 PM] Matthias#2174
Probabilities cannot be given as they are driven by personal bias. What I meant to say earlier is that if the price on the daily candle drops below $0.03, then ARRR will most likely see new all time lows.

[19-Aug-19 03:34 PM] richardt#2807
but if it holds, then it could go up?

[19-Aug-19 03:35 PM] richardt#2807
or sideways?

If it holds, it will go up eventually. Timing is really hard to predict.

[19-Aug-19 03:37 PM] richardt#2807
then I guess the question becomes, what are the chances of it holding or dropping?

[19-Aug-19 03:38 PM] richardt#2807
I feel like I'm talking to the weather man üòÑ

[19-Aug-19 03:40 PM] richardt#2807
Although, it seems predicting the market is not much different than predicting the weather

[19-Aug-19 03:48 PM] Matthias#2174
Exactly! There are no objective probabilities in markets, just possibilities.

[19-Aug-19 03:50 PM] richardt#2807
Thanks.  I feel much better now

[19-Aug-19 03:51 PM] Markus#5464
obvious troll

[19-Aug-19 03:52 PM] richardt#2807
Sorry, not trying to troll.  Well, maybe a little bit.  Just mostly pointing out the huge fallacy in TA

[19-Aug-19 03:53 PM] richardt#2807
or people who think they can TA

[19-Aug-19 03:53 PM] Markus#5464
nobody force u to listen or comment on it in a trading channel

[19-Aug-19 03:54 PM] Markus#5464
nobody ever said TA need to work, it gives u an idea of what u should expect could happen

[19-Aug-19 03:55 PM] Markus#5464
then again how are u gonna TA coins with no liquidity, any person can ruin the supposed TA cause no bots are there to follow up

[19-Aug-19 03:56 PM] Markus#5464
with that being said if TA didnt work bots would not be profitable

[19-Aug-19 03:58 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
TA works when your TA got a lot of exposure making more people believe your TA and reacts on your TA üòÑ

[19-Aug-19 03:58 PM] Matthias#2174
True, low liquidity makes it hard to use TA on charts.

[19-Aug-19 04:00 PM] Markus#5464
not like high frequency forex bots by banks and hedge fund managers and what not trade blindly, they got built working algorithms that make them money

[19-Aug-19 04:00 PM] richardt#2807
So TA works when you can convince enough people that your TA works

[19-Aug-19 04:00 PM] Markus#5464
every person can have his own TA on same trading pair and it might work out for everyone cause everyone got different strategies

[19-Aug-19 04:01 PM] richardt#2807
I just think it's funny, that's all

[19-Aug-19 04:01 PM] richardt#2807
Don't really need TA to know that there's a possibility of things going up, down, or sideways

[19-Aug-19 04:02 PM] Markus#5464
thats what makes a market, when ppl got different strategies

[19-Aug-19 04:02 PM] Markus#5464
if everyone had same strategy it would not work

[19-Aug-19 04:09 PM] tolken#2655
@Markus for what it‚Äôs worth, I like reading your thoughts on the market.
