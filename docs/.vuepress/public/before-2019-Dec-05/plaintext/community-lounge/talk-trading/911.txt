with 5% rewards that actually gives a negative inflation rate, during the user acquisition phase, not sure why people want even more monetization

[12-Jul-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
the more fees, the less users

[12-Jul-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so saying you want more fees to get more cashflow is backwards

[12-Jul-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
less fees until you have millions and millions of active users, then start adding fees in ways that dont hurt the usage. this CANNOT be designed ahead of time before you have many active users to verify that indeed adding some fee doesnt hurt usage

[12-Jul-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so, no, i dont worry about what parking spot in Paris I would use, when I am still driving on the highways in Spain

awesome conversation

[12-Jul-19 09:36 AM] Malti#3948
thx!

[12-Jul-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i know the lambo/moon crowd is very confused by this long term thinking

[12-Jul-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
and many "investors" are sure that more monetization now is the best thing ever

[12-Jul-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
which actually works to our advantage as these fees are paid by users and what users who are used to all the free stuff on the internet will start paying for blockchain stuff?

[12-Jul-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
for things that have an established price, like trading commission, we undercut it and then discount it

[12-Jul-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
for basic usage, we make faucets to cover the txfees needed

[12-Jul-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
such a model is required for ANY chance of mass adoption. anybody that thinks otherwise is also believing that a pay per search strategy should have been used by google, when it was competing against yahoo and other search engines. imagine where google would be now if they used that strategy? probably some subscription services at public libraries

[12-Jul-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why i am very happy with the nSPV development. it will allow a 3 second onboarding of new users, as that is another requirement for mass adoption. nobody will be putting up with a gigabyte download to do transactions

waves still below KMD atm

I bet you Sasha secretly is jealous of KMD. Every time waves is below KMD there is a big pump 😛

When you have no tech, run out of air drops, buy backs not working, last thing to do is to waste funds in pumping the market

Sasha is a person that will fade into history. The way he treated people that invested in his earliest ventures is a disgrace.

@jl777c Ohhhhhhhhh the reason waves was pumping was because they had a countdown clock to RIDE on waves.....LOL

Any ideal crypto should be decentralized, but it's not a requirement

[12-Jul-19 10:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think it is smart contract or something (RIDE), then dumped

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 the only true requirement of cryptos is to replace the fiat.

Dont understand why he said fiat......hmmmmm

[12-Jul-19 11:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the only true requirement of cryptos is to replace the fiat.`
@sφldat That's a *want* not a *requirement*
The requirements of a cryptocurrency are:
secured by cryptography (crypto)
exchange of value (currency)

nothing more, nothing less

[12-Jul-19 11:07 AM] sφldat#8733
if that's all it was, then why be anonymous?

[12-Jul-19 11:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
anon is a benefit of the structure we know and love, but also not a requirement to be the thing

[12-Jul-19 11:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
this is all like saying that a navel orange isn't an orange because the bottom is puckered

USDT is a centralized, pile of hidden bullshit (imo), but it's still a cryptocurrency

Obviously, structure does not influence the nature of a thing.
But putting a tomato in the vegetable category is a mistake

[12-Jul-19 11:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`But putting a tomato in the vegetable category is a mistake`
Maybe, but a "cherry tomato" is still a tomato; just because we want tomatoes that fill a slice of bread doesn't change that

[12-Jul-19 11:13 AM] sφldat#8733
it's a cherry tomato, like Ripple is a blocked-chain

[12-Jul-19 11:15 AM] sφldat#8733
the problem comes from the deep nature of words and their definition, which is sometimes not well defined

Sex should be good. 
Bad sex is still sex, but it should be good.

Yes it’s an opinion but it’s generally a universally accepted one.

[12-Jul-19 12:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Waves talking about `profits and yields` is sketchy ground to walk on.

[12-Jul-19 12:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
SEC really enjoys a good analysis of these things to “protect and serve” the investors.

[12-Jul-19 12:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If anyone runs a project in the US and can be considered an “investment” - and you don’t have documentation and compliance registration to back that up... you’re gonna have a bad time.

[12-Jul-19 12:19 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And before anyone says anything about KMD and the earnings from usage... 

“Rewards” vs “profit”

[12-Jul-19 12:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The fact that he added FIAT is not only weird but incredibly.... stupid I think. 
That’s an open invitation to your front door from agents of the USSA.
