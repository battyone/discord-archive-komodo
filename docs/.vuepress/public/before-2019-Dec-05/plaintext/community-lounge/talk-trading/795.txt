did your ex cheat on you with a black man @Tek and now you're butthurt?

[21-Jun-19 12:33 PM] Tek#5253
it doesn't mean I hate other people either. , if you call me a racist it just shows you are dumb

[21-Jun-19 12:34 PM] Malti#3948

[21-Jun-19 12:34 PM] Tek#5253

i'd love to know your level of education

[21-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Sherdogz#6731
"nigs belong where the sun shines hard" "They get depressed here" but no I'm not racist...

[21-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Tek#5253
Devops engineer

[21-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Tek#5253
its the fucking truth

[21-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Tek#5253
they need more sun exposure

[21-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Tek#5253
way way more

[21-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Tek#5253
they adapted to a lot of sun exposure

[21-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Tek#5253
and it has nothing to do with racism

[21-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Tek#5253
what i said

[21-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Tek#5253
is just facts

[21-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Tek#5253
you r just offended cuz you are retarded.

[21-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Tek#5253
probably vote green too

[21-Jun-19 12:37 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Yeah so what there's enough vitamin d for that. Whites burn in the sun and are prone to skin cancer... Should they leave all the warm countries.... NO

[21-Jun-19 12:38 PM] Tek#5253
warm countries aren't for whites whats not to understand?

[21-Jun-19 12:38 PM] Tek#5253
africa would kill me

[21-Jun-19 12:38 PM] Malti#3948
australia is indeed cold

[21-Jun-19 12:38 PM] Tek#5253
they'll turn brown over time

[21-Jun-19 12:38 PM] Tek#5253
like the middle eastern people

[21-Jun-19 12:38 PM] Tek#5253
> can't handle the truth

[21-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Tek#5253
okay i'll go now

[21-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Florida... South America is filled with white people not to mention South Africa

[21-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Tek#5253
yes cause war

[21-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Malti#3948
had 1 argument and believes he owns the truth

[21-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Malti#3948
just the way you stated your 'argument' could have made a great difference

[21-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Malti#3948
"black people need more vitamin D"

[21-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Malti#3948
is one suggestion

[21-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Tek#5253
they need more sun exposure for the same vitamin D productions

[21-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Tek#5253
if you are low vitamin d you are depressed

[21-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Tek#5253
lmao unbelievable

[21-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Tek#5253
im just gonna stop now

[21-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Tek#5253

@Tek if you're going to be rich just skip Switzerland an go to Greenlandüëå

[21-Jun-19 12:41 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@siu - Chainmakers doesnt make any sense about people dumping now but not when binance was closed as there would have been KMD on there yet it pumped

[21-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Malti#3948
back to trading üòÑ

üëÜ 

[21-Jun-19 12:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It pumped because of lack of asks

[21-Jun-19 12:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And of course because the market and TA dictated it

[21-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Malti#3948
you know what's not dumping?

[21-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Malti#3948
ARRR

[21-Jun-19 12:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Now its correcting in the USD chart to retest the 8/41 weekly golden cross

[21-Jun-19 12:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ARRR is a great buy btw

[21-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Malti#3948
especially with bags filled with an average buying price of 0.05‚Ç¨

[21-Jun-19 12:44 PM] p.#1126
KMD  bounce or die ffs

[21-Jun-19 12:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

I missed that. Would have been a good flip

[21-Jun-19 12:45 PM] MdAmazing#4020
Sell volume isn't very impressive. Think it's a good time to lift more.

[21-Jun-19 12:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No, true, sell volume is drained

[21-Jun-19 12:46 PM] Malti#3948
people who are offloading now aren't the smartest of the bunch

[21-Jun-19 12:46 PM] Malti#3948
but they're not as bad as racists

[21-Jun-19 12:46 PM] Malti#3948
so that's still good üòÜ

where should we bounce @siu - Chainmakers

[21-Jun-19 12:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Near or below the ATL

[21-Jun-19 12:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
13k sats

[21-Jun-19 12:47 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[21-Jun-19 12:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Nothing from here to there

[21-Jun-19 12:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Usd wise it wont hurt much

[21-Jun-19 12:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Btc wise is a huge miss

[21-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Malti#3948
it's gonna be great actually

[21-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Malti#3948
we're gonna be all sold out

[21-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Malti#3948
when alt season starts

[21-Jun-19 12:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
ico was 12.8k

[21-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Malti#3948
let's get ready to moon

[21-Jun-19 12:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Not bad idea to start buying now

[21-Jun-19 12:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But who knows how low it can go

[21-Jun-19 12:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
who has btc to buy üòÑ

[21-Jun-19 12:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The people havign a blast right now w8th the btc rise

[21-Jun-19 12:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
true

[21-Jun-19 12:50 PM] MdAmazing#4020
If ETH can find a bottom now might turn the alt market

[21-Jun-19 12:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Bottom?

[21-Jun-19 12:51 PM] LocoMB#8593
bets are open for when $10k BTC

[21-Jun-19 12:51 PM] Markus#5464
lol

[21-Jun-19 12:51 PM] MdAmazing#4020
Well temporary

[21-Jun-19 12:51 PM] Markus#5464
Eth is mooning üòÑ

[21-Jun-19 12:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I have eth and its compensating for my kmd loses

[21-Jun-19 12:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Eth should get to $400 soon

[21-Jun-19 12:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And after that, ATH wont be a far fetch

[21-Jun-19 12:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
More ROI expected than from btc

[21-Jun-19 12:52 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I wonder what would happen if BTC gets rejected at 10k?

[21-Jun-19 12:52 PM] hyperDEX#6586
we all die in fiat and BTC value

[21-Jun-19 12:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It wont

[21-Jun-19 12:53 PM] MdAmazing#4020
Don't think it wants to stop yet (I hope)

[21-Jun-19 12:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Btc 10k will run in the news cycle

[21-Jun-19 12:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
12k is more like it

[21-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I have 14k as an alert in my blockfolio

[21-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As it has been +-bottom in the past

[21-Jun-19 12:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
After that, if it manages to hop above 12k before the month closes, ATH will be a piece of cake
