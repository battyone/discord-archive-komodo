Bitcoin breaking 8k this time feels lot different than the last time. So much progress has been made since then and it's only the bottom of the first inning! üöÄüëç

@tylerwinklevoss `So much progress has been made since then`?
Really? Exactly what "progress" has Bitcoin made? I must have missed it.

If Wall Street funds are injected, the current price is too low.

BTC/USD update on the big triangle. Everything below 7200 is a good buy. https://www.tradingview.com/x/PEm58Ht5/

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢    what else are they going to say, they're chilling their huge bag.

[16-May-19 10:47 AM] Sherdogz#6731
When time to buy KMD?

[16-May-19 10:55 AM] yorklab#7270
Now, because price is very low and you never know when the rebranding announcements will happen.

[16-May-19 11:21 AM] Sherdogz#6731
I've been anticipating the rebranding I miss the old countdown daysüòÑ

[16-May-19 11:28 AM] Markus#5464
i dont think its necessary the case that price will get affected by rebrand

[16-May-19 11:29 AM] Markus#5464
i feel for price to grow KMD need more devs building on the platform

[16-May-19 11:30 AM] Sherdogz#6731
How many devs are there then?

[16-May-19 11:30 AM] Markus#5464
what i mean by that is

[16-May-19 11:30 AM] Markus#5464
why eth and tron got so big attention?

[16-May-19 11:30 AM] Markus#5464
cause devs made money hustling dapps

[16-May-19 11:30 AM] Markus#5464
and we all know ppl are hungry for such scam projects

[16-May-19 11:31 AM] Markus#5464
so dumb money flow into such things is no question

[16-May-19 11:33 AM] Markus#5464
i dont mean eth and tron being scams but the smart contract gambling dapps

[16-May-19 11:35 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Yes but that's all hype I guess it takes a lot of time to create real functional Dapps..

[16-May-19 11:37 AM] Sherdogz#6731
But I see what you're saying. the more exposure the more likely more people  would stay and  use the platform.

[16-May-19 11:37 AM] Markus#5464
Yes

@jl777c  who is sg777

[16-May-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
he has been working on CHIPS

[16-May-19 11:45 AM] Markus#5464
Theres a poker pro named Phil Ivey he is known for card counting, would such strategy work with pangea?

[16-May-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
if it works with real deck, it will work with pangea

[16-May-19 11:46 AM] Markus#5464
Alright

[16-May-19 11:47 AM] Markus#5464
Where does the money paid out come from? Do players have to pay to enter a table?

[16-May-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to deposit funds to get table chips

[16-May-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
just like in casino

[16-May-19 11:47 AM] Markus#5464
Alright

[16-May-19 11:49 AM] Markus#5464
How is the final payout calculated for winning player? will there always be balance leftover in the bank after a table is finished?

[16-May-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the winner gets all the bets, minus rake, just like in real life

[16-May-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
in general, we made it to match what happens in real life as we model after online poker

[16-May-19 11:52 AM] Markus#5464
Ok would paid tournaments be possible? lets say the tournament is required to have 100 players and entry price is 500‚Ç¨

[16-May-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
tournament logic can certainly be added after the basic table logic is working

[16-May-19 11:53 AM] Markus#5464
Ok cool

[16-May-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
but first we need the table logic working 100%

[16-May-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
all these centralized games claiming they are decentralized because one small part of the game uses a decentralized means... it is quite disingenuous

[16-May-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
from what i can tell, a lot of these "dapps" are just centralized apps that use a "decentralized" coin to bet with

[16-May-19 11:55 AM] Markus#5464

KMD would rank high on that list. i think 33 nodes would be needed for hashrate dominance, we have around 1000 KMD nodes, more like 5000 across the entire ecosystem.

[16-May-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
for the tron "dapp" it seems the dapp writer can just disappear with funds, so that makes such things totally centralized

and watch how over the next year they will "see the light" and be all for bitcoin

to companies that can literally create fiat out of loans that they make, it is not any hardship

[16-May-19 02:30 PM] meatspoon#7860
probably not.  but it at least should be humbling to know that they are buying quantities of BTC that wont even allow them to rival the early miners and speculators

it totally violated their assumptions about controlling the power

unless you believe that binance and the other exchanges dont have some sort of sharing of info

[16-May-19 02:32 PM] meatspoon#7860

I think this is just the beginning....wait until binance open up their leverage markets

nasty in an upward direction I can deal with.  heh

but also binance

[16-May-19 02:37 PM] Markus#5464
i can also see the binance coin being used as fees when it comes to their own leverage markets so price of that coin could go up alot
