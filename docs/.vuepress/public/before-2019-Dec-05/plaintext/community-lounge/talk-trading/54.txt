DICO wonâ€™t run itself

[18-Jul-18 04:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@smellycouch why does it stink?

[18-Jul-18 05:12 PM] smellycouch#3071

They probably should have shilled harder

[18-Jul-18 05:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But seemed they were trying hard not to sound like the next moneygrabbing shill fest ico

[18-Jul-18 05:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But I think in order to have a succesful ico, especially in a bear market, you need both long term and quick flip investors

[18-Jul-18 05:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And they only seemed interested in the long term guys

[18-Jul-18 05:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Which is fair and a standup way to do business

[18-Jul-18 05:16 PM] smellycouch#3071
The way to go.

[18-Jul-18 05:17 PM] smellycouch#3071
"Why didn't it pump and dump...must be a scam because no pump and dump"

[18-Jul-18 05:17 PM] smellycouch#3071
Sigh

[18-Jul-18 05:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Jep

[18-Jul-18 05:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
People hear ico

[18-Jul-18 05:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And they want at least a telegram group with 100000 members

[18-Jul-18 05:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And shilling by *prominent* twitter accounts

[18-Jul-18 05:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So they can have an easy 3x

[18-Jul-18 06:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What

[18-Jul-18 06:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Any reason for the lowball dump?

[18-Jul-18 06:19 PM] jorian#4555
no

[18-Jul-18 06:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok, firing up barterdex

[18-Jul-18 06:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I see 11.11 kmd/dex?

[18-Jul-18 06:42 PM] smellycouch#3071
So confused lol

[18-Jul-18 06:51 PM] jorian#4555
Price went up, inversed market

[18-Jul-18 06:51 PM] jorian#4555
No demand, price goes up

[18-Jul-18 06:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No demand, price should go down though :p

[18-Jul-18 06:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Waiting for a match, what utxo sizes are you using?

[18-Jul-18 06:56 PM] jorian#4555
one went through

[18-Jul-18 06:56 PM] jorian#4555
there should be room for 5 DEX

[18-Jul-18 06:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I just installed last version of hyper

[18-Jul-18 06:56 PM] jorian#4555
oh

[18-Jul-18 06:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Because barterdex was failing to match

[18-Jul-18 06:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And litterally the second I posted the order

[18-Jul-18 06:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It matched

[18-Jul-18 06:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
fucking lit @hyperDEX

[18-Jul-18 06:56 PM] jorian#4555
hehe, but i didn't have 17 DEX i see now. it's a bit scattered

[18-Jul-18 06:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah trying for 200kmd first

[18-Jul-18 06:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
.5 DEX at a time is gonna take a while :p

[18-Jul-18 06:59 PM] jorian#4555
yes ðŸ˜›

[18-Jul-18 06:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No bigger utxo's?

[18-Jul-18 06:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or already a lot of them sold?

[18-Jul-18 07:00 PM] jorian#4555
i'll merge some

[18-Jul-18 07:04 PM] jorian#4555
15 DEX should work now

[18-Jul-18 07:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ok let me try

[18-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Acura#2748
Can Sell large amounts of Dex if the price is nice

[18-Jul-18 07:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I can also sell if price is nice

[18-Jul-18 07:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Only buy when price is very nice

[18-Jul-18 07:10 PM] jorian#4555
nope, something went wrong

[18-Jul-18 07:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm at 1/5?

[18-Jul-18 07:10 PM] jorian#4555
don't think it will end

[18-Jul-18 07:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'll burn a candle real quick

[18-Jul-18 07:11 PM] jorian#4555
my node failed to send a bobdeposit

[18-Jul-18 07:11 PM] jorian#4555
@Acura my price is 10.1 KMD

[18-Jul-18 07:12 PM] Acura#2748
I only sell , not buying Dex. Have enough ðŸ˜ƒ

[18-Jul-18 07:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm not sure what to do in hyper now, I assume funds are locked?

[18-Jul-18 07:14 PM] jorian#4555
yes, but they will return

[18-Jul-18 07:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah sure no doubt

[18-Jul-18 07:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But I assume I need to deposit different utxo's

[18-Jul-18 07:17 PM] jorian#4555
nope, again the one buying DEX just now, failed on my node

[18-Jul-18 07:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Was me again

[18-Jul-18 07:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
6 DEX?

[18-Jul-18 07:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
requested 17DEX broadcast 6.xx dex

[18-Jul-18 07:19 PM] jorian#4555
yes, hyperdex doesn't use the `fill` and `good til cancelled` options yet

[18-Jul-18 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
alice side wont send anything but dexfee if bobdeposit fails

[18-Jul-18 07:20 PM] jorian#4555
CHIPS on a short sale too: 0.1 KMD, 200 CHIPS utxo sizes

[18-Jul-18 07:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha explains why I'm still able to post trades with my initial funds

[18-Jul-18 07:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Gonna reset my utxos and try again

[18-Jul-18 07:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362

let me try a different network, but yesterday the first swap instantly connected and got through and then the issues were mostly bobdeposit issues?
