Today, President Xi Jinping stated strong support (or necessity) for blockchain development by China.

16k! 16k! 16k! will it happen before oct ends :D

[26-Oct-19 02:48 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@coingirl87 I get that and I am not to amazed by price performance myself... Can't really tell what's up with that , but you can't market kmd atm , and even if you did it would only make for short lived pumps , probably

[26-Oct-19 02:48 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
This marketing will come when everything is in place

[26-Oct-19 02:49 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
when real usage come, price will moon

[26-Oct-19 02:58 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I'm not surprised. 
A price decrease and salty people, go hand in hand.

It will be pretty funny if  a /biz/ meme ends up becoming a self fulfilling prophecy. perhaps more proof that it's really all just a simulation

[26-Oct-19 03:36 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
if 16k hits, people will have a higher tendency to make the next target happen

BTC up 29%!  this all happened because my damn bank wouldn't let me wire my own funds to invest in a startup.  I had to send the startup BTC instead, just as it crashed. The very next day it pumps!  I can't believe this luck.  I am going to walk into the bank and take out my fiat and give them the middle finger.   https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin

Someone asked above about projects that have paying customers, I call the first thing that came to mind is the Tierion (TNT) project and you can continue the list for a long time! If we have one hope of using AtomicDEX then this is not good! The project will grow only with the participation of major players! Where will the venture capital investments be? Who will explain why one of the many venture companies should invest in KMD? What is the incentive when an open source project, despite such innovations, goes unnoticed and does not attract big money even at the lowest price? The trading volumes indicate that the coin is not interesting now to absolutely no big, not small investors, and without investors, even the coolest project is doomed - it is simply copied by enterprising Chinese. - they will register in the jurisdiction of Singapore and conduct such marketing that everyone will forget KMD with the words: "why do we need KMD if there is a "..... chain"  that has all komodo chips but also marketing like Tron and deflation like BNB which is all they accuse them of centralization but forget that they are developing their own DEX in which integrating atomic permutations and all sorts of Antara analogs is not a problem! Maybe the team might think about creating a similarity of DeFi, Maker and the like inside the chain? for a wide range of investors, the Chinese conc annuities will take the best and leave us overboard - after all, the same original idea with confidential ones failed and the ARRR chain is dead in fact now because whoever looks at it while there are Monero, ZEN, ZEC and simple bitcoin mixers! Thatâ€™s left at the end of BTC and a few Chinese projects that have a lot of money not only to hire the best developers in the world but also to conduct top-level marketing!

[26-Oct-19 05:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
1) Tierion, raised 10x what komodo raised,  and is 30 lower on CMC, i wonder if people complain as much to them as us?   2) Atomicdex isnt the only thing being relied on.  3)  We currently are the only advanced technology partner in blockchain on AWS, and are working towards the same on other major platforms  4)  If people could just copy us and make a more successful project, why havent they,   we encourage people to create their own fork of Komodo,  the whole point behind smartchains.  5)  #cc-pegs  is the Maker-like  thing you are requesting. 6)  ARRR is not dead,   lite clients are being tested and atomic swap compatibility with ARRR as well.

[26-Oct-19 05:46 AM] Privatoshi#9487
#cc-pegs  
I need to check this out

[26-Oct-19 05:47 AM] Flint#6435
@polycryptoblog  But there is huge competition and there are coins that have REAL use right now! they have billions of dollars of cross-border transfers every day! The same Qutum chart which resembles a Komodo only trading volumes 10 times higher! Chinese investors support their project and do not let it fall! Maybe the volumes are a little fake but not 100%! But at komodo we only have weak hands so far ..... And its not about innovation, but about the ability to attract REAL users faster than competitors! Who will name the reason why in the near future people should leave with BinanceDEX in favor of AtomicDEX? What makes the KMD token more valuable than the BNB? BNB at least burn and create a deficit! I do not deny Komodo technologies - they are amazing and advanced, but what is the advantage of the KMD token itself? After all, Komodo infrastructure can well exist without extensive use of its own token! What is the incentive for investors to buy KMD instead of BNB? Or another asset even inside the Komodo ecosystem?

[26-Oct-19 05:50 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
but what is the advantage of the KMD token itself? --- #cc-pegs  ,  paying for dpow.   module access on mainchain

[26-Oct-19 05:51 AM] Privatoshi#9487
@Flint I think JL went into detail earlier today,  in this channel, about KMD. I think you should scroll up and read it

i give explanations about the use of pirate and of cc-pegs

[26-Oct-19 05:53 AM] Privatoshi#9487
@Flint A comparison between KMD and BNB? Really?

[26-Oct-19 05:56 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I understand Pirate. I've just never heard of KMD, stablecoins and #cc-pegs. I've heard of OUR

[26-Oct-19 05:58 AM] Flint#6435
can you read more about this? Is it as easy for an investor as a maker? When will it be popularized? Does this mean the arrival of large investors? In the case of Maker, I just buy it on the exchange as a share, and its easy even for my grandmother, what does it look like with # cc-pegs?
And does this mean that the kmd token itself is an exclusively utilitarian token that lacks a clear internal value and is formed only by speculation? After all, he is not deflationary and his offer is increasing, so what is the reason for the ordinary investor who has come to Binance today or who will go to AtomicDEX in the future to buy KMD?

[26-Oct-19 05:58 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Is it collateralized loans with KMD?
85%? @polycryptoblog

[26-Oct-19 05:58 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes

[26-Oct-19 05:58 AM] Flint#6435
@Privatoshi ðŸ‘Œ

[26-Oct-19 05:58 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
but it also allows collateralization for any(most) other coin as well

[26-Oct-19 05:59 AM] Privatoshi#9487
@polycryptoblog Lol, I learned that quick

[26-Oct-19 05:59 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
and as well as pegging to any kind of asset

[26-Oct-19 05:59 AM] Privatoshi#9487
So it's like Synthetix

[26-Oct-19 05:59 AM] Privatoshi#9487
sETH, sEOS

[26-Oct-19 05:59 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Create a synthetic asset pegged to any other crypto

[26-Oct-19 06:00 AM] Privatoshi#9487
kETH

[26-Oct-19 06:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
yes,  except no gas fees

[26-Oct-19 06:00 AM] Flint#6435
is it like collateral assets? How are smart assets in Bitshares?

[26-Oct-19 06:01 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Well if you drop below 85%, you get liquidated lol

[26-Oct-19 06:01 AM] Privatoshi#9487
85% of your initial loan

[26-Oct-19 06:01 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Usually is 150% collateral required

[26-Oct-19 06:02 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I might be wrong, but if it's like I think, you could peg it to ETH... kETH

[26-Oct-19 06:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes, it is like those.   Except what is issued is a coin, not a token on a chain ( though it could be a token on a chain if desired )

[26-Oct-19 06:03 AM] Privatoshi#9487
What's the difference?

[26-Oct-19 06:03 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
transaction fees for one

[26-Oct-19 06:03 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
blockchain bloat for another

[26-Oct-19 06:03 AM] Privatoshi#9487
This could potentially be big.

[26-Oct-19 06:03 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Be Ethereum network congestion delays DeFi

[26-Oct-19 06:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
now combine cc-peg, with pirate ( privacy trading layer ) and atomicdex ( p2p swaps )

[26-Oct-19 06:04 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Instead of getting your txs processed, Tether ERC20 is backing the network up for 3 days,  minting tethere

[26-Oct-19 06:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
trade your pegged coin into pirate ( going private ) and back out into what you really wanted to trade with

[26-Oct-19 06:05 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
and the pegged coins can have zkSNARKS enabled on the chain too if desired

[26-Oct-19 06:05 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Still be possible to leak metadata

[26-Oct-19 06:05 AM] Privatoshi#9487
But I like the idea

[26-Oct-19 06:05 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
better than no privacy

[26-Oct-19 06:06 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Exactly

[26-Oct-19 06:06 AM] Flint#6435
@polycryptoblog Does this mean that users will be able to create digital derivatives using the KMD token? Or for example, the digital similarity of stocks tied to the price of oil, Amazon stocks and so on?

[26-Oct-19 06:06 AM] Privatoshi#9487
That's why I said I like the idea

[26-Oct-19 06:06 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Yes  @Flint

[26-Oct-19 06:06 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes, anything you can get a price feed for.   I mention this in the video i did

[26-Oct-19 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
we are in the process of testing an MGOLD chain, pegged to an ounce of gold, backed by KMD

[26-Oct-19 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
using decentralized mechanism for issuing and liquidating

[26-Oct-19 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
liquidation currently calibrated to happen when your equity goes below 10%

{Reactions}
shexy 

[26-Oct-19 06:08 AM] Flint#6435
then the main question is liquidity! this is probably the most difficult task

[26-Oct-19 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
can borrow up to 80% of deposited value

[26-Oct-19 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
liquidity is determined by the number of users who decide to convert KMD to the pegged coin

[26-Oct-19 06:09 AM] Privatoshi#9487
That's pretty high ...80%

[26-Oct-19 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
we use a 24hour average of the DTO pricefeed

[26-Oct-19 06:09 AM] Privatoshi#9487
So we could actually create kUSD

[26-Oct-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
so the price moves slowly and should give enough time for liquidators to rebalance the overall system

[26-Oct-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
we are also testing USDK

[26-Oct-19 06:10 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Same concept

[26-Oct-19 06:10 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
you could create a kBlackLotus if you wanted to ( rare MtG card if you didnt know )

[26-Oct-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
exact same cc-pegs, just using a different pricefeed

[26-Oct-19 06:11 AM] Privatoshi#9487
This is big considering there is no gas and no network congestion

[26-Oct-19 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
all these coins atomic swappable

[26-Oct-19 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
and can use zaddr

[26-Oct-19 06:12 AM] Flint#6435
liquidity pools without serious partners (not cloud services) cannot be created exclusively programmatically! Most likely, you need something like a mechanism for stacking clients assets that, during their retention, create a liquidity pool using smart contracts and users receive a reward at the end of the smart contract

[26-Oct-19 06:12 AM] Privatoshi#9487
@jl777c Have you checked this out?

[26-Oct-19 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
@Flint i only deal with the core tech side of things, others will have to deal with partners, etc.

[26-Oct-19 06:14 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Why not use kUSD to purchase any synthetic assets?

[26-Oct-19 06:14 AM] Privatoshi#9487
They do something similar.

[26-Oct-19 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
didnt you read when i posted: "all these coins atomic swappable"

[26-Oct-19 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
atomicDEX will be the exchange for the pegged coins

[26-Oct-19 06:15 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Flint  we are working on acquiring partners beyond cloud providers.

[26-Oct-19 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
if people want to use USDk for trading, they can

[26-Oct-19 06:15 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I must not be thinking

[26-Oct-19 06:15 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Sounds nice

[26-Oct-19 06:15 AM] Privatoshi#9487
You guys have my interest for sure

[26-Oct-19 06:16 AM] Privatoshi#9487
This is what users are interested in right now

[26-Oct-19 06:16 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I'll start to spread the word

[26-Oct-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
the important thing is that we are creating the tech that allows anybody to launch a pegged and backed chain, we are just doing the reference versions so people can see how it is done

[26-Oct-19 06:18 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Flint Of different levels,   mainly Ive been focused on integrations.  However once the tools are ready we can acquire partners to connect into our services whether as liquidity or other types of providers.
