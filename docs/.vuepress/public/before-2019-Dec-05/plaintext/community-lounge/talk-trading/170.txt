Bitcoin Core (BTC) is going to drop to #40 on CoinMarketCap. It has no utility and the entire thing is an Emperor Has No Clothes type of situation. High Fee Coin is a stupid idea and it's going to fail. Children understand this.

[21-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
This is kind of delusional tbh

[21-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Btc fees are quite low now?

[21-Sep-18 08:31 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
they will skyrocket again when the market is bull again

[21-Sep-18 08:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Lol... that guy thinks btc is just the price.

[21-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôve been trying to tell you guys

[21-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[21-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Komodo I think

[21-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It scales

[21-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Has scales and does scale, get it?

[21-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
*ba dum tissssss*

[21-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Anyway you all should look into it

[21-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@jl777c ever think of scaling up with everyone cross checking each other

[21-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
All pos/pow coins notarizing to each other

[21-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
A massive net of blockchains

[21-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
A ‚Äòsuper-net‚Äô if you will

[21-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No one talks about this

[21-Sep-18 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it only gains security if you notarize to a more secure chain

[21-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Jest, my good man

[21-Sep-18 10:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what is a good number of cross chain TX/s to aim for ? @Hollowman9000

[21-Sep-18 10:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[21-Sep-18 10:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  made a script that automatiaclly keeps your money evenly balanced over every chain üòÆ

[21-Sep-18 10:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[21-Sep-18 10:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
do we need to fill an entire block.. or just some percentage

[21-Sep-18 10:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
a billion... might take a whiile

[21-Sep-18 10:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but i think it can be done

[21-Sep-18 10:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I like that attitude

[21-Sep-18 10:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so far.. 5% fail...

[21-Sep-18 10:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[21-Sep-18 10:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[22-Sep-18 06:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
Anyone using those apps raiz/spaceship?

[22-Sep-18 06:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Wanna put a bit away every week into stocks but commsec here is $20 per trade and I‚Äôd rather put 50 in a few times a weeks than save up a lump sum of 5k for vanguard etc

[22-Sep-18 06:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thinking of accumulating small amounts whenever I can through these apps ($1 per month fee) then when I hit 5k move it into vanguard

[22-Sep-18 06:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or would I be better off just saving every dollar in a little tin can and going that way

[22-Sep-18 07:31 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
fidelity only charges $4.95 a trade for commission

[22-Sep-18 07:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
I heard something about buying 5k into vanguard and then you can bpay 100 here and there fee free? Can‚Äôt find anything on their website though

[22-Sep-18 10:15 AM] CheeseBaby#1954
Is it just me, or is KMD not listed under BTC markets page when you first log in?

[22-Sep-18 11:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[22-Sep-18 11:17 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

chips used to have an electrum server for bdex....but now it looks like only native works. Was this to keep the rift raft out?

[23-Sep-18 07:05 AM] LocoMB#8593
speaking of CHIPS- is there any team on developing a front end Poker App for that? 
or some other kind of casino game?
we all know that the market is ready for that - has been ready for it for years now.. üÉè ...
I think I should also ask this in CHIPS discord..
