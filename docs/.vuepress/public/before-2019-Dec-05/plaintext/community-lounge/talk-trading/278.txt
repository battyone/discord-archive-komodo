who knows what is really happening? maybe this all scenario is just a marketing idea of BCH guys ? üòÉ

everything Ryan says is a potential problem wasn't when they split BTC for some reason...

@Deleted User i'm listening to the video and commenting

What happened finally?

[15-Nov-18 05:59 PM] snowdamn#2414
i can see a future with no BTC, but i can also see a future with no BCH
believing that any of the two can't happen is the only problem i see

[15-Nov-18 05:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Who won?

[15-Nov-18 06:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But it seems like only one was able to reorg the chain

[15-Nov-18 06:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Sv?

[15-Nov-18 06:05 PM] modereck#4269
The Bitcoin Cash network has now been upgraded!
1 block has been mined under the new consensus rules!
Bitcoin ABC is currently 1 block ahead.

I thought I read 6 in a row somewhere?

But dont quote me on that, also read a lot of bs

[15-Nov-18 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
more blocks that the other

[15-Nov-18 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
but if SV wants to kill ABC, they need to mine their fork and also the ABC fork... it seems they are not mining their own fork, maybe they are trying to build a longer chain than the ABC fork

[15-Nov-18 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
for this dPoW would protect ABC fork as each block is mined publicly

[15-Nov-18 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
SV wouldnt be able to reorg any ABC blocks

[15-Nov-18 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe 1 could be reorged if the timing was just right

[15-Nov-18 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
13MB block, both sides spamming the other?

ABC seems to have 3x the prefork combined hashrate

[15-Nov-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
if only BCH was notarized, we could be sure in these blocks

[15-Nov-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
as it is, any moment it could all be reorged to empty blocks

[15-Nov-18 06:48 PM] Alright#0419
just broadcasted 3 at once

[15-Nov-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe they are selfish mining the ABC fork too

[15-Nov-18 06:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What is and why would you mine selfishly (sry for the noob question)

[15-Nov-18 06:49 PM] Alright#0419
they would selfish mine their own to make ABC think they're winning

[15-Nov-18 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
now that the chains are forked, it doesnt really matter who is ahead, they are both separate chains

[15-Nov-18 06:49 PM] Alright#0419
selfish mine ABC to reorg with empty blocks

[15-Nov-18 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
to "win" SV would need to reorg the ABC chain, while still advancing the SV chain

[15-Nov-18 06:49 PM] Alright#0419
people are replaying all transactions

so it's not a clean split at all

[15-Nov-18 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
any tx on either chain is liable to be confirmed on the both chains, until it is contaminated with a fork specific utxo

[15-Nov-18 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
quite a mess to deal with

[15-Nov-18 06:52 PM] Alright#0419

Bch did have replay protection, no?

I thought that was something jl worked on for bch?

[15-Nov-18 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, they implemented replay protection vs BTC

[15-Nov-18 06:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
from btc, not sv

Indeed could cost a lot of honest people a lot pf money...

[15-Nov-18 06:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, specially since BCH was the most accepted among businesses

[15-Nov-18 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so which BCH will be accepted as the old BCH?

[15-Nov-18 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
ABC or SV?

[15-Nov-18 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless of hashrate, both chains will continue to advance
