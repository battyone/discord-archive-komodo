Do Decentralized ICO's have any prerequisites? I was thinking (of course no one would do this üòõ but hypothetically) failed ICO's or scam/worthless investments are capital loss events to the ATO.
Hypothetically could a bad actor make an anonymous D-ico of which he invests in it himself, which has 0 value and fails miserably, hence the capital loss of said funds, while he gets to keep the "raised funds" off the books/not in his trade history? :trollface:

[17-Aug-18 10:36 AM] jansako#3330
It could be done, in theory. In practice you need to consider: How much money this is, who are you hiding it from (the 'real IRS or a Zimbabwean one?), and is it worth for them to go after you...

[17-Aug-18 10:37 AM] Mylo#8306
hehe that bottom line should be closer to the red line thru my amateur eye

[17-Aug-18 10:38 AM] jansako#3330
If it is worth for 'them' to go after you, they will get you once you start spending it, or you need to tax it anyway as income later so you did not really gain anything except pushed the 'income' into later, and there are better ways to do that

[17-Aug-18 10:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
I mean if they had 3 mil, paid tax on 2 mil, and put the other mil into the ico, that capital loss would make taxable on 1m, so in essence theyve gotten 1m tax paid, 1m taxfree, and 1m "off the books" aka buy gold

Too many newbies thinking they know what they are doing shortig at these levels

[17-Aug-18 11:49 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Feels the contrary to the top. People take loans to buy at thr top. But they also do thr same to short the bottoms. And it looks like in the trading chats everyone is getting too cozy with shorting to raise margin up to 100x lol

[17-Aug-18 11:56 AM] Deleted User#0000

with the coming 1 mln tx/s test coming up, it might be smart to say that it was on mainnet (what it is) because for the last test a lot of people said it doesn't matter on testnet etc.

Can you make a pruned blockchain that is say just a rolling set amount of blocks
