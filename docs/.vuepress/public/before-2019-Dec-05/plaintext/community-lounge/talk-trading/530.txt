tbh

[10-Apr-19 08:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I can see a long squeeze coming

[10-Apr-19 08:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
volume on these upward moves if decreasing

[10-Apr-19 08:19 PM] Alexfrog#1338
I think I understand now.  I hate BTC more than ComputerGenie does.   Thats why I want KMD to surpass BTC, but he just doesnt care what BTC does, he only cares about KMD vs USD. 😄

Use a proxy buyer based in a country with low-energy door kickers @jl777c

[10-Apr-19 08:23 PM] Keppie#5156
How deep are yr pockets jl777 😂

[10-Apr-19 08:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
50-100 btc

[10-Apr-19 08:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or shapeshift

[10-Apr-19 08:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
They don’t KYC

[10-Apr-19 08:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Either want your order filled or you don’t 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[10-Apr-19 08:25 PM] mobipoi#5774
Maybe wait for mm2 completion and use it for initial volume, plus no need to know your chicken win/win @jl777c

[10-Apr-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
but now is a good time to buy

[10-Apr-19 08:30 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
it was a good edit:fantastic time to buy at 0.5USDcents/KMD

[10-Apr-19 08:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Nevermind shapeshift is KYC now

[10-Apr-19 08:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Oh well

[10-Apr-19 08:31 PM] mobipoi#5774
Yes but arbitrage opportunities will exist many people will pay.premium not to know their chicken but maybe 50/50 split

[10-Apr-19 08:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just waiting on blacklisting of coins

[10-Apr-19 08:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[10-Apr-19 08:42 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Seriously, someone needs to buy all this KMD from these traitors (traders) who are dumping it for btc so they can dump that for usd shitcoin.

[10-Apr-19 08:48 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
somebody could buy on cex and sell it to jl

[10-Apr-19 08:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I’m but a simple man

[10-Apr-19 08:50 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I have 100 btc daily withdrawal limit on Binance but I don't have that much btc 😂

[10-Apr-19 08:50 PM] richardt#2807
You'd have to be a real baller to max out that daily limit 😉

[10-Apr-19 08:54 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
maybe when mobile dex is launched on beta then 😄

[10-Apr-19 08:55 PM] Alexfrog#1338
wont matter, dex will have no volume, people only use centralized exchanges 😛

[10-Apr-19 08:56 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
but jl can set the 100 btc buy order and anybody could sell to

[10-Apr-19 08:56 PM] Alecandro#1179
How does the team plan to try and change that?

[10-Apr-19 08:56 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
there is a plan to link dex to cex as liquidity provider or so i heard

[10-Apr-19 08:57 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so the dex will have a CEX as an LP

[10-Apr-19 08:59 PM] REX#3983
RIP KMD / BTC

[10-Apr-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, its over. I will buy back 50 BTC worth. better sell now before it goes to 10k

i remember somebody guaranteed KMD would go to 10k

[10-Apr-19 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
he couldnt have been wrong, he sounded so smart

[10-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Alecandro#1179

[10-Apr-19 09:03 PM] Alecandro#1179

@Alexfrog 
`I hate BTC more than ComputerGenie does. Thats why I want KMD to surpass BTC, but he just doesnt care what BTC does, he only cares about KMD vs USD. `
1) the 1st part of that is impossible
2) so do I
3) the last half of that shows that you actively refuse to read the actual words I type

[10-Apr-19 09:06 PM] Alecandro#1179
the world will be valued in KMD. this is what he wants. nothing to exchange to. just kmd

[10-Apr-19 09:26 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477

[10-Apr-19 09:32 PM] SHossain#0007

[10-Apr-19 09:32 PM] SHossain#0007

[10-Apr-19 10:20 PM] crumb#2550
i asked in #notarynode channel about the VOTE2019 snapshot, but more active people hang out here so. what is the snapshot block or UTC timestamp (whichever of those is more appropriate) for VOTE2019. so far i've only seen april 14th mentioned, but that is a bit vague

[10-Apr-19 10:21 PM] SHossain#0007
i guess kolo will have to answer that

[10-Apr-19 10:21 PM] SHossain#0007
he is the election master

not that i think any of you arent worth votes 😃

[10-Apr-19 10:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
There are plenty of good candidates, my recommendation is to organize your votes in a way that let chainmakers win in NA since we are humbly running for just one node ☺
