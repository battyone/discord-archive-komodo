the tankening is coming

[15-Apr-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
suing everybody that disagrees with you seems the final straw. it is rare for vast majority in crypto to agree on anything

[15-Apr-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
but it seems nearly universal that everybody agrees with "CSW is not satoshi"

[15-Apr-19 05:47 PM] Tek#5253
yeah

[15-Apr-19 05:47 PM] Tek#5253
csw seems like a real psycho to me

[15-Apr-19 05:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but to destroy investors because you don't like 1 douche is just as retarded as that douche

[15-Apr-19 05:48 PM] Tek#5253

“Let the markets decide” 
Yet also 
“My opinion is also important”

it's hard for the markets to decide when a small group of people get to decide if there are markets

How do you buy below the bottom.... Drop some crazy bids on low liquidity exchanges.   As @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 says...
