maybe sometimes I end up with some legacycoins

[29-May-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
turns out majority of stakes went to sockpuppets of founders, many warning signs, so I dont regret cashing out

[29-May-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
I also had sizeable amounts of Xcoin and XMR, which I also dumped

[29-May-19 02:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

I still hold a small amount of my IOTA from the ico. Should have sold it all when it was 4 dollars.

[29-May-19 02:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I kept some IOTA. Speculating it's tech future, instead of price future.

[29-May-19 02:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
sold all my NEM when it went to 400 sats or so

[29-May-19 02:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
converted all those to NXT/BTCD at that time

[29-May-19 02:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
still my best move from NEM to diversify to others

[29-May-19 02:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

Hello, I'd need an escrow for a KMD/BTC deal

[29-May-19 02:26 PM] pooler#1851
Also asking if someone can vouch for Avant (@VoIIka_Racho), admin of the telegram group

[29-May-19 02:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
would highly recommend to use Barterlly for Escrow

[29-May-19 02:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
#barterlly

[29-May-19 02:27 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
https://app.barterlly.io/

[29-May-19 02:27 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Stay safe @pooler  use barterlly

[29-May-19 02:28 PM] pooler#1851
it's a really good deal, I don't want to potentially "lose" it (to others) if you get me 😉

[29-May-19 02:29 PM] pooler#1851
so I'd prefer the manual way this time

[29-May-19 02:29 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
it is upto you. but you can create an order and pass the link to your trader

[29-May-19 02:29 PM] Malti#3948
private orders are possible

[29-May-19 02:30 PM] Malti#3948
iirc

[29-May-19 02:30 PM] Alecandro#1179
Whale bro be back 😃

[29-May-19 02:33 PM] pooler#1851
does the counterparty have to register?

[29-May-19 02:35 PM] pooler#1851
okay, barterlly is not an option for my counterparty

[29-May-19 02:36 PM] pooler#1851
So I'm asking again for an escrow, the deal is worth 40k KMD

[29-May-19 02:37 PM] pooler#1851
soo, something to earn 😉

[29-May-19 02:41 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
@Alecandro i noticed too 😂

[29-May-19 02:44 PM] hastrup#8742
@pooler I have used shossain many times

[29-May-19 02:44 PM] hastrup#8742
Ha takes 1% both sides

[29-May-19 02:44 PM] pooler#1851
Thanks, DMd him

[29-May-19 02:45 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
If shossain agrees for you i can also vouch for Shossain

[29-May-19 02:47 PM] SHossain#0007

If Heidi were ugly or a dude, 'Dash News' would have about 3700 less subscribers

[29-May-19 03:56 PM] PTYX#6840
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 your theory might be proven true since PIVX has a male version of Heidi and they have way less suscribers

[29-May-19 03:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, PIVX being PIVX might have something to do with that too :troll:

[29-May-19 04:26 PM] Tek#5253
it was due for correction upwards anyways

[29-May-19 04:38 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
this kmd pump is making me wet 💦 💦 💦 💦

[29-May-19 04:45 PM] Tek#5253
kmd goes up = good cause I have a huge bag

[29-May-19 04:46 PM] Tek#5253
kmd goes down = good cause im trading a small bag

[29-May-19 04:46 PM] Tek#5253

i want to see ethereums market cap become kmds market cap

[29-May-19 04:46 PM] Tek#5253
if ETH doesn't come up with scaling in less tan a year its over

[29-May-19 04:47 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
^^

[29-May-19 04:47 PM] Tek#5253
this market is extremely boolish

[29-May-19 04:47 PM] Tek#5253
when the fuck is the pullback on btc coming

[29-May-19 04:47 PM] Mische#6695
But sharding and other buzzwords might keep it alive

[29-May-19 04:47 PM] Tek#5253
> sharting

[29-May-19 04:47 PM] Tek#5253
: D

[29-May-19 04:48 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
when the fuck are people going stop pumping btc and realize that it is literally the most useless asset ever

[29-May-19 04:48 PM] Tek#5253
tbh if you gonna use sharding its centralized

[29-May-19 04:48 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
we need kmd #1 markectap

[29-May-19 04:48 PM] Tek#5253
if the kmd ecosystem grows well kmd will grow too

[29-May-19 04:48 PM] Tek#5253
its happeing so i guess im comfy

[29-May-19 04:48 PM] Mische#6695
Dpow will be expensive if KMD has the first place

[29-May-19 04:49 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
oh true

[29-May-19 04:49 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
well

[29-May-19 04:49 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
we wont really need dpow if KMD is first place

[29-May-19 04:49 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
we can j notarize sub-chains onto main kmd chain

[29-May-19 04:49 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
right?

[29-May-19 04:49 PM] Mische#6695
Also 5.1% inflation might be too much to get to #1

[29-May-19 04:50 PM] Mische#6695
It’s even more with mining rewards

[29-May-19 04:50 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
im just hoping that in the next 5 years investors will realize that the features and innovations of other assets make them much better than BTC, and then BTC's marketcap will become distributed amongst the most useful assets, with KMD being on eof them

[29-May-19 04:50 PM] Tek#5253
i can see that happening

[29-May-19 04:51 PM] Mische#6695
Best would be KMD #2 and notarizing to ARRR #1 :troll_king:

[29-May-19 04:51 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
I cant see ARRR being bigger than kmd tho

[29-May-19 04:52 PM] Tek#5253
nah kmd will be like dady bitcoin

[29-May-19 04:52 PM] Tek#5253
to the kmd ecosystem

[29-May-19 04:52 PM] Tek#5253
so why mess with shitcons

[29-May-19 04:52 PM] Tek#5253
just hold dad

[29-May-19 04:52 PM] Tek#5253
: D

[29-May-19 04:52 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
we need tons of insane projects on kmdecosystem, so then kmd becomes the ultimate base pair

[29-May-19 04:52 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
big pumps

[29-May-19 04:52 PM] Mische#6695
This market is too irrational, lot’s of shite above KMD

[29-May-19 04:52 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
yup
