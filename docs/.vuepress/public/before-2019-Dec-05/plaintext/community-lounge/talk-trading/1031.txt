even they don't need to understand too deep inside of this tech, but need to understand enough on how to use all the parts together to use this tech efficiently and create end products for consumers or end users.

[07-Aug-19 09:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
This is special target market

[07-Aug-19 09:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The technical dev market

[07-Aug-19 09:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The official team will give the best "reference" projects, but the really amazing projects will use the exact same backend APIs and tech framework to build more robust and amazing tech the end users will like even more than offical products of KMD built using tech of KMD.

need REAL everyday use of the coin! Beyond DEX and smart contracts! Already now - for the project can be arbitrarily unique and advanced, but only among a narrow circle of specialists!

[07-Aug-19 09:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Focus on devs marketing and you'll get more projects and solutions made by 3rd party and new devs joining team and community. The end result is more users using the tech built upon KMD, and that in turn does the Network Effect.

[07-Aug-19 09:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Raising the value of the KMD.

Tokenomics are for tokens, not for coins!

you'll understand my context on the subject I expressed here.

[07-Aug-19 09:36 AM] Flint#6435
What do you need right now for a coin to be used by streamers, gamers, business, bloggers? This is a reward system integrated directly into the target services! How to do this - a question for the project specialists - maybe for a start a browser extension? Is it technically how complicated?

[07-Aug-19 09:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can also talk about investing side of my views, but I guess I'm not the right person to talk about. That may be for some other future days. üôÇ

[07-Aug-19 09:37 AM] CoinKing88#1540
guys KMD +2 cents last half hour, new marketing is working!!!!

[07-Aug-19 09:39 AM] Flint#6435
@CoinKing88 üòÇ  and we just started to warm up before the fight!

[07-Aug-19 09:41 AM] CoinKing88#1540
I also think ppl who whine here so hard are just invested too much, if its a % you wont lose a second sleep over you wouldnt react so extreme.

[07-Aug-19 09:43 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Isn't it reasonable to wait until the price reaches 0? Can only say how good the project is, can't make a suggestion?

[07-Aug-19 09:43 AM] Flexatron#8809
Damn kmd new lows

[07-Aug-19 09:46 AM] QualityASSURANCE#1813
Wow

[07-Aug-19 09:48 AM] Flint#6435
how to preview images here?

[07-Aug-19 09:52 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Well what i do like: fiat pairs for KMD on Binance, listing on Coinbase. That would help KMD more than a few tweets

[07-Aug-19 09:53 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Its kind of sad that every shitcoin listing on Binance gets stablecoin pairs yet KMD doesnt have it

[07-Aug-19 09:55 AM] Flint#6435
@CoinKing88  you absolutely rightly noticed it!

[07-Aug-19 09:58 AM] Flint#6435
very little liquidity! what trading volumes are talking about! even if they are fake in some places, but I don‚Äôt think that they differ from the real ones by more than a million dollars! Why are so few exchanges involved? after all, the coin refused the obligatory confidentiality by giving this role to the ARRR pirates! And at the same time, different scam projects continue listing on different exchanges!

@Tek how much is dash paying you?

[07-Aug-19 11:10 AM] CoinKing88#1540
How can i ignore Tek's messages?

[07-Aug-19 11:10 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Does this channel let you mention anything? Can not be more low prices, can not market, can not say technology, can only say that KMD is very good?

[07-Aug-19 11:11 AM] Tek#5253
@hyperDEX nothing, but atleast dash has constant news to share

[07-Aug-19 11:11 AM] weldon.gull5#3242

[07-Aug-19 11:12 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Every time there is a big BUYWALL, it will create a new low.

[07-Aug-19 11:12 AM] Tek#5253
@hyperDEX I can stake my dash for 6% annually if i want

[07-Aug-19 11:13 AM] Tek#5253
shared masternodes are a thing now

[07-Aug-19 11:15 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
If KMD joins the new exchange, or has great news, or the price increases, everyone will be happy to send it to other altcoin channels.

[07-Aug-19 11:15 AM] Tek#5253
obviously. kmd only has > muh tech so good to share

[07-Aug-19 11:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Tek I think you need to get into verge or ripple.

[07-Aug-19 11:32 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Ripple is better, everyday new emissions to make your coins less scarce.

[07-Aug-19 11:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Everyday partnership not using ripple to get more adoption üòõ

[07-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Tek#5253
ripple has 400 markets to trade

[07-Aug-19 11:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It started with 1

[07-Aug-19 11:37 AM] Tek#5253
kmd has 30

[07-Aug-19 11:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Tek why not go full trontard?

You can bow to Justin the almighty

[07-Aug-19 11:40 AM] phm87#7395
@hyperDEX xvg is on my pool since years. I had more than 30 000 miners. We learnt a lot about scaling and marketing from xvg. Not really about tech tbh
Kmd helped me to learn about tech, about communities but I learnt nearly nothing here abt marketing sorry.
I think that each coin can help us to learn sth. Whatever coin is good or bad (I don t like xvg)

[07-Aug-19 11:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You could have learnt the same lessons with another popular coin. So this is silver lining, not really that XVG did anything for this space.

[07-Aug-19 11:43 AM] phm87#7395
My pool went from 1000 miners to 30 000 in few hours due to dual miner claymore.
For the story, I added xvg because it was easy to mine before claymore dual and mcafee tweet

[07-Aug-19 11:44 AM] phm87#7395
My pool was a risk for xvg. I received 500 tweets in one day when an update was mandatory. It was fun

[07-Aug-19 11:47 AM] Tek#5253
> mining one of the shittiest shitcoins was fun

How can you say bad things about them Tek?

[07-Aug-19 11:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[07-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Tek#5253
dash is great

[07-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Tek#5253
you'll learn later

[07-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Tek#5253
or you wont

[07-Aug-19 11:52 AM] phm87#7395
As I wrote, I added xvg on my pool when it was tiny, before mcafee and claymore dual blake2s. I keep it because miners like it.
I won t have the same xp with dash or xmr

[07-Aug-19 11:53 AM] PHBA2061#2530
imo, what most other projects call marketing, is just pure shilling.
During the last Antara ama, it was revealed that some big companies are interested in Antara (supposed it is true), for me that is the true result of true marketing.

[07-Aug-19 11:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Tek but you said you would not market something because you need to get paid for it and you had no time to do it since you only want to look at the computer when you are at work

[07-Aug-19 11:55 AM] Tek#5253
yea

[07-Aug-19 11:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@PHBA2061 paid ads, i wonder about the ROI on the verge 2M pornhub partnership lol

Something about the writing style

[07-Aug-19 12:12 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Can't name it tho
