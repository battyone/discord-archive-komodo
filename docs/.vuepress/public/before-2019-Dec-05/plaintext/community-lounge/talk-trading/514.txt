For me, the biggest shitcoins are LTC and Doge.  Neither solved any problems and have made zero innovations since their inception.  Yet, they remain popular and have high market caps

I also like bowling, as do more people than use crypto, did the A3 pinsetter solve 'one of the most significant problems in human history"

eliminating the need for a trusted 3rd party to transfer value from peer to peer is not solving a major problem?

Evolutionarily speaking, an electronic cash system that BTC started is what will likely help us advance as a human race.  My point is, you seem to make it sound like BTC solved one insignificant problem.  With all this hate for BTC, you must be satoshi's ex-wife or something.  😄

[04-Apr-19 01:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

`That BTC solved an insignificant problem and is overall a shitcoin`
see, here's where you say one thing and then back-peddle to make response to mean something other than it is
you said 'one of the most significant problems **in human history**', and I've repeatedly said that on that scale it is insignificant. This is factually true because of length and scale.
We can debate the merits of BTC being a useless commodity whereby Core has wrecked its ability to be a useful currency after you accept that in the scale of what you stated, you were wrong

[04-Apr-19 01:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
computers aren't even a blink of an eye on that scale

[04-Apr-19 01:13 AM] richardt#2807
I'm not back-peddling.  It is one of the most significant problems in human history because relying on the current currency system that we have will not help us advance as a race

[04-Apr-19 01:50 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I hope all you guys debating about the currency aspect of BTC,  will help out with my radical idea for a new kind of currency.  The crux of it being setting the price-value=0 , since it is the only sustainable price that can be had, allowing 0% interest credit , thus removing the quality of “store of value “ from the money and focus entirely on being a medium of exchange .  I’m writing a more in depth piece on how it will work,  but the general gist is a bidding / burn economy.

{Reactions}
🤔 

[04-Apr-19 01:55 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I view the root problem is that money is a superior commodity which incentivizes hoarding ,  things have value based on utility, small pieces of paper or bits on a computer have little utility in themselves

[04-Apr-19 01:58 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Money also doesn’t degrade,  its price-value may fluctuate but , 1BTC = 1BTC, where real world commodities depreciate over time
