Veil? You expect that most people understand or care, most would probably think it's a positive thing

[15-Mar-19 02:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
True

Whalebro bought 25btc worth of KMD around 29k sats

[15-Mar-19 02:59 PM] Tek#5253

[15-Mar-19 02:59 PM] Tek#5253

2W MACD is getting closer to a longterm bullish reversal indicating most of the selling exhausted. This would be an ideal moment to buy some crypto every month throughout 2019 and wait for the longterm bullish reversal. https://www.tradingview.com/x/n3JldE53/

[16-Mar-19 01:25 AM] yorklab#7270
Might be because bitcoin is going up. I think a lot of people are expecting bitcoin to make a big move in one direction or the other soon.

[16-Mar-19 01:55 AM] Markus#5464

We got a short term break out.

Side note: Interesting how Kraken has a much more well-formed volume pattern than, say, BitMEX.

that green volume bar on weekly answers it all i guess
they have some things lined up as well, keep accumulating the dips and target 4700 for now, if the ih&s comes in play, i think we can see 8000 after that
