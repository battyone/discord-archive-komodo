I keep hearing about Bitcoin market manipulation all the time.  I only assume it's true, but you never really know for sure. I thought the  ICE news was huge and could be the start of a long term rally, but the market has come down since. Hard to believe that's anything but manipulation and the big players are accumulating now.

[04-Aug-18 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
feken burger-flippers, man
you give these feks $0.50 p/h raise (which is barely more than $1k per year) and they act with gratitude like you sucked their dik for a week
you take their $500 investment and turn it into $7500 in 27 months and they act like you killed their favorite dog

irl, "BTC market rekt" = "I read all the bullshit, got suckered, bought on the bubble, and have less value because I made a stupid decision"

[04-Aug-18 03:59 PM] crumb#2550
agree with genie on this one. so many people have totally lost all perspective

Buy a $100K home (or any other actual tangible object) and see if it's worth $1,500,000 in 27 months....

Still too many copy paste/vaporware shitcoins out there.  Majority of investors are completely clueless.

@actionslacks UNIT is a prime example of that; the market is **still** overvalued for if because of a shitopia bot malfunction in Dec that n00bs followed the price on

[04-Aug-18 04:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
It was a ton of: "I never heard of this UNIT thing, but the price is mooning, I better get me some..."

[04-Aug-18 04:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_sold like $4 worth of UNIT for like $8k on the bot high_

[04-Aug-18 04:15 PM] actionslacks#4072
Dec was fun. Felt like the whole world was buying with both fists.

[04-Aug-18 04:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and that's where all the "rekt" and roof-jumpers come in, they all thought it was going to last forever

I had some grand vision that it was just the start of the adoption curve

[04-Aug-18 04:20 PM] actionslacks#4072
nope, just a gigapump

[04-Aug-18 04:21 PM] yorklab#7270
2011 $BTC Bubble pops $32 - $2:  94% retrace
2013 $BTC Bubble pops $230 - $70:  70% retrace
2015 $BTC Bubble pops $1200 - $173:  85% retrace
2018 $BTC Bubble pops $20,000 - $5800:  71% retrace

Maybe it doesn't apply to today's market, but interesting anyway.

[04-Aug-18 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The real problem with BTC adoption isn't the "mainstream", it's that Core wants it to be a commodity, not a currency, and people refuse to understand the difference and let go of BTC "god" status for currencies.

[04-Aug-18 04:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
Ignorance and apathy towards the financial system. The last crash gave birth to bitcoin. The next one will likely be it's coming of age.

we just need to wait it out. the sentiment will change from bearish to bullish at some point. no rush

Damn, that Cred app that just added KMD is another one of those sites like Robinhood that only lets you buy crypto but not withdraw it. Ugg.

[04-Aug-18 08:10 PM] tolken#2655
was looking to buy some kmd directly. Maybe I still will but damn that‚Äôs frustrating. The company isn‚Äôt too far from me, might be cool to pick their brains about if that‚Äôs even on their roadmap to open that up.

[04-Aug-18 08:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You can‚Äôt withdraw it?
