KMD still better than anything out there because of the scalability

[22-Nov-19 07:54 PM] zenosama#5371
as a newcomer I don't quite get few things "Gateway CC would allow to tokenize BTC onchain of the CC chain. Then you do CC things to the BTC tokens and, when done, can redeem it back to a BTC address."   What would be an efficient real life purpose for people to create such tokens? And what role in this would komodo currency play?

[22-Nov-19 07:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Bitcoin backed pegged assets and derivatives.   Lowering blocktime to allow for quicker atomic swaps.

[22-Nov-19 08:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Komodo coin itself doesn‚Äôt play a role in that feature , fees from swaps of them though get converted to KMD

[22-Nov-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
same point as wrapped BTC on ETH chain

I think the American economy is about to repeat the great depression.

[22-Nov-19 10:10 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Just a hunch, it really feels like the stock market has become the wild west

[22-Nov-19 10:10 PM] BlackJesus#6161
And soon the biggest winners will strip the stock market of their money and last one out won't have anything due to the inflated value in the market itself.

[22-Nov-19 10:11 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Cryptos will most likely be a safe haven and as of late they seem to be acting inversely to the stock market which has made me extremely bullish

[22-Nov-19 10:18 PM] crumb#2550
crypto USD values will **initially** sink with equity markets, but as soon as FED, ECB and other central banks announce coordinated new rounds of quantitative easing...

[22-Nov-19 10:19 PM] crumb#2550
crypto values will soar beyond our wildest dreams

[22-Nov-19 10:20 PM] crumb#2550
as then more people will wake up and want to find a new store of value

[22-Nov-19 10:23 PM] crumb#2550
but i think it would be foolish to hope that they will not tank with other assets initially. they still qualify as 'risky assets' and those will get sold first in any economic downturn

[22-Nov-19 10:28 PM] crumb#2550
QE is the only tool they have left. interest rates are already ridiculously low.
and as in 2008 the central bankers will tell the world that bailouts and QE are necessary, as it's the only way to avoid systemic collapse. people will be unhappy of course, but accept it as they have done with all similar situations before, throughout the history

[22-Nov-19 10:30 PM] crumb#2550
so yeah. in long term, crypto is the way to go :rum:

with the devaluation of the dollar and the euro, i see only one direction for crypto, gold etc

[22-Nov-19 11:26 PM] crumb#2550
yes, some central banks do it right now

[22-Nov-19 11:27 PM] crumb#2550
but they will ramp up the volumes **massively** is something serious would happen to the world economy and/or equity markets

[22-Nov-19 11:27 PM] crumb#2550
*if something serious

[22-Nov-19 11:28 PM] crumb#2550
it's important to take note that short term loss of buying power for people is mostly invisible

[22-Nov-19 11:29 PM] Deltazulu#2710
i hope you mean  "some central banks" sarcastic, ECB and the FED are mostly the whole western civilisation

[22-Nov-19 11:30 PM] crumb#2550
there is also BOJ and BOE

[22-Nov-19 11:30 PM] crumb#2550
japan and england respectively

[22-Nov-19 11:30 PM] crumb#2550
and of course let's not forget chinese

[22-Nov-19 11:31 PM] Deltazulu#2710
they are ALL devaluating their currencys since years

[22-Nov-19 11:31 PM] crumb#2550
yes, that is my point

[22-Nov-19 11:32 PM] Deltazulu#2710
the hidden inflation in the EU alone is ca 6- 7 %

[22-Nov-19 11:32 PM] crumb#2550
they move together, so prices of metals, art, real estate etc. have all gone up a lot

[22-Nov-19 11:33 PM] Deltazulu#2710
and now they come with negative interest

[22-Nov-19 11:33 PM] crumb#2550
you know that, i know that, a lot of people here basically know that, but we are a small small minority

[22-Nov-19 11:33 PM] crumb#2550
most people out there don't have a clue...

[22-Nov-19 11:34 PM] crumb#2550
quite sad

[22-Nov-19 11:34 PM] Deltazulu#2710
yes, the prices of the estate market since 2008  in the EU had a plus of ca 100%

[22-Nov-19 11:34 PM] Deltazulu#2710
in 11 years

[22-Nov-19 11:35 PM] Deltazulu#2710
thats ot sustainable

[22-Nov-19 11:35 PM] crumb#2550
of course it is not, but there is a lot of money looking for returns

[22-Nov-19 11:36 PM] crumb#2550
and with QE the amount of money is ever increasing

[22-Nov-19 11:37 PM] crumb#2550
real estate for some reason is considered a "safe" investment, so banks give loans quite easily if you want to buy some

[22-Nov-19 11:37 PM] Deltazulu#2710
the hard fact is, the first who will stop with the devaluation, they will have a great problem

[22-Nov-19 11:38 PM] crumb#2550
no one will stop. they can't now

[22-Nov-19 11:38 PM] crumb#2550
this can go on for years still, before anything serious will happen.

[22-Nov-19 11:38 PM] Deltazulu#2710
it will end bad

[22-Nov-19 11:39 PM] crumb#2550
yeah, not if but when

[22-Nov-19 11:39 PM] Deltazulu#2710
but where will the new money go, that is the question

[22-Nov-19 11:40 PM] crumb#2550
the new money will go to same places mostly i'd think. and of course at some point people figure out the positive sides of crypto üòõ

[22-Nov-19 11:40 PM] Deltazulu#2710
and that is the point where i see a great chance for crypto

[22-Nov-19 11:41 PM] crumb#2550
well like i said we can still be years away from that

[22-Nov-19 11:41 PM] Deltazulu#2710
i wouldnt be surprised, if at some point that FIAT will be backuped with crypto

[22-Nov-19 11:42 PM] crumb#2550
could be. in distant future totally possible

[22-Nov-19 11:42 PM] crumb#2550
Andreas had a pretty good lecture on Youtube where he talked about infrastructure inversion

[22-Nov-19 11:43 PM] crumb#2550
one of the examples was that in the beginning internet was running on phone lines and now, phone lines and almost all communication runs on the internet

[22-Nov-19 11:44 PM] crumb#2550
infrastructure inversion

[22-Nov-19 11:44 PM] Deltazulu#2710
yes, he has some good arguments

[22-Nov-19 11:44 PM] crumb#2550
totally possible for money to do the same thing in the future

[22-Nov-19 11:50 PM] Deltazulu#2710
what i feel very positive for crypto is, that it is the first decentralised and non-inflationary over time metric for a valuation for assets and things, the first in human history

[22-Nov-19 11:51 PM] Deltazulu#2710
that could be the game-changer

It definitely feels like something big is about to happen. I think another banker bailout would be a step too far for most of the plebs. explains why the QE is now just being done without any fanfare or real explanation.

Be a step too far for the plebs?

I don't completely understand what you're referring to

[23-Nov-19 03:22 AM] actionslacks#4072
there was quite bit of anger amongst US citizens after the 2008 bailout. so much so that many people stopped doing business with certain banks, occupy wall st, etc.
