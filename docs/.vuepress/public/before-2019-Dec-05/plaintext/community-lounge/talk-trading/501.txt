if VBK is minable and people already hold VBK then the IEO will just let people open sell orders in bittrex ?

[01-Apr-19 12:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or is the IEO based on a specific entity selling the coin from a centralized fund?

[01-Apr-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
it is an ICO

[01-Apr-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
just hosted on an exchange

[01-Apr-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
VBK sales are from the central fund

[01-Apr-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
insiders got it for fraction of penny, advisors a bit more, private placement OTC at 5 cents, all will make at least double at the IEO which will include the obligatory pump

Should I dump KMD and go all in?

[01-Apr-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
they do 1000x more BTC tx than KMD, so does that make them 1000x better?

[01-Apr-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
since its closed source, seems hard to answer many questions

[01-Apr-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no source to see, no rpc documented. it could be that there is actually no code to deal with altchain security, or it could be totally bugfree

[01-Apr-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
just undocumented and closed source

[01-Apr-19 01:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's amazing this is closed source, i am searching for the right memes

get $18 million, pay $5 mil to "advisors" that pump and list on exchange, burn a few million in BTC txfees to create a buzz, sell at double the insiders price (or maybe 10x), dump into the post IEO pump. release the source code to the community after "realizing" the fundamental design needs a bit of improving

They better start hoarding KMD so they can PoP to the KMD chain ;p

see it as free Marketing KMD has a proven solution that works.
Maybe some projects will realize that later and join the eco system.

Total Supply of $VBK is 2.1Bn NOT the circulating supply. Current circulating supply is 285M. Breakdown of 285M is;

55M > Testnet Participants (PoW & PoP Miners)
89M > Future Initiatives (Veriblock Team)
70M > IEO
67.5M > Veriblock Company
2M > Mined since mainnet started

who is doing their PR, we need them here in KMD.

isnt bittrex ceo listed as a advisor for VBK?

[01-Apr-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
they paid $5 million to advisors for this PR

yes, trex is vested

[01-Apr-19 02:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I mean, damn, how come people spend months or years talking and not agreeing about decentralization but yet go and approve something like that?

[01-Apr-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
from what I can tell, their raised the funds to pay the advisors and BTC txfees and mined most of the testnet

i've put some ridiculous low buy orders for KMD incase whalebro fatfingers a market dump

[01-Apr-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so the team most likely has 200 million+ VBK and is trying to make a pump at well above the 10 cent price. But the question remains, where is the actual utility?

[01-Apr-19 02:41 PM] Tek#5253
I only mess with the top 200

@gmaloneyy Altchains publish checkpoints to VBK's chain (paying vbk tx fees) and VBK's chain gets published into BTC's chain.  

These checkpoints are relied upon by exchanges for Early Attack Detection to prevent losses due to 51% attack double-spends.

[01-Apr-19 03:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
they sure do know the lingo

[01-Apr-19 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
so the same exchanges that couldnt be bothered to issue a few rpc calls to check for notarization, is already using the undocumented close source rpc calls to detect the attack early, i guess soon after it is done?

"During the last 24 hours 8.39441653 BTC have been spend on fees to PoP mine a total of 216706.64861397 VBK"

more more more, pamp it until we damp it

[01-Apr-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
thats a pace of 3000 BTC per year, which at $4000 BTC is only $12 million per year, to not secure the chains that didnt modify their code to follow the closed source rpc calls that are not documented

[01-Apr-19 03:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is like a sketch comedy

[01-Apr-19 03:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if i have a chain and want to use VBK, how much will i need to pay to get their security?

it is not relevant, because there is no api to integrate that would protect against reorgs of the consensus agreed chain

because it is not the consensus chain that is being notarized, but whatever miner paid the most

[01-Apr-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is good that no chains are using this as the attacker can use it to enhance  their reorg powers

of course there isn't. I am trying to make the average people in the back seats understand that these questions need answers, and when they inevitably will ignore them, well that is a form of answering

also, I have not verified if it's only hosted or all blackminer FPGAs can currently mine VBK. Not many people have access to mine it via FPGAs, either way. But whoever is, will be dumping from the day 1 at any price, because its so much more profitable than anything else right now
