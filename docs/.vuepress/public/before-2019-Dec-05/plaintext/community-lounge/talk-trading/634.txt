i used to work at the Samsung store at Westfield which got closed in 2014

[11-May-19 11:08 PM] nocturnal#2177

[11-May-19 11:08 PM] SHossain#0007
just before joining Samsung i completed making the first and only insight based BTCD explorer

[11-May-19 11:08 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, startford westfield

[11-May-19 11:09 PM] nocturnal#2177
i dont know what that is but it sounds cool

[11-May-19 11:10 PM] SHossain#0007
it's the block explorer you use. kmdexplorer.io is insight based explorer

[11-May-19 11:11 PM] SHossain#0007
around 2014 there weren't much development or docs to setup insight explorer for altcoins

[11-May-19 11:11 PM] Markus#5464
7400 wtf

[11-May-19 11:11 PM] SHossain#0007

Wish me luck

[11-May-19 11:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
man, there are some risky strategies in here.  Why would you not hold at least some BTC?

[11-May-19 11:15 PM] Vertigo#0439
$7400

[11-May-19 11:15 PM] nocturnal#2177
im about 80% btc but i dont have that much

[11-May-19 11:15 PM] Vertigo#0439
Is there resistance anywhere?

[11-May-19 11:16 PM] Vertigo#0439
20k maybe?

[11-May-19 11:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
20k

[11-May-19 11:16 PM] nocturnal#2177
resistance is futile

[11-May-19 11:17 PM] nocturnal#2177
do you think could be tether related at all?

[11-May-19 11:17 PM] nocturnal#2177
they printed 300m recently and supposedly trying to get rid of it cos of their troubles?

[11-May-19 11:20 PM] Vertigo#0439
I said that yesterday but was no comments lol

[11-May-19 11:20 PM] Vertigo#0439
Let's just hope this is an organic grown BTC.

[11-May-19 11:21 PM] nocturnal#2177
it feels more like steroids but lets hope so

[11-May-19 11:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Market cap has rised much more than 300m

[11-May-19 11:21 PM] nocturnal#2177
yes but a large move sucks in many other buyers

[11-May-19 11:21 PM] hyperDEX#6586
300m injected into markets does not mean that MC will only go up 300m

[11-May-19 11:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I know

[11-May-19 11:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Maybe its being use to break big resistances like right now

[11-May-19 11:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I can see binance/bitfinex, 100x long
