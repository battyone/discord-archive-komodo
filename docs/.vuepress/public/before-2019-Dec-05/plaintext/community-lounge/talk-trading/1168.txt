Blockchain is still a toy for most of the world, so anything will seem expensive.

[07-Oct-19 10:35 AM] tolken#2655
Won‚Äôt seem expensive to those who see its power. Those are far and few in between so far though.

@siu - Chainmakers might also be related to the fact that we are still in a bearish market
I think it's good you charge a decent amount (and it's not too high for what you offer). Also works a bit as a quality filter

[07-Oct-19 10:58 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its not even about filtering. Its about work

[07-Oct-19 10:59 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You can use html to code a website yourself for free, yet you pay for someone else to do it because its work

[07-Oct-19 10:59 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Same thing applies here

[07-Oct-19 11:00 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I dont see how else this is not being deceiving on purpose

[07-Oct-19 11:21 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
For filtering I mean people who are serious about their project.
I agree, work should be paid and you are offering a great service

[07-Oct-19 11:23 AM] house#8741
Aren‚Äôt the fees priced in kmd?
Meaning when we finally hit the greased skids, the price for these services will be very cheap for those who accumulate now

$KMD #KOMODO

Reached T1 & T2 for +16% here.

Would be lovely to consolidate above 745-750 for a potential attack of the upper range at 850.

Breaking above 850 and this thing can definitely start to fly.

Haagse game-startup die miljoenen zou ophalen kan leveranciers nie...
De Haagse game-startup Komodore64, die eerder dit jaar met veel tromgeroffel een investering van 78 miljoen euro aankondigde, kampt met ernstige geldproblemen. Dat blijkt uit het verhaal van gedupeerde leveranciers, waarvan een het bedrijf voor de rechter daagt.

translation in a sentence or two ?

[07-Oct-19 12:25 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I use google translate, if this turn out to be true, I feel bad for those who spend their time & efforts defending Komodore64 ...

[07-Oct-19 12:28 PM] house#8741
```CSS
The game startup Komodore64 from The Hague, which announced an investment of 78 million euros earlier this year with a lot of drumming, is struggling with serious money problems. This is evident from the story of duped suppliers, one of which takes the company to court.```

[07-Oct-19 12:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Someone coming out of the woodworks claiming they did some work for K64. Did not get paid.
Also Fokker terminal where they did the expo did not get paid, these are now trying to claim payment through lawsuits.
An anonymous supplier says they leave a 'trail of wreckage', also the personal is supposedly not being paid for a while.
among others Vectrix and lawyer firm De Clerq has not had contact with k64 for a while.
Sam Narain is calling the past period very stressful, alledging at the 'death threats' from the komodo community.

[07-Oct-19 12:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
'liquidity issues' is a big word, says Narain the situation they are in. We have the funding, yet we can't spend it yet.

[07-Oct-19 12:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Among other reasons, Sam is claiming the quitting of Max Theyse and a conflict with Rfox as reasons

[07-Oct-19 12:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Because of an unsafe situation they had to move to a different location.

[07-Oct-19 12:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
After rebuying a couple of coins, the threats have been less

[07-Oct-19 12:32 PM] Neko#5830
glad the komodo team distanced themselves from k64 a long time ago

[07-Oct-19 12:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah that is the translation of *‚ÄúWe hebben funding gekregen die we nog niet uit kunnen geven en hebben door omstandigheden cashflow-problemen.‚Äù*

breakout an retest?

[08-Oct-19 08:50 AM] CHMEX#0686
Looks like Binance is not claiming all rewards yet.
kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/98153f72509427d0cbc2bc4d0a6c7fea2de705948a953e2308e15711be38ac58
A reason could be they have cold store and when they move it to their hotwallet the transactions is created and signed offline without calculating the Rewards.

[08-Oct-19 09:09 AM] Oszy#5734
that explains their terrible distribution

[08-Oct-19 09:24 AM] Lieutenant#1428
someone hard sells on binance.
1)  Green candle buy 400k kmd
2) –êfter pump 500k kmd sold within 24 hours

[08-Oct-19 09:26 AM] CHMEX#0686
Oszy: also there Vo9KWjXT address which in my understanding is the hotwallet does not consolidate the utxo once a month

[08-Oct-19 09:27 AM] CHMEX#0686
so it's just want they get extra from their day to day deposit and withdrawal actions

[08-Oct-19 09:42 AM] Deltazulu#2710
@Lieutenant why you think that this is just 1 person?

[08-Oct-19 10:25 AM] Markus#5464
U can see that its a whale playing games to make few % here and there, just imagine 5-10% on 500k kmd thats pretty good profit

[08-Oct-19 11:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Looks like the guy waiting at 6.6k fomoed and bought 400k up to 8k

[08-Oct-19 11:18 AM] Deltazulu#2710
thats all just speculation, no facts

[08-Oct-19 11:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Only CZ knows so we can only work off assumptions

[08-Oct-19 11:23 AM] Deltazulu#2710
true, thats why i would never give meaning to such speculations

[08-Oct-19 11:24 AM] Deltazulu#2710
why proving or disproving something you will never know?

[08-Oct-19 11:25 AM] Deltazulu#2710
so it makes no sense to work with such speculations
