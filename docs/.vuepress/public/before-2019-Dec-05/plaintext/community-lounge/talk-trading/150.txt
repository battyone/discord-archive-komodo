KMD seems to be among the lowest volumes in the top 50+ at least.

[12-Sep-18 08:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Why didn’t I dump the top!

[12-Sep-18 08:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

the fiat value of the "top" was a missed opportunity only for full exit from crypto

[12-Sep-18 08:47 AM] snowdamn#2414
for those here to stay, it's a reference point 😉

seems to me time to find a job to have money to buy more KMD for these prices

komodo below 0.50 cents would be an amazing bargain

[12-Sep-18 09:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
btc would have to hit 4k for kmd to go that low. Btc hits 4k and the stock market crashes

[12-Sep-18 10:00 AM] actionslacks#4072
but it would be quite the show

I think the whale with 111,000 bitcoin is starting to sell. There is no real news that stands out as the culprit.

yeah... our goverment is not as broke as others, but the public debt here is off the chain, a rise in intrest rates of a few percent and most of the people with a mortgage are not gonna be able to pay it.

[12-Sep-18 11:01 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
On adjustable rate mortgages sure

[12-Sep-18 11:01 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fixed rate just means your home value goes down when interest jumps

[12-Sep-18 11:02 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Afterall, home prices are based on available financing options and ability to pay

[12-Sep-18 11:02 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
If all you can pay is say $2500/mo

[12-Sep-18 11:02 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Interest rates rise, principal goes down to maintain $2500
