btc reaching overbought rsi territory

[18-Feb-19 04:56 PM] Markus#5464
on daily

[18-Feb-19 05:17 PM] Wazzup#0510
On Ranging markets use RSI

[18-Feb-19 05:17 PM] Wazzup#0510
on Trending MA s

[18-Feb-19 05:17 PM] Wazzup#0510
and S/R levels

[18-Feb-19 05:17 PM] Wazzup#0510
I would also add that you should look for divergences only on RSI

[18-Feb-19 05:18 PM] Wazzup#0510
Else price can go down while oversold and up while overbought

That moment when a 10% gain makes you magically forget teh 56% loss you hit 3 months ago 😕

...but that 1 btc has no buying power because by the time you pay $137 in tx fees the price drops back down :troll:

[18-Feb-19 07:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because they didn't buy ad space on cmc?

🤣 

[18-Feb-19 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Markus the "official" answer is:
```Some prices are manually excluded from the average, denoted by an asterisk (*) on the markets tab if the price does not seem indicative of a free market price; for example, when an exchange disables withdrawals or deposits, or regulatory conditions make it impossible for anyone else outside of a certain geographical region to buy coins.```

is there a new site now?

it's pretty much a transition period to mm2.0. it's being tested actively as we speak.

[18-Feb-19 08:45 PM] jorian#4555
dexstats.info doesn't register those swaps yet

Kmd almost at a fourloko price.

[18-Feb-19 11:40 PM] actionslacks#4072
Kmd richlist is filling out nicely. I think the 5% rewards are attracting attention. We got like 10 more years of rewards or something?

Hi

[19-Feb-19 01:31 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@Markus they only recently changed the way they traded KMD. Before you could only buy/sell in amounts of 0.0001btc. They had refused to change it, or update their daemon i believe

[19-Feb-19 03:01 AM] Likewise#6767
a heatlhy pull back is needed to sustain a decent uptrend.

[19-Feb-19 03:01 AM] Likewise#6767
healthy

[19-Feb-19 03:03 AM] Likewise#6767
volume increased massively, usually on binance on non pump/dump days we had 50 or less BTC volume, would get pumped to 150 200, max I ever saw it was around 550. Now we are at  1050 BTC volume. Looking good I'd say...?

[19-Feb-19 03:17 AM] Likewise#6767
how far will it pull back ? Hmm, I'm thinking we bounce and not go below 2300 - 2250. Just my 2 cents

[19-Feb-19 03:18 AM] Likewise#6767
guess all depends if we are in a real sustainable bull trend or not??

if that helps the cause, I'd say go right ahead 😃

[19-Feb-19 04:46 AM] Alecandro#1179
Yea I think a pullback is healthy. We were up over 50% in a week, nothing wrong with taking a step back

[19-Feb-19 05:26 AM] Alecandro#1179
I agree with you @Likewise I think we bounce around 22.5k

[19-Feb-19 05:27 AM] Alecandro#1179
Then to 33k we go 🤭

{Reactions}
👍 

[19-Feb-19 05:28 AM] Likewise#6767
That looks like the next hurdle 32-33K.......small correction and continue on, that is how we want the bull run to look like.......on and on with minor corrections for good balance.

[19-Feb-19 05:31 AM] Alecandro#1179
Exactly
