How many times is this shitcoin going to test $6k

@Hollowman9000  `Today at 8:39 PM

As many as it takes to drop it to sub-$4300 where it belongs?

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 mining question: are your invoices in BTCor fiat?

[11-Oct-18 05:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I haven't mined BTC in close to 2 years and I don't know how to mine fiat; so, the answer is "neither"

[11-Oct-18 05:41 AM] snowdamn#2414
lol

[11-Oct-18 05:41 AM] snowdamn#2414
i mean what do you pay rentals with

[11-Oct-18 05:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
rentals from nh are BTC only

[11-Oct-18 05:41 AM] snowdamn#2414

[11-Oct-18 05:42 AM] snowdamn#2414
i would say that game is for smarter people than me keeping track with such volatility, although might average out when it goes in your favor 🤔

[11-Oct-18 05:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sadly enough, there's no direct correlation to nh prices and BTC/USD. I've seen BTC go up by $1k and NH prices *rise* 😣

[11-Oct-18 05:46 AM] snowdamn#2414
ain't that some shit? 😜

[11-Oct-18 05:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
shit like that is why I never use rentals for an extended amount of time

[11-Oct-18 05:47 AM] snowdamn#2414
i don't blame you

[11-Oct-18 05:48 AM] snowdamn#2414

BTC is in gamble territory

[11-Oct-18 05:48 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  I can share a secret with you how to mine fiat. You get up early in the mornign, going t oa corporate or other computer job when your boss understand very little of what oyu are doing, and do some boring + useless coding for marketing + sales guys so they can sell some shit nobody use. It's in some ways similar to mining crypto :pirate:

2 flaws - well that's why I quit. There is more flaws actually - "no point in life", "boring job", nobody needs it" :pirate:

[11-Oct-18 05:51 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but hey mining is always investment and is risky + requires some discomfort, right ?

[11-Oct-18 05:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, when everything is working right, crypto mining is about the most boring job I've ever had

[11-Oct-18 05:52 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also if world would be perfect - could be most boring too

I gambled with the slot machines on Lightning. The problem is I quadrupled my money...

Since it was a brand new channel I couldn't receive more than i put into the Casino. There was no way to withdraw my winnings.

The house always wins I guess 🤷‍♂️

bad thing with crypto is that you always want MOAR
i once started contemplating exit prices and after many days of thought i came up with exit prices for only 10% of my portfolio 😅 
crazy in crypto willing to HODL through -85% drops and even after reaching price goals
too bullish to let go, will i be right?

[11-Oct-18 05:58 AM] snowdamn#2414
it can't be that crypto will not pass $1T

[11-Oct-18 05:58 AM] snowdamn#2414
can it?

[11-Oct-18 05:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Anything over 7% gain is gravy

[11-Oct-18 05:59 AM] snowdamn#2414

Every reason that 99% of everything I make goes right back in. I will be "comfortable" for a long time to come, but comparatively speaking my bags are stupid tiny.

`Some speculators argue that these price movements are due to the regulatory problems surrounding the trading of Bitcoin and recent actions by governments to crack down on the transfer of cryptocurrencies.`
There's an irony to the fact that the exact opposite claim is the selling point of every maximalist. 😕

They were supposed to do a coin swap from an old project (Peepcoin PCN) a few months back. Everyone got hyped, price went from nothing to 20 sats on PCN, then they announced the swap was canceled due to the old dev holding too many
