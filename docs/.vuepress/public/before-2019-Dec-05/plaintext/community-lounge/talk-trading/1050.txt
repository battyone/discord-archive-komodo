but he dont work without money))

[08-Aug-19 09:58 AM] Flint#6435
will we dump him at $ 10 at the same time and check the strength of the community?ü§î

I think the suggestion of @coingirl is that the other currencies usually have a recognizable CEO that drags thousands of followers, who usually "spread their word."  Jl is just a programmer C. has been here for years and I don't really know who Komodo's CEO is

Are you  really know  who  Nakamoto  \   BTC ceo is ?   But  BTC  12000 $  without CEO @costa2439

[08-Aug-19 10:53 AM] costa2439#3771
comparing cocacola with churrocola

[08-Aug-19 10:53 AM] costa2439#3771
btc doesn't need any of that

[08-Aug-19 10:53 AM] costa2439#3771
Komodo yes

[08-Aug-19 10:54 AM] costa2439#3771
centralize news in representative with many followers that they can spread.

[08-Aug-19 10:55 AM] costa2439#3771
right now it's a toothache follow komodo

[08-Aug-19 10:55 AM] nymkappa#9440
If you can bring influencer in the project you dont need a ceo ;)

[08-Aug-19 10:56 AM] Andersen#8337
If  JL777  start  dancing  like Buterin and  KYC  himself  ,  it's  been  last  day  i  hold KMD

[08-Aug-19 10:56 AM] costa2439#3771
marquetin funds should cover the expense of paying a good representative

[08-Aug-19 10:57 AM] costa2439#3771
jl is anonymous, it doesn't work

* it's not the function of him

[08-Aug-19 10:59 AM] Flint#6435
the confidentiality function on which they were betting has already been removed - whats next?

[08-Aug-19 11:02 AM] Flint#6435
and tomorrow the most liquid exchanges will force to abandon komodo under pressure from regulators, and then what next? dex is still far from mass adoption and institutional investors and legal businesses will not work with DEX! The largest trading volumes on centralized exchanges will remain so for a long time!

[08-Aug-19 11:05 AM] Flint#6435
@Andersen  On June 27, we saw a similar opportunity for the final as todays price movement, but then fell even lower!

[08-Aug-19 11:07 AM] Flint#6435
we can fall below the March low of 2017 if the dominance of bitcoin becomes 80% and higher! technical analysis of charts does not work in young cryptocurrency markets during panic sales!

[08-Aug-19 11:11 AM] crumb#2550
Flint, could you not end every single sentence with exclamation mark!?

[08-Aug-19 11:11 AM] Flint#6435
but if you buy for up to halving in the spring of 2020 - then there are good chances! You can allocate a certain amount weekly for averaging positions and this is an excellent strategy for a period of 6 months or more! as we will reach $ 1.8 again anyway soon! And then we will exceed the record of this year! Dont panic! The one who dumped this wants us to panic and sell for them at a low price! After all, a month ago we were at the top - the story repeats itself!

[08-Aug-19 11:12 AM] crumb#2550
it's used to emphasize a key point. when you use it in every single sentence it becomes meaningless

[08-Aug-19 11:12 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I think even so @Andersen has a point and its a great financial oportunity!

[08-Aug-19 11:12 AM] crumb#2550
also spammy and/or annoying

[08-Aug-19 11:13 AM] Buddz1993#5380
So Invest as you wish but kmd at 85 cents is for sure a good buy.

[08-Aug-19 11:13 AM] Flint#6435
@crumb  easy! how many do you need 3? ten? 20? because it‚Äôs really important to read the information once you pay attentionüòÜ !!!!!!!!

[08-Aug-19 11:13 AM] Buddz1993#5380
ofc we can go lower

[08-Aug-19 11:13 AM] Buddz1993#5380
but we can go also higher so

[08-Aug-19 11:14 AM] crumb#2550
whatever

[08-Aug-19 11:14 AM] nymkappa#9440
The thing is if you are scared to buy here it probably means its a good time to buy üòÇ

[08-Aug-19 11:15 AM] crumb#2550
can we go lower? of course

[08-Aug-19 11:15 AM] crumb#2550
does in mean it's not a good point to start scaling in? not at all

[08-Aug-19 11:15 AM] crumb#2550
it's all relative

[08-Aug-19 11:16 AM] crumb#2550
depends on allocation strategy, risk tolerance etc.

[08-Aug-19 11:17 AM] Flint#6435
depends on the term of your position - if it‚Äôs 1-2 months, it may not be worth investing a lot, but if you invest for a period of 6 months or more - now its a great time to buy, even if we fall another 20%

[08-Aug-19 11:17 AM] nymkappa#9440
Depends on your yolo skills as well

Investing in KMD and or any other project is a multi year investment

below $ 0.5 is very unlikely

@hyperDEX of course! to halving at least

[08-Aug-19 11:19 AM] crumb#2550
trading and investing are two different beasts. better to make clear distinction between the two

[08-Aug-19 11:21 AM] Flint#6435
yes - its dangerous to trade even bitcoin now

[08-Aug-19 11:21 AM] Flint#6435
need to wait for the consolidation of bitcoin or correction from the peak

[08-Aug-19 11:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Investing = long term, trading = TA voodoo

[08-Aug-19 11:22 AM] Flint#6435
oh yeaa

[08-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Flint#6435
Do not forget about the additional 5% of the profit from holding in the wallet - this is higher than the rate at the bank in US dollars

[08-Aug-19 11:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The thing is, it is understandable that price goes down causes concern for the holders, but the result should not just a whole bunch of inaction.

[08-Aug-19 11:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If we all put some effort in, where we can, i am sure price would be far far greater

[08-Aug-19 11:25 AM] Flint#6435
Ethereum cannot offer this yet and it is not known when the POS consensus algorithm will appear

[08-Aug-19 11:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The community has a responsibility to the collective, if not to themselves to do everything they can to increase the price through adoption and awareness.

[08-Aug-19 11:26 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Indeed, I bought more yesterday and I'm not complaining .

[08-Aug-19 11:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Complaining without action is useless üòÉ

[08-Aug-19 11:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Complaining and taking action = part of the solution

[08-Aug-19 11:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The reason why TA works is people believe it does. If people believed that the price will go up due to adoption and community marketing then it is a self fulfilling prophecy

[08-Aug-19 11:28 AM] Flint#6435
You are absolutely right! even your like and retweets will help more than inaction and nagging about how everything disappeared - everything returns to its place if the project is not scam! and this project is definitely not scam - we see products and an excellent team of geniuses

[08-Aug-19 11:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It will only take 1 tweet that some influential person sees on their feed to light the fire

[08-Aug-19 11:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes, we are playing the long game. We have no control over the markets and we dont have funds to waste on stupid buybacks. Teams with no tech do buybacks.

[08-Aug-19 11:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We will outlast all these scams and projects with no utility and rise from the ashes of all those alts.

[08-Aug-19 11:30 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I agree.

[08-Aug-19 11:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So the question people need to ask themselves, do i believe in the tech and the team? If so i do something to help with adoption. If you dont believe in the tech or the team and was waiting for a pump and dump, you picked the wrong coin and probably best to dump and get out before it goes to 0

[08-Aug-19 11:31 AM] Flint#6435
therefore, less nagging and go finally retweet and repost on social networks - it will take less than a minute, but even 100 such tweets will make the project better than pessimism and nagging‚òù

A weird post on reddit that gets seen by brian armstrong and we might be on coinbase tomorrow üòõ

[08-Aug-19 11:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Remember we are building the tech that is needed in the future 2 years ago. Without the first DEX backend failing, we would not have a much better one.

[08-Aug-19 11:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Now when all the govs want to crackdown, we have the only viable DEX

[08-Aug-19 11:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We are also making the market maker to do arbing with a CEX

[08-Aug-19 11:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So all these things are falling into place to have Komodo leap frog all the top 10/20/30 coins

[08-Aug-19 11:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So whilst price is low, you need to believe in the vision

[08-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Flint#6435
no JL 777 will do a miracle for us - this is community work! it will not work to sit passively and watch when the pump happens! rightly said - sell your coins - we do not need weak hands! those who benefit from the project will remain - the tech doesnt ache and knows its risk management

[08-Aug-19 11:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[08-Aug-19 11:38 AM] Flint#6435
and buy averaging - you are an investor and a member of a great project - we are young but we are already worth more than what speculators give according to the dump-pump scheme

[08-Aug-19 11:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We would not be where we are without it. Just look at blocknet

[08-Aug-19 11:40 AM] Flint#6435
I rely on Komodore64 as a member of the ecosystem that will bring more massive adoption

[08-Aug-19 11:41 AM] Flint#6435
computer and console games are billions of dollars and millions of users!

[08-Aug-19 11:43 AM] crumb#2550
if not Komodore64 then definitely someone else. proof of gameplay is a powerful concept.

[08-Aug-19 11:44 AM] crumb#2550
plus this can be transferred to other areas, where proof of progress is needed

[08-Aug-19 11:44 AM] Flint#6435
powerful but still underestimated

[08-Aug-19 11:44 AM] crumb#2550
time-tracking software for example

[08-Aug-19 11:45 AM] crumb#2550
yes, it's underestimated because it is a new concept

[08-Aug-19 11:46 AM] crumb#2550
some time in the future gamers will wonder how it's was at all possible to have games without having it üòõ

[08-Aug-19 11:46 AM] Flint#6435
I recall the game gold like in WoW only the blockchain makes it better and more technologically advanced to the requirements of the modern digital world and it is more liquid and gives an incentive to earn these tokens in the game process

[08-Aug-19 11:47 AM] crumb#2550
following Komodo tech development sometimes feels like time travel üòÉ

[08-Aug-19 11:48 AM] crumb#2550
using crypto solely as in-game currency is such limited thinking

[08-Aug-19 11:48 AM] crumb#2550
wider implications of crypto tech are much more exciting

[08-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Flint#6435
thats for sure! because smart economics used to be difficult to integrate into games.... but now its not on paper but is already working! only mass adoption is needed

[08-Aug-19 11:50 AM] Flint#6435
just a partnership with someone like ubisoft and we again fly to the moon

[08-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Flint#6435
this will have a greater effect than listing on the exchange!
