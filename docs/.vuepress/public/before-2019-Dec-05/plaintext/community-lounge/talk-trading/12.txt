Only 5,000 more Coqui to dump and I'm back to where I started 3 hrs ago üòÉ

[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> come on!

[21-Jun-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> let it be!

[21-Jun-18 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, if Bitmain took direct payments in COQUI....

[21-Jun-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
would it help ease your mind if I promised to use 1 of the 5 minis I buy with my COQUI to mine COQUI? üòõ

[21-Jun-18 02:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
besides, it looks good for the stats:

24h KMD Volume
2261

[21-Jun-18 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
nearly 50% of that was 2 trades

[21-Jun-18 02:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362

best case scenario is for BTC to find a bottom at the monthly 20sma

[21-Jun-18 02:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
thats the last frontier

[21-Jun-18 02:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
other option could be that it already is near a bottom of  a weird correction

[21-Jun-18 02:19 PM] Hegelian#0018
I think was already bottomed. This is classic triple bottom set up. Now we are going to moon

[21-Jun-18 02:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
classic?

lol

[21-Jun-18 02:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
triple bottoms are not that "classic"

[21-Jun-18 02:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So do I classic keep buying the dip

[21-Jun-18 02:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
untill I'm on ramen for a couple of months?

[21-Jun-18 02:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
well... until you can yes

[21-Jun-18 02:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

not sure its worth the risk cryptoon

[21-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm only (partially) kidding

[21-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I bought a little more last week

[21-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But as I have real life obligations and stuff I can't risk too much üòÉ

[21-Jun-18 02:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_isn't buying any BTC over $4,200_

[21-Jun-18 03:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also, kmd slowly creeping towards 25k

[21-Jun-18 03:44 PM] Bittersweet#9376
That's the part that annoys me always

[21-Jun-18 03:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
what part of what?

[21-Jun-18 03:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the part of the bear market

[21-Jun-18 03:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Where kmd dumps to 22k before a 5x in a day

[21-Jun-18 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm all for the 5x, but feka buncha 22

[21-Jun-18 03:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
üòÑ

[21-Jun-18 03:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Think 22k was the bottom in december?

[21-Jun-18 03:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
oh no

[21-Jun-18 03:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
17k

[21-Jun-18 03:56 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I can't remember that far back
But I know that every time I look at my charts to make the 2nd 50% payment on my next batch of miners, I have more coins and less value üò≠

[21-Jun-18 03:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and I'm running out of liquid BTC to keep buying more KMD

[21-Jun-18 03:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
26 RSI

[21-Jun-18 03:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
On the daily

[21-Jun-18 03:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That's the lowest it's ever been

[21-Jun-18 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well it's still up like 3x over the last 14 months, so there's that üòÉ

[21-Jun-18 04:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's all scotch, hookers, and blow when we hit a pseudo $10 again üòõ

[21-Jun-18 04:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
tbh

[21-Jun-18 04:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
At this point, when we hit 10$ again

[21-Jun-18 04:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I probably wouldnt even believe it

[21-Jun-18 04:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and wonder who drugged my drink

[21-Jun-18 04:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[21-Jun-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763

I see people complaining about withdrawals in SAFE discord

[21-Jun-18 05:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
apparently withdrawels need to be processed manually, how the fuck is it a DEX?

[21-Jun-18 05:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's not, they just started "working on" a DEX

[21-Jun-18 05:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
they had to do the CEX 1st so they could maintain complete centralized control over everything

[21-Jun-18 05:03 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
are there real people using Safecoin?

[21-Jun-18 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ffs, I hope not

[21-Jun-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> Yes

[21-Jun-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> Definitely there are

[21-Jun-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> I'm one of them. I use it to pay my groceries

[21-Jun-18 05:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
just wait until they do launch their DEX and find out that the current supply is more than 10x what the total supply is supposed to be üòÉ

[21-Jun-18 05:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hahaha

[21-Jun-18 05:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I wonder how ü§î

[21-Jun-18 05:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
irony: they know how and refuse to believe it

[21-Jun-18 05:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah I saw the discussions on bct

they don't really sound like the smartest bunch

[21-Jun-18 05:16 PM] Tyrael#0138
shitcointalk is only doing their annual business; pump bitcoin to mars and after the crash try to kill as many altcoins as they can

[21-Jun-18 05:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Yeah I saw the discussions on bct"
It goes beyond that; I literally told them the issue, told them when I created a proof of concept, and made it as obvious as possible when running the PoC

[21-Jun-18 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I even offered to give them the code

[21-Jun-18 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
they said "there's no problems here" and banned me üòõ

[21-Jun-18 05:18 PM] Tyrael#0138
only ban ? looks like they liked what you said

[21-Jun-18 05:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, not "only"; someone did make me LOL and started talking about reporting me to their local Canadian police

[21-Jun-18 05:21 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
On the plus side, when they do open their DEX, I can trade a ton and by more of those ASICs that they don't like

[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> after this correction, $25 will be peanuts

[21-Jun-18 06:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Correction of what

[21-Jun-18 06:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd?

[21-Jun-18 06:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or btc? :trollface:

[21-Jun-18 06:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
a BTC correction to 4100 right after I pay off my Aug/Sept miner order would be nice üòÉ

[21-Jun-18 06:55 PM] Tyrael#0138

[21-Jun-18 06:56 PM] Tyrael#0138
yes, it is coming from BTC miners
