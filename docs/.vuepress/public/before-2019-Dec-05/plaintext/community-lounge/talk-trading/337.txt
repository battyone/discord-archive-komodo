I think a lot of the people still in now are here to stay, no?

[08-Dec-18 09:06 PM] meatspoon#7860
@Cryptoon  I think so.  Or at least their intention is to hold.  I hope this bear market is wrapping up.  Another year or more of this might turn some HODLers into sellers out of necessity.

[08-Dec-18 09:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
I worry a bit about buyer's fatigue as well.  I bought a lot of dips this year and I can say I am a bit tuckered out.  So if the HODLers hold and dont sell, maybe price won't go down.  But with buyers being pretty worn out, there might not be much buying pressure either.

[08-Dec-18 09:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I will continue to purchase BTC,  pirate and Komodo when I can.

[08-Dec-18 09:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[08-Dec-18 10:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
I will too, for sure.  But my buys will be more cautious and smaller.  And if the market continues to grind along at these levels, there will be a point when I throttle back even further.

[08-Dec-18 11:01 PM] Vertigo#0439
My goal is to buy all 100m kmd. Got yo catch them all.

[08-Dec-18 11:02 PM] Vertigo#0439
And when I do that I will name the minimum expression of a Komodo a Gecko.

[09-Dec-18 01:16 AM] Alright#0419
Try using it as day to day currency, you'll start to despise it and use BCH(or anything else) at every given opportunity

[09-Dec-18 01:36 AM] meatspoon#7860
Thats like saying handjobs are better than blowjobs for currency. They both are sub-optimal.

[09-Dec-18 01:48 AM] Alright#0419
What?

[09-Dec-18 01:52 AM] meatspoon#7860
not sure what your experience is, but where I am I cant use either BTC or BCH (nor KMD or any other crypto asset)  for anything... much like I cant use Beejers or Old Fashions for anything either.  Or at least not with certainty it will work.  So I don't think it is a profound criticism of BTC to say its not a day to day currency.   People have been saying that for years.

[09-Dec-18 01:54 AM] Alright#0419
I rarely use fiat for anything

[09-Dec-18 02:47 AM] meatspoon#7860
I am not of that opinion.  And i think its fabulous that you can use cryptos for almost everything.  My point was:  for most people, BTC or BCH wont pay any of their bills.  So to say BCH is wildly better as a payment method isn't saying much.

But to correct you a bit, if you are in a western nation, you use fiat to pay sales tax anytime you use cash, you pay property and real estate taxes in fiat, you fuel your car with fiat, you buy clothes for your family in fiat, you pay traffic tickets in fiat...  I mean, it goes on and on.  I realize that there is a pressure to be like, super-cool crypto-dude who doesn't live in the fiat roach motel of modern day finance, but to say you "rarely use fiat for anything" makes me wonder if my world view is so incredibly backwards or if you are just spouting "hardcore crypto" things.  What bills do you pay in crypto?

[09-Dec-18 02:55 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm fairly sure there are bank cards out there that are attached to your coins wallets, so I'm sure you could use them just like fiat or fiat bank cards

[09-Dec-18 03:07 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
With the debit cards?

[09-Dec-18 03:07 AM] Alright#0419
@meatspoon `my world view is so incredibly backwards ` yes

[09-Dec-18 03:08 AM] Alright#0419
if you make the effort, it's entirely doable

[09-Dec-18 03:08 AM] Alright#0419
in my case, it's less effort as all of my income is in crypto

[09-Dec-18 03:12 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
