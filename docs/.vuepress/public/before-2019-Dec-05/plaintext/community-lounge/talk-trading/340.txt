@Hollowman9000 shit that sucks man üò¶

[12-Dec-18 08:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I just thought he went broke and that‚Äôs why he disappeared

[12-Dec-18 08:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Seemed to be selling/borrowing a lot of stuff to be able to buy more and then the market took an extra 50% dive...

I've been invited, among some 2,000 folks around the World, including Trump, Putin, celebrities and the janitor at the Ritz Carlton San Juan, to grace the premises of the World Economic Forum in January - allegedly the World's most exclusive gathering. Someone made a big m...

[12-Dec-18 12:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[12-Dec-18 03:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i hope

[12-Dec-18 06:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@house confirmed

[12-Dec-18 06:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
He can make it right by sending me what he‚Äôs stolen so far

[12-Dec-18 06:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or he can refund me the KMD I paid him

[12-Dec-18 06:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It‚Äôs unlikely he‚Äôll mention his previous account on here

[12-Dec-18 06:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But that‚Äôs what cockroaches do

[12-Dec-18 06:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
though sooner or later they get stepped on

[12-Dec-18 06:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Especially with his line of work

[12-Dec-18 06:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
how much did he steal?  And how much KMD did you pay him?

[12-Dec-18 06:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
and what is his line of work?

[12-Dec-18 06:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
A few thousand vrsc so far

[12-Dec-18 06:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I hear he‚Äôs a ‚Äúpharmaceutical entrepreneur‚Äù of sorts

[12-Dec-18 06:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
ahh

[12-Dec-18 06:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
very enterprising of him

[12-Dec-18 06:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
that sucks man.  Sorry that happened

[12-Dec-18 06:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Risk I took

[12-Dec-18 06:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
There‚Äôs still plenty of reward left to recover

[12-Dec-18 06:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôll get them

[12-Dec-18 06:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Homeboy will probably have a meeting with the AFP sooner or later anyway

[12-Dec-18 06:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not of my doing, but of his own

[12-Dec-18 06:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or cross the wrong associate

[12-Dec-18 06:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And end up in the outback somewhere

[12-Dec-18 06:13 PM] Vertigo#0439
Dingo food!!

[12-Dec-18 06:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or great white shark food, whichever venue is closer to him

[12-Dec-18 06:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
3200 KMD for 92325 vrsc

[12-Dec-18 06:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
He‚Äôs understandably bitter

[12-Dec-18 06:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I would‚Äôve even worked something out with him

[12-Dec-18 06:16 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But he punked out like a bitch

[12-Dec-18 06:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
sorry to hear hollow üò¶

@Hollowman9000 @house scammed you?

[12-Dec-18 08:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i remember seeing that username

[12-Dec-18 08:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
would be nice if you guys can use chainmakers as escrow service in the future.

[12-Dec-18 08:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We can do it using multisig addresses

[12-Dec-18 08:10 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@siu - Chainmakers @Hollowman9000  said:
`yeah lil Komodo went against his
Word
A man without his word is a cockroach`
and wanted to verify the events to @house 
he wasn't saying @house was the offender

[12-Dec-18 08:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
oohh okok

[12-Dec-18 08:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
sorry @house

[12-Dec-18 08:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but @Hollowman9000 got scammed in a OTC trade?

[12-Dec-18 08:12 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it was about locked verus wallet.dat that he bought from lil komodo back then

[12-Dec-18 08:12 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
lil komodo didn't delete the wallet.dat and still accessing the wallet sending the coin to exchange

[12-Dec-18 08:12 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_wishes he could get scammed and come out 13k+ ahead on the deal...._

[12-Dec-18 08:13 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I almost bought it from him in the past üòÑ

[12-Dec-18 08:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ahh, damn

[12-Dec-18 08:13 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the price was definitely enticing. 3200kmd for 92k VRSC

[12-Dec-18 08:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, but it seems like buying wallet.dat files is definitively not the way to go forward with this

[12-Dec-18 08:29 PM] Lumbi#8378
too good to be true

[12-Dec-18 08:29 PM] Lumbi#8378
92k? getouttahere...

[12-Dec-18 08:38 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`yeah, but it seems like buying wallet.dat files is definitively not the way to go forward with this`
literally, my 1st thought
```ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢11/12/2018
why would anyone that's spent more than 10 minutes around here be sucker enough to buy a wallet.dat```

[12-Dec-18 08:48 PM] Lumbi#8378
I've got a wallet.dat i have yet to hack into.. but 192VRSC  is more realistic...

[12-Dec-18 08:49 PM] Lumbi#8378
I can't imagine a time frame that would of allowed 92k...?

[12-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Early days mining

[12-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I would buy a wallet.dat from hollow I think

[12-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But I‚Äôm a simple man with not many komodo

[12-Dec-18 10:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Got 13k out of it so far

[12-Dec-18 10:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Soon enough I‚Äôll get the rest

[12-Dec-18 10:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The dumbass didn‚Äôt even know it was a 95k verus wallet

[12-Dec-18 10:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I found extra mining rewards upon a rescan

[12-Dec-18 10:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Had a few thousand stolen, it happens, I priced the deal on receiving half of the verus due to possibility of a malicious counterparty

[12-Dec-18 10:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Counterparty turned malicious

[12-Dec-18 10:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Oh well

[12-Dec-18 10:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
how much verus you got at the end?

[12-Dec-18 10:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The end is roughly 2 years from now

[12-Dec-18 10:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôll get about 95% of all of it

[12-Dec-18 10:12 PM] jorian#4555
that's not too bad

[12-Dec-18 10:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not at all

[12-Dec-18 10:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôll get the verus

[12-Dec-18 10:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
AFP will kick in lil komodos door

[12-Dec-18 10:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôm good with it

[12-Dec-18 10:13 PM] jorian#4555
AFP?

[12-Dec-18 10:13 PM] jorian#4555
anti fraud police?

[12-Dec-18 10:14 PM] jorian#4555
all fried potatoes?

[12-Dec-18 10:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Australian Federal Police, lil deals drugs

[12-Dec-18 10:14 PM] jorian#4555
you know him well

[12-Dec-18 10:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
People have told me things once they heard

[12-Dec-18 10:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
About our deal shenanigans

[12-Dec-18 10:16 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôll get what‚Äôs mine and he‚Äôll get what‚Äôs coming to him

[12-Dec-18 10:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Considering the price action of late I‚Äôve only lost like $0.20 in fiat value from what he‚Äôs stolen anyway :abusedsmily:

[12-Dec-18 10:19 PM] jorian#4555
let's hope that in the end the 2 years wait was worth it

[12-Dec-18 10:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Mike T. is one of the most competent devs around
