I love the website, and actually dig the logo...but we‚Äôve been waiting two years through a few different marketing companies for this to get an unoriginal logo and the best defense that comes up is ‚Äúbut guys this happens all the time it‚Äôs impossible to be original in today‚Äôs world‚Äù

Maybe if they make the logo a gif and the sperm is swimming that would make it obviously different

[16-Jul-19 03:56 AM] Caglio#3337
Or if centricity rebrand themself and lose the logo

[16-Jul-19 03:57 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
