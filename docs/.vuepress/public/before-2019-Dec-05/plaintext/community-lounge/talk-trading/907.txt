Yup, it really blew my mind that they would have only  USD/KMD but glad I was wrong

[10-Jul-19 02:31 AM] JimD#9272
probably gonna migrate back to Coinbase here soon enough though

[10-Jul-19 02:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
coinbase needs a dl and a selfie as well.  they need a selfie everytime everytime i move MY crypto i transferred in out of their site now. shit's freaking me out.

[10-Jul-19 03:00 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm sure the irs/sec is so far up everyone's rear end that I'm in multiple databases now. 'murica.

[10-Jul-19 03:05 AM] tolken#2655
Bittrex Kmd/usd is cool, felt good to make my last Kmd purchase that way and bypass btc.

[10-Jul-19 03:39 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Didn’t know that about coinbase

[10-Jul-19 07:00 AM] Markus#5464
multiply ur bitcoin on bitmex and buy up the cheap kmd

[10-Jul-19 07:12 AM] Alexfrog#1338
lol nice chart 😄

[10-Jul-19 07:16 AM] Alexfrog#1338
thats definitely what KMD feels like right now 😦

[10-Jul-19 07:16 AM] Alexfrog#1338
and most of my other coins are worse

[10-Jul-19 07:31 AM] Keppie#5156
Exactly, they are doing worse. Praise KMD

[10-Jul-19 07:43 AM] Flexatron#8809
Just a while and btc will cool down and alts will recover

[10-Jul-19 07:43 AM] Flexatron#8809

[10-Jul-19 07:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
someone posted on twitter that alts are dead, I think I'm gonna sell my bags guys

[10-Jul-19 07:58 AM] Markus#5464
selling at this point is worst thing u can do

[10-Jul-19 07:59 AM] Markus#5464
even if i feel like u were not serious 👌

[10-Jul-19 08:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
i was not serious, i am kind of used to how this tends to go. as long as btc keeps moving up it's all good.

I believe everyone should consider the possibility that Bitcoin's dominance returns to the ~77% level (when you remove stablecoins from the marketcap)

[10-Jul-19 10:29 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Is there a bottom haha damn

[10-Jul-19 10:38 AM] Markus#5464
well dominance now is 67.8%

[10-Jul-19 10:38 AM] Markus#5464
if u check tradingview

[10-Jul-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
removing the stable coins is a good idea to get a more meaningful dominance

[10-Jul-19 10:52 AM] Andersen#8337
Yes in the end of 2017  BTC dom.   ~67%  but  now we have much more   stablecoins

[10-Jul-19 11:24 AM] Sherdogz#6731

Btc ATH will be the signal for alts bottom

[10-Jul-19 11:45 AM] Mark81#4505
Will it?

[10-Jul-19 11:48 AM] Mark81#4505
Monthly close over $13.8k will be powerful candle.

breakpoint of that ascending wedge is right at the 0.618 fib (from 20k)

[10-Jul-19 12:38 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
if that plays out bearish, we got a double top on the current small parabola

[10-Jul-19 12:38 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
-> 50 cent kmd inc

[10-Jul-19 12:38 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
usually drop out of parobala breaks down 80% that would bring us to  5k, though I think 6k will be bottom again

[10-Jul-19 12:44 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
if the wedge is invalidaded, no stop till 20k i guess. Either way, kmd is fucked for now :E

[10-Jul-19 01:35 PM] Mark81#4505
I like what ya saying. Hopefully ltc will have it's last run to halvening so I will cash out to kmd from there.

[10-Jul-19 01:43 PM] Markus#5464
ltc can be close to a nice entry for a long position

[10-Jul-19 01:43 PM] Markus#5464

if everyone that comes in here and claims 'kmd still dead' when it's up on a 90day scale actually traded, this might be a more enjoyable channel

I've actually been using SIA storage for actual use cases.  Latest release allows seed based recovery of files - very cool.

Pixeldrain.com built on top of SIA, is a decent free file sharing service

[10-Jul-19 06:40 PM] allbits#5898
That article is also KMD ecosystem news since HODL still owns over two hundred siafund, I believe. They just got more valuable with that news.
