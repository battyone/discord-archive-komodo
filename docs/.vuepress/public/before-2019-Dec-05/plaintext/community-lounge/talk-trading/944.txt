granted, Jesus was one of the greatests magicians alive.

[18-Jul-19 08:44 PM] Tek#5253
He probably approves

[18-Jul-19 08:47 PM] Markus#5464
u believe in Jesus?

[18-Jul-19 08:48 PM] Tek#5253
I believe in God and I think Jesus was a great magician.

[18-Jul-19 08:49 PM] Markus#5464
ok

[18-Jul-19 08:49 PM] Tek#5253
he performed miracles and told the future so.

[18-Jul-19 08:49 PM] Tek#5253
I like the teachings of Jesus, however it's clear they are for the plebs mostly

[18-Jul-19 08:49 PM] Tek#5253
much control structure in the bible

[18-Jul-19 08:49 PM] Tek#5253
but still one of my favorite books

[18-Jul-19 08:50 PM] Markus#5464
I mean u can believe what u want but i think religion discussion is not necessary it can get ugly real quick

[18-Jul-19 08:50 PM] Tek#5253
ideas want to spread. ideas don't care.

[18-Jul-19 08:50 PM] Markus#5464
ppl are so sensitive when it comes to religion i seen

[18-Jul-19 08:50 PM] Tek#5253
ideas share

[18-Jul-19 08:50 PM] Tek#5253
information is virus like

[18-Jul-19 08:51 PM] Markus#5464
in my mind religion is and have just been a tool to control ppl nothing else

[18-Jul-19 08:51 PM] Tek#5253
it's more than that

[18-Jul-19 08:51 PM] Tek#5253
but control is deffinitly there

[18-Jul-19 08:51 PM] Markus#5464
Just check countries like Egypt

[18-Jul-19 08:51 PM] Markus#5464
their completely fucked

[18-Jul-19 08:51 PM] Markus#5464
u cant have ur own choice

[18-Jul-19 08:52 PM] Tek#5253
that's just islam. there's nice religions too

[18-Jul-19 08:52 PM] Tek#5253
Sihkism is pretty cool

[18-Jul-19 08:52 PM] Tek#5253
without religion this would be one very dark murder ball for sure.

[18-Jul-19 08:53 PM] Tek#5253
even worse than without.

[18-Jul-19 08:53 PM] Tek#5253
now only the top elite people do nasty shit, but without the rules and control religion brought, everyone would be eating babies

[18-Jul-19 08:53 PM] Markus#5464
dont know religion never interested me so i dont believe in any of it and i live completely fine the way it is

[18-Jul-19 08:53 PM] Markus#5464
freedom

[18-Jul-19 08:54 PM] Tek#5253
not everyone values spiritual wealth. it's okay. sad, but okay

[18-Jul-19 08:55 PM] Tek#5253
let me end the discussion by saying that, The bible states you don't need to follow any religion at all to live by the law of God. The law of nature is the law of  God.

[18-Jul-19 08:55 PM] Tek#5253
so it doesn't really matter either way.

[18-Jul-19 08:55 PM] Markus#5464

[18-Jul-19 09:14 PM] bopicasso#8995
We need a nice pump

[18-Jul-19 09:16 PM] Tek#5253
I don't pray for materialistic gains.

[18-Jul-19 09:16 PM] Tek#5253
Sorry

[18-Jul-19 09:17 PM] cascrypto#8206
Pray for our technical recognition then plz

[18-Jul-19 09:18 PM] Tek#5253
no

[18-Jul-19 09:18 PM] actionslacks#4072

[18-Jul-19 09:18 PM] cascrypto#8206
Damm you

[18-Jul-19 09:18 PM] Tek#5253
I don't think you understand the endgame of blockchain

[18-Jul-19 09:18 PM] Tek#5253
its going to enslave the world

[18-Jul-19 09:18 PM] Tek#5253
not bring freedom

[18-Jul-19 09:18 PM] Tek#5253
but atleast we early birds will be at the top

[18-Jul-19 09:18 PM] cascrypto#8206
Arrr

[18-Jul-19 09:19 PM] actionslacks#4072
centralized control of the money printing press is what i hope the blockchain can free us from

[18-Jul-19 09:19 PM] Tek#5253
Yeah maybe it does bring good for a while

[18-Jul-19 09:19 PM] Tek#5253
but the chance that it will get subverted for evil is there

[18-Jul-19 09:20 PM] Tek#5253
we need crypto jesus then

[18-Jul-19 09:20 PM] Tek#5253
only with Jesus on the throne will blockchain be used for good.

[18-Jul-19 09:21 PM] Tek#5253
no worries Jesus will return soon < 3

[18-Jul-19 09:21 PM] Tek#5253

[18-Jul-19 09:58 PM] Markus#5464
I think Tek is secretly a bigger fan of Dash then KMD

[18-Jul-19 10:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
Its cause their logo is better.

[18-Jul-19 10:18 PM] Tek#5253
I can't sleep

[18-Jul-19 10:19 PM] Tek#5253
And yes dash logo is better

[18-Jul-19 10:19 PM] Tek#5253

[18-Jul-19 10:19 PM] Tek#5253
I'm really disappointed by the new kmd logo

[18-Jul-19 10:19 PM] Markus#5464
U know that Dash started as a scam right?

[18-Jul-19 10:19 PM] Tek#5253
The old one was much cooler

[18-Jul-19 10:19 PM] Neko#5830
the new logo grew on me

[18-Jul-19 10:20 PM] Tek#5253
New kmd logo is a 5 minute Photoshop with blend

Power button

[18-Jul-19 10:20 PM] Markus#5464
why does it have to be complex, simplicity is the key

[18-Jul-19 10:20 PM] Tek#5253
The bevel makes it seem 3d like

[18-Jul-19 10:21 PM] Tek#5253
But it's a pretty shit job

[18-Jul-19 10:21 PM] Tek#5253
I would have kept it 2d

[18-Jul-19 10:21 PM] Tek#5253
Old kmd logo was much stronger and fitting

[18-Jul-19 10:22 PM] Tek#5253
This new logo is cheap af

[18-Jul-19 10:22 PM] Tek#5253
Disappointed af

[18-Jul-19 10:22 PM] Markus#5464
old logo was too clunky and sharp edged

[18-Jul-19 10:22 PM] Tek#5253
At least it was unique

[18-Jul-19 10:22 PM] Tek#5253
This power button logo isnt
