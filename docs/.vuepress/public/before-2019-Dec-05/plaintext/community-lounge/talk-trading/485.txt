[22-Mar-19 11:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
A 2 at 10 is a 10 at 2

[22-Mar-19 11:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

I have no idea what a Kansas City shuffle is

[22-Mar-19 11:33 PM] jspook16#3059
Kansas City Shuffle = IEO from the sounds of it

[22-Mar-19 11:34 PM] jspook16#3059
So what is a 2 at 10?

[23-Mar-19 12:28 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Think beers and bars.

[23-Mar-19 12:28 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It will come to you faster than a 2 looking like a 10 at 2 AM

the lack of volatility in the market as a whole these days blows my mind

[23-Mar-19 06:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362

just remember 2014/15/16 everybody- and hope it won't last until '21.. I don't think so, I think the dough has been fermenting diligently already and is ready to blow

[23-Mar-19 06:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We sre getting near spring break time

[23-Mar-19 06:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So we might be low in volatility until later in april

[23-Mar-19 08:34 PM] jspook16#3059
Spring done broke, all the 10s are gone, 2s are left, but Komodo tech keeps trucking on.

[24-Mar-19 12:09 AM] 74D30#6106

Anyone willing to sell me some DEX OTC? Your 2 DEX for my 50 KMD.  Willing to sent first if buyer is respectable in here.

[24-Mar-19 12:53 PM] jorian#4555
@CoinKing88 you should buy from coinexchange, the 2 DEX there are cheaper than the 50KMD you're offering

[24-Mar-19 12:54 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Coinexchange -> KMD -> BTC -> is about that expensive

[24-Mar-19 12:54 PM] CoinKing88#1540
low volume with kmd/btc, dont have btc

[24-Mar-19 12:55 PM] CoinKing88#1540

Should I put 100-200$ more into KMD ?

[24-Mar-19 02:47 PM] Caglio#3337
Or should I buy some booze instead

[24-Mar-19 02:47 PM] Caglio#3337
Hm

[24-Mar-19 02:55 PM] actionslacks#4072
Find a tent spot with a better view, then buy more kmd

`As long as there isn‚Äôt too much fentanyl in your heroin`

Apparently

[24-Mar-19 04:04 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôll have to consult my experts in Baltimore and Seattle to confirm though

@Hollowman9000 its not cool to make fun out of my heroin addiction, even tho I never do it intravenously

[25-Mar-19 12:43 AM] Caglio#3337

[25-Mar-19 12:44 AM] Caglio#3337
Even tho I must say, my bank is one of the most retarded banks I have ever seen, I guess cos its in shitty country, if it was Austria wouldnt be like that

I had dilaudid on demand after they hacked my chest apart

[25-Mar-19 01:49 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
It was wonderful

[25-Mar-19 01:50 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
But it ended

[25-Mar-19 01:50 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Dilaudid = hydromorphone = much more potent than heroin

[25-Mar-19 01:50 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not quite fentanyl

Spent a couple months on a morphine drip after getting hit by a car and breaking both legs. Had a softspot for hydros  ever since. Don't be a pussy indeed. DMT done in the right environment may help break the cycle.

[25-Mar-19 07:11 AM] meatspoon#7860
There is a cool book called DMT: The Spirit Molecule about DMT tolerance studies... my understanding is the DMT trip is as intense as it gets, seeming to last a very long time but in reality only lasting a few minutes.

[25-Mar-19 07:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
I tried it the first time with a shaman in a fairly controlled and optimized environment. It was a lot like an exorcism of negative thoughts and feelings. It helped me to let go of a lot of negative emotions and focus on what is important to my life.  The second time I felt I had died and was reborn on the blockchain. Like I had been reincarnated  in some kind of singularity event. That progressed into believing I was the antichrist and feeling more empowered than I had ever felt. I decided I'd had enough dmt for good after that one.

[25-Mar-19 07:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
The shaman just administered the dose and guided you through the trip

[25-Mar-19 08:00 AM] actionslacks#4072
I didn't check credentials
