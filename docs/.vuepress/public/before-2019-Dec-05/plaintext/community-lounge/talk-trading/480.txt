Yeah, but still, saying 5M is normal to basically just start a crypto consultancy firm is crazy tbh

[19-Mar-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry, confused the Crypto... handle

[19-Mar-19 03:21 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
its kool Jl lol i thought we jus discussing anyways 🤣

[19-Mar-19 03:21 PM] crumb#2550
@siu - Chainmakers the only problem is that chainmakers is already actually DOING something, must have 🌈 and 🦄  to raise big amounts

[19-Mar-19 03:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah, we not that good on make believes...

[19-Mar-19 03:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
dont even promote ourselves.

[19-Mar-19 03:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But we need development and that is expensive 😦

[19-Mar-19 03:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
especially CC development is hard and scarce

[19-Mar-19 03:26 PM] crumb#2550
all joking aside, you should look into some kind of fundraising then

[19-Mar-19 03:26 PM] crumb#2550
you just need to figure out best way to structure it

[19-Mar-19 03:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I personally prefer for it to be private funding, i would not go the ICO route.

[19-Mar-19 03:27 PM] crumb#2550
ico crowd seems to be waaayy to short-sighted

[19-Mar-19 03:27 PM] crumb#2550
private is probably the way to go for you guys, i agree

[19-Mar-19 03:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
lets see how it goes. But anyway, we hope RFOX gets all their funding goals, that would only mean good things for the whole ecosystem.

[19-Mar-19 03:35 PM] Keppie#5156
On a completely different note. How do you guys feel about OUR / Crypto Union

[19-Mar-19 03:35 PM] Keppie#5156
FA value compared to today's price

[19-Mar-19 03:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What is today's price?

[19-Mar-19 03:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
vs initial price?

[19-Mar-19 03:42 PM] crumb#2550
regarding OUR if the max supply is 150M and the price is 0.004 KMD per OUR then we have a market cap of $600 000 USD as (if we roughly assume current kmd-usd parity)

[19-Mar-19 03:43 PM] crumb#2550
i have asked for supply info from CryptoUnion Discord, but so far i only got 150M max supply numbers

[19-Mar-19 03:44 PM] Keppie#5156
price is more like 0.01kmd/our on DP

[19-Mar-19 03:44 PM] crumb#2550
spread is wide and liquidity is low

[19-Mar-19 03:44 PM] crumb#2550
so i took a conservative approach

[19-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Keppie#5156
Tell me about it, can't get an order filled for over 3 days now 😄

[19-Mar-19 03:45 PM] crumb#2550
😃

[19-Mar-19 03:48 PM] crumb#2550
@Crabby Paddy is doing a good job creating engagement around CryptoUnion, but i still have a lot of questions and i'd also like to see official team members confirming things.

[19-Mar-19 03:49 PM] Keppie#5156
That's what's holding me back of investing more. But from a trading point of view the risk/reward is quite nice

[19-Mar-19 03:49 PM] Keppie#5156
Listing on Zaddex will help.

[19-Mar-19 03:49 PM] PTYX#6840
@siu - Chainmakers tell me about itchy hands lol

[19-Mar-19 03:49 PM] Keppie#5156
Curious how that partnership with Ivorycoast gov. will play out

[19-Mar-19 03:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you know, the saying goes that if you get itchy hands its because some money might be going your way 😂

👌 😂 

[19-Mar-19 03:50 PM] Keppie#5156
Doesnt hurt to shift some kmd profits into these small rockets

[19-Mar-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe a good diversification with the 5%

[19-Mar-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
if any of them work out great, then great. if not, then still you have all your initial KMD

[19-Mar-19 03:51 PM] crumb#2550
dealing with any bureaucracy is tricky, governments especially. it could take a lot of time to get things working 
@Keppie

[19-Mar-19 03:51 PM] PTYX#6840
@Keppie who is partnering with ivory coast?

If a portion of the volume in coinbene is real, Rfox will raise the amount they want to raise.

[19-Mar-19 04:15 PM] PTYX#6840
In regards to the valuation of 5 Million, that will be up to the market. Projects with nothing other than a whitepaper and a dream usually raise more funds than their counterparts. Case in point with the Komodo ICO which didn't raise anything compared to other ICOs during that month. Anything can happen.

@JBTheCryptoKing @CoinMarketCap Correct. Our SafeNodes are going to write $SAFE transactions on multiple different blockchains at the same time. We will start with at least 3 top 50 coins blockchains in the first phase of launch. Multi-chain notorization  is just the begin...

@SafeCoins @JBTheCryptoKing @CoinMarketCap `We will start with at least 3 top 50 coins blockchains in the first phase of launch.`
Maybe start with knowing the difference between a UTXO split and a notarization....

`Are they removing BTC notarization?`
No, Jeff has worked it so BTC notarization will 'be for 0 cost' 🤣

[19-Mar-19 04:28 PM] PTYX#6840
that's what i inferred from the post but I didn't understand how it could be at no overhead cost

[19-Mar-19 04:28 PM] PTYX#6840
i'll just ask them directly

[19-Mar-19 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but I didn't understand how it could be at no overhead cost`
It's simple:
you send transactions with 0 fee, since they are transactions and not actual notarizations, it doesn't matter that they sit in the mempool :troll:

[19-Mar-19 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Alright tried several times to explain to them that it wasn't possible to do what they think they are doing, but all he got was banned

[19-Mar-19 04:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I hope they do. Like james said its like real state. A valuation of $5m for them will raise value of the whole ecosystem

[19-Mar-19 04:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
OOT already raise $4m

[19-Mar-19 04:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
😜

[19-Mar-19 04:32 PM] PTYX#6840
Didn't oot raise 1 million

[19-Mar-19 04:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@siu - Chainmakers yes and no
the problem is that that mess having value hurts more than it helps when the long-term sees it for the fail that it is (will be seen as the next scam in the list, imo)

[19-Mar-19 04:34 PM] PTYX#6840
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 if they deliver the promises, it won't be a fail or a scam

[19-Mar-19 04:34 PM] PTYX#6840
right?

[19-Mar-19 04:35 PM] PTYX#6840
gotcha

[19-Mar-19 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@PTYX imo, the only way that happens is if someone like @radix42 joins their "team"; short of that, these are still the same 3 guys that think you "steal" blocks from GPU miners if you use an ASIC and they understand less of the protocol than the average n00b

[19-Mar-19 04:36 PM] PTYX#6840
Are we talking about the same thing?

[19-Mar-19 04:36 PM] PTYX#6840
i was referring to redfox

[19-Mar-19 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the only thing that's saved them this far is that the hack of their exchange gave them teh 19th rollback of their chain

[19-Mar-19 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_was talking about unsafecoin_

[19-Mar-19 04:37 PM] PTYX#6840
yea i was referring the the ico. safecoin.......well i can't comment on them too much

[19-Mar-19 04:38 PM] PTYX#6840
I heard that their exchange got hacked.

[19-Mar-19 04:38 PM] PTYX#6840
i don't know how long ago that was though

[19-Mar-19 04:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you skipped @FishyGuts's twitter post, which is what started me and I thought you were talking about 😛

[19-Mar-19 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
to that end, yes I think RFOX has potential

[19-Mar-19 04:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But OOT got a private investment, or i got that wrong?

[19-Mar-19 04:40 PM] radix42#3743
lol, I have no time to join anyone else's "team", kmd and Pirate with a side of Monero and random ports is more than i can handle

[19-Mar-19 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@radix42 even if you had the time, I'm not sure you could deal with 3 people that barely have 1 brain between them :troll:

[19-Mar-19 04:41 PM] radix42#3743
I think I have gotten two or 3 "hey come be a core team member" requests this last week

[19-Mar-19 04:42 PM] radix42#3743
and I just had the remaining teeth I had rotting out of my head pulled a week ago as i'm getting dentures so my pain level is VERY HIGH even with the good pills

[19-Mar-19 04:42 PM] PTYX#6840
@siu - Chainmakers partly yes

[19-Mar-19 04:42 PM] radix42#3743

I'll see if I can get my molds and send them to you for replacements later lol

only if you cover the $30k fine if I get caught 😛

it helps that the "technology" of dentures really hasn't changed much in 30+ years
