This is the end!

depends on where you are at i think. Some countries tax "any" trade, even crypto to crypto

[27-Dec-18 09:34 PM] jspook16#3059
im not sure if they tax by actual traded funds or utxo used to trade funds

[27-Dec-18 09:45 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`How can they tell if someone isn't moving funds from one wallet to other?`
you mean besides some explorer tagging the account it went to as `Binance` or `Bittrex`?

[27-Dec-18 09:59 PM] Alright#0419
@jspook16 they aren't sure either üòÇ

That's why you dont cash out to fiat

[27-Dec-18 10:11 PM] BlackJesus#6161
use it to cover travel expenses and hotels through sites that allow crypto checkout and use petty cash for incidentals

[27-Dec-18 10:11 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Do this method until the tax laws arent fucking stupid anymore.

[27-Dec-18 10:17 PM] tolken#2655
@jspook16 true, but I was referring specifically to irs.

[27-Dec-18 10:17 PM] Alright#0419
@BlackJesus if you're a US citizen,  any purchase made with crypto is considered a trade

[27-Dec-18 10:20 PM] Alright#0419
Even if you don't touch USD at all,  it's considered selling the crypto for USD

[27-Dec-18 10:20 PM] tolken#2655
@Deleted User how can they tell? They can tell when and if they audit. The burden of proof is set upon your shoulders. If you can‚Äôt provide evidence that you own a wallet that you sent from, they will assume cost basis of 0. Yeah, it‚Äôs all bullshit but that‚Äôs how they operate.

[27-Dec-18 10:22 PM] tolken#2655
How else will they afford to *help**cough* and feed children?

[27-Dec-18 10:35 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@Alright the IRS is shrinking everyday due to budget cuts. They barely have the means to pursue people who owe millions they surely won't come after me for 10's of thousands.

[27-Dec-18 10:35 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Plus the burden of proof lies on them to connect wallets to your person. Not the other way around.

protip: gtfo of US

[27-Dec-18 10:36 PM] ver_User#6608
if you trade for a living and need fiat, in the UK you are supposed to keep a record of every single trade you make, not sure about other countries.... this is in principle, until they figure things out. But anyone who day trades, doesn't matter the asset, record every trade. What I want to know is will that record keeping hurt you in the long run? and how the fuck are you supposed to calculate value of tax to be paid when you trade crypto to crypto?

Have no idea... apart from some serious hours of work

[27-Dec-18 10:37 PM] Alright#0419
They will look around in a few years and wonder why they have no innovative crypto people left

[27-Dec-18 10:37 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`They barely have the means to pursue people who owe millions they surely won't come after me for 10's of thousands.`
Said every peon audited, ever

[27-Dec-18 10:37 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I was discussing that with someone else the other day, the IRS is having its budget severely reduced and the population of the US is growing not declining imagine fielding 10k request with a team of 500 people and then the following year fielding 12k request with a team of 250

[27-Dec-18 10:37 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I pay my main taxes

[27-Dec-18 10:37 PM] BlackJesus#6161

computer surveillance...

[27-Dec-18 10:38 PM] ver_User#6608
Huawei will get you and sell it to the IRS

[27-Dec-18 10:38 PM] BlackJesus#6161
capital gains is much harder to prove especially on an asset that is hard to connect to peoples financial identities

[27-Dec-18 10:38 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I use vpn's

[27-Dec-18 10:38 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I got audited for 2010, because I put 10 in a column for postage instead of 100; so, there's that

[27-Dec-18 10:38 PM] BlackJesus#6161
so I'm not worried about that part of surveilence.

[27-Dec-18 10:39 PM] BlackJesus#6161
You should be most worried about your isp selling you out a paid vpn is beholden to you to keep your info private.

[27-Dec-18 10:40 PM] BlackJesus#6161
whenever you don't pay a fee to use a service assume you are the product being sold.

[27-Dec-18 10:40 PM] Alright#0419
VPNs often give a false sense of security, just saying

[27-Dec-18 10:40 PM] Alright#0419
you need much much more than just a VPN to be "private"

[27-Dec-18 10:40 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
my ISP can't even spell ISP üôÑ

[27-Dec-18 10:40 PM] BlackJesus#6161
my isp (at&t) blocks piratebay by default

[27-Dec-18 10:41 PM] BlackJesus#6161
found that out when i got my vpn. I was wondering why the site always cloudflared

[27-Dec-18 10:41 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
cloudflare in an NSA front

[27-Dec-18 10:41 PM] BlackJesus#6161
wouldn't doubt it

[27-Dec-18 10:41 PM] Alright#0419
the internet*

[27-Dec-18 10:42 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I know how to use tails. But I honestly don't do much darkweb stuff to even bother.

`But I honestly don't do much darkweb stuff to even bother.`
That depends, watched a TV show the other night they were calling 2nd-tier domains "the darknet" ü§¶üèΩ

[27-Dec-18 10:45 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I honestly feel like the worst thing about them blocking certain sites by default is they are locking away information. New users of computers/internet may never learn or know what torrenting is.

[27-Dec-18 10:46 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
if it's not dotcom, it's the darkweb

[27-Dec-18 10:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Most of us come from a time before any of this default filtering bs they do now to certain sites. I was honestly appalled to finding that out.

[27-Dec-18 10:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea, I know that but still.

[27-Dec-18 10:46 PM] ver_User#6608
what needs to happen is a new web

[27-Dec-18 10:47 PM] ver_User#6608
actually decentralised

[27-Dec-18 10:47 PM] ver_User#6608
free from US control, primarily

[27-Dec-18 10:47 PM] ver_User#6608
MPAA etc

[27-Dec-18 10:48 PM] ver_User#6608
I have no idea how feasible that is but I would support it, we should in theory have enough devices by now to make a new network no?

[27-Dec-18 10:48 PM] BlackJesus#6161
They are literally witholding parts of the internet from the general public, because some people have a "claim" through a rigged and broken patent system.

[27-Dec-18 10:48 PM] ver_User#6608
I guess hard part is not having undersea cables?

[27-Dec-18 10:49 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea

[27-Dec-18 10:49 PM] BlackJesus#6161
eventually satellites will free us from all this infrastructure or atleast that's the dream.

[27-Dec-18 10:50 PM] Alright#0419
more infra will free us from all this infra

[27-Dec-18 10:50 PM] Alright#0419
yep....

[27-Dec-18 10:50 PM] ver_User#6608
"intellectual property" is a joke - what idea ever occurred in isolation? we have millions of years of knowledge literally handed to us as we grow up from gurgling babyhood... we never had to pay for that

[27-Dec-18 10:50 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Almost all idea's borrow from previous ideas

[27-Dec-18 10:51 PM] ver_User#6608
about price - love the KMDETH setup here. KMDBTC is also looks good doing it's own thing, volume and support today seem to be the real deal so far, will be nice to see a consolidation and follow through. I'm cautious however, and wouldn't be surprised if BTC drags this out that we might see 1700 again. Looks improbable at this time though

I'm searching for signs of reversal in btcusd to rise again for another up swing anywhere from here, may take a day or 2 to find a base, if it's gonna play out.

[27-Dec-18 10:51 PM] BlackJesus#6161
i called btc 3k back in march

[27-Dec-18 10:51 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm tyhinking 1500 is the bottom

[27-Dec-18 10:51 PM] BlackJesus#6161
3k came much sooner than i expected honestly

[27-Dec-18 10:52 PM] ver_User#6608
yeah, anything between here and 1200 is possible, however IMO it's time for some quality ranging before we find the final low

[27-Dec-18 10:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
dont fool yourself all of 2019 is going to be a bear

[27-Dec-18 10:52 PM] ver_User#6608
not at all

[27-Dec-18 10:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
it will

[27-Dec-18 10:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
im thinking 2020 Q2 return of bull

[27-Dec-18 10:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
By then american stocks will have to crash

[27-Dec-18 10:53 PM] ver_User#6608
I posted a fair few ideas above, so will be repeating myself üòâ

[27-Dec-18 10:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I think crypto will react inversely to a stock market crash

[27-Dec-18 10:53 PM] ver_User#6608
ranging is a good bet, bearish bias, rallies totally possible

[27-Dec-18 10:54 PM] ver_User#6608
alt rallies will be good for trading within that

[27-Dec-18 10:54 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm just looking for my entry point right now on BCH

[27-Dec-18 10:54 PM] Markus#5464
I like how u say bull will return 2020 q2 without anything backing ur argument

[27-Dec-18 10:54 PM] BlackJesus#6161
It's a guess all

[27-Dec-18 10:54 PM] Markus#5464
its like saying tomorrow i will win 1 million dollars

[27-Dec-18 10:55 PM] BlackJesus#6161
its a  guess based on looking at patterns

[27-Dec-18 10:55 PM] ver_User#6608
the sell off through 6k was epic

[27-Dec-18 10:55 PM] ver_User#6608
no reason to assume it continues like that IMO

all you need to see that the bear market won't continue straight down is to spend time in trading view crypto chat

[27-Dec-18 10:56 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Patterns tend to repeat themselves

[27-Dec-18 10:56 PM] BlackJesus#6161
in all things

[27-Dec-18 10:56 PM] ver_User#6608
you have all these noobs and non crypto traders turning up with AB = CD pattern, using BFX outlier spike from tether fud and pointing straight to $400 to arrive in january....

[27-Dec-18 10:57 PM] BlackJesus#6161
yea if tether drops out btc will definitely retrace 1k-1500

[27-Dec-18 10:57 PM] Markus#5464
i mean we have alot of news next year that will have impact also, its not only TA that matter in crypto. Look at Waves, they had a huge update and went 300x it had nothing to do with bear market or TA

[27-Dec-18 10:57 PM] Markus#5464
300%*

[27-Dec-18 10:57 PM] ver_User#6608
Waves was clearly a calculated pump
