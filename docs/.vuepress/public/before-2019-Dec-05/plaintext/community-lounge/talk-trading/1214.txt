waiting for this üò¨

[18-Nov-19 05:34 PM] LocoMB#8593
I just got an email that they will start LISK trading soon - seems they prefer LISK to KMD
¬¥We are pleased to announce that Lisk (LSK) will be listed on Kraken starting November 19.¬¥

[18-Nov-19 05:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
lol wanted to post the same thing

[18-Nov-19 05:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
LISK ranked 52nd

[18-Nov-19 05:56 PM] sœÜldat#8733
Kmd is necessarily in their plan

anybody can give me an opinion on when it may be a wise move to go into BCH instead of BTC core?!?!

[18-Nov-19 08:00 PM] PTYX#6840
@LocoMB BTC is king

[18-Nov-19 08:00 PM] PTYX#6840
but BCH is good for spending since it's cheaper to use

[18-Nov-19 08:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
yeah looks like.. unfortunately, because this Blockstream and lightning shit is really not good at all

[18-Nov-19 08:01 PM] LocoMB#8593
maybe BTC will survive the approproitaion attempts and simply become a sort of digital gold?

[18-Nov-19 08:02 PM] Neko#5830
I'm more worried about ETH, it has heavy competition and looks weaker by the day

[18-Nov-19 08:02 PM] LocoMB#8593
associating with psycho Faketoshi was really monstrously monstrously  stupid of Ver

[18-Nov-19 08:03 PM] LocoMB#8593
I have to admit- I dont own any ETH - hated it from its inception

is there any way that Lightning can destroy BTC, other than make people lose money and generally crash and burn?
Lightning is a second layer protocol, so BTC core will not be fundamentally affected if Lightning fails -
onyl makes one wonder about what collateral damage that may do

[18-Nov-19 08:59 PM] Alright#0419
will be fundamentally affected because BTC is purposefully less useful to facilitate need for off-chain stuff

[18-Nov-19 10:16 PM] groundhog#0062
does anyone know y kmdwallets are suspended on huobi and binance, so no transfering possible

[18-Nov-19 10:34 PM] crumb#2550

interesting reversal for KMD as BTC struggles at 8,200

[19-Nov-19 04:15 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
big acquiring happening through thick or thin?

[19-Nov-19 04:51 AM] Redman#2839
Be interesting to see what happens when the deposits opens back up. Hopefully everyone doesn't just clear the buy orders and drive the price down.

[19-Nov-19 06:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
There are several exchanges still open

[19-Nov-19 06:34 AM] Mark81#4505
Deposits/withdraws open for kmd?

[19-Nov-19 07:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Altsbit and someone said bittrex as well yesterday?

[19-Nov-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
looking at orderbooks and depth, if cross chain arbitrage was possible, the binance price would go to 1100, but this assumes there is nobody who is waiting to buy until after the exchanges open. clearly there are those waiting to deposit and sell, but for those expecting a 50% correction, that doesnt seem likely. current CMC price is most likely +/- 5% from the price it will be after exchange wallets are open

[19-Nov-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the big unknown is what is the ratio between the people waiting to sell vs waiting to buy, which of course if very hard to estimate. it sure would be good to have a fully cleared market price without this fuzzy factor

[19-Nov-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
the price on bittrex is indeed lower, but then again how many in china are using bittrex. the current theory is that most of the new demand is coming from china, so it makes sense to have a premium price on chinese exchanges vs. discount price on non-china ones

pullback to 10980 would be nice as a new support

[19-Nov-19 08:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but mostly uncharted territory now

[19-Nov-19 12:52 PM] Privatoshi#9487
@jl777c. Why aren't Chinese users using AtomicDex?

[19-Nov-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
some are.

[19-Nov-19 01:00 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I hope we can attract more.

[19-Nov-19 01:01 PM] Privatoshi#9487
@jl777c How about possibly listing CNH‚ÇÆ?

[19-Nov-19 01:02 PM] Privatoshi#9487
The new ERC-20 tether backed Chinese Yuan stablecoin

[19-Nov-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810

[19-Nov-19 02:40 PM] Oszy#5734
wait for it to jump to 10k that will be the party crash üòÑ

listing CNH‚ÇÆ is a great idea actually brilliant suggestion @Privatoshi

[19-Nov-19 03:27 PM] willofleo#7505
you want the Chinese trade their currency , maybe away for them to onboard usd and other kmd based asset to diversify , after all they have the highest number of millionaires being generated at a given time

[19-Nov-19 03:38 PM] TonyL#3577
as I can see CNH‚ÇÆ is not widely using yet (just 35 transfers of this token and it 
 was launched in Sept) https://etherscan.io/token/0x6e109e9dd7fa1a58bc3eff667e8e41fc3cc07aef and USDT is not compatible now with mm2 because of the non-standart ERC20 token (so CNH‚ÇÆ probably too) but we'll research on this matter

.5 fib retracement bounce?

[19-Nov-19 04:39 PM] richardt#2807
@Oszy  that's the thing. BTC goes down, pulls everything down with it. Then it'll pop back up and everyone sells alts to fomo into BTC üòÑ

[19-Nov-19 07:03 PM] phm87#7395
I like to buy, put a stop loss, wait then raise the stop loss. Maybe it is time

[19-Nov-19 07:04 PM] JimD#9272
Good strat as long as trading fees are low

[19-Nov-19 07:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
thats why Kraken is a nice exchange

[19-Nov-19 07:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
possible to put trailing stoplosses etc

[19-Nov-19 08:12 PM] zenosama#5371
If u print a paper wallet and it has qr code, you can only deposit or withdraw coins too?

[19-Nov-19 08:13 PM] Arno#3334
withdraw only if you import the private key into a wallet.

[19-Nov-19 08:15 PM] zenosama#5371
Mhmm, so deposit goes only with public address alright

[19-Nov-19 08:17 PM] Oszy#5734
the *casual 100k buy* would put us back to 13790

[19-Nov-19 08:26 PM] Arno#3334
@zenosama yes

[19-Nov-19 08:26 PM] Arno#3334
Just make sure to keep the private key safe.

support at .5 retracement?

[20-Nov-19 10:46 AM] Mark81#4505
more likely 0.618. anything else above is waist of money.

[20-Nov-19 10:55 AM] Mark81#4505
also it might be that full retracement is going to needed to validate recent bottom for new bull market to start.

[20-Nov-19 11:09 AM] Mark81#4505
I went back to early 2017 charts on few altcoins LTC/XRP/XLM. All of them did full retracement to bottom or at least to new higher low before they went to new bull market.

[20-Nov-19 11:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If we were to change trend from bear to bull, RSI daily should start bouncing off 50
