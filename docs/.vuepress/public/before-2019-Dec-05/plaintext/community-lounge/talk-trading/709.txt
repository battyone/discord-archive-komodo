and the result is the same : early creators have vast amounts of coins

[30-May-19 10:45 AM] mrlynch#5735
why are you looking for equality of outcome here?

[30-May-19 10:46 AM] mrlynch#5735
`you NEED to mine the chain to get it going, you can't wait for 1000+ miners from btt to keep it alive`

[30-May-19 10:46 AM] mrlynch#5735
shall i wait for 10k ppl to know about my chain to mine genesis?

[30-May-19 10:47 AM] mrlynch#5735
that would be fair to you?!

[30-May-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
satoshi stopped mining as soon as there were enough other miners

[30-May-19 10:47 AM] Tek#5253
if you can't see where im coming from then thats just sad

[30-May-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
Xcoin had a very suspect start

[30-May-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
darkcoin tried to fix it

[30-May-19 10:47 AM] mrlynch#5735
i see where you're coming from, all i'm saying is that you're wrong

[30-May-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
dash is when the rules finally stabilized

[30-May-19 10:48 AM] mrlynch#5735
as per crypto consensus rules

[30-May-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[30-May-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
things kept changing a lot, all in preference to the early miners

[30-May-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
AFTER it launched

[30-May-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
AFTER it became darkcoin

[30-May-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810

i really don't care about any of the history. I care about now and now it works and works well.

[30-May-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
trying to compare Xcoin -> darkcoin -> DASH with the changing coin emissions along the way to BTC and satoshi...

[30-May-19 10:50 AM] jorian#4555
fiat works well, but the history is questionable

[30-May-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
using such thinking XRP is a crypto

[30-May-19 10:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
what's it to stop them from doing shady things again?! given that _no one cares about the history_

[30-May-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
EOS is a blockchain

[30-May-19 10:51 AM] mrlynch#5735

crypto blasphemy

economic success does not mean it is a decentralized cryptocurrency

[30-May-19 10:51 AM] mrlynch#5735
i guess some are only looking at / interested in fiat gains and not what crypto stands for

[30-May-19 10:52 AM] Tek#5253
no im interested in shit that works and dash works

[30-May-19 10:52 AM] mrlynch#5735
untill it won't and you get rekt

[30-May-19 10:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
crypto**currency** - _to be used for p2p payments as an alternative fiat, especially with the recession we are in, inflation rates, etc_ - let it sink in

[30-May-19 11:26 AM] jorian#4555
kmd was basically a stable coin the last few weeks

[30-May-19 11:26 AM] Tek#5253
yeah it kept its usd value

[30-May-19 11:26 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 11:27 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 11:49 AM] Tek#5253
TL;DR As other community thoughtleaders like Jonald_Fyookball, Roger Ver, BCH devs et. al and those like Vitalik Buterin are realizing, Coinjoin is the best privacy method for blockchains. Dash has the best implementation of Coinjoin in PrivateSend with several protocol level-features that means that no other coin including Monero can provide the same level of security, speed, and strength of privacy by anon set size that Dash can. End TL;DR

[30-May-19 11:51 AM] Tek#5253
i do not know of any. I thought pivx was a dash fork but its proof of stake

[30-May-19 11:52 AM] Tek#5253
what I do know is that the PETRO ( venezuela's new state issues crypto currency ) is a dash fork üòõ

[30-May-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
coinjoin anon set does not compare to zksnark
