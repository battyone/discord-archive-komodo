BTC going full retard again

[19-May-19 05:09 AM] designer#4893
If Wall Street invests, Bitcoin is more than $100,000 at conservative prices.

[19-May-19 05:10 AM] designer#4893
the market cap of bitcoin is still too low.

[19-May-19 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
the day at greenline and jump up 5% pattern is back! it only had that one skip when it showed weakness and i alerted it might go to low $7000s, now it is back to the weekly average. if it stabilizes at the green and goes up 5% again,then maybe the whale stairmaster is turned on again

[19-May-19 08:03 AM] Malti#3948
I don‚Äôt know who whale stairmaster is, but he/she (hopefully she) turns me on as well :shexy:

[19-May-19 10:11 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Hollowman9000 @SHossain @Gordon Komodo 
I'll try to elaborate as best as I can. We had planned a dPoW for the K64 token, but elections, and we didn't do it as early against the  advised given from ChainMakers. Also, we have been in a rollercoaster ride. We didn't expect to get so much exposure and expand like we did when we started Komodore64. For us, it was just a small ecosystem project, that has exploded into something that goes beyond our wildest dreams. Instead of "winging it", we had to move from freestyle development to an actual company, payrolls and with roughly 18 people on board, a lot of things had to be prioritized. One of these being the K64 token. The deal we made, kept the K64 token "safe", not being part of the deal (the investment is purely based on the intellectual property, game distribution, our grants, opportunities and business models). However now the elections are over, dPoW is on the hot list of course.

[19-May-19 10:14 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Hollowman9000 @SHossain @Gordon Komodo 
Yes, every tester will receive some K64 tokens. That is a promise we made and will keep. And with K64 listed in Agama, that will be a lot easier. If you are a "Player" on our Discord, there is a list where you can fill in the details. A new K64 bot will manage that for us, which is being produced. Regarding coins, our platform 100% supports KMD and RFOX too.

[19-May-19 10:16 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Hollowman9000 @SHossain @Gordon Komodo 
We're still working out a lot of details. On this server, we mostly focus on our ecosystem project, which is the Komodo Gaming SDK. Of course we do sometimes announce some stuff, but we like to separate our business activities from the work we share with the Komodo community.

[19-May-19 10:20 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Hollowman9000 @SHossain @Gordon Komodo 
The reason why we didn't inform publicly our plans, because it was a very big deal. We have received a lot of help from RedFOX Labs, @Bitcoin Benny flew over to us and aided us with this deal and they will continue to support us in the future. In fact, we signed a partnership so Komodore64 becomes a real company and follows the RedFOX Labs model to become a strong company. From a business perspective, it is essential; Ben Fairbank has a serious fuckload of experience when it comes to management and structuring company activities and growth strategies.

[19-May-19 10:22 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Hollowman9000 @SHossain @Gordon Komodo 
One of the things we discussed is the setup of a Komodo Foundation. Which means that we can give back to the Komodo community, so other projects can be accelerated. However, that is still in baby shoes. But, I can say though that it is good for Komodo, good for Komodore64. We want to keep the JL spirit to be truly decentralized, yet collaborate there were necessary.

[19-May-19 10:27 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Hollowman9000 @SHossain @Gordon Komodo 
A lot of people have aided us, ChainMakers, KomodoPioneers, Chainstrike, RedFox Labs, Pirate, Mr. KomodoWorld, JL, Steve Lee, The Hague Tech, INTO Business, Blockbar070, Blockbar030, FishyGuts, Lord Ajay Sharma, OpenBook and so many more. Our team started small and lean, and at the moment we have a 40-60% of women working at Komodore64, a very diverse team. That might sound very propaganda for some people, however, I think - fuck no, I believe - blockchain frees everyone. Most people care only about the technology, but we have the core value that people make the technology possible. And these people all together are contributors to our current growth and success.

[19-May-19 10:30 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Hollowman9000 @SHossain @Gordon Komodo 
Last words on this chinese wall of text, I didn't reallly reach out on Discord, because I decided to be less active to announce things. However, I have kept in touch with a lot of people regarding the progress we are making, and provided transparency for key people in the Komodo and blockchain community. 

There is a fuckload more to come. If you think what I announced is big, you'll be in for a big fucking surprise soon.
