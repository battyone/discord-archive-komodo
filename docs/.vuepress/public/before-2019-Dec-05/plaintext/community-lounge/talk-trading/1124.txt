I remember being a kid and calling in to radio stations to request a song and then waiting for hours with my finger on the ‚ÄúRec‚Äù button of a small boom box so I could record the song into a mix tape. Old school download, baby.

if i dont remember wrong they said that its possible it would just require some effort to spin up around 10.000 chains so its not focus cause they already know its achieveable

KMD approaching 200ma on 4h chart, we surpassed it for a day in july but have been below it since june

What price u ppl think btc will reach end of current bull cycle?

[08-Sep-19 04:53 PM] Markus#5464
My bet is ~50k

[08-Sep-19 05:08 PM] actionslacks#4072
is this a bull cycle? I don't think they're gonna let the price get that out of hand. if you can manipulate the mcap of a trillion $ gold market, btc is a walk in the park.

Also I don't understand why whales would need to push it so far as 50 k if they can just trade it back and forth more easily in a lower range

[08-Sep-19 05:13 PM] Andersen#8337
In the last five months, every banker has said we're going straight to 100K.  Do you think they would say that if it were true?

[08-Sep-19 08:02 PM] Geert#4612
Labs, Dex, Oot, K64, DP, Hush are written on my note. I will research about them and buy some. Thank you! What spread would you invest in this assets? For example 20% for each asset, or is one with bigger potential?

[08-Sep-19 08:03 PM] Geert#4612
Sorry, it is 6, then i make 100%:6 or you have a better idea? And what is best place to research about the assets?

[08-Sep-19 08:07 PM] Geert#4612
What is Labs, Oot and K64? Hush i have seen a channel here, if i am correct. And DP is the exchange.

[08-Sep-19 08:10 PM] allbits#5898
K64 is highly controversial. Komodo itself has disclaimed any connection. Many believe it to be a sophisticated scam. Research carefully.

Be aware of k64 @Geert, do your own research, before investering! I advice not buying it. And "controversial" is greatly friendly expressed.....
