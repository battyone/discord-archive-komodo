I thought we were having fun..

[09-Nov-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
there has been a lot of news about KMD recently, and with BTC dominance dropping a bit (and maybe reversing directions!), it is no surprise that money flows to alts, but this time around it seems to be more selective as to which ones

[09-Nov-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
the KMD marketing is working

[09-Nov-19 07:41 PM] richardt#2807
@coingirl87 I totally agree that considering ATH, this pump is nothing to really be excited about.  However, if you bought back in at $0.50, this is a great return

[09-Nov-19 07:41 PM] richardt#2807
It's all a matter of perspective

[09-Nov-19 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
ask anybody that knows the crypto space about KMD and invariably they say good things about the tech, and maybe say the marketing isnt as strong as it could be, but if we can get a strong following from China as the blockchain becomes accepted there, people might start saying how good the KMD marketing is

[09-Nov-19 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
when KMD is the top volume coin on binance, along with being top gainer, i would consider that a pump

[09-Nov-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD volume is #25 on binance in the last 24hrs. this does not fit what i consider a pump, which needs to have a lot of volume. this is more people reallocating funds into KMD. maybe many sold on the way down hoping to buy back lower, but now they see the price is moving up, decide it is not so easy to pick the exact bottom.

[09-Nov-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
i do agree with coingirl that there is no sense to be euphoric, but i do think this is an important part of a long term revaluation of KMD

[09-Nov-19 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
for KMD to reach the price levels that makes sense compared to other projects, it really cant avoid having a bunch of +10% type of days. so when those arrive, it shouldnt be such a surprise

perfect scenario here is to touch that 200 daily moving average while holding at or above  the .236

I prefer to look at KMD/ETH.
I mean, I love gaining sats.
I see Bitcoin on another level than the rest. I like gaining on #2, not so much USDT.

[09-Nov-19 08:55 PM] jspook16#3059
you had success?

[09-Nov-19 08:56 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Look at the BNB/ETH chart and you'll see what success is

[09-Nov-19 08:56 PM] Privatoshi#9487
1 BNB is 0.106 ETH

[09-Nov-19 08:56 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I'd like to see Komodo do the same

[09-Nov-19 08:56 PM] Privatoshi#9487
On it's own scale

[09-Nov-19 08:57 PM] Privatoshi#9487
That 0.106 ETH took BNB a long time.

[09-Nov-19 08:57 PM] Privatoshi#9487
One day at a time.

[09-Nov-19 08:57 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I dont see ETH, I see the number 2 project

[09-Nov-19 08:57 PM] Markus#5464
kmd will take it to a whole new lvl with atomicdex where u will be able to trade it against whatever u want basically

[09-Nov-19 08:58 PM] Markus#5464
on centralized exchanges ur limited to a few selected

[09-Nov-19 09:00 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I'm just saying that trading against btc is an uphill battle for everyone

üê∞ nice pump! I tend to hope that this will be sustained growth and continue in the future! .. as i was late to the party- I'll just chime in anyways!

[09-Nov-19 09:09 PM] jspook16#3059
party is over

[09-Nov-19 09:09 PM] Bittersweet#9376
I thought so couple of days ago

[09-Nov-19 09:09 PM] Bittersweet#9376
but look

[09-Nov-19 09:10 PM] jspook16#3059
I meant the discord party

[09-Nov-19 09:12 PM] LocoMB#8593
oh well I was on the sofa next door having some üç∑ wine and listening to old Peter Gabriel stuff ... there'll be more pump parties soon

[09-Nov-19 09:12 PM] jspook16#3059
I concur üôÇ

USSA needs that DEX

[09-Nov-19 10:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
to participate

[09-Nov-19 10:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
or a good vpn

[09-Nov-19 10:55 PM] actionslacks#4072
It was never a question of if but when. But this rise came earlier than I would have expected.

[09-Nov-19 10:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Haven‚Äôt checked in awhile what CEX‚Äôs still allow USSA trading

[09-Nov-19 10:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[09-Nov-19 10:58 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

Atomicdex :p

Could we actually make number one spot on bittrex

[10-Nov-19 01:33 AM] freakbros#9074
That would be Fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkking spectacular

[10-Nov-19 01:35 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Who still uses bittIRS

[10-Nov-19 01:35 AM] richardt#2807
I'm not getting too excited until KMD actually reaches $2. That's a level we haven't been at since the bear market

[10-Nov-19 01:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
We‚Äôre not even back to ICO BTC price yet

[10-Nov-19 01:37 AM] freakbros#9074
At least it‚Äôs getting some attention

[10-Nov-19 01:37 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
But the dudes who loaded up in the 50 cent range are about to shit all over this rally

[10-Nov-19 01:37 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sorry

[10-Nov-19 01:40 AM] jspook16#3059
Lol

[10-Nov-19 01:40 AM] jspook16#3059
Sup @Hollowman9000

[10-Nov-19 01:41 AM] richardt#2807
Not sure how many people actually loaded up in that range

[10-Nov-19 01:42 AM] richardt#2807
At that time, the sentiment was it will go lower

[10-Nov-19 02:07 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@jspook16 nothing much

[10-Nov-19 02:07 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Still talking shit

[10-Nov-19 02:08 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Pay about 5% attention of what I used to for crypto now

[10-Nov-19 02:08 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
USSA got the China treatment from the SEC cucks

[10-Nov-19 02:09 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Waiting on first real DEX

[10-Nov-19 02:44 AM] allbits#5898
It's getting close to the ico price now. You need to factor in annual five percent rewards if you're making a comparison to ico price.

[10-Nov-19 03:12 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Blah blah blah that just means you‚Äôre guilty

There was huge sell pressure at 10k so i don't know how fast we'll be back to attack it.

kraken  exchange ?

Make Them an Offer They Can't Refuse

[10-Nov-19 08:32 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
we should all post tweets to kraken to list kmd (not sure if that would help it get listed, but it will get their attention at least)

[10-Nov-19 08:37 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it will at least show we have strong community

Looks like @Bilaxy_exchange volume is the driving force behind the recent @KomodoPlatform $KMD uptick. Chinese volume and interest in KMD spiking? Price following the Chinese ratings for this undervalued gem? ü§îüöÄ

Clever shill, nice one jacob üòõ

[10-Nov-19 10:30 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Is that volume even real?

[10-Nov-19 10:30 AM] CoinKing88#1540
2x Binance, seems optimistic.

[10-Nov-19 10:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
It could be a reason, no? üôàüòè

[10-Nov-19 10:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But bilaxy has a huge chinese community, so could be the reason tbh

[10-Nov-19 10:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And in the grand scheme of things 3m volume is still quite small

[10-Nov-19 10:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd volume has been historically low compared to peers, what if it‚Äôs only starting to normalize?

[10-Nov-19 10:39 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Yeah i know that but most exchanges have lots of fake volume. Never heard of the exchange and now it does twice the volume of Binance (where a huge amount of KMD is held), its at least a little suspicious

[10-Nov-19 10:40 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Besides that, i like the price action obvious

[10-Nov-19 10:40 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Not just the actual price but the waves KMD is making again

[10-Nov-19 10:40 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Being at the top of the gainers is just good publicity on it's own

[10-Nov-19 10:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
True

[10-Nov-19 11:14 AM] Malti#3948
it's still ridiculous if you think about it, that KMD has a mere 9 mil volume and fkn Algorand hits 110 mil

[10-Nov-19 11:14 AM] Malti#3948
nice rally tho

[10-Nov-19 12:17 PM] ZUL#5637
Algorand just appeared in a commercial on Eurosport tv channel...

[10-Nov-19 12:18 PM] ZUL#5637
Right now.... so perhaps when KMD does the same you'll get the same exposure

[10-Nov-19 12:42 PM] Flint#6435
when was listing on the bilaxy exchange?

[10-Nov-19 12:45 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Bilaxy looks lika 1-on-1 copy of Binance layout wise
