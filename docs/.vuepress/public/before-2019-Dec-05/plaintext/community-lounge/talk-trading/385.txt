energy sources decentralization has much bigger potential then money decentralization

[24-Jan-19 02:18 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ultimately it's a game for energy

[24-Jan-19 02:19 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if yo ugot energy you use that to produce food

[24-Jan-19 02:19 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
simple food - plants are created from pure energy = sun

[24-Jan-19 02:20 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but you cen generalize that

[24-Jan-19 02:20 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
we are also machines - our fuel are plants and animals

[24-Jan-19 02:20 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
animals eat plants, plants eat energy = sun

[24-Jan-19 02:20 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
the whole world is just a energy stream through different levels, species, even technology

[24-Jan-19 02:21 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
"just" 😛

[24-Jan-19 02:22 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
govs have power because they accumulated a lot of energy (like army - bombs , weaposns is energy) or other kinds of energy (indirect = money, human resources)

[24-Jan-19 02:23 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
the source of current energy (energy generalized also as money) is coal, oil, gas

[24-Jan-19 02:23 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
coal, oil, gas is centralized around cartels

[24-Jan-19 02:24 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if you decentralize it (allow people create energy from renewable sources - sunlight and wind energy) you take the power from govs

[24-Jan-19 02:24 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and may be less wars and less hunger

[24-Jan-19 02:25 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
wars are many times about energy sources I think

[24-Jan-19 02:26 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
hidden motives are nations frustrated with long term poverty, and this poverty is also due to wealth centralization, and ultimate source of wealth is energy / power

[24-Jan-19 02:28 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
true, but isn't Elon Musk working on Solar Cities ?

[24-Jan-19 02:28 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
wind turbines and solar panels are new tech and ongoing improvements are there

[24-Jan-19 02:29 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
idea is old, technologies  - ongoing progress

[24-Jan-19 02:30 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
now they try to use graphene in solar panels, graphene was just discovered

[24-Jan-19 02:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
talking about decentralization of energy I mean - to spread it equally between countries, not between individual people

[24-Jan-19 02:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
currently few countries own most, right?

[24-Jan-19 02:32 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
my house need not more then 5 kw and my roof is more then 5 m2, so I think 1kw/m2 is good enough 😃

[24-Jan-19 02:33 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
1kW / m2 is quit big, doubt possible within 10-20 years

[24-Jan-19 02:34 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
where is that ?

[24-Jan-19 02:34 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Australia ?

[24-Jan-19 02:36 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
yes, another things is energy consumption optimization - many devices badly designed take more then needed maybe? Like light bulbs - we have LED now, which takes little energy to give a lot of light

[24-Jan-19 02:41 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
what is money and why it has value?

[24-Jan-19 02:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if you go to the reoots it is about energy

[24-Jan-19 02:44 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
money are convinient way to exchange value

[24-Jan-19 02:44 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
roots are: I hun a deer (I use my body energy for that) - you plan potatoes (use your body energy) and we exchange

[24-Jan-19 02:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
to make exchanges easier in general - and intermediary was found

[24-Jan-19 02:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
intermediary parameters are - easy ot exchange (small) and relative stable value (not easy to get) = which was gold for example

[24-Jan-19 02:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or silver

[24-Jan-19 02:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or even copper

[24-Jan-19 02:46 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
then people got used to that, and just recently someone replaces it with papers, and people got use to that too, but in roots it is your egenry = production

[24-Jan-19 02:47 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
yes land is not energy = was always here

[24-Jan-19 02:47 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but you know they say E=mc^2 so land is also energy 😛 according to modenr physics

[24-Jan-19 02:48 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
according to business may be to - if you got some oil in it

[24-Jan-19 04:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I did it

[24-Jan-19 04:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
bought a hybrid

[24-Jan-19 04:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd is green

[24-Jan-19 04:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and so will my car be

[24-Jan-19 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽

[24-Jan-19 04:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
I just bought a $3 “hybrid” badge on eBay and put it on my vehicle. Now i park in the low emissions parking spots and clueless millennials smile at me.

[24-Jan-19 04:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hahaha

[24-Jan-19 04:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I did it mostly for the tax benefits 😄

[24-Jan-19 04:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
+-25% cheaper compared to the model without the battery stuff

[24-Jan-19 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_spent $1800 on his car_

[24-Jan-19 04:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_and $700 on his truck_

[24-Jan-19 04:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
100% tax deductible :p

[24-Jan-19 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Draeth 👆🏽 example of what I was saying in PIRATE chat 😛

[24-Jan-19 04:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And what was the discussion? :p

[24-Jan-19 04:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
'its not fair that people get to deduct costs for running their business?'

[24-Jan-19 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that the "average joe" pays less tax than the "rich" 😛

[24-Jan-19 04:53 PM] Draeth#3300
I never said that actually, re read what I wrote.

[24-Jan-19 04:53 PM] Draeth#3300
The only thing I said was about statutory vs effective tax rate

[24-Jan-19 04:53 PM] Draeth#3300
Nowhere did I claim they paid less in taxes

[24-Jan-19 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"effective tax rate" of 0% < "rich" pay
because, math

[24-Jan-19 04:54 PM] Draeth#3300
So I'm rich?

[24-Jan-19 04:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`So I'm rich?`
do you pay (actually *pay*) 16+% of your gross earnings to the US govt?

[24-Jan-19 04:57 PM] Draeth#3300
Yep

[24-Jan-19 04:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Then, yes, you are

[24-Jan-19 04:57 PM] Draeth#3300
Then damn, 65k a year is a low bar to set for being rich

[24-Jan-19 04:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Just ask the girl in Guatemala that earns 10cents a day....

[24-Jan-19 05:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`65k a year is a low bar to set for being rich`
you get that that is 3x grater than the "poverty level", right?
you make 3x what poor people do, that's:
`rich
adjective
    Having a great deal of money or assets; wealthy.`

[24-Jan-19 05:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and our "poor" are rich by the "average joe" of the rest of the world

[24-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Draeth#3300
Yea it's a loose term obviously

[24-Jan-19 05:07 PM] Draeth#3300
I'm curious, what are your thoughts on putting the marginal tax rate back up to where it used to be

[24-Jan-19 05:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`where it used to be`
"used to be" as in before we instituted all of the social welfare programs like SSI?

[24-Jan-19 05:10 PM] Draeth#3300
In the 50s

[24-Jan-19 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not in favor of any "Robin Hood" taxes, ever

[24-Jan-19 05:21 PM] Draeth#3300
Gotcha, that's where our viewpoints differ a bit

[24-Jan-19 05:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
Taxation is theft. Listening to people debate the specifics is like watching wanna-be thieves talk about whether they should use a knife, gun or just be a pick pocket.  “How should we best steal from the people to most benefit them?”

[24-Jan-19 05:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Taxation is theft. `
all I can say to that is
🤦🏽

[24-Jan-19 05:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
Thats about all you say to things you dont have an argument against.

[24-Jan-19 05:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's sad that your little mind confuses "not knowing exactly where to begin pointing out the multitudes of wrongness" of a claim with "dont have an argument against" a claim

[24-Jan-19 05:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
But, I'll start by saying that the govt cannot steal that which is already theirs....

[24-Jan-19 05:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
Not an argument

[24-Jan-19 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
True, because an "argument" requires that your base premise isn't entirely flawed and actually has some basis to be "argued" against

[24-Jan-19 05:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
Still not an argument.

[24-Jan-19 05:36 PM] meatspoon#7860
Since you are always so contrary, it would behoove you to understand what an argument is.  If you understood what one was, you would know that you need to present reason and/or evidence for your case.

[24-Jan-19 05:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you, literally, bore me enough that I'm going to watch reruns on TV now

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I pay like 40% taxes

[24-Jan-19 05:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
dont think I'm rich tho

[24-Jan-19 05:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`37%     $600,001 or more`
*after deductions* 🙄

[24-Jan-19 05:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Welcome to Belgium

[24-Jan-19 05:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Highest tax bracket is 50% for revenues after deductibles at 40480,01 EUR

[24-Jan-19 05:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`38,080 Euro equals
$43,045.02`
for max
still puts you @ like 2x the "poverty level" of the US

[24-Jan-19 05:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
38k was the highest bracket in 2016

[24-Jan-19 05:57 PM] Meyse#0952
what is poverty in the states? on a monthly basis? like 1800$?

[24-Jan-19 05:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```2019 POVERTY GUIDELINES FOR THE 48 CONTIGUOUS STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

Anyway, I dont mind paying taxes, but when I see what my taxmoney is being used for I do

[24-Jan-19 06:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
