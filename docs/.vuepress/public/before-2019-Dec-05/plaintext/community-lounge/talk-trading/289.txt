btc is heading towards $5000  ....

[19-Nov-18 07:04 PM] dokrates#8987
bears pushing hard

[19-Nov-18 07:12 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
@PHBA2061 Towards? It's already 4.9K

[19-Nov-18 07:13 PM] dokrates#8987
looks like within next minutes/hours btc will break 5000$

[19-Nov-18 07:14 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
Finally!

[19-Nov-18 07:14 PM] actionslacks#4072
still dropping, sv chain got slight reorg'd, fun wont stop.

[19-Nov-18 07:15 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@WhiteWidow I'm looking at binance price

[19-Nov-18 07:16 PM] dokrates#8987
wow coinbase 4880$

[19-Nov-18 07:16 PM] dokrates#8987
im looking bitfinex price

[19-Nov-18 07:17 PM] PHBA2061#2530
what I'm afraid is we could have a domino effect here, btc goes lower => triggers stop-loss => goes even lower and trigger even more stop loss üò¢

[19-Nov-18 07:17 PM] dokrates#8987
yes, thats the reason i think we will hit in bitfinex 4800 then 4600 then big bounce

[19-Nov-18 07:18 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
The force is strong within KMD

[19-Nov-18 07:18 PM] dokrates#8987
for me the most important exchagnes are bitfinex and binance

[19-Nov-18 07:18 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
my buy awaiting at 4.3k if it hits I buy KMD with it

[19-Nov-18 07:19 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@PHBA2061  can it also trigger start-gain to balance stop-loss ?

[19-Nov-18 07:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
stock market is breaking some key levels as well.

[19-Nov-18 07:21 PM] dokrates#8987
do you guys think if btc goes below 4800$ we will see again 15k sat in kmd?

[19-Nov-18 07:22 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
black friday ?

[19-Nov-18 07:25 PM] dokrates#8987

Will this not kill most projects

[19-Nov-18 09:25 PM] Sdunbar#5064
How are salaries being paid at this point?

[19-Nov-18 09:25 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I guess easily if they cashed out their massive ICO funds into USD right away back in the ICO hayday

[19-Nov-18 09:25 PM] actionslacks#4072
Many will fail

[19-Nov-18 09:25 PM] Sdunbar#5064
otherwise though??

[19-Nov-18 09:25 PM] Sdunbar#5064
is KMD ok fundswise?

[19-Nov-18 09:26 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I know they raised their funds before the days of the 50 million dollar ICO

[19-Nov-18 09:27 PM] jl777c#5810
the ICO BTC funds are mostly reserved for notarization, the team funds of KMD is indeed running low... but we are ok for the time being

[19-Nov-18 09:28 PM] jl777c#5810
if this bear lasts another year, then some things would need to change

[19-Nov-18 09:28 PM] Sdunbar#5064

We are really shitting the bed today.  The panic selling is off the charts

[19-Nov-18 09:44 PM] dokrates#8987
but i don't see too much panic in komodo after the bounce at 15k sat

[19-Nov-18 09:45 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I think it is just temporally , it btc drops even further,  it could drag kmd down aswell ...

[19-Nov-18 09:51 PM] dokrates#8987
coinbase 4700$

[19-Nov-18 09:51 PM] dokrates#8987
