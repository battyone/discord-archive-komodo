Just needs to work :abusedsmily:

[13-Jul-19 02:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
And not be upstream raped

[13-Jul-19 02:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@hyperDEX im with you on heat, I think they missed the boat

[13-Jul-19 02:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then got steamrolled by regulations while waving goodbye from the dock

[13-Jul-19 02:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Chain scaling blew their 1000tps dream away

[13-Jul-19 02:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
And barterdex X.0 invalidated their proxy exchange

[13-Jul-19 02:49 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Waves had their proxy dex beaten usage-wise

[13-Jul-19 02:49 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Day late and a dollar short

[13-Jul-19 02:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
For anyone not on heat discord, i asked their devs if they would want to use their frontend/GUI skills to help KMD and basically work together to fulfill KMDs vision (obviously need to align incentives etc and lots to work out) but working together would be better for everyone.

[13-Jul-19 02:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Need to somehow get heat holders on board but considering most came from NXT and SuperNET holding over 5%, dont think it would be too hard.

[13-Jul-19 02:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The US regulations surrounding money transmitters killed their exchange, same will kill off waves and all other proxy exchanges.

[13-Jul-19 02:59 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I would like to point out it’s not just US regulations most countries have similar requirements

[13-Jul-19 02:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I should say no users killed off their exchange lol

[13-Jul-19 03:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Really? I thought this was something new?

[13-Jul-19 03:01 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Or maybe it was made more clear that proxy dex would require money transmitter licenses

[13-Jul-19 03:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
That👆

[13-Jul-19 03:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But essentially all the proxy dexs out there is dead once enforcement actions start get taken (think there was one with a eth dex already)

[13-Jul-19 03:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yep, Etherdelta

👍🏻 

[13-Jul-19 03:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If heat does not take action, basically they will run out of money and heat will become a community coin where it will die

[13-Jul-19 03:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I wonder if wrapped BTC would fall under this too

[13-Jul-19 03:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
and the tron USDT etc

[13-Jul-19 03:07 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Most likely,  being a proxy of a proxy .   I don’t know much about heat ,  but if they are willing to shift focus a bit ,  I’m sure we can figure out a project that is mutually beneficial.   Definitely need a GUI interface for tokens in KMD ecosystem  that’s for sure

[13-Jul-19 03:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes, it comes down to pride maybe

[13-Jul-19 03:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If they can think it over and figure out working together is +EV for everyone and they are humble enough to pivot and help Komodo, i am sure it will be a good outcome

[13-Jul-19 03:09 AM] Alecandro#1179
Whaleeeee brooo is backkkk

@Hollowman9000 are you sure the rewards didnt go to a change address?

[13-Jul-19 04:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@hyperDEX it'd be sad day seeing James on Twitter to my opinion. Twitter is a time eater, and total unproductive platform for productive people.

@jl777c

[13-Jul-19 04:58 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yes

[13-Jul-19 04:58 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I tried dumping the privkey for that address before I looked it up and saw it was controlled by others

[13-Jul-19 04:59 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
*dumping privkey via cli

[13-Jul-19 05:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
It wasn’t shown in the GUI, and that was my last ditch way of verifying it wasn’t mine (I had an issue with verus last year where some of the addresses had balances but weren’t listed in the GUI, retrieved them via cli)

[13-Jul-19 05:02 AM] jl777c#5810
can this be reproduced? if so, make sure to let miketoutjr know

[13-Jul-19 05:02 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I need to upgrade to their latest release, I’m using 0.5.6a-beta

[13-Jul-19 05:06 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I don’t see anything in notable changes on the later releases though

[13-Jul-19 05:06 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Gimme a minute to deploy the latest and ill report back, I have another .13kmd reward generated to play with

[13-Jul-19 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
it just seems very strange (unlikely) that change outputs are being sent to random addresses

[13-Jul-19 05:13 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Wasn’t random, guess it was a miner or notary

[13-Jul-19 05:14 AM] jl777c#5810
still, this is the first time i hear of change being sent to a non-wallet address. is it a watch only address?

[13-Jul-19 05:15 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
No, the receiving address was sweeping funds to an address @SHossain Identified as something notary related

Coins are moving through it, I guess mine weren’t expected so they’re still sitting there

0.5.7-3 is booting up

[13-Jul-19 05:33 AM] Mark81#4505
Anyone had issues with digitalprice verus withdrawals? I get econrefused error

[13-Jul-19 05:37 AM] jl777c#5810
hollowmans issue is simple a case of not claiming rewards (that is the issue) and the miner of that block collects it, happend to be a notary

[13-Jul-19 05:38 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Wasn’t it the case before that simply transacting automatically claimed the interest as well?

[13-Jul-19 05:38 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
In the old KMD agama

[13-Jul-19 05:39 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or did you always need to claim first

[13-Jul-19 05:39 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Can’t remember

[13-Jul-19 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
using native mode that is all that is needed. using lite mode, it is up to the GUI

[13-Jul-19 05:44 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Haven’t used lite mode since KMD agama

[13-Jul-19 05:44 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Only native with verus agama

[13-Jul-19 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
native claims the rewards to change address, but your tx had no change address. very strange

[13-Jul-19 05:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Once it’s back up I’ll test again

[13-Jul-19 05:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Shouldn’t be much longer

[13-Jul-19 05:51 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Tx out

[13-Jul-19 05:51 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
@SHossain I'll investigate if I can replicate the interest claim issue as described by @Hollowman9000.

[13-Jul-19 05:52 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Awaiting confirmation

[13-Jul-19 05:53 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
@Mark81 I've seen a report about withdrawal issues in Verus discord some hours ago too.

[13-Jul-19 05:54 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 same result

[13-Jul-19 05:56 AM] Mark81#4505
@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 thanks for reply!

[13-Jul-19 05:56 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Hollowman, On the withdrawal Mark mentioned or on your the interest issue?

[13-Jul-19 05:59 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612

Godballz Yesterday at 19:32 (GMT+2)
Anyone ever get the message- "Error: connect ECONNREFUSED" (followed by what looks like ip address) on Digital Price under the withdraw address box in red letters? 
```
@Mark81 did you get a similar error message?

[13-Jul-19 05:59 AM] Mark81#4505
Yes.

[13-Jul-19 06:00 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
OK, I think it's time to connect to DP discord for me (damn, another Discord channel...)

[13-Jul-19 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
hollowman problem was due to gui using z_sendmany (which doesnt collect rewards) vs. using sendtoaddress (which does)

[13-Jul-19 06:08 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Hollowman just posted your findings in our discord. I trust this will be resolved in the next update,

[13-Jul-19 06:58 AM] Alexfrog#1338
glad you were able to figure it out.  hopefully we'll eventually have a decent KMD wallet 😄

[13-Jul-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it only happened if using native mode and selecting a specific address to fund it, that made it use z_sendmany

[13-Jul-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
a bit of an edge case, but clearly needs to be fixed

Federal Reserve @federalreserve chairman Jerome Powell testifies before Senate, says about Bitcoin:

"Almost no one uses Bitcoin for payment, they use it more as an alternative to gold, is a store of value, its a speculative store of value, like gold." https://t.co/nsU2JL4...

"a speculative store of value, like gold" wtf

[13-Jul-19 08:30 AM] jorian#4555
downplaying the role of gold, meanwhile all the big countries are hoarding it and the US is not selling any gold either

[13-Jul-19 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Put all my super in gold stocks early 2017, its up 100% as of a few weeks ago. Gold is important

gold is just bitcoin version 0.1, we have invented better technology for storing value than shiny rocks now
