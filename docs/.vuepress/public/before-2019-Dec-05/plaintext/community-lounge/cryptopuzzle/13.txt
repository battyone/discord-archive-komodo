whoever cracked lvl 1 has most likely bruteforced it. it was VERY easy. If you used a public dictionary for dictionary bruteforce attack it would have been solved in under 3 minutes.

[17-Feb-19 10:15 AM] ca333#0118
level1 "solver" plz post the solution for level 1 and how you "cracked" it

[17-Feb-19 10:15 AM] Decker#3767
let's try bruteforce then )

[17-Feb-19 10:15 AM] ca333#0118
for level 1 good idea

[17-Feb-19 10:17 AM] Decker#3767
but it's possible to solve level 1 without bruteforce, just looking on picture?

[17-Feb-19 10:18 AM] ca333#0118
yes

hint for level 1: take a close look on the picture. what do you see? think about numeral systems.

[17-Feb-19 10:19 AM] Decker#3767
seems logic was komodo logo is related to Oct ...

[17-Feb-19 10:19 AM] Decker#3767
or something like it ...

[17-Feb-19 10:25 AM] Decker#3767
seems i need to write fast multithread brute tool in C/C++ ... php is good, but seems little bit slow )

[17-Feb-19 10:26 AM] Decker#3767
guess our "ghost solver" have faster tool ... )

[17-Feb-19 10:31 AM] ca333#0118
no i guess he/she just looked at the picture long enough :)))

[17-Feb-19 10:32 AM] ca333#0118
bruteforcing would be the desperate 'solution' - you can crack it without bruteforce probably faster

[17-Feb-19 10:32 AM] ca333#0118
the solution is basically in the last hint

[17-Feb-19 10:33 AM] CHMEX#0686
#!/bin/bash
for i in {0..10000}
do

curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"c3d8c2a364b7d18c1f9d7321d017b92e9f9c791e4f5c741214fefdea8a071256\",\"method\":\"calcaddress\",\"passphrase\":\"$i\"}" | jq -r $

picture has 8 points Komodo Logo and 4 points block ... and 6 objects total ... 2 halfs of brain ...

[17-Feb-19 10:33 AM] Decker#3767
all of these things doesn't remember me anything numerical systems related )

[17-Feb-19 10:33 AM] Decker#3767
but may be i'm look in other side ...

[17-Feb-19 10:34 AM] CHMEX#0686

[17-Feb-19 10:37 AM] Decker#3767
And what on picture is related to `16`? )

[17-Feb-19 10:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
4x4 maybe

[17-Feb-19 10:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
it fits 16 logos

`10000` it's 16 in binary ...

[17-Feb-19 10:44 AM] CHMEX#0686
there you go

[17-Feb-19 10:44 AM] CHMEX#0686
now level two :S

[17-Feb-19 11:08 AM] Decker#3767
4x4 tile is 0xFFFF possible variants. may be solution for level 2 is a binary representation of number in range 0..65535 ...

[17-Feb-19 11:08 AM] Decker#3767
something like `0001001011000010` ...

[17-Feb-19 11:09 AM] Decker#3767
wher 1 is "something exist" in the grid or not ...

[17-Feb-19 11:28 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
How do you find 16 and 1000? With brut forcing?

[17-Feb-19 11:57 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
First hint how related to these numbers ü§î

[17-Feb-19 12:08 PM] Decker#3767
it's picture releated ... 4x4 = 16 (dec) = 10000 (bin) ...

[17-Feb-19 12:12 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
I understand the binary but 4*4 ??from  Where you got it

[17-Feb-19 12:30 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
This puzzle should named crypto puzzle for dev's üòÖ

[17-Feb-19 12:33 PM] Decker#3767
it's 4x4 ...

[17-Feb-19 12:50 PM] ca333#0118
16 - so hexadecimal is the hot hint to solve level 2

[17-Feb-19 12:51 PM] ca333#0118
whats the key?

[17-Feb-19 01:08 PM] SHossain#0007
@Decker your image looks 3D to me eyes. red in the front and green at the back and bit of depth in between

[17-Feb-19 01:39 PM] cryptocat#9465
Key = E?

not bad - who solved it?

[17-Feb-19 01:55 PM] cryptocat#9465
Looks like it was solved while everyone was still solving step 1!

[17-Feb-19 01:55 PM] ca333#0118
@CHMEX @Decker - one of you?

[17-Feb-19 01:56 PM] CHMEX#0686
not me

[17-Feb-19 01:57 PM] SHossain#0007
Decker is busy currently with some testing and fixes. So, i don't think it was him üòÉ

[17-Feb-19 01:59 PM] CHMEX#0686
i think it was cryptocal

[17-Feb-19 01:59 PM] cryptocat#9465

[17-Feb-19 02:00 PM] cryptocat#9465
I was out when it was solved.

[17-Feb-19 02:06 PM] CHMEX#0686
funny the person who solved it today somehow accessed the 7.77 coqui from another puzzle

[17-Feb-19 02:07 PM] CHMEX#0686
so maybe ch6ris or LeFevre

[17-Feb-19 02:07 PM] cryptocat#9465
That was the Coqui I added to my prize fund. It seems to be the same person solving all of the puzzles lately

Boooo, the same hidden winner. did n't even had time to learn about the new puzzle this time.

[17-Feb-19 02:51 PM] Strob#3417
Maybe you should not put that whole prize in the wallet before someone comes here with the solution.

[17-Feb-19 02:59 PM] Strob#3417
Anyway I don't have enough programming knowledge to solve those puzzles! Maybe I should come back only when a puzzle will be calling for skills like general knowledge, komodo research, culture, history, cinema etc.

could be nice if each puzzle coudl state the required skills: like you need to be a programmer, or strong in mathematic etc.

From reading chat if I had to guess I would think the answer is 06bdef  in binary format

000001101011110111101111

[17-Feb-19 04:26 PM] LeFevre#5755
so the solver went from both level 1 answers...straight to the end

[17-Feb-19 04:26 PM] LeFevre#5755
skipping level 2

[17-Feb-19 04:26 PM] LeFevre#5755

[17-Feb-19 04:27 PM] LeFevre#5755
I almost feell ike level 1s might have just been yoinked by a bot

lol

[17-Feb-19 04:27 PM] LeFevre#5755
that just browses weak passwords on the reg

[17-Feb-19 04:28 PM] LeFevre#5755
seems weird to be able to solve level 3 without level 2

[17-Feb-19 04:29 PM] cryptocat#9465
Should we use a hex keypad layout to solve step 2 or 3??

[17-Feb-19 06:58 PM] ca333#0118
very interesting - so lvl 2 is still not solved but lvl 3 is

[17-Feb-19 06:59 PM] ca333#0118
ok - looking at it i know how it was solved.

[17-Feb-19 06:59 PM] ca333#0118
it was bruteforced.

[17-Feb-19 07:02 PM] PTYX#6840
sounds like the work of decker :troll:

[17-Feb-19 07:38 PM] LeFevre#5755
yep

[17-Feb-19 07:39 PM] LeFevre#5755
just needed to increase the range on that number count

[17-Feb-19 07:39 PM] LeFevre#5755
could even limit it to just 1s and 0s

[17-Feb-19 07:39 PM] LeFevre#5755
and you'll find level 3

[17-Feb-19 07:39 PM] LeFevre#5755
still unsure how to get level 2

[17-Feb-19 07:39 PM] LeFevre#5755
level 3 solve is strange

[17-Feb-19 07:41 PM] LeFevre#5755
best guess is something about 7*7

[17-Feb-19 07:41 PM] LeFevre#5755
that was suppose to get you to level 3

[18-Feb-19 04:56 AM] Hermes#6934
not only knowledge of while loops but I imagine most of the solvers know a couple of things about cryptography

[18-Feb-19 12:51 PM] cryptocat#9465
Doesn't that defeat the purpose of calling them "crypto" puzzles?

[18-Feb-19 12:52 PM] cryptocat#9465
Before solving these puzzles I knew next-to-nothing about blockchain encryption (e.g. SHA256) but now I do! They are a great learning tool, with a potential reward at the end.

[18-Feb-19 02:54 PM] cryptocat#9465
Perhaps having a few more puzzles like the first two - guessing that the answer is the last letter before a full stop, or working  out that the wave chart is 1 for above and 0 for below. They are fun too.
So more "cryptic" puzzles rather than "cryptographic" puzzles? ü§∑üèº

[18-Feb-19 03:04 PM] cryptocat#9465
That way there are more like brain teasers rather than mathematical problems. I'm a fan of both! ü§ì
