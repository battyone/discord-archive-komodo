Let's hope today's @ca333 Medium article puzzle is a little easier. Big prize of 777 KMD too.

Ok ... one relatively easy puzzle from me ))

**Wen Moon Puzzle**

Wen Moon was a chinese McDonald's manager. After hard work week he got drunk ... ) And sent last 0.5 DEX from his wallet to this address https://dex.kmdexplorer.io/address/RKvq6XqCU7TwKjqkGYzbDL6cBgnhJQqo2u and forget about it. But in 2045, when 1 DEX = 500 BTC he remember about it and start trying to recover his funds ... The only one thing that he remember about "sent day" was that this is end of week and he was very drunk ))

May be he just want to buy additional 0.5l of whiskey for this 0.5 DEX ... who knows ... he lose it ... But it's still available to recover )

"Monday is the first day of the week according to the international standard ISO 8601, but in the US, Canada, and Japan it's counted as the second day of the week." Not sure about China.

[05-Feb-19 03:12 PM] Decker#3767
Makes sense )

[05-Feb-19 03:12 PM] cryptocat#9465
however he is "chineese", not chinese. Is this a clue? Or a typo hahaha

[05-Feb-19 03:13 PM] Decker#3767
Some conditions in puzzle description is important to solve, some not )

[05-Feb-19 03:22 PM] Decker#3767
Additionally, seems he was very drunk ... https://supernet.kmdexplorer.io/address/RKvq6XqCU7TwKjqkGYzbDL6cBgnhJQqo2u ... bcz he sent not only DEX on this address )

[05-Feb-19 03:22 PM] Decker#3767
0.5 DEX + 0.5 SUPERNET = ~1 x :rum:  )

[05-Feb-19 03:33 PM] cryptocat#9465
"The only one thing that he remember about "sent day" was that this is end of week and he was very drunk" - that's two things, not one. Could another hint.

Are you ready for the next #KMD #cryptopuzzle? 777 KMD are waiting for you in the #Forbes article that featured #Komodo and our #DEX technology. This is the article: https://t.co/P4u4aVjvc0 - hint: "This #cryptopuzzle has 2 levels". ps. We will add 777 KMD each week until ...

Ok let's go!

[06-Feb-19 07:05 PM] cryptocat#9465
Levels...the article references the word "levels" 2 times -
- high-level traders
- level playing field

[06-Feb-19 07:11 PM] cryptocat#9465
@ca333 If the prize is increasing each week, does it mean we'll need more clues before it can be cracked?

[06-Feb-19 07:11 PM] cryptocat#9465
Or is it possible to solve it with just the article and clue 1?

[06-Feb-19 07:13 PM] ca333#0118
all info needed is in the article - i estimate that a few hints will be necessary. However, it is not entirely impossible to solve it without clue from my end.
keep in mind what the first hint says.

First hint is too random ... "2 levels" can mean everything ... something in article we should look at ... or just a passphrase derivation method ... like passphrase = F(F(passphrase)) üòÉ First we need to understand where is a "start point" )

[06-Feb-19 08:02 PM] Decker#3767
Already tried some basic and crazy things ) I.e. each word from the article is not passphrase itself ) Some crazy guesses with time periods `10-60` seconds ... also seems wrong start point )

[06-Feb-19 08:04 PM] Decker#3767
Don't want to calc number of points or circles on the deCRED picture, bcz it should be Komodo and BarterDEX related )

[06-Feb-19 08:08 PM] Decker#3767
2 levels can also be related to "client-server architecture", but i don't know how to apply it into passphrase ) So ... currently more questions than answers ... and millions of guesses )

[06-Feb-19 08:22 PM] Decker#3767
Hope, there is will no significant hints today, planning to get some sleep ))))

@Decker Are you thinking it could be something like:
`seed = SHA256 (salt value + secret password)`?

[06-Feb-19 11:16 PM] ca333#0118
really good job so far guys - i have to add this.

[06-Feb-19 11:17 PM] ca333#0118
your combined skillsets and all posts so far have enough power to solve this without any hint. seriously.

May be we should do something with Decred proposal hex string `5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a` ... )

[07-Feb-19 01:14 AM] Decker#3767
It's in article and looks very attractively to use it in puzzle ...

[07-Feb-19 08:40 AM] cryptocat#9465
It's the master key we need to find now

[07-Feb-19 09:01 AM] cryptocat#9465
Do you believe the final seed will be a 64 character SHA256 string?

[07-Feb-19 09:03 AM] cryptocat#9465
I have been encrypting the Decred proposal hex string and trying things like 'DEX', 'official proposal for its own Decentralized Exchange' for the key, but again it's too vague.

[07-Feb-19 09:10 AM] cryptocat#9465
I'm thinking that whatever value we get from applying SHA256, we then need to apply it again? So encrypt the encrypted 64 character string? Maybe that's too complicated. KISS?

[07-Feb-19 10:47 AM] ch6ris#5240
The house a was raised in was number 7

[07-Feb-19 10:47 AM] ch6ris#5240
My favorite number is 6. Maybe it's a bunch of 6's?

[07-Feb-19 10:48 AM] cryptocat#9465
I hope not lol

[07-Feb-19 10:50 AM] ch6ris#5240
every one should donate a little making sure to keep the majority of the 7's. I'm sure someone like Decker will solve it and transfer it to the next pot anyway.

[07-Feb-19 10:56 AM] ch6ris#5240
So has anyone said it's more complicated than just a phrase(s) or paragraph used as a seed?

[07-Feb-19 11:00 AM] Strob#3417
2 levels: think binary!

[07-Feb-19 11:02 AM] ch6ris#5240
Zero zero one. zero one one zero zero one. two.
Amen.

[07-Feb-19 11:04 AM] cryptocat#9465
Good suggestion @Strob

[07-Feb-19 11:07 AM] ch6ris#5240
So a phrase on the article converted to binary? Is it that simple?

[07-Feb-19 11:08 AM] Strob#3417

Yes because I was thinking maybe we just need to look at another level than the text itself, maybe indentation or whatever.

[07-Feb-19 11:11 AM] cryptocat#9465
I'm not sure. @ca333 seemed to suggest @Decker is on the right path, but who knows. Another clue will definitely help.

[07-Feb-19 11:12 AM] ch6ris#5240
Sounds to complicated but I'm just remembering the Agama v0000 seed
