So ... 7 digits in each block ...

[05-Feb-19 12:48 AM] Decker#3767
Checked too many variants ... including the idea that mirrored number to φ=1.1618033988749894848204586834365638117720309179805 can be 0.618033988749894848204586834365638117720309179805 ...

[05-Feb-19 08:37 AM] cryptocat#9465
Like literally reversed? Or the numbers in reverse order?

[05-Feb-19 11:21 AM] ca333#0118
i sent the riddle creator a message yesterday cuz i suspected a more visual approach in solving the riddle. i hope its okay to post this since i wont have time to test this out:

[05-Feb-19 11:22 AM] ca333#0118
so i too suspect that you have to "properly" revert the phi sequence of the 2nd chain in order to crack it

[05-Feb-19 11:22 AM] ca333#0118
plz ping me if this is it

[05-Feb-19 11:33 AM] cryptocat#9465
hmm that's a lot clearer, thanks.

[05-Feb-19 11:34 AM] cryptocat#9465
however I tried the reversing and got nothing. I'm sure there's something small I've missed, or a mistake I've made somewhere

[05-Feb-19 11:35 AM] cryptocat#9465
Oh wait...

[05-Feb-19 11:35 AM] cryptocat#9465
brb 🤔

[05-Feb-19 11:50 AM] cryptocat#9465
I thought maybe we take the fibonacci sequence, break it into 7 blocks of 7 letters, with the φ between each, then reverse it.

[05-Feb-19 11:50 AM] cryptocat#9465
`1567618φ1448527φ9517890φ1677333φ2441985φ5431231φ8532110`

[05-Feb-19 11:50 AM] cryptocat#9465
But that didn't work

[05-Feb-19 11:52 AM] cryptocat#9465
So 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 etc split into 7x7 blocks, then reversed

[05-Feb-19 01:19 PM] Decker#3767
May be i have some "translation misunderstanding", but the meaning of phrase "in the name given to the blockchains" is fade away for me.

[05-Feb-19 01:20 PM] Decker#3767
If that means reverse order of digits in each 7-digits block - i'm already tried it. Nothing.

Still too many variants ... )

[05-Feb-19 01:28 PM] Decker#3767
@sφldat hint that each block should be connected with φ symbol is still actual? i tried φ between each block and / or only at the ends of chain ... nothing ...

[05-Feb-19 01:29 PM] Decker#3767
how may φ symbols should be in passphrase? 2, 12, 14? if not possible - don't answer ... just want to say that i tried all possible variants )

[05-Feb-19 01:31 PM] Decker#3767
interesting ... i was closer in phi.txt or not )))

[05-Feb-19 01:32 PM] Decker#3767
anyway, good mind-breaker ))

[05-Feb-19 01:34 PM] sφldat#8733
6 links 6 φ
The first φ-link (related to the picture) is a point.

Now you need to find the operation to do, stay simple https://gyazo.com/9f68c051fd1b8227ba48fa5081374a6f

still feeling myself - dumb ... ok ... let's explain each φ-link is something like a mirror ... 

it this case we can have something like:
```1618033φ9887498φ9484820φ4586834φ3656381φ1772030φ9179805

[05-Feb-19 01:45 PM] Decker#3767
but still failed ) interesting ))

[05-Feb-19 01:50 PM] cryptocat#9465
I suspect @sφldat is telling us to think more simple

[05-Feb-19 01:52 PM] cryptocat#9465
`"The first φ-link (related to the picture) is a point."` ?? It IS a point?

[05-Feb-19 01:52 PM] Decker#3767
first φ-link i think is a place where first "mystery operation" is applied.

[05-Feb-19 01:53 PM] cryptocat#9465
But then it would not be 6 links?

[05-Feb-19 01:54 PM] Decker#3767
b1φb2φb3φb4φb5φb6φb7 = 6 links ...

may be each number after φ it's just a "next block" ... number = number + 1 ...
