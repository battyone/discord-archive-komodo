But i didn't check it last time, so, i don't know if deposits / withdrawals are open or not.

[11-Feb-19 05:43 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
In barterdex we can exchange it? Do you have tutorials?

[11-Feb-19 05:54 PM] mazyar_lp#3486

From me? Probably this week. Can't promise any timeframes.

[11-Feb-19 06:45 PM] Decker#3767
I have few ideas for easy puzzles and one for hard puzzle ) But all need some preparations.

[11-Feb-19 06:46 PM] Decker#3767
I want my puzzles to be interesting and solveable in "one way" ... without random guesses, like "use capital letters or not", "use \n or not", etc )

For your puzzle @Decker, I tried with his address as a passphrase, stuff you could do while really drunk! And so the Wen Moon on twitter is that you?

[11-Feb-19 07:43 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
@Decker yeah your puzzles too . Your type of puzzles without random things are perfect

[12-Feb-19 10:26 AM] cryptocat#9465
I'll see if I can get time to create one in the next few days. We can fit it in between the other ones.

@Decker i am waiting for your not vague puzzles

[15-Feb-19 11:14 AM] linuxcaptain#2335
i think i m on the right path @cryptocat .  Because i think you had a motive to create this puzzle. you want the people who are trying to solve this puzzle to increase their knowledge in something. to learn ... But i ll wait for the next clue before i tell what i m thinking.

[15-Feb-19 12:02 PM] cryptocat#9465
Also consider what you've learned so far for the previous 3 puzzles

I've tried to make it relatively "safe", so no issues with newline entries.

[15-Feb-19 12:30 PM] cryptocat#9465
I'll post another clue shortly.

[15-Feb-19 12:31 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
without your next clue can we solve it?

[15-Feb-19 12:39 PM] cryptocat#9465
You sure can

[15-Feb-19 12:41 PM] cryptocat#9465
It can be solved from the first clue alone

@KomodoPlatform Clue 4: What is "strong" in the article?
Twitter

[15-Feb-19 12:49 PM] cryptocat#9465
I don't want to give away too much, but I also don't want you to be frustrated 🤕 
The solution is comprised of 3 steps - 
Step 1: Get value(s)
Step 2: Convert value(s)
Step 3: Encrypt value(s)
I'll post this on twitter shortly, but you guys/gals can have a head-start with this.

[15-Feb-19 12:50 PM] cryptocat#9465
The first clue contains everything you need for Step 1 and 2. Step 3 you should be familiar with by now 😉

[15-Feb-19 12:50 PM] cryptocat#9465
Ok now it's easy. I'll expect it to be solved within the next 12 hours haha

[15-Feb-19 12:52 PM] cryptocat#9465
If no one solved it then I will create an address to solve step 1 solution, so you know you are on the right path. But I don't think it is needed.
