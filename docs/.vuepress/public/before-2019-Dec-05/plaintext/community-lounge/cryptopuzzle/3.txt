or was that the drunk guy who forgot he's secret key?

[07-Feb-19 12:14 PM] ch6ris#5240

[07-Feb-19 12:15 PM] Strob#3417
So now do I need to enter level on a second line by pasting like for the first puzzle?

[07-Feb-19 12:16 PM] ca333#0118
next hint later today

well done @Strob  ! did you plan to give us the solution ?

[07-Feb-19 12:41 PM] Strob#3417
I will just say it was easy and not at the same time. Cause anyone could have get the first level without any skillset but at the same time there were many possibilities.

[07-Feb-19 12:42 PM] Strob#3417
I got it in like 2 tries so that's why I can't believe I got it so fast.

[07-Feb-19 12:42 PM] Strob#3417
But I feel like level 2 will be far more difficult...

[07-Feb-19 12:43 PM] Strob#3417
Cause then I guess I would need some skillset that I don't have!

[07-Feb-19 12:43 PM] cryptocat#9465
Can I ask if it's numeric or alphabetical? Or alpha-numeric?

[07-Feb-19 12:46 PM] Strob#3417
I could enter it in agama by hitting only 3 keystroke on my keyboard. 😉

[07-Feb-19 12:48 PM] Gam_B1t#6991
oh ! private key with only 3 caracters ?

[07-Feb-19 12:48 PM] Gam_B1t#6991
So level one is required to find level 2 ?

[07-Feb-19 12:48 PM] Strob#3417
I didn't say 3 characters, 3 keystroke

[07-Feb-19 12:49 PM] Strob#3417
I guess I have to convert level 1 with some mathematical process to get level 2...

[07-Feb-19 12:49 PM] cryptocat#9465
keystroke - "a single depression of a key on a keyboard."

[07-Feb-19 12:49 PM] Gam_B1t#6991
ok

[07-Feb-19 12:52 PM] cryptocat#9465
Do you mean it's 3 different keys, but they are repeated in the same string?

[07-Feb-19 12:53 PM] cryptocat#9465
A keystroke means pressing a button 😂

[07-Feb-19 12:53 PM] Strob#3417
Think more like shortcuts on the keyboard.

[07-Feb-19 12:53 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
ctrl shift...

[07-Feb-19 12:54 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
😛

[07-Feb-19 12:55 PM] Strob#3417
Yes precisely I pressed only 3 keys, one of them 2 times and the other 2, 1 time each

[07-Feb-19 12:56 PM] cryptocat#9465
@linuxcaptain Did you get it?

[07-Feb-19 12:56 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
no... if I get it ill open source it.😛

[07-Feb-19 12:57 PM] cryptocat#9465
haha

[07-Feb-19 12:59 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
ctrl +c ctrl +v 🤔

@Strob has been playing us? 😂

[07-Feb-19 01:00 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
get him hahahhah

[07-Feb-19 01:03 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
how many characters @Strob ? 😁

[07-Feb-19 01:09 PM] Strob#3417
You got it!!!!

[07-Feb-19 01:10 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
So.. dont let me copying and pasting...😂

[07-Feb-19 01:10 PM] Strob#3417
So it was that easy, take the most important info in the text, copy and paste it in agama as a seed and you could get level 1.

[07-Feb-19 01:12 PM] Strob#3417
Now I hope the next hint will be about how to get from level 1 to level 2! Or ca333 will just give out level 1 answer as a hint.

@cryptocat ?

[07-Feb-19 01:23 PM] Strob#3417
I tried converting level 1 to morse code, binary, hexadecimal, Octa (3-digit),  Binary 7-bit, Binary 8-bit, decimal (3-digit), decimal, reverse words, reverse letters, ASCII numbers.... still nothing

[07-Feb-19 01:24 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
Give us the morse code @Strob 😂

[07-Feb-19 01:25 PM] cryptocat#9465
Sorry was getting lunch. Working on it now!

👌 

[07-Feb-19 01:26 PM] Strob#3417
First word of level 1 in morse code: -.- --- -- --- -.. ---

[07-Feb-19 01:27 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
KOMODO

[07-Feb-19 01:27 PM] Strob#3417
Right!

[07-Feb-19 01:27 PM] ch6ris#5240
KOMODO

[07-Feb-19 01:27 PM] ch6ris#5240

[07-Feb-19 01:29 PM] Strob#3417
That was an easy one right?

[07-Feb-19 01:29 PM] cryptocat#9465
Yes...but no

[07-Feb-19 01:30 PM] Strob#3417
Exactly

[07-Feb-19 01:32 PM] Gam_B1t#6991
KOMODO is really the key ? it is too short when I use it in the Komodo password generator wallet

[07-Feb-19 01:32 PM] Strob#3417
No just first word

[07-Feb-19 01:33 PM] Strob#3417
So far: it's in the text, start by komodo and is the most important info!

[07-Feb-19 01:33 PM] ch6ris#5240
Komodo is ahead of Decred

[07-Feb-19 01:33 PM] cryptocat#9465
yaaaay

[07-Feb-19 01:33 PM] ch6ris#5240

[07-Feb-19 01:35 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
Thanks @Strob

[07-Feb-19 01:35 PM] Gam_B1t#6991
oh !

[07-Feb-19 01:36 PM] Gam_B1t#6991
no way. How do you found this ? it seems so random to me.

[07-Feb-19 01:37 PM] cryptocat#9465
That was my first thought

[07-Feb-19 01:37 PM] Strob#3417
I thought this guy is promoting Komodo so what if the most important info for him in the article?

[07-Feb-19 01:37 PM] ch6ris#5240
I knew it was it when i went through all the sentences that started with komodo.

[07-Feb-19 01:38 PM] ch6ris#5240
It's ahead that's the point.

[07-Feb-19 01:38 PM] Strob#3417
But it could have been so many other thing and so many other way to input it.

[07-Feb-19 01:38 PM] Strob#3417
So I was very lucky to find it so fast

[07-Feb-19 01:38 PM] ch6ris#5240
no copy paste was the only way 😂

[07-Feb-19 01:39 PM] Strob#3417
And yes I just did ctrl-c, ctrl-v!

[07-Feb-19 01:39 PM] cryptocat#9465
lol

[07-Feb-19 01:39 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
some of my trials were komodo cto , all names, dex , komodo barterdex

[07-Feb-19 01:39 PM] Strob#3417
But now how to hell do we get to level 2 I converted those words in any ^possible way.

[07-Feb-19 01:40 PM] ch6ris#5240
yeah I tried  komodo barterdex first.

[07-Feb-19 01:40 PM] Strob#3417
I didn't try sha 256 (salt+ passphrase) yet though

[07-Feb-19 01:40 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
I used the middle click paste @Strob

[07-Feb-19 01:43 PM] cryptocat#9465
Let's think like the creator...What info would I use to further encrypt level 1?

[07-Feb-19 01:43 PM] cryptocat#9465
Or maybe it's another string of text we need to append to "Komodo is ahead of Decred"

[07-Feb-19 01:44 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
a random password 😂

[07-Feb-19 01:44 PM] cryptocat#9465
I'm thinking things like 1/777

[07-Feb-19 01:45 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
= 0.001287001

[07-Feb-19 01:46 PM] cryptocat#9465
hmm

[07-Feb-19 01:46 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
This is in levels. So we have to use something from level one.  Maybe the pub address or a part of the txo

[07-Feb-19 01:46 PM] cryptocat#9465
Guess where level 1 answer was?

[07-Feb-19 01:47 PM] cryptocat#9465
Within the paragraph that contained the word "level".

{Reactions}
👌 

[07-Feb-19 01:47 PM] cryptocat#9465
Maybe we look at the other paragraph containing "level"?

[07-Feb-19 01:47 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
I get you..

[07-Feb-19 01:47 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
👌

[07-Feb-19 01:47 PM] cryptocat#9465
`"Komodo is ahead of Decred in terms of DEX development, but it also takes a more integrated approach to working with larger centralized exchanges. This means while BarterDEX may offer more liquidity and choice as its partnerships come through, it isn’t a DEX that addresses issues around coin listing prices and potentially unfair advantages for high-level traders."`

[07-Feb-19 01:48 PM] ch6ris#5240
pseudorandom

[07-Feb-19 01:48 PM] cryptocat#9465
Level 1 👆🏼

[07-Feb-19 01:48 PM] cryptocat#9465
`“By doing pseudorandom order matching in epochs — say every 10-60 seconds — it puts everyone on a much more level playing field with respect to latency. The person using satellite internet in Siberia can't be taken advantage of by traders with a fiber link at the nearest interchange point, allowing buyers and sellers to transact without the opportunity for day traders to front-run their orders.”`

[07-Feb-19 01:48 PM] cryptocat#9465

[07-Feb-19 01:57 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
Sure... For now the situation is pseudorandom😛

💯 

[07-Feb-19 02:08 PM] ch6ris#5240
Indeed that is why I said it.

[07-Feb-19 02:08 PM] ch6ris#5240
anyone?

[07-Feb-19 02:09 PM] ch6ris#5240
I've tried too much now. and it's 1am

[07-Feb-19 02:16 PM] ch6ris#5240
I think Epoch might have something to do with it "a particular period of time in history or a person's life."
