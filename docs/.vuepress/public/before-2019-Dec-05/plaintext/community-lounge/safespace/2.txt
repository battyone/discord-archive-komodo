i feel so safe and happy that genie muted this channel 🤗

[09-Oct-18 11:00 AM] ch6ris#5240
muted may offend those with hearing loss and deaf

Please don't discuss that here. There are other channels.

chihuahua or muffin?

[09-Oct-18 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
this is borderline. some people might imagine eating a cute puppy by mistake and that would make them feel bad

it doesnt matter that it is not easy to never offend anyone, productivity doesnt matter here. only about making each other feel safe

[09-Oct-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
if only a puppy could have been included in that rainbow kittencorn. i think it makes the dog lovers feel left out

[09-Oct-18 11:58 AM] ch6ris#5240
I thought of that, and I am deeply apologetic to all dog lovers.

[09-Oct-18 11:58 AM] Mylo#8306
wow it is tough to make everyone happy.  i need some soma.

[09-Oct-18 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
in order to never offend anybody there are a limited number of topics, but if that is the price to keep everybody comfortable, it is well worth it
