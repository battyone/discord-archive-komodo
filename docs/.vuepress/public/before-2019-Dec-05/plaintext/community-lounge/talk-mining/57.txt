which miner is it?

[19-Oct-18 11:30 PM] MrSpice#2798
Im using claymore zcash

[19-Oct-18 11:31 PM] MrSpice#2798
Im using 3 x amd rx 580s

i bet webworker knows better than i do

[19-Oct-18 11:31 PM] 0x03#8822
i'm no gpu expert, and i havent used the claymore yet

[19-Oct-18 11:32 PM] MrSpice#2798
@webworker01is it windows based?

[19-Oct-18 11:32 PM] 0x03#8822
it should be something like `-zpool stratum+tcp://pool-address:port -zwal z-address-for-payouts`

[19-Oct-18 11:33 PM] 0x03#8822
you won't need a password

[19-Oct-18 11:33 PM] 0x03#8822
but you could put `.minername` behind the z-address

[19-Oct-18 11:33 PM] 0x03#8822
besides that, sorry, i cannot help any more on GPU

[19-Oct-18 11:33 PM] MrSpice#2798
Thanks anyways ill try that

[19-Oct-18 11:39 PM] FishyGuts#5085
For DTSM - Mine looks like :

zm --server stratum.komodo.services --port 3603 --user Komodoaddress.Gizmo --pass x --color

[19-Oct-18 11:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Replace server, port and address . rigname

Here is my experience.  I'm running two Stratum pools.  I have a working Znomp mining Komodo(KMD) perfectly.  When I switch to mining the Assetchain I created, I get an error on the miner saying: Get error: End of file, resetting in 5 seconds

[20-Oct-18 03:26 PM] hypocalese#3688
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢   I will check that out.

[20-Oct-18 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@hypocalese one of the problems with znomp is that it's written for overwinter and all the taxes that some of the other coins have, so it doesn't want to function properly with their new "updates"

[20-Oct-18 05:09 PM] hypocalese#3688
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  Got it working.  Thanks.  Still dont know root cause but If I figure it out I will let you know.

[20-Oct-18 06:15 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
If u try lmk lol

[20-Oct-18 06:15 PM] SHossain#0007
they don't list KMD or ARRR or KMDICE as mineable coin

[20-Oct-18 06:16 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
Ahh I thought equihash was equihash

[20-Oct-18 06:16 PM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 are these ^^ any better than Z9?

[20-Oct-18 06:17 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
More hash less power

[20-Oct-18 06:17 PM] SHossain#0007
more expensive

[20-Oct-18 06:17 PM] SHossain#0007
louder

[20-Oct-18 06:17 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
Touché

I have a bunch of profits in novachain and arb coin, I need some equihash ASICS

[20-Oct-18 06:24 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
All I have is gpus and some outdated ASICS

[20-Oct-18 06:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain From what I can tell the A9s use about 1/2 the watts per sol as the Z9s; I'll know for sure in a week or 2

[20-Oct-18 06:37 PM] SHossain#0007
are they overclockable?

[20-Oct-18 06:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think so, but if not the power cost more than makes up any purchase price difference
