i just added up the prior 12 solvetimes

[12-Aug-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
252 to 263

[12-Aug-19 10:00 AM] zawy#5864
Oh, sorry, I'm looking at block 330

[12-Aug-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
13, 35, 78, 6, 17, 75, 33, 17, 4, 35, 7, 6

[12-Aug-19 10:01 AM] zawy#5864
Also, the trigger is W+1 < T\*num/den

[12-Aug-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought that seemed too slow to catch the on/off miners

[12-Aug-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
W of 3 needs 4 solvtimes?

[12-Aug-19 10:03 AM] zawy#5864
Yes, that's what I thought we did

[12-Aug-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
to be in 30 seconds?

[12-Aug-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is 8x to trigger

[12-Aug-19 10:03 AM] zawy#5864
yes

[12-Aug-19 10:03 AM] zawy#5864
no

[12-Aug-19 10:04 AM] zawy#5864
it's a tricky possion effect......

[12-Aug-19 10:05 AM] zawy#5864
The hashrate of a blockchain is 2^256/avg(target) * T / (sum N solvetimes)  * (N-1)

[12-Aug-19 10:06 AM] zawy#5864
The average(1/avgSolvetime) is not the same as avgSolvetime because poisson distribution is not symmetrical

[12-Aug-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i understand i made it a bit more trigger happy, but the ave blocktime is still on track and this makes it harder to do on/off mining

[12-Aug-19 10:10 AM] zawy#5864
Yeah, it did seem a little more trigger happy.  What you have might be OK, but the thing to do is to raise the 0.5%.    330 looks like a good time to trigger, but my math is saying it's pretty sensitive

[12-Aug-19 10:12 AM] zawy#5864
So maybe the reason the last blocks are < 60 is because a W=12 window is rolling out the back of your  past setting

[12-Aug-19 10:12 AM] zawy#5864
so a short solve time gets discounted

[12-Aug-19 10:17 AM] zawy#5864
In the above eq for hashrate, our W is N-1...in other words
hashrate =  2^256/avg(target) * T / (sum W+1  solvetimes)  * W
We're checking if the Hashrate was unexpectedly high

[12-Aug-19 10:19 AM] zawy#5864
6x in W=3

[12-Aug-19 10:20 AM] zawy#5864
But the goal is not to detect 6x with 50% chance per 3 blocks, but to not trigger at > 0..5%

[12-Aug-19 10:20 AM] zawy#5864
on accident

[12-Aug-19 10:21 AM] zawy#5864
I still can't figure out how 336 and 337 were the last two in the series

[12-Aug-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
but based on how it behaves, a false positive trigger is really not any disaster

[12-Aug-19 10:59 AM] zawy#5864
Triggering on accident too often is not what concerns me, but that it's triggering under logic at the end that does not seem to be based on a weaker trigger. I wonder if it is actually using Digi Shield at that point

[12-Aug-19 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, all 0 means it is digishield (or exp() without RST)

[12-Aug-19 11:05 AM] zawy#5864
that means RST is active on 336 and 337 and I can't see why.  It could be a security risk, but in any event it seems  there is room for improvement

[12-Aug-19 12:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
The new Ryzen 9 3900X is exciting for CPU mining, if anybody is into that 😅

[12-Aug-19 12:45 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Performance reports are already available in Verus discord #cpu-hashrate channel...

[12-Aug-19 01:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 Verus is not CPU-friendly, it's controlled by FPGA's. I know, because I mine Verus with an FPGA. Also I avoid their discord. Want to give me a TLDR or screenshot ?

[12-Aug-19 01:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
I highly doubt the 3900X is competing with my Blackminer

[12-Aug-19 01:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
Monero people are wetting their pants over the new Ryzen's, RandomX miners are all flocking to them

[12-Aug-19 01:12 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Let's agree to disagree on your statement on CPU-friendliness. I'll summarize the results for you. brb

@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 i don't want to argue with you, and consider KMD discord the DMZ between me and Verus community 😃 I was building a Verus mining farm until FPGA's took over. I have been mining Verus a long time

36 MH/s for Ryzen 9, 65W TDP, let's call it 100W on the wall

[12-Aug-19 01:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have measured, and you aren't getting much less than that

[12-Aug-19 01:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`W on the wall`
👆🏽 the bits of the "argument" that matter

[12-Aug-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
FPGA is 220 MH/s is ~350W

[12-Aug-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
y'all can do math

[12-Aug-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
And Ryzen 9's right now, are 3X MSRP

[12-Aug-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
Good luck building a farm

[12-Aug-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
to mine Verus with that

[12-Aug-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
I was going to build a massive farm, but Mike decided to be an asshole to me. I have run the numbers

[12-Aug-19 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
Also, FPGAs took over Verus and all the quantum CPU marketing went out the window

[12-Aug-19 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 thank you for bringing numbers. I don't mean to attack you. Sorry if it's coming off like that

[12-Aug-19 01:22 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I agree that an FPGA is far more energy efficient. It looks like an equilibrium has been reached where FPGAs drop off Verus network in pursuit of more profitable coins. The only real victim of the new algo is the GPU (for now, nobody knows what the future will bring)

[12-Aug-19 01:22 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
FYI: I have an F1 on the Verus network too.

[12-Aug-19 01:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I agree that an FPGA is far more energy efficient.`
then every other bit is moot

[12-Aug-19 01:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
It's ok to mine a coin because you like the project. I am speaking purely as a business to make money

[12-Aug-19 01:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[12-Aug-19 01:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, it's far too small of a market size that's already far too controlled to be utilized to see any mining ROI that isn't just pure speculation and friendly support

[12-Aug-19 01:33 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I think friendly support is the proper way to desrcibe it...

[12-Aug-19 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
timber and cut lumber are similar to diamonds in that those that control the major supply lines will never want it publicly recorded

[12-Aug-19 01:38 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Yup, but every once in a while a good initiative appears that deserves (IMHO) support.

[12-Aug-19 01:38 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Otherwise every startup would be doomed from day 1

[12-Aug-19 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"on paper", LUMBER is a good idea
I just believe that "in practice" it's too much of a niche thing to recoup any major mining expense

[12-Aug-19 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
.....but, wtf do I know, I thought Bitcoin was going to die just like MySpace and passed on a group-buy of a pallet of GPUs back when they mattered 🤷🏽

[12-Aug-19 01:44 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
You've got to take a gamble every now and then...

[12-Aug-19 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my whole income is based on gambles 😛

[12-Aug-19 01:45 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
And like you, I passed on opportunities that I won't forget (at least not until 2396...)

[12-Aug-19 05:45 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c it depends on how the cumulative proof of work is calculated, ie how many easy diff blocks I have to mine to surpass pow of real chain to reorg it. 

Invalidate 7 minutes(or more) worth of blocks, you can now mine at minimum diff because local time - prev blocktime  is >7 minutes. Now mine blocks at prev blocktime+1 and you can mine a lot of consecutive blocks at min diff

[12-Aug-19 05:46 PM] Alright#0419
maybe not possible if you're competing with other miners, but if a chain was legitimately stalled for 7 minutes, you can shit out a ton of blocks I believe

[12-Aug-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
have you tried just trying to mine a lot of blocks using ASIC when diff is 3?

[12-Aug-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
after a few blocks, diff skyrockets

[12-Aug-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
best you try just normal mining to see how it works first

[12-Aug-19 05:47 PM] Alright#0419
haven't been able to get it working, thinking something in this branch changed invalidateblock's behavior somehow

[12-Aug-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
prevblocktime +1 will rapidly boost the diff to 300k

[12-Aug-19 05:47 PM] Alright#0419
why would diff skyrocket if local time - prev blocktime is still >7?

[12-Aug-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
just try it first without 51% thrown in

[12-Aug-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
sure you can get a few easy blocks

[12-Aug-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
but then it become much harder

[12-Aug-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
in the meantime the mainchain keeps going as normal

[12-Aug-19 05:49 PM] Alright#0419
maybe I'm missing something here

[12-Aug-19 05:49 PM] Alright#0419
diff *will* skyrocket if there are say 10 consecutive blocks 1 second apart(blocktime) even if local time - prev blocktime = >7 minutes?

[12-Aug-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
the 7 minutes is from blocktime, not localtime

[12-Aug-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
you can get one easy block, ok, but now the blocks are 1 second solve time. another, now two fast solves and the RST kicks in

[12-Aug-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
just try it

[12-Aug-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it sounds like you havent even tried to mine normally

[12-Aug-19 05:51 PM] Alright#0419
something is wrong with my setup, was fighting it for hours yesterday

[12-Aug-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
usually if you ASIC a digishield chain that is at CPU diff, you get a few hundred easy blocks, before diff adjusts

[12-Aug-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
with adaptivepow, you will get half a dozen, at most

shexy 

[12-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
ok what I was trying will flat out not work I think

[12-Aug-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
just try mining normally before trying to devise an attack

[12-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
would need to mine blocks prevtime +7 minutes

[12-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
and would have to invalidate many many blocks or would hit the future time rule very quickly

[12-Aug-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
again, just try to mine normally to get a feel for how it responds before trying to devise an attack
