If you mined it with anything other than CPU mining in daemon, you violated stratum protocol

[04-Dec-18 05:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`How did you mine it?`
I made a block *based on* the block template; it's a template (something that establishes or serves as a pattern), not a strict requirement

[04-Dec-18 05:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I really dont think we cna use the stratum prootcol as it exists for what KMD has added to AC PARAMS.... it just flat out isnt compatble with them.

[04-Dec-18 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it seems best to just "fork the protocol" and make it work for us

[04-Dec-18 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
everything we need is in the daemon, and the daemon knows which params it was started with ...

[04-Dec-18 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so the pool can ask the daemon anything it needs to know

[04-Dec-18 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is no reason for it to calcualte its own stuff.

[04-Dec-18 05:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it just flat out isnt compatble with them.`
Your conflating the process with attempting to do the steps of the process with a library that the kind folks at ZCL cut 90% out of

[04-Dec-18 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pool becomes an extention of the damon that allows miners to connect and shares t e be paid.

[04-Dec-18 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats all it needs to be ... anything else is pointless

[04-Dec-18 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and wasteful both of ppls time, and computer power

[04-Dec-18 05:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the only thing stopping znomp from performing any tx that can be in a cb is that znomp uses a tx builder that has 99% of the parts missing (on purpose, because it was meant for ZCL)

[04-Dec-18 05:15 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I really don't understand why you have a problem with what joker did

[04-Dec-18 05:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what if verushash forks 100x to be ASIC resistant .. .every time that happens, the legacy solution needs a new pool "plugin" using what I just proposed, nothign changes it "just works" with a daemon update

[04-Dec-18 05:16 AM] Alright#0419
he will add whatever he did to whatever you do

[04-Dec-18 05:16 AM] Alright#0419
it will be an OPTION

{Reactions}
👌 

[04-Dec-18 05:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I really don't understand why you have a problem with what joker did`
OK, you're right
I should be able to send a transparent tx on PIRATE, fek the protocol (the reciever sees that his tx was sent)

[04-Dec-18 05:17 AM] Alright#0419
stratum protocol is not the same as consensus rules

[04-Dec-18 05:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
following protocols is literally what dafuq we do

[04-Dec-18 05:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽

[04-Dec-18 05:17 AM] Alright#0419
You a big fan of slush pool? 😂  :trollface:

[04-Dec-18 05:18 AM] Alright#0419
We need our own protocol then

[04-Dec-18 05:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, I feken hate slush and the backdoor deal he struck with Core

[04-Dec-18 05:18 AM] Alright#0419
Genie loves slush pool it seems

[04-Dec-18 05:18 AM] Alright#0419
loves their protocol at least

[04-Dec-18 05:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`We need our own protocol then`
I've been feken saying that (ad nauseam) for a year now

[04-Dec-18 05:19 AM] Alright#0419
so again

[04-Dec-18 05:19 AM] Alright#0419
we're working towards the same thing here

[04-Dec-18 05:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"We need Komodo stuff for Komodo" <- you haven't seen that before? 🤔

[04-Dec-18 05:20 AM] Alright#0419
That's exactly what joker created

[04-Dec-18 05:20 AM] Alright#0419
something that will support any asset chain with a weird coinbase

[04-Dec-18 05:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`That's exactly what joker created`
**NO**
Joker created a bastardization of a bastardization of a bastardization of a bastardization of a bastardization

[04-Dec-18 05:21 AM] Alright#0419
it'll work with your non-bastardized version

[04-Dec-18 05:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
one more hacked version of znomp is **not** "Komodo stuff for Komodo", not even by the loosest of meanings

[04-Dec-18 05:22 AM] Alright#0419
ffs man

[04-Dec-18 05:22 AM] Alright#0419
it'll work with whatever flavor of nomp you choose

[04-Dec-18 05:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fek nomp

[04-Dec-18 05:22 AM] Alright#0419
what are you coding?

[04-Dec-18 05:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
2010 is over

[04-Dec-18 05:22 AM] Alright#0419
fork of nomp?

[04-Dec-18 05:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
let nomp tha fek go

[04-Dec-18 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
Should work anyway

[04-Dec-18 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
the code is *in the daemon*

[04-Dec-18 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
not the pool software

[04-Dec-18 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It doesnt need NOMP ... any pool can use it ... litterally all it does, is stop the coinbase tx from being a speerate part of the JSON in getblocktemplate and just use the blocktemplate

[04-Dec-18 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nothign else

[04-Dec-18 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its seems how it was supposed ot work in the first place

[04-Dec-18 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as the code for itwas already hinthe daemon

[04-Dec-18 05:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the stratum is in the pool software (it's also why it's a dependency of the pool and not part of it)

[04-Dec-18 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and had been disabled

[04-Dec-18 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the on;y reason my NOMP stratum needed a change

[04-Dec-18 05:24 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 imagine if getwork and stratum protocol had a baby

[04-Dec-18 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
was so that it remaineb backwards compaible with the lecgacy verison

[04-Dec-18 05:24 AM] Alright#0419
I'll leave it at that

[04-Dec-18 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that exactly what I propose

[04-Dec-18 05:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
a stratum that works with current minign software ...

[04-Dec-18 05:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`imagine if getwork and stratum protocol had a baby` it would be as ugly and bastardized as znomp is :trollface:

[04-Dec-18 05:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but also just uses the dameon for everyhting  like getwork

[04-Dec-18 05:25 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 how's your ac_script stratum working?

[04-Dec-18 05:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the daemon already does it ... why not just use it

[04-Dec-18 05:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doing it twice seems pretty stupid

[04-Dec-18 05:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
liek you liek to do exxtra work

[04-Dec-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like why code "equihashverify"

[04-Dec-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you can just `verifyhash`

[04-Dec-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as an RPC

[04-Dec-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to the daemon

[04-Dec-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then it doenst matter if it s equish, verushash, geniehash

[04-Dec-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what the fuck ever

[04-Dec-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the pool will work very time

[04-Dec-18 05:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`how's your ac_script stratum working?`
Haven't tried is since I switched libraries, but I'm confident it will work before Feb 15th

[04-Dec-18 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no matter what change has been added to komodod

[04-Dec-18 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 how's your ac_alrightmadethisparamup stratum working?

[04-Dec-18 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
it works with joker's stratum

[04-Dec-18 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless he puts the `ac_script-=` as a param in `coins.json` it cant work ever at all.

[04-Dec-18 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no matter what he says

[04-Dec-18 05:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bitcoin-js-lib cant amke a tx to script, as its job is to covert pubkey/pubkeyhash to a script.

[04-Dec-18 05:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the adding of ac_* isnt going to end ... stop makign youf life hard 😄

[04-Dec-18 05:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`how's your ac_alrightmadethisparamup stratum working?
it works with joker's stratum`
ffs, you're as thick as he is
x will work because 1=1
`bitcoin-js-lib cant amke a tx to script`
Which part of the 99 gajillion times I've said that bitcoin-js-lib is intentionally stripped out by ZCL and lacking did you not comprehend? That's why I switched libraries and will make any changes need to make a feken tx that is needed
because
"We need Komodo stuff for Komodo"

[04-Dec-18 05:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_goes back to_ 📺

[04-Dec-18 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and bitcoin-js-lib as CryptoConditions 🤷

[04-Dec-18 05:34 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 we are making "Komodo stuff". Whatever you make, we'll fork it and add it as an option.

[04-Dec-18 05:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and bitcoin-js-lib as CryptoConditions`
komodo-js-lib 
because
"We need Komodo stuff for Komodo"

[04-Dec-18 05:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well I dont deny that needs to be done ... but doing it on python would be MUCH better ... and every time there is a change in CC protocol, this lib would need ot be updated, which at this time, is kind of unmaintanable.

[04-Dec-18 05:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Give me one reason why we would *not* want a usable komodo library that js devs can use just like bitcoin js devs use bitcoinjs....

[04-Dec-18 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the code was stable  yes ... everyone wants that for GUIs

[04-Dec-18 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but you are not the person to code that

{Reactions}
🖕🏽 

[04-Dec-18 05:36 AM] Alright#0419
No reason to do it

[04-Dec-18 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and I know you wont

[04-Dec-18 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright do you think the daemon for the pool processor should ignore all txs sent to it ? like staked notaries do ?

[04-Dec-18 06:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going to work on making my Knomp be compaible with any and every algo that could ever be added to komodod out of the box. Adding poolfee to coinbase is not really required IMO ... I looked at the python impementation and its like 5 years old, and seems like its a really big job to work with, and it would be easiuer to write a new one from scratch.

[04-Dec-18 06:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So easiest solution here is to remove as many deps as possible from the node version.

[04-Dec-18 06:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
try to strip out all of its code and make it super super simple.

save it as a dependency in the package.json file.
