are you computergenie?

[20-Aug-18 12:06 PM] Kalash#2884
@marktyler suprnova is a fine pool, payouts are low for KMD however, its not profitable.

[20-Aug-18 12:33 PM] Herman#6742
@Kalash And where profitable pool komodo? i have fifty card 1080ti,and i'm  search profitable pool.

[20-Aug-18 12:36 PM] Kalash#2884
I just mean that mining KMD is not profitable right now, however with that kind of hashrate you could probably boost the number of blocks found by a large extent

LOL if you think the gaming market is where nvidia are going to make revenue out of these new chips you're sadly mistaken.

These cards are some serious game changers. Highly recommend watching the reveal vid of the Quattro: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/fWbQyaEMfbh/

@Gina Minehart 
1) stop doing the lame ass name recognition thing, all it does is lose you credibility points
2) I was specifically talking about "founders edition" cards.
3) see 1)

[20-Aug-18 10:16 PM] Gina Minehart#7038
What is number 1) exactly? You seem to be so intelligent, inform me plz.

[20-Aug-18 10:18 PM] Gina Minehart#7038
FE cards are the architecture with the blower fans. Anything from a third party is still the nvidia chips and a third party cooling solution. So you have a thing against FE blowers? Great.

[20-Aug-18 10:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1) is stop being a dickwad and using Photoshopped images to falsely represent some tie to someone you aren't, don't know, and have no affiliation with
That about clear it up for your little pea-brain?

[20-Aug-18 10:29 PM] Gina Minehart#7038

[20-Aug-18 10:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"So you have a thing against FE blowers?"
Become a real miner and you will too. 😉

[20-Aug-18 10:31 PM] Gina Minehart#7038
If that's your only gripe with them, then I agree with you.

[20-Aug-18 10:31 PM] Gina Minehart#7038
But any third party producer is using the same architecture, not to mention getting their hands on what they can when they can to slap them together 😉

[21-Aug-18 10:10 AM] rexycle#8616
is kmd asic proof?

[21-Aug-18 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[21-Aug-18 10:11 AM] rexycle#8616
i heard  its not

[21-Aug-18 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
but it also allows asic miners to mine it

[21-Aug-18 10:11 AM] rexycle#8616
😕

[21-Aug-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is immune to an ASIC 51% attack

[21-Aug-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
which means it is ASIC proof

[21-Aug-18 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
but it also allows ASIC to mine blocks

[21-Aug-18 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
I think your question was actually "will KMD weaken its security to protect GPU miners from being obsoleted by ASIC"

[21-Aug-18 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
we will offer the same protection we offered to 1060 owners when 1080 came out

@mejogeek13#8616 The spirit of Komodo is **to secure your currency**, not to secure the longevity of a specific set of hardware choices.

hmm seems he trolled and left

[21-Aug-18 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
sia's devs making their own ASIC and the mess that created shows that coin devs need to stay independent from any specific mining hardware

[21-Aug-18 10:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Having ASICs on the network is horrible for longterm security of funds, just ask any Bitcoin miner :trollface:

[21-Aug-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
using that logic GPU shouldnt be allowed either and only CPU mining should be done.

[21-Aug-18 10:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
While I do concede that it's always been the intention of equihash, betting algorithm and hardware choices on the market cost and availability of RAM is just silly

[21-Aug-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you are EOS and can make RAM cost a billion dollars

@1TheGhostProject post here please

[22-Aug-18 12:57 PM] Jackson#1309
Wait how is mining with an ASIC possible and profitable if it’s « ASIC proof »

[22-Aug-18 12:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Notary Nodes mine 75% of blocks, ao ASIC cannot get 51% of hash power

[22-Aug-18 01:00 PM] Jackson#1309
So ASICS can mine it but with only about half of their hashpower?

[22-Aug-18 01:02 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Full hash power, you’re just only able to compete for 1/4th of the blocks

[22-Aug-18 01:02 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Feel free to join my pool @Jackson http://pool.komodo.services  asic’s are welcome

[22-Aug-18 01:02 PM] xRobeSx#5136
There are a few on there now mining

[22-Aug-18 01:03 PM] Jackson#1309
Ohh so the asics are competing in their own « field » basically?

[22-Aug-18 01:05 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Somewhat. Consensus rules state NN’s will mine ~75% the rest go to external miners. So gpu/ASICS are all competing for those other 25%

[22-Aug-18 01:09 PM] Jackson#1309
Thank you!!

[22-Aug-18 01:12 PM] xRobeSx#5136
No problem

[22-Aug-18 01:37 PM] Jackson#1309
Also does anyone know the total hashrate of ASICS on KMD so I can see the competition I’d be up against or if there’s a pool for just ASICS

[22-Aug-18 01:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Nethash is currently 5.2Mhash

[22-Aug-18 01:41 PM] Jackson#1309
Thats including gpu’s I believe though

[22-Aug-18 01:41 PM] Jackson#1309
Does anyone know how much is just asics

[22-Aug-18 01:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There is no way to know I think

[22-Aug-18 01:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And they are all in the same 'pool'

[22-Aug-18 01:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
asics and gpu battle for the same remaining 25% of blocks

{Reactions}
👍 

[22-Aug-18 01:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So if you have some asics points them at kmd and take those blocks 😃

[22-Aug-18 01:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Better for the network as more hashpower makes the network more secure

[22-Aug-18 01:45 PM] Jackson#1309
Alright thanks!!

[22-Aug-18 01:46 PM] Jackson#1309
What gets the other 75% of blocks

[22-Aug-18 01:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
64 notary nodes

[22-Aug-18 01:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The notary nodes are elected each year and run for an entire year

Nice! Does anyone know if they plan to continue asic acceptance?

[22-Aug-18 02:08 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yes, asic's aren't going anywhere

[22-Aug-18 02:08 PM] xRobeSx#5136
they keep KMD even more secured

[22-Aug-18 02:08 PM] xRobeSx#5136
james has confirmed this as well

Awesome thanks! This community has been very helpful! Thank you all!

Stick around, you'll learn a lot and love KMD.

[22-Aug-18 05:50 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
Who owns the notary nodes

[22-Aug-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
different answer for each notary node

[22-Aug-18 06:01 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
Is there a better gpu than 1080 ti to mine w? Cuz I don’t get much

[22-Aug-18 06:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
When solo mining a single card it could take a while to find a block 😃

[22-Aug-18 07:37 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
Really? Didn’t know that 😂, I have more than one card and I’m n a pool. So back to my original ?, I also have AMD Cards also which is y I’m asking

[22-Aug-18 07:41 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Even with a pool, block rewards are 3 KMD, then divided up between all of the miners.

[22-Aug-18 07:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
the best way to mine KMD is via CPU, by running a notary node 😃

{Reactions}
👍 

[22-Aug-18 07:42 PM] xRobeSx#5136
So even using an asic isn't going to look like a ton, gpu's even lower 😃

[22-Aug-18 08:01 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
And only 64 of those

[22-Aug-18 08:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Actually only 30 up for election each year

if I want to add a mining pool's IP/address as a addnode, where to get that IP/address from ?

[23-Aug-18 03:42 AM] bishop#9773
ping?

[23-Aug-18 03:44 AM] Alright#0419
@grewalsatinder you can try the IP they have for a stratum, but they could have the daemon on a different machine

[23-Aug-18 03:45 AM] Alright#0419
don't think there's a simple way to find their IP otherwise

[23-Aug-18 03:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ns408 FYI mate! 👆

[23-Aug-18 03:45 AM] Alright#0419
could set up a bunch of nodes all over the world and try to find where blocks are originating from

[23-Aug-18 03:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
cool, I guess starting with stratum address and check on port connect on the p2p should be a solution

[23-Aug-18 03:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks for reply @Alright 🙂 👍

[23-Aug-18 01:06 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Dm the pool operator @grewalsatinder

[23-Aug-18 01:06 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I’m sure they’ll be happy to give you their ip

[23-Aug-18 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
