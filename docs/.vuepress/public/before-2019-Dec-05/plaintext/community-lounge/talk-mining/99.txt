FPGA's are much more power efficient, too. So if some miners are not mining because your power is too expensive, FPGA's change the numbers. The people who sell the blackminer F1 have a hosted solution where they charge 10 cents per kw/h for power and evidently it's still profitable and many people go that route

[15-Feb-19 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tnks, will definitely look into it
tbh I wrote FPGAs off for the longest time because in my mind it was like reverting back to 2010, but I've seen that some of them have come a long way

We are happy to announce that our central Infrastructure is now fully Anti-DDOS protected by Voxility.

@Jules - coinblockers.com I can show you how to prevent tx spam ddos as well if you like 😃

[16-Feb-19 11:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
From the prices I saw, it looked like it'd be cheaper to have a different server for every wallet than to pay for that 😕

[18-Feb-19 09:06 PM] jorian#4555
can anyone enlighten me why in 3 seconds, 22 transactions are mined?

because not everyone always has the "whole" mempool

[18-Feb-19 10:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Mempool isn't as sending around so well I think, I've been noticing this more and more, not sure of how its supposed to work, but it appears that txs don't really propagate once they have been sent the one time... I had to fetch them with raw tx and then resend on another node to get them to actually propagate to a node that was restarted. Dunno if this is expected behaviour or not, but its darn annoying when trying g to test mining prioritys n things.

[19-Feb-19 02:49 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r I noticed this too, seems it started around the Dec hardfork

[19-Feb-19 02:50 AM] Alright#0419
I haven't been able to pinpoint what exactly changed, but spamming transactions that spend the previous tx's outputs causes problems now

[19-Feb-19 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems possible bug with the transaction expiry maybe being too short on some txns?

[19-Feb-19 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Definatly isnt because of CC chains mempool fix that I fixed, as it does it on non CC chains aswell

[19-Feb-19 03:32 AM] Alright#0419
system clock of node may not be NTP'd

[19-Feb-19 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm... dont think htats the case, its a VM on my PC which is on ntp auto sync...  and its showing the correct time

[19-Feb-19 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
it could be the nodes broadcasting it are not NTP'd

[19-Feb-19 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
` ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: inputs already spent`

[19-Feb-19 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
or whatever dapp is creating it is bugged

[19-Feb-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
usually comes before it... It seems like some nodes are a few vblocks behind or something and trying to rebroadcast... Also I found a bug, where on node start it spams the wallet txns into the local mempool. but those are rejected.... locally so dont think its that.

[19-Feb-19 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe we need to add some extra info to those debug prints saying why they are expired... like the times etc?

[19-Feb-19 03:40 AM] Alright#0419
would probably help

[19-Feb-19 03:41 AM] Alright#0419
if you could add txid to all AcceptToMemoryPool prints, that'd be very useful

[19-Feb-19 03:41 AM] Alright#0419
although sometimes not so useful, might need full hex in some situations

[19-Feb-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can add this to labs soon in master branch. Will add as much info as I cna get. 😃

[19-Feb-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think full hex is even possible, just might take a little longer to work out how to get it into a string to print

[19-Feb-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
not a big deal

[19-Feb-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
don't bother if it's too much work

[19-Feb-19 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems like a decent thing to learn how to do... I was going to start a dual wallet staker today, but might not now. See how it goes. Will do this now though, as it seems like an actual problem. Things work, but its strange that it is happening.

[19-Feb-19 04:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol... added prints, but now its not happening. It compiles so will just push it. and leave it running locally all day.

@Ederwa do you have a log of what you pool was trying to send?
`RPC_WALLET_ERROR                = -4,  //! Unspecified problem with wallet`
so you're going to have to have some detail on your end in order for anyone to help you

And I noticed that 'notify' pushed "unexpected null pwallet in RelayWalletTransaction" on the console. What should I do?

[21-Feb-19 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that error seems to be ingorable. I have tried to work it out on many occasions. I thaught it only happens on staking nodes though?

[21-Feb-19 08:13 AM] Ederwa#9659
I don't know where is the real problem located in the Komodo core, but after restarting the coin daemon with 'rescan', I got the service back to normal

[21-Feb-19 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah it seems to do it when it loses a tx somehow, its realted to a wallet corrution problem aswell.

[21-Feb-19 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure its entirly KMD problem, but something BTC or zcash wallet related that only shows up when you ahev vast amounts of tx in the wallet DB

[21-Feb-19 09:39 AM] Ederwa#9659
got it.

Hey fellows, a (good) guy I know is asking if there is an open source miner for zcash / komodo

[22-Feb-19 08:46 PM] metaphilibert#0926
For info he's trying to fix the (re)integration of equihash in yiimp (since sapling / overwinter the blocks are rejected)

[22-Feb-19 09:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@NO_CPU iirc he said it cost too much $ for him to run it

[23-Feb-19 12:59 AM] phm87#7395
on chickenpool.com I think it is a nomp adapted for komodo, I found on github kmd-nomp (s nomp adapted for komodo) but I didn't find source of miner part (ccminer or sth else)

[23-Feb-19 01:03 AM] phm87#7395
ok I'll ask around as I'm not an expert in this

[23-Feb-19 01:05 AM] phm87#7395
before sapling (and overwinter), I think that ccminer was not able to work on kmd-nomp or z-nomp so miners can't be compared directly

[23-Feb-19 01:06 AM] phm87#7395
I had a look at the commits about sapling in kmd-nomp it doesn't seem very complicated on pool side

[23-Feb-19 01:08 AM] phm87#7395
but I don't know for miner's side : there is a miner included into komodo daemon itself, I had a look at the sapling code inside it but it is still hard to know exactly what to do into ccminer

[23-Feb-19 05:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@phm87 for CPU, the one in the daemon is pretty well your best bet

[23-Feb-19 10:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
@phm87 what are you actually trying to do?

[23-Feb-19 12:21 PM] phm87#7395
I am trying to add sapling into yiimp mining pool (on zpool) to be able to mine kmd/zcash again

[23-Feb-19 12:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
yiimp is some crazy ass C++ stratum code. I understand stratum protocol, but writing it in C++ makes me un-understand it. Maybe something to do with the fact that I maintain a Perl stratum implementation, which is used by hushwebminer. It's just a few lines of Perl to implement stratum, C++ implementation is a monstrosity to behold

[23-Feb-19 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@phm87 if you want to add sapling to yiimp, how does the miner come into play? Or are you wanting that also?

[23-Feb-19 01:20 PM] phm87#7395
I think that with sapling the miner receive the finalsaplingroothash given by stratum. But then I am not sure what calculation the miner must perform with the finalsaplingroothash

[23-Feb-19 01:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhhh

[23-Feb-19 01:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the miners do not need any change from sprout to sapling
the stratum itself need the update and the changes are small enough that the miners will not be effected

[23-Feb-19 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nothing in the algorithm changed, just the design of the block template
