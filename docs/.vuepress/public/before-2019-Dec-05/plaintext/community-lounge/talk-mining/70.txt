trying to figure out how to get the biggest bang for my buck, the order prices are jumping like crazy lately...

feel like the gunners of old, trying to hit a ship with a cannon when the gun and the target are both moving in 4 different directions at once 😃

Hi, noob mining question. Are there any one-click miners out there. I suck at trying to set miners up?

[13-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Mische#6695
they are all pretty much one-click ;D

[13-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Mische#6695
is it possible to mine pirate without having the chain snyced in agama ?

[13-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Mische#6695

mining in a pool has nothing to do with your personal wallet

are you doing KYC?

[13-Nov-18 08:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL no, I reset the db and I owe them KMD

[13-Nov-18 08:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
whats with redis ... it somehow let me start 2 instances on the same port on my second pool... Ijust mined with 1.2msol on a pool to test fee and it never paid out ... never errored nothing... just didnt add any shares ...

[13-Nov-18 08:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mined blocks just fine though

[13-Nov-18 08:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
why would it error?

[13-Nov-18 08:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I thught if it couldnt "talk" to it it would at elast complain

[13-Nov-18 08:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
instead it just did nothing

[13-Nov-18 08:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and didnt py out

[13-Nov-18 09:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if it didn't pay out, it's because you didn't tell it to pay out. redis has nothing to do with that

[13-Nov-18 09:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
redis just stores data

[13-Nov-18 09:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
redis was empty of keys

[13-Nov-18 09:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing in it

[13-Nov-18 09:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
payouts work fine on other pool

[13-Nov-18 09:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, then you didn't tell it to save data 😛

[13-Nov-18 09:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
same config file

[13-Nov-18 09:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there wsa 2 copies of redis server on the same port

[13-Nov-18 09:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
was sure that didnt work.. but it did 🤷

[13-Nov-18 09:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've ran 3 pools on same redis port, the data looks ugly, but it still works

[13-Nov-18 09:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you end you with bleedover from 1 chart to the next with different coins/algos

[13-Nov-18 09:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no lthe server started twice redis-server was running as a service and in a terminal on the same VM

[13-Nov-18 09:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with the same port

[13-Nov-18 09:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and no data saved to it

[13-Nov-18 09:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
really etrange

[13-Nov-18 09:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's a new one on me

[13-Nov-18 09:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah it relly threw me off... sitting here waiting for some kind of output for hours... nothing..

[13-Nov-18 09:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
added exact same code to other pool and worked instantly

[13-Nov-18 09:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its webs changes i merged down, it installs redis as a package instead of manyally .. didnt realise and started it twice.

[13-Nov-18 11:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I decide what to mine... ZEX DICE or ARRR!!!
AAAHHHH
So I am mining all three 😛

[13-Nov-18 11:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
"spread the hash"

[13-Nov-18 11:12 PM] ph03nix#3115
ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRR you joking 😛

[14-Nov-18 03:54 AM] FishyGuts#5085

@Paul

[15-Nov-18 02:22 PM] Paul#0981
hey thank you @CryptoNinjaa

[15-Nov-18 02:23 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
no probs just let me find the miner you need for Nvidia

[15-Nov-18 02:23 PM] Paul#0981
So you're saying I can mine 1 ARRR a day.

[15-Nov-18 02:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
1060 3gb pulls about 300 sols

[15-Nov-18 02:23 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i dont really know what a 1060 will get you but if a 1080ti get 1 a day you will get less

[15-Nov-18 02:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
Power consumption is around 100w

[15-Nov-18 02:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
You might get 330sols if you oc it

[15-Nov-18 02:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
Use ebwf miner for nvidia cards

[15-Nov-18 02:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
That's the best one

[15-Nov-18 02:24 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
@Paul  see if you can follow this guide to get setup. it is for mining komodo but the tools required are the same for mining arrr

scroll to the nvidia mining

[15-Nov-18 02:25 PM] Paul#0981
i'm afraid i'm not a hero at the pc

[15-Nov-18 02:25 PM] Paul#0981
ok nice i will try it

[15-Nov-18 02:26 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
if you have anytrouble come back to me 😃

[15-Nov-18 02:26 PM] Paul#0981
thank you guys

[15-Nov-18 02:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
You're looking at 0.95 ARRR per day with current difficulty

[15-Nov-18 02:27 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
it is handy to learn as more new coins will be coming so its worth leanring

[15-Nov-18 02:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
But that oscilates so realistically it's more like 0.7

[15-Nov-18 02:28 PM] Paul#0981
that's right, i think mining and masternodes will be more popular in the future.

[15-Nov-18 02:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
But i stand by what i said earlier

[15-Nov-18 02:28 PM] Paul#0981
same way for ARRR?

[15-Nov-18 02:29 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
the process is the same. once you learn to set up the miner its just a case of changing a pool url and port number for each coin that you want to mine

[15-Nov-18 02:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
If you want to mine arrr while the block reward is still 256, it will halve in about 3-4 months(correct if i'm wrong, don't have the data at hand) you're better off buying asics

[15-Nov-18 02:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
If you're in the us a z9mini is around $600 with no negotiation

[15-Nov-18 02:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
Look after 1st batches

[15-Nov-18 02:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
2nd and 3rd batch are crappy

[15-Nov-18 02:31 PM] Paul#0981
come from germany

[15-Nov-18 02:31 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
need to get paul familiar with running mining software first mrlynch. he is brand new to mining by the sounds of it

[15-Nov-18 02:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
Still do the job but i wouldn't pay more than $450 for 2nd & 3rd batch

[15-Nov-18 02:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
It's a lot easier with an asic

[15-Nov-18 02:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
It takes you 30 seconds to start mining

[15-Nov-18 02:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
Pop in the stratum url, wallet.worker and hit apply boom

[15-Nov-18 02:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
:))

[15-Nov-18 02:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
I've seen a few in DE at around 700 euros

[15-Nov-18 02:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
Unfortunately they're a bit more expensive in EU

[15-Nov-18 02:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
Have a look on ebay.de

[15-Nov-18 02:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
Or if you have the funds grab a innosilicon a9 - 600w consumption

[15-Nov-18 02:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
been looking for a decent price z9 mini myself. cheapest i could see was £750

[15-Nov-18 02:42 PM] Paul#0981
Thank you so much for your help.
but i would if i only want to run my new pc, just try it for fun.

[15-Nov-18 02:45 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Have you followed the guide Paul? are you stuck?
