very interesting convo guys

[08-Jan-19 09:25 PM] Arboreal#3777
was a nice bedtime read

[08-Jan-19 09:35 PM] Mink#9547
Yea a lot to learn on Equihash, the A9 and where to step in at this point

[08-Jan-19 09:35 PM] Mink#9547
Also learned about Pirate - ARRR coin hehe

[08-Jan-19 09:36 PM] Mink#9547
@Arboreal do you mine as well?

[08-Jan-19 11:48 PM] Arboreal#3777
yeah, but I do only CPU coins

[08-Jan-19 11:48 PM] Arboreal#3777
A lot of them haha

[09-Jan-19 12:01 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I've never mined a cpu coin. Do you just have a bunch of motherboards with cpus in them? Surely that'd be fairly expensive hey?

[09-Jan-19 12:04 AM] SHossain#0007
VRSC was CPU mining only

[09-Jan-19 12:04 AM] SHossain#0007
and is again

[09-Jan-19 12:06 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I know, I've not mined it :P I was more asking about how there would be "CPU farms" do they have a bunch of mostly complete computers just buzzing away with amazing CPU's?

[09-Jan-19 12:23 AM] Alright#0419
@NutellaLicka basically a bare headless motherboard

[09-Jan-19 12:23 AM] Alright#0419
duke has a decent setup for CPU mining

[09-Jan-19 12:40 AM] Mink#9547
Yea you basically run a ton of 2U racks with xeon's and go to town

[09-Jan-19 12:42 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Have any photos? Sounds interesting aha. Is the idea to maintain a cpu mineable algo all to do with maintain decentralisation because more people have access to them?

[09-Jan-19 12:44 AM] Alright#0419
I believe the only sensible option for "decentralization" is an algo with a widely available ASIC. Otherwise, once the coin has value, someone will stealth mine with FPGAs defeating the whole purpose of more people having access to mining hardware

[09-Jan-19 12:46 AM] Alright#0419
Take for example, 144,5 coins. They all lost their minds when ASICs were announced for 200,9. Now they have FPGAs on their network and no one seems to care? The FPGAs are significantly less widely available than 200,9 ASICs

[09-Jan-19 12:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I agree, anything that has a lot of options to mine it is a good thing. Evolution/technological advancements mean people are going to build things that are better and more efficient then what is currently available. So it doesn't really matter what you opt for, eventually it will be superceded

[09-Jan-19 12:49 AM] Mink#9547
So I referenced it above but a privacy project i really like that's acutally a DEX is Resistance, which utilizes Yespower script (fork of Yescrypt)

[09-Jan-19 12:49 AM] Mink#9547
They haven't launched yet but basically will work hard to being GPU / ASIC resistance @NutellaLicka

[09-Jan-19 12:50 AM] Alright#0419
anything that can be CPU mined can also be mined by FPGAs. It's just a matter of time

i KNEW you wre going to type that üòõ

[09-Jan-19 12:51 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah I don't know how much sense there is in putting a lot of time and effort into being asic resistant

[09-Jan-19 12:51 AM] Mink#9547
Don't think its' tehir main prioroity, they're a DEX so focus is on UI/GUI (which is seriously gorgesous) and one-click full privacy features

[09-Jan-19 12:51 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
VerusHash is putting a lot of effort into being temporarily  FPGA resistant. Maybe that effort could have been put elsewhere, but that is what they value I guess

[09-Jan-19 12:52 AM] Mink#9547
Yea joined their discord a bit ago to check up on it. My main thing is, what are you shooting for?

[09-Jan-19 12:52 AM] Mink#9547
Where is your revenue model? If you ahve one. Or are you more a research project?

[09-Jan-19 12:53 AM] Mink#9547
I guess its the nature of being in a space this early where it's all in the ether

[09-Jan-19 12:54 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I guess a project needs to have a solid algo before they can put work into their other products, because the blockchain is the backbone of what they're doing. So if their original algo is compromised against their values and what they stand for, they will try to fix it

[09-Jan-19 12:54 AM] Mink#9547
Right which is interesting because what algo in your opinion is *done* lol

[09-Jan-19 12:54 AM] Mink#9547
I'd say none are even near being "closed" in the general sense

[09-Jan-19 12:54 AM] Mink#9547
look at freakin' ETC

[09-Jan-19 02:35 AM] SHossain#0007

[09-Jan-19 05:59 PM] SHossain#0007
@Pool-Operator Please update your Komodo and all Komodo based pool daemon once again. There is an important mining releated bug fix. New version is 0.3.3b. 
```
cd ~/komodo
git pull
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
# you may have to run this ^^ command few times until you have it compiles
cd src
./komodod stop
# wait some time for the daemon to stop properly
./komodod &
```
Please post once your pool is updated.

[09-Jan-19 06:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
make sure you are on `beta` branch in above

[09-Jan-19 06:04 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Is it not pushed to the master branch?

[09-Jan-19 06:06 PM] SHossain#0007
pools and exchanges should use `master` branch

[09-Jan-19 06:06 PM] SHossain#0007
Notary Nodes `beta` branch

[09-Jan-19 06:06 PM] SHossain#0007
all testing goes to `dev`, `FSM` and `jl777` branch

[09-Jan-19 06:15 PM] hellcatz#5825
@SHossain ~2 hours I should have LuckPool updated to `master` branch...will post when complete...

something weird with the latest release. repeadingly giving me this:
2019-01-09 18:32:33 ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: tx inputs not found

[09-Jan-19 06:35 PM] SHossain#0007
you can ignore those @Jules - coinblockers.com

[09-Jan-19 06:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, that is a normal ignorable error

[09-Jan-19 06:54 PM] hellcatz#5825
But i wanna spend my inputs that are missing üòÇ

LuckPools daemon is updating, will be done shortly.

[09-Jan-19 06:55 PM] SHossain#0007
it is not from your node. those printouts from other nodes. they get sent over the network

[09-Jan-19 06:56 PM] SHossain#0007
i meant to say the cause of those printouts are other nodes üòõ

[09-Jan-19 06:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The reason for those prints is mempool transactions propagating out of order. There is nothing to worry about, if you let them all in, then there would be big problems. Once you receive the tx that comes before it, then your node will let it into your mempool.

im more worried about that this occurs that frequently and only at kmd.

[09-Jan-19 07:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Jules - coinblockers.com that error can happen on any BTC fork, and is normal

[09-Jan-19 07:13 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
*can*

[09-Jan-19 07:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
with everybody updating to latest KMD, maybe it's more likely

[09-Jan-19 07:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
some errors are normal. They happen.

[09-Jan-19 07:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe we need a better word, because it's really a "warning"

[09-Jan-19 07:14 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
for me its more an alert that something went wrong in the past.

[09-Jan-19 07:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a good way to tell your node is still running

[09-Jan-19 07:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's like seeing nodes go on and offline, you will constantly see "errors"

[09-Jan-19 07:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is good and normal

[09-Jan-19 07:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
tail -f debug.log lets you "drink from the firehose" of warnings/errors

[09-Jan-19 07:18 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
more a sign that the chain split often.

[09-Jan-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
out of order mempool is not chain split

[09-Jan-19 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it is that many tx are being generated that are using unconfirmed outputs

[09-Jan-19 07:19 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
the tx input?

[09-Jan-19 07:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Come and join in the cross chain stress test and see how many of those you get sending 5000 dependant txns in a few minutes :trollface:

[09-Jan-19 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe this message is suppressed

[09-Jan-19 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
in BTC

[09-Jan-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
but anytime you spend an output from your mempool, that tx might be invalid on a different node that doesnt have the first one in the mempool

[09-Jan-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it just indicates that mempool are not 100% in sync across the network

[09-Jan-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
which is not any surprise

[09-Jan-19 07:21 PM] hellcatz#5825

more transaactions there are the more it prints... just how it works

[09-Jan-19 07:22 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
for me it still is a sign that the tx fragment didn't matched with the block-height due following the wrong chain.

[09-Jan-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
you are incorrect

[09-Jan-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
while that could be a reason for it, in 99.99% of the cases it is out of order propagation of mempool dependent tx

[09-Jan-19 07:51 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
@blackjok3r and sometimes you trap into operational blindness. just because something occur in a stress test, it doesnt mean it will be right :-D
Dont get me wrong. i just seen this behavior recently at KMD which werent the case previously and we had some similarities in another coin i better dont name, so if such things pop up i better double check, since it caused infrequently orphaned miner payouts.
