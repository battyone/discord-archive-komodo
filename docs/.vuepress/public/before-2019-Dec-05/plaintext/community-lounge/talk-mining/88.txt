well thats the right number ... run that number through those commands above and he will have the correct hex value for the pool.

[14-Dec-18 08:28 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Thanks. Yeah I didn't realise KMD wouldn't output the magic

[14-Dec-18 08:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
it could easily, it's just only in a part of code for assetchains, not KMD itself

[14-Dec-18 08:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
i learned more about magic by reading code to answer your question

[14-Dec-18 08:29 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
the actual `"peerMagic":` I'm working out is  `9E2F478E`

[14-Dec-18 08:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
```printf "%x" 2387029918
8e472f9e```

[14-Dec-18 08:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
little endian vs big endian

[14-Dec-18 08:30 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yep, peerMagic uses little endian I think

[14-Dec-18 08:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
same number, different formats

[14-Dec-18 08:32 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
`[Pool]      [komodo] (Thread 1) p2p connection failed - likely incorrect p2p magic value` it doesn't like `9E2F478E` or `8e472f9e`

[14-Dec-18 08:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
try 8de4eef9

[14-Dec-18 08:34 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Nope

[14-Dec-18 08:35 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
`f9eee48d`

👍 

[14-Dec-18 08:35 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It's the little endian

[14-Dec-18 08:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
ok, `0x8de4eef9` appears as the magic in KMD source code, but for whatever reason you need to specify it in other format

[14-Dec-18 08:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
i will blame javascript

[14-Dec-18 08:39 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Where did you pull that hex from?

[14-Dec-18 08:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
```uint16_t komodo_assetport(uint32_t magic,int32_t extralen)
{
    if ( magic == 0x8de4eef9 )
        return(7770);
    else if ( extralen == 0 )
        return(8000 + (magic % 7777));
    else return(16000 + (magic % 49500));
}```

[14-Dec-18 08:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
from src/komodo_port.c

[14-Dec-18 08:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
straight from the horses mouth

[14-Dec-18 08:44 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Woh nice one

[14-Dec-18 09:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when all else fails, look at the output of running the daemon
You'll see something like:
`>>>>>>>>>> CHAIN: p2p.15586 rpc.15587 magic.e0a98e56 3769208406 999999 coins`
just flip the pairs (`e0a98e56` becomes `568ea9e0`) and you're golden

This is an interesting idea about removing pool operators as a source of centralization, and claims to enable pooled mining directly on-chain. This coin aims to only allow solo CPU mining, which is also an interesting idea: https://github.com/nithronium/pondmining/blob/master/pondmining.pdf

Two hours?

00:00 GMT start time

[14-Dec-18 11:10 PM] SHossain#0007
The daemon will start counting that time. After the timestamp the daemon will check backward for 30 blocks and it will set the activation block height in 30 blocks future.

[14-Dec-18 11:12 PM] NutellaLicka#4241

It hasnt @MetalHelmet

[15-Dec-18 07:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Assetchains now have the option to use verushash for PoW

[15-Dec-18 07:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362

hello I mined 20 pirate in the new adrees zs, is passed 2 hours but I can't see it in my agama walett
what is happening?

[15-Dec-18 04:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can't mine 20 pirate
you have submitted enough shares to earn 20 pirate when the pool you mine for pays you that 20 pirate (payout minimums and frequencies are decided by each individual pool)

did you update your pool or just the daemon?

we use snomp with sapling support

and what coin?

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 we have pirate pool at same server

[15-Dec-18 05:17 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 is any example for coin config to match sapling height?

[15-Dec-18 05:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you'll have to look through s-nomp ( know there's at least one, but I don't recall if I saw it in "official" s-nomp or a fork of it)
beyond that, have you checked free ram amt?

[15-Dec-18 05:19 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 what block sapling height of the komodo?

[15-Dec-18 05:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbh, I dunno; ironically, it's the only coin I haven't been paying attention to this week

[15-Dec-18 05:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
looks like 1140409

@Captain_Jack nothing in particular

[16-Dec-18 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
you can set the diff higher on one of the stratum ports, but it's only necessary if you want to save bandwidth

[16-Dec-18 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
so in pool_configs file, you would adjust this 
```
         "4552": {
            "tls":false,
            "diff": 40,
            "varDiff": {
                "minDiff": 1,
                "maxDiff": 1000,

hey guys, before the update I was finding blocks pretty regularly. Since I did the sapling update I am  not finding blocks.
