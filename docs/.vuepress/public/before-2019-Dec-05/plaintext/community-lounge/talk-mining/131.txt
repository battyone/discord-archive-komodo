Hello. What i need for a programm to staking kmd?

[06-Jul-19 02:07 PM] jossjana#7067
Or is the agma versus programm staking automatic the kmd? But my kmd are in the agama versus wallet.

[06-Jul-19 02:29 PM] bishop#9773
@jossjana  KMD doesn't stake.... if you are referring to the rewards, you just have to do a transaction once every 30 days, something as simple as sending your balance to yourself

Guys, does any of you have this kind of error in your KMD pool operation right after the daemon is upgraded to 0.4.0a?

[07-Jul-19 06:58 PM] Ederwa#9659
getblocktemplate call failed for daemon instance 0 with error {"code":-7,"message":"Out of memory or no available utxo for staking"}

[07-Jul-19 07:00 PM] SHossain#0007
if you state the following info, would be better for someone to help you.
what is your komodod start param and what you have in your komodo.conf file also which pool software you are using?

[07-Jul-19 07:06 PM] Ederwa#9659
I'm using Knomp and starting komodod with basic parameters and specific ports. The pool was running perfectly at the previous KMD version. Nothing changed but only the source of KMD.

oh wow that was quick

[08-Jul-19 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Ederwa  please try to update the daemon to latest source if pool has issue. This was a known bug I think, which has been fixed. 
That message is ambigious. With the fixed I submitted just after th hard fork, it will now say "Create block failed" Which still isnt great, but at least it tells you what the issue is. 
It seems that sometimes a block is built that fails `TestBlockValidity` we couldnt work out why this was happening so I changed the error handling so that it will just keep trying to make a block until it gets a valid one.

[08-Jul-19 02:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Before it would either lock up or crash the daemon.

[08-Jul-19 02:50 AM] Ederwa#9659
@blackjok3r thanks for your information. I got the code modified, recompiled the latest source, removed block and database data and tried to resync the whole blockchain 6 hours ago. The sync is still in progress now. I'll update here if the problem is gone.

[08-Jul-19 07:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks, the issue on KMD was somehting to do with FinalTx being wrong, but it seems after a while that it wil make a block without that tx in it. Still cant work out why it happens. If there is problem maybe we cna work out exactly what tx is doing it some how, that will at least help try to fix the issue properly.

[08-Jul-19 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Other option is after a block has been created that fails, remove the broken tx from mempool.

[08-Jul-19 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that will alow a block to be created right after.

[08-Jul-19 10:54 AM] Ederwa#9659
Unfortunately, I got continuous errors showing "getblocktemplate call failed for daemon instance 0 with error {"code":-1,"message":"CreateNewBlock(): create block failed"}".

[08-Jul-19 10:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What do you get when you getblocktemplate direct through cli?

[08-Jul-19 10:57 AM] Ederwa#9659
Even though I modified the code, removed all of block data and re-synced the blockchain, both KMD and ARRR pool don't work properly.

then the issue is in your pool code

[08-Jul-19 10:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if the daemon ever gives you a reply but the pool says it doesn't, then the issue is in the pool

[08-Jul-19 11:20 AM] Ederwa#9659
I updated knomp and restarted it. After a while, the same error still comes out.

[08-Jul-19 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
now subtract 2 hrs 😛

[08-Jul-19 02:06 PM] Ederwa#9659
@webworker01 It's been stuck in "Activating best chain" for two hours. I have nothing can do.

[08-Jul-19 02:09 PM] Ederwa#9659
I think so, too. Both of the KMD source and pool software were up-to-date. I have no idea what else I should do.

[08-Jul-19 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
stop mining until it is in sync

[08-Jul-19 02:27 PM] Ederwa#9659
@jl777c I didn't mine since Knomp kept throwing "create block failed". Then I stopped  pool software  and restarted daemon but the ARRR daemon was stuck in "Activating best chain".

[08-Jul-19 02:29 PM] Ederwa#9659
That's why the block height is inconsistent and I really don't know what else I can/should do.

[08-Jul-19 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wait until its finished activating best chain. pirate is very slow

[08-Jul-19 02:40 PM] Ederwa#9659
Yup, I knew. I did the first resync 18 hours ago and the height was updated at #444651. After restarting the daemon, I got nothing different but notarizations just kept going (now is at ht. 338455).

[08-Jul-19 04:51 PM] Ederwa#9659
Failed again. I started second full sync of whole blockchain of ARRR and KMD. Hope this can fix everything.

[08-Jul-19 05:06 PM] Ederwa#9659
This time, the sync of ARRR is always stuck at block #0.

the daemon isn't going to go from 444651 to 338455 to 0 on its own

[09-Jul-19 12:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah sound very strange, you are the only person reporting this

[09-Jul-19 01:53 AM] Ederwa#9659
Guys, after second full sync of ARRR blockchain, the block height is up-to-date and a new block can be mined (found). But I still got the same error "getblocktemplate call failed for daemon instance 0 with error {"code":-7,"message":"Out of memory or no available utxo for staking"}"

[09-Jul-19 01:59 AM] Ederwa#9659
By using cli command, getblocktemplate is working fine. However, this exception looks being thrown from the daemon code - mining.cpp. I'm using beta branch, but it doesn't include the fix of TestBlockValidity. Should I revise the code with the fix manually?

[09-Jul-19 02:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Really not sure man, I would need to actually check this actual machine, Im totally lost oas to what your problem is

[09-Jul-19 02:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The mining fix should be pushed, you should not be changing the code, unless you really know what your doing. Thats likely the issue here 😄

[09-Jul-19 02:51 AM] Ederwa#9659
I'm sure what I've done. The first issue and the last are the same ...about TestBlockValidity. And between two sync of full ARRR blockchain, one issue is that the sync was stuck in "Activating best chain" over 2+ hours and the other is peer connections were refused.

[09-Jul-19 02:52 AM] Ederwa#9659
I followed SHossain's recommendation, checked out the beta branch, recompiled the code and did the 3rd full sync.

[09-Jul-19 02:54 AM] Ederwa#9659
But the situation seems going back to the beginning.

[09-Jul-19 03:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know what branch the mining fix for KMD is in, but it really should not affect PRIATE in any case.

[09-Jul-19 03:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
PIRATE is just very slow. There is no reason to keep syncing chains, you are just wating time

[09-Jul-19 05:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Ederwa 
send
`setgenerate true 1
setgenerate false`
and see if that changes it

The very last $HUSH v2 (old network) has been mined, took about two months (16909 blocks) for miners to switch to our new mainnet. $ZEC would have forcibly turned nodes off, but I let miners make their own decision 😇

@blackjok3r I still got "CreateNewBlock(): create block failed" errors from both KMD and ARRR daemon. However the pools are working fine in mining now except those annoying messages. Blocks keeps being dug out. Maybe the issue will be resolved in next release. I don't know but currently I won't try any fixes in the short period of time.

[12-Jul-19 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181

or are it mainly ripoffs?

generally if a "cloud mining" site doesn't allow you to freely direct the hashrate to any pool you choose, it's a *literal* ponzi
