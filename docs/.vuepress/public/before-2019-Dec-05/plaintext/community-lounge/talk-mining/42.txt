Komodo is protected from 51% due to notaries

[18-Sep-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
analyzing things properly requires to understand that fact

[18-Sep-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
even in the worst case pool situation where a single pool has 100% of miners, that is only 25% of blocks

[18-Sep-18 11:52 AM] Resistor#1215
ok so miners receive 25% of the block reward

[18-Sep-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
no

[18-Sep-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
25% of blocks

[18-Sep-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries mine 75%

[18-Sep-18 11:52 AM] Resistor#1215
clarify i'm not familiar with kmd

[18-Sep-18 11:53 AM] Resistor#1215
wtf is notaries

[18-Sep-18 11:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😮

[18-Sep-18 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries notarized to BTC blockchain

[18-Sep-18 11:53 AM] Resistor#1215
doesn't make sense

[18-Sep-18 11:53 AM] Resistor#1215
75% notaries or founders tax?

[18-Sep-18 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries are open for anybody to become a notary

[18-Sep-18 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
not a founders tax

[18-Sep-18 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/home-whitepaper.html <- a good place for you to start @Resistor

[18-Sep-18 11:54 AM] Resistor#1215
don't have a clue wtf a notary is

[18-Sep-18 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe you should reserve making conclusions until you actually understand what is going on?

[18-Sep-18 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
instead of jumping to invalid conclusions

[18-Sep-18 11:54 AM] Resistor#1215
i'm not going to read a big whitepaper wth a bunch of shit in it.  most coins are shit anyway

[18-Sep-18 11:54 AM] Resistor#1215
it's all about mining geting paid.

[18-Sep-18 11:54 AM] Resistor#1215
no one cares about whitepapers

[18-Sep-18 11:54 AM] Resistor#1215
or use case

[18-Sep-18 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Komodo isn't a pointless mine/dump coin.... I suggest going to coinwarz.com to find you some of them

[18-Sep-18 11:56 AM] Resistor#1215
i'm asking questions. and i'm getting you should know you stupid ass answers. so that tells me everything i need to know.. project controlled chain, can't mine shit, i guess master nodes or some shit.  and 98% of the hashrate somewhere in nicehash land, and 75% of all blocks or the block reward goes to notaries..

[18-Sep-18 11:56 AM] Resistor#1215
who says anything about mining and dumping?

[18-Sep-18 11:56 AM] Resistor#1215
i'm accumulating

[18-Sep-18 11:56 AM] Resistor#1215
seems broke to me has kmd forked?

[18-Sep-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries are needed to enable cross chain

[18-Sep-18 11:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
why would you accumulate something and not give a shit about its meaning, value, and tech?

[18-Sep-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it does reduce the available blocks by 75%, but the remaning 25% work as normal

[18-Sep-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
just adjust the available blocks to calculate ROI

[18-Sep-18 11:58 AM] Resistor#1215
because there is only one alternative currency to fiat, and that's bitcoin

[18-Sep-18 11:58 AM] Resistor#1215
no one gives a flying shit about any other project or coin. the smart ones.

[18-Sep-18 11:59 AM] Resistor#1215
and in february every alt coin = dead because rest assured we're selling out to buy the 1 million flooding the market from mt gox again.

[18-Sep-18 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`because there is only one alternative currency and that's bitcoin`
If you think that BTC and KMD are the only alternatives then you're neither a miner or a person who's very informed

[18-Sep-18 11:59 AM] Resistor#1215
lmao

[18-Sep-18 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
99.99999% of altocoins are 100x better than BTC

[18-Sep-18 12:00 PM] Resistor#1215
but miners run your network.

[18-Sep-18 12:00 PM] Resistor#1215
and sell your coin

[18-Sep-18 12:00 PM] Resistor#1215
bunch of mombo jumbo

[18-Sep-18 12:01 PM] Resistor#1215
notaries

[18-Sep-18 12:01 PM] Resistor#1215
pfffft

[18-Sep-18 12:01 PM] Resistor#1215
i don't know how in the fuck kmd is so high in cmc.... fucking shit people answering questions.

[18-Sep-18 12:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I ❤ it when wannbe hobby miners try to tell me what miners do/think...
this is so cute

[18-Sep-18 12:02 PM] Resistor#1215
you know what's cute

[18-Sep-18 12:02 PM] Resistor#1215
you're fucking know it all attitude that you represent since i've asked a fucking question that you haven't answered.

[18-Sep-18 12:02 PM] Resistor#1215
so you can fuck right off..

[18-Sep-18 12:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what question has not been answered?

[18-Sep-18 12:02 PM] Resistor#1215
miners do just that keep the chain alive

[18-Sep-18 12:03 PM] Resistor#1215
i don't even want to engage your ass at this point. you're fucking retarded.

[18-Sep-18 12:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and yet, I'm the 2nd smartest person in the channel (and hint: the smartest isn't you)

[18-Sep-18 12:04 PM] Resistor#1215
i came in here with an interest to stabalize your fucking network... dipshit

[18-Sep-18 12:04 PM] Resistor#1215
now you can fuck off no wonder it's so fucked here

[18-Sep-18 12:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1) the network **is** stable
2) I'm certain that you do not posses the equipment to do a better job than the current network
3) see 2)

[18-Sep-18 12:06 PM] Resistor#1215
are you community lead or a dev or authorized to be a jack ass or something what's your deal

[18-Sep-18 12:06 PM] Resistor#1215
i never came in here and asked for your input i asked a general question

[18-Sep-18 12:06 PM] Resistor#1215
what is your issue dipshit

[18-Sep-18 12:06 PM] Resistor#1215
the mining pools are fucked right off

[18-Sep-18 12:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm the largest solo miner in the ecosystem and the resident assclown

[18-Sep-18 12:06 PM] Resistor#1215
so the chain is controlled and reading above already been attacked by  nicehash several times

[18-Sep-18 12:07 PM] Resistor#1215
i don't care

[18-Sep-18 12:07 PM] Resistor#1215
go away

[18-Sep-18 12:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you trailer park boys make me giggle

[18-Sep-18 12:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
was your trailer white and blue or white and brown?

[18-Sep-18 12:08 PM] Resistor#1215
who the fuck are you anyway i blocked your dumb ass

[18-Sep-18 12:08 PM] Resistor#1215
eat shit

[18-Sep-18 12:08 PM] Resistor#1215
anyone want to answer a fucking question is this even minable and what pool? i don't fucking solo mine. because i'm not going to fucking solo mine. i contribute to the chain by not solo mining.

[18-Sep-18 12:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You blocked me? But I love you.... 😗

[18-Sep-18 12:08 PM] Resistor#1215
and i don't know how. .so fuck that guy

[18-Sep-18 12:09 PM] Resistor#1215
it's really cool "blocked message"

[18-Sep-18 12:09 PM] Resistor#1215
i was really gonna buy some and mine some and trade, not now if this is who represents your project and your "ecosystem"

[18-Sep-18 12:09 PM] Resistor#1215
fucking dickheads.

[18-Sep-18 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LMFO @ "I don't know how to solo mine but I am important and I know what miners do and think" 🤣 😂

[18-Sep-18 12:10 PM] Resistor#1215
so if this guy has all the network hash solo mining on the "eco-system" why the fuck is he provoking potential buyers and investors?

[18-Sep-18 12:10 PM] Resistor#1215
is he really the smartest motherfucker in here.

[18-Sep-18 12:10 PM] Resistor#1215
not really

[18-Sep-18 12:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Because your welfare check isn't an "investment"?

Pool hashrate distribution, 12 mh/s are outside of pools but notary node prevent 51% of attack.
All altcoins should be notary node system

[18-Sep-18 01:00 PM] $tefano.#3560
hashrate it's balanced

[18-Sep-18 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
interesting that that only shows public pools and not "unknown" or whatever to indicate solos

[18-Sep-18 01:06 PM] $tefano.#3560
because system read info of who send theirs APIs

[18-Sep-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it also seems very balanced

[18-Sep-18 01:08 PM] $tefano.#3560
yes balanced

[18-Sep-18 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and each of the big pools is approx like 2 to 4 notary nodes

[18-Sep-18 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont see any risk exposure here, not that there really could have been due to the desing

[18-Sep-18 01:10 PM] $tefano.#3560
indeed as i said all altcoins should be notary node system

[18-Sep-18 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
smallest coins, by hashrate, with the slowest block intervals have the most to gain from KMD dpow

[18-Sep-18 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Like hush? :trollface:

[18-Sep-18 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If HUSH and ZCLwere assetcains, then I wouldn't need to run 2 pools and split my hashrate

[18-Sep-18 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_dreams big when he dreams_

[18-Sep-18 01:36 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@resistor you literally could have read the white paper, or looked at KMD website or .... literally ANY KMD resource for 5 minutes and would have not only had answers to every single question asked, but also would not have appeared to be an ignorant raging lunatic.    

Jesus man, that was hard to read.   


TLDR, KMD does not need miners to be secure.   Learn about something before you mine it.

[18-Sep-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
we certainly dont need toxic people like that in the community

[18-Sep-18 01:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 yes, very specifically, Hush. When dpow on Hush starts, selfish miners will be limited to about 4 Hush blocks before hitting a notarized block. some pools are reporting selfish-mining on Hush, maybe it's you???? If it's not, you should be happy somebody else is not stealing your blocks when dpow goes live 😃

[18-Sep-18 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto I'm far too lazy to do selfish mining

[18-Sep-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤔 although, it might cut down on my 7% HUSH orphan rate :trollface:

[18-Sep-18 02:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
selfish mining is like running a marathon to get to pull the lever once at the casino, and you have to run another marathon to pull it again. KMD notarization puts a time limit on how fast the selfish miner has to run the marathon, increases risk and hence the cost of selfish mining. Just another benefit of DPoW

[18-Sep-18 03:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbh, in the current market, I can't see how it would be cost-effective for anyone that doesn't **own** a ton of hash

[18-Sep-18 03:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
just switched tariff code to 8470.50,  hopefully it saves some on tariffs

[18-Sep-18 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`8471.50` 😉
