necessity is the monther of invention.  If you had not had such large problems, we would not have been pushed to work so hard

[07-Aug-19 05:50 PM] zawy#5864
The two equations can be reduced to 1.  That means when we make a tweak, the consequences do not have different effects in different areas.

[07-Aug-19 05:52 PM] zawy#5864
I can make it migrate to more stability.  W can be slowly increased if solvetime stays accurate

[07-Aug-19 05:53 PM] zawy#5864
then as solvetime has an error, W goes back to being small.  changing the 3 to 4 factor can be precisely determined without having to use our opinion

[07-Aug-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
found and fixed the detection of O state. was a silly off by one.

[07-Aug-19 05:54 PM] zawy#5864
so even when you;re very careful.... about those

[07-Aug-19 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
this test run should have clean data

[07-Aug-19 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, you have to be very careful and still verify each and every if statement is doing what you thought it would

[07-Aug-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why even after writing millions of lines of C code, i dont try to get it perfect the first time

[07-Aug-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
it never is

[07-Aug-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
get close and iterate is the only way

[07-Aug-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise you end up with thousands of lines of code and a bug(s) somewhere in there, but no idea where so finding it becomes a project in and of itself

yes, that's the one

[07-Aug-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i think past of 20 is too short, the diff isnt adjusting to where it needs to be and it will end up in a bad place. my time deficit based tweaks seems to be working fine, of course it probably messes up the math a bit. I calculate a factor based on the number of T the time deficit is, should be 0, 1, 2 or 3

[07-Aug-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
then if >=1 make the mindiff a bit more difficult

[07-Aug-19 06:14 PM] zawy#5864
you mean too short for digishield to take over?

[07-Aug-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
also if factor is 2 or more, to make the target 0.667, ie 50% more difficult

[07-Aug-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, 20 wont have the diff adjusted enough and digishield will need to take over and it wont trigger as it is within a factor of 2x

[07-Aug-19 06:15 PM] zawy#5864
You don't want to replace digishield?

[07-Aug-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
not today

[07-Aug-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe tomorrow

[07-Aug-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
just make it always triggered?

[07-Aug-19 06:16 PM] zawy#5864
Actually, 17 should be enough for digishield.

[07-Aug-19 06:16 PM] zawy#5864
if the adjusted targets are correct and if digishield uses them

[07-Aug-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but i think the diff adjustment is inverted for the digishield if we want it to make the effective hashrate

[07-Aug-19 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
what about if i feed the inverted ct[] into digishield

[07-Aug-19 06:18 PM] zawy#5864
digishield uses targets too

[07-Aug-19 06:18 PM] zawy#5864
I'm not following

[07-Aug-19 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, if the RST has a ctB as a target

[07-Aug-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
when tipdiff is 4, it is very hard target

[07-Aug-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
as tipdiff goes up, the target gets easier and easier

[07-Aug-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
but whenever it is solved, the average target during the block is ALWAYS harder than what was actually solved

[07-Aug-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
since the solved ctB is the easiest of that block

[07-Aug-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so to me it only makes sense to feed in higher than ctB into digishield

[07-Aug-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
the closer to 4 tipdiff is when it was solved, the closer the average target was to ctB

[07-Aug-19 06:21 PM] zawy#5864
Digishield should only get ctB[] and that test run i have should have digishield at the correct level at the end of the triggers.....let me do a calculation

[07-Aug-19 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
case in point, latest test triggered O properly, the I followed properly, but it ended up at diff of 30

[07-Aug-19 06:21 PM] zawy#5864
it appear initial blocks said hashrate needed to be 10x higher

[07-Aug-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810

[07-Aug-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
diff is only at 30, instead of 90

[07-Aug-19 06:27 PM] zawy#5864
using ctB for digi gives a target that's 27x more difficult than it should be ..... so I need to think about it

[07-Aug-19 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
but i am giving ctB to digi if RST was active

[07-Aug-19 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
i wasnt supposed to?

[07-Aug-19 06:29 PM] zawy#5864
yes, you are......I'm just trying to figuer out how to view things based on these runs....my calculation said this would have resulted in Dgigi difficulty being 27x too high, but apparently I'm doing something wrong

[07-Aug-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
let me test my idea

[07-Aug-19 06:48 PM] zawy#5864
There's a small possibility that since I used a linear function instead of a proper possion function  that the 2.72 difference I'm seeing is based on e=2.7182

[07-Aug-19 06:51 PM] zawy#5864
The poisson accicdentally has too many fast solves, so the applification of the estimated difficulty works with the RST but it's wrong adjustment for a "possion based" algorithm like digishield

[07-Aug-19 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe put a SMA of ct[] into digishield to smooth this out

[07-Aug-19 06:53 PM] zawy#5864
It needs a re-work of the RST.   A patch will be to apply  ctB/2.72 for the RST values that duigishield uses

[07-Aug-19 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i already have an alternate ct[] array and 2.72 seems like the right factor!

[07-Aug-19 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
so just divide the RST targets by 2.72 and feed that to digishield?

[07-Aug-19 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
seems so easy

[07-Aug-19 06:54 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I don’t mean to interrupt , but what do you want tweeted from the KP twitter account?

@dukeleto @radix42 @dgenr818 @JaEsf @kyuupichan @feministPLT ... jl777 & I have been working hard 7 days trying to address KMD's 1 million X hashrate attacks on microchains. We can detect & stop any attack in I think 5 blocks w/ a simple DA & keep correct solvetime.

[07-Aug-19 06:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
👍

[07-Aug-19 07:04 PM] zawy#5864
The 4 factor should probably change back to 3 after 3 blocks

[07-Aug-19 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i have a feeling this digishield adjustment will fix most of the remaining issues

[07-Aug-19 07:07 PM] zawy#5864
I guess an inverted version can replace exp()

[07-Aug-19 07:08 PM] zawy#5864
But it should not give back the lost blocks like this.  That would be tempting someone to discover a way to send it into bad oscillations.....just losing the blocks seems safer

[07-Aug-19 07:09 PM] zawy#5864
so if the triggers are removed, the inner equation is all you use for a complete DA

[07-Aug-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
exp() feels like a very good safety net and if it is active block production is slow

[07-Aug-19 07:10 PM] zawy#5864
the inner equation just keeps correct solvetime, not trying to make up for too many or too few blocks, just like a regular difficulty algorithm

[07-Aug-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
true, it basically locked onto 60 seconds per block when it was active

[07-Aug-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
but i dont let it make the target easier

[07-Aug-19 07:12 PM] zawy#5864
My TSA ran on top of a basic DA.  Actually, that TSA equation can respond 2x increase in difficulty per block (1E6 in 20)  and no adjustment to targets is needed

[07-Aug-19 07:12 PM] zawy#5864
That's probably the ultimate DA

[07-Aug-19 07:13 PM] zawy#5864
This......  
```
bnTarget = prevTarget*(T+(ST-T)*e^(ST/T) )/ST
```

[07-Aug-19 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
is ST tipdiff?

[07-Aug-19 07:15 PM] zawy#5864
yes

[07-Aug-19 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
can we use 3^x?

[07-Aug-19 07:16 PM] zawy#5864
yes

[07-Aug-19 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
how do to 3^(tipdiff/T) ?

[07-Aug-19 07:17 PM] zawy#5864
you alreayd have it don't you?

[07-Aug-19 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
some polynomial approx?

[07-Aug-19 07:17 PM] zawy#5864
it's exp silly

[07-Aug-19 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, just use the zawy_exponential

[07-Aug-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
```bnTarget = prevTarget*(T+(tipdiff-T) * zexp(tipdiff) )/tipdiff```

[07-Aug-19 07:18 PM] zawy#5864
yeah  I'll run some tests to see what the avg solvetime error will be.  There's a slight error in it for an unknown reason when we make it aggressive

[07-Aug-19 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
seems simple enough, i will make a test for it after this one

[07-Aug-19 07:19 PM] zawy#5864
mult = tipdiff/T

[07-Aug-19 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the exponential does the /T and %T combining

[07-Aug-19 07:20 PM] zawy#5864
then mult=tipdiff?

[07-Aug-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
fixed

[07-Aug-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems it is all about tipdiff!

[07-Aug-19 07:20 PM] zawy#5864
I'll run some tests on that

[07-Aug-19 07:21 PM] zawy#5864
just a sec....

[07-Aug-19 07:21 PM] zawy#5864
oh, wait, i can't because it's tipdiff

[07-Aug-19 07:21 PM] zawy#5864
But I can do the same with a 1-block delay

[07-Aug-19 07:21 PM] zawy#5864
to kind of get a feel for it.

[07-Aug-19 07:21 PM] zawy#5864
hmmmmm

[07-Aug-19 07:22 PM] zawy#5864
no, this may not work well.

[07-Aug-19 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
seems too simple

[07-Aug-19 07:22 PM] zawy#5864
prevTarget is going to change too much
