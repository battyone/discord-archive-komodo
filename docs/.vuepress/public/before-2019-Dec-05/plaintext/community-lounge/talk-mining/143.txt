the boost activates for a few seconds and then goes away as it isnt solving the boosted

[03-Aug-19 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810

I need to see difficulty and solvetime for each block to follow what's happening

[03-Aug-19 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
blocks are being solved in about 13 seconds

[03-Aug-19 09:16 PM] hellcatz#5825

[03-Aug-19 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
so a bit more time due to the 12 second delay, but the booster isnt active for long enough to be effective and/or it is too strong for the current hashrate

[03-Aug-19 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont think a single boosted diff was solved

[03-Aug-19 09:17 PM] zawy#5864
how can it not be solved?  it went past the 180?

[03-Aug-19 09:18 PM] hellcatz#5825
x4 more Z9M coming online ~60Ksol

[03-Aug-19 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
after 12 seconds the boost goes inactive

[03-Aug-19 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
and it is still at 20x more difficult

[03-Aug-19 09:19 PM] zawy#5864
oh, you have diff3 based on nTime which is not my intention

[03-Aug-19 09:19 PM] zawy#5864
it's sum last 3 solvetiems, not including current nTime

[03-Aug-19 09:19 PM] jl777c#5810
but then it wont decay

[03-Aug-19 09:20 PM] zawy#5864
tipdiff is based on nTime

[03-Aug-19 09:20 PM] jl777c#5810
aha!

this test DOA, sorry guys

[03-Aug-19 09:21 PM] SHossain#0007
@hellcatz please stop your miner

[03-Aug-19 09:21 PM] hellcatz#5825
they switching back to kmd now

[03-Aug-19 09:21 PM] SHossain#0007
i will be back after some food if you want to test ZAWY14

[03-Aug-19 09:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so you want (block4diff - tipdiff) < 0.2T ?

[03-Aug-19 09:22 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that would work much better

[03-Aug-19 09:23 PM] zawy#5864
I want sum  of -1, -2, and -3 for left side

[03-Aug-19 09:23 PM] zawy#5864
only tipdiff has nTime in it

[03-Aug-19 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be constant as block4diff and tipdiff both grow at the same rate, yes block4diff includes tiptime, block3diff subtracts out tipdiff

[03-Aug-19 09:23 PM] zawy#5864
sum of last 3 solved blocks < 0.2T

[03-Aug-19 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be time of prev block - time of block[-4]

[03-Aug-19 09:24 PM] zawy#5864
yeah

[03-Aug-19 09:28 PM] jl777c#5810
starting ZAWY14

[03-Aug-19 09:28 PM] zawy#5864
There is an equation, 1  line of code, that will do everything we want. It's something like this:  
```
currentTarget = previousTarget * 1/e * e(^(t/T)^2)
that is,   1/e * pow(e, pow(t/T, 2))
where t = nTime-previousTimestamp
```

[03-Aug-19 09:30 PM] zawy#5864
That equation does not work at all, but maybe that gives the flavor of what i'm thinking

[03-Aug-19 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
block3diff is staying constant as expected, tipdiff is increasing and it factor gradually getting to 1000

[03-Aug-19 09:31 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is working! just with 15 CPU cores, so a 15x attack

[03-Aug-19 09:31 PM] jl777c#5810
but this logic, the ASIC will find a boosted diff block!

[03-Aug-19 09:31 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe 14th time is the charm

[03-Aug-19 09:32 PM] zawy#5864
it needs another to target smaller miners

[03-Aug-19 09:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but this just might prevent the doubled coin emission

[03-Aug-19 09:35 PM] zawy#5864
one thing to be weary of is a 15x miner  forcing this trigger all the time just to mess a coin up

[03-Aug-19 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is temporary

[03-Aug-19 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
15 blocks in 4 minutes

[03-Aug-19 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
better than without, but that is 11 extra

[03-Aug-19 09:37 PM] zawy#5864
how big an increase in hashrate is it

[03-Aug-19 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
it starts at diff of 1,  i estimate will reach equilibrium at about 25 to 30

[03-Aug-19 09:37 PM] zawy#5864
oh, right, if it works, then 3 more blocks come in easy

[03-Aug-19 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
diff is 9 at height 42

[03-Aug-19 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
started at 17

[03-Aug-19 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
finally it is taking a minute on a block

[03-Aug-19 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe that is another trigger? if no blocks are taking more than T?

[03-Aug-19 09:41 PM] zawy#5864
oh no, it causes HUGE spikes on accident

[03-Aug-19 09:41 PM] jl777c#5810
only if it is solved

[03-Aug-19 09:43 PM] zawy#5864
oh right, i keep forgetting my modellign is not set up for live difficulty adjustment

[03-Aug-19 09:44 PM] zawy#5864
the computer that has that is down

[03-Aug-19 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it is working like it has to, in order for this trick to work. we just need to see more than 10x hashrate that can solve the boosted diffs to ratchet up the onchain diff that much faster

[03-Aug-19 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
are there any downsides to doing this?

[03-Aug-19 09:46 PM] jl777c#5810
the funny thing is that i think the 15x CPU cores will get more fast blocks than an ASIC

[03-Aug-19 09:49 PM] zawy#5864
if sum last 6 < 2T then 
```
 nbTarget =  nbTarget min(1000, 1000*tipdiff/180) /1000;
```

[03-Aug-19 09:50 PM] jl777c#5810
in addition to , or instead of existing booster?

[03-Aug-19 09:51 PM] zawy#5864
I guess that equation is wrong...do it same way.  In addition to

[03-Aug-19 09:52 PM] jl777c#5810
so just an additional trigger for the same code, as tipdiff is the same for both

[03-Aug-19 09:53 PM] zawy#5864
oh, ummmm, i guess do if sum 3 else if sum 6

[03-Aug-19 09:56 PM] zawy#5864
I think it  catches 3x miners 1/2 the time

[03-Aug-19 09:57 PM] zawy#5864
I didn't realize live-difficulty could do something like this.

[03-Aug-19 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
it is much easier to see the possibilities with a live chain

[03-Aug-19 09:59 PM] jl777c#5810
most people think blockchain and realtime are mutually exclusive

[03-Aug-19 09:59 PM] zawy#5864
We could stop 100,000x attacks in 5 blocks

[03-Aug-19 10:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i knew you would solve the math !

the 15x is stopped in its tracks on block 18

[03-Aug-19 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
it got a block

[03-Aug-19 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
diff is already 1.39

[03-Aug-19 10:02 PM] zawy#5864
took 18 to stop only 15x?   How long did it take to get them?

[03-Aug-19 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt start doing any DAA until block 18

[03-Aug-19 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
took no time for first 17 and then tipdiff kicks in

[03-Aug-19 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it might go the full 3 minutes without a block

[03-Aug-19 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
on 19

[03-Aug-19 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
so 1 block a bit faster than a minute

[03-Aug-19 10:04 PM] jl777c#5810
amazing

[03-Aug-19 10:04 PM] jl777c#5810
after 3 min tipdiff turned off

[03-Aug-19 10:04 PM] jl777c#5810
it got 3 fast blocks

[03-Aug-19 10:04 PM] jl777c#5810
now at ht 23
