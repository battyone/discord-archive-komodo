How do I get started mining? Asic vs gpu  or should I rent? where to rent for specific coins? anyone have a link?

[18-Nov-18 02:21 AM] Hermes#6934
For Komodo assetchains Asic will get you a better performance.  People are using nicehash.com and also miningrigrentals.com the configuration for each coin is different because are running in different IPS.

[18-Nov-18 03:01 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
` or should I rent? ` If you ever have to ask that question, the answer is "no". Only rent when you know why you're renting, you've done the math, and you know that it's your best option.

[18-Nov-18 06:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
Does anybody know BIOS tricks to get a MB to boot headless (without a GPU)? Specifically this MB: https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/B450M-PRO-M2/Specification

[18-Nov-18 06:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have a very similar ASUS MB to that, which I can remove the only graphics card, and it boots just fine (this is a CPU mining rig)

[18-Nov-18 06:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, on a scale from 1 to 10, how bad is it to remove a GPU from a running MB? Asking for a friend

[18-Nov-18 07:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I don't want to sound stupid but it has onboard graphics no?  The HDMI port would indicate it should be able to fire up.

[18-Nov-18 07:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I would tell your friend NOT to remove the graphics card from a running MB... as a standard of good practice.  

Can he/she?  Sure.   
Will problems arise?   I don't know, you'd have to google that.

[18-Nov-18 07:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts i want this miner to boot up, regardless of a video card being attached

some MBs + CPUs work just fine. Rip out GPU, restart, good to go.

Dust is but a measurement gauge of how often I need to clean my rigs üòõ

[18-Nov-18 07:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
Others, they get stuck at boot. Like they are waiting for a keypress or something. it's a common problem I am seeing on forums

[18-Nov-18 07:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
those "headless" display things above, trick the bios into thinking there is a GPU attached

[18-Nov-18 07:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I guess my point being, with an HDMI port like that, there's got to be a setting for booting from onboard graphics.  Perhaps its through disabling the PCIE slots

[18-Nov-18 07:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
fucking BIOS'es are too smart

[18-Nov-18 07:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And if they are disabled, they'll boot from onboard or processor.

[18-Nov-18 07:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts you would think so, but most MB's only support intel onboard graphics

[18-Nov-18 07:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
..... good point.

[18-Nov-18 07:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't want any graphics

[18-Nov-18 07:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
i just want it to fucking boot

[18-Nov-18 07:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Well, for 8.50 and something you can have tomorrow... they emulator seems a good solution.

[18-Nov-18 07:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
what would @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ do, tho?

[18-Nov-18 07:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085

_uses these in his rigs:_ https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XSY9THQ (or you can use an old HDMI cable and solder in a diode and make your own)

[18-Nov-18 08:45 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
P.S. they don't "trick the bios into thinking there is a GPU attached", they plug into GPU0 and "trick the bios into thinking there is a __monitor__ attached"

[18-Nov-18 10:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ so I am trying to understand why some MB's will allow booting with no GPU installed, some don't, and what that is called. I seem to get the BIOS post, and fan LEDs come on, but it gets stuck on the bios when no GPU is installed. Put a GPU in, it will boot just fine, regardless of monitor being attached, such that I can ssh in

[18-Nov-18 10:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
with this MB and a ryzen 2700X, you can remove the GPU and it boots just fine: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FKV5HWJ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

[18-Nov-18 10:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
my end goal is not not have any graphics card installed at all, so these hdmi "fakers" are not really what I am looking for, unless I can plug them directly into the MB HDMI slot to get it to boot

[18-Nov-18 10:41 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@dukeleto it's not a "setting" change when you use a CPU that has "onboard" graphics
Every system has to have *something*, that board uses:
`Graphic
Integrated in the AMD Ryzen‚Ñ¢ with Radeon‚Ñ¢ Vega Graphics Processors `
It's in the CPU and that board supports it

[18-Nov-18 10:56 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I'm not quite sure what you think you're after (or at least as you explain it) is even a thing

[18-Nov-18 11:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ what I am after, is a rig that will boot with no graphics card at all, and be a CPU miner, with ssh access. I have accomplished that with the ASUS MB, and thought I could do the same with this "better" MSI board

[18-Nov-18 11:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
I use a GPU to install/setup the rig, then turn off, remove GPU, restart and then maintain via ssh

[18-Nov-18 11:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
Ubuntu 18.04 . Works fine, if the BIOS lets you do it. I didn't think integrated graphics mattered if I am not trying to use any graphics

[18-Nov-18 11:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am using Ryzen 2700's (X and not)

[18-Nov-18 11:07 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`what I am after, is a rig that will boot with no graphics card at all, and be a CPU miner`
Then you need:
a) a CPU with integrated graphics
or
b) a motherboard with integrated graphics

[18-Nov-18 11:09 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
```
AMD Ryzen‚Ñ¢ 7 2700X Processor
Graphics Model:
    Discrete Graphics Card Required

AMD Ryzen‚Ñ¢ 7 2700 Processor
Graphics Model:
    Discrete Graphics Card Required```

[18-Nov-18 11:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
the MB + CPU also need to be compatible, it seems

[18-Nov-18 11:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, they don't have integrated graphics

[18-Nov-18 11:10 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
so then you need b)

[18-Nov-18 11:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
what I don't understand, is why https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FKV5HWJ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 works but not https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/B450M-PRO-M2/Specification

[18-Nov-18 11:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am missing the feature difference that allows the ASUS to boot with no GPU but the MSI won't. Perhaps a bios update would change something

[18-Nov-18 11:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
the 450 is supposedly a superior MB to the 350, more compatible with 2nd gen Ryzen's/etc

[18-Nov-18 11:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
but maybe not

[18-Nov-18 11:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
i see `Integrated in the AMD Ryzen‚Ñ¢ with Radeon‚Ñ¢ Vega Graphics Processors ` for the ASUS but not in the MSI details. Lame

[18-Nov-18 11:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
doesn't help that everything about MB's + CPUs is written in broken english

[18-Nov-18 11:16 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
the MSI doesn't work if you plug a monitor into it?

[18-Nov-18 11:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
everything works if a graphics card is plugged into a PCIe slot

[18-Nov-18 11:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
what I want is to have many many rigs, and only a few GPUs for maintenance/etc. I don't want to have 1 GPU per rig

[18-Nov-18 11:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
it seems to POST the BIOS without a graphics card, but gets stuck in bios-land

[18-Nov-18 11:17 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
If you plug a monitor into the onboard slot of the MSI, does it work?

[18-Nov-18 11:17 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
not asking about a GPU...

[18-Nov-18 11:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
i can try that, any hack is better than nothing, since I just bought a few of these MB's

[18-Nov-18 11:18 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
if it works with a monitor plugged in, then get a dongle

[18-Nov-18 11:29 PM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto safest way to remove a GPU from a running machine would be a riser I imagine

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  to get it work u need to boot the system with a monitor and after the system is in desktop you can remove the monitor & u begin ur ssh mining

[19-Nov-18 08:26 AM] gigoplast#5562
U need a monitor for the booting system after u can remove completly

[19-Nov-18 08:27 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@gigoplast that's what the dongle is for, to avoid that; what he was asking about was trying with no graphics support *at all*
