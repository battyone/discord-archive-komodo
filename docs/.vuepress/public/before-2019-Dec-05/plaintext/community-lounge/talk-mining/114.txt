Hi, I noticed there is a Hush3 repo on Github now. Should pools be using that daemon now for Hush, or is it still ok to be running the 2.0 hushd daemon ?

@dukeleto 👆🏽

[03-Apr-19 04:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@newvulcan hush3 is not live yet, still tweaking chain params. Pools should stay on v2 until block 500,000

[03-Apr-19 04:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, if you use the latest dev branch, you can do `hushd -stopat=500000` to ensure your node stops at the snapshot height, if you want. I ported that from KMD

[03-Apr-19 04:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can still do RPC commands, at that block height

Z11 back for sale

at another $200 markup 😦

Innosilicon lowered its btc payment , last day right now of the preorder, price will probably go up

[04-Apr-19 09:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, lowering btc is kinda obvious with price up, but bm has increased the US price on each batch

[04-Apr-19 09:23 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Historically innosilicon has not been on top of updating btc to reflect usd price

[04-Apr-19 09:23 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
So kinda nice

I found this funny pic on another discord, sorry if it has already been posted

@SHossain Is that yours? :troll_hardcore:

[04-Apr-19 10:07 PM] SHossain#0007
looks beautiful, but no 😃

That's some serious cooling.   I should try that.

either someone scanning mempool with a good amount of hash they can switch instantly or someone who knows they will be happening ahead of time

[05-Apr-19 09:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
it could be that a company cannot legally/financially deal with those interest rewards, so it tips off an employee to "take care of them", or maybe an employee is just benefiting from inside knowledge

[05-Apr-19 09:54 AM] Alright#0419
yes, what I'm guessing

[05-Apr-19 09:55 AM] Alright#0419

Anyone have a Blackminer for sale or trade?

[05-Apr-19 05:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog nope, but I like mine, bought it new. Not many used ones for sale

[05-Apr-19 05:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog are you on the HAC discord?

[05-Apr-19 05:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is where you would find any, I don't think they make it to Ebay

[05-Apr-19 05:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Actually just found one on eBay lol

[05-Apr-19 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
awesome! I haven't seen any, but the F1+ made some people sell their F1's

[05-Apr-19 05:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog are you going to mine VBK like a boss?

[05-Apr-19 05:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
get that sweeeeeeeeet tech

[05-Apr-19 05:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
I OC my F1 a bit and it makes me happy

[05-Apr-19 05:31 PM] dukeleto#7326

Lol and Verus ,  it has Verus hash2 right?

[05-Apr-19 05:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
VRSC only uses 200W iirc

[05-Apr-19 05:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
i mine VRSC with mine, for a while

[05-Apr-19 05:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
What algo is VBK

[05-Apr-19 05:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
not even sure

[05-Apr-19 05:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
I never even looked into loading that bitstream, not sure if it's only for hosted blackminers

[05-Apr-19 05:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
they give out bitstreams to hosted miners first

[05-Apr-19 05:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ah, it will eventually make its way to the wild

[05-Apr-19 05:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
it took them about a month to react to Mike having his "coming of age" moment of realizing he couldn't prevent FPGA's from mining VRSC

[05-Apr-19 05:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
they secretly mined at first

[05-Apr-19 05:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
then VRSC forked

[05-Apr-19 05:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
then HAC got a new bitstream in a few weeks

[05-Apr-19 05:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
and VRSC realized the cat and mouse game was not theirs to win

[05-Apr-19 05:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
VRSC did make their move, and made the ratios of CPU to GPU to FPGA miner something "more reasonable" than when FPGAs secretly mined

[05-Apr-19 05:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
but FPGA mining VRSC blows away CPU mining, still. If you are doing it for profit, as a business, it makes no sense to mine VRSC with a CPU. If you are just mining for fun or hobby, then you can still make a few pennies a day with a fancy CPU

[05-Apr-19 05:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
I will say that I do build CPU mining rigs, and you expect those to be able to mine various coins, so their lifecycle of use is different than ASICs or FPGAs

[05-Apr-19 05:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's smarter to mine Monero forks with CPU rigs, which aggressively go against GPUs and FPGAs

[05-Apr-19 05:39 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I’m glad the monero crowd keeps forking,   Bitmain and others won’t put out another cryptonote miner because of it

[05-Apr-19 05:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
There are coins which are solo mining only CPU only, multiple ones

[05-Apr-19 05:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
they see pools as evil

[05-Apr-19 05:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
and constantly change their PoW so that a "middle of the road" decent CPU has a reasonable chance to find a block per week, something like that

[05-Apr-19 05:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's an interesting and different world. Refreshing, after seeing to many coins doing exactly the same fucking things

[05-Apr-19 06:57 PM] kremer#4440
anyone interested in buying a new, unopened zotac gtx 1070 mini 8gb for crypto?

[05-Apr-19 06:58 PM] kremer#4440
dm if interested

[05-Apr-19 07:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@kremer I'll give you 15KMD for it

[07-Apr-19 06:09 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Was looking at network hashrate for equihash coins across the board, seems like a massive drop lately. Zec down a gigahash .  Zen down like 30%, pirate down a bit and not too much on nicehash .Just let’s you know how many of those new machines were running beforehand

[08-Apr-19 04:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Z11s back up for an hour then sold out lol

[08-Apr-19 04:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL @ S17 "coming soon" and price "tbd"

[08-Apr-19 04:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
aka "$975 + whatever it costs us to clean them and make them look  new again"

[08-Apr-19 04:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You think they will have a Z17 eventually?

[08-Apr-19 04:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
round about 2022 😛

[08-Apr-19 04:59 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
That would be ideal lol.  Hopefully the Z11 last longer than the Z9s .  I did well with them but luck definitely had it’s part, early pirate mining and zex mining

[08-Apr-19 04:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Hopefully the Z11 last longer than the Z9s .`
I've not had a problem with a single one of them 😕

[08-Apr-19 05:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not any problems with them, just profitability going to tank here soon.

[08-Apr-19 05:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh, by "last" I thought you meant die rate 😛

[08-Apr-19 05:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Oh no no, they are beasts haven’t had an issue yet and they’ve been running since October straight

[08-Apr-19 05:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
My friends have had issues with their minis

[08-Apr-19 05:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm still banging out a couple hundred $ a day, so even if the 11s cut that in half I'm alright 😄

[08-Apr-19 05:03 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
How many Msol you have?

[08-Apr-19 05:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
personal, I don't even have 1M 😛

[08-Apr-19 05:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
How are you doing a couple hundred a day?

[08-Apr-19 05:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's all in where you point them and what you do with it

[08-Apr-19 05:07 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lol well you gotta drop me some hints, only getting like 130 at 1Msol ,  I’m mining zec so that had a huge part of it but still even mining pirate is only like 150 , not a couple hundred. Mind you that profit not the total .

[08-Apr-19 05:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
solo mining, automated profit-switching, and auto dumpers are a miner's best friends

[08-Apr-19 05:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and never, never, never mine "the big coin" in the algo

[08-Apr-19 05:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when I was sha mining, I made 1.4-3x mining other coins and dumping them for BTC than I'd have ever made actually mining BTC

[08-Apr-19 05:16 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I just switched it over to get a bag of zec before hashrate shoots back up, once I have a couple hundred I’m done with it.    Then it’s back to pirate til the halving . Probably even after the halving.

[08-Apr-19 05:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when I use it, my switcher looks at current block diff and moving average of price carried out to moving average of BTC, literally whatever is the most profitable for that 9 minute window

[08-Apr-19 05:23 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I got to do some research never messed with profit switching.

[08-Apr-19 05:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, it's well worth the time investment to do it in a purely for-profit situation

[08-Apr-19 05:22 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
If you're going to dump the coins and buy w/e coin you like most, that's the best way of mining

[08-Apr-19 05:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
My FPGA profits of VRSC are way up because everybody is mining VBK I guess. So nice to have a network with very few other FPGAs mining 👼

[08-Apr-19 06:43 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Damn, A9++ back up for sale, 300 dollars more 😦 ,  looks like the rest will be z11 then

[09-Apr-19 09:21 AM] jansako#3330
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 if what you do with your miners is scalable, would it be worth for you to offer it as a service (via a public pool or something) & make (more) profit via the pool fee? Kinda like zpool does with their 'ninja' coins, except with them it mostly does not work for me (I am sure it is just my luck).

[09-Apr-19 09:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jansako I'm not sure what you mean. What you're suggesting reads like something akin to Genesis Mining (a model I have been advocating for years that people *not* use)

[09-Apr-19 10:08 AM] jansako#3330
You are doing magic with your own hashpower. If the 'magic' is scalable, have others point their hashpower to you & take a fee off the top. You would probably want actual miners, not NH in order to get stable hash...

[09-Apr-19 10:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
math is not "magic"

[09-Apr-19 10:09 AM] jansako#3330
it is for some...

[09-Apr-19 10:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL

[09-Apr-19 10:10 AM] jansako#3330
more like.. is it worth for me to do all that work when I have 1-2 Z9 minis? Probably not, but I can pay you for letting me make more money & point them to your 'pool' (for lack of a better word)

[09-Apr-19 10:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and on the weeks where I make a bad call and the 'pool' takes a 20% loss?

[09-Apr-19 10:11 AM] jansako#3330
If it is not scalable, then obviously it won;t work
