after mine 17 blocks with second hash 0, you also need to keep mining until the hashrate is stable

[08-Aug-19 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i have seen that post-RST having some undesirable behavior, like triggerting another RST or exp(). ideally it stays quiet and the diff quickly gets to where the hashrate indicates it should be.

[08-Aug-19 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
once there are 17 blocks that are stable hashrate (diff and miningdiff would be very close), diff for past 17 blocks reasonably close, but randomness can create some variance

[08-Aug-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is a judgement call whether the diff is stable and reflecting the hashrate

[08-Aug-19 04:21 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. adding that up in my note.

[08-Aug-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
reaching this state of stability is something that is needed at various times

[08-Aug-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
basically from the moment to change the hashrate to when it reaches stability, that is really what this is all about

[08-Aug-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
and we want that to be in as few blocks as possible, but we cant tell for sure until after the fact that it was indeed reached stability

[08-Aug-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so it might take 20 extra blocks to realize it was actually stable 20 blocks ago

[08-Aug-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
ideally we want to reach this hashrate/diff stability before changing the hashrate

[08-Aug-19 04:23 PM] SHossain#0007
it would be great if you can monitor ZAWY20 just by running it.

[08-Aug-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
but sometimes it might end up just going in circles of not being stable. ping me if that happens. yes i will monitor

[08-Aug-19 04:25 PM] zawy#5864
You need to do 10 * attacks several times to see what is going to happen after RST stops. Mainly to see if Digi Shield does not need a correction to the nBits

[08-Aug-19 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810
wait for diff to stabilize in between, or just do 10x, wait for hashrate to drop 90% and do 10x again?

[08-Aug-19 04:27 PM] zawy#5864
Wait for Digi Shield to stabilize

[08-Aug-19 04:28 PM] zawy#5864
Ideally you won't did you Shield soft X to be exactly correct as soon as rst finishes

[08-Aug-19 04:28 PM] SHossain#0007
starting to mine ZAWY20 with 50 threads

[08-Aug-19 04:28 PM] zawy#5864
The above is voice recognition errors

[08-Aug-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain does this make sense? do a 10x, reduce back to 1x, wait for stable diff, then 10x, reduce back to 1x, repeat. basically try to confuse the DAA

[08-Aug-19 04:28 PM] zawy#5864
It should be fun what that sentence that starts with the ideally is saying

[08-Aug-19 04:29 PM] SHossain#0007
yep. it does.

[08-Aug-19 04:29 PM] SHossain#0007
then, how about 2x, 3x and 5x?

[08-Aug-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if 1x is 3 cores, it is 3 cores, 30 cores, 3 cores, 30 cores, ...

[08-Aug-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
i think this 10x on/off test is more important

[08-Aug-19 04:29 PM] zawy#5864
Yes that is a good attack, but I would like to see if Digi Shield is getting the right difficulties from rst. You will not know that unless Digi Shield difficulty is immediately correct after rst and does not change assuming you do not change the hashrate

[08-Aug-19 04:30 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. i'll reduct 2,3,5 and use 1x & 10x

[08-Aug-19 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the last test showed it was pretty close to digishield diff

[08-Aug-19 04:30 PM] zawy#5864
But I am supposed to be working on the modeling and not getting into your tests

[08-Aug-19 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
but the past window was too short due to a bug and exp() too hyperactive

[08-Aug-19 04:30 PM] SHossain#0007
so, i can start with 30 threads, then back to 3, wait till stable, then increase to 30 again

[08-Aug-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
just wanted to know the tests that will give us the most useful data

[08-Aug-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
30x back to 3x, 30 back to 3

[08-Aug-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
we want a 10x test, not 30x

[08-Aug-19 04:31 PM] SHossain#0007
oppsss. yes

[08-Aug-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
let me know when you think it is stable, and i will confirm

[08-Aug-19 04:32 PM] zawy#5864
It's not a bad idea for us to diverge right now to see what we can dream up and then compare results at the end. But as soon as I have a testing program that you can use I'll send it to you.

[08-Aug-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[08-Aug-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
i need to see the actual attack we need to defend against, then i am pretty sure i can devise some sort of special defense for it

[08-Aug-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so many DAA tools in the toolkit now

[08-Aug-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810

[08-Aug-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
you see the deficit prints?

[08-Aug-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
there are three RST, RST.3, RST.6 and RST.12, each has a different deficit it is trying to make up

[08-Aug-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
each block < 60 seconds the deficit goes up, above 60 seconds it goes down

[08-Aug-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
RST.3 has 20 blocks to run, RST.6 has 30 blocks and RST.12 has 40 blocks before it expires

[08-Aug-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
of course if the deficit is completely wiped out, it stops

[08-Aug-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
though in rare cases, like a zombie it can come back to life, but i wouldnt expect that to happen regularly

pretty easy to see when the RST kicked in

[08-Aug-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
deficit 217

[08-Aug-19 04:47 PM] SHossain#0007
yep, stdout is prting that since block 65

[08-Aug-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
you can see it is printing a hash that is gradually getting bigger

[08-Aug-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the ever changing new target

[08-Aug-19 04:47 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[08-Aug-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i know why there are a seemingly disproportionate number of fast solves for high diffs!

[08-Aug-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
that is because all fast solves have much higher diffs

[08-Aug-19 04:50 PM] SHossain#0007

[08-Aug-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is just a matter of the probability of a fast solve and if it happens, it has to be a high diff

[08-Aug-19 05:02 PM] SHossain#0007
almost halfway through until 0 hash

[08-Aug-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810

[08-Aug-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
usually the smaller RST make up their deficit any go away before 40 anyway, like now, only RST.12 is alive

[08-Aug-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810

[08-Aug-19 05:21 PM] zawy#5864
To get really fancy, make it a DAG.  Make max block size 1/6 as big and allow each block to reference 6 parent blocks and make solve time 10 seconds.  Your mempool needs to place a 1 or 2 minute hold on txns before miners randomly choose them so that they don't choose the same txns too often.   Since you now have 6 blocks per minute  you can adjust difficulty 6x faster, or have it SQRT(6) more stable. Double-spending solution for DAGs that I came up with is that 1st txn (the valid one) is the one with the most decendant work, not the one with the most ancestor work.  Someone should do a patent on that.  There is a no-incest aka no triagles rule in the connections. I think that means primarily  parents of the same block can have the each other as a parent.  to get even more fancy, each miner chooses his own target but the amount of coin he gets is determined by the DA.  The DA erward is per hash instead of per block.  So no need for pools.  Then you use VDF-POS to make it constant value and not need a bunch of mining equipment to be secure, but only use POW for generating and distribution coin with the above self-hashing txns.  Then put a bunch of these coins under the KMD umbrella so that merchannts only need to communicate with KMD, so all the sub coins are shards.  20 seconds txns, unlimited txns, no wasted minning for consensus, constant value, secured by BTC.

[08-Aug-19 05:22 PM] zawy#5864
But with VDF-POS you don't need such a fast DA.  But you do need the DAG to prove the VDF-POS network was intact.

[08-Aug-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
that sounds cool, but it would take more than a few weeks to do

[08-Aug-19 05:22 PM] zawy#5864
So that you get the fast confirmations

[08-Aug-19 05:23 PM] zawy#5864
lol.....yeah, I suppose a year with 3 people like you and 2 people like me but a little smarter

[08-Aug-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
i toyed with a way to basically build the mining pool into the blockchain, this is a better way

[08-Aug-19 05:24 PM] SHossain#0007
2nd hash is now 0

[08-Aug-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810

109:89

[08-Aug-19 05:27 PM] zawy#5864
But I supposed the coin providing the umbrella would need to charge txn fees to get locked on BTC.  The sub-coins (shards) are inherently not supposed to reward the VDF-stakers that secure consensus.

[08-Aug-19 05:28 PM] zawy#5864
Anyway, you now have the idea and can implement it if you have time.   My work  on difficulty is just a way to  advertise this more important idea. I don't consider difficulty important because it's POW for consensus

maybe i can find time later this year.

[08-Aug-19 05:29 PM] zawy#5864
But understanding    difficulty     perfectly was necessary to understand how to do VDF-POs and DAG correctly....so difficulty is still central to them

[08-Aug-19 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
do you have any more writings on it?
