piratepool seems to be stuck on confirming block 61217.  does anybody know whats up?

[09-Nov-18 07:50 PM] tahoeminer#4362
378 blocks pending for about 4 hours now

Piratepool looks like another thieving mining pool.

OK, so you didn't get paid your 14 cents during some hours and that means the pool op is a thief? @Ragnar

[09-Nov-18 09:36 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉  
I have an idea, and I wonder if its possible, or why stratums work the way they do... 
Is not a pool only required to calcualte a PoW? So why does a stratum build blocks ? It seems to do things, like mine a % of block rewards to CC contacts, and such that what we want a pool to do... is calcualte the PoW solution and submit it tothe daemon... and let the built in miner code do everything else. 
It seems that 99% of pool issues disapear if we simply dont  let the stratum build the block.

Stratum mining protocol

[10-Nov-18 04:11 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`So why does a stratum build blocks ?` Because Core and slush belong to the same circlejerk

[10-Nov-18 04:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So if getwork was brought back, how hard woruld it be to make a pool work with it ?

[10-Nov-18 04:14 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
if getwork was brought back, you wouldn't need a pool

[10-Nov-18 04:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok ... how do you get all the miner softwares to work with it then?

[10-Nov-18 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont see getwork being that hard to put back ... but making stuff work with it might be the problem

[10-Nov-18 04:15 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
getwork                   = wallet tells miner what to do
getblocktemplate = wallet tells pool what to do, pool tells miner what to do

[10-Nov-18 04:16 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
oversimplified, of course

[10-Nov-18 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So if getwork was avalible, could YOU use it to mine blocks ?

[10-Nov-18 04:18 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
we'd have to dig out some old 2010-2011 BTC versions of cgminer and ASICs would need custom cgminer too, but it's possible given enough time I could, yes

could a stratum proxy be used instead of custom fw for ASICs

[10-Nov-18 04:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
some people reverse engineers the mods, since cgminer is GPL and should not have been used/abused by bitmain

just get the pow and submit it to hte daemon

[10-Nov-18 04:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe its not exactly the same as getwork ... but simliar ... we want to make it work with existing stuff if we can ...

[10-Nov-18 04:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
didnt think it would be much code at all ... getwork seems a far simpler solution than getblocktemplate

cool as .. .jame went and did my next task earlier so Im looking for something eles ... I was going to do this a diffrent way, but after thingking about it ... just having getwork back and miner software that works with it, solves all problems with the least amount of work... assuming its not super hard to port back in

[10-Nov-18 04:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 mostly it was adding all the `--bitmain-*` cli args, but i didn't look to close

[10-Nov-18 04:24 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
getwork, itself, is before my time, so I'm more familiar with the political histrionics than the actual usage and code

[10-Nov-18 04:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im going to have a look at it and see... theres a problem I need to solve down the line, that seems FAR easier to solve, if a BR can make CC trasnactions.

[10-Nov-18 04:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r i think various code you have done recently was much harder than adding in getwork rpc back in

if a straum is building the block... that seems basically impossible to do...

[10-Nov-18 04:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't know about 3rd party libs/software tho, what it would take to make them use getwork

[10-Nov-18 04:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am thinking that a statrum could be modified to use it

[10-Nov-18 04:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
99% of it stays the same ... instead of using submitblock, it just submits the PoW it found.

[10-Nov-18 04:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
it sounds good to have a different option than stratum, There Is More Than One Way To Do It (TIMTOWDI) is a mantra in the Perl world, it seems that BTC would prefer always to have One True Way

[10-Nov-18 04:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
Core is the One True Bitcoin, etc...

[10-Nov-18 04:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
using a stratum and on;y a stratum stops too many things being possible

[10-Nov-18 04:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181

doubt there are any equihash miners for it

[10-Nov-18 04:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems FAR eaier to me to have the daemon build the block, and the pool provide the PoW

[10-Nov-18 04:30 PM] Alright#0419
well the daemon *kind of* already does build the block

[10-Nov-18 04:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it tries to... bu nomp ignores it

[10-Nov-18 04:30 PM] Alright#0419
but nomp just cherry picks info from it and assumes the rest

`making nomp compatible with different vout types is all that is needed I think`
so, is all of this about the ac switch I went in circles trying to make work of because of something else?

we need ability to have cc vouts in coinbase eventually

[10-Nov-18 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
james fixed that ... and after looking HOW he fixed and, comparing to how I was going to fix it ... I realied the way I was going to do it, still didnt solve the problem I was trying to solve.

[10-Nov-18 04:32 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`we need ability to have cc vouts in coinbase eventually`
And for that, we need to do what I've been saying for a feken year now: ditch znomp and make something that's actually for Komodo

[10-Nov-18 04:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught that by changing the conesneus rule to use ExtractDestination (so address instead of scriptpubkey/pubkey hash etc) I could mine block rewards to a CC contract... but if they are not a cc vout .. then they coins are just lost, as the contract cant use them ..

[10-Nov-18 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
makign the daemon build a block containing a CC vout is pie ...

[10-Nov-18 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but a pool can simpy never work with it, as it cant build the same vout .. .and even if it could... it wound tneessarily ahve the right data avalibe to build the right tx

[10-Nov-18 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
leaving the ONLY solution in my mind... have the pool not build the block at all

[10-Nov-18 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and just dp the POW ... the only other way around this is to make these chains ALL 100% PoS

[10-Nov-18 04:35 PM] Alright#0419

`makign the daemon build a block containing a CC vout is pie`
If the daemon can build it, them it has a template to build from and a pool can follow that template
the issue isn't in execution, the issue is in execution **in znomp**

znomp uses a feked up library that I don't understand and is abandoned, making it work with something newer/better is totally doable; the issue has always been making it backwards compatible with existing znomp pools

[10-Nov-18 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that really does not matter in this case ...

[10-Nov-18 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
couldnt care less if old pools dont work

that's what I've been saying for a year, but everyone wants it to work with the old shit

[10-Nov-18 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so basically, what needs to be done, is for zmonp to just take the block template add the PoW and do nothign else ?

[10-Nov-18 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
return the block

[10-Nov-18 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
