🐔 ChickenPool is currently experiencing some "growing pains" and minor outages 🐔 
This is part of the process growing and of welcoming a growing HUSH to the pool as seamlessly as possible.
KMDICE and RFOX show an incorrect number of orphans and those who mined during those blocks will be made whole before the end of the transition.
Also during this transition we will be removing 0.0001 block reward coins in order to fully implement "profit-switching" mode by the end of May.

[13-Apr-19 11:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
thanks for adding HUSH, such a nice guy

[13-Apr-19 11:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nice or just hoping it moons and my 1% is worth :treasure: ? 🤔

jokes aside, once I get caught up doing the 14 tings at once that I'm doing, I hope to integrate all ecosystem projects that folks would potentially want to mine and hope that HUSH is just the 1st of many new and interesting things to come

[13-Apr-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
once you get the profit switcher working well, then i imagine you will get flooded with miners

[13-Apr-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a stats bug i found. if mining two coins, it seems to combine the reported amounts.

[13-Apr-19 11:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, that's one of the bits of NOMP that was never designed for multi-coin and needs more than one output

[13-Apr-19 11:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
seems node.js isn't as "non-blocking" as promised

[13-Apr-19 01:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
all I can hope for is that HUSH is one of many interesting KMD projects, we are excited to join the fold

Currently 71324.99338207 HUSH is in Sprout zaddrs and will not be migrated to our new blockchain, which is 1.13% of current supply
IF YOU HAVE FUNDS IN zaddrs, MOVE THEM ASAP, just over 300 blocks to go

Hey, anyone want to teach newbie how to mine kmd? I'd like to participate but I'm not as computer savy as needed. Google can only answer so much. I've figured it 0.25/day on a GPU I need an Asic minor. looking at $1700 antminers and such and dont want to drop $ on hardware not knowing what the hell I'm doing. I'd like to DM someone who can answer a few questions in laymens terms. Any volunteers? or at least links to help? specific for MacOS and KMD, VRSC, and/or ARRR mining?

[14-Apr-19 07:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CHMEX HUSH explorer seems to be showing negative confirms

[15-Apr-19 06:55 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@jonnybbig 
If you want to get your feet wet, try finding a z9 mini local to you or online .  If you’re in the US I happen to be selling 7 of them 😜
I also have one z9 regular as well.

[15-Apr-19 10:07 AM] CHMEX#0686
Hi Genie,
Yes not sure why that is showing somehow that ZMQ disconnects from time to time... Which than somehow results in negativ confirms.

[15-Apr-19 12:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CHMEX I'm guessing that the issue is whenever it comes back up it never checks a missing block and that block is never confirmed in its mind
<https://hush.explorer.dexstats.info/block/000000075ae177cb2e051449bd94dbbcf96060a22b535805305bc74c409c4b24>

[15-Apr-19 12:41 PM] CHMEX#0686
That is strange I build it now on a different system and same pattern.
@dukeleto  does hush3 was the same zmq? Implementation or did you change something?

[15-Apr-19 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_tries really hard to not think about KMDICE hashrate being as high as it sometimes get from miners on chickenpool_

[15-Apr-19 01:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX i didn't change anything with zmq in hush3, it's exactly as it is in upstream KMD

[15-Apr-19 01:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
my guess is the wrong `komodod` or wrong port might be used somehow?

[15-Apr-19 03:10 PM] CHMEX#0686
Wrong port it was now it should be fine. Thanks!!

[16-Apr-19 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's beginning to look like mining RFOX might just become a thing 🤔

[16-Apr-19 03:52 PM] jansako#3330
Might? I got major FOMO after I saw the hashrate the other day... figured I should pick up a few hundred, just in case...

[16-Apr-19 03:53 PM] jansako#3330
someone has been quietly putting quite some juice into RFOX...

[16-Apr-19 03:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it wasn't quiet

[16-Apr-19 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Has 8000 from testing mining every block of it to see if mining blocks.on his notary node improved counts when it launched 😂

[16-Apr-19 03:54 PM] jansako#3330
well, sorry, but chickenpool is not the most prominent pool on the net...(no offense)

[16-Apr-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
"What is rfox?"

[16-Apr-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
*silence*

[16-Apr-19 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, but it's also not the least mentioned pool in this discord 😛

[16-Apr-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
OK test chain it is

[16-Apr-19 03:56 PM] jansako#3330
Isn't it the game dev arm of jl's?

[16-Apr-19 03:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r that's pretty much what happened with me and PIRATE, except I just flat stopped mining it 😦

Lol not even sure the amount at this point... A 1%/fee pool with most of the hash is a hilarious tbh

charging yourself 1% too?

[16-Apr-19 04:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or did you stop mining?

[16-Apr-19 04:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Isn't mining anything ATM, only zex pool that never seems to stop working.

[16-Apr-19 04:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll prolly add it to 🐔 when I add HUSH, cuz I can

Not sure the expected.uptime on a znomp fork, but I'm close to 3 maybe 4 months I think no restart

[16-Apr-19 04:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not saying it doesn't work, just that I'm me and that's a cop-out to my mind 😛

[16-Apr-19 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What part of the simplest solution to a problem that works is a cop out exactly?

[16-Apr-19 04:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the part that calls `getblocktemplate` in z/s/knomp and then uses none of it 😛

[16-Apr-19 04:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its uses it all

[16-Apr-19 04:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
How else does it fake a block

your 2 is why your 1 is wrong

[16-Apr-19 04:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
instead of using the template, those hard code the tx format

[16-Apr-19 04:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not to mention the pre-call of subsidy

[16-Apr-19 04:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well I assume it was possible to make the disablecb work without changing he block template but I can do that js thing...  So I changed the template to make my life easier. As it was it took 3 days to get it working.

[16-Apr-19 04:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  As I tried to explained on the other channel, the algo part is not correct on ma7555 repo (who used oddhome code), in addition, as he copy paste somehow ccminer into yiimp, we have some CUDA code inside the pool so it won't compile on any of my server (because I don't have GPU on the server itself):
https://github.com/ma7555/yiimp/blob/equihash/stratum/algos/equihash.cpp#L285
```eq_cuda_context<CONFIG_MODE_1>* ptr = dynamic_cast<eq_cuda_context<CONFIG_MODE_1>*>(solvers[thr_id]);```
