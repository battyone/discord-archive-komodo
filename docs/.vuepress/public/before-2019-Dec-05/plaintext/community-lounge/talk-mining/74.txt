2 more cores (9900k vs 8700k) and 1/2 the RAM

note to self: pins on socket suck worse than pins on CPU

[29-Nov-18 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
2nd note to self: don't drop CPU on socket

Wife is making me sell my minis. Just posting cause I don't have any ebay history hoping people click. Shameless solicitation here.

[29-Nov-18 01:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how many are you selling?

[29-Nov-18 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
9900k is only 500Mh/s 😮 wow

[29-Nov-18 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ar you useing ccminer ?

[29-Nov-18 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
getting 1GH on mild OC 2700X

[29-Nov-18 02:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nhequminer and that was just 1st run out of the box, no OC, no adjustments (other than manually setting threads), and the mobo likely has some issues (100% certain it will not currently run with any RAM  in slot 2)

[29-Nov-18 02:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

tbh, with everything I went through, I'm just glad the feken thing works at all right now 😛

new mb ordered and will be here on Monday

[29-Nov-18 02:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
downloading Cuda now to play and build a ccminer with it and see if it changes

[29-Nov-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ccminer for cpu is roughly 2x faster than nheq on verushash

[29-Nov-18 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, I was lazy and that was the only miner precompiled

[29-Nov-18 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ok, off to attempt Cuda install....
Should be easy since nv and debian always work so well together :trollface:

[29-Nov-18 04:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r any hints on how to get ccminer to run VRSC on CPU and *not* GPU?

[29-Nov-18 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181

but thats the branch you need

[29-Nov-18 04:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[29-Nov-18 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
beats the shit out of the 300something that I had with the 6700k

[29-Nov-18 04:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
feken thing **does not** run cool though
240x30 radiator Liquid CPU Cooler and it's in the upper 80s (2 cores hit max of 91)

[29-Nov-18 04:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
monkins1010/ccminer is the fastest VRSC cpu miner in my experience. it's stable and works well, never had an issue with it

[29-Nov-18 05:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pool mining took about 14 minutes to "get up to speed" with benchmarks 😕

[29-Nov-18 05:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
normal

[29-Nov-18 05:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all in all, given that this isn't "for" that; I'm pleased so far
komodo rebuilds in ~ 40-45 seconds :shexy:

[29-Nov-18 06:04 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Did you buy the 9900 specifically to mine?

[29-Nov-18 06:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
noooooooooooo

[29-Nov-18 06:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nice... I should time mine for a rebuild... is that a `make clean` and then make -j16 ?

[29-Nov-18 06:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
vrsc was just a test "because I can"

[29-Nov-18 06:05 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Valid aha. That is a mean cpu for a home computer 👌

[29-Nov-18 06:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did the same with verus on my vega and the ryzen. found it to be a good speed/stability test

[29-Nov-18 06:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`time ./zcutil/build.sh -j $(nproc)`
I didn't do clean because I couldn't remember if it deletes the depends or not

[29-Nov-18 06:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
"stable" OC eventally flaked out after 2-3 days of minnig verus on all cores

[29-Nov-18 06:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it doesnt

[29-Nov-18 06:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
use zcutil

[29-Nov-18 06:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the first time (or an hige update like sapling) then just use make after that/// loads faster

[29-Nov-18 06:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
after clean:
```real    0m6.551s
user    0m14.008s
sys    0m4.136s```
feken :shexy:

[29-Nov-18 06:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
never tried just 'make' before <insert ashamed emote here>

[29-Nov-18 06:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol ... I try all kinds of things justr to see what happens

[29-Nov-18 06:11 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
That's called innovation?

[29-Nov-18 06:11 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
:+1:

[29-Nov-18 06:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or really feken dumb, depending on the results :trollface:

[29-Nov-18 06:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
did make clean, inside a VM with only 8 cores, 22s

[29-Nov-18 06:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_only has 8 cores_

[29-Nov-18 06:12 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
You're an idiot if it breaks, a mastermind if it works

[29-Nov-18 06:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mine is 8 cores/16 threds

[29-Nov-18 06:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
VM only lets me set 8 cores

[29-Nov-18 06:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt max the cpu

[29-Nov-18 06:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
8 cores **is** my max 😛

[29-Nov-18 06:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think liklely the intel will be faster at compiles, as the linker is the longest aprt for me, and I am not using boost on single cores... just flat 4.2ghz over all cores

[29-Nov-18 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
intel shoudl do 5ghz on single thread I think

[29-Nov-18 06:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
definitely getting a 2990wx when the markets come back up

[29-Nov-18 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
couldnt justify it... this thing is fine lol

[29-Nov-18 06:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im really impressed my the screen that I have more than anything else... just managed to do in lik 5h or so what would ahve taken a day or 2 on  laptop

[29-Nov-18 06:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can barely justify it, but not at all with a 55-68 cent KMD ☹

[29-Nov-18 06:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah my port wiped in half in less than a wekk 😦

[29-Nov-18 06:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
now if someone could get nvidia to work well with linux, my life would be golden

[29-Nov-18 06:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
*got a vega64 just because of linux open source drivers*

[29-Nov-18 06:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah well, I can't justify buying a personal GPU again, like ever 😛

[29-Nov-18 06:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol for what I paid for this ... it was easily justified

[29-Nov-18 06:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and now its near summer time, I havent got a power bill at all for a few months, so power insnt an issue

[29-Nov-18 06:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`for what I paid for this ... it was easily justified`
That's because you didn't drop the cost of 3 homes on 1080Tis to mine with 😛

those solar panels were a great investment 😄

[29-Nov-18 06:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think 6-8 months ago this card retailed near $1500-1600 AUD, got for less than $500

[29-Nov-18 06:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sweet

[29-Nov-18 06:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I figure I will not live long enough to use up all of these Tis to their EoL

[29-Nov-18 06:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha

[29-Nov-18 06:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181

was trying to see if equihash rentals worked on my rental service... not yet apparently 😉

[29-Nov-18 09:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
renting a rerental <- every reason I quit using mrr 🤦🏽

[29-Nov-18 09:31 PM] Alright#0419
@! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers you turning zpool into a hash rental service?

[29-Nov-18 11:07 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
not exactly

[29-Nov-18 11:07 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
but will offer a service that can rent hash from zpool

[29-Nov-18 11:08 PM] Alright#0419
@! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers accept KMD and support equihash and you should get a good amount of business 😉

{Reactions}
👆🏽 (2) 

[29-Nov-18 11:09 PM] Alright#0419
We had so many people selling off KMD for BTC just to use NH for PIRATE, KMDICE, ZEX etc

[29-Nov-18 11:13 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
well... I mine KMD now... but I can't seem to get sapling support working so may have to drop it

[29-Nov-18 11:13 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
and equihash seems to be unstable on the rental... so will need to work on that too

[29-Nov-18 11:22 PM] Alright#0419
So you're just going to drop all zkSNARKs coins as they update? 😐

[29-Nov-18 11:22 PM] Alright#0419
seems worth while to figure it out lol

[29-Nov-18 11:22 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
