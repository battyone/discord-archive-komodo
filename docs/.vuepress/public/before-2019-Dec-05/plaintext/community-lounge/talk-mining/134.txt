Iran Legalizes Crypto Mining - CoinDesk
Iran is officially recognizing bitcoin mining as an industry it will regulate and for which it will set electricity rates.

@matt_odell I'm not so sure... 5 years without updating your cold storage method is a long time in Bitcoin. Imo most of these coins are likely lost.

not sure how anything in the 1st 5 years is more than 5 years, but OK

[23-Jul-19 02:59 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
or it hasn't been touched since that date?

[23-Jul-19 03:03 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
But that would raise the question how all coins after 2014 won‚Äôt be touched for 5 years...

[23-Jul-19 03:04 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
A for effort
F for quality of display

Just deployed a new KMD pool at https://komodo.wattpool.net  Come help spread decentralization, and help us crack our first block!  Let us know if we should open a new difficulty stratum port for your miner.

miners, we are testing adaptivepow that is a way to recover from diff stranding

[31-Jul-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
above is the pool, if you can point hash to it in the next half hour or so and push the hashrate up as high as possible, we can see how well it does

[31-Jul-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810

[31-Jul-19 06:17 PM] SHossain#0007
We will start in about 40 mins. pool is ready. if you are interested, please prepare your miners to point to the above pool at the same time. @mrlynch is also participating at that time with us.

[31-Jul-19 06:32 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have over Z11 or renting from nicehash, please use port 3033. e.g: `stratum+tcp://178.159.11.114:3033`

[31-Jul-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
we just need about half an hour to max the difficulty and then we will use a single CPU core to recover the chain back to normal!

[31-Jul-19 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be great if someone can make a detailed blog post about this test, with all the details. it does solve a very large problem for all the smaller blockchains

@KomodoWorld ^^

we have almost 1.2Msol for this test starting in 15 mins. anyone else wants to join, please get ready and let us know.

Asics fail to connect to that pool unfortunately

all blocks are being mined by Decker as he has the highest hash rate

[31-Jul-19 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
having the chart is nice, so when the diff stabilizes, we need to stop all mining at the same time

[31-Jul-19 07:17 PM] SHossain#0007
we can all stop at same time

[31-Jul-19 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
actually it seems it wont display when the blocks come in. does it take long to spinup an explorer?

coming through

[31-Jul-19 07:20 PM] SHossain#0007
@CHMEX would you please start an explorer? i can DM you the chain params

[31-Jul-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
we should keep the chain alive just for historical proof of this (assuming it works) after all a single CPU rescuing a diff stranded chain at 300k diff, that just seems crazy

diff of 600k!

[31-Jul-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i think with 1Msol it will stabilize around 750k

[31-Jul-19 07:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
z9 but not getting all the hash rate on the pool ‚òπ

[31-Jul-19 07:27 PM] SHossain#0007
yeah, i couldn't setup the pool optimally

[31-Jul-19 07:27 PM] SHossain#0007
the port has only 272 diff

[31-Jul-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
diff of 750K and still more room

[31-Jul-19 07:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
wen payout sir? :troll:

[31-Jul-19 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
if we achieve million diff we can stop and let the single CPU try to recover

It will go up only if pool diff fixed or we will stay at 900k highest

[31-Jul-19 07:30 PM] SHossain#0007
if i fix the pool diff now, Decker's hash will not work
