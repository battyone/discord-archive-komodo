@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you must be fun at parties

[22-Sep-18 03:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto Except for those parties where people only want to hear their own beliefs parroted, yes, I am 😁

[23-Sep-18 11:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jl777c I'm not sure what channel this should be in, but I'm asking here since I just deleted a 2GB debug.log file on my mining node.
Is there any detrimental reason for me to **not** comment out the `skip Relaying wtx .... nLockTime ... vs now....' print?

[23-Sep-18 11:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
example:
`2018-09-23 11:05:52 skip Relaying wtx 826813d7ba679313370a40b3e919005671cc80220fed880269e69d103781f0ff nLockTime 1516644454 vs now.1537700752`
a tx with 345028 Confirmations

[23-Sep-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810

I removed it in the FSM branch so it will propagate to other branches over time

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 is there some way to check hashrate of a worker in nomp without using the web ui

[23-Sep-18 06:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
hteeteep://*IP*:*Web_Port*/api/worker_stats?*taddr*

[23-Sep-18 06:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆 should work with znomp

[23-Sep-18 06:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or did you mean actual nomp?

[23-Sep-18 07:06 PM] Alright#0419
problem is that I have a pool running that I'm not able to restart for a day or two

[23-Sep-18 07:06 PM] Alright#0419
which has the web ui deactivated

[23-Sep-18 07:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That's about the best help I can be, since I never have any need for the UI beyond the occasional attempt to help someone

Hey folks, anyone looking for a new type of mining pool here?
one the rewards you for finding blocks for the pool?

@Macro-Pool.com what's the best way to contact the operator of your pool in case of an update?

[23-Sep-18 07:27 PM] Macro-Pool.com#9744

i am anxiously waiting to relocate my z9 minis out of the house.

[24-Sep-18 07:26 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe tomorrow

[24-Sep-18 07:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm anxiously awaiting an LP to dump all of my HUSH to before CMC brings the price back down to 9 cents where it should be :trollface:

[24-Sep-18 07:48 PM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 did you mine any PIRATE yet?

[24-Sep-18 07:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've literally been too busy to even do anything like adding a coin that easy to add 😦

[24-Sep-18 07:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
been trying to wrap my head around this whole buffer system that bitcoinjs-lib uses so that I can make a stratum for folks to use with `-ac_perc` assetchains

[24-Sep-18 07:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and not doing a good job of it 😭

[24-Sep-18 07:52 PM] SHossain#0007
using `-acperc` doesn't work with knomp?

[24-Sep-18 07:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, because the coinbase transactions use pubkey and not the convention address setup

[24-Sep-18 07:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that whole "bleeding edge" thing 😛

[24-Sep-18 08:04 PM] SHossain#0007
nice. the diff just went high

[24-Sep-18 08:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
define "high" :trollface:

[24-Sep-18 08:04 PM] SHossain#0007
it is hard for my 2 z9 minis to find blocks

[24-Sep-18 08:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
KMD high, HUSH high, ZCL high, or ZEC high?

[24-Sep-18 08:04 PM] SHossain#0007
about 2 MSol

[24-Sep-18 08:05 PM] SHossain#0007
PIRATE

[24-Sep-18 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is going crazy, almost where KMD diff was before

[24-Sep-18 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
at this rate PIRATE hash will be more than KMD in a few weeks

[24-Sep-18 08:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
guess I should hit it for 10k or so

[24-Sep-18 08:06 PM] SHossain#0007
PIRATE is going to be the first private chain to get notarized

[24-Sep-18 08:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think I lacked interest because of the high block reward

[24-Sep-18 08:08 PM] SHossain#0007
have you checked the price users are willing to pay for PIRATE? 🤑

[24-Sep-18 08:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, I've been too busy dumping HUSH @ 40 cents and ZCL at $4+

[24-Sep-18 09:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Hey question guys... Does anyone have a connection to mine EQLI?  
Their chain is stalled and @xRobeSx pool doesn't connect anymore.   One of the team is asking me for help and I'll mine it up for him but I have never set up my own connection.

[24-Sep-18 09:32 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have a laptop I am going to put on it for him in my mining room, I just need an address to point it at.

[24-Sep-18 09:32 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Dr Debt 👆

[24-Sep-18 09:33 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Yeah any help would be greatly appreciated

[24-Sep-18 09:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If no one gets there in the next couple hours, then I'll put a GPU on it after dinner

[24-Sep-18 09:43 PM] Alright#0419
@Dr Debt still stalled?

[24-Sep-18 09:43 PM] Alright#0419
Oh I see it's unstalled but still slow now

[24-Sep-18 09:46 PM] xRobeSx#5136
try to lower the diff down some so CPU's can mine it again 😃

[24-Sep-18 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the diff was at 4.6, the result of a single 1080 (not even a Ti) 😣

[24-Sep-18 10:03 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
They're in

[24-Sep-18 10:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085

Isnt EQLI mined by notaries as well?

[25-Sep-18 12:55 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Yes @Cryptoon but someone gpu mined it then stopped and the diff was too high for CPU’s to mine a block.

having that issue above trying to gpu mine pirate if any knows whats up help lol

[25-Sep-18 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CryptoNinjaa mining pirate is the same as any other assetchain, you simply need a stratum and an equihash miner

[25-Sep-18 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe switch to EWBF's miner (0.34b version)?

[25-Sep-18 01:53 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Sorted it buddy. I was having a stupid moment and was trying to mine to a transparent addy and not a Z addy. lmao

[25-Sep-18 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh, yes, you can only use t addy if doing it solo

[25-Sep-18 01:55 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 do your mini's work on pirate?

[25-Sep-18 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[25-Sep-18 01:55 PM] xRobeSx#5136
testing with someone now, and the mini doesn't wanna seem to connect to their pool

[25-Sep-18 01:56 PM] xRobeSx#5136
hmmm

[25-Sep-18 01:56 PM] xRobeSx#5136
okay thanks

[25-Sep-18 01:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
working on poolX and working on PIRATE are 2 distinct things

[25-Sep-18 01:56 PM] xRobeSx#5136
huh?

[25-Sep-18 01:57 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I just assumed it might be something with the mini not liking Z address as the worker

[25-Sep-18 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, it's something with the pool not liking it

[25-Sep-18 01:58 PM] xRobeSx#5136
okay thanks for the info

[25-Sep-18 01:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm one of the rare folks that uses the pubkey feature of nomp and my workers ar all named like `31f029750d43ae26100feb1d9da277e068c1dcd7_1x39`

[25-Sep-18 01:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
cgminer cares not about names on any level

[25-Sep-18 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@xRobeSx I have had DNS issues with pools before, can they connect to the pool with a GPU miner?

[25-Sep-18 02:02 PM] xRobeSx#5136
we had it working with CPU first, just got the mini to connect now

some of you overclocked z9 40 Kh/sol ?

[25-Sep-18 02:07 PM] $tefano.#3560
it's possible to OC Z9 with Z9 mini firmware?

[25-Sep-18 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BM being BM, I'd not try mini fw and just use curl or edit the GUI to OC a Z9

[25-Sep-18 02:09 PM] $tefano.#3560
i will try it later, thanks

[25-Sep-18 02:09 PM] $tefano.#3560
max hash? 45KHs?

[25-Sep-18 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Since I don't own one, I'm just guessing, but I'd assume max is likely in the 50-60 range

[25-Sep-18 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it really comes down to the quality of the weakest chip in the unit
