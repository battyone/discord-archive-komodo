for the 2x to 4x cases

[08-Aug-19 10:42 AM] zawy#5864
You have the 4 in place of 3 in RST?

[08-Aug-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
no, its still 3

[08-Aug-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
3, 6 and 12 are active and working very well together

[08-Aug-19 10:43 AM] zawy#5864
It's noticeably better with all 3?

[08-Aug-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
yes! they do get the diff up to close where it needs to be

[08-Aug-19 10:43 AM] zawy#5864
does 12 over-ride 6 which overrides 3?

[08-Aug-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
not always

[08-Aug-19 10:44 AM] zawy#5864
it's min target rule?

[08-Aug-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
usually 3 is the dominant one, but really depends on the specifics

[08-Aug-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
yes usually all three have very close values

[08-Aug-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
sometimes 3 is much lower target (higher diff) than the other two, but after a bit, they are essentially the same

[08-Aug-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
i have seen some cases where 6 was the lowest target, and even 12

[08-Aug-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
didnt find any pattern, numbers flying by so fast

[08-Aug-19 10:46 AM] zawy#5864
if RST is active >20 blocks, is digishield automatically close when it takes over?

[08-Aug-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
with 3, 6, 12, it lasts closer to 40 blocks and probably that is why the diff is closer

[08-Aug-19 10:48 AM] zawy#5864
From the 1 run of TSA  I've looked at so far that lasted about 20 blocks, average solvetime was correct which means targets was correct.  Digi looks at only past 17 blocks.  It should be adjusted so that it is on target in a case like that

[08-Aug-19 10:54 AM] zawy#5864
I'll look at what you got.  My plan today is to start modelling this. All the DA needs to abstracted away from programming and look like math.     What kind of efficiency is lost declaring everything arith256?   A nanosecond?  Is lack of RAM a problem for KMD nodes?

[08-Aug-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess a few nanoseconds, this is just local variables so RAM usages is not an issue

[08-Aug-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
in a couple hours i will have data from the new test run. the RST phase is working wonderful as usual

[08-Aug-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
probably the high variance of the TSA is what maybe just made the diff go lower

[08-Aug-19 11:08 AM] zawy#5864
So it seems declaring everything arith256 is better because it increases clarity   ctA is what miners solve and validators validate, ctB is what RST sees.  Adjusting ctB by 2.72 is not enough for digi to be on track immediately after a long RST run?

[08-Aug-19 11:09 AM] zawy#5864
Do i have that wrong?  what's ctA?

[08-Aug-19 11:16 AM] zawy#5864
OK, ctA is RST and digi output.  ctB is the adjusted RST output or zero if digi was in use.  RST uses ctA if ctB is zero, else use ctB.  Digi should be using the same thing, except divide the ctB[i]-ctB[i+1]  values by 2.72

[08-Aug-19 11:16 AM] zawy#5864
Right?

[08-Aug-19 11:31 AM] zawy#5864
What are the last 2 columns in the CSV?

[08-Aug-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
correct. last two columes are diff of ctA and solvetime for that height

[08-Aug-19 12:04 PM] zawy#5864
avg D for digi right after RST is the same as avg D for RST....I thought you said there was a problem?

[08-Aug-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that after RST ends, the diff goes low, even to the point of triggering RST again, so clearly something is wrong. i am sending the new test results, which at first look seems much better

[08-Aug-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810

[08-Aug-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
this is with a div3 for digishield, even for the TSA. also the way the state machine works, the TSA ended up alternating turns with digishield

[08-Aug-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so the pattern of alternating ctB/000000000 is when TSA was active, the lower two bits for nBits are set when TSA did the block

[08-Aug-19 12:07 PM] zawy#5864
digi needs to avg a few of the RST's.   Let me think about how to do that

[08-Aug-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so ending in 3, 7, b, f

[08-Aug-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
RST finished on ht.95

[08-Aug-19 12:08 PM] zawy#5864
digi is not stable after RST because RST targets jump around so much

[08-Aug-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
then 56 minutes for the next 50 blocks, no RST triggered, so even though the math is wrong, it avoided the problem of earlier versions

[08-Aug-19 12:25 PM] zawy#5864
When I do digishield on ctA values, the difficulty is correct as if no adjustment is needed

[08-Aug-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
but without correction, then the diff cant go up as the blocks come out slower

[08-Aug-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
found a place where it was overcorrecting, which might explain the 10% slower than expected blocks, also trying to smooth out the TSA a bit more, i remember it was working quite smoothly with a 4 block SMA, but it was too slow, so trying a 2 block + digishield average

[08-Aug-19 12:30 PM] zawy#5864
The 4th column is RST output?

[08-Aug-19 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
height, timestamp, nBits in hex, bnTarget based on nBits, ctB, diff, solvetime

[08-Aug-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
next test run with the above changes RST kicked in an in 2 blocks it slowed it way down, only some big miner luck prevents it from making up time, one block had an implied hashrate to solve 350 diff

[08-Aug-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so the RST continues to amaze and if the TSA cant be stabilized, maybe it just needs to be removed. i do like its much faster than digishield behavior though

[08-Aug-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
we will do an ASIC test in 2 hours to verify it works as well with 1000x attacks

[08-Aug-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe will do it so it is  a 10000x

[08-Aug-19 12:38 PM] zawy#5864
I'm having trouble keeping track of what we're doing because there are 3 difficulty and 3 different algorithm, not counting exp()

[08-Aug-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, probably nearly impossible to model this accurately

[08-Aug-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
any model becomes as complex as the actual implementation

[08-Aug-19 12:39 PM] zawy#5864
no, modelling simulates mining perfectly.

[08-Aug-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
there are actually 5, counting the 3/6/12 RST

[08-Aug-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
I check for RST.3 to trigger, if not check RST.6, if not check RST.12

[08-Aug-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
then if any RST was triggered, calculate all 3 inner values and take the min

[08-Aug-19 12:42 PM] zawy#5864
You do W=6 inner if W=3 triggers?

[08-Aug-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
when all three are done, it goes into an alternating digishield/TSA mode, was unintentional side effect of how i integrated the TSA

[08-Aug-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont have enough bits to encode which trigger triggered

[08-Aug-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so it sees that some RST triggered and checks all three

[08-Aug-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i think i see what might work to transition from RST to digishield cleanly. like you say the onchain values are very good, but we cant use them when RST is active

[08-Aug-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
however, i can just use ctA if RST isnt active

[08-Aug-19 12:52 PM] zawy#5864
diff column is input to RST?  What is input to digi?

[08-Aug-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
diff is just the diff that derives from nBits, nBits -> bnTarget -> diff

[08-Aug-19 12:53 PM] zawy#5864
that's the 6th column?

[08-Aug-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, diff is sixth column

[08-Aug-19 12:53 PM] zawy#5864
I don't have headers

[08-Aug-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
height,timestamp,nBits,bnTarget,ctB,diff,solvetime

[08-Aug-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
with RST3/6/12 it gets the diff all the way where it needs to be, so if i just toggle what digishield sees to just ctA when RST not active, it could just work

[08-Aug-19 12:55 PM] zawy#5864
OK, so nBits, nbTarget and diff are same thing.

[08-Aug-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, just different formats

[08-Aug-19 12:57 PM] zawy#5864
and ctB is nBits (if it's not zero) that is adjusted by my time^2 equation?

[08-Aug-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[08-Aug-19 12:57 PM] zawy#5864
what is the input to digi for RST blocks?  yours looks like it's varying too much

[08-Aug-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
very simple code change to toggle digishield to use only ctA when RST is not active. i will test that next, it feels very promising as you already verified ctA is correct for digishield. digishield is currently getting ctB if nonz, all the time, even when RST is not active

[08-Aug-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
so for 17 blocks after it ends it is still seeing the ctB that is very volatile, that could be the reason for the problems

[08-Aug-19 12:59 PM] zawy#5864
ctA is same as nBits?

[08-Aug-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry, the digishield gets ctB/3 for an RST active block. that was needed to adjust the diff

[08-Aug-19 01:00 PM] zawy#5864
using nBits, digisheild seems about right

[08-Aug-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it looks very clean and should make a nice transition. will test that soon. current test is 10 blocks away from RST having fixed things and then going into the chaos of alternative digishield/TSA_EMA

[08-Aug-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it is at least better than without the /= 3 into the digshield data, but it feels too random. i think there is no big need for TSA_EMA with RST working so well

[08-Aug-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
so the only weakness would be the small hashrate boost and "strandings", will need to recover via digishield only

[08-Aug-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess all things considered that is not so bad a weakness as it just means lower coin emissions

[08-Aug-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and occasionally exp() will trigger, even with a 3x stranding

[08-Aug-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
your baby has come a long ways in the last week!

[08-Aug-19 01:08 PM] zawy#5864
so  digi needs  ctA and RST needs ctB and we don't need the 2.72 .

[08-Aug-19 01:08 PM] zawy#5864
Right?

[08-Aug-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the 2.72 wont ever kick in, correct

[08-Aug-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
much cleaner

[08-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Lumbi#8378
new amd kernel.

[08-Aug-19 01:19 PM] zawy#5864
My plan was for RST to catch up and stop  triggering in W  blocks, which might occur by replacing the 1/W in "i" with 1/(W+1).  This has the problem of digishield not seeing 17 blocks, so Diff will drop back down almost to where it was......but you see it is supposed to drop down if it was an attack and if  RST stops the attack.....and if RST did not stop the attack, it triggers again after 3 block.....after 3 repeats digi gets close to correct target as it should becuase it seems the attacker is refusing to leave.   But this motivates him to attack 3 on and 3 off until digishield rises beyond his comfort zone.  So he leaves long time and digi slowly falls. Then he returns.  There is no solution to this except to make D rise in first block based on TSA-EMA so that he is at least paying 2x more difficulty than average.

[08-Aug-19 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
but the 6 and 12 kicking in will prevent a 3 on/3 off pattern

[08-Aug-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
once the 6 or 12 kickin, then a long stretch will be a bit slower than T

[08-Aug-19 01:23 PM] zawy#5864
No because it catches up so 6 never triggers

[08-Aug-19 01:23 PM] zawy#5864
6 is supposed to tigger if the attack was too small for W=3 to see

[08-Aug-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so a 3 block attack with 3x hashrate? or much bigger?

[08-Aug-19 01:24 PM] zawy#5864
W=3 won't see it.   W=6 will, pretty soon

[08-Aug-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
so a few times of 3on/3off, seems small potatoes

[08-Aug-19 01:26 PM] zawy#5864
Yes, what I'm saying is that we should get the above plan working before addressing smaller attacks.

[08-Aug-19 01:27 PM] zawy#5864
sequence is D, E, R, D or D, E, R, E

[08-Aug-19 01:27 PM] zawy#5864
where D= digi, E=ema, R = RST
