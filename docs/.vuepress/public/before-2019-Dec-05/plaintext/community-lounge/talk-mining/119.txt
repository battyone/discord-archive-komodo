there is extra timerolling param, which doesn't allow regular auxes to work with pow+pos coins

[19-Apr-19 06:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Scrypt MM is most profitable, litecoin+doge+ shitcoin xyz ,  main issue with MM outside of Scrypt is the coins they mine are pretty much crap

[19-Apr-19 06:51 PM] Ondalf#1318
if it adds even 1sat per found block, its usually worth it üòõ

Thank you ondalf. I will check tonight in papers about numbers

Wallets are restored and üêîpool is back online
Sorry for the downtime, investigating what caused the chain corruptions to begin with....

[19-Apr-19 09:54 PM] phm87#7395
About aux pow, I made the calculation based on zpool numbers and I found 6% for sha256. But it depends on price and difficulty.
If we read the code, it seems that aux mining is literally as an free addition. Aux is checked always first whenever submit is made and height of submit is higher than any aux. So if a submit happens for BTC, we could find a block of all aux coins on sha256

On scrypt, I calculated 2.7% of additionnal profit with aux mining (with several aux coins)

[19-Apr-19 10:04 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That‚Äôs interesting!

[19-Apr-19 10:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
super interesting

[19-Apr-19 10:11 PM] phm87#7395
and about profit switching (I read that jl777 and CG discussed about this subject), in the same repo, there is a good profit switch (it takes into account profitability of course but also the coin nethash to avoid to throw too much hashrate on a tiny coin and other parameters)

[19-Apr-19 10:16 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`to throw too much hashrate on a tiny coin`
imo, that's a bad idea
never underestimate the utility of 100M penny stocks that you can actively liquidate

[19-Apr-19 10:22 PM] Ondalf#1318
Then again, small in this means low diff coin. Not low on value

[19-Apr-19 10:24 PM] Ondalf#1318
Also, small diff coins gets slowly up in the difficulty scale, if there are miners with various speeds as it can allocate only single miner to mine coin X. By default, yiimp refuses to push more than twice the nethash speed into coin, UNLESS it's alone in the algo

[19-Apr-19 10:26 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
ahhh
I never had that restriction to deal with

[19-Apr-19 10:27 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`small in this means low diff coin. Not low on value` there does tend to be a correlation though

[19-Apr-19 10:35 PM] Ondalf#1318
Ripped a few chains with wrong parameters so I kinda have a hunch about internals of that üòÇ

[20-Apr-19 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All n and k are supported already as long as k is bigger than n. However, to use large numbers of them u need to add more code as u need an equihsh solver defined for each value. I got around this by adding komodo_nk.h which can take any value and a recompile enables it. I've tested all the values hardcoded as well as 77/3

[20-Apr-19 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@dukeleto @jl777c

[20-Apr-19 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Tromp solver is not working with ac_nk

[20-Apr-19 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Never tested a pool

[20-Apr-19 01:43 AM] Alright#0419
I think it's useful for coins that like the idea of hard forking to another algo as soon as ASIC/FPGAs are on it

[20-Apr-19 01:44 AM] Alright#0419
it's a cat and mouse game at that point, but many coins are playing this exact game right now

[20-Apr-19 01:45 AM] Alright#0419
Also useful for chains that don't have value such as an oracles specific chain

[20-Apr-19 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also if you look at the code, I added a BEAM specific thing to the generatehash function, that is only active when using ac_nk... this *should* make BEAM miners and pools work with ac_nk but only for 150,5 values.

[20-Apr-19 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it would also be possible to change that generate hash in some small way, to also fork each nk value from ASIC aswell, but not sure about that.,

[20-Apr-19 07:50 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Isnt the idea of having lots of miners/high hash rates to secure your blockchain ledger? If decentralisation is the reason you're changing algo, i dont think it is a valid point.
If your algorithm already has ASIC's on it that are widely available(such as equihash), surely this would be more secure, as well as more decentralised, than switching to another algorithm?
Once you switch to another algorithm, security is comprised by the first company to make an ASIC or FPGA code for it, as they will have access to a majority of the hash rate.
What are peoples thoughts on this?

[20-Apr-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
dont you know that "decentralization" means "any algo as long as i have hardware for it already" otherwise its "centralized"

[20-Apr-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
plz dont let the facts get in the way!

[20-Apr-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
as the facts are BTC is the most secure as every efficiency is put in play and it requires maybe a gigawatt of power to attack it, not to mention all the hardware.

[20-Apr-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
all these coins that switch away from algos with ASIC so it is for GPU and then the fpga drinks their milkshake. it almost seems like a marketing effort of the fpga outfits

[20-Apr-19 08:02 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It is perplexing. I dont particularly understand it. Dont get me wrong, I like that you are creating an ability to chose what algorithm people want when creating an assetchain, I just dont understand algo hoping and the ideology of remaining decentralised through running away from ASIC's.

[20-Apr-19 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For me, it was msotly looking for a way to secure and mine chains with out a block reward... When you have ASIC values, then the cahins can be stopepd dead for maybe even weeks at a time. Byt using some obsucre values and being able to easiy change it, we can rely on dpow alone to secure the chains.

[20-Apr-19 08:05 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
What would the use case of such a chain be?

[20-Apr-19 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was msotly for LABS. VerusHash 1.1 and any nk value gives us a pretty solid way to prevent nasty miners breaking the LABS cluster just for lolz

[20-Apr-19 08:06 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah thats fair I guess, low difficulty chains can get screwed for a long time by ASIC's

[20-Apr-19 08:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
exaclty. Not that it matters, a determined person could still break it with massive amounts of AWS VPS's... but its not a bad as ASIC or as cheap.

[20-Apr-19 08:08 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'd say that use case is fairly corner case though. Could you just not write in an auto difficulty scale up, say below a certain amount of hash, to stop that difficulty spike?

[20-Apr-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
people have been trying for years...

[20-Apr-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
not much can gracefully handle a million times increase of hashrate, that then disappears

[20-Apr-19 08:10 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I was unaware, but not surprised somebody has already thought to find a solution for it aha

[20-Apr-19 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hybrid PoS/PoW can kind ifo handle it, but introduces more problems as you need more nodes to keep the chains moving.

[20-Apr-19 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like you say though, these kinds of chains and not really going to be used for much in the real world outsude of LABS.

[20-Apr-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
until they are

[20-Apr-19 08:11 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I mean if a chain hasnt had much development in awhile, and are still being used, they could look at switching to a hybrid model

[20-Apr-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
in the world of millions of chains, i think almost all conceivable variations will exist

[20-Apr-19 08:11 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
They do. But we could provide a solution to it

[20-Apr-19 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is true., I guess if LABS is sucessful with it, people will use it. I was hoping to be able to steal Verus's merge mining stuff so LABS main chain could secure the 0BR Chains, butr so far that hasn't proved withing my skills to do.

[20-Apr-19 08:12 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The KMD chain assurance. Below x amount of hash, we recommend switching to a PoS/PoW hybrid and use NN's as stakers.

[20-Apr-19 08:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This was my plan in LABS ues... but for notary ndoe to effectivly stake and notarize at the same time, is quite a hard problem to solve.

[20-Apr-19 08:13 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
They wouldnt have to. You could give them a staking pubkey, to use on another node?

[20-Apr-19 08:13 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So a NN would have two pubkeys added in the hardfork

[20-Apr-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can easily use 2 nodes. that is no problem. But running 2 of every node is not that easy.

[20-Apr-19 08:14 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Of every node?

[20-Apr-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Most notary nodes would need a second server for this as they run bare metal machines with a single IP. I guess you can change ports n users n stuf but its hard to manage.

[20-Apr-19 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I worked out how to make notaries be able to stake, but it required being able to load a second wallet.

[20-Apr-19 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the code change was too great...

[20-Apr-19 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
too many possible things to go wrong

[20-Apr-19 08:15 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I mean a staking node could be a cheap node, and we could just make it a requirement to do it?

[20-Apr-19 08:16 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
If KMD saw it as a valuable thing to offer chains

[20-Apr-19 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wihout some solution like this, we end up with the situation now, where notaries who mine AC, are usually lower in counts... So competetive nodes either dont mine at all, or use a second node.

[20-Apr-19 08:17 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I imagine if there are a million assetchains, a shitload may end up with small amounts of hash, but still require dpow

{Reactions}
üëç 

[20-Apr-19 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But how to you enforce a notary OP to mine/stake ?  Maybe it becomes some election pledge who knows.

[20-Apr-19 08:18 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
You could require it? Or offer a different reward for doing it. Two pubkeys, a notarising one, a staking one.

[20-Apr-19 08:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Maybe KMD could offer chain assurance as part of the dpow fee

[20-Apr-19 08:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
There is nothing to say a single notary doesnt require two nodes?

[20-Apr-19 08:20 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Or wont require more than one in the future

[20-Apr-19 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I messed around for litterally weeks on this problem lol... Tried hundreds of com,binations of hash algo, staking utxos and values... never really got anything to works quite right... Although I got VerusHash 1.1 chain taht can be kept moving with a difficulty over a billion using only 2000 coins and 2 CPU cores üòÇ

[20-Apr-19 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hovever the blokctimes were attrocious... block a bunch in a minute then stop for a while... All the time.

[20-Apr-19 08:23 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Surely something like 97% PoS/3%PoW would continue with such high hashing amounts?

[20-Apr-19 08:24 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
May as well just be PoS at that point maybe aha

[20-Apr-19 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yep pretty much. I really depends on what you want to do. For LABS the issue is that if you use too much PoS% on the 0BR chains, people are losing out on staking rewards on the main chain, so its likely it will end up without enough staking utxos to keep it movning along. So my solution was to use 10-20%PoS so a very small value of coins would block enough to keep the chain moving along. But to do this you really need s CPU algo or make it so that only noaries can mine.  Which is still an option I may look at depending on how things trun out after launch and are tested in the real world.

[20-Apr-19 08:35 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It is a problem that will need to be addressed for assetchains. I think if KMD offered an official solution, it would be better for the community, rather than a 3rd party offer a solution.
Could you add a NN only staking mode. Where miners could mine PoW normally, and the chain can have dpow, with NNs only  PoS staking?

[20-Apr-19 08:37 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
This would incentivise NN's getting another node by accumulating the coin they stake?

[20-Apr-19 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
easily possible I think.

[20-Apr-19 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although starting to check vast numbers of address/pubkey at some point you will slow down things a bit much. I guess unless we try it we cant know though.

[20-Apr-19 08:41 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Im not sure how itd be coded, but could you just hardcode pubkeys in and allow only those addresses to stake. Meaning if any random person tried to stake, it would check against the pubkeys in the hardcode and either allow, or not

[20-Apr-19 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes made something exactly like this for the streamer chain, all that is needed is a loop isntead of checking a single key.

[20-Apr-19 09:34 AM] gcharang#6833
what about optional notary easy mining through an -ac option say from 5% to 75% does that help here?

[20-Apr-19 09:35 AM] gcharang#6833
instead of staking

[20-Apr-19 09:36 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Im not sure how notary 'easy mining' is affected by a massive increase in difficulty. Im not sure if its even been tested as KMD has a stable hash rate

[20-Apr-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it has been tested

[20-Apr-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
no effect

[20-Apr-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
there can be a terahash, still the notaries will mine, the problem would be that the non-notary blocks will be hard to find

[20-Apr-19 09:51 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c 
`optional notary easy mining through an -ac option say from 5% to 75%` for a low hash rate assetchain that is dPoW'd can help with censorship resistence correct?
If say 95% mining hash wanted to censor some transactions, notary easy mining can come in and let them through

[20-Apr-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
95% hashrate can reorg at will

[20-Apr-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
anything sustained over 51% can censor

[20-Apr-19 09:56 AM] gcharang#6833
95% or even 100% of the miners want to censor but if the chain had 51% notary easy mining and it is dpow'd , there won't be censorship?

[20-Apr-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as the "notary" group is not compromised, no censorship is possible

[20-Apr-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we can add an -ac_easymining=[] where the array of pubkeys are specified

In essence, centralised mining :P

[20-Apr-19 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats exactly what it is... maybe there can also be no reward for it üòõ

[20-Apr-19 10:00 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
They could still reorg or attack the blocks though

[20-Apr-19 10:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The whole idea of NN's is that they can't do anything if "compromised" other than not notarise. Also ac easymining could be an alternative to founders rewards

[20-Apr-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
that is why i dont want to give the easy mining power to notaries, but rather to a list of pubkeys

[20-Apr-19 11:00 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah makes sense.
-ac_easymining=25[] 
You could add a % of blocks in there as well. 
If there was 1 pubkey in that list, do you think this would effectively mitigate difficulty spikes?

[20-Apr-19 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as that pubkey mines, then it mines at easy diff

speaking of marketing, any chance you can list all your other pools on each pool? it seems you have at least three but maybe there are more
