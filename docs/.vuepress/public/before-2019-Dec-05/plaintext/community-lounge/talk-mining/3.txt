@Cryptoon  Yeah, tried calling. It goes straight to voicemail, never got a call back even when I pretended to want to place a new order. I don't speak Dutch, but the one-star speaks for itself... They seem Dutch, cause the address on the invoice in in Holland, and their domain is registered to a residential address like 2km away form the place of business, as  listed on the invoice...

[21-Jun-18 06:08 PM] jansako#3330
I am thinking small claims court will be my way forward, trouble is the EU one only goes up to 5k EUR, I think my local UK one would cover my (at this point) loss.

If you do know lawyers around Rotterdam...

@jansako not in the netherlands, if you want I can ask my lawyer who is good over there though?

[21-Jun-18 08:21 PM] jansako#3330
By all means, please do. Can't see how it could hurt. Thank you!

Is there anyone here that has dedicated rigs and has winduhs on them? And if so, why?

[22-Jun-18 03:05 PM] xRobeSx#5136
hah why do you ask?

[22-Jun-18 03:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I've seen a lot of posts around with vmem and driver issues with win10 and the 144,5 miners and it sparked my curiosity

[22-Jun-18 03:07 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not that I understand why *anyone* uses win10 ever, anyway ðŸ˜›

I am not savvy with linux yet, haven't had the time to try and learn it thoroughly.   Never used it.   
I do use hive but that's pretty idiot friendly.
That said, what I am mining right now is only available to this noob with Windows as Hive doesn't have the miner uploaded for it.

[22-Jun-18 03:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Swear I am going to learn Linux one day, probably when my kids learn it and teach it to me.

[23-Jun-18 12:34 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Anyone noticed the massive increase in Zcash hash rate over the last two days ... >_>

[23-Jun-18 01:02 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Als0 @ComputerGenie  I do, because im only just now learning linux xD

[23-Jun-18 02:29 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
>Anyone noticed the massive increase in Zcash hash rate over the last two days ... >_>
The batch 1 and 1.5 of the z9 minis have been shipped, so it stands to reason

[23-Jun-18 02:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Kind of squashes the speculation. Bitmain was already using them all

[23-Jun-18 03:08 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah, but even with those first batches, it jumped 3x the hash rate. It's going to be insane after all the batches are released

[23-Jun-18 10:13 AM] dudezmobi#1945
bitmain distributed it to several coins, most first batches mined zcash

[23-Jun-18 10:32 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah I get that, I'm sure we will see some KMD hash rate increase

[23-Jun-18 06:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thing is my rigs are far more stable with win10 than ethos. Crashes even without much tuning and oc / underwattage. Couldn t have more than day / hours before a problem with ethos. Switch to win10 just made it run perfectly

[23-Jun-18 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hard mistake I made when I choose to go on full amd. Now eth "crashed" ROI is... a disaster.

[23-Jun-18 06:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
(For @ComputerGenie  asking if there were fools mining on w10)

[23-Jun-18 08:04 PM] Tyrael#0138
@Deleted User what if i told you, that the prices are going even lower.

[23-Jun-18 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
They will. Yeah. Bad operation. I can only blame myself. Thing is i really don t know if I should just bet on unknown alts or just stick with eth.

[23-Jun-18 08:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
The fact that "pos is coming in few monthes" made me just launch and bet that would just be a mess at first then a good choice after. But this is just too much delayed now.

[23-Jun-18 09:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Deleted User what if I told you that Equihash isn't Ethereum and that the EthOS shell on top of the Ubuntu shell makes for shit on top of shit and isn't a stable Linux to start with?

[23-Jun-18 09:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. I saw this after i saw it was unstable as fuck. But as the first of my rig was running without any problem on win10 I decided to clone hdd. Thing is the only way to tune it at that time by a noob was with polaris editor... on... win

[23-Jun-18 09:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
And yeah equihash isn t eth. But like you said : I mine what s the most profitable. And atm for amd... eth is just the best option for "stable" and "less risk"

[23-Jun-18 11:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
What I meant was that despite that addons that allow for it to be used for other algos, it's designed with eth in mind; so, one has to take that into consideration when choosing it

[23-Jun-18 11:35 PM] henk#1673
83% increase on difficulty

[24-Jun-18 12:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Well that sucks

[24-Jun-18 12:49 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Are there any indicators as to why the increase?

[24-Jun-18 12:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Because hashrate is back to where it was a few months ago?

[24-Jun-18 12:54 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
40k block diff is far from out of the norm

[24-Jun-18 12:55 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's pretty much been between 25-55k for the last year

[24-Jun-18 12:58 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah fair enough, wasn't sure if there was another reason aha

Seems someone's mining the fek out of DEX ðŸ¤”

[24-Jun-18 09:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Alright maybe?

[24-Jun-18 09:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Didnt know dex was minable? Or only for the tx fees?

[24-Jun-18 10:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
All "old" asset chains are minable, as are most of the newer ones; however, the block reward is 0.00010000 per block (plus any tx fees)

[25-Jun-18 06:38 AM] CiPhEr#2091
i'm trying to put an equation in my excel spreadsheet to calculate mining revenue for KMD. It seems as if it functions differently than other equihash coins. Usually I would use ((MyHashrate/(DifficultyX8192))Xsecondsinaday)Xblockrewardof3 and its pretty close for an equihash coin, however for KMD it seems the 8192 number needs to be closer to around 16. Does anyone know the precise # I should use there?

[25-Jun-18 07:38 AM] jansako#3330
@ComputerGenie the DEX hashrate is actually lower than usual, typically I see around 1 Ksol on it. SN about double that.

[25-Jun-18 10:48 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Worst mining performance for the 1070ti is on linux combined with EWBF miner... djeezes.. getting 10% less hashrate.
Looking to get back on win10 and DSTM

[25-Jun-18 10:58 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ouch

[25-Jun-18 10:58 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Windows is also much easier to overclock xD

[25-Jun-18 12:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Not sure how windows is easier (3 sliers and 2 programs vs 3 lines in terminal)

[25-Jun-18 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@jansako SN is typically ~1500sol/s + NNs

[25-Jun-18 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sif Notary Node mine SuperNET... I made a script that filters out any coin with diff over 50 and only mine ones under that lol.

[25-Jun-18 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
that'll work for you for a little while
I'm starting my assetchain stratum today ðŸ˜›

[25-Jun-18 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The idea was that if I mine some blocks, I get them first and might help increase AC notarizations... This was a failed experiment for the most part.... chains with low diff, hardly ever have any TX so they hardly ever mine anyway.

[25-Jun-18 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
oh, you're mining them with cpu and wallets

[25-Jun-18 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm all about the GPUs and ASICs ðŸ˜›

[25-Jun-18 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha well NN is CPU...

[25-Jun-18 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm going to build out a stratum for GPUs that rotates through all of the asset chains

ðŸš€ 

[25-Jun-18 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught about puting znomp on my seed node and pointing my shitty GPUS at it to mine empty blocks, to get more notarizations... for about 5 minutes lol

[25-Jun-18 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
heh, the assets that I mined back in the winter is all that's keeping me from not mining at a loss now

[25-Jun-18 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
current markets, I'd be losing ~$11 a day

[25-Jun-18 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah its not pretty out there... I dumped all my XSG right at the top of its price peak, paid for my miner, then i turned it off... without that free power I was taking from government house next door I would ahve lost a huge amount on that excersise lol... anyone want some 280x's?

[25-Jun-18 12:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[25-Jun-18 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
even at a loss, I can't convince myself to turn them off

[25-Jun-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess everyone else mining BTC is thinking the same thing atm..

[25-Jun-18 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm only on BTC atm because the decay rate of the 5N pool I'm in is paying ~4x

[25-Jun-18 01:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
normally, I mine ~2 dozen sha shitcoins

I'm not sure that KMD will even notice the increase

[25-Jun-18 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
1 ASIC is a nice bump, but it's less than what I've already got

[25-Jun-18 03:20 PM] jansako#3330
Z9 Mini up and running. Setup was not too bad. What would one do without YouTube unboxing videos ðŸ˜ƒ

LOL
I read that and hopped over to COQUI and forked myself off it in 29 seconds ðŸ¤£

[25-Jun-18 06:19 PM] Alright#0419
did you have komodod running?

[25-Jun-18 06:20 PM] Alright#0419
I tried over and over to do that, so if you could somehow replicate that, it'd be appreciated

[25-Jun-18 06:23 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's kinda hard to mine without a daemon ðŸ™„

[25-Jun-18 06:24 PM] Alright#0419
did you have the *komodo* daemon running

[25-Jun-18 06:24 PM] Alright#0419
as in, not just the COQUI daemon

[25-Jun-18 06:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes, among others

[25-Jun-18 06:25 PM] Alright#0419
did it rewind your chain?

[25-Jun-18 06:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I don't think it did yet, but it will

[25-Jun-18 06:25 PM] Alright#0419
will only happen if a notarization tx from the real chain ends up in your mempool I believe

[25-Jun-18 06:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
iirc, the notary should notarize in it's correct position in the chain and the other 200 blocks will be orphaned

[25-Jun-18 06:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess we didnt have enough hash power that day @Alright

[25-Jun-18 06:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
have had a couple of chains on my NN, that got forked and fixed them selvs without me doign anything

[25-Jun-18 06:29 PM] Alright#0419
He just forked it with 11ksol. We tried ~30ksol on each low diff chain
