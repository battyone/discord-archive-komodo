It needs a clean test with 1 guy controlling 1000x and trying to see how much he can increase the average block emission rate

ok, so who has the most hashrate

[03-Aug-19 07:29 PM] SHossain#0007
NH

[03-Aug-19 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean here

[03-Aug-19 07:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
genie probably

in an order from high to low

[03-Aug-19 07:30 PM] kolo#1111
All is nothing compared to NH

[03-Aug-19 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but we only need a 1000x

[03-Aug-19 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
100ksols is enough

[03-Aug-19 07:30 PM] SHossain#0007
kolo has 100k sol

[03-Aug-19 07:30 PM] kolo#1111
I have 95-100ksol

[03-Aug-19 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so you can be ready as soon as diff gets to 200, to activate the ASIC

[03-Aug-19 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
we can then time the duration/blocks to get to the 200k diff

[03-Aug-19 07:32 PM] kolo#1111
Today? Probably not.

[03-Aug-19 07:32 PM] kolo#1111

[03-Aug-19 07:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
ping me when you need the HR

[03-Aug-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it will adjust in 15 minutes

[03-Aug-19 07:32 PM] zawy#5864
OK, with 100k do this:   mine until it reaches 30k then stop.   Wait until last 12 blocks are < 30 sol/s assuming 1 or 2  sol/s is baseline.   Then start again.   Repeat cycle

[03-Aug-19 07:32 PM] SHossain#0007
@mrlynch max 15 mins. i'll ping you

@SHossain I can give you hiveos access

[03-Aug-19 07:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
i can't run the chain rn to check diffs so shossain will have to tell me when to start/stop

you can run if you like. `nSPV` branch

i'll keep the pool open now

[03-Aug-19 07:35 PM] zawy#5864
First stop when difficulty is matcing 20k Sol/s then stop and wait until last 12 difficulties are  < 1 ksol/s, back up to 20k.   That should cause a fast block emission rate

[03-Aug-19 07:36 PM] SHossain#0007
@mrlynch you need to be active for this ^^ 😃

we just need to tell him when

i think normally a CPU would need a couple months

[03-Aug-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
here, each second the e^x is growing fast, x is at 333

[03-Aug-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
the 14k stranding solved at about 380

[03-Aug-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
this needs 20x more, so just guessing a couple more minutes

[03-Aug-19 07:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
this is amazing work

[03-Aug-19 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
actually it is 3^x

[03-Aug-19 07:42 PM] hellcatz#5825
if needed, i have 100Ksol ready to burn electricity...

[03-Aug-19 07:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
it would help.. i only have 70ksols rn

[03-Aug-19 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
384k is a lot more than the 14k, so it takes time for the exponential to catch up

[03-Aug-19 07:44 PM] SHossain#0007

[03-Aug-19 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810

@hellcatz please 30k sol

[03-Aug-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
seems around height 255 ASIC started

[03-Aug-19 07:46 PM] SHossain#0007
70k + 30k makes 100k sol

[03-Aug-19 07:47 PM] zawy#5864
hit it with 100k, but stop when difficulty matches 30k

[03-Aug-19 07:47 PM] hellcatz#5825
ok, i turn off some of the z9m

[03-Aug-19 07:47 PM] zawy#5864
need to turn on and off at same time

[03-Aug-19 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
i think 70k is enough

[03-Aug-19 07:47 PM] SHossain#0007
ASIC started mining from block 235

[03-Aug-19 07:47 PM] zawy#5864
yeah, then stop at 20k

[03-Aug-19 07:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
shossain you need to tune that pool up

[03-Aug-19 07:48 PM] SHossain#0007
what maxdiff?

[03-Aug-19 07:48 PM] zawy#5864
just stop mining when the blocks start slowing down
