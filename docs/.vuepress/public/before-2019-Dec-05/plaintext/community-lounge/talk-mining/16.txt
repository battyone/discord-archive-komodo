np, that's why most of us are here

[03-Jul-18 12:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
I also have a 2.25 ksol rig still running but its pointed at ETH right now doing 150MH/s

[03-Jul-18 12:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
You called it yesterday i think...

[03-Jul-18 12:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
Sunday lol

[03-Jul-18 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I called what do what?

[03-Jul-18 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ü§î

[03-Jul-18 12:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
most in this chat were mining ETH

[03-Jul-18 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
LOL I was being sarcastic üòõ

[03-Jul-18 12:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
its likely true

[03-Jul-18 12:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
ETH 7 day > alts

[03-Jul-18 12:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
i had to swap mine to get a bit more so my deposit will finally credit at POLO and i can stop using them

[03-Jul-18 12:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
they still require min .5 ETH deposits

[03-Jul-18 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The sarcasm part was that, to me, coming in here and asking what everyone is mining is like walking into a Baptist church and asking "So, what religion is everyone in here?" üòõ

[03-Jul-18 12:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
very true lol

[03-Jul-18 12:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
ive been mining KMD forever... but i also have AMD rigs slowly mining ETH that im about to retire so I swapped the Nvidia rigs to help until the last cashout

[03-Jul-18 12:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
hopefully this pool is done by then

[03-Jul-18 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
depending on time of year and markets I mine 10-25 different coins (between sha and GPU)

[03-Jul-18 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
moving more stuff to our other location, so all sha miners are down and only mining KMD, SUPERNET, and COQUI atm

[03-Jul-18 12:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok... build done and komodod server starting

[03-Jul-18 12:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
verifying blocks...

[03-Jul-18 12:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
and nomp is up... waiting to see what happens

[03-Jul-18 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the only thing left is a config issue somewhere (given that you're literally using the same stratum as others and essentially the same as the test I have)

[03-Jul-18 12:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
ill dig more in a bit i have a call

[03-Jul-18 01:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
dumb question: @daemonfox you did set redis up properly, yes?

[03-Jul-18 01:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
i folowed the readme.md steps for both kmd-nomp and z-nomp on git

[03-Jul-18 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
how many KMD peers do you have?

[03-Jul-18 01:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
connections:8

[03-Jul-18 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and you've triple checked that your pool confing and komodo.conf have the same use, pw, and port, yes? and no firewall blocking that port?

[03-Jul-18 01:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes to all

[03-Jul-18 01:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
nomp and komodo are running in the same linux instance

[03-Jul-18 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and you get:
`komodo-cli getmininginfo
{
  "blocks": 905123`

[03-Jul-18 01:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
905124

thats the entire output when running npm start till the error

[03-Jul-18 01:19 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Ah.. mining ETC here.. more profitable and exchanging them for KMD.
Can get way more KMD like this.

[03-Jul-18 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"mining ETC here.. "
And I thank you for doing so üòÉ

[03-Jul-18 01:20 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
If you have been mining KMD forever you have been missing out tons of KMD

[03-Jul-18 01:20 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Why thank me for this?

[03-Jul-18 01:21 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
KMD is so little profitable compared to ETH and ETC.. hence even Ubiq

[03-Jul-18 01:21 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
But... i do buy KMD with the profits :)

[03-Jul-18 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I thank you because I mine on a fairly large scale set up and every person that doesn't mine = more blocks for me (especially all those lovely unclaimed bonus blocks) üòé

[03-Jul-18 01:23 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
I mine on a bedroom scale üòÜ

[03-Jul-18 01:23 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
3 rigs .. alltogether almost 7000sol.. just 3x nothing realy

[03-Jul-18 01:23 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
zpool hit 1 block for 300+ KMD Sunday
and I've hit as high as 1500 KMD in 1 block

[03-Jul-18 01:24 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Been mining at suprnova for KMD.. quit there. Not happy with returns they do

[03-Jul-18 01:26 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Thats lots.. but how much sol/s do you throw at it?

[03-Jul-18 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
atm ~75k

[03-Jul-18 01:26 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
10x me then appr.

[03-Jul-18 01:27 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
30 - 35 rigs?

[03-Jul-18 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
2 GPU rigs and 3 ASICs

[03-Jul-18 01:27 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
??

[03-Jul-18 01:27 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Z9 üòî

[03-Jul-18 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
my GPU rigs are 13 1080TIs each

[03-Jul-18 01:28 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Nice..

[03-Jul-18 01:28 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Here electricity is too expensive.. about to quit.
0.30$ / kwh

[03-Jul-18 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
equihash is still waaaaaaaaaaaaaay cheaper than my sha ASICs cost to run üòõ

[03-Jul-18 01:30 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
For few months maybe..

[03-Jul-18 01:30 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Huge profits with asics but usually doesnt stay long like this i think.

[03-Jul-18 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
370 watts per z9 is cheaper that 1400 watts per S9 every day of every week

[03-Jul-18 01:31 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Thats for sure

[03-Jul-18 01:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
overhead is the thing most stumble on when "planning" an expansion

[03-Jul-18 01:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I've seen more guys buy shit they can't power than I can count

[03-Jul-18 01:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
bingo!

[03-Jul-18 01:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
i think we have a winner

[03-Jul-18 01:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
taken three block notifications and no errors

[03-Jul-18 01:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
GPU shares are being accepted!

[03-Jul-18 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, what'd you do different this time?

[03-Jul-18 01:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
i only did two things since last try...

[03-Jul-18 01:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
1. combed config.json but did not change anything... so i checked pool_configs/komodo.json and corrected the one moderate alert it gave me... payout interval was 58 it said make it 120 so i did and saved.

[03-Jul-18 01:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
2. I flushed redis, reran npm update and npm install

[03-Jul-18 01:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
and now it works... GPU and ASIC

[03-Jul-18 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

That's 5 things üòõ

[03-Jul-18 01:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
so... I have a working pool technically on Windows 10 but using the Ubuntu embedded subsytem to run stratum and komodod

[03-Jul-18 01:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
im just happy it seems to be up...

[03-Jul-18 01:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
would be amazng to catch some nice KMD blocks now

[03-Jul-18 02:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
and now my brain wont let it go... cant prov it now but did the fork i pull have a newer blocktemplate? and did Redis still have that template expectation after i pulled the correct komodo?

[03-Jul-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
My bet, given that it worked after redis dump and the `TypeError: Cannot read property 'miner' of undefined` that it was related to redis

[03-Jul-18 02:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
ill have to settle for that answer and not let it eat at me

[03-Jul-18 02:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
got the blocktemplate error once so far but it kept going...

[03-Jul-18 02:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
twice now...

[03-Jul-18 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_still thinks that running linux as a subsystem of a pile of dogshit is a bad plan_

[03-Jul-18 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and Ubuntu at that ü§¶üèø

[03-Jul-18 02:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
they have Debian as well?!?

[03-Jul-18 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
vbox and vmware has wtf ever you want üòõ

[03-Jul-18 02:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
i know... and i know i can do that easily...

[03-Jul-18 02:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
part of this was to see if Win10 subsytem linux would even handle it

[03-Jul-18 02:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
plus they have 5 distros... Ubuntu 16.04, openSUSE Leap 42, SUSE Linux Enteprise Server, Debian GNU/Linux and Kali linux

[03-Jul-18 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
what one *can* do and what one *should* do are usually not mutually inclusive

[03-Jul-18 02:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
i will agree with you there...

[03-Jul-18 02:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
this is my first successful pool ive put up after a few attempts on other coins

[03-Jul-18 02:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
now to see if I can get it going in gcloud

[03-Jul-18 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
for 100 different reasons, I'm quite pro debian and anti ubuntu. That being said, I'd sooner run a ubuntu box than a debian inside win10 any day of the week

[03-Jul-18 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
tbh, I'd probably pick a 10" chrome lappy over a PC with win 10 üòõ

[03-Jul-18 02:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you can't tell, I have a deep hatred for win10 üòú

[03-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Alright#0419
I run my stratum on a $80 laptop

[03-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Alright#0419
seriously would not recommend doing it with windows like that

[03-Jul-18 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
my 1st stratum was on a 10 year old HP "slimline" running ubuntu
