each of those sites can be profitable if you have a decent strategy or just plan to spec mine something

[12-Jul-19 02:23 PM] Alright#0419
but if you're just blindly renting hash, you're going to lose money

[12-Jul-19 02:24 PM] Alright#0419
recommend using MRR over the other two, nicehash has high diff requirements, meaning you're wasting hashrate if you're mining a (relatively)low diff coin and I haven't used hashtap at all

[12-Jul-19 02:28 PM] Malti#3948
I‚Äôm going to check it out! I was just on the bitcoin.com one and there it just seemed too good to be true

[12-Jul-19 02:28 PM] Malti#3948
And we all know what that means

[12-Jul-19 02:30 PM] Alright#0419
bitcoin.com is pretty reputable, it's ver and his boys

[12-Jul-19 02:30 PM] Alright#0419
maybe it's an outlier ü§∑

[13-Jul-19 02:51 AM] AkiraX#8269

From a local guy

[13-Jul-19 02:57 AM] AkiraX#8269
Hope I didn't get cheated

[13-Jul-19 02:57 AM] AkiraX#8269

[13-Jul-19 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
never used one.

[13-Jul-19 02:58 AM] AkiraX#8269
Oh yeah

[13-Jul-19 02:59 AM] AkiraX#8269
How do you mine labs then?

[13-Jul-19 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IU dont I just stake and notarize

[13-Jul-19 03:06 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
You check by plugging it in and setting it up and try to use it üòõ

[13-Jul-19 03:57 AM] AkiraX#8269
Yeah.  But I'm not home yet

[13-Jul-19 04:04 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Oh right. Well it's hard to know otherwise sorry. You should've gotten them to show you it on

[13-Jul-19 05:27 AM] AkiraX#8269
Yeah. I'm a bit worried because he said he didn't have a power supply

[13-Jul-19 07:40 AM] AkiraX#8269
Ok.  So it powers on with the bitmajn psu from my a9

[13-Jul-19 07:40 AM] AkiraX#8269
But doesn't power using the 850 Watt psu I got

[13-Jul-19 07:56 AM] Alright#0419
@AkiraX is the PSU a desktop PSU or server?

[13-Jul-19 07:56 AM] AkiraX#8269
Desktop psu

[13-Jul-19 07:57 AM] Alright#0419
are you shorting the two pins on that 24pin connector?

[13-Jul-19 07:57 AM] AkiraX#8269
No

[13-Jul-19 07:57 AM] Alright#0419
hold on

[13-Jul-19 07:57 AM] AkiraX#8269
How do I do fhst

[13-Jul-19 07:58 AM] AkiraX#8269
Without dying I mean

[13-Jul-19 07:59 AM] Alright#0419
just google something like ATX power supply short. be 100% sure you're shorting the correct pins

[13-Jul-19 07:59 AM] Alright#0419
it needs 2 pins to be shorted on the 24pin connector in order to turn on

triple check that with some googling before you trust that picture üòÇ

[13-Jul-19 08:12 AM] AkiraX#8269
Thanks

[13-Jul-19 08:12 AM] AkiraX#8269
I'm not dead

[13-Jul-19 08:14 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
You may want to insulate that paperclip a but, to avoid it shorting out when hitting metal or components...

[13-Jul-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Splice and solder it from the back

[13-Jul-19 08:24 AM] AkiraX#8269
ok

[13-Jul-19 08:24 AM] AkiraX#8269
did an arp -a in windows

[13-Jul-19 08:24 AM] AkiraX#8269
i dont see it on the network

[13-Jul-19 08:24 AM] AkiraX#8269
did the reset button

[13-Jul-19 08:27 AM] AkiraX#8269
ok found it

[13-Jul-19 08:36 AM] AkiraX#8269
thanks for your help everyone

[13-Jul-19 08:42 AM] AkiraX#8269
know anywhere to get good working firmware?

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ pointing at your pool

[13-Jul-19 08:05 PM] SHossain#0007
everyone  **ATTN: Pool Operators!** If you are operator or owner of these following pools, please make sure you are running latest Komodo daemon 0.4.0a for KMD and any other assetchains. If you have already updated your pool please let me know, so I can remove your pool from the non-updated list. **REMEMBER: KMD hardupdate is on 15th July which is just about a day and half away.** If you don't update your pool, you will be just wasting your hash. If you need help, please feel free to ask in this channel. Experienced pool operators are here to help you. For the operators that completed this update, please ignore this message. Thank you all.

@SHossain does QT 5.9.7 use the latest KMD daemon 0.4.0a?

[13-Jul-19 08:13 PM] SHossain#0007
do you mean KomodoOceanQT wallet or the QT suite?

[13-Jul-19 08:14 PM] fintechj#4292
KMDOcean from the main site

[13-Jul-19 08:15 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, KomodoOceanQT wallet is already updated and hardupdate ready.

[13-Jul-19 08:19 PM] fintechj#4292
perfect

[13-Jul-19 08:19 PM] fintechj#4292
thanks

[13-Jul-19 08:20 PM] fintechj#4292
how large is the kmd chain right now

[13-Jul-19 08:21 PM] radix42#3743
18 gigs on disk

[13-Jul-19 08:21 PM] radix42#3743
just checked one of my nodes

[13-Jul-19 08:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think it's closer to 12GB, you might be including some asset chains in that

[13-Jul-19 08:25 PM] radix42#3743
nope, no asset chains there

[13-Jul-19 08:26 PM] radix42#3743

@radix42 @dukeleto thanks guys

[13-Jul-19 08:27 PM] fintechj#4292
18GB isn't too bad...

[13-Jul-19 08:45 PM] radix42#3743
naw its not

[13-Jul-19 08:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
$ du -sh ~/Library/Application\ Support/Komodo/blocks/
 11G    /Users/jonathanleto/Library/Application Support/Komodo/blocks/

[13-Jul-19 08:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
you got some big blocks, radix42

[13-Jul-19 09:11 PM] SHossain#0007
`reindex`

[13-Jul-19 09:11 PM] SHossain#0007
or nuke data dir and `resync`

[13-Jul-19 11:10 PM] ca333#0118
the `nodl` could be mining which could explain the diff.

on a non-mining node i get:
```
.komodo du -sh blocks 
12G    blocks
```
on a kmd miner node: 
```
~/.komodo/blocks$ du -sh
18G    .
```

[14-Jul-19 12:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
also depends on which indexes are enabled

[14-Jul-19 09:59 AM] Stratchlayer#0625
Hey
In terms of tx fee, how is KMD protocol ?

[14-Jul-19 11:03 AM] SHossain#0007
KMD and all assetchains has 0.00010000 default txfee

[14-Jul-19 01:54 PM] Stratchlayer#0625
But in BTC or KMD ? Because it's dPoW right ?

[14-Jul-19 01:54 PM] Alright#0419
can send 0 tx fee txes just fine almost always though

[14-Jul-19 01:54 PM] Alright#0419
you pay tx fees in the chain you're using

[14-Jul-19 01:54 PM] Alright#0419
so if an asset has their own chain, you tx fees in that asset

[14-Jul-19 10:49 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
BTC has nothing to do with the average user of Komodo @Stratchlayer 
The only BTC involved is for Notary Nodes to notarise the chain onto the BTC chain.

Hello, this is the third free service plan for voting on the currency.

[15-Jul-19 06:46 AM] CHMEX#0686
what does that mean AN?

[15-Jul-19 11:28 AM] suhthern-girl#8418
Anyone know why Suprnova.cc no longer accepts KMD?

[15-Jul-19 11:33 AM] phm87#7395
@suhthern-girl we should ask to @ocminer (rmh he left the discord)

[15-Jul-19 11:33 AM] phm87#7395
He is on ric freenode channel suprnova

[15-Jul-19 11:33 AM] phm87#7395
And bitcointalk

[15-Jul-19 11:41 AM] suhthern-girl#8418

Weird ... I was not able to tag him

Best and safest wallet for KMD staking?

[15-Jul-19 03:33 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
KMD doesn't have staking

[15-Jul-19 08:23 PM] phm87#7395
CG : no I can @ ocminer  without any problem, maybe it was a temporary bug on discord

[15-Jul-19 08:24 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I was joking üòõ

[16-Jul-19 12:26 PM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
Hey guys. This may be irregular. I'm looking out for a board member for my startup. @CHMEX I'm hoping you'd be interested.

[16-Jul-19 01:00 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
What sort of startup is it? I'm sure there would be some interested people here

[16-Jul-19 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
isn't that for suits?

[16-Jul-19 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
Do any miners in this channel wear a suit regularly? Other than birthday suit @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ , we know you mine `au natural`

[16-Jul-19 02:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hahaha

[16-Jul-19 02:59 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I wear a real suit 50% of the time I'm not home
