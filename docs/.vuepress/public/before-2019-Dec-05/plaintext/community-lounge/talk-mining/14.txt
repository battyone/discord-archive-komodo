@ComputerGenie 
1) the instant you make your anti-ASIC case about a single company and not about ASICs, you've already lost any validity your case might have. 

Suspect the 'you' in this case is not myself personally... cause I am not making an anti-asic case. I am not anti or for ASIC, I buy hardware I think will make me money. My point was that the main 'anti-Bitmain' sentiment is that they are doing shady stuff with hardware. I don't see NVidia or AMD doing that... it is downright silly to think NVidia is running a  bunch of GPU's mining somewhere... But according to the 'info' floating around, Bitmain is doing just that. That is why you cannot compare the two.

2) Why should there be a "why" statement about nothing changing?(edited)

The statement is needed because there are people asking for a change/pushing for change. There is a 'discussion' in a number of coins communities going on whether coins should or should not change because ASICS, and since KMD decided that it will not change, it would put some (notice I said some!) of the 'you all love Bitmain' bullshit to rest. 
More importantly, it would give the mods an ability to just point to an article and stop rehashing the same arguments. Starting with JL who is prbably spending way too muc time on this.

3) In your theory that the algo should change to prevent BM from silently mining on their own, what's to prevent them from adding RAM, mining on their own, and then never releasing just to spite the assholes who changed 2 variables in an attempt to financially hurt BM?
No idea what theory are you talking about... you may be responding to someone else here...

[29-Jun-18 02:41 PM] jansako#3330
sorry, just passing by... will respond in DM a bit later if appropiate

[29-Jun-18 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Well @jansako ,
1) Bitmain practice vs AMD/NV practice is like comparing Ford and Advanced Auto Parts - one makes full units and the other makes chips

[29-Jun-18 02:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
2) no statement will quash any anti-Bitmain/KMD sentiment, because it words, deeds, and reality mattered, Bitmain wouldn't even get a mention

[29-Jun-18 02:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
3) goes to the 1) claim about BM running before selling - there's nothing stopping them from "covertly" creating and **never** selling

[29-Jun-18 02:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I give Bitmain the benefit of the doubt. No one creates a multi-billion dollar business on the back of a revolutionary technology to shoot their cow...

[29-Jun-18 02:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I give BM no benefit, I'm 100% certain that they do shady shit

[29-Jun-18 02:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Especially when the milk is high in fat and great for a ton of dairy products which don't even have companies for them yet.

[29-Jun-18 02:48 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'll give you that, but overall I'd look at them as good actors in today's market.

[29-Jun-18 02:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If BM really wanted to "control" CoinX or AlgoX, they'd never do a release, ever

[29-Jun-18 02:49 PM] BlackJesus#6161
There is literally 0 incentive for them to be extremely bad actors. This industry is budding and they are a major player. Them being bad actors would drive away adoption hurting them more than any profits they could make by being holistically bad.

[29-Jun-18 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
BM could, literally, be making $10,523,520 per day mining BTC in private if they wanted to do that*
*based on a $5800 BTC/USD

[29-Jun-18 02:50 PM] BlackJesus#6161
cryptocurrencies in general have atleast 20-100x growth in them possibly 1000x on the entire market cap.

[29-Jun-18 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Despite all the bullshit and FUD, BM doesn't have 51-100% of any given algo because they don't want 51-100% of that algo

[29-Jun-18 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Outside of the 2,000-3,000 people that own an Avalon, is *anyone* doing any serious mining of BTC that doesn't boil down to BM didn't want that much hash?

[29-Jun-18 03:06 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Many do gpu mining on nicehash to be payed out in btc ..

[29-Jun-18 03:07 PM] BlackJesus#6161
nicehash gives btc alot of buying pressure.

[29-Jun-18 03:07 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I wish they could allow other payouts other than BTC.

[29-Jun-18 03:08 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm just waiting for r/bitcoin vilify them as they have every other BTC company.

[29-Jun-18 03:11 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Awesomeminer does same.. can chose wich coin payout..

Miningpoolhub has autoconvert... mine algo you want payout in algo you want.

[29-Jun-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Nicehash has created the perfect business model - convince suppliers that your cut doesn't matter and convince consumers that even with your cut they are magically making more than if they were a supplier

NVIDIA Launching Next-Generation Graphics Cards At Gamescom 2018
In line with what I reported a few days ago, another major leak has just occurred with details of invites being leaked (via Videocardz) of an NVIDIA event that will be happening around Gamescom and should be the event we have all been waiting for: the launch of their next-gen...

[30-Jun-18 03:11 AM] saltyminer#3228
we have a few z9's running on our pool and they are performing very well

ffs, I wish people would quit spreading roumors

[30-Jun-18 03:12 AM] saltyminer#3228
I think there is a surplus of 10 series cards still in inventory out there

[30-Jun-18 03:13 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
NVIDIA hasn't made chips for them since December and you can still buy 1080s and 1080TIs by the pallet

[30-Jun-18 03:19 AM] saltyminer#3228
anyway, on a more fun note, I am working on building an open source gpu mining monitor app

[30-Jun-18 03:19 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
because the 20000000000000000 that are out there aren't enough?

@ComputerGenie#2331 are mining with nvidia?  Just curious if you use ewbf, dstm, bminer or something else

hey, is the block reward still 3, or has it dropped to 1.5?

the block explorer makes that pretty unclear

it's 3

yo can one of you guys who is using znomp to mine solo join me in the hangout room

[01-Jul-18 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
just ask here

[01-Jul-18 08:14 PM] bishop#9773
I haven't tried it yet, but in theory, if I have agama running locally and setgenerate true, can't I point my miners at the local ip with the rpc user/pw in the config file to mine solo?

[01-Jul-18 08:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, komodod (the daemon behind Agama) lacks the API to mine GPUs and ASICs without a stratum program running as well

[01-Jul-18 08:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
that and stratums are more efficient in handling more than 1 miner than a wallet anyway

[01-Jul-18 08:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
also, `setgenerate true` = CPU mining

[01-Jul-18 08:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I had toyed with the idea of modding the in-wallet tromp to accept an API and essentially add an internal stratum, but for 100 different reasons decided there was no point

[01-Jul-18 08:29 PM] bishop#9773
So you're just pooling up all your hash vs soloing?

[01-Jul-18 08:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
traditional, direct-to-wallet mining (using getwork) pretty much ended for most everything years ago when slush came out with the stratum concept

[01-Jul-18 08:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you find one that has getwork, chances are more than likely that the code was forked from Bitcoin pre-2015

[01-Jul-18 08:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
modern "solo mining" = you in a "pool" by yourself

[01-Jul-18 08:52 PM] bishop#9773
Fair enough, I'll set one up on my node

do you have your komodo config file set to allow daemon connections (and specifically from the IP of your znomp rig)?

queue shouldn't cause a hang up though, just a shit ton of debug errors

usually hang up = garbage send/receive or permission issues

[02-Jul-18 05:56 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
