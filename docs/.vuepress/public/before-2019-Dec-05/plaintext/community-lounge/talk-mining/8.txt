"Where are you getting the emotional attachment from, by the way?"
Because it is only emotional attachment that can create the argument that one should level a parking lot with a hand shovel because some big business could come in with 3 earth-movers and have it done in 2 hrs

[28-Jun-18 11:04 AM] Beetcoin#9049
That was the worst analogy I've heard in a while for how this lends any semblence to the question

[28-Jun-18 11:04 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Also, again, where is the emotional attachment being found?

[28-Jun-18 11:04 AM] Beetcoin#9049
In fact, the opposite is more true if I'm venting about the lack of logic for the lack of mining support

[28-Jun-18 11:04 AM] Beetcoin#9049
I seek to operate

[28-Jun-18 11:05 AM] Beetcoin#9049
That has little to do with emotions.

[28-Jun-18 11:06 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
OK, I'm going to go get my coffee; when I come back you're going to explain to me the "downside" of using $850 ASICs over $875 GPUs and your explanation needs to include 0 anti-Bitmain shit and 0 emotional attachment to GPUs.....

[28-Jun-18 11:06 AM] Beetcoin#9049
I don't "need" to do anything

[28-Jun-18 11:08 AM] Beetcoin#9049
And I don't need to include emotional attachments to GPUs as that is not the case, nor the Anti-Bitmain sentiment, though its likely some deal had been made. The argument, again makes itself. KMD is on equihash, equihash was developed to be ASIC resistant, when given the opportunity to fork and remain ASIC resistant, no real answer comes out of KMD's mouth other than condescension in the line of "Mining accounts for 25% of our network" yada yada.

[28-Jun-18 11:08 AM] Beetcoin#9049
And, again, the issue is the lack of logic behind any statement supporting their decision NOT to fork

[28-Jun-18 11:08 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
You "need" to present a rational claim if you intend to get anywhere with this path you're trying to go down

[28-Jun-18 11:08 AM] Beetcoin#9049
That's the huge piece of the puzzle I"m missing.

[28-Jun-18 11:09 AM] Beetcoin#9049
No, you're sidetracking with bullshit and ignoring the point

[28-Jun-18 11:09 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Which is, where is the logic provided by KMD for not forking?

[28-Jun-18 11:10 AM] Beetcoin#9049
And, in the interest of full transparency, from KMD themselves, do they own any Bitmain ASICs themselves, and have they made an agreement with BItmain?

[28-Jun-18 11:10 AM] Beetcoin#9049
All could easily be addressed without much more time wasted

[28-Jun-18 11:10 AM] Beetcoin#9049
The lack of addressing, is the concern.

[28-Jun-18 11:10 AM] Beetcoin#9049
As pointed out at least four times now.

[28-Jun-18 11:10 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
OK, so that this point, all your claim amounts to is that ASICs shouldn't be because they were originally not meant to be, correct?

[28-Jun-18 11:11 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Please take the time to read the argument or don't comment at all.

[28-Jun-18 11:11 AM] Beetcoin#9049
If that's that conclusion you've come to from my request, you don't need to be wasting my time.

[28-Jun-18 11:11 AM] Beetcoin#9049
I've literally stated it four times already.

[28-Jun-18 11:11 AM] Beetcoin#9049
I wont' be doing it again.

[28-Jun-18 11:12 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I don't read or respond to dumbass, unfounded FUD speculation; so all I got out of the words you wrote are 
your claim amounts to is that ASICs shouldn't be because they were originally not meant to be

[28-Jun-18 11:12 AM] Beetcoin#9049
To be fair, It wasn't until I expressed my concerns that the whole Bitmain deal came to light, as I was delivered that by someone here already on your discord for sometime.

[28-Jun-18 11:13 AM] Beetcoin#9049
I , for the fifth time, came here for a logical reason as to why KMD decided NOT to fork.

[28-Jun-18 11:13 AM] Beetcoin#9049
If the dev team has made one, please present it.

[28-Jun-18 11:13 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
And, in the interest of full transparency, from SAFE themselves have they made an agreement with NVIDIA?

[28-Jun-18 11:13 AM] Beetcoin#9049
All I've been asking

[28-Jun-18 11:13 AM] Beetcoin#9049
What do SAFE or Nvidia have to do with KMD here?

[28-Jun-18 11:13 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
you're pulling shit out your ass

[28-Jun-18 11:13 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Should a coin decide whether or not to fork everytime new GPU's or FPGA's are released?

[28-Jun-18 11:13 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Nothing

[28-Jun-18 11:14 AM] Beetcoin#9049
It could

[28-Jun-18 11:14 AM] Beetcoin#9049
That's the point of democratization with Equihash.

[28-Jun-18 11:14 AM] Beetcoin#9049
I have pulled nothing out of my ass, @ComputerGenie

[28-Jun-18 11:14 AM] Beetcoin#9049
I'll ask that you take a deep breath and start reading.

[28-Jun-18 11:14 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"What do SAFE or Nvidia have to do with KMD here?"
About the same as pretending that Bitmain is the only ASIC maker or has any place in this conversation

[28-Jun-18 11:15 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Did I ever once pretend that Bitmain was the only ASIC maker?

[28-Jun-18 11:15 AM] Beetcoin#9049
And they certainly do have a place in this conversation

[28-Jun-18 11:15 AM] Beetcoin#9049
As this conversation is about ASICS

[28-Jun-18 11:15 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
oh ffs

[28-Jun-18 11:15 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Feel free to stop responding at any time

[28-Jun-18 11:15 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Again, for the sixth time now, I'm looking for a response from KMD that provides the logic for their reasoning NOT to fork.

[28-Jun-18 11:15 AM] Beetcoin#9049
If you could provide that, that would be great.

[28-Jun-18 11:15 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
dude you need to go back to wtf ever troll hole you climbed out of and stop tagging me for dumb shit at 1am

[28-Jun-18 11:16 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Maybe you shouldn't say dumb shit, then?

[28-Jun-18 11:16 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
1) KMD isn't forking because there's no need to fork
2) see 1

[28-Jun-18 11:17 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Awesome, heard that story already, would love the reasoning behind it.

[28-Jun-18 11:17 AM] Beetcoin#9049
If you don't have it, please don't talk for the team themselves.

[28-Jun-18 11:18 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
The reasoning behind not filling your car with gas when you pass a new gas station is what?

[28-Jun-18 11:18 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Actually for that analogy to work, you'd be not filling your gas tank with 87, and instead using 91, though your car doesn't require 91.

[28-Jun-18 11:19 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Also, with next to no improvement in performance, I might add.

[28-Jun-18 11:19 AM] Beetcoin#9049
In case you also had no idea how cars work.

[28-Jun-18 11:19 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
no car "requires" 91 octane

[28-Jun-18 11:19 AM] Beetcoin#9049
There are many that do

[28-Jun-18 11:19 AM] Beetcoin#9049
🤦

[28-Jun-18 11:19 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
OMFG

[28-Jun-18 11:19 AM] Beetcoin#9049
You can't be this stupid

[28-Jun-18 11:19 AM] Beetcoin#9049
BMW, Mercedes, Acura

[28-Jun-18 11:19 AM] Beetcoin#9049
All require 91.

[28-Jun-18 11:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241

suggesting and requiring; please use a dictionary for these 2 words before you attempt to speak to me again

[28-Jun-18 11:20 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Go own one of them, read their manuals, most actually suggest not to use 87 because of reduced performance

[28-Jun-18 11:21 AM] Beetcoin#9049
I guess owning one would improve your knowledge of that.

[28-Jun-18 11:21 AM] Beetcoin#9049
🤷

[28-Jun-18 11:21 AM] Beetcoin#9049
@NutellaLicka thank you, I suppose that's the only route one might have to go here.

[28-Jun-18 11:21 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"suggest " IS NOT "require"

[28-Jun-18 11:22 AM] Beetcoin#9049
By suggsting that you NOT use less than 91, isn't that the same as require in semantics?

[28-Jun-18 11:22 AM] Beetcoin#9049
And yes, there are in fact cars that REQUIRE 91+

[28-Jun-18 11:22 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"By suggsting that you NOT use less than 91, isn't that the same as require in semantics?"
again I say:
suggesting and requiring; please use a dictionary for these 2 words before you attempt to speak to me again

[28-Jun-18 11:22 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I mean, you are more likely to speak to one of the team and get a good response by doing that, rather than having nonsensical discussions with us on here.

[28-Jun-18 11:23 AM] Beetcoin#9049
As long as computergenie is the key respondent here, I suppose they would all be nonsensical, no?

[28-Jun-18 11:23 AM] Beetcoin#9049
He apparently believes there isn't a car on earth where 91 is required

[28-Jun-18 11:23 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Have you seen a Ferrari? Lambo? Porsche?

[28-Jun-18 11:23 AM] Beetcoin#9049
McLaren?

[28-Jun-18 11:23 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Required.

[28-Jun-18 11:23 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Perhaps a Lotus?

[28-Jun-18 11:23 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Ariel?

A little snippet "Up until the last few years, just a handful of cars had 91 octane requirements versus 91 octane recommendations. High performance cars like the BMW M3 and the Audi S4 required 91 octane, and the engine management system was so calibrated toward high performance that running lower octane fuel was detrimental to the engine’s health."

[28-Jun-18 11:24 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
as a 4th generation mechanic, I know that there are NO cars that REQUIRE x octane; because, internal combustion hasn't advance (other than injection) since the advent of a V block

[28-Jun-18 11:25 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Wrong

[28-Jun-18 11:25 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Could I suggest you guys take this to the #talk-other-topics forums please!

[28-Jun-18 11:25 AM] Beetcoin#9049
I mean, I'm good with refraining from responding, so long as he admits that statement about being a 4th generation mechanic and yada yada about there being no cars that rerquire 91, was wrong.

[28-Jun-18 11:26 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
On-topic:
1) KMD isn't forking because there's no need to fork
2) see 1

[28-Jun-18 11:26 AM] Beetcoin#9049
3) there are cars that require 91

[28-Jun-18 11:26 AM] Beetcoin#9049
😉

[28-Jun-18 12:35 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@Beetcoin there’s 0 reason to fork KMD. Because of dPoW, the notaries mine 75% of the blocks so there is asic resistance. But @ComputerGenie he is right about fuel octane. My car is tuned specifically for 93 and e85

[28-Jun-18 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
It's just sad what consumers don't know about the products they purchase 🤦🏿

[28-Jun-18 12:37 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Like a BMW M series requiring......91 @ComputerGenie ? 😄

[28-Jun-18 12:38 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Thank you @xRobeSx but I suppose I was looking for a breakdown of the logic behind the lack of forking, rather than yet another "quick" reason of not forking.

[28-Jun-18 12:38 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Its actually the same answer, though less condescending, as the 25% of the network are miners bit.

[28-Jun-18 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Beetcoin What if I told you that, globally, there are 14 different octane measurement "standards" and the number `91` means 9 different things.....

[28-Jun-18 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
stop tagging me with dumb off-topic shit

[28-Jun-18 12:41 PM] Beetcoin#9049
You're the one that brought it up!

[28-Jun-18 12:41 PM] Beetcoin#9049
And what if I told you I already know about octane ratings, likely for the same reason @xRobeSx does?

[28-Jun-18 12:42 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Please don't hit enter with some back pedal bullshit CG

[28-Jun-18 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"You're the one that brought it up!"
At no point, in my entire feken life, was I the one that brought "octane" (a feken feul ADDITIVE) up 🤦🏿

[28-Jun-18 12:42 PM] Beetcoin#9049
You brought up the gas station analogy
