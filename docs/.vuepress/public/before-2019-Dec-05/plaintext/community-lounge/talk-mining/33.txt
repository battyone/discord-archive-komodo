a 14x block is still pretty damn sweet

yea I got pretty excited hah

@webworker01 After trying your script, I found an err in my magic code

[03-Aug-18 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
using printf, leading 0s are truncated, so the len is less than 8 to start with and the coin file ends up with a blank for magic

[03-Aug-18 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
e.g.:
`$ printf '%x\n' $(~/komodo/src/komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX getinfo | jq '.magic')
ace51e0
$ printf '%x\n' $(~/komodo/src/komodo-cli -ac_name=WLC getinfo | jq '.magic')

hey

[06-Aug-18 09:25 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
cant seem to get kmd to launch in my znomp

[06-Aug-18 09:25 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
ive got it set up the same way as all the others

[06-Aug-18 09:34 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
@Cryptoon any tips?

[06-Aug-18 09:34 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
i thought it might be max coins suported by znomp so i turned 1 off and kmd on and still didnt show but the other coin was removed

[06-Aug-18 09:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I am a mining noob, I just know most of the mining stuff happens here :p

[06-Aug-18 09:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@ComputerGenie  is the mining wizard extra ordinaire, although @blackjok3r  @jansako @xRobeSx and others might also know a thing or two

[06-Aug-18 09:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But think they are in different timezones and getting some sleep atm

[06-Aug-18 09:37 AM] jansako#3330
@CryptoWrench  what are 'the others', and what errors/issues are you seeing?

[06-Aug-18 09:37 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
thats the thing no errors lol

[06-Aug-18 09:37 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
but

[06-Aug-18 09:38 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
other coins are zen,vote,zcl,btcz,xsg,btcp and zel

[06-Aug-18 09:38 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
all from 1 instance

[06-Aug-18 09:38 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
i put the kmd config to true and start pool and it just doesnt show but also doesnt show an error lol

[06-Aug-18 09:39 AM] jansako#3330
OK... are you able to shut down the other pools, and only start KMD? maybe there is an error, just goes by too fast?

[06-Aug-18 09:39 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
ill look through npm log i think

[06-Aug-18 09:39 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
because people are mining those other coins

[06-Aug-18 09:39 AM] jansako#3330
are you using the 'default' config, or edited?

[06-Aug-18 09:39 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
i had my

[06-Aug-18 09:40 AM] jansako#3330

i was going to say maybe pm2 started a dif znomp directory where that file isnt onfiged

[06-Aug-18 09:43 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
configed

[06-Aug-18 09:43 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
but thats the right directory its running from and thats where i made the changes

[06-Aug-18 09:43 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
and when i turned btcp off from that directory it left the pool

[06-Aug-18 09:45 AM] jansako#3330
that a went a bit over my head... sorry. I run a kmd + assetchains pool only

[06-Aug-18 09:45 AM] jansako#3330
can you first double check you kmd daemon is fully synced?

[06-Aug-18 09:46 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
yeah it finished a bit ago

[06-Aug-18 09:46 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
and i pulled some new addreses from it

@jansako thanks because of you i took a second loom at the config lol

[06-Aug-18 02:09 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Thanks to the the people mining on http://pool.komodo.services.  I just disabled assetchains for the time being, except for MGNX.  I'm running into some issues with certain assetchains and the payouts not working properly. Komodo is still available.

ya, there's definitely some staking of the premine going on

[06-Aug-18 02:55 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Definitely, I've seen you pointing it out days ago

_sees that @Decker got his 50k days ago..._

@Vertigo you'll need to download mining software on your computer. google equihash miner.  then go to http://pool.komodo.services

[07-Aug-18 12:38 AM] Vertigo#0439
Oh ok i downloaded claymore already but is ok where to download equihash?

[07-Aug-18 12:42 AM] Vertigo#0439
Is this optimized for AMD cards too?

@Vertigo Hi! As example - you can find a Claymore Equilhash miner for AMD GPUs in this thread : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1670733.0. It's the most popular one so far.
