it'll likely be 3-4 weeks before it's where I want it (with mm profit switcher and other bells and whistles)

All of them are already being mined

[01-Aug-18 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But they are being mined really far away from me

[01-Aug-18 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you mine them, then you have microseconds headstart on notarizing them; because, P2P

[01-Aug-18 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught about this a long time ago... Thats why o tried mining RFOX

[01-Aug-18 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but ü§¶  I had RFOX set at freq.2 instead of .10 so it still didnt notarize it

[01-Aug-18 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
that being said, these comments are for educational purposes and I don't condone gaming the system üòÉ

[01-Aug-18 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its a competition

[01-Aug-18 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and I have shared everything I have found so far

[01-Aug-18 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, from a technical standpoint, mining empty blocks in an on-demand chain is "spam"

[01-Aug-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sombody else is already doing it

[01-Aug-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats why I did RFOX first... because thats not Ondemand chain

[01-Aug-18 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

well, specifically mining SN didn't; I did make a ton arbitraging SN

[01-Aug-18 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was pretty supid not to do that whole arb thing from NXT to Bdex... üò¶ I made a fair bit on some DEX ~2-3k AUD I think in one trade. lol

[01-Aug-18 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I never messed  with NXT, all my arb was purely on bdex

[02-Aug-18 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, you have a couple-few weeks before I hit them with anything more than 1-3 1080Tis

[02-Aug-18 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
hell, it may be even a week before stratum is right enough to hit them at all

[02-Aug-18 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am only mining dead chains with CPU... did it mostly as a test to prove something one way or the other.

[02-Aug-18 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Definitavly proved it... but dont really want to keep doing it.. Will see what happens when more people start minign AC.

[02-Aug-18 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
1 thing I am sure of:
Joe Shit-PCowner isn't going to run stratum worth a damn on his home DSL
ü§£

[02-Aug-18 04:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol no.... I am on very very good internet on my stratum,  surprising how little RAM/CPU it uses though

[02-Aug-18 04:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
resting state of ACs is 7.4G RAM üòõ

[02-Aug-18 04:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
16GB for all AC and stratum, and ~17 instances of miner

[02-Aug-18 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I put 16 in readme as a **minimum** and 24 as "min recommended"

[02-Aug-18 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
internet bandwidth use is very low... assume you need good ping

32GB there using half

[02-Aug-18 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, from the strat release standpoint, the readme needs to include syncing chains too

[02-Aug-18 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... The main reason I left 16 cores on my Notary node was just incase I needed to resync something

[02-Aug-18 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and the addition of new chains

[02-Aug-18 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It would easily run on 4

[02-Aug-18 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I put quad as min and 6 as min recommended

[02-Aug-18 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that would work ok... 95% of that load is miners

[02-Aug-18 04:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Although I dont need to resync on notary node VM, as it pulls the entire KMD +AC chains from that VM over NFS into a ram disk üòõ

[02-Aug-18 04:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
5m load time isnt bad at all

[02-Aug-18 04:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
resets all wallet.dat in the process

+ they have option of sending to their  farm

[03-Aug-18 10:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
seems 2x more efficient than the z9

[03-Aug-18 10:47 AM] jansako#3330
Dunno... for $20k you can get 20 z9mini's, with power sources. They will hash ~300 kSols, and use 8kW, but the electricity cost difference is negligible at that level.

[03-Aug-18 10:48 AM] jansako#3330
Even if you can OC it at +50%, still better off with the mini's if you have the space. Granted, you need more infrastructure for that kind of setup

[03-Aug-18 11:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
does anyone who sells z9s have a farm you can send them to work at?

[03-Aug-18 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`seems 2x more efficient than the z9`
until you realized that minis are $8,700 less in cost per 160k sols

[03-Aug-18 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
or like jansako said that for the cost of that Zeon, you can get 367K sols worth of Z9

volume beats efficiency every time

[03-Aug-18 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
oh, and I forgot to mention that 23 minis do, in fact, take up 2.9x the amount of shelf space of 1 Zeon, though

[03-Aug-18 01:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
is that mining kmd? Or mining zec and selling to buy kmd btw üòõ

[03-Aug-18 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think they said ZEC, I forget tbh, and they didn't show actual math of how they got those numbers

[03-Aug-18 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
those being cost and income

[03-Aug-18 01:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
When is the Z9 coming out? September?

[03-Aug-18 01:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
iirc 1st week of Sept

[03-Aug-18 01:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And that was 2k usd?

[03-Aug-18 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I forget, without factual board specs to compare to minis I wasn't interested

[03-Aug-18 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I do know that per advertised hash of z9 vs irl hash of minis, the price difference is nominal

[03-Aug-18 01:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah I'm trying to look but the bitmain site seems down atm

[03-Aug-18 01:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I thought value/usd was slightly better for Z9, but not sure

[03-Aug-18 01:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
value for Z9 vs mini is "better" if, and only if, the assumption holds true that the z9 has 4x chips

[03-Aug-18 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
however, if the Z9 has less chips that are already OCed, then minis are greater in value

[03-Aug-18 01:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
gamble that they hold more chips?

[03-Aug-18 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The chance that the Z9 has more chips than 4x the mini and those chips are underclocked is an infinitesimal chance at best

[03-Aug-18 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
from a manufacturing standpoint, the only 2 real options are:
Z9 has 4x chips
Z9 has less chips and those chips are running at a higher multiplier than that of the minis

Given those choices, it stands to reason that the manufacturer's better option for higher profit yields is the latter
