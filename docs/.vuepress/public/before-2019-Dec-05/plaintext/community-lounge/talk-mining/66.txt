also, fwi, cards that old are generally not worth mining with anymore

[05-Nov-18 10:09 PM] Seek#0355
Wow so one card takes 500W per hour? RIP

[05-Nov-18 10:10 PM] Seek#0355
How does one make profit mining lol

[05-Nov-18 10:10 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
most modern GPUs use 1/2 that electric and produce much more hash/sols

[05-Nov-18 10:10 PM] Seek#0355
Could you suggest me one pls

[05-Nov-18 10:12 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
in the equihash realm, I'd suggest an ASIC fro KMD and any other 200,9 coin and a 2080 or 2080TI for any other equihash coin

[05-Nov-18 10:14 PM] Seek#0355
If I were to start off with just 1 gpu, would I make profit? I mean am looking to make little everyday for my roi. The mining calculators give me a nightmare

[05-Nov-18 10:15 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
if you get one of the new 2080s and use it on one of the non200,9 coins, you could likely make a decent profit, but ASIC dominate the 200,9 coins

[05-Nov-18 10:17 PM] Seek#0355
I will google and find what all those terminologies mean lol ty

[05-Nov-18 10:18 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
the equihash algo has variables (K & N) and 200,9 are the "standard" and some coins use other numbers

[05-Nov-18 10:18 PM] barahh#4528
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  the z9 mini can mine 200/9 algo?

[05-Nov-18 10:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
yes, that's all they can mine

[05-Nov-18 10:20 PM] barahh#4528
this is standard equihash algo ... 200/9

[05-Nov-18 10:22 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
well that much of equihash is stupid (why K & N "matters"), imo; but I'm tired of beating that horse

[05-Nov-18 10:36 PM] Seek#0355
Hey computer genie, I‚Äôm sorry to bother you. Ive sent you a message regarding a mining advice, would you be able to help me pls if u have time

[05-Nov-18 11:32 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
Are these z9 mini's all sold out? can't find them on the bitmain site..

Hi all, just trying to get started "miner --algo ??? --server stratum.piratepool.io --port 2095 --user zAddressHere.Rig1 --pass x --fee 0 --intensity 50" wondering what I need to put in the algo field? I'm currently testing with ccminer

[06-Nov-18 04:27 AM] Tronodisc#3942
After seeing the few posts above mine I can see 200/9, so thinking I need to add 200_9 but was looking for confirmation on this or what others are using that works

[06-Nov-18 04:30 AM] Tronodisc#3942
Just tried and 200_9 fails for me...tried 192_7 earlier and it at least runs but I can't see any shares or immature after I'd left it to run for 20mins or so

[06-Nov-18 05:07 AM] Tronodisc#3942
Is anyone there?

[06-Nov-18 09:06 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@Tronodisc `-a equihash` for ccminer (as per https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/blob/windows/README.txt)

[06-Nov-18 05:01 PM] Hermes#6934
will you use a webpage to sell it?

[06-Nov-18 05:38 PM] FishyGuts#5085

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ any input?

[06-Nov-18 05:50 PM] SHossain#0007
i connected a fan on fan2 port which i guess was malfunctioning and fried the fan controller.

[06-Nov-18 06:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
That's exactly what happened to my batch 1

[06-Nov-18 06:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Get in touch with bitmain asap they will send you a new one.

[06-Nov-18 06:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Same, I connected a second fan to the board and the board just gave up afterwards

[07-Nov-18 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810

@BlackJesus when you say you got em...

[07-Nov-18 03:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Did he do a deal with you?

[07-Nov-18 03:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
May want to reconsider.

[07-Nov-18 03:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@lionfurry -

[07-Nov-18 03:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yep.

[07-Nov-18 03:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I hope you didn't close a deal with him @BlackJesus

[07-Nov-18 03:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
OTC needs to die.  Lol.

[07-Nov-18 03:26 PM] BlackJesus#6161

[07-Nov-18 03:26 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'll never do coinspayment again

[07-Nov-18 03:28 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm too trusting we honestly just need a private chat of vetted people for otc

[07-Nov-18 05:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I declined coin payments and wanted to escrow with shossain.

[07-Nov-18 05:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Did you give Him your phone number ?  Make sure to have your provider on. Notice not to port your number.

[07-Nov-18 05:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The fact is... if you‚Äôre not trusted.... the only ya do business is with escrow.   And even then.   It makes sense to use one anyway.

[07-Nov-18 05:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Bummer.   I was going to give one away for Pirate.

[07-Nov-18 06:38 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yeah my phone is locked so it isn't a problem it's password protected by a human

[07-Nov-18 06:39 PM] BlackJesus#6161

I launch and then try to get z_addy and get that error

[08-Nov-18 08:44 PM] Hermes#6934
That could be a simple error of your machine blocking the Komodod process that runs in the background...

[08-Nov-18 08:45 PM] Hermes#6934
Check your AV or Firewall...and see in the task manager if Komodod is being launched..or if it stops by any of these scenarios.

[09-Nov-18 02:18 PM] Chinezupwnz#2334
430 Sol/s is 43 h/s

[09-Nov-18 02:18 PM] Chinezupwnz#2334
right?

[09-Nov-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sol = h

[09-Nov-18 02:19 PM] Chinezupwnz#2334
then for my tests i have the following 1 card 1070 that has 430sol/s running atm and if i go on whatotime it says 43 h/s

[09-Nov-18 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
using wtm sucks for newbies because they have moved equihash to ASIC category (which assumes user knows their hashrate)

[09-Nov-18 02:28 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@Chinezupwnz zhash is not equihash and is not equivlient
