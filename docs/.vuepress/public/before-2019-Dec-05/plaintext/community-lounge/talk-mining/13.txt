running a node has a cost

[29-Jun-18 11:38 AM] OsTa#2589
and those guy are elected

[29-Jun-18 11:38 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
I run ETC full node.. not difficult :)

[29-Jun-18 11:38 AM] OsTa#2589
some of them give a part of their benefit for those who voting for them

[29-Jun-18 11:38 AM] OsTa#2589
lol it's not the same thing

[29-Jun-18 11:39 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
A node is a node?

[29-Jun-18 11:39 AM] OsTa#2589
it's open to anyone

[29-Jun-18 11:40 AM] OsTa#2589
(to be elected)

[29-Jun-18 11:40 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
What level of technical skill do you need?
Hope not phd level coding..

[29-Jun-18 11:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @[TPUX] Djith Wattignies  A  notary node is different than a full node.

[29-Jun-18 11:41 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
As im looking to abandone mining due to high elec rates.. masternodes, staking and supporting networks would be my thing.
Together with hodl/trading

[29-Jun-18 11:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Why don't you have a look in the #notarynode channel.

[29-Jun-18 11:42 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Allright

[29-Jun-18 11:43 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Ok.. my first fail üòÇ
CPU: A good CPU (Xeon/i7)RAM: 64GB

[29-Jun-18 11:44 AM] CrisF#3405
You'd want a server.

[29-Jun-18 11:45 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Interested..
I succeeded to learn how to setup ubuntu 18.04 from scratch.. setting up ETC node and mining komodo on it.
Never seen linux before .. was interesting learning curve

[29-Jun-18 11:45 AM] CrisF#3405
As you look into it more you might find the NNs work pretyy hard to earn their mining rewards.

[29-Jun-18 11:45 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Yeah server would be nice

[29-Jun-18 11:45 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Then it is deserved and well earned

[29-Jun-18 11:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Look around some more and I figure you might find somethings you like.  There is a lot on offer here.

[29-Jun-18 11:47 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
I will.. and will have a good look at it.
Will take my time a bit too to get a good hold on it.

[29-Jun-18 11:47 AM] CrisF#3405
The white paper has a lot of interesting details.

[29-Jun-18 11:47 AM] jorian#4555
it's not about the rewards someone becomes a notary. Notaries secure the KMD network and its assetchains. And GameCredits as of a month ago

[29-Jun-18 11:48 AM] jorian#4555
not at all only economic

[29-Jun-18 11:48 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes üëÜ

[29-Jun-18 11:48 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
I do support ETC with a node now.. interested to do the same with KMD

[29-Jun-18 11:49 AM] jorian#4555
elections are somewhere early 2019

[29-Jun-18 11:49 AM] jorian#4555
around 30 places will be newly elected

[29-Jun-18 11:49 AM] jorian#4555
if the community deems you a worthy notary, you are elected

[29-Jun-18 11:49 AM] jorian#4555
and you help protect and secure the KMD platform

[29-Jun-18 11:49 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Cool.. by then i might have the hardware..

Now i just have a dual core intel with 8gb ddr3 ram on offer with just a 120ssd üòÇüòÇ

[29-Jun-18 11:50 AM] jorian#4555
most rent a server somewhere

[29-Jun-18 11:50 AM] jorian#4555
you can check github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes for a list

[29-Jun-18 11:50 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Possible .. but i want my own.

[29-Jun-18 11:50 AM] jorian#4555
of hardware

[29-Jun-18 11:52 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
CPU: A good CPU (Xeon/i7)RAM: 64GBDisk: 500GB SSDBandwidth: 100Mbps

Very much ok to get that..

[29-Jun-18 11:53 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
But.. how much processor cache needed?

[29-Jun-18 11:53 AM] jorian#4555
#notarynode to get an idea of what we do

[29-Jun-18 11:54 AM] jorian#4555
you can be notary on any cpu, as long as its powerful. it's your own decision, since when your node has performed better than average, you are automatically re-elected for the new period

@jansako - Today at 5:57 AM
`those are not good examples. Intel or Nvidia is not going to be running their hardware before it starts selling it (I don't know if Bitmain does or does not). Still think a clear and concise statement from the KMD team would go a long way. Just to address the 'why'.`
1) the instant you make your anti-ASIC case about a single company and not about ASICs, you've already lost any validity your case might have.
2) Why should there be a "why" statement about nothing changing?

[29-Jun-18 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
3) In your theory that the algo should change to prevent BM from silently mining on their own, what's to prevent them from adding RAM, mining on their own, and then never releasing just to spite the assholes who changed 2 variables in an attempt to financially hurt BM?

[29-Jun-18 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I've yet to see a single coin make an anti-ASIC change to 144,5 (or any other K & N values) that the majority of the reason wasn't just a bunch of "fuk Shitmain" and not much else

[29-Jun-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
but what about the borg?

[29-Jun-18 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
borg?

[29-Jun-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the only valid anti-ASIC theory i heard. bitmain perfected the mind control and anybody that buys their ASIC becomes mind controlled

[29-Jun-18 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
LMFAO

[29-Jun-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
probably you need to plug in the ASIC first though before the mind control kicks in

[29-Jun-18 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
this is really the most viable anti-ASIC argument I have heard

[29-Jun-18 12:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I can *almost* see the "well, equihash was meant to be anti ASIC" claim, but even that falls flat because it's still the same thing - it's all about RAM cost

[29-Jun-18 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
a $1.5M+ cost to market, do people really believe that ASIC makers are just going to say "oh well, we lost on that one; just scrap it all" as opposed to, worst case, spending $90k to add RAM and private mine to recoup their losses?

[29-Jun-18 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
imo, the move to exclude all AMD miners, and pretty much anyone with an NVIDIA older than a 1050, is pure insanity

[29-Jun-18 01:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
especially when the claim is usually "everyone has a GPU".... Guess what, Skippy, "everyone" doesn't have $1k per to drop on a high-end GPU that is 2+ years old and costs more than when it was released

[29-Jun-18 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_gets off his soapbox and goes to get coffee_

[29-Jun-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
why not prevent GPU usage too. only CPU mining!

[29-Jun-18 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
CPU bad because I only have 90 cores

[29-Jun-18 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
üòõ

[29-Jun-18 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
tbh, @jl777c I think that if ASUS came out with a 13CPU board or a "CPU riser" there might could be the same fervor for CPU as GPU

[29-Jun-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
isnt a GPU really just an ASIC customized for "graphics" calculations. so really the anti-ASIC seems to be about "anti-hardware i dont have"

[29-Jun-18 01:22 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
üòÇ .. true üòê

[29-Jun-18 01:29 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Guess this cpu would be great for NN 

Intel Xeon E3-1270V6 3.8GHz 8MB Box processor

[29-Jun-18 01:30 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Have a mobo on wich it would fit.. just need to add 64Gb ram and a +500ssd

[29-Jun-18 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`so really the anti-ASIC seems to be about "anti-hardware i dont have"`
*"anti-hardware i dont have because I hate 1 of the 3 companies that makes that hardware"

[29-Jun-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
until you get the evil hardware,then the borg controls activate

[29-Jun-18 01:56 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
What is this borg story?? ü§£

[29-Jun-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
be careful with buying bitmain ASIC, it has mind control tech from the future making all of people who buy it into onemind to 51% attack all chains when you least expect it. essentially if you have bitmain ASIC you are part of a single centralized collective that acts as one. so the theory goes

[29-Jun-18 02:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
And they have a hidden worm that can take over your ASIC if the mind control fails, right?

[29-Jun-18 02:00 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
üëÄ

[29-Jun-18 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the mind control never fails

[29-Jun-18 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the controlled dont even know they are controlled

[29-Jun-18 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
I bet you dont feel any different even after overclocking the ASIC

[29-Jun-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
this is almost like proof of the borg theory

[29-Jun-18 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The mind control thing makes me LOL almost as much as the theory that "Antbleed" is a "hidden back door" and not just lazy feks not removing unfinished code from S7 firmware before churing out S9s

[29-Jun-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"I bet you dont feel any different even after overclocking the ASIC"
I didn't "feel" any different, but my wallet sure is fatter üòõ

[29-Jun-18 02:03 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Most evil hardware might be smartphones according to me

[29-Jun-18 02:04 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
But everyone loves them

[29-Jun-18 02:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_has never owned a "smartphone"_

[29-Jun-18 02:04 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Hmm.. good :)

[29-Jun-18 02:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_still uses a flip-phone_

"i dont have any phone"
you anti-tech heathen

[29-Jun-18 02:05 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Got one from work.. obligatory to be used.. iphone 6plus
And my own.. samsung s7

[29-Jun-18 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
S5 with custom andrid... has most of the bad stuff taken out but I would rather not have it.

[29-Jun-18 02:06 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
So im üî©

[29-Jun-18 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
When I find a **phone** that's worth more than $50, I'll *think* about buying one

{Reactions}
üòÇ 

[29-Jun-18 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Pay $0 for all mine..

[29-Jun-18 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
get them free when others upgrade.. but doubtful I will go any higher than an S5.

[29-Jun-18 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Pay $0 for all mine.."
And your monthly bill to use that "free" phone is....

[29-Jun-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
way too much....  going pre-paid as soon as contract is over this time.

[29-Jun-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
litterally never use the thing unless i I am traveling

[29-Jun-18 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_paid $35 per phone and pays $20 per month to use them_

[29-Jun-18 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
because it's a feken phone üòõ

[29-Jun-18 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I've got enough PCs at home, I don't need to carry one with me everywhere I go

[29-Jun-18 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Now, build a smartphone that can mine 15+ KMD per day and I might buy a few

[29-Jun-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
bitmain smartphones!

[29-Jun-18 02:23 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
to really sell it, you need a photoshopped "exclusive" prototype image
