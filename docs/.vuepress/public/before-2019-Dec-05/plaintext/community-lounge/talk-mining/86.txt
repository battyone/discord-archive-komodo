Hmm, compiling 7.3. gcc since gcc in CentOS repos is old as heck

[12-Dec-18 03:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Not sure if delete this option is safe

[12-Dec-18 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's what I do for debian 8.9

[12-Dec-18 03:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, if not safe, then my server has been feked since VRSC came out

[12-Dec-18 03:37 PM] TonyL#3577
I don't know what this flag actually do, but usually my assumptions are something like a: "hmm if somebody put it here and its worked before it should be a necessary thing" 😃

[12-Dec-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a non-critical warning

[12-Dec-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
but it might indicate a bug in the code to get such a warning

[12-Dec-18 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but it might indicate a bug in the code to get such a warning`
Not sure it's really a "bug" to code for gcc530+

[12-Dec-18 03:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pretty much, it means
"You're using some old shit that doesn't understand what the new shit has"

[12-Dec-18 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but cleanly written code should compile without warnings for many generations of compilers

[12-Dec-18 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my guess is that someone adopted the "2014 is dead and people should at least have advanced to 2015 by 2018" philosophy in not adding a check

[12-Dec-18 03:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Gosh this gcc building almost 1 hour already on the same machine on which komodod building in 15 minutes or so

[12-Dec-18 04:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
next time don't build with 1 core? :trollface:

[12-Dec-18 04:46 PM] djwillz24#9542
Can anyone help me set up mining kmd I'm clueless where to start or what pools I'd join

[12-Dec-18 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@djwillz24 
Let's start with the basics...
What are you mining with?

[12-Dec-18 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
i.e. what hardware?

[12-Dec-18 04:51 PM] djwillz24#9542
Just a 1060 i7 7700 buddy I know it's not going to be profitable but just for testing purposes etc and slow gains it's free electric I don't pay

[12-Dec-18 04:51 PM] djwillz24#9542
6gb 1060

[12-Dec-18 04:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, the 1st thing you need is a miner app
my personal preference is EWBF's 0.3.4b (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1707546.0)

[12-Dec-18 04:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

What minning pool do u suggest?

[12-Dec-18 05:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
really, all you can do is look at them and see what meets your wants
Do you like the look?
Do you prefer feature x?
etc...
If they are working properly, personal preference is the only thing that separates one from another

[12-Dec-18 05:04 PM] PTYX#6840
They all pay roughly the same @djwillz24 so like genie says, it comes down to personal preference

thanks. please keep us updated with fix

[12-Dec-18 06:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, now just have to  update   `libstdc++` somehow for our  fresh gcc

[12-Dec-18 06:33 PM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain This env var resolved an issue with not visible custom compiled libs for new gcc: ```export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib64:/usr/lib64
```
So now on my side Komodo is synching on ```CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core)```

which curl you use to install in debian?

for komodo compiling

[12-Dec-18 11:17 PM] SHossain#0007
please post the command

[12-Dec-18 11:17 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have

[12-Dec-18 11:19 PM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain In Debian package is `libcurl4-gnutls-dev` I wonder

[12-Dec-18 11:19 PM] SHossain#0007
so, `sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev` should fix the issue. right?

[12-Dec-18 11:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes I think so

[12-Dec-18 11:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Is it not Ubuntu debian?

[12-Dec-18 11:21 PM] SHossain#0007
i guess pure debian

[12-Dec-18 11:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, never tried to compile on it but I think shouldn't be difference in libcurl part: https://packages.debian.org/jessie/libcurl-dev

[12-Dec-18 11:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain are you using `zcutil/build.sh`?

[12-Dec-18 11:58 PM] djwillz24#9542

[12-Dec-18 11:59 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, you can

[12-Dec-18 11:59 PM] SHossain#0007
you won't find many blocks mining solo and supernove operator said they are sapling ready

[13-Dec-18 12:47 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I am in need of some troubleshooting help. I am using knomp sapling branch on the RKT chain and i'm regularly getting this output.
```2018-12-12 21:10:18 [Pool]      [rkt] (Thread 1) Submitted Block using submitblock successfully to daemon instance(s)
2018-12-12 21:10:18 [Pool]      [rkt] (Thread 1) We thought a block was found but it was rejected by the daemon, share data: {"job":"ccea","ip":"::ffff:127.0.0.1","port":10000,"worker":"zs1wqnm9d8yvwgn89l2rc5n3xc773x9mtpx6eklg5r6qzsxkwf92vhwzd57kvstnca7hqaqx8sk3yg.ballgag","height":24146,"difficulty":5,"shareDiff":"6.28810795","blockDiff":1.165926502,"blockDiffActual":1.165926502,"blockHash":"000145b1b419f65485f076f3e8cb00fa6f62350d0855a8288123ac64abb80700","error":{"unknown":"check coin daemon logs"}}```

The coin daemon log is always:
```2018-12-12 11:06:46 CheckBlockHeader komodo_check_deposit errorERROR: ProcessNewBlock: CheckBlock FAILED```

I am still finding blocks regularly, and this rejected block occurs when I'd expect to have found one(I am one of two miners on the network). It may happen a handful of times before it actually finds a block. Has anyone seen this daemon output error before?

[13-Dec-18 12:56 AM] Alright#0419
@NutellaLicka edit pool.js in stratum-pool/lib/ to print `blockHex` to console

[13-Dec-18 12:57 AM] Alright#0419
then get the blockhex and use `komodo-cli -ac_name=RKT submitblock <blockhex>` and check debug.log and stdout to see what error the daemon throws

[13-Dec-18 12:57 AM] Alright#0419
Ah I guess that won't quite work unless you're doing it on your own chain that you can stop

[13-Dec-18 12:58 AM] Alright#0419
or you do `invalidateblock` on the public block found at that point

[13-Dec-18 12:58 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I could get the chain stopped, should I try that?

[13-Dec-18 12:59 AM] Alright#0419
you can just force your node to fork with `invalidateblock`

[13-Dec-18 12:59 AM] Alright#0419
first get the stratum to print hex of the block

[13-Dec-18 01:00 AM] Alright#0419
then wait for that error to happen, wait for the next block to come in and do `invalidateblock <blockhash>` on it, your node will now be on it's own fork

[13-Dec-18 01:00 AM] Alright#0419
then take the blockhex outputted from the stratum and do `submitblock <blockhex>`

[13-Dec-18 01:00 AM] Alright#0419
that should give you an error in stdout, debug.log or shell you're doing it in

[13-Dec-18 01:01 AM] Alright#0419
if you get that far, let me know and I'll help you pin down what consensus rule it's violating

[13-Dec-18 01:02 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
