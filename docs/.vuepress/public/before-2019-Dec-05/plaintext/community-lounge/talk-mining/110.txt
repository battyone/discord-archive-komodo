i don't take in account any expenses even....

[20-Mar-19 08:15 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
not even pool's fee...

[20-Mar-19 08:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
been meaning to build it myself but hasn't happened

[20-Mar-19 08:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
ignore that stuff for now. also, those things don't change the order of the best/profitable coins, just modifies the numbers a bit

[20-Mar-19 08:16 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
@dukeleto given that we aim to create bunch of pools, especially equihash, i'll have to figure out those calculations for most of the coins i suppose...

[20-Mar-19 08:16 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
but then again, it's really very very very simple math...

[20-Mar-19 08:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
good luck with the coins that switch between 20 algos

[20-Mar-19 08:16 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
oh yeah, i know 😑

[20-Mar-19 08:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
and have 20 different hashrates/difficulties and several averaged ones, who knows

[20-Mar-19 08:18 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
oh, i am messing around with cryptonote coins for almost 2 years now, ohhhh i cannot describe you what kind of mess is that!

[20-Mar-19 08:18 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
so i think i am prepared to some point for similar craziness =)

[20-Mar-19 08:18 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
i had close to 20 cn coin pools at one point, now i'm left with only 5, trying to move to some other algos a bit...

hi all, anyone having problems with luckpool

[21-Mar-19 12:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My problem is the lucky feks at luckpool get more reward blocks than I do ☹

[21-Mar-19 06:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@polycryptoblog I was told that `RWdQye1bgJiwKcAFKgtX6fGure8JwDmVKN` might be you
if so, please use a miner/proxy that actually uses `mining.suggest_target` instead of just sending it (or take it out entirely)
After an annoying day and a half talking to people I don't like about an undocumented, silly-ass "feature" that no one but Luke actually wants, chickenpool supports it
However, whomever owns `RWdQye1bgJiwKcAFKgtX6fGure8JwDmVKN` uses something that, in fact, doesn't accept the "proper" response and is now getting 0 shares

[21-Mar-19 06:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
to mine from agama

[21-Mar-19 06:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
-setgenerate 1?

[21-Mar-19 06:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
setgenerate true

[21-Mar-19 06:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or is that one for staking?

[21-Mar-19 06:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from the "cli" in settings it would be
`setgenerate true 1` for PoW and the 1 would be a 0 for PoS

[21-Mar-19 06:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and for 50/50 pos/pow?

[21-Mar-19 06:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pick one (either PoS or PoW), you can't set both

[21-Mar-19 06:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the number is the amount of cores?

[21-Mar-19 06:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[21-Mar-19 07:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
lol

[21-Mar-19 07:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
already mined 2 blocks

[21-Mar-19 07:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
hahaha

[21-Mar-19 07:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
of?

[21-Mar-19 07:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I am torn whether or not I should tell you

[21-Mar-19 07:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
because I know you will shit on my parade of free blocks

[21-Mar-19 07:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL

[21-Mar-19 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm done with assetchains for a week or so, back on pirate public solo pool now

I'll tell you tomorrow if you remind me :p

😂 

[21-Mar-19 08:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Every block gets mined to a new address, is there a key to avoid this?

[21-Mar-19 08:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or just pool all funds from all adresses every now and then?

[21-Mar-19 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
-pubkey=

[21-Mar-19 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
a pubkey you control

[21-Mar-19 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆🏽 that or if still an agama question, use `setpubkey` with the pubkey of the addy you want it sent to

[21-Mar-19 08:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Thanks @jl777c  & @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 kind sirs

[21-Mar-19 08:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
pubkey or public addy?

[21-Mar-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the name of the parameter?

[21-Mar-19 08:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
setpubkey

[21-Mar-19 08:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
in agama cli

[21-Mar-19 08:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
CLI response:
error: couldn't connect to server: EOF reached (code 1)
(make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)

[21-Mar-19 08:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
gonna see if restarting agama helps

[21-Mar-19 08:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
did you add an actual pubkey or just type 'setpubkey'?

[21-Mar-19 08:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm a noob, but not that much of a noob 😄

[21-Mar-19 08:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm when restarting it starts resynching chain ugh

[21-Mar-19 08:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
evern veterans do silly things

[21-Mar-19 08:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I do dumb shit on a regular basis and look at it like "dafuq was I thinking?"

[21-Mar-19 08:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm resyncing chain now, have to wait for it to finish before I use the command I assume?

[21-Mar-19 08:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
cli will deny most commands until synced

[21-Mar-19 08:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
maybe before restart chain wasnt 100% sync

[21-Mar-19 09:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ok so i tried setpubkey again

[21-Mar-19 09:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
after chain was 100% again

[21-Mar-19 09:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
same error

[21-Mar-19 09:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and chain goes back to loading best chain

[21-Mar-19 09:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
is there a command to just leave it mining to new addys, but merge all balances to one?

[21-Mar-19 09:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  not me

[21-Mar-19 09:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ok, tnks for the reply

[21-Mar-19 09:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Cryptoon only manually or running a cli script

[21-Mar-19 09:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
hmm and now it's resyncin wallet again from 30%

[21-Mar-19 09:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
3rd time today

[21-Mar-19 09:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
confident I wasnt on a fork though

[21-Mar-19 09:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ProTip: don't use Agama for mining, ever

[21-Mar-19 09:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[21-Mar-19 09:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont want to figure out how to do it from command line atm

[21-Mar-19 09:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
maybe this weekend

[21-Mar-19 10:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm sending manually, does it need to be sent to a different address than in your current wallet.dat?

[21-Mar-19 10:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
because when I send a blockreward to the first addy, it makes 4 tx, 2 out and 2 in...

[21-Mar-19 10:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
too tired, probably overlooking something stupid, going for a fresh look tomorrow 😃

[22-Mar-19 09:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok, so best way to manually merge all the adresses? Have about 100 blocks mined... probably best to merge scripted?

[22-Mar-19 09:37 AM] Alright#0419
@Cryptoon genie has some decent scripts for combining them. I use to just sit there and do `sendtoaddress <address> 0.1` if that didn't work ``sendtoaddress <address> 0.09` and so on

[22-Mar-19 09:37 AM] Alright#0419
100 blocks should only take a tx or two to combine

[22-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm in cli then?

[22-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Guess I'm learning CLI later :p

[22-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Alright#0419
just do the equivalent in UI

[22-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and it aggregates the balances of all those different addresses?

[22-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Alright#0419
what are you mining? RICK and MORTY?

[22-Mar-19 09:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yesterday somewhere

[22-Mar-19 09:41 AM] Alright#0419
Ahh

[22-Mar-19 09:41 AM] Alright#0419
yea man, just keep sending the most you possibly can without it throwing an error back to yourself

[22-Mar-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
that screenshot above is from PTX?

[22-Mar-19 09:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Let's say I have 100 coins over 100 adresses, but when using gui, I must select the wallet needed to send from?

[22-Mar-19 09:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yes

[22-Mar-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't that shield indicate it's notarized?

[22-Mar-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
PTX is not notarized at all

[22-Mar-19 09:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah it's a bug I think

[22-Mar-19 09:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
when hovering the shield it says protected by dpow

[22-Mar-19 09:43 AM] MadMaX#0593
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  https://komodod.com/b/000000012a2bcba8e97356b3fb7447d67510a70120c5203d5d22f57deb2be108

😀 👏🏽 🎊 

[22-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
@pbca26 ^ read the above please

[22-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
Agama is showing "protected by dpow" for, PTX, a chain that doesn't have dpow apparently

[22-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
think I already found it in gui, I just have to select transparant funds and not an address

[22-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
just open up the setting menu and use the cli function from there

[22-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
stupid me

[22-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
or just use CLI

[22-Mar-19 09:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
when it has 2 confirms it gets the shield
