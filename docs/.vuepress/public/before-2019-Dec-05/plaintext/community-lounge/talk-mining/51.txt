so fair compare would be 8 minis

[04-Oct-18 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by the time you heat-spread across 8 boxes (with 8 low speed fans) it's even quieter than 2

[04-Oct-18 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it takes a ton of cfms to compact like that and still cool in the same range

[04-Oct-18 02:54 PM] SHossain#0007
i couldn't stand only 1 mini running in the same room where i work

[04-Oct-18 02:54 PM] SHossain#0007
they are not as loud as S9's. but, still there is a constant noise

`i couldn't stand only 1 mini running in the same room where i work`
Oddly, by comparison, I stood in front of 50 as was like "WOW, these things are feken quiet!" (compared to our S9 room)

have ran a server in my bedroom for like a decade now, I don't even think about the noise anymore

Anyone else having an issue with NH resetting cap on "standard" to 10M no matter what you manually set?

[04-Oct-18 03:26 PM] SHossain#0007
I prefer quiet environment and no disturbance while i'm working :abusedsmily:

[04-Oct-18 03:46 PM] jansako#3330
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  my NH orders look like a f-ing sawtooth... a 0,1 MSol goes from lows of 10-15 k all the way to 1 MSol...

[04-Oct-18 03:47 PM] jansako#3330
The cap is still showing as 0.1 though

[04-Oct-18 03:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jansako the chart is a little wonky to interpret (especially if mining PIRATE) because of the diff and "accepted shares" are partially based on block finds and some other things
It can get complex explaining how retarded their graphs are

[04-Oct-18 03:50 PM] jansako#3330
I have another running on Zergpool (cause their Equihash profitablity is ~20% higher than the cost of the hash on NH), it does the same...

[04-Oct-18 03:50 PM] jansako#3330
I see what you are saying though

[04-Oct-18 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when the diff is high and there's long periods of your rental not finding a block, you'll see a ton of red and if you find multiple blocks in a row, the green will spike like double 😖

NZ apartments are weiredly architect I guess. Kitchen, dining table, my computer, balcony, TV close to each other.
It's kinda mess. Call it a pidgin house than an apartment. 😂

hence, the thought of moving to a better place 😄

[04-Oct-18 03:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and my two miners are sitting next to my computer table.

[04-Oct-18 03:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
My left ear could just give up in a month if I keep it running and me working like 16+ hrs everyday next to it

@jl777c I measured 1 miner yesterday and this was the result:

[04-Oct-18 03:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
measured the second too, and the result was same at start of second miner, then I guess it got loud by time, as more heat, more noisy fans

[04-Oct-18 04:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
could be around 70db-80db

[04-Oct-18 05:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
120m2 isnt that much though @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 :p

I wonder in a lot of appartments you have a seperate storage room for each appartment in the bacement, why not put miners there?

[04-Oct-18 05:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont know how much data a miner consumes and if a mobile router would be an option down there if there is no LAN connection?

[04-Oct-18 05:26 PM] Alright#0419
I run miners over 4g occasionally with no problems at all

[04-Oct-18 06:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Bam, solution for Satinder! Happy wife, happy life 🤓

[04-Oct-18 06:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
would have been great, if I could just put my miners out in balcony. but I rent, and will most probably be thrown out due to noise pollution. 
been living at this place for so long now anyway. Time to get to some new place, soon. It's a small living place for 2 or max 3. little happy living place. not actually made for my noisy computer stuff... 😄

[04-Oct-18 06:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I knew that I won't be able to run miners in my apartment when I ordered. and I also know what I need to do as solution. will do so soon 😉

I have 4 mini's in my spare bedroom and theyre running at 55db. When the fans spool up they are considerably louder.

[05-Oct-18 05:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
i didn't see that the price of the z9m dropped to $745, I wonder if this batch will be even less overclock-able than batch 1 or 2

[05-Oct-18 05:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
can't imagine less OC than batch 2, I've got a couple that will not OC at all (weak chip in each)

[05-Oct-18 05:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
I learned that cleaning the exhaust fan is important, dropped the temp on the hottest chip by 14C

We have "blowout day" every 2 weeks, it sucks, but prolongs everything

[05-Oct-18 05:25 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yea, is the idea they'll last longer running cooler? It's not like they're hashing any faster or anything

[05-Oct-18 05:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at scale, the nominal heat difference is not going to be offset by $1M in extra bs and oil

[05-Oct-18 05:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but ya, just cooling and "being cool hipster"

There comes a tipping point where it's just cheaper to run em till they burn ded, throw them in the dumpster and get a new one vs trying to "save" $100 by spending $1500

I find cooling is pretty useful for quantum computers.

[05-Oct-18 05:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah well, they cost a bit more than an S9 😝

[05-Oct-18 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
not in the future. s9 are precious antiques

is this legit? anybody have a similar experience?

[05-Oct-18 09:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lightning - grounding = 🔥 
Because, physics

[05-Oct-18 09:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
All BM needed to do was look at the aluminum shell to see that didn't just "Burst into Flames", that's a feken power arc.

[05-Oct-18 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
wow, so lightning hit his miners and he is complaining that the warranty doesnt fix it?

[05-Oct-18 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
what happens if you run it over with a steamroller, they dont cover that either?

[05-Oct-18 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe throwing it into the ocean, nope not that either

[05-Oct-18 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yup bitmain is a scam. none of their miners work at all

[05-Oct-18 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL I may be wrong about the lightning, but with an arc like that it's my best guess

[05-Oct-18 09:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
either way, it wasn't "normal" damage for any electronics

[05-Oct-18 09:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And I'd love to know what car he drives that you can blow a rod through the block and they cover it; I'll buy 3 of their cars

[05-Oct-18 09:22 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yea that's an arc. That's why you use surge suppressor and a lightning arrestor in your box

[05-Oct-18 09:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
along with the rod for the power and the in-box serge protectors, we have a 4m rod in the ground just for the racks and every rack is grounded and every miner is grounded to the rack (not just because it sit on the rack, but actually grounded)

[05-Oct-18 09:30 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Didn't think of doing that for the racks .  Are you using the fan screw for the grounding wire?  Or did you put a hole into the casing?

[05-Oct-18 09:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Selftap with ring crimp is what I'm visualizing .  Or did you do another way?

likely overkill, but better safe than 😭ing

With Metal racks maybe a bit overkill but definitely going to do it at my home setup with the plastic rack.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  did you grab any 2080ti  ?

[05-Oct-18 10:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nah, there's nothing I'm currently doing that needs more GPUs than all the 1080 Tis I have

[05-Oct-18 10:29 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ok,   Was just wondering. I need to find someone that has one that can do a benchmark on tensority .  There was rumor that the architecture was better suited not sure if just because both have the word tensor in it or there is legitimacy to the claim.  I'm just curious to see how it stacks against a b3.  Currently a b3 can be found for like 100-200 dollars.  A 1070ti can match it 1080ti beat it by 50%

given that most of the coins you can buy for 1/100th (or less) of the cost of mining them
