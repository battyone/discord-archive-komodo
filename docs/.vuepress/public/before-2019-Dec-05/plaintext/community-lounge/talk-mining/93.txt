more miners needed 😎  https://explorer2.lumberscout.io/

[06-Jan-19 10:13 PM] Alright#0419
@Lumbi what's the current status of your project?

[06-Jan-19 10:13 PM] Alright#0419
wondering why it's minable

[06-Jan-19 10:15 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
The is a block that mined 125k in a single block... The rest are 4.7?

[07-Jan-19 01:01 AM] SHossain#0007
that's not a block. that is a tx.

[07-Jan-19 01:01 AM] SHossain#0007
Iquidus Explorer works different way

[07-Jan-19 01:51 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ahh okay, fair enough

Congratulations to all the winners on the https://minethechains.com/#CompetitionResults Christmas Mining Competition. 
Winners have now all been paid via !arrrtip bot withdrawals and tips. We appreciate your use of the pool and would love to hear your thoughts on pool improvements for the future. Please consider us for all your Pirate & Komodo mining. Check out the Pirate Discord #mining channel for verification of payments.

[07-Jan-19 03:45 PM] Lumbi#8378
@Alright mainchain is active. Lumber is on the v1 Verus Algo 50 PoW / 50 PoS. The idea is to up the staking to 80 PoS / 20 PoW at a later date (when komodod is updated).

[07-Jan-19 03:45 PM] Lumbi#8378
All pull requests have merged

[07-Jan-19 03:47 PM] Lumbi#8378
Hashrate is holding around 600MH/s but we almost broke 1 GH/s last night

[07-Jan-19 03:49 PM] Lumbi#8378
I myself am sort of a PoS purist, but I recognize the utility of decentralization and verushash is ASIC resistant -- at least for now.

[07-Jan-19 07:30 PM] SHossain#0007
@Pool-Operator Please update your komodo daemon in your pool and post after updating is done. jl777 pushed an important bugfix update for komodod.
```
cd ~/komodo
git pull
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
# you may have to run this ^^ command few times until you have it compiles
cd src
./komodod stop
# wait some time for the daemon to stop properly
./komodod &
```
New version would be `0.3.3`. Thank you in advance.

[07-Jan-19 07:42 PM] hellcatz#5825
@SHossain I'll get Luckpool updated today.

[07-Jan-19 07:42 PM] SHossain#0007
with version 0.3.3?

[07-Jan-19 07:42 PM] hellcatz#5825
Yes, running 0.3.0 right now.

[07-Jan-19 07:42 PM] SHossain#0007
not 0.3.0

[07-Jan-19 07:42 PM] SHossain#0007
0.3.3

[07-Jan-19 07:43 PM] hellcatz#5825
Yes, it'll be a few hours before I get a chance.  hence, update today 😄

how do you see subversion @Jules - coinblockers.com

[08-Jan-19 12:18 AM] hellcatz#5825
i think it is in `getnetworkinfo`  rpc response @SHossain

[08-Jan-19 12:21 AM] SHossain#0007
aha...the magicbean

[08-Jan-19 12:21 AM] SHossain#0007
ok

[08-Jan-19 12:24 AM] hellcatz#5825
LuckPool daemons are now running KMD v0.3.3; the website will update shortly when it gets a chance to poll the daemon.

Sure thing  👍

[08-Jan-19 06:02 PM] Mink#9547
Anyone in here have a moment to help with mining questions? Curious about ASIC and people's experinece.

[08-Jan-19 07:55 PM] Hermes#6934
got a new ASIC?

{Reactions}
👍🏻 

[08-Jan-19 08:32 PM] Mink#9547
Wanted to know how other miners are holding up with their ASICs or if there was discussions going on about it @Hermes

[08-Jan-19 08:33 PM] Mink#9547
I'm totally new to Komodo hence wanted to learn more

[08-Jan-19 08:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_held up good enough that he could afford to shut down for 2 months to work on his software and network 😎_

[08-Jan-19 08:33 PM] Mink#9547
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 hahaha amazing

[08-Jan-19 08:34 PM] Mink#9547
don't get a girl stoked like that

[08-Jan-19 08:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in the interest of full disclosure, I'm a Komodo fanboy

[08-Jan-19 08:35 PM] Mink#9547
Ah that's cool 😎 wouldn't expect to walk into a Komodo discord and find members who feel indifferently

[08-Jan-19 08:36 PM] Mink#9547
What's your setup for Komodo if you don't mind me asking? I come from a more CPU / (slight GPU) background so ASICs are a bit new to me

[08-Jan-19 08:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I run an asston of GPUs and a bunch of ASICs on a local solo-pool

[08-Jan-19 08:37 PM] Mink#9547
damn that's impressive, full solo 👀

[08-Jan-19 08:38 PM] Mink#9547
Wish I got into mining earlier in my life but oh well. Really a fan of privacy projects and Komodo felt right up my alley. I"m hopping around a few atm but several stand out for obvious reasons.

[08-Jan-19 08:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Then you might be interested to also look into PIRATE, it's a komodo assetchain that has full forced z transactions

[08-Jan-19 08:41 PM] Mink#9547
oh very interesting!

[08-Jan-19 08:41 PM] Mink#9547
any link?

- Pirate Chain (ARRR)
Pirate (ARRR) is a real privacy coin that takes financial privacy very serious Pirate (ARRR) is a 100% private send cryptocurrency. Pirate uses a privacy protocol that cannot be compromised by other users activity on the network. Most privacy coins are riddled with holes crea...

[08-Jan-19 08:47 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
The Pirate website isn't pretty looking. It's in the process of being upgraded, which is much needed

[08-Jan-19 08:48 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Asic mining isn't too different from gpu. A bit easier tbh, less electricity, less options aha

[08-Jan-19 08:48 PM] Mink#9547
Oh very cool thank you for the link - so what's its primary purpose? re: pirate

[08-Jan-19 08:49 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It's primary purpose is 100% ztransactions. Meaning there is no data in the block Explorer. Nobody can see how many coins your have in total, or what transactions to whom that you have conducted

[08-Jan-19 08:49 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Zcash, Komodo and other coins have opt in privacy, and only a minimal amount of users actually use the features.

[08-Jan-19 08:50 PM] Mink#9547
Interesting, so from the ground floor it is basically untraceable

[08-Jan-19 08:50 PM] Mink#9547
both in and out

[08-Jan-19 08:50 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yep, exactly.

[08-Jan-19 08:50 PM] Mink#9547
any movement in terms of adoption for it? or is it still very early?

[08-Jan-19 08:50 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
The only transparent addresses are for Notary Nodes (it is also secured by dPoW) and for coinbase transactions(mining rewards) which can only go to Z addresses

[08-Jan-19 08:52 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It's only about 4 months old, and has a fairly big following at the moment. There is a lot in the works too. It's currently only on 1 exchange, but they have a couple others in the works, and they're looking into zSPV and Web shop plug-ins for commercial use

[08-Jan-19 08:53 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It is a pretty unique currency. It is completely decentralised as well. No premine, no founders rewards, nothing. There is a marketing donation address, and currently they are asking for donations which will be used for exchange listing fees

[08-Jan-19 08:53 PM] Mink#9547
yea that's cool! incredibly grass roots

[08-Jan-19 08:54 PM] Mink#9547
I'd be curious to try my new ASIC with it

[08-Jan-19 08:54 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
If you'd like to check out Komodo or Pirate mining, I host a pool for both, on the same site. Https://minethechains.com

[08-Jan-19 08:54 PM] Mink#9547
I'm way more from a CPU mining side (and some GPU) as mentioned above.

[08-Jan-19 08:54 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
You use the same config, just change the port accordingly

[08-Jan-19 08:54 PM] Mink#9547
So projects i've looked at tend to lean more twards cpou algos but this is cool

[08-Jan-19 08:54 PM] Mink#9547
yea correct

[08-Jan-19 08:54 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
If you like cpu mining, you'd like the VerusHash project as well, if you haven't heard of it.

[08-Jan-19 08:55 PM] Mink#9547
I have not!

someone mentioned earlier here hilariously but I've been checking out Resistance a lot recently

[08-Jan-19 08:55 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I don't know enough about it to explain it, so maybe check out their discord too

[08-Jan-19 08:56 PM] Mink#9547
CPU mining utilizing zksnarks / atomic swaps - hasn't released yet though

[08-Jan-19 08:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
A wise man I once knew used his CPUs to mine a bunch of the lower diff assetchains and use it to fund buying his wife a new car ....

[08-Jan-19 08:56 PM] Mink#9547
A wise man, or a genie? 😄

[08-Jan-19 08:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
both :trollface:

[08-Jan-19 08:57 PM] Mink#9547
maybe i'll buy my hubby a car, but he's gotta get me a better ASIC first :2561_feelsevilman:

[08-Jan-19 08:58 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Which do you have

[08-Jan-19 08:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I want better ones too; I kept wanting to buy A9s, but kept spending earnings on everything else LOL

[08-Jan-19 09:01 PM] Mink#9547
yea it's not easy they cost so goddamn much

[08-Jan-19 09:01 PM] Mink#9547
s7 for a while

[08-Jan-19 09:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
s7 = wrong kind of ASIC for here

[08-Jan-19 09:03 PM] Mink#9547
yep hence need new one

[08-Jan-19 09:03 PM] Mink#9547
recommendations?

[08-Jan-19 09:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
A9 is pretty much the only thing left

[08-Jan-19 09:05 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yep, it's the top dog at the moment. Best value for hash

[08-Jan-19 09:06 PM] Mink#9547
looking at prices for used

[08-Jan-19 09:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that and bm isn't selling/making any more z9s (no clue if that's forever or just for now)

[08-Jan-19 09:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just say no to used

[08-Jan-19 09:06 PM] Mink#9547
too abused i suppose and untrustworthy

[08-Jan-19 09:07 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Bm is having a bunch of random things going on in house. I'd be surprised if they even had a new equihash miner in development

[08-Jan-19 09:07 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Anyways I'm off for a bit. Peace out ✌
