who got lucky?

[17-Oct-18 11:29 AM] jorian#4555
btw, it seems our dear notaries will never get those beefy rewards again, since i guess miners here can detect when such a transaction hits the mempool and increase their hashing power

[17-Oct-18 11:30 AM] jorian#4555
6 blocks in 1 minute too

[17-Oct-18 11:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It wasn't me 😭

[17-Oct-18 11:54 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
How exactly would you know that a big block is coming?

[17-Oct-18 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you monitor the mempool

[17-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
damn juicy block 😮

[17-Oct-18 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
holy shit

[17-Oct-18 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
largest ever maybe?

[17-Oct-18 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
I have a feeling all these blocks lately are binance mining them themselves somehow

[17-Oct-18 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
or someone at binance knowing when they're going to happen and mining them

[17-Oct-18 12:54 PM] Alright#0419
yea that address has *a lot* of large blocks

[17-Oct-18 12:55 PM] Alright#0419
couple >100 KMD blocks

[17-Oct-18 12:55 PM] Alright#0419
couple >1000 KMD blocks

[17-Oct-18 12:55 PM] Alright#0419
;_;

[17-Oct-18 12:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or someone bothered to make the script to monitor mempool?

[17-Oct-18 12:55 PM] Alright#0419
yea, but you'd need a farm pretty much

[17-Oct-18 12:55 PM] Alright#0419
NH wouldn't be able to spin up quickly enough

[17-Oct-18 12:56 PM] Alright#0419
you only have *seconds* to start hashing it after you detect it

[17-Oct-18 12:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Is it possible to find out how much the hashrate jumped during the time around that block?

[17-Oct-18 12:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
On average you should have 30 second I guess?

[17-Oct-18 12:57 PM] Alright#0419
seems they start hashing a couple blocks before it happens

[17-Oct-18 12:57 PM] Alright#0419
so they know it's about to happen before the tx is even broadcast?

[17-Oct-18 12:58 PM] Alright#0419
If I had to guess, an exchange isn't claiming rewards for tax reasons

[17-Oct-18 12:58 PM] Alright#0419
and an employee of that exchange is taking advantage of that

[17-Oct-18 01:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I thought exchanges simply werent able to claim because they had special wallets or whatever

[17-Oct-18 01:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Guess I thought wrong :p

[17-Oct-18 01:04 PM] Alright#0419
no, they choose not to

[17-Oct-18 01:04 PM] Alright#0419
they could use `-donation=<pubkey>` to donate it to somewhere

[17-Oct-18 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Would someone know if they were donating?

[17-Oct-18 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If hash jumps a few blocks before then it would even be easier than just monitoring mempool?

[17-Oct-18 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
One could just monitor increases in hashrate by over 100% lets say

[17-Oct-18 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Which would mean someone is making a move?

[17-Oct-18 01:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I assume hashrate/difficulty is easier to monitor then mempool?

[17-Oct-18 01:07 PM] Alright#0419
🤷 if someone put the time in and it works, good for them

[17-Oct-18 01:07 PM] Alright#0419
am happy when I get a 10 KMD block

[17-Oct-18 01:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sounds like a job for the genie :p

[17-Oct-18 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
Ah, I was wrong about it already mining before it happens

[17-Oct-18 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
looks like someone scripted it to just watch mempool and dump *tons* of hash on it when it detects one

[17-Oct-18 01:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Smart

[17-Oct-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
been sayig this for a long time now, someone was doing that ...

[17-Oct-18 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dwy theorised it maybe 6 months ago.

[17-Oct-18 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
a ledger user could ramp up nicehash before he does the tx, to at least have a good chance to collect on their own. sort of a probabilistic way to claim your ledger reward

[17-Oct-18 04:17 PM] jansako#3330
'fairly cheap' to do it as well, with 'only' 20 MSols or so of nethash

[17-Oct-18 04:39 PM] $tefano.#3560
@blackjok3r there is a mempool graph? i don't remember link

[17-Oct-18 04:40 PM] $tefano.#3560
this morning a block with 46 KMD paid, big block is coming,  this type of blocks anticipate it. i see it in my pool history

[17-Oct-18 04:41 PM] $tefano.#3560
ok it comes http://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/block/000000039bac9b028286be127776edb0fdc7377b7193c90950de9eb16e9c575c 😄

[17-Oct-18 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
havent really looked into it I just know you can do it, if I had a farm on hash I could switch, i'd be doing it.

[17-Oct-18 04:49 PM] $tefano.#3560
maybe i found a solution . i will test it

[17-Oct-18 09:38 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Im going back into the mining business soon - where do I get the best deals and packages? - I have a nice sized warehouse to set up in.  - thank you in advance

most days, anything under $750k you get the same "deals" as anyone buying 1 unit 😦

[17-Oct-18 09:45 PM] Hermes#6934

anyone know how to get nvm installed so i can proceed>?

[18-Oct-18 01:04 AM] gt#2812
i’ve tried a few times and never got it running

[18-Oct-18 01:14 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ok will give it a shot

[18-Oct-18 01:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
To install nvm, just use the actual nvm install script (it always works)
`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash`

[18-Oct-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just use node10 and hte right pool software :trollface:

[18-Oct-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
noo ned for nvm

[18-Oct-18 05:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What I think is that the only reason the lemming coins are "safe" from ASICs is that BM makes all of their products to serve both comercial and hobby markets at the same time and others have followed their lead. All it will take is 1 $12k unit that uses variables and the fallacy that the "anti-ASIC" movement was founded on will crumble. The only "resistance" in equihash is the concept that RAM is expensive.

[18-Oct-18 05:05 AM] jl777c#5810
EOS proves RAM is very expensive!

[18-Oct-18 05:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LMFAO

[18-Oct-18 09:07 AM] Alright#0419
if someone had a farm(or consistent large NH orders), they could use a stratum proxy to switch their hash rate when they detect a tx that isn't claiming rewards

Hi, I am trying to mine ARRR, but the GPU nVidia miner says: "authorization failed" What to I do???

[18-Oct-18 11:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Are you using a zaddr as the payout address?

[18-Oct-18 12:19 PM] ɃrockKoli#6597
I use Agama wallett.

[18-Oct-18 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ɃrockKoli in your workername, you need to use a z address (really long and starts with `z`, as opposed to the "normal" `R`)

[18-Oct-18 12:34 PM] ɃrockKoli#6597
My start.bat looks like >>> zm --server stratum.piratepool.io --port 2095 --user REEKmnNQsAx1Grx1JSdb838Ry8DioukQ5n.rig1 --dev 0123

[18-Oct-18 12:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that's why it doesn't work; reread my last comment

[18-Oct-18 01:38 PM] ɃrockKoli#6597
So, the Agama wallett address is not good...?

[18-Oct-18 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ɃrockKoli
The Agama address that starts with `R` (called a 'transparent' or 't') cannot be used for transferring funds (and as such, cannot be used for public pool mining).
The Agama address that starts with `z` (called a 'private' or 'z') **must** be used for transferring funds (and as such, **must** be used for public pool mining).

[18-Oct-18 01:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
For PIRATE, anyway

[18-Oct-18 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
