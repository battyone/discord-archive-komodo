I do not know what your difficulty values mean.  Are they 2x what the miner has solved or 1x or something else?

[06-Aug-19 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the first diff is what the miner actually solved

[06-Aug-19 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
last value is solvetime

[06-Aug-19 11:40 AM] zawy#5864
avg diff for 9 blocks after 64 was 20.  wow that was close.....and better than close, that means avg actual difficulty was 40 because it's trying to slow them up.  Net solvetime time was 70

[06-Aug-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
somehow it got diff to 20+, while slowing down 11 minutes, in 26 blocks

[06-Aug-19 11:41 AM] zawy#5864
maybe it's perfect

[06-Aug-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
even at current pace it wont recoup all the genesis surplus, but that is a very special case

[06-Aug-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
it sure seems like magic

[06-Aug-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
once the genesis 64 blocks gets out of the past window, i expect to see it go quite and just make blocks normally. then i will do a 2x test

[06-Aug-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
what do you expect will happen when the W6 and W12 are activated?

[06-Aug-19 11:46 AM] zawy#5864
I only see it caught up 2 blocks

[06-Aug-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
its been 43 minutes since the chain started, at height 96

[06-Aug-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
at 4 minutes it was 64

[06-Aug-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
in 39 minutes it did 32 blocks

[06-Aug-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
seems caught up 7, now it gets some faster blocks

[06-Aug-19 11:48 AM] zawy#5864
W=6 and 12 will only activate if the attacks are less that about 3x or 6x.   They are for the smaller increases in hashrate.  But  W=3 may make them pointless.

[06-Aug-19 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
oh. yes, it is catching my 6x "attack", well i guess from genesis it might be a 10x

[06-Aug-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
having the digishield and loop using the modified ct[] targets solved the problem of not being able to increase diff while slowing down for past blocks

[06-Aug-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
and it hasnt activated for the last 6 blocks

[06-Aug-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
diff is at 33

[06-Aug-19 11:52 AM] zawy#5864
5 of those 7 was just the last of the 64 coming in slower.  RST only slowed up 2 blocks.....hmmm, oh yeah.... that's the intention in normal conditions...see, it only activates when 3 blocks are suddenly  2.5 to 3 blocks behind.

[06-Aug-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
activated at ht 98

[06-Aug-19 11:53 AM] zawy#5864
what are the heights where it turned on and off?

[06-Aug-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
in the third column, if the lowest 2 bits are 0, it is off

[06-Aug-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
90 was the only one RST triggered and it solved it when the diff was adjusted, from the pre-adjusted ct[]

[06-Aug-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
adjustments on adjustments

[06-Aug-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i think the only problem spot would be that it will take a long time to adjust after being diffstranded 5x

[06-Aug-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
though, maybe random variations will go past 7 minutes and trigger an exp()...

[06-Aug-19 11:57 AM] zawy#5864
not following

[06-Aug-19 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but the recovery time from diff stranding will be slower now, so we also make up excess blocks during the recovery

[06-Aug-19 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
and since much less hashrate is getting the blocks, it seems ok that it is slower

[06-Aug-19 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but a 3x attack, wouldnt trigger exp(), so it would need to rely on digishield to adjust... the SMA was so much faster than digishield

[06-Aug-19 11:59 AM] zawy#5864
i see no 00, so it never turned off?

[06-Aug-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it is decimal,maybe i should display it in binary, but two lowest bits, so a multiple of 4 is disabled

[06-Aug-19 12:00 PM] zawy#5864
My SMAs were causing D to lower faster?  I only inteded for them to make it rise

[06-Aug-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
we had a symmetrical max() side after the initial min() only

[06-Aug-19 12:01 PM] zawy#5864
oh, so 2, 4, 8, 16?

[06-Aug-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i propose to add back the SMA max() side in case RST and exp() dont trigger

[06-Aug-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the nbits % 4 == 0

[06-Aug-19 12:01 PM] zawy#5864
I don't remember suggestnig that

[06-Aug-19 12:01 PM] zawy#5864
SMA

[06-Aug-19 12:02 PM] zawy#5864
mine were only for increasing diff

[06-Aug-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
you gave me the magic constants to allow it to be symmetrical

3/10, 5/10, 6/10 for 4, 7, 12 SMA

[06-Aug-19 12:05 PM] zawy#5864
It might be better to replace  digi and these SMAs with LWMA

[06-Aug-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it will adjust faster than 15 blocks?

[06-Aug-19 12:09 PM] zawy#5864
To drop?  Under what conditions?  Post 3x attack or 10x?

[06-Aug-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
post 3x to 5x

[06-Aug-19 12:11 PM] zawy#5864
No, it drops slowly.  But that's because it needs to stay on track and does not have RST.

[06-Aug-19 12:11 PM] zawy#5864
RST is damn confusing and damn good.

[06-Aug-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yes!

[06-Aug-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if it isnt active and the SMA kicks in, i would think it would work as well as when we testing it (before RST)

[06-Aug-19 12:12 PM] zawy#5864
3 days now, and I can't wrap my head around the consequences

[06-Aug-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
SMA only problem (allows on/off generating extra blocks) is solved by RST, at least it is looking like that will be the case, we do need to verify this

[06-Aug-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
RST quiet for 8 blocks now

[06-Aug-19 12:14 PM] zawy#5864
let hashrate be  stable for 100 blocks....there should be only 25% change RST is activated

[06-Aug-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
it made up about 25 blocks, during the 50 block window. so under normal circumstances it wont be able to get anywhere close to 25 blocks ahead.

[06-Aug-19 12:15 PM] zawy#5864
the way W=3 works, there may be no need for W=6 or 12.....

[06-Aug-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
assuming it can stop a 1000x attack as well as it does for a 10x

[06-Aug-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
and you said you were most worried about these low range attacks

[06-Aug-19 12:17 PM] zawy#5864
See, it only has 50% chance of detecting 6x in 3 blocks.    But it has something like a 50% chance of detecting a 3x attack in 6 blocks.....  which is exactly the chance W=6 has

[06-Aug-19 12:17 PM] zawy#5864
and it will be more aggressive than W=6

[06-Aug-19 12:18 PM] zawy#5864
The reason for W=6 is if the results from W=3 are too unstable

[06-Aug-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
do you see anything wrong with using the solved blockhashes into the ct[] array instead of the nBits based bnTarget?

[06-Aug-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
what that would do is if some ASIC is blasting away and solving much harder than the current diff blocks, it will go into the digishield and it will target the actually solved targets. basically the implied hashrate

[06-Aug-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
many tweaks i put in to get it to work more consistetly, but the data problem was the biggest destabilizer

[06-Aug-19 12:22 PM] zawy#5864
Solving blocks faster does not result  in lower hash values.  You can't detect hashrate fom the hash values unless the target is actually harder

[06-Aug-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean if a miner can find a block starting with 00000... instead of just 000...

[06-Aug-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
dont we know he has approx 256x more hashrate?

[06-Aug-19 12:23 PM] zawy#5864
yes, but he's not going to hash for the normal time to solve the target.....he's going to give you the first he finds which is a rand() value below the target

[06-Aug-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but whatever he posts, we can see it is a good statistical change he has a lot more hashrate

[06-Aug-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
at least that was my logic

[06-Aug-19 12:24 PM] zawy#5864
to do what you have in mind, he would have to hash the full T to find that 256x lower target if he is 256x the current difficulty

[06-Aug-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
ASIC have a mindiff setting

[06-Aug-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
they cant solve the lowest diffs that well

[06-Aug-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
so usually even if the diff is much lower, they set it at a much harder level as that is what the ASIC starts at

[06-Aug-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so this is more a practical point than a theoretical one where miners have the perfect mining machine without any pesky mindiff/maxdiff settings

[06-Aug-19 12:26 PM] zawy#5864
WHy in the world would they need to start with a harder difficulty?

for one, nicehash wont let you mine at anything other than very high diff

[06-Aug-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
a lot of ASIC just dont work very well at very easy diffs

[06-Aug-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
just some real world constraints

nBits % 4?   tell me how to see in 3rd column if RST is active

[06-Aug-19 12:30 PM] zawy#5864
So I need to make RST symmetrical for the drops?    That would replace exp()

[06-Aug-19 12:30 PM] zawy#5864
and SMA

[06-Aug-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
in hex now, much easier, 0, 4, 6, 8, a, c are off

[06-Aug-19 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
if RST was symmetrical, indeed it could be the only thing that is needed

[06-Aug-19 12:31 PM] zawy#5864
will it randomly misunderstand, or do you actively force digi and RST to not collide?

[06-Aug-19 12:32 PM] zawy#5864
on that 0, 4, 6, 8, a, c.  why not 2 and e?

[06-Aug-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
i store 1, 2, or 3, depending on if <1 T, <2T or 3T+ for the solvetime

[06-Aug-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
a nonzero -> (val +1) divisor
