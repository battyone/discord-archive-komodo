need KMD version of that

Or a pirate version

here - i am not sure if you miners do taxes, but i do .. and tax season is a bitch...

I have a solution, YOU HEARD  THIS IDEA HERE FIRST FROM ME

`miningfool.com`

 i am working on a great new feature.

soon you will be able to download an excel or spreadsheet file that has a history of all your payouts ... (PURPOSELY BUILT TO MAKE TAXES EASY)

For a year you choose..... i support 7 years of data in the past...

you will be able to download a spreadsheet with your payout history for that entire year by month by day.. payouts will be rolled up for each day.. just the way the tax man likes them...

for each day of there year where you had atleast one payout,  you will have the Coin Name, Coin Amount, US Dollar Amount, DATE
in a nice PERFECT spreadsheet FOR TAX PURPOSES

obviously the link to download will be on your miner page... so its a a spreadsheet report PER address..

but this will make doing taxes SUPER EASY

soon this feature will be available...

YOU HEARD THIS IDEA HERE FIRST

[13-Jun-19 12:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
here seems like the right spot for that to me, we've all gotta have some sort of advertising hook 🤷🏽

[13-Jun-19 12:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🐔pool's hook is that it's the anti that (aka: I don't store your data any more than nessesary for pool function, because `fek the tax man`)

[13-Jun-19 12:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@g00dnatur3 if you add HUSH to your pool with sapling zaddr payouts, there is a 250 HUSH bounty for that, fyi

If any pools/miners are having issues with daemon locking up please test this fix.

[14-Jun-19 09:26 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
what would a "locking up" daemon look like?

[14-Jun-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will just stop working. RPC wont respond.

$HUSH is enabled again on the awesome @WhatToMine mining calculator!
Make sure to enable the @graviex_net exchange from the dropdown list too see Hush statistics.
The nethash must flow.

Does anyone have a public API that tracks blocks that contain unclaimed rewards? I've got personal tools that I use, but I was wondering if there was anything for the general public to see...

[16-Jun-19 10:49 AM] CHMEX#0686
I store each block and it's reward what are you exactly after I'm sure if I have the data I can publish it

[16-Jun-19 10:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
was just curious if there was a way for "Joe Average" to see how many bonus blocks there were, when they were, and what the amounts were

[16-Jun-19 10:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sort of a double measure to see if their pool hit a big block and they did/didn't get paid for it (since most pools don't publish more than 100 back)

[16-Jun-19 10:54 AM] CHMEX#0686
I have something here starting > 100 KMD

@Pool-Operator Please update your pool daemon with latest Komodo source ASAP. You can use https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo or https://github.com/jl777/komodo . For branch, we suggest to use `master` branch for pools. However, if you know what you are doing, you can also use `beta` branch. As soon as you finish updating, please ping us here with your pool name. If you need help please ask here. @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 @webworker01 @NutellaLicka @mrlynch are experienced pool operator and are ready to help you.

Update process is simple. You can issue the following commands to compile updated `komodod` (change branch name if needed). These commands to be used as general guidance and to keep compile issues at minimum level. If you want to update using your own method, please go ahead.
```
cd ~/komodo
git reset --hard
make clean
git checkout master
git pull
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```
Once you finish updating, `getinfo` call should display `"KMDversion: 0.4.0a",`

Note: This is a hardforking update to include next Season 3 Notary Node keys and must be carried out before 15th July. Thank you very much for your co-operation.

Komodo (3) 💯

@SHossain Two different hardware builds (Ryzen and Xeon), trying both branches, master and beta, I'm getting build failed errors: `Makefile:659: recipe for target 'all-recursive' failed' and 'Makefile:5115: recipe for target 'all-recursive' failed' This is making clean too

[16-Jun-19 01:23 PM] SHossain#0007
try 3 times `./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)` or use fresh clone

[16-Jun-19 01:24 PM] bishop#9773

@SHossain LuckPool updated KMD 0.4.0a, as can bee seen on network stats 👍 

Yes, on one of my personal nodes, I had to actually `rm -rf komodo/`  to get it to compile from source. For whatever reason, `git reset` didn't save me. When all else fails, start fresh 😄

guys do you have instrucion how to add zaddex coin on yiimp base pool

@! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers and @phm87 are the only ones that I know of that have such code and they care more about keeping the code secret than growing the community 🤷🏽

[16-Jun-19 07:50 PM] zaza68#4573
yeah i know

[16-Jun-19 07:52 PM] zaza68#4573
if zaddex had a qt wallet this was not a problem

[16-Jun-19 07:52 PM] zaza68#4573
but we ar stuck on a agama wallet i hope shombuddy have a tip on how to add zaddex on a pool

[16-Jun-19 07:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what does a qt wallet have to do with 'yiimp base pool'?

[16-Jun-19 07:53 PM] zaza68#4573
the proces is the same on a qt wallet

[16-Jun-19 07:53 PM] zaza68#4573
but on the agama wallet the erros how to fix or how it works is difrent

[16-Jun-19 07:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a qt wallet is just a daemon and a gui combined, if you can convert that then you can just convert the daemon

[16-Jun-19 07:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
chain-wise, there's nothing "special" that's in a qt wallet

[16-Jun-19 07:56 PM] zaza68#4573
othing special on a qt wallet

[16-Jun-19 07:56 PM] zaza68#4573
bro what ar u saying

[16-Jun-19 07:57 PM] zaza68#4573
qt wallet you have guid how to fix promblems a lot of info on the web every think you can fix it

[16-Jun-19 07:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm saying that there's nothing in a qt wallet that would convert to a pool that isn't in the non-gui daemon

[16-Jun-19 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you asking about pool code and then saying you'd need a gui to do it doesn't make sense

[16-Jun-19 07:58 PM] zaza68#4573
no i did not say i want a qt wallet

[16-Jun-19 07:59 PM] zaza68#4573
i say i would be easy if zaddex had a qt wallet

[16-Jun-19 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if zaddex had a qt wallet this was not a problem`
what does that have to do with pool code?

[16-Jun-19 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i say i would be easy if zaddex had a qt wallet`
no easier than a non-gui daemon

[16-Jun-19 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's the same code

[16-Jun-19 08:00 PM] zaza68#4573
its not about the code its about the wallet setting up

[16-Jun-19 08:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you set up the wallet the same as komodo or any other equihash coin

[16-Jun-19 08:00 PM] phm87#7395
Ondalf shared this link https://github.com/gpuminingir/yiimp if you want to add coins that run on nomp/snomp into yiimp. It is integration of nomp into yiimp

Hello, has anyone tried mining KMD token on a raspberry pi?

[17-Jun-19 03:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd is ASIC minable, so doubt you will get many blocks on a raspberry pi?

[17-Jun-19 03:57 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
Yes

[17-Jun-19 03:58 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
But it is just for self-education that I'm interested to try

[17-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha, not sure komodod is runable on a raspberry, I think @radix42 made some ports, but not sure if it applies to mining as well

[17-Jun-19 04:00 PM] radix42#3743
you can only theoretically run it on a rasp pi 3B+ if you load a 64bit OS and add a lot of swap

[17-Jun-19 04:00 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116

a nanopi m4 also works well

both are similar form factor just different ports
