I think an F1+ is up to 100GH on the original VRSC algo

[13-Aug-19 05:44 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
F1mini does 5-7 GHs on V1. F1+ would make 40-50 GHs

@jl777c Does digishield use only targetA, or do they all use the rule if targetB not 0, then use targetB?

[13-Aug-19 10:10 AM] zawy#5864
All meaning digi, rst, and exp()

[13-Aug-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
digishield is back to using only targetA, unless RST is over. in that case it uses 7/8 of the targetA for the blocks that had RST active

[21-Aug-19 07:38 PM] miraculu#8334
Please what version of verushash does smart chains use.  I really need to know if it's asic resistant.

[21-Aug-19 07:44 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
1.0 ,  no known asic but it is FPGA dominated

[21-Aug-19 09:04 PM] miraculu#8334
Please is there a way to make a smart chain asic/FPGA resistant?

[21-Aug-19 09:17 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Kind of impossible ,  any chain that is profitable enough eventually will have a bitstream made for it .

[21-Aug-19 09:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
chains with good utility don't need "asic/FPGA resistance"

[21-Aug-19 09:35 PM] miraculu#8334
I have a targeted audience that don't have access to asic/FGPA and I'll like the community to be part of the block producers.

[21-Aug-19 09:37 PM] miraculu#8334
Staking would have been the solution, but the docs says it's shouldn't be used in production.

[21-Aug-19 10:17 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@miraculu  cost of low end FPGA is cheaper than low end  current generation GPU and  medium end CPU

https://www.hashaltcoin.com/en/batches/14

[21-Aug-19 10:35 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
you can also do 10%pow and 90% staking or other ratio variation

[21-Aug-19 10:58 PM] miraculu#8334
@polycryptoblog  Thanks , never knew they were that cheap.

[21-Aug-19 10:58 PM] miraculu#8334
@Gordon Komodo  is staking production ready?

[21-Aug-19 11:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
VerusPoS you could say is,  even pos64 is being used on live chains

[21-Aug-19 11:07 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
But still new technology so just proceed with caution

[21-Aug-19 11:15 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
zexo and ourc are both ecosystem projects that enabled staking as well as veruscoin of course

[22-Aug-19 03:18 AM] Alright#0419
@miraculu @polycryptoblog there is a version dubbed "verushash1.1" that smart chains can use right now

[22-Aug-19 03:19 AM] Alright#0419
it's basically verushash1.0 but with a few tricks to slow down FPGA development for it

[22-Aug-19 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
Joker made it, he'd be able to explain. It's not a good long term solution for a chain though. Is basically security through obscurity

[22-Aug-19 04:20 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Did not know that ,  will have to ask him about it

[22-Aug-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, the verushash1.1 is verushash 1 with a random seed, so there are no FPGA or even GPU miners for it, as it never got used on any real chain. The code was all there in the Verus merge for sapling, but the algo was not activated so I added the code nneded to use it as a3rd algo option.

[22-Aug-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
-ac_algo=verushash11

[22-Aug-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It also works with verusPoS and PoS64, but PoS64 is a little weird on verushash, it works, but blocktimes can be a bit crazy

[22-Aug-19 12:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
Might be something to study but I would not recommend using that on a new production mainnet of any coin

[22-Aug-19 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its been tested plenty of times.. I starrted at least 100 chains using that algo while trying toi get pos64 working on it

[22-Aug-19 01:24 PM] Alright#0419
we've used it on many CFEK chains. Works as intended

[23-Aug-19 11:00 PM] miraculu#8334
@Alright  and @blackjok3r  thank you very much. I'll check it out.

[23-Aug-19 11:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am sure blackjoker+Alright have done good work on that hash variant. It's just that most people using it aren't going to realize that if it were profitable, an FPGA could mine it very effectively, it's just that no financial target has ever appeared to bitstream devs. Why is somebody using the function, and do they realize they may be that first target of this new variant? People just need to understand what it's limitations are

[23-Aug-19 11:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
most people making new smart chains don't know enough to decide between Equihash (N,K) variants and this, so we guide them to what we think is best for most situations. I am trying to think of a situation where I would recommend verushash1.1 to a consulting client, and I can't think of one

@Laviathon -bcmonster.com how large is your KMD wallet.dat?

[24-Aug-19 09:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, that is usually a race condition that happens very rarely, if you try again, does it happen consistently?

[24-Aug-19 09:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
if your system is heavily loaded, it's more likely as well

[24-Aug-19 09:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
if the problem is persistent, starting a new wallet.dat and importing any necessary keys might make it less likely. It's a real bug, but nobody has been able to fix it. Also happens in Zcash and all Zcash coins, but is only triggered very rarely. Usually I see it on an overloaded system, and trying again works

If you have a problem, just sprinkle a little Verifiable Delay Function on it. Now you have a problem that nobody understands.

@dukeleto it only happens on kmd for example I have hush running in the same server,   No issues.

[26-Aug-19 06:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Laviathon -bcmonster.com KMD does things no other chain does, such as interest, so it might only happen on KMD

@zkproofs @matthew_d_green VDF's allow stake to be time-locked w/o needing participants to register (as occurs in normal POS) so that a stake-rate can replace hashrate.

How many block need to mature? DP chain

[01-Sep-19 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD AC is 1 conf.. KMD is 100, VRSC is 100, and any chain using eras and is not LABS chain is 100

[01-Sep-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think @Alright  added -ac_maturity so you can set it to whatever you like

[01-Sep-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
correct, 100 is the default and I don't know any prod chains using anything different yet

[01-Sep-19 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
of all I have a pool for, KMD and HUSH are the only 2 that are at 100

Hi,  I'm looking for info on how to mine tBCH, BCH testnet coins, but not had any luck.  Does anyone have any info they could point me to?

[04-Sep-19 01:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
As a general rule you should be able to use either some existing bch testnet pool to mine, or if it's cpu minable then run the daemon with testnet settings.

[04-Sep-19 01:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Don't exactly know about bch mining, just giving u some ideas

[04-Sep-19 02:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Hmmmm.... in case it's not cpu minable, maybe give their social media a try, reddit, twitter, irc, slack, discord, forum mailimg lists etc etc
