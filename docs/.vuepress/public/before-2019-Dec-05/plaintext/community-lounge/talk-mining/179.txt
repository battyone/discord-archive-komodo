swapping funds of a data coin for HUSH, i know exactly how I will do it

[20-Sep-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
no idea of how to integrate BOINC

[20-Sep-19 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
but plz teach me!

[20-Sep-19 01:25 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I've never been at the developer end of BOINC and it's applications, so I am not the one to do any teaching. You'ld have to consult https://boinc.berkeley.edu/ for details. afaik they also have a github account that could clarify things

https://boinc.berkeley.edu/
BOINC
BOINC is an open-source software platform for computing using volunteered resources

[20-Sep-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 they might assume volnteers

[20-Sep-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
I assume miners who will only work for money

[20-Sep-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
without a way to turn in these coins for something more liquid, why would anybody mine it?

[20-Sep-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
It's not planned to put these data coins on exchanges

[20-Sep-19 01:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is no speculating on a pump

[20-Sep-19 01:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
as a spec miner myself, why would I mine it?

[20-Sep-19 01:31 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
You can get rewards in Gridcoin, bet they're worth peanuts

[20-Sep-19 01:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is why, these coins will be pegged to HUSH or some other coin

[20-Sep-19 01:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
and traded in

[20-Sep-19 01:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
Then they have real current value

[20-Sep-19 01:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
AtomicDEX makes it all work, on the phone

[20-Sep-19 01:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
so I think we might stay with KMD tech because so much of it is there and works

[20-Sep-19 01:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
we need to make the custom CPU/GPU miner

[20-Sep-19 01:34 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
You would be amazed where people spend their power on out of idealistic reasons. But I do understand your point and get your motivation.

[20-Sep-19 04:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@kevinkatovic 
The larger irony than you blocking the owner of a pool you're looking to find answers about is that not only did no one "steal 50%" from you, the pool also owns the fees address and the fees are eventually paid back to the miners

[20-Sep-19 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in totality, the pool currently holds 0.01469763% in fees 🤣

[20-Sep-19 06:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@dukeleto   BOINC is just a way of onboarding users,  rationale being they would rather earn something than nothing which they are currently doing.   I was thinking a system like Gridcoin where they submit “beacons” , with their contributed work and are doled our coins based on that.

@polycryptoblog maybe BOINC or gridcoin is better, not sure. it's all about mining data the most cost-effectively, to be honest

[20-Sep-19 06:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just exploratory stage now.  There is a lot of documentation on how to set things up,  here is a walkthrough of how to create a boinc app http://www.spy-hill.net/myers/help/boinc/boinc-on-linux.html

[21-Sep-19 02:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@phm87 the pool you're asking about in #komodo-team is mine
wtm likely doesn't take the PoS percentage into account

[21-Sep-19 02:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure what exactly you mean about making 12x more on one pool vs the other (not even sure which pool he said was paying more)

[21-Sep-19 02:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you mean that he's getting paid more at my pool, then the fact that my pool found 43 blocks in the last 3 hrs and your pool hasn't gotten that many in any entire day at any point in the last 13 days likely has a lot to do with it

[21-Sep-19 09:31 AM] phm87#7395
CG: my labs pool is staking labs and paying miners with pos rewards (if they are mining). We can see blocks here : https://unimining.net/site/block?id=3018
On my discord he said that your pool is paying 12 times more. But as I saw some confusion from the miner, I won t dig more.
When hashrate is on my pool, earnings are more or less the same compared to other pools.
Thank you to jl777 for the calculations for miner earnings

@Markus What do you mean?

[21-Sep-19 10:26 AM] Markus#5464
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 From what i have read its possible to snipe blocks that u want to mine, i suppose u simply scan the mempool for bigger blocks and target those blocks with ur hashpower, not sure never mined just assuming

[21-Sep-19 10:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's possible to increase your chance, but there's no guarantees
what you described is the answer to what you asked
You want CoinB block with lots of rewards....
You mine CoinA with lots of hash....
When CoinB has a lot of tx fee value you move that hash to  CoinB....
When you do/don't get those fees you go back to your preferred CoinA

[21-Sep-19 10:31 AM] Markus#5464
okay i see

Hi, I have 23 z9 mini"s...is it worth it to mine kmd?

@tomtom I would mine pirate whit them :)

Most of the mining rewards are are going to nn but pirate you get it all plus its a privacy coin :)

@tomtom you can mine KMD solo or hybrid on luckpool, and hope for some bigger block rewards occasionally or just mine the most profitable equihash coin and convert to KMD.
