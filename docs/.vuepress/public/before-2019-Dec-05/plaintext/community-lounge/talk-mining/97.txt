How is with mining pirate, are coins mined into transparent wallet and from there it doesn't go anywhere else except private address ?

[21-Jan-19 09:40 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[22-Jan-19 07:11 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
If youre mining on a pool, you will need to mine to a zaddr. If you have your own pool, the coinbase goes to a taddr

[22-Jan-19 11:36 AM] weru#4067
Thanks it's clear to me now.

[22-Jan-19 04:41 PM] Chazmainian Devil#8874
Isn't that going to be a problem-mining to a z addr. when they are migrating to sapling or just make sure you are mining to a sz address?

[22-Jan-19 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Chazmainian Devil you don't mine *to* a zaddy; the pool mines to a taddy, shields it to a zaddy, and you get your share paid to you from the pool's zaddy to your zaddy

[22-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Chazmainian Devil#8874
your sapling zaddy right?

[22-Jan-19 05:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

being a NN does increase your chances for that stuff, but I am still waiting on the first big one. The largest bonus chainstrike_SH NN has gotten so far is like 13KMD :abusedsmily:

[24-Jan-19 12:28 PM] dukeleto#7326

[24-Jan-19 12:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[24-Jan-19 12:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My largest, so far, was like 1500 (iirc) mostly mine are 4-12

[31-Jan-19 12:15 AM] sandsandwich#3906
My calculations aren't making any sense for KMD. Anyone care to tell me where I am going wrong?

Using the standard equihash calculation gives me a way higher expected coins per day.
I assume the komodo stake is messing me up

[31-Jan-19 12:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the standard equihash calculation` assumes you have a possible 1440 blocks per day to get, but you only have 25-30% of that

[31-Jan-19 12:18 AM] sandsandwich#3906
Due to the notary nodes correct?

[31-Jan-19 12:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[31-Jan-19 12:18 AM] sandsandwich#3906
if that's the case, then is there any accurate way to adjust my calculations? Do the normal equihash calculation then times it by 0.25/0.3 for my coins per day?

[31-Jan-19 12:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you have small amount of hash, lean more towards calc * 0.2 if you have large lean more towards 0.25 or 0.28

[31-Jan-19 12:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
on average the blocks come out to be about 25% for miners, but with reward blocks, we tend to get another 3-10% over a year

[31-Jan-19 12:21 AM] sandsandwich#3906
Is the block reward consistently 3 for miners?

[31-Jan-19 12:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
3+ tx fees
+ any unclaimed rewards in a tx

[31-Jan-19 12:22 AM] sandsandwich#3906
Ah ok I see.
Im looking  to short term mine KMD but the profitability doesnt seem to be beneficial for me

[31-Jan-19 12:22 AM] sandsandwich#3906
Feel I must be overlooking something

[31-Jan-19 12:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
short-term mining KMD will likely never be profitable in a bear market
