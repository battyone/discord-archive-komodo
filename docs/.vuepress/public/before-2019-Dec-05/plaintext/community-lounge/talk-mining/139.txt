Anyone thinking "GD that's fast"?

about 40 blocks during the time the ASICs are getting fully online and already diff is risen pretty high

[03-Aug-19 07:08 PM] mrlynch#5735

yes!

[03-Aug-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it went from CPU diff to 100k diff in about 40 blocks

[03-Aug-19 07:09 PM] kolo#1111
My are almost on full speed

@jl777c it can be much faster, just my trolls are slowly spinning up due to temperature fixing (done on purpose)

[03-Aug-19 07:10 PM] zawy#5864
On 1E10 attack digishield rises 4x in 50 blocks where this rises 4E9.   It's the difference between a turtle and the speed of light.

asic resistance? üòõ

[03-Aug-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
not really resistant, but coins can now have CPU most of the time with occasional ASIC visitors and be ok with it

[03-Aug-19 07:13 PM] kolo#1111
Can it be implemented on existing chains?

[03-Aug-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
another block almost a minute, 260k

it will require a hard fork, but any 100% PoW chain can have -ac_adaptivepow, will need to do it like cc activate

it looks like by the time the ASICs were 100% online, the diff was already adjusted to a one minute block, just slightly faster than a minute

[03-Aug-19 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
we see the new hash getting faster blocks, probably for 10 blocks or so, maybe less

ASICS are much instable. Can easily fluctuate at twice

[03-Aug-19 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
again we are at one minute blocks

[03-Aug-19 07:17 PM] SHossain#0007
shall i put maxdiff to 32?

[03-Aug-19 07:17 PM] SHossain#0007
it is 16 currently

[03-Aug-19 07:17 PM] kolo#1111
Seems pool diff again is problem. Loosing speed after others joined

[03-Aug-19 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, fix the diff

[03-Aug-19 07:17 PM] SHossain#0007
updating

[03-Aug-19 07:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
my minis don't want to play on your pool

[03-Aug-19 07:18 PM] SHossain#0007
restarted pool with maxdiff 32 on port 3033

[03-Aug-19 07:18 PM] SHossain#0007
port 3034 has fixed 292 diff

[03-Aug-19 07:18 PM] mrlynch#5735
don't have any btc for nh

[03-Aug-19 07:18 PM] SHossain#0007
@mrlynch maybe try to use port 3034?

[03-Aug-19 07:18 PM] kolo#1111
Restarting

[03-Aug-19 07:18 PM] mrlynch#5735
restarting

[03-Aug-19 07:19 PM] SHossain#0007
@kolo are you going to use port 3034 as well?

[03-Aug-19 07:19 PM] SHossain#0007
diff 32 might have been good for your miners, no?

[03-Aug-19 07:19 PM] kolo#1111
No, let‚Äôs keep just doubled at 3033

[03-Aug-19 07:20 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, i can double up if we experience issues

[03-Aug-19 07:20 PM] kolo#1111
I mean 32, let‚Äôs see what happens

NH require pretty high starting diff

[03-Aug-19 07:22 PM] hellcatz#5825
or it wont start

[03-Aug-19 07:22 PM] SHossain#0007
diff going down. maybe we hit the max diff of current hash

[03-Aug-19 07:23 PM] SHossain#0007
@hellcatz port 3034 is for NH

[03-Aug-19 07:23 PM] SHossain#0007
the other day NH worked with 272 maxdiff

[03-Aug-19 07:23 PM] SHossain#0007
now it's 292

[03-Aug-19 07:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
moving to 3034, not getting full speed

I was woundering about the too many coins mined per day issue when i first ready about this...glad zawy helping out with the maths

[03-Aug-19 07:24 PM] kolo#1111
@mrlynch @SHossain wait

[03-Aug-19 07:24 PM] mrlynch#5735

Just not fast

[03-Aug-19 07:24 PM] kolo#1111
Give them time

[03-Aug-19 07:25 PM] SHossain#0007
i don't think we will be able to bring diff to millions with the hash we have today

[03-Aug-19 07:25 PM] kolo#1111
I‚Äôm now back on estimated speed

[03-Aug-19 07:26 PM] SHossain#0007
@kolo can you give a call to Decker to see if he is available?

[03-Aug-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
one CPU against half a million . or 5 million, both are hopeless

[03-Aug-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
until now

[03-Aug-19 07:26 PM] kolo#1111
He can‚Äôt load NH momentary anyway

[03-Aug-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
its ok, 400k is still a very good test

[03-Aug-19 07:26 PM] zawy#5864
It needs testing with on-off at 1000x   As soon as it drops, hit it again for 10 times to see how many blocks you can get

[03-Aug-19 07:27 PM] SHossain#0007
adaptivepow makes that yesterday's news

[03-Aug-19 07:27 PM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c should we stop attack?

[03-Aug-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
stop for now

[03-Aug-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
wait until it is 1000x less and start again

[03-Aug-19 07:27 PM] SHossain#0007
@kolo @mrlynch please stop your miner

[03-Aug-19 07:27 PM] SHossain#0007
and wait for next ann please üôèüèΩ

[03-Aug-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so when diff is about 400, start again and count blocks an dtime
