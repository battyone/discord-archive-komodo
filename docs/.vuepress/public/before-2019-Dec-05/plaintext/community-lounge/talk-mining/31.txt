you, the guy who's mining "in the red", say "not really" to the guy that's loving his income üôÑ

[30-Jul-18 04:42 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
a 1080 was almost 1000‚Ç¨ for only 36Mh at 160watt?
a 1070 at half price doin 32Mh at 110w sounds better

[30-Jul-18 04:43 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
your elec rate is cheap.. thats your win and only that

[30-Jul-18 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
1080 kicks 550 sols @ 173 watts

[30-Jul-18 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not sure where you're getting "Mh" from anyway

[30-Jul-18 04:44 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
my 1070ti zotac kicks 520 sol at 115w for 470‚Ç¨/card

[30-Jul-18 04:44 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Mh stands for hashrate on ethash algo

[30-Jul-18 04:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, stop mining a shit algorithm and mine Komodo/equihash

[30-Jul-18 04:46 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
That would be a clear loss if i mine komodo

[30-Jul-18 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
see, you start off saying 1 thing, and the more you type is the more I see that no part of your issue is that thing you said

[30-Jul-18 04:47 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
price and rewards mining komodo is too low compared to the price of electricity i pay

[30-Jul-18 04:47 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
mining 8 coins a day and paying 14$ a day for elec.. nah..

[30-Jul-18 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
OK, I'm too lazy to put down my lunch and give you a grade 3 lesson in how to add and subtract; I'm sorry for you that you lost $, but you're 100% wrong about **why** you lost $

[30-Jul-18 04:48 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
if i could get +10kmd a day for 6000sol

[30-Jul-18 04:49 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
im sure you have no idea what you are talking about

[30-Jul-18 04:49 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
simple basic math.. cost for mining on elec is as high as returns..

[30-Jul-18 04:49 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
no gain üòÉ

[30-Jul-18 04:51 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
pay 0.35$/kwh and see where you would be üòâ

[30-Jul-18 04:52 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
but end of ranting here..
mining is stupid at such high rates... second hand sites are overwhelmed with rigs here ... if you are interested üòÇ

[30-Jul-18 04:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
1) if you're operating at a loss, there is no point at which it's a good plan to literally **give** part of your earnings away
2) if you can't cover your electric mining an algorithm that your cards do not excel at, then you should be mining an algorithm that your cards **do** excel at (e.g., nvidia=equihash)
3) if you can't accept that I know how much 3.5x my electric bill is, then you can't accept the fact that you're wrong

[30-Jul-18 04:55 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
i earn more on ethash algo than equihash algo with nvidea cards... how weird it sounds .. this is what i see here

[30-Jul-18 05:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
You can't be losing $ and "earning"; because, words

[30-Jul-18 05:22 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
i earn and later pay elec bill .. then eventually i lose if bill is higher than what has been earned.
sorry if i get things mixed up.. my english is not the best.

[30-Jul-18 06:03 PM] Alright#0419
@[TPUX] Djith Wattignies $14/day for 6ksol? üòï

[30-Jul-18 06:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
he's mining ETH in a pool

[30-Jul-18 06:10 PM] Alright#0419
I think buying mining hardware knowing you'd be paying >3x what the average miner pays for electricity was a bad move

[30-Jul-18 06:10 PM] Alright#0419
although, I still wouldn't stop the hardware myself

[30-Jul-18 06:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'd sell it and buy 1180Tis

[30-Jul-18 06:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
or wtfever the new name for Tis is

[30-Jul-18 06:12 PM] Alright#0419
sell it and use the money towards moving to a new country üòÇ

[30-Jul-18 06:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
but, I would have never bought a 1060 when 1070s and 1080s were out anyway...

[30-Jul-18 06:14 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_wonders if he still has the spreadsheet that he used to compare the 1060 1070 and 1080_

[30-Jul-18 06:39 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Im better in trading than mining ;)
Way better.. trading since 2007.
No worries.. it is just that all taxes, services and supplies are so rediculous expensive... i know many businesses that escaped this shithole  üòÇ

[30-Jul-18 06:42 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
So i understand if you found a very profitable way of mining that you keep it to yourself.. otherwise you give away your advantage.
Im doing the same with trading.. not telling how i trade .. for the same reason.

[30-Jul-18 06:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, I freely tell my profitable way of mining to anyone that will listen
a) buy 1080 Tis
b) mine equihash
c) don't mine in a pool and give your income away
d) if you have $5 to invest than invest that $5
e) "there ain't no half-stepping"; either you're a miner or you aren't

[30-Jul-18 06:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
that was then

[30-Jul-18 06:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
a) buy Z9 minis
 b) mine equihash
 c) don't mine in a pool and give your income away
 d) if you have $5 to invest than invest that $5
 e) "there ain't no half-stepping"; either you're a miner or you aren't

[30-Jul-18 06:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
that is now

[30-Jul-18 06:45 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
so.. anyone with 1060, 1070 cards are no miners.. ??

[30-Jul-18 06:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
anyone with 1060s and 1070s after 1080s and 1080Tis existed are either hobby miners or bad at math

[30-Jul-18 06:47 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
450 sol for 460‚Ç¨ card at 115watt doesnt seem bad at all right?

[30-Jul-18 06:48 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
or 520 sol for 480‚Ç¨ at 115watt (1070ti)

[30-Jul-18 06:48 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
I would feel bad if i had to spend 800‚Ç¨ for 550 sol and pay for 175watt

[30-Jul-18 06:50 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
If a 1080ti at 750‚Ç¨ could do 700sol at 150 watt ... that would be better..

[30-Jul-18 06:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
GeForce GTX 1080 Ti    59 C    152 W    691 Sol/s    4.55 Sol/W

[30-Jul-18 06:51 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
That is indeed better

[30-Jul-18 06:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
literal copy paste from a running rig

[30-Jul-18 06:52 PM] Alright#0419
genie, what's the OC for that card

[30-Jul-18 06:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I didn't listen to this guy... and build a rig of R280X's .... to mine equihash.... I had to steal power for 3 months to make my 'investment' back.... upside I have heaps of free gaming GPU's with dead fans. üôÉ

[30-Jul-18 06:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"a bit" üòõ

[30-Jul-18 06:52 PM] Alright#0419
I can't get a ti anywhere close to 4.55 sol/w

[30-Jul-18 06:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
joke aside, 100 350 iirc

[30-Jul-18 06:52 PM] Alright#0419
and power %?

[30-Jul-18 06:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think that rig is set at 160watts max

[30-Jul-18 06:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

got fed up with win 10

[30-Jul-18 06:56 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Now this runs perfect and smooth ..

[30-Jul-18 06:56 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`Ubuntu 18.04 here.....got fed up with win 10`
so, you went from 1 sheeple OS to another sheeple OS üòï

[30-Jul-18 06:56 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
i didnt code my own OS no sry

[30-Jul-18 06:57 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
But better and more stable than win10

[30-Jul-18 06:57 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
no updates

[30-Jul-18 06:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
admittedly Ubuntu is way better than Win 10, but if you want "stable", then you want 16, not 18

[30-Jul-18 06:57 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
what is sheeple? .. im not emglish native

[30-Jul-18 06:58 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
no probs with 18 realy..

[30-Jul-18 06:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
sheeple = people that follow the herd like sheep

[30-Jul-18 06:58 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
ah.. aren't we all üòÉ .. even those that claim not to.. they do.

[30-Jul-18 06:59 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
can use ethos or hiveos .. ok.. more features specific for mining..

[30-Jul-18 06:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_makes his own path, though it may at times diverge with the path of others, it's always his own path_

[30-Jul-18 07:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
what "features" does one need for mining? you need a wallet, a stratum, and a miner üôÑ

[31-Jul-18 06:22 PM] jansako#3330
Shut down my AC stratum today... my bags are loaded & need to mine something I can sell for the next z9 üò¶ Bitmain said they won't take REVS.  (Bots, DEX, Jumblr, Mshark, Revs, SN) I see someone else's hash has came onto some of them in the last few days.

[31-Jul-18 06:30 PM] Alright#0419
I'll buy them all from you for BTC if we can agree on a price

[31-Jul-18 06:30 PM] Alright#0419
@jansako

[31-Jul-18 06:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
buy my SN @ 41KMD each? :trollface:

[01-Aug-18 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
For anyone on linux that has jq installed and looking for znomp type peermagic for a running assetchain, I cooked this up:
`ac=SUPERNET
string=$(printf '%x\n' $(./komodo-cli -ac_name=$ac getinfo | jq '.magic'))
magic=${string: -8}
echo ${magic:6:2}${magic:4:2}${magic:2:2}${magic:0:2}`

[01-Aug-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nice, I litterally just rewrote the script from scale test to make these üò¶ LOL

[01-Aug-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Might add this into it instead and push it to my fork of your pool... simpily install pool, start all AC then run script. done pool configured.

my router finally (after like 20 hrs) just unstuffed about an hr ago from me trying to sync all of them for the 1st time on my vm üòÇ

[01-Aug-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hhaha I think my notary took a day at least when i synced it the first time on my ADSL connection. haven't had to resync them all since though.

[01-Aug-18 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, I didn't copy any of the chains that I already had over to the vm, I just ran ./assetchains and it ate everything up (even when I put a 3 minute delay between chains)

[01-Aug-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
question.... Its just a matter of setting `"p2p": { "enabled": true },`

[01-Aug-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and putting "peerMagic" into the coins.json right?

[01-Aug-18 02:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ya

[01-Aug-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sweet. should be most of the way there then, that auto config script by webworker saved me liek 5h work setting up each coin.

[01-Aug-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
needed a bit of fixing, as a few things changed, but 15m is better than hours of typing the same crap over and over

[01-Aug-18 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
a word of warning: I have no idea how much (if any) of my Knomp repo currently works; it's a WiP atm

[01-Aug-18 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the solo should work fine, but the pool version is in a state of flux

[01-Aug-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
web said he is using it... but he has some extra commits..

[01-Aug-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure what they are though

[01-Aug-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
havent got that far anyway.. I think I will make this config script with that jq comman of yours, it saves about 2-4 steps from the older version. And I can combine it with `assetchains.json` so it always pullsevery single AC from komodod repo.

[01-Aug-18 02:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
wife's bday is tomorrow and we have weekend plans, so it'll likely be a week before its stable

[01-Aug-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries...

[01-Aug-18 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im only using it for CPU mining locally.
