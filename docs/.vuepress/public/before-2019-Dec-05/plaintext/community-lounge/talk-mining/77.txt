`Komodo doesn't like pools messing with it's coin base`
Will you please go away with your misinformation and half-assed hacks

[04-Dec-18 12:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Andrei [ᴬᴸᵀᴾᴼᴼᴸ.ᴾᴿᴼ] if my CPU can mine without errors and your pool can't then your pool is malforming the block

[04-Dec-18 12:28 AM] SHossain#0007
can you guys pelase test the transition as well? just start a new chain with the following params changed in `~/komodo/src/komodo_defs.h` file
```
#define KOMODO_SAPLING_ACTIVATION 1543073054 // Sat, 24 Nov 2018 15:24:14 GMT
#define KOMODO_SAPLING_DEADLINE 1543593600 // Fri, 30 Nov 2018 16:00:00 GMT
```
change the activation time 12-24 hours in the future in a new chain.

[04-Dec-18 12:29 AM] SHossain#0007
deadline also another 12-24 hours in future after activation

[04-Dec-18 12:29 AM] SHossain#0007
so, we can be sure that the transition is smooth and doesn't stall the chain

[04-Dec-18 12:30 AM] SHossain#0007
you can use any branch except master from jl777/komodo

[04-Dec-18 12:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain I'll play with the rollover once I figure out why s-nomp is being hinky (I think it's trapped in overwinter somehow)

[04-Dec-18 12:30 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[04-Dec-18 12:31 AM] SHossain#0007
i believe James would also want results of that test

[04-Dec-18 12:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or we can just make everyone go back to CPU mining for KMD :trollface:

[04-Dec-18 12:31 AM] SHossain#0007
if you want, i can launch a new chain tomorrow

[04-Dec-18 12:31 AM] SHossain#0007
and share the activation time and chain param here

[04-Dec-18 12:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_thinks he has enough PCs to launch a test chain on his own :trollface:_

rum 👍🏽 shexy 💯

yeah, i forgot that not eveyone here has 14 core i9-9900k :trollface:

dafuq did they do to this thing? 😣

[04-Dec-18 12:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LMAO @ 14 core

[04-Dec-18 12:35 AM] SHossain#0007
you mentioned about damaging pins, so 2 cores don't work 😉

[04-Dec-18 12:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's 8 cores and 16 threads :p

[04-Dec-18 12:36 AM] SHossain#0007
-2 is 14

[04-Dec-18 12:36 AM] SHossain#0007
😛

[04-Dec-18 12:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and the bad pins are for RAM

[04-Dec-18 12:36 AM] SHossain#0007
aha.ok

[04-Dec-18 12:36 AM] Alright#0419
`getblocktemplate call failed for daemon instance 0 with error {"code":-9,"message":"Cannot get a block template while no peers are connected or chain not in sync!"}` why is this surprising, genie

[04-Dec-18 12:36 AM] Alright#0419
that's always been there, just got reworded recently

[04-Dec-18 12:36 AM] Alright#0419
Ohhh

[04-Dec-18 12:37 AM] Alright#0419
it was changed to not even give a blocktemplate

[04-Dec-18 12:37 AM] Alright#0419
previously it was just an annoying message

[04-Dec-18 12:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why is this surprising, genie`
piling shit on top of shit on top of shit doesn't surprise me that shit goes wrong, just that __they keep doing it__

[04-Dec-18 12:37 AM] Alright#0419
zcash?

[04-Dec-18 12:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
everyone

[04-Dec-18 12:38 AM] Alright#0419
I imagine they did that to make it *slightly* more annoying for someone trying to selfish mine

[04-Dec-18 12:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
everyone is so worried about "breaking backwards compatibility" that there's still shit in the core of the code that's designed around making a PentiumII setup work and monitoring throu a website that 99% of people have never heard of

[04-Dec-18 12:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
literally no one uses NewRelic
posix is pointless and even if it weren't it needs root/sudo to be applied
and that's just my take on the 1st 50 lines of init :trollface:

[04-Dec-18 12:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I imagine they did that to make it slightly more annoying for someone trying to selfish mine`
no, it's because there's some things that should be async and some things that shouldn't

[04-Dec-18 12:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_goes back to his troll-hole and stops ranting_

[04-Dec-18 12:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Andrei [ᴬᴸᵀᴾᴼᴼᴸ.ᴾᴿᴼ] for 50% of any bounty you get, I can tell you what s-nomp is doing wrong that gets you errors....

[04-Dec-18 01:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, I am 😛

[04-Dec-18 01:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was nice enough to only use 1 1080ti

[04-Dec-18 01:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only took the diff from 59 to 80

ok, now to port changes and config to chickenpool and I'm done for the day

[04-Dec-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
whats this bounty  I would sya my pool will just autmatically work

[04-Dec-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
free KMD?

[04-Dec-18 01:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
did you code the payout yet?

[04-Dec-18 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I assume it will just work unless hseilding

[04-Dec-18 01:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
never assume

[04-Dec-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doing it today... ben sick last 2 days took rest time

[04-Dec-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
reaklly needed it

[04-Dec-18 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What are the exact conditons of theis bounty ?
1) the pool must work with sapling, ie mine blocks and make payouts ?
2) work with KMD

[04-Dec-18 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is this all ?

[04-Dec-18 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if my solutin works... its been avalible the whoel time

[04-Dec-18 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so I take it ... testing now

[04-Dec-18 01:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if my solutin works... its been avalible the whoel time`
so has s-nomp, so what's your point?

[04-Dec-18 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then why is ther ea bounty ?

[04-Dec-18 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[04-Dec-18 01:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has no idea why you're so insistent on creating extra bullshit on top of bullshit_

[04-Dec-18 01:36 AM] Alright#0419
the bounty doesn't make any sense whatsoever

[04-Dec-18 01:36 AM] Alright#0419
the software has been available for a couple weeks now

[04-Dec-18 01:37 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 because it "just works"

[04-Dec-18 01:37 AM] Alright#0419
with any chain you throw at it

[04-Dec-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am actuay; doign the revers of that geniw but im not arguing about it any more ... thatsa pointless

[04-Dec-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the payment processor uses a sendmay with the daemon

[04-Dec-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so iut will just work

[04-Dec-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it does nt create txs

[04-Dec-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was sick and couldnt test it

[04-Dec-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
SO i posted here to see of someone else would

[04-Dec-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
clearly the bounty is s-nomps or mine  :trollface:

[04-Dec-18 01:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_says "wtfever" and goes back to 📺 while people keep adding piles of shit on top of piles of shit rather than actually making something for komodo_

[04-Dec-18 01:40 AM] Alright#0419
he made something for komodo and every other asset chain

[04-Dec-18 01:40 AM] Alright#0419
supports parameters that don't even exist yet

[04-Dec-18 01:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`he made something for komodo and every other asset chain`
making it z-nomp literally use the blocktemplate isn't "making something for komodo", it's half-assing some already half-assed shit kinda work with a gajillion levels of extra complexity in the payments

[04-Dec-18 01:42 AM] Alright#0419
it will work for literally any chain you throw at it

[04-Dec-18 01:42 AM] Alright#0419
your solution needs a solution for each additional parameter that changes coinbase

[04-Dec-18 01:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`thought that was the purpose of knomp honestly, i feel abandoned @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 come back`
kemp will be what that was going to be, but better, because it's using a full tx lib rather than the shit zcl/zec stripped out

[04-Dec-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You would be surprise how easy the payments processor wasy

[04-Dec-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its like 4 line sof extra code 😂

[04-Dec-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the stratum is 2 line sof eztra code

[04-Dec-18 01:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`its like 4 line sof extra code`
and 900000000000000000000000000 extra stores in redis

[04-Dec-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure how

[04-Dec-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It adds 1 extra address for each defined pool address

[04-Dec-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
same as 1 miner

[04-Dec-18 01:44 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 will your stratum support ac_script?

{Reactions}
💯 

[04-Dec-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pool becomes a miner

[04-Dec-18 01:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`not sure how`
because feken math
1+1=2

[04-Dec-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Geinie bounty of 1000 KMD to amke your stratum work with sc_script 😄

[04-Dec-18 01:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright it will support anything that can be mined

[04-Dec-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can have the sapling bounty

`you're both working towards the same thing`
yes, but my answer isn't "add more shit to the shit zcl feked over 300 ways to Sunday"

[04-Dec-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So your starting itfrom scrach ?

[04-Dec-18 01:47 AM] Alright#0419
he barely added anything

[04-Dec-18 01:47 AM] Alright#0419
most of the work was in the daemon

[04-Dec-18 01:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`So your starting itfrom scrach ?`
damn near, yes
