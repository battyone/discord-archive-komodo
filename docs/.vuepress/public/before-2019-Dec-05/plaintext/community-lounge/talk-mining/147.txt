for some reason it feels like a precision machine instead of software

[05-Aug-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
even when it makes to way too hard, after 7 minutes the exponential kicks in and blocks come out

[05-Aug-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
ht.83

[05-Aug-19 05:15 PM] zawy#5864
did that happen?

[05-Aug-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes a few times

[05-Aug-19 05:16 PM] zawy#5864
already?

[05-Aug-19 05:16 PM] zawy#5864
i mean in this sequence?

[05-Aug-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[05-Aug-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
that is how it got some blocks

[05-Aug-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
10 blocks in 5 minutes

[05-Aug-19 05:16 PM] zawy#5864
I need to see the CSV

[05-Aug-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i wasnt sure if exponential should have precedence, but it seemed that exponential would always be easier than otherwise, so if it triggers, it takes precedence

[05-Aug-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
as max() involving the exponential would always be the exponential

[05-Aug-19 05:18 PM] zawy#5864
I want to avoid exp, especially at this low HR increases

[05-Aug-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
altK never makes it easier though? or should i make it so if altK triggers, exponential is disabled?

[05-Aug-19 05:18 PM] zawy#5864
maybe it should have hit once after startup, but not twice

[05-Aug-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
how will the diff ever go up?

[05-Aug-19 05:19 PM] zawy#5864
no no,  I should not have something that  causes  delays > 7 at < 20x increases in hashrate

[05-Aug-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
j and ii at 48 and 49

[05-Aug-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i know why!

[05-Aug-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
remember all the early blocks

[05-Aug-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
they are still in the past+W window

[05-Aug-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to get past 120 to get beyond that

[05-Aug-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so it sees 40 fast blocks and is slowing things down

[05-Aug-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
for a proper test, we needed to run at 1x for 64+ blocks after it adjusted to 1 block per minute

[05-Aug-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
chain started at 18:30, now is 19:22, but there are 85 blocks

[05-Aug-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it got a few more blocks

[05-Aug-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
my guess is that it will need to get to where there are 60 blocks in an hour before it stops hitting the brakes

[05-Aug-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
so far this is working amazingly well

[05-Aug-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
14 blocks in 14 minutes at 5x

[05-Aug-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
not any extra blocks

[05-Aug-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
even with the exponential kicking in

[05-Aug-19 05:25 PM] zawy#5864
except for the first ones?

[05-Aug-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
87 blocks since chain start 55 min ago

[05-Aug-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
so it will still need 32 more slow blocks

[05-Aug-19 05:25 PM] zawy#5864
hopefully the exp will stop kicking in under normal conditions.......you will never have 64 1-second blocks under normal conditions

[05-Aug-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe at that point, the diff will stablize at the 5x level

[05-Aug-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
this looking at elapsed times is how i look at block production and now the blockchain is doing the same, but with algorithmic precision!

[05-Aug-19 05:27 PM] zawy#5864
what was avg solvetime for 1st 64?

[05-Aug-19 05:27 PM] zawy#5864
or, how long did they take

[05-Aug-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
25 minutes

[05-Aug-19 05:28 PM] zawy#5864
so it got 39 free and it's still 32 blocks behind

[05-Aug-19 05:28 PM] zawy#5864
but only because it did not kick in immediately

[05-Aug-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it only kicked in at 64

[05-Aug-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
so in 25 blocks, it caught up by 7

[05-Aug-19 05:29 PM] zawy#5864
and as the 50 window passes, it will forget that the emission schedule is ahead

[05-Aug-19 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the longer W will help a bit

[05-Aug-19 05:30 PM] zawy#5864
We just need to see it under non-genesis conditions to see if exp is kicing in too much.

[05-Aug-19 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
diff is up to 3

[05-Aug-19 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, need to get to 128 and wait for diff to stabilize

[05-Aug-19 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
then the test to 15x, which would be a 3x test would have a stable starting point

[05-Aug-19 05:31 PM] zawy#5864
as soon as i does not reach 0, the triggers have stopped and we can begin better

[05-Aug-19 05:32 PM] zawy#5864
we need a plot of solvetimes, hashrate, and difficulty

[05-Aug-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
exponentials are not kicking in anymore

[05-Aug-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
its finding blocks via altK

[05-Aug-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
diff 3.8

[05-Aug-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
23 blocks in 23 minutes since 5x, which is spooky

[05-Aug-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
j is up to 49

[05-Aug-19 05:34 PM] zawy#5864
I'm afrad the genesis thing will not be the main reason exp was activated

[05-Aug-19 05:35 PM] zawy#5864
will you know if i does not reach 0 ?  Everything starts over when it does not

[05-Aug-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
the printouts should stop

[05-Aug-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
somehow it is slowing the blocks but the diff keeps rising

[05-Aug-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so that seems to be a big improvement

[05-Aug-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
the genesis easy blocks made it boost the diff too much, which makes the exponential kick in

[05-Aug-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
in spite of all this is it making headway, thought the exponential kicking in allows a few easy blocks so really hurts things, if the exponential was just one block, we would be almost at 1 minute per block from genesis now

[05-Aug-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
i think as long as it works happy from a stable baseline, there is no need to worry about the genesis issue. we were just impatient to see it in action

[05-Aug-19 05:43 PM] zawy#5864
I need to see the solvetimes, targets, and ideally hashrate

[05-Aug-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i will need to write some code to extract that from the blockchain, unless someone already has such

[05-Aug-19 05:45 PM] zawy#5864
i guess you can't know hashrate unless writing it down

[05-Aug-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
at height 73, i went to 5 cores. that is the only change, though there was some time no mining due to debugging. i will write the CSV generator

[05-Aug-19 05:46 PM] zawy#5864
I have a perl script for Zcash if that would help

[05-Aug-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
no need, this is easy enough and a useful rpc call to have

[05-Aug-19 06:19 PM] zawy#5864
In next version It should probably switch back to digi if current  solvetime is so long that excess blocks have been overcome (instead of letting it go to exp)

[05-Aug-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
but what if it is diff stranded?

[05-Aug-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
and the excess blocks were never overcome when the exponential was triggred

[05-Aug-19 06:34 PM] zawy#5864
Yes and that case the exponential would still be active

[05-Aug-19 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
its still getting to 0, ht 163, diff 3.5 and diff is still about half what it should be

[05-Aug-19 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the 6 and 12 would help?

[05-Aug-19 06:36 PM] zawy#5864
No this should be working fine under these near normal conditions. I need to see the data to diagnose it

[05-Aug-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, will get you the .csv file as soon as the new daemon builds

[05-Aug-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
it feels as if the diff adjustment is too steep, often it cant find a block

[05-Aug-19 06:39 PM] zawy#5864
Yeah, it's overshooting and going into the exp() which causes it to keep losing blocks

[05-Aug-19 06:39 PM] zawy#5864
(too man)

[05-Aug-19 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
it hasnt gone into exponential for a while

[05-Aug-19 06:39 PM] zawy#5864
how many blocks per time now?

[05-Aug-19 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
its maintaining close to 1 minute . per block since it went to 5x, a bit faster

[05-Aug-19 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
95 blocks in 90 minutes, something like that. the reason seems to be that the diff is still at 3

[05-Aug-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
with the delays, it prevents the diff from going up

[05-Aug-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so while blocktimes are close to one per minute, the diff is artificially low. which i guess if blocks are at the target time, it doesnt really matter that much

[05-Aug-19 06:43 PM] zawy#5864
so it gets 2 or 3 blocks fast then has a longer delay?

[05-Aug-19 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is what it seems to be doing

[05-Aug-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810

maybe a 3 block average bnTarget?

[05-Aug-19 06:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
wow.. got to 16 ğŸ˜³

[05-Aug-19 06:52 PM] zawy#5864
digisheild is seeing long solvetimes relative to the targets being reported

[05-Aug-19 06:53 PM] mrlynch#5735
when do you folks sleep?

[05-Aug-19 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
@mrlynch that doesnt count the 20+ ZAWY15 i did to try to fix the 15x CPU attack, it didnt need more than my two nodes, so i could wipe and start over with same name

{Reactions}
ğŸ˜… 

[05-Aug-19 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
diff rose a bit to 4.3

[05-Aug-19 07:00 PM] zawy#5864
it should stop triggering at about 191

[05-Aug-19 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
199 and still triggering, with diff at half what it should be, it is able to mine faster on the blocks it doesnt kick in, which makes it kick in the next block
