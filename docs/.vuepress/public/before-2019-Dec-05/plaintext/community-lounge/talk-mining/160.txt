yeah, this takes long but is more stable.  We could make RSt slower, but generally this one has the other feature of not needingo to mess with targets

[07-Aug-19 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
i think total deficit wise it might be about the same or a bit worse, but the problem with RST is when it stops

[07-Aug-19 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
and this one is super simple

[07-Aug-19 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i am thinking we can make it converge even faster by taking into account recent solvetimes

[07-Aug-19 08:56 PM] zawy#5864
Like I'm saying RST does nto need to stop and could be W=5, but this one has a purity advantage.  It craps out on me at times, so I need to found out why

[07-Aug-19 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
and at 60 seconds the diff is unchanged and if it takes longer it makes the diff easier, so it seems to be working

[07-Aug-19 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
can we combine the attribute of RST of rapidly making up for lost time, with TSA smoothness?

[07-Aug-19 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
what about simply using the recent implied hashrate?

[07-Aug-19 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
if the solvetimes indicate there is N times as much hashrate as the bnTarget, then make it N/2 times as hard

[07-Aug-19 08:58 PM] zawy#5864
I don't know if this can be made faster

[07-Aug-19 08:59 PM] zawy#5864
The diff that miners face is jumping around a lot

[07-Aug-19 08:59 PM] zawy#5864
I mean, isn't it?

[07-Aug-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems quite constrained, 2x more diff to start, 1x after T

[07-Aug-19 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the range can be increased?

[07-Aug-19 09:00 PM] zawy#5864
I thought the 2.72 fixed the stopping problem

[07-Aug-19 09:00 PM] zawy#5864
once target matches HR, this TSA is supposed to jump around a LOT

[07-Aug-19 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess we will find out soon

[07-Aug-19 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the RST needs a averaging to smooth out the bouncing around of diff

[07-Aug-19 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
untuned TSA is quite good. i think with some tuning it can get the good parts of RST, it is just using the prev target, which seems very limited info

[07-Aug-19 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
what about a TSA3 that looks at prev, prev+prev2, prev+prev2+prev3

[07-Aug-19 09:02 PM] zawy#5864
I guess the jumps  I didn't like about it were because it did not use tipdiff........you're going to really like this one once you look at solvetime stbility

[07-Aug-19 09:03 PM] zawy#5864
solvetime will be so close to target you're going to risk collisions

[07-Aug-19 09:03 PM] zawy#5864
I suppose now I can make my TSA article a lot simpler

[07-Aug-19 09:04 PM] zawy#5864
watach...I bet you have only some outside the 45 to 80 second range

[07-Aug-19 09:04 PM] zawy#5864
hmm, guess i'm wrong

[07-Aug-19 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
the thing is that i see occasional crazy fast solves

[07-Aug-19 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
implied hashrate that solves 400 to 1000 diff

[07-Aug-19 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
just due to randomness

[07-Aug-19 09:04 PM] zawy#5864
oh right..they will follow a slow solve

[07-Aug-19 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
no, i mean the miners get really lucky sometimes, and also really unlucky sometimes

[07-Aug-19 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
19 blocks and diff is at 85, which is close to what i think it should be

[07-Aug-19 09:05 PM] zawy#5864
You should only rarely see a > 2.5T which is very common in normal DA

[07-Aug-19 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
but it just had a 15 second solve of a 200 diff, for implied 800

[07-Aug-19 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
TSA gets exponentially easier the longer it takes?

[07-Aug-19 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
so it solves the diff stranding too

[07-Aug-19 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and its symmetric

[07-Aug-19 09:06 PM] zawy#5864
You should be seeing the green line in this chart

with only 15 cores, not sure it will be such a nice plot

[07-Aug-19 09:08 PM] zawy#5864
Correction, green is without the 1/2.  You should see the bottom right historgram here:

[07-Aug-19 09:09 PM] zawy#5864
That's with T=100

[07-Aug-19 09:10 PM] zawy#5864
So you basically won't hardly see tipdiff > 180

[07-Aug-19 09:10 PM] jl777c#5810
true, so far 134 is the biggest

[07-Aug-19 09:10 PM] zawy#5864
And with this distribution, yuo actually have fewer cllisions because it's not bunched at fast solves as much as regular DAs

[07-Aug-19 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
is there a way to make it do 10x when tipdiff is small?

[07-Aug-19 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems only 2x

[07-Aug-19 09:12 PM] zawy#5864
not messing with it is why you don't need to adjust targets

[07-Aug-19 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
that would give it the dynamic range to adjust very fast

[07-Aug-19 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
talking about messing with the equation ðŸ˜ƒ

[07-Aug-19 09:12 PM] zawy#5864
uh oh

[07-Aug-19 09:12 PM] zawy#5864
yes, you can do it without messing up targets

[07-Aug-19 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
if it went from 10x at tipdiff 2 to 1x at tipdiff 60

[07-Aug-19 09:13 PM] zawy#5864
If you make it harder on fast solves, you have to make it easier on slower sovles

[07-Aug-19 09:13 PM] zawy#5864
so you can shift the curve to the right

[07-Aug-19 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt it get exponentially easier the larger tipdiff gets?

[07-Aug-19 09:14 PM] zawy#5864
no, on both ends it is not as fast as straight simple e^x like the exp() drop

[07-Aug-19 09:14 PM] jl777c#5810
but it seems to start at 2x more difficult take 60 seconds to get to 1x, then i assume eventually will be able to get to 0.001x and smaller

[07-Aug-19 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise it couldnt fix a diff stranding

[07-Aug-19 09:16 PM] zawy#5864
I think if you choose an e^x function on the high end, you can use a e^(-x) on the low end and targets might come out OK, but if not    experimentation can determine their exact k constants in e^(kx)

[07-Aug-19 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
need to think about all these results, i feel there is enough here to make a near perfect DAA

[07-Aug-19 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
fantastic progress today! helps to properly implement things

[07-Aug-19 09:19 PM] zawy#5864
This one's  simple, does not need target work, and is theoretically very sound.      Yuo just need to see how long it will take to respond to 1000x    I myself don't know.....I did    not   check that when that computer was running

[07-Aug-19 09:20 PM] zawy#5864
OH, i'm not sure it can drop like exp()

[07-Aug-19 09:21 PM] zawy#5864
so you'll have an excess coin emission problem if it's not made symmetrical on the high and low ends by shifting to an e^x function

[07-Aug-19 09:22 PM] zawy#5864
i mean excess emission problem if you have to keep exp without making the equal and opposite function on the low end of this

[07-Aug-19 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
testing a TSA+RST hybrid

[07-Aug-19 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
basically using TSA instead of digishield

[07-Aug-19 09:23 PM] zawy#5864
With this, you can make e^x weaker and start at 3xT so it merges smoothly with this ,then I can do experiments to find it's symmetrical solution on the low side.  To make 3^x in exp "weaker" use something like the 1/2

[07-Aug-19 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
will keep the pure TSA chain running

[07-Aug-19 09:25 PM] zawy#5864
I do not think you need to make sure emission stays on track with this....it does it automatically.

[07-Aug-19 09:25 PM] jl777c#5810
how can it by looking at only prevtarget?

[07-Aug-19 09:27 PM] zawy#5864
the blocks after it are automatically penalized....I had to throw in the penalty in RST.  Similarly if you use 3^x on the ends of this to make it faster, I might have to use the RSt trick

[07-Aug-19 09:27 PM] zawy#5864
This EMA is special

[07-Aug-19 09:28 PM] zawy#5864
It's because it's a rolling average in disguise

[07-Aug-19 09:32 PM] zawy#5864
rolling averages make sure the window did not release too many blocks.  EMA is a moving average that gives expontially more weight to the most recent blocks.  Careful math shows how this results in only needing to adjust based on the current block

[07-Aug-19 09:32 PM] jl777c#5810
amazing

[07-Aug-19 09:37 PM] zawy#5864
The memory of the current adjustment lingers in future adjustments because if it was made higher, each of the next few blocks will be higher penalizing the later blocks for what was lost in previous blocks.....but the penalty exponentially decreases, so the big miner staying on a few blocks gets most of the penalty himself

[07-Aug-19 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
of course! ct[0]

[07-Aug-19 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it is like X = (X * 0.9) + (0.1 * newval)

[07-Aug-19 09:39 PM] zawy#5864
It and LWMA are the most common method to estimate current stock price....but this ema is special and exactly like the stock emas.

[07-Aug-19 09:45 PM] zawy#5864
I mean NOT exactly like the one used for stocks

[07-Aug-19 09:47 PM] zawy#5864
After the fact, I found out this specific form was in wikipedia, almost like an interesting after thought applied to electronic equipment production.  Jacob was trying to derive something frmo wikipedia and his intuition, but I don't think he ever realized he had come up with what they showed about 2 sections after he stopped reading.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Application_to_measuring_computer_performance

[07-Aug-19 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
i have a lot of experience with time series, specifically forex

[07-Aug-19 09:48 PM] zawy#5864
then later tom harding made a simpler EMA and I was able to show them why it was almost exactly the same as Jaconds.

[07-Aug-19 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
just didnt use such fancy maths with consensus requirements

[07-Aug-19 09:49 PM] zawy#5864
It goes deeper in this application because the poisson distribution is e^x

[07-Aug-19 09:49 PM] jl777c#5810
so basically TSA is a finely tuned magic math, so best to not mess with it

[07-Aug-19 09:49 PM] zawy#5864
it's automatically synmetrical ina  deeper sense than LWMA:  LWMA drops faster than it rises.  EMA rises and falls at the same speed if hashrate is constant

[07-Aug-19 09:50 PM] zawy#5864
EMA is.  TSA is just applying to to tipdiff

[07-Aug-19 09:50 PM] jl777c#5810
you dont think TSA applied to more data points wont do better?

[07-Aug-19 09:50 PM] jl777c#5810
reduce the jumping around

[07-Aug-19 09:50 PM] zawy#5864
But amazingly we were able to make the RST work..

[07-Aug-19 09:51 PM] zawy#5864
you will lose response.  I've tried everything

[07-Aug-19 09:51 PM] zawy#5864
yuo can't average past targets or past solvetimes and do any better without losing something

however............
