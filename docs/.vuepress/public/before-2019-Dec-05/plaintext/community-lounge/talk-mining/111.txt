[22-Mar-19 09:45 AM] Alright#0419
Let's see if he responds sometime soon, if not I'll make a git issue for it

[22-Mar-19 09:45 AM] Alright#0419
what version are you using?

[22-Mar-19 09:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
3.4

[22-Mar-19 09:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
downloaded latest from git yesterday so should be good

[22-Mar-19 09:50 AM] Alright#0419
@MadMaX you  have alerts for when those happen?

[22-Mar-19 09:50 AM] CHMEX#0686
it does the same for PIZZA and BEER fyi

[22-Mar-19 09:50 AM] Alright#0419
BEER and PIZZA have exceptions to fake notarizations I believe

[22-Mar-19 09:50 AM] Alright#0419
being test chains

[22-Mar-19 09:53 AM] pbca26#5430
@Alright fixed
should be no shield icon for pizza/beer in lite mode
will check native

[22-Mar-19 09:54 AM] Alright#0419
Please check PTX chain, that was what was in question

[22-Mar-19 09:54 AM] Alright#0419
not sure it's the same issue or not

[22-Mar-19 09:54 AM] Alright#0419
PIZZA and BEER are special cases

[22-Mar-19 09:54 AM] pbca26#5430
i did and removed it from dpow coins list

[22-Mar-19 09:54 AM] Alright#0419
Ah nice, sorry to bother you 😛

[22-Mar-19 10:00 AM] pbca26#5430
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pbca26/agama-wallet-lib/dev/src/electrum-servers-dpow.js
fyi this is the whole list i'm using in agama
3rd party coins are not included because their electrums lack necessary bits of data

@MadMaX that couldn't have come at a better time :shexy:

[22-Mar-19 10:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Cryptoon if PTX is what you're mining, you have no fear from me, I want you to mine more so that I can stake more 😛

[22-Mar-19 10:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Explain? :p

[22-Mar-19 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`PoS 77% vs target 50% `

[22-Mar-19 12:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Because not many people mining? Might explain why sometimes not many blocks

[22-Mar-19 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As a side note: loyal miners on chickenpool have received bonuses for sticking around during/after server issues and an additional bump from this morning's reward block
(it's only a small token of thanks, but it is what it is)

[22-Mar-19 03:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
OMFG why didn't I get back on Chickenpool when you fired it back up!  Dammit!  😛

[22-Mar-19 04:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont let it happen again Fishy!

Selling my Z9 mini - looking for around USD $275 plus postage on top (I am in New Zealand) or will accept equivalent in crypto as well.

It’s a 2nd batch with 1st batch software.

[23-Mar-19 03:02 AM] bishop#9773
@Lumbi so two blackminers, that's nothing

[23-Mar-19 04:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
i expect to see a lot of z9 mini's go on firesale prices in the coming weeks, as z11's get shipped and big miners go thru an upgrade cycle

[23-Mar-19 10:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
for staking setgenerate true 0

[23-Mar-19 10:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But when I use getmininginfo it shows staking = false

[23-Mar-19 10:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But I guess I am staking anyway right?

[23-Mar-19 10:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you're staking then `getmininginfo` will have
```JSON
  "staking": true,```

[23-Mar-19 10:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm

[23-Mar-19 10:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But it also shows setgenerate true thread 0

[23-Mar-19 10:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[23-Mar-19 10:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
getmininginfo

[23-Mar-19 10:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you mean `numthreads`?

[23-Mar-19 10:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if so, afaik, that's 0 unless x threads of PoW

[23-Mar-19 10:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

that's one of mine

[23-Mar-19 10:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
ok, but what is the command for setting it to stake? setgenerate true 0 ?

[23-Mar-19 10:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
didnt find a conclusive answer in the docs

[23-Mar-19 10:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=CHAINX setgenerate true 0`

[23-Mar-19 10:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm that's what I did, maybe I forgot to turn off pow mining first

[23-Mar-19 10:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
try again later

[23-Mar-19 10:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Thx CG 😃

[23-Mar-19 10:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it will auto shut off any existing miner threads when you issue a new command

[23-Mar-19 10:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you're doing PoW and tell it to PoS, it will kill the PoW
you can run false in between if you like, but it's not necessary

[23-Mar-19 10:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
got it

[23-Mar-19 11:25 AM] CHMEX#0686
explorers are back let me you if one you are using is down

tnks @CHMEX

[23-Mar-19 06:14 PM] Lumbi#8378
@bishop only 2 ? I guess there's more where that came from... 😄

[23-Mar-19 06:16 PM] Lumbi#8378
the genius of v1_vhash is:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=LUMBER setgenerate true 32 ```

[23-Mar-19 06:16 PM] Lumbi#8378
after

[23-Mar-19 06:17 PM] Lumbi#8378
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=LUMBER setgenerate true 0 ```

[23-Mar-19 06:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
32?
@Lumbi what kind of beast are you running?

[23-Mar-19 06:58 PM] bishop#9773
@Lumbi F1s do 64GH on verus 1.0 which your silly coin is... you do the math

[23-Mar-19 07:25 PM] Lumbi#8378
@bishop one of the silliest things about a hybrid pos/pow is the difficulty adjustment 😄

[23-Mar-19 07:26 PM] Lumbi#8378
640 GH/s is less hard to achieve with v1 FPGAs than with GPUs

[23-Mar-19 07:29 PM] bishop#9773
I'm simply saying that to compare your v1 hashrate to other asset chains isn't apples-to-apples, especially when the pow side of things can be done with a handful of fpgas. This whole thing started because of your comments about 135 gh on lumber

[23-Mar-19 07:31 PM] Lumbi#8378
yes of course... I think the highest we had at any one time was 990 GH/s

[23-Mar-19 07:33 PM] Lumbi#8378
a decentralized mining base along with pos is more important than total hashrate at any given point in time

[23-Mar-19 07:35 PM] bishop#9773
So then you bringing up the nethash on your coin serves no purpose. Besides, lumber isn't decentralized from a mining perspective  😛

[23-Mar-19 07:42 PM] Lumbi#8378
perhaps not in the traditional sense of the word, but from the standpoint of practicality, the only thing it is lacking is more publicity 😉

[23-Mar-19 07:43 PM] Lumbi#8378
less wasted energy

I calculated my daily KMD mining rewards but i am sure i am making a huge mistake. I should be able to do 29 megahash/s with my RX 480, according to a calculator i would be getting 1700 KMD PER DAY. That cant be right?

[24-Mar-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
only 1080 KMD per day for miners, so 1700 would indeed be impossible

[24-Mar-19 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
also impossible to get 29 Msols on any single ASIC, fastest is about 0.2Msols. maybe you are calculating SHA256 hashes? that has no use for mining equihash

[24-Mar-19 01:30 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Well given that i am a tech noob i am sure i made a big calculation mistake

[24-Mar-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
i can confirm that

[24-Mar-19 01:32 PM] CoinKing88#1540
At least i am a top 300 holder of the DEX coin since 10 minutes, so my future is bright even if i dont know what i am doing. 😂

🚀

[24-Mar-19 01:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Select equihash, I dont see the option for equihash on the gpu tab on whattomine, so not sure how much hash you can do with that gpu...

[24-Mar-19 01:37 PM] CoinKing88#1540
https://whattomine.com/coins/174-kmd-equihash, i need to input h/s, so 29.2 mh = 29000 hash?

` I should be able to do 29 megahash/s with my RX 480`
You can't even get 1/100th of that with  2 ASICs

[24-Mar-19 02:11 PM] MyName#0491
From what I see, Cryptoon is about right; an RX 480 should be in the ballpark of 280-300 Sol/s

[24-Mar-19 06:08 PM] newvulcan#4719
Hi. I'm having an issue with mining Pirate and Komodo with komodod and knomp on my Linux server. I thought I had these working, but on closer inspection although my mining machines are being authorised, they keep coming up with a "re-joining" message and no shares are being recorded (no invalid ones either). I have another coin, Zaddex which is working fine.

My pirate.json file is:

{
"name": "PIRATE",
"symbol": "ARRR",
"algorithm": "equihash",
"txfee": 0.0001,
"requireShielding": true,
"sapling": true,
"disablecb":true,
"privateChain":true,
"burnFees": true
}


and my komodod start command is:

./komodod -addnode=136.243.102.225 -ac_private=1 -ac_supply=0 -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777

[24-Mar-19 07:22 PM] Alright#0419
@newvulcan do not use `disablecb` for PIRATE

[24-Mar-19 07:23 PM] Alright#0419
That's basically the one exception that `disablecb` won't work for properly. You can use it for solo mining, but if you need to split the cb into multiple vouts, it will not work

[25-Mar-19 03:24 PM] Lumbi#8378
any ol' cpu will do 😄 https://lmbr.mcmpool.eu/

Please, tell me that it's at least miketout's fork of it...

[25-Mar-19 03:44 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Will give the Komodo Community and Ecosystem  first shot before I start putting them on eBay.   Selling Antminer Z9 full size and Antminer X3 .  650 ( BTC/KMD , willing to consider other cryptos at a higher price )  for Z9,   X3 for 350.  Also 1 Z9 Mini Batch 1 (175) and 5 Baikal B.  (100) PSUs included . Buyer pays shipping cost.

[25-Mar-19 03:47 PM] MyName#0491
@polycryptoblog that a single z9 @ 650 or are you selling multiple units @ 650 each?

[25-Mar-19 03:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Multiple units.

[25-Mar-19 03:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Same with the x3s

[25-Mar-19 03:49 PM] MyName#0491
I'm guessing you picked up some Z11s?

[25-Mar-19 03:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Going too here soon

[25-Mar-19 03:50 PM] MyName#0491
I'm going to have to start stay up nights, they keep selling out before I even get out of bed

[25-Mar-19 03:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
A9++ I’m looking at

[25-Mar-19 03:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Slightly more hash slightly more power

[25-Mar-19 03:51 PM] MyName#0491
I was about to buy A9+ until the Z11 came out, now I dunno wtf to do 🤷

[25-Mar-19 03:51 PM] MyName#0491
I've missed all 3 of the Z11 batches 😭
