Anyone having trouble accessing Luckpool at this time? I'm receiving "Your Connection is Not Private" for its website.

[29-Nov-19 04:40 AM] Micah68#5652
It's now available.... strange.

Probably non-updated certificate

Yes, there was an issue with the ssl certificate that was resolved pretty quickly ...
