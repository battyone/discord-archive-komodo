anyone see bitmain removed the APW3++ for APW7,  which is max 1000w .   looks like they are shifting down power consumption of their asics

[29-Jun-18 12:25 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I've only ever had the apw3++

[29-Jun-18 12:25 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Every miner I've ordered has came with that

[29-Jun-18 10:41 AM] Cye#9860
Is Komodo ASIC resistant and if so will Komodo defend KMD if ASIC miners are found on network or does Komodo follow Zcash decision and do nothing?

[29-Jun-18 10:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Cye   There's a discussion about that above. ‚òù

[29-Jun-18 10:45 AM] Cye#9860
Ok so Komodo are still deciding same as Zcash?

[29-Jun-18 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
should we defent 1060 GPU owners from 1080 GPU miners?

[29-Jun-18 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and if we need to defend the existing hardware base of miners, does that mean we cant ever allow using new hardware?

[29-Jun-18 10:52 AM] Cye#9860
Ok so Komodo won't defend against ASIC miners I take it. I stopped mining Zcash because they did not defend their ASIC resistance. For me it's more about ethics, if you say a coin is ASIC resistant then get a backbone and don't be a coward when it comes time to fight off Centralised Bitmain ASIC miners, it's a hostile takeover of network. It's so bad they almost have 51% of Bitcoin Network now.
I just think it's sad to watch projects not defend themselves.

[29-Jun-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
when did we say KMD was ASIC resistant?

[29-Jun-18 10:53 AM] jansako#3330
@jl777c would it be appropriate to ask the marketing group to put up a statement about ASICs and we can just refer anyone to it?

[29-Jun-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
you didnt answer my questions about the 1060 miners

[29-Jun-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
how is it fair to them that 1080 comes out and outperforms?

[29-Jun-18 10:54 AM] jansako#3330
otherwise we will have the same discussion going round and round...

[29-Jun-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we need to make a 1060 miner subsidy?

[29-Jun-18 10:54 AM] Cye#9860
For me most projects get support from the start from the community, CPU & GPU miners. They enable the projects to grow. For them to just get shafted when Bitmain takes an interest and starts secretly mining the network with ASICs just seems like a double-cross

[29-Jun-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
do you see how nonsense that all becomes?

[29-Jun-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
plz answer questions about 1060 miner

[29-Jun-18 10:55 AM] Cye#9860
For me GPU is GPU

[29-Jun-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
what about CPU miners?

[29-Jun-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
not fair CPU make CPU mining ineffective

[29-Jun-18 10:56 AM] Cye#9860
VERUS Coin created a hashrate for CPU miners that could match GPU hashrate as far as I know

[29-Jun-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
nobody ever promised GPU miners a monopoly on mining KMD forever

[29-Jun-18 10:57 AM] jansako#3330
@jl777c  those are not good examples. Intel or Nvidia is not going to be running their hardware before it starts selling it (I don't know if Bitmain does or does not). Still think a clear and concise statement from the KMD team would go a long way.  Just to address the 'why'.

[29-Jun-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
bitmain is selling ASICS to basically anybody

[29-Jun-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
there is also a second ASIC miner for sale

[29-Jun-18 10:58 AM] jansako#3330
sure they do, I got one too

[29-Jun-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
there does not seem to be a valid centralization argument

[29-Jun-18 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
nvidia + amd are 2 vendors, not muc more decentralized than bitmain +1

[29-Jun-18 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
and shouldnt it be the other way?

[29-Jun-18 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
if an external product release forces a change of the consensus mechanism, it should be explained why

[29-Jun-18 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
not changing consensus due to an external product being released shouldnt need an explanation

[29-Jun-18 11:00 AM] jansako#3330
there I disagree. This is about communication, not tech at this point

[29-Jun-18 11:00 AM] Cye#9860
For me Bitmain ASIC Miners are a plague of networks. I'm reluctant to mine a coin that supports them. I had thought Komodo was ASIC resistant so I switched from Zcash to Komodo. I might have to switch again now. It's just my own personal belief that supporting Centralised Bitmain ASIC miners is very negative for the network and community as a whole and the networks will suffer once Bitmain takes over, which they mostly control already. The writing is on the wall. I just don't want to support Bitmain growing any stronger.

[29-Jun-18 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD was not marketed as a GPU get mining monopoly coin

[29-Jun-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
notary nodes mine 75% of blocks for KMD

[29-Jun-18 11:01 AM] jansako#3330
also just to save you time you spend rehashing the same argument

[29-Jun-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
even if bitmain controlled 100% of mining it would e 25%

[29-Jun-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
people will still complain

[29-Jun-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
they dont seem to care about the reasons

[29-Jun-18 11:02 AM] jansako#3330
yes, and we can point them to the article.

[29-Jun-18 11:03 AM] Cye#9860
I understand your points...I'm not arguing...I'm just saying what I feel and that I think Bitmain's attack will eventually be understood in future. I will rather seek out projects that defend against Bitmain

[29-Jun-18 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
do you understand that GPU are mining only 25% of KMD blocks?

[29-Jun-18 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
how will bitmain attack KMD with 25% of hashrate

[29-Jun-18 11:05 AM] Cye#9860
Well if ASIC miners were killed off GPU/CPU miners would be 100% of blocks

[29-Jun-18 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
NO

[29-Jun-18 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
in KMD notary nodes get 75% of blocks regardless of CPU, CPU or ASIC mining

[29-Jun-18 11:06 AM] Cye#9860
How are notary nodes operated/hardware?

[29-Jun-18 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
special nodes, annually elected, CPU mining

[29-Jun-18 11:07 AM] Cye#9860
:)

[29-Jun-18 11:07 AM] Cye#9860
100%

[29-Jun-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is ASIC resistant, doesnt matter the hashrate, notaries get 75% of blocks, maybe over the years it will be reduced to 50% of blocks but that would be a gradual process

[29-Jun-18 11:10 AM] Cye#9860
So in regards to KMD, are you saying that KMD currently supports ASIC miners on network?

[29-Jun-18 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is ASIC resistant in a way that still allows ASIC mining

[29-Jun-18 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
how can you prevent an ASIC miner?

[29-Jun-18 11:10 AM] Cye#9860
Monero

[29-Jun-18 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
for how long? so hardfork each time an ASIC comes out?

[29-Jun-18 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
seems a losing battle

[29-Jun-18 11:11 AM] Cye#9860
Until a better solution is found

[29-Jun-18 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
but ASIC will alwasy be possible to be made

[29-Jun-18 11:12 AM] Cye#9860
At least they fight the good fight. They understand the danger of Bitmain

[29-Jun-18 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
dif you forget that all miners combined get 25% of blocks, how will bitmain overcome that?

[29-Jun-18 11:15 AM] Cye#9860
For me it's more about ethics, and Bitmain is my enemy. So I'm finding it upsetting that more and more of my favourite projects are allowing their networks to be infected by the Bitmain corruption

[29-Jun-18 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
so because  KMD wont hardfork over a non-threat, we have bad ethics?

[29-Jun-18 11:16 AM] Cye#9860
Can't be decentralised when Centralised Bitmain control mining network

[29-Jun-18 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
25% is not control last time I checked

[29-Jun-18 11:21 AM] Cye#9860
Well if KMD is ASIC resistant and it allows ASIC miners, then yes, no ethics. But if you say that KMD was never intended to be ASIC resistant then you have ethics and carry on.
In regards to Zcash they stated ASIC resistant but then backstepped and now allow ASIC miners, so that's cowardice and shows no ethics, which is why is stopped mining/supporting Zcash. 
I had thought KMD was ASIC resistant, but maybe I'm wrong. If your allowing ASIC miners then you obviously support Bitmain and I will find a new project I can mine with a good conscience

[29-Jun-18 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
i support miners who bring the highest hashrate to KMD

[29-Jun-18 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
to increase its security

[29-Jun-18 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe nvidia will make an ASIC one day

[29-Jun-18 11:22 AM] Cye#9860
If you control 25%/all of the network it's only a matter of time they control KMD coins/markets/prices etc etc...It's a losing battle....better to kill Bitmain when you have a chance

[29-Jun-18 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
you are wrong again

[29-Jun-18 11:23 AM] Alright#0419
You realize you can buy one, right? üòÖ

[29-Jun-18 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
the 5% rewards are far more than all mining combined

[29-Jun-18 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
also who are we to target any specific company and try to take them out?

[29-Jun-18 11:24 AM] Cye#9860
How do you get a notary node?

[29-Jun-18 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
that is not anything any coin should be aiming to do

[29-Jun-18 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
convince about 2% of KMD stake to elect you to notary position in next year's election

[29-Jun-18 11:25 AM] Cye#9860
There you go, Bitmain just buy Notary Nodes. Money corrupts all. It's only a matter of time.

[29-Jun-18 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
You act as if anyone who buys a z9 mini is solely controlled by bitmain

[29-Jun-18 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
Alright - Today at 7:23 AM
You realize you can buy one, right? üòÖ

[29-Jun-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
if he buys one, he becomes part of bitmain

[29-Jun-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it is like the borg

[29-Jun-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
they will eat the universe

[29-Jun-18 11:30 AM] Cye#9860
I understand what you are saying, I'm just looking to the future and see the results of Bitmain's infection. 
But you are right, if I don't agree with a projects support of ASIC miners there are literally thousands of other projects to support. So I guess it comes down to personal opinion and beliefs what you think is the right project to support.

[29-Jun-18 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. if you are invested in GPU and have no ASIC, then the thing to do is GPU mine coins that can be profitably GPU mined. nobody is forcing you to lose money, but plz dont try to force us to hardfork over your econimic investmetns

[29-Jun-18 11:31 AM] Cye#9860
The "Borg" is a very accurate interpretation of the Bitmain infection :)

[29-Jun-18 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i was joking about the borg, the tech to mind control purchasers of ASIC  is still 13 years from being perfected

[29-Jun-18 11:32 AM] Cye#9860
I wouldn't force anyone to do anything

[29-Jun-18 11:33 AM] Alright#0419
Could I ask why you don't just buy some z9 minis?

[29-Jun-18 11:35 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
How many notaries are there on kmd?

[29-Jun-18 11:35 AM] OsTa#2589

Ok thanks for the chat, I know you are busy, I will consider your points and decide what to do with my miners hashrate next.
I've owned Bitmain miners in 2016, but when I realised what they were doing I sold them off and switched back to GPU/CPU miners

[29-Jun-18 11:36 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
64 people representing 75% of kmd's rewards by finding blocks???

[29-Jun-18 11:36 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Thats one of the most centralised coins then

[29-Jun-18 11:37 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Fiewww..

[29-Jun-18 11:37 AM] OsTa#2589
they are not earning so much as you can think

[29-Jun-18 11:37 AM] OsTa#2589
first you need technical skill

[29-Jun-18 11:37 AM] OsTa#2589
you need to be available 24h/7j
