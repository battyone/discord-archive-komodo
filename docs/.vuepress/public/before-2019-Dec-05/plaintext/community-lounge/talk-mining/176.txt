availability and liquidity and tariffs and taxes, as well

[06-Sep-19 03:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
buying asics new is one game, but I don't like many parts of it, so I play the used game. I know it's not your game

[06-Sep-19 03:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
Tariffs are fucked now, too

[06-Sep-19 03:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
There are more, every day

[06-Sep-19 03:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
the US is actually at war with China, it just hasn't been called that yet

[06-Sep-19 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I get that, but if you go back to then it's even more oddball because the A9s were *higher* in price than the preorders for A9++

[06-Sep-19 03:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, because you can get those delivered months before the A9++

[06-Sep-19 03:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
which many people were promised to be delivered months ago

[06-Sep-19 03:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
prices are extremely geographically sensitive, as well

[06-Sep-19 03:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
and if you are willing to order from shady sites in languages you don't speak and wait for shipping from china, you might get some deals

[06-Sep-19 03:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
A9's are flooding the market on the cheap right now, because A9++'s are actually being delivered

[06-Sep-19 03:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i agree that at large scale, buying new is best. I am playing the "small farmer" game

[06-Sep-19 03:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
And so I play the used game.

[06-Sep-19 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and if you are willing to order from shady sites in languages you don't speak and wait for shipping from china, you might get some deals`
Someone turned me on to a supplier that they use and I never did order because there were 3 different prices on the listing and one of them was a range of prices

[06-Sep-19 03:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
Buying new requires a lot of timing and luck and money. Used game is more forgiving of those, in my experience

[06-Sep-19 03:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 yeah, similar experiences here

[06-Sep-19 03:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was like "Just tell me how much this shit is going to cost 😕 "

[06-Sep-19 03:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
and then "surprise tariffs" happen

[06-Sep-19 03:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you have a merit badge for that 😉

[06-Sep-19 03:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
That shit scared me

[06-Sep-19 03:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm still fighting with FedEx over tariff billings from Nov

[06-Sep-19 03:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
I was only charged $700 in tariffs and it soured me extensively

[06-Sep-19 03:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
> You declared you were both the importer and your own broker for the import, fek off

[06-Sep-19 03:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
heh, 700 was less than I **did** pay and they want $9k more

[06-Sep-19 04:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
yup, they only charged me a tariff on one rig  they biffed charging me for the other one I bought new. I went used after that

[06-Sep-19 04:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
CBP decided that Bitmain used the wrong code and then rebilled FedEx for a shit ton more

[06-Sep-19 04:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
that shit is egregious

[06-Sep-19 04:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
⏰  If anybody can find 3900X's at your local electronics store, I am interested to buy them potentially. DM me ⏰

[06-Sep-19 04:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
Or you can scalp them on amz/ebay 😉

@jl777c  I'm going to start working on refining and verifying a simplified version of RST. Is there any problem that you see or something you want me to look into?

[09-Sep-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont think the testers found any significant issues

[09-Sep-19 01:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I thought gpu mining was a thing of the past 😄

[09-Sep-19 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
never

[09-Sep-19 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
GPU mining is speculative now. You don't grind on the mid-cap coins anymore

[09-Sep-19 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
GPUs rawk for assetchains 😉

Now I play the game "where the fuck do I have any amperage left for this new miner?"

[09-Sep-19 01:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 very nice

[09-Sep-19 01:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
I need 240v like yesterday

[09-Sep-19 01:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Now I play the game "where the fuck do I have any amperage left for this new miner?"`
When I got there, I just made the electric co put in a new transformer 😛

[09-Sep-19 01:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
not there yet, but one day. I just need my breakers/etc to be used more efficiently

[09-Sep-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
240v is standard here lol...

[09-Sep-19 01:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r yeah we like to do dumb shit in the US

[09-Sep-19 01:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have 200A in one location and 150A in other, just need it on correctly-sized 240v breakers and I got plenty of room to scale

[09-Sep-19 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my power is 260v... I had to hack solar inverter to higher voltage or it wopuld kep shutting down when  it was a sunny day

[09-Sep-19 01:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
less people die from "110" here
people in the US tend to be too dumb to turn it off before sticking their fingers in it 🤷🏽

[09-Sep-19 01:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r sounds about right for your life 👼

[09-Sep-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
town makes too much power from solar with lots of sun

[09-Sep-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and the law is 250v

[09-Sep-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but... 260 is what works

[09-Sep-19 01:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
VOLTAGE IS LAW

Don't fuck with it.

[09-Sep-19 01:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
Also, I don't know what I am doing and will be installing 240v breakers with 10 gauge wire

[09-Sep-19 01:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
tbh here even 400V is standard available in most households

[09-Sep-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
someone got me to install some lights a ffew weeks ago, wires didnt reach and it didnt fit, so IU joined all red wire to extend it... so dangerous... works tho

[09-Sep-19 01:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and somehting like 40A

[09-Sep-19 01:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
could ask for 63A as it is available in my street, but no need and have to pay extra fees 😦

[09-Sep-19 01:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`with 10 gauge wire`
Use 8, it's more fun to try to work with :troll:

[09-Sep-19 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Cryptoon not sure what you talkin' bout

[09-Sep-19 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326

[09-Sep-19 01:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I had some 8 laying around when I put in my 1st S7
getting that wire to bend into the outlet box was one of the least bits of fun I've ever had since I started mining

[09-Sep-19 01:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 is doing really annoying/dangerous electrical work the dividing line between hobbyist miners and pro miners?

[09-Sep-19 01:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, I knew fekall back then

[09-Sep-19 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I just knew that 220 was less on the bill than 110

[09-Sep-19 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you dont do your own electrical work... how do you know it is safe ?

[09-Sep-19 01:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@dukeleto you were saying that you need 240, but only have 110 available, blackjoker said 240 is standard, I said even 400V is standard where I live with up to 63A per household...

[09-Sep-19 01:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
