a lot of < 60 second blocks...

[08-Aug-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
this is what i usually see

[08-Aug-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
which seems to mean the equilibrium diff is still higher

[08-Aug-19 05:32 PM] zawy#5864
17,13,22 is just  below the triger

[08-Aug-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
and there is chance of triggering another RST if the miners get lucky

[08-Aug-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why i say it feels that the digishield needed to be boosted

[08-Aug-19 05:33 PM] zawy#5864
remeber if digishild is issuing blocks too fast, first try reducing target to 0.693 of ctA

[08-Aug-19 05:34 PM] zawy#5864
(post RST)

[08-Aug-19 05:34 PM] zawy#5864
I mean 0.693 of the ctA values that are RST

[08-Aug-19 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is hard to say, it could be within statistical deviations

[08-Aug-19 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
the diff seems to be staying around 95

[08-Aug-19 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
and it transitioned at 92, so if 95 is the equilibrium rate, then it seems we are ok

[08-Aug-19 05:35 PM] zawy#5864
yes, if D is stable with digi in a post- RST, then it seems everything is perfect

[08-Aug-19 05:35 PM] zawy#5864
is that what you're testing now?

[08-Aug-19 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[08-Aug-19 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
17 blocks and diff is stable

[08-Aug-19 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
well 90 to 97

[08-Aug-19 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
stablish

[08-Aug-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
now 102

[08-Aug-19 05:36 PM] zawy#5864
wow.  if that's consistent another factor I came across in theory was 0.88

[08-Aug-19 05:36 PM] zawy#5864
90/0.88 = 102

[08-Aug-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
92 / 0.88 = 104

[08-Aug-19 05:36 PM] SHossain#0007
21 blocks with second hash 0

[08-Aug-19 05:36 PM] SHossain#0007
till now

[08-Aug-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, lets wait for the hashrate to stop increasing

[08-Aug-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
it definitely seems to be increasing

[08-Aug-19 05:38 PM] zawy#5864
90 / 0.693 = 130

[08-Aug-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems it is 0.88 or 1

[08-Aug-19 05:38 PM] zawy#5864
About 130 would ocincide with my original guess as to what the ctA adjustment shuold be.  I first said 1/2, but was really thinking 0.693

[08-Aug-19 05:39 PM] zawy#5864
but them later math said 0.88

[08-Aug-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt seem it will go to 130

[08-Aug-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so for post-RST put in to digishield (ctA/8) * 7 ?

[08-Aug-19 05:40 PM] zawy#5864
if several tests confirm it

[08-Aug-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it was too fast, RST triggered

[08-Aug-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
this is like the 6th test where the digishield diff was too low

[08-Aug-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
never higher

[08-Aug-19 05:41 PM] zawy#5864
RST triggering is supposed to be 1/200 blocks if hashrate is stable

[08-Aug-19 05:41 PM] zawy#5864
for W=3, 6, 12 if you did not change outer equation

[08-Aug-19 05:41 PM] zawy#5864
even used together, just 1 per 200

[08-Aug-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
unless digishield diff values are too low and it makes it 1/20

[08-Aug-19 05:42 PM] zawy#5864
that's right, if digi needs that 7/8 then chances are increased some

[08-Aug-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
i will add the 7/8 factor

diff down to 120

[08-Aug-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
once RST kicks in the diff will bounce around a lot

[08-Aug-19 05:45 PM] zawy#5864
1 per 100 if 7/8 is missing

[08-Aug-19 05:45 PM] SHossain#0007
shall i start with 3 thread (1x)

[08-Aug-19 05:45 PM] zawy#5864
is HR nkown to be stable?  How often are the triggers with stable HR?

[08-Aug-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
no, we found an issue. will need to do ZAWY21

[08-Aug-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
after digishield goes stable, i dont see RST trigger much at all, actually i dont think it has yet, but not many 200 block stretches.

[08-Aug-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
is that every 200 blocks has a 50% chance?

[08-Aug-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
or each block has a 0,5% chance?

[08-Aug-19 05:47 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. shall i stop this test and wait for your fix?

[08-Aug-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
no.

[08-Aug-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it is almost caught up

[08-Aug-19 05:47 PM] SHossain#0007
cool. it's continuing with 30

[08-Aug-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so we can see another transition into digishield

[08-Aug-19 05:48 PM] SHossain#0007

[08-Aug-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
at 92 again

[08-Aug-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
last time was 91.8

[08-Aug-19 05:49 PM] SHossain#0007
81.7

[08-Aug-19 05:49 PM] zawy#5864
0.5 % per block

[08-Aug-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so a 40% chance it can happen in 100 blocks

[08-Aug-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
64% chance it happens in 200 blocks

[08-Aug-19 05:50 PM] zawy#5864
If you are saying my statistics thinking has an error then I need to tell you that the precise thing I am saying is that it is 1.5% per 3 blocks

[08-Aug-19 05:51 PM] zawy#5864
I was just thinking that means a 50% chance in 200 blocks. Am I wrong?

[08-Aug-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
.995 ^ N

[08-Aug-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
or .985 ^ (N/3)

[08-Aug-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
both are very close at 100 and 200

[08-Aug-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
and that is the probability that no RST is triggered for N blocks

[08-Aug-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
about 140 blocks is the 50% probability

[08-Aug-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but this will get a lot of variance

[08-Aug-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
still chance of happening within 25 blocks is only 12%, and it happened twice already

[08-Aug-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain code is updated for ZAWY21

[08-Aug-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
do the exact same thing, we need to get a clean transition and hopefully have the digishield start with a diff of 100 instead of 90

[08-Aug-19 05:56 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. stopping ZAWY20 and updating

[08-Aug-19 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
