Then mining is probably not for you.

Damn.. if all the z9 mini are going to target kmd... diff would just explode and render even the z9 useless.. right?

[27-Jun-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
not useless, just not free money after 3 months like it is now

I know.. with my elec cost im at a crossroad on what to do.
Mining ethereum for example would return me just 16$ day and after elec cost im left with just 1.5$ a day.. almost breakeven...

[27-Jun-18 03:42 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Think to turn them off..

[27-Jun-18 03:43 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Or just run few gpu on kmd .. like 1 kmd a day and pay elec from pocket.

[27-Jun-18 03:43 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
With kmd im even mining at a loss ..

[27-Jun-18 03:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
my rigs earn plenty, but by the time you figure man hours of 20 hr days....

[27-Jun-18 03:44 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
man hours?

[27-Jun-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you do it properly... its a crazy amount of work... just like a notary node..

[27-Jun-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You can turn it on and do nothing, but your node will suck.

Otherwise i have to try out ALL coins...

[27-Jun-18 03:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
a full mining setup  is selling what it's mining on (but only selling what it can theoretically mine in that switch period) and looks at enough math to annoy Einstein

Is it possible to mine komodo with asic machines for now? And will they fork any news?

[27-Jun-18 06:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes, and there will be no retarded fork

[27-Jun-18 08:53 PM] Runaque#8905
@ComputerGenie Serious? No fork for avoiding ASIC mining? If that's the case, I'm pulling the plug out of my mining rig.

[27-Jun-18 08:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Runaque Every one of those forks relies on the misguided notion that RAM is expensive and that's a deterrent for making an ASIC with more RAM. That's, literally, the only added "resistance".

[27-Jun-18 08:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
144,5 forks are driven by nothing more than GPU owners that hate Bitmain
Komodo is driven by creating better tech and doesn't need such silliness

[27-Jun-18 09:01 PM] Runaque#8905
Sounds more like big mining farms taking decentralisation away IMO.

[27-Jun-18 09:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
sounds like you read too many reddit posts IMO

[27-Jun-18 09:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you can afford $850 for a GPU, then you can afford $850 for an ASIC

[27-Jun-18 09:04 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Hmm... what about all z9's in the world mining KMD.. it would leave ALL gpu miners biting the dust and out of business for kmd.. no gpu miners anymore

[27-Jun-18 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC has no CPU miners anymore either

[27-Jun-18 09:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and that's bad how? How many GPU miners does BTC have?

[27-Jun-18 09:04 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
True..
Maybe i should sell two 1070's üòÇ

[27-Jun-18 09:05 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
And get the z9

_is too slow typing_

[27-Jun-18 09:05 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
BTC is close to be 51% on bitmain

[27-Jun-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
in any case it is only 25% of mining in play and mining is less than 25% of the 5% rewards

[27-Jun-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
plus KMD has dPoW

[27-Jun-18 09:06 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Sooo.. im selling two 1070's and dedicate it to KMD.. good idea?

[27-Jun-18 09:07 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
To buy a z9

[27-Jun-18 09:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The whole "big miners centralize" claim is null because tech advances should never be limited by the dreams of the economically "disenfranchised", simply because they can't afford it on a burger flipper's wage

[27-Jun-18 09:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
that combined with the reality that the guy with a 1050 cannot compete with "centralized" farms like mine with racks of 1080TIs

[27-Jun-18 09:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
144,5 is all about letting poor people dream of lambos, hookers, and blow when they can't afford a Pinto

[27-Jun-18 09:10 PM] jl777c#5810
how is it unfair?

[27-Jun-18 09:10 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems bitmain is selling z9 to anybody

[27-Jun-18 09:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"unfair"? I was homeless 6 years ago; now I have more high-end GPUs than I know what to do with

Maybe you right guys.. i feel disadvantaged by my countries high electricity rate and high tax rates..

[27-Jun-18 09:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
then you should get into the trading side and not the side you can't afford; there's more to crypto than just mining

[27-Jun-18 09:13 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Trading = 33% taxed on gains..

[27-Jun-18 09:14 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
But better than mining indeed

[27-Jun-18 09:14 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Not saying that I don't feel for you, just saying that tech shouldn't be limited to what you can afford (nor should larger farms not exist because I can't afford what they can)

[27-Jun-18 09:15 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
A z9 with 10k sol at just 300watt would be a solution for my high electricity rate üòÇ

exactly, not only are ASICs competitively priced compared to GPUs, they are exponentially more efficient and cost-effective

[27-Jun-18 09:32 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Ok.. done .. put two 1070's for sale.. 300‚Ç¨ each.. that would go fast no?

I stopped mining a while ago, even with free power I was losing money... if thats even possible.

Pretty sure z9 would be profitable though. I spent $5800 on solar panels to run rigs for "free" but they dont really work in winnter it seems. üò¶

[28-Jun-18 06:37 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Looks like I missed a pretty interesting discussion about mining here. @ComputerGenie I certainly get your stance, but I think the point you keep missing is that by allowing asics, and not trying to become asic resistant, you're effectively allowing for a large corporation to wipe out a union of smaller corporations and individuals both competitively and financially. A simple change to the equihash algo does indeed render most purpose built asics useless, and they'll continue to reshape and repurpose their hardware to create new versions, that's fine with their business model over at Bitmain, and doubly so if you believe they mine on the products before sales. This basically isolates and marginalizes your core adopters whom, admittedly, were well rewarded for doing so, but have grown attached.

I guess from a mining perspective, I don't see the benefit of becoming ASIC Tolerant. Perhaps I'm missing a big picture here, but is there any real benefit towards standing idle while ASICs run up the difficulty and nethash? I can certainly see the downsides of ASIC tolerance. By that decision alone, whether or not intended, KMD is deciding to not support those that have supported them, and will stand on the sidelines and do nothing while a big corporation comes in and makes their chain completely unable to be supported by GPU miners, therefore making it more centralized in practice because you'll have fewer miners carrying the weight.

[28-Jun-18 06:37 AM] Beetcoin#9049
.I guess a lot of people are just sitting back trying to figure out how ASICS could benefit KMD more GPU mining in a scenario where they have most of their support wiped out. Its not like you'll have miners mining at a loss just because they are fans, and in cases like mine, I'm holding KMD exceptionally long term because I find its potential to be the most promising, but I'll have to point my rig in a new direction here in a few days as profitability crashes in part to difficulty and market concerns. I think at the end of the day it just leaves a bad taste in everybody's mouth, even if they like the tech, its damaging to early adoption.

[28-Jun-18 07:22 AM] jansako#3330
I got my Z9 mini a few days ago. This thing was so clean there is no way it was run for any relevant length of time before shipping. They may run others before selling them, but not the one I got.
As Computergenie pointed out, the price of a 1080 Ti and a Z9 Mini are almost the same, so your point about a mega corp wiping out small miners is not valid. If you can afford one, you can afford the other.
Wiping out the current, existing GPU miners is  a different question. Money talks, as we say here, and miners do replace their hardware (they should anyway). If using ASIC will get more profitable, even the small miners will buy them, if GPU's are more profitable, miners will buy those too.

[28-Jun-18 07:24 AM] jansako#3330
I would even argue that a z9 significantly lowers the barrier of entry for a miner! I built my first GPU rig some months (yeah I know) ago for ~3600 USD. Again comp[are to the price of a z9...

[28-Jun-18 07:42 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Z9's launched at like $2k while the average 1080ti was around $850, you can't make the argument that they are the same price when they simply are not, and I've heard arguments for and against the Z9's  having been mined on with photos with an without dust, YMMV. The point is that you have a sketch company, one who not so privately goes out and attacks coins denouncing asics during the launches of their asic platforms by paying for nicehash users to 51% attack the network and/or drive up difficulty so high while failing a 51% attack ,miners are forced off the network for profitability's sake.

[28-Jun-18 07:43 AM] Beetcoin#9049
And again, its not about the profitability or efficiency of a Z9, its the miners that were there supporting the network prior to the Z9, and whether KMD NEEEDED to support asics or not

[28-Jun-18 07:44 AM] Beetcoin#9049
There's more miners negatively affected by asics on the network than those positively affected by it, that's simply not a win for KMD at all

[28-Jun-18 07:45 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Like I was trying to state, the point is rather about PR and how it looks, rather than the efficiencies or profitability of the asic and miner htemselves.

[28-Jun-18 07:45 AM] Beetcoin#9049
KMD literally looks like they are dropping their "average" looking girlfriend who has been there for years, to date the hot model.

[28-Jun-18 07:45 AM] Beetcoin#9049
To put it to a crude analogy

[28-Jun-18 07:46 AM] Beetcoin#9049
And I say this, because I've seen nothing genuinely presenting itself as a positive for KMD by accepting ASIC Tolerance.

[28-Jun-18 07:46 AM] Beetcoin#9049
If there was one, show me the facts and allow me to digest them.

[28-Jun-18 07:49 AM] Beetcoin#9049
And again, the points I'm representing are merely the sentiment right now, not necessarily the facts. It seems like the image of KMD and the feelings of those formerly attached to it are merely being swept off the table with the asic tolerance movement, but left without any reason WHY KMD would allow for the support of asics. I think that's the real big question mark for most GPU miners.

[28-Jun-18 08:20 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Got told that mining is only 25% of the network.. so nu threat

[28-Jun-18 08:22 AM] Beetcoin#9049

[28-Jun-18 08:22 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
If all gpu miners got an z9 on the side... wouldnt it be same as before.. all small miners in the game..

[28-Jun-18 08:23 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Why would any miner buy a z9 without surety that the algorithm they intend to mine with would be there down the road?

[28-Jun-18 08:23 AM] Beetcoin#9049
That's the point of GPU mining

[28-Jun-18 08:23 AM] Beetcoin#9049
I can switch to ETH if I want, or XMR or whatever I want

[28-Jun-18 08:23 AM] Beetcoin#9049
You can't do that with an ASIC

[28-Jun-18 08:23 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Its a brick once the algo changes.
