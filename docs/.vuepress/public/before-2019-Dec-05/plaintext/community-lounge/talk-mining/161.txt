I've been wondering if I could replace the tipdiff in EMA with tipdiff * recent solve times like in the RST

[07-Aug-19 09:53 PM] jl777c#5810
using more info has to make it more stable

[07-Aug-19 09:53 PM] zawy#5864
.........based on if emission rate was behind

[07-Aug-19 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, two states, if behind min() the various bnTargets that are calculated, if ahead use max()

[07-Aug-19 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
the TSA is allowing many blocks <60 sec, it doesnt have to

[07-Aug-19 09:55 PM] zawy#5864
Do testing with EMA-TSA    (RST is a TSA)

[07-Aug-19 09:55 PM] jl777c#5810
but its output during the catchup is quite stable

[07-Aug-19 09:58 PM] zawy#5864
Your EMA will go from 1E6 to 1  in 25xT

[07-Aug-19 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
thats not bad, but not great

[07-Aug-19 09:59 PM] zawy#5864
what do you want it to be

[07-Aug-19 09:59 PM] jl777c#5810
like with the exp() results, 10 to 15 minutes for any level of diff stranding

[07-Aug-19 09:59 PM] zawy#5864
15x for 4E6?

[07-Aug-19 10:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, maybe it was a bit more for the first block

[07-Aug-19 10:00 PM] zawy#5864
what?

[07-Aug-19 10:00 PM] jl777c#5810
1st block after the diff stranding might take 20 min for 4E6, but then the second, third come much faster

[07-Aug-19 10:01 PM] zawy#5864
see after 1 block.......it's at the right level immediately...no looking back at previous blocks needed

[07-Aug-19 10:01 PM] zawy#5864
so is 25x  then 1x, 1x, 1x  OK for 4E6?

[07-Aug-19 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess it would be ok

[07-Aug-19 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
i still have implementation bugs

[07-Aug-19 10:02 PM] zawy#5864
That's what you have right now...you're finished

[07-Aug-19 10:02 PM] zawy#5864
oh, 4E6 instead of 1E6.....ok..let me see

[07-Aug-19 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
after solving 74 diff of 43.7 in 1 second, it lowered the diff to 17.5

[07-Aug-19 10:03 PM] zawy#5864
change 1/2 to  5/9

[07-Aug-19 10:04 PM] zawy#5864
lol, yeah, that's a bug

[07-Aug-19 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
something overflows

[07-Aug-19 10:05 PM] zawy#5864
yeah, that might be the same thing causing me problems

[07-Aug-19 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
found one possible problem. fixing

[07-Aug-19 10:06 PM] zawy#5864
I guess my notes are wrong and it went negative

[07-Aug-19 10:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i can make tipdiff always be 4 or more

[07-Aug-19 10:07 PM] zawy#5864
Here's the problem with 1 second:   (60 + (1-60) * 3^(1/60/2)) = 60-59.5

[07-Aug-19 10:07 PM] jl777c#5810
tipdiff was always 2 or more in that version

[07-Aug-19 10:08 PM] zawy#5864
oh right

[07-Aug-19 10:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i will change it to 3

[07-Aug-19 10:09 PM] zawy#5864
still 2/60 gives 60-59.03    =  1 so target was not supposed to be changed

[07-Aug-19 10:09 PM] jl777c#5810
is 3 safe from overflow?

[07-Aug-19 10:10 PM] zawy#5864
I don't know what you're having problems now....so I can't know under what conditions it is safe

[07-Aug-19 10:10 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean the equation with the -C

[07-Aug-19 10:10 PM] jl777c#5810
if tipdiff is always 3 or more, i hope to avoid negative stuff

[07-Aug-19 10:11 PM] zawy#5864
it's in the implementation of the exp()

[07-Aug-19 10:18 PM] zawy#5864
is tidiff = 3 going to result in 3/2 = 1?

[07-Aug-19 10:18 PM] zawy#5864
```zawy_exponential_val360000(tipdiff/2))```

[07-Aug-19 10:18 PM] zawy#5864
that causes substantial error

[07-Aug-19 10:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the calculated value isnt monotonically increasing

[07-Aug-19 10:19 PM] jl777c#5810
yes 3/2 -> 1

[07-Aug-19 10:19 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is 3*5/9 now, but that will also go to 1

[07-Aug-19 10:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so tipdiff needs to be even only?

[07-Aug-19 10:22 PM] zawy#5864
input to exp needs to be scaled up

[07-Aug-19 10:23 PM] jl777c#5810
i can just force tipdiff to increment by 2

[07-Aug-19 10:24 PM] jl777c#5810
instead of by 1

[07-Aug-19 10:24 PM] zawy#5864
whch means it needs careful scaling down in 2 places inside of it....but this is not a source of negatives, just a loss in precision response.....i think avg solvetime will be a little slower

[07-Aug-19 10:24 PM] zawy#5864
beig accurate on those small times is needed for the largest attacks

[07-Aug-19 10:25 PM] jl777c#5810
will 1 second matter so much?

[07-Aug-19 10:26 PM] jl777c#5810
seems it will double diff each block under max hash attack

[07-Aug-19 10:26 PM] jl777c#5810
working much better with the fix to avoid tipdiff of 2

[07-Aug-19 10:28 PM] zawy#5864
OK, I'll talk to you tomorrow

[07-Aug-19 10:28 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[07-Aug-19 10:51 PM] zawy#5864
The key is tipdiff....I've chosen LWMA over EMA in nomrla DAs for  slightly good reasons.  LWMA with low N  will probably drop better than EMA with a better stability and keep correct solvetime.

[07-Aug-19 10:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the TSA is really cool though, it basically adjusts diff in 1 block, during the block

[07-Aug-19 10:53 PM] jl777c#5810
the diff does bounce around due to miners luck, but i guess as long as average blocktime ends up at T, its fine

[07-Aug-19 10:54 PM] jl777c#5810
a lot of the variance could be due to low number of miners, will be interesting to see the ASIC tests on it tomorrow

[08-Aug-19 12:31 AM] zawy#5864
The exp mod portion might need expanding for better accuracy.  The variance is inherent to the speed.  Same as RST. I am curious if it will automatically keep correct avg solvetime.    KMD is a big coin that needs to be reliable.  It seems you have to use this EMA-TSA.  If stable difficulty is important, it has to do an RST-type trigger and response.  That is, it needs a 1/40 in place of the 1/2. But even with 1/40 it's not a pretty stability like digishield.

[08-Aug-19 01:03 AM] zawy#5864
If stability is key, and so is super-fast response to > 1000x then RST + digishield + ema is needed

[08-Aug-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
RST is working so well, i have no words to describe it. i enabled the 6 and 12 and now they basically get the chain back to T per block since the O trigger, four times in a row, like clockwork, even as the miner luck sometimes solves at implied hashrate of 3000 diff and other times at 10, a 30x range seems normal

[08-Aug-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
the only problem so far is that the TSA EMA is pushing the digishield diff lower, so i just made it so we can tell if TSA is active and adjust the digishield by the 2.7 factor (i round to 3)

[08-Aug-19 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
also in order to link the TSA into digishield, i use the average of the digishield target and ct[0], otherwise it just seemed that the digishield is ignored

[08-Aug-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the TSA only activates if neither the RST or the exp() triggers, but in normal circumstance it should be the one adjusting, so that should take care of the increase and decrease in the non-extreme scenarios, with the RST and exp() taking care of the extreme cases

[08-Aug-19 10:26 AM] zawy#5864
EMA does not need the 2.7

[08-Aug-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
i removed all my tinkering with the various internals, with the exception that if RST is enabled, it will always make it at least 10% harder, otherwise it looks like it went dormant

[08-Aug-19 10:26 AM] zawy#5864
to be applied to digi

[08-Aug-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
experimentally it seems to need something

[08-Aug-19 10:27 AM] zawy#5864
Yes, maybe a 10%

[08-Aug-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
4 times in a row, all is beautiful during RST, it gets things to normal, TSA kicks in and lowers diff

[08-Aug-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
which then makes things unstable as we get fast blocktimes, then much higher diff, slow times, lower diff, etc

[08-Aug-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
and the diff seemed to go to 30 vs 90

[08-Aug-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i am linking the TSA with digishield by setting prevTarget to (prevTarget + digishield bnTarget) / 2

[08-Aug-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
that probably messes up the calibration. so maybe it is a 2x adjustment

[08-Aug-19 10:30 AM] zawy#5864
There's a big problem if avg solvetime is not correct with just digi and EMA running by them selves.

[08-Aug-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
how to combine them?

[08-Aug-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
right now digishield would be disabled unless i feed into the TSA the bnTarget

[08-Aug-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe i average the output of TSA using prevTarget and the digishield bnTarget?

[08-Aug-19 10:33 AM] zawy#5864
Oh, wait, I am thinking of my TSA  where EMA rides on top of digishield....my TSA only uses the digi output to adjust, and digi never uses the the EMA output as it's difficulty

[08-Aug-19 10:35 AM] zawy#5864
But that method was only to make a really good avg solvetime with less variaion than you are seeing

[08-Aug-19 10:35 AM] zawy#5864
Your need is to address the top and bottom and leave the middle alone

[08-Aug-19 10:36 AM] zawy#5864
So you activate EMA like RST and exp to replace them

[08-Aug-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought of triggering the TSA only after 2*T, but couldnt figure out when it should trigger on the min side, maybe between T/2 and T?

[08-Aug-19 10:36 AM] zawy#5864
And I think there should not be any need to adjust targets....digi just ueses its output

[08-Aug-19 10:37 AM] zawy#5864
Trigger is same as RST

[08-Aug-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i found whenever the miners are working for significant time on targets different from what they actually solve, the digishield target calcs need to be adjusted

[08-Aug-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont want to replace RST, RST is working the best

[08-Aug-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
and exp() is proven, so just when neither of those are active

[08-Aug-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
just need a way to calibrate the TSA and digishield and how to run them together

[08-Aug-19 10:39 AM] zawy#5864
Yeah, if 1E6 attacks, it seems like it should have the correct difficulty in 6 blocks and recovered the lost 4 blocks in by the 10 th block.

[08-Aug-19 10:39 AM] zawy#5864
I have an idea for that 4

[08-Aug-19 10:40 AM] zawy#5864
adjust the 4 based on how many blocks behind you are

[08-Aug-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
that should speed up digishield converging when we have the 2x to 4x cases that avoids triggering RST and exp()

[08-Aug-19 10:40 AM] zawy#5864
or maybe just 4 to get it out of RST more quickly......
