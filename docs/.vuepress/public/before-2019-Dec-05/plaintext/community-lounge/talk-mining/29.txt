I was testing them on some Komodo chains.  Pretty sure I forked a few, or is no mining occurring on them?  Thoughts?

[28-Jul-18 12:54 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
that depends on the coin

[28-Jul-18 02:06 AM] Alright#0419
@FishyGuts you can also split the hash rate of the card by opening multiple instances of the mining program

[28-Jul-18 02:06 AM] Alright#0419
and it's likely no one is mining them

[28-Jul-18 02:06 AM] Alright#0419
pretty much all of the have on-demand blocks

[28-Jul-18 02:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So i have a bunch of 1050s and Im just attempting to split them across coins.   Seems I can do it with individual instances of each miner.bat

[28-Jul-18 02:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Up to 10 instances

[28-Jul-18 02:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
After that the miner program wont open any more.

[28-Jul-18 02:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
But the 10 will stay on.   Now they dont appear to be submitting shares but the difficulty is changing.

[28-Jul-18 02:08 AM] Alright#0419
you're using your own pools or robes'?

[28-Jul-18 02:08 AM] FishyGuts#5085
By using --dev 0,1,2 I can run an instance with just those GPUs.

[28-Jul-18 02:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I was testing on robes

[28-Jul-18 02:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
it just required a gpu# and port change

[28-Jul-18 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
and if you open less than 10, do they start mining?

[28-Jul-18 02:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
they mine up to 10

[28-Jul-18 02:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
and 11 and 12 wont stay open but 1-10 will

[28-Jul-18 02:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I can mine 10 diff coins on one rig  if I wanted to.

[28-Jul-18 02:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Maybe that's common but Im learning 😃

[28-Jul-18 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
you can do multiple miner instances for a single GPU, that's all I was saying

[28-Jul-18 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
just something most people might not immediately realize

[28-Jul-18 02:27 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I see what you're saying.   Beacuse it wouldn't matter if hashrate wasn't my concern.

[28-Jul-18 07:14 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
gpu doesnt make a dent realy in mining equihash.
the z9 is king now.
A 1070 rig has a hashrate of 2600sol for 720watt and cost you 3500$
A z9 mini has a hashrate of 10 to 16k sol for 350watt and cost you 850$

it should be a no brainer to sell the 1070 rig and buy z9’s for it

[28-Jul-18 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
depends on what price you can get for the rig... My rig is ~1800w and only 2Ksol 🤣 Was looking into some minis, but the noise put me off.

[28-Jul-18 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This rig can easily mine AC's though as nobody is mining them, but its not exactly profitable with such a low block reward.

[28-Jul-18 07:31 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
my elec rate is high .. 0.3$
so 350watt for +10ksol is profitable for me.. niw my 1070 rig mines at break even

[28-Jul-18 07:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and you cant use the gpu rig to mine ethereum or something?

[28-Jul-18 07:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or rent it out on nicehash?

[28-Jul-18 08:04 AM] jansako#3330
I am trying to sell my 1070 rig, but the prices went to shite and nobody is buying... so might as well keep it on AC's. Not worth doing though, unless you can eat the electricity cost until there is any liquidity on AC's. I think I sold like 2 KMD worth in the last month...

Good stuff about being able to run 2 miners per GPU, did not know that!

[28-Jul-18 09:17 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@[TPUX] Djith Wattignies My GPU rigs disagree with you, as does the 10 Komodo blocks they found yesterday

[28-Jul-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
hashrate overall seems about the same as from before the ASIC came out

[28-Jul-18 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@jansako with the next gen coming in a few months, I can't see too many people looking to buy a 2 year old model that isn't "top end" (i.e., 1080 or above)

[28-Jul-18 01:37 PM] jansako#3330
I agree, that was not a complaint, just a statement of fact. Should have sold it for +20% right after I built it, 6 months ago 😃

[28-Jul-18 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm lost as to why you would have built anything with less than a 1080Ti 6 months ago 😕

[28-Jul-18 02:53 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
@ComputerGenie try with 1 rig .. then come back

[28-Jul-18 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@[TPUX] Djith Wattignies I only have 2 running on KMD (1@13 GPUs & 1@10GPUs)

[28-Jul-18 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
so 1 would be ~7 blocks instead of 10?

[28-Jul-18 02:55 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
solo mining kmd??

[28-Jul-18 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yup

[28-Jul-18 02:55 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
hmm.. so you say it is better than pool mining?

[28-Jul-18 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I say that not giving someone else what you should earn is better than giving someone else what you earn

[28-Jul-18 02:57 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
wich pool you mine kmd on?

[28-Jul-18 03:00 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
1080ti 6 months ago were like a 1000€ each
have build my rigs 14 months ago.. 1060 and 1070

[28-Jul-18 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`1080ti 6 months ago were like a 1000€ each`
And KMD was trading @ $12-14 😉

Answer

[28-Jul-18 07:11 PM] jansako#3330
Was the very first multi-card rig I built. Figured it would hurt less if I melt a 3k rig than a 7k rig 😃 . That was right after I just fried the GPU in my desktop...

[28-Jul-18 10:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Sounds like you figured wrong 😛 :trollface:

[29-Jul-18 03:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems quite a few of the Assets have GPUs on them now... My Notary Node automatically filters out chains with more than 200 difficulty, and it no onger mining ZILLA or EQL and the usual suspects SUPERNET/DEX etc...

[29-Jul-18 04:14 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r @jansako GPU mines a couple of them

[29-Jul-18 04:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
VRSC just halved it's block reward, and blocks are unlocked now. But no pools have come forward yet that support it.

[29-Jul-18 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Well if I mine VRSC now and get the same results I got before, what is 1/2 of nothing?

[29-Jul-18 12:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362

In a moth or so, it will filter out all of them 😛

[29-Jul-18 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems like the mining nodes keep crashing on me anyway, ut that might be a failing HDD.

[29-Jul-18 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, I'm on track to have my chain switching stratum done right around the time Batch 2 of the minis ship

going to attempt to manually copy the VM to SSD and try mining there to see if its software of hardware problem. happening lots now,

[29-Jul-18 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I moved mine to SSD twice, once worked perfect and the other was a complete fail (but both times was moving from file to using SSD as physical disk, not just moving *to* SSD location)

[29-Jul-18 12:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
coincidentally, I finally stopped being a moron and installed vmware on my server this morning

[29-Jul-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Vmware was great when I have vCerntre.... so freeking easy

[29-Jul-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but the trial ran out...

[29-Jul-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Shouldn't be too hard to just move all the files.. I think its a little more involved than that though from memory. Notary may be down a while, and missed the freefor all by 1H 😦

[29-Jul-18 12:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
lol my f4a luck always sucks, I got 1 block out of the last one

[29-Jul-18 12:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
on average, my block finds don't care if it's f4a or "normal", I get about the same either way

[29-Jul-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
some moron plays it.... no blocks for 30-45mins then 60 blocks in minutes

[29-Jul-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it will be gone soon though 😄

[29-Jul-18 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
playing the long game, a rental is worth scooping the f4a, but I got tired of keeping track

[29-Jul-18 01:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
isn't @polycryptoblog setting up a huge mining operation?

[29-Jul-18 01:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
been keeping half an eye on #komodobusinesssolutions but still not really clear what it is they are doing 😄

[29-Jul-18 05:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@jl777c is it safe to update mining node to dev branch?

[29-Jul-18 05:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

notaries mine on dev

[29-Jul-18 05:19 PM] bishop#9773
My mining node is running dev

[29-Jul-18 05:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@blackjok3r `Today at 12:14 PM
notaries mine on dev`
That's kind of a relative statement given recent updates/changes
NNx mining on dev compiled 4 days ago isn't the same as someone trying to mine on **today's** dev

[29-Jul-18 05:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am pretty sure I compiled todays dev on mine and have mined a few blocks

@Cryptoon   Small/medium size commercial operation .   The idea if if everything works out legally is to have a B2B barter exchange where mined coin can act as a clearing mechanism for outstanding credit.

[29-Jul-18 05:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Small/medium" is a relative term :p

[29-Jul-18 05:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
125-250 kwh to start.  A bit more than a house but still pretty small.

[29-Jul-18 05:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yeah, that *is* "small", my sha ASICs burn about 5x that a day

[29-Jul-18 06:05 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
90% of my kWh is going to equihash.   Though have been bouncing back and forth on picking up a bunch of sha asics just to get power bill higher ( a lot better rate) .    I just have a feeling though there is going to be a 25-35 TH for ~1500w soon, given by bitmain prices and network hashrate.  Haven't pulled the trigger on it.  @ComputerGenie   Do you find it worthwhile to mine with the sha ASICs?

[29-Jul-18 06:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I did for the 1st 2 years I had them. Lack of any real advancement in chips has diminished any interest I had and why we switched to equihash ASICs and GPUs

[29-Jul-18 06:10 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Without any dev into better chips, I can't see me spending more on sha

[29-Jul-18 06:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That's confirmation enough for me to wait

[29-Jul-18 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
i try not to break KMD mining on any branch. if any branch isnt mining KMD plz let me know ASAP

[29-Jul-18 08:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@polycryptoblog thanks for the clarification, and how does this work exactly? People start mining or rent hashing power and use the hashing power as colleteral to start paying off debt?

[29-Jul-18 08:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Barter exchanges have a perennial issue of having too much credit floating in the network at any given time.  This is due to two factors,  1) lack of double coincidence of wants 2) overwhelming amount of soft good vendors ( services ) compared to amount of hard good vendors.  (Products/things).  The 2nd exacerbates the first.   Mining will provide a hard good into the barter exchange economy ,  and the icing on top is that hard Good is comparatively liquid.  Eventually the farm will resell miners, lease hosting as well.  FinCEN also has given the green light on selling mined coins as not being money transmission.   The overarching idea with the barter exchange is to create a credit network in the Komodo ecosystem giving it a stablecoin.  The big holdup is B2C interaction,  my original idea was to use something like the burn protocol to issue trade credit vouchers but I have some concerns with that as I stated in KBS channel.

@xRobeSx check the pool when you have a sec.  Most of the blocks stay 'pending' (for me a pool restart fixed that last time), not sure the payout is working either, or could be just because the blocks do not 'switch' to 'confirmed' status. I pointed a few hashes on Zilla just because, should have expected a payment by now...

[30-Jul-18 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
EQL chain seems stalled too... I put 20 cores on it and send a TX to get it mining, and it never mined a block or confirmed.

[30-Jul-18 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My notary is not on a fork, no... It looks like someone put a GPU on it then  realised they weren't getting paid anything and removed it... the difficulty has dropped but the 0.001 coins and the 10 change I had is vanished

[30-Jul-18 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
