at 1.2 million diff, it will be more than 13 minutes, let me estimate

[31-Jul-19 07:34 PM] SHossain#0007
i have command ready to hit enter

[31-Jul-19 07:36 PM] SHossain#0007

just record the time when you start

[31-Jul-19 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i estimate about a 30 minute wait for the first sixpack

[31-Jul-19 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
then gradually reducing to 15 minutes per sixpack

[31-Jul-19 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
recording the times the blocks start coming in and diff would be very useful, though it would be onchain evidence anyway

[31-Jul-19 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
so after the first few cycles where it is going regular, if it is, we can just let it run

first set of 6 blocks

[31-Jul-19 08:03 PM] SHossain#0007
the trend is that the diff goes up until first 5 CPU mined blocks and goes down on 6th

[31-Jul-19 08:04 PM] SHossain#0007
these 6 blocks generated with single thread in a timespan of 1 minute and 38 secords

[31-Jul-19 08:08 PM] SHossain#0007
next postings will have diff only after each 6 pack

[31-Jul-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
when was the last ASIC mined block, very curious as to the gap between that and the start of the sixpack

The last block submission from pool log

[31-Jul-19 08:15 PM] SHossain#0007
this is very interesting as until 3 days if any chain was left at that diff, CPU wouldn't have any chance to mine any block in a week, let alone in 30 mins

[31-Jul-19 08:19 PM] SHossain#0007

@SHossain how long to get first block with CPU?

[31-Jul-19 08:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
would be interesting to calculate how long adaptive takes, versus estimate of average time on default DAA

[31-Jul-19 08:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
would give a ratio of how much better it is

[31-Jul-19 08:29 PM] SHossain#0007
about 24 minutes

[31-Jul-19 08:29 PM] SHossain#0007
i mean since the last block from ASIC

[31-Jul-19 08:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
did James give an estimate for how long it would normally take? without adaptive?

[31-Jul-19 08:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
one year or something?

[31-Jul-19 08:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
it takes 13 minutes to kick in, so it was actually in effect for 11 minutes

[31-Jul-19 08:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
that works crazy fast!

[31-Jul-19 08:30 PM] SHossain#0007
i started CPU mining at 20:55 and the first set of 6 blocks came in almost instantly

normal DAA does not adjust until the next block

[31-Jul-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
if it takes a year to mine the next block, this is a problem

[31-Jul-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
a fast DAA will get the diff back to hashrate in about 50 blocks

[31-Jul-19 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
but if the average is 6 months per block, then we are talking 25 years

the gap between blocks are getting closer

[31-Jul-19 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes and the time for the six blocks longer

[31-Jul-19 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
seems pretty constant 16 minutes per 6 blocks!

[31-Jul-19 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
this is a fantastic result. still at 400000x, but as long as it continues 2/3 reducing the diff every 2 hours, it should be to 14k in 8 hrs from stranding

[31-Jul-19 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
and from there still another 8 hours before it gets to anything reasonable for a single CPU to mine normally, 170 diff after 16 hrs, so probably needs another 8 hours to get to a diff of 2. so estimate is 1.3 million diff down to 2 in 24 hours with a single CPU

not need to keep tracking every sixpack, just a summary a few more times as it gets to diff of 1

[31-Jul-19 09:48 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. i will stop monitoring now. i was wondering how would i keep track when i will be sleeping :abused_smiley:

I just wonder how fast the difficulty would drop if none were mining....

[31-Jul-19 09:51 PM] SHossain#0007
once CHMEX makes an explorer, it will be even easier and charts witll be there

[31-Jul-19 09:52 PM] SHossain#0007
without mining the diff wouldn't drop

[31-Jul-19 09:52 PM] SHossain#0007
it will just hang in the last known diff until the next block mined

[31-Jul-19 09:52 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Than I misinterpreted jl777c's piece on medium

[31-Jul-19 10:06 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Any way to integrate this 'extra blocktime governor' into the standard blocktime governor in such a way that the difficulty of the next block does also factor in the adjustments made by AdaptiveDPoW? That would reduce the time to get to an acceptable difficulty even more.

@SHossain `it will just hang in the last known diff until the next block mined` if this is the case, stalls would still need manual fixing, no?

[01-Aug-19 12:18 AM] SHossain#0007
every chain will stall if no one is mining.

[01-Aug-19 12:19 AM] SHossain#0007
single CPU thread mining will not keep it stalled at all with adaptivepow

[01-Aug-19 12:19 AM] Alright#0419
need to wrap my head around it

[01-Aug-19 12:19 AM] Alright#0419
let's say I leave 10msol on it for a few minutes

[01-Aug-19 12:19 AM] Alright#0419
then instantly stop

[01-Aug-19 12:20 AM] Alright#0419

[01-Aug-19 12:20 AM] Alright#0419
no?

[01-Aug-19 12:20 AM] SHossain#0007
no

[01-Aug-19 12:20 AM] Alright#0419
it will lower the diff between blocks?

[01-Aug-19 12:20 AM] SHossain#0007
30 mins to an hour max for the first 6 blocks and then it will continue

[01-Aug-19 12:20 AM] Alright#0419
so it's dynamically changing required diff between blocks?

[01-Aug-19 12:20 AM] SHossain#0007
check from here ^^

just use NH, can rent magnitudes higher hash rate for dirt cheap

that's what we would be defending against anyway

[01-Aug-19 12:21 AM] Alright#0419
not a handful of ASICs

[01-Aug-19 12:22 AM] SHossain#0007
we stopped mining over 1 M sol when the diff was 1.2 million
then, started CPU mining 25 mins later which got blocks almost instantly as it was about 30 mins since we mined the last block

[01-Aug-19 12:22 AM] SHossain#0007
now block 2483 and diff is 40791

[01-Aug-19 12:22 AM] Alright#0419
so it is changing required diff *between* blocks?

[01-Aug-19 12:22 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

[01-Aug-19 12:23 AM] Alright#0419
