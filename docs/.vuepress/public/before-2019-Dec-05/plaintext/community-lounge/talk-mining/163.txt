how do i know when to use E ?

[08-Aug-19 01:30 PM] zawy#5864
Always, if R is not triggered.....but the diff it uses post-R should not be such a wild value as R, but what D outputs at that time.  Actually, D is never used in this idea since I want a penalty on attacker's first block....this means every block has to vary a lot based on tipdiff

[08-Aug-19 01:31 PM] zawy#5864
but have digi in background as input to RST for non-RST values (else RST uses ctB), and always as input to E

[08-Aug-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
i tried E active priot to RST, but it adapted pretty fast and RST rarely triggered. probably need looser triggers in that setup

[08-Aug-19 01:32 PM] zawy#5864
nBits should remain like it is.

[08-Aug-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean the RST outer numerator/denominator trigger

[08-Aug-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
it seemed to do better with 3/4 instead of 1/2

[08-Aug-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but then i switched to all three RST active and it worked so well, i put the EMA at the end to not change the good RST behavior

[08-Aug-19 01:36 PM] zawy#5864
We need my TSA model working for these ideas, immediately see the results and we would remain  on the same page.   With the math working, you would then turn it into code

[08-Aug-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes!

[08-Aug-19 01:36 PM] zawy#5864
If live testing gave results differnt than math modelling, then you track down the error in implemantation

[08-Aug-19 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
in the meantime, i think it is time for some ASIC testing

[08-Aug-19 01:40 PM] zawy#5864
Yeah.  OK, I'll try to get the model working.  Then you can modify it to do what you're doing.

[08-Aug-19 01:55 PM] SHossain#0007
ZAWY16?

[08-Aug-19 02:06 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. ZAWY19 pool ready now. ASIC on standby

[08-Aug-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain there is a new rpc call getminingCSV, does that work for you?

[08-Aug-19 02:21 PM] SHossain#0007
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ZAWY19 getminingCSV
error code: -32601
error message:
Method not found
```

[08-Aug-19 02:22 PM] SHossain#0007
using latest from nSPV branch

[08-Aug-19 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry gen not get

[08-Aug-19 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ZAWY19 genminingCSV

[08-Aug-19 02:23 PM] SHossain#0007
i see

[08-Aug-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
need to get 6 more blocks to full the digishield, then will reduce to 1 CPU, 15 minutes or less after that will be ready for ASIC

[08-Aug-19 02:23 PM] SHossain#0007
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ZAWY19 genminingCSV
{
  "result": "success",
  "created": "ZAWY19_mining.csv"
}
```

[08-Aug-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
ZAWY19_mining.csv should exist in same dir you launched komodod from

[08-Aug-19 02:25 PM] SHossain#0007
yep

[08-Aug-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
have been running 9 cores since genesis, at height 126 will go to 1 core, i think by 130 diff will be down to 2 or 3 and we can start ASIC

[08-Aug-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
10 blocks, but probably 20 minutes or so

[08-Aug-19 02:27 PM] SHossain#0007
as soon as i get ping, i'll start the ASIC. all settings and pool ready

[08-Aug-19 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
transition from RST to digishield was near perfect as it started with 35 diff, which seems to be pretty close to what 9 cores should be. so that fix worked!

[08-Aug-19 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
reduced to 1 core at height 127

[08-Aug-19 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so this single CPU should be the only CPU miner and it will run while the ASIC is on and will rescue the stalled chain. the big test is how fast it will stop the fast blocks from ASIC

[08-Aug-19 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
diff should start reducing in 5 minutes

[08-Aug-19 02:33 PM] SHossain#0007
my CPU mining is off

[08-Aug-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
exp() is helping the single CPU get the 9x core mined chain back to diff of 2

[08-Aug-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
diif 4

[08-Aug-19 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
ok start the ASIC

[08-Aug-19 02:43 PM] SHossain#0007
started

[08-Aug-19 02:43 PM] SHossain#0007
at block 135

[08-Aug-19 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
starting from a baseline of diff 5 to 9, so ASIC will be a 1000x to 3000x increase

[08-Aug-19 02:44 PM] SHossain#0007
kicked off

[08-Aug-19 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
138 was the first block it mined

[08-Aug-19 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
then diff went to 587!

[08-Aug-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it still found it so it made it even harder, now ASIC is struggling to find a block

[08-Aug-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
so 3 fast blocks and brick wall

[08-Aug-19 02:45 PM] SHossain#0007

[08-Aug-19 02:45 PM] SHossain#0007
136, from my debug.log

[08-Aug-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
solve times were very slow

[08-Aug-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
56 and 42 seconds, so it seems ASIC not up to full speed till 138

[08-Aug-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
three blocks in a row 1 second solves

[08-Aug-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
ht 143 at 25866 diff!

[08-Aug-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
but ASIC is still solving it fast, so it will get even harder

[08-Aug-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
has 400 second deficit to make up

[08-Aug-19 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
almost a 3 minute block for 145, and counting

[08-Aug-19 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
diff 40k

[08-Aug-19 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
deficit down to 350 for W.3

[08-Aug-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
interestingly the deficit for W.6 is 432 and for W.12 is 383

[08-Aug-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess the non-genesis pattern is the reason why it isnt in order of W

[08-Aug-19 02:49 PM] SHossain#0007
ASIC is solving less blocks than chains without adaptivepow

[08-Aug-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
ASIC is solving as fast as a single CPU was ðŸ˜ƒ

[08-Aug-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
only profitable on/off would have been to stop after the first 3 seconds (3 blocks), but with 5 minutes time to turn on, this is not a good strategy

[08-Aug-19 02:51 PM] SHossain#0007
miner dashboard showing 11k sol. fan noise doesn't sound like it's being used fully

[08-Aug-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it is needing all its power to find blocks, diff is 30k and above

[08-Aug-19 02:52 PM] SHossain#0007
no, i was wrong about my last sentence

[08-Aug-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i think 30k is the eventual target diff, usually takes a few hundred blocks to get there

[08-Aug-19 02:52 PM] SHossain#0007
pool has maxdiff of 8

[08-Aug-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
with RST, it took 6 blocks

[08-Aug-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is using 11k sols, that is close to full output?

[08-Aug-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
got a lucky solve, 4 seconds for a 70k diff

[08-Aug-19 02:53 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, i didn't overclock. it's using factory settings

[08-Aug-19 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
diff is really escalated, this one might need exp() to solve

[08-Aug-19 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
145k diff, but it solved it in 73 seconds

[08-Aug-19 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess the ASIC diff is much higher than 30k, just before we never saw it get much past 20k as it took so long for it to adapt

[08-Aug-19 02:57 PM] SHossain#0007
which call you are using for the diff?

[08-Aug-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
getinfo

[08-Aug-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i know getmininginfo is different, but while RST is active, that value is pretty bogus

[08-Aug-19 02:58 PM] SHossain#0007
i see

[08-Aug-19 02:58 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[08-Aug-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
only when RST is not active is it valid

[08-Aug-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
and it is usually just offset by one block for the getinfo difficulty

[08-Aug-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
when the two are very close together, that means hashrate is stable and diff has likely adjusted properly to it

[08-Aug-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
right now they are off by 10x, so clearly things are not anywhere close to adjusted, though after 17 blocks of slowed ASIC blocks, we might see the two values get much closer

[08-Aug-19 02:59 PM] SHossain#0007
diff going down

[08-Aug-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
145k was a lucky solve

[08-Aug-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
probably 50k is where it will stabilize?

[08-Aug-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
another lucky solve 7 seconds for 338k diff

[08-Aug-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but the mining diff is now at 26k vs 50k, since we have 17 slowed ASIC blocks

[08-Aug-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
deficit is still 400+, we didnt catch up, but that is due to a sillybug in this version. already fixed. now we will see digishield take over with diff of 26k

[08-Aug-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
which is not far off from the equilibrium diff

[08-Aug-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
996 seconds for blocks 138 to 160, 83 seconds per block average, which includes the first 3 blocks at 1 seconds each. so it slowed things down to 83 seconds per block, while diff went up from 10 to 25k

[08-Aug-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
seems quite a successful prevention of excess coin emission, even with a 10000x attack

[08-Aug-19 03:05 PM] SHossain#0007

[08-Aug-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and a million times attack should be stopped with just an extra couple of blocks, with basically the same result

[08-Aug-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
digishield is giving up some extra blocks, but with the next version it wont have to adjust as far, current one is limited to 20 blocks past window, even for the RST.12, due to sillybug

[08-Aug-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
diff slowly climbing, now at 39k

[08-Aug-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, interesting! the ASIC got three fast blocks in a row. the RST was awoken to punish this

[08-Aug-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
i wonder what the effect would be, 3 lucky blocks looks a lot like 10x more hashrate

[08-Aug-19 03:10 PM] SHossain#0007
diff 131k

[08-Aug-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
and the ASIC is solving it

[08-Aug-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
did someone else join the pool?
