I'm having issues connecting to the Pirate pools GPU mining. I'm using a z addy and Claymore. Any fixes?

[25-Sep-18 10:23 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
I’m using the nvidia miner and can’t connect also

[25-Sep-18 10:28 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
Is there only one mining pool atm?

[25-Sep-18 10:29 PM] SHossain#0007

PIRATE needs a Z address as the username

[26-Sep-18 04:56 AM] FishyGuts#5085
No Pirate needs an X address .... :trollface:

[26-Sep-18 04:56 AM] FishyGuts#5085

`miningspeed removed KMD`
stop pissing off pool ops :trollface:

[26-Sep-18 12:52 PM] Alright#0419
They mined exactly 3 KMD in every single block they found for about 6 months

[26-Sep-18 12:53 PM] Alright#0419
likely burned 1000s of KMD

[26-Sep-18 12:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, I'm pretty sure that had nothing to do with the removal (iirc it was to do with feelz concerning a specific coin which shall not be named)

[26-Sep-18 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
yep

[26-Sep-18 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
the worse part about them mining exactly 3 kmd was that I told them about it, they knew and continued to do it for 2 months

are the mining pools for pirate paying out? i have less in my wallet than it says is paid

[26-Sep-18 02:04 PM] xRobeSx#5136
afaik yes @superslack what pool are you using?

[26-Sep-18 02:05 PM] superslack#6186
https://pirate.komodostats.com

[26-Sep-18 02:05 PM] superslack#6186
maybe it take some time from getting paid to transfer in the wallet?

[26-Sep-18 02:12 PM] Alright#0419
it's @webworker01's pool

Opinions from the miners here.
Just started mining with my GTX 1050 over a week ago, just for the experience. Started mining Verus coin a few days ago, using my cpu for the same reason. 

Conclusion: CPU mining Verus is a waste of electricity (for me anyway). 

GPU mining gets me a few coins @ 190 sols/s, but when I see other miners at 10,000  sols/s and higher, it seems there is a better way. 

Lately it appears that everyone is going the ASIC/Z9 mini route, making the GPU less desirable. I keep hearing how those miners could be doorstops soon because many projects may change their algos. It also makes sense that when everybody Is using an ASIC, then really nobody has an advantage. 

But that doesn’t seem to stop people from buying the Z9’s, sometimes in large amounts, like what ploycryptoblog is doing. I happen to see on craigslist in my area someone is selling 4 Z9 minis for $750/each. My question is: do you think it would be worth picking one up? My thoughts are that I’ll be mining for the future and not selling anything now, so maybe this would be good for the early projects on Komodo where many would be using similar algos. I’m also thinking time is of the essence. 

With so many ASIC equipment starting to proliferate the space and new/better ones coming out (and projects changing algos), I would need to mine as much as I can now. Of course, I do wonder why is that guys selling his z9 minis in the first place?
 
Thoughts?

[26-Sep-18 07:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My 1st though is: ' use `Enter` more often'

[26-Sep-18 07:21 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Unrelated to how much you're going to make back mining KMD... IMO its nice to have the asic for down the road coins as well. You never know when a new assetchain like PIRATE or STAKED will start up and you can get a head start mining with your mini.

[26-Sep-18 07:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@yorklab joke aside, my eyes aren't what they used to be, can you break the ASIC and VERUS parts down separately?

[26-Sep-18 07:40 PM] yorklab#7270
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Yes, I was on the phone at work and in a hurry...I didn't like it when it posted, but had to leave so left it. Should be better now.

[26-Sep-18 07:42 PM] yorklab#7270
@xRobeSx That was my thoughts also. I've only been doing this for less than two weeks and didn't want to jump the gun without some knowledgeable input.

[26-Sep-18 07:43 PM] sunk818#0255
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 settings, appearance, chat font scaling...

[26-Sep-18 07:43 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Just incase there is any confusion since you mentioned VRSC at the start. VerusHash can't be mined with the asic though. So know you'll be limited to just KMD, other equihash coins, and equihash assetchains @yorklab

[26-Sep-18 07:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@sunk818 If you'd be so kind as to point me to the specific setting that separates a users 15 sentences into paragraphs on my end only, I'll be more than happy to toggle the setting you're talking about

[26-Sep-18 07:47 PM] yorklab#7270
@xRobeSx Yes, i do realize that, just looking at the all the variables. I am close to upgrading my old computer and thought about an amd threadripper for the cores and CPU mining and high end GPUs for other mining. I also thought about just forgetting the whole idea completely.

[26-Sep-18 07:48 PM] yorklab#7270
Just good to get different ideas from the others who are experienced

[26-Sep-18 07:49 PM] yorklab#7270
I could just decide to quit while I'm ahead.

[26-Sep-18 07:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@yorklab the key to answering the question is you knowing what you want long-term and if you can afford scale.
If you want some kind of in-and-out, then you'd be better off with newer GPUs to give you some "mobility" as to what you can do next. If you want to stay with a specific algo "until the wheels fall off", then ASICs will always be a good choice. If the latter, then sooner is always better.
Scale of ASICs (or any leading edge hw) is best done with the "as much as you can, as fast as you can" mentality. If it takes 2 months to reach positive ROI on deviceX and you can get 12 of them, then you can get 12 more in 2 months. If you only get 1 at a time, then your growth rate will be exponentially slower.
My personal philosophy, as cliche as it is, is "go big or go home".

[26-Sep-18 07:58 PM] yorklab#7270
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I was just planning to get one and figured I could mine as much of the different coins that I can, while I can, but never planned to scale. I think you have given me very good advice. Money might be better served buying new computer equipment and mine what I can that way; and as you said, it gives me better mobility.    Thank you.

[26-Sep-18 07:59 PM] yorklab#7270
And thank you @xRobeSx

@yorklab as a plan of purely hobby-mining, the best anyone can tell you is to weigh what you feel drawn to. If I were to start today, as a personal-only thing, I'd go with an ASIC and mine KMD until the rig died. For a higher profit-minded venture, I'd use that same ASIC for ZCL.

{Reactions}
Hush 

[26-Sep-18 08:05 PM] yorklab#7270
Yes, it was just for a hobby. I figured if I can get my money back in time (even if over a years time when I might sell the coins I mined), then I'm good, because in most hobbies, you never make your money back.

[26-Sep-18 08:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
For pure hobby, I'm all-in on KMD and assetchains (far more than I should be 😛 )

[26-Sep-18 08:09 PM] yorklab#7270
Same here

[26-Sep-18 08:46 PM] sunk818#0255
@yorklab are you calculating electricity bill?

[26-Sep-18 08:47 PM] sunk818#0255
Cpu and GPU have resale value and you can do other stuff with them

[26-Sep-18 08:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as electric, ASIC and GPU are close enough to the same for 1 unit

[26-Sep-18 08:50 PM] yorklab#7270
**`@yorklab are you calculating electricity bill?`**

No, I'm not; it's high where I live. My idea was mine now then sell down the road when value is high. Maybe it would work out, maybe not. But  I was thinking the same  as you mentioned about the computer setup @sunk818 . A computer has many uses, so can't loose really if I was going to buy anyway.

[26-Sep-18 10:10 PM] sunk818#0255
How much would electricity cost you for one month z9?

[26-Sep-18 10:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$21.915 @ 10 cents per kWh

[26-Sep-18 10:31 PM] yorklab#7270
mine could run up to 16 cents

[27-Sep-18 07:20 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I wish I had 10c per kWh

[27-Sep-18 07:21 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Is anyone running their miners off solar power? If so, what sort of solar system have you got (size/number of panels)?

[27-Sep-18 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was

[27-Sep-18 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
5.2KW of panels and 5kw inverter ... but they only make 20kwH a day due to the sun hardly pointing at them directly at them, because it moves around, the fucker 😡

[27-Sep-18 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not worth it

[27-Sep-18 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
still my powerbill is $50 though.. which is nice... but not enough spare power for miners

[27-Sep-18 07:58 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So you are mainly using it for household electricity, vice powering the miners?

[27-Sep-18 07:58 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Do you have any batteries?

[27-Sep-18 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nar miners are just off

[27-Sep-18 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and no batteries yet

[27-Sep-18 08:10 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
they are just off? like turned off?

[27-Sep-18 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[27-Sep-18 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I used them to mine a buch of pirate on the first few days but quickly went tpo rented asics

[27-Sep-18 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
too noisy, need to get rid of it .

[27-Sep-18 11:36 AM] yorklab#7270
@blackjok3r Rented Asics? Where do go for that, and do you feel it's worth it?

[27-Sep-18 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was when it was the only ASIC on pritae and I mined 100% of the coins for a few days

[27-Sep-18 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
regret selling so may of them now 😢

[27-Sep-18 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Mining Rig rentals.... but you need NH now to get any meaninful amount.

[27-Sep-18 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The halving was increased I think, I am sure that difficulty will some down later... mining now seems pointless.

[27-Sep-18 11:38 AM] yorklab#7270
Yes, in the very short time I've been doing this, about 2 weeks, it seems mining has become specialized. I should say that I am learning that mining is starting to become specialized.

[27-Sep-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like anything, if theres money to be made, people will speicalise at it.

[27-Sep-18 12:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Solar for miners works pretty good on a small scale, from what I've been told.

[27-Sep-18 12:17 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I am wondering how feasible it would be on a large scale. Say, building a solar farm for the purpose of powering miners. There would be a lot of limitations and hurdles to overcome, but I think it could be achievable

[27-Sep-18 12:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
on a large scale, solar sucks for mining

[27-Sep-18 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
We looked into it for our partnership and it would take over an acre of panels to cover our needs

[27-Sep-18 12:21 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It's a pitty. I guess that's why that Russian fellow bought an old coal power plant and started it up again. They estimated he would be paying like 0.03c/kwh

[27-Sep-18 12:21 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
An acre of panels?!?

[27-Sep-18 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ya and the building is only 30'x50' 🤣

[27-Sep-18 12:22 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Wow

[27-Sep-18 12:23 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
What was the efficiency of the panels? Do you get long periods of sun on average?

[27-Sep-18 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
any really big setup would likely need a solar field the size of a small city

[27-Sep-18 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the details of the panels wasn't handled by me
as for sun, we're on a mountain top in Arkansas, sun is about as good here as anywhere in the US can be

[27-Sep-18 12:34 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ahh fair enough. I was looking into one of the fairly big solar farms here in Aus. A local government shelled out $15 mill AUD. It will supply all of the governments energy needs in total. Sounds like a decent investment xD

[27-Sep-18 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, but when you take into account what all mining needs, it gets a lot bigger and a lot more expensive.
My personal equipment (the stuff I keep at home) runs us about the same as 10 homes

[30-Sep-18 10:20 AM] denio#8067
Hey guys, yesterday i started to solo Mine KMD. I saw that the BR is 3...but i get 6.14KMD out of my First Block that i have found. How is that possible?

[30-Sep-18 10:21 AM] Alright#0419
KMD has something called active user rewards in which you can receive 5% APR on your KMD

[30-Sep-18 10:21 AM] Alright#0419
if someone has accrued rewards but does not claim it, it goes to the miner of the block in which they send a transaction

[30-Sep-18 10:21 AM] Alright#0419
typically because of ledger users

[30-Sep-18 10:22 AM] Alright#0419
ledger doesn't support claiming it atm

[30-Sep-18 10:22 AM] denio#8067
ah ok...so just lucky with the first block 😃

[30-Sep-18 10:22 AM] Alright#0419
yes 😃

[30-Sep-18 10:22 AM] denio#8067
thanks for the explanation!
