normal companies do this all the time, pretend to have a product

[01-Apr-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it is getting the attention of people, create a buzz, do the ICO, cashout, then let others worry about all the details

[01-Apr-19 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆🏽 that's so 2018

[01-Apr-19 10:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
perhaps they can be the free marketing DPoW needs, when it eventually fails

is VBK buying back VBK at a set price or something?

[01-Apr-19 11:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
who wants to buy VBK at these prices?

[01-Apr-19 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
$20 guaranteed!

[01-Apr-19 11:03 AM] dukeleto#7326

So OTC price was 5 cent with 50% lockup. IEO price was 10 cent. Is that true?
50% OTC token unlock = 100% IEO token with same price.
```

[01-Apr-19 11:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
trying to wrap my head around what VBK is trying to do

[01-Apr-19 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
double money for OTC investors, and make a giant profit at the IEO

[01-Apr-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
paying double what KMD raised at ICO for advisors.... efficiency is not really what VBK is about

[01-Apr-19 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
so if the mining calcs are using 10 cents, that seems unlikely to hold up when the OTC buyers dump and maybe even the insiders wont be long term hodl

[01-Apr-19 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
if they are subsidizing the 100,000 BTC tx per day, then it wont take long for it to burn through $18 million

[01-Apr-19 11:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
2X the daily profit of VRSC on a blackminer F1, but VRSC has a "stable" price right now. VBK seems like a house of cards ready to fall over at the first breeze

[01-Apr-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
dont you have confidence in all their high price advisors to solve whatever problems arise?

[01-Apr-19 01:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
serious red flags in all directions with VBK, but I am slowly learning that sometimes it's just about churning profit and "believing" in the thing you are mining isn't really necessary. I prefer to mine and hold things I believe in, versus mining fly-by-night-coins and hoping to sell them on exchanges before they are dumped to oblivion. I am still finding the middle ground between each side of the spectrum

[01-Apr-19 01:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
let's see if they are honest enough to give me an honest answer: https://twitter.com/dukeleto/status/1112699015995379712

@VeriBlock where can I find out more about exactly how cryptocoins can add VeriBlock to their codebase and what the integration and service fees would look like?

[01-Apr-19 04:37 PM] actionslacks#4072
And In a space where all exchanges are constantly doing extremely shady shit, Bittrex would likely emerge from a massive VBK pump and dump relatively unscathed and with a tidy pile of cash to add to the rest.

[01-Apr-19 04:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
wow, there is even a CPU mining pool for VBK, in addition to many GPU and a few FPGA pools: https://wiki.veriblock.org/index.php?title=List_of_mining_pools#FPGA_Pools

[01-Apr-19 04:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
@actionslacks exactly, this behavior is encouraged by the market, not selected against

[01-Apr-19 04:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
let that sink in. There are active FPGAs and people are still so desperate to mine it, that there is a CPU pool. Most likely from a smart pool op that just wants fees

[01-Apr-19 04:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's all built on the "Greater Fool" theory it seems. Everybody knows it's a scam, everybody knows the emperor has no clothes, but they see all the short term potential profits to be made, and everybody rushes in. It all relies on a greater fool to buy your bag

[01-Apr-19 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_begins to look around at his mountains of GPUs and get FOMO_

[01-Apr-19 05:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
Earning double per day on my FPGA sounds nice, but it could be a trap

[01-Apr-19 05:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
but then again, people paid $400 for ZCL at one point

[01-Apr-19 05:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
cost and quality are uncorrelated in cryptocoins

[01-Apr-19 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the "worst" that can happen is I rack up a $1200 power bill for a month

that's incredible .. investing into a project without source code :troll_thuglife:

[01-Apr-19 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont think many investors, most are in it for the flip from the expected pump. paying 15 cents via mining when IEO is at 10cents. thats speculative mining. and if it is what it looks like, the insiders wont be very long term hodling either. my prediction is that it will do the expected pump and dump and then the reality will set it. the part about no economically viable model

[01-Apr-19 09:02 PM] $tefano.#3560
the same end of CELR on binance james

[01-Apr-19 09:02 PM] $tefano.#3560
IEO is new fraud ICO

[01-Apr-19 09:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's about what I figure too, but I don't need liquidity to mine 🙂

[01-Apr-19 09:04 PM] $tefano.#3560
it's the first IEO on bittrex? if yes probably bittrex will support it initially before go down like many many coins that we have seen in the last 3/4 years ..

[01-Apr-19 09:06 PM] $tefano.#3560
congrats for Dilithium @jl777c and komodo devs 👏  this is an important news not VBK

yes. I was surprised how seamlessly dilithium fit into the existing structure

granted it is 4kb tx and only 16tx/sec, but that should be adequate as cluster can always be usd

in Oct 17, they did a logo update and in Nov they got listed on topia with the new icon and topia's wash bot got stuck and pumped the price 3600x before deposits even opened

There's a cryptonight assetchain? 🤔

fwiw, I'm not knocking AMD or saying it's a bad price for the right person, just that I wish they were NV and I could use them in what I do

[02-Apr-19 03:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I wonder if there is any AMD optimized BOINC projects?

[02-Apr-19 04:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
likely a few

[02-Apr-19 06:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`or saying it's a bad price`
actually, looking at the numbers, 32KH/s vs 248KH/s of an A8+ (at half that price)....

Where can i find a peer magic number for a specific assetchain

in the terminal print when you run it (it's the endian inverse)
