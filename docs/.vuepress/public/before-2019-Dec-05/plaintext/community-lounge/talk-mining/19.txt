[03-Jul-18 07:55 PM] Alright#0419
miningspeed could have hit 1000 KMD blocks in that time and would have burned 997 of it

[03-Jul-18 07:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
mining in a pool =
* adding "centralization" (e.g. - in Bitcoin, because people mine more often in larger pools 1 company can easily hit 51%)
* gives income away for no reason other than convenience
* adds additional trust to a trustless system

[03-Jul-18 08:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
"clustering": {
        "enabled": true,
        "forks": "2"
    },

[03-Jul-18 08:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
Trying to add a few more threads now and this is def not limiting to 2...

[03-Jul-18 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
dump the quotes

[03-Jul-18 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"forks": 2

[03-Jul-18 08:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
ah

[03-Jul-18 08:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
quotes and qualifying values has always eluded me...

[03-Jul-18 08:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
can never remember when they are appropriate or not

[03-Jul-18 08:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"2" = string
2 = number

[03-Jul-18 08:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
just like
"true" = string
true = Boolean value of true/yes/1

[03-Jul-18 08:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
working well so far... still get an occassional fork dying from getblocktemplate connection hanging up... but 4 threds we will see what happens

[03-Jul-18 08:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm still thinking that your os wrapped in a dogshit has something to do with that 😛

[03-Jul-18 08:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
it might lol... will be moving on to Server 2016 hosted VM of Ubuntu to see how that behaves

[03-Jul-18 08:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'd almost bet that when you do it will go away

[03-Jul-18 08:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
i hope so... i dlike to get these devs to build an inhouse set to begin testing and building

[03-Jul-18 08:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
but we run everything off MS

[03-Jul-18 08:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
fingers crossed my block is coming to 100 confirms... i have payments set up as well so lets see...

[03-Jul-18 08:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
There it went

[03-Jul-18 09:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I feel sooooooo dumb

[03-Jul-18 09:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I *just now* realized that ZCL didn't join the 144,5 circle-jerk

[03-Jul-18 09:41 PM] bishop#9773
ZCL, the coin that just won't die

[03-Jul-18 09:49 PM] Alright#0419
which coins are still on 200,9

[03-Jul-18 09:50 PM] Alright#0419
KMD ZEC BTCP? ZCL CMM BCI

[03-Jul-18 09:50 PM] Alright#0419
any others

[03-Jul-18 09:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
With all those Z9's KMD gonna have a nice strong hashrate.

[03-Jul-18 09:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Anyone here feel like the 133.5 can be software patched or is it an impossibility?

[03-Jul-18 09:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
144,5? *

[03-Jul-18 09:54 PM] BlackJesus#6161
144,5 will fork the z9's we won't be moving to that.

[03-Jul-18 09:54 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Isn't that the k and n values

[03-Jul-18 09:55 PM] Alright#0419
z9 minis are confirmed to not have enough memory for 144,5

[03-Jul-18 10:11 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Zec is not doing it either

[04-Jul-18 04:51 AM] BlackJesus#6161
z9 mini back in stock!

[04-Jul-18 04:54 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
shhhhhhhhh

[04-Jul-18 05:27 AM] BlackJesus#6161
bought another

[04-Jul-18 05:27 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Dude This coinex thing is insane

[04-Jul-18 05:27 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
?

[04-Jul-18 05:27 AM] BlackJesus#6161
if you verify and do the coinex mining

[04-Jul-18 05:27 AM] BlackJesus#6161
its over 3 months

[04-Jul-18 05:27 AM] BlackJesus#6161
you will get 1 million cet if you leave it open doing their "trading mining"

[04-Jul-18 05:28 AM] BlackJesus#6161
1 million cet based on todays volume will net you .3 bch dividend per day

[04-Jul-18 05:28 AM] BlackJesus#6161
from the daily dividend payouts

[04-Jul-18 05:28 AM] BlackJesus#6161
you make 500 cet "mining" per hour

[04-Jul-18 05:28 AM] BlackJesus#6161
cet is 12 cents a coin

[04-Jul-18 05:28 AM] BlackJesus#6161
They buy it back at the end of the month with the 20% they dont distribute back to holders and burn it

[04-Jul-18 05:28 AM] BlackJesus#6161
This is literally "FREE MONEY"

[04-Jul-18 05:29 AM] BlackJesus#6161
they are giving away 3.6b of the coins over the next 3 months to verified accounts

some day, someone will do some shit like that and not require that I be some dumbass millennial with a feken microPC masquerading as a "phone" in order to take a "selfie" to feken verify 😣

[04-Jul-18 05:40 AM] BlackJesus#6161
lol

[04-Jul-18 05:40 AM] BlackJesus#6161
it is a gay verification

[04-Jul-18 05:40 AM] BlackJesus#6161
but its honestly worth it. I mean seriously you think a chinese company is going to comply with american regulations with all the trade war stuff going on right now

[04-Jul-18 05:41 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I't not free if I have to buy a $500 feken phone to take 1 feken picture

[04-Jul-18 05:41 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I used my webcam.

[04-Jul-18 05:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
who, besides sluts on pr0n sites, over 12 has a webcam?

[04-Jul-18 05:42 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Don't judge me I tried streaming about a year and half ago lol.

[04-Jul-18 05:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
lol

[04-Jul-18 05:43 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I haven't had a webcam since 2002

[04-Jul-18 05:44 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm an adult male, my phone makes calls and my camera faces forward 🤦🏿

[04-Jul-18 05:46 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
` and give them away to all traders proportionately to their trading volume`

[04-Jul-18 05:47 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
with 2 billion USD pumped in the last 2 days on BTC/USD you ain't getting shit unless you're a 🐳

[04-Jul-18 05:52 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and their list of coins sucks donkey balls 😦

[04-Jul-18 06:12 AM] BlackJesus#6161
it's most likely bitmain themselves

[04-Jul-18 06:12 AM] BlackJesus#6161
pushing that volume

[04-Jul-18 06:21 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
for the record, via owns it, not bm

[04-Jul-18 06:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I lost my phone the other night, but it was returned today with all my money in it and everything... I already bought an OPPO chinese selfie phone because it was the cheapest one I could buy, its has a 16MP front facing camera, even bigger than the 'real one' on the rear... you can have it if you want 🤣

[04-Jul-18 06:31 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Even at $250, there's no part of me that's spending that to take 1 feken picture for a shit CEX

[04-Jul-18 06:32 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
be cheaper to dig up van gogh's corpse, bring him back to life, and force him to do my portrait

[04-Jul-18 06:33 AM] BlackJesus#6161
viabtc is a subidary of bitmain

[04-Jul-18 06:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
man you spend too much time on reddit 🤦🏿

[04-Jul-18 06:39 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I guess bitmain has an investment on VIABTC but they operate independently

[04-Jul-18 06:40 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes, joint venture is much different than a parent company

[04-Jul-18 11:42 AM] benohanlon#1119
anybody got some bitmain coupons please? I need x 3 🔌

[04-Jul-18 11:43 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
_can't help, they just ate 5 of mine on an "expired" order 😭_

[04-Jul-18 11:44 AM] benohanlon#1119
yeah they my money back when i wired it - i was so salty cos it was my first miner 😦

[04-Jul-18 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think they lock coupons to orders knowing there will be chain lag and LOL that they get to screw folks when it happens

[04-Jul-18 01:25 PM] BlackJesus#6161
computer genie

[04-Jul-18 01:26 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I know you got some 100 dolla coupons just lieing around

[04-Jul-18 01:26 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@ComputerGenie

[04-Jul-18 06:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright HUSH is also staying with (200,9)

[04-Jul-18 07:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
HUSH? Is that still a thing? 😮

[04-Jul-18 07:51 PM] bishop#9773
Oh hush you

_ComputerGenie isn't a Ubuntu fan, but that's about the best beginner's guide there is_

[05-Jul-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@BlackJesus all my coupons are spent (unless BM decides to not be a bunch of twats and gives me back the ones from my "timed out" order that wasn't even submitted) 😣

[05-Jul-18 04:13 PM] BlackJesus#6161
did you post submit a ticket

[05-Jul-18 04:13 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'd lost 5 250's and they gave those back to me

[05-Jul-18 04:16 PM] jansako#3330
Do you guys know if you can run more than one assetchain per core? Trying to set up a stratum with 3 chains on a 2 core VPS. The first two work just fine, the 3rd one is giving me trouble...

[05-Jul-18 04:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@BlackJesus I did, but no action yet
@jansako there is no correlation between threads/cores and amount of coins/chains

[05-Jul-18 05:12 PM] BlackJesus#6161
What is the size of komodos blockchain right now

[05-Jul-18 05:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
blocks folder ~4.88GB

[05-Jul-18 06:36 PM] BlackJesus#6161

is this wrking for komodo

[05-Jul-18 07:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, no equihash calculator accounts for KMD notary node blocks

[05-Jul-18 07:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
you mine KMD because you think it has more future value than CoinX, not because it has more "today" value

[05-Jul-18 09:24 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Exactly
