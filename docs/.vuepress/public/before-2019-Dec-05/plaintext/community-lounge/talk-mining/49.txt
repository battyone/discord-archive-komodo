how i calculate profit?

[02-Oct-18 10:11 PM] Hermes#6934
I think it will be depending on the OTC market here is the channel to see it #deleted-channel

[02-Oct-18 10:11 PM] Hermes#6934
You should be seeing after a while the coins getting to your address.

[02-Oct-18 10:12 PM] NicoSama#0960
I wanted to know how many PIRATES I earn a day by undermining

[02-Oct-18 10:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
undermining?

[02-Oct-18 10:18 PM] Hermes#6934
With 2 Z9s mini last week you could make like 400 per day

[02-Oct-18 10:18 PM] Hermes#6934
Not sure now...

[02-Oct-18 10:20 PM] jl777c#5810
about 9000 per Msol

[02-Oct-18 10:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆🏼 or a little less, depending on the day

[02-Oct-18 11:05 PM] jl777c#5810
or 7000, i guess a lot less at 50Msol nethash

[03-Oct-18 03:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
considering buying 
masterwatt-maker-1200
or
masterwatt-maker-1500

[03-Oct-18 03:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
any suggestions/advice?

[03-Oct-18 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
anything that doesnt have a 40mm fan will do just fine, as far as I know all bitmain ASIC use PCI-E 8 pin plugs

[03-Oct-18 04:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
At store now which is closing

[03-Oct-18 04:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the server PSU are the most efficiant price/wbut they will exploder your brain with the noise they make

[03-Oct-18 04:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just get the biggest one with PCI-E 8 pin plugs

[03-Oct-18 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you might be able to convert all the molex to 8 pin, but it cna be dangerous ar high amps... I did all my own wireing on my miner

[03-Oct-18 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just got the plugs off ebay

[03-Oct-18 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and soldered them all on

[03-Oct-18 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wouldnt mind getting rid of GPU and gettting ASICs but really dont have anywhere to put them

The guy helping here says I will need this too to power on psu

[03-Oct-18 04:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Can return this psu if didn’t fit my needs

[03-Oct-18 04:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So buying it

[03-Oct-18 04:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
All that is is a jumper

[03-Oct-18 04:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Conect the green wire to any blakc wire

[03-Oct-18 04:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
paperclip is just fine :trollface:

[03-Oct-18 04:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
literally what I use on any  rig that only needs 1 psu 👆🏼

[03-Oct-18 04:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I only seen lil jumbpers long ago 😅

[03-Oct-18 04:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Thanks will bug u guys with more n00b question in few hours 🤪

[03-Oct-18 04:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Also, @blackjok3r they are 6s and not 8s 😉

[03-Oct-18 04:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Many GPUs use 8s because of the addition (-) wires, but all of BM products use multiple 6s

[03-Oct-18 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh cool... 8 and 6 are same on all mine anyway, the extra 2 dissconect on and off. Seems pointless them being there tbh, having more -ve donest increaes total amps possible as the +ve is same size still

[03-Oct-18 04:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Feken Mac people 😛

I only just turned this miner on and it's noisey as hell!

[03-Oct-18 07:11 AM] jl777c#5810
you need a cone of silence

[03-Oct-18 07:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
haven't even found it's IP yet. and it feels like it's mining at full power already

[03-Oct-18 07:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄

[03-Oct-18 07:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the place I live is small. I might have to move to either a house or get myself an office if I want them to run

[03-Oct-18 07:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so probably after testing I'll just turn this off

[03-Oct-18 07:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
till I move to new place

[03-Oct-18 07:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
😕

[03-Oct-18 07:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Exactly why I didnt buy any of them

[03-Oct-18 07:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
now looking for setup pdf guide

[03-Oct-18 07:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what is this damn thing's default password 😄

[03-Oct-18 07:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught of a few ways to utilise a building Ihave on my property, but in summer time here it would be so hot in there they would not be able to work, reqiring massive ducts and things to and from my house... to cool them, upside was free heating in winter with that system.

[03-Oct-18 07:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but t would simply never pay for iteself, so I went with a huge pile of solar panels instead, and no longer have a power bill.

[03-Oct-18 07:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
😮 wow, would like to see your setup

[03-Oct-18 07:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt build it lol

[03-Oct-18 07:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄

[03-Oct-18 07:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
too hard basket

[03-Oct-18 07:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not able to find the login password it asks on accessing it's IP

[03-Oct-18 07:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
bitmains website is crap

[03-Oct-18 07:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`haven't even found it's IP yet. and it feels like it's mining at full power already`
That's because it is; in their pool and for their account

[03-Oct-18 07:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
_dumb support of bitmain_

[03-Oct-18 07:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 that's rip off 🤔 of ma precious electricity 😄

[03-Oct-18 07:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not for them it isn't :trollface:

[03-Oct-18 07:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I often wonder how many lucky hashes they've gotten by doing that

[03-Oct-18 07:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree

[03-Oct-18 07:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
removed their stratum configs. applied and now fan is noisy to it's full possible noise

[03-Oct-18 07:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
😂

[03-Oct-18 07:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
