mine blocks, get coins, but sometimes, more coins.

sometimes the chain is reorged and you lose them

[30-Sep-18 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
sometimes you go to sleep, then the chain is forked and you mine coins that nobody wants

<insert ouch emote here>

[30-Sep-18 09:34 PM] wookie#7663
is mining verus with a single 1080ti get a profitable/reasonable return?

[30-Sep-18 09:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"reasonable" is a subjective term, whereas "profitable" is objective
The former is up to the individual and the latter would be a "yes".

[30-Sep-18 09:52 PM] wookie#7663
thanks! I'm only getting 0.5kmd/day for my 1ksol.

[30-Sep-18 09:53 PM] wookie#7663
I'll give it a try. anyone know whether ccminer is core or memory intensive?

[30-Sep-18 09:55 PM] IP#9768
@wookie both, but you would be better mining eth/etc with enlargement pill and buying kmd with that money

[30-Sep-18 09:56 PM] wookie#7663
thanks. I'll look into eth/etc. I tried enlargement pill, it didn't make any difference for me...maybe I wasn't using it right?

[30-Sep-18 10:35 PM] IP#9768
1080 ti should get around 50 mh/s with the pill

[30-Sep-18 10:35 PM] IP#9768
that is a lot of boost

[30-Sep-18 10:36 PM] IP#9768
idk if claymore added pill to new releases. borderline is you should get around 50mh from your 1080ti

[30-Sep-18 10:38 PM] wookie#7663
do you know what's 50mh in sols?

There isn’t a Mega Hash (thousands of hash per second) to Solutions (solutions per second) conversion. Ethereum uses Dagger Hashimoto algorithm, and Zcash uses Equihash algorithm, they are completely different.

Look up the Solutions/s rate based on your Card type: `https://en.m.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=ZCash_mining_GPU_Comparison&stable=0&redirect=no `
(For instance a Nvidia 1080ti gets an average of 650-680 Solutions per Second) then add up your Cards+Solutions and plug that number into:` https://whattomine.com/coins/166-zec-equihash?utf8=✓&hr=680&p=280&fee=0.0&cost=0.1&hcost=0.0&commit=Calculate`
`Then you can calculate your coins/profit per day for your rig.`

Using WhatToMine you can check, how profitable it is to mine selected altcoins in comparison to ethereum or bitcoin

[30-Sep-18 10:46 PM] IP#9768
50mh is 89 cents (not counting electriciy)

[30-Sep-18 10:46 PM] IP#9768
per day

[30-Sep-18 10:46 PM] IP#9768
kmd mining with 1080ti gives 27 cents per day (not counting electricity)

[30-Sep-18 10:46 PM] IP#9768
so i mean should be obvious

[30-Sep-18 11:25 PM] wookie#7663
ok, thanks!

m a newbie to all this mining stuff

[01-Oct-18 03:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
minis are easy, just fill in a few blanks and click "Apply" and youre mining

[01-Oct-18 04:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
nice

[01-Oct-18 04:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
has anyone have any experience with z9 ? not z9 mini

[01-Oct-18 04:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have not bought the power supply from antminer. someone suggested better to not and buy own

[01-Oct-18 04:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in the sense of basic use, z9 and z9 mini are the same

[01-Oct-18 04:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes I expect that. how about the power supplies ?

[01-Oct-18 04:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've used a bit of everything and in the end, a 6pin pcie is a 6pin pcie
As long as your PSU has enough wattage, it's all good

[01-Oct-18 04:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay 👍

[01-Oct-18 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have 2x 2450W PSUs here I could offload to someone with ASICs they are very noisy, but good efficiancy and power. 1 has 8 pin pice and one has no calbles, i was goign to make my own, but then mining turned not profitable so its all just gathering dust.

[01-Oct-18 04:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Are those the ones that are like 14 miles long?

Yeah, that's what I was afraid they were 😦

`Are those the ones that are like 14 miles long?` He's Australian... doesn't have a clue what a mile is 😉

[01-Oct-18 12:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Nobody is the civilized parts of the world knows what a mile is :trollface:

[01-Oct-18 02:36 PM] Zach#9973
What would be recommended to someone who has never mined before but is interested in possibly starting? budget would be about $800 max currently

[01-Oct-18 02:37 PM] IP#9768
@Zach just buy the coins

[01-Oct-18 02:37 PM] IP#9768
800$ would get you quite a lot of KMD right here and right now

[01-Oct-18 02:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if purpose is learning, then can spend those on Nicehash.

[01-Oct-18 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@bishop 1.60934 km

[01-Oct-18 02:40 PM] Zach#9973
@grewalsatinder so if I want to learn buy some hashing power and experiment, and if I was going for making money just buy the coins? @IP

[01-Oct-18 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And the usage of a "mile" as a distance predates "kilometer"  by about 2x :trollface:

[01-Oct-18 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
feken east and their fancy new math 🤦🏼

[01-Oct-18 07:50 PM] exploitURcoins#7419
whats the best pool for kmd

[01-Oct-18 07:54 PM] xRobeSx#5136
"best" is hard to define. If you want a smaller pool without a bunch of miners, you can join mine:  http://pool.komodo.services

[02-Oct-18 06:46 AM] exploitURcoins#7419
how much kmd your pool making a day ?

[02-Oct-18 06:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That depends on the hashrate of the miners

[02-Oct-18 06:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for any pool

[02-Oct-18 06:52 AM] exploitURcoins#7419
where do you mine sir ?

[02-Oct-18 06:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I solo mine

[02-Oct-18 06:53 AM] exploitURcoins#7419
oh you must own a farm?

[02-Oct-18 06:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
personally, I own about 560k Sol/s

[02-Oct-18 06:54 AM] exploitURcoins#7419
asic?

[02-Oct-18 06:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ya, ~585 if you count the GPUs

[02-Oct-18 06:54 AM] exploitURcoins#7419
ah

[02-Oct-18 06:55 AM] exploitURcoins#7419
nice

Another 200 in tariffs and 105 for power supply too

[02-Oct-18 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Only poor people pay tariffs :trollface:

[02-Oct-18 05:08 PM] exploitURcoins#7419
so is there any non asic pools for kmd

[02-Oct-18 05:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What is a "non asic pool"?

[02-Oct-18 05:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And why would anyone want one?

[02-Oct-18 05:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@exploitURcoins ?

[02-Oct-18 05:17 PM] exploitURcoins#7419
I dunno wouldn't be fair for asics to pool togeather and gpus do the same ?

[02-Oct-18 05:18 PM] exploitURcoins#7419
then gpus would still beable to get decent rewards?

[02-Oct-18 05:18 PM] exploitURcoins#7419
im new bare with me

[02-Oct-18 05:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"fair"? hash = hash
your percentage of the overall hash doesn't change based on who you pool with
in fact, you *want* ASICs in your pool if you want to get paid on a semi regular basis (20 1080TIs that are overclocked will only find 1 block every 3-5 days)

[02-Oct-18 05:21 PM] exploitURcoins#7419
um I was in a all gpu kmd pool and got me my best daily payout of any pool I have tried for kmd

[02-Oct-18 05:21 PM] exploitURcoins#7419
getting 3-5 kmd a day

[02-Oct-18 05:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Then I'd love to know what this pool is, because I've not seen any such happenings since batch 1 of minis arrived

[02-Oct-18 05:23 PM] exploitURcoins#7419
well this was awile ago when I first tried kmd  its been a long time

[02-Oct-18 05:24 PM] exploitURcoins#7419
didn't think it grew this much lol

[02-Oct-18 05:24 PM] exploitURcoins#7419
glad to see kmd doing things

[02-Oct-18 05:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, KMD diff is like 4x what it was a few weeks ago

[02-Oct-18 05:28 PM] exploitURcoins#7419
ouch bc new asics jumped on ?

[02-Oct-18 05:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[02-Oct-18 05:29 PM] exploitURcoins#7419
got ya  I was looking into fgpa

[02-Oct-18 05:29 PM] exploitURcoins#7419
they also make adapters for boosting gpus

[02-Oct-18 06:03 PM] chagidel#6952
any rekomendation on a kmd QT wallet ?

_picks ocean over agama 'every day and twice on Sundays'_

[02-Oct-18 06:11 PM] chagidel#6952
trying to set up solo mining and having problems with the agama  just hoping the qt will work

[02-Oct-18 06:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for mining, don't use a gui at all

[02-Oct-18 06:12 PM] chagidel#6952
need a node

[02-Oct-18 06:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, set up a node

[02-Oct-18 06:12 PM] chagidel#6952
agama as node ?

[02-Oct-18 06:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
gui and node are not exclusively interchangeable terms

[02-Oct-18 06:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Agama is a GUI that connects with the daemon, you don't need a GUI to mine (you need the daemon)
