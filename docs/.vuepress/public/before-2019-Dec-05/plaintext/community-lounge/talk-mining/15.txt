one miner connects gets shares looks good

[02-Jul-18 05:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
but those errors pop every block update and restarts stratum

[02-Jul-18 05:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
yup

[02-Jul-18 06:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
what is your .komodo/komodo.config?

[02-Jul-18 06:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
one sec

[02-Jul-18 06:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
here is the line from blockTemplate.js

[02-Jul-18 06:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
// generate the fees and coinbase tx
    var blockReward = (this.rpcData.miner) * 100000000;
    if (payFoundersReward === true) {
        if (!this.rpcData.founders || this.rpcData.founders.length <= 0) {
            console.log('Error, founders reward missing for block template!');
        } else {
            blockReward = (this.rpcData.miner + this.rpcData.founders) * 100000000;
        }
    }

[02-Jul-18 06:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
take out the blocknotify and see if that makes a difference

[02-Jul-18 06:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you use p2p, notify is almost always meaningless

[02-Jul-18 06:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
p2p disabled until i get the rest working

[02-Jul-18 06:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, enable it

[02-Jul-18 06:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`    "p2p": {
        "enabled": true,
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 7770,
        "disableTransactions": false
    }`

[02-Jul-18 06:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
is 7770 the default no config to set or I need to set that somewhere as well?

[02-Jul-18 06:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
you will need teh magic that I posted earlier

[02-Jul-18 06:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
7770 is default iirc

[02-Jul-18 06:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok ty ill check that shortly

[02-Jul-18 06:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
trying without the blocknotify first

[02-Jul-18 06:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
then ill add p2p

[02-Jul-18 06:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
p2p port *should be* rpc -1

[02-Jul-18 06:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not that it totally matters in this setting, but if you don't enable p2p, you'll be relying 100% on your `blockRefreshInterval`

[02-Jul-18 06:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, make sure that is set at a realistic number

[02-Jul-18 06:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_once did something stupid and set the blockRefreshInterval on a CHIPS stratum for 10 minutes 🤦🏿_

[02-Jul-18 07:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
"payFoundersReward": false

[02-Jul-18 07:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
you didnt have that in the json you posted...

[02-Jul-18 07:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
there might be some disparity in settings due to the only copy I have is way older, but since null = not 'true' there shouldn't be any need for it in kmd config

[02-Jul-18 07:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_hasn't use a downloaded stratum (other than to help someone test their stuff) for quite some time_

[02-Jul-18 07:47 PM] Alright#0419
```
{
    "name": "komodo",
    "symbol": "kmd",
    "algorithm": "equihash",
    "txfee": 0.00005
}
```
should work just fine

[02-Jul-18 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
are you able to do any RPC commands from the computer you're running z-nomp on?

[02-Jul-18 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
might want to start there

[02-Jul-18 09:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes i have full RPC access to mu komodod

[02-Jul-18 09:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
I am only getting erros in z-nomp now but hsraes are coming through

[02-Jul-18 09:07 PM] daemonfox#6136

thats the function causing all the commotion i just have no idea why

[02-Jul-18 09:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
when you look at the code, you have to go back further (in progression, not lines)
`undefined` basically means that the spot you keep looking at wasn't passed any actual variable

[02-Jul-18 11:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
can you limit how many threads z-nomp opens?

[02-Jul-18 11:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
I have 8c/16t and it opens 16 rpc threads everytime

[02-Jul-18 11:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
clustering.... forks
auto = 1 per core
any number = that many threads

[02-Jul-18 11:50 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@daemonfox did you fix your znomp

Got nomp all setup on my node, soloing atm

@bishop what guide did you follow

[03-Jul-18 01:45 AM] BlackJesus#6161
The zcash z-nomp? With komodo in the coins daemon folder opposed to zcash

[03-Jul-18 01:49 AM] bishop#9773
xrobes repo, komodo in the daemon folder

[03-Jul-18 01:49 AM] bishop#9773
Already got my first block 😄

[03-Jul-18 01:55 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Awesome

[03-Jul-18 01:56 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I need to stop being lazy and just sit down and set it up on my old mining rig (sold all the graphics cards it's bare bone) when my new Psu comes in.

[03-Jul-18 01:58 AM] bishop#9773
I figured I had a full node running already so why not setup a private pool for all my miners and maybe hit my luck with a massive block from rewards not being collected

[03-Jul-18 01:59 AM] BlackJesus#6161
That's my whole reason for buying z9's

[03-Jul-18 01:59 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Playing the lottery especially after block 1 million

[03-Jul-18 08:26 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@bishop what's your hash rate?

[03-Jul-18 10:46 AM] jansako#3330
Hi all, anyone knows what is the 'expected' number of blocks one can find with a z9 mini at this point? 
I mine on a pool (for now), it shows 'luckdays' for my miner around 0.7-0.8 or so on average. I read that as if I were to solo mine, I would get between 1-2 locks per day. 
The interesting part is that they pay out  8-9KMD/day, which is more like 2-3 blocks (looking at the avg block sizes). The 'pool luck' shows as average for that period too so it is not that the pool is finding more blocks than 'expected'.
One obvious conclusion is that the pool stats are 'skewed' to make you feel that you are getting paid more that if you were solo mine, but I am reluctant to jump to that.

Again, anyone solomining with a z9 mini, how many blocks do you get/day?

THX!

[03-Jul-18 10:47 AM] jansako#3330
I would appreciate a PM if you are reluctant to share publicly...

[03-Jul-18 10:50 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Extrapolating backwards from my increase, @jansako, I'd say 3-4 blocks per day "expected" per mini solo mining (influenced by luck and NN timings)

[03-Jul-18 10:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
however, it should always be noted that scale does have some impact on find rate

[03-Jul-18 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Unless it's a 0 fee pool, over time you'll always make less mining in a pool; how well you can, personally, cope with variance is highly individual

[03-Jul-18 10:54 AM] jansako#3330
Thank you!

[03-Jul-18 10:55 AM] jansako#3330
Yeah, we had that discussion. Is the pool fee more or less than the electricity used by the PC running your local stratum/VPS fee 😃

[03-Jul-18 10:56 AM] jansako#3330
Are you sharing the costs by running other stratums etc

[03-Jul-18 10:57 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
for the average person, the electricity used by the PC running your local stratum is less than the electricity used by the PC dealing with email and social media 😉

[03-Jul-18 12:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
@BlackJesus @Alright I have it up... down to a single thread

[03-Jul-18 12:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
not connecting any miners to it yet to see if the getblocktemplate error still happens
