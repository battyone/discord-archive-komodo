Next gen gpu cards will put lot of gpu miners (especially smal miners) out of the game..
So nvidea and amd are bad wolves too

[28-Jun-18 08:24 AM] Beetcoin#9049
No they won't, not even remotely

[28-Jun-18 08:25 AM] Beetcoin#9049
GDDR6 is not that much more impressive than GDDR5X from a computation standpoint

[28-Jun-18 08:25 AM] Beetcoin#9049
And we honestly don't know what we'll be running into, yet.

[28-Jun-18 08:25 AM] Beetcoin#9049
But there's very little doubt they will make a high end pascal card irrelevant.

[28-Jun-18 08:25 AM] Beetcoin#9049
rather, that they could make it irrelevant.

[28-Jun-18 08:26 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
If nvidea came up with a card that does 10k sol for 300watts.. then it would be accepted..?

[28-Jun-18 08:26 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Nvidia won't come out with a card that does 10k sol for 300 watts

[28-Jun-18 08:26 AM] Beetcoin#9049
They physically could not.

[28-Jun-18 08:27 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Its like mcdonalds not coming up with a cheeseburger and burger king does...

[28-Jun-18 08:27 AM] Beetcoin#9049
That's a horrible analogy.

[28-Jun-18 08:28 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Thing is.. many miners are profit driven and less ideologicly driven i guess..

[28-Jun-18 08:28 AM] Beetcoin#9049
And you know this because you know many miners?

[28-Jun-18 08:29 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Been talking in countless forums.. facebookgroups.. sellers.. rig hosting services etc...

[28-Jun-18 08:29 AM] Beetcoin#9049
I mean, I've mined KMD for the last few months, and they haven't been the most profitable.

[28-Jun-18 08:29 AM] Beetcoin#9049
So your assumption isn't true at least for myself.

[28-Jun-18 08:30 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Ive been mining the most profitable coins and sold them for kmd... giving me more kmd than i could mine it directly

[28-Jun-18 08:31 AM] Beetcoin#9049
So, you're not even taking into account your costs

[28-Jun-18 08:31 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Can mine like 5 to 6 kmd a day with my little rigs.. but mining etc or eth i can get 10 to 11 kmd a day :)

[28-Jun-18 08:31 AM] Beetcoin#9049
You must not have a very large operation.

[28-Jun-18 08:31 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Nope.. only 500mh

[28-Jun-18 08:31 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Or 6700sol

[28-Jun-18 08:31 AM] Beetcoin#9049
12ish cards or so?\

[28-Jun-18 08:31 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
18

[28-Jun-18 08:31 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Yikes

[28-Jun-18 08:31 AM] Beetcoin#9049
1060's?

[28-Jun-18 08:32 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Half of them yes.. other half 1070's

[28-Jun-18 08:32 AM] Beetcoin#9049
So you're even more affected than most by this change since you can't ethenlargement

[28-Jun-18 08:32 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Not going to get more rigs..actually want to sell one..

[28-Jun-18 08:33 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Heard about ethenlargement.. but what is it exactly?

[28-Jun-18 08:34 AM] Beetcoin#9049
A way to reorganize how the GDDR5X runs the algo, which increases ETH hashrates by about 40%

[28-Jun-18 08:34 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Increasing hashrate on 1080ti

[28-Jun-18 08:34 AM] Beetcoin#9049
1080 as well

[28-Jun-18 08:34 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Cool.. same elec consumption?

[28-Jun-18 08:35 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Essentially

[28-Jun-18 08:35 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Some have seen an increase of up to 2% consumption

[28-Jun-18 08:35 AM] Beetcoin#9049
otherwise marginal

[28-Jun-18 08:35 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Could be misreported

[28-Jun-18 08:36 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Sounds nice!
Hmm.. maybe selling all my rigs and getting the 1080's if they are more efficient ..

[28-Jun-18 08:36 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Will look into this.

[28-Jun-18 08:36 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Might as well pick up cheap AMD cards instead, ROI times are lower, and since the major Equihash coins wont' be forking, Nvidia's are kind of hurting right now.

[28-Jun-18 08:38 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Need highest efficient cards.. elec cost here is 0.3$/kwh... basically bs to get mining at all üòÇ

[28-Jun-18 08:38 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Oh god, you can't even profit righ tnow

[28-Jun-18 08:38 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
But i pay from pocket not from coins i mined

[28-Jun-18 08:38 AM] Beetcoin#9049
I just ran a sim on the top 50ish mineable coins for the reddit guys and about $.27c/kwh was the cutoff for profitability, unless you strictly mined eth

[28-Jun-18 08:38 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Well.. not profit business intended.
More as enthousiast interested.

[28-Jun-18 08:39 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
It was good in december! üòÅ ..

[28-Jun-18 08:39 AM] Beetcoin#9049
It was great until last month

[28-Jun-18 08:40 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
If no better hardware comes up.. i will get into masternodes and just buying coins..

[28-Jun-18 08:40 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Was fun for a while.. got very much into crypto's and learned something.

[28-Jun-18 08:41 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Till i move to lowest elec rates part of the world.. maybe canada..

[28-Jun-18 08:42 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Throwing a cable to the output of a hydrodam.. mining hidden in a cave...

[28-Jun-18 10:08 AM] jansako#3330
@Beetcoin  Your question: "WHY KMD would allow for the support of asics. I think that's the real big question mark for most GPU miners."

I think you may have it backwards. ASICS were made to mine the Equihash algo, it was NOT KMD that was built to support ASICS. 
KMD did not change to allow or disallow asics. I am not pro or contra asics, I have a bit of both GPU's and Asics, they are simply tools for different jobs.  
I realize that can be taken as semantics, but my main point is that KMD is NOT made for miners, GPU or otherwise. 

The way I understood jl's vision form the start, KMD is a utility coin, it's value comes from being used by various parts of the ecosystem, and mining is meant to be a very small part of that. That is one of the reasons for the dPOW and 75% of the blocks mined by notaries. Miners are expected to have much less say in KMD than for example companies that are/will be  building on top of it. (see the 'Ecosystem' list on the sidebar). Right now that ecosystem is only just starting, but I for one am happy that it is finally taking off.

[28-Jun-18 10:18 AM] jansako#3330
Thanks!

[28-Jun-18 10:40 AM] Beetcoin#9049
@jansako you can't make the argument that KMD Is neutral in the For .vs Against ASIC debate. KMD is on Equihash, Equihash was built for the very purpose of remaining ASIC resistant. Here's a little brush up from the Wikipedia. "Equihash was introduced at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium 2016 in San Diego. The cryptocurrency ZCash integrated Equihash in April 2016, for reasons such as security, privacy, and ASIC miner resistance. Bitcoin Magazine notes, "According to the CryptoLUX scientists, the algorithm permits avoiding centralization of the mining process in the hands of a few first-class miners with specialized mining hardware, thus contributing to the ‚Äúdemocratization‚Äù of digital currencies based on Equihash."[3]". You'll note the part where it specifically states that the purpose of Equihash was to avoid centralization in the mining process to t hose with specialized hardware.  You'll also note the following from the same Wikipedia article "Equihash is now considered broken in the sense of purpose. The manufacturer Bitmain has succeeded in optimizing the processing of the algorithm with an ASIC. This makes the use of graphics cards too expensive.[4]".

[28-Jun-18 10:40 AM] Beetcoin#9049
You'll also note that KMD uses a paragraph citing Satoshi's vision, whom you'll remember coined the phrase 1 cpu 1 vote. KMD is not Zcash, and certainly have the ability to fork away from asics without damaging their own eco system, but they have not. Instead, the decision is to make no decision. Sitting on your hands is not something Satoshi would have done, certainly isn't something KMD should be doing, and it really draws attention to the fact that a deal might have struck under the table with Bitmain NOT to fork the coin so they can sell their asics, or, that the team themselves own asics and for the sake of their own greed, do not wish to fork. That answer, honestly, would be a much more appreciated answer than "mining only accounts for 25% of the network, it wont' matter, we'll do nothing", which is a huge middle finger to the miners.

[28-Jun-18 10:47 AM] jansako#3330
There can be an ASIC made for any algo, and someone else would need to answer if the asic-resistance was even a factor when Equihash was chosen for KMD.  If it was not, there is no argument  to be made.
The KMD team making a deal with Bitmain? Please.. now you are going too far.

[28-Jun-18 10:47 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@xRobeSx is your guide still relevant? https://github.com/xRobeSx/kmd-nomp. Or should I be following the how to here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/ whilst using the https://github.com/z-classic/z-nomp ?

Going too far? It isn't an unreasonable assessment

[28-Jun-18 10:48 AM] jansako#3330
yeah, it is... looking at the marketcap & how much asics are being sold

[28-Jun-18 10:48 AM] Beetcoin#9049
They have offered up little support for their indecision, and have avoided protest to the matter, instead trying to marginalize those who do protest as only accounting for 25% of their network

[28-Jun-18 10:48 AM] jansako#3330
anyway, time for a workout, later folks!

[28-Jun-18 10:49 AM] Beetcoin#9049
And you're right, an ASIC can be made for any algo, which is why you fork the algo and keep the mining power as decentralized as possible.

[28-Jun-18 10:49 AM] Beetcoin#9049
As Zcash stated and had done from the beginning.

[28-Jun-18 10:49 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Now effectively giving up on the algorithm all together.

[28-Jun-18 10:50 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Almost ironic that two of the biggest Equihash coins, and the only two in the top 5 who weren't attacked by Bitmain through Nicehash, both aren't forking.

[28-Jun-18 10:50 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Easy to draw connections.

[28-Jun-18 10:51 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Honestly, you're probably the only person to even consider it a problem on this discord channel thus far. Not saying that replicates the views of all KMD miners, but it sure would be a large percentage of the ones who are actually invested in the coin, not just mining it on a for profit basis.

[28-Jun-18 10:51 AM] Beetcoin#9049
You should see my inbox if you truly believe that.

[28-Jun-18 10:51 AM] Beetcoin#9049
From what I gather, from my inbox, anti-asic sentiment here isn't all that tolerated or desired.

[28-Jun-18 10:52 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Why hasn't there been more discussion on this forum then?

You can‚Äôt argue with him or jl777 they both love ASICS.

[28-Jun-18 10:53 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Today at 2:53 AM
I argue with computergenie all the time in safecoin chat, because they forked to 144,5 and he has a farm of ASICS and isn‚Äôt happy that we forked to look after the community and the little guy.  It seems any coin not forking right now comes into 2 categories, they either got paid to not fork, or they bought a load of z9s for themselves and are mining it until it earns less than a gpu does right now and then fork hoping to win back their communities. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few - this statement should be imprinted on everyone‚Äôs head who runs a coin and bends over for ASICS.
What they will find out tho, is by not forking they lose their community which helped build the coin, and when they need help or support and look around there will be an empty space.

[28-Jun-18 10:54 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Two different users at almost the same time after I posted my critique

[28-Jun-18 10:54 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm all for constructive discussions, but when one person comes here and claims the KMD team have 'struck [an] under the table [deal] with Bitmain not to fork the coin'. That's pretty outlandish.

[28-Jun-18 10:54 AM] Beetcoin#9049
And again, I'm not so much standing against the idea of not forking, I'm just looking for a more...........solid reasoning for not doing so.

[28-Jun-18 10:54 AM] Beetcoin#9049
It isn't all that outlandish to be honest

[28-Jun-18 10:54 AM] Beetcoin#9049

@Beetcoin tell the name removed dumbass that they don't know wtf they are talking about

[28-Jun-18 10:55 AM] Beetcoin#9049
I'm sure they'll read your commentary here.

[28-Jun-18 10:56 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
my "farm" of ASICs is feken 3, 2 of which just got delivered less than 12 hrs ago

[28-Jun-18 10:56 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and my ASICs are still less hash than my GPUs

[28-Jun-18 10:56 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Then you'd want to support the anti-asic core of Equihash

[28-Jun-18 10:57 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
no

[28-Jun-18 10:57 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Otherwise your GPUs will continue to be rendered useless, unless you're moved on from Equihash

[28-Jun-18 10:58 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I have no issues with evolving my setup and then using my GPUs for distributed computing

I'm also an adult, and I'm emotionally attached towards making that investment continue to be an investment.

[28-Jun-18 10:59 AM] Beetcoin#9049
Your commentary also has nothing to do with the point at hand.

[28-Jun-18 11:01 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
The point where your investments are emotional attachments should end with your home, vehicle, and education.
No rational adult is emotionally attached to a hunk of equipment used for the creation of currency

Where are you getting the emotional attachment from, by the way?
