Good article on Stablecoins:

"The final two challenges facing all stablecoins (most of which haven‚Äôt launched yet) are scalability and privacy. Global digital cash must be fast, cheap, and private. That can only occur if the platform it is built upon can scale. It must also be private, for both philosophical and practical reasons. A decentralized stablecoin could never serve as global, digital cash without some guarantee of privacy."

If anybody is interested in the Bitcoin ATM industry, I have a lot of knowledge about running them, and looking for people that want my tech skills. I want to be completely buffered from all the non-tech side of stuff :abusedsmily:

[17-Sep-19 02:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
It's under $5K USD to buy a brand new ATM and they break even relatively fast, if put in the right location

[19-Sep-19 03:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's the best ATM for supporting any coin you want. The code is there, you can add a random new smart chain if you want

[26-Sep-19 06:22 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I think a browser is one of the best things for mass adoption. And as Brave has a wallet for certain cryptos, a fork could have its own coins like, KMD etc. Then I don't know how it works for regulations, if they would be forced to do KYC like Brave.
They say it's to prevent fraud. And it's true that if you have a system of rewards many people will try to cheat, but there are better and safer ways to verify without people giving their real name, documents etc

i couldn't find a proper category for this but this is our project and wanted to share it. we would like to get funded and complete it if community approves and loves project.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/11x7gpfeDEnUEgnc4uPgVH0Ka3XtPHuYfTB2XDWYgWwc/edit?usp=sharing

here is our demo for "Bitrophone" project. Due to lack of sources we couldn't enable/create some features & get cloud servers, mail servers & licensing protocols for song uploads and payment screen... If we get funded for project we will use funding to get them and upgrade the website in future. But i think we created a cool thing as a demo version in less then a month with just 2 people. Also our admin panel, which you won't be able to see in this demo is almost ready. I wanted to mail you with a demo, now at least we got something to show & upgrade. We are still at %20 completion of being %100 ready for service.

In this demo you can see how will our music distribution service work, 
song upload panels(disabled uploads but works on backend. we don't have cloud :D), 
payment methods(we didn't enable credit card and kmd payments, only website credits are usable to purchase in demo),
Released albums,
Subscription timings,
Upgradable plans for different type of musicians & labels.

@Seadox @Gordon Komodo 
Where traditional business models may just have subscriptions, using cryptocurrencies, especially the komodo ecosystem #cc-pegs #cc-prices related tech in the upcoming years would enable a new business model.

For example, if an artist needs automated redistribution service & they are paying $20/month, in this type of business the platform could offer to invest 50% of the subscription fee into a peg fund and other type of algorithmic trading and derivative market.  Any profits from such diversification of income stream can be used to offset future monthly payments for the artist, or for the investor an added opportunity to get knock-on effects of this type of investment.

If music royalties exist, then as they are accumulated over quarters or 6-month intervals, the same could be diverted into a fund of kinds.

These income streams can all pour into kmd network services - doesn‚Äôt have to be specific to music platforms.   Just an idea that popped up middle of the night on how this platform can be used.

The same applies to location data and services like ‚Äúdog walking uber‚Äù (wag app), where certain locations that are popular with dog ownership, the civic Centre has an opportunity to get development for the local environment, like dog park allotment, or safe drinking water fountains & the like.

[02-Oct-19 08:28 AM] Seadox#5412
Great ideas. I was also thinking licensing songs on blockchain is also a use case. But problem is a music company costs money unlike the wallet applications. It needs more funding, time & effort than other projects. But when it gets live, brings great roi.

But at least they are not asking people to send copies of documents which is unsafe (or do awful webcam verifications)

[03-Oct-19 08:57 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
***
This is what Indacoin (https://indacoin.com) ask:
"To complete verification you‚Äôll need to enter the 4 digit code you receive via phone call. For your second step you may also be asked to undergo photo verification, which requires you to upload a photo of your passport/ID and a selfie with ID and a piece of paper with required text, confirming the purchase. We may alternatively ask for video verification, where you will need to record your face, say "Indacoin verification for crypto" show your ID and card you made the payment with. When showing the card, show only last 4 digits and the name."

[03-Oct-19 02:41 PM] h311m4n000#0547
I'm a bity user. You can use it without KYC with a limit of 4000CHF a year (buy and sell) last time I checked. If you want to be able to up your limit, you will have to KYC. 

Bity also operate a network of BTC/ETH ATMs in all major Swiss cities with a daily limit of 5000CHF I believe. You need 0 KYC for this...
