There was a request to create a dedicated channel for topis like regulations, tax issues, starting a business, entrepreneurship in blockchain, and things like that.

[04-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Audo#5667
In other words, a channel for all the people & teams who will help to build a Komodo ecosystem üòÉ

[04-Jun-19 11:26 AM] Mylo#8306
hi @Crabby Paddy channel got setup because of some business related questions - like company formations, residency, tax etc.

[04-Jun-19 01:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
this seems cool

[04-Jun-19 01:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
this is necessary

[04-Jun-19 02:55 PM] eclips#1570
what's your way to cash out mining revenues (or crypto revenues in general) ?

[04-Jun-19 02:55 PM] eclips#1570
here, still use wirex

[04-Jun-19 03:25 PM] mrlynch#5735
otc, shifting to biz

[04-Jun-19 03:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
any non-kyc or upto xxx limit non-kyc exchange

coinbase is a necessary evil in my life. they deposit to my bank almost instantly now though, which is nice.

[04-Jun-19 06:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
has anyone used bisq?

[04-Jun-19 07:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
care to elaborate?

[04-Jun-19 07:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
that's ok

[04-Jun-19 10:58 PM] allbits#5898
I've used bisq for a siafund/btc trade and I did not need any daemons running locally

[04-Jun-19 10:58 PM] allbits#5898
And it was smooth, worked as expected

[05-Jun-19 04:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
@eclips what is your experience with wirex? I think they are expanding to the US soon

I've just finished compiling a content breakdown for Komodo on Crypto Hedgehog, and I was hoping to get some feedback on the write-up.

All of the sources are pretty much from the Komodo site or documentation, and it covers a condensed version of the history, how it works, the products, and some security / technical info. If anyone spots anything that‚Äôs missing / wrong / should be elaborated on / etc., I‚Äôd really appreciate it üò¨

[07-Jun-19 07:38 PM] gcharang#6833
@InfiniteSumLtd thanks for the write up, someone from the team will go through it, and get in touch with you
but it might take some time because we are all busy now
can you ping us a week later if we don't get back to you?

[07-Jun-19 07:40 PM] InfiniteSumLtd#9498
No worries. I figured everyone was busy handling the Agama issues

@InfiniteSumLtd yeah we'll have to go through card by card.   lots of updates in the next month which will make your site look outdated & team page is different to current.

[08-Jun-19 05:31 AM] Mylo#8306
plenty of info there, which is great - site didn't fully load , every 2nd card is blank.  vids are cool.

[08-Jun-19 05:39 AM] InfiniteSumLtd#9498
Thanks for taking a look @Mylo.  I figured we'd have to update things again with the new releases, so no worries there. I was just trying to make sure that the basic foundation is there, and that we weren't missing anything glaring.

[08-Jun-19 05:39 AM] InfiniteSumLtd#9498
The blank cards thing is a little weird though...they all load up on my end, so I'm not sure what the error might be.

[08-Jun-19 06:53 AM] Mylo#8306
Firefox maybe.  If you have flex in css it can be a bit weird

[08-Jun-19 06:56 AM] InfiniteSumLtd#9498
Yup. That's it. Just booted up firefox and I'm seeing the same thing.

[08-Jun-19 06:58 AM] InfiniteSumLtd#9498
It works in Brave, Chrome, and Safari, so I'll dive in this weekend to see if I can fix that.

[08-Jun-19 06:58 AM] InfiniteSumLtd#9498
Thanks @Mylo

[08-Jun-19 07:11 AM] Mylo#8306

I need to fork a sidechain repo

[08-Jun-19 01:14 PM] gcharang#6833
@Artemis there in no seperate sidechain repo
there is the komodo repo which has all the sidechain (we call them assetchains here) functionality

Is there any resource that lists the strategic (or non-strategic) partnerships announced by Komodo?

I‚Äôd like to populate the Crypto Hedgehog KMD Business page with partners, and I know some of them have been announced on the blog...I was just hoping to find a definitive / exhaustive list to make sure I don‚Äôt miss any.

[11-Jun-19 01:54 AM] Mylo#8306
There‚Äôs a lot not covered.  They are all informal or formal.  They are generally not public because each dev, team member, notary node operates independently and not representative of solely kmd.

There is a formal kmd partner program in the works.

[14-Jun-19 06:47 PM] phm87#7395
@metaphilibert as I suggested IRL to reduce your taxes in Be, if your company is less than 1 year old and if you were in phisical person before, you can do the goodwheel to reduce taxes of about 10%

[14-Jun-19 06:47 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Too late for me, had to do it 9 years ago lol

[14-Jun-19 06:48 PM] metaphilibert#0926
But indeed good advice

[14-Jun-19 06:48 PM] phm87#7395
If you have/own other companies in Europe, you can invoice your belgian company. Do not be too hard with amounts to avoid pbs

[14-Jun-19 06:49 PM] phm87#7395
International accountant in Europe is about 5k to 10k. Then 1k to 5k per year. I heard it is worth it (guy in fr who have companies in uk, lux ...)

[14-Jun-19 06:52 PM] phm87#7395
There are other tricks that are not forbidden yet (bc govt is slow) as example to play with physical person and company stuff (administrative work but we can gain few %).

[14-Jun-19 08:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
5k for an accountant per year what

[14-Jun-19 08:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I pay mine 2.5k total or so in BE. Management company so not that many outgoing/ingoing invoices. For the other ones that have something like 1k ingoing/outgoing docs I pay around 1000/month allin

[14-Jun-19 08:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Lots of optimisations possible in BE üòÉ

[14-Jun-19 08:29 PM] phm87#7395
In Be, I paid mine about 600-700‚Ç¨ per year when I was in physical person. Now that I have a company it should be 1.2k per year

[14-Jun-19 08:30 PM] phm87#7395
@Cryptoon  I didn't know you were also belgian ^^ that's cool üáßüá™

[14-Jun-19 08:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Quarterly VAT calculations make an enterprise accountant more expensive üò¶

[14-Jun-19 08:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
GCV or BVBA?

[14-Jun-19 08:31 PM] phm87#7395
I work in Brussels as freelance but I signed with a luxemburgish company so we are doing autoregulation (no VAT on the bill and VAT is paid in Lux)

[14-Jun-19 08:31 PM] phm87#7395
I am now in BVBA

[14-Jun-19 08:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[14-Jun-19 08:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah hmm livraison intracommunautaire?

[14-Jun-19 08:32 PM] phm87#7395
yeah somethings like this but for services

[14-Jun-19 08:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Protip: if you order stuff on coolblue, and enter your VAT details, you can get anything delivered without VAT

[14-Jun-19 08:33 PM] phm87#7395
yeah but I prefer to pay VAT then the state gives me back the money (I was in autoregulation during 2 years when I worked in Lux and paid taxes in Be)

[14-Jun-19 08:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
LIC is the legal term, doesnt matter what you sell services/goods/... just means you dont need to charge vat for sales cross borders

@jorian  as I want to do some tax load balancing, in what country is estoblished Chainmakers ? US ?

[14-Jun-19 08:36 PM] phm87#7395
NL maybe ?

[14-Jun-19 08:36 PM] jorian#4555
officially in puerto rico

Better tax system and easy to do because siu lives there I think?

[14-Jun-19 08:38 PM] jorian#4555
siu lives there, and puerto rico is a crypto paradise

[14-Jun-19 08:39 PM] jorian#4555
it's part of US but it has a tax exemption

[14-Jun-19 08:39 PM] jorian#4555
so living in PR is worth it

[14-Jun-19 08:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway, a good accountant can cost you some money, but it can save you a loooot more üòÉ

[14-Jun-19 08:48 PM] phm87#7395
my belgian accountant doesn't want to discuss about international stuff : only belgian law. But I think that in crypto-sphere, enhance this can be easier

[14-Jun-19 08:49 PM] phm87#7395
I'll google a little bit and discuss later. Thanks you guys

[14-Jun-19 08:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I remember talking to someone about crypto accountants in france back in the day on slack

[14-Jun-19 08:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont remember who it was, maybe webworker...

[14-Jun-19 08:54 PM] phm87#7395
I discuss regularly on the cryptofr slack

[14-Jun-19 08:54 PM] phm87#7395
and I met webworker twice (once in Be at a meetup in Liege and once at Breaking Bitcoin in Amsterdam few days ago)

[14-Jun-19 08:55 PM] phm87#7395
