In my readings, `Users of Virtual Currency` in the latter applies

`FinCEN doesn't matter here, IRS matters`
True, but what I'm saying is that the IRS's official stance is that the FinCEN doc is their basis and as such if FinCEN says it doesn't apply then the IRS can't say that it does if the IRS says that FinCEN is their guide (logically at least)

[12-Jul-19 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
From the IRS:``` For a more comprehensive description of convertible virtual currencies to date, see Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Guidance on the Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies (FIN-2013-G001, March 18, 2013).  ```

[12-Jul-19 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure how a conversion service like BitPay stands in the mix
I thought you meant actually using for currency

[12-Jul-19 01:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Chances are likely that BitPay would be seen as the same action as trading on a CEX

[12-Jul-19 01:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's basically the same in my eyes too 😛

[12-Jul-19 01:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, when you think of the steps, BitPay is the same as an exchange and withdraw to your bank and the difference is you designate a receiver per instance rather than a constant

💯 

[12-Jul-19 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, the long to get to answer is: yes, you probably need to document each instance and pay property tax on it

Any suggestions on how to monetise a site without compromising on privacy?

Do you know of any forms of ethical advertising/affiliates where people are not tracked with cookies across the web? 
I read that it's possible...in the sense that if they buy something from a totally unique link given to you, that's what tells the seller the buyer comes from you.

 The other common method is more effective, they usually use an ID that is in a cookie and it tracks visitors, but I don't want to use it - the whole site is focused on Privacy tech so it wouldn't be right.

My other idea is to integrate a form of crypto exchange, maybe something like what sideshift.ai offer to their partners

Would like to also make a utility coin with optional Z-addresses that members can use to pay for premium listings/special features and receive a discount if they use it.

[31-Jul-19 07:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
optional privacy is basically no privacy at all

[31-Jul-19 07:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@D2D privacyalternatives.com

[31-Jul-19 07:36 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Even the way Hush and Verus do it?

[31-Jul-19 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
USSA will be running nodes for all the major coins, ip sniffing and detecting what node creates the transaction

[31-Jul-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
staying private against a state level actor becomes quite difficult

[31-Jul-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
you would need something like ARRR

[31-Jul-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
HUSH and VRSC will achieve corporate level privacy, but surrounded by taddr and all entry/exit to the chain monitored.... maybe its possible to stay private, but maybe not against a full scale surveillance state

{Reactions}
👆 

[31-Jul-19 07:49 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Yes also from what I've been reading, ARRR is the only true privacy coin

[31-Jul-19 07:50 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Isn't there a risk they might ban coins with z-only addresses?

[31-Jul-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so?

[31-Jul-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
many things are banned, but if it is something people really need, it survives

[31-Jul-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
atomicDEX doesnt need any approvals, it is in a regulatory safe-harbor according to recent guidance

[31-Jul-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
i think ussa tried to ban many things, but the only bans that worked were things that were centralized in nature where they could exert control on a small group of people

{Reactions}
👍 

[31-Jul-19 07:55 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
But why did Hush and VRSC choose optional z-addresses instead of z-only addresses?

[31-Jul-19 07:58 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
And KMD doesn't have z-address anymore now

[31-Jul-19 08:03 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
It's good to hear that atomicDEX is in a regulatory safe-harbor

[31-Jul-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
going zaddr only means you cant really do anything else that transactions and store of value

[31-Jul-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
and even simple things like exchange integration become major ordeals and mobile is maybe not even possible without great contortions

[31-Jul-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is the ultimate in privacy, but that is the only thing it can do

[31-Jul-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe in the landscape of thousands of coins that cant do anything else either, PIRATE is their equal in functionality, but the next wave of alt season we will see many alts with enhanced capabilities and the vanilla forks that are not already firmly established wont have any chance

[31-Jul-19 08:12 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Yes that's what I thought and why I suggested making a z-optional coin if I do create one to go with the website.
ARRR already does full privacy very well

About AtomicDEX, it says this on the site (bottom of the homepage, under "Partner with Us"):
"integrate atomic swaps and let your users trade right from your app"

[31-Jul-19 08:15 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
is that just for mobile apps, or could a website also integrate it?

[31-Jul-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure, but i think for now it is mobile only, with website later

[31-Jul-19 08:17 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
OK

[31-Jul-19 08:19 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
If it's ok to ask, did AtomicDEX base the business in a specific country to be able to be compliant and stay in a safe-harbor?

[31-Jul-19 08:20 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
A crypto-friendly country like Georgia for example

[31-Jul-19 08:21 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Because where you base the business must also make a big difference with all the new regulations coming

[31-Jul-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no location

[31-Jul-19 08:24 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667

Thanks, yes I thought about it as a good option and almost completed their registration. But despite being a privacy search engine, they do want your full name when registering for that, so not sure yet. I also didn't like the fact that during the registration they say "just confirm" your email. Then after you do that they say one last thing....your name...not very transparent

@D2D privacyalternatives.com one of the the biggest no no's I have about brave its chromium based hence its a Google product not directly but indirectly. I cannot for the life of me understand why they did not fork Firefox if brave what to be for privacy.

[01-Aug-19 08:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Thought brave was made by one of the guys from mozilla

[01-Aug-19 08:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
assumed they forked ff

[01-Aug-19 08:19 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
But from what I understand, there shouldn't be any link between the two, Google doesn't get any data from Chrome just because they are using the Chromium code.
I think technically by default Brave is the best for privacy (no telemetry, while Firefox has that). But if you understand the settings you can make Firefox super-private

[01-Aug-19 08:20 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667

About a year or so ago Brave had lots of bugs, but now it works very well, also the separate identities you can create, to browse different things and keep cookies/logins separate is great

[01-Aug-19 08:31 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I do like it

[01-Aug-19 08:34 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
But I think his choice of asking for KYC to pay the Brave rewards (for watching ads) is an awful choice

[01-Aug-19 08:35 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I mean, a browser knows almost more about you than yourself

[01-Aug-19 08:35 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
They should never ever ask for KYC

[01-Aug-19 09:21 AM] hastrup#8742
@D2D privacyalternatives.com but if you are using Chromium base you are also supporting chromium development hence you are supporting Google. Like you said you can make ff very secure and remove telemetry if you want. So why did brave now do that? Because a personal issue whit ff? Idk it's hard to find the perfect solution. I just want to not use Google related products that's why I'm using Firefox. (while sitting here using Android, fuck me right!)

[01-Aug-19 09:25 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
ahah...it's hard to stay away from Google, they are everywhere

[01-Aug-19 09:25 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I think there's a better ethos behind Mozilla and Firefox

[01-Aug-19 09:26 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667

@Deleted User can you point me to a place where I can read and understand why Firefox is bad architecture compared to chromium. In my mind the solution is not all browser is based on chromium. And that why Firefox is needed for the space.

[01-Aug-19 01:02 PM] hastrup#8742
@Deleted User well that is not very promising for the future of browsers and free net. Thx for the insight!

[01-Aug-19 05:18 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Another thing is that not too long ago Firefox had a bug that suddenly deactivated thousands of addons. And these extra plugins are used for everything now, even as VPNs...so that was quite bad. And when I use Firefox  on Mac it's quite heavy for it and the fans start hyperventilating

"Why not use the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency?
We're excited about about the new possibilities these technologies are creating, and we'd love to explore how they could help us achieve our goals. But just like we won't wait for self-driving cars to become ubiquitous before calling a Lyft, we're very practical about using existing services to solve problems right now. We can already get pretty far using well-established technologies already integrated with global systems. That said, we are actively exploring how to support cryptocurrency on the platform, so if you're interested in that, get in in touch."
