A bit of research about Cloudlfare, which will be also used by Firefox to increase privacy:

lol, Cloudflare is well known for their anti-Tor policy... now they want to increase privacy? They only need to stop blocking tor users, job done üôÇ

yes, very annoying... and i saw sites that are not even implementing it right... site is loading, but elements are missing
and if you use the developer tools of the browser you can see why: every request to those elements that don't show up get a 403 (unauthorized) and they are asking for the captcha stuff, but that is not visible on the main site, only in the developer tools
would love to see Google charging 1$ for each request to their captchas, then this will stop for sure üôÇ

@xeonrider have you already created your dApp on ethereum?

[05-Oct-19 03:01 AM] Mylo#8306
if so, what token functions do you need?
build it on KMDICE, it gets dPoW already.   If it gets popular, the community will no doubt help you pay for dpow on it's own chain.

[05-Oct-19 12:23 PM] xeonrider#3120
@Mylo is it a fork or something like Verus?

[05-Oct-19 02:39 PM] gcharang#6833
@xeonrider it is a smartchain

@xeonrider yes it's a smartchain.   if you sync it with 
```
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/blob/master/src/assetchains.old#L44
```
that command will start it, once synced, 
```
https://github.com/Komodo-Cakeshop/komodo-in-a-box/blob/master/setup/cc/tokens.sh#L37
```
üëÜ will list the tokens created on KMDICE with your rpcuser/pass/port

and then getting info about a specific token created  it can be done with 
```
https://github.com/Komodo-Cakeshop/komodo-in-a-box/blob/master/setup/cc/tokens.sh#L76
```
using the token id.

[07-Oct-19 04:25 AM] Mylo#8306
there is a docker tutorial for this stuff, https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-tutorials/beginner-series-part-4.html#conceptualizing-tokens

It builds on webmonetization (& other, but webmonetization is prioritized) APIs in-browser for grants.

[07-Oct-19 05:44 AM] Mylo#8306
At the moment a lot of this seems to be tied to ILP protocol - if anyone is interested in building an ILP connector for the komodo ecosystem, might be a good place to get funding for it.

wow

[07-Oct-19 07:46 AM] xeonrider#3120
@Mylo you also do the pangea front end? (poker game?)

[07-Oct-19 07:48 AM] Mylo#8306
Not me.  I haven‚Äôt been full-time dev for 10+ years.  I only do basic stuff these days üôÇ

[07-Oct-19 07:48 AM] xeonrider#3120
oh, just saw that the repo had like a front end for pangea with API calls

[07-Oct-19 07:48 AM] xeonrider#3120
because that would have been perfect

[07-Oct-19 07:49 AM] xeonrider#3120
so cakeshop is not yours?

[07-Oct-19 07:49 AM] Mylo#8306
Check the CHIPS discord for Pangea.
Yes cakeshop is some vuetifyjs stuff I did earlier this year

[07-Oct-19 07:50 AM] xeonrider#3120
yes, I am in there - I was planning a blackjack game, but then I saw chips. However, not a lot of documented resources but it looks pretty awesome.

[07-Oct-19 07:51 AM] xeonrider#3120
@Mylo oh cool, so there is already a web socket API ?

[07-Oct-19 07:52 AM] Mylo#8306
CHIPS will get easier to deploy in coming weeks.  Everything is accessible HTTP RPC.  CHIPS has websocketapi but i don‚Äôt know much about it

[07-Oct-19 07:52 AM] xeonrider#3120
I prefer to use unity (webgl, linux native) for my gamedev, web requests are awesome if they already work

[07-Oct-19 07:53 AM] xeonrider#3120
vue is cool üòÑ

[07-Oct-19 07:54 AM] xeonrider#3120
are you a webdev?

[07-Oct-19 08:06 AM] Mylo#8306
Not a pro dev.  Not a full time dev.  When I was younger i could code a bit in c++/java.  Web components are very useful.   Web is useful, and the javascript ecosystem is handy for prototypes but for production-level code, I‚Äôm not your man :)

There is a gaming-SDK currently being worked on.

If you‚Äôre going to make blackjack or any multiplayer gambling games, the CHIPS project is better for microtransactions between groups because of the network model of games (small groups of people).

If you‚Äôre going to build a platformer or rogue-like game, then using komodo and it‚Äôs token system will work for you.  All the calls are available by http RPC (not rest).   From a browser there is CORS limitation.   From standalone programs, no problem.

If you were to grab a game template from the unity asset store, adding token calls would be pretty trivial.

A lightweight P2P daemon is in development - this will likely replace needing to run a full node for taking advantage of the antara framework (application smarts on blockchain)

[07-Oct-19 08:09 AM] Mylo#8306
Seeing as you said you know ethereum, basically the lightweight nSPV daemon has all the functions of something like infura, but distributable in a small bundle (4MB memory, 500kB executable C code)
