Have you guys ever thought about moving to Malta?

[15-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Just for hodling crypto, belgium is quite ok... when hodling as long term investment no taxes due iirc

[15-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
When speculating short term it‚Äôs considered a job income and taxes are due

i read many countries give you citizenship if you buy expensive real estate

[15-Jun-19 08:04 PM] actionslacks#4072
when you consider that the price likely includes a nice piece of property it doesn't seem like that bad of a deal.

[15-Jun-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it seems you can make a list of countries you wouldnt mind living in. then see if they have a decent citizenship via real estate program. a lot of the EU countries are very desperate for funds, i think spain, portugal, cyprus, all vacation type of countries with decent deals

[15-Jun-19 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
lots of island countries do the same, but maybe it gets boring in such small places over time

I have found in shopping for visa's its more important to consider their visa treaties, and taxation secondarily. Once you are outside USA tax jurisdiction - ie have renounced your citizenship - numerous (legal) tax avoidance options become available. Besides - even retaining us citizenship the right foundations and trusts can shield 100% of tax liability

[26-Jun-19 05:26 PM] G888#0307
visa treaties - for those not familiar - are more important for non-eu countries, like carribean islands. St Kitts for example has strong visa treaties (travel rights with other nations)

Isnt PR a special case as they have a tax treaty with the US?

no federal tax i think

yeah but I mean, no exit tax either

GOING FULLY OFFSHORE WORKS BETTER FOR MOST PEOPLE

If you‚Äôre a hedge fund manager or other professional with a big office who‚Äôs making millions in fees for your services, or you trade financial assets or cryptocurrency full-time, Puerto Rico‚Äôs a pretty sweet deal (for as long as it lasts).

Serious question - Other than store of value [Bitcoin] ... is there any other single usecase which has mass adoption in last 10 years?

Even who understands crypto .. I don't find a well enough blockchain use case out side of finance

[08-Jul-19 10:56 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
blockchains are good at creating asset and financial instruments,,, after store of value.. we will see a wave of products providing lending support and I think it will get adopted well too

[08-Jul-19 10:57 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Payments is good usecase and I think stable coins and libra will drive that

That is another major use case of crypto in the past ten years.  Open timestamp (Bitcoin), supplychain tracking(Vaultchain),  Deeds and titles(Factom),  Cybersecurity (Komodo).  Taken in aggregate , millions of users affected by this use case

[08-Jul-19 11:39 PM] allbits#5898
Also storage (Sia) and id for use in decentralized applications (blockstack). These are actual use cases since I personally use them for real world stuff.

these happy small businesses, which are selling emotions by practicing their management philosophy that people should be better off, and society should be better, are expected to give us a lot of implications today. Looking at the aspects of small and medium-sized companies that place the value of a company in the happiness of its members and its perpetuation, there is hope that they will realize what the essence of the company is and find some answers.
