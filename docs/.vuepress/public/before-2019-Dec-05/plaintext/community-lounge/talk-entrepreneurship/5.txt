With the boom of mini-stakers (distributed PoS), KMD could notarize to LUMBER and send the 10-50 BTC it would otherwise have burned in the old model, directly to LUMBER to fund further development and industry adoption (network effect for KMD).

Is anyone interested in working on a games project? I have a mostly finished game in C# and was looking for either a UI/UX person, or someone that could help finish the game. I sunk some money into dev, artwork, etc but never finished it off - if you are ok working for game ownership % that would be sick. I have a partner that's got 12 years of dev but no game dev experience, and I'm more on the business strategy/marketing side of things.

I started adding some products/articles for a new Shop on my website and I'm using affiliates (referral links) at the moment. They are ITP (Intelligent Tracking Protection) compliant, so they use only first party cookies (not the third party cookies that follow you around showing you the same ads everywhere).

 But I would prefer to sell my own products, also because the profits on referrals are very low, especially for a niche site on privacy. So if there are any logos/designs from the Komodo ecosystem that I can use to design some t-shirts etc please let me know. I found some affiliates for Hush clothing, Monero, Grin, Zcash...but the ones I found for Komodo are still using the old logo

Do you think creating a dedicated coin could have a place on the Privacy Alternatives website?
To keep things simple, it wouldn't even need to have privacy features as there are already some great privacy-focused coins around. Thinking of creating an ERC20 token to try it, using Metamask etc, then maybe later I can move it to the Komodo blockchain

Yes GAS is a problem I know, but Ethereum have the infrastructure to do it easily with Metamask and other tools and wallets available. I registered with the composer and the complete price was more than $8k. Not saying it's an unfair price , you get a lot for that amount,  being on AtomicDEX, having the security of dPoW etc, but I can't spend that amount at the moment. 

I also want to research what I would need to do for anything  related to regulations/compliance if:

1) I create a coin and then put it on any exchanges

2) If I integrate an exchange like Sideshift (and even AtomicDEX I think offer integrations).

Planning to move to a crypto friendly country very soon, probably Georgia, to make this possible

Some interesting times in australia. One member of parliament is proposing a ban on cryptocurrencies as well as this cash restriction..

This is why the IMF wants to stop you from using cash
A theory gaining traction is that the real motive for the cash ban is not the so-called black economy, but to give authorities greater control during recessions.

I've seen this coming for a while...  Was just praying that it didnt happen lol

[26-Aug-19 12:04 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I am in two minds whether to hold cash now. I am not paying a bank to store my money.

[26-Aug-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```Yet the Government is moving ahead with proposed laws that could make people criminals ‚Äî with the threat of two years in jail ‚Äî for spending more than $10,000 in cash.``` 
This is pretty ridiculuous.,.... But when i took out $7000 to buy my car, they were wuite angrey about it saying I was supposed to give 2 eeks notice to withdraw that amount

[26-Aug-19 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I usually hold most of my money in cash lol... But need a safe or something haha

[26-Aug-19 12:05 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah I need to invest in one as well. 
Although they're placing a restriction on the usage of it. It makes me want to store cash more so now aha

[26-Aug-19 12:05 PM] CHMEX#0686
A number of other countries have already imposed limits ‚Äî France has banned cash transactions above 1,000 euros; Spain above 2,500 euros; Italy above 3,000 euros.

[26-Aug-19 12:06 PM] CHMEX#0686
So if you carry more than 1k in france that makes you a criminal?

[26-Aug-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Might bust buy a bunch of silver of gold tho, not sure.

[26-Aug-19 12:07 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I was thinking precious minerals. I've always been interested into them. A lot more than gold and silver anyway.

[26-Aug-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah, the $10,000 thing is already implemented here I am prety sure... Not sure of the punishemnts for it though.

[26-Aug-19 12:08 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Or it's worth 10x more because theyve mined every piece of gold on the planet

I mean that the supperannuation is bankrupt lol ....

[26-Aug-19 12:09 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ahhh right. 
Either way, this 10k cash limit and the talk of negative interest rates is a fairly big over reach to force people to spend.

[26-Aug-19 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... Waste all of your moeny now. \

Tried buying a Walmart gift card for a friend in need, my credit card was frozen for fraud. 

Used #Bitcoin via @bitrefill to buy one a few minutes later. Instantly and low fees.

Just a little question. Is there any project that was able to get in real touch with @Fab√ò , I mean a real conversation, and maybe a real investment / proposal. Seems I can t find anything but Dune.
I know @PTYX is on the Dune discord, but aside of that, is there anything really going on for real ?

[03-Sep-19 08:02 AM] PTYX#6840
@Deleted User I can't give out too much information since it seems they are still very hush hush about the project. @Fab√ò is partners with Starchain Capital whom I read in an article is investing in Dune.

somewhat KMD disappeared from starchain's website, and nothing from the communication is left

[03-Sep-19 08:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
No, he s a general manager, so maybe removing KMD from starchain's website can be explained

I don't particularly know any details.

[03-Sep-19 08:04 AM] PTYX#6840
It's likely that if they had a position in KMD it could be liquidated. Hence the removal. Just my speculation though.
