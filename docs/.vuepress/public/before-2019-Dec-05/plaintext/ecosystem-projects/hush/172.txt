[01-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> The problem with crypyo journalism is that there is no reward for being critical. How would an article benefit, from being critical, about a project? 
Bagholders would be pissed & other projects would refrain from talking to you.

[01-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> I dont review project I am criticcal of

[01-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> But it's difficult to take them serious bc there seems to be no impartiality.
