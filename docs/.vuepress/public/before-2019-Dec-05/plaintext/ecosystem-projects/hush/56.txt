[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> What if my kmd address is sprout?

[13-Apr-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's not automatic, you must import the privkey for that

[13-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sprout really only is regarding zaddrs

[13-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> I'm using mobile agama

[13-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `What if my kmd address is sprout?` then your KMD is locked

[13-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> zaddrs are not being airdropped

[13-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you have funds in zaddrs, it will be worthless pretty soon

[13-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sprout zaddrs are going away

[13-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and our new chain will have Sapling zaddrs

[13-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I encourage everybody to use new Sapling zaddrs extensively and store funds in them

[13-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> only use taddrs for exchanges that don't support zaddrs (which is most right now, unfortunately)

[13-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but now zaddrs will be super fast, there is no reason not to use them

[13-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> our GUI wallets will teach users to use zaddrs by default

[13-Apr-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and warn that taddrs are leaking private metadata

[13-Apr-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> solo mining and exchanges will need taddrs for a while, but our mining pools will support sapling zaddrs!!! That is a big step

[13-Apr-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `our GUI wallets will teach users to use zaddrs by default`
_has one of those started, but it's not as shexy as yours_

[13-Apr-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all that glitters is not gold

[13-Apr-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I've still got a bit of C to learn to make it display right

[13-Apr-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Matthias> @dukeleto , if I were to send my Hush to a KMD address that I access via Ledger, would that allow me to retrieve/send the Hush back to another address after, or is that not supported?

[13-Apr-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Matthias> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool LOL! Not all of them, just some for long term hodling. Just a question at this point though.

[13-Apr-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> My question was more about ledger than the coins.
They **still** don't properly support KMD (even with luke holding their hand all the way along), so I'm still slightly confused as to why anyone uses them at all.

[13-Apr-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Matthias> The last KMD Ledger app had big improvements, seems to work fine atm. The one downside is that the Rewards part is a bit cumbersome.

[13-Apr-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `a bit cumbersome` aka `doesn't work`
sending a tx to yourself shouldn't be any more difficult than sending it to someone else

[13-Apr-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Matthias i have never used a Ledger and I don't recommend involving a Ledger in your HUSH/KMD stuff, unless you want to find bugs

[13-Apr-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Ledger support has vastly improved lately in KMD, I know that

[13-Apr-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But I don't own one and don't really follow it

New $HUSH mainnet coming soon, I made over 10 testnets in the last 48hrs testing things!

To know a thing well, know it limits. Only when pushed beyond its tolerances will true nature be seen. Do not depend only on theory if your life is at stake.

@CryptoBooksAlt I think it would be interesting for you to write a history of $HUSH, since we are currently going through a massive transition to a $KMD asset chain with new genesis block.
 Many details will be forgotten to the sands of time without a proper historian
Twitter

[13-Apr-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we never had any money for that, but the FR now gives us the funds to do cool things like that

[13-Apr-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I forget how much he charges, what do people think is a reasonable amount to pay for such a book to be made?

[13-Apr-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> a book printed on dead trees will be outdated as soon as it is printed. Also, so many more people will be able to see it and find out about Hush. We could give out free copies to people as prizes. Call me old-fashioned, but I like the idea of printed books

[13-Apr-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <btcrealm> Does this change to hush have anything to do with the BTCH chain?
I had a z-wallet I had to transfer out of for this update.  I'm guessing z-wallets didn't get BTCH anyway so probably no worries.  (yes, I am out of date and have not been paying attention lately)

[13-Apr-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiveBuddha> @DarkRealms nah it doesn't, but you made the right move taking out of zaddr

[13-Apr-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiveBuddha> Because when the update rolls out you will get coins on the new chain. Once that snapshot happens you can go back to zaddr on the new chain. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong

[13-Apr-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <btcrealm> @JiveBuddha thanks, I heard it wouldn't migrate if it was in zaddrs.  I just had it there because I was playing with it when radix42 needed an exchange.

[13-Apr-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <btcrealm> I will read the new white paper but is one of the goals of Hush still to do private secure messaging?

[13-Apr-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiveBuddha> I would also like clarification on what previous mission statements are still in the works. And what are the new ones

[13-Apr-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <btcrealm> I'm guessing the new whitepaper will have details but I haven't gotten to it yet.

[13-Apr-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiveBuddha> Whitepaper is a draft from my understanding, unless they shipped out a final version

[14-Apr-19 12:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's still a drafty pre-release, but it does have a lot of details already

[14-Apr-19 12:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> some details won't finalize until block 500,000 and the airdrop happens, then I can add all that data to the WP

[14-Apr-19 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> FYI the airdrop will take some time, a few hours to potentially 24hrs to run. I expect to have all the finalized data for people to look at very soon after the snapshot block.

[14-Apr-19 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> about 31,000 addresses will be involved

[14-Apr-19 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <btcrealm> Thanks @dukeleto for the update info

[14-Apr-19 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> #hush-github also has all the gritty details

[14-Apr-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the airdrop is a lot of waiting, because I can only send to a few hundred addresses at a time, in batches, and must wait for that to complete to send the next batch. No parallel processing in the airdrop, so it will be a series of batches. The next batch send needs to wait a bit for the previous xtn to confirm so it can spend the change that comes out of that transaction

[14-Apr-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in case people want to know more 🤓

[14-Apr-19 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Currently `71324.99338207 HUSH` is in Sprout zaddrs and will not be migrated to our new blockchain, which is 1.13% of current supply

[14-Apr-19 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> IF YOU HAVE FUNDS IN zaddrs, MOVE THEM ASAP, just over 300 blocks to go

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hopefully somebody sees that meme and saves their funds

[14-Apr-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> is mining going to continue or will it be paused?

[14-Apr-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> mining pools will switch over pretty seemlessly

[14-Apr-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you are a solo miner, you can switch to the new network immediately, and I am working with various pools

[14-Apr-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> and the payouts will go through fine?

[14-Apr-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> payouts will happen on the new chain, to the address you control on the new chain

[14-Apr-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so pool miners should convert their workers to the new address

[14-Apr-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> right but we have to wait for the airdrop?

[14-Apr-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you mine on the new chain, payouts will go to those addresses when pools payout

[14-Apr-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> regardless of airdrop

[14-Apr-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> Does the fork affect BTCH?

[14-Apr-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> airdrop funds must wait until airdrop completes

[14-Apr-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This does not effect BTCH in any way, we are catching up to BTCH having Sapling and cryptoconditions

[14-Apr-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and now HUSH + BTCH can do smart contracts across both chains, and interoperate

[14-Apr-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> before, they couldn't

[14-Apr-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> Ok thanks. I’m pretty sure I have BTCH based on my HUSH keys.   Not really sure tbh.

[14-Apr-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> Just want to make sure I don’t miss something

[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> Ty!

[14-Apr-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 👍

[14-Apr-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We around around 13ish hours from the snapshot block

[14-Apr-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I urge people, do not make transactions very close to the snapshot block

[14-Apr-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Things in the mempool, they are not on the blockchain

[14-Apr-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The mempool is ignored in an airdrop

[14-Apr-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> so I need to convert my address?

[14-Apr-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You will want to know your new address on the new HUSH chain

[14-Apr-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you have the same pubkey

[14-Apr-19 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but that pubkey maps to a different-looking address on the new chain, starts with an R...

[14-Apr-19 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> t1 -> R...

[14-Apr-19 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> can I mine to that?

[14-Apr-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> once pools have switched to the new chain, you should use your R... address as your worker name, OR pool ops might auto-convert for you

[14-Apr-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but that is up to the pool op

[14-Apr-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> these are good questions

[14-Apr-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Shivanshu> Hi. I just joined this group. Can some come one confirm if Cryptopia Hush coins will be migrate ?

[14-Apr-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Shivanshu yes

[14-Apr-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you don't need to do anything if your coins are on any exchange

[14-Apr-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's only people with "shielded" coins in addresses starting with a "z"

[14-Apr-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> So it’s an ‘airdrop’ to the snapshot at 500k?

[14-Apr-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Shivanshu> Awesome.  When do we expect the snapshot ?

[14-Apr-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We are upgrading our blockchain, mining a new genesis block, migrating funds to the new chain

[14-Apr-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> snapshot is block 500,000, our new blockchain will actually start just before that and be ready for people to jump onto and mine

[14-Apr-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @JWolf (WW Clan leader) yeah, good question. Mining seems ok I guess, but I recommend moving lots of your funds a few minutes before block 500,000

[14-Apr-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I do recommend sweeping funds into as few addresses as you can, or just one

[14-Apr-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It will make everything easier

[14-Apr-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You want to import 1 or a few privkeys, not 1000s
