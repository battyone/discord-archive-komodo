[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Real or bug??

[15-Sep-18 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <nicklikestuna> Real but low volume

[15-Sep-18 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <nicklikestuna> Could be a test, could be fat finger, could be a rally

[15-Sep-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> @dukeleto Hello mate! It's very nice to see the development you're currently making within Hush (specially against the 51% network attack), however, I'm really curious to know. Why are you so against the ASIC-resistant algo? I seriously think that Hush should get anti-ASIC as it could help its ever-falling price by making it less profitable for miners (right now, whenever hush gets a +10% increase in value, all those robotic-ASICs turn to mining Hush instead of Zen/Zcl/Zec and market dump a whole lot of hush.

[16-Sep-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We want to cover both asic and resistant mining through HUSH and BTCH, reaching a larger demographic.

[16-Sep-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> In my opinion, the result of such a low price of HUSH is Asic miners, which are immediately sold in large quantities

[16-Sep-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <lilienthal91> What's everyone's q4 estimate

[16-Sep-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Raja_MBZ feel free to make a new "ASIC-resistant coin" (doesn't exist) or switch to mining a different coin. I am super bored talking about why Hush is the way it is

[16-Sep-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <finrecon> @lilienthal91 50 cents??

[16-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> Hmmm I'm thinking about forking hush

[16-Sep-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RemoteConTroll> I still use Gpus but have not been mining because I‚Äôm running ac.  And it is too costly

[16-Sep-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spuddyminer> Current network hash rate spike is impressive also.

[16-Sep-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spuddyminer> Well, it's not a lot of volume yet, but it means that people are interested in picking up hush at this price rn. Looks good

[17-Sep-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Sep-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can see the HUSH addresses of KMD notaries on that page, and I have confirmed they match the dynamically generated addresses in my C++ code in the `dpow` branch, so things are moving forward for dpow + Hush

[17-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Spuddyminer most batch 2 z9m's can still be overclocked, just not as much as batch 1. The gui is removed but it's still possible to hit the API with curl and OC, fyi

[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Nice. Good to see network security improve.

[17-Sep-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> GAME was the first actual external coin to add DPoW and Hush will be the 2nd

[17-Sep-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> CHIPS was written by James, and KMD asset chains get it for free, so those don't really count. And Hush is the first ZEC fork to add DPoW, the other coins (CHIPS/GAME) are recent BTC 0.15 forks

[17-Sep-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I mention Hush a bunch in https://github.com/leto/mastering_komodo_dpow/blob/master/mastering_komodo_dpow.md , it's an example for many other coins to follow

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all coins will soon inherit the dynamic address calculation code I wrote for Hush, so the Hush dpow implementation will improve *all* dpow implementations for all coins, including GAME+CHIPS, the next time they upgrade

[17-Sep-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> to be clear, this is a HARD FORK, when dpow goes live, everybody must upgrade. Exchanges, mining pools, normal people, everybody. Those that don't will be on a fork

[17-Sep-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if people have questions, please ask them. dpow going to production in KMD notaries is a good chance to remind people that Hush is actually doing real stuff, it's not deddddd and Duke just likes to quietly work by himself sometimes. And sometimes he is enjoying life. It's probably a good idea for use to make a 1.0.14 release or 1.0.15, as we have everything up to 1.0.15 that we want, but never made 1.0.14. Version numbers are hard. Maybe a good time for Hush 2.0.0 and not tie our version numbers to Zcash version numbers

[17-Sep-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @FireMartZ if I merge `dpow` to `dev` soon, which I think I want to do, can you help make a new version release, so that exchanges and users can use an official release?

[17-Sep-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> notary nodes are happy to use `git` and a certain branch, but some like official releases

[17-Sep-18 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am talking to at least 4 coins that want to add DPoW for double spend protection at exchanges, so Hush is ahead of the curve on this one! üåä

[17-Sep-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Questions gathered from Twitter:

Can this notarization be used to issue art assets/digital collectibles that can be traded on the DEX? (2)
question 51% can be solved easily if you use not 1 algorithm and several tied to the mining devices so the attack will be not at all scary if the coin analog will be on another algorithm (completely copying the file of the main media), attacking 51% + attack =0 if there is a file restoration which would work as a backup\restoration . make more gcd on more algorithms. I'm from Russia and use Google translator so sorry for the mistakes)
How much hash required to 51 percent attack hush?
Do I have to do anything with HUSH?
What is the advantage of BTCH vs HUSH now that Hush is KMD notarized?
whether the attack of 51% for KMD is possible?
Why is this the best solution to prevent attack on Hush?
What is Hush KMD Notarization?
How will the development of KMD provide value to HUSH?

I'm not a coder but I'm really interested into consensus in crypto, how it works, the plus and cons and so on. For what I get dPOW is pegging a given chain to another, such as this one to the bitcoin one. What happen if the first chain is corrupted ?
