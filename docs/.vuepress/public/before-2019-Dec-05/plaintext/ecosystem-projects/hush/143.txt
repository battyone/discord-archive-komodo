[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @KillahJon Yeah I had just picked up about 9K HUSH on its last trading day on Cryptopia üò¨

[03-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> but they didn't let u withdraw

[03-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> even if u wanted to

[03-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> b4 they shut down

[03-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> damn

[03-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> at least you didn't have to spend much

[03-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> hahah

[03-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah it got locked up and disappeared along with Cryptopia

[03-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> yep

[03-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Luckily it was my only asset on Cryptopia

[03-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> HUSH withdrawals were stopped for weeks b4 that already

[03-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> or months

[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> craptopia

[03-Jul-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> lol

[03-Jul-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Now we have lots of exchanges though, and a brand new wallet that‚Äôs super secure as a full node üòä

[03-Jul-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> yes

[03-Jul-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> decent volume on hush

[03-Jul-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> relative to last 6 months

[03-Jul-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We had a few days of $4K-5K but have settled back into $1K range üòä still healthy for a very small alt coin üòä

[03-Jul-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> still have 5 fig of HUSH, but would like to still have that 2k lol

[03-Jul-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> im hoping we get above $10 one day

[03-Jul-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> maybe next year

[03-Jul-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> or 5 or 10

[03-Jul-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Well our team is much more committed now than it has ever been

[03-Jul-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We handle the development and hopefully our community members can help to grow the community üòä

[03-Jul-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> üòÑ

[03-Jul-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> can we get on tradingview?

[03-Jul-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> `Players can then buy a ticket (players are limited to just 1)` üòê

[03-Jul-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> wanted to buy many more than 1 üòÇ

[03-Jul-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> i think more ppl would be willing to trade HUSH if it were on tradingview

[03-Jul-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> as well

[03-Jul-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> does it mean hush is a working product now ? üòÉ

[03-Jul-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> sending files options sounds more like you built encrypted megaupload or sth

[03-Jul-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> üòâ

[04-Jul-19 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> My goal is to own 1/1000th of max circulation of Hush

[04-Jul-19 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> so about 21k

[04-Jul-19 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Hush volume has been very healthy for the past few months, we're just missing those huge exchanges.

[04-Jul-19 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Be on an exchange that is connected to it is easiest. Even pretty big exchanges, like kucoin, aren't integrated.

[04-Jul-19 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> on graviex, it says "powered by tradingview"

[04-Jul-19 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> @KillahJon that is just the charting software to display price. Most exchanges use that, but it doesn't mean they are integrated into the trading view platform

[dscrd-hush] <ITM> On a Altcoin bear market, our volumes are extremely good. Price remained relatively strong.

[04-Jul-19 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Graviex volume drop half and hush average remained the same.

[04-Jul-19 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Most people don't know how btc price will swing, but if we had a stable market(Not on TS), the order book liquidity will be better.

[04-Jul-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> In the current bullrun, it seems that btc almost reach previous peak , while alt coin still remain fairly uninspiring...

You may have heard of the famous P versus NP problem. If you can prove or disprove its cryptically short equation, you‚Äôd be a million dollars richer‚Äîand maybe even billions of dollars richer, depending on your scruples.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's like I want to put a new light fixture on the top floor of a building, and to make that work, I must go change part of the foundation + sewer system

[05-Jul-19 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> at first I thought it was too hard and not worth the work, but maybe I have found a solution

[05-Jul-19 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> our librustzcash compiles, that is nice

[05-Jul-19 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> at first i thought we would have to maintain our own fork of that code and make lots of annoying changes

[05-Jul-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> now it looks like it may be possible to do what we want with a tiny patch, that we tell our build system to apply to the official zcash version of librustzcash

[05-Jul-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that would mean not needing our own github releases and updating lots of sha256 hashes

[05-Jul-19 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hush compiles, starts up, syncs. It seems to work. I am modifying SilentDragon now to not download the 700MB file

[05-Jul-19 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> First Hush shielded transaction created from a node with no sprout-groth16.params : https://explorer.myhush.org/tx/a8a85a525fe8634f0ab80a644d3aee9c04a7773884f503f43b4ae6bd9723a9bb

[05-Jul-19 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is the first Zcash coin to do anything like this, that is the first shielded transaction from any Zcash coin ever, without groth16 files. This saves every node 700MB download, which is huge

[05-Jul-19 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> All Zcash coins currently download about 1.6GB of files to operate, before downloading the blockchain

[05-Jul-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Via 2 recent changes to removes Sprout stuff (since Hush v3 is the first Pure Saping zcash chain), we are down to just 50MB !!!

[05-Jul-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 1.6GB down to 50MB

[05-Jul-19 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So now Hush full nodes only have to download 3% of what they used to, it's the first Zcash protocol coin to make this kind of optimization. It's possible because we removed all support for Sprout

[05-Jul-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Since no KMD chain has any groth16 stuff, this can be sent to KMD as well and all asset chain full nodes can save 700MB

$HUSH is now the most bandwidth-efficient Zcash protocol coin!
We just removed the need to download another large Sprout-related file. Now only 50MB of setup files are needed where $ZEC + all other coins require 1.6GB to be downloaded before ever syncing!
