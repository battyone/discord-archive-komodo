[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @MikeO yep, hush is a source code fork of KMD, and we have ./src/hushd wrappers to make things easy

[22-May-19 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because nobody wants to use all the CLI args 😃

[22-May-19 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hush used to be it's own source code, and you would always use `./src/hushd` and I just kept that and so all existing scripts and docs can stay the same 😅

[22-May-19 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MikeO> you guys are live now.   https://www.altilly.com/asset/HUSH

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @MikeO  Wow, cool thanks for letting us know 😃

[22-May-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I guess we're now live on Altilly exchange

[22-May-19 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Thanks 🤗

[22-May-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <aledel> Are we there yet? 🌘

[22-May-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 oh cool!!!

[22-May-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @MikeO hey thanks!!! I didn't realize you were from altlilly 😃

[22-May-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> was going through some old posts from about a year ago had to share...                                
    "Cryptopia is auwful now in respect of deposits and withdrawals of some coins.
Apparently they use paper and pencil not servers  Grin.
I was trying to ask about a deposit that did not appear in my account hours later, and there was a message asking me to wait at least one week, before asking about deposit.
Hopefully they will not close and run away with our coins.
I do not recommend them at all till things clear up."

"lol that would actually be funny if it turned to be true. Like some leaked photos where they scratch their head with a pencil sitting in front of a desk with 1000 pages of paper! It might be true though given their current performance."

[22-May-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> irony

[22-May-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> Is a @MikeO a MikeO by another name?

[22-May-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no comprendo

[22-May-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> is @MikeO aka @Cryptofist or are they both different MikeOs?

[22-May-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Kumkani> @JWolf (WW Clan leader)do you think we will get back our hush coins from cryptopia?

[22-May-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't know anything about MikeO or Cryptofist, to be honest

[22-May-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Kumkani no, the point of liquidation is to sell your coins and give the profits to owners of the company

[22-May-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Someone just wiped out the buy order book on txbit, some big whale just jumped out.
https://txbit.io/Trade/HUSH/BTC
Looks like HUSH can be bought at a good discount here still

[22-May-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> is graviex still the only one reporting to coinmarketcap?

[22-May-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> At the moment yes, them and TradeSatoshi

[22-May-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> but to my knowledge tradesatoshi is still a closed network in maintenance

[22-May-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Altilly is also on cmc, we just need to get some volume there and make an request to get it added

[22-May-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> ok 4sure

[22-May-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> That would be super helpful for us

[22-May-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If we can get a bunch of people to buy and sell on Altilly to get the tracking up for CMC that'd be huge for us 😃

[22-May-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Buy and sell at what you think hush is worth, and let the market decide

[22-May-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> volume really helps us, that brings liqudity

[22-May-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> With Cryptopia funds locked up, we need a lot more HUSH to start circulating

[22-May-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> I have some for selling but not much

[22-May-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> most of it is long-term...

[22-May-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I'll have to sell my hush in tradesatoshi and buy back from altilly

[22-May-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah my biggest concern is making our markets active, almost everyone holding has the mindset that they won't sell at current prices

[22-May-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Which is awesome that people have faith in the project

[22-May-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> but we need activity too 😅

[22-May-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> cant afford too...

[22-May-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Buying and selling activity? Make the token useful and it will come...

[22-May-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Guess only miners willing to sell here.

[22-May-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> does anyone have a invite for Altillys discord? theirs is expired...

[22-May-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> many people still need to learn that various new exchanges support Hush

[22-May-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> A lot of new ones

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> it should work, i just made it

[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> yeah I figured you had, and thank you, but it says "invalid invite
Ask@heguli97 for a new one"

[22-May-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Looks like Berg and Runningmanthecoin could join using that link, can you confirm @Berg ?

[22-May-19 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <owerache> thx @Berg for invitation 😃

[22-May-19 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> You're welcome 😃 Welcome to our Discord!

[22-May-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <owerache> have you ever presented barterlly here?  @Berg

[22-May-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yes! I have yet to use it, their app was down all day yesterday, but I've heard they're back up and running

[22-May-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I've posted a few times about them

[22-May-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> and a few on Twitter as well
#hush-twitter

[22-May-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <owerache> we're online and there's even a bounty to make swaps

[22-May-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I should have some Hush swaps posted in the next day or two 😃

[22-May-19 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <owerache> héhé That sounds good. 😃

[22-May-19 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <owerache> Hi, there. I’m inviting you to make a 1 KMD swap in exchange for 10 HUSH through Barterlly Escrow swaps. It’s the safest way for people that just want to make quick OTC swaps.If you want to go through with the swap you need to accept it and follow the instructions on:  https://app.barterlly.io/invite/180

[23-May-19 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mixic> Only forward HUSH! 👍

[23-May-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> Hi, there. I’m inviting you to make a 96.1879 HUSH swap in exchange for 0.001154255 BTC through Barterlly Escrow swaps. It’s the safest way for people that just want to make quick OTC swaps.
      If you want to go through with the swap you need to accept it and follow the instructions on https://app.barterlly.io/invite/192
    Just trying this out seems kinda cool...😑

[23-May-19 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I helped in a small way to write some of the code that Barterlly uses, so it's really cool to see it being used!! I haven't had time, but I plan to put some barterlly offers up. Life has just been busy

[23-May-19 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Barterlly is really cool and unique and I highly suggest people try it out before using another centralized exchange

[23-May-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> Yeah one thing I wish is that Barterlly would remember the addresses you use. Altilly's pretty cool too + no fees RN...I 4got that I even had an account there, never had a reason to use it b4.

[dscrd-hush] <Dark Angel> Hello. Old HUSH swing wallet is died?

[23-May-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @Dark Angel I don't know if you have heard the news, old wallets don't "work" because of the new chain hush started using last month. https://myhush.org/sapling/

[23-May-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Wallets that do support Hush now are the web wallet, Agama wallet 0.3.6 and Hushmate swing wallet

[23-May-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dark Angel> @heguli97 I read this news. It just became interesting whether the old wallets will continue to work.

[23-May-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dark Angel> @heguli97 on the old wallet remained HUSH. Because the wallet is not synchronized, then HUSH can not switch to a new wallet

[23-May-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Ah okay, 😀, as i said above only the old swing wallet is not supported any longer, along with zelcore closed source wallet.

You can use your privatekeys to access your Hush on the new komodo based chain.

[23-May-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dark Angel> Thank you!!!
