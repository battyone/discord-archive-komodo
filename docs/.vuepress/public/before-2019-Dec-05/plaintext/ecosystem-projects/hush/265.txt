This is really not that surprising but it turns out that 42% of employees in the industry work for crypto exchanges. Another 20% work for ASIC manufacturers and cryptocurrency foundations

[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Joe Rogan is not afraid to go down the wormhole

[23-Oct-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> So 42% work for exchanges, 10.7% for mining, 4% on Custody & Wallet & 1% on HW Wallet, and only 10.5% of employees actually work for cryptocurrencies.

[23-Oct-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> That should tell you that Exchanges, they run crypto. I am not a fan of this.

[24-Oct-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> Wow that's a lot more diverse than i thought. I thought 50% worked as financial analysts on twitter, and the other half were selling bitcoin t-shirts.

[dscrd-hush] <MikeO> Hello.   in the linux wallet, whats the difference between "confirmations" and "rawconfirmations" ?

[24-Oct-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @MikeO https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/dPoW-conf.html#a-practical-example-of-how-number-of-confirmations-are-displayed-after-this-update 

From how i understood it is that `rawconfirmations` are actual confirmations that have happened on chain(in this case Hush) and `confirmations` are notarized by dPoW.

[dscrd-hush] <MikeO> Ok, thanks

[24-Oct-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> confirmations == rawconfirmations IF the transaction is notarized. Otherwise, confirmations=0 or 1 until notarized

It was 36 years ago and Steve Jobs wrote and recorded this product introduction for the Apple IIe.

This is a very rare clip from an Apple Dealer promotion VHS (and betamax) video.

It is a fascinating insight on ideas that would later flourish.
