[30-Nov-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Np. What's going on?

[30-Nov-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> How's SilentDragonLite?

[30-Nov-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> SilentDragon Android?

[30-Nov-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> Nothing much. Oh sdl is superb. So is sda

[30-Nov-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I really like SDLite

[30-Nov-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> When I log off my pc it disconnects though on sda

[30-Nov-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We have a SilentDragonSuperLite, in the works.

[30-Nov-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> Okay great news. Can SDA operate without to SDL. Perhaps after syncing  @Privatoshi

[30-Nov-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Did you do it using the wormhole?

[30-Nov-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> On SDA in Settings, don't check

[30-Nov-19 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> SDLite, check below the QR Code

[30-Nov-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It'll change the QR Code, so change it first.

[30-Nov-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Then scan it, with your camera.

[30-Nov-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> See what it does

[30-Nov-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> Yes I did that yesterday. I'm my near my pc at the moment

[30-Nov-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> If it does nothing, click reconnect

[30-Nov-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> I scanned it and it connected to my sda

[30-Nov-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And?

[30-Nov-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> When I switched off my pc sda didn't work again

[30-Nov-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You need to keep it running.

[30-Nov-19 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Because it is using the wormhole, to connect the wallets, on both devices.

[30-Nov-19 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> Okay o get it

[30-Nov-19 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You can delete that image.

[30-Nov-19 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> Cool

[30-Nov-19 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> If you click the 3 dots, is the box checked?

[30-Nov-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> I can only do that later buddy

[30-Nov-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> I'm still at from home

[30-Nov-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> No problem. 
I'll DM you the info.
```
SDA - Box unchecked
SDL - Box under QR Code Checked```

[30-Nov-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> @Privatoshi cool

[30-Nov-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> If you ever have any errors, it's really really helpful if you report them. Whatever you can say, is helpful.

[30-Nov-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> Okay buddy . Always on the lookout

[30-Nov-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Like if your wallet crashes and it leaves an error message

[30-Nov-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Just copy and paste the error message, in #developers

[30-Nov-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And say, I was doing this, and this happened

[30-Nov-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> No prob

[30-Nov-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Duke & Denio & all of those guys, are very appreciative of stuff like that

[30-Nov-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @Privatoshi Nobody, the forum has been closed for a very long time.

[30-Nov-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> a pings a thing

[30-Nov-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @BigLez Hey!!!!

[30-Nov-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @dukeleto 
Look who joined Hush!?! 🙏 🙏

[30-Nov-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @Privatoshi Who is it? 🧐

[30-Nov-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It's someone that helped us out

[30-Nov-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> What we didn't understand earlier this week, is that when you post screenshots to discord, they lose their compression. And whatever changes you made, become invalid.

[30-Nov-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Google Play would not accept our screenshots for a week, it said they were invalid.

[30-Nov-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> So I posted in XDA discord, asking for assistance. Because they are really good with media and androids.

[30-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Within 20 minutes of sending the screenshots over to  @BigLez, they were all sent back and finished, in a zip file. And they worked.

[30-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I had no idea that they'd lose their format, if we sent them to someone else, in discord.
