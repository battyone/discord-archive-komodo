[27-Jun-19 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then each block of 27KB costs 1 transaction fee

[27-Jun-19 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> actually, the 27KB is an old number

[27-Jun-19 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's actually 200KB for one transaction fee now

[27-Jun-19 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is the default max xtn size for KMD AC's which I helped come up with

[27-Jun-19 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 27KB is the old limit from Sprout days

[27-Jun-19 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 in theory, we can support up to ~200KB files in one transaction, sent to one person, for one tx fee. For example, if you wanted to send it to 2 zaddrs, you would only have space to send a 100KB file in 1 transaction. The number of recipients effects max file size that will fit in one transaction

[27-Jun-19 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> So where does the blockchain reside

[27-Jun-19 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> It's in everyone's wallet?

[27-Jun-19 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> This would be quite large at some point in time?

[27-Jun-19 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> My email inbox gets pretty big. :)

[27-Jun-19 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> on every full nodes hard drive

[27-Jun-19 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, we have to come up with some reasonable max size file, or make the fees such that it can't be abused

[27-Jun-19 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and our blockchain does not grow to large in size

[27-Jun-19 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is only 4MB per block

[27-Jun-19 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and 576 blocks per day

[27-Jun-19 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is it

[27-Jun-19 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so a "fee market" may evolve at some point, if the Hush chain gets busy. We can also make more chains, or do various other things. They are good problems to have

[27-Jun-19 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You might pay more fees if you want your very important Hush memo to get to your biz partner right away, vs upload a large file that can wait until tomorrow @heguli97

[27-Jun-19 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the more fees you pay, the more likely miners will add it to a block, if blocks are full

[27-Jun-19 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763

[27-Jun-19 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Confused.  Why would silent dragon have a mining function

[27-Jun-19 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> No way you can cpu mine or GPU mine hush

[27-Jun-19 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <azer95> Good Night

[27-Jun-19 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX all full nodes can mine

[27-Jun-19 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, you can CPU mine with Silent Dragon, but there is no GUI option for it

[27-Jun-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX yes, you can CPU or GPU mine Hush, or even with your web browser, but none of them are even remotely profitable

[27-Jun-19 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Yeah.  But I mean.  What's the point.

[27-Jun-19 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Help secure the network?

[27-Jun-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Yes just setgenerate true 0

[27-Jun-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> For staking

[27-Jun-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> And setgenerate true 8 for 8 cores right

[27-Jun-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Asset chain cli

[27-Jun-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX Hush doesn't have staking, you are thinking of vrsc

[27-Jun-19 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX any mining does help secure the network, in the same way that mining BTC with your GPU helps the security of BTC. A positive but very small amount

[27-Jun-19 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> 1 user test is all you needed?

[27-Jun-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> so I moved my hush into  SilentDragon  an now  I reopened it  and  the wallet is not there ???

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Did you backup your wallet.dat

[27-Jun-19 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I was able to import mine nonproblem.

[27-Jun-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> But I didn't bring over the wallet.dat

[27-Jun-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Because I knew my key

[27-Jun-19 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
