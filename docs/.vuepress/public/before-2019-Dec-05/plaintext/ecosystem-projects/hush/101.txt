[dscrd-hush] <jabe> Google helped!

[31-May-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> My reading of it is that they tried to expand in early 2018 at the top of the bull market, borrowed lots of money but then business declined in the bear market and they were unable to keep pace. 
Problems go back way before the alleged hack in January. 
It was probably obvious a long time ago (to anyone with access to the information) that they were heading towards going bust.

[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> was there any reason why they did not allow duplicate receivers int he first place?
As it looks the protocol is not affected it's just removed from the rpccall right?

[31-May-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX never was a consensus rule in any coin that I know

[31-May-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX i think it's intended to prevent abuse but it actually only makes valid use more annoying

[31-May-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX ZEC is not focused on communications, Hush is

[31-May-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> ( I accutaly was annoyed by that issue as I could not figure out why only one payment was send to the address )

[31-May-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is a core thing. ZEC is much like BTC, where financial transactions are focused on, not other applications

[31-May-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX i made this change in the old  Hush codebase long ago, to enable HushList stuff

[31-May-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> cool! I thought maybe it had something to do with the protocol but good to know it was just the rpccall

[31-May-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's purely in RPC land

[31-May-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> send a PR to ZEC and I'm sure there will be 227 comments about it

[31-May-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> oh, there is a big history already üòÖ , and that PR already exists, and somebody else wrote it

[31-May-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> ow I see üòÉ

[31-May-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I believe VOT coin suggested this to ZEC, and I saw it get denied

[31-May-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and VOT didn't want to diverge from ZEC so they threw it away, but I saw it was very valuable for HushList protocol

[31-May-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it allows you to easily send a 27KB file in a single transaction, to your friend, versus only being able to send 512 bytes in a single transaction (without resorting to raw transactions, which have very very little support with zaddrs currently)

[31-May-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and then to send larger files, you can string along these units of 27KB (which have units of 512bytes inside)

[31-May-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> until you get to your block size

[31-May-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> 27KB sounds like a good amount of data for most things you don't want anybody else to read

[31-May-19 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 512 bytes is pretty limiting when you think about unicode and emoji and including URLs, etc

[31-May-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> many emails are probably less than 27KB in textual content, but 512 bytes would be limiting

[31-May-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> yes true

[31-May-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> z_listunspent didnt used to display the position

[31-May-19 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so if more than one to same address, it was ambiguous

[31-May-19 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> but we added position info

[31-May-19 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if we can store a PDF, it's possible to store a signed/notarized/legal copy of a will, inside an encrypted memo field, on the blockchain, which can be verified by any full node in the world

[31-May-19 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c thanks for that clarity, didn't know that

[31-May-19 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> not sure how to specify vout position for ztx though

[31-May-19 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c `outindex`

[31-May-19 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is what z_listunspent gives for sapling zutxos now

[31-May-19 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and that is what z_createrawtransaction will intake

[31-May-19 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> as long as z_sendmany iterates through the outindex and can spend duplicate funds, it seems fine

[31-May-19 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> {txid: "txid", "outindex": 0 }

[31-May-19 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> >>signed/notarized/legal l copy of a will
That's pretty useful! I'm sure somebody will do an ico about that / or already did

[31-May-19 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c i used to do this on the old Hush v2 codebase, i never ran into issues, but that was sprout and everything has changed. I will do some testing

[31-May-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I do think i was the one who reported the lack of a unique index for sprout stuff, to zec, and that made them add some keys to rpc output

[31-May-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> the real test is to just make an address get a few duplicate zutxo and try to spend all the funds

[31-May-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX you want to fund my shielded will startup? üëº I have seen a few other things vaguely like this idea, but nothing that has real tech behind it. With sprout it was a fantasy, with Sapling it's very possible

[31-May-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763

[31-May-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX most of the tech already exists, the real value-add is partnering with estate planners and financial advisors, to provide it like a SaaS

[31-May-19 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the first step is the simplest way to store files in the blockchain, i have that all mapped out pretty well. it can be done from a wallet or even a website

[31-May-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX how much would you pay to store a small encrypted file in the ARRR blockchain ? What is that service worth? If people value this service, there are a lot of potential. I mentioned wills before because they are extremely important documents, but it works for any data

[31-May-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can choose to keep the file private, just sending it to yourself, or a website could allow you to upload a file and then provide a web-proxy URL to view it. Any full node would be able to access it as well, the web-proxy is mostly convenience and to show off that the file is actually there and accesible

[31-May-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> To me it would be worth to store a document for $100 on a worldwide ledger if I can only access it with a privkey.
There are certain documents I can imagine that I don't want to have at my house or even in a vault under my name.

[31-May-19 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> having it stored in a fully private chain also makes it QR no?
as there is no address data leaking it would not be possible to find out the receiving address.

[31-May-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX you are asking about quantum-resistant? I am not sure
