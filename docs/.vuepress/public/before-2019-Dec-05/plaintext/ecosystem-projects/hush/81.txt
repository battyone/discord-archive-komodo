[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I bought some coins like two hours before they shut down trading

[09-May-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I was lucky I didn't have a bunch of open orders or anything, no BTC trapped there, just a few Hush 😃

[09-May-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> @aledel thanks for the wisdom, sensei

[09-May-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> it's only 1200 coins or so. already at peace with losing them

[09-May-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `already at peace with losing them`
That should be your stance on every coin you give to any exchange

[09-May-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> They are not lost s'long as Cryptopia stays above water

[09-May-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> They have communicated to us their full intent to keep Hush listed

[09-May-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> more worried about them ever regaining the volume they had before

[09-May-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> They are just slow since we're a low priority coin, they have a ton of work ahead of them before they get to little old us 😃

[09-May-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Agreed, hopefully they have learned from the recent turmoil

[09-May-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> pretty sure their wallet architecture, or lack thereof, hasn't changed a bit

[09-May-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> that's the only way to explain why it's taking this long

[09-May-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> just a bunch of sloppy, YOLO programming

[09-May-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Hopefully there's some improvements behind the scenes on security that they aren't releasing

[09-May-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But I hear that sentiment, seems like a lot of copy pasta

[09-May-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Not too much tenured experience

[09-May-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> i wouldn't dream of releasing an exchange without making sure i had redundant copies of everything and a way to spin instances up at a moment's notice
preferably, programatically, via some unified interface

[09-May-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> my guess is they're doing plain old duct tape + hope, putting a bunch of wallets in vms, probably manually

[09-May-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> 😅

[09-May-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> also, that's why they have an exchange and i don't, lol

[09-May-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> but they sure took the short straw on that trade-off between 'the right way' and slapstick comedy

[09-May-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Cryptopia wallets be like

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm hoping that we can get Graviex listing to track on CMC soon 😃

[09-May-19 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Would be big to have some level of visibility where the majority of people look

[09-May-19 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Most people assume we have no volume just by looking at CMC, just because most of our exchanges aren't on it 😦

[09-May-19 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I remember hearing somewhere that you have to be able to sustain a certain level of volume for a few days in order for CMC to start tracking the coin

[09-May-19 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah we need to reach $1,000 in volume

[09-May-19 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We're only in the hundreds right now

[09-May-19 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> What are they going to do? Seize all exchange domains and take our ledgers away?

[10-May-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Zatoichi> so what is the prospect for the development of btch. I suppose it was not the scam to get the funds of the folks by means of pumped hush? If not, then what is the work being done on it?

[10-May-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Zatoichi it's weird to say that giving people a new free coin is a "scam". Additionally, it was BTC going to 20K just after the HushList whitepaper release that "pumped" the price of Hush previously. BTCH didn't really have nearly as large an effect. Also, there was 4 coins you could get to get some BTCH, so it would be better for people, at that time, to buy the other coins to get BTCH, not HUSH, which was "very expensive" at the time. SUPERNET and DEX tokens also were airdropped into BTCH

[10-May-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Akira X i mine vrsc with an fpga, you can earn a bit with CPUs too, but not much really

[10-May-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> congress should ban all cryptocoins again

[10-May-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that seems to make the price of stuff go up

[10-May-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Zatoichi> @dukeleto indeed, the hush was partly pumped because of the btc pump, but historically, if you look at the growth of the hush price, it began to grow primarily and mostly after the announcement of the btch fork, that there will be airdrop for the hush owners. Since it was done after the help given to the zcl team with their tech, and zcl went up, so folks expected the btch (as it was positioned by the creators) to be sort of btcp rival, taking into account that there was some roadmap produced and so on. In my definition, the scam is something that is positioned as something of significant value, useful, competing with some similar or inferior tech, but then after all those promises, basically put off and forgotten. So, if btch is developed with the original positioning and also plans, then it is a valid tech, but if it is from the serious considerations by the devs, then how would you otherwise call, to be fully honest? Scam does not consist in being given free coins, but in not following on one's promises and evident implications. If you remember, the Bitcoin Hush was positioned in those days so highly so that the folks were even wondering if hush is going to be developed further, or if everyone will turn to develop btch.

[10-May-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Zatoichi> In any case, the question is: will the devs take up the serious development of BITCOIN HUSH, so that it may be up to the level of at least BTCP acceptance and usability, for the original claims were that the Bitcoin Hush tech is much more advanced tech than the tech of forked zcl aka bitcoin private.

[10-May-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Zatoichi BTCP still doesn't have sapling

[10-May-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Zatoichi BTCH already has it, and many other fixes + features from upstream ZEC + KMD

[10-May-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Zatoichi so today, right now, I say that BTCH is better tech than either of those other coins I shall not mention. Also BTCH has DPoW which those other coins lack

[10-May-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Zatoichi BTCP is listed as attackable on crypto51.app , for just a few dollars you can do a double spend attack, same with ZCL

[10-May-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so I think you are barking up the wrong tree

[10-May-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> These are very dead horses buried in the ground

[10-May-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> To dig them up and kick them, it seems maybe you have an ulterior motive

[10-May-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Zatoichi> @dukeleto I did not read this info that btcp is still atackable. Sad to hear that. However, my point was not whether the btcp is better than btch or worse, but that btch was originally presented as the more advanced tech, as such the token with the high prospects of development, whitepaper promised, roadmap, and so on. While mostly we read about the hush development. Can the attitude change towards btch, as it was originally intended? And by the way, I do not own a single btcp, but I keep hush and btch.

[10-May-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have actually been helping ZCL+BTCP with the recent Sapling DoS stuff

[10-May-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Zatoichi you are misinformed and/or misunderstand things

[10-May-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTCH needs more devs and people that want to work on it

[10-May-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I can do many things, but I am just a single person

[10-May-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> many things were talked about for future BTCH plans, but nothing has been decided

[10-May-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and with the Sprout CVE, all focus was needed on HUSH

[10-May-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH was catching up to BTCH, who was already on Sapling

[10-May-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Zatoichi if you want to make BTCH better in the future, volunteer to help do something, and then do it

[10-May-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and if enough people do that, many things happen

[10-May-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I thank you for constructive criticism, and yes, BTCH has not been getting a lot of attention. I agree with you

[10-May-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> There were a lot of discussions recently about BTCH's direction, but nothing has been set in stone yet.. The recent events of Sprout bugs and our team feeling the need to correct for potential security issues with the inflation bug took precedence.

[10-May-19 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> @Zatoichi  I’ve been a hush holder for a long time, and I lost boatloads of money on this project. However, it’s not a scam. There was massive incompetence by the team during the fork that lead to a massive price dump, and I think the original founders knew it was a coin they could pump and dump (which they did on an overly enthusiastic crypto market).  It was a ruthless move, but HUSH is real and has real functionality.  Whether it succeeds or not long term is another question.  It’s going to be tough for any small market coin to pump during this run because you have to be on the legitimate exchanges for that to happen, which is going to be tough for a coin  that has some negative history.

ZCL and BTCP were legitimate scam coins in my opinion. I believe the people that many people involved  with that project were definitively scammers and possibly real criminals.   In my opinion, BTCP especially is one of the greatest scams in the crypto space.   It’s absolutely incredible what those mfers pulled off.

I remember Duke making strong implications to folks not to invest in that project, and many ignored his words of caution (myself included) to their extreme detriment. 

Net of it: In my opinion, HUSH is not a scam despite many serious issues, but those other coins are scams

[10-May-19 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> The above is one man’s opinion of course and others are free to disagree

[10-May-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> Rule of thumb: if it has 'BTC' in it, and is not actually BTC, avoid.
