[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> We have Silent Dragon, Silent Dragon Lite, Silent Dragon Android, the DragonHead, the HushDroid and AtomicDex listing. Google Play listing and FDroid listing, will come soon. GP first,  FDroid later when we get time.

We have began work on a Hush Messenger,  for Android üî•.

With all of this work comes translations, guides, testing etc..

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @Captain Possibly, not sure if anyone's doing it right now but as it stands, there doesn't seem to be a dutch translation for SD currently. There's a 1000 hush bounty for new translations of Silentdragon https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragon

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Captain Finnish was just added to :SD:, you can emulate exactly the same stuff. We just need 1 new file from you, a *.ts, and if github is too hard, you don't have to use that. You can just upload the *.ts file here or where-ever. Github *will* be needed later, to make modifications, but it's not needed for initial submission. 1000 HUSH bounty for all new languages to SD https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragon/pull/99/files

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```
Hush [HUSH]: Hush recently migrated their codebase from ZEC-forked code, to a codebase derived directly from KMD‚Äôs prior work. Hush has created Hushlist, a means for users to communicate using zero-knowledge technology, similar to mailing lists. This can be used by journalists, whistleblowers, or anyone needing to communicate with many others, in a privacy-sensitive way. According to Hush‚Äôs lead developer, Duke Leto:

    ‚ÄúHush was the first Zcash Protocol coin to remove the 1.6GB download requirement prior to syncing, which in addition to it having the smallest on-disk chain size of ~1GB, makes [it] the most bandwidth-efficient fork‚Äù.
```

[22-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i gave a quote for that link @Biz shared, it's maybe one of the best pieces describing Hush in relation to Pirate, KMD, ZEC and XMR

[22-Nov-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> It does tell users exactly how, HUSH is different in relation to privacy coins,.with a lot in common with it.

[22-Nov-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush + Pirate are more alike than different, compared to any other Zcash protocol or even privacy coin

[22-Nov-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Anybody that tells you different is probably trying to sell you something

[22-Nov-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> HushList & and a lighter on-disk chain size.

[22-Nov-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Hush and Pirate, yes.

[22-Nov-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HushList will work on all zcash protocol coins, by design

[22-Nov-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Hush and ZCash, no.

[22-Nov-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush + Pirate are both forks of KMD, not ZEC. Pirate is a run-time fork while Hush is a source fork

[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> $29 kek

[22-Nov-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the day of HUSH/ZEC parity is closing in üòâ

[22-Nov-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Why is KMD preferred to ZEC?

[22-Nov-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Being a fork of KMD, instead of ZEC

[22-Nov-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 purely practical, pragmatic and also philosophic

[22-Nov-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 i had to do 6 months of work to learn how to add DPoW to the old Hush codebase, we had DPoW, but only sprout. The easiest way to upgrade to Sapling was to become a KMD fork

[22-Nov-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that way, as a KMD fork, we get DPoW, Sapling, cryptoconditions, and all the good stuff that KMD has added to ZEC

[22-Nov-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> being a plain ZEC fork had no benefits, and actually many downsides

[22-Nov-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> It sounds like it.

[22-Nov-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> They haven't had JL or you or the KMD crew, working every day to improve. They come through with very nice wallets among other things, but that's not daily work.

[22-Nov-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They spend over a million dollars per month

[22-Nov-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Given their budget, KMD and HUSH put ZEC to shame with what we produce on a few % of their budget

[22-Nov-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> We just want $100k, for one year.

[22-Nov-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash Company, not the foundation, spends $1.1M USD/month, just by itself

[22-Nov-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Company+Foundation together are more like $1.5M USD/month, if I had to guess

[22-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the foundation gave us zecwallet, which we forked into SilentDragon, SilentDragonAndroid and SilentDragonLite!

[22-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash Foundation pays for code to be written that we actually use

[22-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash Company just writes zcashd, and we don't use that code anymore, except to pull in bugfixes or small features. HUSH does not track ZEC by default

[22-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most features they add have already been done by KMD, as well

[22-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ZEC is still catching up to KMD

[22-Nov-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> new CVEs reported by researchers, those get reported to ZEC so we pull fixes from ZEC

[22-Nov-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush doesn't even spend anywhere close to $10,000/month on development yet, so we are much greater than 100X more efficient in our budget that Zcash Company

[22-Nov-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We will watch Zcash Company potentially run out of money

[22-Nov-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> ZCash Company writes zcashd and pays Zooko and Vitalik

[22-Nov-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And we will just be chillin' here, enjoying the fireworks

[22-Nov-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Starting our new pair, HUSH/ZEC

[22-Nov-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The HUSH FR lasts another 30years, until all Hush block rewards end

[22-Nov-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have funding for about 30years

[22-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash Company, has less than 1 year of funding left

[22-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> 30? Holy crap

[22-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and they are begging for money already

[22-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> They rolled out a new roadmap last night

[22-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> orly?

[22-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> sounds like they need to beg investors for money

[22-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Said, we might only complete 80 percent of this

[22-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Lol

[22-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Hell of a way to wrap up the roadmap last paragraph

[22-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they have already threatened the community

[22-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "if we don't get our money, we will abandon ZEC to the foundation, and start our own new coin"

[22-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and I would say, that is at least 50% likely

[22-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they call that Zcash2

[22-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i don't read their forums, but i see people fighting about it on twitter

[22-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> zcash FR talk is possibly the most boring thing in the world

[22-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the foundation has no developers

[22-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they must outsource and pay devs, like Aditya, to write ZecWallet

[22-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> abandoning ZEC to an org that has no devs of it's own, well, that would be a big fuck you

[22-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the community is toxic enough that this is possible and maybe even likely

[22-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I checked out ZCash Forum

[22-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> It was lame

[22-Nov-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yup

[22-Nov-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> lots of fighting and praying that the "ZEC priests" will care about something
