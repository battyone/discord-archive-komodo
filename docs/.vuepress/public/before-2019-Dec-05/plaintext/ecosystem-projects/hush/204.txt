[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it only happens if that computer has never had KMD or any smart chain ever installed

[27-Aug-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DieserMerlin> Works

[27-Aug-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so installing KMD first will also fix it (you don't need to even sync, just startup)

[27-Aug-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DieserMerlin> Thank you

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> make sure to move your funds withdrawn from the tipbot (only supports taddrs) to a more private zaddr in your SilentDragon wallet!

[27-Aug-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> @DieserMerlin pls share this infos with the class

[27-Aug-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gosh, we need a new SD release soon

[27-Aug-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> So not everybody jumps in and ask the same question

[27-Aug-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio extra credit for students that compile latest `master` branch from source üòâ

[27-Aug-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 25 hush instead of 5 hush

[27-Aug-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> !tip @DieserMerlin 50 Hush

[27-Aug-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> üí∞ @denio sent @DieserMerlin **50.00 HUSH** (‚âà $1.50).

[27-Aug-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Compile it, please üòâ

[27-Aug-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DieserMerlin> haha challenge accepted

[27-Aug-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @DieserMerlin go go go! there are lots of cool new features

[27-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> like Address Validation and the GUI to connect to the android app

[27-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> file upload (just small files for now, 512 bytes or less)

[27-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and various bugfixes like the one you hit

[27-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i think your version might still download 1.6gb of files?

[27-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> latest doesn't need all that junk

[27-Aug-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DieserMerlin> I think it downloaded about 700mb

[27-Aug-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @DieserMerlin ok. even that is not needed with latest code!

[27-Aug-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> only 50MB download, with latest code

[27-Aug-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DieserMerlin> Where do I get iostream? I can't compile it because it can't find iostream on my system

[27-Aug-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto  I make my tools work for me.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nice custom release @ITM üôÇ

[27-Aug-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> soon, travis will build stuff

[27-Aug-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just too many things cookin'

[27-Aug-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DieserMerlin> I'm using VS 2017 and QT 5.13

[27-Aug-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> iostream is a core part of C++, unless you speak of boost::iostream

[27-Aug-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which means you don't have boost installed

[27-Aug-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> boost is installed by the build system, tho

[27-Aug-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @DieserMerlin paste the full output of build.sh to a pastebin/github gist, and we can help

[27-Aug-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and maybe let's migrate to #developers

[27-Aug-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi it's a hack!!!! You need a desktop full node, still! But if you can do that, you can extend/pair that to a mobile app!!!!!!

[27-Aug-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto yeah i noticed in the review they kept calling SW a protocol

[27-Aug-19 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh i think he is confusing HushList protocol with Zcash protocol

[27-Aug-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> honest mistake, but making it a clickbaity twitter headline is no bueno

[27-Aug-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i don't think it was malicious, but it's wrong/misleading the way it's worded

[27-Aug-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto ``The so-called ‚ÄòSapling Woodchipper‚Äô is a protocol that allows for DoS attacks on any cryptocurrency which implements the Zcash 2.x Sapling protocol. Most notably, this is what Zcash itself uses.``

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> oh!

[27-Aug-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> he thinks Sapling Woodchiper is a protocol

[27-Aug-19 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gosh, I feel flattered

[27-Aug-19 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> things it's not: a protocol

[27-Aug-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> things it is: a blockchain spam/dust attack, Denial-of-Service, a vastly asymmetric denial-of-service at that. It's not a distributed-denial-of-service, tho. Just plain DoS

[27-Aug-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i wouldnt feel too flattered. they cocked it up

[dscrd-hush] <Earthshaker> Hi. How can i fix the "Could not create the HUSH3.conf" error with SD? I've added a manual conf file, but it doesn't work...shows the same error....

[27-Aug-19 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Earthshaker need to make ~/.komodo directory or compile latest SD
