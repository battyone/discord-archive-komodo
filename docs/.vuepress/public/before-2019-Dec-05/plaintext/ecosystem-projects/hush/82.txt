[11-May-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Another option is renting hashpower, pointing it at a Hush pool and mining it that way. It's not as simple, but may be more cost effective for some people that have the knowledge

[11-May-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `gpus cant do nothing...`
Mine are quite capable of doing nothing

[11-May-19 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> Also, if you meant that 'gpus cant do anything', I'd have to disagree since the total network hashrate of HUSH is 1/10th of what ZEC hashrate was before ASICs came out ü§∑üèΩ

[12-May-19 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH is supported on this new OTC trading platform, Barterlly: https://app.barterlly.io/

[12-May-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> many many coins are supported, and you can avoid the risk of doing manual OTC trades on Discord/telegram/back alleys/etc

[12-May-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Similar to Changelly, but Barterlly has full support for all KMD asset chains, and I believe supports erc20 tokens as well

[12-May-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I helped write a tiny bit of code for Barterlly as well, some code that validates addresses in javascript

[12-May-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's a really cool project, and it's running with 0% trading fees for 2 weeks, so please give it a try and report back here

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I did a test HUSH<>KMD swap months ago and it worked awesome, that was a alpha version of this platform. It was really cool. You send funds to an address, the other person does too, and if everybody sends the right amounts, everybody gets their funds. If not, everybody gets back their funds. And the UI is slick

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> basically you backup your old wallet.dat, copy to new directory, and you must start Hush once with the `-zapwallettxes` option, then after that you just start Hush normally.

[13-May-19 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> @Zatoichi   My post was relevant to your description, it just required some thought  and further education on your end.  BTCP was a fork of ZCL.  In my opinion, ZCL was a copy and paste job  of Zcash by, and again in my opinion, some of the greatest scammers in crypto, eg Rhett Creighton and company (he copied Zcash in its entirety and removed a few line of codes, eg the founders fee, and used envy tactics to convince people that legitimate developed like Vitalik were scamming them with the fee to get victims do dump money into his project).  BTCP was a straight copy of ZCL without much further development in my opinion. There was potentially much more fraudulent activity with respect to BTCP, eg the code had an ‚Äúaccidental flaw‚Äù that resulted in ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù taking advantage of the premine and generating 2 million coins out of nowhere and cratering the price of BTCP.  On this front alone BTCH is superior to BTCP.  No such vulnerability exists in BTCH.

So when you reference technology in relation to BTCP and any coin with any legitimate development, eg BTCH, it sounds suspect to me and it sounds like you may not be aware what you are comparing it to.   BTCH may or may not be dead, but comparing it to something that has almost no technical development of any kind and was probably created with the pure and unadulterared intent to scam people, ie BTCP, is unfair and incomplete.

The net of it is that BTCH has several technical features that BTCP does not have, but that isn‚Äôt saying much.  You implied further development was required for it to catch up. There‚Äôs nothing to catch up to.

Of course, this post is my opinion and should not be interpreted as a statement of fact. If I am wrong on anything I am saying, those with more knowledge can correct me.

[13-May-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Zatoichi> @Hammerstein most part of your post reveals that you basically did not read or did not understand at all what I wrote above. So, I will not comment on most of what you wrote, because you speak about something that is rather of interest or concern to you, that is in my post. I will therefore refrain from further answers to your possible further comments, because it is to no use..  

As far as the btch is concerned, there is a simple method: you shall know them by their fruits/deeds. So, everyone can compare what was the initial positioning, and how much have been done after that. Something very little, in terms of development, may have been done, but the scope of it does not seem to comply well with the initial vision.

[13-May-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Zatoichi what are you really trying to get at?

[13-May-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> what does `comply well with the initial vision` mean ?

[13-May-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> He probably means that the initial vision/goals of BTCH were never completed/achieved.

[13-May-19 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And what are those initial vision/goals? Who stated them and what time limit was given?

[13-May-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> because not done 14.96 seconds after launch = "never" done

[13-May-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTCH was on Sapling before just about every Zcash fork out there, but nobody likes to talk about that. Many Zcash forks are still to this day on vulnerable Sprout stuff

[13-May-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the vision of BTCH included not being built on outdated code with no dev resources

[13-May-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If there is a very specific promise that I made about BTCH, and did not follow up on, let me know. If BTCH is not worth as much as you would like or doesn't have as much developer velocity behind it as you would like, then please pitch in with code or money or time

[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto Agree.  I use to be a huge supporter of Nodejs. Lately to get work done was a pain. So many library changes, messed up packages and versions. 
  I switch to C# Dotnet Core for all my programs.
I use QT and C++ alot for all the huge programs. 
I only use Nodejs adhoc tasks with pm2 manager and for Angular/React Development.

[13-May-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I inherited the hush-ng codebase which was nodeJS, but I am not a js coder nor do I think it's secure to write GUI wallets with nodejs

[13-May-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the nodejs ecosystem changes so fast, all the dependencies of hush-ng have incompat changes and CVEs and nothing works anymore

[13-May-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so it was a quite easy choice to abandon, it no longer works and would take immense energy to get back to working again, and I am 100% not interested in that. So the future for Hush is having Swing + QT based GUI wallets for the desktop

[13-May-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
