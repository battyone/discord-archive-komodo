[dscrd-hush] <M-31> Why no trading on cryptopia?

[09-Dec-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Due to a double spend attack, Cryptopia paused the Hush market on their exchange. You can always open a support ticket to seek further information...

[dscrd-hush] <moessie> Hello people

[09-Dec-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <moessie> I have my hush coins on cryptopia

[09-Dec-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <moessie> What is happening with hush

[09-Dec-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @moessie I have coins in Cryptopia too, we just need to wait for them to get wallets back online and resume markets. You can send them support tickets to ask about HUSH status, maybe that'll light a fire under them. they seem to be prioritizing other higher profile coins unfortunately.

[10-Dec-18 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> It'll light up the fire under the canned response bot. Nothing more.

[10-Dec-18 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> here Good news to start the day with! Tradesatoshi has fixed their wallets so Hush Deposits and Withdrawals are online and working again. Now get back to trading at https://tradesatoshi.com/Exchange?market=HUSH_BTC üòÉ

[10-Dec-18 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Digitalprice has banned the purchase of HUSH, apparently do not want people to buy cheaper and sell more on tradesatoshi. Greedy rascals

[10-Dec-18 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Hush coin rating has improved now on Cryptopia from 2.5/5 to 4/5 as i requested to them to add the mobile wallet, since Hush now has one in Agama(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supernet.agama).

[10-Dec-18 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Now they just need to open the Hush market. Should admit the whole truth (that they set the confirmations too low) on their status update.

[10-Dec-18 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> they responded in 20minutes, must be a new record üòÜ

[10-Dec-18 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Dec-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> lol why does digital price care?

[10-Dec-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Negotiations with getting Cryptopia back online are going well.

[10-Dec-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Keep in mind, like Pixelised and heguli were talking about, the 51% attack occurred due to Cryptopia's low confirmation setting, this attack took place before HUSH 2.0.0 was released.

[10-Dec-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> good to hear that berg, maybe this year we could get Cryptopia online? üòâ

[10-Dec-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> This year as in 2018 or 2019? üòõ

[10-Dec-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I don't like to throw estimations on things, but I'm fairly confident that January will be the month. Don't hold me over a fire on that, but in my own judgement based on how things are progressing that's my estimation.

[10-Dec-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> ok, so at least in this century üòÜ

[10-Dec-18 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Looking forward to btch upgrade

[11-Dec-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> is there a price discussion channel?

[11-Dec-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> DigitalPrice just delisted hush?

[11-Dec-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> ...and all of the balances as well?

[11-Dec-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Did they remove users balances of HUSH? I will be in touch with them to see what's going on, I'd like to have a clear idea of exactly what's happening first.

[11-Dec-18 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> Yes; I can no longer find my balance either

[11-Dec-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> apparently they delisted Hush and that there was an alert on the trading page since september.

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I don't recall seeing an alert on the trading page though, but i could be mistaken...

[11-Dec-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> that was taken from their discord

[11-Dec-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> They are figuring out if there's a way to return Hush back to their owners

[11-Dec-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> i think berg warned us of digital price

[11-Dec-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> üòê

[11-Dec-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Well, there was a notice of delisting.

[11-Dec-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> There was a notice for BTCH being delisted as I recall. Not Hush.

[11-Dec-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Nothing on the Hush trading page.

[11-Dec-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @heguli97 , same. Did not see any notices. There was one for BTCH. None for Hush. As for no volume, last few weeks Hush was top 5!

[11-Dec-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Same for me too @Pixelised i saw the BTCH notice but none for hush, one of their reps did say they are going to figure out if people who've had Hush there can get their coins back.

[11-Dec-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <hushter> I just signed up to Digitalprice the other day solely to trade HUSH. I sent them my Hush and before it confirmed they delisted it. And they haven't returned my coins or my emails.  Typical.

[11-Dec-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <hushter> And I saw no notice either.

[11-Dec-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> They do seem like reasonable people though

[11-Dec-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @hushter you can try contacting them through discord

[11-Dec-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <hushter> @heguli97  thanks I'll try that

[11-Dec-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I sent there 20 hush last month on the 23rd and it never reached my wallet, their wallets must've been offline by then

[11-Dec-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <hushter> Well it was sort of online the other day because it did show X number of confirmations on my test deposit, which I sent before sending the bulk of my coins.

[11-Dec-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <hushter> I sent them over 38,000 HUSH so I'm a little ticked.

[11-Dec-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Ouch, I saw your message on their discord, hope they can return your coins üò≥

[11-Dec-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> As I said they do seem like reasonable guys

[11-Dec-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> "little ticked"... lol

[12-Dec-18 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Wow

[12-Dec-18 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> That‚Äôs a lot of hush

[12-Dec-18 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Do you have that much btch too?

[12-Dec-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> 38k hush üòÆ

[12-Dec-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @badenglishtea had a lot more.

[12-Dec-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> DP seem like a fly by night operation after what happened with Hush. No notice and claiming there is no volume. And they want develpers (who work for free) to pay them to update their own exchange to make it more secure (Hush with dpow). They must like running an unpatched Windows 95 PC these days. lol

[12-Dec-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> I'll be taking the remaining funds I have on there and forgetting about using them ever again. They delist coins with no or little notice (none on the Hush market as they claim). Too unreliable.

[12-Dec-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Pixelised is correct in stating that BTCH had a warning posted for delisting, HUSH never had that on the exchange page.

[13-Dec-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> If you had Hush on digitalprice.io there's now a way to get them back. 

From digitalprice.io:
"Everyone We have hooked up HUSH wallet locally and imported all the exchange addresses, if you have HUSH to claim please open a ticket.
1. Open a ticket
2. Specify nickname/email in the ticket
3. Amount of coins (if you remember) if not i can verify this.

Regards
Claudio"

[13-Dec-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <nicklikestuna> Have we ever thought of how to fund Hush? Besides the BTCH purse

[13-Dec-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @nicklikestuna in order to get Hush on more exchanges we have been exploring the option of getting a legal opinion about the HUSH coin so we could apply to large exchanges like Bittrex, Coinbase etc. However working with Lawyers is expensive. If we were to open a BTC wallet, would the community be willing to donate so we could get things moving? We would need at the very least 1-2 BTC

[13-Dec-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <nicklikestuna> Worth a shot. Of course visibility/ traceability would have to be somehow managed. I'll happily contribute.

[13-Dec-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Awesome thanks @nicklikestuna. I'll talk to @Berg & @dukeleto  about getting one set up

[13-Dec-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <nicklikestuna> I'm happy to help with pre legal advice information (not advice, but to help make sure we cover the right points) as I'm also a lawyer though based in Australia.

[13-Dec-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <nicklikestuna> But funding takes precedence. The only difference between those that make it out alive and don't is keeping the lights on

[13-Dec-18 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @heguli97 , the ironic thing here with sending all that those held Hush on the DP exchange what they are owed; dealing with all the open support tickets, emails, discord messages, working out who needs their Hush sent to their external wallet, double checking all that, etc, etc - it would probably cost them more in man hours doing all that than just upgrading their Hush backend... lol

[dscrd-hush] <gigoplast> i'm curious , when the next circulation supply . just for fun i made a calculation:   the block height number  X  the block reward = the current circulation supply .  430408√ó12.5=5380100   . just for fun üòÖ  thinking every block was mined ü§î

[14-Dec-18 06:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> no reason to discuss price right now, I've lost a lot of money on Hush, but it was just my bad investment - my own responsibility. Dont think it will recover any time soon (and high chances never - lesson learned?). Bought Hush when it was 2$ for about 2 BTC at that time and been stupidly hodling :/

@Gordon Komodo What are you referring to? their hard fork or cryptopia situation?

[14-Dec-18 10:05 AM] heguli97#5781
Sorry, the link didn't go to a specific message previously, now it linked correctlyüòÉ. 

Hush didn't have a very long lasting 51% attack, i remember it being in the tens of blocks and the reason it happened was mainly because Cryptopia had set such a low amount of confirmations(20) when it should've been much higher for a small coin like Hush. 

but we have heard back from Cryptopia and currently it's looking like they'll be reopening markets/wallets in around Januaryü§û  and looking at the charts there wasn't a huge dump in price so the loss for Cryptopia should be minimal.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã üëç for a responsibility statement. Anybody had a chance for a better trading. But don't worry, HUSH will eventuelly go above 2$ (and much higher). It's just the metter it will not happen tomorrow, it will happen in the next real bull run. When I say real run I mean it real run, not just a small bounces. But it's the whole story if HUSH will rise higher and faster than other coins. All of them will rise, just like in 2017, but they will rise at different rates. So everybody keep calm, market bottom will occur quickly, it is just a matter of weeks. From the bottom on life will be slightly easier.
