if by "seed" you mean passphrase, this is not possible; you altered something in your entry

[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @ComputerGenie - MineHush.com  i dont understand what you mean with last

[27-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> U remember your password ?

[27-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> yes

[27-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> now i just transfered 1200 hush from a friend of mine

[27-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> We think it's  a user issue.   Not a system issue.   We are trying to help you.

[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> on verus wallet

[27-Jun-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> closed everything...

[27-Jun-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> @Roxin discord will not let me show what I meant
if you add or subtract a space, it will change the output
other than that the same input will always produce the same output

[27-Jun-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> put just the password (without seephrase) which i put it when i create the wallet and now it shows me 1200 hush

[27-Jun-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Jun-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> but with same password, why now it shows me the coins what i just transfered right now, and the coins what i transfered in 19 june doesnt show..and alsio show me another addres

[27-Jun-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Maybe you chose wrong hush

[27-Jun-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Please go to community support in verus discord

[27-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> They said they will help you

[27-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `and alsio show me another addres`
2 different addresses will __never__ come from the same litemode passphrase

[27-Jun-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> and look, it is normal the txbit.io exchange to gave me for hush the same address that verus agama wallet gaved me ?

[27-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Roxin.  Have you rebooted your xomputer

[27-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Reboot your xomputer and try it again

[27-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Or try it on another computer

[27-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Maybe something is wrong with your windows clipboard

[27-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I tested txtbit.io and nothing was wrong with their system

[27-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> damn...i will install my windows again...and check after

[27-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> You don't have to reinstall windows

[27-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> but is normal that txbit.io exchange to give me the same hush address like verus agama wallet ?

[27-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Just reboot your computer

[27-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <[txbit.io]Andy(viscolex)> Just want to chime in. I think the computer is infected. As per @Roxin example above, he shares what BTC address he received after clicking Copy Address and apparently he gets "19A26nPRjStR25RPVWFZL5iMn5PgXYVtDT"

This is a P2PKH legacy address that we don't use in Txbit at all.

[27-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <[txbit.io]Andy(viscolex)> All our of addresses start with a "3..."

[27-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I think he is pasting that 19 number into agama as his key

[27-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> His clipboard is not changing

[27-Jun-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> what im pasting ?

[27-Jun-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> so..i enter

[27-Jun-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> where agama ask me for

[27-Jun-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> wallet seed / wif

[27-Jun-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> i put my backup code..my secret phrase formed like this

[27-Jun-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> : triangle eyes nothing google table etc etc etc etc etc etc

[27-Jun-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> after i put my password

[27-Jun-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> That is your seed

[27-Jun-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> yes

[27-Jun-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Verus can help you

[27-Jun-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> There's also what's called a key

[27-Jun-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> It's a string similar to your address

[27-Jun-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> And you can export that key once you are in

[27-Jun-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> and where i find that key ? because i use lite mode

[27-Jun-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I'm not too familiar.  But I think the seed phrase is specific to agama

[27-Jun-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Maybe you need to confirm with them the version they use

[27-Jun-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> They can help you in their community support

[27-Jun-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> i write there...

[27-Jun-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> but look @AkiraX

[27-Jun-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> is normal that txbit.io exchange to generate the same address like verus agama wallet for hush deposit ?

[27-Jun-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> The txtbir guy said it's not coming from. Txtbit

[27-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I'd try it on another xomputer

[27-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> ok..but what i mean is ...is normal that an exchange like binance to say to generate the same addres for bitcoin (for example) like a bitcoin windows wallet

[27-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> ?

[27-Jun-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> because my txbit.io account generate me the same address for hush like verus wallet

[27-Jun-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Good luck. I gotta go

[27-Jun-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> thanks

[27-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> _thinks it's probably related to the_
`:`

[27-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <[txbit.io]Andy(viscolex)> The hush addresses are different between Txbit and verus wallet. There is no issue there

[27-Jun-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Panho> some thieving software replaces the address in the clipboard. One can only hope that this is not your case, @Roxin    😬

[27-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> The funds are still in his address, so I'm doubtful that's the case.. I would still recover and move the funds to Silent Dragon

[27-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @Berg  yesterday i have that problem when i check bitcoin address from txbit.io with the address from bitcoin wallet windows...and was different address

[27-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> and i told them...and 2day was the same address

[27-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> something is not good i swear..im not crazy

[27-Jun-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <[txbit.io]Andy(viscolex)> You Selected this text and click copy (CLTR+V, or right-click>copy), right? You didn't use a button to copy the address

[27-Jun-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <[txbit.io]Andy(viscolex)> So... the address got replaced in your Clipboard

[27-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> but i swear yesterday something was different...because the address started with another letter...

[27-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @Panho  where do you know that information ?

[27-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> im not crazy, i had coins on cryptopia , and since then its not the 1st time i send from an exchange to windows wallet

[27-Jun-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Railrain> Always check the copied address. reaction at the reflex level 😐

[27-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <[txbit.io]Andy(viscolex)> Yes. The malware that replaces Bitcoin addresses in in the clipboard is all over the place

[27-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <[txbit.io]Andy(viscolex)> Double and triple check every address you copy and paste.

[27-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @[txbit.io]Andy(viscolex)  and what if that happend in my case with hush ? what can i do ?
