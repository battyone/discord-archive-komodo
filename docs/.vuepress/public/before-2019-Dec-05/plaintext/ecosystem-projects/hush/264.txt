[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Visualizing all that for somebody is not trivial or easy

[20-Oct-19 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh i think ITM is busy, but he probably has some examples. i feel like maybe he shared some already

[20-Oct-19 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> When i installed HUSH i saw it was downloading from some servers in Texas and some OVH servers in Paris. 

In the future, if someone wanted to use HUSH to communicate, how trivial would it be for an authority to block HUSH messages from being transmitted. 

Is all that's needed is a connection to at least one miner? (in the full version when it's completed)

[20-Oct-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @1112 sounds like you want to use Tor

[20-Oct-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH needs to talk to it's p2p peers, and those could be anywhere

[20-Oct-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @1112 you can use `-onlynet=onion` to force Hush to only use Tor, or you can use something like TAILS that forces all connections to be Tor

Anyway, this thread is about cybersecurity. Whenever people don't want to do a thing, they convince themselves that the threat is only "theoretical". It leads to perpetual-motion like conversations where it's impossible to convince them the threat is "practical".

Bitcoin Core is experimenting with fetching headers over DNS as a censorship-resistance feature:

This is definitely something I will eye to pull into $HUSH when it's ready and since we already have Rust in our codebase, we are happy to add more ...

[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> I have a question regarding t->t and t->z memo sending - is the memo for t-t tx visible publicly (no encyrption) ? encryption is working only on z-z ? and regrding z-z encryption - how it is being decrypted? wallet does decryption using private key ?

[21-Oct-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is no memos in recipients which are taddrs, such at t=>t but also z=>t and z=>(z,t) etc.

[21-Oct-19 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, wallet does decryption of memos to a given zaddr via the private key of the zaddr

[21-Oct-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tip.cc> :HUSH: @dukeleto sent @DigitalMiner - Digital49er, @fer.lab, @Ilya | Genesis Lab, @j62, @Milo, @nut and @tvle83 **5.00 HUSH** (≈ $0.17) each :cloud_rain:.
*Use `!tip nomention` to stop being pinged by tips.*

[21-Oct-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> One simple idea i suggest for Silent Dragon is an option to force the display of all digits, so that a user can choose to see 100.000000 hush and 2.334455 and immediately see that the 100 is bigger because the decimal places align.

[21-Oct-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @1112 in which screen, the main balances screen?

[21-Oct-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i know we have some issues where the amount box is not wide enough

[21-Oct-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> such that large amounts with many digits of precision do not show correctly

[21-Oct-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> such as 123445454.46564565

[21-Oct-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> The balances and transactions. Yes now that i think about it,  yes some issue like that is probably the reason it is this way for now.

[21-Oct-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, i noticed this bug recently too

[21-Oct-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the width of the amount field is too small

[21-Oct-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> needs to be at least ~20 characters or this bug happens

[21-Oct-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @1112 can you make a github issue for this on :SD: repo?

[21-Oct-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> Thanks for the vote of confidence, but I am nothing like a developer or coder. just a user.  the most code i know is copy-paste

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Good evening 🙂

[21-Oct-19 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Hey @Berg & @dukeleto, have you heard of any other cryptocurrencies that have discord tipping to random users, but only chooses from those that really participate? 
I wouldn't mind if I got 0. That's not my concern. I see people pop in just to say hi, check their balance, and go.

[21-Oct-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I agree 🙂 It's important to bring new people around,  but also reward those that have been here 🙂

[21-Oct-19 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We do tip people directly, but there is a way to tip those that are recently active in a channel, I believe

[21-Oct-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> !tip a random user active last 100 messages 0.2 HUSH

[21-Oct-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tip.cc> :HUSH: @Berg sent @Crypto99 **0.20 HUSH** (≈ $0.0068).
