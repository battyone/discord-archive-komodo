[22-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> I know is maybe some kind of romantic... But we believe in democratic system nowadays

[22-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> I do to. It's hard to set the rules tho

[22-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Concerned me a little that other big states goes the opposite direction

[22-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Not everyone has to oppose the US Military, if they protest

[22-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> And local police department

[22-Sep-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> And swat

[22-Sep-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> It's unfathomable

[22-Sep-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> What they do in France, you couldn't do here for a day

[22-Sep-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> What they do in HK, nope

[22-Sep-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Did u know that local US police depts, spend millions on privacy breaking tech each year?

[22-Sep-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Stingrays

[22-Sep-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Finding a role for Hush in all of this, would be nice

[22-Sep-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> That's crazy... After 9/11 a lot went crazy  from a outside view in the US

[22-Sep-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Not really

[22-Sep-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Intelligence operations worldwide, yeah

[22-Sep-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Domestic, yeah

[22-Sep-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> The citizens, the same as before

[22-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> That's not crazy?

[22-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Well there was a major attack

[22-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> In the world's biggest city

[22-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> And it killed and even caused a lot of victims to get cancer

[22-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> From the smoke

[22-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> What would you do?

[22-Sep-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Take it

[22-Sep-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Puuhh not a easy question... But spy and bomb the world would maybe not my answer

[22-Sep-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Well if the US didn't have to take the world's stage post world war 2, which we shouldn't be in that position politically, then we aren't policing the world like we have to

[22-Sep-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> US is isolated. We are better off focusing on us.

[22-Sep-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> But it is what it is

[22-Sep-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Bc everyone has an opinion on how we should do it

[22-Sep-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> It's probably not easy

[22-Sep-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> No it's hard to answer. But why are the US isolated? You have more friends in Europe then you know. Sometimes it's just hard to understand your goals

[22-Sep-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> We are isolated geographically

[22-Sep-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> And Europeans like to deal with other Europeans

[22-Sep-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Canada?

[22-Sep-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Mexiko?

[22-Sep-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> What about them

[22-Sep-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Our goal is to have a war-free Europe

[22-Sep-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> We also focus on Latin America & Mexico and Canada

[22-Sep-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> And we don't want the Chinese building man made islands in the South Pacific

[22-Sep-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> ðŸ˜‚

[22-Sep-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Has Europe had a major war in 75 years?

[22-Sep-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Kosovo was the last

[22-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Sure. But I mean a large conflict spread throughout Europe

[22-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> You guys have had stability

[22-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> To grow and do whatever

[22-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Who else in the World has had that

[22-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Africa? No

[22-Sep-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Middle East? No

[22-Sep-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> US cares about Europe

[22-Sep-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[22-Sep-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Kosovo

[22-Sep-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Serbia

[22-Sep-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> No, I read. I don't pay attention to the media

[22-Sep-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> So there was a major conflict spread throughout Europe, at one time, in a 2-5 year period?

[22-Sep-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> I meant it prevented another world war.. another devestating conflict

[22-Sep-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Maybe I'm wrong

[22-Sep-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> No you are not wrong

[22-Sep-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Yeah, it's ashamed

[22-Sep-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Conflict is not the way

[22-Sep-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> That's why I haven't minded trump

[22-Sep-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Bc the drones have stopped for the most part

[22-Sep-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> And no new major war

[22-Sep-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Who was that guy?

[22-Sep-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <denio> Yip

[22-Sep-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> You don't judge the way other cultures live.

[22-Sep-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> It's hard to not do, but it is fair, to an extent

[22-Sep-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Maybe that works for them

[22-Sep-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> I'm not saying it's right.
