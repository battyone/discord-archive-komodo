[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> well, that is just what some people want/think

[04-Oct-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Writing open source software is well-protected by Freedom of Speech laws in the US, within reason

[04-Oct-19 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Including malicious softwares ?

[04-Oct-19 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @phm87 who decides who/what is malicious ?

[04-Oct-19 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Freedom of Speech doesn't have a "unless it's malicious" clause

[04-Oct-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @phm87 maybe I missed something

[04-Oct-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> are you worried for me?

[04-Oct-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> No

[04-Oct-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Writing exploits is not illegal

[04-Oct-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> at least not in the US, yet

[04-Oct-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I found 9 leaks in yiimp. I could share it then ppl can steal. I think that I can have pbs then. I did not shared publicly, we fixed yiimp and warn zpool. Few other pools warned took months to update

[04-Oct-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> WhenI was young, I found leaks in websites of companies, they did not respond to my emails so I asked journalists to push them to fix their shit

[04-Oct-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> None of these actions were paid but I guess that I can be responsible if I share how to exploit before the fix

[04-Oct-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> (I am talking about sql injections to get your wif. I don t think that the privacy leak matters compared to coins stolen)

[04-Oct-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Yes, SQLi was fun before most people had heard of it üôÇ

[04-Oct-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It was all over once XKCD made a comic about it

[04-Oct-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in the late 90's, gosh, you could just use 1 SQLi to own an entire company

[04-Oct-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> via the beauty of these new "web sites"

[04-Oct-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @phm87 you can get paid for your work, it's not easy, but possible

[04-Oct-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> http://hackerone.com and it's competitors/etc

[04-Oct-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Crackers paid me for some coding

[04-Oct-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> crackers gonna crack, miners gonna mine

[04-Oct-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Lol

[04-Oct-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Can I ask you in private what is your hourly rate ?

[04-Oct-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i don't charge hourly for code, because that rarely works

[04-Oct-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I charge people at least $100/hr to talk to me on the phone. Otherwise, I don't do phone calls, so there is that

[04-Oct-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> code is project-based

[04-Oct-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I only charge hourly in real life. Always been fixed price in crypto for me

[04-Oct-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I can tell most people have not actually read the new Zcash paper, because they are not talking about the amazing stuff in it that the authors didn't focus on

[04-Oct-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> wasnt that patched already?

[04-Oct-19 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh did you see KMD merge the patch and push binaries out to the entire network yet?

[04-Oct-19 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh yeah, I added dpowconfs to CHIPS and fixed random bugs, wrote the `build.sh` and lots of stuff I have forgotten

[04-Oct-19 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's fascinating to me that because ECC released a source code fix, and we have a few patches flying around on Github, that is "patched and fixed"

[04-Oct-19 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> good lord, no

[04-Oct-19 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> until the next mandatory hardfork update, there will definitely be vulnerable nodes on the network

[04-Oct-19 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because who upgrades all the time?

[04-Oct-19 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh so seriously, you think you are patched because a patch exists on Github which is not yet merged, not yet made into a binary and you have not yet downloaded it?

[04-Oct-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the entire zcash protocol world is still vulnerable. There is still no binaries for Zcash mainnet, even

[04-Oct-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> No GUI wallets

[04-Oct-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> No nothin'. So no, nothing is "patched" in production @gigamesh üòâ

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> in other news, looks like the first snow just came here, lovely.

[05-Oct-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto so youre unimpressed cause networks are taking too long to roll out the patches/release binaries and perhaps mostly cause the updates are not mandatory or not being treated seriously enough?

[05-Oct-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> arent the updates mandatory and dont nodes have a deadline (blockheight) to update by?

[05-Oct-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> more specifically what is the condition of the ARRR network and the HUSH network?

[05-Oct-19 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> Are all HUSH nodes updated or is the update connected to KMD somehow:

[05-Oct-19 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> > did you see KMD merge the patch and push binaries out to the entire network

[05-Oct-19 12:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> thanks @dukeleto -- if you could clarify the issue you have that would be helpful

[05-Oct-19 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @denio He is a Finn. In 2019 winter came late.

[05-Oct-19 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> what I personally didn't like about the security breach was how it was handled. In my opinion, you are responsible for your users...especially if you claim to be a "real" privacy coin. For me, this means that if you have no idea how to fix the hole, you warn your users! Say: Be careful, people, your data is currently being leaked. If you want privacy please stick to the behavior rule x at the moment (or maybe don't use it at all until it's fixed). The excuse "everyone who wants privacy has a vpn anyway" I find not only weak, but rather authistic!

[05-Oct-19 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> btw. thats why i think duke was right when he openly discuss this

[05-Oct-19 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
