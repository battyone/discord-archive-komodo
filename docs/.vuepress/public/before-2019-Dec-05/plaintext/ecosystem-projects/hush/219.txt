[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all Rust

[10-Sep-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Being serious?

[10-Sep-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's brand new

[10-Sep-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just came out, hours ago

[10-Sep-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> U like it

[10-Sep-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I saw it earlier

[10-Sep-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but also seems to be a last ditch marketing effort from ECC

[10-Sep-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> something to make people think they should be paid more FR money

[10-Sep-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> HushDroid more exciting

[10-Sep-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi yes

[10-Sep-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> more practical

[10-Sep-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Halo means no params at all, not even 50MB

[10-Sep-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Real world use case

[10-Sep-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But Hush already has that.

[10-Sep-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We embed our 50MB params in our Git repo, and put them in binary zips. Donezo

[10-Sep-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We will change how people message

[10-Sep-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> have the .pdf loaded, but the math is too deep

[10-Sep-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash is making up a whole new recursive zksnark

[10-Sep-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c yeah, they like to shroud themselves in math to entice the big investors

[10-Sep-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c i haven't looked at the Rust yet

[10-Sep-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i am sure there are good ideas here

[10-Sep-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but $1.1M USD/month of good ideas?

[10-Sep-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> No.

[10-Sep-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Nuh uh

[10-Sep-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> $1.1k

[10-Sep-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if anything, they have given lots of awesome ideas for free, which we can pick from

[10-Sep-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think this is a relatively smart way for them to try to get more money, at least this is legit research

[10-Sep-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Do they take requests? lol

[10-Sep-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's something you want to see. But too little, too late, ya know?

[10-Sep-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Yeah

[10-Sep-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Like 9 months ago

[10-Sep-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> When the year looked like it could possibly end up negative

[10-Sep-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, when you shrink stuff down to pure sapling, 50MB doesn't mean anything

[10-Sep-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They choose to have the financial part, so we have to judge it... they havent done so well

[10-Sep-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for Zcash to use that technique, it would have to change to a new mainnet

[10-Sep-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no way to change the past, which has Sprout joinsplits and Sapling joinsplits

[10-Sep-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they can add new stuff in the future, but the past is the past

[10-Sep-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this tech is great for KMD, who can spin up chains whenever

[10-Sep-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Block.one (EOS) gave Peter Thiel a 6324% return, on a 1-yr investment

[10-Sep-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> ECC can't handle finances ...

[10-Sep-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They have to keep the pre-Sapling?

[10-Sep-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Or start all over?

[10-Sep-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> basically do an airdrop to a new chain like Hush did

[10-Sep-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> keep all balances

[10-Sep-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but wipe all transaction history

[10-Sep-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> start fresh with transaction history and UTXO set

[10-Sep-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but give people same balances to same addresses

[10-Sep-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that way, no backward compatability to old transaction types is necessary

[10-Sep-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is why Hush does not need to support *anything* Sprout related

[10-Sep-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Pirate still has sprout code to deal with old sprout transactions. It's just disabled in new transactions

[10-Sep-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so when you sync Pirate, the first few months of Sprout xtns take much more CPU, and require the 1.6GB download

[10-Sep-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> once you get past those, it's just Sapling stuff, only 50MB of downloads for those

[10-Sep-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but since they are in the history, it's not simple for Pirate to do what Hush did. They can do something similar, but have to choose between a few different technical choices

[10-Sep-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Bandwidth isn't always do easy to come by

[10-Sep-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Privacy shouldn't be hindered by bandwidth, if possible ... Not everyone in the world have cable dsl or fiber optic...t1

[10-Sep-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Internet is expensive AF in some countries.

[10-Sep-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I like the HUSH modification. Very considerate for those that might lack the resources.

[10-Sep-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi Hush superlite wallet (which can't do zaddr+memos, just plain taddrs) takes no bandwidth at all

[10-Sep-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so we have some options

[10-Sep-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i think it was measured to use about 4MB per day of bandwidth, a KMD superlite wallet

[10-Sep-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most of the interest of Hush is zaddrs. But if you are purely a trader, and want to move Hush around, superlite wallets are very nice

[10-Sep-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that tweet is so hot, getting so many RT's

@ElectricCoinCo @ebfull @str4d @feministPLT is it possible to use this new (very cool) discovery on the current Zcash mainnet (via some future Network Upgrade) or does it require an entirely new mainnet which does not contain any old transaction types?

[10-Sep-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ECC probably doesn't want to really go into details about that stuff, but it needs to be clear

[10-Sep-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and I guess it's my job to make sure ðŸ˜…

[10-Sep-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They are funding their forks indirectly

[10-Sep-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Zooko doesn't think they can fail.
And these new projects won't utilize the tech, like we could have.

[10-Sep-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> He's trying to screw miners twice

[10-Sep-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I have filled it out 3+ times. Doesn't hurt to keep pinging them i guess, but we've never received any correspondence from them. I've even DM'ed them on Twitter, which I was told is their most responsive account. No dice so far, but I would love to see HUSH listed on TO

[10-Sep-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @pal I have sent in this form 3 times as well. They do not seem to respond to it. But lets all keep trying. Thank you for the effot :hush_puppy:

[dscrd-hush] <pal> Berg, would you mind to share with me your response? I manage a few large groups and I can get some more people to fill it gradually, but not like a spamming process

[10-Sep-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> I just told TO that Hush is as good as Pirate, so why not us

[10-Sep-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Sep-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> As far as why the coin needs to be added, be creative, be honest, explain why you believe they should add Hush :)
dPoW keeps exchanges protected from 51% attacks
Our privacy technology is bleeding edge, HushList, zkSNARKS, encrypted memos, pictures, and files
Active development team
Pure Sapling chain
KMD Ecosystem

lots of reasons ðŸ™‚

[10-Sep-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> The coin should be added to tradeogre, bc they are an exchange, and we are a project. We think that they run a respectable exchange. And we would be happy in assisting with any technical issues, in getting the wallet up, on their end ....

[10-Sep-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We have a good history. 
We have good tech and a good community.
If that isn't sufficient, then oh well.

[10-Sep-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Maybe we should step it up on DP

[10-Sep-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Maybe we could ask, for these pairings..
HUSH-ARRR
HUSH-VRSC
HUSH-LTC

[10-Sep-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm personally not a fan of DP, but if people wanted to try they definitely can ðŸ™‚

[10-Sep-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> __
LTC bc it has major liquidity outside of dp & $0 fees.
The other two, I think could generate a lot of vol

[10-Sep-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> If BTC goes higher, the fee to send to DP will go up in USD

[10-Sep-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Them using Agama as their secure wallet was kind of a nail in the coffin when they got hacked

[10-Sep-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Plus they delisted us without warning and a good amount of people lost coins

[10-Sep-19 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> The other two pairings mine a lot
Look at ARRR-KMD

[10-Sep-19 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Hush isn't on DP?

[10-Sep-19 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
