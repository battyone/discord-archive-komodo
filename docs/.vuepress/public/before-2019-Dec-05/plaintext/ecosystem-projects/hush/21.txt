[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg YOU ARE LEGIT, son

[15-Nov-18 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Took them a while, I re-applied for the 3rd time yesterday. I guess pestering does work 😊

[15-Nov-18 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg this is good timing, we can send out a signal for mandatory upgrades, exchange listing and other fun stuff. People love to read something more than just red numbers all day 😹

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't always agree with Peter K Todd, but lately I am loving him because he calls Zooko out on the crazy stuff that comes out of him and ZcashCo: https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1062847331949699072

@zooko I'm going to reply here because this isn't a security issue in the normal sense. We're not fixing a vulnerability here, we're fixing an embarrassing lack of record keeping that only shows potential incompetence or fraud.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> posting DM's of Zooko, against his will, like a boss. But also, Zooko, I believe, was not telling the whole truth.

@NicklasBaesler @zooko I had extensive communication with the journalist they hired about the contents of the hard drive.

This is why I find that claim that they "don't remember" so ridiculous - they were paying someone for months to go over that data. It'd take early Alz...

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg sometimes rando trending hashtags give me artistic proclivities

[16-Nov-18 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Broseph> Any news about when HUSH will start trading again?

[16-Nov-18 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> No new news about Cryptopia if that's what you mean, They responded to us recently after sending no response for a while. So that is better than them completely ignoring us.

[16-Nov-18 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @Broseph On Digitalprice you can buy/sell

[16-Nov-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @svetulechekk no thanks

[16-Nov-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Broseph> What’s the name of the group on telegram?

[17-Nov-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Someone got some Hush cheap at 518 to  1000 sats.

[17-Nov-18 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> on Digitalprice.

[17-Nov-18 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Telegram group is currently unmonitored

[17-Nov-18 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> So I'd personally advise staying in here.

[17-Nov-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RemoteConTroll> @dukeleto  cool

[19-Nov-18 06:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> anyone here

[19-Nov-18 06:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> need some wallet help

[19-Nov-18 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> nvm got it

[19-Nov-18 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Broseph> Any update on HUSH coin?

[19-Nov-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <daanoontjeh> Well, its time to hibernate 😄

[19-Nov-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> how long did it take to transfer BTCH to coinexchange

[19-Nov-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> it did it last night it's been almost 8 hours

[19-Nov-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it shouldn't take that long, is coinexchange's wallet working?

[19-Nov-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> So, what is everyone's stances on BTC projections to $1.5K USD?

[19-Nov-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I saw BTC go from $1 to $30 back to $1 in a few days, that was "the end of Bitcoin" at the time

[19-Nov-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> everybody freaks out when it drops 10% now

[19-Nov-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i see we are down to $5K, those bears are happy

[19-Nov-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i think these dips are at least somewhat related to people spending lots of BTC for the BCH hashwars

[19-Nov-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Honestly i don't think we'll go that low, i'm guessing we could see 4k$ at some point though

[19-Nov-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> to sell BCH for your local fiat, you still go thru BTC very often

[19-Nov-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BCH -> BTC -> local fiat -> hash war

[19-Nov-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's like a very large sell pressure, with no corresponding buy pressure

[19-Nov-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i think a lot of GPU miners checked blockfolio today, cried, and turned off all their rigs

[19-Nov-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this bear market is meant to shake out the weak hands, so the wealthiest can get the best deal on BTC, and sell back to the masses as our entire world converts to digital currencies

[19-Nov-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> from my arm chair, that is what I see.

[19-Nov-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Market will bottomat 3k in 1+ month. History repeats itself.

[19-Nov-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @dukeleto any progress with BTCH? Any vision of future development? Anything? And HUSH?

[19-Nov-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules verushash option has not landed in KMD yet, which is needed to create new BTCH chain

[19-Nov-18 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush 2.0.1 will come out soon, which adds dpowconfs, and will be a required update. I am also working on some other stuff that I can't talk much about now 😃

[19-Nov-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> OK, what about any specific purpose of use? What will be the main difference between BTCH and familliar coins? Maybe it will solve any problem other coins haven't?

[19-Nov-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> @dukeleto

[19-Nov-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> and on coinexchange it's stuck on 2/20 for almsot 12 hours too

[19-Nov-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> that screenshot is from AGAM wallet

[19-Nov-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> any idea why it's stuck

[19-Nov-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm also working on onboarding Hush for Blockfolio signaling 😉

[19-Nov-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <arton> @KillahJon  - blocks are generated as they needed, i've just made few transactions. Check now the number of confirmations

[19-Nov-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> ah, the on demand system 😃

[19-Nov-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> thanks it worked!

[19-Nov-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> :aengrythonk:

[19-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @KillahJon yes, we can see on coinexchange. Thanks!

[19-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> lol

[19-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> my cousin wanted to rid of his

[19-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> i still have mine

[19-Nov-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> he dumped for cheap

[19-Nov-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Next time seeking for instructions at least erase amount completely. There are still some digits half-visiable and it's possible to see the number of digits before dots. Thank you, I was able to lower my orders in time (you don't have to tell your cousin).

[19-Nov-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> oo thanks'

[19-Nov-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Berg you got yours? Or blue donkey ate all the funds?

[19-Nov-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Still have all my crypto investments 😃

[19-Nov-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> My car fund is in NYSE/NASDAQ 😃

[19-Nov-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Which if BTC falls to $3K will all get converted over into BTC 😃

[19-Nov-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Most of the work I do on my car is just me working in my garage, I spend money on sheet metal and gasses and whatnot, but until I buy a new motor entirely, self-bodywork is cheap.

[19-Nov-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> In december/january keep an eye on ETH. Bottom supports are 100 and 90 USD respectively. And it is an annual ETH run compared to BTC from january on.

[19-Nov-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> You think ETH is a safe bet for January?

[19-Nov-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I haven't personally followed them much since I last cashed out.

[19-Nov-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I knew there was a lot of turmoil and insecurity over ETH in the past few months, I'll have to do my research on what that was all about.

[19-Nov-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Yes, I think it is a safe bet. I will go into. But gains will not be as high as we are used to. I expect we will break BTC 6200 USD resistance only in next autumn.

[19-Nov-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Until than I just hope KillahJon has some more cousins...

[19-Nov-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Ahahahaha

[19-Nov-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah I'll definitely continue to average as things come down

[19-Nov-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Not a single green in the top 100

[19-Nov-18 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> no more lol

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> See, soon it will be 1/2 of your crypto value. Cross fingers that Cryptopia will not enable trading before summer.

[19-Nov-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Nov-18 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I think you're thinking wrong 😉

[19-Nov-18 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I can guarantee you that the team and I are working very hard on rectifying Cryptopia's situation.

[19-Nov-18 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Nov-18 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @KillahJon cousin still has his HUSH?

[19-Nov-18 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> It would be nice to know in time.

[19-Nov-18 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Nov-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
