[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> I didn't say I like it, just pointing that it's the largest exception to the inverse "rule"

[25-Jul-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> as tho Vitalik came up with it all......

[25-Jul-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> the irony is that my biggest issue with ETH is almost entirely unlikely to be able to happen again

[25-Jul-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> _is not a fan of mutable transactions_

[25-Jul-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i remember after theDAO

[25-Jul-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> everybody shitting pants

[25-Jul-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> and then Vitailik rolls up

[25-Jul-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> "100&% in ETH" (not ETC)

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> fucker

[25-Jul-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> done with that shit

[25-Jul-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> imo, if it isn't related to consensus code, then it isn't the business of devs to determine who's "allowed" to have/keep what

[25-Jul-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> theDAO vote was a bailout

[25-Jul-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> end of

[25-Jul-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> 3rd party site gets hacked, sucks but not chain related

[25-Jul-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> the only ones who voted were those who stood to lose money..... fuck "immutability"

[25-Jul-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> yes, that

[25-Jul-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> it was a dark day

[25-Jul-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> tell u what tho... the "banks" loved it

[25-Jul-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> "finally... a crypto we can roll(back) with'

[25-Jul-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> lol

[25-Jul-19 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> ask "safecoin" how many times they've rolled back their chain (even before the 1st safe.trade hack) :troll:

[25-Jul-19 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> cryptojebus? where art thou?

[25-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> and look at how much legit mined SAFE coinage is still locked by code

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> Gentlepeople, I had a couple drinks to celeb HUSH in a pre-party I made. I cannot emphasize this enuff....

[25-Jul-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> HUSH is THE most undervalued project in crypto

[25-Jul-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> HANDS DOWN

[25-Jul-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh there is a zaddr in the memo I sent you üòÉ

[25-Jul-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> LOL

[25-Jul-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> lets do this

[25-Jul-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is what allows 2-way memo communication

[25-Jul-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> otherwise, memos are anonymous

[25-Jul-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> when you send the transaction, you can right click on the bottom left of the GUI, to go to the transaction on the explorer or copy link

[25-Jul-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You can give links to both transactions in your article, as proof that you tested this shit and it actually works. Not many coins have working code üëº

[25-Jul-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh good job getting thru all the bullshit to get a binary working on your system, many would have given up!

[25-Jul-19 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh SD will also show you the QR code for your zaddr, if you want to list that as well

[25-Jul-19 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we don't have great QR code support in mobile Hush wallets right now, but why not put it there for the future? Mobile wallets are coming

[25-Jul-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
