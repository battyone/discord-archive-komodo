[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I want to support the poor, unbanked and oppressed. I am not interested in helping people who already have all the power. They will do what they want, anyway

[03-Dec-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Exactly

[03-Dec-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FtrSaroth> Agree, i see on Hush so powerful tool that can help so much

[03-Dec-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @FtrSaroth our new whitepaper is 95% correct. Cryptopia no longer exists so I need to mention that in an update üòÖ

[03-Dec-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and that whitepaper was before i figured out how to remove the 1.6gb downloads

[03-Dec-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Let me ask you this Duke, bc it has importance. Is there a way, or could there be a way, for two people to erase their message before it hits the blockchain? Maybe like signal it shows that two parties communicated but not the contents

[03-Dec-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FtrSaroth> Ok, gonna switch to the new whitepapper, Thats exactly why i want to translate, to understand correctly and that way can show it to the spanish talkers üëå

[03-Dec-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FtrSaroth> Example the actual situation on Venezuela, i think they can be benefit so much with Hush

[03-Dec-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's why we can go sentence by sentence. Last night I explained dPOW in Spanish to you to provide context

[03-Dec-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Referring to BTC & KMD, that both need to be reversed, so the resources needed would have to be huge

[03-Dec-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Signal does not provide that feature, firstly

[03-Dec-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FtrSaroth> Ok, the concepts more new to me was the zk_SNARKs

[03-Dec-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @FtrSaroth yes, Venezuela has perhaps the most to benefit from Hush, along with Catalonia

[03-Dec-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Once messages go on the blockchain, they are there forever, once notarized. This is protected by BTC hashrate security via Delayed-proof-of-work

[03-Dec-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You can prove things in the future, maybe to a judge or your employer or the gov or ...

[03-Dec-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's up to you

[03-Dec-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you don't want that

[03-Dec-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can make your own private Hush network that nobody can access, and chat on that

[03-Dec-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have solutions for all use cases

[03-Dec-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> This is what I like to hear

[03-Dec-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I trust dPOW

[03-Dec-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> me too

[03-Dec-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> HushList protocol is better than signal protocol, IMO

[03-Dec-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they solve slightly different use cases

[03-Dec-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> signal proto is helped by a central server to introduce Alice + Bob, then alice + bob talk directly

[03-Dec-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HushList proto is p2p

[03-Dec-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> very different, deep down

[03-Dec-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but similar goals

[03-Dec-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and they can be integrated, potentially. but hushlist is somewhat a competitor to signal (Richochet) protocol

[03-Dec-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @FtrSaroth The basic idea is, to provide encrypted, secure mailing lists.

[03-Dec-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we go for the same userbase

[03-Dec-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi don't use the phrase "mailing list" because most people don't even know what that is

[03-Dec-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> lol

[03-Dec-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Organizations do.

[03-Dec-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> sure

[03-Dec-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> What do you suggest we use?

[03-Dec-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "mailing list" is one way to implement HushList ideas, but some are not a mailing list

[03-Dec-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "encrypted peer-to-peer censorship-resistant communications platform"

[03-Dec-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> If you were to pitch someone, give us your go to pitch

[03-Dec-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We will translate it

[03-Dec-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ‚òùÔ∏è

[03-Dec-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> ```encrypted peer-to-peer censorship-resistant communications platform```

[03-Dec-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FtrSaroth> In spanish ```Plataforma de comunicaci√≥n encriptada de igual-a-igual, resistente a la censura```

[03-Dec-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FtrSaroth> I like it, sounds powerful üí™ üëå

[03-Dec-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> If you want  @FtrSaroth, you can do this for Hush, for the community... With us, we don't want anyone to do anything, that they don't have time for, or simply just don't want to.

[03-Dec-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We don't pressure people.

[03-Dec-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's not our style.

[03-Dec-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FtrSaroth> Let me start with the translation of the whitepapper, sometimes i dont have so much time available because family and work, but i really want and like to contribute

[03-Dec-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's a big contribution to the community

[03-Dec-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We are happy with whatever you can contribute üëç

[03-Dec-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FtrSaroth> Excellent! üëç

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It means a lot when people come here and want to check out what we have.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not sure it's a very good idea, what say you @Biz ? it's a metadata super-highway

[03-Dec-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> why would a privacy coin do this? What don't I understand?

[03-Dec-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> check it out

[03-Dec-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Tomyris> @dukeleto I think it's a good feature to increase the adoption, it's not mandatory anyway. It's a great use-case if you ask me. For the websites or businesses who would like to get payments in CCX, it would be a great option as well. You can always get a random name.

[03-Dec-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm running SDA on my ChromeBook

[03-Dec-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Tomyris> If we would like to provide the privacy for everyone, these kind of features are needed.

[03-Dec-19 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Tomyris> Unfortunately, privacy projects don't think much about how to improve adoption. For example, for normal people who don't understand technology, privacy coins are complicated. To make it widespread, you should provide ease of use.

[03-Dec-19 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Tomyris> I think you should think about adoption. Just a suggestion.

[03-Dec-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi you might be the first one!

[03-Dec-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Tomyris you make valid points about adoption. Adoption and privacy are often at odds and every chain must decide the middle path to walk between them

[03-Dec-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> vanity addresses seem to solve that use case, i would tell people to just do that. we do need better support for them, it's CLI only currently

[03-Dec-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Tomyris> @dukeleto Exactly. I think the best coin won't be the coin with the best privacy only, it will be the coin that combines with privacy and adoption best.

[dscrd-hush] <Hember> In fact I built the whole dradon from the face of a dragon I did yesterday.

[04-Dec-19 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> whoa

[04-Dec-19 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> I hope it doesn't resemble a devil too much. I was aiming it to be a dragon, but I just had to grow those horns, too.
