[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> I know the Pine motherboard is $44.95 (US) + P/H. Plus the cost of the 3D printed Dragon box and a SD memory card...

@dukeleto, how much do you estimate getting a Dragon (head) would node cost all up? Say $100 USD? Might be something I'd get, so as to experiment with.

[28-Aug-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pixelised not finalized, but around $200. The dragon head will be for sale by itself as well, people can do it all themselves. $200 is for the "plug it in and it works" version. That takes a lot of time to setup which is why we need to charge more than the raw costs

[28-Aug-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You can buy a dragon head, your own pine64 board (There are 2 models that fit, iirc) and compile every bit of software yourself for ARMv8, but that defeats the purpose of convenience for most

[28-Aug-19 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Plug and play with ease of use is part of the convenience package. Helps push Hush to reach the masses.
