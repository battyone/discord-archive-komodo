[17-Jun-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Draeth> It's programmed into my phone at this point, I should just let it autofill lol

[17-Jun-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Draeth> The unique thing that I do is that I don't require any funds from the project itself. Once the coin is designed and approved,  it goes up for pre-sale on my site. Once 20 coins have been preordered, it gets sent to manufacturing

[17-Jun-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Draeth> I also offer free shipping worldwide

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I'd get one or two as well as long as shipping costs aren't astronomical

[dscrd-hush] <Bernz> https://app.barterlly.io/offer/653 not sure if appropriate channel but I remember mods saying barterly offers are allowed to be posted

[17-Jun-19 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Bernz yes, u allowed if related to hush. Not sure the correct channel since your offer might get covered up with all the other messages and only a few will see it.

[18-Jun-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> @Bernz did you mean to price it at 0.05625 KMD per or was it off a decimal place by accident?

[18-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Bernz> Naw 0.056 would be about right in terms of usd value in todays prices

[18-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Bernz> theres no way 1 hush =.56 kmd, maybe one day :6849_pepeold:

[18-Jun-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> last hush I sold was 2KMD per, so there's that

[18-Jun-19 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> anyway, I wish you luck in finding a dumper with no faith in the coin üëçüèΩ

[18-Jun-19 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> price is good I feel.
Graviex selling at 834 sats per hush, bargain

[18-Jun-19 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I bought some, I wish my bitmex clears soon. 48 hours +-.  üò¶

[18-Jun-19 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Bernz> which, converted to kmd is 0.05 per so I'd say, yeah someone looking to dump their hush for kmd would still get "fair" value

[18-Jun-19 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> HUSH at less than $1 is only "fair value" for the buyer

[19-Jun-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Honestly have no idea was TS is doing these days

[19-Jun-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Robert Garcia> Kindly mate as they put Hush coin on that status, they delist coins severely last period and set a high withdrawal fee in order make users disable from withdraw the coins and all of these left coins goes under the thief Kim/fransisco alibrandi balance

[19-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TS keeps asking us how to update their hush code, we send them a link to the docs that everybody else uses, and don't hear back

[19-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I don't like the Tradesatoshi, there support is extremely rude and generic replies. Takes month updating and if they see they cannot update wallet they just ignore it. no communication with the team. I never traded more then 0.1 btc on the exchange at any point in time.

@dukeleto they did update the wallet but the nodes they connected to was stuck, notarized height issue, notarized height is greater then block .  Its been there when you switch on and off hush  daemon at certain times.  I tried connecting with the 2 nodes they use and it also gave the issue. So bad nodes they connected to.

I disagree with article. Coins like Bitradio wallet had tons of issues. Withdraw fee of 10 is fair to cover cost. As for Safex they did a complete new chain and 2 different coins. Tradesatoshi did give 3 months notice for the team. I don't see why it was unfair. They decided not to support the new chain since 2 different coins. 

As for KNT, that fees is too damn high. I support KNT point of view in this regards.

[19-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That is the reality of TS.

[19-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all they need to do stop hushd,  the delete the `~/.komodo/HUSH3/notarizations` file, and restart

[19-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have a brand new update for exchanges + pools as well
