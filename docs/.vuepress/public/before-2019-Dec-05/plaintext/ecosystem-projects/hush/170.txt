[31-Jul-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> BEAM use an SBBS (Bulletin Board) to help MW txns when a party is offline

[31-Jul-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> they WILL NOT be using it for messaging

[31-Jul-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> and GRIN does not support that feature either (at least not for now)

[31-Jul-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> in other words HUSH has, as far as I can tell, the best potential for private messaging

[31-Jul-19 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> perhaps the greatest argument against HUSH is the ``Trusted Setup`` which is routinely criticized by zcash haters. Im currently doing my homework to refute Trusted Setup FUD

[31-Jul-19 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> HUHS is up 50% in last 7 days

[31-Jul-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> with the next release Duke told us about today, and binaries for all platforms, im hoping to see 50 cents to 1 dollar, taking MC to 3-5mio bucks

[31-Jul-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> but community needs to get involved ofc and help push it

[31-Jul-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> We not touching 3 cent again(worst is 12 hours). Even if you sell all hush, below 3 cent is impossible again.

[31-Jul-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> people lately talking about VEIL. i checked it out.... and its totally broken

[31-Jul-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763

[31-Jul-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> cryptonote with broken zcash layer they dont know how to fix

[31-Jul-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> they brought in radix42 to help

[31-Jul-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> but its 16 million dollars of broken tech imo

[31-Jul-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> or at best a CN clone

[31-Jul-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> We welcome them here

[31-Jul-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Too bad it's GPU miners

[31-Jul-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Hate the hash is fragmented.

[31-Jul-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> But if hush was $20.  Gpu miners gladly be mining asic coin.

[31-Jul-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Lol

[31-Jul-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto in future is it hypothetically poss to switch from Equihash to Cuckaroo?

[31-Jul-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I think we are invested in asics

[31-Jul-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I would hate for that to happen at the moment

[31-Jul-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> J sold most of my gpu

[31-Jul-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I feel changing algorithms just makes the tycoon smile.
When LTC release, I was smiling. Advertise as ASIC resistence. Within 2 months we got asic, we just kept quiet about it and keep mining. Was great profit. Same with current monero algorithm, they keep making us smile

[31-Jul-19 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I still mine Monero(12%), but monero not in my profile. there 0 privacy, As long as you send one transaction a block, you can reverse engineer all transactions.

[31-Jul-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <evich> thank you @ITM üòç üíö

[31-Jul-19 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
