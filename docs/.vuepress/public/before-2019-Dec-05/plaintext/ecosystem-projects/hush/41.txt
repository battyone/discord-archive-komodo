[dscrd-hush] <ITM> bitcoin is centralized. Yes, but it can still be compromise if you have 67% control over notary nodes

[08-Feb-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> train in train

[08-Feb-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> you can only prevent notarizations from happening, you cant create fake notarizations

[08-Feb-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Let assume the worst:
A entity control 51% of bitcoin hash rate. Now the entity can reject all transactions. Now no notarizations can happen or it can be replace.

[08-Feb-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so we now have a dependency on bitcoin, yes the solution is great, Its the best out there.

[08-Feb-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> But I rather just create a coin on top of Komodo and don't worry about mining at all

[08-Feb-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> since we already using komodo, what purpose does hush have ?
Why should I invest in hush and not directly in komodo?

[08-Feb-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @jl777c As stated, I will invest in 5 exchanges + $100 000 if it was done my way😋. But we have a conflict. Just to make you happy, I will say I don't understand blockchain 😃

[08-Feb-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> if your attack scenario requires BTC to be undergoing a PERMANENT 51% attack... then it seems to be something to not worry about. Just when BTC is being 51% attacked, dont do transactions. Since this isnt expected to happen  it wont affect things much at all

[08-Feb-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @jl777c Understood. 😃

[08-Feb-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @ITM  In many things needs a compromise, it is impossible to negotiate with the other party by setting your own terms without the possibility of a mutually beneficial agreement. Therefore, I suggest you find a common solution with developers that would suit both parties. The proposal to list on 5 exchanges and invest 100,000 looks quite interesting. I only favor the project

[08-Feb-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's good to see a lot of healthy conversation in here

[08-Feb-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I am interested to see if ITM's proposal goes anywhere 😃

[08-Feb-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> in my opinion the more important proposal was the dev fund with mining fee. Its shit that @dukeleto have to work for no money on Hush. What do you think duke? Is this a way for Hush? If yes whats your Bounty to code it? We have some people who would love to give some Hush for that

[08-Feb-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I don't mind anyway just giving my opinion, I will still have my 10000 hush for a good day 😃

[08-Feb-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think the most important technical thing for Hush, at this juncture, is to upgrade to Sapling. The problem of how Hush pays for development also needs to be solved. The Zcash sprout inflation bug *does* affect Hush and any other Sprout chains left. I think ZCL, XSG, maybe others

[08-Feb-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> All of this applies to Hush: https://github.com/Snowgem/Snowgem/issues/19

[08-Feb-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> agree, maybe we can solve both problems with one Upgrade?

[08-Feb-19 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> sorry for my greenness but would this be possible? Upgrade to sapling and code the dev fee included in the Miner Reward? I would love to hear the opinion of the Community. Most people i read in this channel are Pro Miner fee, going in a dev fund Pool. Maybe in a Multi-Sig Address holded by Duke and (2?) other elected Community Members?

[08-Feb-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> The first coding work could pay by a Community bounty

[08-Feb-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto Offer please a way to get a reward to the developer, as a specialist who knows better than us ordinary users. This may be an increase in transaction fees, forks, algorithm changes, the introduction of POS, premine. Which way do you see the most acceptable and possible for HUSH. And we all vote. I have not seen anyone here opposing developer rewards.

[08-Feb-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> increase in transaction fees is probably most fair. But regardless of how funds are given to devs, price and usage needs to increase.

It's not worth it to make a huge change to solve the dev fund issue, imo. Focus on usage and everything else will follow.

[08-Feb-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Donate real money if you want something done.

[08-Feb-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> 1000 hush isn't going to do anything for anyone's life at this moment. Need to build support with fiat/btc or by inspiring with a vision.

[08-Feb-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> I remember way back when there was a team... I donated hush to like 5 members... It was like $100 each and now it's .50 or whatever.

[08-Feb-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Can't even get ramen.

[08-Feb-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Donations were collected several times and did not bring the desired result, the reward should be permanent and not temporary. If Duke proposes an acceptable and optimal solution, I think everyone will vote positively

[08-Feb-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> I suggest (Duke?) coding  the sapling upgrade and including a 10% dev fee (lets vote) for the next five years. Hush has little future if the is no development & bug fixing and that typically doesn't happen without a reward.

[08-Feb-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cye_BigDaddy> All the projects need to have some kind of dev fee if you ask me.

[08-Feb-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Duke has already said many times it's a passion project. He is doing the current n necessary work (thank you, Duke) regardless of lack of funds. Can he do all in future? No, but devs can build something on top of hush (like a program utilizing hushlist) and get fees that way. If you implement large additional fees on base layer, it's a bad idea. A small increase in transaction fees for all miners is a better idea (hope that trickles down to devs and hope the devs are mining).

[08-Feb-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Duke is also a KMD notary, so hopefully that helps him have the ability to do the core issues on hush when he has time.

[08-Feb-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Basically, hush won't be dead for awhile. Focus on usage and all should be ok.

[08-Feb-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> In addition to transaction fees, there are many other ways that I described above.

[08-Feb-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Matthias> Agree with @Eddy O  here. What matters the most is adoption. Building on top of Hush would definitely help, but that also requires some marketing efforts.

[08-Feb-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cye_BigDaddy> @Matthias  you need $ or btc for any kind of marketing. NOTHING is for free

[08-Feb-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <finrecon> But first there needs to be an actual product with a use case which you can market.

[08-Feb-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I originally paused working on HushList because it's too slow on Sprout. Sapling makes a simple operation "send a hello message to Alice" take a few seconds, when it takes 45 minutes on Sprout. Real-time-ish communication is not possible with Sprout. When Hush upgrades to Sapling, all HushList operations get a crazy amount faster, and many things become possible. A native desktop app that allows the doing some very basic things described in the whitepaper seems to be the "actual product"

[08-Feb-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> additionally, Sprout has a bug which allows very smart people to print infinite amounts of shielded Sprout funds

[08-Feb-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so Sapling is both an upgrade and a bugfix. There is no intermediate option, sprout is fundamentally broken in a very very subtle way

[08-Feb-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jast> prepare for another fall of bitcoin or believe that it is already going up ?

[08-Feb-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @jast I chicken out, I went 10 in and went 10 out

[08-Feb-19 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> So one vote for dev fund and all others against? 😃

[08-Feb-19 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> where is the vote?

[08-Feb-19 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Feb-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SDG> about urgency, I hurried 😀

[09-Feb-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SDG> I remembered the funny words of one politician, although he uttered these words, as in principle and all other speeches, with an absolutely serious face.: "do not hurry, otherwise you have time"

[09-Feb-19 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SDG> @dukeleto  we vote for a certain percentage of mining and for commission fees that need to be strengthened in the wallet, to the main developers' fund (for the further promotion of HUSH (exchanges, salary, marketing, etc.)

[09-Feb-19 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Feb-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Traded other coins. It's a working exchange from what I can see.

[09-Feb-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Safe trade is working 👍

[09-Feb-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I saw that at least 2 trades had occurred when I looked, just after it launched. New liquidity is good, in my opinion

[09-Feb-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> My goal is to upgrade Hush to Sapling in the best and most efficient way possible, given the resources we have right now. I think it's very possible and I am optimistic about new features coming into Hush

[09-Feb-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> I have a question about safe trade..when i scaned 2fa with google auth ..it didnt give me a backup code..

[09-Feb-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> Why? 🤔

[09-Feb-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> You have to ask some admin in the safe trade Discord. They have a very good support

[09-Feb-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> For me it works without any problems

[09-Feb-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> I see there are just around 800 hush coins avalable now ?

[09-Feb-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> 🤔

[09-Feb-19 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> They just listed us a few days ago...so there a not many Hush available

[09-Feb-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Safe trade irritated me, I had to login 9 times, there no way to recover account, the website is glutchy and 2 days I have been there, it been offline 5 times. Also they keep rebooting server. Will not trust them since noobs

[09-Feb-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> graviex and crex24 is the safest bet.
Having graviex, crex24 and tradesatoshi will be good since volume at crex24 is decent enough.
Second target will be 2 good exchanges(getting cryptopia up and lastly getting a exchange with decent volume)
lastly is to target bittrex and kraken

Hush got a lot of work needs to be done
- Critical the zcash vulnerability.(I sold out 75% hush until this is fix)
- Explorer
- Sapling
- A lot of upgrades and optimization required

There no road map since no dedicated dev, this is critical
1. Hush need to rebase with zcash code base to fix a lot of vulnerabilities and sapling upgrade. 
2 Hush need to introduce a 10% fee in mining block.
2. Hush needs 2 stable explorer.
3. Hush need to have 3 stable exchanges.
4. Notary needs integration with wallet.
5. Hush need more hush rate(5 Mhash+).

[09-Feb-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @ITM Can you be more precise when you say: 'A lot of upgrades and optimization required' ?

[09-Feb-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @gilardh 
1. Wallet using java, the version is outdated. Second is java is no longer free. The other javascript wallet does not do justice. Badly coded, lot of issues.
2. Database scan times are increasing, optimizations needs to be done. We never implement anything since v1. 
3. The original road map where hush suppose to be secure messaging blockchain. Hush Messenger and HushList  needs working on.
4. SSL need certs need to be renewed
The list is huge lol

[dscrd-hush] <Kumkani> Since cryptopia is closed does its means i have lost my 1000  hush coins?

[12-Feb-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Kumkani No, HUSH coins were not stolen. But it will probably take a few more months to get your coins back. Cryptopia has a lots of issues. I mean, really lots of issues.

[12-Feb-19 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Kumkani> Mmmmm i hope i do get them back

[12-Feb-19 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I wish you the best. But Cryptoia has lost an access to part of their funds (ETH, ERC-20) and it is unclear when they will be back. But don't forget HUSH was in maintance at the time of incident. It will probably take a few more months, before HUSH will be unlocked.

[12-Feb-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Disabled deposits. That's why.

[12-Feb-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Kumkani> Dissabled deposits from cryptopia?

[12-Feb-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> No, tradesatoshi's disabled deposits.

[12-Feb-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> If deposits are disabled, no new coins are coming into circulation.

[12-Feb-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Matthias> No deposits means lower supply on the exchange --> higher volatility. i.e. if sentiment is positive the price will increase faster and vice versa.

[12-Feb-19 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Kumkani> Ow owk i get you loud and clear

[12-Feb-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
