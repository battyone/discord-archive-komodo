[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c even if we somehow only burned 1sat every *other* transaction, I think that would still make the analysis harder. There could be a trade-off with how often 1sat burns are sent.

[18-Sep-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> And it was way more then a small gpu farm üòÇ

[18-Sep-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> if yes how does he find the z addresses to send to?

[18-Sep-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh not quite

[18-Sep-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> he is not sending dust

[18-Sep-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is where the confusion starts

[18-Sep-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> He is figuring out which transactions depend on which others

[18-Sep-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> By trying to replay/simulate history, and doing it out-of-order

[18-Sep-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If I replay history, but leave out TX1 and replay TX2, and TX2 still works, that means TX2 did not depend on TX1

[18-Sep-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This leaks metadata

[18-Sep-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> now you do this for the entire history, every possible way

[18-Sep-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and so much data falls out, it's scary

[18-Sep-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nobody has really thought about this, I say @ITM invented it

[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> Morning Community Hush

[18-Sep-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @franciscana23 welcome to the madness

[18-Sep-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> you can call the attack ``Back to the Future``

[18-Sep-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> dang son

[18-Sep-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is actually pretty nice

[18-Sep-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Back To The Future Attack, altho it's @ITM's baby

[18-Sep-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM your idea is basically the first blockchain analysis technique for zaddrs that actually works, and is not caused by using zaddrs incorrectly

[18-Sep-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gosh, don't tell the XMR people

[18-Sep-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> ITM is the one that should name this

[18-Sep-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c 100% agreed

[18-Sep-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> this attack works much better on XMR

[18-Sep-19 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but does it apply with ring-sigs and all that?

[18-Sep-19 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I try to learn via BLUR, but man, I still feel like an XMR newb

[18-Sep-19 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is a very general technique

[18-Sep-19 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which is what makes it exciting, this is going to work in many places, on many chains

[18-Sep-19 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Gosh, don't tell Uncle Sam yet

[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> The Madness HUSH

[18-Sep-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM what you are studying is transaction dependency graphs, nobody is thinking about that really

[18-Sep-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> he explains how XMR is basically totally deanonimizable

[18-Sep-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM I know some XMR people that would probably pay real money to verify your statement on XMR mainnet

[18-Sep-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> let's get paid

[18-Sep-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> memes are cool, but I know XMR people

[18-Sep-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If this is real, they will want to give us money

[18-Sep-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> @dukeleto deanonimization mostly about tracing the transaction graphs, the issue with zaddrs was that it was not known how to do it, until the "ITM" attack

[18-Sep-19 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> right, it's trivial with taddrs

[18-Sep-19 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ITM, he likes to think in reverse

[18-Sep-19 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> even with XMR, not so hard as it isnt encrypted

[18-Sep-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> dusting attacks on XMR have a long and illustrious history

[18-Sep-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but this new ITM attack, it's a new class of analysis

[18-Sep-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I keep calling it an attack , but maybe that is confusing for people. It's an attack on metadata

[18-Sep-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but really, it's just analyzing the public blockchain

[18-Sep-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I consider it an attack, that zaddrs can drip out so much metadata

[18-Sep-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it is significant enough to be called an "attack"

[18-Sep-19 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> and just posting a txid will allow a lot of analysis

[18-Sep-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> maybe Hush could some way unite with Pirate? I imagine Pirate holders could pay relevant value to Hush hodlers to move the Hushlist tech to Pirate -> transfer value the way Hush hodlers do not loose in that game? not sure if doable/possible/make sense ?

[18-Sep-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> just atomicDEX HUSH <-> PIRATE allows this

[18-Sep-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763

[18-Sep-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> Pirate already working on DEX?

[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> if people read my blog, most all of the technical questions are already answered

[18-Sep-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã the purpose of HushList is to run on many chains

[18-Sep-19 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Pirate and Hush will both react to this new attack, as best we can. Most chains will do nothing

[18-Sep-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Since Pirate and Hush have different consensus rules about taddrs, analysis will be different on each chain, and studying things on both chains gives us a lot of data

[18-Sep-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Burning 1sat in every zaddr xtn might become the new super-shielded-xtn

[18-Sep-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> without an unspendable zaddr output, you are vulnerable anytime in the future to a @ITM attack

[18-Sep-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this changes a lot of what we know about zcash protocol coins

[18-Sep-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: Do not give out your zaddrs publicly, do not give out txids publicly! Unless absolutely needed! It reduces the privacy of zaddrs for people to know that info about you.

[18-Sep-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Use one zaddr for public use, is a good opsec. Never give out any others publicly

[18-Sep-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we call this an "introducer" in HushList

[18-Sep-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> radix42 predicted all this years ago, by making this part of the hushlist protocol. You only give out 1 zaddr publicly

[18-Sep-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is no good way to tell wallet.dat that some outputs shouldn't be spent

[18-Sep-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c since i wrote the ZIP/HIP/KIP about wallet.dat, I feel comfortable potentially modifying it

[18-Sep-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we could make the wallet not spend some outputs

[18-Sep-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it would be backward compatible

[18-Sep-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not a consensus change

[18-Sep-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just add a tag of data to some xtns

[18-Sep-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and choose not to spend those, ever

[18-Sep-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> maybe only with some CLI flag

[18-Sep-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "this dust protects your privacy"

[18-Sep-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> destroy when done using it

[18-Sep-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Just some thoughts, but there is some beef there.

[18-Sep-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> in dust we trust

[18-Sep-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> exciting stuff. this has some serious implications.

[18-Sep-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> @dukeleto provably unspendable addresses seem to be the solution

[18-Sep-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> from your zcash experience, instead of pubkey, is it the diversifier that needs to be invalid?

[18-Sep-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> burn 1sat xtns, or tag unspendable xtns locally. Both options are good.

[18-Sep-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> because we go back to giving users the option of protecting their privacy which, history dictates that they won't due to comfort/cutting corners

[18-Sep-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that makes the analysis harder, still. Because we have multiple options

[18-Sep-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @mrlynch defaulting to burning would be fine. I want advanced users to maybe have more options

[18-Sep-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> burning is much easier

[18-Sep-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> zcash made optional privacy.. look how that turned out üòÖ

[18-Sep-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you think changing wallet.dat format is easy? Good lord, no

[18-Sep-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but, it's possible

[18-Sep-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Well, this is good for Hush investors

[18-Sep-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because we just identified a technical reason to continually burn Hush

[18-Sep-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which just means the circulating supply of spendable Hush will always be decreasing

[18-Sep-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hmm, not quite with new mining rewards. Let's reword that

[18-Sep-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> some Hush will continually become unspendable, and that changes supply+demand interactions

[18-Sep-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Let's say that. It's good for investors, because this will reduce circulating supply that is actually spendable

[18-Sep-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and more z adoption => more burning

[18-Sep-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Love to @ITM for finding this and, more valuable for me, discuss this open here üôå

[18-Sep-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @mrlynch can you figure out the zaddr corresponding to pubkey=0?

[18-Sep-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> working on it

[18-Sep-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> technically, pubkey=0 still has a private key

[18-Sep-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it could be spent via raw xtn, maybe
