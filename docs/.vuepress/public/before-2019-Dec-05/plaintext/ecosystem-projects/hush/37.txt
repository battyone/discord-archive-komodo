[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> various coins are paying me to add DPoW, and because of that, various issues and improvements have been found by me, which improve HUSH+KMD+BTCH

[26-Jan-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @AkiraX what you say about hush from cryptopia ?

[26-Jan-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto I think there is nowhere to fall in price, and if this project is good for people, BTCH can be a success like Verus

[26-Jan-19 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Cryptopia was holding a ton of btch from the fork

[26-Jan-19 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> If cryptopia doesn’t come back.  Essentially a lot of btch was lost

[26-Jan-19 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Means a lot less btch to be bought

[26-Jan-19 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Satoshi himself said, that every time a Bitcoin is lost or destroyed, all the remaining holders should say thank you, because their coins are worth more, as a larger % of circulating supply

[26-Jan-19 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that isn't the original quote, but pretty close

[26-Jan-19 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```
June 22, 2010 - 
"Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone. [...] Computers have to get about 2^200 times faster before that starts to be a problem. Someone with lots of compute power could make more money by generating than by trying to steal."

```

[26-Jan-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, just because cryptopia, the business, is failing, doesn't mean they won't liquidate all their other assets

[26-Jan-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have no idea if they know they own a large amount of BTCH

[26-Jan-19 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they never responded to any of my emails about supporting it, or anybody else's request

[26-Jan-19 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Yes if they eventually file for bankruptcy like mt gox.. they may slowly liquidate their btc and other asset (coins) to pay their creditors.. so it all depends

[26-Jan-19 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> I think they have a decent amount of btch from the hush airdrop

[26-Jan-19 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Anyway there wont be a large enough mkt to liquidate it without crashing the price

[27-Jan-19 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Is there an automated tool to do a 51% attack? Since now its becoming very common

[27-Jan-19 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> this also would include all they btc on their exchange

[27-Jan-19 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @kh4567 yes, it's called NiceHash 😃

[27-Jan-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Even if they liquidate btc.    Or hush.  They wouldn’t give the private keys

[27-Jan-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <5indians> has anyone spoken with radix42 lately?

[27-Jan-19 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763

[27-Jan-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> radix42 has been active in KMD + ARRR

[28-Jan-19 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <badalf> Have we lost all our HUSH that was on cryptopia? It's not listed as an exchange for hush on coinmarketcap now

[28-Jan-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @badalf No we haven't lost our Hush that are on Cryptopia yet. CoinMarketCap has just decided to hide all cryptopia markets since they are inactive https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/cryptopia/

Cryptopia Hack Update: Stolen Funds Were Drained Under Police Nose

[28-Jan-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> @dukeleto from nicehash, is there a step by step guide on how to execute a 51% attack.. ? 😀

[28-Jan-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Just curious how they did it on ethereum classic.. chain reorg and stuff

[28-Jan-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @kh4567 it's not something that honest people want to be easy for the dishonest

[28-Jan-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> at a high level, you buy hashrate on NiceHash, and you point that to your privately run mining pool. You secretly mine your own chain, and then unleash that onto the public network. 51% attacks are the simple infrastructure and a double spend requires lots of additional custom code and fancy stuff. Attackers spend lots of time + energy on that code and don't release that code publicly

[29-Jan-19 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Imagine the chaos for some coins if there was a howto on that @dukeleto.

[29-Jan-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The few that know how to do it seem to be causing lots of chaos across many dozens of coins already. They don't want competition, either

[29-Jan-19 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```
The scenario this paints is that the exchange either suffered such a catastrophic security breach that it was not able to do anything about tens of thousands of suspicious user wallet transactions or the hack was carried out with help from an insider.
```

[29-Jan-19 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Cryptopia always felt like MtGox 2.0 and I am not happy to be so close to the mark. It seems that they barely knew how to maintain their infrastructure

[29-Jan-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Its probably a mtgox only on a smaller scale/size 😀

[29-Jan-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> when mtgox hack happened, btc was only worth around $400-ish

[29-Jan-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, this cryptopia hack is much smaller that what happened in the goxening

[29-Jan-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> mtgox was using their own shitty internal untested software and burned hundred of bitcoins on accident, sending them to wrong addresses. just that mistake alone is on par with the size of this cryptopia hack. topia was a blip

[29-Jan-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> And in mt gox case probably nobody had expected it to happen.. but cryptopia- its sort of expected...😀

[29-Jan-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> So are lost the hush coins from cryptopia or ?

[29-Jan-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Cheers to @dukeleto .   At least we know hush is not an exit scam. 😃

[29-Jan-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Even with all this down trodden news.  He is passionate about these coins we are in

[29-Jan-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> everyone . As you all know, since the Cryptopia disaster Hush has been limited to one exchange (tradesatoshi) where volumes have been fairly low. Some of the most common comments we see in this discord are the need to be on more exhanges. We have applied to every well known exchange but do not often hear back. Recently, we have been in contact with CryptoBridge who has offered to list us on their exchange (for a fee of course). Their current daily volume is around 400k USD (per CMC) which is actually only half of TradeSatoshi. If getting listed on CryptoBridge is something that we as a community would like to do, then we need to raise 2.5 BTC in order to get the listing. However, if everyone would rather wait & see if we can find a better deal at a higher volume exchange, then that is fine with us as well. If you are willing to contribute BTC to help Hush get listed on crypto Bridge, please THUMBS UP this comment. If not, please voice your opinions as such. This is a community project and we're all decision makers here. So let us know what you think!

[29-Jan-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Sloogs> Hi guys, we should not be too spread within so many low exchanges at this stage/size

[29-Jan-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> In my experience CryptoBridge is really a lowend exchange. I don't think it would help to get listed there. Especially not for 2.5 BTC.
I think SonoX has more potential. Are we still on-track for that?

[29-Jan-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Scirockoe> Contact Nova exchange 1btc should do the trick

[29-Jan-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Francis> Just out of curiosity, does anyone know how much it costs to be listed on bittrex?

[29-Jan-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @Francis there is no listing fee for Bittrex. They evaluate each coin individually based on the paperwork that you provide them. We would need a legal opinion as well as token metrics done by a law firm in order to submit to Bittrex and have any real shot of getting a listing. The Lawyer fees for such work is around 6k USD

[29-Jan-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> I don't think CryptoBridge has anything to offer for the cost of listing. Several other projects I am involved in have looked at Crypto bridge but there were too many negatives, as has pointed out above to pay for a listing.

[29-Jan-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Francis> @RunningMantheCoin so if the legal feels are 6k usd for potential listing at bittrex (which is going to have to be required in the future if hush wants to grow substantially) and cryptobridge want 2.5btc (What $8k?) What's the point? - shouldn't we aim for getting the right paper work for a proper work long term rather than some dodgy exchange

[29-Jan-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Francis> Tbh, I'm a huge fan of KMD. I used to love hush, but my favour is KMD and Bitcoinhush..... from my understanding btch inherits all kmd updates? 

I'm asking because I could potentially fund the legal costs of listing, though I would choose btch over hush

[29-Jan-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> That is correct, BTCH inherits all the KMD updates automatically

[29-Jan-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> And I agree, I think the money is better spent elsewhere. However in order for us to have a shot at the Bittrex listing, we would also need a Whitepaper for HUSH. At the moment, there is only a whitepaper for the HushList protocol- whereas we need one specifically for the coin. The law firm would then take that whitepaper and edit it so it can follow all necessary legel jargon & avoid being looked at as a security

[29-Jan-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @Francis  if you are serious about providing some funding please DM me and I can send you some of the quotes we've received from US law firms in order to provide all the necessary paperwork for the Bittrex listing

[29-Jan-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Francis> @RunningMantheCoin so I would have to fund hush before btch is possible? So I'm assuming the hush legal costs would be similar to that of hush? I.e. whatever you have been quoted, I would have to double this? An it's still not guaranteed to have hush or btch listed?

[29-Jan-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Grenwolde> I use cryptobridge for a number of coins -- their site works -- volume is generally low but for some of the coins I mine I have no other choice.  I have been using them for a while with no issues.  You just have to be savvy patient and not spot sell all the time.

[29-Jan-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @Francis my task has been specifically to find out what the needs are in order to get HUSH listed on exchanges. Since Hush and BTCH are seperate coins, then yes they would each need to be paid for seperately. However, the short term issue with trying to get BTCH listed is there is very little paperwork or online forums that talk about the coin. Hush has a much larger history (bitcointalk forums, huge Github, large twitter acccount, good website etc). So functionally speaking, there is a much higher chance of getting Hush listed on an exchange than BTCH simply because of the sheer work that BTCH needs in order to catch up to HUSH

[29-Jan-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> And moreover you are correct, the difference between large exchanges and small ones is that small ones ask for a fee for a guarenteed listing. We could hypothetically spend all this money on HUSH to get it listed but it may not be acceptd. Thats not to say that the Legal work we're paying for wouldnt be useful at other exchanges- but yes it is a higher risk

[29-Jan-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I am in favor of continuing the development and marketing of HUSH before paying a registration fee to the exchanges.

[29-Jan-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> My personal feeling is that of @gilardh  . This listing fee seems too high for the low volume & there is much work to do on the dev & marketing side before we get to more exchanges. But thats just my two cents. Its up to everyone

[29-Jan-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @Andreas We are indeed still on-track for a free listing at SonoX, they've had some setbacks and are a little late on their schedule, once they get released they'll start adding coins Gradually.

[29-Jan-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Also that https://vote.safe.trade/ which OleksandrBlack linked above is currently looking like we will win the January round.

[29-Jan-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Francis> @RunningMantheCoin okay, I still don't understand why hushs's github history etc would come across as superior, when btch is essentially kmd? And kmd is already listed/ decent website/ publicity - KMD could promote/ link itself to BTCH (which I believe KMD is going to be reliant upon in the future anyway?)

I am a long term invested in all three, KMD, HUSH & BTCH, as I truly believe in their tech - though I never wished to be involved with funding.

2019 I will help with KMD & BTCH publicity, which I should have a great influence on.

2020 I will fund it - Hush and BTCH  (if they're not already achieved by then)

I am busy/ don't check this often @RunningMantheCoin so DM if there are any updates you would like me to be aware of

[29-Jan-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Jan-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Puffman> @RunningMantheCoin Awesome. By the way, I'm just a miner and I'm in no way associated with them other than being someone that uses their exchange. I could elaborate more about how fast they are to tickets. I've only had one issue and that was when I deposited  300,000 coins, they broke it up into smaller amounts and some were missing. Very fast response, they explained what I needed to do and everything posted. I've been trading there for about 6 months. Thank you for the response to my suggestion. Maybe this could be a good place to start. Have a fantastic week😜

[29-Jan-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Jan-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Feesh> is the main team just too busy.

[29-Jan-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @Feesh technically, no. There is a HushList Protocol whitepaper, but there is no whitepaper for the hush coin. The only way around this without writing a hush coin whitepaper is to put the Hush Token metrics into the existing whitepaper

[29-Jan-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
