[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> Also you should update the translation files with Notarized key,

[14-Jan-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> Another thing is that bitcore-node has to be updated as well imo.

[14-Jan-19 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> So in bitcore-node-hush/lib/services/bitcoind.js
```
Bitcoin.prototype.getInfo = function(callback) {
```

[14-Jan-19 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> yes that was it. Somehow on my explorer it shows 0 (the same when I do hush-cli getinfo) but I assume its beacuse of the restart and it will catch after a next notarization.
I also updated the explorer.hush.zelcore.io to my recent insight style. So it has pools, rich list, some statistics, fixes etc. It will take a while for the mongodb to catch up but should be working. The source is in hush branches in TheTrunk/bitcore-node-hush TheTrunk/insight-api TheTrunk/insight-ui . I will be trying to do some unification of inisght explorer so for there is just bitcore-node.json file when you write: coin: hush and it will configure itself for hush coin, or zcash or whatever. Will be nice to have this a bit centralized for all new coins as well

[14-Jan-19 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> nice now the notarization catched up 😃

[14-Jan-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Thanks  @TheTrunk

[15-Jan-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> People can see the "Notarized" item in the top right of https://explorer.hush.zelcore.io/ , that was what I was trying to get working

[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Sounds like the end of  cryptopia...anyone store their coins there ? 
 whether they can come out of this is uncertain..

[15-Jan-19 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Cryptopia never dies. They are like a phoenix, when you think they are dead, they suddenly rise up again.

[15-Jan-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Hush going underground for awhile, it seems.... Like it wasn't unknown enough lol

[dscrd-hush] <Captain> holy canoli

[15-Jan-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I hope the damage is not that big.. but mostly when this happens wallets are ripped...

[15-Jan-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> At least so far, no Hush has been sent out from Cryptopia. https://explorer.hush.zelcore.io/address/t1bEBr1LdBQtHun7B5L82R65FgpWyyWFx8L

[15-Jan-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Hush has been offline on crytopia for months. Maybe that affects it. But, plenty of hush stolen awhile ago, apparently.

[15-Jan-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Jan-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Pretty much all i had in Cryptopia was Hush that i couldn't move out and few sh*tcoins

[15-Jan-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I see many people calling it an "exit scam" and a loooot of very uneducated, very angry, "investors"

@Cryptopia_NZ Omg. I have 225 Btc and 1500 eth in your exchange. Pls update your investor immediately

[15-Jan-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I hope that nobody in here had 225 BTC on Cryptopia, because that is insane

[15-Jan-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I had about 9K Hush that I had bought about 2 hours before going into maintenance, but luckily I had everything else I owned stored in wallets elsewhere.

[15-Jan-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Friendly reminder not to store anything on exchanges.

[15-Jan-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Can users still log in and see their balances? I haven't tried to visit Cryptopia.

[15-Jan-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Their site is in maintenance

[15-Jan-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> It's good to wait and see what happens, i don't think this can be the end of Cryptopia. It's ridiculous how many are saying they exit scammed, with no actual proof.

[15-Jan-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> From the get go with them I never trusted their security measures, the website seemed a little hackish

[15-Jan-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They are most likely having law enforcement copy/image all harddrives to do forensic analysis, if law enforcement is involved. That process could take quite a while, like weeks or months. If Hard drives are evidence in a crime, they go into an evidence locker

[15-Jan-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 agreed, there is no *proof* of an exit-scam. It's just that it's so profitable and common in this industry, people jump to that conclusion

[15-Jan-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> How’s everything else going?

[15-Jan-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Duke has been making some very solid progress towards our next release, besides the Cryptopia issue becoming more and more of a fiasco, things are going great.

[15-Jan-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> This coin is in serious need of some liquidity though, and for the time being it's pretty obvious that we may not get Cryptopia up and trading any time soon... if anyone hears of exchanges picking up the Cryptopia slack in the time-being for alienated coins, please post them up in here or DM me 😃 It's pretty typical that some exchanges offer relief to coins affected.

[15-Jan-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> I think for Hush to have any future it needs a plan/roadmap and commited team

[15-Jan-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> for the simple reason - I dont believe any seriouds exchange / big one will list a small token with no future plans and team, active github is good starting point though

[15-Jan-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> dPOW might be not good enough sale point

[15-Jan-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> we may see it stupid it is the way it is

[15-Jan-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> but somehow promises even when false are seen by market makers as better then pure tech

[15-Jan-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> Im not fan of false promises, but I believe Hush got the original idea to make private mesages

[15-Jan-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> question if this is doable in near future (also if it needs heavy funding)

[15-Jan-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> if not doable / no orig idea supporting Hush / then it may be the sad tiem to consider project end of life. Happened to me all my past personal project came to such end so I know it's not easy to accept, but either there is power or there is not...

[15-Jan-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> all I have are bunch of opinions, use it if helps

[15-Jan-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Agree not many major exchanges want to deal with a coin with no team and no vision. You think they want the added risk?

[15-Jan-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> And no one wants to risk trading on places like tradesatoshi or coinexchange.

[15-Jan-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> I also wonder if original vision of messaging is going to be done or if this is dead. Not much work done on the messaging front in all of 2018.

[15-Jan-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> Probably crucial is to gather a team at this point. Anybody knows a succesfull project without a strong team?

[15-Jan-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> But having vision too - vision is what attracts people actually - first vision attracts people to be part of team, then more people to be part of the event...

[15-Jan-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> Vision could be to have workable mobile friendly encrypted email app. Not sure if realistic example, but decentralized encrypted email is what I could potentially use, and probably many people worldwide.

[15-Jan-19 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @Eddy O the exact same thing was said last year.    Hard to get people together with no funds.

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Their security breach came at a pretty crucial moment, when duke gets the new update ready soon, it could be that they are too busy to implement it or aren't around at all.

[16-Jan-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Mobile is going to take a lot of time, have to integrate sapling into hush first in order to get tx's working on phones(tx's require a lot of processing power before sapling), then obviously develop the whole wallet software too. PC however is much simpler and i believe sending messages is already working at some level and so is the wallet.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Roxin No, HUSH was not affected in this hack. You will be able to get it back. But no one knows when will Cryptopia restore trading. Optimistic scenario is a few days, realistic is at least few weeks.

[16-Jan-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> Anyway hush is in maintenence i think since octomber..

[16-Jan-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Correct. Cryptopia is waiting another update. It can take months before you will be able to remove your coins.
