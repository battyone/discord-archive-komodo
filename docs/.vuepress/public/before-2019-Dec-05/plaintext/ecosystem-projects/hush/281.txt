[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Possible bug on the latest SD Windows binary release. When I go to backup wallet.dat file, the auto generated filename is "hush-wallet-backup-20191109.dat/hush-wallet-backup-20191109".

[09-Nov-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Which on a Windows system, is an invalid filename (ie. file type ".dat/hush-wallet-backup-20191109").

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pixelised this is a weird known bug, that i can't seem to fix, originally reported by @gilardh

Bill Gates made his money by extinguishing free software and forcing us to pay him a tax just to turn our computers on. This was only possible because the State was ready to violently enforce his "intellectual property".

He didn't created a computer revolution, he destroy...

Just so we are clear, $BTC kept a CVE secret since 2017 that $ZEC just fixed in an emergency release. Bitcoin does not trust the shitcoin Zcash enough to share CVEs, just like Zcash doesn't trust other Zcash forks with their precious CVE's.

Keeping secrets benefits the at...

And so we now know, that dozens of $ZEC forks and perhaps hundreds of $BTC codebases have this CVE that hackers are no doubt exploiting to the best of their ability.
This is the norm in cryptocoins. This is fine.

How many CVE's is Bitcoin Core sitting on and not sharing? ...
