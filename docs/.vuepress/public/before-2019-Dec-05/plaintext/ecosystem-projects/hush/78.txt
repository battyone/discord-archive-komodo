[dscrd-hush] <shuta> Trying to withdraw from tradesatoshi, but it says "Currency not found or is currently disabled or is currently withdraw disabled."

[01-May-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <shuta> anyone knows the reason?

[01-May-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `"Currency not found or is currently disabled or is currently withdraw disabled.`

[01-May-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that

[01-May-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TradeSatoshi does not have withdraw/deposit enabled

[01-May-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Please send them a support ticket about it! üëº

[01-May-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they are losing txfees by not having it enabled, if enough people complain, they may just do it

[01-May-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <shuta> done üòâ

[01-May-19 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Low33y> Yeah I‚Äôm stuck with TradeSatoshi too, their reply to me prior to the swap was they are working on getting the wallet out of maint but they don‚Äôt have an ETA and please don‚Äôt lodge multiple tickets about this. Lol. Its probably out of your hands being a 3rd party but I don‚Äôt suppose you guys at Hush have any pull in speeding them up? I‚Äôll def be onto the webwallet after this üôÑ

[02-May-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We have no control over TradeSatoshi, by best advice, to all Hush people who have funds on Cryptopia and TradeSatoshi: Keep lodging support tickets

HUSH no longer uses that sprout chain.
It seems the "confusion" is already on your end.

Hi computergenie,
Regarding with this issue, please wait until our wallet department fix HUSH wallet and removed status message.
Thank you for your patience.

[02-May-19 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> be like Andy, keep writing letters üòÖ

[02-May-19 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that clip didn't have the scene I wanted. Basically, a prisoner writes the state a letter every week, asking for a library. Every week, he sends a letter

[02-May-19 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> After many years, they finally give the prison a library, and tell him to stop writing letters

[02-May-19 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So he says "Now I will write a letter every day!"

[02-May-19 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If enough Hush requests come in, it will be bumped up over other coins. They are trying to restore dozens of coins, still

[dscrd-hush] <Jaspr-Quantify> Hey all, is there a GUI wallet release for hush 3.0 ?

[02-May-19 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763

[02-May-19 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> What's right with them would be easier to answer.

[02-May-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763

[02-May-19 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Jaspr-Quantify> hey

[02-May-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> @Kumkani only btc, ltc and doge for now

they have a huge backlog of coins to re-open and by my estimation we have at least 1-2 months of waiting ahead of us

[02-May-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Kumkani> @Pepin the Healerthanks for info

[02-May-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If you're looking to trade Hush, these are your best two options. SafeTrade is supporting the most volume alongside TradeSatoshi, but TradeSatoshi doesn't have withdraw and deposit enabled yet

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Please support TxBit, they seem like a new exchange that is trying hard, they are working on getting listed on CMC as well

[02-May-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They also list KMD, i think we are the first asset chain of KMD on that exchange

[02-May-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I've made a few trades on txbit before, the exchange runs very smoothly and has a great interface, I've had no issues with them.

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I've sent another support ticket to tradesatoshi, hopefully when they get enough of them, they'll update faster üòâ

[05-May-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Or if they get way too many they might delist coins. I've submitted a ticket ages ago only to get the usual BS canned reply that says essentially nothing.

Support the other three exchanges that actually work trading Hush.

[05-May-19 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> From experience with that exchange, steer clear.

[05-May-19 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> It's good for beginners. Also good if you like to lose your money with a feeling of resent after experiencing their crappy "customer support". Might as well your light your fiat cash with fire. üî•

[05-May-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Roxin  All should be good, they will just download the new hush3 and import they old keys, only problem we don't know if the hush3 keys on cryptopia was compromised or not.
