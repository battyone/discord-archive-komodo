[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pixelised it's good advice in general

[15-May-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't sign NDA's, never have, never will. No signed agreements with them ever happened

[15-May-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> That's good as I would like to see any incompetence/negligence/dishonesty exposed

[15-May-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i wouldn't ever give out personal information about anybody, but i am talking about more details about the cryptopia attack

[15-May-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> like, I only wrote a page or two about it

[15-May-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but I have 50 pages of info

[15-May-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and I don't trust Cryptopia to ever tell the truth

[15-May-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They have lied for so long

After lying to the world for so long about dozens of their coins having 51% attacks + double spends, it was the massive $ETH + erc20 wallet heist that broke the camels back.
Cryptopia joins MtGox and many others in the hall of shame. https://t.co/WV5vdIkxQH

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `I don't sign NDA's, never have, never will. `
And all this time I thought I was the only one üòÆ

[15-May-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool nope, i have turned down many

[15-May-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's SO FUNNY. When I turn down NDA's, 50% of the time people say "ok, we don't need to have an NDA"

[15-May-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I imagine our reasons are different though üòõ

[15-May-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> NDA's are like poison in the well of an open source + free software dev

[15-May-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it infects everything you do

[15-May-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so it's just not even viable for me, it's a non-starter

[15-May-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> My problem is I generally can't be assed to remember what I'm not supposed to say

[15-May-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jabe massive incompetence and negligence, to be honest

[15-May-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool if only you could get a job telling people exactly what you feel

[15-May-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> lol

[15-May-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> that's what I suspected

[15-May-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jabe my estimate is that 50ish cryptopia coins were double spent

[15-May-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they lied, and put them all into "maintenance"

[15-May-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this was because they don't understand confirmations and never once answered an email or support request from me

[15-May-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Never. Once.

[15-May-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> during the entire BTCH airdrop. Not. Once.

[15-May-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So yeah, I have very low opinion of them.

[15-May-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> @dukeleto  That's atrocious

[15-May-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> The 51% attack was their fault. Too low number of confirmations set when it was recommended by the Hush team to be much higher. I knew they lied when they blamed the Hush team.

[15-May-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the ETH/erc20 hack was just so much worse, because it was much more money

[15-May-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they could have survived the 51% attacks on all the little coins

[15-May-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but losing all their ETH/erc20 was a fatal blow

[15-May-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> adding both together, they had no chance

[15-May-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The truth is, we had dpow coded up much before the Cryptopia hack. But cryptopia would never ever respond to us! Even if we tried to make them use DPoW, they wouldn't have

[15-May-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so, the current situation was inevitable, from Cryptopia's poor choices

[15-May-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> my guess is dozens of other coins are in the same situation as Hush, but I think since we have a brand new mainnet and reclaimed the stolen funds, we are actually in a pretty good place. We are not constrained by Cryptopia, that was the past

[15-May-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The future is where Hush has volume on a dozen exchanges and no one exchange has the majority

[15-May-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is what I want to work towards

[15-May-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> with 3 new exchanges, that is 25% of the way!

[15-May-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> MtGox is still talking about giving money back, after so many years, so the above really is quite accurate

[15-May-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Liquidators get paid to liquidate

[15-May-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The longer their job takes, the more they get paid. Some might even get paid a % of the liquidation. But rarely are they motivated to move quickly. It's a very slow process

[15-May-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> add to that, the active police investigation and yeah, don't believe a single word they say about timelines

[15-May-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> I've had former employers go bust and only to resurrect the business with new owners. Still waiting for entitlements years later from the former owners.

[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> I think cryp is dead

[15-May-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Like bullet to the head

[15-May-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-May-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> The Administrators/Liquidators get paid first before anyone else. Their hourly rates aren't cheap. A junior doing any work is charged by the administrator at over $150 per hour!

[15-May-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> If you used a bullet to take out Cryptopia, you wasted a good bullet. üòè

[15-May-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @kh4567

[15-May-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Yes.. do u know the original founder of crypt is kimdotcom.. a well known fraudster/hacker

[15-May-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Maybe he or his team is the hacker

[15-May-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> I know who he is but did not know he was the original founder of Cryptopia.

[15-May-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Binance reopened trade

[15-May-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> After maintainance

[15-May-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Binance got hacked but its small

[15-May-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> To them

[15-May-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Mkt looking pretty good

[15-May-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I didn't know Kim Dotcom was the original owner of Cryptopia, is that true? I saw something about that on Twitter but wasn't sure

[15-May-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Yes he founded and left....crypt exchange token is named "dotcoin"..üòÄ

[15-May-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> I'm wondering what are you guys have in your mind to compensate the people.
Basically the problem is that you won't be able to tell how the coins were distributed between the investors on Cryptopia.... I can't think of any good way to tell that.

[15-May-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> On the bright side .. lost coin just means everybody else coin is now worth much more...according to satoshi himself üòÄ

[15-May-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> ‚ÄúLost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.‚Äù -satoshi

[15-May-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is pretty much my favorite Satoshi quote

[15-May-19 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Andreas there is no perfect way, but as my math professor in college used to tell me "Something is better than nothing" and so we will do something, not nothing

[15-May-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Since I know the details of the HUSH v3 airdrop, I can estimate some things, such as the maximum number of Cryptopia Hush owners

[15-May-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There were 31K unique addresses in the Hush snapshot, that gives us an upper bound on total number of unique hush addresses with funds

[15-May-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> half of them had less than 1 HUSH

[15-May-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This tells me, that most likely, there are less than 15K Cryptopia users with Hush funds

[15-May-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because most of those addresses are change addresss

[15-May-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if we have 20K people coming to us asking for cryptopia funds, that is very obviously #fakenews

[15-May-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's going to be the active investors, who keep track of what they invest in, that will get their Hush back.

[15-May-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Some action will be required, and based on that, we will review, and send X HUSH

[15-May-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> oh okay...  üòÑ I remember there was a distribution graph on Cryptopia
there was one owner with lots of HUSH... can't remember exactly, but something around 100k... then there was a like 10-15 around 10-15k and most of the people had 1-2k on that graph... but I think it only showed the top 30 (or so) wallets

[15-May-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> I know this is very vague....

[15-May-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There is no perfect solution here. But doing nothing is worse, imho

[15-May-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we spent months talking to cryptopia trying to make them whole, to re-enable trading. Months and months. They agreed but just kept kicking the can down the road, most likely because they knew this day was coming. It's pretty frustrating from the perspective of the Hush team, if you can imagine. We wasted so much time talking to them, when they knew they were 99% going to get liquidated

[15-May-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Probably screenshots from everyone who has them is a good start, Then if people can prove they sent hush to cryptopia, and those would be returned to the same address they came from, of course it will be more difficult to prove for them who only bought Hush

[15-May-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> To be honest, I am not looking at screenshots

[15-May-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and it could be of a huge transfer, which was then sold. Screenshots are not viable

[15-May-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> true

[15-May-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> But screenshots from after they re-opened this year could possibly be used? No way for the user to move funds after that.

[15-May-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> @dukeleto  I don't think I ever transferred Hush into Cryptopia, but I did transfer some out before they stopped withdrawals

[15-May-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> Withdrawals woujld confirm the person was a cryptopia hush owner

[15-May-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am not making any promises, all of this is changing by the minute. But we are thinking of the best way to give back Cryptopia funds to the community. It won't be perfect, many will complain. But many people will have Hush in their wallets again, too

[15-May-19 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> subscribe to Blockfolio and twitter if you haven't, because it will be announced and most likely be time-based (can't last forever)

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are also on the Delta app now too, because @Berg is awesome

[15-May-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> when we do decide on something, i want to have it translated into various languages. It's pretty important

[15-May-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am willing to pay bounties for translations, so just want to put that out there

[15-May-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> at least you can't say "nothing is going on in that Hush community"! Never a dull moment here

[15-May-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> I will be happy with whatever I can get back, it's a lot better than hoping the liquidators will return something eventually

[15-May-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am still waiting on MtGox liquidators, lol

[15-May-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It used to be painful, but now it's a badge of pride

[15-May-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> MtGox taught me very valuable lessons

[15-May-19 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> I've also got some other coins on there which I am mentally writing off

[15-May-19 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, they are all a "captial loss"

[15-May-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i am not a lawyer or accountant, but i believe there are some made-up rules where you keep track of all those losses and some person steals a bit less from you, but details are murky

[15-May-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> Probably by setting them off capital gains (if any) for tax purposes
