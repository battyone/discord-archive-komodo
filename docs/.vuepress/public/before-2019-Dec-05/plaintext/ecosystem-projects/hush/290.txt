[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Said the bishop to the pope, yeah there are a lot of versions of that 🙂

[18-Nov-19 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Kek.

[18-Nov-19 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so, errybody, play with the wormhole

[18-Nov-19 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> put your finger in the wormhole

[18-Nov-19 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> see if you can break it

[18-Nov-19 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> :troll:

[18-Nov-19 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> make sure to close the "connect mobile app" dialog if you had it open for a while, and open again

[18-Nov-19 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is also a bug in :SD:, where you must leave that popup open, and if you close it, the connection will be dropped, yet you can't use the rest of the SD GUI while that popup is active.

[18-Nov-19 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> now that the wormhole works, we will find some bugs that we couldn't before

[18-Nov-19 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and we will see some new releases of SD+SDL+SDA, and we should be submitting to Google Play pretty darn soon here

[18-Nov-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and F-Droid

[18-Nov-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Exactly. I am sure everyone knows every little part, is a process, and no task is small.

[18-Nov-19 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> It just takes time. Google Play and FDroid, in our sights

[18-Nov-19 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> turns out this wormhole thing is just not compatible with `haproxy` and i changed to a server with `nginx` and everything Just Works

[18-Nov-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in the process, many many things were learned and improved in the internals, so it was a good journey thru the wormhole

[18-Nov-19 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> @dukeleto Can you explain the Wormhole, in basic terms, in one or two sentences for our community?

[18-Nov-19 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It let's you pair a mobile android device to your full or lite wallet, and interact with it, even when you are not on the same local network @Crypto99

[19-Nov-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763

[19-Nov-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763

[19-Nov-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763

@verysuhe @MrKomodoWorld @VerusCoin yes, I did start mining $VRSC in the Days Of The Big Blocks, before FPGAs raged the network and Mike was too dumb to realize how to deal with it and pushed many core $KMD people out of the community.

[19-Nov-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> might as well remind everybody that Verus is a surveillance coin, in case anybody didn't know

[19-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> To clarify, because you most push all newly mined VRSC funds, from a taddr, to zaddr, then back to taddr, to stake your funds. This dis-incentivizes storing any balance in zaddrs

[19-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It also provides a clear link between t => z => t, because people shield the exact amount of their block reward, then unshield it. Timing and amount analysis removes any privacy from the VRSC chain

[19-Nov-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So, what I say is just not for fun. I choose my words carefully

[19-Nov-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The ITM/metaverse attack doesn't even need to be used against VRSC, because their privacy is so bad

[19-Nov-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Anybody that tells you otherwise, including miketout, is lying
