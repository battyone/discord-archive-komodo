[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have similar tech but focus on slightly different things, I would say

[16-Jul-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> I see it on Twitter

[16-Jul-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have been involved with Pirate since the day it started

[16-Jul-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> but I remember reading about something on Hush and metadata, is that a feature that ARRR also has, or it's unique to Hush?

[16-Jul-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is a much older project

[16-Jul-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> OK, I've also been following ARRR from the beginning

[16-Jul-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush+Pirate use about 90% of the same code. Both have Sapling shielded transactions. Pirate enforces them, while Hush still allows old non-private stuff. Hush has smart contracts, while Pirate does not, since they are not currently compatible with zaddrs

[16-Jul-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> ah...ok...didn't realise Hush had smart contracts

[16-Jul-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Pirate is more focused on financial privacy and Hush is more focused on communication privacy. The very internals are very similar, but the layers in the middle and the top (the GUIs/etc) is where they different. And their supply curves/etc

[16-Jul-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We just added smart contracts to Hush in April with our new mainnet

[16-Jul-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we haven't really marketed that much yet

[16-Jul-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> OK now I understand better

[16-Jul-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> and the messenger is still being built I think, not ready yet

[16-Jul-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have KMD-style cryptoconditions (which are now rebranded to Antara Modules, i think)

[16-Jul-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @D2D by "messenger" you mean SilentDragon, we have windows binaries and source release here: https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragon/releases

[16-Jul-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it does have the beginnings of "messenger-like functionality", but the UI is still being worked on. You can send me a message via "Help -> Send Duke Feedback", or send a random person a text message up to 512 bytes

[16-Jul-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "not ready yet" is a perpetual state in cryptocoins

[16-Jul-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Everything is always being worked on

[16-Jul-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> Yes that's how it's also called on your site:, says: "Private Cryptocurrency and Messenger on Zero Knowledge Proof Encryption"

[16-Jul-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> OK so it's basically at a good stage

[16-Jul-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> In the future hopefully on app stores too

[16-Jul-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> --

[16-Jul-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> I asked this question also on Komodo today...if someone launches a blockchain on Komodo, you have all the features you need and it's great, but I don't think there is an infrastructure similar to Ethereum, with wallets like Metamask, for dapps. Or maybe there is?

[16-Jul-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @D2D there is, but web-based wallets like Metamask don't exist in Bitcoin world, because mostly people don't think they are safe. I surely don't

[16-Jul-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Never ever trust your private keys to a browser.

[16-Jul-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD does have many GUI mobile + desktop wallets that support asset chains, explorers, many things

[16-Jul-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> OK

[16-Jul-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @D2D I don't mean to be mean, but KMD tech actually works. I haven' seen ETH tech that people use, but I know very little about ETH world

[16-Jul-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> I think KMD is safer, more scalable and private, so it's better

[16-Jul-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ETH was the best thing to make non-mineable tokens for a few minutes, but that is not a feature that should make it worth anything now. A bajillion projects, including KMD, can do that for you, cheaper and better

[16-Jul-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And KMD doesn't tax you for every transaction on your chain

[16-Jul-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ETH gas/etc

[16-Jul-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> but it's hard to create something that uses the coins I think

[16-Jul-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> Ethereum has a lot for that

[16-Jul-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> https://composer.kmd.io/ changes a lot

[16-Jul-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> They are not great, I mean Metamask is clunky

[16-Jul-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's directly competing with ETH, to make things easier

[16-Jul-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There was no GUI to make HUSH, it's way beyond the scope of a GUI builder like that. It's got a lot of custom stuff. But that GUI chain builder enables so many people to make custom KMD chains, with no CLI requirements.

[16-Jul-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> Yes I mean that is fantastic, I saw it today

[16-Jul-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> (Composer)

[16-Jul-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is why Hush transitioned from our own custom codebase to a KMD-based codebase

[16-Jul-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> ok

[16-Jul-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and various other reasons

[16-Jul-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, since I am a KMD dev, I wrote a lot of code that went into Hush + KMD. Using KMD meant I only had to write half as much code ðŸ˜…

[16-Jul-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> But Ethereum I think is ahead for building dapps, just in terms of infrastructure

[16-Jul-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's falling apart

[16-Jul-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !ticker eth

[16-Jul-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> A friend of mine sent me this for example yesterday:
https://console.atra.io/

[16-Jul-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is not interested in competing against ETH. KMD is doing that

[16-Jul-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> OK

[16-Jul-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But we do have smart contracts

[16-Jul-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> I'm asking because I think Komodo has better security, privacy and scalability

[16-Jul-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> (than Ethereum)

[16-Jul-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @D2D http://cryptoconditions.info/

[16-Jul-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have a few of those contracts enabled, and basically, you can make an instance of a contract with your own addresses/etc

[16-Jul-19 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> OK

[16-Jul-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> good afternoon friends

[16-Jul-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> good afternoon

[16-Jul-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !tip @franciscana23 25 hush

[16-Jul-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> :money_mouth: @dukeleto sent @franciscana23 **25.00 HUSH** (â‰ˆ $0.89).

[16-Jul-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @franciscana23 tell us some news from Venezuela, what is the "word on the street" ?

[16-Jul-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I dont trust any news I hear from traditional outlets, especially on Venezuela

[16-Jul-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Wow.  Blood bath

[16-Jul-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's a good time to mine

[16-Jul-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Whenever price takes a dive, silly short-sighted miners react to that, migrating to coins that seem to have higher profit or turning off rigs. This is when you can mine a lot when diff is low

[16-Jul-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @franciscana23 do you do any mining in Venezuela? I am fascinated by things down there, the cost of electricity/gas allows for many things

[16-Jul-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> So I just trade my gpus for asics

[16-Jul-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Turns out I'm alot more efficient energy wise

[16-Jul-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> And my solar panels still outweigh my mining consumption

[16-Jul-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> So technically I'm mining at 0 cost. :)

[16-Jul-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I guess the cost of the panels

[16-Jul-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Mining with the power of the sun is a very smart thing to do

[16-Jul-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Only if you mine the right things

[16-Jul-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Time will tell

[16-Jul-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Nice

[16-Jul-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> What's the cost of gas and electricity in Venezuela?

[16-Jul-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> basically 0 compared to the rest of the world

[16-Jul-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Some people mine coins with gas generators

[16-Jul-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> So I have to learn how to import and export keys for a z address.  I want to start mining to z address.  But I'm been unsuccessful at setting it up for pirate

[16-Jul-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> So scared becauses there's no visibility on the block chain explorer

[16-Jul-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can verify transactions happened with a txid

[16-Jul-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but you can't see addresses or balances

[16-Jul-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `z_getnewaddress`

[16-Jul-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> and you're done

[16-Jul-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I did some weird things with wallet.dat file

[16-Jul-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I was referrj gto my word wallet.dat scenario

[16-Jul-19 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> @dukeleto Excuse me friend for not responding before I had problems with the internet and as for our country Venezuela everything is the same no one does anything to improve our situation both: political, economic and social. I also think that you know much more news from outside the country than we do from here

[16-Jul-19 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> I do not have the necessary equipment to mine but I would love to be able to do it since we have some advantages over other countries, but that is why we must be careful not to be discovered as this is regulated in the country and is not allowed @dukeleto

[16-Jul-19 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `I was referrj gto my word wallet.dat scenario`
again, I don't see what verus has to do with PIRATE or HUSH

[16-Jul-19 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I used same wif key

[16-Jul-19 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> PIRATE doesn't have wifs unless you're a NN or coinbase block mining

[17-Jul-19 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Yes.  I need to learn that
