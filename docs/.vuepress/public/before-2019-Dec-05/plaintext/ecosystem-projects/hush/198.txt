[25-Aug-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @iceyballz if you open the SD git repo with QT creator, it has a wysiwyg GUI editor thing, and you can open open each window/modal/etc of SD and edit it, or create new ones. I have only barely played with it, but it's the easiest way to do GUI stuff for SD: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_Creator

[25-Aug-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you downloaded the Hush binary and using that komodod ?

[25-Aug-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or you using a custom/different komodod ?

[25-Aug-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, take a look at the end of debug.log . I don't actually see any error output, it looks like it's trying to sync

[25-Aug-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> downloaded, I manually run hushd batch that starts komodod

[25-Aug-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @iceyballz debug.log will tell you if you have any peers and syncing, or failing to start syncing

[25-Aug-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the fact that you have a space in your pathname, and if your firewall blocks some ports, could also be related

[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> Meanwhile, komodod is using 24% cpu

[25-Aug-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> something is weird there, it's synced 100%, but only to April 30th

[25-Aug-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> what happens if you stop SD GUI, and restart?

[25-Aug-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is a bug, where it doesn't retry enough

[25-Aug-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> leave the full node running

[25-Aug-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just restart the GUI

[25-Aug-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> so it will eventually move past activating and SD will show fully synced

[25-Aug-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have seen a bug, where if for some reason syncing takes too long, it doesn't keep retrying and update the GUI. So the user thinks things are stuck, but restarting GUI wallet fixes it

[25-Aug-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> just restarted to same issue

[25-Aug-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you can paste `hush-cli getinfo` to a github gist, that might help

[25-Aug-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that block hash is not a valid Hush block

[25-Aug-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the directory will be different on windows, but you get the idea

[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> I have a custom datadir
