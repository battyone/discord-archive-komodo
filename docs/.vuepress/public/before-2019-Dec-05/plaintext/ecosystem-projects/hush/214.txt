[dscrd-hush] <Solistica> no hush on bittrex yet?

[09-Sep-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Solistica> oh my gosh thats a huge cost

[09-Sep-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> many shittier exchanges want at least 2 or 3 BTC to list

[09-Sep-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> There is a smarter way to do it, find youtubers to promote it, make 5, 6 videos, and get the community above 10k, there will be lots of exchanges to list you for free, because they need to volume

[09-Sep-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Bernz - Selling LABS> Or, hear me out here. AtomicDEX

[09-Sep-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Bernz - Selling LABS> Pretty sure Hush could get listed for free/fairly cheap on ecosystem project Zaddex. I know that Labs was supposed to be added but I guess there won't be much news on Zaddex until they are out of beta

[09-Sep-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> YouTubers often want to be paid thousands of dollars to mention your product once/etc, or it's a channel that few people watch

[09-Sep-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Bernz - Selling LABS sure, we will probably be listed on Zaddex

[09-Sep-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Bernz - Selling LABS> Komodo DEX should realistically be the only exchange any coin should have to be listed on in order to be traded against most coins anyway, liquidity multiplier and shared liquidity pool means there will be sufficient volume and the ability for arbitrage

[09-Sep-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Coss.io just got $0 deposit fees and cheap withdrawals (USD and EUR). If hush is going to be used to pay for messages, it would be nice to have a good fiat exchange.

Also has negative trading fees for makers if your volume is large enough. Meaning, if you put an order on their books, they pay you (instead of charging you a trading fee).

[09-Sep-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> I'm going to get their listing fee info. They've been around awhile and I've always been hesitant to recommend cause they've had issues, but their new zero fees fiat option was introduced today. Could be worth a good look.

[09-Sep-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> I made lots of videos so I know the price, now is crypto winter and people need money to survive, you can find lots of bargains, another option is to mobilize people to vote on exchange listings

[09-Sep-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> A new exchange would no solution to the  luquidy problems most coins have today. Hush will be on Atomicdex. If the market maker service will work, this could help with that

[09-Sep-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Solistica> if you dont have community, a market maker is a must I would think

[09-Sep-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Solistica> somebody has to provide that liquidity

[09-Sep-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> A new exchange, especially if they want high fees, are not rly necessary

[09-Sep-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Everybody can be market maker in atomic dex

[09-Sep-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> I dont think exchange is the solution either, I propose promoters to enlarge community and make existing community more active, exchange will follow naturally. Exchange will delist you if you dont have a community, but Crex24 cost 0.6BTC, and it is not bad at all, and Stex is 1.5

[09-Sep-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Yes if you have no community it's hard. But Hush has a community

[09-Sep-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Sure we can make it even bigger

[09-Sep-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> But I would to prefer to brake out of this crypto filter bubble (Twitter etc)

[09-Sep-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> based on all the exchanges I dealt with, Crex24 is the best. The second option is to try the second tier Asian exchanges, most of them are in big trouble since all ERC20 tokes are going to hell, they look for minable coins with good dev, Komodo certainly has a name there

[09-Sep-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Hush is a little bit like a political Movement..."Bringing free Speech to all over the World"

[09-Sep-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> its more then crypto. We just have to see this

[09-Sep-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> so we should not attract the crypto shillers out there. We should aim to the ppl who are prisoners of their own government

[09-Sep-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> (in my opinion)

[09-Sep-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> that is my point, if you are good, you have to let people know it, I see lots of good coins go unnoticed because the dev dont feel comfortable to shrill their coins, maybe time to get a professional manager, there should be a marketing person, right?

[09-Sep-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> the point is. You want to shill to whom? Within the Crypto Blabla bubble is no Space for solid projects who are more then "you can get free money"

[09-Sep-19 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> So Crypto youtubers and so on are wasting money for me

[09-Sep-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> reach out to distress rescues, human right watch societies and so on is smarter

[09-Sep-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> marketing will always have huge part of wasting, I do the math for you, since I did it, 200 dollars you can find a youtuber with 20k subscriber, you tell him what to talk about, his video will generate 10k views, 1000 people will understand the concept, 200 will join the community, yes we wasted money on lots of people. The point is, you will never find a method of promotion that suits you unless you try it

[09-Sep-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> you will have plenty of reasons to reject every method of promotion

[09-Sep-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
