[dscrd-hush] <penguin> Do all chains need a node-daemon update for the upcoming update?

[12-Jul-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto What are the plans for the end of 2019 by HUSH? If you describe briefly

[12-Jul-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> @dukeleto  does the file upload means you can actually store a file on Hush blockchain and sell access to it based on some smart contract -> build new mega upload which is decentralized ? üòÉ

[12-Jul-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> where is the file exactly stored?

[12-Jul-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> won't it bloat the chain ?

[12-Jul-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Passcombo is it limited size

[12-Jul-19 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @penguin all full nodes need to update to the new list of notaries so that DPoW continues to work for the node. Nodes who do not update, will see erratic/absent notarizations

[12-Jul-19 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal so @Berg is the timeline master and can answer time-based questions like that üòÉ

[12-Jul-19 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã currently all stored on-chain. In theory you could sell access to data stored, yes

[12-Jul-19 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's stored in encrypted form on every full node

[12-Jul-19 10:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for scalability/bloat concerns, we will have a smallish max-file-size limit, and we can create a sidechain like HUSHFILE dedicated to larger files, or show people how to make their own dedicated chains

[12-Jul-19 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> max file size will probably be between 4 to 20MB, but initially I will make things work for smaller files, up to 500KB

[12-Jul-19 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is also the option to send somebody a link to a torrent or IPFs, so we don't need to store all data in our blockchain. for larger files, we will just store metadata about the larger file

[12-Jul-19 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It will be best for small files, because it will take a lot of CPU time, even with fast Sapling zaddrs, to upload files. That will also limit abuse, large files will take dozens of CPU hours to upload

[12-Jul-19 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã let me know if you have more questions, those were good

[13-Jul-19 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> thx , this answeres satisfies me üòÉ actually sending link to a file is enough, and limiting file to simple txt msg is fine

[13-Jul-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> personally to keep the main chain low GB I would go with storage off the main chain, but if this is already limited with cpu usage on encrypting then might be no problem

[13-Jul-19 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã few years ago me and couple friends was looking at decentralize way to share files. We used to create a newsgroup room with articles to information(to nzb files). Now with hush you can create listing group(Z-addresses) and store nzb files on the chain(20kb-500kb).

[13-Jul-19 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> since we only want our own group(scene) to know about the file. then from then on wards it get shared into streams of other Z-addresses groups.

[13-Jul-19 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> only thing I wonder is sometiems you want the file to eb temporary (ultimately all files have some limited life time) so I only question permenently writing those files into chain

[13-Jul-19 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> as all people ever will need to sync them no matter they are valuable for anybody still

[13-Jul-19 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã nice thing about Hush compared to pirate coin, is smart contracts. You can create a entire side chain (valid for one year) and those who host it will get paid in hush for allowing users to access them. 
Currently am still prototyping a website build on top of Hush. I know there other projects but combining 3 project(golem network, file chain + hush)

[13-Jul-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> actually isn't IPFS perfect solution for storage? so using Hush you would send the key to decrypt file on IPFS, made autoamtic and simple for usage would do the job, and IPFS would be charging for storage of encyrpted file a daily/monthly charge or sth

[13-Jul-19 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> that correct, IPFS can act as a secondary chain

[13-Jul-19 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> only problem IPFS is caching between nodes, not all nodes will cache that information yet. Accessing the information is slow. Takes about 3 - 10 seconds to get a file at the current moment(some takes 1 second), I know there are optimizing it and will like to see how far they get and the costing

[13-Jul-19 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> most of the IPFS centrally hosted and those speed are fast but I cannot trust them with information.

[13-Jul-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> currently my setup is Ethereum + Filecoin + Golem Network
Now attempting to be [Komodo base(Hush) / bitcoin / Ethereum] + Filecoin+ Network

[13-Jul-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Filecoin in simple is incentive for people providing IPFS storage.

[dscrd-hush] <ITM> lol, Proof-of-Capacity. They joking right

[13-Jul-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> why cannot trust ipfs with information ? 3-10 seconds - what you exactly mean by getting the file? download depends on file size and connection

[13-Jul-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã yes, getting the file. Looking up a file is quick, getting the file from node is long, you want to get 10 files at a time, now sometime the node hosting it is down and that the issue. It be unfair to measure one file, so I measure 10 files about 10 times, all different files. The time average is 3 to 10 seconds per file.

[13-Jul-19 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> same as p2p.

[13-Jul-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763

[13-Jul-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[13-Jul-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> so 10 sec does not bother me so much üòÉ

[13-Jul-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I try to keep it below 256kb object to avoid splitting, files range from 200kb to - 220kb

[13-Jul-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> all single objects

[13-Jul-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> on tha case it is slow

[13-Jul-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> my website (angular 7 base) in total is 400kb, the api is small and updates on blockchain.
So I have small custom chromium base version of browser, its hooks up to IPFS storage, now you visit a website(Ethereum object), the ethereum object you have links to the main IPFS object.
Now the IPFS will have links to all the contents of the website. 
It takes 10 seconds to loads up and then interacts with smart contract. (No purpose yet)
Currently I want to view news today(default view), it will check ethereum contract for any updates and then access IPFS file.
The news will load. Now I want to post a comment, it will post on ethereum against that contract. 
Last thing I have is I want to upload new content, it will upload image, call golem network to process it and the result get stored in IPFS object, the hash then gets posted to ethereum network.

[13-Jul-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> that how far I got so far, stupid but its just for fun at the moment.

[13-Jul-19 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is starting to experiment with
blockchain to create a more efficient, robust, and secure platform using a blockchain protocol
that will allow personnel from anywhere to transmit secure messages or process transactions that
can be traced through numerous channels of a decentralized ledger. The application will be used
in different ways, including facilitating communication between units and headquarters, and
transmitting information between intelligence officers and the Pentagon.
