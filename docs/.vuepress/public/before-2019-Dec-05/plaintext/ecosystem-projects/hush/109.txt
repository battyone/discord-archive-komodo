[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> does anyone have a link to that wallet?

[05-Jun-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> what i just downloaded doesnt seem to be a gui

[05-Jun-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> looking for 0.3.6

[05-Jun-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> what i have is a terminal app that i dont really want to launch

[05-Jun-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Looks like komodo has deleted some links to the wallet

[05-Jun-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you cannot download it anymore

[05-Jun-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's deprecated/deleted/gone

[05-Jun-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you either have it or you don't

[05-Jun-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cryptographic i think your version is too old to talk to current servers, unfortunately

[05-Jun-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cryptographic you can also use chameleon and magnum wallets, i hear

[05-Jun-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> can we mine to the tipbot?

[05-Jun-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I would personally just use the web wallet

[05-Jun-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Can't speak to the tipbot because I don't really know it all that well

This seems to be another method to safeguard your #KMD funds ðŸ‘‡

1. Download Verus Agama and create new seed/address
https://t.co/KPTXwiebx4
2. Import old Komodo Agama seed in @ChameleonPay or @Magnum_Wallet 
3. Send funds from Chameleon/Magnum to new address

[05-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @JWolf (WW Clan leader) don't mine to the tip bot. Much better to mine to an address you control the privkeys for, via the web wallet

[05-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you don't own the funds in the tipbot. not your keys, not your coins

[05-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's for tip money, not college savings

[05-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> lol

[05-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> never mine to addresses you don't control

[05-Jun-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> lol

[05-Jun-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, the tipbot guy @unko would probably not like you because you would slow down the system with lots of small UTXOs

[05-Jun-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the amount of reasons not to do it are large

[05-Jun-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> nobody controls anything apparently

[05-Jun-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> I feel safe in OceanQt, I use it for btch and I am hoping that they will integrate HUHS3 soon ... Or I will try:troll:

[05-Jun-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Now, if you ask me, IS IT PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE? Yes. But really, don't.

[05-Jun-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <unko> withdrawing users will pay in their fees ðŸ˜Ž

[05-Jun-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> I was just wondering

[05-Jun-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @unko touchÃ© . the miners will love it

[05-Jun-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's the circle of .... fees

[05-Jun-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> right

[05-Jun-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Luffy i have been talking to decker to get hush3 into OceanQT, it's nontrivial due to us being a source code fork rather than a simple asset chain

[05-Jun-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but it's on my radar

[05-Jun-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @JWolf (WW Clan leader) it's a good question and hopefully you have data to make an informed decision :troll:

[05-Jun-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> 4sure thanx

[05-Jun-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I always feared something like this would happen to HUSH-NG, this node.js style hack

[05-Jun-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so it's good that I threw it away already

[05-Jun-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I had no way to verify the 345345 dependencies were not malware

[05-Jun-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> why do I always get errors when trying to send large amounts of Hush on web?

[05-Jun-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @JWolf (WW Clan leader) you have too many small UTXOs

[05-Jun-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> So here's an ignorant question by yours truly. What's the different method SilentDragon is using and what's the extra layer of protection not using node.js?

[05-Jun-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> set your payout size larger

[05-Jun-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and sweep funds into medium sized amounts

[05-Jun-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg glad you asked

[05-Jun-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SilentDragon does not use web technology. Agama is essentially Chrome talking to your full node

[05-Jun-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> @dukeleto  I was looking at Decker code and lost my head:rolf:  ... I'm looking at how it did with other assets. I will continue learning then:thinkaboutit:

[05-Jun-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so SilentDragon is a bunch of C++, that I compile

[05-Jun-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and it makes a binary, that you click on, to start

[05-Jun-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all the code it has is known when I compile it, before you start it

[05-Jun-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's "static"

[05-Jun-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the Agama wallet, that is Chrome!!!

[05-Jun-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> to make that, you have to use, literally, thousands of javascript packages

[05-Jun-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush-NG was given to me, I inherited it

[05-Jun-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am not a JS coder, by choice. I was given this, 10,000 lines of dependencies: https://github.com/MyHush/hush-ng/blob/master/package-lock.json

[05-Jun-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> every time you run some commands, it gives you a new 10,000 lines of dependencies, slightly different, with slightly different versions and maybe some new, some removed. It's completely incomprehensible to see if some kind of malware has slipped in

[05-Jun-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You would have to read millions of lines of compacted unreadable code, which nobody does

[05-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, nodeJS packages do not have to correspond to the code they show you on Github

[05-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that itself, is mega scary

[05-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SilentDragon is older, more reliable, safer tech. Similar to OceanQT

[05-Jun-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> Ohhhhh, The reading with link above ... I've screwed up:Surprised_Pikachu:

[05-Jun-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> when will we have SilentDragon for the less literate?

[05-Jun-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg did i answer your question? I really do want us to explain this stuff to a wider audience

[05-Jun-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you can compile software, SilentDragon already exists

[05-Jun-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can be on the bleeding edge with me. I need a few brave souls to crush bugs for bounties

[05-Jun-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> @Berg will web wallet work for BTCH?

[05-Jun-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> doesn't make sense to make binaries at this exact juncture, but if we can fix a few open issues then it would make sense

[05-Jun-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> that was my point...

[05-Jun-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cryptographic current web wallet does not do BTCH, but we are working on standing up a BTCH web wallet

[05-Jun-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gilardh i think we used to have wallet.btchush. org but when we lost that domain we lost that subdomain

[05-Jun-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hmmmmmmmmm

@cryptomaroc @MyHushTeam Download Komodo OceanQt. 
Go to the folder where you unzipped and enter the "launch_assets" folder and go down to BTCH.cmd and click. The BTCH ocean will open. Go to receive and send your btch. Good luck, if you need help, here and in discord.

[05-Jun-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> awesome, yes. BTCH is an asset chain supported by OceanQT. It doesn't have a super massive blockchain, so it's not like syncing KMD or ZEC

[05-Jun-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> It is very fast, it take 16 nodes in a short time. To get private key, just like other QT........ dumpprivkey wallet and address

[05-Jun-19 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> *not wallet, command

[05-Jun-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> where can I get a z address?

[05-Jun-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @dukeleto Yes! That helped my understanding ðŸ˜ƒ

[05-Jun-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Is SilentDragon a pre-existing package that you're modifying to run Hush? Or is this ground-up?

[05-Jun-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> @JWolf (WW Clan leader)  I think Hushmate works well with Z directions ... ????

[05-Jun-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> We have theft epidemic again, it reminds me of 2015, when all the exchanges stolen every day

[05-Jun-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg i am modifying zecwallet to the needs of Hush and to add HushList support. I build on top of zecwallet, it's not ground-up

[05-Jun-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that means zcash foundation pays to support SilentDragon, because we pull in new code from zecwallet

[05-Jun-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> instead of Hush-NG, which I had to maintain completely alone

[05-Jun-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> So SilentDragon is the Hush branding and revision?

[05-Jun-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Did you come up with the name?

[05-Jun-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am willing to pay bounties for short translations about this Agama hack, FYI. We need to tell people that don't speak English

[05-Jun-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @musicayfarandula  ^^^^^

[05-Jun-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg the actual story is that radix42 made the SevenSeas Pirate wallet as a fork of zecwallet, and then modified it for Hush, named it SilentDragon and said "hey Duke, here you go, a fork of zecwallet". And I kind of liked the name, because Hush migrating to a Komodo chain is a "Silent Dragon". The name isn't written in stone, but also, "HushWallet" made me want to puke

[05-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then i went crazy and added a bunch of stuff to SilentDragon, like notarization height and coingecko price, and fixes rando bugs

[05-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> mostly SilentDragon needs a logo

[05-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> a super dope dragon with Hush logo

[05-Jun-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We should put out a bounty on that ðŸ˜ƒ

[05-Jun-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all super serious bugs are fixed, it's just branding. A logo at startup

[05-Jun-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Design contest?

[05-Jun-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and i am trying to change the color theme, because right now its boring as f

[05-Jun-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I also like the name, I was just curious if it was pre-existing as a wallet name for a coin other than Hush, just didn't know the origin

[05-Jun-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but functionally, it's awesome

[05-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we can migrate our translation files from Hush-NG to SilentDragon. They are not lost, just take a bit of work to migrate

[05-Jun-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> right now silentdragon supports about 4 or 5 languages i think, via zecwallet

[05-Jun-19 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> If I can help with something ... Just tell me

[05-Jun-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Do you have specifications for that HUSH Dragon logo? Like pixel size / format?
