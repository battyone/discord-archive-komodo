[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> non-miners cannot understand this

[26-Nov-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> lets focus on things we can influence...like our tech

[26-Nov-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio thanks for being a voice of reason

[26-Nov-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> exchanges come and go

[26-Nov-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> part of the game

[26-Nov-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> exchanges are tissues

[26-Nov-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> CEXs are from the decade of 2010s..

[26-Nov-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Time to usher in a new decade without their greedm

[26-Nov-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Captain BTCP paid Binance (or a similar exchange) I think $100K USD to list them. They delisted them a year later for not making them enough money

[26-Nov-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> How can you make more money when the price is going down?

[26-Nov-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just a little historical tidbit

[26-Nov-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Captain study how complex this website is: https://whattomine.com

Calculate how profitable it is to mine selected altcoins in comparison to ethereum or bitcoin

[26-Nov-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Captain let's turn it around: "How do you think miners make money?"

[26-Nov-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> your question makes no sense to me

[26-Nov-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> MINERS DO NOT BUY COINS

[26-Nov-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Price, who cares?

[26-Nov-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's all about difficulty to mine

[26-Nov-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> mine hush and "sell it"

[26-Nov-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> miners do not buy coins

[26-Nov-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So price going "down", that doesn't matter. Because miners don't buy coins

[26-Nov-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I know, the difficulty increases with the mining load

[26-Nov-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Here is an example

[26-Nov-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> profit can only be calculated when a miner sells

[26-Nov-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the "price" of the coin, for the last week while you are mining it, is completely and utterly NOTHING

[26-Nov-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Yet, most people use that number as their "profit"

[26-Nov-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the price when you sell it, is all that matters

[26-Nov-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so, if difficulty drops MUCH MORE than price

[26-Nov-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> miners make more money

[26-Nov-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if that is weird, it's because you are not a miner

[26-Nov-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> it is not weard.

[26-Nov-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this doesn't even take into account wild BTC/fiat stuff. You can denominate profit in sats or fiat

[26-Nov-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, even more complex, you could be making profit in fiat and losing money in sats, and vice versa

[26-Nov-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gosh, and this is #general

[26-Nov-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I totally get it. But we are in a low liquidity situation. We cannot deny that.

[26-Nov-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you keep making different wrong statements

[26-Nov-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> can't keep up

[26-Nov-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> now you speak of liquidity, yes

[26-Nov-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> paying for liquidity, it doesn't work

[26-Nov-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> exchanges are just scams

[26-Nov-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> CEXs, anyway. I highly encourage using AtomicDEX

[26-Nov-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You pay $50k and you get no return

[26-Nov-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You pay for the ability to be allowed to buy your own coin and sell it

[26-Nov-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You can't recoup that money

[26-Nov-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Now you might see why this statement required a rebuttal 😅 `what if price will never increase. Mining will become not profitable. Miners will leave.`

[26-Nov-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> The tech is what gives a project value

[26-Nov-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Let's agree, if an exchange wants to add us for free or a tiny "integration fee", let's do it

[26-Nov-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Otherwise, i am not paying scammers

[26-Nov-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @Captain That's fair

[26-Nov-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Bisq, Crex24 or TradeSatoshi

[26-Nov-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> The tech is good, the idea is good. But if nobody buys it. It's still worth nothing...

[26-Nov-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> With an exchnge listing like the one you want, that makes it -$50k

[26-Nov-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We choose to start from a point of not paying exchanges

[26-Nov-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> it was just a random figure.

[26-Nov-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It's accurate

[26-Nov-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Try with the free exchanges

[26-Nov-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> allright, I get that. I agree. I will try and contact free exhanges. See where it goes

[26-Nov-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> i understand you @Captain its frustrating to see projects with stealed whitepapers are much in front pricewise

[26-Nov-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> but it will change someday

[26-Nov-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> or this will all burn to hell

[26-Nov-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> It is frustrating indeed

[26-Nov-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I am following Hush since may 2017

[26-Nov-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I don't get why it isn't booming yet.

[26-Nov-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> idea and tech is so good

[26-Nov-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> once we get SDA onto the Google Play store soon, Hush will feel more "real" to a lot of people

[26-Nov-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> why is kmd not booming? It has with distance the best tech for me from the top 100 coins! Average ppl dont give a shit about that atm. This will change

[26-Nov-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is an old joke in KMD #trading channel

[26-Nov-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the price of KMD follows the 1/tech rule

[26-Nov-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the better the tech, the lower the price

[26-Nov-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this applies to HUSH as well

[26-Nov-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> hahah that's a good one

[26-Nov-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> we have one hell of a tech then

[26-Nov-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Kek. We will Hush them all up.

[26-Nov-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> :thinkaboutit: now i understand

[26-Nov-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Lol we have the best tech

[26-Nov-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Bisq is cool. Go talk with them

[26-Nov-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Nov-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> finding unique valid bugs are worth 25 HUSH each

[26-Nov-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we don't assume people work for free around here

[26-Nov-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> try to connect it to your SDL and make some xtns! It's actually pretty cool

[26-Nov-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> xnts?

[26-Nov-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think SDA is what will be the first taste of Hush for many people

[26-Nov-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I will spread the word when it's out

[26-Nov-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> xtns = transactions

[26-Nov-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> oww haha I will

[26-Nov-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's "out" already

[26-Nov-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just not on Google Play, because wow they have so many hoops to jump thru

[26-Nov-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have jumped thru about 90% of the hoops

[26-Nov-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i even PAID GOOGLE $25

[26-Nov-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> to have the privilege of adding my open source software to Play

[26-Nov-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Nice, can't wait until the realse in google play

[26-Nov-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Nov-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> every Hush project has it's own github repo with it's own list of "issues", for features+bugfixes
