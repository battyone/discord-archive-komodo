[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> transactions are in a vector/array, and have indexes 0, 1, 2, ....

[19-Aug-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> Yes, I meat transactions in the same block..

[19-Aug-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, if you upload a file, there is internal magic to make sure the file doesn't get corrupted by misordering

[19-Aug-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, I am talking about transactions in the same block

[19-Aug-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `block` is a variable, and you have an array of transactions in that block

[19-Aug-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> each with an index from 0 ... N

[19-Aug-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> their timestamps must meet very strict criteria, that i couldn't fully explain

[19-Aug-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but TLDR "no fucky stuff" in the timestamps, nothing from the future or past/etc

[19-Aug-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is part of BTC core protocol

[19-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @scubapanda you ask a good question, and I am saying "we got it covered" üôÇ

[19-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The core protocol covers us 90%

[19-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> your question is VERY relevant to file uploads

[19-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is where Hush itself has to invent stuff

[19-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> to make the magic sauce taste good

[19-Aug-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> Ok, I couldn't figure the chronological order of transactions in the same block..

[19-Aug-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @scubapanda if you dump the contents of a block via RPC, the transactions have an order

[19-Aug-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the miner reward MUST be first

[19-Aug-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and everything else after

[19-Aug-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Heno1974 those are all nodes on our old network

[19-Aug-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but none of them are mining

[19-Aug-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Heno1974> @dukeleto  my Z9 is mining HUSH
I hope I have great success

[19-Aug-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @scubapanda maybe that helps ^

[19-Aug-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> see how there is a list of txids, in order? That is the order of the transactions

[19-Aug-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Heno1974 a Z9 mining hush will mine a lot these days! many people have z9m's üôÇ

[19-Aug-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @scubapanda additionally, inside of a tx, you can have hundreds of outputs, and ordering all those is where the HushList magic comes in

[19-Aug-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash protocol disorders them on purpose, to improve privacy, so we undo that at a higher level

[19-Aug-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> @dukeleto Thanks, I'll check what my problems was, tried to figure this out so many moons ago.

[19-Aug-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
