[dscrd-hush] <D2D> What do you mean when you say "adopting"?

[27-Jul-19 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> You can use a coin no one is using. You've got btch section a few lines bellow general, but is almost not active. Dukeleto is lead dev, but he is occupied with HUSH.

[27-Jul-19 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> OK I found it in agama, it's syncing now

[27-Jul-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> OK, very interesting

[27-Jul-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> if I run a blockchain, a friend who is a full stack developer and also experienced with mining etc would be helping me, I wouldn't do it alone

[27-Jul-19 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> In that case he can help you a lot with all side work, if you decide for a new KMD chain.

[27-Jul-19 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @D2D I've just remembered something. BTCH must be allowing z-transactions. I'm trying to mannually check every BTCH block. On my peace of paper it is written that blocks 183991 and 184189 are containing shielded transaction inside. Miner's experimentation. Feel free to check it out.

[27-Jul-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @D2D Not related: if you held BTC, HUSH, SUPERNET or DEX on feb. 1 2018, you can still claim your own BTCH. There is even a tutorial video on youtube, you can find it.

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @Cruz X (10) ```Well Ben Franklin may have said it 240 years ago, but Duke Leto said it more recently...And he might have said it without ever hearing of Ben Franklin say it.``` That was my reply to @dukeleto to the message he sent me (linked at the very end of the review)

[27-Jul-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> he sent me, and then received my reply. the test worked, and then i did a jig 🕺

@SandorReport I am the author. TY

Noticed your bio: "Translating mind-bogglingly complex ideas into plain English."

That's my goal, and let me say it's no easy task

The review deals with many complex ideas in a convoluted history.

I hope I can shine light on the bleedi...

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> dont keep my coins there ofc

[27-Jul-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> its the fastest exchange ive ever useed

[27-Jul-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> thats true. But cant wait to have a decentralized way to change my coins

[27-Jul-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> we need a high vol market, not a DEX imo

[27-Jul-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> both needed ultimately

[27-Jul-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> STEP 1: lets get on tradeogre

[27-Jul-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> that;ll open doors for other (higher vol)  exchanges

[27-Jul-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> @halo kitty rules sorry for disappearing but for some reason Discord locked me out, had to do phone verification to get back in

[27-Jul-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> maybe it's the VPN

[27-Jul-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ^ the power of HUSH

[27-Jul-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> they're watching lol

[27-Jul-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> It makes you realize you are communicating on a centralized system! In the middle of the conversation they just lock you out and you are forced to do verification

[27-Jul-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> mornin'

[27-Jul-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Jul-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> never had with Discord before, only on Twitter, but I think it's the vpn and ip that causes it

[27-Jul-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
