[03-Sep-19 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio it's the Company not allowing the Foundation some rights, basically. The company wants 100% control

[03-Sep-19 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the Foundation thought they had some % of control, but they actually don't

[03-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash Foundation is a US 501c3 non-profit

[03-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ECC is a Swiss company from Zug, and also a US company, since mostly they have US employees to pay

[03-Sep-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> US company is a subsidiary of the Swiss company, since Swiss companies pay less taxes

[03-Sep-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio actually, it's mostly because the US is extremely anti-cryptocoin
