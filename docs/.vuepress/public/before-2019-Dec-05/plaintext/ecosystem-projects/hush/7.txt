[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> replacing main team is pushing this project higher- much higher.

[10-Sep-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Ok, find people to work for free then.

[10-Sep-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Because what you're posting right now is as non-constructive as it could possibly get. All you're doing is bashing a team of volunteers.

[10-Sep-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I exchange with the Team regularly, I have absolutely nothing to blame them. We would need more volunteers but right now it's not a good time for crypto.

[10-Sep-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <chumblaka> so what's new?

[10-Sep-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> Everything is answered expcept about one straight question...what's currently going on with the project and how complete is $hush messenger ?

[10-Sep-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> Don't again say that we have to contribute ..we will definitely will , but what's up till now

[10-Sep-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> Lack of contrinbutors can cause delay ..agree ..but what was the actual plan when announcing the road map last year

[10-Sep-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> $hush messenger should have been delivered months back if I am not wrong ...as promised

[10-Sep-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> And I am not against anyone ...just want to know the status of the project ..I politely sent a dam DM to Duke ..and his reply was not that polite

[10-Sep-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> I am ready to put time in promoting the project ...but not without knowing what's happening

[10-Sep-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> Currently

[10-Sep-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> Sorry if I am rude ..

[10-Sep-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> I have great respect for Duke and Berg ..for all your efforts

[10-Sep-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We are searching to contract a developer to contribute in packaging Hush-NG for release. Duke has been working on finding someone for binaries, but progress has been slow. Hush-NG is in the very end stages, we just need to acquire the right talent to help it fully get there in a timely fashion. It is being worked on.

[10-Sep-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> If everything goes right and community contributes actively ..on a rough scale when can we expect it to be released

[10-Sep-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> The price is already down more than 90% ..it's high time to speed things a bit ..

[10-Sep-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Unfortunately it's really hard to gauge for me, not being a coder and not knowing the extent of the packaging process. If the community wishes to help us in locating a binary packager, it would be greatly appreciated. We've had a hard time recruiting anyone from the KMD team to help out.

[10-Sep-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> Great...thanks allot ...is it like we don't have much progress bacuse if which no much updates on Twitter ..or lack of volunteers who can post frequent updates ?

[10-Sep-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KayNut> @Berg  @dukeleto @gilardh @FireMartZ I hope you guys know how much your work is appreciated and that I feel sorry that you have to be targeted by people who are completely frustrated about not getting rich the next day they bought Hush. Hush NG/List are huge projects in my eyes and I love where Hush is going with KMD notarization. All we can hope for is that the price drops a little more, so we can accumulate even more coins. Much love from my side to all team members and contributors. Good n8!

[10-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @KayNut Thanks !

[10-Sep-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Thanks, we appreciate it. üòÉ

[10-Sep-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <beardefiance> Yes some of you sound as if you invested in a stock or something.  This has to happen organically...keep moving ahead.  We will contribute!

[10-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Again went the discontent with a low price? Those who write this, he sees how other coins have fallen in value? Do not forget that to release great news in the falling market is a useless occupation, let's wait for the bullish trend

[10-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> Like I told you before nothing was done from time last dev quit  because of the team (lazy and incompetent)  -- if this is community coin those guys should step down -- no one wants to work with them.

[10-Sep-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Uh

[10-Sep-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm new to the team...

[10-Sep-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Not sure if you knew this, or have been around for long enough to know that I'm a new member.

[10-Sep-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> I don't think you are new member

[10-Sep-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @KayNut Much love ‚ù§

[10-Sep-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yes, I am.

[10-Sep-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I became a member of the team in April.

[10-Sep-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm the reason there's any social media outreach whatsoever, but keep slinging "lazy and incompetent" around like you've been here to help.

[10-Sep-18 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I was a Hush holder, just like you, who decided that instead of sitting back and bitching, that I would get involved.

[10-Sep-18 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> So I got involved.

[10-Sep-18 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Seems like a foreign concept for most.

[10-Sep-18 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> Ok then maybe you are newer member -- so will keep you just fire other two

[10-Sep-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yes, because I can run and develop a coin by myself with no coding skills.

[10-Sep-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Sounds like a brilliant plan.

[10-Sep-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> well tell just one think they develop by themselves from January -- just one think and please don't lie I really know what I am talking about and I know some of those lazy douchebags

[10-Sep-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> #hush-github will tell all

[10-Sep-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> things they develop themselves

[10-Sep-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> From what I see this one person Berg team needs good developer

[10-Sep-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @Art0077 Now you are developer. Do something, don't be lazy

[10-Sep-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> but first you have to figure out some roadmap for Hush -- what to develop I think messaging is stupid at least 15 other coins has messaging. We need some use case's  for Hush .

[10-Sep-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> Hush as a payment coin will not work because we are competing against BTC, Litecoin, NANO etc

[10-Sep-18 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> something average person will understand. Most coins have privacy futures and HUSH is no leader in those.

[10-Sep-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> So put some ideas here, choose best option and we will figure it out how to get there, and think about changing this ugly webpage -- look like 5 year old designed -- do something more professional

[11-Sep-18 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> @Art0077#3766  did you read anything about Hush? it has a use case diff then payment coin only :thonking:

[11-Sep-18 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> PS constructive cryticism is when you say what YOU will do better, not just say what others should

[11-Sep-18 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> I did 1 translation, what you did ? üòÉ

[11-Sep-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> @Berg  is there a to-do list regarding overall (tech and marketing things) to make with hush with some estimation of ETAs and hours needed to perform ? good to have one to make things clear at least to know what needs to be done

[11-Sep-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> A to-do list would be handy.

[11-Sep-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I contacted the former developer who created the official ad on bitcointalk (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2008578.0). It is OK to update his 1st post. Once this page in English updated we could contact the other members who created the ads in other languages ‚Äã‚Äãso that they update their post too.
What could help us is to get back in touch with these members and see if they are OK to update their post.
Chinese - Thanks to poiseulle
Czech - Thanks to TheTrunK
French - Thanks to Ratatackeur
German - Thanks to jedigeiss
Indonesian - Thanks to rozee
Polish - Thanks to Heimer
Russian - Thanks to fq, frHUxP * joE
Turkish - Thanks to Cean

If we can not get in touch with them (some have not logged in to the Bitcointalk site for over 1 year). It will certainly remove their links visible on the page https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2008578.0

If they are OK, we can translate the ad, create the new graphics with the translated texts, insert them on github and finally give them the code to insert in their post to update their page.

A large part of this work requires no knowledge of development.

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> and is not updated at all.

[11-Sep-18 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Zdash i think is what its called previously.. before joseph passover to radix and was rebranded as hush. U are looking at the history book of hush ...üòÄ

[11-Sep-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> There is a link to this page on HUSH's official announcement on bitcointalk.

[11-Sep-18 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Either we can update this page in french, or create a new page or we remove the link.

[11-Sep-18 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> I guees it is a legacy thing...

[11-Sep-18 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Inheritance

[11-Sep-18 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Link may need update .. üòÄ

[11-Sep-18 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> If there is some other page to point to

[11-Sep-18 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Its just 1 year.. in crypto thats a long time and everything has change

[11-Sep-18 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I agree. We must be vigilant so that all our media are up to date.

[11-Sep-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> wow, that French ZDash ANN is a blast from the past, from before I was involved in Hush

[11-Sep-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I didn't know vaklinov was involved in ZDash, it makes more sense now that they wrote the GUI swing wallet for Hush

[11-Sep-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I did not find a HUSH page on wikipedia. Would it be useful to create one? (if YES, add to the to-do list.)

[11-Sep-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Doing nothing on wikipedia. I came across the page: https://crypto.fanswiki.com/Hush that I updated (little text and link).
To see if it would be useful to add other information like the pool list and the list of exchanges. No need to be a developer and it does not cost anything. (To add on the to-do list?)

[11-Sep-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoGuard> what make price so down?

[11-Sep-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Any drop right now.  There is necessarily an explanation but I do not know it.

[11-Sep-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Is this page still relevant for following progress? https://dashboard.myhush.org/

[11-Sep-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> It should be updated as well and can be used for the to-do list. I am not sure that this is the easiest method.

[11-Sep-18 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the person who maintained it is no longer with the team, so consider it a snapshot of time. it's not currently updated

[11-Sep-18 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Gotcha

[12-Sep-18 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MOCHO 17> canb someone explane what is this btc hush ? is a fork or ?

[12-Sep-18 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> It is an Komodo asset chain which was distributed as an airdrop to holders hush and a couple other coins, including BTC, it's sort of an sister coin to hush under the Komodo ecosystem which means it gets updates through their development.

[12-Sep-18 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> some information here: http://btchush.org/

[12-Sep-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MrWrong> I've criticized BTCH project

[12-Sep-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MrWrong> From my perspective it's unusefull project and just distractor

[12-Sep-18 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MrWrong> I'm senior software developer on a national bank

[12-Sep-18 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
