[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 101 block re-org for ol' Duke

[26-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> is what I want for my bday

[26-Aug-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So, i will explain

[26-Aug-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ZEC has no DPoW. So, if you have enough hashrate, you can 51% attack ZEC. If you decide to rollback 101 blocks, that triggers a failsafe that SHUTS DOWN ALL ZCASH NODES.

[26-Aug-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> A human must reboot them, and do work to figure out which chain to trust. All DPoW chains do not suffer from this horrible problem

[26-Aug-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright all it takes is a few zcash farms to get hacked

[26-Aug-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> I believe you could keep mining both chains and keep shutting them down as well

[26-Aug-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and maybe sprinkle in some NH

[26-Aug-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright now imagine filling blocks for almost nothing with woodchipper during that re-org attack

[26-Aug-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> to slow down p2p network propagation

[26-Aug-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and CPU dos the nodes, too

[26-Aug-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gosh the fireworks would be amazing

[26-Aug-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright i want to hear a specific way that the woodchipper might not be effective, so I can prove you wrong

[26-Aug-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The cost estimates on the site right now go by the spec, so multiply costs by 2X to ensure you get into all real-life pools

[26-Aug-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> can't know unless you try it really

[26-Aug-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is still $8/day

[26-Aug-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> maybe attack vectors look good on paper then flat out don't work

[26-Aug-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ZEC is also halving their blocktime soon

[26-Aug-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that will double the cost of the attack per day, since there are 2x more blocks per day

[26-Aug-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright well, my 1 1MB xtn that cost 0.0002 to get into next block is a good PoC that I can make any number of those. What would be proof that it worked for you? Doing it for a few hours?

[26-Aug-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> few consecutive blocks I guess?

[26-Aug-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> hours is malicious, don't do that

[26-Aug-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> anyway to make joinsplits "heavier"?

[26-Aug-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright heavier for who?

[26-Aug-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> like with normal txes, can make them heavy to validate with many vins

[26-Aug-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> do you mean expensive? heavy implies a CPU resource dos to me

[26-Aug-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> fill a block with as many inputs as possible and it'll be very "heavy"

[26-Aug-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> no matter the network

[26-Aug-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it all comes down to total xtn size in bytes

[26-Aug-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> not quite

[26-Aug-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> not at all really

[26-Aug-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> you can have a massive OP_RETURN and it won't be "heavy"

[26-Aug-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> it takes a lot to check sigs on vins though

[26-Aug-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> if there are 100ks

[26-Aug-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> well, we are probably not talking about the same thing

[26-Aug-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the problem is that taddr xtns have a tight limit on total xtn size, zaddrs don't

[26-Aug-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> yea you're talking about filling blocks, i'm talking about making them cost more to validate

[26-Aug-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is the essence, Zcash did this on purpose, as well

[26-Aug-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> was just curious what can make a ztx "heavier"

[26-Aug-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> what's the bottleneck for validating them?

[26-Aug-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> oh, i understand now

[26-Aug-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> well, they are heavy by nature. But you are onto something very good

[26-Aug-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There is a way to make creating zaddr xtns very fast, which makes the attack crazy more effective/cheaper

[26-Aug-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and leave validating the same, which gives attacker a big edge

[26-Aug-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Daira mentioned this on Github as an improvement to the attack

[26-Aug-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright it has to go to sapling rust code to validate them, crossing language boundaries, etc. It's a heavy operation

[26-Aug-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but you can essentially cache most of the operation of creating them, kind of like a transaction template

[26-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so instead of your attack taking 15 minutes to fill a block, it takes 15 seconds to make the zaddr xtn

[26-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> ZEC have a testnet?

[26-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright so 10 full zec blocks is good enough proof for you?

[26-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, they believe in testnets ðŸ˜…

[26-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> just do it on testnet

[26-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright no thanks, but you can

[26-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> ðŸ¤·

[26-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Not looking for extra work, fine sir

[26-Aug-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> testnet isn't likely to be the same

[26-Aug-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I know it works, on all Zcash protocol coins

[26-Aug-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> mining pools with patches and all...

[26-Aug-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the work and cost involved to prove it does not interest me

[26-Aug-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Just pay a few pennies more, the attack still works

[26-Aug-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Pools can only make it cost a tiny bit more

[26-Aug-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> 10 full blocks is enough to get the point across, but might piss some people off

[26-Aug-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> just saying, half that would be enough to get the point across

[26-Aug-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Or maybe Zcash company goes out of business and everybody uses Ycash next year

[26-Aug-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all hail our new Ycash overlords

[26-Aug-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> you'll have to pay more fess than what would have been in the block otherwise, no?

[26-Aug-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright half that number of blocks full, or 10 blocks half-full ?

[26-Aug-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> 5 full blocks

[26-Aug-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 5 full blocks, he says

[26-Aug-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ZEC mainnet has never seen 5 full consecutive blocks

[26-Aug-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Pretty sure it's never seen 1 full block

[26-Aug-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> altho I came close

[26-Aug-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> you have to pay more fees than the miner would receive otherwise I believe

[26-Aug-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> so I doubt 0.0001 will work

[26-Aug-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> correct

[26-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is what I have been saying, paying double fee gets you in the door

[26-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the bouncer don't give a fuck

[26-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> if the miner has 3 txes, your huge one with 0.0001 and two normal ones with 0.0001 each

[26-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just grease his hand

[26-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> it will choose the two

[26-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> ok, so 3 with 0.0001

[26-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it sorts by feesize, not by xtn size

[26-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> it will choose the 3

[26-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> well, we don't know the exact patches they run

[26-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but we can assume they are very similar to what is in KMD

[26-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> that's without a patch

[26-Aug-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And now I say, the attacker don't care, she will spend 0.0003 for every xtn, to say "fuck you" to every other xtn on the network

[26-Aug-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that makes it cost $9/day

[26-Aug-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> that assumes there are only 3 normal txes in the mempool

[26-Aug-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright most zec blocks are just coinbase

[26-Aug-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> believe you would need to look at average fee a miner collects per block and go above that

[26-Aug-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright i could estimate that for the last X blocks probably

[26-Aug-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright here is the thing, too, I guess I will explain

[26-Aug-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am giving this potential attacker so many hints!!!!

[26-Aug-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
