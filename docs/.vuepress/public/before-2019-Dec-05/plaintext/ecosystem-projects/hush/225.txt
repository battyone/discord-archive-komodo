[17-Sep-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it can vary, 5 minutes sometimes, 20 minutes others

[17-Sep-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> definition is not reality üòõ

[17-Sep-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But the definition of Bitcoin Protocol is "10 minutes on average"

[17-Sep-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is why difficulty changes every 2 weeks

[17-Sep-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> due to network problems or sth, but I've seen some article showing avg 20 for BTC

[17-Sep-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for tiny time intervals

[17-Sep-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> under 2 weeks

[17-Sep-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> every 2 weeks, the diff adjusts, to make blocks 10 minutes, on average

[17-Sep-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> on the course of hours or days, yes, there is a lot of variation

[17-Sep-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> on the course of months, no

[17-Sep-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Its 10 minutes average,
But sometimes hush takes 15mins and komodo 10 seconds and btc 20 seconds

[17-Sep-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are talking about statistics

[17-Sep-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> with words that have very very specific meaning

[17-Sep-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so dPOW average was 20minutes. Not BTC average. üôÇ

[17-Sep-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it takes 2 blocks to be confirmed

[17-Sep-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 2 * 10 = 20

[17-Sep-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> so the 13.5 is not real worst case - it's expected theoretically

[17-Sep-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> to blocks to be NOTARIZED, i meant

[17-Sep-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> actually on avg you will make your tx in the middle

[17-Sep-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> so it should be like 7min ?

[17-Sep-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã yes, i did that calculation above üôÇ

[17-Sep-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Hush for sale on atomicdex

[17-Sep-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> average time to Hush notarization is 6.75 or let's just say 7 mins

[17-Sep-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is, for the data to flow from Hush => BTC

[17-Sep-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> worse case is 13.5 minutes, assuming normal block times

[17-Sep-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> worst case 1h if btc got problems üòõ

[17-Sep-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's not WORST WORST case

[17-Sep-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we cannot say a worst case of how long a BTC block could take. It might be 45 minutes

[17-Sep-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so understand that, too

[17-Sep-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I was wrong, Norminal Case is 13.5 minutes lol

[17-Sep-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are talking about "worst case with average blocktime"

[17-Sep-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> best case can be 1ms

[17-Sep-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> worst meaning being unlucky, and making an xtn 1 millisecond after a block is mined

[17-Sep-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> most importantly if user can see all the stages - tx valid on Hush chain, tx valid on KMD chain -> tx valid on BTC

[17-Sep-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM yeah, basically

[17-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> My order is there

[17-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Sep-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> Yeah, so it seems... üòÑ

[17-Sep-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's good to talk about it in here, tell people you are interested in HUSH/DGB swaps

[17-Sep-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> even announce it on twitter. Tell people how to swap with you

[17-Sep-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> is DGB enabled in atomicdex right now?

[17-Sep-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> AtomicDEX is a social experiment, too

[17-Sep-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> Yeah, I already spoke about in on the Komodo Telegram, but I thought people here might want to swap too. üôÇ

[17-Sep-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So easy, you can just show people how to use it and swap with you.

[17-Sep-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> go into rando telegram groups that are into DGB and tell them üôÇ

[17-Sep-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> Yeah, DGB was one of the first ones in AtomicDEX, I think.

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> it was the same for me, but when i went back and looked at "history" it was successful, i guess there are still some bugs. i did first check the explorer to see the transaction was confirmed.
