[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm gonna fork SilentDragon

[16-Aug-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SD is a newer codebase

[16-Aug-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and I know of 2 other coins forking SD and using is as upstream so far

[16-Aug-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So that is a nice thing, other people recognize SD is good code and are using it. We are their upstream

[16-Aug-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Hmm interesting

[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> a large buyer got impatient

[16-Aug-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They must obliterate the orderbook

[16-Aug-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you are a miner, now is a good time to fill the orderbook with high sell orders üôÇ

[16-Aug-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> hahaha @AkiraX baby steps!

[16-Aug-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The whale bought enough and had it stop when it pushed price up by ~2X. They want more.

[16-Aug-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> by the way- how about scalability in HUSH messaging? when it is used for messaging, this will involve potentially huge volumes of data, and blockchains are commonly sort of.. bottlenecked there-
any special solutions? with all the anti- free speech terror going on in Twatter etc, this is an interesting application, but for mass adoption needs scalability,
unless it is only supposed to be used by the Snowdens and Assanges of this world - 
for the reallyreally life threatening leaks and stuff .. and deadman switches and gimmicks ‚è∏

[16-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> airdrop in tipbot general channel

[16-Aug-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Duke is more equiped to answer this question than i am @LocoMB

[16-Aug-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> sure, I am around - mostly in KMD discord .. I have a few HUSH form the eraly days, but as it looks, the orderbook is really thin, so buying any would not be fun

[16-Aug-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @LocoMB Hush subscribes to the KMD philosphy of scaling: just make more chains

[16-Aug-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we can make a special Hush sidechain just for large files, if we want

[16-Aug-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> scalability is a good problem

[16-Aug-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> aha - sort of like when the freaks spun up multiple chains and made a few ten thousand TXs per sec ?!?

[16-Aug-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I was shilling hush stating easy 2x from here.....and then....it happened

[16-Aug-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Lol

[16-Aug-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> weellll--- graviex is not really a very liquid place

[16-Aug-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @LocoMB HUSH mainnet will specialize in files <=200KB for the short term, and so I don't have too many worries. If we allowed 4MB files on mainnet, that might not be a good idea and maybe that is better for a sidechain, that integrates with Hush, via cryptoconditions/etc

[16-Aug-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Graviex is still a pretty new exchange, growing fast. They have good tech people there, better than most exchanges

[16-Aug-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> twitter has 140 chars, that should be ok for communication

[16-Aug-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> also, with 200 kb, probably state sponsored attackers of HUSH would spam the blockchain with really ugly content

[16-Aug-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You can embed 1MB into a transaction on ZEC mainnet right now, I have done it

[16-Aug-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's all possible already, but making it user-friendly and usable via GUI wallet, is what is left to be done

[16-Aug-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> A state sponsored attacker can jam 1MB xtns into zec with any propaganda they want. Additionally, the propaganda will be encrypted, but they could provide instructions to decrypt their spam attack, for additional psyops

[16-Aug-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> well, such kind of psyop would require a certain leverage to be obtainable with it, si maybe it won't even arise ever, who knows

[16-Aug-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> I ran Bitmeassge briefly several years ago, it was a fun proof of principle, but the damn thing just made the machine go into meltdown by doing stuff full throttle all the time

[16-Aug-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think it's likely some government is already running their own internal zcash protocol chains, studying them, probably even using them "in the field". They could be running on VPNs and we would never know they exist, even tho people all over the world might be using them.

[16-Aug-19 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> > twitter has 140 chars, that should be ok for communication

[16-Aug-19 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> 280?

[16-Aug-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> 200k is alot of characters

[16-Aug-19 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Twitter started at 140 and I remember when people thought the world would end when it went to 280. Zooko was actually one of the first cryptocoin people to get "supersized" twitter, lulz

TLDR: We will be provably burning (via OP_RETURN) 160,000 $HUSH which is 0.76% of total supply (160K of 21M). These funds were originally stolen by a Cryptopia 51% attacker before #DPoW was deployed to our v2 mainnet.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We are going to get some kind of "pre-order list" going, where you don't need to promise in blood, but maybe give us a Discord username + email, and say that you want to be first in line to buy these things. When we go to production, it will be first-come-first-serve, by the pre-order list. Also, we can judge how many molds/machines to buy based on pre-order numbers. @Berg @RunningMantheCoin is this something you can work on?

[17-Aug-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, there will be some kind of contest where some lucky :hush_puppy: wins one of these for FREE. Please suggest some ideas if you have them. Normal price will most likely be ~$200 + shipping, but could depend on USD collapsing and trade warz üòâ

[17-Aug-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
