[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh wheels are turning, i have one wallet syncing and another on a laptop that needs a bit more charge. The coins will flow, eventually

[25-Jul-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> straight to 50 cents

[25-Jul-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush has done the "moon and back already", we are looking for stable growth. 50 cents would be nice

[25-Jul-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush ATH is $17.89 or so, or 160K sat

[25-Jul-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> nothing in crypto is stable,

[25-Jul-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> a buck in 66 days

[25-Jul-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also, increasing volume and liquidity is just as important to me

[25-Jul-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Being worth $20 but having thin orderbooks and no volume or liquidity is pretty worthless

[25-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> you, the dev, cant hype price

[25-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i will 😉

[25-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> this is sooooooooo undervalued

[25-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Yep, I don't give price predictions 😃

[25-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> and it is

[25-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> People ask me for them, constantly

[25-Jul-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> send them to me 😉

[25-Jul-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The price of HUSH is dominated by miners selling for operating costs

[25-Jul-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and the occasional whale buying a large amount

[25-Jul-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The largest change to that will happen when HUSH block reward halves in 1.5 years

[25-Jul-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> we're about to hit 10,000  CT followers

[25-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most people have no idea any Zcash forks exist, outside of mayble ZCL or BTCP (shudder)

[25-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and the new YEC is on some peoples radar, i guess

[25-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> im gonna do a double release within 24 hrs

[25-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most people have never heard of KMD, HUSH, Pirate or the 15 other zec forks I can think of

[25-Jul-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> nothing lasts 4ever

[25-Jul-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Are the asic community or GPU community larger?

[25-Jul-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> More people own GPUs, in general

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There exist many thousands more GPUs in the world, than ASICs. But those ASICs are much more expensive

[25-Jul-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jul-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `There exist many thousands more GPUs in the world, than ASICs.`
that's kind of a skewed statement; I have 30 GPUs that don't have the RAM to carry equihash (or at leaset many of the popular K&N values)

[25-Jul-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - MineHush.com yeah, well the question was a bit ambiguous too 😃

[25-Jul-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> gotta say, radix cares bout Hush still

[25-Jul-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> cheap, but nobody wants to sell them @ComputerGenie - MineHush.com

[25-Jul-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jul-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> I'll sell you 6 of them for $4k each  :troll:

[25-Jul-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> here;s another teaser:

[25-Jul-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ```Any file up to 200KB can be uploaded to Hush, and while this size limit puts some constraints on what a user can upload, a 200KB text file contains a lot of words. 200KB is equivalent to 200,000 characters or roughly 66.6 pages of a paperback.```

[25-Jul-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - MineHush.com i will give you 4000 HUSH each

[25-Jul-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jul-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> some days I feel like by the time I sell at $2, inflation will have the buy power of that $2 under 2 cents

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> this whole market silliness of 'if it ain't BTC, it ain't shit' irks me

[25-Jul-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> quality and utility seem to have negative value in the market 🤷🏽

[25-Jul-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> cryptocoin prices don't make much sense. One cannot use logic

[25-Jul-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which is why jl777 and I prefer to talk about the code and tech, where logic can be used

[25-Jul-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> true
ETH aside it seems to be that the market value and utility are usually inverse

[25-Jul-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
