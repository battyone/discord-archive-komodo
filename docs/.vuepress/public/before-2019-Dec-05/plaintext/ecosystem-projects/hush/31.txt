[31-Dec-18 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> yeah ok

[31-Dec-18 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> npm run dev loads with f12 now

[31-Dec-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> and icons are there in linux

[31-Dec-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> going to retry in windows

[31-Dec-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <rjanetzek> hmm then its a thing with the prod build

[31-Dec-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763

[31-Dec-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <rjanetzek> hmm i think this is a standard  webpack setup

[31-Dec-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <rjanetzek> it could be that the src property is set the wrong way

[31-Dec-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> yeah,. just trying to help where i can

[31-Dec-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <rjanetzek> and webpack cant rewrite that

[31-Dec-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> im by no means an expert

[31-Dec-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> ok

[31-Dec-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> ok

[31-Dec-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> definitely looks better

[31-Dec-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <rjanetzek> but i dont work at the project anymore

[31-Dec-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763

[31-Dec-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> icons there

[31-Dec-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> so it was defintely the fact i did npm audit fix

[31-Dec-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> but it doesnt load hushd

[31-Dec-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> im going to try to run npm run build now

[31-Dec-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> maybe just the fact i did npm audit fix

[31-Dec-18 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <rjanetzek> i think the icons will be broken again

[31-Dec-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> yes

[31-Dec-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> its true

[31-Dec-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> broken

[31-Dec-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <rjanetzek> its something with the patch

[31-Dec-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <rjanetzek> path to the images

[31-Dec-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <rjanetzek> static is a special folder

[31-Dec-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <rjanetzek> but i would need to reed the docs for that

[31-Dec-18 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @rjanetzek Hello, it's nice to see you here again.

[31-Dec-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I corrected the problems of icons including those in duplicate. I have the impression that you tried to compile the 'master' version while the most advanced verison is on the 'dev' branch.

[31-Dec-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Which does not mean that the icons will appear when you compile the application.

[31-Dec-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> From memory, the script to launch 'hushd.exe' is correct but the file 'hushd.exe' is not present.

[31-Dec-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> yes

[31-Dec-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> thats also true

[31-Dec-18 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> compiling the dev branch now ðŸ˜ƒ

[31-Dec-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> its been quite the learning experience

[31-Dec-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> ok

[31-Dec-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> compiled the dev build

[31-Dec-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> npm run build

[31-Dec-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> also missing icons

[31-Dec-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> npm run dev works

[31-Dec-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> dev branch has updated settings icon

[31-Dec-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX nice work, i see you have made lots of progress

[31-Dec-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `dev` branch has all the latest stuff

[31-Dec-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and you will need to start hushd by yourself, that code does not work in hush-ng, or I have never used it if it does

[31-Dec-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the auto-starting code *might* work, if the paths of binaries are correct, but the autodownloading of hushd definitely will not work

[31-Dec-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX as a hack, you could symlink where it's looking for hushd.exe to the actual binary, that could work, and it might auto-start hushd.exe

[31-Dec-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> happy new year

[31-Dec-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> i took the day off work

[31-Dec-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
