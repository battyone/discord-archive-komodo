[dscrd-hush] <gdo369> When hush price 1$

[19-Jan-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> When you buy it for $1.00 😛

[19-Jan-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am around, but real life and adding DPoW to 3 coins currently: SUQA, KREDS, GIN, is keeping me busy

[19-Jan-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have been making improvements to "DPoW confs" and that is going to improve KMD and all dpow coins, including HUSH

[19-Jan-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Suqa is interesting coin, very good if they implementing Dpow

[19-Jan-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Paid?

[19-Jan-19 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Feesh> is it better now to mine hush now before any changes happen this year

[20-Jan-19 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> It is totally up to you, but lets say if i had asics capable of mining hush, i would do it.

[20-Jan-19 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Feesh> i believe this coin will become successful. i believe in this team. If team continues to find support, and strive for success for it

[20-Jan-19 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I think Hush is an unique concept, especially when it gets more developed. With Hush-NG, and later Sapling but that requires a lot of dev work. After sapling hush could have a truly private messenger app for mobile.

[20-Jan-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> But that's a long way into the future

[20-Jan-19 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <aledel> Some cheap Hush 🤔

[20-Jan-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Mine when difficulty is low, sell when prices are high, is a good philosophy. And this is not financial advice 😈

[20-Jan-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Looks like someone bought a good chunk of Hush on tradesatoshi, price was at 1600 satoshi at one point

[20-Jan-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> And when is diff low  @dukeleto ?

[20-Jan-19 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Hush mining difficulty has been low for some time now

[21-Jan-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This shows the Hush hashrate for the last 12 hrs, I don't think we have any good long term visualizations, which we really could use: https://luckpool.org/miners?coin=hush

[21-Jan-19 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> looks like this insight is updated from upstream and has much better charts/stats than what the current hush explorer has

[21-Jan-19 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> https://explorer.hush.zelcore.io/stats/nethash/all highest hashrate ever correlates to highest hush price ever

[21-Jan-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which means profit-switching miners mining at the exact worst time

[21-Jan-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Roxin so our current hashrate is 23% of our all-time high

[21-Jan-19 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Ooh, that's a nice chart 📊

[21-Jan-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @dukeleto understand, thanks 😀

[21-Jan-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> On coinmarketcap at market section there show some coins trades (last 24 hours) but how if cryptopia is down ?

[21-Jan-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> I dont understand...🤔

[21-Jan-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mountainxman> Hi I try to enter my hush web wallet with secret phrase but it says error connecting to the insight API, double check the Insight API supplied in settings. What I have to do ?

[21-Jan-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> @Mountainxman that sounds like cause the hush explorer is down. Meanwhile can "try" change the insight to the temp explorer link

[21-Jan-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> there is an interesting exchange - BitBay. Why interesting: 1. it is Malta based 2. prove to be reliable - chalanged by gov in legal terms and survived 3. not anonymous, official 4. team about 50 people 5. price should be lower then most cex'es 6. got fiat gateways

[22-Jan-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> currently there are 3 projects actively seachring cex: Arrr, Hush, VRSC

[22-Jan-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> if few more come up and team up maybe a discount could be made too, idk eventually the price should be around 1 BTC I think

[22-Jan-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @Roxin, those trade figures are coming from Tradesatoshi.

[22-Jan-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763

[22-Jan-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> @Andreas well but they didnt say "funds are safe"..like when binance got issues 😀

[22-Jan-19 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Hey all, just a heads up that I'll be extremely limited in my role over the next 3 weeks. If anyone comes up with anything marketing related / tweet drafting / whatever, feel free to post it in #marketing or message me directly, I'll try to at least get on here to check in here and there and make posts as necessary, but I've 3 weeks to finish an extremely intricate $300MM budget 😉 Needless to say I'm working 7AM-10PM 7 days a week

[23-Jan-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Best of luck @Berg   Thanks for the heads up

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @dukeleto any detailed timeframe for BTCH PoS? Q1? Q2? Q3?

[25-Jan-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no

[25-Jan-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> ?

[25-Jan-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> There’s no timeframe.  It’s a passion project

[25-Jan-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Unfortunately

[25-Jan-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush+BTCH are volunteer-run projects. Currently, we have very few volunteers doing things. Asking volunteers for timeframes, constantly, is not useful. Instead, ask "How can I help with X?". And then do something

[25-Jan-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am focusing on Hush things in the near future, so I have no timeframe for BTCH PoS stuff. If people want it to happen sooner, get more involved, and help make it happen

[25-Jan-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> In general, I don't like to give timelines because estimating time to do complex things is very hard. And even then, I only give timelines to people that pay me. Stop asking volunteers for timelines, this isn't an employee-boss relationship. This is a volunteer-run open source project

[25-Jan-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @halo kitty rules there is a mountain of complex coding to do on Hush before BTCH even enters the conversation

[25-Jan-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> That’s right.  Step it up community.

[25-Jan-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> So how do we bring people to the community to contribute.

[25-Jan-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> That’s the unfortunate case

[25-Jan-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Is there a task list or something public?

[25-Jan-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Some update on Cryptopia, maybe they'll make a comeback.

[25-Jan-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> I have a rig with 6x 1070 titan , i want to know if this kind of source is good for risers to give electricity to gpus

[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> segotep gp series 800w 80 plus gold

[25-Jan-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jan-19 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> And of course for motherboard..

[25-Jan-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Devilinbox> hi guys! is someone else working on the project or is he dying?

[25-Jan-19 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> @Roxin 800W won't be enough for that.

[25-Jan-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @Andreas i have also a 1200 w server source

[25-Jan-19 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> With 1200 w source i give electricity to the gpus ..with this one i want to put to risers of the gpus and to motherboard...before i had one njoy 750w but that burned...

[25-Jan-19 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> 6x150W for the GPUs, +Motherboard 20W, RAM 5W/stick, CPU 65W or 95W, SSD 10W
And the PSU power is 800W from the wall, which means it's 800*0.9 towards the PC (90% Gold efficiency)
And you better leave a 20% extra power so the PC won't reboot when suddenly all the 6 GPUs start to load the PSU and they suddenly give an extra transient load.

[25-Jan-19 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> I used a 850W and a 750W together for 7x1070s and that worked well for more than a year. And the overall power draw from the socket was 1200W for the whole thing.
You can hook up two PSUs with a small circuit called: add2psu

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am working on this code in KMD repo, but it will flow down into Hush and all other dpow coins once it's done. I am working on various Hush things, as I always have

[26-Jan-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Unfortunately, the launch date of POS BTCH is unknown. I would help, but I'm not a coder. Wouldn't the POS team earn a profit, since the team has a lot of coins for this? Thus, the team would earn money)

[26-Jan-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that requires doing work, to be hoped to be paid in future, maybe minimum wage. and selling a lot of BTCH would probably crash price. Which is why things that pay now get prioritized above that situation
