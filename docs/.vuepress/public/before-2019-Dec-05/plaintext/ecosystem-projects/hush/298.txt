[26-Nov-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Do we have any businessowners here, in our community?

[26-Nov-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Nov-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We are looking to incentivize businesses to use Hush.

[26-Nov-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That is fine. You can still contribute.

[26-Nov-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> For example, I asked Mullvad VPN

[26-Nov-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Since you accept BTC, could you accept Hush

[26-Nov-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They politely said no.

[26-Nov-19 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But it only took 5 minutes.

[26-Nov-19 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> If they said yes, then think about how much one additional use case would contribute.

[26-Nov-19 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Maybe just $25 a month. But it adds up.

[26-Nov-19 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It's about exposure, too
