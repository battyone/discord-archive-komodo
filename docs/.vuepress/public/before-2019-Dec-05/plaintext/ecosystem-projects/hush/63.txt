[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> csw swears only miners are nodes ü§∑üèΩ

[16-Apr-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Papa D> We are good to wait for GUI to claim air drop?

[16-Apr-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Papa D yes

[16-Apr-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> airdrop will process soon, and then we will give lots of instructions for using GUI wallets as they come out

[16-Apr-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Papa D> üëç

[16-Apr-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Both are needed for most users. If I airdrop but there are no GUI wallets, most users will still not be able to see their funds

[16-Apr-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So it's a lot of work all at once and we are doing the best we can

[16-Apr-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> miners can still mine right now

[16-Apr-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You can mine to a  KMD address you already own, and import that to HUSH later, as one option

[16-Apr-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there are other options, but that is easiest, if you want to mine HUSH3 but dont' have a gui wallet to make an address

[16-Apr-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You own any R... address on KMD, HUSH and all asset chains, same exact address

[16-Apr-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you just need to import it to other chains, to see what funds you have on that chain.

[16-Apr-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we will be giving docs/instructions on all of this, i know it's a lot

[16-Apr-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Papa D> Thank you for the information. I will be out for a week at least so I will check when I get back.

[16-Apr-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> everything will be drastically more user-friendly in 7 days, I can promise that

[16-Apr-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This time of transition, it's like moving a house with a bunch of trucks, to a new location

[16-Apr-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have moved the house to the new location already, but we still need to make sure our foundation is secure and hook up all the utilities

[16-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I could stare at that block explorer all day

[16-Apr-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> thankfully my profession requires that

[16-Apr-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am in the middle of testing the airdrop script on a testnet, a few small issues were found and fixed along the way, so this just makes running the mainnet airdrop script that much less stressful

[16-Apr-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have to mine at least 100 blocks on this testchain so the funds in block 1 are mature, and can be spent in the airdrop

[16-Apr-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoRot> Keep up the good work @dukeleto

[16-Apr-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I disputed komodo move since day one üòã , but its already done. 
I think with 10% dev funds and kmd the project main goals will grow faster. 
So far everything seems to work well. Well done

[16-Apr-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> is there a new WP?

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then I can put  all the official numbers in there

[16-Apr-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> airdrop is happening soon people, I just tested it out on a testnet, made some tweaks/improvements, and now it's getting tested yet again, because we don't want surprises on mainnet

[16-Apr-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jcrew> have any exchanges upgraded to v3 yet??

[16-Apr-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> not until the airdrop

[16-Apr-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> and since when is it the coins job to run around looking for pools rather than pool "ops" being active in the community they mine in?

[16-Apr-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto Congratulations on your success, the next BTCH lineup for the introduction of POS / POW?

[16-Apr-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @JWolf (WW Clan leader) don't mind me, I'm the cynical type that mostly believes that one of the worst things to happen to crypto is that any dingus can clone a git and "operate" a pool

[16-Apr-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> Sure they can but two of these pools held 90% of our hashrate

[16-Apr-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> and zhash is still over 600ksols

[dscrd-hush] <dcn> Hi. I dont get understand, yet. How to move hush from old "chain" to this new chain ?

[16-Apr-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> you dont have too

[16-Apr-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> its ok

[16-Apr-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `Sure they can but two of these pools held 90% of our hashrate`
all the more reason they should be active in the community
If I knew about it 2 months ago, how didn't they?

[16-Apr-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dcn> @JWolf (WW Clan leader) are you reffering to me ?

Your t address will become an R address on the new chain and your t balance will be airdropped into your R address
there's nothing for you to do but wait
