[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Yes.  Free overtime

[03-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sorry for your loss of life force

[03-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Lol

[03-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But if it's your choice, whatevs

[03-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Stop asking "Will people X help us?" starting saying "What can I learn to make thing X I want to happen actually happen?"

[03-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> It's called creating value for yourself

[03-Aug-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Doing free work is the opposite of that

[03-Aug-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> I agree asking is stretch, but recommending to check it out maybe not so much a stretch

[03-Aug-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> doing Hush for Tail make sense

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh the PoC would only be usable by a few developers, and they could point it at any coin they wanted. And even the coins that have "fixed" it, it costs less to attack them in fiat (not native coin) because of fiat prices of coins

[03-Aug-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> take a minute to think of the implications of that

[03-Aug-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Woodchipper don't care if you "fixed" it. You just made it cost a tiny bit more, that is all.

[03-Aug-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Woodchipper don't care.

[03-Aug-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> well, its your call

[03-Aug-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Part of Zcash doing nothing is maybe realizing that all they can do is maybe make it cost 10-20X more, and that would cost them potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in operational costs, to update the network. So maybe it raises the attack cost to $100/day to bring any Zcash protocol coin down. And what do they do then?

[03-Aug-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> theres enuff info in the CVE for someone to work out an attack anyway

[03-Aug-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Just ignore the problem, spend the money, and keep paying Zooko's groceries, I guess

[03-Aug-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh all the people that can easily attack ZEC are on the payroll

[03-Aug-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They don't want to destroy their paycheck

[03-Aug-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Nor say a single thing, because the bossman controls their destiny

[03-Aug-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> so the only mitigation against woodchipper is to effectively increase the cost of attack from $4/day to $100/day?

[03-Aug-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> so all Zcash forks r still screwed

[03-Aug-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ?

[03-Aug-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> now you get it

[03-Aug-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The only solution is variable transaction fees, which Zcash is DEAD AGAINST

[03-Aug-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So I guess they would rather be trivially attackable

[03-Aug-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is migrating towards variable fees, just like BTC

[03-Aug-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Why does anybody think BTC has variable fees? For funzies?

[03-Aug-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> For this exact fucking attack

[03-Aug-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> how we gonna fix this in HUSH? variable fees?

[03-Aug-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i thought that was already implemented

[03-Aug-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> HushList protocol messages will NOT have variable fees, or will they?

[03-Aug-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> cant b good for the anon

[03-Aug-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh what question are you trying to ask?

[03-Aug-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I feel like it's trying to come out

[03-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and it's probably a good question

[03-Aug-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> HushList protocol relies on a fixed default tx fee (0.0001) and a 0 value tx when sending messages to help protect a user's anonymity. Introducing a variable tx fee will therefor have a negative impact on the anonymizing power of the protocol.

[03-Aug-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto is this statement correct?

[03-Aug-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> the shorter form for the question is *Are we screwed*?

[03-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> lulz

[03-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh HushList does not rely on a fixed default fee

[03-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HushList protocol is independent of amount or fee. You can use any values you want

[03-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Miners decide which transaction fees to accept, nobody else

[03-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Developers can only make the code possibly accept or deny some values that are too large or small, but ultimately, only the miners decide. And by that, I mean the largest mining pools, who usually have most of the deciding power

[03-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Pooled miners decide nothing

[03-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Only solo miners and pools decide

[03-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `Introducing a variable tx fee will therefor have a negative impact on the anonymizing power of the protocol.`

[03-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh who told you that? Zcash company?

[03-Aug-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If the entire network is using 0.0001 as a fee, and you, gigamesh start using 0.00001337 as a fee, that is really bad. REALLY REALLY BAD

[03-Aug-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It makes it obvious, "those are gigameshes transactions, with his elite fee"

[03-Aug-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Fees are always public, even in zaddr xtns.

[03-Aug-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But if the whole network is using variable fees, then nobody stands out

[03-Aug-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's only when you go against the stream, and make yourself stand out with completely unique fees, is when it's bad

[03-Aug-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you want to pay a custom fee to make your fee go faster, Hush already supports that. It's just that our blocks are not full, and Hush mining pools haven't started to care about fee=0 xtns, yet

[03-Aug-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ZEC pools very much care, and will ignore you. And if your xtn is too big, they will even ignore your normal fee!

[03-Aug-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash tells wallets to not allow people to control their fee, which is asinine. They want everybody to pay the same fee and that makes the woodchipper attack the worst. Nobody can pay extra fees to make their xtns go, if all the GUIs disallow it

[03-Aug-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I might have opinions about this topic

[03-Aug-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> bbiab, I will let y'all digest all that üòÉ

[03-Aug-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> on reflection (havent had a coffee yet today) I am confusing a variable fee with a custom fee

[03-Aug-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> custom fees ARE bad for anon right?

[03-Aug-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> those terms pretty much mean the same thing, but not exactly

[03-Aug-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> only if the custom fee you choose is a unique number, is it actually "bad"

[03-Aug-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> like, if you choose 0.000015423534 as fee, that is really bad

[03-Aug-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> choose 0.0002 instead

[03-Aug-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> > only if the custom fee you choose is a unique number

[03-Aug-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most people just try to pay double fee, it's a common number on the blockchain

[03-Aug-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Unique numbers are not your friend, on the blockchain!!!

[03-Aug-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> is that not the definition of custom fee?

[03-Aug-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Changing the default fee from 0.0001 to ANYTHING else, means you are using a custom fee

[03-Aug-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> custom = (probably) unique to user

[03-Aug-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You can use a custom fee of 0.0002, but that is a very common number on the blockchain. Using 0.000134555 would be a unique-ish number, and be very bad. Don't use special fancy fees, use common multiples of the default fee

[03-Aug-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "variable fees" means the way BTC does it, they charge you per byte of the transaction

[03-Aug-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> exactly

[03-Aug-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am not sure we need that complexity, we can just have a simple way in the GUI to pay a double/triple fee to "speed up" your transaction, if needed

[03-Aug-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you want to upload 200KB and only pay 0.0001 HUSH, it might take a long time for pools to add it to a block

[03-Aug-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But if you pay 0.0002 HUSH, maybe they add it the next block. Only mining pools decide

[03-Aug-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and solo miners

[03-Aug-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> pooled miners are just along for the ride

[03-Aug-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gotta go, will catch up later

[03-Aug-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> miners determine "variable fees", users determine "custom fees". the former impacts all users in the same way, the latter not

[03-Aug-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Miners decide which transaction fees to accept in a block

[03-Aug-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> well if the wallet intelligently varies tx fees based on network conditions thats ok. if a user starts fiddling with custom fees, thats bad

[03-Aug-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto fair?

[03-Aug-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <antropov083> @dukeleto why is the price of a coin so small? üò¶

[03-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Aug-19 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh a user needs to be able to decide "I want this to confirm as fast as possible" versus "I am ok with this taking a few hours" and the only way to do that is allow the user to choose a fee

[03-Aug-19 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also, under attack conditions, good users can always choose to pay more than the attacker, to have their transactions confirm faster. If you don't allow users that ability, the attacker wins by clogging up the pipes, and then normal users are unable to pay more fee to get more priority than the attacker xtns
