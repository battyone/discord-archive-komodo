[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 honestly, i don't understand your question: `would you want to separate, for example, blocks 1-100,000 that are being focused on for metadata leakage, from blocks 100,001-whatever?`

[16-Oct-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's too ambiguous and so i cannot give any answer

[16-Oct-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Sorry.  I'm asking because I don't understand

[16-Oct-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Hello

[16-Oct-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `Could your merge fork into a veil of privacy?` just doesnt' make much sense @AkiraX

[16-Oct-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> try using different words. merge forking creates more metadata and makes the problem worse, by the way

New proposed Lightning Network (LN) fees are great for node operator revenue streams, but is this what users want?

Fee increases to move USD:
üí∏10X to move $1
üí∏50X to move $10
üí∏250X to move $100
üí∏455X to move $1000

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> who loves fee increases from 10X-455X more fees!!! üòÖ

[16-Oct-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> @dukeleto I think my above block separation concept, is too advanced to understand,  at the moment. --Lahey ü§£

[16-Oct-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Lightning Network is a joke

[16-Oct-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Its centralized and it decreases privacy

[16-Oct-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> @dukeleto these are the default fees. We can change it. When you are the only liquidity provider for a LN node, you can increase fees. When there are many liquidity providers, fees market apply and each node will lower its fee to route the payment. We can go below minimum (devs exchanged 1 sat many times with 0 fee offchain).
About centralization and decrease of privacy, I d be happy to read a paper on it. Last time I discussed LN with kmd guys, they were not aware of all developments since years and they pretended to have read the code. I was able to discuss LN with jl777: all concerns about LN are known by LN community, documented and some PhD thesis are written. In all LN docs that I read, they explains that it is not designed for big amounts.
I think that some cooperation might be possible in order to support crypto space.
About privacy, they are building onion routing and such things (nearly 0 privacy feature are released), cooperation can help every crypto.

[16-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> In my opinion the Lightning Network, regardless of what it can offer in the future, has lost traction with the crypto community as a whole.

[16-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> For me, if I need to send small amounts of btc and want to avoid the fees, I send LTC KMD EOS NANO TRX DOGE

[16-Oct-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> The last five I listed cost less than one tenth, of one cent, to transfer any amount.

[16-Oct-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> About the tweet of duke, I ve just asked a LND dev, he sais that was an idea out of air, nobody talked about it. He does not think it will be applied (and it is default values)

[16-Oct-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Why is LN important, in your opinion?

[16-Oct-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> At the kmd meetup, we paid beers with LN, not with kmd

[16-Oct-19 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> LN is for scaling (liquid also but I don t like liquid) and microtx

[16-Oct-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> So you like to use btc for smaller purchases?

[16-Oct-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> With LN yes. Above 100$ worth, btc onchain

[16-Oct-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Whatever theoretical attacks are possible, cost is so huge that they never happened on mainet as far as I know

[16-Oct-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Look at the routing fees

[16-Oct-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> The only thing I worry about with Bitcoin, is its price. With each halving, either security decreases or price increases.

[16-Oct-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Lol the PHM test

[16-Oct-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Fees are in satoshis to transfert amount in sat so price does not matter here. I agree about price because it is more and more expensive to buy btc

[16-Oct-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @phm87 it is being proposed by one of the main LN developers, Rusty

[16-Oct-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so to say it's just some random proposal, that doesn't seem fair

[16-Oct-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @phm87 i think Rusty controls the `lnd` source code, iirc

[16-Oct-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am not saying it's good or bad. I am simply bringing attention

[16-Oct-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and I did use the word "proposed" üôÇ

[16-Oct-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @phm87 you really think LN payments should be based on the amount of the payment, and not on the size of the xtn, like in Bitcoin?

[16-Oct-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> What if it cost more to move 10000 BTC vs 1 BTC? That is what LN is proposing

[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> @Berg Good Afternoon

[16-Oct-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> @dukeleto  yes it is a proposal, there are other ones. Aim is to change default fee. The LN bashing is not necessary: We can set fee below default values
I don t understand what you said about fee onchain vs offchain. On LN, it the only route to pay your invoice is too expensive, you can establish anew channel more direct, fee competition can begin (in a far future). I don t remember that guys want higher fees on LN compared to onchain. If you want to send a huge amount on LN, it is normal to create a direct channel to set low fees. But today, huge amounts are at risk on LN (it is known by everyone in the LN channels wherd I am)
LND is 1 of the 3 big implementations where there are 6 to 9 implementations (I played with c lightning and LND. Chips is based on an oldc lightning)

[dscrd-hush] <phm87> https://discordapp.com/channels/407861562108542986/407861562108542988/634095048643969027 one LND dev is proposing that default fees works like that. I found no support in lnd guys that I know. It will force ppl to avoid huge amounts (good for sevurity). It can be changed on each node as it is default fee

[16-Oct-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I agree that fee depending on thd amount is new and not tested yet. From my point of vies, we should avoid big payments on LN (risk and liquidity pb)

[16-Oct-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> See story of LN.big to see that centralized big players will exit quickly (liquidity pb)

[16-Oct-19 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Did you hear of ln.big ? It was very üçø to see an actor putting hundreds of btc at risk

[16-Oct-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Note: I own less than 0.1 btc and I own mostly kmd and random shitcoins. I run an altcoins pool and a kmd NN, nothing btc related. I defend math, I don t defend any bag

[16-Oct-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> @Berg good afternoon

[16-Oct-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Duke: as I read in the text, "¬†He notes that the current defaults don‚Äôt provide much room for allowing users to lower fees and the popularity of nodes currently charging higher fees indicates many users are currently not sensitive to fees.¬†"

[16-Oct-19 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> So the aim is to push ppl to reduce default fees to let fee market exists (possible future)

[16-Oct-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> In the before column and in the text, the default fee is already dependant of amount

[16-Oct-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> We can set it to 0 for all amounts

[16-Oct-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> ...

[16-Oct-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I heardabout pirate onboarding on chmex website, I was dreaming about trading btc on LN with kmd and hush. <https://zigzag.io/#/> maybe we can do the same on atomicdex

[16-Oct-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Jl777 said it is technically possible (to add LN into atomicdex) but he won t support it bc of security. For small amounts it is fine as math prooved (if cost of atk is above tx amount)

[16-Oct-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I finally figured out how to archive discord channels ü§î

[16-Oct-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> In my opinion, Komodo should work on getting more AtomicDex users, more than anything

[16-Oct-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Products without many users, do not usually end up being successful, regardless of how good they are.

[16-Oct-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I've been hearing to much about Uniswap lately,  and Unipig

[16-Oct-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> if a few percentage of bitcoin hodlers want to use atomicdex (maybe because we added LN into it), it will get a huge free marketing maybe

[16-Oct-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I love atomicswaps

[16-Oct-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> It's why I became a part of the Komodo Community, in 2017

[16-Oct-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> And it's so cheap to get listed, compared to a CEX

[16-Oct-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I wonder what if we compare listing prices of atomicdex with CEXes with similar volumes of atomicdex

[16-Oct-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Well the projects know this

[16-Oct-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> It's that only liquid exchanges are useful

[16-Oct-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Most use CEXs to trade and make profit

[16-Oct-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> AtomicDex isn't designed for this

[16-Oct-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> if atomicdex is added into pools with autotrading such as zpool, more coins will be sold but I have few clues how to attract buyers

[16-Oct-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Well, first you reach out to every single project on CMC, individually...on discord or on telegram

[16-Oct-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> And tell them what you have to offer

[16-Oct-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Then answer any questions

[16-Oct-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> And try to pitch them

[16-Oct-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Maybe make deals with some

[16-Oct-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> is it possible to make a swap between atomicdex and the 2 DEX projects you mentionned earlier ?

[16-Oct-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Well uniswap is for ETH

[16-Oct-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> It works great

[16-Oct-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Unipig is the new version

[16-Oct-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-Oct-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
