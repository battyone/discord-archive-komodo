[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi dang, is that  Bo Jackson? old skooool

[26-Nov-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Haha

[26-Nov-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I have installed the APK however it says no connection

[26-Nov-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Old school with it

[26-Nov-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Captain you must pair it to SDL or SD on your computer

[26-Nov-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> ah found it, have to conncet the app with SDL

[26-Nov-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> via QR code

[26-Nov-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we should probably have better docs for this üôÇ

[26-Nov-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> yeah I got it. thanks

[26-Nov-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's all so knew

[26-Nov-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we actually need a YouTube video showing how to pair the app to SD or SDL

[26-Nov-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> So if I shut down my pc, I cannot send a transaction

[26-Nov-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because google play lets you link to a YT

[26-Nov-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Captain correct

[26-Nov-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> your phone is just a remote control

[26-Nov-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> your desktop must stay on and online

[26-Nov-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> allright. But theoretically I can use a server to run SDL and pay HUSH from my phone wherever I am

[26-Nov-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> maybe?

[26-Nov-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> kinda? It's complex i guess

[26-Nov-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> haha

[26-Nov-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but i like the way you think üôÇ

[26-Nov-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the connection tries to stay alive, but we are debugging some issues with timeouts. plz report bugz üòâ

[26-Nov-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I will try, however I cannot code or anything. So if I see something unusual I will tell

[26-Nov-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you run SD or SDL on a computer at home that never turns off, or rarely, it will do what you want

[26-Nov-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Captain sure. not asking for coding. Asking for a user to give feedback

[26-Nov-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> feedback from coders is not as valuable

[26-Nov-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> our brains are broken by knowing the code

[26-Nov-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so any feedback is helpful. It's hard to know what it's like to be a "new user"

[26-Nov-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so that is why feedback from new people is so valuable

[26-Nov-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Well I am running SDL on android with 4G. it connected flawlessly

[26-Nov-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Captain you are running SDA on android, SDL runs on your desktop. which OS are you using there, and version?

[26-Nov-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> SDL on windows 10 and SDA on Android 9 (Galaxy S8)

[26-Nov-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> awesome, glad to hear it works

[26-Nov-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the amount of code to make things work is amazing

[26-Nov-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> would be perfect to have also kind of remote desktop turn on feature

[26-Nov-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> not sure it's easy/ doable

[26-Nov-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> semi solution could be schedule computer ON every 1h for 3 min just to check if your mobile app is waiting to make a tx, and if so = make the tx, if not turn off again

[26-Nov-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> however for miners this is good to just keep ruuning

[26-Nov-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nope

[26-Nov-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> android relies on the desktop app, not the other way around

[26-Nov-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> actually it's doable to wake up computer

If you use remote desktop, remote file access, or other server software, you may leave your computer on at home or work when you leave the house. This uses more power. Instead, you could remotely power on your PC whenever you need to use it.

[26-Nov-19 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> Im not a fan of windows but this is also cool option:

Alexa, Turn on My PC
Your Amazon Echo can do so much more than play music or set timers with the Alexa on Windows app. You can connect Alexa to computers to use it as a speaker, use Alexa for PC, and more.

[26-Nov-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> so if you have alexa + pc you could invoke the command remotely for example having also security cam with voice option at your home

[26-Nov-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> then you make security cam voice to ask alexa to run you PC üòÇ

[26-Nov-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> and then have wallet online

[26-Nov-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> I would prefer the combo of pi4/rock64 pro with sdl or SD on it

[26-Nov-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> So you have a not energy hungry device for sda

[26-Nov-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã please don't suggest giving all your data, voice included, to evil companies to automate a simple thing like that

[26-Nov-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> your suggestion is literally part of the problem

[26-Nov-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> I think I didnt suggest that, just thinking how one can turn on pc remotely

[26-Nov-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> having windows machine does gove away probably everything anyway

[26-Nov-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> linuxe best

[26-Nov-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> on windows I found sth like this powercfg DEVICEQUERY wake_from_S3_supported

[26-Nov-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> not sure how exactly these devices can wake up the machine

[26-Nov-19 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> but possibility to wake up computer remotely to make some tx seems cool

[26-Nov-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> I think to have security cam, so if the computer could react to voice and wake from light sleep would be good enough

[26-Nov-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> so much backlog here to read, i love it üòá

[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I dont remember taking it so long

[27-Nov-19 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And sorry, I should've done that in #tipbot_general

[27-Nov-19 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> did a transaction 13 minutes ago

[27-Nov-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> still no confirmation

[27-Nov-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Well the exchange probably required 8 confs

[27-Nov-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> ah got first confirmation now

[27-Nov-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Or whatever

[27-Nov-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I was actually wondering

[27-Nov-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> How can we get ledger support? Or that is not an option?

[27-Nov-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: It's a lot of work and I don't own a ledger, but KMD supports ledger and so we are compatible
