[dscrd-hush] <Berg> What are everyone's thoughts on bitcoin today?
Do you think we'll see some 8's?

[24-Sep-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> I think the hashrate drop spooked some btc maximalists.

[24-Sep-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Bitcoin 8?  But no alt pump

[24-Sep-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg 8500 is likely

[24-Sep-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> $8,750 area is my target if I buy anything at all

[24-Sep-19 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Kind of got a lot of other expenses piling up on my plate lately 😟

[24-Sep-19 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But I need to accumulate 😁

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Ugh

[25-Sep-19 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> Im thinking Hush is actually close to becoming a marketplace

[25-Sep-19 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> since publication of hushlist is more or less relevant to publication of market offers

[25-Sep-19 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> and also Hush allows payments

[25-Sep-19 06:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> and also meseging between vendors and users

[25-Sep-19 06:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> only 1 thing is missing - to be able to display opinions in some relevant way - not sure it's possible

[25-Sep-19 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> hardest thing to do might be avoiding scammers
