@dukeleto @murchandamus As I said I am not familiar with the details, but I don't see what prevents notaries from notarizing two different tips, both with valid txns and therefore valid trees, but with the txns sending coins to different addresses.

Dollar cost averaging
Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy with the goal of reducing the impact of volatility on large purchases of financial assets such as equities. Dollar cost averaging is also called the constant dollar plan (in the US), pound-cost averaging (in the UK), and, ...

[27-Oct-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> That'll definitely bring back people that quit crypto,  and attract new people

[27-Oct-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> Yeah. And I am spreading some hush love üòÅ. Letting people know hush exists

[27-Oct-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I didn't even realize that

[27-Oct-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Are you kidding me?

[27-Oct-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> Everything is coming together nicely

[27-Oct-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> SDA & SDLite

[27-Oct-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So you can pair your phone to the Lite wallet or full node wallet, and both support taddrs+zaddrs. Using your own full node has good privacy implications, but Lite option is there for people

[27-Oct-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SDL uses less bandwidth, not sure exactly how much

[27-Oct-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I showed the 3d Dragon in  @Woody The Flipping Woodpecker discord chat last night

[27-Oct-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but SDL uses tens of megabytes, where SD uses close to a gigabyte to sync

[27-Oct-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 the dragon head?

[27-Oct-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Oct-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763

We've been busy designing this awesome Dragon Head Node case for @dukeleto and the @MyHushTeam.  Test print turned out awesome, we will need to reduce the size üò≤ This thing is massive, but we now have a King Dragon in the shop.

[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> Oh no you mean yours lol

[27-Oct-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> I didn't make that one ü§£

[27-Oct-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Well there is a full Hush node (entire running Hush blockchain) with a power supply,  inside

[27-Oct-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 yes, i paid to buy the King Head, that is going to be my dragon head üôÇ

[27-Oct-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> It looks amazing

[27-Oct-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the power supply is actually outside, via a cord

[27-Oct-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Good to know

[27-Oct-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the "real" size print is all black

[27-Oct-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and he put airvents underneath

[27-Oct-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and modified the aspect ratio of the head a bit

[27-Oct-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> So when you're connected to the full node, you can send private transactions.

[27-Oct-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, via your android app

[27-Oct-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You can also do the same via the Lite version, but it's like using Electrum

[27-Oct-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there are some privacy implications

[27-Oct-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's easier, at the cost of some privacy

[27-Oct-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Well we aren't running all zaddrs

[27-Oct-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> So why not have the option

[27-Oct-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we will have many options for people

[27-Oct-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and they interoperate, which is cool

[27-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Options are key.

[27-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> We dont want to exclude

[27-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Even if they're using taddrs

[27-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we also have a SuperLite wallet!

[27-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That can only do taddrs

[27-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and for that, it uses almost no RAM and no bandwidth

[27-Oct-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so you can run it on your smart toilet, etc

[27-Oct-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I can't believe we got one so fast lol

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alexandrus there is some play money to test our stuff out

[27-Oct-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just 1 HUSH allows you to send 10,000 memos by default, so you can get a lot of privacy with just a bit of Hush üòÖ :hush_dark: :hush_white:
