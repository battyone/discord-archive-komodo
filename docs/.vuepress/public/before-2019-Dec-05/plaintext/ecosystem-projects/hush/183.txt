[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the images are all broke/etc

[10-Aug-19 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They have an app

[10-Aug-19 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But I think it's just a "VPN"

[10-Aug-19 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> basically sucking up your daata

[10-Aug-19 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Who knows what the code of that app is doing, and where it is sending the data

[10-Aug-19 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but you can promise, nobody builds apps for free. Somebody is sucking up your data to be sold to somebody else

[10-Aug-19 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I like to know these things to tell other users

[10-Aug-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Otherwise, how does that company pay the devs that write the apps?

[10-Aug-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Exactly

[10-Aug-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Sell data

[10-Aug-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> With Hush, you know where the funds come from. The 10% FR funds development, we will never sell data to anybody about Hush users. I would rather delete the Hush git repo and stop working on it

[10-Aug-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It's cool to say, we are Hush and we do this.
It's better to say, we are Hush and we do this, and these guys do this. And this is why we want you to use Hush

[10-Aug-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Loki, that is a real project, but I don't know how their messenger works. I think it requires their masternodes

[10-Aug-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush has always been against masternodes

[10-Aug-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And if other projects do good things, good.
But we know what we do

[10-Aug-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Loki is built on Monero codebase, and that has no memo field. There is no way to do chat-based stuff directly on the blockchain, with standard XMR tools. Maybe they added stuff, but it makes me feel like the chat messages are just routed by masternodes, but not actually on the blockchain. I have no idea

[10-Aug-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> People know Duke Leto and know that he is trustworthy, and they know what he has done. 
You have a proven record of working with privacy.

[10-Aug-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I read the Loki whitepaper over a year ago and I don't think it said much about chat then

[10-Aug-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You think it's nothing to do with monero

[10-Aug-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It is something separate, an add on

[10-Aug-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So, masternodes get paid to route your chat messages, that is what I think Loki is doing

[10-Aug-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Monero has no memo field, and so it has no way to send encrypted data to your recipient

[10-Aug-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Only Zcash protocol does that. Now, I am not a Monero expert, and maybe things have been extended or changed. But that is how I understand it

[10-Aug-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'll go ask. And download the white paper

[10-Aug-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There will be different implementations of chat than Hush will implement. All Hush operations are "on-chain"

[10-Aug-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> File uploads, every chat message, every single one is stored on-chain forever

[10-Aug-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> What is the advantage/disadvantage to that?

[10-Aug-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in encrypted form

[10-Aug-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> scalability is the concern

[10-Aug-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I see

[10-Aug-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but, also, it opens up use cases

[10-Aug-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> many use cases of HushList, absolutely need on-chain stuff. Otherwise, you can't prove that you knew something at a certain time, and you wouldn't get all the censorship-resistance

[10-Aug-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Every Hush full node is a backup of all data stored on Hush blockchain

[10-Aug-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Really?

[10-Aug-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> All of it

[10-Aug-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Yes

[10-Aug-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> memo fields are encrypted

[10-Aug-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> only owners of the private key of the receiving address can decrypt it

[10-Aug-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but it's all there, encrypted, on every single Hush full node

[10-Aug-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So, protip: For sensitive data, encrypted data AGAIN, inside the memo field, is a good idea. Just plan for the worst

[10-Aug-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I guess it's necessary to have all of the data

[10-Aug-19 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nodes can choose to delete some data, but all full nodes have access to the data. Some full nodes can "prune" their data to use less disk space

[10-Aug-19 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I just got a laptop

[10-Aug-19 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm going to start download tonight

[10-Aug-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> current Hush blockchain is about 600MB on disk

[10-Aug-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and you need to download 50MB of sapling files

[10-Aug-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Np

[10-Aug-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's not too bad

[10-Aug-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Verus Agama took forever to dl

[10-Aug-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you are using hush binaries, they still might download more stuff. It's only the newest code that got rid of that and we haven't released binaries yet

[10-Aug-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Had to download Zcashparams

[10-Aug-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, it will do all that stuff

[10-Aug-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in the future binaries, those downloads won't be necessary

[10-Aug-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It's just a DL

[10-Aug-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Thats a small thing lol

[10-Aug-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I can't find it in me, to ever bitch about a DL or setup lol

[10-Aug-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> People work too hard for that

[10-Aug-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Well, I appreciate that. Many of us have access to good internet

[10-Aug-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Mostly I work on that stuff for all the people without good internet, and also for Tor users, where bandwidth is at a premium

[10-Aug-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and the #1 reason, was because it bothered me. None of those downloads were *actually* needed, but because of lots of technical debt, were required for no good reason. That just really bothered me

[10-Aug-19 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I had to modify freaking Rust code to prevent those files from being downloaded, and at first I gave up but then went back to it and figured it out

[10-Aug-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Yeah we are lucky to have very good access to good internet, at good prices.

[10-Aug-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And a lot of people still use dial-up

[10-Aug-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I used dial up 20+ yrs ago

[10-Aug-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> 1/5th of a century ago

[10-Aug-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's perspective

[10-Aug-19 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Internet isn't everything.
But it is something to be thankful, that we have this technology and it's easy to access and not expensive

[10-Aug-19 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> With that appreciation, then we can begin to understand the need for privacy

[10-Aug-19 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi try to only buy batch 1 z9 mini's

[10-Aug-19 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they are worth paying 50% more than a batch 2, and don't even buy a batch 3 if you can help it

[10-Aug-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, I also fondly remember the sounds of dial-up modems and even writing my own connection scripts for linux manually. Fun times

[10-Aug-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> that's Haven

[10-Aug-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> oh, that is the Haven app

[10-Aug-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> yeah

[10-Aug-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so Haven is just the OB mobile app?

[10-Aug-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> its nice

[10-Aug-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Yes

[10-Aug-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> it's on iOS too

[10-Aug-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> released July 29

[10-Aug-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it makes a lot of sense for them. I follow some OB people on twitter

[10-Aug-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They have a zcash wallet

[10-Aug-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> inside the apl

[10-Aug-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @RunningMantheCoin we should probably try to get Hush into this Haven app thing

[10-Aug-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> 5 cryptos

[10-Aug-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if they are open to other coins

[10-Aug-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Why not?

[10-Aug-19 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'll reach out

[10-Aug-19 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 👍

[10-Aug-19 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763

Those affected by @coinbase UK issues: this is limited to Coinbase UK only. UK residents can still buy/sell Zcash through @cex_io. No other exchanges in the UK affected. To pre-empt speculation, we confirm that Zcash is 100% compatible with UK regulations & KYC/AML require...

[10-Aug-19 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> how about for the online open bazaar

[10-Aug-19 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ECC says this is not because the UK doesn't like Zcash, but it's hard to believe them

[10-Aug-19 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Zcash is in trouble

[10-Aug-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Yes, they only have 11 months of money left

[10-Aug-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Imagine, spending $1.1M USD per month, and ZEC keeps dropping in value

[10-Aug-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> this coinbase shit is unacceptable

[10-Aug-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> after that coinbase earn donation

[10-Aug-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and you only have a few months of money left. Hundreds of employees. Paying rent on offices in multiple countries

[10-Aug-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The list goes on of their horrible financial decisions
