[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not a huge fan of giving money to amazon, they have enough

[02-Jun-19 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I'm a fan of aliexpress, i've used it many times. They are the fastest store in china that i've used to ship stuff, less than 2 weeks to Europe with their standard shipping method(might not be available for bigger stuff).

[02-Jun-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't think aliexpress does fast shipping to the US, do they?

[02-Jun-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> looks like they do, but it's a bit more expensive

[02-Jun-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @dukeleto By the way, did Agama change something because it looks like old Hush t1 priv keys work correctly on agama now, no need to use wif to wif it seems

[02-Jun-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 they might have made it smarter to recognize both, or do the wif2wif automatically

[02-Jun-19 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> That's one step less for the end user, so good üòÉ

[02-Jun-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> @dukeleto @heguli97 Thanks for the answers. It seems that resellers double price. I found a Z11 here, but I have to see it working first, because it can be a mugging scam.  
I dedicate myself to reballing chip, solder and repairer of mainboards, bought a lot on Aliexpress and never any problem ... Well yes, some fake-Nike broke down in 300m walking ... the show back home with sneakers destroyed and laughter of death .... Worth the money

There has been so much progress for $HUSH in the past few weeks, from a new mainnet, new exchanges, web wallet, block explorers, etc. We‚Äôre sure many of you are wondering where this is headed, what are the team‚Äôs future plans? All we have to say is... Soon....

[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> Can you recommend the best exchange to acquire HUSH?

[02-Jun-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I'd say Graviex or altilly, then there's safe.trade too which might have lower prices

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 define "fancy" üòÉ

[03-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I want it to be shiny, sexy, snazzy, slick, all the good "s" words. But "fancy", not sure

[03-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 we have a pretty stock UI from zecwallet, but I really do want to customize it

[03-Jun-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have requested a "dark mode" theme from zecwallet, because this white background is killing my eyes

[03-Jun-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we need some kind of awesome dragon when the wallet opens, it currently opens up a blank logo box

[03-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this interface is QT, not a web browser

[03-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we definitely need more images and stuff in our GUI

[03-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> A dark mode would be a good start and then maybe some modernization, in my opinion it looks kind of "basic" currently

[03-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> white is so 1996

[03-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 it's ok, zecwallet is very plain and boring UI by default, I get that

[03-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and we inherited that plain/boring UI

[03-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But also, it's a good blank canvas. And there are no Javascript security problems hiding in our wallet

[03-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i have been mostly focused on fixing bugs and adding features, but graphics and UI/UX is becoming very important

[03-Jun-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ZecWallet itself has not been used extensively in production by many people, I can tell. But it's a very promising base to build on, well written code

[03-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> additionally, I can read C++ and feel confident about how SilentDragon works. Hush-NG was a complete mystery on many many layers to me. Very happy to not be a nodeJS coder anymore

[03-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all these issues I am reporting will be valuable to PIRATE as well, since SevenSeas is a zecwallet fork too
