[dscrd-hush] <dogracer> @phm87 you are a good morning bot methinks I see the same good morning from you on a bunch of channels. Trying to stay "active" to get randomly tipped more often, no?  #CalledOut

[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Hello. I am a notary node operator and mining pool op. I am not a bot @dogracer . Sorry ifI said good morning too many times. I don t care about tip

[02-Nov-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dogracer> @phm87 sorry then. I saw you posting on the dead k64 project on a daily basis. Again apologies

[02-Nov-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Yes. My aim is to be polite. I don t own any k64 but i know some k64 hodlers. No problems man. Cheers

Does instant messaging over Lightning have killer application potential? The world needs censorship-resistant chatting and with Lightning, compensating the network for message relay comes naturally.

[dscrd-hush] <denio> Thank you! 😇

[03-Nov-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SDL does not need to download the full blockchain, so it's very good for people that pay for bandwidth or have slow connections

[03-Nov-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't know exact calculations, but I would guess it uses tens of megabytes of bandwidth, versus over 1GB for a Hush full node to sync currently

[03-Nov-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so my rough estimate would be SDL maybe uses 10X-100X less bandwidth

[03-Nov-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can also still connect the android app to SDL! The android app can connect to :SD: or SDL and I think that is pretty awesome
