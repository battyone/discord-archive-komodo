[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It should be as easy as "download zip, unzip, click exe, wait, click hushd tab, screenshot". We can give them a little script to follow, too

$HUSH has gone plaid and surpassed all $ZEC protocol coins by being the first pure-Sapling mainnet and removing the need to download 1.6GB of files before syncing your node!

This new SilentDragon Windows binary is Point+Click, syncs in <20 minutes!!!

Just over 1/3rd of all $HUSH that will ever come into existence has already been mined!
Current circulating supply is ~7.2M of 21M and ~113K HUSH is currently in shielded addresses, i.e. ~1.6%.
Our very first halving happens in about 450 days.
