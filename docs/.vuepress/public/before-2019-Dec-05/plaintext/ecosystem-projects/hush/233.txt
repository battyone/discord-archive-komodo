[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Hello üôÇ

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> <takagiwa> Howdy, you are on a bridge, and might not see some stuff. This is our official discord with all channels: https://myhush.org/discord/

[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> atomic swaps will probably have higher privacy then cex anyway, since most of them got many of your meta data or even KYC data

[19-Sep-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> to increase privacy against amount attack would be goo to have sth like fuzzy sending, for example I would liek to set total amount to send, spread time like 2 days (gaussian sigma?) and click "send" then my wallet would make many random sends trying to make them the way to fulfill the gaussian or some other smooth distrib

[19-Sep-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> also this method could use a few of receiving addr and also a few of sending addr ?

[19-Sep-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> Im not sure but this seems usefull anyway even for full transparent coins to me

[19-Sep-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> ok maybe I overdid what I mean, but basically time frame for many random timed sends with random amounts would be good enough to me

[19-Sep-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> btw is there anything in crypto like few addr sharing the same coinbase? maybe I missed that it alread yexist ?

A new de-anonymization/linkability attack has come to light for all $ZEC and $XMR coins, being developed by $HUSH community members.
We are building a competitor to @chainalysis for Zcash + Monero forks.
We are self-funded but looking for investors to speed time-to-market....

What you of the CHOAM directorate seem unable to understand is that you seldom find real loyalties in commerce. When did you last hear of a clerk giving his life for the company? Perhaps your deficiency rests in the false assumption that you can order men to cooperate.

[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> regarding z-addr and privacy I was thinking of sth - let me know it that make sense : to construct wallet in a way where 1. you have single z-addr that is actually "hidden" not being used by user 2. multiple z-addr (1024 or more seed based) to be used as sending and receiving ("working z-addr"), possible different per tx 3. all this to have a common balance on the hidden z-addr and use it through the other "working" z-addr.

[20-Sep-19 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> this way user never gives away his true bsalance addr and is more safe ? idk ? maybe this is stupid

[20-Sep-19 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> so when user would send using wallet he would actually (the wallet) make 2 tx hidden z-addr-> working z_addr -> some other z-addr then single tx like my zaddr -> some other z addr

[20-Sep-19 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> hidden z addr would serve as a shared balance for multiple working z addr

[20-Sep-19 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> actually next to the hidden addr could be another hidden addr that could serve as the "burning 1e-8" to support privacy that was ment the unspent tx preventin analysis ?
