[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> So I'll wait for the release

[11-Aug-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm sweating it tho. With Binance closing for US users

[11-Aug-19 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yep. Many KMD people were talking about it on Twitter recently

[11-Aug-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Even if I did know a lot about ZK proofs, I wouldn't help them

[11-Aug-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Who knows what nefarious reason they want to know about it

[11-Aug-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Create an offshoot premium digital dollar for future Intel spending

[11-Aug-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> When we go to block chain national currencies, do you think govts will post all their spending for us to scutinuze?

[11-Aug-19 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> doubtful

[12-Aug-19 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @dukeleto This OB & Haven thing, is moving along üòÉ

[12-Aug-19 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> half way there üòÖ

[12-Aug-19 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have a Github repo for an OB plugin to support HUSH

[12-Aug-19 01:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Nice. üëè

[12-Aug-19 01:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Good work Duke

[12-Aug-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we inched toward the final solution. Making a github repo is a big step

[12-Aug-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and reading the Go code, it won't be hard to add Hush to OB, with transparent addresses

[12-Aug-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they already support those

[12-Aug-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> adding support for zaddrs would be a decent amount of work

[12-Aug-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so the goal is taddrs first

[12-Aug-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then assess

[12-Aug-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Yes.

[12-Aug-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Have you used Haven?

[12-Aug-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no

[12-Aug-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You can buy all gift cards on there

[12-Aug-19 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It will grow. But it's the near future

[12-Aug-19 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Mobile adoption is where it's at.

[12-Aug-19 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> No restrictions on items either

[12-Aug-19 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I mentioned HUSH in the Haven telegram.

[12-Aug-19 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And I know bc it was quiet, that some checked out the site

[12-Aug-19 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It was dead quiet for 2-3 minutes

[12-Aug-19 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Now we have a GitHub repo

[12-Aug-19 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Duke is proactive

[12-Aug-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is 95% of what we need to support HUSH on OB

[12-Aug-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> needs to be tested

[12-Aug-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and that only supports taddrs

[12-Aug-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> supporting zaddrs is "real work"

[12-Aug-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> supporting taddrs is basically free, because ZEC is supported

[12-Aug-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i just have to go change a few things in a few dozen places to make it work

[12-Aug-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Hell yeah

[12-Aug-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Maybe we can get that one guy to sell physical coins on there

[12-Aug-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You work fast Duke

[12-Aug-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's why I like you.
You support privacy & aren't afraid to put in long hours, doing tedious work.

[12-Aug-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Or more challenging work.

[12-Aug-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> OpenBazaar is known. It's not new, it's been around

[12-Aug-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Haven - July 29

[12-Aug-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> OB has been around a while, but Haven, their mobile app, is pretty new

[12-Aug-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Interesting site

[12-Aug-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> What makes it private.  Because it still needs ship to address

[12-Aug-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Z9 mini for $900

[12-Aug-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's p2p

[12-Aug-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you make a deal with seller

[12-Aug-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> some people sell digital goods, like they sell LTC for BTC, etc

[12-Aug-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> many people sell cryptocoins on there

[12-Aug-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, people sell random stuff like Ebay

[12-Aug-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> No fees

[12-Aug-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Only tx fees

[12-Aug-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I haven't used it, but I have followed the OB devs on twitter for a while.

[12-Aug-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> OB isn't trying to rake in fees via payment methods, it seems.

[12-Aug-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It's a different method of adoption

[12-Aug-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> OB probably charges some % of total cost of item, like Ebay

[12-Aug-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> No

[12-Aug-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I haven't used it, and don't know the biz model

[12-Aug-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Free listings

[12-Aug-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I don't get it yet either

[12-Aug-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> why pays for OB to keep the servers running? and expensive developers?

[12-Aug-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But we could try to get om every exchange.
This is a different way to increase HUSH adoption.

[12-Aug-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'll go ask

[12-Aug-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I really want to see businesses accepting HUSH as payment, that really helps adoption in many ways

[12-Aug-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Firstly, miners can spend HUSH in places, instead of selling at market rates

[12-Aug-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and increases liquidity

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> It it's pretty sick

[12-Aug-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Maybe when hush goes to $20

[12-Aug-19 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It‚Äôs a decentralized network, each user runs their own server!

[12-Aug-19 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @dukeleto what kind of businesses?

[12-Aug-19 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> It's hard for those businesses to value hush if not at exchange rates

[12-Aug-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Well ....an opportunity has presented itself

[12-Aug-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> with ZCash

[12-Aug-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It's a question of, who can offer what & is that valued by users, or not

Happy to report that $HUSH is working on @openbazaar and @HavenPrivacy integration! 
Currently transparent addresses are supported and shielded address support is the eventual goal
