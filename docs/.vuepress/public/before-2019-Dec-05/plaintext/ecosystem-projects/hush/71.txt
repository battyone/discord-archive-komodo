[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @LocoMB you can put that into the "wif to wif" Tool of Agama Desktop wallet, and the output of that will be a privkey you can import to HUSH3. You can also use your old wallet.dat on a new HUSH3 node with -zapwallettxes option

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSHmate is not released

[20-Apr-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> komodo-tx is a binary which you will never need, but it exists

[20-Apr-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> bitcoind, bitcoin-cli, bitcoin-tx are the 3 binaries of Bitcoin, which became zcashd, zcash-cli, zcash-tx and then komodod, komodo-cli, komodo-tx

[dscrd-hush] <penguin> just use komodo paper wallet. then import when you are happy with what you see.

[20-Apr-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> I tried but I don't see HUSH balance

[20-Apr-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> thats normal if you imported to a komodo wallet.

[20-Apr-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> komodo is not hush

[20-Apr-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> how will I mine on a Komodo wallet ?

[20-Apr-19 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> What about online wallet? And miming on them.

[20-Apr-19 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @Inevitability The web wallet is online ( https://wallet.myhush.org ) but the transfer HUSH from the holder to another address does not work at the moment. Modification in progress.

[20-Apr-19 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> I try to send HUSH from my new web wallet to exchange and a see this: "Error. Error: Request failed with status code 400"  what is that?

[20-Apr-19 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> See above. The code must be updated / finalized.

[20-Apr-19 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @gilardh, I'd suggest with all the impatient people who don't read everything fully, not to announce a partially working web wallet. lol

[21-Apr-19 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @Inevitability , Code 400 means you must be patient. Developers are working on updating GUI applications to use the new Hush3 blockchain. ðŸ˜‰

For developers it means something else.

[21-Apr-19 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `does not work at the moment` means that it does not work at the moment? who'da thunk it?

[21-Apr-19 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> I look at miningpoolstats - statistics such that mining both

[21-Apr-19 06:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @Inevitability on miningpoolstats, 'hush3' is current HUSH and 'hush' is the unsupported chain
not that their stats are accurate ðŸ˜›
