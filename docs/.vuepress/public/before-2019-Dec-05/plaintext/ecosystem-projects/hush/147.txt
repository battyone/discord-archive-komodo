[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Maybe I misunderstood

[11-Jul-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's a general protocol that will run on any Sapling-enabled coin (sprout is compatible but too slow for real usage)

[11-Jul-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I need to update the HushList whitepaper for sapling stuff

[11-Jul-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh who are you writing for? end users? investors? miners?

[11-Jul-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush still has yet to have it's first halving after almost 4 years. Pirate has already gone thru a halving in a year

[11-Jul-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> For miners, Hush is much more forgiving to not being there at the very beginning

[11-Jul-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> uh oh, I see CG typing

[11-Jul-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> Comparing PIRATE, VRSC, and HUSH is like comparing a hammer, a pipe-wrench, and a bench-vise üòï

[11-Jul-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HushList protocol is compatible with all 3, since all 3 have sapling

[11-Jul-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't consider VRSC privacy-focused

[11-Jul-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> since you must keep all funds transparent to protect their network and earn staking "interest"

[11-Jul-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> I meant with the "where does HUSH find its place" comment

[11-Jul-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - MineHush.com agreed, just clarifying for others

[11-Jul-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> Lol @ComputerGenie - MineHush.com nice metaphor

[11-Jul-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto the article/review/interview would be for the readers of the TheDailyChain, a pretty hot crypto news site. For a crypto audience at large, including noobs. I DMd u a few mins ago actually

[11-Jul-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> Another would be:
Between breakfast and supper (and prob lots of other meals), how can lunch find its place?

[11-Jul-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> is Mercer still involved in Hushlist protocol?

[11-Jul-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto Thanks Duke! How can i get my 10 HUSH?) And when POS on BTCH?)

[11-Jul-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> A good defense of HUSH's idiosyncrasy

[11-Jul-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> DM the tipbot and it will help you @Takoy_Nahal

[11-Jul-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> macOS

[11-Jul-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Gigamesh.  Are you coming from the pirate community?

[11-Jul-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh radix42 is not actively involved in the development but I speak to them often, still a spiritual advisor, if you will

[11-Jul-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh if you care about privacy and freedom, it's a good idea to know how to compile software yourself. Right now there are no Mac SilentDragon binaries, but you can compile it üòÉ

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @AkiraX I am sailing thru the Komodo Archipelago (as I call it). Yes I spent much time on Pirate Island, and will return to its sandy shores to pay a visit and drink ale in *The Wailing Barnacle* once more.

[11-Jul-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !tip @gigamesh 25 hush (for asking good questions)

[11-Jul-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> üí∏ @dukeleto sent @gigamesh **25.00 HUSH** (‚âà $1.12).

[11-Jul-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> now you can make about 250,000 memo messages (of default size), so much privacy in just 1 HUSH

[11-Jul-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can DM the tipbot for help or see how people use it in #tipbot_general

[11-Jul-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX good question

[11-Jul-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SilentDragon will have an Upload/Download Memo feature, so you can upload a file, or save a memo as a local file

[11-Jul-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I don't see it yet though.  Upcoming feature

[11-Jul-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Correct

[11-Jul-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> had to get something out, in peoples hands, to find some bugs/etc

[11-Jul-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Once we allow uploaded files on Hush, the genie is out

[11-Jul-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is no putting the cap back that bottle

[11-Jul-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `there is no putting the cap back that bottle`
buy better scotch :troll:

[11-Jul-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We can support large files, but I am not sure what file size should be supported by default

[11-Jul-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Let me know when I can rub the lamp

[11-Jul-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hax0rs can always change things, but I need to set a default that helps prevent spamming the Hush chain with huge files

[11-Jul-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The Hush chain is not for storing all 37 seasons of Friends in HD, we need to protect against that. Hush is for very important, small-to-medium sized files

[11-Jul-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Since it takes many minutes of CPU time to upload megabytes, that is also a protection. It's usually going to be easier for people to upload to some other service

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am genuinely worried about people abusing Hush, and what recourse we will have once these tools are out in the open

[11-Jul-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But tools are not good nor evil, that is my philosophy

[11-Jul-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763

[11-Jul-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal at this point, i would pay you to launch PoS on BTCH, it's a good idea, but my time is very very restricted. Mostly I am focusing on Hush+HushList+SilentDragon. Hard to give time to BTCH, we need more people working on things. We have HUSH + BTCH funds to pay people, we just need people willing to work

[11-Jul-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `I am genuinely worried about people abusing Hush`
Wouldn't fees cover most of the issues (outside of content "legality")?

[11-Jul-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - MineHush.com also yes, being blamed for content legality is also an issue to worry about

[11-Jul-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[11-Jul-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[11-Jul-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gosh, the trouble that could be caused

[11-Jul-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or you can store 1MB for 1 txfee in Zcash, lol

[11-Jul-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `paying a few txfees to fill a block, can you think of how to abuse that?`
You could always follow BTC and push the default higher so that almost no node will accept a "reasonable" fee
Not my preference, but an option

[11-Jul-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> if HUSH price goes x10, does the cost of sending messages x10? obv at discretion of miners i guess, but can fees be kept stable as HUSH token price increases?

[11-Jul-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto thx for the 250,000! üòÉ

[11-Jul-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh Hush transactions cost 0.0001 HUSH, that is fixed. We can't control or dictate the fiat price of Hush

[11-Jul-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you buy a bunch of Hush, you have locked in a very cheap cost for your future private communications

[11-Jul-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if the price of Hush goes 10X (it's been up to $18 ish, so we have seen much more than 10X from where we are), then things cost 10X as more, in fiat

[11-Jul-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Getting some Hush when it's super cheap is a good hedge against the future, where privacy will need to be paid for. We already live in a world where you must pay for privacy, or your data is the product being sold and making people money

[11-Jul-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ATH for Hush is about 160K sats and about $17.89 USD, according to coingecko, iirc

[11-Jul-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are at what, 4 cents today?

[11-Jul-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763

The very last $HUSH v2 (old network) has been mined, took about two months (16909 blocks) for miners to switch to our new mainnet. $ZEC would have forcibly turned nodes off, but I let miners make their own decision üòá
