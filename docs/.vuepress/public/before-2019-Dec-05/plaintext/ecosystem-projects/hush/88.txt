[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `not what is best in some theoretic sense in a theoretical situation on a theoretical coin`
I agree, that's why I'll always be vocal when I see a precedent being set (as in this specific case)

[17-May-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> >But you played arbiter/decider when cryptoia got hacked, why not when I got hacked....

[17-May-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's indeed a slippery slope

[17-May-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I can tell you this: DigitalPrice has 30,000 HUSH of user funds, essentially hostage, because users don't seem to care to bother DP to withdraw and DP doesn't care to send them back. I could have decided to do something about that on the new Hush v3 chain, but that is too slippery a slope. The cryptopia attack was very clearly a 51% attack and it effects 95% of Hush hodlers, unfortunately. It's very cut and dry. DP is not a situation I want to touch, for the reasons you describe CG

no
fairly, they belong to the attacker
Topia HAS NO FUNDS. Not on v2, not on v3

topia has nothing```
P.S. - that's my true stance ðŸ˜›

[17-May-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If I never interact with another exchange again, that would be great

[17-May-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I just want do code ðŸ˜…

[17-May-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool the attacker is the biggest whale in HUSH v2 land, their immutability was preserved. I know it's not something you like, but it's what we have ðŸ˜ƒ

[17-May-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> If I give my $5 to John and Sally robs John, should I get the $5 back or should John? If I get it back, then how does John get made whole?

[17-May-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> Even better, how do I prove that John (who is possibly legally barred from disclosing his records) didn't provide a service for that $5 and I no longer have any claim to it?

[17-May-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> in this case it seems pretty clear the funds were from the 51% attacker

[17-May-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> there is a class of cryptopia users who lost all their coins when cryptopia did

[17-May-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> however, through the sequence of events these coins came back into the control of the team

[17-May-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i dont think there is any comparable precedent

[17-May-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> ultimately human judgement needs to be used

[17-May-19 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `ultimately human judgement needs to be used`
Sadly, that more the problem than the solution, we all have skewed judgments

[17-May-19 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> morality and ethics can be murky and messy

[17-May-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> yet, here we are

[17-May-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> what if the community got them back though mining, Role back the halving or temporarily increased payouts...just an idea

[17-May-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> there is no way to reimburse users who held funds on cryptopia without concrete data on holdings per user
either burn the remainder or use it for exchange listings (or whatever treasury purposes are needed)

[17-May-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> not many people mine anymore tbh

[17-May-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> my rig's been dead for a year now

[17-May-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> as a side-note, the only entity that can provide concrete data is cryptopia itself. user transaction dumps or screenshots cannot be trusted

[17-May-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Note this is my opinion:
Firstly the coins don't belong to Cryptopia, the users using that exchange including myself should have not stored coins on the exchange and the hack will have wipe all coins regardless. Also if 100% was safe the liquidation will only return ~30% of the value.

[17-May-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> it is unlikely they will dump user funds (talking about other coins) as they are not theirs to begin with, and that would be opening up a can of worms in potential lawsuits

[17-May-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> most likely scenario is effectively burnt coins

[17-May-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> the funds are never touched again

[17-May-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> My way will let the funds stay in the founder and developers have it with one condition. They sell off over the period of 2 years(equal selloff). My second one is auction in bulk and fund be kept to list to a new exchange.

[17-May-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <hellcatz - LuckPool> If a human makes software that can make a decision, isn't that still a human decision since it originated from a human?  hehe

[17-May-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `there is no way to reimburse users who held funds on cryptopia without concrete data on holdings per user`
That was a good chuck of the point I was trying to make

[17-May-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> yes by proxy

[17-May-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <hellcatz - LuckPool> If humans are flawed,  computers are flawed, we made them...

[17-May-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> well, by default, you can't trust cryptopia so i guess the point is moot

[17-May-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _is still of the mindset that the attacker earned the coins and they are rightfully his/hers on a protocol level_

[17-May-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> you sound like a person who'd say you're here for the technology, not for the money

[17-May-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> i bet you ran SETI on your PC too

[17-May-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool lol, opensource and technically on protocol level he earned it.

[17-May-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> earn
VERB gain deservedly in return for one's behaviour or achievements.

[17-May-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> Not sure how I "sound", but I can say that I make these statements from a position of someone that got a worm last year, lost a good chunk of KMD, and still holds the same position

[17-May-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> how the heck do you even get a worm

[17-May-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @JWolf (WW Clan leader) I love the mining idea. next 20000 blocks or so the coins will be paid equally. Miners have the power.

[17-May-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> if i got a worm, it would probably crash due to missing dependencies

[17-May-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I was an idiot and used an unchecked exe that I downloaded to windows PC

[17-May-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> yeah people that still support the coin would benefit and we know no answer will be perfect...

[17-May-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> the mining idea just means that a large mining operation will target hush for 20k blocks, and the average user will be no better off

[17-May-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @JWolf (WW Clan leader) 
Earned on a protocol level, not on a moral or ethical level

[17-May-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool same position on KMD or didn't get fired for it? ðŸ˜„

[17-May-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> jk jk

[17-May-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> "position" on the subject
I've never been on a team ðŸ˜›

[17-May-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> Mining it is a way more moral than stealing it...

[17-May-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `stealing` is a subjective term

[17-May-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Pepin the Healer As far as potential lawsuits, we good since we kept the original chain. The new chain should be a seen as a favor to the community and 'we random airdrop to old users'. No obligation to return any funds but I don't like people losing there funds also.

[17-May-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> was talking from the perspective of topia/liquidators
they cannot sell what is not theirs

[17-May-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> for hush, that's also very literal

[17-May-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Pepin the Healer from MtGox we seen how that played out.

[17-May-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> pirl is doing a fork to prevent dumps. others are taking no action

[17-May-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> fun fact - to dump ANY of the other alts they'd have to pay contractors to update wallets

[17-May-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> if we just get the balance and user email address I think it will be the best. We create a temp site that users can go claim there coin to the new address. We email them a somerandom key phase and they sign the message with that and release the funds to them.

[17-May-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> It still comes back to a single question:
Where do you draw the line?
1 HUSH? 1000 HUSH? 100000 HUSH?
1 user impacted? 10 users impacted? 10000 users impacted?
Does the 3rd party that physically possessed the key always get shorted?

[17-May-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> most of the alts on there took such a hit that dumping at these prices wouldn't even reimburse the contractors in question

[17-May-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> I think it was 650000

[17-May-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> 70% of coin x might blast through whatever thin orders exist on another exchange and put them straight to 1 sat

[17-May-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> If the theory is to take possession of the coinage to make someone whole, then the only remedy is to return the coinage to topia

[17-May-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> 650 000 x 2000 sats auction = 13BTC =1  great exchange, 2 good exchange and lot small exchanges.

[17-May-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> wrong

[17-May-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> who wrong about what?

[17-May-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> dump that into any exchange and welcome to 1 sat

[17-May-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> hard to liquidate

[17-May-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> through mining you can control the timing

[17-May-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Pepin the Healer I meant auction where people can buy it at minimum of 2000 sats! Like a ICO in a way that will fund exchanges or the development.

[17-May-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `if we just get the balance and user email address I think it will be the best.`
Given current situation, is topia even legally allowed to disclose such info?

[17-May-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> if you can find someone to buy 12% of the mcap for a higher price than listed...

[17-May-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There has been a lot of good discussion, it's nice to see

[17-May-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is healthy and necessary

[17-May-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> some new options have been proposed, such as mining. It's very interesting to consider all proposals and see how each one benefits different people in different ways and has issues

[17-May-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Mining is an interesting option, but my guess is that most people who lost funds on Cryptopia were not miners

[17-May-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have no data to back this up, but my guess is <10% of Hush accounts on cryptopia were miners. Does that seem reasonable?

[17-May-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> given the situation, putting it everything into the/a treasury is probably the best option

[17-May-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Pepin the Healer Agreed, giving the coin to topia will set the market to 1 sats or they will dump slowly and the users will only get paid after 10 years. liquidation they need to convert all coins to a single value and payout based on that value.

[17-May-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> I remember people still mining to topia after the attack...

[17-May-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> lol

[17-May-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool protocol wise the hacker has all his coins on the old chain

[17-May-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> and none on the new one

[17-May-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> based hush3

[17-May-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> whatever sin it is to not issue the hacker coins on the new chain has already been committed

[17-May-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so our hands our clean of that sin

[17-May-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> my  secondary issue with mining (and I say this as a miner) is that it unfairly enriches those that mine during that period (unless subdivided out as long as there are rewards)

[17-May-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> a total of 417,817.51 HUSH was stolen from Cryptopia by the 51% attacker

[17-May-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> now, that the sin is behind us, the question i think is what is best for HUSH(3) community

[17-May-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `protocol wise the hacker has all his coins on the old chain`
I get that, which is why my "fallback" position is that the coinage belongs to topia

[17-May-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> or burn it...

[17-May-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> I suggest simply giving everybody that makes a claim a flat amount, so we estimate the number of people and allocate some decent percentage of coins for this. then use the rest for promotions that are easy to do

[17-May-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _claims 20k_

[17-May-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool it does add security(Higher difficulty) more exposure to new miners and pools.

[17-May-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> everyone will get the same amount

[17-May-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> and it cant be any 20k

[17-May-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> likely the average amount on topia was much less

[17-May-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so whatever that average amount is

[17-May-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> some who didnt have any on topia will get some free coins, but much worse things have happened
