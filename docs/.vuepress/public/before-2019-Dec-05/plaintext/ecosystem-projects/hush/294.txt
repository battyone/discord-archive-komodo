[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You think it'll bounce from here?

[22-Nov-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no idea

[23-Nov-19 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mr_Billion> Hi all my Hush mates, hope everyone is having a great week. I was sent a tip of 10 Hush but now I don't see how to get it.  any help would be appericated. That would be $120 worth of Hush if the price was the same as the first Hush I bought 🙂

[23-Nov-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mr_Billion> @Privatoshi I think its a 50/50 coin flip right now wether we bounce or not. there is so much bearish pressure I would not be surprised if it continued to push down. But you never know if china is going to say they really really like crypto lol. Im not a financial adviser but always trade with the trend and the trend is going down.

[23-Nov-19 12:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mr_Billion> If anyone can tell me a good reason to trade against the trend im all ears.

[dscrd-hush] <Mr_Billion> Thank you Sir

[23-Nov-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @Mr_Billion  You won't find anybody here trading against the trend.
I always advise people to not only trade with the trend, wait for confirmation, too.

[23-Nov-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I closed a 10x short earlier. 
$8060 to $7080.. I said it when I opened it on here.

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> How do you short bitcoin

[23-Nov-19 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> https://www.bitmex.com and similar

[23-Nov-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I wouldn't advise doing it, if you never have done it before.

[23-Nov-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> BitMex is another beast altogether

[23-Nov-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> 1 Billion dollars in daily volume

[23-Nov-19 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Agreed, it's like a casino but the rules are against you 100X worse

[23-Nov-19 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> At least in a casino the house must pay out usually 95%+ according to law

[23-Nov-19 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Bitmex just makes people poor all day

[23-Nov-19 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also, you can get mega-rich if you are smart+lucky. Hence all the users

[23-Nov-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> BitMex has an in house trading department

[23-Nov-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I forget the guys name, he's not that old.

[23-Nov-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But BitMex has a huge affect on the actual Bitcoin price

[23-Nov-19 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Because although it's a derivative, it requires BTC to get XBT

[23-Nov-19 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And they stop hunt

[23-Nov-19 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Both up and down

[23-Nov-19 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They know, a lot of BTC entered at $8100.

[23-Nov-19 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> If you short, 50x at $8100, it'll be about an $8280 or $8300 liquidiation

[23-Nov-19 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> So naturally, guys will set a stop loss at $8220, or somewhere even lower than that.

[23-Nov-19 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They will maybe move if down $40 quick, and then back up $90.

[23-Nov-19 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You must have good TA.
If not and you're on BitMex, just get Arthur's personal BTC address and just send it to him ahead of time.

[23-Nov-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> This is my system
I.   Draw trend lines.
II.  Locate Support/Resistance
III. Identity target to give confirmation.
IV. Identity entry, exit and stop loss.
V. Make trade, with confirmation.
VI. Exit exchange and find something else to do.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @P3L3 @Captain I speak serbo-croatian. I can confirm HR translation was made by human and not with a translator. At least 95+% of translation is correct (as much as I can understand), so the rest is probably also OK. I am not Croatian and not fammiliar with technical terms, so I can't guarantee for every single word.

[23-Nov-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <P3L3> Glad to hear that. Always looking for double check from another source. I've done multiple translations but context is always a bitch.. Let me know if you find anything out of order

[24-Nov-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi i would say it gives a tiny amount of privacy, but since AtomicDEX uses transparent addresses, even if you have a Tor IP, the addresses you use can uniquely identify you, later on.

[24-Nov-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> similar to using Tor with BTC. It can give you some privacy, but only at the IP address level, not at the address level.

It was 1994 23 year old Marc Andreessen @pmarca is interviewed in this rare video about a new company called Netscape.

He predicted that a simpler way to access information using a browser would bring just about everyone to the internet.

It sounded absurd.

He was right....
