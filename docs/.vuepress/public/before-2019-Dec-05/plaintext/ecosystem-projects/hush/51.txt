[02-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @blankmac - BasementPool the new Hush is not just disabling/removing Sprout. We are mining a new genesis block and there are consensus rules forbidding any sprout transaction to ever exist, or Sprout UTXO to ever exist. None of the sprout code exists anymore in the KMD/HUSH codebase. HUSH is the first chain to be Sapling from the genesis block, to my knowledge. First chain ever to use -ac_sapling=1 in KMD world, which means enforce sapling from block 1

[02-Apr-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most existing chains disabled Sprout, or have the updated "safer groth16" implementation of Sprout from Zcash, which they still use

[02-Apr-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD disabled it (which goes for all asset chains), but ZEN uses the latest Zcash sprout code, for instance

[02-Apr-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I agree with jl777 that sprout support is not worth it (more of a bug than a feature), and the latest horrible bug in ZEC sprout nullifiers/commitments is a great example of that.

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `which goes for all asset chains` wasn't there one that opted out for whatever reason?

[02-Apr-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> @dukeleto Thx for the info.  I was just curious since CMM reset their chain as well...but I don't think they eliminated the sprout code as I don't think sapling was enforced until block 100.

[02-Apr-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool i think OOT opted to not have sapling until later, because they just paid a bunch of exchange fees and the exchanges wanted to charge more fees to make a consensus update

[02-Apr-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I thought so, but there's too many projects anymore for me to be as involved as I'd like so I get cornfuzzed from time to time

[03-Apr-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Macro-Pool.com> all I ever get

[03-Apr-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Macro-Pool.com you could ask @TheTrunk who works on ZEL, that is not currently a supported wallet

[03-Apr-19 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the ZEL discord is more appropriate to ask that question

[03-Apr-19 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Apr-19 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Apr-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <stole - EquihashPro> @Macro-Pool.com what about utxo, have you tried to send small amounts? was that wallet used for pool fees?

[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> do i need to do anything to be ready for the fork?

[03-Apr-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If your funds are being kept on an exchange or in the web wallet, no. If not, make sure your funds are in a transparent address (beginning with a T)

[03-Apr-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If they're in a Z address, (only about 1% of all HUSH at the moment) then you'll need to send them over to a T address

[03-Apr-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> That's all that needs to be done üòÉ You can read more at https://myhush.org/sapling

[03-Apr-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cryptographic probably not, unless you have funds in an address that starts with z

[03-Apr-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if it's on an exchange, you don't need to do anything

[03-Apr-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Papa D> I apologize in advance if this has been brought up previously. When the air drop happens it will be dropped into Agama? I am assuming a new desktop wallet will follow that we can transfer back to. Just trying to clarify as I am a little confused about the way it is stated on the Myhush.org page.

[04-Apr-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> btch is already a komodo assetchain, so it's separate

[04-Apr-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[04-Apr-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dr.Terminus> cool, verified im in hush t address

[04-Apr-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[04-Apr-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Papa D> Thank you! Kind of similar to the way BTCH happened.

[04-Apr-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> basically, yes; access to it might take a bit for the update to push, though

[04-Apr-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
