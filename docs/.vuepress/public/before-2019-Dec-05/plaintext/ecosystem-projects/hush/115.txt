[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> good evening friends

[10-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> hi there

[10-Jun-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> over my head these jokes

[10-Jun-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @Akira X there was no "joke" I assume that duke was "oh gosh"ing about my belief that everyone should learn how to do raw transactions (and they are the best way to split funds for staking)

[10-Jun-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the way that LABS staking works is most likely how BTCH staking will work, so yes, learning raw transactions will be very valuable and yes, they are going to take some learning, especially if you don't use the CLI much

[10-Jun-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i think LABS provides some scripts to help with this low-level stuff

[10-Jun-19 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Its so scary to mine something so illiiquid and unknown

[10-Jun-19 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Labs

[10-Jun-19 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> I really don't understand the tech behind what labs is doing

[10-Jun-19 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Can you explain why labs is worth anything?

[10-Jun-19 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> It's a test coin?

[10-Jun-19 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> How does it improve kmd?

[10-Jun-19 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Why would someone want to buy labs?

[10-Jun-19 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> In the future

[10-Jun-19 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Since these are asic coins.  Most miners are asics

[10-Jun-19 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> So it's a pretty level playing field

[10-Jun-19 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> It's not like we are dealing with GPU miners

[10-Jun-19 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Or is the network so low that GPU mining labs is worth it

[10-Jun-19 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> I would think not because there are people with million hash

[10-Jun-19 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Btch still planned with verushash?

[10-Jun-19 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> Not that it should be taking up HUSH real estate, but:
LABS main value comes from its being an "ecosystem within an ecosystem" and it's the value payment coin for those that notarize LABS ecosystem chains (among other things).
It's not a "test coin"; think of a KMD ecosystem inside the KMD ecosystem and it would be the equivalent of the internal KMD, but since it has its own dev team and pace, it's kind of a bad analogy but hopefully enough to paint the picture.
Much of the work done in LABS has already produced a better komodod and iguana (as well as it being the place where staking inside the Komodo ecosystem began and survived testing).
Why would anyone want to buy any currency?
It's a 51:49 staking:mining chain so ASICs cannot over-run stakers, ever.

[10-Jun-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> So analogy is.  It's a VM that makes improvements on the PC?

[10-Jun-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Or os that builds better tools

[10-Jun-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> if that vm were self fixing and self replication and capable of paying people

[10-Jun-19 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> think of it more like a secure testing ground for chain environments and CCs

[10-Jun-19 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Ok.  So a sandbox for blockchains

[10-Jun-19 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> But I thought that's what pbaas was doing

[10-Jun-19 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I want to say yes, but unlike sandboxes it's protected stable enough to use for production as well

[10-Jun-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `But I thought that's what pbaas was doing`
yes and no, basically pbaas is you pay them and they do shit for you (set the chain, provide hash, etc)
labs = you do what you want/need and pay for what you use (notaries, dev work, etc)

[10-Jun-19 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Pbaas is Uber.   Labs is avis

[10-Jun-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Lol

[10-Jun-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> I read it.  Just dont know what I read

[10-Jun-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> pbaas is the french maid that gives you a happy ending
labs is the chick that makes you earn taking her home, but once you do you get to decide what happens because she's willing and bendy

[10-Jun-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Wonder if Facebook has looked at hush in any way

[10-Jun-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> For private messaging

[10-Jun-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Verus kmd and arrr got into zyrex

[10-Jun-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Are those coins also on safe trade?

[dscrd-hush] <al> hi all, i got lost more than 11K hush3 using agama wallet last week. any way ro recover this funds? devs have any solution to agama hack?

[10-Jun-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @al @aledel this is the first I am hearing of stolen HUSH

[10-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Akira X LABS is very speculative and if you only have 1 miner, you should probably mine something a bit less speculative, like HUSH, KMD, ARRR, ZEC, ZEN, etc... Also, this is not financial advice!

[10-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> LABS has come up with a way to make custom cryptocondition asset chains and other complex things, easy. I think of it as AWS for KMD. You could do it all yourself, every little server and detail. But LABS has ways to automate many things. That is the gist of it

[10-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Francis> How do u even check if your hush has been moved

[10-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Francis your address will be empty

[10-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and it will have gone to either KMD "good" address or attacker "bad" address

[10-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Francis> I cant even connect to the agama wallet

[10-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yeah

[10-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which version?

[10-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most likely it is too old to connect

[10-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Francis there are many valuable pinned messages, it will show you how to use your seedphrase in another wallet

[10-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Francis do you know your main address of your Hush agama wallet?

[10-Jun-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Jun-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I suggest looking up your address on our explorer to see if it has funds

[10-Jun-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you have the old t1 address, I can tell you the new R address version of it
