[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> yeah I just have my one on the swing and one on safetrade

[14-Apr-19 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This mostly would only happen to solo miners, if they didn't set a default address. Most people just have a few addresses, which is fine

[14-Apr-19 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @JWolf (WW Clan leader) that sounds pretty nice and easy. Safe.trade is also supporting our change

[14-Apr-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we will also have pools that support paying out directly to new Sapling zaddrs, which are fast as heck. A few seconds

[14-Apr-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the whole reason to get rid of Sprout zaddrs is that really bad bugs were found in them: http://myhush.org/sapling/

[14-Apr-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There is no way to know the value inside a zaddr (feature not a bug!) so it's impossible to migrate funds from a zaddr from one chain to another

[14-Apr-19 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That shows you how strong the privacy of a zaddr is

[14-Apr-19 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I seriously hope something like this never happens again, but we can't predict the future

[14-Apr-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> do you happen to know if zhash will auto-convert?

[14-Apr-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in theory, bad people can print infinite money inside of Sprout zaddrs, which is a really bad bug.

[14-Apr-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @JWolf (WW Clan leader) i have been working closely with zhashpro, i can ask them when i speak to them next

[14-Apr-19 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> each mining pool will have their own way of doing things

[14-Apr-19 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> some use s-nomp, some k-nomp or others

[14-Apr-19 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> 4sure thanxüçª

[14-Apr-19 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <juni> will crytopia comeback?

[14-Apr-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Apr-19 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <juni> i have hush coin very much there

This is what it looks like to mine a genesis block.

[dscrd-hush] <CryptoLuv> Do we need to do anything with regards to the above?

[14-Apr-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CryptoLuv depends, do you have funds in an address that starts with "z?" Yes if yes, No if no

[14-Apr-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and then use that address as your mining worker name

[14-Apr-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have no idea if some pools will support converting that address for you, that is up to them

[14-Apr-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
