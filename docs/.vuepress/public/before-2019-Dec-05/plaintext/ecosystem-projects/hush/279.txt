[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @dukeleto Correct, HushDroid QR scanner on SDA is not working

[06-Nov-19 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> however I was able to get AtomicDEX to scan a QR instantly, no problem

[06-Nov-19 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Camera access enabled, everything should be working

[06-Nov-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg can you test the QR feature on a different phone/tablet, running default Android, and see if the same problem happens? That will tell us if it's related to GrapheneOS, which the HushDroid runs, kind of like a fork of Android with all the Googley bits ripped out

[06-Nov-19 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> my guess is Graphene locks things down and maybe there is a different permission to ask for, or some weirdness

[06-Nov-19 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But wouldn't that impact all of my other apps that use a QR? I haven't experienced issues with any other application

[06-Nov-19 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I also don't own anything else running an android OS, only apple products

[06-Nov-19 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @heguli97 and @denio both reported using it successfully

[07-Nov-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg i think this is a bug only in the SDA codebase, and AtomicDEX probably does it correctly

[07-Nov-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg i just learned that Graphene dropped support for that Pixel you have, not sure if it's related

Keep your nudes on Facebook/Snapchat, code reviews in GitHub, customers in Salesforce, and your secret documents in GDrive/iCloud. 

Those companies surely don't grant anyone access to manipulate code or see private data with no accountability. Right?

[07-Nov-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> He is a big Hush supporter

[07-Nov-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I like Hush miners, even tho a miner should want the diff to be as low as possible ðŸ™‚

[07-Nov-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's really long-term miners, that have their miner running during the "dips" of diff/hash, that really get the best returns, in my opinion. Chasing after the top coin on WTM every day is a fools errand

[07-Nov-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most large miners use auto-changing scripts to switch to the top coin, and so it constantly changes and the numbers don't mean much

[07-Nov-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> since Hush is still a pretty low volume coin, many big miners leave us alone, which is good. It's mostly smaller farms and individuals that mine Hush, I would guess

[07-Nov-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> If I was to mine again and it was just a few rigs or asics,  I'd prospect mine. I'd be mining HUSH, ETP, ARRR

[07-Nov-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Not for a return today, but one 6 months from now.
