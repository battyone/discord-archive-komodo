[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> @Berg Download Loki Messenger and tell us your take

[14-Nov-19 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 i think loki uses masternodes to pass messages around, i don't fully know. i read their whitepaper a very long time ago before there was any code

[14-Nov-19 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Yeah I was just referring to the layout

[14-Nov-19 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> It looks like a copy of signal

[14-Nov-19 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> A green signal

[dscrd-hush] <perfectr> quick question

[14-Nov-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <perfectr> what happens to the hush we had on our t addresses?

[14-Nov-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <perfectr> !tip 2 random users 10 hush

*Use `!tip nomention` to stop being pinged by tips.*

[14-Nov-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @perfectr are you talking about the old Hush v2 chain balances?

[14-Nov-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @perfectr They are not lost.  There are now on the new blockchain.  The private key does not change.  But you will have a new address.  You must not use the address t anymore.

[14-Nov-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, @gilardh is correct

[14-Nov-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can use your old wallet.dat with the new hushd or SilentDragon, and sweep funds out

[14-Nov-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is probably the easiest way. If you just have 1 or a few private keys for a few addresses, you can import those via the CLI

[14-Nov-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hopefully the next version of the SD GUI can import them

[14-Nov-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i am not sure, maybe @denio knows if SDL can import an old Hush privkey. Probably not but it could learn how

[14-Nov-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There is no time limit to convert your funds, you can wait until the Heat Death Of The Universe if you want

[14-Nov-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> technically zaddr funds from our old chain are "lost", but we have set aside part of our Founders Reward in case anybody ever comes forward and can prove they had zaddr funds on the old Hush chain

[14-Nov-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there was about 70,000 HUSH in zaddrs on the old Hush chain, iirc

[14-Nov-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Nobody has ever come forward to claim them, and most likely they are from very early miners/users of Hush that lost or forgot about their wallets

[14-Nov-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And this bears repeating: When using your old wallet.dat on a new Hush chain: SWEEP FUNDS OUT, do not use that old wallet indefinitely. It will cause problems

[14-Nov-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you need help, ask in #wallet-support

[14-Nov-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <perfectr> @dukeleto yes
@gilardh ah I see so they are still recover-able, I'll try to use the SilentDragon and see if I can get them back, so I can just send them to a new R address without any issues?

[14-Nov-19 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @perfectr You do not have to transfer your funds to a new R address. You will automatically have a new R address.

[14-Nov-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gilardh not quite right, it's best to transfer to a new address created in a new wallet

[14-Nov-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <join> @dukeleto morning sr

[14-Nov-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @perfectr yes, make a new Hush address, backup that wallet.dat. Then use your old wallet.dat in SilentDragon, and send all funds to the new address

[14-Nov-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then, move the old wallet.dat out of the way one last time, and go back to your newly created wallet.dat

[14-Nov-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> why ? @dukeleto

[14-Nov-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> using an old wallet.dat on a different blockchain means all the transactions are invalid

[14-Nov-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it means your wallet.dat is very large, full of xtns that are invalid on the new chain

[14-Nov-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> makes many things slow

[14-Nov-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and finds bad bugs

[14-Nov-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a "hack" that works, because KMD and HUSH are compatible with Bitcoin at a deep level

[14-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's not something that is a "best practice"

[14-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a way to recover coins

[14-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Ok, thanks for this information.

[14-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you could also start HUSH with your Bitcoin wallet.dat or vice versa

[14-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the same stuff would be true

[14-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you would own all the equivalent addresses

[14-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and your transactions would be invalid

[14-Nov-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> owning an address on any Bitcoin-derived network means you own it on all Bitcoin-derived networks

[14-Nov-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because it's really a 256bit pubkey

[14-Nov-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is rendered as an address üôÇ

[14-Nov-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> addresses do not exist on the blockchain

[14-Nov-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> (I use a private key not wallet.dat...) Gloops

[14-Nov-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> üôÇ

[14-Nov-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> Nice

[14-Nov-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <perfectr> @dukeleto Then use your old wallet.dat in SilentDragon, and send all funds to the new address
problem is, SilentDragon is giving me an error when I try to use my old wallet :/

[14-Nov-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @perfectr let's go to #wallet-support and in that channel, let us know exactly which OS version, SilentDragon version and any other relevant data, including exact error messages (screenshots or text is fine)

Howdy Anons,

We wanted y'all to know that the Hush cryptocoin (built upon Bitcoin and Zcash Protocols) has been working on privacy tech longer than almost any other cryptocoin, and we have real usable products today, and more in the works.

We started as one of the first few Zcash forks in 2016 and now are built with Komodo (KMD) tech, which is a Zcash fork with large improvements.

You can learn more about our project here: https://myhush.org and you are cordially invited to our 
Discord: http://myhush.org/discord

One of our exciting new developments is being able to take these amazing ideas from 2 years ago:

https://github.com/leto/hushlist/blob/master/whitepaper/protocol.pdf

and apply them to our new mainnet which is drastically improved.

You can support our project by investing in Hush (you can learn more here: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hush/¬†) or we would love to talk about receiving a donation
if your group feels our community is worthwhile.

Thanks
```

[14-Nov-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @RunningMantheCoin i tried to step outside of our tiny sub-industry and speak with a bit different perspective. I don't want them to give us money unless they feel we are worth it

[14-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Nov-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> i will definitely test mining on it and see if it makes anything üôÇ

[14-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <aledel> It should on randomX

[14-Nov-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> that's on my radar, are there any other cpu friendly algorithms that i could try?

[14-Nov-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 that is a very good CPU to mine BLUR and most Monero CPU coins, like LOKI (which does randomx)

[14-Nov-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 make sure you have a new MB or you need to flash the bios of older mb's, fyi

[14-Nov-19 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> literally hundreds of coins to mine

[14-Nov-19 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> too many choices

[14-Nov-19 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> cool thanks for all the info üëç

[14-Nov-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> also that 3950x must be a beast of an cpu then, just got released to the press, 16c/32t and about the same power consumption than the 3900x but much more powerful, i just couldn't afford it :rolf:

[14-Nov-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 they are not in stock, miners bought them all

[14-Nov-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the were selling for $500 over stock price on ebay when they launched

[14-Nov-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 3950x has a lot more cores than the 3900x, so it's quite close to a threadripper
