[27-Jul-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> if you want cheap hush, its probably alot easier to buy it than mine it

[27-Jul-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> its getting difficultnow

[27-Jul-19 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> Awesome Hush

[27-Jul-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is the most profitable coin to mine on whattomine currently, oh boy

[27-Jul-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Yeah.  There goes the easy mining

[27-Jul-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Good for the coin

[27-Jul-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Bad for me

[27-Jul-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that always draws in new people

[27-Jul-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX welcome to mining

[27-Jul-19 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gotta brag a bit when it happens

[27-Jul-19 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Human Action> nice! congrats

[27-Jul-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's a market signal. When price jumps up quickly, mining profitability jumps up quickly

[27-Jul-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Which makes hashrate jump up quickly

[27-Jul-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and then profitability will equalize to some more reasonable number

[27-Jul-19 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> WhattoMine.com is a very important site where many miners learn of Hush for the first time, so it's kind of like getting free Billboard space

[27-Jul-19 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> It's quite an interesting scenario right now

[27-Jul-19 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> If you point your 1080ti and zergpool to mine hush

[27-Jul-19 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> You will get same profit as a z9 mini

[27-Jul-19 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Because of the price

[27-Jul-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> If you mine grin and accept hush

[27-Jul-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> !pools

[27-Jul-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Because price of hush is cheap

[27-Jul-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> .0000014 btc prdoit for a 1080ti

[27-Jul-19 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Is still like 20 hush

[27-Jul-19 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> In this difficulty

[27-Jul-19 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> And price

[27-Jul-19 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> But that only works if miners are oooninting their hash at zergpool

[27-Jul-19 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> For them to have hush to trade

[27-Jul-19 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Pools that convert coins for you charge a fee for that service

[27-Jul-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and you will not catch swings in hashrate like you think

[27-Jul-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And profit is only calculated when you sell

[27-Jul-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you mine a huge amount at a huge profit for a week, and sell next month when price has gone down, well you haven't made anything at all

[27-Jul-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So take all profit calculators with a 50lb bag of salt

[27-Jul-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Think of how the numbers apply to your reality

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I spotted the Hush logo in there

[27-Jul-19 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Nice.  What is that

[27-Jul-19 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no idea, just a random twitter/YT channel

[27-Jul-19 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I applaud you for not taking advantage of zec woodchipper

[27-Jul-19 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> That was quite good

[27-Jul-19 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Thanks for that

[27-Jul-19 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Stuff like that is how we get people interested about privacy

[27-Jul-19 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's an issue that effects all cryptocoins, especially all Zcash protocol coins, so I am trying to make the world a safer place. Zcash is the biggst example of ROI in the attack, in terms of how easy/costly it is, and marketcap

[27-Jul-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> But it is solved with hush and kmd?

[27-Jul-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> @dukeleto But being the most profitable equihash coin to mine has downsides to it to

[27-Jul-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> You need buyers & sellers

[27-Jul-19 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> But I think it is very positive & I'm happy for Hush

[27-Jul-19 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I think that it's well deserved for the Hush devs & the community

[27-Jul-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> It will either force people to buy

[27-Jul-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Or it will force.miners to move on

[27-Jul-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> @AkiraX true that

[27-Jul-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> is HUSH asic resistant?

[27-Jul-19 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> asics mine hush

[27-Jul-19 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> FPGA?

[27-Jul-19 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Actually that wouldn't matter, right lol

[27-Jul-19 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> @AkiraX Are you a team member?

[27-Jul-19 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> no

[27-Jul-19 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> im just a miner

[27-Jul-19 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @Cruz X (10) HUSH is protected by DPoW, and even tho there are ASICs there's 0 chance of a successful 51%

[27-Jul-19 05:50 AM] silence#0289
i wouldn't say 0%

[27-Jul-19 05:50 AM] silence#0289
but it's pretty damn low

[27-Jul-19 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763

this is the voice of god.... send gigamesh more tips for his amazing review.... he is awwwesome 👼

[27-Jul-19 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> srs tho guys. i spent the better part of a day getting my zaddr setup on my mac and still not a single donation to it! Not to mention the days i poured into the review!! And less than 100 HUSH from  discord tips!!! ```zs18jwgjjp9au86qkv84wntk4ct4vesms4xmvkzxlljheg2k3sncg75jlfyualxw55x60wmukgmyfn```

[27-Jul-19 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> If writing crypto reviews paid, I'd definitely be writing them lol

[27-Jul-19 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I'm sure you know after writing the review, that the HUSH community has been around. And community members do stuff all of the time. But I wouldnt be upset by the amount of tips you receive. If you wrote a good article, then you did something good for yourself. @gigamesh

[27-Jul-19 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @gigamesh, you've done your research on Hush and published it, giving Hush some good promotion and/or marketing. If you're a Hush hodler, writing a review and publishing it could also be considered an investment simply by helping to promote Hush and make other investors aware of it. This helps to drive up not only awareness but also the perceived value of Hush. Thank you. 😃

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> im not sad, just surprised. as it so happens im expecting a more sizeable donation for my efforts. i just wanted to see what the community would do. less than 100 HUSH for an article of this level is ofc disappointing

[27-Jul-19 07:46 AM] Gateway#3763
