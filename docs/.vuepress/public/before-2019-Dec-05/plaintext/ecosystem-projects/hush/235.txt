@zawy3 @fluffypony originally, I did not think it would work on $XMR. But since bulletproofs add in coinbase decoys, it seems viable. We will get y'all better info and suggested mitigations when we know more. It's all changing by the minute. https://t.co/ahCfYCBsIz

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @Moderator please keep in mind that the TROLL and ULTRA-TROLL role categories exist.
If someone comes in here and is disruptive, please feel free to assign roles as needed.
"TROLL" just turns their name pink, to let people know not to take them seriously - usually for first time offenders
"ULTRA-TROLL" blocks a user from any actions other than reading the channel

I try to assign these roles to anyone that isn't just a spamming bot, instead of kicking regular people üôÇ

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Estonian government has also pretty high ambitions with their e-citizen project. You can get e-citizenship if only once in a life appear there. Country of little over 1 million population has plans to have about 10 mio. e-citizens in next decade. In Estonia you can't only marry, separate and sell a house from your computer. Literally.
