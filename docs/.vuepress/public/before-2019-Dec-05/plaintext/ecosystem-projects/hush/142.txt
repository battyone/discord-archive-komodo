[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> BTC ‚ôª  BTC SV

[30-Jun-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> "SV" is even worse

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> To be completely honest, BTC is highly overrated towards alts. BTC has 1 adventage: it has the more secure network. That is because BTC was the first one and is the most widely used. BTC's mining, development and ownership are not decentralized. These ÀùelitesÀù or maximalist are pushing it forward. People with a lot of money, greed and desire to dominate. If traceable coin with 10 minutes block time would appear today, it would be complete rubbish. It would be a worthless coin. Now it would take many years for alts to really flourish. Probably 1 or 2 bubbles...

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `BTC is highly overrated towards alts.`
BTC *is* an "alt"
or
BTC is *the* thing
take your pick, you can't have both üòõ

[30-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Both is true.

[30-Jun-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> BTC can't be an alternitive ("alt")  to BTC üòõ

[30-Jun-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> BTC is ÀùaltÀù towards fiat and Àùthe thingÀù in terms of recognition.

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `If traceable coin with 10 minutes block time would appear today, it would be complete rubbish. `

[01-Jul-19 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> aha! for secure messaging app, there is really not much need for the blockchain, so nSPV is indeed a very good thing

[01-Jul-19 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> pirate's success has demonstrated the demand for privacy in payments. i assumed using nSPV would make hush even more portable/faster. privacy in messaging is likely another high demand market.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @ComputerGenie - MineHush.com Hello. That LooTz guy you spoke with on KMD channel 2 days ago... Pretending Àùwhat is that b*tch coinÀù... He pranked you. He sent coins few minutes prior to Coinexchange. He is just pretending not to know a thing.

[02-Jul-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Coins are from DEX. At airdrop time DEX was hundreds of USD and now he sold his airdrop at few cents. Count the selloff at 500 and 501 sats few hours ago. Amount is the same. https://www.coinexchange.io/market/BTCH/BTC BTCH might not be a world beater right now, but anyway... Weird people.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Lootz, some oldtimer you spoke with 2 days ago on KMD general...

[02-Jul-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `oldtimer`
he's younger than I am üò£

[02-Jul-19 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> He just made fun of all of you. he knew excictly what is BTCH, if he sent to Coinexchange prior talk.

[02-Jul-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> so he sold an airdrop that he didn't know how/why he had, what's your point?

[02-Jul-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Yes.

[02-Jul-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I don't know what are his intentions, but he is just pretending not to know a thing.

[02-Jul-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> there's a lot of people that don't know why they have a lot of asset coins

[02-Jul-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> But he knew BTCH is on Coinexchange before he knew what BTCH is...

[02-Jul-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> 99% of people that hold NINJA ask the same question "Wha't this NINJA coin and how did I get it"

[02-Jul-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> Knowing that it's a coin and seeing on <https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php> that you have some aren't the same thing

[02-Jul-19 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> But sending to exchange prior knowing a thing does take some research.

[02-Jul-19 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> errr no

[02-Jul-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Well, if you say so. However, check the timestamps and you will see.

[02-Jul-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> if you send me BTC, I'm not going to research it, I'm going to dump it

[02-Jul-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> You can sell BTC anywhere. BTCH has only one CEX. Well, in fact there is another BTCH on Livecoin I think...

[02-Jul-19 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> is there a moral to this or is this just "that guy that you know from one server and talked to on another server sold some coins that you don't care about"?

[02-Jul-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Sorry. Don't you know him? It looked so. Maybe you should ü§ú üò£ ü§õ  him.

[02-Jul-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> I know lootz from the pirate server
I commented as much on the KMD server
You're on about a coin that I never even liked and a conversation that I didn't actually pay any real attention to

[02-Jul-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Ok, fine.

[02-Jul-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763

[02-Jul-19 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Enjoy

[02-Jul-19 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> It pays to have buy orders sitting in case someone dumps. a few months back I bought a large chunk of hush when someone dumped at 1000 Sats

[02-Jul-19 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Nice.  Now you are the bag holder ;)

[02-Jul-19 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
