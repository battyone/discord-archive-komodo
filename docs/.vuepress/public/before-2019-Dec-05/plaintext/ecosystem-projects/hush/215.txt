[dscrd-hush] <pal> if Hush is decentralized, each person can promote it the way he wishes, right?

[09-Sep-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> sure

[09-Sep-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> if you want to spend 200$ to chill hush do it

[09-Sep-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> but if the "community" should pay for it, we should discuss it. Or shouldnt we?

[09-Sep-19 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> I will give it a try, and you guys will see. I only ask to provide me with some material and go through it with me. I will bear the cost. The money is on me

[09-Sep-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Maybe you can connect with our marketing guys and can work together

[09-Sep-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> we could mix it up. Not only crypto shillers....maybe we can include "alternative news" youtubers

[09-Sep-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Sea Watch and so one

[09-Sep-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> its rly a big issue in europe

[09-Sep-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> promotion video may work easier than you think, all you need to do is to tell people Pirate, Safe, Verus, Hush are all part of the KMD eco system, Hush is just as good as if not better than other coins in terms of community and development, so why it is not a million dollar coin, that is it as the first video, enough to get people interested to know more

[09-Sep-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> Just point to Github commits count and discord headcount will be enough already

[09-Sep-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Solistica> youtube videos are trash imo

[09-Sep-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Solistica> unless you find somebody who actually has an interest in it, poor advertising

[09-Sep-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Solistica> and most youtubers I've found via my experience advertising through them are greedy AF and don't know their actual value

[09-Sep-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> so it takes experience to know who are the good ones

[09-Sep-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Solistica> well just takes a lot of sifting through irrelevant channels. Finding somebody who actively discusses privacy coin topics and has that kind of community is your best bet, and that person when found may not even be willing to advertise a specific coin so as to not appear to have a bias. 

compared to finding somebody who is happy to advertising a coin they've never talked about on their channel and has a follower base of a bunch of bot accounts and fake views

[09-Sep-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> in my experience, tradeogre is the place where people look for small cap gem, also Pirate is listed there, better than cryptopia in my view, has anyone made an effort to get us listed there?

[09-Sep-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> it is free of charge by the way

[09-Sep-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I have seen many people suggest tradeogre.

[09-Sep-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> tradeogre is a non brainer, I managed twenty to thirty exchange listings in past 9 months, I know tradeogre is the place where second tier exchanges look for gems, especially after cryptopia shutdown, Stex and Crex has way too many ERC tokens and it is too time consuming to check them

[09-Sep-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> I expect a 5x with tradeogre, and if people discovered Hush on ogre, will be much more. I own Pirate and Safe too, I see no reason why Hush should be worth less

[09-Sep-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoCloaks> @Berg can you DM us?

[09-Sep-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Done and done üôÇ

[09-Sep-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @pal We would love to get on TradeOgre, If you need any information for listing requests send me a PM and I can set you up

[09-Sep-19 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <wang> Well everyone can apply for tradeogre if there will be enough applicants maybe they will try

[09-Sep-19 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <wang> I think the best idea is to find out how Pirate did it and we do the same

@thegrugq Obviously this doesn't meet a lot of needs for the people we both want to serve, but this shows a very interesting market segment needs, wants and is willing to pay for this stuff: https://t.co/YpuLknkmjL
I would rather pay you since I trust your #opsec more

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Before it was publicly released, a Googler friend let me hold hers, I got to touch an Android before it was publicly released üôÇ They made all the Googlers "dogfood" it and use it as their main phone for a while before releasing it. Pretty smart.

[10-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi calling it Finney is very smart marketing, and also a nice hat tip

[10-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the fact they know enough to market to me, makes me happy

[10-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
