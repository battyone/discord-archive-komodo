Just a reminder that @ElectricCoinCo is demanding $1.1M USD per month salary, but can't be bothered to respond or fix a $ZEC Denial-of-Service on their main network that costs less than your daily coffee habit.
Will #ZcashDevFund be used to fix this? https://t.co/rOgRYU1LVd

[dscrd-hush] <dogracer> wow "To be clear, the creator ... is not trying to use the protocol-level DoS for evil" is not a common statement.  Damn i love this edginess in the cryptosphere.

[26-Aug-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Aug-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @iceyballz : ```
$ ./hush-cli opreturn_burn
error code: -1
error message:
opreturn_burn burn_amount hexstring ( txfee )

Burn the specified amount of coins via OP_RETURN. Returns unsigned transaction raw hex that must then be signed via signrawtransaction and broadcast via sendrawtransaction rpc

Arguments:
1. "burn_amount"       (numeric, required) Amount of coins to burn.
2. "hexstring"         (string, required) Hex string to include in OP_RETURN data.
3. "txfee"             (numeric, optional, default=0.0001) Transaction fee.

Result:
  {
    "hex" : "hexstring",     (string) raw hex of transaction
  }

Examples:

Burn 10 coins with OP_RETURN data "deadbeef"
> hush-cli opreturn_burn "10" "deadbeef"
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "opreturn_burn", "params": ["10", "deadbeef"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:18031/

Burn 10 coins with OP_RETURN data "deadbeef" with 0.00005 txfee
> hush-cli opreturn_burn "10" "deadbeef" "0.00005"
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "opreturn_burn", "params": ["10", "deadbeef", 0.00005] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:18031/

[26-Aug-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is our brand-new opreturn RPC, have fun! Sorry for burning everybodies eyes out, but that is how the sausage is made!

[26-Aug-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> thanks to @Alright for making that RPC happen

[26-Aug-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we will use that RPC above to burn the 160,000K HUSH we plan to burn

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> nice nice nice

[26-Aug-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> @dukeleto did you release code for woodchipper or demonstrate it?

[26-Aug-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If Zcash would have just done the normal/right thing and done something/anything to mitigate the woodchipper, they wouldn't be in such a bad spot they are in now. Begging for $1.1M USD/month, and the network can be effectively stopped for $3/day

[26-Aug-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Aug-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> going to?

[26-Aug-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright wasn't planning on it, for various reasons

[26-Aug-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> I have a feeling most pools probably have mitigations in place already

[26-Aug-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> no thanks to ZEC

[26-Aug-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, most pools run non-standard ZEC patches

[26-Aug-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but GUIs, many of them, don't allow setting custom fees, because Zooko told everybody GUI wallets shouldn't do that

[26-Aug-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> did zcash address it at all?

[26-Aug-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Not in any way, completely ignored me

[26-Aug-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They told KMD to tell me to shut up, tho

[26-Aug-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD had to inform Zcash company that I was not employed by KMD

[26-Aug-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Any Zcash dev could do this

[26-Aug-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Any KMD dev

[26-Aug-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Most Zcash protocol coin devs could do it if they tried

[26-Aug-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's trivial

[26-Aug-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So I am kind of waiting to see if somebody else does it for funzies

[26-Aug-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> $1.1M USD per MONTH!!!!

[26-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's insane they ask for this, and ignore simple problems. And give what has been estimated to be ~$1M USD in ZEC to coinbase, for free marketing bullshit

[26-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @gigamesh thanks

[26-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ECC has never managed funds well, and they are just begging for more with no good reason now

[26-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> did you send a PR?

[26-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright maybe you should do it üôÇ

[26-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright I don't do free work for ECC + Zooko anymore

[26-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Maybe you should do it and pump hush

[26-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> not sure I care enough

[26-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> just curious to see if it works as described

[26-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have 18 commits in zcash.git, and then I stopped caring because I realized how corrupt the company is

[26-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> like it might work in theory and not in practice

[26-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> that's what I'm wondering

[26-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright i did create 1MB transactions on ZEC mainnet

[26-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which is how I found out ZEC pools run patched zec nodes

[26-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> 1 tx isn't a dos :troll:

[26-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i should have been able to make 2MB xtns

[26-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> as long as I pay the fees, pools will gladly accept the DoS

[26-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> How do I type that trollface?

[26-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright i appreciate your devil's advocateness üòâ

[26-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright the DoS is great for pools, they rake in fees

[26-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> troll face came out of the closet in HUSH discord?

[26-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Pools help the DoS

[26-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Very smart solo miners, maybe they would realize it's not in their interest

[26-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or maybe they don't care

[26-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because you can always hop to many other 200,9 networks

[26-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> I'm still skeptical as to whether it's a viable dos

[26-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> :troll:

[26-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `:troll:`

[26-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright now that is what I like to hear, a real challenge üòâ

[26-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> give me like $100k and I'll show you a true ZEC dos üòõ

[26-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You are right to question the exact cost of the DoS, my calculations go by the spec. Double the cost of my calculations to ensure all pools take in the xtn

[26-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> the one they introduced by design
