[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> What?!?

[03-Nov-19 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> SDL > Android

[03-Nov-19 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Yes!!!

[03-Nov-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yup

[03-Nov-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio has been kicking ass

[03-Nov-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 the SDL wallet basically connects to something very similar to ElectrumX, called `lightwalletd`

[03-Nov-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> zaddrs + memos are supported

[03-Nov-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's somewhat magical

[03-Nov-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> That's crazy

[03-Nov-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and SDL had "Dark Mode" before :SD:

[03-Nov-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i just added dark mode, will be in the next release

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Name is awesome. Short and powerful.

[03-Nov-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's good to remember where we have been, to know where we want to go

[03-Nov-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> pretty funny that another project stole her first submittion, `VEIL`

[03-Nov-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and that Hush turned down the name `Veil` for `Hush` instead üòè

[03-Nov-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Both are written in 4-letter formation, but HUSH is shorter to spell and means something related with coin's purpose.

[03-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Name is awesome and the logo is fine too. You can't miss with black-white combination.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> good question

[04-Nov-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We will be adding a web page to myhush.org that visually explains all our wallets

[04-Nov-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I drew a big picture recently, so I could understand myself

[04-Nov-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
