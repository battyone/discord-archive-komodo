[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Biz you will find those very interesting

[27-Oct-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> ```you cannot retroactively go look on an explorer with MW coins, you *must* be recording and if you are not, you don't have the data``` 

This is new to me

[27-Oct-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 read the first link above

[27-Oct-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the second gets way into the math, the first one is a very nice high level explanation

[27-Oct-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```
If this is indeed the case, i.e. transactions are just broadcasted as-is to the entire network, then the attacker can easily see the original transaction graph with just a single malicious node, and the later obfuscation in the block doesn't matter anymore.
```

[27-Oct-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> p2p layer is brutal for privacy coins

[27-Oct-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 in MW, there are no transactions

[27-Oct-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There are only Blocks

[27-Oct-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and Blocks basically can have lots of transactions in them, but they are all mixed together into one "unit"

[27-Oct-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> A Block, the transaction graph only exists in the p2p network

[27-Oct-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the tx graph does not exist on the blockchain

[27-Oct-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they call them "transaction kernels" i think, and you can add as many kernels to your Block as you want

[27-Oct-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> p2p messages pass these kernels around

[27-Oct-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and they make a block out of them

[27-Oct-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Dummy UXTOs ...nice

[27-Oct-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is why originally, ITM/metaverse stuff was not clear applied to MW

[27-Oct-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but, it does, because we can extract a tx graph. BUT, we can not do it retroactively

[27-Oct-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> obviously, the NSA+friends have been recording BEAM since their genblock

[27-Oct-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But if you wanted that data, where you gonna get it?

[27-Oct-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> We must start recording right now if we wanted it

[27-Oct-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 😅

[27-Oct-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the same applies to BTC

[27-Oct-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Biz> that is a very big strength of MW... but it is merely a tall fence really

[27-Oct-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> recording the BTC p2p layer can give you immense data

[27-Oct-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Shrimpy API lol... exchange tx history

[27-Oct-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is unavailable on explorers or even full nodes

[27-Oct-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> The exchanges themselves must have data

[27-Oct-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Bc traders need it for their bots

[27-Oct-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> such as "Which IP in the world broadcasted this txid FIRST?"

[27-Oct-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no, i am talking about de-anon, de-privatizing stuff

[27-Oct-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is what spooks do

[27-Oct-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> No graphs

[27-Oct-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if they want

[27-Oct-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they love graphs

[27-Oct-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Graphs, linkability and clustering

[27-Oct-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Biz i agree it's a tall fence for average attacker, but it's not much at all for nation-state adversaries

[27-Oct-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and if you know everything goes to shit when a Real Attacker is after you, why do anything at all?

[27-Oct-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> How about a dust attack?

[27-Oct-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> what about it?

[27-Oct-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> what do you mean by that term and in what context?

[27-Oct-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It has a lot of meanings

[27-Oct-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I mean sending a small amount of the same coin to multiple addresses

[27-Oct-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> To reveal several identities

[27-Oct-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Or within a block

[27-Oct-19 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Dust attacks exist in Monero and Zcash world and there are various kinds with different intentions

[27-Oct-19 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You can DoS with a dust attack, or you can de-anonymize

[27-Oct-19 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> dusting taddrs can reveal different things than dusting zaddrs, but it's all about extracting metadata

[27-Oct-19 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> MW transactions are in plaintext for the miners

China's state controlled television explaining the basics of "first ever blockchain application" #bitcoin $btc, and how a distributed ledger works

Imagine 1.3 billion people got to know bitcoin because state made an effort to explain how it works.

[27-Oct-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @pal that looks really bad, maybe corrupt wallet.dat

[27-Oct-19 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> I dont think so, because my wallet could start normally, just could not pass that bad block

[27-Oct-19 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> I got the image above only when I use bootstrap

[27-Oct-19 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> everything starts perfectly

[27-Oct-19 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> but if I use bootstrap, then error message

[27-Oct-19 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> also my wallet.dat has back up

[27-Oct-19 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> I used it to recover coins, without any problem before we had this bad block

[27-Oct-19 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @pal ok, you are probably right, and that sounds better. We will have a new binary soon that has no problems with that block

[27-Oct-19 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I know it's been a while, I ran into a lot of problems

[27-Oct-19 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but Hush 3.2.1 will be released soon, and then we will make binaries for all platforms

[27-Oct-19 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> by the way, I generated a new wallet dat, and tried with bootstrap, still the same thing

[27-Oct-19 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> so it has nothing to do with wallet.dat

[27-Oct-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> Good reading. I learned GitHub has a Wiki, and a fatal weakness of MW coins. I hope in the future, when there's some time, Duke can say something about DeepOnion coin.

[27-Oct-19 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> People are pumping Chinese coins now

[28-Oct-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @1112 i know it uses Zcash Protocol, but other than that, I know very little about DeepOnion

[28-Oct-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> It relies a lot on TOR

[28-Oct-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> The entire supply was airdropped over so many weeks.. It could've been over a years worth, I dont remember exactly

[28-Oct-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 i don't have a lot of respect for coins that "integrate Tor" as their main feature

[28-Oct-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Every single BTC fork has Tor options from BTC upstream

[28-Oct-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so a Zcash fork that "does Tor stuff" is like saying nothing at all

[28-Oct-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @1112 to be honest, my first reaction of DeepOnion was "This is a honeypot, lol"

[28-Oct-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Only people that do not understand anything would trust all the things DO says

[28-Oct-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I trust nothing any coin says, I only trust the code

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I know, we don't have mac/win binaries yet, because those come after we are more sure about lack-of-bugs. We are not persecuting you, it's just that making binaries for Mac+Win is a bigger pain 🙂

[28-Oct-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> With a little more testing, we will be at the time to make win/mac binaries

[28-Oct-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That means we can then make SilentDragon binaries, including SilentDragon, SilentDragonLite, SilentDragonSuperLite and SilentDragonAndroid(!)

[28-Oct-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so much goodness coming down the pipeline

[28-Oct-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Regnar plz tell me what you need for SDSuperLite, it sounds like you were basically done a long time ago and just kept adding cool features 🙂

[28-Oct-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Regnar> The nSPV wallet was mostly done by TonyL, I just added a bunch of features, however I broke some stuff (worked on windows but not on Linux, I think I resolved this now though, something about icon file types)
I will take a look at it as soon as I can and do some cleaning. Admittedly I've been pretty slammed with work so it kinda took a back seat. But I'll make sure to clean it up and get the code on Github

[28-Oct-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Regnar> @dukeleto ^^

[28-Oct-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Regnar if you can just send what you have to github, then i can play with it. you have done a lot of work already!
