[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That explorer is stopped at block 500,000 , so all the numbers are exactly correct, as they were used in the snapshot

[dscrd-hush] <Hember> @dukeleto I do not understand this question "are you able to compile your own daemon or do you require binaries?"... I don't know how to compile a daemon or what this binaries thing is. 😄 All I know that sometimes you need to first run daemon manually when using some wallet programs.

[11-Oct-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yes, considering that a lot of people are having issues with their wallet we’ll extend submissions 😊

[11-Oct-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We’ll extend it by a week or so, depending on when it’s solved

[11-Oct-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no mining pools or exchanges reported issues. it seems it was GUI wallet users that are most effected

[11-Oct-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a weird-ass bug

[11-Oct-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> No GUI here..

[11-Oct-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[11-Oct-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @scubapanda it has to do with the exact commit you were running, it seems. None of my servers were affected

[11-Oct-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> at least that is good, the Hush seed node listed in the `hushd` script did not crash. That would have been shitty

[11-Oct-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ORAMASAKS> 🤔 😦

[11-Oct-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> not sure you've seen my prev post @dukeleto what is your opinion on chances hushlist could be used to create a decentralized opt-in anonymouse twitter? far from that? I think it would be interesting to make monteziation like - each activiti cost some Hush dust like 0.0001 Hush to prevetn spamming in comments/likes and so... probably some interface would be needed to link messages, likes, comments, user profile? images could be put as links and displayed in a proper app or maybe even "explorers" online ?

[12-Oct-19 05:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> what twitter is missing is opt-in anonimity, freedom from censorship and decentralization

[12-Oct-19 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> at least it could be good start to be able to create anonymouse news channel visible in the online explorer if that is simple ?

[12-Oct-19 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> ah and one more think added - each time comment or like a post on hush twitter I pay 0.0001 dust it should got to the orig post - this way good content creators of interesting channels get rewarder

[12-Oct-19 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> could be huge, maybe better then steemit idea

[12-Oct-19 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763

[12-Oct-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am beginning to find time to work on the Hush DragonHead's again, I need to buy some HW in bulk and come up with a system to "image" a new Linux install with a bunch of Hush software. The goal is when you buy it, it's "plug-n-play" and you just give it some internet to sync back to 100%. It will have Hush + :SD: pre-installed

[12-Oct-19 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there will be no wallet.dat, that is created the first time you startup. We don't want to know your privkeys and never trust any kind of thing like this that comes with a pre-generated wallet.dat !!! Somebody could monitor the addresses constantly and sweep funds out at any time

[12-Oct-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am going to add a feature to :SD: which shows the time the wallet.dat was created in the `hushd` screen. That will make it easier for GUI users to verify the time the wallet.dat was generated, without using the command line
