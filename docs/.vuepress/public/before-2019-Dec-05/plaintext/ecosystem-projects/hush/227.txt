[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> with random amounts to each

[18-Sep-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so let say you send to 10,
I will not know anything until all 10 outputs are spend

[18-Sep-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> which is hard

[18-Sep-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> because one user will hodl

[18-Sep-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so I can not proof the 10 dependency

[18-Sep-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so if there is one output to a hodl address that is never spent, it seems to make it more difficult

[18-Sep-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> now I have 4 people never spend, which one is it link to, we will never know until one of the 4 spends it

[18-Sep-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> yes

[18-Sep-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so people doing atomic swaps will need a hodl address where some funds are sent to with each transaction

[18-Sep-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> maybe that is much simpler to implement and has a bigger deterrent effect

[18-Sep-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> since the note has no proofing, so all the others I attempt to associate will return invalid proof

[18-Sep-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> can just be 0.0001 sent to a hodl address with each transaction

[18-Sep-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> :shush:

[18-Sep-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> when will you publish something about your fantastic zcash deanonymizer?

[18-Sep-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i assume mimblewimble is childs play to deanon, since all the tx are in plaintext before it is mined

[18-Sep-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Soon, I trying to get a small setup and paper. Just to show the first 100k blocks(or 6 months data)
So people can actually improve upon the research and maybe even come up with better solutions.

[18-Sep-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I only get weekends to work on it

[18-Sep-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> it can be invalid or incorrect, but it something

[18-Sep-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> having actual percentages of each chain deanoymized would be very interesting, i assume DASH is not having any actual privacy

[18-Sep-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> XMR has 0 privacy lol

[18-Sep-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> DM me a PIRATE address, I will send you a donation

[18-Sep-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> oh, if XMR has 0% privacy, i guess PIRATE is the only hope for any actual privacy

[18-Sep-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> XMR you use elimination, there increase it to 12+ I think now. But the problem is I can inject on transaction, I will know my inputs and outputs. So the entire block can be easily reverse

[18-Sep-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> if my outputs > the rest in the current block, its simple task

[18-Sep-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> it was publish and spoken many times

[18-Sep-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> but XMR then decided to do something like bulletproofs to reduce xmr size which actually made it easier for elimination

[18-Sep-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> would be nice to see article showing how much effort/money/infrastructure is needed to deanonimize popular privacy protocols with examples and link to block explorers, so that nobody can say "not proven" + some resume for avg users so that they understand the implications of this

[18-Sep-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i think the implication is that only PIRATE has a chance of remaining private

[18-Sep-19 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> posted some of your talk on reddit here (wonder if XMR guys will answer that ) https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/d59dbw/what_monero_has_done_in_the_past_6_months/

[dscrd-hush] <ca333> `ITM made the first way to extract information out of ztransactions, even z->z !` excellent - i wasn't aware of his findings. Depending on the of extractable info we could probably utilize it to visualize the data for the less techincal crowd - i am sure many parties would find value in this. It would also be a great presentation on why PIRATE provides real privacy as opposed to hybrid implementations.

[18-Sep-19 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM @jl777c wow, that is a lot of amazing backlog I just read about de-anon techniques

[18-Sep-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ca333 the idea for the company Chainanalysis supposedly started because somebody was giving a talk about deanonymizing BTC and somebody in the audience said "I will pay for this, make it"

[18-Sep-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c what was said above, if it works, is the makings of a profitable company

[18-Sep-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Doing it at scale, doing it "right"

[18-Sep-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM you are now the first Hush Czar of Deanonymization

[18-Sep-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> beware now ECC got 1 more arg for new funding

[18-Sep-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have been thinking of how to fight-deanon stuff, and I think there are some pro-active things ARRR+HUSH can do. Activities which increase the cost and reduce the data quality in the de-anon process

[18-Sep-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> does these findings impact Hush encrypted msgs ?

[18-Sep-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c allowing z=>t with a single taddr output is probably the worst offender. If a user always adds dummy zaddr outputs, i.e. never do a z=>t with just a single taddr output, I think the analysis gets much harder if a user does that. I believe both of you touched on that above. Pirate doesn't allow z=>t normally, but I hear talk about swapping pirate, so something like that will be done.

[18-Sep-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã what we are talking about doesn't break the encryption of memo fields, but it does reduce the privacy of zaddrs

[18-Sep-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i dont think it matters much, the z->t and t->z just contaminates any involved zaddr, you need to treat it as a taddr level

[18-Sep-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it is so bad that even the zaddrs only involved in z->z are affected and i think if that is mitigated, it makes it acceptable

[18-Sep-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> only 1 additional 0.0001 z tx is enough or the more the better ?

[18-Sep-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The initial t=>z gives a lower bound of how much funds are in a zaddr, and then the attacker can gain more info with more metadata analysis

[18-Sep-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> only 1 is enough as far as i know, as long as that one is NEVER spent

[18-Sep-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> 1e-4 additional small deflation

[18-Sep-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> What ITM is saying, is that an attacker can do a simulation and extract, with high probability, information about zaddrs that should not be possible

[18-Sep-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> any spending tree can be tagged with amounts, if it is involved with taddr

[18-Sep-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, upper and lower bounds for the amount in each zaddr

[18-Sep-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so the spending graph is derivable. which without amounts is interesting, but doesnt divulge too much

[18-Sep-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> once you can tag a txid of having a specific amount, that amount can be traced through its spending graph

[18-Sep-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The spending graph can also be correlated to completely outside data, i.e somebody maybe mentioning on Twitter they bought something for a certain price

[18-Sep-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Not easy to automate, but still that is there

[18-Sep-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> nothing you do will mitigate the z->t, or the t->z, it is basically a known amount

[18-Sep-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Agree on that

[18-Sep-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so the critical thing is to have z->z that is after that, but with never spent outputs

[18-Sep-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that *is* quite critical

[18-Sep-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> for any chain other than PIRATE, it is not really mattering though as all other chains are basically deanonymized

[18-Sep-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and I don't think this is well-known

[18-Sep-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c well, on HUSH, we plan to extensively use amount=0 xtns, and I believe that will confuse amount analysis thoroughly. It doesn't change the spending graph

[18-Sep-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c we could actually have Pirate + Hush wallets act on this information, and make unspent zaddr outputs

[18-Sep-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> with rampant z-> t and t->z, it will very very hard to get any privacy at all

[18-Sep-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c we don't force z=>t=>z either

[18-Sep-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we inherited how KMD used to work

[18-Sep-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH really is quite similar to the old KMD with zaddrs

[18-Sep-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it seems not worth to fix for non-PIRATE chains as i dont see a way to mitigate the reverse proofing attack

[18-Sep-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> well, at least ITM is on our side

[18-Sep-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and Hush is a good playground to see what we can do against the "reverse-proofing attack"

[18-Sep-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> catching up...

[18-Sep-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c i am definitely thinking about giving some warnings to users in GUI wallets when they do a z=>t, explaining the metadata leakage. It's really not obvious to most users. And Hush SilentDragon has shielded change enabled by default

[18-Sep-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Small things, but better than nothing

[18-Sep-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @mrlynch it's a lot of backlog, good luck

[18-Sep-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c i have been thinking about how this really affects Hush, which is focused on communications and the memo field

[18-Sep-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> In that light, this deanon issue does not concern our main use case

[18-Sep-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> correct, but the spending graph will be revealed, so what address is talking to what address would be leaked...

[18-Sep-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i guess HUSH should mitigate also. add a 0.0001 output to a nonspendable zaddr to each ztx

[18-Sep-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c hmmm, always adding a 0.0001 output to yourself is a reasonable hack and doesn't burn money

[18-Sep-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> no, not to yourself as when it is spent, it is deanonymized

[18-Sep-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yeah, I get that, but on average, it will not be spent

[18-Sep-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's about breaking the analysis, on average

[18-Sep-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> people that maintain their wallet and consolidate funds, WILL spend all the zutxos

[18-Sep-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If Hush SilentDragon always sends an extra zaddr output of 0.0001 to myself, at least sometimes that will be unspent and break the analysis. Sometimes it won't. We could also tell the user "Do you want to burn an extra 0.0001 per transaction for extra privacy?"

[18-Sep-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but most people will just do the default

[18-Sep-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> yes, default to burning an extra 0.0001

[18-Sep-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that means after 10,000 * 21,000,000 xtns, there is no more Hush

[18-Sep-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have a fixed supply, not like KMD, where the above would be fine

[18-Sep-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we could burn a tinier amount, yes?

[18-Sep-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 1sat zaddr burns?

[18-Sep-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Who knew you had to destroy zfunds to make them safe, lol

[18-Sep-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sending to an unspendable address does not seem viable as a chain-wide default

[18-Sep-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> As an optional setting per-user, yes

[18-Sep-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but that doesn't really solve the problem

[18-Sep-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c this is a bit of a hack, but hear me out

[18-Sep-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Should this tx rly burn or just a long time unused is also OK?

[18-Sep-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If users could make an isolated wallet.dat, which holds these funds, they could be somewhat sure they don't accidentally spend them. So, users would make a wallet.dat, and get a zaddr from it. Then, their normal wallet sends little tiny output to that other wallet

[18-Sep-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That other wallet should not be used normally

[18-Sep-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Occasionally, it can be swept

[18-Sep-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it is at least a process to follow. Not very nice for users, but GUI wallets could help automate it

[18-Sep-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> as soon as it is spent, it can be traced

[18-Sep-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> on average
