[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have been seeing BTC/LN folks raving about them on twitter

[17-Aug-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have a dusty 2B looking for something to do üòÖ

[17-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoCloaks> We're probably some of them üòçü§£

[17-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoCloaks> Our Lightning Shells are one of most popular items.

[dscrd-hush] <CryptoCloaks> That is, until the dragon head üí™

[17-Aug-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> oh boy!

[17-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CryptoCloaks how does color option effect complexity? Would it be possible, say, to have 2 different color dragon heads for people to choose from?

[17-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I assume we will use a small number of colors, maybe 2 or 3. I assume each new color increases cost

[17-Aug-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoCloaks> If the entire head is one color then it will not effect it much. To keep things simple I'd stick with 2-3 colors that the entire unit could be printed in.

[17-Aug-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoCloaks> We'll keep the cost the same if you have 3 colors to choose from.

[17-Aug-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoCloaks> There are possibilities of makings multicolor cases, but that will add a large amount to the cost of the case. Example of multicolored,

[dscrd-hush] <CryptoCloaks> This is an open sourced case for a RPi4 we designed.

[17-Aug-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CryptoCloaks i am happy to keep it simple üôÇ

[17-Aug-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoCloaks> ü§ò sounds good

[17-Aug-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I would probably like a black SilentDragon, and we can come up with 2 other colors that people want

[17-Aug-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CryptoCloaks are you thinking of it being on a rectangular stand thing, or will the head rest by itself on a surface?

[17-Aug-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoCloaks> We think the design could be just the head to keep it authentic, but it really comes down to what you guys are wanting üôÇ

[17-Aug-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CryptoCloaks yes, i prefer just the head, sitting on my desk üòÖ

[17-Aug-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i assume the USB ports/cables will come out the back of the head area. That is going to look dope

[17-Aug-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoCloaks> Yeah we will plan for that!

[17-Aug-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The head will be staring at you on the desk, with the wires coming out the back. It's art and a full node!

[17-Aug-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CryptoCloaks you can say "Duke, that's pretty crazy, no lol" to this idea, but I want to get it off my brain üôÇ Is it possible to leave a tiny empty "hole" where the eyes are, such that in low-light conditions, the blinking lights inside the case will be visible thru the eye "sockets" ? üçø

[17-Aug-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It could be ventilation as well?

[17-Aug-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoCloaks> Not crazy, we can do that.

[17-Aug-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoCloaks> I gotta head out for awhile, time to hit up a winery and a tour.

[17-Aug-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There is nothing wrong with GPU mining, that is just not my jive. I mined Bitcoin with a GPU (and a bit with CPU), it holds a fond place in my heart ‚ô•

[17-Aug-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The cheaper your power, the more attractive GPU mining will be. Not really viable with expensive power costs

[17-Aug-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you have expensive power, you want to CPU + FPGA mine. Cheap power? GPU+ASIC
