[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Matthias it went down from 1.21% to 1.19%, so not much at all. We are still trying to get the word out. It could also be that most of those funds are from people years ago, that lost the wallet.dat, or are dead, or will never care to move their funds. It's hard to say how much of that is "lost" or just "hasn't been moved"

[24-Feb-19 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Matthias> @dukeleto true, makes you wonder how many of the funds in t-addr are also ‚Äúlost‚Äù.

[24-Feb-19 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> estimates are that something like 25% of BTC is "lost"

[24-Feb-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nobody really knows stat for HUSH, but we know people lose computers, hard drives fail, houses burn down, so the number of lost coins is definitely > 0, and a large % of those zaddrs could be "lost coins", we can never really know for sure

[26-Feb-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Feb-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> pretty much the same. Slightly higher by 0.23 HUSH

[26-Feb-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that could potentially be people attempting to play with sprout zaddrs and exploit the bug, but, at least to me, it is not evidence of exploitation. Why go to all that trouble to counterfeit 0.01 USD worth of HUSH?

[26-Feb-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c do you have an explanation of why we are seeing tiny increase in sprout funds? Maybe z->t change somehow? We follow upstream ZEC's coinbase-must-go-thru-shielded-pool rule, could that be related?

[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> Someone needing to use viewing key..

[26-Feb-19 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> is sprout tx disabled?

[26-Feb-19 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> Or is Sapling-T-Sprout impossible now? @dukeleto

[26-Feb-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c no, sprout xtns are still valid

[26-Feb-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if they weren't, all HUSH in zaddrs would be locked already. Currently 1.19% of supply

[26-Feb-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> then any usage of zaddr on HUSH would increase the supply

[26-Feb-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c i thought that t->z would increase that number, and z->t would decrease that number

[26-Feb-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> with z->z leaving it the same

[26-Feb-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is how I am calculating it, maybe it's just dead wrong: https://github.com/leto/Util/blob/master/bin/hush_stats#L22

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ` shielded_supply = gettxoutsetinfo.total_amount - getsnapshot.total` is what I am using

[26-Feb-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but i guess i am not taking into account new supply

[26-Feb-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> that is correct

[26-Feb-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> not sure if coinbase needs to be shielded

[26-Feb-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ok, i figured it was something like that. my estimate is not perfect, just an estimate

[27-Feb-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> any smart low-level Google sysadmin/SRE could write a cronjob to recognize seed phrases and auto-import them and sweep them. Most are probably too honest to do it, but it only takes one. Most likely, thousands of people have access to that data

[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Very sad for BTCH. For many of us, including developers, it would be better to receive a reward for POS. Project needs movement

[02-Mar-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Mar-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BLOCK 500,000 (~42 days from now) will be the Hush snapshot, onto our new KMD asset chain. Any funds left in zaddrs will be locked onto the original Hush chain.

[02-Mar-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Looks cool :), so am i understanding this correctly that after the fork Hush will become a kmd asset chain coin kind of like BTCH?

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes

[02-Mar-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Mar-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> I said one sentence in like a week. You really use "FUD" in your everyday vocabulary?

[02-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Eddy O yes, i do. It's a verb

[02-Mar-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> every free software and open source person is very familiar with FUD

[02-Mar-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt

[02-Mar-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I appreciate constructive criticism, but FUD, I don't

[02-Mar-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Put up bounties if money is the issue is constructive, imo. You asked my motivations... Ive been here over a year and have tried to contribute. Throwing out a GitHub link can only take the project so far. 

I think more important are your motivations. You're the only one in control and have been for over a year.

[02-Mar-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> That sounds very reasonable, switching from ZEC to KMD, KMD seems to be currently the better option of the two. And anything that KMD does in the future will now be ported over to Hush.

[02-Mar-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I wonder if KMD will highlight us in a Tech Tuesday sometime too üòè

[02-Mar-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Eddy O you seem confused. I already work for free, maybe you should put up bounties. Yes, you have thrown at ideas for a long time, but I have never seen any action from you

[02-Mar-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Eddy O my motivations are such that I care enough about Hush to not let it die of abandonment many months ago, and mostly I just hear from people like you that I don't do enough

[02-Mar-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> News flash, you don't do anything constructive.

[02-Mar-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> All this attention. I'm not used to it.

[02-Mar-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, I don't feel the need to update you on all the work I do behind the scenes, because, you don't pay me, nor does anybody else, to work on Hush. I do it because I want to see Hush succeed

[02-Mar-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> You're getting bounties to work on other projects. It's not unreasonable that system is used for hush

[02-Mar-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> " Throwing out a GitHub link can only take the project so far. " is just FUD, trying to belittle the VERY important fact of our github repo development tip changing

[02-Mar-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Those people have money to pay me, so I work for money

[02-Mar-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Eddy O I never assumed such. Mostly you seem like a customer that complains and buys nothing

[02-Mar-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I would rather fire you as a customer

[02-Mar-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you wanted a Hush foundation with corporate overlords, and then our paths split. Ever since then,  you seem to want to FUD on Hush. Just go find another coin to bother.

[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Working out will help your mental health, Duke. "Corporate overlands" lol.

Community voted improvements, paid for by bounties were your concerns. Proposal was not by me, but by many people- I just collected the ideas and supported them by saying I would fund the first bounties. Out of the 5 transactions I've made using hush blockchain, they have all been donations to the members of hush team, now gone. Only you remain from when I first bought hush.

[02-Mar-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @Eddy O please understand that Hush is in a transition process which will result in major new improvements. If you want to help out feel free- but keep it classy in the discord please ‚úåüèΩ

[02-Mar-19 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am working with various mining pools to make sure we can transition mining of HUSH smoothly  over to a new chain. Once a few pools have migrated and things stabilize, we will be set for exchanges to upgrade to the latest Hush chain and then re-enable trading. @Berg @RunningMantheCoin and others have been doing lots behind the scenes

[02-Mar-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> once we start the new chain, we will get a new KMD-based insight explorer, so it doesn't make sense to mess with our current insight explorer in the mean-time.
