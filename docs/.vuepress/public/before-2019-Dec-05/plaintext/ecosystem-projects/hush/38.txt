[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> looks like they left the server,  oh well. Hush itself never came with it's own whitepaper, but we probably should

This coupled with the facts that there are something like 20 Zcash source code forks and over 50 Monero/CryptoNote forks is why I am so excited about the future of privacy + cryptocoins. Not yet born coins will inherit the best features of both sides. https://t.co/ie7r68bE...

15 days later, the Cryptopia hack continues
After going dormant for many days following the $16 million heist, the Cryptopia hackers started up again today, siphoning an additional 1,675 ETH (worth about $180k at today's rates).

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```
Most of the funds are coming from mining pools. Presumably, these payments are being sent on behalf of miners who opted to receive their rewards automatically via "direct deposit," and have since forgotten about it.

[30-Jan-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Another reason to never mine to an exchange. Not sure these miners deserve the coins they think they mined. They are mining to an address they don't control

[30-Jan-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> They were even warned by Cryptopia not not use their exchange addresses to mine to. Geez.

"Never mine to an address for which you don't own the private key".
2 weeks after Cryptopia's hack, miners are still mining to the exchange + the attackers get free money for no extra work, since they stole the private keys + deleted Cryptopia's copy ü§£üôÉ

[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> Yes..but some of us maybe want to trade..for example exactly that day i move my hush from windows wallet to cryptopia to trade a little, and that day they put wallets into maintenance..and after that..this is what happend..shit

[30-Jan-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <admon> you can use another wallets like zelcore, never send Mining rewards to a exchange.

[30-Jan-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Roxin enable experimental settings, exit, restart. Hush will be there

[30-Jan-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have vague plans to basically make our own "skinned" version of Agama, where hush is enabled by default, and Hush+BTCH are highlighted with our own custom graphics/etc, still supporting all the stuff agama supports. we would need somebody to step up  to make such a thing

[30-Jan-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> FYI Mobile Agama also supports Hush, probably needs same experimental setting enabled

[30-Jan-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SHossain> Mobile Agama doesn't need Advanced feature to be activated

[30-Jan-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Jan-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Since you're here, I'm trying to change where i want the blockchain data to be downloaded for the swing wallet and the Datadir option in hush.conf doesn't seem to do anything for me, for example i type in 'datadir=D:\Hush' but it still starts downloading to 'AppData\Roaming\Hush'. Any advice or am i doing something wrong?

[30-Jan-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Maybe it needs to be in a different format?

[30-Jan-19 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 does the directory D:\Hush already exist and your user has permisions to write to it, if it does?

[01-Feb-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @heguli97 Problem is they stolen a lot of private keys and removed nearly all private keys. So recovery is extremely unlikely.

[01-Feb-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> I think that was an inside job...

[01-Feb-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Roxin Maybe, but I think most likely they never secure the eth server where the node was running.
- Either they never patch the server
- SSL login was guessed
- Bug in the code that allowed sql inject query to execute

Am still hoping for the first 2, if the 3rd one then we screwed. Since they never mention anything about how many keys was stolen and removed. well I written off the lost by buying cheap.
I lost  ~2000 stuck hush and had 5000 hush in sell trades and 0.02 with buy orders. Total of 7000hush + 0.02 btc. I refill supply at 1000 sats x 12000. so lost was less then $300.

[01-Feb-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I calculated my losses and i have around 6000 hush stuck on Cryptopia.

[02-Feb-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763

[02-Feb-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763

[02-Feb-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
