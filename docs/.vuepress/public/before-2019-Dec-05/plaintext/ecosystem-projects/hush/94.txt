[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> how much did you pay for it?

[23-May-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> one arm and one leg 😅

[23-May-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I paid $400 in BTC for this bot, and it seems to be worth it. I hope it makes tipping Hush community member super simple, and this is also how we will distribute some Cryptopia funds

[23-May-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> many other coins are using this platform, i checked it out and i was impressed

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 we hope not to spam this channel with bot stuff TOO MUCH, but since we just added it, we will be a bit spammy to show people

[23-May-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just the right amount of spam

[23-May-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can always DM to the bot, not sure we really need a channel for the commands

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 that 5 hush is for being a generally awesome person and helping the Hush community in various ways that I can't keep track of, thanks 👍

[23-May-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-May-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-May-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hmm, the currency unit is weird, it's "i"
