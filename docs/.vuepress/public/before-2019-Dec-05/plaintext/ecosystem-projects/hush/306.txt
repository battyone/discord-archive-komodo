[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> I drove a holden barina in australia, a pontiac solstice for a min here until my dad snatched it since he was the registree, and now this chevy aveo which is my first manual, and my first proper car. Like, that *I* own

[30-Nov-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Volvo's are so boring but indestructible

[30-Nov-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> I prefer this to the solstice, 2 seater convertable is p much unusable for me

[30-Nov-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> nice, man I wish petrol was as cheap in the Netherlands as here in Australia

[30-Nov-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Nov-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> if they'd just use the uranium up north they';d be self sufficient

[30-Nov-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Captain> idiotic

[30-Nov-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> my car can't send anything ðŸ˜›

[30-Nov-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I bet a Tesla could

[30-Nov-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> I got 5 packs of joes place collector camels, sealed in perfect condition, for about 38 AUD

[30-Nov-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> a pack of cowboy killers in Florida is like 8.50

[30-Nov-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> so maybe 11 AUD

[30-Nov-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> and thats on the pricey side, in a state with one of the highest tobaccy taxes

[30-Nov-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> yeah here it's so overpriced, just like alcohol... holy canoli it's crazy

[30-Nov-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> lmao cheapest is ruskov

[30-Nov-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> youre better off drinking mouthwash, unironically

[30-Nov-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> hahaha

[30-Nov-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> thats what I did when I was alcoholic mode

[30-Nov-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I don;t think that is really good to drink

[30-Nov-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> not that alcohol is good lol

[30-Nov-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> 27% abv, and look at the msds for all the ingrediants, its just ethanol, water, and tiny tiny concentrations of non-lethal stuff

[30-Nov-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> I could easily destroy 2litres of that at my peak

[30-Nov-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I just get some cheap goon:P

[30-Nov-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> each day big sad

[30-Nov-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> but also pricey here

[30-Nov-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> its expensive anywhere

[30-Nov-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> and it takes about 8 shots for me to feel any buzz, 12 or more to start showing that Im drunk, its just so expensive

[30-Nov-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> I can't really drink anymore

[30-Nov-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> I'm not a large person

[30-Nov-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Why cant you drink anymore?

[30-Nov-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> because It's really expensive for me

[30-Nov-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> and when I start I usually don't stop

[30-Nov-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> not that I get drunk, I just maintain a buzz indefinitely

[30-Nov-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> That's not good man

[30-Nov-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Don't make it a habbit. Alcohol addiciton is really fucked up

[30-Nov-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> too late, started and stopped multiple times. just the game man

[30-Nov-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> these camel collectors packs are epic

[30-Nov-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Can we move this to #off_topic

[30-Nov-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> yeah maybe better ðŸ˜›

[30-Nov-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Nov-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Nov-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> let's not try to paste any more ascii art here, discord will abuse it

[30-Nov-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We are getting super close to being on Google Play

[30-Nov-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> been working on it for days

[30-Nov-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gosh, Google has so many hoops to jump thru

[30-Nov-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I had to rate our app and answer lots of weird questions

[dscrd-hush] <Captain> pff, so annoying haha

[30-Nov-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so I wan't y'all to know, many wheels are turning

[30-Nov-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's hard to see from the outside, but they are

[30-Nov-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> soon we should be in the Play store, if i can jump thru all the hoops and get them screenshots they want

[30-Nov-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> currently screenshots are blocking us from being on Google Play

[30-Nov-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> so that's the only thing left to get on google play?

[30-Nov-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's the main blocker from getting our first release on Play

[30-Nov-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there are many things to do, but that is blocking us from our initial listing

[30-Nov-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> can't you exclude tablet support to get it on google play?

[30-Nov-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> if not that's quite weard
