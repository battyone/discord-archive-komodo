[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability you are right, to think, that it's not profitable to mine Hush and immediately resell right now. Hush is not a cash crop

[07-Jun-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is a fruit tree, that needs some care and love and then produces amazing things for a long time

[07-Jun-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Some pear trees are known to produce fruit for over 400 years. But they produced nothing for the first few years, some long-term-thinking people had to plant the tree and care for it for years, before ever seeing a return

[07-Jun-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Just something to think about.

[07-Jun-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I would rather Hush be a fruit tree than a cash crop.

[07-Jun-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And that means a stable price instead of crazy price spikes and volatility. We are slowing increasing the value of Hush, which is much healthier than marketing gimmicks without substance, that cause the price to crash after the buzz is over

[07-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> im mining on solar as well so sellingmy gpus and buying the a9 will actually reduce my energy costs

[07-Jun-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> Direct or battery-cycling ?

[07-Jun-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> Am looking to do the same, but finding a bit of conflicting info on base requirements for the hardware, in terms of the management of the setup

[07-Jun-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> and there's also the possibility of direct supply to the mining-machine

[07-Jun-19 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> My solar is connected to the grid

[07-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> supplementary supply only or batteries as well ?

[07-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> No battwry

[07-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> But I over produce

[07-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> Ah ok i see

[07-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Grid meters it back

[07-Jun-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Solar is good for miners

[07-Jun-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am sorry for a lot of Indian people, that could benefit from cryptocoins. Their government rightly sees that it would lose too much control, allowing it to be legal

[07-Jun-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```
‚Äúmine, generate, hold, sell, transfer, dispose, issue or deal in cryptocurrencies directly or indirectly.‚Äù
```

[07-Jun-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is draconian, it doesn't even allow for India people to be paid in fiat to work on cryptocoins, if I read correctly

[07-Jun-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they even made it illegal to dispose/destroy cryptocoins, kind of bizarre

[07-Jun-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> I think it's propaganda season..

[07-Jun-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> Following China's play perhaps.

[07-Jun-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That sounds about right

Analysis of the Paid Bloomberg Article reporting '10 years Jail for Crypto investors'

1. No source
2. Clickbait article that's kept Paid
3. Even if it is true, it's only a suggestion to govt, not official notice

I refuse to share the article link as it isn't worth promot...

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Good points. Hard to say if the India article is FUD. I assume most news stories are FUD, anyway

[07-Jun-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's interesting to know which direction the FUD is going, and who is saying it

[07-Jun-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> The channel is very alive now ... maybe we need an "offtopic" to complain about shitty days, recommend horrible music and do movie spoilers

[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> Oh okay, I've seen it

[07-Jun-19 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> I think general is off topic

[07-Jun-19 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> And the important stuff should be pinned to other channels

[07-Jun-19 10:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[08-Jun-19 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> :money_mouth: @RunningMantheCoin sent @franciscana23 **10.00 HUSH** (‚âà $0.63).

[08-Jun-19 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> many thanks @RunningMantheCoin for this support

[08-Jun-19 12:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiveBuddha> @dukeleto whats your % guesstimate on the hush ng completion?

[08-Jun-19 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiveBuddha> Also have we ported btch capabilities to Hush in the new Sapling update, primarily in terms of crpyto conditions?

[08-Jun-19 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @JiveBuddha hush-ng is retired and we're doing SilentDragon now, a fork from SevenSeas which is a fork of Zecwallet

[08-Jun-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mr_Billion> What programing language do I need to know to help design a new looking hush wallet?

[08-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Mr_Billion you don't need to know how to code to help with graphics, docs, translation, UI/UX and probably other things. Our main wallet, SilentDragon, is written in C++ and uses QT5 for graphics

[08-Jun-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mr_Billion> Ok thanks, I‚Äôll look into it. I want to be involved. What is the difference between the HUSHmate wallet and the SilentDragon?

[08-Jun-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSHmate is designed to replace the old HUSH-Swing wallet, basically a direct replacement, to make sure people had a GUI wallet when HUSH v3 mainnet launched

[08-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mr_Billion> Ok I‚Äôm looking for the silent dragon wallet now

[08-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSHmate is meant to be a basic wallet, and HushList features or other large features are not planned for it currently, it's meant to be a basic GUI full node wallet for people, and was our first windows wallet binary

[08-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SilentDragon is based on ZecWallet, and has many modern features

[08-Jun-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and we will put all our new HushList chat + file upload/download features into SilentDragon

[08-Jun-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SilentDragon is currently compile-only, no binaries yet

[08-Jun-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We are finalizing some branding, mostly. It has all the basic features for beta testers to use

[08-Jun-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Mr_Billion we need that to look less boring

[08-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mr_Billion> Yes I totally agree, the user experience is just as important as the technology behind the project.

[08-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mr_Billion> That‚Äôs why I was asking what software I needed to learn to help.

[08-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mr_Billion> Or if I can just creat mockups of layouts and someone else can make the adjustments

[08-Jun-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> mockups and graphics will be easier for you

[08-Jun-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> learning linux CLI and C++ to do that is not reasonable

[08-Jun-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> graphics and icons are most useful

[08-Jun-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> to make the UI less boring

[08-Jun-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> rendering the UI is actually writing a lot of code, so changing the way it looks is not easy

[08-Jun-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but tweaking colors or adding images is relatively simple

[08-Jun-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mr_Billion> Ok great, Ill get on it. where should i upload my suggestions?

[08-Jun-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> making a free github.com account is simple and easy

[08-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @dukeleto so hushMate or SilentDragon ?

[08-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jspook16> I was out of touch and I see hush migrated. I am trying to move my hush funds and get an error that says  my address is not a valid pub hush address. Do I need to do something to enable the new hush coins?

[08-Jun-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> @jspook16 See the pinned msgs in this channel, April 30 - How to claim your hush

[08-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> @Roxin  havent used either, but i say silentdragon

[08-Jun-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jspook16> Ok so where is this wif to wif tool in Agama desktop? Im using Verus Agama

[08-Jun-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jspook16> disregard

[08-Jun-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jspook16> I cant figure this out. The WIF to WIF tool returns the same  key

[08-Jun-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @jspook16 try set the coin to "Komodo", it should give out a different key

[08-Jun-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jspook16> trying that now

[08-Jun-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @Akira X and where you keep  your hush coins ?

[08-Jun-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jspook16> Ok I got a different key. I logged into verus_agama with that key. I see my balance but it still shows a t  address

[08-Jun-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> right now they are in verus agama 5.7

[08-Jun-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> what i found is that dexstats.info can help you keep track of all your coin in your addresses

[08-Jun-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> as long as you have your private key saved you are good
