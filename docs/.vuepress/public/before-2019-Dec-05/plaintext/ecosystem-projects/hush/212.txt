[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Berg Wow, 0.11 HUSH were sold at 0.08 USD/HUSH! 0.008 USD combined! Almost a whole cent! Time for FOMO!!!

[dscrd-hush] <denio> Can you put my 1k for the german translation in the winner pot for our Tournament? @dukeleto @Berg if we find not enough teams i will try it again in a month

[04-Sep-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules i hate that fact of "prices" not taking into account the size of the last order

[04-Sep-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the way the industry renders price is a tragedy

[04-Sep-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @dukeleto Yes. The reality is that with 100 or 1000 USD you are able to make or breake the whole price movement.

[04-Sep-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules i could play games with the FR money

[04-Sep-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> But that's why there are the candle charts. But smaller exchanges often don't use them properly.

[04-Sep-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but really, it would be a waste of time. Mine and all of yours. I want to see the real price of Hush.

[04-Sep-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The simple fact is any small investor with $1000 in BTC drastically change the price of HUSH

[04-Sep-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Yes, and that is a Àùdeath spiralÀù. Nobody wants to be first to overpay and that is why long-term the price is falling. Realisticly, now it is ideal time for HODLers. 2, 3, 5 cents, all these prices are excellent.

[04-Sep-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules agreed, it's hard to be the first believer

[04-Sep-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules my focus is improving Hush fundamentals, to make people *want* to buy Hush to *use* it

[04-Sep-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is what will make Hush price skyrocket

[04-Sep-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> right now, we don't have much buy pressure, only speculators

[04-Sep-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you can talk privately and upload files in a censorship-resistant way, and doing those things costs Hush, that is how we raise the price of Hush sustainably

[04-Sep-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So that is why the Android app and SD head are so important, to make things easy to use

[04-Sep-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> All the tech is there, it just needs to be made easy to use. Most coins/chains can't say that

[04-Sep-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They are wishing they had something and hoping you believe them when they make up roadmap items

[04-Sep-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> thanks Duke, so how do I set up a wallet to receive the tips?

[04-Sep-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @pal For small amount, you can use the webwallet at https://wallet.myhush.org

[dscrd-hush] <pal> I have it, now what to do next?

[04-Sep-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> another somewhat odd question, do we know the percentage of nationalities of team and community? I am not curious to know who is who, just the nationality composition to see if it is European or American or both

[04-Sep-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> I posed a question in wallet support by the way

[04-Sep-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @pal Both

[04-Sep-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @pal Now you send your HUSH to one of the 'R' addresses

[04-Sep-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @pal American, Canadian, European and various anon volunteers is my vague answer

[04-Sep-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763

[04-Sep-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763

[04-Sep-19 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @pal I suggest getting the private keys of each address with a balance, hopefully it's not many

[04-Sep-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> how can I do it? The only thing I have is the old wallet.dat, that is not enough to  recover the coins?

[04-Sep-19 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there are many ways to do things, some are easier than others

[04-Sep-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[04-Sep-19 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @pal You will certainly find your private key in the wallet.dat file.  Open it with a file editor like Notepad++ for example.

[04-Sep-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> thanks, I have only 500 Hush in old walelt, so it will not kill me, but it is important for me to verify that I can manage the tech, so please bear with me

[04-Sep-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> Notepad++  does not work

[04-Sep-19 08:18 PM] phm87#7395
Make a listunspent to see all addys with coins then make dumpprivkey on each Raddy. Do not share privkeys, keep them secret

[04-Sep-19 08:19 PM] phm87#7395
If there are too many, you should consolidate first, i.e. send all coins to 1 addy, wait for the tx to be confirmed then dumpprivkey

[04-Sep-19 08:20 PM] phm87#7395
Note: I know nearly nothing in Hush. The only Hush guy I know is @dukeleto (sorry to tag you buddy)

[04-Sep-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @pal Keep looking for a solution, do not give up your 500 HUSH.

[04-Sep-19 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @pal are you able to start up an old Hush wallet? That is how you can dump a private key. If you have it all in one or a few addresses, that is the best way

[04-Sep-19 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it doesn't need to sync, or download the chain. it hopefully should be able to let you dump a key. But I recognize all this ain't easy

[04-Sep-19 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @pal you should use your wallet.dat, the old one, with SilentDragon

[04-Sep-19 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> :SD: will make a brand new wallet.dat for you when it starts. Move that out of the way, and put your old wallet.dat in place, then restart and then go into the Advanced options and ask it to "rescan + reindex" if you still don't see your balance.

[04-Sep-19 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Best thing to do is send all your funds to a new wallet.dat, it's not good to use the old wallet.dat indefinitely. Just to sweep funds. And yes, none of this is easy

[04-Sep-19 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> feel free to ask more questions here

[04-Sep-19 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gilardh fyi wallet.dat is a binary format, it's actually a BerkeleyDB format database
