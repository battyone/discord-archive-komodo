[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @gigamesh Arguments & disagreements are healthy & common, in jobs like this.. it'd be best to embrace it or act like you didn't hear it, whichever one works best for you. I find it best to let guys get it out.. but that is me

[07-Aug-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It will seem bad, if you think that it is.

[07-Aug-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It happens

[07-Aug-19 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> whatever floats your boat, personally i will try and win people over with a smile and gentle push. if they get angry ill hold their hand and try to guide them, if they tell me to fuck i will broaden my smile, and walk away

[07-Aug-19 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> What i do know is that, projects will continue

[07-Aug-19 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Aug-19 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Ur work should be spot on regardless

[07-Aug-19 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I am sure I won't be disappointed ever

[07-Aug-19 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Devs will be devs üòÇ

[07-Aug-19 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ultimately different approaches may be complementary, and mostly reflect the depth of a community/family's passion

[07-Aug-19 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I love crypto & discord

[07-Aug-19 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Aug-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> guys adotpion needs either  internal money or external money sponsorship/partnership

[07-Aug-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> since there is no dev fund

[07-Aug-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> you won't do effective marketing campaign (paid adds, paid articles ... )

[07-Aug-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> because it costs

[07-Aug-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> so what can be done is search for privacy oriented partners

[07-Aug-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> or targeting specific group of people already privacy oriented

[07-Aug-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> so I will recall tor wiki once again üòÉ

[07-Aug-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> and some privacy messengers teams

[07-Aug-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> or VPN companies

[07-Aug-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> maybe even the big guy from MEga Upload or Pirate Party

[07-Aug-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> partnership brings not only money, but also hands with help, which maybe even better

[07-Aug-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> 1 dev is enough to write a useful app, but is not enough usually to sell the product (sell=gain adoption)

[07-Aug-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> so the mroe people, partners, interested external groups - the better

[07-Aug-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> and there is no other option since there is no fund, and will be no fund

[08-Aug-19 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> In the latest commits of SilentDragon/hush I have gotten rid of all requirements to download any files (from centralized websites run by Zcash) before syncing a full node! Infinite % more bandwidth efficient than all other Zcash Protocol coins now. So with the next release of SilentDragon, you will be able to download a binary zip file and then just start syncing directly. No weird errors about missing params, no downloading huge big files. This also greatly improves censorship-resistance.

[08-Aug-19 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Additionally this builds us closer so integrating into TAIL, to Tor operating system, since bandwidth is precious and Hush will need less bandwidth than any other Zcash protocol coin, by far, to operate

[08-Aug-19 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Thank you

[08-Aug-19 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If anybody is an active TAILS or Tor user, I would like to get some help testing SilentDragon in those use cases

[08-Aug-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @dukeleto Let me know Duke.

[08-Aug-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763

$HUSH just accomplished more firsts for $ZEC protocol coins:
* 1st to remove all Sprout downloads (1.6GB!)
* 1st to embed Sapling params directly in Git
* 1st to remove *ALL* downloads prior to syncing
If you use @torproject => massive bandwidth+time savings! https://t.co/...

Another project I am working on: 1st class stats about shielded transactions and payments on $HUSH (and all $KMD chains, such as $ARRR). This will power a simple website which can render continually-updating data about shielded xtns, with no external DB: https://t.co/p4BI0...

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi answer the question "How many shielded transactions today?"

[08-Aug-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "What % of transactions are shielded?"
