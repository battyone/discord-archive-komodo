[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @chunjae Have you done some transfer tests with a passphrase and a private key?

[03-Sep-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @dukeleto This little statistical information is very useful and gives us good information to set up the translations.  No need to know more.

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @chunjae I don't like the idea of â€‹â€‹generating an automatic passphrase.  This engine would use a word dictionary, that make the words less random and less secure.  That is my opinion.

[04-Sep-19 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I've never seen anybody post forms.office.com link, and I just don't trust that site to not do bad things. Office macros are a common hacking/malware vector. I try to avoid all windows/microsoft products (until they bought Github)

[04-Sep-19 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <pal> is there any channel I can buy Hush otc? Seem small volume on exchange

[04-Sep-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @pal we are in the process of getting enabled on KMD AtomicDEX, which allows p2p trades, but not sure it's working. Buying on Graviex is probably best, or paying NH/etc to mine Hush is even cheaper, but requires some knowledge

[04-Sep-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's also a good time to buy a used Innosilicon A9, just sayin'

[04-Sep-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763

*By September 5th Discordtip will be moved to a new account. Message me `ann` for more information.*

[04-Sep-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is the beginning of your bag

[04-Sep-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I'm interested in buying 50k or 100k HUSH for 200 sats. If anyone interested, DM me.

[04-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> And don't be so sure these prices will not come back. CEX orderbooks are very thin.

[04-Sep-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules you are best off buying on exchanges via a bot like many others

[04-Sep-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nobody gonna sell lots of Hush for under orderbook. You would need to offer 2-3X current price, at least. Nobody wanna sell

[04-Sep-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> My BTC is already waiting on a CEX. But I set an orders bellow 200 sats. Price on Graviex is artificially pumped and for 0.05 BTC equivalent of HUSH can be bellow 200 sats. Once in a while will some of the miners have to pay their electricity bills. I have a lots of time, but for the right amount of HUSH I am willing to buy higher.

[04-Sep-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules talk to @RunningMantheCoin via DM, maybe y'all can find a middle ground

[04-Sep-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Many people have approached us to buy large amounts of HUSH, and we have turned them all down

[04-Sep-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because we are playing the long game, and the price was not right

[04-Sep-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush team *is* interested to raise some BTC from HUSH FR, but nobody has wanted to pay a reasonable price

[04-Sep-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> For 200 Sats i would buy also 100-200k ðŸ˜‚

[04-Sep-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Many whales are coming around to sniff

[04-Sep-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I wouldn't sell any large amount of Hush for < 1k sat

[04-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> A tiny buy order will push current price to 1k sat

[04-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Jup

[04-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, a tiny sell from a miner could push us down

[04-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But look at the price of ZEC, and the drama in their community. People are looking for a new Zcash protocol coin to believe in

[04-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Potential upside of Hush is insane. Potential downside, is very small

[04-Sep-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> No, I am not buying team's HUSH. I am not saying it is a fair price if measuring the potential. But if take into account mining costs, one of the miners will eventually have to sell.

[04-Sep-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I am sure the team will not sell at these price. At least it shouldn't.

[04-Sep-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't think very large mining pools mine Hush, just small miners. They can extract the profits even with small volumes

[04-Sep-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules yes, finding a miner that wants to sell OTC is a good idea

[04-Sep-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> And FOMO is not my moto. I am patient.

[04-Sep-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The price of Hush seems stable right now because we have found roughly the cost of mining

[04-Sep-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And now miners see that if they wait to sell a few hours/days, they can get a better price. Some miners see that, anyway

[04-Sep-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Some miners dump into whatever the orderbook says

[04-Sep-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and since only small mining pools mine, we never see massive dumps

[04-Sep-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we don't have the exchange volume for those miners yet

[04-Sep-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if we see a big miner come, we will see a massive dump/selloff. But I think we will need more volume to see those things happen

[04-Sep-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Agree about the price, but there aren't any large buyers. All CEXes combined have probably 0.3 BTC into orderbooks. Maybe even less. And that includes 1 sats and simmilar prices.

[04-Sep-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules and that is more than ZCL according to WTM ðŸ˜‰

[04-Sep-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Do you suggest me to buy ZCL instead? ðŸ˜‰

[04-Sep-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules agreed, Hush is still mostly a miners coin. But this new dragon head and android app will change that

[04-Sep-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules never would I suggest anybody buy ZCL ðŸ˜‰

[04-Sep-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I know, just kidding...

[04-Sep-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and we will have better windows/mac binaries soon

[04-Sep-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I know many people don't have a good GUI binary for :SD: yet

[04-Sep-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just so much to work on, there is only 1 of me. Duke.clone() would be pretty cool

[04-Sep-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Reality is the prices of all coins are almost not related to their utility. In small POW coins it is mostly related to mining costs.

[04-Sep-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> If have to speculate,at this stage HUSH as company (which it is not) should be few millions USD. Lets say 5 million for 21 million coins (which, again, is pure speculation). That still leave me with confidence price will go up 10x at the very pesimistic scenario. realistic scenario is at least 50x. That's why I am saying price is undervaluated if measuring the utility, but mining cost is even lower than current price.

[04-Sep-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Only in a few places in this world in my opinion. If you want to mine here in Germany and would sell it directly on exchanges you have a heavy loss

[04-Sep-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Power costs for individuals are ~0,28â‚¬/kwh

[04-Sep-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> As big miner or with hosting service you can reduce it to ~0,13â‚¬

[04-Sep-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> But i was never a fan of hosting services.

[04-Sep-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> If a miner wants to make a loss, I will not go against him. But if no one is buying... One day they will have to pay their bills and i doubt they will pay them with HUSH.

[04-Sep-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Ofcourse! Nothing to say against your offer!

[04-Sep-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Oh. Does it mean you accept it?ðŸ˜‰

[04-Sep-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> If you want to sell for 200 sats ðŸ˜‰

[04-Sep-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> I have no miners anymore

[04-Sep-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Just buying

[04-Sep-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I've never mined, but looking to buy back. I'm also fine if that train leaves without me. I'm already holding BTCH bag. And guess what? BTCH is more expensive than HUSH. For more than 1 year has BTCH had one resistance and that was HUSH's price. Looks like that is about to change.

[04-Sep-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Before HUSH first halvening more than 1/2 of the maximum supply will be mined. I have a plenty of time...
