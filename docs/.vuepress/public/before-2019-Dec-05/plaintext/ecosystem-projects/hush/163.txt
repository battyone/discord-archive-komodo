[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Can u mine Hush cpu?

[26-Jul-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> you can but it is not profitable

[26-Jul-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> if that CPU was made on Alpha Centauri you can

[26-Jul-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> is the timeline bounty still valid?

[26-Jul-19 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> thx @heguli97 @Eldero

[26-Jul-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @gigamesh hey! I tried to message you but Discord isn't letting me because "we aren't on any mutual servers"

[26-Jul-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> There's a phrase that is repeated twice by mistake
"who left shortly after creating the project. In the beginning no notion of encrypted messaging existed in any road map  who left shortly after creating the project. In the beginning no notion of encrypted messaging existed in any roadmap."

[dscrd-hush] <D2D> I love this : "we can discuss with gusto its present and future developments."

[26-Jul-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> So Silent Dragon is a completely separate thing from Hushmate

[26-Jul-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Jul-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> I'm not on discord that much but been following HUSH since the end of 2017.

[26-Jul-19 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @Berg that only appears in the @Human Action version. Cant fix that one myself, need @Human Action to sort it

[26-Jul-19 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> the DailyChain version (which I can edit) doesnt have it

[26-Jul-19 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> dang! @D2D got almost as many tips for pointing out an error as i have for writing the review, lol

[26-Jul-19 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> And also the logo

[26-Jul-19 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> Thanks!

[26-Jul-19 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> The logo was picked from a contest we ran

[26-Jul-19 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Its definitely very fitting

[26-Jul-19 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> Ah wow I didn't know that

[26-Jul-19 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> Yes very cool

[26-Jul-19 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @DigitalniDizajn really knocked it out of the park

[26-Jul-19 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> Is that the designer who won the contest designing the logo?

[26-Jul-19 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> --
Are there any video interviews for Hush?

[26-Jul-19 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> I suggested to Naomi Brockwell (on Twitter) to do one, and she sounded interested but I haven't heard more about it. I actually suggested to do a show with Hush, ARRR and Veruscoin, to compare how they use privacy features

[26-Jul-19 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> yeah i saw that tweet just today üòÉ

[26-Jul-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> What aout vs zcash zencash monero as well

[26-Jul-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I'd like compare them vs larger cap coins

[26-Jul-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> Yes they should do a show comparing all of them. But Crypto Rich did a good one explaining at least ARRR vs for example Grin

[26-Jul-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> But I don't think he ever covered Hush

[26-Jul-19 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Yes it is @D2D. And that would be a great idea to have a video about Hush made

[26-Jul-19 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @Berg next time youll b able to DM me üòâ

[26-Jul-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Jul-19 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Human Action> I should‚Äôve invested some before I put out the interview lol!!!

[27-Jul-19 12:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> It will be interesting now as more.miners point at hush

[27-Jul-19 12:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> No more easy mining.

[27-Jul-19 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I think it's still incredibly cheap if you firmly believe in the featureset that hush provides

[27-Jul-19 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Especially if you compare the number of shares out there compared to pirate kmd zen zcash.  Etc etc rtc

[27-Jul-19 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Only 5 million coin out there
