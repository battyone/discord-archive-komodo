[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh zcash never once acknowledged that Sapling Woodchipper exists

[30-Sep-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and it can still DoS the entire network right now

[30-Sep-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for about $2/day, or double it and say $4 for a more realistic number that would totally obliterate Zcash mainnet

[30-Sep-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and people complain that I talk about this CVE, lol

[30-Sep-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash has CVE's coming out of it's bunghole, and ECC wants to keep them secret

[30-Sep-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh of course they knew, everything I write proves it

According to @dukeleto, a bug present in all #Zcash source code forks could leak metadataâ€”making it possible for IP address of the full nodesâ€™ with shielded addresses (#zaddr) to be found.
