They can also transact in bitcoin with each other or with Terrans simply by transmitting signed bitcoin transactions, though they‚Äôll have to wait up to 22 additional minutes for their signals to arrive at the center of hash on Earth.``

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ``Mining Bitcoin on Mars would be unprofitable because of the propagation delay, assuming Earth maintains hash power dominance. The Martian miners would have a view of the blockchain up to 22 minutes out of date, so by the time their latest mined block reaches the majority of hash power on Earth, on average there would be four new blocks added to the chain.``
