[19-Apr-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> if the WIF you got starts with a `U`, then you did it right

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> trying to keep up with  cryptocoin world really feels like "drinking from the firehose"

[19-Apr-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i have been writing this whitepaper for days, trying to give a synopsis of all this shite that has gone down

[19-Apr-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `trying to keep up with cryptocoin world really feels like "drinking from the firehose"`
That's my general feeling just trying to keep up with things inside the Komodo ecosystem, much less the whole space

[19-Apr-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> agreed

[19-Apr-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD is a microcosm of the bigger industry, and already, our microcosm has galaxies which i might never get to

[19-Apr-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> here I am going to be giving out a bunch of HUSH bounties today, so if you want to earn free HUSH for doing almost nothing, today is the day

[19-Apr-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Each person/address can only win 1 bounty today, attempts to game the system will be looked down upon greatly

[19-Apr-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I like 5 like jl777 likes 7's, so we will 5 HUSH bounties and some 55 HUSH bounties, maybe even 555 HUSH. I haven't decided, because I just make this up
