[20-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I consider Dash to have the best marketing strategies in the cryptocoin world, and I study them for Hush

[20-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then I tell @Berg to make magic happen

[20-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RK> Dash is doing best in this space

[20-Jun-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @franciscana23 We are interested about DASH adoption in Venezuela. Can you please tell us more about that?

[20-Jun-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> If that is true Dash and other cryptocurrencies are being widely used since it is a simpler way to make purchases since we have many problems to perform banking transactions

[20-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> If that is true?

[20-Jun-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> I do not know much about the use of Dash but what I can tell you that we rely a lot on cryptocurrencies and that they are already being widely used to obtain merchandise in different areas of the country and in different businesses. @halo kitty rules

[20-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Do you have inflation or devalvation? Don't you use cryptocurrencies to protect your savings?

[20-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> We have both Inflation and Devaluation and if the only way to save is with the cryptocurrency or with the dollars @halo kitty rules

[20-Jun-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> @dukeleto @Berg @halo kitty rules If they manage to implement these strategies in Hush it will be a pleasure to help them so that they can be used in Venezuela

[20-Jun-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @franciscana23 Thank you for your report.

[20-Jun-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> lots of videos showing DASH being used there and supported by various companies

[20-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So I have SilentDragon acting as a complete full node solution now, it will download EVERYTHING from scratch for you!

[20-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is going to be awesome and allow many more people to run full nodes, all from a GUI

[20-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and now without the 900MB sprout download, it's about 50% the download size, to sync a full node

[20-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's never been easier to sync a Hush full node

[20-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> currently you will need to download about 1GB to get fully synced. If you already have zcash or any other zcash coin on that computer, this is reduced to only about 350MB

[20-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> Will it force remove the old sprout-params :/?

[20-Jun-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> or is it not using the default zcashparams folder

[20-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @penguin good question, no it will not delete anything

[20-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @penguin it just does not download them for new nodes

[20-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @penguin same default params folder, shared with other coins/etc

[20-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !tip @penguin 5 hush

[20-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> üí∏ @dukeleto sent @penguin **5.00 HUSH** (‚âà $0.45).

[20-Jun-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> So it fully downloads params and syncs on its own now?

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg ya buddy

[20-Jun-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and doesn't have to download a damn 900MB sprout file, yay

[20-Jun-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> needs testing across Linux, mac, windows. we are getting really close

[20-Jun-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the above was tested on Ubuntu 19.04

$HUSH #SilentDragon is starting up smoothly with recent updates from our core development team. We are vigorously testing our product for release. Here‚Äôs a screenshot of SD downloading params, 900 MB less due to us eliminating the need for Sprout params.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> good tweet fine sir

[20-Jun-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg this is also good news for removing another 700MB download which is still currently necessary: https://twitter.com/dukeleto/status/1141704361883525120

@str4d @ebfull oh that is exciting! That would allow all $HUSH nodes to avoid downloading the 700MB groth16 param file and should also reduce the ECC CloudFront bill üòç
