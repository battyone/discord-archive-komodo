[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> those who had the average amount, get their coins

[17-May-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We had 31K unique addresses on chain, that is an upper bound to how many people lost funds

[17-May-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> those that have more dont get complete refund, but they can get more via promotion campaigns

[17-May-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i doubt anywhere near 31k people, most would be from new addresses from mining, and change

[17-May-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think that half of those are change addresses, and so I don't expect more than 10-15K people have a right to a claim. It gives us a data point

[17-May-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i would be very surprised if it is more than 1000 people

[17-May-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> ^ this

[17-May-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, I am just giving upper bounds. I agree with James

[17-May-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so get the tipbot setup

[17-May-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 420,000 HUSH spread across 1000 people is 420 HUSH each

[17-May-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> then we can just tip the people who are active in the community and pass the notsockpuppet test

[17-May-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> lol

[17-May-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if double the people show up, it's half that. If half show up, it's double that

[17-May-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> my point is/was that absent data from topia, there's nothing to verify that any claim wasn't dumped and claimant isn't being double paid

[17-May-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> exactly\

[17-May-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool agreed, there is no system to prove anything

[17-May-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So we will not use such a system

[17-May-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so not being a sockpuppet is a valid claim

[17-May-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> we assume everyone had coins at topia

[17-May-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> phone verified accounts, lockdown new ones

[17-May-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> ðŸ¤”

[17-May-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> 271 online now

[17-May-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there are ways to check the age of a discord account, i think

[17-May-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and last i checked we had around 2200 people on our server

[17-May-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> to be alive, they need to be active

[17-May-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, most of those 2200 users rarely join the server, but they signed up

[17-May-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> less than 300 online

[17-May-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> this is like the NEM initial giveaways

[17-May-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This system is far from perfect, but we find ourselves here. It seems like a way forward

[17-May-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> the market will dump

[17-May-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Markets do that, just look at binance re-opening

[17-May-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> we were making progressss

[17-May-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> if you're dumping a low supply coin at these sat values, you deserve to be poor, lol

[17-May-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Burning it all is the option if we want to make Hush price increase, at any cost

[17-May-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> lol

[17-May-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But is that really healthy for the community?

[17-May-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't know and I don't really want to dictate this

[17-May-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @JWolf (WW Clan leader) there is the balance of giving back something that was stolen, and preserving the current price of Hush

[17-May-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There is also the option to slowly give away the funds, to prevent the option of it all being sold at once

[17-May-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> true

[17-May-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or hybrid options where we burn some %, giveaway some %, or compensate miners some %

[17-May-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have many options, I think the best one will "present itself" when we see it

[17-May-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I also think that rewarding people for taking actions that help the Hush network is a very good use of funds

[17-May-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> Yeah we must maintain our integrity the market will reward...

[17-May-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's going to be impossible to make everybody happy

[17-May-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> right now, nobody is happy

[17-May-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> burn half

[17-May-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think we can at least make some people happy

[17-May-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> that makes the bonfire crowd half happy

[17-May-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> me2

[17-May-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> giveaway half

[17-May-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I do like to burn stuff

[17-May-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so we are talking about burning 210K Hush and giving away 210K Hush

[17-May-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> lol yeah

[17-May-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that turns out to be burning exactly 1% of our supply

[17-May-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> wow

[17-May-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto what was the premine in the original chain?

[17-May-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> lifetime supply

[17-May-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If supply + demand math really works, that could very much have an effect on our price, in a good way. Is there any precedent for a coin doing something like this @jl777c ?

[17-May-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> thats why I like the mining idea

[17-May-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM it was 160,000 HUSH

[17-May-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> isnt it more like 3% of current supply

[17-May-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c i am talking total supply

[17-May-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> many coins have done burns

[17-May-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a much higher % of circulating supply

[17-May-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Burning half should help Hush price, it makes it a lot more rare

[17-May-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto I think burn 160 000 and say 0 premined. the rest I feel auction it at a higher price and that fund be use for exchanges. Distributing among users will result in clone accounts and base on faucet experience 90% are clone accounts.

[17-May-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> but 21mill is like a standard...

[17-May-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 21M would still be our supply, but we would have a provably smaller circulating supply

[17-May-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> ok

[17-May-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Right now, we have a provably smaller circulating supply which is 71,000 coins less, because Sprout coins are locked onto the old Hush v2 chain

[17-May-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> I like the 420 Idea lol jk

[17-May-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> stoner

[17-May-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I would love to put it to a vote, but i think any vote would most likely be gamed as well

[17-May-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> 4sure

[17-May-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> hybrid  is best

[17-May-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto Can always have votes via mining power. More blocks mine = more votes. Mining coinbase addresses not registered in the registry is not accounted for.

[17-May-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _likes the idea of being able to sway that vote however he likes_

[17-May-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> CG has too many asics for me to like that @ITM ðŸ˜‰

[17-May-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> its will be average of over 10000 blocks.
- We create a website that has all voting options
- A pool or solo miner selects all the options he wants his coinbase address to support.
- Verification he needs to send 0.001 hush from coinbase address to the address specified for verification. Plus sign a message for Audit.
- A list of all pools and there voting will be display. Now users can decide which pool to mine.
just an option.

[17-May-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM while what you describe is technically possible, it's a massive amount of work to setup, manage, maintain, etc

[17-May-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> also if he puts all the effort into mining all 10000 blocks, the price will double ðŸ˜€

[17-May-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Of all the things I have hear, burn half + giveaway half to discord/twitter/etc seems the most "pragmatic"

[17-May-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Burning half counterbalances the gaming and dumping caused by the giveaway

[17-May-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The giveaway puts some HUSH back in peoples bags, increasing our community, to counterbalance the burn

[17-May-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Just a burn or just a giveaway have a lot of negatives

[17-May-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> we should mine half to slow it down...

[17-May-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `also if he puts all the effort into mining all 10000 blocks, the price will double`
I don't see the last bit happening, but if you think I'm above mining at a loss to make a point then we've clearly not been properly introduced to one another ðŸ˜›

[17-May-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool I know its not feasible in terms of cost. If the difficulty is 3x, I'm 100% buying coins instead of mining.

[17-May-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> I dont think it would

[17-May-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `I know its not feasible in terms of cost.`
Care to share that crystal ball that predicts future prices?

[17-May-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we need a CG emoji

[17-May-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> mining is voting...

[17-May-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> but not many are miners

[17-May-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> doesnt seem right to give all the voting power to miners

[17-May-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> some of the oldest people I know are miners

[17-May-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> i was a miner but not anymore

[17-May-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> lol so is buying...

[17-May-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> go figure

[17-May-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> ```JWolf (WW Clan leader)Today at 11:44 AM
mining is voting...```
CSW would be so proud....
