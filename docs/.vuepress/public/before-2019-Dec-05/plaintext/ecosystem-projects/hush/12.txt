[dscrd-hush] <Mimmo> 🎊

[21-Sep-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Maybe a tad bit less transparency on the Hush logo 😛

[21-Sep-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Either that or my brightness is way too low on these shitty monitors

[21-Sep-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I dropped it from 10 percent to 8, with 6% it looked way too dark on my monitor

[21-Sep-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I meant the other way 😉

[21-Sep-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I can't see it at all

[21-Sep-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Would you be able to read the text fine at like 20%?

[21-Sep-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Oh sorryy 😂

[21-Sep-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Ahahaha no worries, I appreciate you for doing this for me 😃

[21-Sep-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I realllyyyy need to re-subscribe for PS

[21-Sep-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Either that or just put up and deal with gimp 😢

[21-Sep-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> we do need a #graphics channel if we are going to be doing more of these kinds of things

[21-Sep-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It would be awesome for marketing to have some graphics at the ready.

[21-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I can make the channel for us to use going forward, if we plan on offering bounties or if community members are willing to contribute some 😃

[21-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Anyway here's 20%

[21-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> There we go ❤

[21-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> No more requests 😃

[21-Sep-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Now lets hope that Cryptopia doesn't SLEEP FOR TEN DAYS before getting us back online

[21-Sep-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Cool 👍 I'll save the .psd in case of emergency :thinkaboutit:

[21-Sep-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I reached out to them a few hours ago, but I wouldn't hold your breath about them putting us online any time soon 😃

[21-Sep-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I've saved the file posted here as well, but no guarantees I don't lose it 🤔

[21-Sep-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> :thonking:

[21-Sep-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> But this was good practice for me, i rarely use ps

[21-Sep-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <paia> expect few days without cryptopia

[21-Sep-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah, I'd say at least 48 hours

[21-Sep-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm also trying to get a fast-track contact for them

[21-Sep-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> For when we try to have them upgrade to the latest Hush, since that should be up and running very soon

[21-Sep-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Where exchanges will need to update

[21-Sep-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Best not to have to submit a ticket and wait for three days

[21-Sep-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> what about their discord? could you get an answer from there quicker? it's a possibility

[21-Sep-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Good thought, do you have an invite page?

[21-Sep-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> i can send you an invite

[21-Sep-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> 👍

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> https://discord.gg/4KeHMke

[21-Sep-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I proactively reached out to CoinRoom to make sure they don't have the same happen to them, and let them know we'll have an update coming soon that they'll need to take action on

[21-Sep-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I gotta head off now 👋

[21-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> 👋

[21-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Just reached out to Cryptopia via Discord, hopefully this yields a faster response time 😃 I'm assuming people moderating Cryptopia's chat have a better ability to get us in touch with someone fast 😃

[21-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @Trystaero Nerf Meepo?

[21-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Trystaero> Huh?

[21-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Wait, it's not Meepo, that's Dota...

[21-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Trystaero> Oh haha

[21-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I was trying to make a LoL joke,

[21-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Trystaero> talking about legue

[21-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But I'm a Dota player...

[21-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Trystaero> Never played dota

[21-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Who do they want to nerf always? ahaha

[21-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Trystaero> Yasuo

[21-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Toomi?

[21-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Something like that?

[21-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Trystaero> teemo

[21-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Trystaero> ?

[21-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yes!

[21-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Man, it has been so long since I've played.

[21-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Trystaero> He is a little PITA

[21-Sep-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah, I remember that from back when I played

[21-Sep-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Been a few years 😦

[21-Sep-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> am i correct in assuming that the hush price on coinmarketcap is incorrect?

[21-Sep-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> is this attributed to the double spend attack?

[21-Sep-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> must be. showing 1800 SAT on trade satoshi

[21-Sep-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yes, looks like CoinRoom got hit with it...

[21-Sep-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Wish they'd look at my outreach emaillll 🤷

[21-Sep-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> if coinroom got hit with it then why did cryptopia suspend trading

[21-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Cryptopia caught it early.

[21-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> ah gotcha

[21-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> just when i wanted to buy more hush!

[21-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> haha

[21-Sep-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I just bought more hush 😦

[21-Sep-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> And now it's all trapped on Cryptopia

[21-Sep-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Further motivation for me to light a fire under them 😉

[21-Sep-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> I bellieve in your fire lighting abilities berg 💪

[21-Sep-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> do you find that it takes cryptopia whilte to process btc deposits or is that just me?

[21-Sep-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> i find its typicaly 2-3x as long as other exchanges

[21-Sep-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spuddyminer> So did  @Berg make the pump single handedly? Up 270%

[21-Sep-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah, I deposited BTC the other day, took like two and a half hours to confirm

[21-Sep-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @Spuddyminer IT WAS I, MWUAHAHAHA

[21-Sep-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> You meddling kids

[21-Sep-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spuddyminer> 👌 :thinkaboutit:

[21-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spuddyminer> That hush is fast tho. Hush is quick af.

[21-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spuddyminer> I sold some bitmain coupon for hush. Best trade ever.

[21-Sep-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MrWrong> there is no active orders on coinroom

[21-Sep-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MrWrong> this pump is just illisuion 😃

[22-Sep-18 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> I noticed this spike this morning 22/9/2018 around 0700 AEST. When you click on the "Markets" tab the exchange that pumped up the overall price of Hush was Coinroom. Pairing was Hush/PLN.

[22-Sep-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Low liquidity currently, Cryptopia has momentarily suspended trading

[22-Sep-18 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> @Pixelised this is how you make a smart pump - select small volume exchange (easy to push price) and if other exchanges follow - on the other you sell (big volumes) -> Result is you buy using small volumes and sell using big volumes = you gain

[22-Sep-18 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> ofcourse it's always risky

[22-Sep-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> I downloaded Hush wallet from the webpage and it contain 2 trojan viruses ???

[22-Sep-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> almost all cryptocoin-related stuff gets marked as virus/malware from virus places, since there are so many things that do that

[22-Sep-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Art0077 you have a screenshot and the URL of what you downloaded?

[22-Sep-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <fireatwil> anyone know why trading is paused on cryptopia?
