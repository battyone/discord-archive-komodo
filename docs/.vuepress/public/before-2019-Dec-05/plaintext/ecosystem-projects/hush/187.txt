[dscrd-hush] <ITM> he had 5000 sats -> 2500 sats -> 500 sats -> now dump below 300sats.

[12-Aug-19 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> How did you find him?

[12-Aug-19 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Order book analysis, same order amount

[12-Aug-19 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I need to send to z address

[12-Aug-19 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Before :)

[12-Aug-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Nice page

[12-Aug-19 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Can you find the address that increased by that amount as well?

[12-Aug-19 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @AkiraX I have lot data on hush, never really analyse it much.

[12-Aug-19 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I have a program running on azure to analyse wallet address of exchanges, miners and dumpers.

[12-Aug-19 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so I tell it predict where this funds went.

[12-Aug-19 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> 95% xmr prediction accurancy.

[12-Aug-19 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> hush I have the data just not fully process it

[12-Aug-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> my database keep tracks on 9 pools, each address, the hush rate and even which exchange it goes to

[12-Aug-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> in the start I know when hush will dump(when 2 miners was online) and where it will dump.

[12-Aug-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> So far on zcash I finding a lot of metadata

[12-Aug-19 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> So when a user sends from zaddress to a zaddress to a zaddress.
I can eliminate the middle zaddress easily now.

[12-Aug-19 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM wow, this is very advanced stuff you have

[12-Aug-19 10:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto there a huge difference in privacy and encryption. ARRR privacy they fooling themselve, Hushlist on the other hand its encrypted messages, that cannot be broken.

[12-Aug-19 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> So with zcash, 
I have 10000 zcash transactions. now I eliminate one random one which leave 9999. now if it fails the proof, it means that the one or more of the 9999 depends on the 1 transactions. I repeat the process(Of coarse using mesh analyses to speed up everything)

Now I was able to proof that address t-Address -> ZAddress -> Zaddress -> T-Address was indeed true.
Sending from t-address to a Zaddress to t-address some how you cannot detect using eliminate proof method ðŸ˜¦

[12-Aug-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> t-Address (T1)-> ZAddress ->(t2) Zaddress ->(t3) T-Address
Now eliminating t2 means the proof will fail for t3.  I am not convince its 100%. since if t2 is not there how will t3 be valid.
So I studying sapling proof algorithm as distinct equations.

[12-Aug-19 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> now I need  t-Address (Tx1)->  Zaddress ->(Tx2) T-Address proof to be valid, if tx1 is not there tx2 should fail.

[12-Aug-19 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM are you looking at repeated nullifiers in shielded transactions?

[12-Aug-19 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> not sure what it called. I just reply the transactions or don't reply the transaction on a duplicate block chain(Difficulty set to true each block)

[12-Aug-19 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> yes that what am looking at, well kind off.

[12-Aug-19 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> those people did a massive study of all ZEC miners

[12-Aug-19 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and basically de-anonymized all ZEC miners

[12-Aug-19 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You cannot mine Zcash privately

[12-Aug-19 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> When you mine ZEC via a pool, you spread metadata in all directions

[12-Aug-19 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that links your future zaddr funds to the taddr funds that you mined in a pool

[12-Aug-19 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They can even predict how many GPUs and of what kind a miner has

[12-Aug-19 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Many scary things

[12-Aug-19 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> All the above problems apply to all Zcash protocol coins, which is why a future upgrade to allow mining DIRECTLY to a zaddr is so important

[12-Aug-19 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> yes, that will make it extremely difficulty or nearly impossible to trace.

[12-Aug-19 10:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Being a solo miner gives you a lot of privacy

[12-Aug-19 10:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Being a pooled miner, you lose a lot of privacy

[12-Aug-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Sounds like I'm in the right place

[12-Aug-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> No. I have sold any

[12-Aug-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> If you mined privately.  How can you not be worried about trusted setip

[12-Aug-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> What if someone's finds out how to print this indefinitely

[13-Aug-19 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> anything is possible. Nobody has exploited the original Sprout vuln in the wild yet

[13-Aug-19 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> i guess yuor stats thing you talked about will reveeal that

[13-Aug-19 01:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nope, it's not for that

[13-Aug-19 01:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> my stats thing is to study how much shielded transactions are being used (various kinds) and also "payments", where 1 transaction can have more than one "payment"

[13-Aug-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> When a mining pools pays out 20 miners in one transaction, that is 1 transaction and 20 payments

[13-Aug-19 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Let me explain why Sapling is "provably more secure" than Sprout ever was

[13-Aug-19 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's never been written in a way average people can understand, that I know

[13-Aug-19 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The code for Sprout had a deeeeeep bug. They made an optimization, they did something for speed, in the code

[13-Aug-19 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They had mathematical proofs of the security of the system, but those proofs did not apply to the version of code with the optimization

[13-Aug-19 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And so, their speedup broke the security of the entire system

[13-Aug-19 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sapling has math proofs about the security of things, and you can be sure they learned the lesson of your code not matching the stuff your math is about. Sapling is also designed much better, the internals of it are "simple". The internals of Sprout are very very complex, because it wasn't designed well. That is what made it use so much CPU and RAM

[13-Aug-19 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So the proofs about Sapling are smaller and you can think of that as a smaller "attack surface" if you are into infosec terminology

[13-Aug-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> @ITM in ARRR z->t is not allowed, so how does your analysis work with ARRR?

[13-Aug-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> all the mining pools payout to zaddr for ARRR

[13-Aug-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so your statement "ARRR privacy they fooling themselve" appears to be more "ZEC privacy they fooling themselve"

[13-Aug-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> what you are doing is similar to: https://cryptolux.org/images/d/d9/Zcash.pdf

[13-Aug-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> to my knowledge ARRR privacy is not compromised by this as there are no taddrs that funds exit through

[13-Aug-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> ARRR was specifically designed to avoid such analysis, so if you are able to analyze ARRR in any meaninful way, this is big news

[13-Aug-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @jl777c 
you can use notes in the proof.
so a Z-Address to[tx1] Z-Address to[tx2] Z-Address.................[txn] Z-Address
You can proof that Z-Address tx1 went to tx3 or txn using the notes as proofs. (The cause of this is coinbase address is public address)
So you could link a Z-Address to a list transactions. I not saying ARRR doesn't have privacy but saying the best privacy is fooling themselves. If they don't mine to a Z-Address it defeats privacy.
Secondly ARRR is too risky, Let say sapling has the same flaw as sprout(counterfeit bug), you cannot hardfork it as easily.

[13-Aug-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> did you miss the point that all ARRR mining pools payout to zaddr?

[13-Aug-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> we do depend on zcash tech to not have horrible exploits. but ALL privacy protocols have had horrible exploits in the past, to say ARRR is too risky, but what privacy tech doesnt have the technical risk?

[13-Aug-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> yes, I agree :).

[13-Aug-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> anyway, i do not see how your analysis is breaking the ARRR privacy. can you explain in more details how you can track "notes as proofs" in a chain of purely z->z->z tx without any taddr

[13-Aug-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> can you tell if someone spends the output of a specific z transaction?

[13-Aug-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> if so, a dust attack would work on zcash and this is giant news that zcash can be deanonymized

[13-Aug-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so i send you some coins (somehow I found out your zaddr). i know the txid. but how can i tell when you spend it?

[13-Aug-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> and if you dont know my zaddr, then it seems even if you can do the above, you cant even start the dust attack

[13-Aug-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> lets say pool creates a transaction(tx) to send to z-address - Transaction is recorded in a pool(no notes are created yet)
Now I create 2 clone blockchains(Same parameters, just set the difficulty to override)
Now let assume Z-Address user now sends it to a another  z-address (Transactions - tx2)
in blockchain I reply the proof to submit tx2 without tx1, if successful it means the tx1 note was not needed.
Now to proof it its indeed false. it means tx1 depends on tx2. 

Now sample set might be wrong since tx1 note , tx2 note with all the other tx notes need to be hash or something, then my small program will be incorrect, hence I setting up a bigger sample set(1000 - > 1 million).

[13-Aug-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @jl777c I might be totally wrong ðŸ˜ƒ

[13-Aug-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so I just using the ZCash double spend feature to do the above

[13-Aug-19 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> not sure i understand how you can find out anything about the actual destination address or amounts
if what you say is possible, to make a modified chain with some proofs removed, to determine a dependency chain, then with things all in z -> z, you can just find that some z transactions depend on prior z transactions

[13-Aug-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> without any analysis, this is already known, so you need to be able to extract the actual address and amounts for any new info to be obtained

[13-Aug-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i guess, other than some address has X amount of activity

[13-Aug-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> but i thought the proofs are encrypted, so you cant tell the contents of the proof

[13-Aug-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> the amount and actual address is not possible. 
At this moment, All I can proof is z-Address depends on a z-address transaction(Yes that is known, I just doing the whole I must also have it), so I can tell if Z-Address spend some coins(even 1 sat coins) but I will not know the amount yet, but am working on it. I do have a theory on how you could determine the amount. Its research phase still.

[13-Aug-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so if I send an amount of zcash to all exchanges, if the transaction depends on my z-address address output, I can know the amount is less then my amount I send and that a good start.

[13-Aug-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> now if I withdraw, I will know z-address had > x amount of zcash

[13-Aug-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so am getting the program to that state at the moment to tell me more or less

[13-Aug-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> isolated mode at the moment, I will test it on ARRR when 1000 goes through and I have a blockchain with enough data

[13-Aug-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> the nice thing I like ARRR we have a good play ground to test Z-Address ðŸ˜ƒ

[13-Aug-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c i think he is finding linkability data of zaddr nullifiers. The nullifier of a zaddr is a unique number on the blockchain that identifies a zaddr

[13-Aug-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> For example, when Ycash forked from Zcash, if you spend zaddrs on YEC, you leak your nullifier

[13-Aug-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So people can track your zaddr funds across ZEC + YEC

[13-Aug-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not quote "track your funds"

[13-Aug-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but they can say "this owner of this zaddr here, they also did this over here"

[13-Aug-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> With enough of those heuristics, you can start to use the pigeon hole principle

[13-Aug-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or things like it, to infer data

[13-Aug-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle`

[13-Aug-19 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i.e.: If there are only 5 possible transactions to look at, and I throw out 4 for some reason, I know that last one is you
