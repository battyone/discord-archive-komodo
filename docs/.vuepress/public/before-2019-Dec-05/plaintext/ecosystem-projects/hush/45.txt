[dscrd-hush] <Matthias> ...assuming those languages are interesting enough.

[02-Mar-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> If someone could translate Russian, that would be very helpful

[02-Mar-19 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> So we confirmed that Hush will 100% be a KMD asset chain?

[02-Mar-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> because if its a KMD asset chain there are 100's project that way ahead. 0 innovation = 0 value.

[02-Mar-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I can create my own KMD asset chain, start from scratch, 0 premine, have 1000 block reward for first year to catchup and after 1 year the coin will still be worth way more then hush will be 😅

[02-Mar-19 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM feel free to create your own AC. Hush is a fork of KMD, and I have the freedom to modify anything I want. Also, I am a core dev of KMD and can modify things that I want in that codebase. So basically, your argument doesn't hold water

[02-Mar-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> using an asset chain allows me to focus on the real purpose of Hush, which is HushList protocols and applications that use it. Making HUSH a KMD AC makes everything more efficient. Anybody that doesn't see it that way is free to disagree, but I don't see those same people working thousands of hours to get things to compile correctly/etc

[02-Mar-19 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i have written a huge amount of code in KMD that never went into HUSH. Now with HUSH being a KMD AC, all that code I wrote is coming back home, and we also benefit from ALL the code jl777 writes. If you don't understand the value of that, I can't help you.

[02-Mar-19 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM you are free to use the legacy Hush chain, nobody is turning it off, if you don't think KMD AC's are innovative

[02-Mar-19 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I understand, yes I agree there no dev that actually spends 1000's hours on the project. The move is great in terms of you being a core dev of KMD and maintenance wise its worth it, but the goal of Hush from the actual devs was way different. I respect your decision and hope hush have a better future.
As a investor its cheaper for me to hire a team to create KMD AC from scratch and even implement HushList then me investing into Hush. But as innovation there already 10's of project that did it already. So its not adding anything to the ecosystem and its just a clone project.

[03-Mar-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MrWrong> @dukeleto as a developer i totally agree with you. To focus on hushlist protocols wisely decision rather than maintaince hush network.

[03-Mar-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <c0prhd> Is there anywhere to sell hush?

[03-Mar-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto No one blames you and no one demands quick results from you. We understand that you work for free. I offered to make fork Hush in which the developer’s remuneration would be provided for, just do it, nobody will mind. You did not express any opinion on this matter and were silent, say so, say: Yes, my team and I will work for a reward from each unit. What is the problem with this? As for the BTCH. Like many BTCH holders, I bought even more coins in anticipation of a POS reward. Your team has a big deposit BTCH, why delay the process? You do not need money? Do not all businesses immediately bring money, or do you not see the prospect of earning money from POS? Why am I asking about BTCH? You yourself wrote that by Q1 the Verus algorithm will be launched. Note no one forced you to write about it. OK, POS is missing. Write about this, sorry guys POS BTCH is postponed because I am busy with HUSH, but you are silent and do not tell until you ask. Therefore, we worry.
And the last question. Fork HUSH provides for a change in the mining algorithm?

[03-Mar-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am waiting for stuff to compile, so here I am again

[03-Mar-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Hello duke

[03-Mar-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal when I wrote about BTCH and verushash, that was before the Zcash Sprout Inflation CVE was publicly known. Everything has changed since then. Upgrading to Sapling became number 1 priority for HUSH

[03-Mar-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, verushash has FPGAs now, again

[03-Mar-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> VerusHash V2 is dominated by FGPAs

[03-Mar-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> For my part, I started translating the Sapling ad.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So I don't want to hear about how I am spreading FUD about VRSC, I just report the fact ma'am

[03-Mar-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Your work too. @dukeleto

[03-Mar-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BlackMiner F1 series supports VRSC v2. I will now stop talking about it, because I am focused on HUSH

[03-Mar-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If somebody comes forward and says "I want to help BTCH along Duke, what can I do?", I will point them in the right direction. But with currently only me doing backend dev stuff, HUSH takes priority right now

[03-Mar-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTCH already has Sapling, so HUSH is trying to catch up there

[03-Mar-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> soon, both HUSH + BTCH will be first-class supported coins in Agama, and you wont' need to enable Advanced/etc that is a real annoyance

[03-Mar-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and that includes desktop and mobile agama

[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @ITM pleas explain how it would be cheaper to hire devs to create you a KMD asset chain then it is to buy Hush. What a load of nonsense

[03-Mar-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Hush is 5 cents USD. Developers are upwards of $100/hour IF you can find them

[03-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Becoming a KMD AC has insanely huge benefits & with Duke already being a KMD core dev the move over to the KMD ecosystem makes total sense. It’s a major time saver for things we need done & moreover we will have tons of new features with KMD

[03-Mar-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Yes it has future

[03-Mar-19 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jast> What is better to buy hush or btch?

[04-Mar-19 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @RunningMantheCoin , to create KMD AC takes about 6 hours, and the supply start from scratch. This includes nodes setup and stuff. Now hushlist there alternative, all open source. Flavour the protocol and that it. My point was if we go KMD AC there is 0 innovative, it worth 0, only when the hushlist is implemented then its worth something. For now its just Vaporware.

[04-Mar-19 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @RunningMantheCoin why have hush when we can rather spend the time only on KMD.

[04-Mar-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @RunningMantheCoin There nothing unique about hush beside all the vaporware for the past 1 year also, also the goal was 0 dev fees oppose to zcash, it better just to kill the project.

[04-Mar-19 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> I don’t understand the assumption that all KMD ACs are worth 0. That is equivalent to saying all Eth projects are worthless as well. Your logic does not make sense. Most projects are forked off of pre-existing blockchains

[04-Mar-19 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> There are steps that need to be taken in order to concentrate on the GUI release of HushNG. These steps have been taken because of issues like the Cryptopia Hack, the ZCash Vulnerability & the fact that the person who runs this projects is also a core dev of KMD. Not to mention as a KMD AC we will inherit huge benefits of that ecosystem. This in turn will allow Duke to concentrate on Hush more. It is a win-win-win. Wins all across the board 🤘🏽

[04-Mar-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @RunningMantheCoin Ethereum are d-app, ICO and many many more. The clones are worthless since they depend on Ethereum changes to survive. Anything dependent is better to invest in the parent then the clone. I invested in KMD which payout 40% of returns, covered up all my money I invested in Hush + $500 profit, I cashout since KMD is dependent on BTC(dPOW) and centralize(notary nodes). Anyways good luck with your project.

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Wow

[04-Mar-19 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Mar-19 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> anyways am out, the original dev never believed in hush, its pointless even being in this channel. 
😅

[04-Mar-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> It’s called trading not investing..yet you refer to yourself in above posts as an investor. No worries, you can cause FUD in a different discord!

[04-Mar-19 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> One question is if hush and btch are both kmd asset chains.  What differences would they have?

[04-Mar-19 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Btch was supposed to use crypto conditions. But if hush gets it first.   Than what value has one over the other.

[04-Mar-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jast> then, time of hush will always have less value than kmd

[04-Mar-19 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @dukeleto.  There is no need to explain anything.  You should have your community managers do it.  It’s probably better so there is less arguing between the community and you

[04-Mar-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> As you have stated.  You are communicating to build community trust.  And that is good.  But perhaps you need to have other people do it so you can focus on the work at hand.

[04-Mar-19 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> The original chain will stay where it is, it's just that exchanges, pools and (most)users will start using the new chain forked from komodo

[04-Mar-19 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> People are still free to use the legacy Hush chain if they choose to, nobody is turning it off.

[04-Mar-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @ITM#7678   I don't see how it's any different from how we are currently a zcash fork than being a kmd asset chain. Hush will still have its own independent chain and it won't be much more dependent on kmd than it is now, the only difference being that we'll be a kmd "fork" instead of a zcash one which in my opinion is much more valuable to Hush.

[04-Mar-19 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> So the old Hush chain will become Hush Classic? 😉

[04-Mar-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <nicklikestuna> Good question - what are the names (will the differentiate)? Will the max supply be the same on the new chain?

[04-Mar-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The old chain is essentially an unsupported API. @nicklikestuna yes, supply and block reward will be same on the new chain

[04-Mar-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If anybody cares to maintain an old/insecure Sprout chain where somebody will come along and print infinite free money one day, be my guest. It can be used for research/experimentation purposes, but the old chain will no longer be connected to the financial value of the HUSH ticker

[04-Mar-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @admon this attempts to explain it all in one place https://myhush.org/sapling/

[04-Mar-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am sure many people will feel like ITM, hopefully they will all see themselves to the door. Ain't got time for people that don't realize migrating to a KMD AC is the only thing that will keep Hush alive, and that it's an extremely strategic way to upgrade to Sapling/cryptoconditions and other things. Sure are a lot of people that like to complain about free work

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so now KMD, and the new HUSH AC will have FULL dpowconfs support, in all RPCs! No current coin has all this stuff, because I found these bugs, and fixed them in KMD first. I don't need to port them to Hush, DOUBLING MY WORK, because Hush is becoming an AC. HUSH + KMD will be the bleeding edge of new DPoW features and bug fixes

[04-Mar-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if people want to say that using a KMC AC makes us "worthless",  it doesn't even make sense. We will be a KMD fork *and* asset chain. Hush will have total control to change what we want from KMD, and also benefit from all of KMD's work.  It will be so much better than our old situation of seeing things go into KMD that I want, and needing to do lots of manual merging/porting to bring the code over.

[04-Mar-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And I want to clarify, HUSH will be a fork of KMD, but we are not trying to compete with KMD. HUSH is focused on communications, where KMD's goal is really to be an ETH replacement. Making HUSH an AC is like having our research lab in the center of a bustling university of professors and students, instead of having our research lab in the middle of the nowhere, working alone.  It's the difference of camping next to the river so you can drink water whenever you want, instead of walking 10 miles each way for a sip of water.

[04-Mar-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @SDG Agama desktop and mobile will support the new HUSH and we will have our own dedicated GUI wallet as well.  Not sure currently whether that will be based on hush-ng/SWING/QT, but we will have multiple GUI wallets

[04-Mar-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SDG> I'm using SWING wallet now

[04-Mar-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SDG> Do I need to transfer my HUSH to agama?

[04-Mar-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> As long as you don't have funds in addresses starting with `zc`, then you will be able to claim your funds on the new chain. Shielded addresses cannot be airdropped/transported to the new chain.

[04-Mar-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Consider the current HUSH v2 network to be an API that we will drop support for, as soon as HUSH v3 is alive

[04-Mar-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the process of converting to our new chain, is quite similar to the BTCH airdrop, except now I have many tools that will make it take less time, such as `getsnapshot` RPC

[04-Mar-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Your private key will unlock your funds on the new chain, just like with BTCH. You own your private keys, we never know them nor do we want to.

[04-Mar-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Shielded zaddrs cannot be transported *precisely* because they are private!!! They are doing what they are supposed to do.

[04-Mar-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I would never have planned to remove support for Sprout like this, but with an inflation bug looming, this is our best course of action. The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry

[04-Mar-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> All the data on the Hush v2 network is "secure" in the sense that it is encrypted, no one's privacy has been diminished.  That will continue even when it becomes "unsupported" when we upgrade to v3

[04-Mar-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but the financial value of sprout zaddr funds will become 0/unknown, because they are susceptible to having evil people print as much money in zaddrs as they want. Locking all sprout zaddr funds after block 500,000 closes the hole, so an attacker cannot transfer those funds to the new chain

[dscrd-hush] <NaturalCoin--Macro-Pool.com> Good question. Also, once the update is completed I'm assuming TradeSatoshi maintenance will be completed? And the update will be posted in the announcement channel?
