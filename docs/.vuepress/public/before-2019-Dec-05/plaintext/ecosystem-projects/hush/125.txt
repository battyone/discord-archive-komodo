[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @ITM both are with same address..and both starts with R

[19-Jun-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Roxin So both are exactly the same address?

[19-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> both might work. Could be they added Hush twice, because we are so nice

[19-Jun-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @ITM yes..both are exactly sams address

[19-Jun-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @dukeleto 😄😄  haha 😂😂

[19-Jun-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Roxin Just backup your key on both and use the one you want :). you be fine. Soon Duke will release the dragon 😃

[19-Jun-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Robert Garcia that seems fair, you sure the coin was not 51% attacked?

[19-Jun-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Robert Garcia> okay, pretty ,,,,,,,,and what's ur analysis for the dumped colx amount tracked by definite Txid links if this coin is garbage and get 51% network attack 😎

[19-Jun-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Robert Garcia how many coin did TS sell?
Supply is 11,290,346,689, it is also possible they had 1% holding?
So you saying 27,196,221.0 / 11290346689  was sold? That's 0.2%

[19-Jun-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Robert Garcia They might have manipulated and sold they holding quick. Then announce the delisting. But how many coins was the users coins that was stolen?

[19-Jun-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Robert Garcia> pretty, i think you stand aside with the TS, and the article showing the full theft clearly

[19-Jun-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Robert Garcia> it's your own vision!

[19-Jun-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Robert Garcia I don't stand on anyone side. I believe you with TS dirty practice of banning users on twitter and discord. I just trying to understand how they came to that conclusion since 0.2% might be a whale. If the funds of a user was stolen that a real concern. I lost lot of money in Cryptopia. After that any exchange is suspicious. The report not exactly stating how much TS stolen, Yes the fees of withdrawal is a bad practise. Like KNT withdrawal fees is high and that not fair. I still advice people to get out as fast as possible. I have 0 holding in TS. I only traded hush there and that too small value of $200 max.

[19-Jun-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> The report only stats bad practice and a dump.

[19-Jun-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Robert Garcia> and those 2 snot a full accuse  that garbage ?

[19-Jun-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Robert Garcia they valid claims.

[19-Jun-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Robert Garcia> really i can't reach what the final conclusion you wanna reach , 2 lines not  third , you agree to their suspicious acts or you feel it normally

[19-Jun-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Robert Garcia> but they don't dumped that colx amount from their own holdings,

[19-Jun-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Robert Garcia> all of these customers and traders disabled from withdraw the colx amount due to the high fee they always set during delist any coins

[19-Jun-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Robert Garcia> that not a satisfactory reason !

[19-Jun-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Robert Garcia> what 's problems with Bitradio, you mentioned? i traded and mine it normally on BTCPOP AND CREX24

[19-Jun-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Robert Garcia The practice of TS doing that was years. Its just surprising that the team listed the coin in the exchange after knowing they scam practices. 
I love CREX24, Bitradio 10 coins is fair, not great but fair. Crex24 support was always great.

[19-Jun-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Robert Garcia> the majority of delisted coins they delist , their blockchain working , just the communities refused to cooperate within scamming people they trust that communities with TS criminals

[19-Jun-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Robert Garcia> that the point mate and hope you got my point

[19-Jun-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Robert Garcia I understand the point. I hope your'll get justice and I hope guys on hush withdraw there coins as soon as it comes online.

[19-Jun-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Robert Garcia> 👌 🙂

[19-Jun-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Robert Garcia> I think Hush team is take awareness now against that suspicious and shady activities, we should learn from previous lessons i think , and that awareness already within Hush Family Here 🤠

[19-Jun-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> After cryptopia, Yes, hush team diversified exchanges plus I feel we way stronger then what we were. More exchanges, better codebase, more dev, more pools and even double contribution from community. 51% attack resistance and lot more.

[19-Jun-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and a new GUI wallet release Soon!

[19-Jun-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763

$HUSH is the FIRST Zcash-world coin to remove the need for every single full node to download ~900MB of Sprout params, since we have none of those transactions in our chain!

Also dropped a PR to @PirateChain which is in development:
