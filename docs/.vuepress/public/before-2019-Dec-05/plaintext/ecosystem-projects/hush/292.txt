[dscrd-hush] <denio> this is the point

[20-Nov-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> they have broke the system

[20-Nov-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yup

[20-Nov-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> makes a lot of shitcoins look honest

[20-Nov-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are in a global recession

[20-Nov-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> yes

[20-Nov-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most average people havent' felt it yet

[20-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> and the next crisis i fear

[20-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's so new, it's only hurt businesses and governments and banks

[20-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> cause we have the highest highst of all times

[20-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and hasn't filtered to the small mom+pop stores

[20-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> what comes since 100 years after this?

[20-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> the lowest lowst

[20-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> many indicators are similar to the 2008 housing crisis in the US

[20-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> they are still doing the same

[20-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's just different kind of debt that is defaulting

[20-Nov-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this time, it's even more important debt

[20-Nov-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's central bank debt and government debt

[20-Nov-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> instead of subprime mortgages

[20-Nov-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> private banks were very smart

[20-Nov-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> very evil and smart

[20-Nov-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the average worker paid for their bailouts

[20-Nov-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> why pay for debts if the ppl can do it

[20-Nov-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> yes

[20-Nov-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> i hope it gets not to ugly...cause we germans tend to take over our neigbhors if its get rly ugly for us :troll:

[20-Nov-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gosh

[20-Nov-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> well, i am sure there are some smart Germans that are divesting their EUR for BTC and other currencies that will have more value in the future üôÇ

[20-Nov-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> What is next, is some lucky individuals able to get a loan for a home with a negative interest rate, will become very well off in their lifetime

[20-Nov-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> People will rush to get those rates and then they will shoot back up, allowing people to rent their home for the mortgage cost, taxes and profit

[20-Nov-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> This time around,  those that give up their homes, will not be given a second chance. This will not be a 2008 repeat

[20-Nov-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I dont see Germany or see France, or Argentina or the United States anymore. I see people like me, getting screwed over by people in charge.

[20-Nov-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yup

[20-Nov-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Denio and Gilardh, same as me

[20-Nov-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> German or American, those names are used to incite emotion

[20-Nov-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I'm for all, or for none. A functioning global body,  or no govts at all.

[20-Nov-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Negative interest rates.. wtf

[20-Nov-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 imagine all the people in China with "bad social credit" and how appealing the idea of privacy coins must be

[20-Nov-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> these are average people

[20-Nov-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have seen documentaries, where there are tens of millions of people, that were born outside of the offiical "One Child Policy", and have no official papers

[20-Nov-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they have a NULL social credit

[20-Nov-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and cannot do so many things, it's like created an "untouchables" class

[21-Nov-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[21-Nov-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is a lot of orderbook buy pressure at 7500, if we go below that, gosh

[21-Nov-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are going low

[21-Nov-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> down to the 5000's perhaps

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's like the world is waking up to realize privacy is one of the last valuable things corporations and governments can monetize, that they haven't stolen from the people yet

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> How can we make Hush more accessible to people without stable internet access?

[21-Nov-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not an easy thing, but worth thinking about. I want to support all use cases we can. It's possible to store a transaction in a QR code, and receive it off-line, then verify it later when you have internet, and submit to the network. There are some ways to do things without internet, but we have no GUIs or documentation about it.

[21-Nov-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> We can make Hush more accessible to those without stable internet access in a few ways.

[21-Nov-19 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> The issue is, even if they could get it, how would they use it?

[21-Nov-19 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> One, sending it by phone number.

[21-Nov-19 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Two, incentivizing people to run internet relays and create a mesh network.

[21-Nov-19 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Three, make small  $25 beeper like messaging devices, to use HushMessenger

[21-Nov-19 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> A bitcoin atm operates to where it can shoot out a paper, with a private & public address with a QR Code. Then you load money & it goes to the address and you import it later

[21-Nov-19 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Can we make that a remote process?

[21-Nov-19 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
