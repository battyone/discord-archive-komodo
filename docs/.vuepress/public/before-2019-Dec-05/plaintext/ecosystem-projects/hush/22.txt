[20-Nov-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <daanoontjeh> Alot of people dropped their coins, meaning we are almost out of panic sellers and what not. All that is left after that are the people that will hodl, use and buy coins. Thats a solid foundation to build on.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cryptographic and we are planning to upgrade to Sapling, just waiting for the dust to settle

[20-Nov-18 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> ok thanks.  and can someone ELI5 what is BTCH.   does it replace HUSH?  or a separate project ?

[21-Nov-18 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> BTCH doesn't replace Hush. It's a separate project. From the website "BTCH is not something that has ever existed before, it is not a chain split nor code fork of HUSH, 
nor ZEC, nor BTC, it is a KMD asset chain with imported UTXO dataset. "

[21-Nov-18 04:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ectrader> even it doesn't replace hush, but in my eyes is BTCH much better then hush, because it is a unique technique

[21-Nov-18 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cryptographic BTCH is a "sister coin", BTCH is based on KMD, while HUSH is older and based directly from Zcash source code. Both have their own genesis blocks and their own blockchains

[21-Nov-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I've just learned that VerusHash option has finally landed in KMD source code, which is needed to "revive" BTCH with VerusHash

[21-Nov-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's still pretty bleeding edge, not yet in the `jl777` or `dev` branches yet, but I will be playing around with it. This is one of the pieces that needed to come into place for BTCH, so this is very nice

[21-Nov-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTCH can also do VRSC-style staking, and have "eras" where the block reward changes in different ways, which is more flexible that "old skool" halvening schedule. Not sure how those will be used yet, but it's there as an option

My friends and family are migrating from Signal to Wire. Like Signal it's secure/private, but unlike Signal it doesn't expose your phone number to other people, and the group chat mode is more reliable than Signal's.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @kh4567 did anybody think Cryptocoins were evenly distributed? Also, one address can be owned my multiple people (multisig) and one person can have infinite addresses, so really, it doesn't tell us much

[22-Nov-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I've heard that KMD is going to auto-upgrade all assetchains to Sapling, so no matter how BTCH changes in the short or long term, it will have the Sapling upgrade. Which means zaddr transactions become crazy fast and possible on a mobile wallet/etc.

[22-Nov-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is still being worked on, no dates or block heights are known, just that it is coming üòÉ

[22-Nov-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and to remind people, choosing VerusHash has landed in KMD `FSM` branch (which is the very bleeding edge, more so than the `jl777` or `dev` branches), so progress on the "BTCH revival" can commence. I would love help from some people, hopefully that are familiar with KMD or want to learn, in trying out various options for the new chain. There are many many new things to try and community involvement would be very helpful. Mostly we need to decide, exactly what the size and schedule of the block reward will be

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal ok. One thing to note tho, is those big initial blocks of VRSC were timelocked, and we are not going to do timelock stuff

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a really interesting concept, and better fit for the beginning of a coin

[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @jl777c Vertcoin (lyra2rev), Monero and all of its fork, a different opinion) There is talk that Zcash is going to change the algorithm, DGB is going to introduce a new algorithm that will change every 10 days, not everyone wants ASICS)

[22-Nov-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto Then I think with as many as HUSH 12-15 coins, then every 2-3 years the reduction of the block

[22-Nov-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that won't come until at least the next hardfork, the so called "Blossom"

[22-Nov-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal we are talking about BTCH tho, right?

[22-Nov-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> yes

[22-Nov-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Yes blossom, But maybe I have the wrong information)

[22-Nov-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> With such a course cryptocurrency is not profitable to use even ASIC)

[22-Nov-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto Yes we talk about BTCH, A small block ensures that there will not be big sales

[22-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal so are you suggesting 1 month at 192 blocks, 1 month at 96 blocks, etc... ? We need to decide the amount of time for each "era" and make sure it does not emit too much

[22-Nov-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto Not more than one month. The first 192 no more than 2 weeks. In my opinion, Verus did it brilliantly and perfectly.

[22-Nov-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> You can improve this by adding your own feature, so as not to be called a plagiarist))

[22-Nov-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> It's my opinion

[22-Nov-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Looks like Zcash wanted to solve the problem cunningly and reward the miners of ASIC and GPU

[22-Nov-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal verus had 384 blocks, just so you know. I remember them fondly üòÉ

[22-Nov-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Yes I remember) But did Verus claim 80 million coins? BTCH will have 42 million. But, only 21 million will be mined

[22-Nov-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> As a result, the block should be half as much as the sum of the offer in half or 4 times, since the actual production will be 21,000,000 coins
