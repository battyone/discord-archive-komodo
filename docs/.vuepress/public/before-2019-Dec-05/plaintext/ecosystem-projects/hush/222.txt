[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Basically, we need to skin it with our logo/etc, but it's really coming along. Any KMD smartchain (except Pirate, because this is not currently compatible with zaddrs) can use this code. We will skin it and have it as an option where no blockchain is needed to be downloaded. But, no zaddrs or memo fields either. This wallet really shines for wallets on very low-resource devices or where bandwidth is expensive or slow

[15-Sep-19 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH users will have a lot of options for wallets, soon. Mac/Linux/Win desktop SD, SD Android and our SilentDragon SuperLite wallet for Mac/Linux/Win/Android

[15-Sep-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So we will have a flavor of :SD:  and :SD:SL  for every OS

Will there be a mining feature on the superlite wallet?

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jewelie no, superlite wallet cannot mine. It can see and make transparent address transactions

[15-Sep-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> is t his silent dragon wormhole safe?

[16-Sep-19 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Wormhole is not operational currently

[16-Sep-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I will write some docs to describe the exact security considerations involved when using it

[16-Sep-19 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Optimus_prime> Hmmm. Between Pirate and Hush what is the main difference?

[16-Sep-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Optimus_prime> @dukeleto you are in both team. So why 2 different entity with near identical techs?

[16-Sep-19 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Main difference: Hushlist, CC compatible

[16-Sep-19 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Hush is for secure messaging. Arrr is to pay anonymous

[16-Sep-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> So different aims and some different tech. But yeah Hush and Arrr work together...and this is Rly smart if you ask me

[16-Sep-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Optimus_prime 
On my side I have KMD + ARRR + Hush. [Global 10% of my profile]
I use KMD a lot for none crypto project. I use KMD to store small information and it get notarized. (Signatures) - Think about it as hash for a file. Cheaper to store information via kmd then directly via Bitcoin. 50% of profile
ARRR - I like it but its high risk. As for privacy, its offers decent privacy, not bulletproof. 10% of profile
Hush - Crypto condition, Hushlist and whatever zcash has. 40% of profile

[16-Sep-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Optimus_prime Hush is much older than Pirate, and the tech is similar to outsiders, but you need two different mainnets to try out 2 different sets of ideas. And we do have 2 different ways of doing things, with different implications

[16-Sep-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Optimus_prime Pirate enforces zaddrs-only at consensus layer, Hush does not. Pirate has the better strict privacy. Hush is the first pure-Sapling chain, and doesn't require 1.6GB of downloads, and we have UTXO-based smart contracts, pirate does not. Our emission schedules are pretty different as well

[16-Sep-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> since I have code in Bitcoin and  Zcash and every Zcash source fork, it's not weird for me to work on 2 coins üôÇ

[16-Sep-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Originally Hush was built on Zcash 1.0.8 codebase, and Hush and Pirate were initially much different. But then when Hush migrated to KMD 2.x codebase, we became much closer to Pirate. But still different enough

[16-Sep-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ASIC/FPGA/CPU mining, I do. No GPU mining for me, I did that on BTC back in the day

[16-Sep-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763

[16-Sep-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763

[16-Sep-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763

[16-Sep-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If people download the new :SD: for windows, sync it, and send a screenshot of their `hushd` with tag $HUSH on twitter, then post it in here to tell us, they earn 25 HUSH . This adds nodes to our network, gives us marketing and shows people how easy syncing a Hush full node can be. What do y'all think?
