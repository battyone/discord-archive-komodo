[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I guess we'll have to suffer through another round of "hush ded" ðŸ˜‰

[23-Aug-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Good new!!! Thanks.

[23-Aug-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> No problem, thanks to you and duke for bringing it to attention ðŸ˜ƒ

[23-Aug-18 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in other news, Bitmain is now going to require KYC to buy miners(!). What a crazy world

[23-Aug-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```
Our official website https://www.bitmain.com/ will launch the Real-name Authentication on 24/08/2018 00:00 (UTC/GMT +8). Kindly complete the authentication as soon as possible, otherwise purchasing may be restricted/blocked.

1.   Due to regulatory compliance requirements, some personal information including name, ID type, ID number, address information will be collected for the purposes of identity authentication. Kindly log in to our official website: https://www.bitmain.com/ -User Center for real-name authentication. The information collected is confidential and will not be disclosed by us to unauthorized third parties without your consent, except when required for the purposes of meeting government, legal or other regulatory requirements.```

[23-Aug-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> my guess is that this will create a black market of miners at jacked up prices, to avoid KYC.

[23-Aug-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> What kind of implications does that have on purchasers? Are they limiting purchases per customer, or is it just the fact that people won't want to supply that kind of personal information?

[23-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it gives Bitmain goverment ID info of their customers, which can give to goverments/etc

[23-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> less privacy as a consumer

[23-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and now another place your identity info can be stolen

[23-Aug-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> tax purposes right

[23-Aug-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Bitmain is trying to do an IPO, so this is related to them begging for money

[23-Aug-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'd be begging for money too if I invested 90% of my capital into Bitcoin Cash ðŸ˜‰

[23-Aug-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> That alone must be the biggest red flag to investors to ever exist. It's like investing in Enron. ðŸ¤·

[23-Aug-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @Berg Do you want to take control of the telegram channels?

[23-Aug-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I talked to duke about it, he isn't an admin on it either, unfortunately

[23-Aug-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It's not really an active telegram at all..

[23-Aug-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> The only time I really go in there is to invite people into this chat.

[23-Aug-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> It's a pity the telegrams are used by far more people, as I understand Clamoring has access

[23-Aug-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yes, she's a moderator over there, but no longer active.

[23-Aug-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm sure someone could get in touch and gain duke and I access.

[23-Aug-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'd be willing to begin reeling it in, but running two chat groups seems excessive. I do like what we have going on here much more than Telegram, clearly ðŸ˜‰

[23-Aug-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'd be willing to get that one under control and see what I can do, of course ðŸ˜ƒ

[23-Aug-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Worst comes to worst we should clean up the chat and get that one no-lifer out of there

[23-Aug-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm trying to hunt down every source of "is Hush dead" and kill it

[23-Aug-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Telegram seems to be a solid contributor to that view

[23-Aug-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Extradition90> Hey what's going on here?

[23-Aug-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Breakfast

[24-Aug-18 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <daanoontjeh> Goodmorning! -- everybody voted today?! Good! ðŸ˜„

[24-Aug-18 05:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <daanoontjeh> I love the Bitmain IPO, its really desperate. Not sure what is going to happen though. If they end up being bankrupt they might sell all their BCH and crash the market (?). Not sure what to think of that.

[24-Aug-18 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Yes I want them to become homeless)

[24-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I just registered on their exchange for the airdrop they're doing.

[24-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Very professional and sleek feel to the exchange ðŸ˜ƒ

[24-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so what's happening in HUSH world lately?

[24-Aug-18 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Getting some new exchange listings, head hunting for someone from Komodo to help us with binaries for packaging Hush-NG for release (if you know anyone interested please have your people reach out to our people) and dPoW implementation stuff. Also starting to look at BTCH and weighing out options for an attack plan on reviving the project a bit, have some new exchanges coming to that as well ðŸ˜ƒ

[24-Aug-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Zor3xeR> Can anyone please explain what this court order obtained against Hush is? ;o

[24-Aug-18 08:52 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
where did you hear such thing?

[24-Aug-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <HUSH Bridge-Bot> [dscrdkmd] <Gordon Komodo> where did you hear such thing?

[24-Aug-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Zor3xeR> Reddit

[24-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I don't believe it unless we get an actual correspondence

[24-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I've seen the same exact thing towards other coins just trying to reach a settlement on a fake case.

[24-Aug-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Without official correspondence there's no reason to get worried. If it were urgent that person would've followed up by now.

[24-Aug-18 10:05 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it sounds like scam

[24-Aug-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <HUSH Bridge-Bot> [dscrdkmd] <Gordon Komodo> it sounds like scam

[24-Aug-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Yes, it's just a joke or a troll !

[25-Aug-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <daanoontjeh> For now its nothing really, just someone on Reddit saying he is somebody and needs to speak to somebody. Basic FUD stuff.

[25-Aug-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> Guys, please vote for HUSH on Sonox.io.
We have fallen to the 10th place and 3 days remaining. Would be really bad if would not make in the first 15 coins.

[25-Aug-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> It's obvious some coins have been botting way more than others

[25-Aug-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> cough btcp cough

[25-Aug-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I think we have a pretty good chance still.

[25-Aug-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <aledel> 1000+ votes in hour to some coins ðŸ‘Œ

[25-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Aug-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Let's hope so ðŸ˜€  only thing that matters is that hush will get the listing.

[25-Aug-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> i hope all of our hush votes were not carlos' bots

[25-Aug-18 10:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We'll be perfectly fine, we've barely gotten any votes up since they combed through the first time

[25-Aug-18 10:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Many other coins took top 10 overnight after just being added. We'll definitely be moving up once they remove those.

[26-Aug-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <daanoontjeh> Hehe, so many weird coins on top all the sudden.

[26-Aug-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> We will most likely get listed there,

[26-Aug-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> 8th place baby!

[27-Aug-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We're being listed there, I've been talking a lot with their head developer lately ðŸ˜ƒ

[27-Aug-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I may have a few surprises with SonoX as well ðŸ˜ƒ

[27-Aug-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> ðŸ˜‰

[27-Aug-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I have a very good feeling about this exchange, most that I've been seeing haven't seemed too promising, but SonoX seems to have a great team and a very sophisticated look to their website. The way that they're organizing their launch is gaining them a lot of traction.
Don't forget to sign up early to be a part of their SONO airdrop!
Let's show them some support and get some volume upon launch ðŸ˜ƒ

[27-Aug-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I believe they're scheduled for a mid-late September launch.

[27-Aug-18 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I registered several days ago. For the moment, we had to imagine what their site will visually look like.
The current site is rather clean, I like.

[27-Aug-18 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Bar_F1sh_Rel> Pity their coin daemon isn't ubu 18.04 compatible

[27-Aug-18 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> 18.04 has been a nightmare with any coin, at least in my personal experiences

[27-Aug-18 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> They're also very open to suggestions ðŸ˜ƒ

[27-Aug-18 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Bar_F1sh_Rel> I could get most working - but not theirs

[27-Aug-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> So if you relay that concern to them, they're likely to be responsive ðŸ˜ƒ

[27-Aug-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> From what I've experienced from personally working with them.

[27-Aug-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Very approachable dudes

[27-Aug-18 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Bar_F1sh_Rel> responsive on their discord - and helpful - but the answer to 18.04 was - "we don't support that"

[27-Aug-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'd imagine they have much bigger fish to fry right now with the integrations they're working on for prepping their launch

[27-Aug-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I wouldn't count it out as a suggestion in the future though.

[27-Aug-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Bar_F1sh_Rel> True - bit of a pain though.
Page does look good - I hope they get good volume.

[27-Aug-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Looks like they've got a good amount of support. Don't see many new exchange launches as well received as they are currently.

[27-Aug-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> it'd be huge for us to get in on the ground floor of their launch and have them take off ðŸ˜ƒ I'll definitely be placing some orders at launch just to contribute for us ðŸ˜ƒ
