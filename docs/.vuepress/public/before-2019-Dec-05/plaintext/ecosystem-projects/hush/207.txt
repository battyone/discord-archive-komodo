[31-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if only they would just use the `coinsupply` RPC

[31-Aug-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg could you try to contact those sites and tell them our circulating supply is wrong and that `coinsupply` RPC will always give them correct value? If they want to hit a web API that we run, to give them the data, I am open to providing that as well

[31-Aug-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> actually, I am wrong @Berg, it's only CMC is that drastically wrong

[31-Aug-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Coingecko/coinpaprika are using the explorer API, just small differences in shielded/unshielded supply

[31-Aug-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: Only CMC is wrong, by ~1.5M HUSH(!)

[31-Aug-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they list us as having 5.6M circulating supply, but we actually have ~7.2M circulating

[31-Aug-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @Optimus_prime maybe cryptobridge issues

[31-Aug-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <+dreamTim> thank you very much @dukeleto!

[31-Aug-19 11:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @dukeleto, I can send in a Google Spreadsheet public form that CMC asked to be filled out (specifically Annex C section). 

For this update CMC required information such as "Old Circulating Supply", "Old Total Supply",  "Old Max Supply", "New Circulating Supply", "New Total Supply",  "New Max Supply", "API endpoint URL", etc. I have filled out what I can truthfully and will send a copy of their Google form back to them soon. The Explorer website is down at the moment and the API for Hush coin supply isn't accessible at explorer.myhush.org/api/supply. Once the website is back up, I'll send this email.
