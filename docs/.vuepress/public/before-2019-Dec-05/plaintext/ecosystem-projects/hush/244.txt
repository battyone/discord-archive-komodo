[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> up 30% in the last 30 mins

[27-Sep-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> at this rate i can retire in a week

[27-Sep-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh you are one of those people that watch the minutely candles, eh?

[27-Sep-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> only cuz i was fighting with a bot to grab some HUSH on an exchange whose candles Im not sure if i can even change

[27-Sep-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> whenever somebody buys a chunk of HUSH, we go to #1 on whattomine, then the miners come and dump on us

[27-Sep-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> and then someone kept buying

[27-Sep-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and then the circle continues

[27-Sep-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, bots react to the orderbook changes. Some bots are dumb, some are smarter

[27-Sep-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh you are probably fighting ITM's bot, and many others

[27-Sep-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i hate bots

[27-Sep-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> as opposed to today's really expensive hush üôÇ

[27-Sep-19 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> so agama and sd use the same dat file?

[27-Sep-19 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Nah.  It's not expensive

[27-Sep-19 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Sep-19 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh verus agama can only run HUSH3 in light mode and is highly not recommended to use

[27-Sep-19 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because it's agama

[27-Sep-19 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and not a full node

[27-Sep-19 11:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if agama could run HUSH3 in full mode, they would use the same wallet.dat

[27-Sep-19 11:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is only one place wallet.dat lives

[28-Sep-19 12:50 AM] Gateway#3763

[28-Sep-19 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763

Zcash Metadata Leakage CVE-2019-16930
https://t.co/BFVNd4MrZM
TLDR: Attackers can link shielded addresses (zaddrs) to the IP addresses and nodes that control them. 
This is pretty bad if Alice doesn't want Bob to stalk her.
All $ZEC protocol coins have this bug.
