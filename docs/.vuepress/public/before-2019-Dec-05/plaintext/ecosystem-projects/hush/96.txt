[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> imagine all the paperwork they had to fill out for the cfo to approve

[24-May-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Test the waters with bitpay integration, and if BTC makes sense for them, as a biz, then go full in, and run their own infra

[24-May-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If it makes sense, they will run their own btc infra to increase profits

[24-May-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but they must test the waters

[24-May-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `imagine all the paperwork they had to fill out for the cfo to approve`
Not really, because it's the equivalent of adding Western Union or Discover card

[24-May-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> They are still getting $ and don't have to mess with crypto

[24-May-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @dukeleto I'm not sure I see an integration step coming out of it, they offload that onto bitpay and the consumer pays the costs, there's no upside to internal adding after 3rdparty integration that comes with little or no cost

[24-May-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> bitpay is taking a big cut, i am sure

[24-May-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ATT is bigger than bitpay, and most likely would prefer to remove them as middle-person

[24-May-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> well, when I have an ATT card instead of a VISA card I might see it your way ü§∑üèΩ

[24-May-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> Where I work I also implemented it with bitpay (europe). 
1% fee 0.002% of the people using it it's a marketing thing but explaining the cfo why some company in Estonia? pays for a customers telecom bill needs a bit of work.
It get even funnier then Law-inforcement asks who recharged that prepaid phone with which credit card number.
Anyways good to see big companies accept it.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This new paper is making some waves: https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/550.pdf

[24-May-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Microsoft came up with zkSNARKs with no trusted setup, it seems

[24-May-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sure does make you wonder how Zcash is going to justify spending almost $1M USD/month, on inferior tech

This new Microsoft Research paper claims to have zkSNARKs with no trusted setup, which they call Spartan.

This brings serious competition to Zcash internals world, where Electric Coin Company is no longer the source of zero-knowledge math that drive...

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We're trying to make right of what happened with Cryptopia and their exchange getting hacked.
Our currency is now extremely secure with #dPoW, and we're working hard to get on new exchanges to bring value back to our project

[24-May-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> yeah I was looking at that the other day

[24-May-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RhythmDr> They are pretty much in control

[24-May-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763

[24-May-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763

[24-May-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RhythmDr> You would think so

[24-May-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> especially with bs about Bloomberg...

[24-May-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> keeping them distracted...

[24-May-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> mining is currently a great way to accumulate crypto, I'm mining with my gpu's around 10$ a day worth of btc through nicehash.

[24-May-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> nice

[24-May-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> HUSH diff jumped

[24-May-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RhythmDr> I've not really looked into mining as I think it costs more to run a machine than what is rewarded?

[24-May-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that depends on many variables

[24-May-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> yeah diff too

[24-May-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I'm turning a profit with fairly expensive electricity, around 15 us cents/kwh

[24-May-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's not financially viable to use GPU's to mine Hush, but it's very profitable to mine HUSH with ASICs, depending on your electricity rate, exchange rates and BTC price, etc..

[24-May-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Although just barely üòÑ

[24-May-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> With a GPU, you are basically trading the cost of the electricity for a bit of HUSH, with no profit. But even that is good for learning and to avoid exchanges

[24-May-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can always spend BTC on NiceHash to mine Hush, too. This is not financial advice, just saying it's an option

[24-May-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> yeah thats how I started

[24-May-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you have the knowledge, that is probably a cheaper way to get Hush than exchanges

[24-May-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> but they have there issues as well

[24-May-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> I kept one miner and just rent the rest of my hash now

[24-May-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I might have to try that since I'm already mining to nicehash

[24-May-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> I usualy fined a rig(s) at a good price and lock it/them in for a week and watch BTC go up the whole timeü§ë
