[dscrd-hush] <Andrei> Hello, can you uptade information for  "Circulating Supply"  ?  Thank you

[24-May-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alien> Why doesn't hush havte any volume?

[24-May-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> CMC needs an API that returns the circulating supply as a number. 

If I was still active as a web developer, I'd do it by coding up a PHP script that would interact with the CLI and run "./hush-cli coinsupply" on the same machine running a hush (komodod) node. 

The result from that command outputs an array and I'd just echo coinsupply_result("total"); to the web browser at say www.pixelised.org/hush_query.php?q=total

Note: This would require a host running a webserver with PHP and Hush node.

[24-May-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Where you can change the "q" variable to any of the other array indexes like "coin", "height", "supply", "zfunds" and "total".

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @Andrei

Hello, can you uptade information for  "Circulating Supply"  ?  Thank you
```
Where ?

[24-May-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @gilardh  I assume on CMC.

[24-May-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> 'Circulating Supply : 5‚ÄØ641‚ÄØ700 HUSH' is false ?

[24-May-19 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> On CMC the circulating supply is 5,641,700.  At height 23523, the total is  6471042.61112515. Doing whole numbers arithmetic, the difference is 829342 Hush coins. Which would add another $55266.52 to the market cap at the current price of $0.066639.

[24-May-19 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> A lot of info was out of date on CMC.

[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> https://explorer.myhush.org/api/supply

[24-May-19 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> send them this or I can do it just make sure we only send it once

[24-May-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> I send a request to 
update coingecko and coinpaprika

[24-May-19 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX thanks, that is very close to our actual "total supply" ! In theory, we should add about 71,000 locked sprout funds to our total supply, but your number above is much closer than the wrong numbers on CMC/coingecko

[24-May-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am thinking about making a special case in the `coinsupply` RPC for HUSH which adds in those locked sprout funds

[24-May-19 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> this is what I get from coinsupply
{
  "result": "success",
  "coin": "HUSH3",
  "height": 23568,
  "supply": 6467723.05635994,
  "zfunds": 3882.05476521,
  "sprout": 0.00000000,
  "total": 6471605.11112515
}

[24-May-19 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX yes, I think your insight /supply endpoint uses `gettxoutsetinfo`, which probably has the same `supply` number. `coinsupply` is a kmd-specific RPC and the insight code most likely doesn't use it. I see it lists sprout specifically, huh

[24-May-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the thing is, we have a total supply which is spread across 2 blockchains

[24-May-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 71K sprout locked into the old chain, and the 6.4M Hush on the new chain

[24-May-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a complex situation, which most coins are never in, and it makes the ideas of "circulating supply" and "total supply" kind of complex

[24-May-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 6.4M is our circulating supply

[24-May-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but 6.4M + 71,000 is our total supply

[24-May-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> ah I see.
( the insight explorer acttualy does not deliver the coinsupply natively from the daemon it's just an api call that is redirected to a cached page it would be impossile to deliver it so quickly I think.

[24-May-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Agreed, it probably caches the output of `gettxoutsetinfo`, which is a very slow RPC

[24-May-19 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> In the past, CMC has manually updated our supply, which was just a manual fix that never auto-updated. CMC supply has always been wrong for Hush, ever since I started working on Hush

[24-May-19 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> about the locked sprout funds maybe do the same as with ARRR if somebody can produce the viewing key give him the funds from a refund fund ( if there is any )

[24-May-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX yep, Hush is planning to emulate Pirate, if people want to come forward with sprout funds, they can claim funds on the new chain. We have some funds set aside for that

[24-May-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> if they are locked, not part of supply

[24-May-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c total supply and circulating supply are different in my mind. They are similar to provably burned utxos, except they happen to be on a different chain as well

[24-May-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> does "supply" mean "circulating supply" or "total supply that has ever existed", I guess is the question

[24-May-19 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> sometimes, as a mathematician, I think too hard about edge cases

[24-May-19 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> if it is updating, that is not max, so must be circulating

[24-May-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> well, that makes life easier

[24-May-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> I did not even see that issue:)

[24-May-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> I also agree that if the coin is issued and can be accessed it's circulating.
for ex. RFOX is a great example the mcap is +-35m and not +-7m ( taking the definition of a big cryptomarketcap website )

[24-May-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's always been "easy" for CMC/coingecko to get Hush supply via our RPCs or insight APIs, but they have never wanted to actually do it. Maybe they are getting more organized now
