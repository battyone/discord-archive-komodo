[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 @Berg has been the direct contact with them, I believe he has talked with both of them recently

[25-Nov-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Zeyu cryptoconditions are pretty amazing, here is a document explaining them: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Mastering_CryptoConditions

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTCH will have all of those things, to make smart contracts and crazy "dApps" and things like that

[25-Nov-18 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> oh, I guess the other big change is that BTCH will have PoS "staking", VRSC-style

[25-Nov-18 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Nov-18 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Looks like a lot of people are buying BTC, price and volume are both increasing nicely and looking at the past volumes chart it might still increase up until Thursday and up to $10B.

[26-Nov-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> I've read an article that predicts (hype or shills) Hush to be $100 by the end of 2018 at http://thetokeninvestor.com/hush-top-undervalued-privacy-coin-for-2018/ 

The date of the article doesn't correspond to prices/values of Hush at that time, so apart from a couple of good points, credibility on that prediction goes out the window there...

[dscrd-hush] <ectrader> maybe $100 in 2019

[26-Nov-18 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ectrader> but i expect early $10

[26-Nov-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <juni> i lost all hush in crytopia

[26-Nov-18 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <juni> i can't without

[26-Nov-18 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <juni> ðŸ˜¦

[26-Nov-18 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> $10 might be more realistic for 2019 but there's not long left for 2018 to go.

[26-Nov-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Need listings on a couple of big exchanges for that to happen.

[26-Nov-18 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <daanoontjeh> Why? we already reached $20 with just cryptopia. It would be nice to have bigger/better exchanges though.

[26-Nov-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> We were not limited by Cryptopia last time we mooned, but 2 or 3 good exchanges would be great, if/when something like this happens in the future

[26-Nov-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <badalf> What's the plan for hush considering there is $0 24hr trading volumes

[26-Nov-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @badalf we do not control exchanges

[26-Nov-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RemoteConTroll> We need to make 1 trade per day.  That will increase volume 100 percent

[27-Nov-18 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Hold?

[27-Nov-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> No buying? ðŸ˜‰

[27-Nov-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> seriously considering getting that whole bitcoin, maybe when its 1.5k$

[27-Nov-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Is that what you're holding out for?

[27-Nov-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm trying to figure out where I want to buy in...

[27-Nov-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I know Bloomberg or someone said it was heading for $1.5K

[27-Nov-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But idk if I'll fomo before that

[27-Nov-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Yeah, i'm not sure either, the way that it's going though i would not be surprised to find bitcoin under 2000 soonish

[27-Nov-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'll try to hold out for $2K flat.

[27-Nov-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I think I just need to ignore the price for a month or two and see where it ends up

[27-Nov-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Or else I'll end up buying in the minute it crosses $2,999

[27-Nov-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Need to buy that Hush too ðŸ˜‹ , any word from Cryptopia or Tradesatoshi?ðŸ˜‰

[27-Nov-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Not since last week. I tend to get a response after my 3rd consecutive email, so I'll ping them again ahaha

[27-Nov-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm trying to refrain from taking a personal loan out for Bitcoin, against all better judgement of my finance profession...

[27-Nov-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I could easily afford the monthly payment on a 3 year $15K loan since I don't have any rental payments, so I've been having a hard time talking myself out of it.

[27-Nov-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm bullish on BTC to a fault ahaha

[27-Nov-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I've got 100% confidence that bitcoin will bounce back at some moment.

[27-Nov-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Also tradesatoshit told me not to send anymore support tickets regarding hush wallets :rolf:, i've only sent them 2.

[27-Nov-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> That's exactly why I've been considering it...

[27-Nov-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It may take some time, but it'll bounce back.

[27-Nov-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Politicians alone will drive it to success once they stockpile enough of it

[27-Nov-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> The simplest logic I can use to prove appreciation in value

[27-Nov-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm trying to decide, if I do go ahead with it, what my split between BTC / ETH / XRP will be... I hate the concept of that split, but it's the "safest"

[27-Nov-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I already have tons and tons in smaller alts, so I need some heavy hitters that drive the market.

[27-Nov-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> i just invested in some more mining hardware during black friday, and i'm hoping to make some profit with those when everything starts going up again, at this time they are barely making their electricity bill ðŸ˜ƒ

[27-Nov-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I wish I would've gotten into mining, but always just invested directly. Did a little bit of masternode and staking stuff, no mining though.

[27-Nov-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Still waiting for Cardano to have staking. I've got a lotttttt of those, and they were supposed to be done with that release in like June...

[27-Nov-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> staking seems to be very popular right now, usually just need to have the wallet open and you'll get free coins, in some cases even that isn't required.

[27-Nov-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> compared to mining it's much more cost efficient in this economy

[27-Nov-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah it's the uncertainty that keeps me from investing in anything tangible

[27-Nov-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Especially with how fast mining equipment has been becoming obsolete

[27-Nov-18 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 that means you send 1 support ticket per day now (from the movie Shawshank Redemption, a prisoner asks for a prison library via a weekly letter. After many years, they give him a library, and tell him to stop writing letters. He says "now I will write one every day")

[27-Nov-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg BTCH will support mining + staking, so your chance is coming up

[27-Nov-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> AMD Ryzen 7's will be very good for mining BTCH. Any recent CPU will be able to, but new AMD CPUs get good hashrate and cost less than intel CPU's

[27-Nov-18 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> with CPU mining, you don't have to worry that your mining hardware becomes a brick overnight

[27-Nov-18 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Nov-18 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yup

[27-Nov-18 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all that is going into BTCH, lots of awesome stuff

[27-Nov-18 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah I tried to get into Verus mining, but had issues joining a pool. Ran my computer for like 3 days solo mining with no return so I just decided I was fine without it

[27-Nov-18 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so we won't create BTCH until at least after Dec 15th

[27-Nov-18 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg yeah, you missed the window of solo mining. I used to solo mine a VRSC block once per day, then it became once a month, and I switched to a pool

[27-Nov-18 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the pool mining software is ~70% faster to mine VRSC than with a full node, so at least there is that ðŸ˜ƒ

[27-Nov-18 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTCH will have Sapling (crazy fast zaddr xtns), Cryptoconditions, Mining via VerusHash (CPU/GPU) and staking (50/50 with PoW)

[27-Nov-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is why it's a good idea to use KMD asset chains. To add all that to Hush, well, it would be a massive undertaking. There is a plan to add Sapling to Hush, but just that, is a massive undertaking

[27-Nov-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "not worried about crypto winter", no, because they are creating it. They need to get BTC as low as possible for them to maximize their future profits

[27-Nov-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> everyone that wasnt more wall street involvement in crypto should remember the bear market started when the futures market started for BTC

[27-Nov-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Agreed, it's all politics. That's what it's been with the constant bait and switch by every major government on earth.

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Gaming the system for profits.

[27-Nov-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> i think they will want 1-2k

[27-Nov-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> seems like untested levels

[27-Nov-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> of course they do. Why only make 10X on your money when you can make 20X?

[27-Nov-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they know consumers have bought BTC at almost 20K in the past, they are banking they will again, in the future

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> No guys, BTC will not go bellow 2.9k. For at moment it can go bellow 3k, but for the most part it will remain there. In next days expect bounce up. It can go significantly higher, probably to a 200 SMA on a daily chart. Of course, as we all know, the only reliable CEX is BitstampðŸ˜‰ , so use their charts. And probably less than 2 months from now expect the lowest point of what could be a 4-year period. It would be 3k.

[dscrd-hush] <sabertooth> Guys I donâ€™t want to shill but I just heard about another privacy coin from the Komodo devs that should be very impressive. I was just wondering if @dukeleto is working only on this one here or also on another privacy coin project. And I was also wondering if the other coin is a competitor to HUSH. Donâ€™t want to say the name. Only if it is allowed by an admin. If this message is already to much shill please just delete it. Thx
