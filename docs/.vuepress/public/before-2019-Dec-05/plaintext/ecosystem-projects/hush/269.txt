[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and we will have new releases of our GUI wallets coming out soon, after new releases of our full node that will come out even sooner

[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> !tip @Alexandrus  5 hush

[27-Oct-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tip.cc> :HUSH: @Woody The Flipping Woodpecker sent @Alexandrus **5.00 HUSH** (‚âà $0.20).

[27-Oct-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> Now your golden üòÅ

[27-Oct-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> @dukeleto does anyone do anything with the memo field, on mobile?

[27-Oct-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Oct-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we got so many wallets i can't keep track

[27-Oct-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I did an AtomicDex swap yesterday

[27-Oct-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> ü§î Coins must be going up again? My wallet did and I gave a tip ü§∑

[27-Oct-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 nice, it's come a long way

[27-Oct-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Stress testing in a few days I think

[27-Oct-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> !ticker hush

[27-Oct-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> Yes went up alittle. I think lol I usually ask my other half

[27-Oct-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I'm not one to worry about the price. We can only focus on development. But I'm curious about one thing. What crypto do they use in your other half's recreation games?  @Woody The Flipping Woodpecker

[27-Oct-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> He knows the ins and outs much better thene

[27-Oct-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> It's a gamble crypto coin I will ask him the exact name when he gets back.

[27-Oct-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> On his server he uses tip bot coins

[27-Oct-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't look at price much these days. I remember when Hush was $10 üòÖ

[27-Oct-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> We were chatting about that last night

[27-Oct-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Woody's other half bought Hush at $9, too

[27-Oct-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> Yes he bought it for me üòÅ

[27-Oct-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> That's awesome. I bought at $9. And now, here we all are

[27-Oct-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> This is great

[27-Oct-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> üòÅ yes we are still alive and kicking

[27-Oct-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Well we find ourselves still interested in what we really liked a few years ago

[27-Oct-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Price is irrelevant

[27-Oct-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> When you remove that part, you end up with the people that truly enjoy it for what it is. And now, we are trying to continue development.

[27-Oct-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> Yes.

[27-Oct-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> That is very true.

[27-Oct-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> I tipped 1$ to promote hush alittle in my own way!

[27-Oct-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Exactly.

[27-Oct-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Because you never know who might say, well let me check this project out. And maybe they have a certain skill set, and they end up contributing

[27-Oct-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> One told me was the first time he'd seen hush

[27-Oct-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> The more development and uses that we have, the higher the demand will be for Hush

[27-Oct-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> With an increased demand and a low supply, usually comes an increase in price

[27-Oct-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We also have working software!

[27-Oct-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not just another erc20 token + hopium

[27-Oct-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> And we have a lead dev that is willing to listen to the community, and try new things.

[27-Oct-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> And he puts his head down and fixes anything that breaks.

[27-Oct-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Most ERC20 tokens would've needed 6 months to develop a Lite Wallet

[27-Oct-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Duke is all about Hush privacy, too.

[27-Oct-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> If you tell the XMR Monero devs, hey I think mined, spent funds are revealing metadata---they would say, show me the proof..   They probably aren't looking into it themselves, not being proactive.

[27-Oct-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> That's the feeling I get anyways.

[27-Oct-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Lots of shady things going on in Monero world, let's say that. A different kind of shady than in Zcash world üôÇ

[27-Oct-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also, that world has interesting tech, and I try to learn about it as much as I can

[27-Oct-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's still my belief that zero-knowledge proofs (zksnarks + friends) are "better tech", in terms of the math, than what Monero world uses (RingCT/etc)

[27-Oct-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That being said, Monero world has much better privacy by default, than Zcash world

[27-Oct-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you have to do lots of extra work to learn how to use zaddrs, and most exchanges don't support them, and they were really slow for a long time, etc...

[27-Oct-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't like to bash either side for no reason. I like to give credit where it's due, and call bullshit where ever it may be

[27-Oct-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And that last part, is why I have so many people who love to hate me

[27-Oct-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Because you are able to operate with one foot on both sides, and try to adopt what would work the best for User's privacy, not cater to people's tribalism.

[27-Oct-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Monero does do some interesting things technically. And yeah, that's impressive bc they are community developed.

[27-Oct-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Monero has over 50 forks (way more than Zcash) and it's the forks that are more interesting, just like Zcash world üôÇ

[27-Oct-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I need to find a list

[27-Oct-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 https://forkmaps.com/#/

https://forkmaps.com/
Forkmaps
Forkmaps is a community-maintained map of cryptonote coin forks.

[27-Oct-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 236 CryptoNote forks on that site

[27-Oct-19 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I know about 7 or 8

[27-Oct-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Masrari, Ryo, Sumo, Turtle, Blur, Electroneum and Monero V.

[27-Oct-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Nerva  too

[27-Oct-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> High supply is what turned me off about cryptonote, in the beginning

[27-Oct-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am helping Blur add DPoW and so that is the CN fork I know most about

[27-Oct-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> their lead dev @Biz is doing immense work, laying the ground for all CN coins to be able to add dpow, if they choose. It's a HUGE amount of work

[27-Oct-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> much more than when I add DPoW to a BTC fork

[27-Oct-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I've seen @Biz here. And I've checked out their discord. dPOW on a Cryptonote coin grabbed my attention

[27-Oct-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> He is a good dev.

[27-Oct-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Biz> Thanks for the kind words, both of you.  Its been a lot of hard work thus far. Many months and a lot of practical reasoning, and re-reasoning.  Of which, I'm sure there will be more of the "re-reasoning" bit.  Like every other human, I've been *wrong* more than anything else i've ever been.  Takes many of those to get things right, from a planning and design perspective

[27-Oct-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I think someone in any field with good intentions, a drive to solve a problem and the understanding that every decision made will not be perfect--will end up doing very well. Being impartial and not buying into the tribalism in the crypto community,  definitely helps, as well.

Our new SilentDragonLite GUI wallet can integrate with SilentDragonAndroid, which means now you can pair your Android phone to either a full or lite node with shielded addresses!

 Thanks again to @zecwallet for the great open sour...
Twitter

[27-Oct-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Biz you will get a lot of street cred for being the first CN coin to get dpow, and I imagine that a few CN coins will want dpow and use your work, making you an expert in their source code üôÇ

[27-Oct-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if only 10% of CN forks want dpow, that is 23.6 coins as per forkmaps

[27-Oct-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if only 1%, that is still 2 more CN coins that want dpow

[27-Oct-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Biz> Porting the changes to non-Monero derived chains will be a little more difficult, but by no means too much so. I‚Äôve got the advantage of doing database work on Qwertycoin as well, to help me with the code convention differences

[27-Oct-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Biz> Monero has evolved quite a bit from Bytecoin, for example

[27-Oct-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, i am sure there are deviations

[27-Oct-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but those deviations, are like me porting from BTC 0.15 to 0.11 API

[27-Oct-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> drastically less work than the initial support

[27-Oct-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Biz> @dukeleto by chance, do you know why it might be necessary for cn protocol to send entire blockchain history with each request in comms? Within protocol the entire blockchain history is checked, all the way back to genesis  block. This seems excessive, to me. But I could be wrong

[27-Oct-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I actually have no idea about how the CN p2p layer works

[27-Oct-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I barely understand the BTC p2p layer, after almost 3 years trying to learn it üôÇ

[27-Oct-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Biz> No worries, figured it was likely a ‚Äúno idea‚Äù scenario. I meant the question from a  more general blockchain perspective

[27-Oct-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTC has a lot of very fancy logic in p2p

[27-Oct-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> to avoid being fingerprinted, or leaking metadata

[27-Oct-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so sometimes it does inefficient things, for privacy

[27-Oct-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Biz> Yeah p2p is the death of zero-knowledge systems usually

[27-Oct-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes

[27-Oct-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Biz> Zk can be rendered utterly useless by it

[27-Oct-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> p2p is the number one weakness of Mimblewimble coins

[27-Oct-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all their stuff crumbles, once you have 1 malicious node, recording p2p network

[27-Oct-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Biz> Makes sense

[27-Oct-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> their shit is really cool, until somebody does that

[27-Oct-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but they push the bar

[27-Oct-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you cannot retroactively go look on an explorer with MW coins, you *must* be recording and if you are not, you don't have the data

[27-Oct-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Biz> Yes definitely. I thought Beam‚Äôs multi-proof merkle scheme was very cool

[27-Oct-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Beam and Lelantus stuff are interesting, and they are mixing them

[27-Oct-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sarang is involved

[27-Oct-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Biz> `you cannot retroactively go look on an explorer with MW coins, you *must* be recording and if you are not, you don't have the data` 

That‚Äôs very interesting
