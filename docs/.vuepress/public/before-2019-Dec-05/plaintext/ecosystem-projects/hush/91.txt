[17-May-19 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <unknown> is anyone mining?

[17-May-19 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <unknown> only getting 200 sol/s out of a 1080 while it says it should be around 500

[17-May-19 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> probably not so profitable to mine Hush on gpu's anymore

[17-May-19 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <unknown> crypto zone calc says a 1080 with 500 would be around 22 hush per day that wouldnt be that bad imo

[17-May-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> They are probably still calculating based on the old chains' difficulty

[17-May-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @heguli97 yes

[17-May-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> this should be a more accurate calculator https://whattomine.com/coins/168-hush-equihash?utf8=%E2%9C%93&hr=1500&p=700&fee=0.0&cost=0.1&hcost=0.0&commit=Calculate

[dscrd-hush] <unknown> oh, wow

[17-May-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> shows around 0.7 coins on 500 sol üòÑ

[17-May-19 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> but no  Z9-11 in bitmain, resellers only

[17-May-19 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gilardh you can add a link to hushmate and silentdragon, sure

[17-May-19 11:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> whattomine.com really needs to learn to get volume/price data from coingecko or something

[17-May-19 11:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> lame that it doesn't know the price of Hush which is why it doesn't show it by default

[17-May-19 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> too much work :troll:

[18-May-19 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but also, it's very good for miners who believe in Hush. Most people don't see it in their calculators right now

[18-May-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> whats good price for z9 mini

[18-May-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> or should i get innosillion a9?

[18-May-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> A9 are more power efficient (better if you have more expensive electricity), while z9mini's are cheaper

[18-May-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> good price, imho, for a z9m batch 1 is about $200, not including psu. There are many for sale on Ebay

[18-May-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> batch1 can run at 700-750 mhz, while batch 2 are more like 675mhz, which is why batch1 are worth more

[18-May-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> with the recent BTC price increase, used mining hw will most likely become hard to find soon

[18-May-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> used A9's are around $1200 on ebay, also they require more expensive PSU's

[18-May-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so an A9 is going to cost you 4-5X a z9m, but it is definitely a better long term investment. z9m is the best option for "the cheapest thing to learn on"

[18-May-19 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Jaspr-QuantifyMining> I have 1 z9 mini for sale, pm me. Sorry to post in general

[18-May-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Jaspr-QuantifyMining a simple text-only ad like that is fine, once in a while. If you want to tell people which batch and what price, that is fine too

[18-May-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763

[18-May-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @dukeleto if i put hush in agama wallet, what should i backup ? because i want to reinstall windows..i have to backup some files or just password ?

[18-May-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> How many hush you guys getting daily with a z9mini?

[18-May-19 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Roxin in lite mode, all you need is the seedphrase. If you have an old agama hush v2 in full mode, backup the wallet.dat file as well

[18-May-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Eddy O it's very dependent on the hashrate of the z9m (batch 1 do 750mhz, batch 3 mostly do the stock 500mhz), as well as pooled vs solo and also the daily network hashrate

[18-May-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but as an example, i found a this worker on Luckpool which has 10KSol, which is a default z9m running at stock hashrate: https://luckpool.net/hush/miner.html?RPeHy6a7ZdBH5yFZMV3wqFCjNePJLZiy2S

[18-May-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that worker made 23.5 Hush in the last 24hrs

[18-May-19 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> a batch 1 z9m would make 50% more

[18-May-19 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which is why I say, if you are getting a z9m, it really pays to get a batch1

[18-May-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Ok. Thanks for the info!

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> what do people think?

[19-May-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-May-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> I think its crutial early miners do that.
A good example is ARRR/Pirate at somepoint the giveaway was worth 2000KMD / person. 250k piratei in total ath 0.25kmd
Will see if people talk about the PIRATE generousity of some early miners in the future

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> some dude bought 2 pizzas for 10,000 BTC long ago

[19-May-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> know your history

[19-May-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it probably was the first real world item purchased with BTC

[19-May-19 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> i know about the pizzas

[19-May-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> i dont know anything about satoshi's vision or laszlo

[19-May-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Laszlo was the man's name

[19-May-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> who bought the pizzas. Also, I didn't know this, he seems to have invented or was one of the early pioneers of GPU mining on BTC

[20-May-19 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> All I know satoshi wanted a pizza and had no money. So he invented Bitcoin so his old pc could make him money and buy him a pizza. I made peace with it.

[20-May-19 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> I didn't realize he invented GPU mining

[20-May-19 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> What I wanna know is who is claymore that takes fees from millions of minera

[20-May-19 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> How much btch does he have?

[20-May-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Finally BTC fees back to normal

[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> I guess the pizza cost him a fortune

[20-May-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Better hope it was one damn good pizza.

[20-May-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> I can imagine he has nightmares on eating that pizza and paying with 10k bitcoin

[20-May-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> i can imagine he had way more left over

[20-May-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> but probably sold at < $1

[20-May-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> now that's the stuff of nightmares

[20-May-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> why?

[20-May-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it was at the current market price

[20-May-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> he could have purchased/mined 100,000 more BTC at similar prices

[20-May-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i doubt he used 100% of his BTC for the pizza. also there was a bit of an issue with him releasing the GPU mining ahead of when satoshi wanted, at least that is what I heard. so this was sort of his way of making up for that

[20-May-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it could be he solo mined the 10k btc very quickly

[20-May-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> He cld have sold all when it was $10 bucks

[20-May-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> nowadays most people don't even have a whole coin

[20-May-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> you cant look at things that way

[20-May-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> well, you can, but it isnt very logical

[20-May-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> at the time it was worth a pizza

[20-May-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> nothing wrong with selling or buying at market price

[20-May-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> I will sell a pizza for 10000 HUSH!

[20-May-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Well if i can travel back in time.. i will go make that pizza for him..

[20-May-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> sure, if you can go back in time, just CPU mine the first year and get hundreds of thousands of BTC

[20-May-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> if you can go back in time, just go back with the source code to 2007 and become satoshi

[20-May-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> these are silly fantasy

[20-May-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> at the time there was no precedent for real world purchase

[20-May-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Yes.. hal finney said back then u can find block by using cpu.. but he turn  it off after a while as it makes his computer hot

[20-May-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> that purchase led to bitpay and the rest

[20-May-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> The challenge now is to find the nxt bitcoin

[20-May-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> And buy it now when its still cheap
