@BittrexExchange $HUSH is always looking for new exchanges to partner with. With KMD dPoW implemented, a consensus attacker would need to successfully attack $KMD as well as $BTC to impact our chain. To learn about the features of our coin please visit https://t.co/VCHbB5i...

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in the past, i have been somewhat against "tip bots", I thought they were a gimmick and kind of annoying. But if somebody wanted to set up some kind of Hush tip bot in this discord, I will support it. I just don't want to maintain it 😃

[03-Jan-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i now see the value of people easily tipping other discord users, and it increases on-chain activity by actually using Hush as a currency

[03-Jan-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD and ARRR are both using tip bots very effectively in their discords, let's learn from them

[04-Jan-19 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> It’s none of the above

[04-Jan-19 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, with hush-ng you have templates which look like plain HTML/CSS, except you can use variables in them, which are defined in JS

[04-Jan-19 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> just for the casual follower as me: did I miss any mandatory updates like recently in PIRATE where funds had to be moved?

[04-Jan-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @LocoMB good question, no. When Hush updates to sapling, we will need to make a similar decision as KMD, about keeping old Sprout stuff

[04-Jan-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for now, no changes or migrating funds is necessary

[04-Jan-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> For those following along, Zcash itself is keeping old-style sprout addresss for a while, but KMD is deprecating them by Feb 15th, all sprout funds must be moved to taddrs or new sapling zaddrs by then

[04-Jan-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @LocoMB SO, if you have funds in a BTCH (not HUSH) Sprout zaddr, it does effect you. BTCH is a KMD asset chain

[04-Jan-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> thanks for reminder

[04-Jan-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg maybe we should tweet out something that points people to KMD "sprout to sapling" info, for BTCH people that might have funds in sprout zaddrs

[04-Jan-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am leaning towards KMD's solution, of phasing out sprout zaddrs, but KMD's `zmigrate` dApp requires cryptoconditions, so some thinking will be needed on that

[04-Jan-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX `npm run dev` should give you a dev instance of the app, and when you change code, it reloads itself automatically

[04-Jan-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I can do that 😃 Do we have a link or something?

[04-Jan-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> James has informed me that we *can* use KMD `zmigrate` app, and that only 80 BTCH is in sprout addresses, so it's most likely just one or a few people that are using them. Which makes sense, they were so slow

[04-Jan-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg kmd has some docs about using zmigrate, i think if we tell people to use it, and tell them to come in here if they need help, that is enough. Only 80 BTCH is in sprout zaddrs

[04-Jan-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is the CLI zmigrate: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/tree/master/src/cc/dapps#zmigrate---sprout-to-sapling-migration-dapp

[04-Jan-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg i am asking KMD folk about the official "GUI" way. GUI wallets can basically call that zmigrate app to migrate funds, I just haven't used a GUI wallet lately so I am not familiar

[04-Jan-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg SHossain has given some good details

[04-Jan-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```
@dukeleto it has to be CLI. here is a guide that PIRATE community uses for z_mergetoaddress. probably, BTCH users can use that too, just need to use ./komodo-cli -ac_name=BTCH instead of ./pirate https://github.com/PirateNetwork/docs/wiki/Use-z_mergetoaddress-to-migrate-your-funds-from-sprout-address-to-sapling-address
or use zmigrate dApp https://github.com/PirateNetwork/docs/wiki/Using-zmigrate-dApp-to-Migrate-Funds-from-Sprout-to-Sapling-Automatically
same, just use ./zmigrate PIRATE zsxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

[04-Jan-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg i think i will create a BTCH-specific document, to make it less confusing for people. Then, you could tweet out a link to that doc and tell people to ask in Hush discord if they have problems. Sound like a plan?

[04-Jan-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's good to remind people that BTCH has sapling, we haven't really said much about it

[04-Jan-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I’m more excited about btch than hushng.  It is good that it is still in the works

[04-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @dukeleto my btch is not in a zaddress.  Should I move it?

[04-Jan-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX not into a sprout address 😃 Create a new sapling address if you want to move into zaddr

[04-Jan-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> z_getnewaddress "sapling"

[04-Jan-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> sapling zaddrs might be default now, but the above will make sure you make a sapling zaddr

[04-Jan-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `komodo-cli -ac_name=BTCH z_getnewaddress "sapling"`

[04-Jan-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that exact command will make 1 new sapling zaddr from the CLI

[04-Jan-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Sounds like a plan to me 😃 Just ping me once you need it

[04-Jan-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX the awesome thing about BTCH is that we get all the awesome updates from KMD, it's always chugging along 😃

[04-Jan-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg sounds groovy

[04-Jan-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg i think we can just say "follow the directions here, replacing PIRATE with BTCH", since it's all the same: https://github.com/PirateNetwork/docs/wiki/Use-z_mergetoaddress-to-migrate-your-funds-from-sprout-address-to-sapling-address

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg just tell people to come to discord if they have questions. It's like 1 or 2 people that are currently using it. Spending lots of time on custom docs doesn't seem valuable

[04-Jan-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are currently talking about $1.60 in BTCH, so let's not do unnecessary work that is not needed. Worst case is the people come asking for their money after Feb 15th, and if they can prove they had the old funds, I can reimburse 80 BTCH from the BTCH dev fund. Let's be pragmatic

[04-Jan-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Agreed 😃

[04-Jan-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'll get on that

[04-Jan-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg mostly we want to remind/tell people that BTCH has sapling!!! Most people dont have sprout zaddrs

[04-Jan-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> My only concern is causing panic among BTCH holders that in reality have no action to take
