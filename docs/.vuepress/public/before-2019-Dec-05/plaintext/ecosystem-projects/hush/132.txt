[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Moeen As mention we cannot help you much in this channel. Way off topic. But if you want you can give https://forkgen.tech/ a attempt. Use at own risk. I am not sure if it a scam but know lot sites mention them.

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @Eldero yes, mobile wallets are in the game-plan, but currently our GUI desktop wallet is top priority

[24-Jun-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Moeen> @Berg anyway how much does it cost? for fork a coin?!

[24-Jun-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Moeen Takes a lot of time, if you want to create your blockchain. look at Komodo Asset Chain. You can hire people at freelance. Cost will be $1000- $2000.
Now if forking verge, I saw prices of $2000 at freelance.

[24-Jun-19 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Moeen some people will do it for $500 - $1000 just to get ratings.

[24-Jun-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> problem is not forking process. Maintenance that's a problem. Maintenance is 5x more costly then the cost of creating the blockchain itself.
You looking at a monthly of $2000 per month in costing that too just a fork, nothing special.

Verge (XVG) was forked to Shield (XSH), XSH team is competent, they helped XVG a while ago. XVG have lots of problems (slow wallet, weird consensus rules, memory leaks), I don't think that it is a good coin to fork. Other multi-algos coins exist and have a proper coinbase (DGB, Myriad). If you like to have more PoW algos, GLT have many many algos (unsure it is useful though)

[24-Jun-19 05:38 PM] phm87#7395
Launch a KMD assetchain is easier and cost less. If you fork a coin, you'll need to align your code to the changes of the parent coin (maintenance). With KMD assetchains, maintenance requires way less work than update yourself the code

[25-Jun-19 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> But kidding aside, one thing I'm missing. So far such a coin is just a piece of metal. It is not a payment method. @Draeth (PhysicalCryptoCoins.com) you know what would be awesome? Coin with QR code, linked with real address. But that means for X-number of coins X-number of molds. Is it possible for a reasonble price?

[25-Jun-19 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Kind of ÀùpaperÀù wallet...

[25-Jun-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Draeth (PhysicalCryptoCoins.com)> @halo kitty rules i've looked into a ton of different ways to include some sort of address (private or public). The downside to implementing a private address (whether it be via NFC, engraving, etc) is that most of the options would expose your private key to a third party, which to me, raises security concerns that I personally don't like and/or will make the coin look really tacky (specifically with implementing NFC).

As far as public addresses via engraving the address or QR code, i'm not opposed to it, but I do see some pitfalls. One of which, is if for some reason your address gets compromised, now you have a useless address/QR code on a coin. The other, being price. To get a unique QR code printed on every coin would drive up the price significantly (unless I can find someone to do the laser engraving for cheaper) and would also require that everyone who purchases a coin do the same (which, if I get enough interest and pre-orders for a coin specifically with this purpose, i'm all for it)

[25-Jun-19 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Draeth (PhysicalCryptoCoins.com) Yes, it exposes private key, but actual coins are made for micropayments. It don't hurt if you lose one. I guess (hope) nobody would save thousands of USD equivalent on address. Just saying. Design is cool, but it is not a coin, it is more a kind of souvenir.

[25-Jun-19 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Draeth (PhysicalCryptoCoins.com)> @halo kitty rules true, but in that same train of thought, even if you had a private key stored on there in some fashion. It technically would be a coin, but nobody would accept that coin as a payment considering that somebody else knows the private key

[25-Jun-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Would not accept a coin, but would accept a transaction.

[25-Jun-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I guess if you pay 20+USD for that piece of metal, you will not let it go off your hands.

[25-Jun-19 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> For really-real coin, address should be locked, so you wouldn't be able to change the amount on it. but that doesn't solve the problem of fees.
