[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> fool proof way is to fully uninstall Agama (there should be an option when you are in the installer), then re-install

[26-Sep-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is definitely supported by Agama, this issue happens a lot

[26-Sep-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There is also an #agama-wallet in KMD discord, those are the experts and they are very responsive in my experience

[26-Sep-18 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you every upgrade Agama and coins are not available that you think should be, uninstalling and re-installing should fix it

[26-Sep-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tony> good idea to buy hush?

[26-Sep-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Legal Disclaimer: I am not providing any financial advice for investing

Personal Opinion: Hell yes, always a good idea.

[26-Sep-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <fireatwil> everyones probably gonna dump their shit when market comes back up, get it at a discount.

[26-Sep-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I'm sure miners will dump what they've mined...

[26-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BaBa WhiteSheep> Why not submit application for coinbase? I heard it's free for now during consideration phase. Correct me if I am wrong. I haven't digested the whole story yet.

[26-Sep-18 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Hush on coinbase...now THAT will be the day üòÇ

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Never hurts to get eyes on Hush tho üòÉ

[26-Sep-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm sure constant applying to exchanges has gotten some reviewers to recognize the name at the very least

[26-Sep-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Maybe the exposure has even gained us some investors üòâ

[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> its like an oxy moron....hush on coinbase. I like it üòâ

[26-Sep-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Had to pull the plug mid application

[26-Sep-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Sep-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> forget about it... no chance they will list extreme low volume coin

[26-Sep-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> but maybe still good to apply, someone will hear about hush

[26-Sep-18 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah, I can't unless I attach a document that doesn't mean jack just to bypass their system

[26-Sep-18 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Doesn't seem like the route I want to go

[26-Sep-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Would be very nice if Komodo has that kind of power to get listed though

[26-Sep-18 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Komodo has completed their listing application üòÉ I just went over the shoot them the app and they had just posted confirming they applied üòÉ

[26-Sep-18 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BaBa WhiteSheep> That's sad. Well, sorry that I couldn't be of any help in the process.

[26-Sep-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not sure what you mean by hush passphrase. Are you talking about from the web wallet?

[26-Sep-18 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BIGMIX> yea

[26-Sep-18 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BIGMIX> its been so long i cant even remember how to access my hush

[26-Sep-18 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is specific to the web wallet

[26-Sep-18 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @BIGMIX use your passphrase to access the web wallet, download the hush swing wallet and then transfer it

[26-Sep-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can also export the private key(s) of addresses with funds, and import into a full node or any other wallet

[26-Sep-18 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BIGMIX> i have agama wallet downloaded but i cant remember how to access

[26-Sep-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BIGMIX> okay i hav my hush i checked web wallet, now how do i check my btch?

[26-Sep-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BIGMIX> got it!

[26-Sep-18 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cryptojon> Can you stake hush in the wallet?

[26-Sep-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SoonTheBearOfSpring> i've been trying to buy HUSH

[26-Sep-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SoonTheBearOfSpring> but cryptopia has been down

[26-Sep-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <beardefiance> Trade Satoshi right now

[26-Sep-18 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SoonTheBearOfSpring> way too low volume

[26-Sep-18 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SoonTheBearOfSpring> i'm looking to acumulate

[27-Sep-18 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> One z9 mini will mine about 50 HUSH/day right now, it's a good way to accumulate üòÉ

[27-Sep-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SoonTheBearOfSpring> No

[27-Sep-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SoonTheBearOfSpring> I need 100k Hush

[27-Sep-18 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <daanoontjeh> I see someone wants a new lambo.

[27-Sep-18 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <daanoontjeh> Either mining  or TS is the only approach right now. Or wait for cryptopia to get it togheter.

[27-Sep-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <daanoontjeh> Looks like alot of coins are still down on Cryptopia. They have restored some, but most are still down. Gotta be patient I guess

[27-Sep-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cryptojon> Ok so no staking in a wallet then

[27-Sep-18 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Yes, there's no staking in Hush

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I like  it, an RTFM for Hush :thinkaboutit:

[27-Sep-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Figured something like this was a little past due üòÉ

[27-Sep-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Yeah, can get a bit annoying answering the same questions üòÉ

[27-Sep-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> And even if we do have to answer them, it'll be nice not having to dig through links and track things down as much, if the data is all collected in one place

[27-Sep-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Did anybody know that we have a bunch of DOGE pairs for HUSH?

[27-Sep-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm digging around to put together this guide and finding all kinds of stuff

[27-Sep-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i think we have a few diff kind of pairs but usually they are very low volume. We have HUSH/LTC, HUSH/EUR, maybe even HUSH/DOGE

[27-Sep-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH/KMD on Barterdex, which is currently paused and which CMC does not use

[27-Sep-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Ah, right. I knew I was forgetting something in the pairings and exchanges

[27-Sep-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Very good news, I have fixed the last known issue with Hush dpow code, which means good things. I need to clean it up, merge it to dev branch, then notaries can update to it. And it will be included in our next release coming very soon

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> see all those amazing and beautiful notarized* fields in the output?

[27-Sep-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> those are new, part of KMD dpow, and they were not working correctly until I just spent 3 days debugging why

[27-Sep-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> jl777, as usual, helped me debug until we isolated the issue. I made a mistake in porting some code from btc 0.15 to btc 0.11 style. It compiled, but didn't work correctly

[27-Sep-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> notarizations were kind of working before, the transactions were being made

[27-Sep-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but the nodes themselves couldn't see the data correctly, it was kind of weird. getinfo would return 0's for notarized stuff, but now it's happy

[dscrd-hush] <skyscraper> Thank you @dukeleto for everything you do!!

[28-Sep-18 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @Berg, just a suggestion (you want to promote Hush positively), I would reword "Is Hush dead?" to something more like "How active is Hush?". Maybe the answer should be that those interested Hush should have a look at the active channels at Github, Discord, Reddit, Twitter, etc... Also mention that the number of exchanges and mining pools featuring/supporting Hush is slowly growing.

[28-Sep-18 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KayNut> @Pixelised I think @Berg was joking in the FAQ section since almost ervery week there two or three people asking in this (!) discord if Hush is dead. :thonking:

[28-Sep-18 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @KayNut , woosh over my head. lol

[28-Sep-18 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah ahaha just a placeholder joke until we have real content

Hey guys, I just want to let you know I have had a KMD tipbot made for KMD discord.  
If you have your own discord, it will work there for KMD and you are free to use it.

[25-Oct-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <skyscraper> It use to be less than 50$ a day on TradeSatoshi. So the volume is building up on this exchange.

[25-Oct-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> what do people think about this exchanges? (used to be stocks.exchange) VRSC is thinking about listing there: https://www.stex.com/

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Personally i like it a lot, i haven't had any problems with them and it's fast.

[25-Oct-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Oct-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto Good exchange, much better than tradesatoshi. There is an inexpensive listing, there is a similar exchange Southexchange, Bleutrade

[25-Oct-18 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> just curious
