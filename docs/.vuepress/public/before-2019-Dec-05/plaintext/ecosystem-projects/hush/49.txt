[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Every now and then I drop in to let people know about this channel and how it's x-tra leg1t, but Telegram and Discord people tend to stick to their platform and not migrate\

[25-Mar-19 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @TheTrunk questions/comments for you, regarding block 2 of HUSH on the current explorer: https://explorer.hush.zelcore.io/block/575e32463a22420e35e0ded889b6250d90075d926ef5b759aab69cd9665250df

[25-Mar-19 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @TheTrunk the block reward is rendered incorrectly as 0.00400000 HUSH in one place and correctly as 40,000 HUSH in another place

[25-Mar-19 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @TheTrunk the recipient of that BR has no transactions according to the explorer

[25-Mar-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so something is not right

[25-Mar-19 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> @dukeleto  The block reward of 0.00400000 is a "bug" - more like I forgot to hardocede the values for blocks 2-4 where the premine was so it is using just a standard subsidy curve. This is probably not reflected in statistics either - so those are probably all off by the 120k hush

[25-Mar-19 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> Yes I do not understand why the addresses where premine was distributed are not showing correctly on the explorer. I know it wasnt working with the older type of explorer either and I have not figured it out couple months ago why is that. Might be interesting to track it down

[25-Mar-19 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @TheTrunk getrawtransaction seems to agree with the explorer, which seems weird

[25-Mar-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's possible the code was different back then and the address that it generated is now broken, and the internals report the incorrect address for those transactions. type=pubkey is a clue, perhaps this is related to type=pubkey VS type=pubkeyhash etc....

[25-Mar-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i am doing some "blockchain archaelogy" to design the new Hush to have the same emission/block rewards as the current, which is why I am researching these old original blocks of Hush. The first 4 blocks after the genesis, blocks 1-4, had a premine of 40,000 HUSH each block sent to some address. But that address shows no transactions on the explorer, which is the current mystery we are trying to figure out

[25-Mar-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> my guess is after the pre-mine, they changed something that makes the RPC report the incorrect address for that transaction, which means any explorer/etc will report the same incorrect value

[25-Mar-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and to clarify, all this stuff is way before I ever was involved in Hush, even before radix42 was involved in Hush, even before it was *called* Hush

[25-Mar-19 11:00 PM] MyName#0491
@dukeleto is there any way to check the old explorer's db without reconnecting (to see if it's always shown that for those blocks)?

[26-Mar-19 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @TheTrunk here is a transaction that spends a pre-mine UTXO and you will see it's rendered as "unparsed address", which might mean it was a Push-to-script-hash (p2sh) or multisig: https://explorer.hush.zelcore.io/tx/db5125862cc3a43b8085a97ff4e5be20ee9b566522616a5eb7bb7eff64ddaf5d

[26-Mar-19 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> <MyName> maybe, if you have a suggestion for a command to run, let me know

[26-Mar-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> Explorer processes p2sh correctly as well as p2pkh, it is not multisig. I think the address was just a public key as you pointed out above and thats where is explorer having troubles correctly assigning it to an address
https://explorer.hush.zelcore.io/tx/094e9b0cd26f66654333191b041a5005b599e0a85e5511bb3f3233897eae4d9a - this was used as an input into it

[26-Mar-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> We can take for example this newer transaction: https://explorer.hush.zelcore.io/tx/25d853ace7a2beb523d6638c4cdf07cd83fbe30e60957c4d89f755987de9e08a
This has pubkey as well. 
If you then take one of the inputs used  in it it looks wierd https://explorer.hush.zelcore.io/tx/f29ae008914b28e939cd210976af2daef428fa6e3f7605df29195e5aa71638cc

[26-Mar-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> I suppose that this is the notarization transaction.

[26-Mar-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> Try to decode the transaction above. and you get this wierdo: https://pastebin.com/TvgsnEBF

[26-Mar-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> Like this is not how I would expect the outputs would look like. Not sure what the reason of splitting one utxo to multiple utxos is. Usually you would want to do the opposite

[26-Mar-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> almost looks like a notarization utxo, which use 0.0001

[26-Mar-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but those have 13 vins and 2 vouts

[26-Mar-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> it looks like some sort of preparation for notarization

[26-Mar-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, i think it's related to a `splitfund`

[26-Mar-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which is where you split up a big utxo into many smaller sized 0.0001 utxos, which are actually the vins to notarization xtns

[26-Mar-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is why it has a large vout output, the remainder of the big utxo

[26-Mar-19 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i have some vague memory of the fact that a single pubkey actually has multiple representations as a bitcoin address

[26-Mar-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> my suspicion is that our RPC and explorer render one form of the address, but the other form of the address was used. when you search for the address as rendered, no transactions show up

[26-Mar-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> compressed vs uncompressed generates 2 addresses, something like that

[26-Mar-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```
This compressed public key corresponds to the same private key, meaning it is generated from the same private key. However, it looks different from the uncompressed public key. More importantly, if we convert this compressed public key to a bitcoin address using the double-hash function (RIPEMD160(SHA256(K))) it will produce a different bitcoin address. This can be confusing, because it means that a single private key can produce a public key expressed in two different formats (compressed and uncompressed) that produce two different bitcoin addresses. However, the private key is identical for both bitcoin addresses.
```

[26-Mar-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> yes that is correct. The uncompressed addresses are usually used just for sending messages across the network,

[26-Mar-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> such as alert keys for example

[26-Mar-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so I am wondering if that is the issue behind the explorer showing no transactions for the address which received the block rewards for Hush blocks 1,2,3,4

[26-Mar-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> Yes it is probably tied to it. It is possible that this was a payment to uncompressed public, need to study it more and test it

[26-Mar-19 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> @dukeleto There you have a bit of examplantion of compressed, uncompressed with examples:

private key a8db568957aab4d708fa1cde6b3c19c14674d5ffe283REDACTEDREDACTEDREDA

t1W9D96R9hk8vtyuHdajwtDzSDRRtnXacT3 - address from uncompressed public key, private key in WIF from uncompresseed 5K6eoShWWsgptas3XYGL34xcj66Bn1tREDACTEDREDACTEDREDA
04317b3fd39dd25719563f46534e6d9779695ef3b5b8886c2293fc79e0c5c3283635c386d467ce6035c9862330f33dead77527b77474012410b3a26f1e7ed33447 - uncompressed pubkey

t1UPSwfMYLe18ezbCqnR5QgdJGznzCUYHkj - address from compressed public key, private key in WIF from compressed L2swqzRoGrinNgTt9nzf28UUgmTtZgtpfREDACTEDREDACTEDREDA
03317b3fd39dd25719563f46534e6d9779695ef3b5b8886c2293fc79e0c5c32836 - compressed pubkey


So from one private key we can obtain 2 public keys (compressed and uncompressed format). Those result in different address.
When a payment is made to an address the public key is not known only the address. Public key is revealed only when an address is used for spending. 
So prior that we do not know if an address is belonging to uncompressed or compressed public key. The assumption that is being used is that it is compressed as of todays standards.

An example of transaction: https://explorer.hush.zelcore.io/tx/4950305a39c74e8a55b1180d849751596692e01f14bdab7c33b614027aef7872
In this transaction an address which comes from uncompressed public key is sending to an address derived from compressed public key. Note that BOTH of these addresse belong to the SAME private key.
But the WIF format of the private key is different. The WIF format is different so wallets/core can distinguish if the public part is compressed or uncompressed and choose a correct signing method.
-> Only 1 private key is needed to unlock and spend utxos from both addresses but a specification of compression has to be used to correctly sign transaction.

[26-Mar-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> Here is another example transaction: https://explorer.hush.zelcore.io/tx/84b89f4cdc586a6179a94b8a494a76c60dabb17a227897ad92024c3572bf358d
Here our address coming from compressed public key pays to address belonging to uncompressed public key. Note that the same private key is used for signing.
-> 1 private key rules 2 different addresses

-> the type is always pay to public key hash.  p2pkh



I will perform pay to public key soon

[26-Mar-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> So explorer is showing all of this correctly. The issue is tied only to when someone pay to just public key

[26-Mar-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> @dukeleto 
Transaction where our address t1UPSwfMYLe18ezbCqnR5QgdJGznzCUYHkj coming from compressed public key pays to uncompressed public key 04317b3fd39dd25719563f46534e6d9779695ef3b5b8886c2293fc79e0c5c3283635c386d467ce6035c9862330f33dead77527b77474012410b3a26f1e7ed33447. 
-> the type is pay to public key. Change type coming back to t1UPSwfMYLe18ezbCqnR5QgdJGznzCUYHkj is p2pkh
https://explorer.hush.zelcore.io/tx/a8ec1ec003f446cd754921814c3d650876ff0eaeccf9061590135055b2f8aceb
However in the list of transaction of an address t1W9D96R9hk8vtyuHdajwtDzSDRRtnXacT3 this transaction is not shown on the explorer! https://explorer.hush.zelcore.io/address/t1W9D96R9hk8vtyuHdajwtDzSDRRtnXacT3

[26-Mar-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> API of explorer is not showing the transaction correctly - the type there is pubkeyhash. However if we decode it using daemon we are obtaining it correctly

As you can see that input is shown as coming from unparsed address (from the uncompressed public key) even though its the same as the uncompressed address t1W9D96R9hk8vtyuHdajwtDzSDRRtnXacT3. Explorer just does not know that

[26-Mar-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @TheTrunk nice write up! so is this an insight explorer bug that should be fixed? It's not specific to Hush, or even Zcash coins, this kind of bug would be present in any Bitcoin fork that uses insight

[26-Mar-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> another example of explorers not being the final source of truth, your own full node that you trust is the final source of truth

[26-Mar-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> yeah explorer is not showing the truth. It is probably a bug of all insight explorers and all coins. Right now I am not sure if it is caused by the explorer frontend (lets say bitcore-node or insight-api) or by the data the daemon is supplying to explorer - as there is Bitcore extension implemented. 
I guess it is kind of a combination of both. If I recall correctly the bitcore extension implementation in hush, zcash, komodo whatever does not count with public keys and only checks if its p2pkh or p2psh. So imo it needs to be corrected in the port of Bitcore to daemon as well

[26-Mar-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763

Yes, that is a $HUSH logo you see hiding in the preview for @barterlly, an automatic over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform! 
You make trades with others via escrow addresses which pay buyer+seller or return all funds for incomplete transactions.

[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> That's cool.  But at what price point

[30-Mar-19 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <YoJonnyCrypto> So the hush I have today in a z address must be transferred soon or be lost?

[dscrd-hush] <Drakuf> Hello

[30-Mar-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Drakuf> If my address is starting with a "t" then it's good? 😄

[30-Mar-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> @Drakuf Yes!

[30-Mar-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @YoJonnyCrypto that’s correct! Be sure to transfer it to a “t” address before the snapshot date!! (EST. April 14th) but I’d recommend doing it in advance

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _needs to find all his privkeys and consolidate_

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's a very good idea to have HUSH in fewer addresses versus many, it will make things easier. I am coming up with various ways that people can claim funds on the new chain. If your funds are all in one address or one wallet, that is much simpler than if it's spread across many addresses in many wallets

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So if you are a MINER who has mined to 1000 different Hush addresses, you really want to consolidate/sweep those into one or a few addresses. Most other people have no reason to ever use so many addresses

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Akira X price point is decided on by Alice and Bob who trade with each other

[30-Mar-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> yeah, mining and multiple servers is why I have like 8-10 use addys (not counting change)

[dscrd-hush] <gigoplast> what about who had Hush Holded in Cryptopia ?

[30-Mar-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigoplast> i guess are they safe from the sapling snapshot ?
