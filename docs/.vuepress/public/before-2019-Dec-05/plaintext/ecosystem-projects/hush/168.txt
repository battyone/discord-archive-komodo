[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> @xKNIGHT lol it's been time to accumulate HUSH... It's almost time to start accumulating Bitcoin Hush

[28-Jul-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have been merging in some ZecWallet new features and bug fixes, it's been more adventure than I thought

[28-Jul-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> into SD

[28-Jul-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this much fun: ```
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "ViewAllAddressesModel::ViewAllAddressesModel(QTableView*, QList<QString>, RPC*)", referenced from:
      QtPrivate::QFunctorSlotObject<MainWindow::setupReceiveTab()::$_36, 0, QtPrivate::List<>, void>::impl(int, QtPrivate::QSlotObjectBase*, QObject*, void**, bool*) in mainwindow.o

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it was supposed to be a small change, lulz

[29-Jul-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I tried to pull in a single commit, but it had tendrils to various places. This kind of thing happens.

[29-Jul-19 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is good for SD to be more in sync with zecwallet, that makes future updates easier to pull in

[29-Jul-19 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ZecWallet has some stuff that SD doesn't want, mostly Sprout-related stuff. That is the real work, to separate out what SD doesn't want from zecwallet

[29-Jul-19 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> So we should rebuild?

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @ITM This API shows how many coins are currently in existence https://explorer.myhush.org/api/supply , it also includes the coin locked from cryptopia so true circulating supply is much lower

[29-Jul-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> That should be updated to Coinmarketcap but they ask all sorts of other information on their form so it should be done by someone who knows those things :)

for example: `You MUST provide documentation that explains: (1) The initial distribution of coins (2) How many coins are in reserve for the founders, devs, or other purposes with associated addresses`
