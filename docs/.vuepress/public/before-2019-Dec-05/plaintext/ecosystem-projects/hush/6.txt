[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> might be also good idea (for Hush or BTCH) to make 5% APR forced monthly like in KMD? to generate activity ?

[07-Sep-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> at least we would now how many people really cares and how much BTCH is on dead addresses

[07-Sep-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> This issue was discussed recently about 5% like  Komodo, but most liked it as Veruscoin

[08-Sep-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> I am new here ...can someone tell ..what this btch is about

[08-Sep-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> I'm confused

[08-Sep-18 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> btch was airdroped to hush and other coins (BTC?) half year ago

[08-Sep-18 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <c0prhd> Thinking about mining hush again.

[08-Sep-18 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <c0prhd> Any estimates on when hush-ng will be released?

[09-Sep-18 12:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Voltron> @c0prhd I can't believe how cheap it's trading. Definitely makes more sense to buy it than it is to  mine it.

[09-Sep-18 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MrWrong> Dear Berg
I can't see single reason for using/buying/holding BTCH. There is no real world use case for this coin. Why are you giving effort for this meaningless coin? Is there any hope for this coin although there are 9797987898 coins exist for payment, micropayment etc. To be honest I'm giving BTCH zero chance.  You can blame me to be pessimistic, but I believe that. HUSH has a very good real world use case. I believe that we can success if community focus on only HUSH project. BTCH is distractor not much more.

```Berg02.09.2018
Effort does not only go to one coin. Both are being worked on, BTCH is  a runtime fork of Komodo, meaning it inherits upgrades that the Komodo team implements. Yes, we are looking at revamping some features of BTCH, but it doesn't mean all effort goes to one coin.   ```

[09-Sep-18 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> I have seen some roadmap about hush messenger ..it was supposed to be launched a year back ...but I couldn't see any news in why it's delayed and when it will be launched ..everything about hush looks great in words .. even the Twitter seems very inactive when compared with other projects .. I am not being pessimistic here ..just want to understand what's happening .. I am a new investor just evaluating my decision to invest in $hush

[09-Sep-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <c0prhd> I would love to hear more on this also.

[09-Sep-18 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> how many of you are actually helping out (in any way?)

[09-Sep-18 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> HUSH is a community coin and needs contributors to advance things

[09-Sep-18 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> otherwise things will be slow, regardless of how many times you are complaining

[09-Sep-18 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> if you see something that needs to be done, step up and help get it done

[09-Sep-18 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Most people believe that they bought a coin and now the developers must do something)

[09-Sep-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> most of what needs to be done are non-coding things, should developers must do those too?

[09-Sep-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> also, there was no ICO, the devs didnt sell the coins that people bought, so not sure where the "must" comes from

[09-Sep-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> if the community will just require the devs to do everything, then I dont think it is fair that they are complaining about how long it takes

[09-Sep-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> does anybody have project management skills? that would be useful

[09-Sep-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> what about html? I am sure can always use more website things

[09-Sep-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> social media, there can never be enough social media

[09-Sep-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> what about marketing strategist?

[09-Sep-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> writers?

[09-Sep-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> all of these skills are needed for a complete solution and notice that NONE of them are things the blockchain devs would be much good at.

[09-Sep-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so why ask the devs to do something they cant?

[09-Sep-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <nicklikestuna> I‚Äôm a project manager sometimes amongst other things

[09-Sep-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <nicklikestuna> Happy to help

[09-Sep-18 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Developers should do their work which is within their competence. For marketing and promotion - marketers. Social networks and blogs are writers. Personally, I will do what I can for these projects. Do not ask what HUSH should for you, tell  how can I help the project?

[09-Sep-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i think first and foremost a project manager is needed to help define what needs to be done

[09-Sep-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> then task list can be created and have others help out

[09-Sep-18 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> I will write on twitter about HUSH and BTCH, in the comments of other people and on my page and, if possible, participate in translations or dissemination among Russian-speaking people

[09-Sep-18 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <c0prhd> I‚Äôm a miner. I can support your chain through mining. That‚Äôs what I can do to help. Before I devote kWh I want to know what‚Äôs ahead.  That‚Äôs the reason for my question. What is the hush-ng timeline? If there isn‚Äôt one, that‚Äôs also an answer.

[09-Sep-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Project manager needs to focus on growing community first. We had plenty of people involved during all of last year and... Where did they go?

[09-Sep-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Why did they go?

[09-Sep-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> No one is left... So project manager needs to attract people.

[09-Sep-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <youngseies> What is the latest update with hush?

[09-Sep-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <youngseies> Why dont you have a telegram accoint for the community?

[09-Sep-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <youngseies> Why not focus on hush project and leave btch.

[09-Sep-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <youngseies> I think you people need to be serious with hush and start working on the project. Btch is a distractor.

[09-Sep-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <youngseies> The devs should consistently update us in thir twitter page so that we can know the project is alive. The last time , i visited the twitter page, what i sae was a post about btch and consequently my enthusiasm in hush project deprecited. Please hush devs you people should wake up from sleep and remember how when and why you created this project and the futur you have set for the coin.

[09-Sep-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> üëç to a project manager, we could really use a good one

[09-Sep-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @youngseies why not do something constructive instead of complain?

[09-Sep-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We have no Telegram, if you can't deal with that, I guess go find a coin that has 17 social media outlets with the same junk

[09-Sep-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's amazing how people feel entitled to boss developers around, developers that donate their time to make something open source. This entitlement did not exist in the free software/open source world before cryptocoins, it would have been laughed out of the room.

[09-Sep-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> a artist friend contacted me recently about storing some art in the Hush blockchain, so I am helping him with that

[09-Sep-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> he is an accomplished artist that has been hired by Google and other big names

[09-Sep-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg i am sure there is some marketing juice to squeeze from that

[09-Sep-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Absolutely, if we can get a picture with some details we can definitely plan some activity around it

[09-Sep-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> my plan is to use the `hushlist-send-file` program I wrote, and I started adding support for KMD in that, which means we can store art in the BTCH chain as well

[09-Sep-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is a standalone program that I wrote before I ever touched Hushlist, and is how I embedded the quotes from the Hushlist whitepaper, I used that on a text file

[09-Sep-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> @Berg I can help you pitch reporters, if you get those details. I have a decent track record with getting PR.

[09-Sep-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> If everyone is at least something to help the project, he will first of all help himself, because each of us is an investor and we are interested in increasing capitalization. Developers are busy with their own business, we can help those that we can and can do. They do not owe us anything, it's not a bank or a brokerage office.

[09-Sep-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @Eddy O That'd be huge, much appreciated. I'll be reaching out with details.

[10-Sep-18 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <daanoontjeh> I think its wrong though, the value might be $640 billion. But thats at the highest point it was and heavily inflated. There was never $800+ billion in crypto, a mere fraction of that. Thats why losing a couple of billion a day is so easy.

[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> just deceiving people.

[10-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @Art0077 No. We are not asking the community to pay us to work. We are volunteers who work when we have the time to. His point is that marketing can be done by anyone, yet all people do is complain when there's a lack of activity instead of pitching in to help. Feel free to pitch me a tweet in #marketing if you wish to contribute, else please realize that complaining day in and day out about the progress of the team or activity of social media lacking does absolutely nothing for our motivation.

[10-Sep-18 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yup

[10-Sep-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> This is first time I heard that HUSH is community coin. So if this is the case, every time the community is not happy with Core Team, should have a  chance to replace Core by another team. I think that existing team fail community big time and need to be replaced..

[10-Sep-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> yes you can. But I would have preferred that you end your messages with more constructive ideas if you want to push the project higher.
