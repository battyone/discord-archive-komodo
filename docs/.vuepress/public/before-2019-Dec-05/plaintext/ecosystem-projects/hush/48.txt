[dscrd-hush] <èµ–çº¢å…‰> Is bitcoin hush still going to be half pow and half pos?

[20-Mar-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Community has expressed interest over it so it might happen in the future, but first priority currently is to get Hush updated to Sapling

[20-Mar-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiveBuddha> Between the founders rewards in zdash, hush, and btch hopefully spending on this new cash injection will be spent more wisely. I know you weren't all there for the whole process, but hopefully you've learned a lot from internal discussions.

[20-Mar-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiveBuddha> I would suggest that, as boring and difficult as it is, someone on the team create a loose budgeting framework with goals and milestones, e.g. only X amount on marketing, only Y amount on exchanges, Z amount on hiring devs. We don't want to make past mistakes. Any thoughts on how you guys will handle this?

[20-Mar-19 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiveBuddha> If you outsource the budgeting strategy to the community you will find disaster in my opinion. Everyone will just vote to spend it on exchanges.

[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> So the people who have their hush coins on cryptopia, doesnt have to do anything ? Everything will be ok or we have to move hush coins from cryptopia(when they finish the exchange) ?

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @Seymour Hello, i use wallet v0.71.3 and I don't have a problem to synchronize.

[21-Mar-19 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> @Seymour remove and re-install

[21-Mar-19 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @JiveBuddha weâ€™ll release either quarterly or biannual reports on the founders rewards funds balances& how the Hush is being spent. Complete transparency is the goal

[21-Mar-19 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> The community will have some say towards what theyâ€™d like to see the funds spent on. But we will ultimately choose the path(s) which put Hush on a trajectory towards sustained long term value as opposed strictly exchanges for short term gains

[21-Mar-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> @dukeleto we should have a discussion about hsuh fork and what it will all mean from zelcore perspective mainly and the services tied to it. I can support hush as well as any komodo asset chain. Need to know more specifics especially how the transition will look like - as there will be some time period after the airdrop which is not clear what will happen as both chains will coexist

[21-Mar-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <maruse> Hi!! good evening people ;-). I have one question, i have my coins in tradesatoshi, i must send to one wallet of hush, right? a webwallet is ok for this?

[21-Mar-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @maruse You don't need to and I don't think you can at the moment, their hush wallets are in maintenance.

[21-Mar-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <maruse> but in april will be fork i am right, no?

[21-Mar-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Yes you are right.

[21-Mar-19 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> But it doesn't require you to do anything special

[21-Mar-19 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <maruse> then in tradesatoshi are sure for the fork?

[21-Mar-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> They should be, it will only require them(tradesatoshi) to do a wallet update once the fork happens. I have hush in tradesatoshi and cryptopia too. https://myhush.org/sapling/

[21-Mar-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I can keep you posted if anything changes

[21-Mar-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <maruse> thanks you!! i am newbie in this coin, but i arrive for hold too too much time ðŸ˜‰

[22-Mar-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Seymour that URL to the proving key no longer exists, radix42 deleted all their ZEC stuff I believe. Not sure if things will work with that wallet, if you don't already have the proving key downloaded

[22-Mar-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @maruse you don't need to move any coins if they are on an exchange, since exchanges do not currently use zaddrs

[22-Mar-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @TheTrunk i am not sure what you mean by "zelcore perspective". Is this related to your wallet supporting Hush and you wanting to know which chain to follow/etc ? I do appreciate you running a Hush explorer currently, and it will be useful to compare against a new explorer on the new chain

[22-Mar-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> We are providing light wallets for hush desktop & mobile and full node wallet as well as part of zelcore desktop. That comes with an explorer and I can offer electrum servers too. But as you doing a transition to asset chain requires a lot of work to redo those solutions - building and standing up new explorer, creating up to date binaries, new transaction format supports etc.

[22-Mar-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> There you have a traffic for just hush explorer solution

[22-Mar-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> So about 200 000 sessions per week.

[22-Mar-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> So I would like to support hush as this will basically be our first komodo asset chain (which is kinda exciting) and I am willing to put my free time to build the supporting solution for it. But considering that hush is introducing a fee it would be nice if hush can support zelcore and consider sharing server costs (25$ month)

[22-Mar-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @TheTrunk reminds me of madbuda

[22-Mar-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Seymour> @dukeleto and where to download this key ??
,

[22-Mar-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @TheTrunk why doesn't the ZEL founders reward pay for such things? I don't understand why you are asking the Hush project for running things that you chose, completely on your own, to run related to your project. Once we transition, we will have a new KMD-based insight explorer and electrumX backend servers and we create our own binaries.

[22-Mar-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Seymour run `./zcutil/fetch-params.sh`

[22-Mar-19 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @dukeleto I agree ðŸ’¯

[22-Mar-19 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Seymour> @dukeleto Can you elaborate? I did not quite understand what to do. I would be grateful to you.

[22-Mar-19 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i have no idea what GUI wallet you are using, or what version

[22-Mar-19 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I just know that those URLs no longer work, because radix42 no longer has anything to do with Zcash

[22-Mar-19 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> radix42 deleted all their repos and URLs and all the things

[22-Mar-19 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> anything trying to hit that URL is out of date

[22-Mar-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> The development fund of zelcash is fairly limited and is locked and maintained by zel foundation. So there is just about $25k that are distributed accross all projects. So you clearly see that for the zelcore project to be successful it needs to have a revenue model which currently is a listing fee.

[22-Mar-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Seymour> @dukeleto Where should I enter this command ??

[22-Mar-19 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @TheTrunk i can understand the constraints, I have paid for Hush servers/domain/etc fees from my own pocket for a long time, and gotten some generous donations along the way

[22-Mar-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @FireMartZ seems like latest GUI wallet has the wrong URL for downloading sprout key

[22-Mar-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Seymour the command line, if you have never used it before, this might not be viable

[22-Mar-19 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> basically, sprout is going away

[22-Mar-19 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @TheTrunk is zelcore still closed source? I am not against your project supporting Hush, but it's never been something we paid you for, or asked for, or supported

[22-Mar-19 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> sadly its still closed source (which is a company decision not mine). Supporting hush was purely mine decision yes as I liked the project.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @TheTrunk as always, I will pay bounties for good work and things like that. I am not saying an outright "no" to you, but it's not a "yes" either. I can see where you could work on things and earn bounties, for sure

[22-Mar-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you have a lot of useful skills

[22-Mar-19 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We have explorer and ElectrumX servers from KMD, since they provide those for asset chains. We are not against having secondaries, and might be willing to pay. The price of Hush is not very realistic right now, with such low liquidity, so it's hard to estimate paying for things before exchanges re-open

[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> @AkiraX Telegram really keeps chit-chatting with the fellow holders active, here at Discord, it seems all dead and dried, with not much of chit-chat. Having a talk/QA through a mobile phone seems much better than a computer (Discord App for mobile phones doesn't look of much use to me, most mobile-friendly people prefer Telegram). I think I can moderate/manage it and keep it cleaned up.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Raja_MBZ you are free to create any unofficial Telegram channel you want, because that is your right, but Hush will not be having an official Telegram channel. I use Telegram, nothing against it at all. It mostly about not spreading ourselves thin across many platforms. It didn't work out in the past

[24-Mar-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
