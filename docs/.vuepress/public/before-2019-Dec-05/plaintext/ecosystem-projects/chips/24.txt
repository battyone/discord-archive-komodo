[dscrd-chips] <sg777> do you have any guidelines on how one can play on that front end...

[26-Jan-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> does anyone tried installing  front end  mentioned by Mylo and tried playing poker?

[26-Jan-19 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Gloryman> So, firstly don't u need 2 players and secondly I don't have chips nor the know how.

[26-Jan-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> @sg777 why not start from the pangea GUI that was made for the old pangea api?

[26-Jan-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay...I installed the one mentioned in the first link only, but i didn't find this is working..

[26-Jan-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> it wasnt quite working

[26-Jan-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> and it uses old api

[26-Jan-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> but it should be very close to working

[26-Jan-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> and the backend shouldnt be too hard to convert

[26-Jan-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay, I'll take the first one as reference to start with..

[26-Jan-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Gloryman> Hey @jl777c , when is the plan to get an actual poker community playing regularly on this software. I will write it in my diary.

[26-Jan-19 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> it is up to the CHIPS community

[26-Jan-19 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Gloryman> Do we have any idea about what the rake will be like on this poker software?

[26-Jan-19 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> the dealer should be able to set the rake for their tables

[27-Jan-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> @sg777 on start up, thereâ€™s a mock API end point doing it from server.py I think.  Iâ€™ll be in front of machine in cpl hrs

[28-Jan-19 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes, I'm looking into `pangeawebsocket.py` trying to figure out where the front end actions are mapped to backend logic...

[28-Jan-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> Anyone know why chips isn't listed on the address asset viewer on the dexstats site?

[28-Jan-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> I've nearly left them behind twice when migrating to a new wallet.

[29-Jan-19 03:52 PM] jspook16#3059
Maybe because chips isn't a kmd asset chain

[29-Jan-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> https://www.twitch.tv/videos/371764356 I vote that we sign up this streamer right away. He is the future of CHIPS!

[29-Jan-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i see you are in the perfect position to ask ðŸ˜„

[29-Jan-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> Regarding chips not being an asset chain, neither is btc, hush, ltc, bch? All of them listed on the address asset viewer. Chips is based on a KMD address (i.e "can" use the same privkey).

[29-Jan-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> I'm not trying to be a dick. It was a serious question, I'm certainly backing chips and I would imagine will be a major player in the ecosystem. I'm not sure who is responsible for managing dexstats but I use it frequently.

[29-Jan-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> Here is a link https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php

[29-Jan-19 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> Some of the wording used is confusing, calling many "coins" assets.

[29-Jan-19 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> It is also listed under ECOSYSTEM PROJECTS on kmd discord.

[29-Jan-19 11:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie ãƒ„> @ch6ris That a given website can make API calls to different wallets is not indicative of them being of the same base.
CHIPS is a fork of Bitcoin
KMD is a fork of Zcash which is a fork of Bitcoin
"KMD BTC BCH DASH LTC HUSH" (and a thousand others) share the same ancestry, and therefore much of the same base API structure and many core parts/functions.
CHIPS is part of the ecosystem, but isn't part of komodod because of LN (or at least that's the shortest way to describe it)

[29-Jan-19 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> It should be listed on the site, that is all I am saying. As i said I don't know who is responsible for the website.

[dscrd-chips] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> @CHMEX are you taking feature requests? ðŸ˜„

[30-Jan-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jspook16> Is that streamer integrated with chips?

[30-Jan-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jspook16> I'm anxious to lose the few I have

[30-Jan-19 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> @jspook16 the streamer is not integrated with chips. The streamer has been following chips for some time with interest and is waiting for his big chance to play on fully developed software on chips.

[30-Jan-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> it's looking like the front end UI there is working pretty good...and the UI in the repo of the above link will also looks pretty similar to it

[30-Jan-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> @sg777 sorry buddy I dont understand what you are asking

[30-Jan-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> in the streaming video, which he demo playing game has any git repo..

[30-Jan-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> @sg777 thats pokerstars. The streamer is me, I wrote in third person as a joke. I player poker at poker stars and I also test new poker clients out and I am interested in komodo and chips.

[30-Jan-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> I'm also new to streaming

[30-Jan-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> oh great, the front end UI which we had also looks pretty similar to that...

[30-Jan-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> oh nice

[30-Jan-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> good to see you are here, we are pretty much done with backend, and front end UI is also been there and been working on integrating them

[30-Jan-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> thanks I like reviewing poker clients. I am in the middle of reviewing a really big poker site and I was invited to the player testing.

[30-Jan-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> I love crypto but I find it a bit hard to understand

[30-Jan-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> I don't have any computer science or programming background

[30-Jan-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> so when do you think it will be integrated with a player base to play on it?

[30-Jan-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> to the front end, I feel it still going to take couple of weeks to get the fully operational poker...

[30-Jan-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> im not pro with javascript and UI design, so learning by workng, it's taking little more time..

[30-Jan-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> hey, its fine. Most poker sites take months or years to develop poker software and they have big teams and huge budgets. I'm looking forward to seeing what this poker client will look like.

[30-Jan-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> sure, thanks

[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> Hey guys, I have a question. @sg777 @jl777c @jorian Why did you create chips as a separate coin? Why didn't you just make poker and casino software that allows you to bet with Komodo? I don't understand the need for the coin.

[02-Feb-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> KMD doesn't have lightning, CHIPS does

[02-Feb-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> james knows more about the specific reasons

[02-Feb-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> I would never contaminate KMD codebase with segwit

[02-Feb-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> is it just that KMD would not be "fast" (blocktime/confirmation time wise) enough or are there other specific technical reasons besides that

[02-Feb-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> segwit is an abomination, why to integrate it?

[02-Feb-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie ãƒ„> Segwit/LN "works" for what it works for and __none__ of those cases are actual "average currency user" cases (no matter what you read on reddit), so putting it in something like Komodo would be pointless (even assuming all the other issues were worked out)

[02-Feb-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> But why not have deposits in komodo. Players play with chips that represent komodo and when they withdrawal they withdraw komodo. I don't see what the advantage is of chips compared to previous bitcoin poker sites and gambling sites. Also, a bigger poker/gambling site would be more respected with more credibility if it was attached to a bigger coin.

[02-Feb-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> But I am not technical

[02-Feb-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie ãƒ„> ` I don't see what the advantage is of chips compared to previous bitcoin poker sites and gambling sites.`
Because it's an entire gaming platform, not limited to just poker or "gambling".
The idea is to build a platform that nearly any game you can think of can be used on.

[02-Feb-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> Why cant bitcoin be used in any game u can think of?

[02-Feb-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie ãƒ„> Because bitcoin doesn't have any rule sets for games or logic (aside from the currency stuff itself)

[02-Feb-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> That's what I mean, what's the difference between a currency being on a any game u can think of platform and chips being a currency on any game u can think of

[02-Feb-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie ãƒ„> Can you think of a currency that has a card shuffler in the consensus of the coin itself?

[02-Feb-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> No. I mean practically what is the difference for consumer or user?

[02-Feb-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> How is it better than any program on top of a crypto currency

[02-Feb-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie ãƒ„> CHIPS and the platform will not just be used as currency *in* the games, it will contain the consensus rules *for* the games

[02-Feb-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> Sorry buddy, I'm not technical. What does that mean? How is it better?

[02-Feb-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie ãƒ„> Layer apps (on top of the currency) depend on you trusting the app/site to decide and enforce rules
With this idea, rules in the consensus code means that everyone shares the rules, and any time the rules are changed the majority of users must agree to those rules being changed

[02-Feb-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> Oh I see what u mean

[02-Feb-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> So the community change the software together kind of thing.

[02-Feb-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> That's really interesting

[02-Feb-19 02:42 PM] cipi#4502
` Why cant bitcoin be used in any game u can think of?`
Easy answer: Because blocktime of BTC is 10 minutes... i don't think you want to wait 10 minutes or more for a player of poker to place his bet.

[02-Feb-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Vibr> Atomic swaps between LN enabled chains could be possible though, or some time locked contract where one could use any currency externally and chips would be used internally (both balances displayed)?

[02-Feb-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> hmm. now that i read my question it is clear that it was too vague. i did not mean why segwit is not used in KMD, but what technical reasons are there to use CHIPS instead of KMD or BTC for example. @cipi  and @ComputerGenie ãƒ„ already explained it, so i was right to assume that one of the reasons for using CHIPS is confirmation times and CHIPS being not just in-game currency, but part of the games platform itself?

[02-Feb-19 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> I understand better now, thanks guys

[03-Feb-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> LN has many issues, but for a hub and spoke topology it can indeed to very fast transactions, so technically it works for realtime poker. CHIPS is meant to be used via LN for all the games. LN requires segwit

[03-Feb-19 05:42 AM] jspook16#3059
Is it right in assuming that you won't have to "deposit" either? You hold your chips until you place a bet?

[03-Feb-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> you need to open LN channel

[12-Feb-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> does anyone have any idea of the opensource repo that does http response building in C?

[14-Feb-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> you can construct a JSON response and usually the actual reponse is adding a header

[14-Feb-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Feb-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
