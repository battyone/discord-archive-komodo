[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> we wait for sg777. as far as marketing goes, it will need to be grass roots basis, there isnt any ICO, or founders reward for CHIPS, so it is up to community

[20-Mar-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> chips is not a project known as the others (it can be seen from the number of users of this community) and the project will surely be very slow unless there is a reward in KMD. 
sg777 and lj777 works hard but without a serious interest on it, chips will be a nice idea

[20-Mar-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> a full time devs are required to develop GUI

[20-Mar-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> I think, with the hodler of chips, an possibility for launch a funding for the dev and for accelerate developpement of chips

[20-Mar-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> the top 100 have 97% of chips coin

[20-Mar-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> could be a solution too

[20-Mar-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> also with donation

[20-Mar-19 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <kremer> donations didn't work for GRIN

[20-Mar-19 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <kremer> a much more known project than CHIPS

[21-Mar-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> it is possible to calcul the money for the dev and restart the prohect?

[21-Mar-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> there is no need to 'restart' the project. when the underlying tech is mature enough, then we'll just need GUI devs.

[21-Mar-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> but they need the foundation to build on and thats is what @sg777 and @jl777c are doing as we speak

[21-Mar-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> sg777 is doing gui now

[21-Mar-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> thank you for the clarification james. still, if there is one reference GUI that showcases the possibilities then getting others to join will be much easier.
somewhat similar to early BarterDEX by Satinder and HyperDEX followed after that

[21-Mar-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> a gui will mean everything to this project. üöÄ

[21-Mar-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> yes, as gaming is mostly about the UX and eye candy

[21-Mar-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> eye candy is very important these days.

[21-Mar-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> My 80yo neighbor doesn't understand why I am painting over the ugly green gutters on our house with something more modern.

[21-Mar-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> chips withdrawals are disabled on dp atm. üò¶

[21-Mar-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> `sg777 is doing gui now` any chance of a teaser?

[21-Mar-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> Im working on gui, here is the repo:https://github.com/sg777/pangea-poker-frontend

[21-Mar-19 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> With good front Dev things could have much faster..

[21-Mar-19 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I'm learning and taking help from jl, doing the things.

[21-Mar-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> the project need a font end dev?

[21-Mar-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miner707> Maybe additional support won't be a bad idea

[25-Mar-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> we launch this?

[25-Mar-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> all the help is appreciated

[25-Mar-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> CHIPS only has devs and no other resources, so marketing, etc. will need community engagement. assuming it works well, maybe actual usage to spread it

[28-Mar-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> thanks @jl777c and @sg777 for your work.  hope to see soon a gui ready, sure community will help project to grow up üëç

[29-Mar-19 08:40 AM] Chief Crypto#2529
Nice to see this project is still alive. üëç

[03-Apr-19 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> Hi everyone

[03-Apr-19 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> The current status w.r.t to gui development is, I'm been making the changes to the front end to handle the communications across playing nodes. One way I made it done, in that process I added few labels in the front end for that I need the help from some gui dev to review my approach. Any gui dev interested please ping me, I can arrange the test setup if they want to test or like to contribute.

[03-Apr-19 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <ryman112> Hi

[03-Apr-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> Hello

[03-Apr-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miner707> Thanks for the update @sg777  lets make this happen all that needed is a GUI which can get the ball rolling , poker especially online poker it a huge opportunity a Decentralized one is inevitable why not chips/pangea

[03-Apr-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <bluewind> Yep, there is huge profit in poker some people do it for a living and make alot of money from it , so I can imagine people playing on Pangea for a living and cashing out their CHIPS using DEX to buy stable coins .

[03-Apr-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> chips could be the first poker games on real blockchain not on token! üòé

[03-Apr-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> We hope this

[03-Apr-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> This project is awesome

[03-Apr-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> is awesome since i read first row on bitcointalk

[03-Apr-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> Yes for sure. Now the goal is playing poker üòé

[03-Apr-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <brianbalsamique> I can‚Äôt take on a GUI project right now, but I may have a friend or two... (Does anyone know if there‚Äôs a reward or bounty out on this as well?)

[03-Apr-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> yes, there are plenty of CHIPS for bounties

[03-Apr-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miner707> @brianbalsamique  chips will do very well with a gui dev,  only sg777 working on his own üòü

[03-Apr-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <brianbalsamique> @miner707 just sent out a text

[03-Apr-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <brianbalsamique> I have one member of troops_v1 asking ‚ÄúWhat kind of duties?‚Äù

[03-Apr-19 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <brianbalsamique> @miner707 any idea, sir?

[04-Apr-19 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miner707> @brianbalsamique  I believe it just front end Gui implementation for poker games  @sg777 he will know the specifics as for bounties ask jl777

[04-Apr-19 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <brianbalsamique> @miner707 @jl777c @sg777 Theres some interest amongst some of my friends. If anyone with details on what‚Äôs specifically needed right now could DM me that‚Äôd be cool ü§ô

[04-Apr-19 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> @sg777 will know the details. I am sure we can raise some CHIPS bounty for a nice gui

[04-Apr-19 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @brianbalsamique  as mentioned, i take care of the logic, I only need help in aligning the elements in the existing gui, adding new elements and styles...

[04-Apr-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <brianbalsamique> @sg777 @jl777c Is it cool to ask about the bounty? Any rough estimate?

[04-Apr-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <brianbalsamique> @sg777 I might have time to help a bit too this week as well. Can you shoot me some links?

[04-Apr-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> hi @brianbalsamique , the back end is at https://github.com/sg777/bet and front end is available at https://github.com/sg777/pangea-poker-frontend

[04-Apr-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> in order to test what it's been there first you take the bet repo and follow the readme and install the lightning and chips and these are must to start the back end node..

[04-Apr-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> for bet repo checkout the `rest_dev` branch

[04-Apr-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Apr-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ùïÉùï†ùï†ùïãùï´> is it still an nxt asset ?

[04-Apr-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ùïÉùï†ùï†ùïãùï´> I think I need to transfer them over to agama

[04-Apr-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> was never an NXT asset, must be thinking of BET or PANGEA

[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> please take a look on https://lnexplorer.chips.cash it doesn't work

[08-Apr-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> just to give you a brief update on what's happenening so far is, while testing for a 2 players I can see the message size up to 36KB, so I made changes to send/receive messages of size upto 64 KB in the code, in the front end by enabling debug mode(f12) you can see all the backend communications which are happening via front end client...earlier we have used socket read/write..but now since we are using websocket read/write almost in all API's the write logic needs to be changed....for that I'm rewriting the API's with rest_* names to suit to this...the rest_dev looks like a mess now...I'll clean it once this basic addition of all rest API's are done...from here on..I can see in this week I'll finish off writing all the rest API's...the tricky thing here is..now I'm also writing kind of state machine or parsing JSON messages on the front end , based on the method types the front end logic takes a call which messages should be fed to front end UI and which needs to be forwarded to whom at the back end....one can see the the what's been done by setting up the bet node and running thr front-end on localhost in debug mode on browser can see the communications..

[08-Apr-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @miner707  sure, but at this moment we don't have many devs..

[08-Apr-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> @sg777 so we use the `rest_dev` branch with the pangea front end?   i'm just briefing someone to have a look at it and seeing if they can get something testable and working end of month.

[08-Apr-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> so looks like maybe something can be started to dev against the new changes in about a week (maybe 2 weeks) with the changes you want to make?

[09-Apr-19 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes @Mylo(KomodoPioneers)  we have to use `rest_dev` branch with the pangea front end...by this month end we surely be having something to test and play on front end

[09-Apr-19 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> if  any dev wants to play, still one can setup the `master` branch and play via terminal..

[12-Apr-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> Hi, I made poker working with the front end..though in the ui not many things are updated...please check the details here

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I updaed the readme.md, please take a look into it and I mentioned places where I'll be needing help from gui devs...

[12-Apr-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> from here on gui dev can baiscally make it look nice...

[12-Apr-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> any one can access this front end from here http://159.69.23.30/pangea-poker-frontend/client/

[12-Apr-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> at this moment on local host using gui one can play the poker....with little changes to gui and testing is done...from then making it to play over multi-node is a matter of one day work for me...

[12-Apr-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> some of you already set up the back end nodes....just checkout to rest_dev branch and try testing with gui on your local machine..and then we see what information needs to be added on the gui so that looks more user friendly and playable...

[12-Apr-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <bluewind> Nice! great opportunity for a  GUI dev üôÇ  really cool project to work on

[dscrd-chips] <cascrypto> @sg777 question, is their a notary note  runner that is suporting Chips development and marketing? would like to vote on a team that is suporting your develpment of $Chips

[dscrd-chips] <Artist> hi guys

[13-Apr-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> I still feel more than marketing CHIPS project needs developers to help sg777 more

[13-Apr-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> and to support developers, need funds, I guess

[13-Apr-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> marketing comes after products built, solid products, with good documentation

[13-Apr-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> CHIPS project is so ninja type project which is kinda silently moving past all other boasters in industry claiming to excel in blockchain based gaming

[13-Apr-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> GUI dev is what is needed most now

[13-Apr-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Artist> well yeah

[13-Apr-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Artist> that should be the first concern in almost everything

[13-Apr-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
