[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> updated, i think it should work now

when starting lightningd

[16-Jul-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i have chips on dev and lightning on jl777 branch

[16-Jul-18 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> they should both be in sync now

[16-Jul-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> still have errors..

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i see already ðŸ˜…

[16-Jul-18 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> no testnet with james

[16-Jul-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> do you have a node running where we can open channels?

[16-Jul-18 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> not sure how far along you are with everything, but for people to try out lightning channels it might be a nice idea to list some nodes to open channels with?

[16-Jul-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> that is what you are doing!

[16-Jul-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> all right ðŸ˜„ let's see if it works this time

[16-Jul-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> syncing takes a while

[16-Jul-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> managed to get this running though ðŸ˜„

[16-Jul-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> now let's see if it can show me nodes

[16-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> @jl777c do you know if it always needs to add blocks, starting from 2153000 something?

[16-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> when starting lightning daemon?

[16-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> it has to rescan from scratch each time?

[16-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> how can that work for bitcoin

[16-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> well one node does, tested on another node, there it did start from where it left off. so might be my node

[16-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> if it doesnt complete, it might start over, like rescan

[16-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> probably that

[16-Jul-18 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> let me know of any LN troubles. it should just work with all the existing apps. if not, then likely some bug

[16-Jul-18 02:38 PM] jorian#4555
@SHossain chips3.explorer.supernet.org doesn't work anymore

[16-Jul-18 02:38 PM] jorian#4555
is there a replacement?

[16-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> it's iquidus, but http://chips.komodochainz.info/

[16-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> and it can't show lightning: http://chips.komodochainz.info/tx/a944fd67281e8575248d4227924fb7960e02bd2ec188aa9a9868195f38a821b6

[16-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> can insight?

[16-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> no idea

[16-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> lol

[16-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> the downside to testing on the edge ðŸ˜›

[16-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> hehe

[16-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i guess BTC insights support them

[16-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> so i think someone needs to port BTC insight to CHIPS insight

[16-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> need to define a bounty for that

[16-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> http://185.62.57.207:3456 now shows my 2 nodes!

[16-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> cool. let's see how i can get it to show my channel

[16-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> oh it's there already

[17-Jul-18 07:44 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Hi, is CHIPS network fine now? According to explorer last block was mined yesterday and there are no new blocks since then: https://explorer.chips.cash/

[17-Jul-18 07:45 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Tried to swap KMD/CHIPS on BarterDEX - bob deposit taking forever, can't see it on explorer also.

[17-Jul-18 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> it was fine, seems to have stopped

[17-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> and it's going again

[17-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i guess mining 0.04 CHIPS at a time isn't so popular anymore

[17-Jul-18 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> hopefully diff will drop to where CPU mining is possible again

[17-Jul-18 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> if happens, I'll put that on mining on my server where vrsc is mining ðŸ˜›

[dscrd-chips] <Alright> spam

[22-Jul-18 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> Could someone upload a CHIPS bootstrap please?

[22-Jul-18 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> no worries if not, I'm on pace to sync in about 6 hours

[22-Jul-18 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Hmm I think I have one already that's about half the chain

[22-Jul-18 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Doubt its a lot of help, its only up to just under/over 1 mill blocks

[22-Jul-18 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I had chips synced in like 2H on my notary server.

[23-Jul-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> just noticed DNS seeds for CHIPS don't give any peers

[23-Jul-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Jul-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Jul-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> you've made plenty, it's in your best interest to keep the network alive

[23-Jul-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> pay the bill for it and I'll put as much hash as you want ðŸ˜›

[23-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> >make $10ks on CHIPS

[23-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> >can't pay $1 a day to keep it alive

[23-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> no, it's in my best interest to let the diff drop to where I can GPU mine it

[23-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> not going to happen

[23-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> someone is pointing a lot of hash rate at it while the diff is low

[23-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> it will if you stop doing rentals

[23-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> raising the diff and leaving

[23-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> stalling the chain

[23-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> I just paid for a 12 hour rental

[23-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> will stop after that

[23-Jul-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> `someone is pointing a lot of hash rate at it while the diff is low`
That's called "profit switching" and it's only been a feature in NOMP for about 4 years now...

[23-Jul-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> ok and you can't stop people from doing it

[23-Jul-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> therefore you'll never be able to GPU mine it

[23-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> you'd be surprised what I can GPU mine ðŸ˜ˆ

[23-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> your whole farm GPU farm on SHA256 is like 5 s9s

[23-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> less than 5 s9s likely

[23-Jul-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> well, that's 4 more than you said I need

[23-Jul-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> yea your whole 70ksol farm is less than a single s9 if my napkin math is correct

[23-Jul-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> it's not the size of your hash, it's how you use it ðŸ˜ƒ

[23-Jul-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> not to mention the fact that equihash sols != sha256 hashes

[23-Jul-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> been a while indeed

[24-Jul-18 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> someone dumped the price of CHIPS, doesn't help either

[24-Jul-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> i had buy orders waiting, so worked quite nicely for me ðŸ˜ƒ

[24-Jul-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> oh thats nice

[24-Jul-18 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> just buying occasionally. a lot of stuff is on sale, better to use the chance

[24-Jul-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> doesn't mean that we can't get even lower tho :abusedsmily:

[24-Jul-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Yes it seems I should have sold a lot more CHIPS at the end of last year and been greedy ðŸ˜¦ lol

[24-Jul-18 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> you had to pay for mining equipment if i remember correctly, right

[24-Jul-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> _just used his BTC equipment because CHIPS had more value to mine than BTC_
