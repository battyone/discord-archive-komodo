hey there, if anyone wants to run a Chips full node on an arm64/arm v8 such as a rock64 or a nanopi, I did a build last night, which was quite a pain! and am running it, so I posted binaries on my site at https://janemercer.us if anyone cares to download them.

Are you a React JS dev, or do you know a React JS Dev?

CHIPS is looking for a React Developer who can assist with GUI configuration for the newly create CHIPS Poker GUI. 
Below is a sample of what is to come! @hyperDEX is busy working with a developer to create a fresh new look for CHIPS.

Hi @Decker 
I'd like to add verushash 2.0 algo into yiimp opensource project. I need C code for this.
I noticed you have this https://github.com/DeckerSU/verushash-example but I think that it is for verushash 1.1 but dukeleto is adding verushash 2 into chips.
I noticed that you forked ccminer to add verushash 1.1 and you forked yiimp (but I did not see any new commits).
Can you help me ?

little suggestion guys, it will also be great and valuable to create a VC section on all the komodo related channels, especially on KOMODO, starting with RedFox, starchain capital and more to come.

Chips seems like an interesting project. Why is the market volume so low?

[07-Jul-19 01:35 PM] phm87#7395
Most is already mined so there is no pool with autoswitch that dumps any chips. Holders hodls and do not sell on CEX. You will find few OTC sellers on chips'discord or on Bartelly.

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> now one can play the poker game remotely by just running one player node using the old GUI remotely provided there is `DCV` and `BVV` nodes are up running...the branches one need to consider for this are `poker_test` of `pangea-poker-frontend ` and `bet` repos...I'm updating the instructions to start the node in the backend and to play using the GUI shortly in the README file and share some video regarding it.......apart from that with the new GUI pixelshove is developing I guess he is close...

[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> For those that were interested in a CHIPS mobile wallet. Chameleon v3 wallet has been released and has CHIPS support! Not only that, you can store your KMD and other assetchains on there. I'd highly recommend the wallet and would like to thank @PTYX and @Instel7 for adding support for us. Please check out your native app store for Chameleon Pay.

[09-Jul-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <pixelshove> Here is the gameplay demo of the GUI. 

The video recorded the pixels 1 to 1 so it looks a bit mushy. But be assured that it's much more crisp in real life (since pretty much every graphic is a vector).

Keep in mind that the first testable version will be considerably slower than what you see here due to latency occurring while communicating with the backend. It's something that we will need to work on for better UX.

Can you recommend any desktop (PC) wallet for CHIPS? (Litemode, spv, not full sync)

[11-Jul-19 02:36 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
You can use the verus agama in lite mode, but people have reported a few errors trying to send funds. Otherwise you have ChipsQT that requires full sync, or we have just been added to the Chameleon v3 app, if a mobile wallet suits your fancy.
