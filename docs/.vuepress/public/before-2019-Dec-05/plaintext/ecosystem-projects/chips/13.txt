[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> OK
1) I've personally done more for keeping the CHIPS chain moving in the last year than anyone in this convo besides jl
2) I'm not "refusing to help", I'm refusing to hash at a high expense when the plan is to switch to an algo with less operational overhead (albeit added equipment overhead)
3) I know for a fact it can currently be GPU mined (albeit slowly and at a diff higher than ZEC)
4) I keep talking because I'm feken me and that's how I feken do me (you go on and do you)

[29-Aug-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> So with 50TH, it sounds like the chain will be mostly consistent?

[29-Aug-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> if so, I guess the question is what the cost of a miner that can do that is

[29-Aug-18 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> if the 1 miner with CHIPS in his profitswitcher isn't a factor, then yes 50 should be plenty

[29-Aug-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> as for cost, ~$2k for someone to start from nothing

[29-Aug-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> maybe something like: https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/asicminer/8-nano-compact

[29-Aug-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> it says compact, but it is 40kg!

[29-Aug-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> nano compact

[29-Aug-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> @ $4500 USD, I'd still have to go with 4 Antminers

[29-Aug-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> who is mining CHIPS now?

[29-Aug-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> the blocks are steady

[29-Aug-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> how many time for mine the 5k chips?

[29-Aug-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> @0x03 's pool had like 16TH on it when I looked last

[29-Aug-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> @helios with current rewards, it's take a loooooooooooong while to mine 5k CHIPS

[29-Aug-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <cipi> yes, http://136.243.227.136:8080/ is his pool ... and  i have a NH-order pointing to that pool

[29-Aug-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> it is possible to calculated date?

[29-Aug-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> @jl777c a combination of my pool and exactly one other dude (the smaller miner i mentioned)

[29-Aug-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> `it is possible to calculated date?`
23.7 days if you hit every block (if I added correctly)

[29-Aug-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> thats whats happening now, and i'm hitting about every 5-6 blocks

[29-Aug-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> (the proof would be to turn off my pool again and wait until he jumps back off, which he did a couple of times before. but i'm pretty sure i'm right)

[29-Aug-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> if only NH didnt enforce a hilarious min diff of 1meg. actually every share thats happening on the pool is a valid block then, theres just not a lot of stuff >=1meg

[29-Aug-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> when the chips are fully mined --> moon

[29-Aug-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> with the diff running at 1-6million, it's almost insane how many more blocks a rental would get if not for NH's proxy algo

[29-Aug-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> he probably just left again, which means we're hitting 100% of the blocks, anytime a share >1meg happens.

[29-Aug-18 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> @blackjok3r i think we may have had a misunderstanding. i was asking about the 5000 bounty that I had heard was KMD, and as I understood it was needed and didn't expect it to be a lot of work, thought I might just do it and get the bounty. As we talked, I started to feel I might be taking an opportunity that others already wanted. I probably didn't have the time anyways, so I offered to help instead. I can help a lot more than I have, for no bounty, if it can help. let me know what issues you have, and if you'd like to get it done still, maybe we can just solve them üòÉ

[29-Aug-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> do you have a repo that you started modifying?

[29-Aug-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i think he shared it yes

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> shameless copy:

[29-Aug-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> 9:37 AM] blackjok3r:
I believe all you'd need is to replace the blockhash with the VerusHash block hash. To do that, you'd want to use haraka* and verus_hash.* from the crypto directory, and to move SerializeVerusHash and VerusHashWriter from hash.h in the src directory to your hash.h. You should also copy the hash function pointer and selection from CBlockHeader to support portability and performance and make it easier to port. Then, at runtime, just make sure to call CVerusHash::Init() and select your hash function to set the function pointer. Of course, with a height dependent change, you may want the main hash function for CBlockHeader to just select between what you use now and VerusHash. I think that would cover everything.
(edited)
[9:38 AM] blackjok3r: All I left out, was the actual height activation and CVerusHash::Init()  call.
[9:38 AM] blackjok3r: but it will not compile

[29-Aug-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> I did a PR on that repo to fix two issues with the build:
1. I separated portable and fast VerusHash source builds with different flags and made the compilation independent of the machine being compiled on. That solved the first build issues.
2. I saw that there are issues in the code that need fixing, which show up as more build issues. I assume @blackjok3r can continue with these once the issue in #1 is gone. I did fix the first one of this type of build issue, which was just a definition of VERSION in CBlockHeader. It looks like the others are similarly fixed by matching call function parameters, etc.
Let me know if you need more help.

[29-Aug-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> I just went ahead and added fixes for the rest of the build issues into the PR. haven't tested it, but aside from the things breaking the build, the changes all looked reasonable.

[29-Aug-18 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Thanks a lot man.

[29-Aug-18 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I will test this out today and see if it works.

[30-Aug-18 12:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> very cool, Mike beat me to it

[30-Aug-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> @miketout  thank you good sir! üôÇ üëç

[30-Aug-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> I can try compiling it on my local linux vm right now

[30-Aug-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> I just got back from something and saw I missed a link problem. reorging the make file and fixing now

[30-Aug-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> @grewalsatinder might want to wait a few minutes

[30-Aug-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> sure, preping my VM until then

[30-Aug-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> are you compiling without gui ?
I used this config params:
`./configure --without-gui --enable-upnp-default --enable-hardening`

[30-Aug-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> mketout/verushash branch

[30-Aug-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> will wait for go signal before redoing autogen and configure

[30-Aug-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> it's just taking a long time to build on this machine, and i'm making another change.

[30-Aug-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> using those params now

[30-Aug-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> did you add the actual call to use the algo or height activate it? 
I was just trying to get the right functions into the code at first as I wansnt too sure about how to do that.

[30-Aug-18 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> cool, please tag me, and I'll also issue build command üôÇ

[30-Aug-18 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> no. i assumed you were going to do that. last thing I had to do was rearrange the makefile because the headers were getting pulled in to many unnecessary places

[30-Aug-18 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> i think it's good, but i want to wait until the end üòÉ

[30-Aug-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> yeah, but then I saw you message that you making changes, so stopped after ./configure command üòÅ

[30-Aug-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> coz past experience says if I try to compile on same compiled code sometimes it doesn't give the result as we expect from fresh clone

[30-Aug-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> that was the right thing üòÉ i mean with what i haven't checked in yet

[30-Aug-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> saving myself from clone and comile again by waiting for go signal üòÑ

[30-Aug-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> have to build again... build takes a long time. actual changes are small. hopefully, I don't need another

[30-Aug-18 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> because it's a link issue, i need to change makefile and build clean each time

[30-Aug-18 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> ok, it's all fixed. they were the tests. make files reorged to be part of the PR, and it builds completely fine now

[30-Aug-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> @grewalsatinder

[30-Aug-18 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> okay, issuing compile command üôÇ

[30-Aug-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> didn't compile

[30-Aug-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> fresh pull after I said? from what repo?

[30-Aug-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> and branch?

[30-Aug-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> and then did git pull, got your updates, and then did that auto and config and make commands

[30-Aug-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> i think i didn't do a fully clean build at the end. let me check if i need to remove verus_hash.cpp from libbitcoinconsensus

[30-Aug-18 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> so do I wait for another git update and then try or just try with clean clone? ü§î

[30-Aug-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> unfortunately, i'd recommend either fixing the Makefile.am there, or waiting. i have to do a fully clean build to check. building now

[30-Aug-18 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> okay, I'll wait. will move on to other task I'm doing alongside üôÇ

[30-Aug-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> good morning. i love what has happened here over night. üòÉ

[30-Aug-18 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> haha still somethings to get done, I will come back to it once I have the scale test stuff finished, I have been putting it off for the whole week so far working on other things. Thanks very much to @miketout on this one, only a height activation left. üòÑ

[30-Aug-18 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> hah. wicked. thanks a lot mike

[30-Aug-18 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> tried fresh clone. didn't compile. here's full log.
https://defuse.ca/b/7wTNasSdsXvrWHNyVgQoCb

[30-Aug-18 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> gonna check if I can do something about it

[30-Aug-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> problems with it in or out because of tests. just a dep/build issue, but takes so long to check. looking deeper

[30-Aug-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> hm... ü§î

[30-Aug-18 06:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> you can try what is there now. it built for me, but I selectively deleted the object files I thought mattered to avoid the time of a full clean build. doing that now. i think this one works.

[30-Aug-18 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> had shut down my vm. going to try again

[30-Aug-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> going to try on fresh clone

[30-Aug-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> this one does work

[30-Aug-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> clean, complete build

[30-Aug-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> had to move things around a bit

[30-Aug-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> yes mine is still compiling

[30-Aug-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> have not broke in between yet

[30-Aug-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> @miketout yes compiled fine without any issues

[30-Aug-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
