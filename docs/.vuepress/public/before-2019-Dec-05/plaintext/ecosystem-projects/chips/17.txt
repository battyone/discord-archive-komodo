[dscrd-chips] <crumb> scroll up please. nice and quite thorough overview what is happening was given on the 27th of december @AlexMasi

[30-Dec-18 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> if you want to see GUI-s then you're still early. it's strictly CLI for now

[30-Dec-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <AlexMasi> Thank you will look

[30-Dec-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Is machine with GNOME needed or it's CLI only?

[02-Jan-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <LocoMB> Good News!

[dscrd-chips] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> awesome thanks @sg777 i'm building a node to get my docker image from august updated.  said i'd do this a week ago, sorry for delay.  congrats on getting to this stage!   happy new year!!

[03-Jan-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> @sg777 Following this guide https://github.com/sg777/bet/tree/poker on fresh Ubuntu 18.04 machine.
On step  ``` ./configure --with-boost=/usr/local/``` from `# Installing CHIPS`
At first I get: ```checking for Berkeley DB C++ headers... default
configure: error: Found Berkeley DB other than 4.8, required for portable wallets (--with-incompatible-bdb to ignore or --disable-wallet to disable wallet functionality)
```
Then if I run ``` ./configure --with-boost=/usr/local/ --with-incompatible-bdb```
```checking for boostlib >= 1.47.0... yes
checking whether the Boost::System library is available... yes
configure: error: Could not find a version of the boost_system library!
```

[03-Jan-19 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Should I change branch to `poker` on this step?
```#Installing Bet

$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/sg777/bet.git```

[03-Jan-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Seems I've build all the software according to guide. What should I do next to grind? 😃

[03-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> hi @TonyL  great...

[03-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> do you also clone lightning and chips repo's..

[03-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Yes I did

[03-Jan-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> in one node are you doing?

[03-Jan-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Yep

[03-Jan-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> cd bet/privatebet

[03-Jan-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> then run `./bet player 159.69.23.30`

[03-Jan-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> to start the playing node...since on that IP I just started to run the DCV..

[03-Jan-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> how actually it works is there are two nodes DCV(Dealer) and BVV(Blinder) and the playing nodes connect to DCV where the table formation happens...then players, DCV and BVV involve in the process of deck shuffling..then card distribution with round betting happens

[03-Jan-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> does your LN has any funds, initially the playing nodes sets up the channels of 0.05 CHIPS with DCV

[03-Jan-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> I dont have any CHIPS

[03-Jan-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> run this `./lightning-cli newaddr`

[03-Jan-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> and give me the address...I'll deposit some to play..

[03-Jan-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Ok, thanks 👍  Will take some time - moving now all stuff on VPS since ran out of HDD capacity on laptop

[03-Jan-19 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> sure..

[03-Jan-19 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Faced one more problem:
```./chips-cli getinfo
./chips-cli: error while loading shared libraries: libboost_system.so.1.64.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory```

[03-Jan-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Lib which I have is more fresh: ```/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_system.so.1.65.1

[03-Jan-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Got this error for `chips-cli` from `/bet/privatebet`

[03-Jan-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> `cp chips-cli /usr/bin` # just need to get chips-cli to work from command line
`sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib` # thanks smaragda!

[03-Jan-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> I put path to `chips-cli` to $PATH to start lightingd sync

[03-Jan-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Should I use `chips-cli` from `chips3` or `bet` ?

[03-Jan-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> use chips-cli from chips3

[03-Jan-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Jan-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Seems I'm on right network

[03-Jan-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> 3 million blocks syncing will take some time hehe

[03-Jan-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes...I made some tx of 0.2 CHIPS, once that get synced you can see in `./lightning-cli listfunds`, since its in the very begining stages we will play with small bets..

[03-Jan-19 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Thanks! Will try to connect dealer node as soon as it synced

[03-Jan-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> sure, not sure why i copied `chips-cli` into privatebet, I just removed it from privatebet..now no confusion, thanks.

[03-Jan-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @jorian , like the way we have kmd bot to give tips, is it possible to have one such chips-bot for tips, so that whoever active gets some chips which they can use to test or play..

[03-Jan-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> anyone who are aware of how these bots works and what needs to be done, please do let me know I'll set up one for chips and thinking of giving away few of them...

[03-Jan-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <KomodoWorld> about the gui, is there any dev interested to work on it? I remember a pangea prototype years ago, with a video. Is that code still available and useful as a starting point?

[03-Jan-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes, that very initial pangea prototype, now one can actually play texas holdem poker using the pangea protocol..

[03-Jan-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <KomodoWorld> and so it's possible to adapt that gui to the current underlying tech? Only need someone that can do the job

[03-Jan-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <KomodoWorld> that makes a full release more likely within 2019

[03-Jan-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <KomodoWorld> I was just thinking how to help, I can add a bounty for the gui

[03-Jan-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes, that's the plan, I can make backend however that suits to the GUI....

[03-Jan-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> as we develop more stable CLI and add support to more games, hopefully GUI devs pitch in...

[03-Jan-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <KomodoWorld> I can't remember if there some revenue for gui devs from pangea/bet assets, like for barterdex gui

[03-Jan-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> don't know, but I remember jl asked jorian to look for GUI devs...

[03-Jan-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Lighting syncing quite slow, seems I'll be ready only tomorrow
