[discord] <jl777c> I think  the question is will the other players trust your table that you run? All the code is open source but if a table is full of colluding players, no amount of tech will solve that. The dealers that can create tables without colluders will have an advantage

[13-Jun-18 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> all the nodes get all the encrypted data and after a hand it can be decrypted to verify it is valid

[13-Jun-18 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> M players would have to collude to break the MofN encryption, with M set to be N/2+1

[13-Jun-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> but from what I know in poker, just having two players colluding can influence the outcome significantly by their betting/folding without needing to break the encryption

[13-Jun-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> so more than half. if you run a 6-player table, that means 4 need to collude to break encryption; the other 2 will notice that quite fast and will leave the table

[13-Jun-18 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> yes, i did that too with friends. you can't stop that

[13-Jun-18 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> yes such tables wont be popular at all. the most popular dealers will have a mix of human players and not bots but also not 100% pros either

[13-Jun-18 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> this is more a social problem and I dont see any magic tech that prevents  2 players from skyping privately their hole cards

[13-Jun-18 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> no. maybe a reputation system that only allows reputable players

[13-Jun-18 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> we can make the tech that enables blockchain enforced poker rules and cryptographically verifiable decks

[13-Jun-18 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> leaves the question: how do you measure reputation

[13-Jun-18 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> i think it needs to start with people playing with people they know, from that a reputation system can be created over time

[13-Jun-18 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> coinpoker has a justice system. haven't looked at it closely

[13-Jun-18 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> true

[13-Jun-18 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> but outside of MofN collusion, the CHIPS wont enable any cheating that cant already be done

[13-Jun-18 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> I assume there will be service providers eventually to provide a reputation, or maybe something like VRSC can be used

[13-Jun-18 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> CHIPS will create the tech that allows anybody to setup a fair poker table

[13-Jun-18 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> just like barterDEX allows anybody to be a bob

[13-Jun-18 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> given a DB of hand history of all the players, it should be possible to get a pretty good indication of which pubkeys are honest and which ones are not

[13-Jun-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> hmm yes, but you can always change pubkeys

[13-Jun-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> but I think the best bot detector is the poker pro

[13-Jun-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> true

[13-Jun-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> a fresh pubkey becomes a newbie

[13-Jun-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> dont trust newbies

[13-Jun-18 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> the primary value a dealer might provide a table is bot detection and that could justify a higher rake

[13-Jun-18 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> but really all this is getting way ahead of things. Once there is a large enough pool of players, reputation system, hand histories, it seems that this is a solvable matter. We still need to get the blockchain enforced payout to work. Making it so only the blockchain is holding table funds makes it trustless for the most important part

[13-Jun-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> dealers wont have the real funds, just CHIPS satoshis being LN back and forth, so maybe a dishonest dealer can run off with 0.1 CHIPS, we ignore such silly dealers

[13-Jun-18 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Robert Naus> I see , so basically you start as a private friendly game and build your reputation and eventually people will trust you and play, itâ€™s a long process that will take years, but it may work at the end.

[13-Jun-18 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> gaining trust in the online poker community is going to be a marathon anyways

[13-Jun-18 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Robert Naus> Eventually you get like 100x if not 1000x of nodes running games and u can have very large players pool, especially if you able to somehow show all the nodes running and players playing so there is a large selection of games

[13-Jun-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Robert Naus> The fact that anyone can play from anywhere in the world is the major selling point, as this has been nearly impossible lately and will be totally shot down soon

[13-Jun-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> yes. anyone can be a dealer, that's very cool

[13-Jun-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> dealers that choose to publish their tables will be able to be seen by all the network

[13-Jun-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> so we get public tables and private tables

[13-Jun-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> totally decentralized

[13-Jun-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> seems a good solution

[13-Jun-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> and of course this will be a years long process

[13-Jun-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> maybe some dealers invest money to jump start things

[13-Jun-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> or maybe some smaller online poker company.

[13-Jun-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> regardless of the details of how things propagate, CHIPS is the coin

[13-Jun-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> also poker is just one usecase, most other games can also be supported and that is where i expect a fair amount of third party solutions

[13-Jun-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> exactly why i created #pangea-poker , because i think you said this before: any game that uses a deterministically determined result, can be used as an application in the BET platform, right?

[13-Jun-18 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> yes

[13-Jun-18 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> roullete, slot machines, etc. entire casino could be decentralized

[13-Jun-18 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> maybe CHIPS are casino chips, not just poker chips

[13-Jun-18 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <helios> why not starting project with simply game (roulette) and for the future biuld an entire casino

[13-Jun-18 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> because solving decentralized poker is much more difficult and the idea is to make sure we can solve any decentralization problem. solving poker is a good indication we did. solving roullete, not so much

[13-Jun-18 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> also I have no desire to build a casino, but rather build the tools that allow others to build their casinos

[13-Jun-18 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <helios> good idea

[13-Jun-18 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> Expect a dICO soon for the first truly decentralized casino

[13-Jun-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> as a technology provider, our role is to provide the tech (with reference implementations)

[13-Jun-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> but let others make the money creating end user solutions

[13-Jun-18 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <helios> do you have an idea for the mainnet release? When the mining is stopping (only 9k coin for mining) an event?

[13-Jun-18 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> testing hasn't even started

[13-Jun-18 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> i think it's fair to say it's not gonna happen in 2018

[13-Jun-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> mining will take a long time to fuly stop. halvings go on until 1 satoshi

[13-Jun-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <helios> we hope testnet on 2018

[13-Jun-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> coinexchange.io got away with CHIPS, or that wallet is still expected to come back online?

[13-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> I have like 31k CHIPS there. from old old days.

[13-Jun-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CHMEX> @coinexchange.io ^ are you still around to help?

[13-Jun-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <coinexchange.io> Yes, will look into this right now

[13-Jun-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> awesome! glad to hear from you. would be really great if you also leave a lil notification of it's online status. if that's too much that's OK. will be checking back the website again.

[13-Jun-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <coinexchange.io> Will do

[13-Jun-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> thanks mate

[13-Jun-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <coinexchange.io> CHIPS is back online - sorry for the delays

thanks! ðŸ˜ƒ 
withdrawn

[14-Jun-18 07:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
all of it

[14-Jun-18 07:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It's really good time if ANYONE wants to withdraw from the exchange.
I see there is no UTXO issue at all.

[14-Jun-18 07:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
You can request withdraw request of your whole balance in just one withdraw request.

[14-Jun-18 03:16 PM] Mark81#4505
Just read posts of colluding players. I thought simpless solution for that would be that player would not be allowed to choose on what table he sits. So it would be randomly selected and if player leaves table by trying to get into another table there would be precaution note  in next table for other players of  player that suffles between tables.

[14-Jun-18 03:17 PM] Mark81#4505
@jl777c

[14-Jun-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> if the playerpool is small you are still very likely to end up on a table with someone you know, especially when multitabling

[14-Jun-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <allbits> I think the main point is that in this decentralized technology it is up to dealers to innovate ways to make their tables more safe. And it is up to players to decide which solutions they prefer. There may emerge solutions that nobody has thought before. That is what is so powerful about offering a platform like this - it allows endless experimentation and innovation.

[14-Jun-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> certainly randomly assigning playrs to tables is one way, but it wont really work until there are a lot of players. also if bots somehow invade, then 90% of players can be bots. I think ultimately it will take human expert judgment to identify bots. if we get bots that play in a way that cant be differentiated from human play, then, well it passes the turing test so it deserves a seat at the table

[15-Jun-18 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> I have a possible game to play based on https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4465642.msg40036023#msg40036023

Game Theory question about segmented staking
Game Theory question about segmented staking

[15-Jun-18 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> it has nothing to do with CHIPS, but it would be a game where the goal is to maximize the efficiency of your coins via clever allocation across the segments

[15-Jun-18 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> if we can get more than a few people interested, we can start a new PoS chain

[15-Jun-18 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> for the game

[15-Jun-18 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> do i see similarities to notary mining here?

[15-Jun-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> not really as there are no limits on staking, other than min utxo age

[15-Jun-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> 64 is the same number as number of notaries though, there is that

[15-Jun-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> each of the 64 segments are a separate battle for staking, but after 128 seconds all segments are eligible

[15-Jun-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> so the optimal allocation is to find all the segments with significantly less than average coins so it gets disproportionate staking

[15-Jun-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> however, everybody likes free money so any segid that is significantly easy should get more coins added. that is the game

[15-Jun-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> multiplayer and runs in parallel

[15-Jun-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> we would need a tool that displays the total coins by segid

[15-Jun-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> what's the reason for trying this? a better PoS?

[15-Jun-18 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
I think it makes it so majority stake isnt enough for 51%

[15-Jun-18 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe 67% stake is needed, not sure the exact threshold

[15-Jun-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> i'll definitely help out

[15-Jun-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> maybe we need to create a channel and get people who want to help in there

[15-Jun-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> and spread it in komodo discord?

[15-Jun-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> since it is a game, I thought of CHIPS. we can promote free coins and a game/competition

[15-Jun-18 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <crumb> can i be of any help if i'm not a coder?

[15-Jun-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> if you can send funds to addresses you can play the allocation game

[15-Jun-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> basically the funds in each segid is your position and the game is to get a disproportionate return

[15-Jun-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> form example, let us say the 90% stake holder is lazy and just has it all in one address

[15-Jun-18 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> and the 10% holder is more active and spreads his 10% across all the 64 segids. since 63/64 of the time the 10% stake holder is unopposed, he will win a disproportionate number of blocks, possible 3x or more than what he should get

[15-Jun-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <crumb> good to know, that i'd be able to help a bit! 
are we going to do it with chips or will there be a custom token for this specific purpose? and if new, how will it be initially distributed? faucet?
