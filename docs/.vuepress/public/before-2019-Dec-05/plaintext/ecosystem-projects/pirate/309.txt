@jeezy was there issues with @Polly üê¶  past couple of days? I noticed my miner switched over to another pool yesterday and the day before. Just wondering if my miner has issues or not

[13-Nov-18 12:16 PM] jeezy#3408
@Steve Lee  there were some random daemon crashes yes, I did some stuff to maybe prevent it in the future

[13-Nov-18 12:18 PM] Steve10#5203
@jeezy ok. I was concerned about the miner itself. Growing pains

1 in 5 shot at winning on theminingpool.com, 1 in 11 on piratechain.org, 1 in 237 on piratepool. 1 in 19 on polly,  aaaaaand 1 in 3 on .black.

[13-Nov-18 01:33 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'll make a new graphic up with items in it at some point. that might help. I want people to open packages, laugh heartily and be super stoked at the same time.

[13-Nov-18 01:35 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Is someone like.... spam buying on the exchange? There is a crapton of 0.00050000 ARRR buys.

[13-Nov-18 01:52 PM] dokrates#8987
withdrawals and deposits are disabled on digitalprices for ARRR

[13-Nov-18 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, required maintenance. seems people are using deposit zaddr as their pool addresses, even though they shouldnt.

Is there a rough timeframe on a sapling implementation?

[13-Nov-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
worst case, Q2 next year

[13-Nov-18 01:59 PM] Godballz#9524
Oh ok cool that's not too bad. Pirate will be unstoppable at that point. It would have all advantages with none of the drawbacks

[13-Nov-18 02:03 PM] Godballz#9524
I love the concept to execution on this project and I see no reason for it to not be the top privacy choice. I know if i just started and knew nothing- based solely on the technical advantages- I would choose pirate. I dont see any reason to settle for less when privacy is your aim and so it should only be a matter of time before pirate catches like wildfire

keep in mind native sapling support is different (and easier) than SPV support for sapling

[13-Nov-18 02:05 PM] Godballz#9524
Fortunately you jumped on the idea and made it a reality and are first out with it. I imagine other privacy coins trying to imitate the features

[13-Nov-18 02:05 PM] Godballz#9524
Oh ok so does that mean native sapling may be out sooner

[13-Nov-18 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
strange thing is we could have done this 2 years ago... nobody bothered to push for it, once we see the chain, then dPoW begs to be implemented

Damn well you still did it first. Dpow is another great advantage of komodo. Komodo has been ahead of the curve from the start and it blows my mind it didn't replaced btc out the gates but again coming in first has its advantages

[13-Nov-18 02:09 PM] Godballz#9524
Which is why pirate is positioned so well to strike while the iron hasn't been touched by anyone else yet. And it has a cool name hah

people are mining to deposit addresses

[13-Nov-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
this creates a fragmented wallet

[13-Nov-18 02:15 PM] Godballz#9524
Ugh who does that?

[13-Nov-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it needs to be defragemented via zmergetoaddress

[13-Nov-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
be patient, it will come back

[13-Nov-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
but plz stop asking every 10 minutes about it

[13-Nov-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it will take hours, maybe a day

[13-Nov-18 02:16 PM] Godballz#9524
Could that be why I cant even open my glitchy rvn wallet on android? Prob 10,000 uxtos

[13-Nov-18 02:16 PM] Godballz#9524
Hah I assume it was a bad idea to mine to it

[13-Nov-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt help. normal taddr utxo wallet does bog down at 10000 utxos

[13-Nov-18 02:17 PM] Godballz#9524

[13-Nov-18 02:18 PM] Godballz#9524
Sorry but do you know if it'd help or change anything if I sent my full balance back to myself to consolodate?

[13-Nov-18 02:19 PM] Godballz#9524
Eh nevermind it was just a curiosity, I've mostly solved the issue by importing priv keys anyway. Thanks for the info

[13-Nov-18 02:39 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@jl777c if users not listening maybe we shall ask pool owners to not only set frequencies payouts but also limits like minimum payment 1k Arrr for rate = 1 a day and no payment limit for rate = monthly; this way small miners (my guess smaller are also less informed - dont care about mining to CEX addr) will get payment monthly (and not be able to spam  cex) and bigger will take it more often... it "centralizes mining" around bigger miners, but wont kill cex ?

[13-Nov-18 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it is an idea

[13-Nov-18 02:40 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
simple analyzis by DP could set the treshold

[13-Nov-18 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe just charge 1 ARRR per payment

[13-Nov-18 02:40 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
what Arr tresh best 1k Arrr or 500Arrr

[13-Nov-18 02:42 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
on DP side would be good if they detect more then N=? 3 ? utxo's and merge them in some cron job daily ?
