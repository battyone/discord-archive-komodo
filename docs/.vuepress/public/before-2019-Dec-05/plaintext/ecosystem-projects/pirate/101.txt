is there a reason why the #zerozed channel was moved into the pirate channel?

[02-Oct-18 03:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
They just wanted in on some of this infamy 😃

Would be nice if Piratebay would accept PIRATE 😄

[02-Oct-18 06:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you want to donate PIRATE that bad, I accept all donations

Get the shop plugin done and I will get Pirate Bay to take  ARRR

[02-Oct-18 06:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It's only logical

[02-Oct-18 06:28 PM] xRobeSx#5136
doesn't PiratePay just take donations? I don't think there's anything to purchase that would require a plugin

[02-Oct-18 06:28 PM] Llama#1330
this is not false

[02-Oct-18 06:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Monetizing a torrent site who's main focus is illegal torrents is the antithesis of the point of torrents for illegal downloads 🤦🏼

[02-Oct-18 06:37 PM] Hot#2427
wasn't bittorrent bought by tron or something

[02-Oct-18 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[02-Oct-18 06:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Then I will get them to take Pirate.

[02-Oct-18 07:39 PM] zatJUM#9924
same chart for 1 week, can't see any change

[02-Oct-18 07:40 PM] Flexatron#8809
Only showing couple of blocks

[02-Oct-18 07:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_needs to stop having 6 convos at once_

[02-Oct-18 07:44 PM] CHMEX#0686
@zatJUM check again restarted the ui

[02-Oct-18 07:45 PM] Flexatron#8809
Higher highs, higher lows🚀

[02-Oct-18 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
is there a way to make it do a much bigger range of blocks?

[02-Oct-18 07:49 PM] CHMEX#0686
I will check. Do you know if that info is stored in the block? Might be a good idea to extract and show.

[02-Oct-18 07:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, in the form of net diff

[02-Oct-18 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
"difficulty": 5.228721290630215,

[02-Oct-18 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
from getblock

[02-Oct-18 07:53 PM] CHMEX#0686
Right there it is thanks I will have something in a few hours. Seems like a good info to show.

[02-Oct-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
diff isnt msols, but both are approx anyway

[02-Oct-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
and seeing that over long term is better than not seeing it

[02-Oct-18 07:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CHMEX Are the block info and chart on 2 different loops?

[02-Oct-18 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
specifically, as it pertains to filling the db

[02-Oct-18 07:58 PM] CHMEX#0686
No idea how it does that to be honest might find out tomorrow

[02-Oct-18 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because the diff info has to already be in the db, otherwise it wouldn't show when you look up a block

[02-Oct-18 08:00 PM] CHMEX#0686
True

[02-Oct-18 08:06 PM] zatJUM#9924

I didn't mean that the way it looks

[02-Oct-18 08:39 PM] CHMEX#0686
ow ok sorry than
Do we know when the first pIRATE notarization happened

[02-Oct-18 08:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

For those that don't know, which is pretty much everyone, @Alright  is generally the 1st person I ask such things and it honestly wasn't a troll (he's just generally that knowledgeable about what we do)

[02-Oct-18 08:42 PM] Alright#0419
was a good troll though

[02-Oct-18 08:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, but unintentionally so 😦

[02-Oct-18 08:43 PM] CHMEX#0686
thanks webworker so around block 37700 around the time it increased from 10m to 100m

[02-Oct-18 08:43 PM] Alright#0419
had to think about it for a minute

[02-Oct-18 08:43 PM] Alright#0419
didn't think about it until CHMEX said not nice

[02-Oct-18 08:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Wasn't the peer-banning in the 36k range?

[02-Oct-18 08:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or was that a diff issue or something?

[02-Oct-18 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
