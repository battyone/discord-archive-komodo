it has a very important role

[05-Oct-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
using non-BTC low cost chains

[05-Oct-18 01:38 PM] house#8741
so essentially saying btc will be like mechanical engineering ?

[05-Oct-18 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆🏼 that makes the framer in me giggle

[05-Oct-18 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nothing in the world is more tedious than building a home for a mechanical engineer :trollface:

[05-Oct-18 01:40 PM] 0x03#8822
are there any details one could think of that would make BTC disappear a lot earlier than 'the couple of decades' james mentioned?

[05-Oct-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
first it needs to be displaced as #1 crypto marketcap. do you suggest ETH or XRP for that?

[05-Oct-18 01:41 PM] 0x03#8822
i see

[05-Oct-18 01:41 PM] xRobeSx#5136
how about KMD

[05-Oct-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
or BCH or EOS or Stellar!?

[05-Oct-18 01:42 PM] 0x03#8822
Elicoin :trollface:

[05-Oct-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
or LTC or ADA

[05-Oct-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
hmmm. nothing seems to, hey there is tether next!

[05-Oct-18 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`are there any details one could think of that would make BTC disappear a lot earlier than 'the couple of decades' james mentioned?`
None that don't involve a prolonged prison sentence 😦

[05-Oct-18 01:42 PM] 0x03#8822
by what i KNOW i think that KMD should be a top contender for the market cap

[05-Oct-18 01:42 PM] 0x03#8822
it just isn't yet

[05-Oct-18 01:42 PM] 0x03#8822
and there have to be reasons why it isnt

[05-Oct-18 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
we get to DOGE as the highest marketcap contender for BTC replacement!

[05-Oct-18 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, I think XMR is at this moment, but only due to lack of rational CMC rankings

[05-Oct-18 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe PIRATE can be the next BTC!

[05-Oct-18 01:44 PM] 0x03#8822
aww the shibes ❤

[05-Oct-18 01:44 PM] 0x03#8822
enough reason for doge to be market cap king

[05-Oct-18 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD seems to complex to explain to people

I think pirate's appeal is in its simplicity

I see DigiByte as a "better Bitcoin"

[05-Oct-18 01:46 PM] house#8741
If you think you "get" kmd ... either I am a well functioning idiot or you are missing something

[05-Oct-18 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i guess most people just cant believe KMD can do all the things it already does`
Because that would involve doing research before investing finances and there seems to be unwritten laws against doing that

@house ask your questions then

well - this is something my grandmother said - it looks to good to be true

[05-Oct-18 01:47 PM] 0x03#8822
it being KMD

[05-Oct-18 01:47 PM] house#8741
This is my dilemma ... I do not know how to even formulate the correct questions as yet ... there are so many possibilities with komodo tech

[05-Oct-18 01:48 PM] 0x03#8822

[05-Oct-18 01:50 PM] 0x03#8822
it's the time to ask these questions 😉

[05-Oct-18 01:50 PM] house#8741
I know that 0x ... I am  careful and calculating ... I like my questions to have substance and a trail that I can build upon to reach a definitive portrait ... and I am lacking the boundaries of KMD's dimensions

[05-Oct-18 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
if Msols are steady and diff is reducing, that means lots of overall good luck?

[05-Oct-18 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I do not know how to even formulate the correct questions as yet ...`
My "best" method is just to blurt it out in the way you see it and talk it out and eventually (you may have to do like I've done before and draw pictures) a convo will lead to "that thing"

[05-Oct-18 01:51 PM] 0x03#8822
yea, discussion of your questions (should it ensue) will take you to higher levels

[05-Oct-18 01:52 PM] house#8741
not to worry ... I will have many stoopid questions coming in good time

[05-Oct-18 01:53 PM] house#8741
meanwhile ... I am learning bucketloads from just listening in

[05-Oct-18 01:54 PM] house#8741
M/sols and Diff are not married ?

[05-Oct-18 01:54 PM] house#8741
☝ stoopid question #1

[05-Oct-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
there are the actual Msols (unknowable precisely) and the implied Msols

[05-Oct-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the diff, which is adjusted constantly based on block finding times

[05-Oct-18 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
since diff adjusts based on the blocktimes, if there is a run of good luck, the diff goes up

[05-Oct-18 01:57 PM] house#8741
but by law of avg it will eventually balance out ?

[05-Oct-18 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[05-Oct-18 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
but there are these peaks and valleys in hashrate and diff, that are mostly in sync, but sometimes out of phase

[05-Oct-18 01:58 PM] house#8741
right ... so is like taking a snapshot with a low res camera (shutterspeed) ... like of a racehorse

[05-Oct-18 01:59 PM] house#8741
you will see a general area where the object is/was

[05-Oct-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
more like a feedback system

[05-Oct-18 01:59 PM] house#8741
prolly terrible analogy ... but I think I get what you mean

[05-Oct-18 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
where as things get out of balance, it is pushed/pulled in the opposite direction

[05-Oct-18 02:01 PM] house#8741
like rubberband

[05-Oct-18 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810

[05-Oct-18 02:01 PM] 0x03#8822
like your bathtub 'waving out' when you jump in it

[05-Oct-18 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
if you track the diff/Msols ratio it seems to range between 3:1 and 5:1, we are at about 5:1 now

[05-Oct-18 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
now sure what it means

[05-Oct-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
in last 100 blocks, diff is almost double as Msols is dropping

[05-Oct-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
might be the sign of the apocalypse

[05-Oct-18 02:02 PM] house#8741
good, yes 
haha ..

[05-Oct-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`might be the sign of the apocalypse`
It's a sign that PIRATE is a fail and you should sell your bags to me for a total of 777 KMD

[05-Oct-18 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe 777 BTC

Can't blame a poor man for trying

[05-Oct-18 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
but such a divergence between Msol and diff makes me wonder how the Msols are calculated

[05-Oct-18 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
could the Msol calc just to totally wrong?

[05-Oct-18 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
part of the disparity is likely to do with blocktimes, there were a few long blocks and a ton of rapid-fire blocks too

[05-Oct-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
diff seems more volatile than Msol

[05-Oct-18 02:07 PM] 0x03#8822
so much i can say, the pools just display numbers, they're not doing any calc

[05-Oct-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
I wonder if Msol is just a longer term MA

[05-Oct-18 02:07 PM] 0x03#8822
on the diff/msol

[05-Oct-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i know it comes from getmininginfo rpc call, so i should look at the code, but was lazy

[05-Oct-18 02:08 PM] 0x03#8822
how dare you :trollface:

[05-Oct-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
"\nReturns the estimated network solutions per second based on the last n blocks.\n"

[05-Oct-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
yes Msol is just average over last 120 blocks

[05-Oct-18 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
diff adjustments over 17 block window, so that is why diff is more volatile

[05-Oct-18 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
which means the diff will appear to lead the Msols

[05-Oct-18 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
like SMA 17 vs SMA.120

[05-Oct-18 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
but not exactly as diff has caps per adjustment and isnt a pure MA

[05-Oct-18 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
thanks! I never knew this until now

[05-Oct-18 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
even found an rpc called: getnetworksolps

[05-Oct-18 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
and you can pass in N to change the window you look at the "Msol"

[05-Oct-18 02:11 PM] 0x03#8822
getnetworksolps is an alias to getnetworkhashps?

[05-Oct-18 02:11 PM] 0x03#8822
kmd knows both

[05-Oct-18 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it returns just the Msols

[05-Oct-18 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they should always be the same (because ZEC didn't code the difference between hashes and sols that they put down in words)

[05-Oct-18 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by what they wrote, getnetworkhashps shouldn't even exist

[05-Oct-18 02:14 PM] 0x03#8822
noob question: sol stands for...solution?
