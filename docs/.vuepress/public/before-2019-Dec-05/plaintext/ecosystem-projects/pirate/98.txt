I guess it has been doing above 30 for a while...

I'll do a pull today and if it doesn't work, then I'll make a PR because I do have the bits all sorted for it (including cryptopia and tradesatoshi)

[01-Oct-18 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nah, that's too much like responsibility and shit 😛

[01-Oct-18 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
you dont want to be forced to accept pull requests with bugs?

[01-Oct-18 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
seems a brilliant way to sabotage projects

[01-Oct-18 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810

It's simple, you just sell your ethics to the highest bidder and make every statement about how noting can be any good if it didn't come from the team you're part of. 😉

basically gmax was too busy politicking to do anything but blind merges

[01-Oct-18 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
but really,  I think he assumed that nobody could be so idiotic as to remove the double spending check from the vin scanning

maybe brave, not idiotic :>

[01-Oct-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
there is only so much time in the day when you have to defend the technically indefensible all the time

[01-Oct-18 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
and it was from a long time contributor who is part of the "best programmers in the world" so there was no need to double check things

[01-Oct-18 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the reality is that even the best programmer in the world creates bugs, many of them

[01-Oct-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
hence the need for testing

[01-Oct-18 02:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The guy that once admitted that he never checks to see if code changes impact the GUI did a blind accept? Surely not!

[01-Oct-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
if this bug wasnt found by the BCH coder, but a miner, then they could have created thousands if not millions of bitcoins

[01-Oct-18 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah had a less ethical person figured it out, I think it would have ruined BTC

[01-Oct-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i wonder if LTC patched this yet

[01-Oct-18 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
if you had a 100,000 BTC utxo and used it as a vin, a 50 vin tx would have 5 million BTC. could fit a lot of those tx in a block

@webworker01 are you using `key.html` at all?

[01-Oct-18 04:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's a preference (and I'm not even sure if it can work with z, I haven't tried it)

[01-Oct-18 04:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I still use it out of habit, more than necessity; I started using it back with NOMP because of using 20 different coins

[01-Oct-18 04:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's essentially the same concept as "smart address" we use in bDEX

[01-Oct-18 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm thinking that if it can be done for z, it's going to need code added; afaik, it only has the code for keys for t addys

While the Linux CoC drama was unfolding, I went searching for alternative Linux-esque projects.

On another note, ever heard of TempleOS? 

Pretty fascinating. 

Schizophrenic genius created an entire operating system from nothing.

Some blokes added basic tcp to it recently, and you can load it up in a VM.
