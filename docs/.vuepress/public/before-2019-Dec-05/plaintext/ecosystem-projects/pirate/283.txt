Pirates usually do have tattooes so the pirate shop definitely needs them

[08-Nov-18 05:18 PM] PTYX#6840
@Flexatron if McAfee can do it, anyone can.

[08-Nov-18 05:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Which logo for a tattoo? Theres so many.

[08-Nov-18 05:24 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@FishyGuts  Is the P logo the new official logo?

[08-Nov-18 05:25 PM] Flexatron#8809
A fake tat or real? @PTYX

[08-Nov-18 05:35 PM] PTYX#6840
someone mentioned that the mcafee tat was possibly a fake. i dont know if it's true or not but what i'm saying is that if you create a good enough picture and put it in social media it doesnt really matter if it's a real tattoo or not.

[08-Nov-18 05:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I'm pretty sure it's not permanent tatoo - since yo ucn  have permanent and non-permanent one - why would you make permanent? he didn't say it's permenent at least so we can have some faith he is just a bit freaky :pirate:

[08-Nov-18 05:38 PM] Flexatron#8809
like the henna stuff

[08-Nov-18 05:38 PM] Flexatron#8809

John McAfee Gets Skycoin (SKY) Tattoo; Coin Price Immediately Jump...
The power of the celebrity endorsement was on full display Wednesday, when John McAfee’s new tattoo triggered a sudden change in the fortunes of one particular cryptocurrency. That coin was Skycoin (SKY), and when McAfee revealed the tattoo to his +800,000 twitter followers...

My only real question is: "If SA jails are better than US jails, if you have money, then why does he have so many shitty jail-house tats?"

[08-Nov-18 05:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
he looks like some dude from Mississippi that only had $50 on his books 😕

[08-Nov-18 05:56 PM] PTYX#6840
he was in belize. he'll probably say the ink is no good down there.

[08-Nov-18 05:56 PM] PTYX#6840
but the skycoin tat is made with super doge ink

[08-Nov-18 05:56 PM] PTYX#6840
it will never go away

[08-Nov-18 05:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
One thing I'm sure of: it's not the ink 😛

[08-Nov-18 05:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
(unless the ink was made from unburnt plastic, dog shit, and jet fuel)

I'm in no hurry to sell, especially at low exchange prices. If they dip even more, I'm happy to start trading the other direction.

Put up your sell wall, at your desired price... My buys keep getting filled at my set price each day. We have to have sellers so we buyers can be a buyin'.

I have a few coins up there, but there's a lot more resistance than support, so I'll let the dumpers take their fill for now.

we're inching awfully close back to 0.1

I agree with @KSanJuan . What could it hurt? Support is legion already, why not test resistances?

For those concerned about the McAfee tattoo and propose to send him $ARRR, I think there is a much better candidate, with a sound mind and a true pirate...Kim Dotcom.
