it will be a market capable of shielded transactions

[12-Nov-18 06:02 AM] rickiejohnson#0578
shielded

[12-Nov-18 06:04 AM] yorktronic#2703
cool, thanks for the info. I didn't know that was under development.

[12-Nov-18 06:28 AM] mrlynch#5735
@FishyGuts  what's up with the backup? Is sapling coming?

[12-Nov-18 06:32 AM] Lord Shaper Andy#5856
Is Agama the only wallet at the moment?

[12-Nov-18 06:33 AM] CiPhEr#2091
for gui wallet yes, you can also use cli wallet

[12-Nov-18 06:34 AM] Lord Shaper Andy#5856
Does anyone know how to encrypt/export wallet from Agama?

[12-Nov-18 06:34 AM] Lord Shaper Andy#5856
For pirate asset

[12-Nov-18 06:35 AM] CiPhEr#2091
since pirate requires full node to download and run (shielded transactions limitation currently) agama can't be encrypted

[12-Nov-18 06:35 AM] CiPhEr#2091
however for other coins that use lite mode on agama encryption of seed is possible

[12-Nov-18 06:36 AM] CiPhEr#2091
i would advise to run agama on a linux virtualbox if you are on windows & use veracrypt to encrypt wallet.dat file for more secure pirate storage

What do you mean backup @mrlynch - Did I say something?

@FishyGuts "You've backed up your wallets right?"

[12-Nov-18 06:51 AM] mrlynch#5735
Is something happening? Or was it just a friendly reminder? üò¨

Thanks polly

[12-Nov-18 07:09 AM] yorktronic#2703
@Lord Shaper Andy if you're doing a backup you can encrypt a USB stick and put the wallet.dat on there

[12-Nov-18 07:19 AM] yorktronic#2703
or do an encrypted container on an unencrypted USB stick

In late 2019 you will learn of the system I have been creating to track with evidentiary value all so~called privacy coins.

ZCash
Monero
Dash

100% traced, criminal case level evidence trails.

Have a nice life. It is too late to stop.

Enjoy exposure https://t.co/TsbhaRV...

@LocoMB He tracked three different privacy approaches?  So not only CoinMixing, but also RingCT and zkSNARKs at the same time?  But of course he needs another year to show it to everyone...



If he could track the coins, every government secret service like NSA would have paid him a fortune for it, but he just tweets.üòÑ
