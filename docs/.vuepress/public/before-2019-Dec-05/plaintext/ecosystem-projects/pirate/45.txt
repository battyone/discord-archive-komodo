Some people may be thinking a cartoonish/cute pirate type logo. I wonder how many people agree. Should the logo be more menacing to strike fear in the heart of those that should be plundered? lolz...stay true to the hitory of piracy?

[26-Sep-18 02:47 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
I would be very curious to hear whatever ideas people are thinking. If you have ideas, mention it! If you can illustrate, throw up ideas to get the brainstorms going!!

So it looks like there was a difference between red and black flags, red flags (from some sources) indicate "No quarter given"

What are some really stealthy animals? - Quora
The owl is known as the king of stealth - and for good reason. The gorgeously fluffy feathers are ‚Äòdamping‚Äô - they absorb and diffuse sound so effectively that it makes owls very nearly silent, not just when gliding but even when flapping. In fact...

[26-Sep-18 03:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```Ninja mouse is a remarkable animal. His light absorbing coat works like a cloak of invisibility, and his whiskers are reputed to be so sensitive that they can detect an owl blink from 50ft away.

But if you visit the Natural History museum in London and ask to see a specimen you‚Äôll be met with blank stares - their collection houses 80 million specimens, and the collection has been digitised so you can search it‚Ä¶ but you won‚Äôt find a ninja mouse.

Owls have never caught one. So perhaps it‚Äôs not surprising that humans haven‚Äôt either.

In fact, some question whether ninja mouse even exists, given no one has ever seen or heard one.

Now that‚Äôs stealthy.```

To set the image of PIRATE so that professionals can expect to use it, I think it should have a neutral marketing material
from logo to presentation of it's marketing material
In case of PIRATE the marketing now becomes the most important aspect in my opinion
To NOT be treated it like a joke.

So half the coins out there are working hard to be professional and to be accepted by "professionals" . I wonder if this is the best approach. Look how  much adoption DOGE has. Now, I am not suggesting pirate be anything like DOGE,...but my opinion is that if you do what yo ubelive in and enjoy, the adoption will come later. I am also thinking PIRATE will NEVER be accepted by the professionals. It should appeal to those that will actually use it. Ideally a community that enjoys using it rather than professionals that feel it is acceptable....just my 2 cents...well, my two ARRs

[26-Sep-18 03:55 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Regarding marketing :  common sense thing would be to target pirate themed things.  Pirate Bay, Sealand, Pirate Parties, maybe even as far as anachronistic groups.

[26-Sep-18 04:27 AM] Don King#8901
IMO best logo is just the word 'PIRATE' on its own , style to taste, then it can be as professional as any other crypto for those who want/need,  but maintains the 'Arrr' for those who like the vibe of the name. Less is more with logos when the name is cool, and PIRATE is a great name. Personally, the skull and cross bones stuff isn't needed in the logo, add it everywhere else though.
