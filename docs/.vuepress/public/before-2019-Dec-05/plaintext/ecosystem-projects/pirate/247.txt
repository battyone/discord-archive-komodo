I know 😂

[31-Oct-18 05:54 PM] Flexatron#8809
Haha

[31-Oct-18 05:55 PM] Flexatron#8809
Sounded like an achievement

[31-Oct-18 05:55 PM] Flexatron#8809
Congratz with the arr

[31-Oct-18 05:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
The order completed with about +10 delta though so i'm happy. Got more than i paid for

[31-Oct-18 05:56 PM] Flexatron#8809
Nice, never looked at that at the end

[31-Oct-18 05:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
Think i'm gonna get more asics though. It's just that they're all sold out. I can only find 2 z9 minis on ebay

[31-Oct-18 05:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
Do use nh regulalrly?

[31-Oct-18 05:56 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Yeah @mrlynch Its ok now but i get trapped

[31-Oct-18 05:57 PM] TheGemologist#6023
increased price so much to hurry for hash

[31-Oct-18 05:57 PM] TheGemologist#6023
than it went back down

[31-Oct-18 05:57 PM] TheGemologist#6023
and im trapped payibg more

[31-Oct-18 05:57 PM] TheGemologist#6023
lol

[31-Oct-18 05:57 PM] mrlynch#5735
It's a bit of a pain for me as i'm out of btc, got it locked in trading and it kinda pains me buying more from coinbase and co ;))

[31-Oct-18 05:57 PM] mrlynch#5735
Keep lowering every 600 sec

[31-Oct-18 05:58 PM] Flexatron#8809
New order, you get part of the fees back In believe

[31-Oct-18 05:58 PM] mrlynch#5735
I aimed for lower to mid range of the order book and it went just fine. Got a few emails saying that order is low but i can live with 15-20 khs for a few minutes

[31-Oct-18 05:59 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Other question that may sound dumb.. If i set a higher limit, than my BTC will be spent faster because more hash is being used and i will spend less time on the pool, so will i receive less reward ? Is it better to keep a lower limit of hash and stay longer on the pool or this doesnt matter?

[31-Oct-18 06:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
If you're mining on piratepool you get the shares so it doesn't really matter, however a good strategy is to have high hash power when difficulty is low as you'll get more rewards

[31-Oct-18 06:02 PM] mrlynch#5735
Basically you need to monitor the network difficulty and when it's low you increase the limit on nh, not the bid. When diff goes up you lower the limit back to 0.1

[31-Oct-18 06:02 PM] mrlynch#5735
That way you make most of your btc on nh

[31-Oct-18 06:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
Or you can be a lazy git like me, set it low and let her rip 😂

[31-Oct-18 06:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you increase hash, then you get higher rewards for a shorter amount of time
generally speaking it all balances out the same

[31-Oct-18 06:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can go overboard and spend a ton and get less, but that's at the 70% of the network range

[31-Oct-18 06:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
This talk has made me thirsy for moar hash power

[31-Oct-18 06:06 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Hmm, all ok!

[31-Oct-18 06:06 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Is there any problem adding more than 1 order to the same worker ?

[31-Oct-18 06:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nope, it may look ugly on the chart at the pool sometimes if you do, but it all works the same

[31-Oct-18 06:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 which nh miners are best for piratepool.io? Us or eu? I think the pool is US. Does it matter? Eu prices are a bit lower

[31-Oct-18 06:22 PM] TheGemologist#6023
My worker stats at piratepool are saying " Paid: 89.59563954 " but nothing showed up on wallet..

Is sapling a mining word ? @Flexatron

[31-Oct-18 06:23 PM] Flexatron#8809
its the succesor to sprout

[31-Oct-18 06:23 PM] LocoMB#8593
needs croutons

[31-Oct-18 06:24 PM] TheGemologist#6023
I cant understand lol language barrier

[31-Oct-18 06:24 PM] Flexatron#8809
the way your machine calculates the zk-snark proof

[31-Oct-18 06:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
😂

[31-Oct-18 06:24 PM] Flexatron#8809
sprout is inefficient, sapling is very efficient

[31-Oct-18 06:25 PM] TheGemologist#6023
@webworker01 Yeah, i can understand this way

[31-Oct-18 06:25 PM] mrlynch#5735
Give it a few minutes

[31-Oct-18 06:25 PM] LocoMB#8593
sprouts are very healthy as salad topping- saplings ruin your digestion

[31-Oct-18 06:25 PM] Flexatron#8809
getting hungry as well

[31-Oct-18 06:25 PM] LocoMB#8593
too much fibre (a.k.a. 'wood' 🎄 )

[31-Oct-18 06:25 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Im feeling very happy with my first mined coins, lol

[31-Oct-18 06:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@mrlynch I go with price (imo, pings matter more for miners than renters)

[31-Oct-18 06:26 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
Cryptobridge should list Pirate

[31-Oct-18 06:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
Thanks  @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[31-Oct-18 06:27 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
They were the first to list Ravencoin... and I’m pretty sure they did not have to pay.

[31-Oct-18 06:40 PM] wookie#7663
@ghost.in.the.dao ARRR cannot work on a DEX.

[31-Oct-18 06:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[31-Oct-18 06:43 PM] LocoMB#8593
a semi-DEX would be a batch CC that splices through a number of small TXs so that the counterparty risk is limited for the person doing the first batch

[31-Oct-18 06:44 PM] LocoMB#8593
hopefully they put s.t. like this into Tortuga

[31-Oct-18 06:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
once upon a time someone said `A DEX cannot work` and __at that time__ they were correct

[31-Oct-18 06:44 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Is it a true assumption? :

If a network has 100MSol hashrate and POOL has 50MSol average block time is 1 min, so probably it will find a block every 2 min as it carries half of network hash?

[31-Oct-18 06:45 PM] LocoMB#8593
ah - if that turned out to be an urban legend that would be cool!

[31-Oct-18 06:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`on average` being the key phrase that people tend to forget, ignore, and/or overlook

[31-Oct-18 07:11 PM] Flexatron#8809
halloweendip on hashrate today? :trollface:

[31-Oct-18 08:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
+20.4% delta on NH. Nice

[31-Oct-18 08:47 PM] Flexatron#8809
Free arrrrr

[31-Oct-18 08:48 PM] Flexatron#8809
Then you can sell then to me @0.08 KMD:trollface:

[31-Oct-18 08:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
Hehe. Not selling anything yet

[31-Oct-18 08:52 PM] mrlynch#5735

miners on my pool (that is the arrr.pool-mining.xyz), who is experiencing connection issues? i *may be* a victim of very bad peering which may be enough to render my pool into an annoyance for some. this seems to be the case for (some) US and australia users.

[31-Oct-18 10:11 PM] mrlynch#5735
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 "I tend to complain when those that should know better don't"

I take it you work in IT (some form of devops agile scrum - other hype words thrown in by managers) and have to deal with idiots every day 😡

[31-Oct-18 10:13 PM] 0x03#8822
it's probably the right time now (or as good as any other time) to remind everybody that checking RTTs and a traceroute to your pool of choice, and especially comparing them against the other options is a very good idea

[31-Oct-18 10:21 PM] yorktronic#2703
I had a connection issue last night briefly

removing 1 more than your actual ISP gateway should do the trick
