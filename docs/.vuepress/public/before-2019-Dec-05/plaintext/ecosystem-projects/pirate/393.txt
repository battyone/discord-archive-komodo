[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> So pretty much what I'm saying is, do you want to get in on a money making machine ?

[13-Nov-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Then make it a website :)

[13-Nov-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> No hardware required

[13-Nov-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> If it's video blackjack: Why not hook it up to something that's already developed (like KMDICE)

[13-Nov-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Well either way, still need to build the blockchain blackjack

[13-Nov-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Application

[13-Nov-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `do you want to get in on a money making machine ?`
unless you're offering me a ground-floor invite to manufacturing and selling these devices with you and others, the above conversation is exactly not that

[13-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> I am open to the discussion

[13-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> But I am starting school here shorty just got here

[13-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> because, as a player, it's a loss; because, the house has the advantage in every electronic bj game

[13-Nov-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> I can draw up some blueprints when I get some extra tine, and then throw the prototypes into 3dsmax

[13-Nov-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Everyone knows that genie, yet they still go to Vegas in droves of millions every year and play digital blackjack

[13-Nov-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> what kind of moron goes to a physical casino and plays electronic cards?

[13-Nov-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> They play digital craps and digital roulette too

[13-Nov-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> I've been to vegas over 30 times

[13-Nov-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> And every time, there is always someone playing digital

[13-Nov-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> All day

[13-Nov-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> that just about almost makes me weep

[13-Nov-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> I used to live in Tunica and the only people I saw play electronic were waiting on an open table

[13-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Yeah, I've got a problem with profiting on people with addiction issues. so I'll go do something else now.

[13-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Sooo? Why feel bad for someone who most certainly knows they are throwing their money away, like my old sales director used to say "dont spend their money for them, let them decide how they will spend it"

[13-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> If they make that choice, to buy a 20,000 timeshare, or spend 100 on blackjack. Or buy a 50,000 truck, that's how they want to spend it

[13-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `Why feel bad for someone who most certainly knows they are throwing their money away`
but....
`do you want to get in on a money making machine ?`
negates that

[13-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> you can't have it both ways

[13-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> I can get rich and eat steak and lobster instead of top ramen, and I will sleep like a baby with zero guilt conscious

[13-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> But it's not a scam, people know the house always wins

[13-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Casinos take your money

[13-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> The lucky few walk away wealthy

[13-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Think about that

[13-Nov-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Like i said, not re inventing the wheel, just taking an age old idea, and modernizing it

[13-Nov-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `Think about that`
I did
you offered the concept of me playing your casino and tried to tell me it was "money making" for me üòï

[13-Nov-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> All casinos are money making

[13-Nov-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> The lucky few walk away winners, but most certainly the odds are always on favor of the house

[13-Nov-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> But in the aspect of black Jack, it is a skill based game

[13-Nov-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `All casinos are money making`
no shit, that's why I keep saying that I'd be an idiot to spend money on building a device that does nothing but let me be a player in your casino

[13-Nov-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Yeah, it's so much a 'skill game'that people that found a way to beat the house are banned.

[13-Nov-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> More so with poker, that is skill based, but the house takes a cut, they never loose on poker

[13-Nov-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> it's a 'skill game', but unly the unskilled are allowed to play

[13-Nov-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

[13-Nov-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Hey man I didnt invent vegas

[13-Nov-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> I have a 480 acre ranch that say's there **is** skill involved in winning at poker consistently....

[13-Nov-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> @ùôäùôûùô£ùô†

[13-Nov-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> (damn, I just got pinged in KMD... brb)

[13-Nov-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> I have a millennium falcon, wanna play pazzac?

[13-Nov-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> I also have lost 3 houses, almost as proof that when you play like a moron, you lose

[13-Nov-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Get some pazaak cards

[13-Nov-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> sry for the double ping, I forgot (sad since I just said something about it a few mins ago)

[13-Nov-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> I don't deny that skills are involved and generally the most skillfull wins, but I'm merely pointing out that the house has ways to make sure the odds stay in their favor. Which is understandable, because they would go bankrupt.

[13-Nov-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Alright yall I gotta get to class, but i think pazaak might be cooler then blackjack

[13-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> But that's for me a reason to not gamble in commercial establishments of any kind.

[13-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> I'm not advocating stealing from people just saying, run a business

[13-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Business is business

[13-Nov-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `but I'm merely pointing out that the house has ways to make sure the odds stay in their favor`
yes, in all other games, the house has no less than a 4% advantage against the "average" person and 0 games where "non-cheaters" have any advantage points

[13-Nov-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `I'm not advocating stealing from people just saying, run a business`
I seem to have read this whole conversation wrong, I thought you were trying to sell us on the idea of these devices with us being players

[13-Nov-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> as a sole proprietor, I can think of 30 projects I'd rather do

[13-Nov-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> fwiw: if you ever doubt that slot-machines are "rigged", look into the Vegas laws that deal with payouts and do an actual run of random numbers, you'll see that the outcomes *have to be manipulated* as mandated by law

[13-Nov-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> it's also the reason you can "win" a 10 cent outcome on a $1 bet

[13-Nov-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> you lost 90 cents, but it legally counts as a "win"

[13-Nov-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> _has spent waaaaaay too much time in casinos ü§£_

[13-Nov-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> If I put money in a machine: it's a pinball machine. Guaranteed fun and I'm sure that my money is gone when I'm done!

[13-Nov-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> craps and poker are my vices

[13-Nov-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> I'm boring... played poker in highschool, but got moral issues with taking money from other people. (Yes, I cheated, no they still don't know how)

[13-Nov-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> much to my parent's chagrin, I have 0 moral issues with playing tournament poker üòõ

[dscrd-prt] <BooYaCa$harrr> It's cool, I'm not a dev, just trying to understand how it would work from a USB

[13-Nov-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @BooYaCa$harrr basically, plug in the USB, turn on your pc, and it boots into the pirate os

[13-Nov-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BooYaCa$harrr> Would I have to install applications each time I use it? For example, if I want to boot up other wallets, can I save these to the same USB for easy access?

[13-Nov-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> It should all be saved on the drive already

[13-Nov-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> All that data is automatically saved on the usb afaik

[13-Nov-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LooTz> nothing to install all packages are stripped down to minimally everything needed to run a wallet. then you can shut it down and boot into your normal OS

[13-Nov-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> I‚Äôm having pretty good success with my Snapcraft stuff, that may be another interesting way to run pirate OS: boot a USB with Kali then install a Snap. Although I still@like the idea of a live usb that can keep changes so it has your privkey

[13-Nov-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> @LooTz actually even for your live OS, if you put the wallet in a snap it should be more able to deal with different hardware configurations. Although you might already be thinking of putting the wallet in a docker container for the same reason
