99.9999999999% of my hash has been rented

[21-Oct-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
depending on your time horizon, buying at big premium to mining cost will still work out

[21-Oct-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
so it would seem that mining at a premium cost would also work out

[21-Oct-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you need to buy hash and sell the same day, then yes, you can calculate an instantaneous breakeven point with assuming nicehash price is stable

[21-Oct-18 01:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
renting for profit requires picking and choosing your "battles" with price, size, and current block diff

[21-Oct-18 02:00 PM] Llama#1330
I’ll send u a screenshot when I’m on my computer

[21-Oct-18 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You can send all the screenshots you like, I prefer real-world data and math

[21-Oct-18 02:01 PM] Llama#1330
Lol

[21-Oct-18 02:01 PM] Llama#1330
You are such a condescending person

[21-Oct-18 02:01 PM] kaks#6612
i rented in nicehash with ETH 2 months ago

[21-Oct-18 02:01 PM] Llama#1330
The spreadsheet is like 90% math and 10% visual

[21-Oct-18 02:01 PM] kaks#6612
now iam studying on EQUIHASH

[21-Oct-18 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`You are such a condescending person`
Only to people that are completely factually wrong

[21-Oct-18 02:02 PM] Llama#1330
What did I say that is “completely factually wrong?”

[21-Oct-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
everything from [renting 30M sols is unprofitable] onwards

[21-Oct-18 02:05 PM] Llama#1330
So in conclusion: 
 - I don’t actually have a chart
 - that chart that I [don’t] have doesn’t actually show the point of diminishing return.
- you aren’t renting your hashpower
- I won’t send you a screenshot when I’m on my computer.
- im not laughing out loud (probably right)
- you aren’t condescending (you later agreed on this that you ARE condescending)

[21-Oct-18 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you aren’t renting your hashpower`
You're right, I have 50Msols tucked away in my back pocket 🙄

[21-Oct-18 02:07 PM] Llama#1330
You are so stupid lol

[21-Oct-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
plz, let us try to be civil

[21-Oct-18 02:07 PM] Llama#1330
“99.99999999999% of my hash power has been rented” - you

[21-Oct-18 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how do you see me say I rented and get I didn't rent out of that?

[21-Oct-18 02:08 PM] BlockTech#6895
Please, when discussion "personal talk a little unpleasant got more than 3-4 exchanges, is it possible to talk in private ?" Not to give new comers a bad perspective of the community.

The jello pool is over there

[21-Oct-18 02:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That’s where this should be taken 😃

[21-Oct-18 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
P.S. - "the point of diminishing return" is a notion that you're arbitrarily deciding based on (at best) faulty information

[21-Oct-18 02:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
At least let us get a camera on it.

[21-Oct-18 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you're picking some random number out of the air and calling that "return"

[21-Oct-18 02:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085

If you guys have a spreadsheet or chart send it over.

I think the community would appreciate number instead of arguments. 🐙

You’re Both good for the community in different ways and we appreciate it.

[21-Oct-18 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Personally, I hope he convinces everyone to not rent; it'll cost me less and increase my profits 😛

[21-Oct-18 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Still doesn't change factual inaccuracy, though

[21-Oct-18 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
but there is a point of diminishing returns

[21-Oct-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
due to the rented hash not included in the mining calculator

[21-Oct-18 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
clearly 400Msols vs 1000 msols, is not much difference in blocks found

[21-Oct-18 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
diminishing returns based on what time-frame and price (both are just an arbitrary number)

[21-Oct-18 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
let us just count PIRATE mined and assume 1 PIRATE equals 1 PIRATE

[21-Oct-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
probably if you are mining much more than 10% of hashrate, it starts increasing the cost per PIRATE

[21-Oct-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
at 100% of hashrate,  the cost only goes up, but same amount of PIRATE

[21-Oct-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
-> point of diminishing returns

[21-Oct-18 02:15 PM] Llama#1330
Jl I’ll send you the spreadsheet if you want it.

[21-Oct-18 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I will agree that there are self-diminishing returns of adding x over y against yourself, but adding x or y to the network is a different set of numbers

[21-Oct-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
no, its ok, I understand the math intuitively

[21-Oct-18 02:16 PM] penguin#0544
@Llama im keen to see

[21-Oct-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i think there is just a bit of definition issues, and with nicehash rates and hashrate not consistent, along with overall hashrate, price of KMD/BTC , etc. any such magic number will be fuzzy and not 100% precise

[21-Oct-18 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`at 100% of hashrate, the cost only goes up, but same amount of PIRATE`
right, and if that's the point he's talking about than I fully agree (and have said 100 times throughout the boards)
but to say that x is unprofitable, as a blanket statement, is 98+% false

[21-Oct-18 02:20 PM] penguin#0544
he didn't make a definite claim

[21-Oct-18 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
a stopped clock is right at least twice a day, so saying it is "wholly false" is false

[21-Oct-18 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
depending on the level of precision that is required, almost all natural language statements are false

[21-Oct-18 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
there can be some +/- range of Msols at any given point in time that is close to the diminishing returns

[21-Oct-18 02:21 PM] penguin#0544
context is everything

[21-Oct-18 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
likely would need to be +/- 50%, which is not very precise, but I blame nicehash variability for that

[21-Oct-18 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the other thing to consider when adding is who you're subtracting from (being at the top of the list has a different net impact than the min cost)

[21-Oct-18 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's a ton to consider when determining outcome (including more game theory than I am versed in or can be put on a spreadsheet)

[21-Oct-18 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is all very complex and changing in realtime, like BTCUSD price, just a lot more variable

[21-Oct-18 03:01 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
Is dexstats out of ARRR? 😃

[21-Oct-18 03:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
SO no statement is really ever likely to be 100% true depending on perspective at the very least.

[21-Oct-18 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
math can be true or wrong

[21-Oct-18 03:04 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360

is there a problem with payouts on piratepool.io

[21-Oct-18 03:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
No

[21-Oct-18 03:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
They are just batched and slow because of z tx processing requirements.  Check the payout minimum and make sure that isn't the issue either 😃

[21-Oct-18 03:16 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
payout minimum is 25

[21-Oct-18 03:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
