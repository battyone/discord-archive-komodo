It's for Binance

[26-Oct-18 07:29 AM] Bikob2#4549
Guys, maybe you experienced that? Why my Z9 - Miner Status is Dead. All settings is fine - URL stratum+tcp://stratum.piratepool.io:2097

[26-Oct-18 07:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
What‚Äôs the first part of your payout address?

[26-Oct-18 07:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Do you have it all in there?

[26-Oct-18 07:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Is it R? Or zc?

[26-Oct-18 07:31 AM] Bikob2#4549
zcCE7

[26-Oct-18 07:31 AM] Bikob2#4549
z - wallet

[26-Oct-18 07:34 AM] Oszy#5734
Was it ok before of it's the first time you trying to connect?

[26-Oct-18 07:35 AM] Bikob2#4549
yes, first time for this pool.  with this one was all fine https://arrr.pool-mining.xyz/

[26-Oct-18 07:36 AM] Bikob2#4549
but I want to switch to https://piratepool.io/

[26-Oct-18 07:36 AM] Oszy#5734
Try the URL without stratum+tcp so just "stratum.piratepool.io:2097"

[26-Oct-18 07:44 AM] Bikob2#4549
no, didn't work..

[26-Oct-18 07:46 AM] Oszy#5734
Okay. What miner are you using and what is the error message you get?

[26-Oct-18 07:48 AM] penguin#0544
double check both url and that z-address wasn't edited by mistake - piratepool going fine here

[26-Oct-18 07:48 AM] Bikob2#4549
checking logs errors

[26-Oct-18 07:49 AM] Bikob2#4549
I run Z9 (42K/S)

[26-Oct-18 07:58 AM] Bikob2#4549

[26-Oct-18 08:00 AM] Oszy#5734
ummmm

[26-Oct-18 08:00 AM] Oszy#5734
you might have dns problem?

[26-Oct-18 08:01 AM] Oszy#5734
try 178.63.77.56 instead of the URL?

[26-Oct-18 08:01 AM] Bikob2#4549
stratum+tcp://178.63.77.56:2097

[26-Oct-18 08:01 AM] Bikob2#4549
this one?

[26-Oct-18 08:02 AM] Oszy#5734
ye

[26-Oct-18 08:04 AM] Bikob2#4549
still dead. may be farewall blocking my ip or something?

[26-Oct-18 08:05 AM] Bikob2#4549
I'm from Russia

[26-Oct-18 08:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[26-Oct-18 08:44 AM] bishop#9773
@cryptographic Yes as it limits to z-tx transfers only

whats the best mining program for 1080 ti, claymore?

[26-Oct-18 09:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I use EWBF's, but some use dtsm

[26-Oct-18 09:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
you can use claymore as well, not sure of the performance though

[26-Oct-18 09:20 AM] cryptographic#0598
cool. running 1080's?

[26-Oct-18 09:20 AM] kaks#6612
for nvidia GPU use EWBF

[26-Oct-18 09:21 AM] cryptographic#0598
not claymore?

[26-Oct-18 09:23 AM] cryptographic#0598

i mean the hashrate goes to low

[26-Oct-18 10:14 AM] Oszy#5734
in the stats or in your miner?
