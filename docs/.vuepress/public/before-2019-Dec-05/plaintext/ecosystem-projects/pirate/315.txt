[15-Nov-18 10:59 AM] Crypto Rich#6241
@CryptoNinjaa I saw that.  LOL  I hold a fair amount of TPAY. Sold all my XVG last week, and now going to sell my XMR to get some KMD for ARRR!!!

[15-Nov-18 11:00 AM] Oszy#5734
prices are now good to buy moarrr

[15-Nov-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810

Cyrpto rich is an ARRR Maxamilist now lol.

[15-Nov-18 12:27 PM] Flexatron#8809
Signed up for crex in advance as well

[15-Nov-18 12:28 PM] BlockTech#6895
Me to, now i'm just wondering if the first moove after listing will be up, or down ^^.

[15-Nov-18 12:36 PM] Flexatron#8809
CMC listing will probs get some more buyers in

[15-Nov-18 12:36 PM] Flexatron#8809
So up and down I think

[15-Nov-18 01:02 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if not BTC crash Arrr could 4x in price, now we can expect rather 2x maybe

[15-Nov-18 01:03 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
reason - last few days DP traded daily mining, which means increasing buy orders  slightly (new exchange, new buyers) would make the price much up

[15-Nov-18 01:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
I believe crex is still testing. Don't deposit ARRR yet. I've sent 30 ARRR as a test and it hasn't credited yet. Been a few hours now

[dscrd-cz] <Paul> Hey  I bought a gamer PC, do you know how to mine ARRR?  Or is there a video from A - Z on how to set it up?

[dscrd-cz] <BlockTech> @Paul You can find some info on : https://piratepool.io/getting_started . 
But in case you don't know, $ARRR is no more worth it to mine with a GPU/CPU.

[15-Nov-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <BlockTech> Only ASIC is worth mining ARRR since it reached 20Msol/s. (Actually around 120Msol/s now)

[15-Nov-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Paul> Thank you

[15-Nov-18 03:22 PM] Flexatron#8809
Someone bought some. Kmd

[15-Nov-18 03:33 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Crex says they have not received any of my deposits and then asked "If we can't look it up on the explorer, how do we know you're sending funds?  

:trollface:

[15-Nov-18 03:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So Im not sure what's up there but I will advise as they continue to email.  

I wish they would get in discord here to solve it 😛

[15-Nov-18 03:34 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
cant see how it cannot turn up tbh if they have given you the correct address.

[15-Nov-18 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810

[15-Nov-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to send them zcash payments API docs

[15-Nov-18 03:38 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
send them the tx id for lols

[15-Nov-18 03:50 PM] Flexatron#8809
Oh lord.

[15-Nov-18 03:51 PM] Flexatron#8809
"sure we'll add your anon coin, no prob"

[15-Nov-18 04:01 PM] scubapanda#2485
How did they create the receiving address?

[15-Nov-18 04:09 PM] Flexatron#8809
I gave it to them :trollface:

I’m not at my desk.   Does anyone have the zcash docs for me to send them?

food for thought:
```$ ./CostToMine.sh
Calculating with rental hash of 1 Million sol/s at 0.046 BTC or 269.71562591 KMD per day
Mining an average of 2669.17478400 coins per day

Your cost per coin is .00001723 BTC or .10104831 KMD
You want to sell at .00001895 BTC or .11115314 KMD for a 10% markup

At that price, you will earn ~ .05058086 BTC or 296.68715845 KMD
That's a total daily profit of ~ .00458086 BTC or 26.97153254 KMD```

[15-Nov-18 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Because, math

[15-Nov-18 04:39 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Crex24: @jl777c  need to fix Pirates, they are clearly broken - no amounts or addresses on explorer!!!

[15-Nov-18 04:39 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
the most broken chain @FishyGuts

[15-Nov-18 04:40 PM] PTYX#6840
🤔

[15-Nov-18 04:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 that's at a price of 0.046/1msol which is highly unlikely. I didn't get any hash power for hours at that price. Safest bid was around 0.051 to have constant hash

[15-Nov-18 04:40 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
One question i get alot with full anon coins like pirate and xmr is how do you know the supply has not been inflated somehow? or do we just trust the algo ?

[15-Nov-18 04:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
But yeah. I get your point

[15-Nov-18 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@mrlynch that was a viable price 20 mins ago: more cost = less profit

[15-Nov-18 04:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
Nice script though :D

[15-Nov-18 04:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
That is true. My argument is that dumpers should have access to that script and stop selling for 0.000015

[15-Nov-18 04:42 PM] PTYX#6840
@CryptoNinjaa there is no way of knowing unless someone does some deep analysis and detects some spooky action at a distance

[15-Nov-18 04:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
As they are clearly at a loss

[15-Nov-18 04:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
Might be better off just buying the coins

[15-Nov-18 04:42 PM] PTYX#6840
i could be wrong

[15-Nov-18 04:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
Less hassle

[15-Nov-18 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`My argument is that dumpers should have access to that script and stop selling for 0.000015`
That's been my point since day 4 of being on dp 🙄

[15-Nov-18 04:43 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ok ptyx thank you - i trust the setup lol

[15-Nov-18 04:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
Well, it's their cash that's being lost. I keep buying alongside mining 😁
