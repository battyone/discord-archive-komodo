[19-Nov-18 01:10 PM] Flexatron#8809
I usually pick a bit higher NH price so I stay affloat when the hash dips

[19-Nov-18 01:10 PM] Flexatron#8809
so figured 0.078 was a good price

[19-Nov-18 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's the cost of fixed order

my calc includes or excludes if hash is running

[19-Nov-18 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```if ( $hashing === 'true' ) {
    $blocksPerDay = (24 * (1 / ( (60 / ( ( $renting * pow(10,6) ) / ( $nh * pow(10,6) ) ) ) / 3600 ) ));
} else {    $blocksPerDay = (24 * (1 / ( (60 / ( ( $renting * pow(10,6) ) / ( ($nh + $renting) * pow(10,6) ) ) ) / 3600 ) )); }```

I realize this is pirate chat, but just asking, anyone have a good idea why btc is dropping so much?

[19-Nov-18 01:49 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
it's very negative impact on the whole cryptospace.

[19-Nov-18 01:55 PM] Flexatron#8809
upcoming ETF's and BAKKT need a good buy in price :trollface:

We are in the capitulation phase i think ^^.

[19-Nov-18 01:57 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Conspiracy time - Craig wrong said there will be no btc end of 2019. What if he sells off all he can loads up de fud like he is now and btc gets to that magic $1000 and then buys them all........

[19-Nov-18 01:59 PM] blubbi#0643
last time btc was at 5.500$ it took 33 days to reach 19.000$ 😛

[19-Nov-18 02:00 PM] FrancoMontana#1536
@CryptoNinjaa what if he sells off btc and it capitulate, wait bitmain sells bch sv and then hr buys tons of bchsv for pennies and pump again the price

[19-Nov-18 02:00 PM] FrancoMontana#1536
result: btc died and bch sv rising from the ashes

[19-Nov-18 02:01 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Hmm i dont think you could come back from that though. No coiners already think crypto is a joke. Craig kills summat big like btc and offers bchsv sounds even more like a joke . But who knows eh

[19-Nov-18 02:02 PM] FrancoMontana#1536
I hope this won't happen, but i had this nightmare

[19-Nov-18 02:03 PM] PTYX#6840
Was Craig in the nightmare?

[19-Nov-18 02:03 PM] FrancoMontana#1536
He was the main character 😄

[19-Nov-18 02:27 PM] wookie#7663
@plazma you mean native on agama?

[19-Nov-18 02:27 PM] plazma#1625
Yep

[19-Nov-18 02:28 PM] wookie#7663
there is actually an older version of agama that has verus on native. I believe it's agama version .40f, I'm using it on a separate computer from the latest agama with everything else

[19-Nov-18 02:28 PM] plazma#1625
Yep me tooo

[19-Nov-18 02:28 PM] wookie#7663
what I don't understand is why that version with native verus didn't get carried forward

[19-Nov-18 02:29 PM] plazma#1625
I wana some verus in sapling wayayayaya😭

[19-Nov-18 02:41 PM] wookie#7663
so with different komodods, does that mean that going forward, there will/can not be one agama that has both native verus and native kmd?

[19-Nov-18 02:41 PM] Flexatron#8809
15K sat support at KMD

@Flexatron a truckful of usd fiat? or of bolivar fiat??🤣  jk jk

[19-Nov-18 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not 100% sure but there is a current PR with verus stuff being merged to KMD .. its a really huge undertaking though and wont be complete any time soon. That should enable sapling for us though from what I looked at it.

[19-Nov-18 02:47 PM] plazma#1625
Yay

[19-Nov-18 02:47 PM] plazma#1625
Me happy😍

[19-Nov-18 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
rushing that PR would be suicide though
