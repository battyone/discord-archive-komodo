Well your getting half the blocks so it can't all be that bad

[27-Sep-18 04:30 PM] Flexatron#8809
That's 0.1 btc a day or na

[27-Sep-18 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a 4x increase in hash yields a near 5x increase in diff

[27-Sep-18 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, ya, it is "that bad"

[27-Sep-18 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Flexatron the whole order was a tad over 0.33 BTC

[27-Sep-18 04:32 PM] Lennart#9331
someone has some more pirate to offer?

[27-Sep-18 04:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[27-Sep-18 04:38 PM] And1_89#6578
i will buy  with btc

[27-Sep-18 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@And1_89 Due to fees, waiting, and BTC being BTC, the upchage for BTC would be 0.392175 BTC for 25k PIRATE

[27-Sep-18 04:43 PM] Flexatron#8809
Lol

[27-Sep-18 04:44 PM] And1_89#6578
i have 0,1 btc

[27-Sep-18 04:44 PM] And1_89#6578

[27-Sep-18 04:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

New speed limits will solve this issue. For now, you can try to set a lower speed limit for example 2 MH/s.

Thank you for understanding.`
🤦

[27-Sep-18 04:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`MH/s` ugh

[27-Sep-18 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
All I know is that I'm getting screwed and they aren't using any lube 😭

[27-Sep-18 04:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It wouldn't be "so bad" if I were mining ZEC or *just* PIRATE, but for what I do this is killing my ROI

[27-Sep-18 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Speed at pool     14.8561 MSol /s 
Speed paying     15.3534 MSol /s`
on a 5.4 cap 😭

[27-Sep-18 04:58 PM] 0x03#8822
i'm unsure yet if it's maybe just random, but since i switched to a fixed order, all the peaks are gone

[27-Sep-18 04:58 PM] 0x03#8822
(and the skies are grey)

[27-Sep-18 04:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mine is a fixed order

[27-Sep-18 04:58 PM] 0x03#8822
hm

[27-Sep-18 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I went with fixed because the idjits doing standard orders bid it up higher than fixed was

[27-Sep-18 04:59 PM] 0x03#8822
same 😄

that's 5 hrs and the `- - - - - ` line is the 5.4 "limit"

[27-Sep-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
will they refund you the overage?

[27-Sep-18 05:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
never

[27-Sep-18 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
then it is a simple answer

[27-Sep-18 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
corporate revenue maximization

[27-Sep-18 05:06 PM] Alright#0419
you pay per valid share

[27-Sep-18 05:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`During the order's lifetime, the speed will even out and on average, it will be very close to the order's speed limit threshold.`

[27-Sep-18 05:06 PM] Alright#0419
you don't actually overpay

[27-Sep-18 05:07 PM] Alright#0419
it's just an order that should take 24h might take 6h

[27-Sep-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
that is incorrect logic

[27-Sep-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
using up 3x the rate, removes 2/3rd the inventory

[27-Sep-18 05:07 PM] Alright#0419
and be 10x your limit at some points

[27-Sep-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
driving up prices

[27-Sep-18 05:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
correct or not, that's always been their business model

[27-Sep-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and also tripling their revenues

[27-Sep-18 05:07 PM] Alright#0419
their support won't help you with anything ever

[27-Sep-18 05:07 PM] Alright#0419
don't even bother

[27-Sep-18 05:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and also tripling their revenues` <- every reason they do it, even though they will never admit that

[27-Sep-18 05:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
flat fee per order, so the more orders they fit in 24hrs is the more they make

[27-Sep-18 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
they dont make a percentage?

[27-Sep-18 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
if so, more hashrate sold, more revenues

[27-Sep-18 05:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, by "flat" I meant that their fee is *x* percent of the order total

[27-Sep-18 05:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so if the total is 1 BTC, they get the same fee if the order is 24 hrs or 2

[27-Sep-18 05:10 PM] Hot#2427
have u tried MRR?

[27-Sep-18 05:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I used mrr for a long, long time until the prevailing seller on MRR was just a reseller of NH hash

{Reactions}
trollface 

[27-Sep-18 05:11 PM] Hot#2427
oh 😂

[27-Sep-18 05:12 PM] SHossain#0007
2 times i used mrr. first time to mine BTCD and second time to mine CHIPS

[27-Sep-18 05:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there are a few MRR sellers that are actual owners, but I got tired of trying to sort it out and over paying

[27-Sep-18 05:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Merx once told me that they banned 1 guy from MRR because he was making more BTC reselling on MRR than the actual miners were

[27-Sep-18 05:15 PM] Flexatron#8809
Lmao

[27-Sep-18 05:26 PM] Flexatron#8809

Yup

[27-Sep-18 06:06 PM] Flexatron#8809
100M diff btw

[27-Sep-18 06:06 PM] Flexatron#8809
Based on which trade?

[27-Sep-18 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
mining cost per PIRATE seems to be 7 cents or so

[27-Sep-18 06:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_can't mine them fast enough to sell them for the market price of 0.08 KMD_

[27-Sep-18 06:08 PM] Flexatron#8809
