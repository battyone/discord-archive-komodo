If not careful pirate could get hurt here... this diff is silly

[31-Aug-18 02:41 PM] SHossain#0007
you mean, the diff should be up or down?

[31-Aug-18 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am switching hash when ever blocks get to fast or too slow

[31-Aug-18 02:42 PM] SHossain#0007
i can provide more hash in necessary 😃

[31-Aug-18 02:43 PM] SHossain#0007
even can cut down hash if necessary

[31-Aug-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I started with just my AMD GPUs but after 1000s they didnt find a block.. so i got MORRE hash

[31-Aug-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and this geting sily.. but PIRATE :trollface:

if only i knew how to use my gpu

[31-Aug-18 03:10 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm not sure about GPU mining

Same here @jorian  ^^

[31-Aug-18 04:17 PM] c2k#4915
im sure total noob questions but ...
1) where do i see my z-address, is that in agama somewhere? and 2) are there instructions anywhere on how to mine PIRATE?

[31-Aug-18 04:18 PM] SHossain#0007
You can't use PIRATE in Agama yet. Only CLI version

[31-Aug-18 04:19 PM] SHossain#0007
`./komodod -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225 -gen -genproclimit=x &`

`-genproclimit=x` replace x with the number of threads you want to use.

[31-Aug-18 04:21 PM] c2k#4915
hmmm. CLI is a lil above my head

This difficulty is about 0,5% of Komodo?

[31-Aug-18 05:54 PM] scubapanda#2485
Cool!

[31-Aug-18 05:58 PM] SHossain#0007
hash  should be more, given the potential of this coin

[31-Aug-18 06:51 PM] Privatoshi#9487
You know the best part of being a pirate, probably was collecting the booty. You know, the treasure. Ha!

[31-Aug-18 07:07 PM] Privatoshi#9487
WTB 10k Pirate

[31-Aug-18 07:09 PM] Alright#0419

@Privatoshi

[31-Aug-18 07:12 PM] Privatoshi#9487
How about 10KMD?

[31-Aug-18 07:13 PM] Alright#0419
no thanks :/

[31-Aug-18 07:13 PM] Alright#0419
no real reason to sell it if it's for 10KMD 😛

[31-Aug-18 07:15 PM] Alright#0419
WTT PIRATE for STAKED though

[31-Aug-18 07:23 PM] Alright#0419
how about 50k?

[31-Aug-18 07:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Will be traveling all day today. Will check system when back home

[31-Aug-18 07:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Will buy 50k pirate

[31-Aug-18 07:24 PM] SHossain#0007
i sold 10k for 25 KMD

[31-Aug-18 07:24 PM] SHossain#0007
😃

[31-Aug-18 07:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
50,000 / 1000 = 50 KMD

[31-Aug-18 07:24 PM] Alright#0419
will you take more at that price?

[31-Aug-18 07:24 PM] Alright#0419
more than 50k?

[31-Aug-18 07:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes

[31-Aug-18 07:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain what does that count to per pirate coin in kmd? 🤔

[31-Aug-18 07:26 PM] SHossain#0007
`0.0025 KMD per PIRATE`

[31-Aug-18 07:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
U got nice deal 👍
My price is same to buy 🙂

[31-Aug-18 07:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

Cool! Will buy at same I advertised

[31-Aug-18 07:33 PM] SHossain#0007
@grewalsatinder do you want to have the same old deal that we had earlier?

[31-Aug-18 07:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Okay 👌

[31-Aug-18 07:36 PM] SHossain#0007
cool. shall i send them in the same address?

[31-Aug-18 07:36 PM] SHossain#0007
looks like we have more pool miners joined the PIRATE party

[31-Aug-18 07:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes same is fine. Bit I can’t send KMD right now. Will send when back home.

[31-Aug-18 07:36 PM] SHossain#0007
no worries

[31-Aug-18 07:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

how is this happening?
all blocks mined by these addresses http://pirate.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/8c8858d3495d6e224ebedb438e68055f8168fbb4256fd8ee21ebf3f296246224

[31-Aug-18 07:49 PM] SHossain#0007
they have a lot of hash?

[31-Aug-18 07:49 PM] SHossain#0007
diff 1.13 Million

[31-Aug-18 07:51 PM] SHossain#0007

[31-Aug-18 07:58 PM] Alright#0419
at 1000/1 KMD, it's profitable to NH 😛

[31-Aug-18 08:05 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[31-Aug-18 08:06 PM] SHossain#0007
someone pointed 300 z9 mini equiv hash, increased the diff to 1.5 million and stopped mining

Nice action: difficulty: 1561420

[31-Aug-18 08:22 PM] scubapanda#2485
Under three second block time is faster than any pirate ship can shoot cannon ballz!

[31-Aug-18 08:24 PM] scubapanda#2485
How long does it take the diff to come down to current hash rate?

[31-Aug-18 08:31 PM] SHossain#0007
it will take some time now with current diff

[31-Aug-18 08:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Anyone want to answer this?

@satindergrewal @DESTINATIONphto 1) create a test enviroment 2) get most of supply 3) oh maybe lets trade it? No srsly you should not do it.

[31-Aug-18 08:44 PM] scubapanda#2485
So far so good, under 0.1% mined and 1.5mil difficulty.. ? Is there anything that stops that kind of hash power from rewriting the chain in a few hours? Edit, blocks are at #3371 so 2,2% mined already?

[31-Aug-18 08:46 PM] Alright#0419
more hash power

[31-Aug-18 08:47 PM] scubapanda#2485
Yes, please.

[31-Aug-18 08:47 PM] Alright#0419
or dpow, but an ac_private chain isn't supported atm

[31-Aug-18 08:51 PM] CHMEX#0686
its a bit over 4% that is already mined

[31-Aug-18 09:00 PM] scubapanda#2485
Total supply is just under 40mil so 2,167%?

[31-Aug-18 09:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Plz let BTT ANN thread ppl know ur views on mining and trading and whys etc there. I guess that will clear things up. Ultimately we keep the conversation engaged and educate more ppl about Komodo Platform, which is the end goal here. 🙂🙏🏼

[31-Aug-18 10:07 PM] Alright#0419
so I think a simple way to get dpow to work with a ac_private chain would be to allow t transactions as long as the sum of it's outputs isn't >0

[31-Aug-18 10:08 PM] Alright#0419
then the notaries could just pay the tx fee and send 0 sat txs to the RXL address

[31-Aug-18 10:17 PM] Alright#0419

[31-Aug-18 10:17 PM] Alright#0419
already works actually

{Reactions}
👍 

[31-Aug-18 10:28 PM] Alright#0419
pretty sure the only reason that says unparsed address is because that's actually a `faucetfund 0` tx

[01-Sep-18 12:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright that sounds kind of feasible

[01-Sep-18 12:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
so it would change from "no transparent outputs" to "no transparent outputs with non-zero amounts"

[01-Sep-18 12:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
then you can use OP_RETURN data for notarization stuff

[01-Sep-18 12:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright so NN's would pay a tx fee, and the miner of the block would have that txfee added to the block reward

[01-Sep-18 12:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright to be more specific, I don't think PIRATE should allow t->t xtns, even with amount=0, only z->t with amount=0

[01-Sep-18 12:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright your xtn worked because you used low-level CC functions which by-passed the checks for transparent outputs, sneaky 😃

I will test it out after some foodz, but that should allow what @Alright intended without hacking stuff via CC loopholes 😃

I have all my working GPUs on PIRATE trying to bring that diff down but still not getting any blocks lol. Managed to get nearly 100k so far 😄

[01-Sep-18 04:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
With my cpu on server I could only mine around 11k. Then stopped. So just bought. I know I can’t mine it anymore 😅

[01-Sep-18 04:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will buy more on same price

[01-Sep-18 05:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
ye can't have me PIRATE wallet.dat, it's buried in a wooden casket with Davy Jones

👌 (2) 😆 

[01-Sep-18 05:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am recompiling with my patch to z_sendmany above, and writing a test for private asset chains, because now that is easy

[01-Sep-18 05:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If we can have the notarizations for private asswtchains solved, I guess CC would be possible on private chains too?

[01-Sep-18 05:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Or that'd still be a t addr only?

[01-Sep-18 06:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder i believe it's still pretty hard
