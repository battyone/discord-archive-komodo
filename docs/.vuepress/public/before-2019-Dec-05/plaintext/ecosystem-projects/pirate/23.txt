@wookie don't wait for lite wallet

[08-Sep-18 02:23 AM] xoso#1057
z transactions will not be available on lite wallet anytime soon

[08-Sep-18 02:34 AM] wookie#7663
ok, thanks! I'm looking through the instructions

[08-Sep-18 02:39 AM] xoso#1057
if issues ask here

[08-Sep-18 03:23 AM] wookie#7663
@xoso how do I import a z address from a private key?

[08-Sep-18 03:24 AM] xoso#1057
where did you made your z address?

[08-Sep-18 03:25 AM] wookie#7663
from kmd in agama native

[08-Sep-18 03:25 AM] xoso#1057
I don't know agama app. I'm a command line nerd

[08-Sep-18 03:25 AM] xoso#1057
can use command line for kmd like this

[08-Sep-18 03:26 AM] xoso#1057
```
./komodo-cli z_exportkey "zaddr"
./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_importkey "zkey"```

[08-Sep-18 04:31 AM] xoso#1057
yes

[08-Sep-18 04:32 AM] xoso#1057
yes

[08-Sep-18 04:32 AM] xoso#1057
how can I help this community?

[08-Sep-18 04:32 AM] xoso#1057
I am a system administrator, a web developer, a basic core programming developer

[08-Sep-18 04:33 AM] xoso#1057
would you like a .onion website?

[08-Sep-18 04:35 AM] xoso#1057
yes can see

[08-Sep-18 04:35 AM] xoso#1057
then I don't need to do anything

[08-Sep-18 04:35 AM] xoso#1057
üòÉ

[08-Sep-18 04:38 AM] xoso#1057
it will take some time to figure that out for a new dev like myself :-)

[08-Sep-18 05:05 AM] wookie#7663
@xoso so I ran the command to run the PIRATE blockchain and connect to the network, it took a while giving me lines and lines like this:

[08-Sep-18 05:05 AM] wookie#7663
private chain nValue 243.20000000 iscoinbase.1
private chain nValue 12.80000000 iscoinbase.1

[08-Sep-18 05:05 AM] wookie#7663
and now it's paused

[08-Sep-18 05:05 AM] xoso#1057
that is good

[08-Sep-18 05:06 AM] xoso#1057
can try those getinfo commands from bitcointalk

[08-Sep-18 05:06 AM] wookie#7663
do I just wait until it returns to the command prompt?

[08-Sep-18 05:06 AM] xoso#1057
press enter key

[08-Sep-18 05:06 AM] xoso#1057
or use another terminal window or tab

[08-Sep-18 05:06 AM] wookie#7663
pressing enter just returns to the next line

Sorry, amateur question here: if I import my private key from a z address created in kmd agama into PIRATE via command line. Am I right to understand that the PIRATES sent into that z address is still tied that same private key?

[08-Sep-18 03:57 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Yes. Same privkey = same address
