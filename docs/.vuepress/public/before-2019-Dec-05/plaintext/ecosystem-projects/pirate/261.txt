Ladies and gentlemen.
I have been approached by an excahnge with 300+ daily BTC volume to list ARRR.
The exchange is CREX24.   I have used them and they are seamless in my experience.  No verifs needed.   Not sure of their daily limits.

This would put Pirate on Coin Market Cap!

The challenge... a .8 BTC listing fee.
This is about 4,000 KMD.

I will hold off on accepting ARRR for now so as not to hurt the low volume market when I have to exchange for BTC.

Please feel free to track that wallet address.   The amount of KMD we need is approximately 4,000.  I am sending my parts now.
One last thing to note....  If they cannot list us, we will be refunded the KMD.   Send me your TXID if you will want this refunded instead of applied to future pirate needs.

Official donation address for listing fees and other Pirate related costs is :  RMNJmRxcZ8gVuMo8sd6cRnZohkWzcpk3ou

It's just 0.8 BTC, seems like a small investment at an opportune time, especially now that there are several of us that have volunteered to get us over that line.

[04-Nov-18 02:45 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It‚Äôs more than the money.

[04-Nov-18 02:45 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[04-Nov-18 02:46 AM] KSanJuan#9608

[04-Nov-18 02:46 AM] cantptalblonit#9346
Understandable.

[04-Nov-18 02:46 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We will be pushing right on ahead to crex within let‚Äôs say....  1 month.     Even if dig pri gets on cmc.

[04-Nov-18 02:47 AM] cantptalblonit#9346
Good!

[04-Nov-18 02:47 AM] FishyGuts#5085
But i want to give triplex and his crew a chance to earn some volume, wear the crypto first trophy and have motivation to get on cmc.

[04-Nov-18 02:48 AM] KSanJuan#9608
Because it seems as if they've be very  good in getting this most curious of coins up and running, first.

[04-Nov-18 02:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
