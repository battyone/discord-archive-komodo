Quite cheap indeed

[29-Sep-18 03:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
some people just don't understand how trading works 🤦

[29-Sep-18 03:03 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I sold 2k at 0.07 this morning. Quite the contrast to be honest!

[29-Sep-18 03:03 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Few months it’s most likely to be 0.5 or even more 😒

[29-Sep-18 03:04 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Nobody can know that

[29-Sep-18 03:04 PM] Buddz1993#5380

`I sold 2k at 0.07 this morning. `
Do yourself a favor, anytime you think you want to sell, add at least 0.02 to your price 😛

Pirates don't use roads, so there's no roadmap

[29-Sep-18 03:05 PM] zatJUM#9924
Previous offer is over. Now WTS 8k @ 0.11 KMD or 0.00002 BTC each. Offer valid 2 hours. DM if interested.

[29-Sep-18 03:05 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I do know that it’s gonna be more than what you just sold that’s for sure :rofl

[29-Sep-18 03:05 PM] Buddz1993#5380
There’s a roadmap tbh at least a seamap 😄

[29-Sep-18 03:06 PM] 0x03#8822
more like a treasure map i guess

[29-Sep-18 03:06 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Info from Discord:

a rough answer of a roadmap/treasure map:
- Sapling upgrade: around March-April 2019, after it gets into Komodo Platform code
- Code upgrade for Pirate to allow new sapling z addresses formats: Q2 of 2019 or later
- further sea/ocean from after these upgrade are open big oceans. You never know which treasure is found or what unexpected possibilities it brings to Pirate. This would be the ultimate journey for Pirate which we don't know what will it be like.

if we go with ding-dong's theory, these aren't "OTC" trades either because there's no counter to be over 🤦

May as well try hard fork KMD instead, may be easier atm
