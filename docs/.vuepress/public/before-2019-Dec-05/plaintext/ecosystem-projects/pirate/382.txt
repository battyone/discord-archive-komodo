[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã if you know an android dev that can code the lite wallet send them my way

[29-Oct-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> i've got cli lite wallet working

[29-Oct-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> I was thinking to learn android dev üôÇ

[29-Oct-19 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> since we have Agama mobile, should not be so hard to part lite somehow

[29-Oct-19 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> btw Signal app has over 300k users

[29-Oct-19 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> not much

[29-Oct-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> but this gives as global estimation of how many people care for privacy for real

[29-Oct-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> btw I tried Signal and dont trust it to be private

[29-Oct-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> it's been funded by ex whatsapp ceo because fb decided to shaft whatsapp

[29-Oct-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> he poured $50M into signal

[29-Oct-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> that's the official line, but when the app asks you about you private data just after installation I do not trust it that much to be so private

[29-Oct-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> and needs to verify you mobile phone :trollface:

@PirateChain "back it up with an infographic that explains how it is much more private
yes bitcointalk used to be a good place for this, not sure anymore as it has changed over the years
maybe a signature campaign there might be worth exploring" -- jl777

[dscrd-prt] <FlyingDutchman> when website rebrand?

[30-Oct-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> _is glad "rebrand fever" hasn't descended upon his region of the world_

[30-Oct-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <FishyGuts> Website was rebranded about 6 months ago AFAIK.  

How often does a website need to be rebranded.  If we did another one this month, that would make it 3 different websites in 1 years time.

[30-Oct-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> To be fair, the website is extremely messy

[30-Oct-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> It's really hard to find what you need quickly

[30-Oct-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> "Rebranding" sounds a bit strong.

[30-Oct-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> A rearrangement or cleanup would be appreciated

[30-Oct-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> For example the link for "team" should be on top

[30-Oct-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> It's one of the first things I check on crypto websites

[30-Oct-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> We have all the new pages made, it's just a matte of creating a menu and reading the home page

[30-Oct-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> Let me know when you find a nice, clean, easy to navigate, official website for Bitcoin üôÉ

[30-Oct-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Should we rebrand to Bitcoin Pirate? :troll:

[30-Oct-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> BitcoinKomodoPirateHushGold

[30-Oct-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> BitcoinKomodoPirate~~Hush~~Gold

[30-Oct-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> with the last one included, we could get money from the idiots that bought BTCH

[30-Oct-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> PirateGold sounds nice

[30-Oct-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> More like currency

[30-Oct-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> what I miss on the fron page is short story how pirate chain came to exist

[30-Oct-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> why - because each time I see a new coin I do the same all crypto enthusiasts do

[30-Oct-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> ask myself wtf a new coin ?

[30-Oct-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> and here the answer is fair and easy and deserves to be on top of front page to explain to anyone having the primal doubt "wtf new coin"

[30-Oct-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> I did publish that story on pirate reddit, could be shaped better and put there

[30-Oct-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> I'll add that to the list  @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã, thanks!
