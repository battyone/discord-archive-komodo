How to set min payout for piratepool.io

[20-Oct-18 09:29 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Equal you can’t.

[20-Oct-18 09:30 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The z tx take a lot of compute power so to keep it from overloading the min payout has to be increased because the pool is so busy.

[20-Oct-18 09:30 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Switching to a different pool will help.   The others don’t habe that many miners.

[20-Oct-18 09:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I’m switching shortly myself

What is min payout now on piratpool.oi?
Thanks #fishyguts

[20-Oct-18 09:33 AM] FishyGuts#5085
25 pirate right now.

[20-Oct-18 09:34 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If the miners continue to load up at piratepool.io then I will seee if @webworker01 will probably increase fee to 2% to encourage distribution.  (I hope)

[20-Oct-18 10:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It is done on a separate server.

[20-Oct-18 10:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The bot dev has purchased a nuclear powered server that will hopefully speed up the transactions.

We may need to disable soak until the new server arrives or we add an auto z_mergeto function maybe?
