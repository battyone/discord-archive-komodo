150k offer is open, 0.025 sound pretty good.

[25-Sep-18 01:41 PM] Decker#3767
WTS 45000 PIRATE @ 1250 KMD (1 PIRATE = ~0.027 KMD, i know this is little bit more than 0.02, but diff is growing 😃

does somebody have a calculation logic for what it costs to mine one PIRATE in KMD or BTC

[25-Sep-18 02:25 PM] CHMEX#0686
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ^ thinking you might have a good way to calculate it as you do a living off it?

[25-Sep-18 02:31 PM] Mylo#8306
Yes, it is 37 PIRATE to 1 KMD.  It's a calculation logic, not a very accurate one though but does use a prime number.

[25-Sep-18 02:48 PM] BigCat45#4982
I might sell one of my wallets as well. 750.000 (well, technically it's 749.511) for   20.000 KMD.

[25-Sep-18 03:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what it costs to mine one PIRATE`
@CHMEX the answer is :
`Cost_to_mine_1_block/256`

[25-Sep-18 03:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
:trollface:

[25-Sep-18 03:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`blocksPerHashRatePerDay = 24 / ((CurrentBlock.difficulty * Math.pow(2,32)) / ((Math.pow(10,9) * Current.ksols) * 3600))` is about as close as you can come to being "accurate"

[25-Sep-18 03:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've personally found that the real-world amount is about 1/2 that

[25-Sep-18 03:24 PM] scubapanda#2485
@CHMEX Quickly calculated .. it would cost about 0,7-0,8 BTC to mine 240k PIRATE in 24h as an added hash power (7-8MSol) to current 4MSol. If nothing changed.

[25-Sep-18 03:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

becase it was from z -> z ... and PIRATEs on my z address achieved from https://pirate.komodostats.com/ pool in many utxos. so, 22 mins for 35 outputs is normal. wondered. we need sappling )

[25-Sep-18 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
it is normal and actually faster than expected

[25-Sep-18 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810

Why does `createrawtransaction` not accept z addy as a valid addy?

no, I look at block diff and not "network diff"

[25-Sep-18 05:15 PM] wookie#7663
is it correct then to say that, because of the crazy influx of FOMO miners, the difficulty to find blocks is "ridiculous" but if you find one, it's not as difficult to mine???

just trying to make a joking analogy...the followup line to that was going to be "sounds like tonnes of Pirates sailing around the seas trying to find buried treasure chests/blocks"

i guess i'm almost synced anyway, now in the 25K range

just testing things now, but okay 😃
