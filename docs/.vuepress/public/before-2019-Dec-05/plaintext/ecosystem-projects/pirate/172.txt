Newsworthy in of itself already.

[15-Oct-18 06:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
First cryptocurrency exchange to accept z deposit/withdraw is significant news.

[15-Oct-18 06:10 PM] snowdamn#2414

[15-Oct-18 06:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If that news don’t make crypto media a buzz they are the biggest fools

In another simple analogy comparing Any other privacy coin to pirate is like looking for a person in a city where ppl can be seen but very hard to identify since they are all clones (run attack of clones scene here from star wars). And hard to find a pirate who are all invisible in the wide ocean 🌊.
Far superior technology to beat with 99.99% of pirates being invisible

I've been on Twitter & even sent out a tweet, about Pirate, to a College Football head coach, with 100k+ followers that loves Pirates.. I hope you responds... 
But I think the project is cool & I'm just trying to support where I can... Great project guys!!

[15-Oct-18 10:35 PM] Llama#1330

[15-Oct-18 10:41 PM] Privatoshi#9487
The PirateChain response was great!!!

Well if he is interested, we can send him a mighty fine short sword crafted somewhere in the southern European isles.  

It's is more a decoration and a trophy, but will serve it's purpose if needed!

[15-Oct-18 10:42 PM] Privatoshi#9487
He's the Washington State Football head coach, Mike Leach, if anyone watches football.
