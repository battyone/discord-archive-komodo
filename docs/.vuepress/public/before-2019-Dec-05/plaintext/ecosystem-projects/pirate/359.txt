Did you not read the T&C's when signing up and giving your money away?

[02-Dec-18 07:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
Or better yet, are you sure you should be trading on an exchange if you did not know that?

[02-Dec-18 07:44 PM] DmanXX#2257
No I didn’t

[02-Dec-18 07:45 PM] DmanXX#2257
Well i usually withdraw right after purchase

[02-Dec-18 07:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
That's irrelevant to the matter at hand.

[02-Dec-18 07:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
You still have funds there

[02-Dec-18 07:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
But either way... just stay calm. Funds are safe

[02-Dec-18 07:47 PM] DmanXX#2257
I am calm lol

[02-Dec-18 07:48 PM] DmanXX#2257
All I said that it looks like

[02-Dec-18 07:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
Someone should let @Skeets know that sapling is coming. He said he'll be back in 3 months. We wouldn't want skeets burn his funds :trollface:

[02-Dec-18 07:48 PM] DmanXX#2257
OMG

[02-Dec-18 07:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
I strongly advise doing a bit of research before making accusations. Saying that "it looks like" is still an accusation

[02-Dec-18 07:50 PM] DmanXX#2257
Well maybe dp should get back to their customers

[02-Dec-18 07:50 PM] DmanXX#2257
We wouldn’t have this problem

[02-Dec-18 07:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
Well, maybe they made an announcement and their customers ignored it.

[02-Dec-18 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
how many days since you submitted ticket to DP?

[02-Dec-18 07:51 PM] DmanXX#2257
6 days

[02-Dec-18 07:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
Have you tried their discord channel?

[02-Dec-18 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
that is too long

[02-Dec-18 07:52 PM] DmanXX#2257
No I don’t I was looking here for it

https://discord.gg/yCVcsN

[02-Dec-18 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
well , they will say no withdraw until sapling

[02-Dec-18 07:53 PM] DmanXX#2257
Thank you

[02-Dec-18 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
but they should have

[02-Dec-18 07:53 PM] mrlynch#5735
Check their announcements channel

[02-Dec-18 07:54 PM] DmanXX#2257
I checked telegram but no channel there

[02-Dec-18 07:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
TripleX is on & off until Mon, possibly Tue

[02-Dec-18 07:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
But he left a message on whom to contact

[02-Dec-18 07:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
@jl777c it is too long indeed, but TripleX announced that he is relocating and he will be mostly off. Not sure if the others picked up on all the tickets they most likely received

[02-Dec-18 07:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
@DmanXX also check their #support channel

[02-Dec-18 07:58 PM] DmanXX#2257
Ok will do, but now I know what is going on I really don’t need them on this

[02-Dec-18 07:58 PM] DmanXX#2257
You guys explained everything

[02-Dec-18 07:59 PM] mrlynch#5735
Happy to help!

"We"? Do you have a mouse in your pocket or are you a member of the Royal Family?

[02-Dec-18 10:16 PM] kp#3190
just wanted to give a big thank you to the dumpers ❤

[02-Dec-18 10:17 PM] kp#3190

[02-Dec-18 11:43 PM] cryptobankz#2642
Hi

[02-Dec-18 11:44 PM] cryptobankz#2642
Please what is the minimum payout threshold?

[02-Dec-18 11:46 PM] cryptobankz#2642
I’ve been mining on pirtaepool.io I’ve been receiving payments all@of the sudden I can see my balance but no payout for days now.

[02-Dec-18 11:47 PM] cryptobankz#2642
Which other pools are good with decent hashrate and reward?

[02-Dec-18 11:48 PM] cryptobankz#2642
Please it will be better to try others.  256 is a lot.

[02-Dec-18 11:48 PM] cryptobankz#2642
Sure I will.

[02-Dec-18 11:49 PM] cryptobankz#2642
Where on the homepage can I find the details of other pools?

[02-Dec-18 11:54 PM] cryptobankz#2642
Many thanks.

I imported my PIRATE Z priv keys into another wallet, now when I try and send those coins I get this error:
"Error Code: -4
Message: Witness for note commitment is null"
I tried re-index & re-scan, but no change ... any ideas?

[03-Dec-18 01:00 AM] Exile13#4458
@Don King what is this *another wallet* you are seeing

[03-Dec-18 01:19 AM] Don King#8901
I copied a  Z private key to make a paper wallet for mining in September, now I am importing that priv key into another wallet on another PC. I can see my coin balance ok, but When I try and send them I get that error.

[03-Dec-18 01:28 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Delete pirate folder. Uninstall and reinstall and resync

[03-Dec-18 01:38 AM] Don King#8901
Ok, will try that, thanks!

I wonder what the general reaction is, honestly...

[03-Dec-18 02:46 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
I can easily see it being taken the wrong way. And I feel it's best when seen only once and not on repeat...
