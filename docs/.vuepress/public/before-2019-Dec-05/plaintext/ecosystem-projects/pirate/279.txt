Dumpers be dumpin' though

[07-Nov-18 07:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
30 people.

[07-Nov-18 07:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
30 people is how many contributors to the pirate project I count including the 9 internation translators.

[07-Nov-18 07:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Wow.

[07-Nov-18 07:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
21 developers of different skill sets and levels.

[07-Nov-18 07:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085
With at least SOME input to the creation growth or continuance.

[07-Nov-18 07:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So when someone asks how many contributors...  "The Pirateecosystem has had 30 devs and contributors with eyes and hands on the project."

pretty impressive guys, wish i started mining this a couple months ago

[07-Nov-18 07:17 AM] CiPhEr#2091
i learned more about pirate from watching a voskshill vid

[07-Nov-18 07:19 AM] CiPhEr#2091
seems like zksnarks is superior to the ringtransaction tech that xmr uses. I also like that pirate forces shielded tx's, seems it would produce more anonymity for entire blockchain rather than just a few % being shielded

it's not good we dont have daily Arrr production sold - it means it is stashed and gonna be dumped if price move little up (unless there are really strong hands) but each hands are strong untill need to pay bills you know :pirate:

[07-Nov-18 07:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Hope to see those cheering here then 😉

[07-Nov-18 07:51 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
we need to get daily 30 new buyers to sustain the price and avoid sudden dump

[07-Nov-18 07:51 AM] CiPhEr#2091
after seeing what ravencoin has done i'm definitely thinking this is my second chance to actually hold something

[07-Nov-18 07:52 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@CiPhEr  not it's not  - if yo uthink like all the people - buy, hodl, do nothing it wont.

[07-Nov-18 07:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
What is the price these days?

the intrinsic value of a super secure and always private coin that rivals monero, yeah this is going places. i'm sure pirate will be on one of the top 3 exchanges within a year

[07-Nov-18 07:55 AM] CiPhEr#2091
would be cool for pirate to be used also as an attractant to the kmd platform for similar would-be developers to get new projects off the ground & make already flying ones much more secure.

[07-Nov-18 07:56 AM] CiPhEr#2091
perhaps this is the coin that could get the hyperdex into warp drive popularity if in the future it was compatible with shielded tx's

Not that it matters to most people, but DP seems to have a market calculation/GUI err where that shows as a sell (dump) rather than a buy 😕

[07-Nov-18 12:11 PM] Oszy#5734

at one point yesterday I was contemplating binning every piece and spending a bajillion dollars to buy all cisco products, because **every** anything that tells how I need to do what I need done is only shown with cisco shit and only cli 😣

[07-Nov-18 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if I had all cisco products, I could have had it done in like 10 minutes 🤣

Hi folks, anyone knows who is running piratepool.io?

[07-Nov-18 12:23 PM] P3L3#1096
but then again you would have spent a ton.. 
we do MikroTik and you can go both cli and gui..

trying to figure out if I can set the difficulty on the pool config on the rig side. Well, Mining Rig Rental side, to be sure...

[07-Nov-18 12:24 PM] jansako#3330
I rented several A9's, and some of them are complaining about diff being too low

[07-Nov-18 12:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jansako no, you can't port diffs are set in pool config

[07-Nov-18 12:24 PM] P3L3#1096
i think its webworker01

[07-Nov-18 12:24 PM] jansako#3330
right, thx!

[07-Nov-18 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
port 2097 should be plenty for rental (especially if only A9s)

[07-Nov-18 12:26 PM] jansako#3330
that is what I got there, it works for the 4 out of 6 A9's, but not the two others

[07-Nov-18 12:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I said Buy pressure will drop the price... at LEAST for two months.

[07-Nov-18 02:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It's unlrealistic to assume we're gonna get 30+ new buyers a day at this phase.

Just FYI :)

I’m guessing the price will level very close to mining cost when there is nothing major happening. World is full of miners that are happy with 5-10% profit on their daily mining rewards.

[07-Nov-18 03:29 PM] BlockTech#6895
Exactly, well not as long as Jl777 has his buy order at 0,1 KMD, two scenario are possible, hashrate increasing to 200Msol/s and more or price dumping to 0,06  0,07 ...
