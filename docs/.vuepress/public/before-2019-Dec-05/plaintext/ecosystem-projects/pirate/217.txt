also, if you didn't send, you're probably not going to get anything but an empty set anyway

[24-Oct-18 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the sender needs to be the one to provide the txid

if you had a lot small amounts and you transfer one big it can take long

[24-Oct-18 04:49 PM] c2k#4915
@LoPhatMelk was your wallet at 100% sync before starting your transfer ?

[24-Oct-18 04:50 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
@c2k I believe it was

[24-Oct-18 04:51 PM] c2k#4915
does it show 100% sync now?

[24-Oct-18 05:05 PM] Exile13#4458
thank you! is there a way to view where the hasrate is coming from

[24-Oct-18 05:06 PM] Exile13#4458
im swtiching between all the pools, to calculate, and numbers seem off, that could be because of third party hosting?

[24-Oct-18 05:07 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
@c2k yes its 100% with 8 connections

[24-Oct-18 05:08 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
a smaller amount transferred, but larger amounts wont for some reason

[24-Oct-18 05:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Exile13 There isn't even an accurate way to measure network hash, much less who has what

@LoPhatMelk i would DM @FishyGuts who may be able to direct you to someone else more qualified to help you

[24-Oct-18 05:16 PM] Algorismus#9195
the rig has the same cards with same memory type, overclocking shouldn't be the issue

[24-Oct-18 05:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I can’t help with Agama issues.

[24-Oct-18 05:17 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
@c2k Thanks, I'm in the agama chat help right now as well, but so far no real help.

[24-Oct-18 05:17 PM] penguin#0544
memory is irrelevant for equihash

[24-Oct-18 05:17 PM] Exile13#4458
maybe check the github or post there for tech help with mining?

[24-Oct-18 05:17 PM] Oszy#5734
have you done the mergetoaddress?

[24-Oct-18 05:18 PM] penguin#0544
it could be that your overall power usage, is just a bit too high

[24-Oct-18 05:18 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
No, @Oszy I'm not sure what that is

[24-Oct-18 05:18 PM] penguin#0544
see if all fan speeds are the same

[24-Oct-18 05:18 PM] Oszy#5734
Do it that's the only solution for your problem.

[24-Oct-18 05:19 PM] Oszy#5734
It consolidates all your smaller transactions into bigger a amount which you can then send  much quicker

[24-Oct-18 05:19 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
oh ok

[24-Oct-18 05:19 PM] Oszy#5734
it's a command line command for CLI

[24-Oct-18 05:19 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
ok

[24-Oct-18 05:19 PM] penguin#0544
it could be an issue with the riser/cable

[24-Oct-18 05:19 PM] Oszy#5734
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  i think already advised you this in #deleted-channel

[24-Oct-18 05:20 PM] Algorismus#9195
@penguin  the error keeps appearing even though i change the oc settings back to stock

[24-Oct-18 05:22 PM] penguin#0544
ever had an issue before? I assume you've restarted the rig and done basic checks? Tried a different riser+cable on that card ?

[24-Oct-18 05:22 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
@Oszy Sorry I'm a bit new to this and still trying to understand it all

[24-Oct-18 05:22 PM] Oszy#5734
It's ok just listen to the people trying to help you 😛

[24-Oct-18 05:24 PM] penguin#0544
If you have a screen attached to gpu0, then launch miner without gpu0, see what that does

[24-Oct-18 05:24 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
@Oszy its not that I'm not listening, it's that I dont fully understand. And you gotta admit, @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 isnt the easiest guy to talk to...

[24-Oct-18 05:24 PM] Algorismus#9195
no, never had an issue or what'soever

[24-Oct-18 05:24 PM] Algorismus#9195
i tried to swap the card on another slot

[24-Oct-18 05:24 PM] Algorismus#9195
the problem remains the same

[24-Oct-18 05:25 PM] Algorismus#9195
my screen in plugged to the mobo, and the monitor is unplugged anyways

[24-Oct-18 05:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@LoPhatMelk I may be a dick about certain things, but if I ever leave you hanging about something technical make sure to let me know

{Reactions}
rum 👍 

[24-Oct-18 05:26 PM] Algorismus#9195
let me disable the gpu #4 and see what it does

[24-Oct-18 05:27 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 sent you a PM sir

[24-Oct-18 05:29 PM] Algorismus#9195
quick qestion, the bminer scheme is set to startum. should it be set to something different?

[24-Oct-18 05:30 PM] penguin#0544
stratum is fine, is the better method

[24-Oct-18 05:31 PM] penguin#0544
you are certain, your psu still has some headroom ?

[24-Oct-18 05:33 PM] penguin#0544
If it is very close to max draw, underpower all card by 5%, see what that does

[24-Oct-18 05:34 PM] penguin#0544
you've mined on equihash before I assume?

[24-Oct-18 05:38 PM] penguin#0544
If so.. I'm stumped

[24-Oct-18 05:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OR... don't give away 2% of your hash and use EWBF's 0.3.4b instead of bminer ...

[24-Oct-18 05:44 PM] Algorismus#9195
@penguin  yes i am familiar with equihash, i used dstm and ewbf to mine equihash based coins. I am still familiarizing myself with Bminer.
i just tried underpowering my other cards, didn't work.

[24-Oct-18 05:48 PM] penguin#0544
Yeah, that's the next step, lol - If you haven't checked what EWBF does

[24-Oct-18 05:49 PM] Algorismus#9195
my adress does not appear on the pool when i use ewbf. the bat file runs fine and it shows the connexion being established with the pool.

[24-Oct-18 05:49 PM] Algorismus#9195
however when i enter my adress on the pool's website. it appears innactive.

[24-Oct-18 05:50 PM] Algorismus#9195
i wasted power for more than 2 hours

[24-Oct-18 05:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Algorismus  are you using a z address? or an R address?

[24-Oct-18 05:52 PM] Algorismus#9195
zadress

[24-Oct-18 05:52 PM] Algorismus#9195
the same adress works fine when i use bminer

[24-Oct-18 05:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
which pool?

[24-Oct-18 05:53 PM] Algorismus#9195
piratepool.io

[24-Oct-18 05:55 PM] marv101#8481
It needs to be a t address as far as I know. from there you send it to z address and you can send them from there

[24-Oct-18 05:56 PM] Oszy#5734
Nope that's solo

[24-Oct-18 05:56 PM] marv101#8481
ah, okay

[24-Oct-18 05:57 PM] penguin#0544
@Algorismus  See what options your mainboard has for pci-e slots - 'downgrade' to gen1 if it isn't

[24-Oct-18 05:57 PM] marv101#8481
so is pool mining is rather recommended then? I'll employ one z9 mini miner

[24-Oct-18 05:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`miner --fee 0 --server stratum.piratepool.io --port 2095 --user zcSoGfGho3muy5jVAyqaXnfSnMv8vWfjWVotF5WK8qHtcuf3TysoV4iizrC68U8PrYGRipvZFdS4XaVqn2CEqb8GHyHNn3b.beast --pass x --intensity 50`
Works for me with EWBF 0.3.4b

[24-Oct-18 05:58 PM] Oszy#5734
For only 1 z9 mini pool is recommended

[24-Oct-18 05:58 PM] Exile13#4458
@marv101 ya mining solo means you are going against the hashrate of whoever else is mining, for example there are just a few people on two of the pools, you can see they do not find many blocks compared to the pools with the larger hashrate
