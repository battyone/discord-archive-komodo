might buy some aswell

[28-Nov-18 02:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@deepwaterH2O we don’t have the attorney letters complete yet for a listing on Bittrex.  
@DmanXX - the exchange has been diligently working to ensure our wallets have no issues.  We’re not sure yet when deposits and withdwas will be smoother until Sapling gets implemented in a few weeks.   That should solve the exchange wallet issues we have.

[28-Nov-18 02:16 PM] DmanXX#2257
Is it safe to buy more and keep it there for now?

[28-Nov-18 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as safe as it ever was or will be

[28-Nov-18 02:18 PM] house#8741
It is safe @DmanXX

[28-Nov-18 02:19 PM] house#8741
They are really good and always follow through

[28-Nov-18 02:19 PM] house#8741
I think I did too many 30k withdraws 🤪

[28-Nov-18 02:20 PM] DmanXX#2257
I wrote to dp and nobody responded back

[28-Nov-18 02:20 PM] house#8741
They will and not to worry matey

[28-Nov-18 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think it was micro deposits, not withdraws (no factual evidence, just an educated guess)

Hello everyone

[28-Nov-18 02:21 PM] DmanXX#2257
Longest it’s safe I don’t have problem to keep it there , but I try not to keep anything on exchanges

[28-Nov-18 02:22 PM] hfaz63#1930

[28-Nov-18 02:23 PM] house#8741

[28-Nov-18 02:25 PM] hfaz63#1930
near 5000 ARRR coins are lost

[28-Nov-18 02:25 PM] house#8741
did you format the drive ?

[28-Nov-18 02:25 PM] hfaz63#1930

TestDisk
TestDisk is a free and open source data recovery software tool designed to recover lost partition and unerase deleted files.

[28-Nov-18 02:27 PM] house#8741
same would happen with any wallet @hfaz63

[28-Nov-18 02:27 PM] hfaz63#1930
I tried 5 different softwares for recovery but none could find my wallet info

[28-Nov-18 02:28 PM] house#8741
if you forget to save your wif, or wallet.dat

[28-Nov-18 02:28 PM] hfaz63#1930
I use Exodus and Coinomi

[28-Nov-18 02:29 PM] house#8741
do you own the keys/coins in them ?

[28-Nov-18 02:30 PM] hfaz63#1930
yeah

[28-Nov-18 02:30 PM] house#8741
if you forgot to save your password, you would lose all coins there too

[28-Nov-18 02:31 PM] hfaz63#1930
they both give me some way to recover my coins but it is only Agama which does not give you 15  words so that I can easily recover ARRR coins

[28-Nov-18 02:32 PM] house#8741

@hfaz63 how so?

[28-Nov-18 02:33 PM] hfaz63#1930
we need a betetr wallet for Pirate coins... A one that than be like coinomi wallet.

[28-Nov-18 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
define "better"

[28-Nov-18 02:34 PM] SHossain#0007
Coinomi spent millions of $$$ to make that wallet

[28-Nov-18 02:34 PM] hfaz63#1930
coinomi has given me a recovery phrase

[28-Nov-18 02:34 PM] SHossain#0007
since that is their main product

[28-Nov-18 02:34 PM] hfaz63#1930
which I can use easily to recover my coins and unfortunately Agama does not do that for Pirate ARRR

[28-Nov-18 02:34 PM] SHossain#0007
Agama gives you WIF which is similar as receovry phrase

`coinomi has given me a recovery phrase`
because they store your shit, you don't have complete trustless ownership

[28-Nov-18 02:36 PM] hfaz63#1930
when you install coinomi and exodus wallet , they make you write down your recovery seed but in Agama i was never told to go to my wallet and as for its WIF and write it down...no warning at all

[28-Nov-18 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽

[28-Nov-18 02:37 PM] hfaz63#1930
If people who created Agama were betetr, they would give us more info when using their wallet for piare

Saving wallet.dat and private keys is always the first step when installing a wallet for me.

[28-Nov-18 02:40 PM] hfaz63#1930
Fishy guts I am new to these kinds of coins and wallets...so far I had no problem with coinomi and exodus wallets

[28-Nov-18 02:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Seed phrases are helpful too, but that .dat and WIF are the Agama versions.   

There COULD be a warning for Agama when you activate a coin for the first time to let you know to save your wallet and wif

[28-Nov-18 02:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I can appreciate that @hfaz63

[28-Nov-18 02:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The mobile wallets function a little different and while the seed phrases will help with recovery, the wallet.dat and WIF are more robust in my opinion.

[28-Nov-18 02:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I’m sorry this happened.

Do you have Agama reinstalled?    

Save your wallet.dat file and write down your WIF in two separate spots.   Treat  those things like giant piles of money.   Keep them safe and hidden.

Two separate pieces of paper.    Put one in one safe spot and the other in another safe spot.
