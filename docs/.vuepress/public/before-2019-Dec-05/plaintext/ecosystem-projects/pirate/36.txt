too late, bought ZEC, don't know when sold those WLC 😄

[24-Sep-18 11:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
WTB PIRATE @ 0.015 KMD

[24-Sep-18 11:16 PM] scubapanda#2485
Got Ubuntu on the correct chain. Would really like to hear if anyone has High Sierra macOS version running. Compiles without problems and even says it's the current version (PIRATE halving changed to 388885 270.1 days) but log if full of "ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: joinsplit requirements not met" and nothing else.

[24-Sep-18 11:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
what command you are using to start this assetchain ?

[24-Sep-18 11:20 PM] scubapanda#2485
The one on the top of this Discord page.

[24-Sep-18 11:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
then debug.log can give you some clue what's wrong

[24-Sep-18 11:22 PM] scubapanda#2485
Thanks, can't figure it out so that's why I'm asking if its working for anyone else with High Sierra macOS. Earlier versions, no problem.

[24-Sep-18 11:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I haven't tried on osx

[24-Sep-18 11:24 PM] scubapanda#2485
My debug log just gets filled with ""ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: joinsplit requirements not met"". Oh well 😃

[24-Sep-18 11:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I assume you compiled komodod on osx
can you plz confirm the branch it's compiled on?

[24-Sep-18 11:29 PM] scubapanda#2485
git checkout dev
git pull
make clean

[24-Sep-18 11:29 PM] scubapanda#2485
./zcutil/build-mac.sh

[24-Sep-18 11:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
should have built with ./zcutil/build.sh

[24-Sep-18 11:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I remember I recently compiled on mac using same linux build.sh command

[24-Sep-18 11:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
jus a sec that was zcash 🤔

[24-Sep-18 11:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
let me check again

[24-Sep-18 11:31 PM] scubapanda#2485
I don't think that will work either..

[24-Sep-18 11:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
compiling again

[24-Sep-18 11:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
let's see

[24-Sep-18 11:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, it was compiled with build.sh
`-rwxr-xr-x  1 satinder  staff    15M 29 Aug 21:00 src/komodod`

[24-Sep-18 11:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
about a month ago

[24-Sep-18 11:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
anyway waiting for this compile to finish

[24-Sep-18 11:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
then will try that command

[24-Sep-18 11:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
```configure: error: Cannot enable RELRO```
😅

[24-Sep-18 11:34 PM] scubapanda#2485
Yep.

[24-Sep-18 11:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
had xcode update, installing update

[24-Sep-18 11:36 PM] scubapanda#2485
I have all the updates, I believe. All was fine until today's update. Anyways, need to rest, hope we find a working solutions. Many thanks for your help, back later!

[25-Sep-18 12:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[25-Sep-18 12:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
afaik, you can't  send to any t (coinbase or not)
Was curious if it needed to be t>z>z or if I can just t>z

[25-Sep-18 12:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
k, tnks

[25-Sep-18 12:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

How to get pirate?

[25-Sep-18 12:59 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Mine it or find a seller

[25-Sep-18 01:00 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Any links for mining and is it good to mine w nvidia

[25-Sep-18 01:00 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Thanks

[25-Sep-18 01:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at the moment, PIRATE is only good to mine with GPU if you have a bunch of them or get in a pool

[25-Sep-18 01:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or don't expect a "daily pay"

[25-Sep-18 01:01 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Ya I have 1080ti’s

[25-Sep-18 01:04 AM] Hermes#6934
Z transactions only ...sounds like a pitch to enter a distinctive club

[25-Sep-18 01:06 AM] Don King#8901
Did the airdrop happen yet?

[25-Sep-18 01:06 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Who receives airdrop

[25-Sep-18 01:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@scubapanda compiled using build-mac.sh
executed this command:
`./komodod -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=37.9.62.186 -addnode=136.243.102.225 -daemon`

[25-Sep-18 01:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can confirm it starts and syncing perfectly fine

[25-Sep-18 01:30 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
When I did command prompt i didn’t have to paste anything and it gave me a name and password, do I change that

[25-Sep-18 01:40 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Nvm

[25-Sep-18 02:43 AM] Don King#8901
@DR3WSKi bitcointalk users who PM'd PIRATE z address , cut off was a few days ago

[25-Sep-18 02:45 AM] Don King#8901
More accurate description is probably giveaway rather than airdrop

I thought something simple might look good, The black background from imgur makes it look weird, but the thought was slightly more piratey komodo logo...ARHH!

[25-Sep-18 05:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has never been that, ever_

[25-Sep-18 05:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol... with an infection like this the only way to getrid of it fast is by fasting.... Otherwise id had to take a bunch of antibiotics and risk getting sicker later.

[25-Sep-18 05:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
given the choice to fight an infection between going hungry and using drugs designed for that purpose, I'm getting a burger on the way to the drug store :trollface:

[25-Sep-18 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
meh... only the first 2 days of a fast are hard.

[25-Sep-18 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
after that dont really get hungry, spent those 2 days in bed, didnt even notice I hadn't eaten

[25-Sep-18 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its time for a bulletproof coffee though 😄

[25-Sep-18 05:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure I'd be willing to go 2 days without food for all the coinage that jl has privkeys to 🍽

[25-Sep-18 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha... yeah its been over a year since I did it last, last time was hell... went over a week fast, worth it though. really helps the body clense, if you need to do that.

[25-Sep-18 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess I made a few days now may as well use it as an excuse to do another

[25-Sep-18 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[25-Sep-18 05:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there is no part of me that could go a week

[25-Sep-18 05:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[25-Sep-18 05:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
