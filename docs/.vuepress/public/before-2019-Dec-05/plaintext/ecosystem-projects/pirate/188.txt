The one the guy linked

[19-Oct-18 09:08 PM] Oszy#5734
That is a reply to his comment. 😛

[19-Oct-18 09:09 PM] Oszy#5734
He linked a digitanote fork coin which i thought is a monero fork

welcome kaks! 😃

[19-Oct-18 09:17 PM] kaks#6612
thanks guys lets support this project 💪

[19-Oct-18 09:21 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
My inno z master makes me 30.00 a day or average.  I love asic....and Bitmain is not the only provider

[19-Oct-18 09:21 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
GPU mining will die sooner or later.  It's sad...but true

[19-Oct-18 09:21 PM] 0x03#8822
if "bitmain wants to do kyc soon" is no joke, others will follow

[19-Oct-18 09:21 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
Also....Im under the impression that Komodo will never fork from ASIC

[19-Oct-18 09:22 PM] 0x03#8822
and then, yes, asic mining will suck 😄

[19-Oct-18 09:22 PM] penguin#0544
nah, there is an insane amount of applications for gpu coming out soon

[19-Oct-18 09:22 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
time will tell

[19-Oct-18 09:22 PM] penguin#0544
however it won't ofcourse be as profitable as right now

[19-Oct-18 09:22 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
thats my point

[19-Oct-18 09:22 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
people want money

[19-Oct-18 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
hash per watt is all that matters

[19-Oct-18 09:23 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
real value coins will go to asic

[19-Oct-18 09:23 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
yep

[19-Oct-18 09:23 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
hash per watt

[19-Oct-18 09:23 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
ASIC is the winner

[19-Oct-18 09:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@TrueCryptoMiner  `Today at 4:21 PM
Also....Im under the impression that Komodo will never fork from ASIC`
That's correct

[19-Oct-18 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
anything else is being a luddite

[19-Oct-18 09:23 PM] penguin#0544
the thing to grasp, is that gpu's are multi-asics 😃

[19-Oct-18 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
not that there is anything wrong with that as long as you dont try to force such views on to a rational thought based project

[19-Oct-18 09:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Any forking that Komodo does, will never be for hw specific reasons

[19-Oct-18 09:24 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
My electric bill is around $1000.00 per month

[19-Oct-18 09:24 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
but im making good profit still

[19-Oct-18 09:27 PM] penguin#0544
What's the latest news on the fpga's and mining ?

[19-Oct-18 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i am also curious about fpga and what they can realistically do for equihash

[19-Oct-18 09:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've read about a few FPGA projects that are supposedly better than the current ASICs, but so far nothing with actual facts or data

[19-Oct-18 09:33 PM] jl777c#5810
seems good for a hobbyist, but mass produced, all the advantages of fpga are gone

[19-Oct-18 09:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but i guess you can get it working much faster than making a new ASIC

[19-Oct-18 09:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
heh and cheaper too, I'd imagine

[19-Oct-18 09:34 PM] penguin#0544
There is the Acorn though, but i'm not familiar with spec versus available asic

[19-Oct-18 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810
100 fpga vs fabcost inhouse...

[19-Oct-18 09:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw, current block diff is 2x what it was 4 hrs ago

[19-Oct-18 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess you need both to play the big game

[19-Oct-18 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810
the Vosk effect

[19-Oct-18 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
i wonder how much of it is rentals

[19-Oct-18 09:38 PM] WeyezOD#1176
14 hours ago the Dexstat calculator estimated my A9  a return of 386 PIRATE / 24 hours. Currently it's estimating 165 PIRATE / 24 hours. Ugh!!

[19-Oct-18 09:38 PM] WeyezOD#1176
Mining is SO frustrating

[19-Oct-18 09:41 PM] WeyezOD#1176
5 minutes later ... 155 PIRATE / 24 hours

[19-Oct-18 09:42 PM] manfromafar (poolofd32th.club)#2786
good

[19-Oct-18 09:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mining calcs are *at best* a "rough guess"

[19-Oct-18 09:43 PM] WeyezOD#1176
Of course. But can't be ignored

[19-Oct-18 09:46 PM] WeyezOD#1176
I have a spreadsheet that is based on payouts over time and expected returns per 24 hour period and it's showing the actual affect.

[19-Oct-18 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
On my main pool, I have an algorithm that uses current block diff every 5 minutes to print out daily estimate as well as market income based on a weighted moving average

[19-Oct-18 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
close to ATH diff, in 2 hours the Msols will reflect this too

[19-Oct-18 09:48 PM] WeyezOD#1176
Better than my spreadsheet!!

[19-Oct-18 09:49 PM] jl777c#5810
https://dexstats.info/piratehash.php

[19-Oct-18 09:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the diff and Msols -> expected coins per Msol

[19-Oct-18 09:49 PM] jl777c#5810
your Msols/net Msols * 370,000 = approx coins per day

[19-Oct-18 09:50 PM] jl777c#5810
adjust the Msols up if diff is higher, down if diff is lower. Msols is just a 2 hour average

[19-Oct-18 09:51 PM] WeyezOD#1176
I've learned though that it's just the nature of the beast. People trend toward where the rewards are best (basic human nature), diff increases and the rewards plummet.  What are gonna do????

[19-Oct-18 09:52 PM] penguin#0544
The law of averages works best always 😄

[19-Oct-18 09:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`blocksPerHashRatePerDay = (24 / ((coinStatus.difficulty * Math.pow(2,32)) / ((Math.pow(10,9) * CurrentkH) * 3600)) )/2;`
for less than Msols 😛

[19-Oct-18 09:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
using block diff and not net diff

[19-Oct-18 09:53 PM] 0x03#8822
this clearly ignores fud and fomo factors

[19-Oct-18 09:53 PM] 0x03#8822
as well as a number of others :trollface:

[19-Oct-18 09:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

i just hit 10- and now its 25 like comon

[19-Oct-18 10:11 PM] furshure123#1929
so i should stop mining on your pool now?

[19-Oct-18 10:12 PM] furshure123#1929
this is kinda crappy for people trying to get a small amount

[19-Oct-18 10:12 PM] furshure123#1929
i literally just hit 10 and now its 25 so by thte time i hit that i will be SOL cuz it will be raised again?

[19-Oct-18 10:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@furshure123 What is it you think you can do with 10 ARRR anyway?

[19-Oct-18 10:18 PM] furshure123#1929
not much i get that but i would like to get my coins i mined...

[19-Oct-18 10:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you'll get them

[19-Oct-18 10:19 PM] furshure123#1929
how? the payout is 25 now?

[19-Oct-18 10:19 PM] furshure123#1929
by the time i reach 25 it will most likley be raised again?

[19-Oct-18 10:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
keep mining

[19-Oct-18 10:19 PM] furshure123#1929

just ignore genie. He's mean to everyone @furshure123

[19-Oct-18 10:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
he already told you that he raised the threshold because of the amount of miners that can be paid at one time, if that's not good enough go to a pool that has less miners and thus not that issue
