Yes.   We made them a bot.   We owe them a lot for giving us this opportunity and being kind enough to let us stay while we work out our kinks.

hi all , im trying to get my z9 mini running on stratum.pirate.komodopool.xyz , but says dead, any thoughts?

[10-Oct-18 10:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
He just fired it back up he said

[10-Oct-18 10:06 PM] tigersfang#3444
is the address like stratum.pirate.komodopool.xyz:8888, or stratum+tcp://.pirate.komodopool.xyz:8888

The mining rig contest went off with about 670 ARRR being distributed between the two winners and the onboarding fund.  
There will be another rig time raffle contest soon as well as a Z9 mini raffle!

[10-Oct-18 10:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I will be sending out the ARRR to those who submitted files to the art competition.  Please DM me if you made a contribution and did not place in the prize purse.   There are about 7 or 8 of you I believe.

[10-Oct-18 11:15 PM] AndrewK#3947
What was the mining rig contest?

[10-Oct-18 11:17 PM] AndrewK#3947
someone should post on reddit Monero and Zcash forums asking for a compare and contrast between Monero and Zcash and see if we can excite some of their users

[10-Oct-18 11:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We do.   It;s sort of a no contest, monero wins vs zec because their shielded pool is not large enough.

[10-Oct-18 11:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The Zcash protocol is stronger in our opinion but only when utilized to the max.

how do i get started?

[10-Oct-18 11:59 PM] Zach#9973
@Luke install the agama wallet 0.2.42c from the pinned messages at the top and start up Pirate in native mode. Takes 30 minutes or so to sync and then you can make a z address

[10-Oct-18 11:59 PM] Zach#9973
Version 0.2.42c is the only one that supports Pirate

[11-Oct-18 12:00 AM] Llama#1330

[11-Oct-18 12:07 AM] Luke#3867
@Zach Cheers mate, working through it all now

[11-Oct-18 12:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@AndrewK I gave away 24 hours of mining time with 60K sols on Pirate to 3 winners.

[11-Oct-18 12:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I will do another here soon.

[11-Oct-18 12:25 AM] wookie#7663

I have had a boring job for 20 years, which I have been fortunate to have, dont get me wrong, I make great money and have lots of time for my kids... but Blockchain and specifically Komodo has captured my imagination and heart!

[11-Oct-18 12:27 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I didn't plan to do this full time, but I think I am going to start next month.   Just need to find a lackey to come in and do my slave wage job.

[11-Oct-18 12:48 AM] AndrewK#3947
Fishy I think we should increase the dev fund so that we can pay people

[11-Oct-18 12:48 AM] AndrewK#3947
I tihnk most people would be onboard with this

[11-Oct-18 12:48 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We have a dev fund?

[11-Oct-18 12:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Sweet!!!

[11-Oct-18 12:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
J/K - I don't think we have a specific pirate dev fund.

[11-Oct-18 12:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There might could be one someday....

Actually running the node is fucking hard ATM... But we have some great ppls working on fixing that

Def need $$ to support devs and a full time team. The coin is worth >$1M at current prices. The funds are there.

[11-Oct-18 01:29 AM] Llama#1330
@AndrewK there is no premine for the team

[11-Oct-18 01:30 AM] Llama#1330
and it's basically a finished product

[11-Oct-18 01:30 AM] AndrewK#3947
I know. I meant if we were to have % of every block go to a foundation or team, the ecnomics make it viable

[11-Oct-18 01:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@AndrewK Block taxes are a great way to drive off miners

[11-Oct-18 01:47 AM] AndrewK#3947
so does decaying prices from lack of awareness

We only started “marketing” two weeks ago and the first week was spent setting up infrastructure and getting to know who was going to step up and be part of the team.  👍

[11-Oct-18 01:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We need more use cases and trading avenues.   There will only be so much speculative accumulation.

[11-Oct-18 01:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I have a dev tasked with a bit for woocommerce.

[11-Oct-18 01:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
After that drops I’m gonna build a marketing list for shops that accept crypto and hammer away for onboarding.

[11-Oct-18 01:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The challenge with that is no exchanges for a price reference for the shop bot.

[11-Oct-18 01:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Lots of things coming together over time.  Some will be slow.  Some are dependent on others.  Some will be fast.

I hope binance likes my three page manifesto.

[11-Oct-18 01:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I also filled out their google form for a listing.

[11-Oct-18 01:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@AndrewK 
Any "decaying price" effect is short-term felt by very few of us, but I do agree that there will be lasting effects if sales don't pick up
The downturn of pricing is more an issue of shortsightedness as it relates to OTC. If it were possible to get people to see the larger picture and hold for an equilibrium price (ore even just under it) and get a few more buyers per day or 2, I have no doubt in growth ability.

[11-Oct-18 01:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`OMG no one bought my today mined coins today, so I need to slash price` turning to `OK, I can hold for a few days and get what they are worth` will do wonders greater than what we saw last week

[11-Oct-18 02:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ch6ris
You can tell me to go fuck myself all day long it still doesn't change the fact that you don't know your ass from a hole in the ground, or the fact that an assetchain is not a "replica" of KMD, or the fact that PIRATE is more private than KMD.

[11-Oct-18 02:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_goes back to 📺_

[11-Oct-18 02:13 AM] ch6ris#5240
Yes you are a very wise man, twist my words all all you want. Not once did I say replica of komodo. It is a replica of an assetchain like all assetchains before it. There is one change that makes it more private.

[11-Oct-18 02:15 AM] ch6ris#5240
enjoy you TV, I have seen this so many times, buy now $5 per coin is such a bargain, it has been done again and again and only people in a postilion that you happen to be in come out on top.

[11-Oct-18 02:20 AM] ch6ris#5240
I told you to gfy because your putting words in my mouth. You can tell me to 😭 all you like, doesn't change the fact that your apart of the manipulation that causes such huge looses for the sheep.

[11-Oct-18 02:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Not once did I say replica of komodo.`
You, literally, feken said:
`It is hard enough getting anyone to even notice komodo nonetheless pirate. Basically a replica with minor changes and a cool name.`

[11-Oct-18 02:21 AM] ch6ris#5240
full stop. new sentence buddy.

[11-Oct-18 02:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
'Basically a replica with minor changes and a cool name.' isn't a sentence, but that's another topic

[11-Oct-18 02:22 AM] ch6ris#5240
Perhaps I should of put the word assestchain after replica.

[11-Oct-18 02:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
To that extent, all assetchains are "replicas", and as such none would have any value at all. That notion begs the question, "then why are you here?"

{Reactions}
😋 

[11-Oct-18 02:26 AM] ch6ris#5240
You should define sentence. I'm here to make money (fiat). I was merely giving my 2 cents on a comment made that implied the value can only go up over time.

[11-Oct-18 02:27 AM] ch6ris#5240
I also enjoy the social aspect.

[11-Oct-18 02:28 AM] ch6ris#5240
Your puting words in my mouth again by saying "none would have any value at all"

[11-Oct-18 02:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Sentences
A sentence is a group of words that makes complete sense, contains a main verb, and begins with a capital letter.`
Because, English.

[11-Oct-18 02:28 AM] ch6ris#5240
I googled it for you  "a set of words that is complete in itself, typically containing a subject and predicate, conveying a statement, question, exclamation, or command, and consisting of a main clause and sometimes one or more subordinate clauses."

[11-Oct-18 02:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I need not define 'sentence' the language structure defines it.

[11-Oct-18 02:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that is complete in itself` 
'Basically a replica with minor changes and a cool name.' is not that.

[11-Oct-18 02:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It lacks the basic subject.

[11-Oct-18 02:31 AM] ch6ris#5240
"It is hard enough getting anyone to even notice komodo nonetheless pirate." was the sentence.

[11-Oct-18 02:31 AM] Redbeard#8343
@ch6ris ,  there is no fiat here, why you here for that?
