I'll have to look through the docs.

[22-Sep-18 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
or maybe even 10x to get to approx annual halvings

[22-Sep-18 11:25 AM] CrisF#3405
I've found some info but don't have much of an idea what to do with it :/

[22-Sep-18 11:26 AM] CrisF#3405
```Block halving every 77777 blocks.

    aprox every 54.01180556 days

Block reward of 1 satoshi will be reached in about 5.179214231 years.
Total supply of around 40 million. Exactly to be 39,821,823.99884100 by year 2023```

[22-Sep-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
if halving are 10x slower,  it goes for 10x longer and has 10x the coins

[22-Sep-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
if 5x, then 5x slower, 5x longer and 5x the coins

[22-Sep-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems straightforward enough

[22-Sep-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
problem is that in a few years the blockreward becomes small

[22-Sep-18 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so at 5x, total supply gets to about 200 mil

[22-Sep-18 11:29 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, is that best adjusted through `-ac_halving`, `-ac_decay` and/or total emission.

[22-Sep-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
simplest is the change the halving to 5x internally

[22-Sep-18 11:35 AM] CrisF#3405
Something like every 15555 blocks?

[22-Sep-18 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
5 * 77777 is not anything close to 15555

[22-Sep-18 11:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Oops!

Thanks for your work jl777

[22-Sep-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
latest version 5x the decay so we end up at 200 mil coin supply and closer to 10 years before there is a problem with too few coins emitted

[22-Sep-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
all this assumes the hardfork can be deployed before 77777

[22-Sep-18 12:05 PM] wookie#7663
Is there any way to slow down emission schedule but keep the total coin supply? For me the biggest attraction is the privacy features followed by coin supply

[22-Sep-18 12:05 PM] SHossain#0007
then, we have about a month before block 77777

[22-Sep-18 12:06 PM] Don King#8901
Yes, thanks for your work jl777, those numbers look good to me! I s√†y we pull the trigger on the hard fork to add notary t transactions to allow dPoW, and change the coin emission as jl777 suggests! Those 2 changes will make PIRATE the perfect 'offshore' coin! Who needs the Panama papers now?

[22-Sep-18 12:07 PM] Don King#8901
Then all we need is an exchange, wonder digitalprice.io would list PIRATE doing z only tx

[22-Sep-18 12:08 PM] CrisF#3405
@wookie , that's why I was asking about the other parameters.

[22-Sep-18 12:09 PM] Don King#8901
I prefer to increase coin supply myself, otherwise the early miner bonus can cause problems

[22-Sep-18 12:10 PM] Don King#8901
Put yourself in the shoes of the guys we want to join PIRATE community

[22-Sep-18 12:11 PM] SHossain#0007
i wouldn't go with digitalprice.io. they charge for updating a coin daemon.

[22-Sep-18 12:12 PM] CrisF#3405
It doesn't matter to me.  I was just curious .

[22-Sep-18 12:12 PM] SHossain#0007
we can talk to cryptopia once we are ready. we can offer them something that they can't refuse üòÑ

[22-Sep-18 12:12 PM] Don King#8901
200M coins just means the party gets bigger, and doesn't give too big an advantage to early adopters

[22-Sep-18 12:13 PM] SHossain#0007
any exchange will enable PIRATE trading, will be the market leader

[22-Sep-18 12:13 PM] CrisF#3405
The -params related to this wouldn't effect the test notarization chain would they?

[22-Sep-18 12:13 PM] Don King#8901
I would love to see a komodo team start an exchange

[22-Sep-18 12:13 PM] Don King#8901
Maybe an existing notary

[22-Sep-18 12:14 PM] SHossain#0007
@Don King that's too much work to operate a CEX. we have DEX üòÉ

[22-Sep-18 12:15 PM] Don King#8901
Ha ha, bartercex

[22-Sep-18 12:15 PM] SHossain#0007
yep

[22-Sep-18 12:16 PM] Don King#8901
Could be just a bare bones pirate:kmd exchange, nothing else, just a few tx here and there

[22-Sep-18 12:17 PM] SHossain#0007
i can setup notary nodes and test coin to test notarization next week or the following

[22-Sep-18 12:18 PM] Don King#8901
@SHossain, sounds great!

[22-Sep-18 12:18 PM] wookie#7663
@jl777c you mentioned all this assumes we are able to hardfork before block 77777. What happens if it does not?

[22-Sep-18 12:18 PM] CrisF#3405
Rewards half?

[22-Sep-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
lets just get it done before 77777

[22-Sep-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
still we need to verify notarization works

[22-Sep-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
other than that, nothing else to verify and then people can update

[22-Sep-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
with 1 year emission, it wont be any issue for late comers

[22-Sep-18 12:19 PM] CrisF#3405
The -params related to this wouldn't effect the test notarization chain would they?

[22-Sep-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand the question

[22-Sep-18 12:20 PM] scubapanda#2485
A Shapeshift type service would be a good start for PIRATE:KMD pair.

[22-Sep-18 12:20 PM] SHossain#0007
@CrisF it shouldn't. as jl777 mentioned, he already updated the source.

[22-Sep-18 12:22 PM] CrisF#3405
To make a test chain for notarization tests, the exact `-ac_halving`, `-ac_decay` etc wouldn't effect notarizations would they?  They could be changed again before hard forking PIRATE right?

[22-Sep-18 12:23 PM] CrisF#3405
@SHossain Thanks üëç

[22-Sep-18 12:23 PM] Don King#8901
@scubapanda, yes, a simple shapeshift type setup to send kmd back and forth to your offshore PIRATE treasure chest!

[22-Sep-18 12:24 PM] SHossain#0007
@CrisF we will have to create new chain to test notarization. changing parameters shouldn't affect anything as long as notary nodes use the same udpated param.

[22-Sep-18 12:25 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks @SHossain !  @Alright üëÜ

[22-Sep-18 12:26 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll be needing couple of volunteers to mine the new test chain that we will create for notarization. CPU mining will be enough.

[22-Sep-18 12:27 PM] wookie#7663
@SHossain I can volunteer my cpu.

STAKED might be interested?

[22-Sep-18 12:28 PM] wookie#7663
Can someone explain in lay man terms what the "shape shift type setup" means and does?

[22-Sep-18 12:29 PM] SHossain#0007
if stakers can join, that would be nice. all they have to do is run the chain and mine. i can manage the notary nodes.

[22-Sep-18 12:39 PM] scubapanda#2485
@wookie It would be a service where you would send one coin in and get the other in return. For that to work, both coins need to have a market. Or you might end up having most PIRATE but no KMD üòâ

[22-Sep-18 12:54 PM] xoso#1057
I'm compiling params for a test chain. please wait...

[22-Sep-18 01:01 PM] xoso#1057
I propose these params:
`./komodod -ac_name=CHEEZ -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=500000000 -ac_halving=2100000 -ac_private=1 -addnode=`

[22-Sep-18 01:01 PM] SHossain#0007
@xoso we have one chain already. thanks. will post that soon üòÉ

[22-Sep-18 01:01 PM] xoso#1057
total supply: 20,999,999.98044220

[22-Sep-18 01:01 PM] xoso#1057
halving every 1458.333333 days

[22-Sep-18 05:36 PM] SHossain#0007
@wookie @xoso we will be using this chain for private chain notarization test `./komodod -ac_name=PRIVATEER -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=388885 -ac_private=1 -addnode=195.201.115.40 -addnode=159.69.195.70 &`
it is CPU minable

[22-Sep-18 05:37 PM] SHossain#0007
You need `komodod` from jl777 branch

[22-Sep-18 05:38 PM] SHossain#0007
@CHMEX can we please have an explorer setup for this ^^ chain?

[22-Sep-18 07:18 PM] wookie#7663
windows

[22-Sep-18 07:20 PM] SHossain#0007
there no binary for winodws from jl777 branch

[22-Sep-18 07:21 PM] wookie#7663
sorry, that's the only cpu I have that's constantly connected

[22-Sep-18 07:22 PM] SHossain#0007
no worries. thanks for your offer üòÉ

[22-Sep-18 07:23 PM] wookie#7663
np. I'm happy to help in any way!

[22-Sep-18 07:41 PM] wookie#7663
sorry for the noob question: will the coins that are already mined still be valid after the hardfork?

[22-Sep-18 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[22-Sep-18 07:45 PM] wookie#7663

./komodod -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225 &

[23-Sep-18 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont think notaries being able to do transparent tx is any special powers, cant think of how they can use it to deanonymize any others, even by a little

{Reactions}
‚òù 

[23-Sep-18 07:48 AM] CHMEX#0686
If I understand it correctly the notaries only need t transactions to notarize to the notarization address, if so would it be an idea just to allow transactions to the crypto address. Or is that inpractical?
I agree if the notaries can make t transactions it does not risk the anonymity of others.

[23-Sep-18 08:02 AM] CHMEX#0686
that would also mean the chain does not need to be forked when new notaries are elected.
As I see it PIRATES will not get (can't get) new features so it's a finished product.

[23-Sep-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
splitting into utxo, being able to receive funds, these are also needed for practical notarization

[23-Sep-18 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess one aspect is that a notary could run an exchange and accept t-deposits, but would still need to support z-withdraws

[23-Sep-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt seem like any giant advantage for a notary and I would imagine that anybody that would be running an exchange for PIRATE would be able to get their pubkey added to the exemption list

[23-Sep-18 08:33 AM] CHMEX#0686
True I did not think that far that they need to split and actually have funds to notarize üò≥

[23-Sep-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be possible to require all notaries to mine and create custom coinbase to do the splitting, but this does not seem very practical as it might soon require a z9 to ming the PIRATE treasures
