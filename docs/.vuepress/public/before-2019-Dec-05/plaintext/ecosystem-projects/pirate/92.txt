[29-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Llama#1330
well I mean he can't just do YouTube full time w/o getting paid.

[29-Sep-18 08:33 PM] 0x03#8822
theres people playing minecraft on YT for a living

[29-Sep-18 08:33 PM] 0x03#8822
so i'd say he probably can üòâ

[29-Sep-18 08:33 PM] Kalash#2884
afaik he doesn't do paid episodes unless that's new

[29-Sep-18 08:33 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
he could, and ppl can donate if they found his content interesting/entertaining/helpful, etc....

[29-Sep-18 08:33 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
sadly it rarely is

[29-Sep-18 08:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have a budget to support content creators.

[29-Sep-18 08:34 PM] Llama#1330
Minecraft youtubers get paid by minecraft servers for almost every video lol

If they are high quality content creators with lots of subscribers and influence, we can consider this.

[29-Sep-18 08:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Its not MASSIVE but I will make it work effectively!  üòÉ

[29-Sep-18 08:36 PM] Llama#1330

Don't talk about it too much, difficulty is already high enough.

[29-Sep-18 08:36 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I prefer "free" content,  then they are allowed more creative direction.   We can spiff our bounty for really good stuff, new datapoints, or large audiences.

[29-Sep-18 08:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As @Regnar said, If we start assigning dollar values to jobs and requirements to them, the quality of work could suffer.   The people may feel undervalued or overworked.   If we do it out of love and support for the community, then the rewards are just a bonus.

I have a new public bounty on Trello.  There are multiple opportunities here.
We are looking for infographics on why ARRR is more private and secure than other Privacy coins.  
Feel free to add more coins to the ones listed.

Bounties payable in KMD or PIRATE

@FishyGuts  appreciate your work

@FishyGuts anyone seen this? not exhaustive but a very comprehensive listing of privacy coins and their features. might be useful for creating the comparisons infographics https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-weHt0PiIZWyXs1Uzp7QIUKk9TX7aa15RtFc8JJpn7g/edit#gid=237137882

I probably should've put it over in marketing

[29-Sep-18 11:35 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Add it to the Trello board as a card.

[29-Sep-18 11:35 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Move it to the top of the list.

[29-Sep-18 11:35 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I‚Äôm not at my desk but that will be a good resource.   Then instead of all the cards we can just make a bulletpoint list.

[29-Sep-18 11:52 PM] wookie#7663
you got it!üëçüèª

[29-Sep-18 11:58 PM] wookie#7663
I assume you mean to post it to the Social Media Board as a card with your bounties for the comparisons to other privacy coins. I need an invite to the social media board, I can't post to it. Unless someone else wants to do it.

[30-Sep-18 12:08 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Done and I added u, the link is no clickable but can copy and paste, not sure if that can be changed
