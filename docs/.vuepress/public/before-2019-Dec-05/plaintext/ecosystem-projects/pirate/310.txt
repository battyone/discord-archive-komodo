Being a fair launch, no ICO, no Dev fund project, we are grateful any time people want to help out.
Our Mining pool ops have decided to donate a large portion of their mining fees to the Pirate fund.

https://t.co/qs3fzZ6oHl is the newest donor and we moved some rigs there...

@Noxemo  ledger integration could be a possibility, but  I don't think we will be able to get on there anytime soon.  Ledger supports zcash  and komodo.  Maybe when we make a name for Pirate we can put in a request.

wow whats up with the rapage of the network hash rate.... My mining has been nearly cut in half today.

[14-Nov-18 03:59 AM] CiPhEr#2091
really would be nice to spread the hashrate amongst the different pools. Is there technology that can prevent new users from mining to the stratum after a certain amount of hash is reached? Forcing new miners to other pools?

[14-Nov-18 04:00 AM] plazma#1625
Just ran full node of verus coin oh the sweet sapling z address

[14-Nov-18 04:04 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@CiPhEr no there is not. The decision to choose a pool is completely personal. People need to inform themselves of which one would best suit their needs. Pirate has multiple pools, all with slightly different features and websites. I implore people to do a bit of research and look into all the pools and what they offer before making a decision. It seems as though the single pool with most of the hash gained a lot of popularity through early marketing when it was the only pool, and people are not interested in switching (for various reasons).

[14-Nov-18 04:05 AM] CiPhEr#2091
hmmm so there is zero tech out there that can refuse connection to additional users to a port after x or y has been met? i'm not an it guy but that seems odd

I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to make, but for a pool operator, it would make no sense. Why would they want to kick people from their pool?

[14-Nov-18 04:06 AM] CiPhEr#2091
true, little motivation for the pool operator to implement

[14-Nov-18 04:06 AM] plazma#1625

@FishyGuts get in touch with @PTYX re: paper wallet

[14-Nov-18 04:07 AM] CiPhEr#2091
perhaps there could be some creative thinking put forward to see what potential rewards would / could / should be possible for pool operators and or mining community from such implementations. That contest is a cool step forward i've seen

[14-Nov-18 04:10 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I don't think there would be much motivation to do so.  I think marketing other pools, informing people and giving people options will aid in the transfer of hash. Competitions like the one linked below, are a great way to generate incentive to change pools!
