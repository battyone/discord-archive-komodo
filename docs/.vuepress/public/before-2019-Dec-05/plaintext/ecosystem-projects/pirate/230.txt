On that note. If you're sick of seeing the standard NOMP layout and long payout times of the couple of main pools. Consider switching.
http://minethepiratechain.black is the hottest new pool to hit the ecosystem.

If I mined in public pools, I'd pick that just because it's clean looking and I'm sick of the same 3 pages for dam'd near a decade

I can't even see how that's possible, unless the averaging extrapolation is off

[27-Oct-18 01:24 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
168Msol is ATH?

[27-Oct-18 01:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Because, wiki

[27-Oct-18 01:30 AM] Flexatron#8809
Its rate of Msol increase which also determines diff no

[27-Oct-18 01:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
diff is determined by find rate vs previous diff 
sols are actually a localized term and then extrapolated backwards by the daemon as an estimate

[27-Oct-18 01:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
creation of diff is a rabbit hole that most of us don't want to go down 😛

[27-Oct-18 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Diff is stupid, I found that by turning the diff calculation function I to a stub that always returns 1 you can get stupidly fast block chain 🤣

[27-Oct-18 01:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you can get stupidly fast block chain`
that no one else will accept 😛

[27-Oct-18 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well true... It can only have a single miner

[27-Oct-18 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If there are more than 1 it constantly forks

the are mostly work you were doing that no longer matters

[27-Oct-18 01:38 AM] memo#0706
well when you have 22,000 discarded shares and only 1000 accepted doesnt that raise an alarmÉ

[27-Oct-18 01:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
high rejected is an issue; high discarded is "normal"

[27-Oct-18 01:38 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
That could mean you're on a poor difficulty

[27-Oct-18 01:38 AM] memo#0706
how to set difficulty? im using port 18888

[27-Oct-18 01:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you don't set it, the pool does

[27-Oct-18 01:39 AM] memo#0706
will try another pool to see results then

[27-Oct-18 01:39 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It could mean that, but if you're using the correct one, it may be another problem

[27-Oct-18 01:40 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Vague enough 😛

[27-Oct-18 01:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and number of accepted shares is only a number of value when weighed against the diff of each of those shares

[27-Oct-18 01:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1 share of diff 100 is the same value as 100 shares at diff 1
