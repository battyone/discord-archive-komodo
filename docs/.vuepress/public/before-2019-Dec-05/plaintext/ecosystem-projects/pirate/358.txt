[02-Dec-18 07:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you gave away your currency on a promise

[02-Dec-18 07:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's how banks work

[02-Dec-18 07:06 PM] DmanXX#2257
That’s why I want them out of exchange

[02-Dec-18 07:07 PM] DmanXX#2257
But this looks more and more like a crap scam

[02-Dec-18 07:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`That’s why I want them out of exchange`
And just like any other bank, you'll get them when they give them to you based on their schedule and determinations

[02-Dec-18 07:07 PM] Flexatron#8809
@DmanXX watch your language sir

:realpirate:

[02-Dec-18 07:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`But this looks more and more like a crap scam`
because you never read the User Agreement for a single exchange on the planet

[02-Dec-18 07:09 PM] DmanXX#2257
Aha so DP is like any other centralized bank? Is that what you trying to say?

[02-Dec-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
you dont have to convert the coins deposited at DP

[02-Dec-18 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Aha so DP is like any other centralized bank? Is that what you trying to say?`
**all exchanges** are

[02-Dec-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
they are controlled by DP and DP will do the zmigrate

[02-Dec-18 07:10 PM] DmanXX#2257
Yes but I’m investing in Komodo project just because man him self jl777 is all about decentralization

[02-Dec-18 07:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
one has nothing to do with the other

[02-Dec-18 07:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
jl does not own dp

[02-Dec-18 07:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
komodo does not own dp

[02-Dec-18 07:11 PM] DmanXX#2257
So excuse me but I thought dp is different

[02-Dec-18 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
what exactly is your problem?

[02-Dec-18 07:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
withdraws are froze and he's panicky

[02-Dec-18 07:12 PM] DmanXX#2257
There is no problem all I did is asked few questions

[02-Dec-18 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
we need sapling to get the exchange back online

[02-Dec-18 07:13 PM] DmanXX#2257
I’m not panicking just asking questions

[02-Dec-18 07:13 PM] DmanXX#2257
Is this channel for this specific reason?

[02-Dec-18 07:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
saying `But this looks more and more like a crap scam` because you don't understand what you agreed to isn't `just asking questions`

[02-Dec-18 07:14 PM] DmanXX#2257
Yes  it does,

[02-Dec-18 07:14 PM] DmanXX#2257
I wrote to dp no one wrote back

[02-Dec-18 07:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I was asking questions, I did have any info

[02-Dec-18 07:18 PM] blubbi#0643
DP is a exchange like Binance if they have wallet maintance they HAVE wallet maintance

[02-Dec-18 07:19 PM] blubbi#0643
the reason is the fork

[02-Dec-18 07:19 PM] DmanXX#2257
I gave my opinion, what is this Channel own by government? I can’t ask?

[02-Dec-18 07:19 PM] blubbi#0643
ur funds are safe

[02-Dec-18 07:19 PM] KOSIUS#0001
@DmanXX calling projects/exchanges a scam or other names is the problem

[02-Dec-18 07:20 PM] DmanXX#2257
Ok I understand that , so I have to be a sheep can’t ask anything

[02-Dec-18 07:20 PM] KOSIUS#0001
no, you ask nicely

[02-Dec-18 07:20 PM] KOSIUS#0001
all of your questions were answered weren't they?

[02-Dec-18 07:20 PM] DmanXX#2257
Ok put your self in my position

[02-Dec-18 07:21 PM] Alright#0419
What can you do about it?

[02-Dec-18 07:21 PM] DmanXX#2257
I invested, try to move coins, I can’t

[02-Dec-18 07:21 PM] Alright#0419
you gave them your money already

[02-Dec-18 07:21 PM] DmanXX#2257
Send messages no answer

[02-Dec-18 07:21 PM] KOSIUS#0001
and we told you a wallet maintenance is going on @DmanXX

[02-Dec-18 07:23 PM] DmanXX#2257
Listen I have been investing in Komodo project  for over a year, if I have questions I can ask am I correct or not?

[02-Dec-18 07:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Ok put your self in my position
I invested, try to move coins, I can’t`
Since I understand how banks and exchanges work I would not be upset the a given exchange didn't null out my ledger balance on my schedule and would understand that I get what they give me when they give it to me

[02-Dec-18 07:24 PM] Alright#0419
@DmanXX if you're worried or need money immediately, KMD withdraws are still open

[02-Dec-18 07:24 PM] KOSIUS#0001
@DmanXX of course you can

[02-Dec-18 07:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if I have questions I can ask am I correct or not?`
You can ask any question you like; however, no one is required to give you the wrong answer just because you don't want to hear the right one

[02-Dec-18 07:25 PM] DmanXX#2257

[02-Dec-18 07:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you have understand one thing there are investors that have no idea how this thing works`
Do you often just randomly throw your funds around and have no clue how, when, or why you do/don't get a positive ROI?

[02-Dec-18 07:27 PM] Alright#0419
patience or sell for KMD and withdraw

[02-Dec-18 07:27 PM] Alright#0419
that's all we can say

[02-Dec-18 07:28 PM] Alright#0419
not worth talking about otherwise

[02-Dec-18 07:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[02-Dec-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
plz wait until after dec 15th

[02-Dec-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
dont panic

[02-Dec-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
be calm

[02-Dec-18 07:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
investing in PIRATE and trading on a privatively owned centralized exchange are not mutually inclusive

[02-Dec-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
or panic sell and withdraw KMD/BTC

[02-Dec-18 07:31 PM] DmanXX#2257
I’m not panicking, all I had few questions

[02-Dec-18 07:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_goes for 🍽 🛀🏽 and 💤_

[02-Dec-18 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
@DmanXX next time you have questions, maybe just ask them, instead of accusing scam

[02-Dec-18 07:33 PM] DmanXX#2257
Maybe I should, but there was a guy before me saying that

[02-Dec-18 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
DmanXXToday at 08:06
That’s why I want them out of exchange
But this looks more and more like a crap scam

[02-Dec-18 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
that seems to be you

[02-Dec-18 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway. dont make false accusations. ask the questions without inflammatory statements and people will answer calmly

[02-Dec-18 07:35 PM] DmanXX#2257
And it’s panic but like I said I’m trying to find out more from this channel when dp not getting back to me

[02-Dec-18 07:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
Here we go with the drama again

[02-Dec-18 07:35 PM] KOSIUS#0001
and @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 told you its weekend, hence slow response time from DP support

[02-Dec-18 07:35 PM] DmanXX#2257
It’s says that it looks like

[02-Dec-18 07:36 PM] DmanXX#2257
Never said it is

[02-Dec-18 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it looked like you were accusing pirate of being a scam

[02-Dec-18 07:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
Withdrawal suspension for ARRR has been announced. Withdrawals will be resumed after dec 15th after sapling is integrated

[02-Dec-18 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
no withdraw until after sapling activates, and likely a day or two afterward to complete the zmigrate for DP

[02-Dec-18 07:37 PM] DmanXX#2257
Wait  wait I never said pirate

[02-Dec-18 07:37 PM] mrlynch#5735
Potaeto, potato... shouting scam doesn't help... trying to go back on yourself now doesn't help your case either

[02-Dec-18 07:37 PM] DmanXX#2257
I meant dp

[02-Dec-18 07:38 PM] mrlynch#5735
Well, they're not. They always made good whenever there were issues. Most caused by ppl mining to their exchange address which should never be done

[02-Dec-18 07:38 PM] mrlynch#5735
It's weekend. Even if internet is on 24/7, doesn't mean ppl are

[02-Dec-18 07:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
And, next time maybe just ask... hey is something wrong with dp? I can't withdraw.

[02-Dec-18 07:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
Any helpful soul in here would've told you what has already been said

[02-Dec-18 07:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
Just chill... funds are safu

[02-Dec-18 07:40 PM] DmanXX#2257
It thought that pirate is a scam automatically It would make kmd also a scam , so no I never said that

[02-Dec-18 07:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but like I said I’m trying to find out more from this channel when dp not getting back to me`
The fact that you keep repeating this idea show that you **still** do not grasp the concept that
**Digitalprice is a privatively owned, centralized exchange that has nothing to do with PIRATE or Komodo**
