TreasureChest wallet seems to be working well for looking at wallet transactions, I need to squash a few bugs with sending + receiving

[16-Oct-18 12:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
and there are some bugs where my ARRR TreasureChest wallet knows about my Hush Hushlist contacts, no bueno. What happens at sea, stays at sea.

Is it possible to do mergetozadress from a wallet?

[16-Oct-18 01:14 PM] Flexatron#8809
it's not the same as just sending your stack to a new address right?

[16-Oct-18 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"a wallet"?

[16-Oct-18 01:14 PM] Flexatron#8809
like agama

[16-Oct-18 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in "settings" agama has a cli pass-through that lets you do the same as if running from command prompt (just leave off the `komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE` part)

[16-Oct-18 01:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Flexatron you can do z_mergetoaddress via full mode agama

[16-Oct-18 01:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
z_mergetoaddress is just syntax sugar on top of z_sendmany, it sends transactions and costs tx fees (but you can easily set them to 0 via the CLI) :pirate:

[16-Oct-18 01:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Flexatron you can import a private key of a zaddr to multiple nodes as well, it's like burying the same treasure chest in multiple places. But also, somebody can dig it up and find it in multiple places....

[16-Oct-18 01:30 PM] Flexatron#8809
Thanks

[16-Oct-18 02:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
cold storage of a zaddr private key is easier as well, because all change from a zaddr flows back to itself. With taddrs, your change constantly goes to a new address

one of the early miners

[16-Oct-18 03:22 PM] CHMEX#0686
In a few years crypto might be one of the biggest transparent holders

[16-Oct-18 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
so many 256 PIRATE on the richlist. i guess from some forgotten solo mining, or even CPU mining from earliest prehistorical times

[16-Oct-18 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yes it is all Aug 30th!

[16-Oct-18 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
whoever has all those CPU mined PIRATE on the richlist, plz shield!!

Aug 30th was like few hours of mining... the first day

[16-Oct-18 03:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
could have some who just tried this as a test and just forgot about it.

[16-Oct-18 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or dumped the keys as part of that

[16-Oct-18 03:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I sure hope that many still don't loose their coins like BTC early adopters lost

[16-Oct-18 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd have lost 1280 from early days if I weren't the type to keep every config except a once of year "sweep" that I do

@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 Thanks for linking the post and encouraging use.  TBH - it's one of our first posts that has cleared the r/CryptoCurrency auto mods and 2000 eyes is a good start.  
Please continue to help by linking threads and posting comments and encouraging others to see these.   
With our collective eyes across the platforms, we can cover so much more ocean.

[16-Oct-18 03:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As to the site... I do like it to.

[16-Oct-18 03:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I think it is good to keep in mind that 90% of our "customers" are not as savvy as you all are.  
It's some what cumbersome to navigate the existing site for people who are newer to the sphere.  I handle daily DMs from people looking for info.
Ease of onboarding is critical for adopting new users.  
Think of trying to board a ship tied to a dock.... vs. catching a swim ladder while the boat is sailing by at 5 knots.
Monero pushed a gui update for all users, which had multiple issues and neccesary workarounds for all of their users to be able to launch.   
We want to be able to capture new Pirate users with our ease of use by having our gangplank down while docked vs. having to take a 4 hour CLI class to send your money and catch that swim ladder as the boat goes sailing by.

Arrr there any big miners here wishing to make some contribution for marketing incetivising (this will surely attractive for miners to attract more peopl to Arrr). Thinking if few bigger miners could contribute <=1% of weekly mining for a weekly lottery among pirates supporting marketing actions. Lottery could be better then raining - seems better to dream to win 1000 then got a drop of  1 ... What you think ? :coolpirate:

[16-Oct-18 03:59 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
The reason is to motivate people to quickly click upvotes or likes. Today we got like 13 and > 3k people saw Arrr article on reddit. <b>Imagine what we could get if we had like 100 upvotes or 1k upvotes on a 600k subredit !!! </b>

it's same question as "can you decrease price by 1%"

[16-Oct-18 04:01 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
while it fluctuates by more then 10%

[16-Oct-18 04:01 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
note I call for <=1% - tbd

[16-Oct-18 04:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it's same question as "can you decrease price by 1%"`
To that end, the most blunt answer is: That's why it's so dam'd low now 😕

[16-Oct-18 04:01 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and for sure a few miners should agree for that to make any sense

[16-Oct-18 04:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
atm price is linked to nothing other than small miners needing to "reup" quiclky

[16-Oct-18 04:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"needing" may be too strong and "wanting" may be more correct

[16-Oct-18 04:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
At the point where price is "stable", I can't see where something like your suggestion wouldn't be acceptable to any larger miner that has any forethought

[16-Oct-18 04:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[16-Oct-18 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yesterday is obviously best, but at the lightning pace that it's all moving time is relative and, imo, any short-term "lost" new adopters will not be perma-lost

[16-Oct-18 05:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I asked the guy who asked in chat... to not ask in chat 😉

[16-Oct-18 05:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes they are providing me with funds to do that stuff.   Pay Vosk-spiff authors and stuff. Paid for digpri listing with it 👍

I don't keep them for myself...

If you want to use it for marketing let me know I can even send you the viewing key

[16-Oct-18 05:24 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes and big time think you get like 30% of the blocks?

Yes Passcombo.   I have been collecting the emails from the contest and will continue to encourage its use for each raffle going forward.   The website will also have a subscribe window.    
We use Zoho for now, but may swtich to OnePage which is what KMD uses.
