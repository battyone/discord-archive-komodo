Morning.   Yes I do not like the Topia listing fee... and they seem like they don't respond rapidly to anything.   Their listing fee is paid in DOT which is their coin which is crap considering you need 4 Million of them.

[19-Nov-18 03:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Bittrex requires a howey/token opinion letter which we do not have yet.

So who's making our paper wallet once we have the art settled?  
Hit me up, splitting a bounty between you and the art guys working on it.

[19-Nov-18 04:33 PM] blubbi#0643
why not sending this msg to fiverr support ?

[19-Nov-18 04:37 PM] jansako#3330
@FishyGuts when crex24 definitely falls through, would you please confirm/ping me? They are sitting on 'some' of my Pirate. I know, I took a chance when they enabled deposits, thought they would open trading as well. I have a support case, but don't really expect their support to be able to do anything for now.

[19-Nov-18 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
as soon as they find it on the explorer, they will send it back

@FishyGuts reported that account for spamming. if a couple more do same it may get closed?

[19-Nov-18 04:39 PM] blubbi#0643

[19-Nov-18 04:39 PM] BlockTech#6895
Well, are we sure it's really the guy, or just one of his competitor trying to make him BAN ? =/ (5'800 positiv review is a lot, why would he start threatening people ^^)

[19-Nov-18 04:39 PM] blubbi#0643
in both cases, better fiverr know of it

I donated my all (6) miners with 7.77 ARRR. https://piratechain.org Ty. txid:561a2c12e7b8b5fdf4abaa69e7beed226378aab9f1ea74287ae589a8c44afce5

[19-Nov-18 05:06 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
@Flexatron about 100

[19-Nov-18 05:07 PM] blubbi#0643
KMD looks pretty similar to 14.10.18

[19-Nov-18 05:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Crex24 Officially can't or won't take the time to integrate our coin at this time.  
I still want to get an exchange with 1M + daily volume.  I applied to two more last evening.

[19-Nov-18 05:07 PM] Acura#2748
Easyrabbit Exchange had offered us to list ARRR for a small listing fee. And they have already listed Zcash on there Page .

[19-Nov-18 05:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have a couple small exchanges I can app to but the DigPri experience has been fine for the small exchange scenario.

[19-Nov-18 05:08 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
well thats a damn shame.... 😦

[19-Nov-18 05:08 PM] Seko#7408
Freiexchange too, but the volume is low...

[19-Nov-18 05:09 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
