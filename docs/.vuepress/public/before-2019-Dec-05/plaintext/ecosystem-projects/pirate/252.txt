hello

[01-Nov-18 06:18 PM] TheGemologist#6023
1 question.. If im renting hash and then suddenly my hash stop flowing to pool because the price in nicehash went higher than mine. After, it back flowing again... Will i earn less coin in this case comparing to the case the my hashrate was continuous through the time in a higher price ?

[01-Nov-18 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
assuming overall nethash is the same (unlikely) if you provide the same amount of hash, you would get the same number of coins

[01-Nov-18 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
but nethash is changing all the time

[01-Nov-18 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so really it is an integral of your hashrate/nethash

[01-Nov-18 06:20 PM] TheGemologist#6023
So technically there is no problem if there is interruptions during my rent :

[01-Nov-18 06:20 PM] TheGemologist#6023
??

[01-Nov-18 06:20 PM] TheGemologist#6023
caused by factor mentioned above

[01-Nov-18 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
assuming you are not a large percentage of overall nethash

[01-Nov-18 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
and the nethash stays relatively stable

[01-Nov-18 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
it wont matter, subject to specific luck of the pool

[01-Nov-18 06:22 PM] TheGemologist#6023
thx

[01-Nov-18 07:55 PM] jansako#3330
It can matter on the pool. If the pool is PPLNS, and the interruption is long, you may lose all your contribution to that block

ARRR!

[01-Nov-18 09:44 PM] yorktronic#2703
@TheGemologist  one way to help alleviate that problem is to have an order that consumes the minimum required hashrate (0.1 MSol/s on NiceHash) with a price around the weighted average of the order books, or just above it. You can also do this with MiningRigRentals, using less hashrate, and have it set for a long period of time.

[01-Nov-18 09:45 PM] yorktronic#2703
@TheGemologist  then you can have a nicehash order that's at a relatively low price that "catches" surplus hashrate when it comes up

[01-Nov-18 09:45 PM] yorktronic#2703
people have written bots to manipulate those order books

[01-Nov-18 09:46 PM] yorktronic#2703
the idea behind my suggestion is to have an address that is always receiving hashrate, though it might not always be receiving the target hashrate that you want

[01-Nov-18 09:49 PM] yorktronic#2703
basically, slightly overpaying for hashrate just to keep submitting shares is better than getting the best possible price but going to zero Sol/s regularly

@yorktronic Tell me if i understood correct, i will have a small order sending hash with minimum possible (0.1) at or above suggested price from NiceHash and the main order with the limit i want and lower prices

I PMed @jl777c but if anyone else knows how this can be fixed (or if it's a network issue of some kind) let me know. This is on a VPS running Ubuntu.

[02-Nov-18 12:15 AM] cipi#4502
pretty sure that is because people are starting their daemon with the option "bind=127.0.0.1", instead of just "listen=0"
with bind=127.0.0.1, the IP gets advertised, but since the daemon does only listen to localhost, all the connection attemtpts to this IPs will naturally fail

Anyone using blockfolio? How do you add mining earnings there?

[02-Nov-18 09:39 AM] yorktronic#2703
manually

[02-Nov-18 09:39 AM] yorktronic#2703
it's annoying

[02-Nov-18 09:40 AM] Oszy#5734
it's okay but it wants me to select an exchange all the time i want to add a transaction

[02-Nov-18 09:41 AM] Oszy#5734
but it didn't cost me anything as it's from mining

[02-Nov-18 09:41 AM] Oszy#5734
it annoys me that it says i am in fake profit or loss because of that

[02-Nov-18 09:42 AM] yorktronic#2703
there's a cost basis for whatever you mine

[02-Nov-18 09:43 AM] yorktronic#2703
at the time when it hits your wallet basically

[02-Nov-18 09:43 AM] yorktronic#2703
unless you want to use when the pool credits you confirmed earnings

[02-Nov-18 09:43 AM] yorktronic#2703
which is far more annoying

[02-Nov-18 09:44 AM] Oszy#5734
ok, but what if i am mining for free? or got the coins from a contest? so i can't select that it costed me nothing

[02-Nov-18 09:45 AM] yorktronic#2703
you can just select a dummy exchange and put in 0 for the cost

[02-Nov-18 09:45 AM] Oszy#5734
oaky

[02-Nov-18 09:45 AM] yorktronic#2703
it's only if you care about what it's worth later vs. when you mined it
