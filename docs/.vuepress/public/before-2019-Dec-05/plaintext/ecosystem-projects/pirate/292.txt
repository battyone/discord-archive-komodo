I got the z_getnewaddress issued figured out..seems as komodod was running even though I don't remember starting it and for some reason -cli stop wasn't actually stopping it.

[10-Nov-18 01:32 AM] crypto_mang - pool.cryptomang#6019
Anyhoo...now I keep getting an "unauthorized" zaddress error in my nomp.

[10-Nov-18 01:47 AM] crypto_mang - pool.cryptomang#6019
Does Pirate use shielding?

[10-Nov-18 01:47 AM] 11AM - Farrel Polk#1152
Nice! Came home from work I see pirate pool catching up. I switched pools though, going to contribute to the spread

[10-Nov-18 01:48 AM] 11AM - Farrel Polk#1152
Shields all day

[10-Nov-18 01:51 AM] crypto_mang - pool.cryptomang#6019
Ok..so it's diff than KMD in that regard

[10-Nov-18 02:00 AM] crypto_mang - pool.cryptomang#6019
Ok..just trying to get the picture.  I'm getting an "unauthorized" error in nomp when I try to connect a miner.

[10-Nov-18 02:00 AM] crypto_mang - pool.cryptomang#6019
I'm using my zaddy in my miner

[10-Nov-18 02:06 AM] crypto_mang - pool.cryptomang#6019

I have several other cryptos

[10-Nov-18 02:07 AM] crypto_mang - pool.cryptomang#6019
Does the pirate.json have to specify shielding and Overwinter?

People like @miketout and @radix42 are so great to the Komodo ecosystem.    They are reasons why it bothers me when people ask if we‚Äôre gonna ‚Äúmigrate away from Komodo‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy would you launch on Komodo‚Äù.

[10-Nov-18 03:00 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Someday soon people will see.  It‚Äôs fun to talk pirate because I get to educate on Komodo too.    Noting gets me more excited when they start off with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not too familiar with Komodo. I‚Äôve heard of it...‚Äù
