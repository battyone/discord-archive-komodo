If you did not yet migrate your ARRR funds from sprout to sapling be sure to do that before 15th of February, if you need help just join the official Pirate Discord and ask in #exclamationz-migrate-helpexclamation channel (Discord link above)

You do need to migrate from sprout to sapling by the 15th though

We do have a community user sending notifications.  There are no requests for wallets or personal info.  Please be sure NEVER to send you wallet info to anyone from an unsolicited DM.  Official Pirate Team members will never ask you for those unsolicited.

[dscrd-cz] <FishyGuts> Hey yall.   Do you like games?
:scallywag: Ahoy mateys! With great pleasure we announce the opening of the first cycle of 

üéâ ARRR LOTTERY üéâ

üçÄ ARRR Lottery is a raffle-type lottery game, played in cycles. 

‚Ñπ The cycle is opened by the lottery administrator, and ended automatically by the lottery bot after 7 day(s). The winners will be announced in #pirate-chat .

üèÜ There will be 3 randomly selected winners, winning 80%, 10%, 5% from the pot, respectively. The remaining ARRR will be used to start the next lottery cycle. 

üéü Buy tickets by issuing the !arrrtip buyticket amount command (specify the amount of your choosing; minimal amount to buy is 1 ARRR). You can also buy tickets in direct messages, or in privacy mode by appending private to the command. You can buy an arbitrary amount of tickets - the more tickets you buy, the greater your chances will be in the drawing.

üóí At all times, all bought lottery tickets for cycle can be audited by issuing the !arrrtip lotterytickets command (data is anonymized).

üí° At all times you can get help by issuing the !arrrtip lotterymanual command. 
üí° To see current lottery cycle info, including the tickets you bought (delivered in DM), issue the !arrrtip lottery command.
*If you have the Arrr tipbot here you can particpate cross/discord.*  
Have an admin contact me about adding that and the KMD tipbot if you guys wish üòÉ


Tag me in #newpirates and I will send you some $ARRR to try it out.   That goes for anyone. üòÉ
