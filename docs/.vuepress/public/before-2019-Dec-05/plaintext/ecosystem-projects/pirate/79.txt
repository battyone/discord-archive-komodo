Hi! I'm new in this Discord channel, but old KMD fan. I'm running PIRATE node from 36xxx blocks.   Unfortunately, I have the impression that node and gpu miners are not sufficiently appreciated, but stick to the community. Ty

[28-Sep-18 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ronyi It's not that GPUs aren't appreciated, but rather that they are not very profitable in the wake of ASICs

[28-Sep-18 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_still runs a ton of GPUs_

not really low (10 cents), but I can't just throw away $50k worth of equipment because it only makes 10% of what it used to

i've got 4 PIRATE with random mining testing.

same, but need laptop for work so dont really want to have the fan blowing the entire time :p

[28-Sep-18 05:28 PM] Mylo#8306
maybe install a virtual machine on your work laptop, then visit miningrigrentals.com and you can rent other people's hardware to point to the mining pool.

[28-Sep-18 05:28 PM] Mylo#8306
that's what that screenshot above is.

[28-Sep-18 05:28 PM] Llama#1330
maybe something went wrong

[28-Sep-18 05:30 PM] Mylo#8306
depends what you've got.  i tested (by renting from MRR) someone's 1060 and someone elses 1080 and had 1kSol for about 3 hours and 120sol/s for another 10 hours.   think it mined 2 PIRATE
