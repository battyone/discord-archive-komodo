Hmmm...contact the support and wait, they are fast. I was unlocked 30 minutes later. You’re alone with this problem? I can open all handles, but not yours. I had the same problem. I have contacted the support with following message:
„Hello medium.com,

my account @Seko1900 was blocked/deleted.

I don’t know how what happened.

If I made a mistake, then I am sorry. Did I violate the policy?

Then it was not intentional!

Can you please unlock my handle again? I love medium and have well trained myself.

Best regards from Germany“

The answer I got few minutes later:
„Sorry you are experiencing that.

It looks like your Medium account was mistakenly caught in our spam filter. I have now restored your account and all your posts. We apologize for this inconvenience.

If you need anything else, please let me know.

Thanks,
Jonas
Trust and Safety“

Nice work on the sapling testings this morning fellas. Over the coming month, I will endeavour to lend a hand where I can.

[23-Nov-18 10:44 PM] Seko#7408
I had previously published a PIRATE article.  It was about a 100 ARRR competition and about followers.  That in combination made me run into the spam filter.

[23-Nov-18 10:44 PM] Seko#7408

By the way, we have a second Blackbeard on board here.

@ronyi @webworker01 @Deleted User @Alright and anyone else wants to test sapling activation to PIRATE chain, please clone and build `FSM` branch from here https://github.com/PirateNetwork/komodo
chain params coming soon

FYI there have been recent changes to FSM branch, pull if you are feeling salty

[23-Nov-18 10:54 PM] KNOX#9338
@webworker01 yes, new test chain for testing PIRATE equivalent. we need explorers, pools working with sapling and this chain will be used for that

[23-Nov-18 10:55 PM] KNOX#9338
@dukeleto we would be glad if you join as well

[23-Nov-18 10:55 PM] KNOX#9338
i'm compiling on seednode

[23-Nov-18 10:56 PM] KNOX#9338
we have more than an hour from now before sapling will activate using the link i shared

[23-Nov-18 10:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
@KNOX you will see my name in many commits in FSM branch 😃 I am involved in various ways. I also plan to write some tests for ac_private, so we can automatically run tests in an ARRR-like chain, in regtest

[23-Nov-18 10:59 PM] KNOX#9338
Yes, I have seen your name @dukeleto

[23-Nov-18 11:00 PM] KNOX#9338
@webworker01 i like :pirate:

[23-Nov-18 11:02 PM] KNOX#9338
I'll post the params soon. it will take some time to compile FSM branch

[23-Nov-18 11:03 PM] KNOX#9338
i assure you will get the params before you finish compiling the specific branch

[23-Nov-18 11:03 PM] KNOX#9338
PIA and PPIA has different activation time

[23-Nov-18 11:05 PM] SHossain#0007
Yes, those chains has deadline of 15 February 2019. the one in PirateNetwork has 30th November deadline. good

[23-Nov-18 11:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
@KNOX heads up that switching from other branches to FSM sometimes confuses the build system

[23-Nov-18 11:06 PM] SHossain#0007
@webworker01 PIA and PPIA wouldn't make complete test

[23-Nov-18 11:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you get weird compile errors, do a fresh git clone

[23-Nov-18 11:06 PM] KNOX#9338
@dukeleto run `./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)` again

[23-Nov-18 11:06 PM] KNOX#9338
error may occur

[23-Nov-18 11:06 PM] KNOX#9338
2nd time will be good

[23-Nov-18 11:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@KNOX just believe me, sometimes it ain't 😃

[23-Nov-18 11:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
sometimes not even `git clean -fdx` does the trick, time to set fire to the ship and jump overboard

[23-Nov-18 11:09 PM] KNOX#9338
You are right.

seed node still compiling

[23-Nov-18 11:20 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
I just bought 1 BCHSV at 59 usd...is that wrong?  Here is my thinking...this is the same team of people that took bct to 20k/coin...owning one of the coins of this team at 60 bucks seems like a great value
is that stupid?
..hell...if it goes to zero I have a coin in this historic crypto war...its a 60 dollar souvenir

[23-Nov-18 11:21 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
maybe I'll print out the block ..put it in a frame and get Craig Wright to sign it one day...hang it in my pirate cabin
