thanks you sent me 1, but it hasn't been delivered

[30-Aug-18 11:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Z tx usually take from 1-2 min to process after showing op id

[30-Aug-18 11:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Check op id status

[30-Aug-18 11:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
There must be a message in opid

[30-Aug-18 11:32 PM] Mylo#8306
ok will check.

[30-Aug-18 11:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

and once there is a way to exchange it, it can be used for commerce

[31-Aug-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
go forth and seek a central exchange

[31-Aug-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810

[31-Aug-18 10:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what you mean?
wasn't it suppose to be just a test coin?
we don't have any found usecase for it

[31-Aug-18 10:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
putting on exchange this coin is exactly like putting DOGE on exchange, which was a joke actually.

[31-Aug-18 10:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and people bought and traded that joke

[31-Aug-18 10:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
at least this is a nice research and development coin.

[31-Aug-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
I mean with a central exchange assigning it value, it will allow it to have a usecase

[31-Aug-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
that being a 100% private coin

[31-Aug-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
that has an externally determined value

[31-Aug-18 10:55 AM] jorian#4555
i'm not too sure about the name PIRATE then..

[31-Aug-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810

Yeah, a name like PIRATE is good for testing but something like (private ) BANKER sounds better for a more 'serious' coin.

To trade $PIRATE on a Central Exchange, the exchange has to do it Only via z transactions.
What are your thoughts on having $PIRATE coin trading on a Central Exchange?
Would you like to trade this MOST (I guess) Anonymous coin on exchange?
