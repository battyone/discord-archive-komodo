And I gave a comparative response, to which you personally attacked me instead of my analogy

[26-Feb-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and more available trading pairs is more trading pairs that are available, which many would feel is a good thing

[26-Feb-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
CB also instituted KYC across the board, probably due to listing USDT pairs

[26-Feb-19 05:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
If anyone else said that Genie would imply they were stupid and valued dog shit.

[26-Feb-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
my personal opinion is that it is a net step backward to have CB require KYC to get USDT trading pair

[26-Feb-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
in any case, people have expressed possibly controversial statements, some agree with, others disagree and have their own controversial statements. That is fine. crossing the line into personal attack is not

[26-Feb-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
@meatspoon not sure why you are insisting you should have the right to be able to personally attack genie

[26-Feb-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
you dont like him, we get that

[26-Feb-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
debate the facts, agree to disagree. please stop with the personal insults

[26-Feb-19 05:16 PM] meatspoon#7860
He is rude and offensive to people on the regs. He is basically an armchair bully

[26-Feb-19 05:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Facts are not rude
because, words

[26-Feb-19 05:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
I don’t respond well to arrogance and seeing someone talk down to people constantly

[26-Feb-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
@meatspoon nonetheless, i hope you can refrain from personal attacks. it doesnt help your cause

[26-Feb-19 05:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
He purposefully tries to rile people and irritate them.

[26-Feb-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can prove that genie is rude and offensive, then prove it. dont just start calling him names

[26-Feb-19 05:18 PM] meatspoon#7860
So if such behavior is acceptable, others should treat him that way.

[26-Feb-19 05:18 PM] meatspoon#7860

[26-Feb-19 05:18 PM] meatspoon#7860
How many people saying they find him to be rude would it take to count as “proof?”  Serious question.

[26-Feb-19 05:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`He purposefully tries to rile people and irritate them.`
Or I have a personal stake in ARRR and a complete loathing for USDT

[26-Feb-19 05:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
CB listing USDT is a 1.1-1 odds bet as the reason they required KYC.   

Not sure what their goal was here.  
I guess with more volume yesterday than BTC that makes sense but it turns crypto into a speculative trading asset class instead of a utility which it was initially set out to be. 

I don’t agree with Genie’s approach a lot of the time.   I do agree with his statements.    
We are all grown up enough to be able to agree to disagree and still work towards the same goals. 

It’s a fine line.   

Thank you for sharing the news @meatspoon

[26-Feb-19 05:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I too, despise USDT and the idea of stablecoins.  
They’re backed by a system we’re trying to escape.  

And now that system wants to have 30% of the trading volume based on it.  Kind of sad.

[26-Feb-19 05:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That said, even if the river we have to cross is flowing with feces, the shore on the Otherside is promising enough to do so.

[26-Feb-19 05:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That last one can apply to your feelings on KMD discord if you wish @meatspoon 😜

Also, one community member should not outlay the entire mood of the whole project.  
Challenging ones thoughts and beliefs should be an exercise in growth, not a battle for supremacy.

[26-Feb-19 11:41 PM] coyote#8010
USDT, while backed by the shitty ass dollar still allows for a safe haven that doesn't require using banks

```Do I have to go through the KYC process?

Going through our know your customer (KYC) form and approval process is required to issue and redeem USD₮ and EUR₮.
Persons domiciled or resident in the following jurisdictions are prohibited from using the Tether platform.

Cuba; Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea); Iran; Pakistan; Syria; the Government of Venezuela; and Crimea. Verified Users’ access to the Tether platform will be restricted while they are in these restricted jurisdictions.
U.S. persons are also restricted from using the Tether platform unless they are Eligible Contract Participants (“ECP”) pursuant to U.S. law.

[27-Feb-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
was the audit of tether ever done? is it really backed by anything, even for the few that are able to legally use it?

[06-Mar-19 09:43 PM] phm87#7395
I heard that when coins are mined, they appear on a transparent address then they must be moved to a z_adress then all tx are done between z_addresses. Does anyone know if the move from the initial transparent address to the z_address is performed automatically by the coin or if the pool should perform it ?

[06-Mar-19 09:44 PM] phm87#7395

@phm87 
there's a "test chain" listed in the pins in #pools-and-operators  over there
but because of the way komodo works there was no need to make a testnet

[06-Mar-19 09:50 PM] phm87#7395
yes metaphilibert explained me it (and he created a KMD testnet for me)
