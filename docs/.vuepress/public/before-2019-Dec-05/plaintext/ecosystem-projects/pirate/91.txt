[29-Sep-18 06:20 PM] oblox#6897
Did you really accumulate a large stash at 0.001 block rewards off SUPERNET???

[29-Sep-18 06:21 PM] Alright#0419
only about 10k KMD

[29-Sep-18 06:22 PM] oblox#6897
The blocks are 0.001 are they not? Seems like a long grind

[29-Sep-18 06:22 PM] Alright#0419

I think it's great it isn't even listed on WTM or other sites yet.

[29-Sep-18 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
seems hashrate would double or more, once it gets onto the mining sites

[29-Sep-18 06:42 PM] bishop#9773
yeah, definitely

[29-Sep-18 06:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
PIRATE current block diff is ~ 4x KMD block diff

[29-Sep-18 06:46 PM] snowdamn#2414

its not like KMD mining is slowing down at all

[29-Sep-18 07:23 PM] zatJUM#9924
WTS 8k @ 0.115 KMD or 0.00002 BTC each. Offer valid 2 hours. DM if interested.

[29-Sep-18 07:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
why bother with 'Offer valid 2 hours.' when you just repost every 2 hrs?

{Reactions}
😂 🤔 

[29-Sep-18 07:24 PM] zatJUM#9924
not every 2 hours. check it again

[29-Sep-18 07:25 PM] zatJUM#9924
and if price moves quickly, I can change my offer

[29-Sep-18 07:25 PM] snowdamn#2414
has the 5% APR been disabled for when miners don't send to z or no such thing to begin with?
too lazy to go through the code

[29-Sep-18 07:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my bad, you skipped the noon posting 😣

👍 

[29-Sep-18 07:26 PM] zatJUM#9924
I post an offer when I know I'll be able to answer if someone's interested

[29-Sep-18 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
on the KMD side, it is best to claim rewards first. then send to zaddr

[29-Sep-18 07:33 PM] snowdamn#2414
first time i lost my interest like that did not hurt as much as the second lol 😂

[29-Sep-18 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810

[29-Sep-18 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810

[29-Sep-18 08:07 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Ahahaha @jl777c

[29-Sep-18 08:07 PM] Buddz1993#5380

[29-Sep-18 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810

Contact CryptoProphet about PIRATE - OTC trading and an article on the idea/launch/security.   Any other ideas?

[29-Sep-18 08:25 PM] Llama#1330
datadash wont talk about it

[29-Sep-18 08:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Trello is a place where ideas can be posted and not get lost in a sea of chat.

[29-Sep-18 08:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Ok Good to know.  Llama I will creat a card for "Will not talk about PIRATE" and we can circle back around with them all in a few weeks/months.

[29-Sep-18 08:25 PM] Llama#1330
well i didnt ask him

[29-Sep-18 08:26 PM] Llama#1330
I just know that he doesn't talk about things unless they are super established. @Colm can vouch for that too.

[29-Sep-18 08:26 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I'd say an asset chain launched on KMD that has a higher hashrate already than KMD... is worth looking into.  

The coin is Functionally complete.

[29-Sep-18 08:26 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Ill put it on the list.

[29-Sep-18 08:28 PM] Colm#3677
The only way you can get Datadash to talk about something is by sponsoring a DashCast episode
