PIRATE can never go mainstream as your chicken cant be known

[25-Sep-18 08:52 PM] actionslacks#4072
the feds are gonna love this shit

[25-Sep-18 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
so central exchanges will be forbidden from listing it

[25-Sep-18 08:53 PM] dolladollaiv#3294
So send 15 kmd from kmd z-addrs to posted address to receive 777 pirate? Sorry, newb.

[25-Sep-18 08:53 PM] SHossain#0007
forget about that list @Hermes . that bounty is over and thanks for helping me on that

[25-Sep-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe even call anybody with any PIRATE as some sort of criminal

[25-Sep-18 08:53 PM] 0x03#8822
probably 😄

[25-Sep-18 08:53 PM] Llama#1330
or a pirate

[25-Sep-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
I like the name

[25-Sep-18 08:53 PM] SHossain#0007
@Hermes sent your fair share of :pirate:

[25-Sep-18 08:54 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe govt will not take it serious thinking it is a joke

[25-Sep-18 08:54 PM] Flexatron#8809
Then let it stay lowkey lol

[25-Sep-18 08:54 PM] actionslacks#4072
well monero is on the news quite a bit these days

[25-Sep-18 08:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`maybe govt will not take it serious thinking it is a joke`
I made that mistake and missed out on a month of mining 😭

[25-Sep-18 08:54 PM] SHossain#0007
Pinned a message.

[25-Sep-18 08:54 PM] jl777c#5810
but based on the demand from day one for PIRATE, I have a feeling the hashrate keeps going up, which means the price keeps going up

[25-Sep-18 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
XMR has been seriously privacy violated with their early bugs

[25-Sep-18 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
of course not as bad as BTC, but with the limited mixin of XMR, probably enough for the govt supercomputers to deanonimize most of the transactions

[25-Sep-18 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
I think the 777 PIRATE for 15KMD offer needs to be time limited

[25-Sep-18 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
or total PIRATE limited

[25-Sep-18 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
for now we only have enough PIRATE donated for a few dozen onboards so far

[25-Sep-18 08:58 PM] Regnar#6164
So send KMD (can it be from T address?) to RYMCJfpUTyYuWHttvLD7VPv12wrFsAZQDt to receive 777 PIRATE? I'll bite.

[25-Sep-18 08:58 PM] dolladollaiv#3294
Same question^

[25-Sep-18 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes but you need to send in your zaddr also

[25-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Hermes#6934
YOu will need a Z address @Regnar you can create one with create address option

[25-Sep-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
DM @SHossain I think is the best way

[25-Sep-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
best to generate it on the PIRATE chain

[25-Sep-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise you need to import it

[25-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Regnar#6164
Just finished loading PIRATE chain and have a Z address on it

[25-Sep-18 08:59 PM] actionslacks#4072
countdown to Fed infiltration....

[25-Sep-18 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
best is to sync PIRATE, generate zaddr, send in KMD and DM @SHossain the txid of the 15KMD and the zaddr

[25-Sep-18 09:02 PM] snowdamn#2414
so, 🐳 sending for the onboarding are happy with 0.02 PIRATE/KMD it seems. i wonder what the total gathered will be. tempted to offer them to shorcut straight to my DMs for full amount lol 😂

[25-Sep-18 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody know how many blocks PIRATE had in last 24 hrs?

[25-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Flexatron#8809
33M....diff....

[25-Sep-18 09:04 PM] CHMEX#0686
approx 1486 in the last 24 h

[25-Sep-18 09:05 PM] CHMEX#0686

[25-Sep-18 09:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[25-Sep-18 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
surprising that with this hashrate increase we didnt end up with a lot more blocks. I guess the diff adjustment is pretty good

[25-Sep-18 09:12 PM] SHossain#0007
i dont' want them to get wet in case of rain. the storage box i'm using doesn't have enough ventilation. tomorrow, will try to make some holes and put couple of noctua compouter fans

[25-Sep-18 09:34 PM] jl777c#5810
does anybody know how to get PIRATE onto the main mining calculator sites?

[25-Sep-18 09:34 PM] jl777c#5810
what else does PIRATE need?

[25-Sep-18 09:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is there any way of determining how many coins are out there?

[25-Sep-18 09:35 PM] Regnar#6164
Lite mobile wallets 😉

[25-Sep-18 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810
blockheight * 256

[25-Sep-18 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810

Nice.

[25-Sep-18 09:36 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Also.... @Jl777 why don't pirate addresses start with X?

[25-Sep-18 09:36 PM] Regnar#6164
it'll likely need an exchange rate.

I was too lazy to change the prefix for the zaddrs

[25-Sep-18 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
@Regnar maybe chmex can make an "api" that returns that days OTC rate and we just manually edit it when it changes a lot

[25-Sep-18 09:37 PM] Regnar#6164
actually maybe not. Some sites have some random no priced
