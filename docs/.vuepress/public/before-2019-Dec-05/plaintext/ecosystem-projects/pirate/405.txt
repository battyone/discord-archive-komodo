[dscrd-prt] <Hember> I forgot as there were so many great news. I remember that someone is going to suggest him ARRR tattoo, but what will be the circumstances? Is he a guest of ARRR or is ARRR the guest of McAfee?

[21-Nov-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <house> ARRR is the guest of Hardfork who have also invited mcAfee to the table for discussion on Privacy @Hember

its one address that ALL asset chains use in Komodo ecosystem

[22-Nov-19 04:31 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I  guess I dont even know if pirate is a fork or and asset ATM

[22-Nov-19 04:34 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
if ARRR = komodo asset chain then my  address would be the same as LABS, CHIPs ect except it would be a smart z(chain address) --- ill  go check out the setup  at pirate.black

[22-Nov-19 04:41 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I answered my  question - but I will leave this  post for  education - use Versus AGAMA with same seed   - start Pirate  - get addresss - "Send it and forget it"  - eventually AtomicDEX will support zaddreses and it will pop up  - and yes pirate is an asset chain of komodo

[dscrd-prt] <Showlitenetwork> Good morning here

[22-Nov-19 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jackclark> Hi, transferred ARRR to my SevenSeas wallet.  Later restarted computer and wallet won’t load.  It’s stuck on “Activating best chain” for 30+ minutes.  Can anyone help me know how to get past this and load the wallet?

[22-Nov-19 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jackclark> Running SevenSeas wallet on Windows.  Keeps saying “activating best chain” and won’t load further.  Also says “no connection” in lower right corner of wallet.  Was running fine before computer rebooted.  I had a significant ARRR balance on the wallet, and now I can’t load it.  Is this malware?

[22-Nov-19 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `Also says “no connection” in lower right corner of wallet... Is this malware?`
Yes, Windows OS is malware; Windows hijacks your control of core computer functions and is stopping your wallet from connecting to other nodes (which is why you cannot get into a synced state)...

[22-Nov-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jackclark> OK, do you know how can I fix this?  Everything had synced previously when I installed the wallet, and I was able to transfer ARRR from an exchange to the wallet.    My firewall is off.

[22-Nov-19 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> I don't think you have anything to worry about. Your coins are safe. I do not use SevenSeas but have had issues with the other wallet and I find that if I download the bootstrap (copy the bootstap files to the correct location) it all started working fine again.

[22-Nov-19 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jackclark> Thanks for both of you for you responses.  The wallet just spontaneously connected after an hour or so of not being able to.  Strange, but fortunately now I see my balance.

[22-Nov-19 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> might also be worth making a copy of wallet.dat and keeping in a safe location. then delete wallet.dat and restarting the wallet.

[22-Nov-19 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> then importing your z address

[22-Nov-19 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> good news

[22-Nov-19 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jackclark> Yes, I’ll make a copy of wallet.dat.  I notice my z address is gone.  Should I just hit “new address”?

[22-Nov-19 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> if you want to add a current z address then you will need to run the command to import

[22-Nov-19 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jackclark> OK thank you

[22-Nov-19 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> z_importkey (followed by) secret-extended-key- (then your key)

[22-Nov-19 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> think you will then have to rescan

[22-Nov-19 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jackclark> I’m now seeing the prior z address under transactions.  Thanks so much for your assistance.  Wishing the best for this project.

[22-Nov-19 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `secret-extended-key-` is **part of** the key
not something that your key follows

[22-Nov-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> of course. but he might not have known to include this. :troll:

[22-Nov-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jackclark> Yes, I didn’t know that.  Thanks for clarifying.  Learning fast here.

[22-Nov-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jackclark> Now that I have a new z address under “receive” in the wallet, will transfers to the old z address still go to my wallet, or is that old z address now gone?

[22-Nov-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> if you import the old key into the new wallet, then you will have both (it may take a wallet restart for it to appear)

[22-Nov-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> transfers to any address always go to that address, so if you don't import the key for that address then you will not see the funds for that address
