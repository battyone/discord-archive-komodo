- holy shit I can‚Äôt believe how great @Seko and his international crew of pirates, and specifically his first mates... @Oszy , @Flexatron and @Mixic really have been putting forth some great material.    I am very proud of them and happy to have them on board.   Same with the translators too.   I can see our exposure and reach hitting foreign language clients.  Thank you guys!

[09-Nov-18 02:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If you guys want to encourage that, tip @Seko he distributed his tips to his team.

[09-Nov-18 02:31 PM] LooTz#2749
Should try creating more educational content  on why how aarrr is awesome ?

[09-Nov-18 02:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Gonna get someone hitting Bitcoin Talk harder.

[09-Nov-18 02:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes Loots - I want to get two videos made.

[09-Nov-18 02:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
One for why privacy on crypto is important and another on why arrrr is better.    I have two video producers who want to work on this material.

[09-Nov-18 02:32 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Team interview requests have all gone out.  I am waiting for all those back as well as my attorney to call about getting a foundation setup for Pirate.

[09-Nov-18 02:32 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Road map work will get picked up and laid out in the next week or two.

[09-Nov-18 02:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
100k ARRR order on DP was pulled?

[09-Nov-18 02:33 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have some interviews to get wrapped up, two for print.   It‚Äôs a nutty week for me.  Sorry I haven‚Äôt been around so much.   Lots in the background.

[09-Nov-18 02:33 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Loots- I still want to pursue that idea we spoke about a couple weeks ago.

[09-Nov-18 02:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I would like to get some of this infrastructure set tho.  


We WILL be doing that 100% and just have to time it right.

[09-Nov-18 02:34 PM] Oszy#5734
@Cryptoon some if it got filled then lowered to 0.08 and now pulled

[09-Nov-18 02:34 PM] Oszy#5734
guess it wasn't james üòÑ

[09-Nov-18 02:36 PM] LooTz#2749
So many communities have no idea about you, it's like a private bubble in komodo discord. You need a regular writer to write articles and submit them to guest posting sites. Add them to social media.

[09-Nov-18 02:36 PM] LooTz#2749
Etc

[09-Nov-18 02:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@LooTz yes to the Material.    Every week the authors and editors are writing one well versed article.

[09-Nov-18 02:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If you have some outlets and ideas @LooTz can you reach out to @Seko ?

[09-Nov-18 02:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
He‚Äôs good with communications and SEO and he would be the one to manage and get you what you need in that I believe.

[09-Nov-18 02:38 PM] LooTz#2749
LinkedIn I recently discovered is a great place to post it an article for serious people's

[09-Nov-18 02:38 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It‚Äôs easy to cross post all these medium articles we have written and you are right about cross exposure.

[09-Nov-18 02:38 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I‚Äôve got a linked in with a pretty solid history.   But non of my followers are crypto people.   They all mortgage and loan guys.

[09-Nov-18 02:39 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Seko can you get with @LooTz to explore some of these ideas he has!

[09-Nov-18 02:39 PM] FishyGuts#5085

I‚Äôll do my best to provide and resources needed too!

[09-Nov-18 02:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Thank you for reminding me of the crypto bubble.  I am guilty of doing his myself.   But even the smartest best and brightest do the same.

[09-Nov-18 02:40 PM] LooTz#2749
You get all social media accounts created for pirate ?

[09-Nov-18 02:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We don‚Äôt have Facebook because they don‚Äôt do privacy

[09-Nov-18 02:41 PM] LooTz#2749
Pinterest, Facebook etc

[09-Nov-18 02:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But we have most others.   No Pinterest.

[09-Nov-18 02:41 PM] LooTz#2749
You should have all of them with links back to the site it's easy google seo juice

[09-Nov-18 02:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We have international pirates getting on other sites - @rrrj288 is Chinese and posts to Weibo and QQ.

[09-Nov-18 02:42 PM] LooTz#2749
Use keywords when creating all of them

[09-Nov-18 02:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Glad to do all this... not sure where to start or specifically what you mean. üòÇ

[09-Nov-18 02:42 PM] LooTz#2749
So when someone googled most anon coin pirate social medias will come up along with the pirate.black site

[09-Nov-18 02:43 PM] house#8741
set em up brother @LooTz just as the Pirate Chain is privacy focused, best not to support non-privacy centric platforms

[09-Nov-18 02:43 PM] house#8741
but 3rd party is good

[09-Nov-18 02:43 PM] LooTz#2749
It takes time and lots of work

[09-Nov-18 02:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Let‚Äôs get together on this later yes?    About 6 hours from now.

[09-Nov-18 02:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Just need to understand all the pieces your taking about and I can work on it over the weekend as I find time.

[09-Nov-18 02:44 PM] LooTz#2749
I have meeting with blockfolio later

[09-Nov-18 02:44 PM] LooTz#2749
I'm free now

[09-Nov-18 02:44 PM] LooTz#2749
More then happy to talk

[09-Nov-18 02:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have to head out to a meeting for the next 2 hours.

[09-Nov-18 02:44 PM] LooTz#2749
Ok I'll be around li und late tonight as always

[09-Nov-18 02:45 PM] LooTz#2749
Lootz is always here

[09-Nov-18 02:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@LooTz you're talking about having keywords in titles, descriptions and such right? Not just within the articles?

[09-Nov-18 02:50 PM] Oszy#5734
that's META you thinking about

[09-Nov-18 02:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So glad to make all that happen.    Will need help and direction.  

I write loans and market.   You want a 5% repsonse rate on your campaign... I‚Äôm your guy.   

Have not to this Point learned or understood web or SEO but glad to learn and do what‚Äôs necessary.   I have to / we have to. üëç

[09-Nov-18 02:51 PM] Oszy#5734
his point was to start using keywords in the articles that otherwise wouldn't be in the article. "best anon coin" you can do this as a "tag" at the end of the article for example

[09-Nov-18 02:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm addicted to learning and helping so if anyone wants to drop some knowledge my way, im game.

[09-Nov-18 02:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok so yeah to add that long list of extra words into things.

[09-Nov-18 02:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Looking at youtube for "best privacy crypto" and similar there isn't a whole lot coming out right now, I think any videos will have a great effect.

[09-Nov-18 02:53 PM] Oszy#5734
exactly. but if there will be a video titled this about pirate it will come up 1st place

[09-Nov-18 02:53 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ive been listening to xmr vs zcash vs ??? comparison while I work lately to increase my knowledge on the subject.

[09-Nov-18 02:54 PM] Oszy#5734
that's great, the more you learn the better, so you can put off those trolls on reddit making no sense üòÑ

[09-Nov-18 02:54 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Yeah, exactly!

[09-Nov-18 02:54 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I want to fight the good fight and possibly write an article.

[09-Nov-18 02:55 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I have the opportunity to listen to stuff all day while working so, if anyone has some good things to share, please feel free.

But i gotta hear over loud fans.

[09-Nov-18 02:59 PM] LooTz#2749
@Cryptofist yea man sorry was talking to ronny bosing from open ledger missed his message overnight

[09-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Cryptofist#7504
aye no worries

[09-Nov-18 03:00 PM] LooTz#2749
yea you should have a list of you favorite kwyords and should sprinke them into all the social medias

[09-Nov-18 03:00 PM] LooTz#2749
in title descriptions its

[09-Nov-18 03:00 PM] Oszy#5734
in SEO you have to think about what you would search for

[09-Nov-18 03:00 PM] Oszy#5734
what people would serach for to find you

[09-Nov-18 03:00 PM] LooTz#2749
seo give more weight to the keyword being in front of the sentence also so starting with the keyword is extra points

[09-Nov-18 03:01 PM] LooTz#2749
well back in the day we all tried ranking for 1 or 2 keywords, these days you need a lot more

[09-Nov-18 03:02 PM] LooTz#2749
so have a list of lsi keywords

[09-Nov-18 03:02 PM] Oszy#5734
now you need phrases rather than words

[09-Nov-18 03:02 PM] LooTz#2749
phrases are keywords as well

[09-Nov-18 03:02 PM] Oszy#5734
i know that's not what i meant üòÑ

[09-Nov-18 03:02 PM] LooTz#2749
"What is Pirate Coin" <---- keyword

[09-Nov-18 03:02 PM] Cryptofist#7504
best privacy coin, most private coin, top privacy coin

[09-Nov-18 03:03 PM] LooTz#2749
even though it not a word lol i gotcha

[09-Nov-18 03:03 PM] Cryptofist#7504
What is pirate crypto

[09-Nov-18 03:03 PM] Oszy#5734
it was different 10 years ago that was literally 1 word spamming üòÑ

[09-Nov-18 03:03 PM] LooTz#2749
yea start with your name always first

[09-Nov-18 03:03 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I usually search for "X coin market cap" first

[09-Nov-18 03:03 PM] LooTz#2749
if you type in pirate coin and your site does not come up first, you have more work to do just on your name

[09-Nov-18 03:03 PM] Cryptofist#7504
when researching, then for gems offf CMC i gotta dig more

[09-Nov-18 03:04 PM] Oszy#5734
especially when you chosse a common word like pirate

[09-Nov-18 03:04 PM] LooTz#2749
yup

[09-Nov-18 03:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I think "pirate coin" is key to focus on because piratechain is called that more often than... piratechain lol

[09-Nov-18 03:04 PM] Oszy#5734
pirate coin = shiny gold treasures

[09-Nov-18 03:04 PM] Oszy#5734
hence do not name your coin blue waffle

[09-Nov-18 03:04 PM] Oszy#5734
üòÑ

[09-Nov-18 03:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
