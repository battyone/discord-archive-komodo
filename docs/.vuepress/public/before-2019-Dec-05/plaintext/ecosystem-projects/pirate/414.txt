[dscrd-prt] <Privatoshi> That's good. I've never done it. You'll definitely learn something, just as I would.

[dscrd-prt] <Privatoshi> Email sucks IMO

[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> Just stick to memo fields and zksnarks :troll:

[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> I think one of the hardest things setting up your own email server is incoming email spam/malware protection. Big providers like Google do a great job on that.. You can see it if you setup Google to fetch your email from a random self hosted account where the address is publicly know. The amount of phishing/malware emails is astonishing.

[dscrd-prt] <Privatoshi> I know who is sending me email

[04-Dec-19 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Privatoshi> Whoever isn't on that list, is spam

[04-Dec-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> That's one possibility. Might work for you!

[dscrd-prt] <Privatoshi> This one was just as bad. Read the fine print.
Someone, I think @ph03nix asked me my opinion on it in HUSH a few weeks ago

[04-Dec-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> @Privatoshi Unfortunately I don't have a solution for you. Try setting up your own server, shouldn't be impossible - and it's a good way to learn. Sendmail felt difficut to setup 25+ years ago, must be easier today ðŸ˜‰

[dscrd-prt] <Privatoshi> @scubapanda I'm not looking for a solution. I was merely giving my opinion.

[04-Dec-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Privatoshi> I don't care for email. I could set up an email server but it would be a waste of time.

[04-Dec-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> Ok.

[04-Dec-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Privatoshi> Thank you though, sir
