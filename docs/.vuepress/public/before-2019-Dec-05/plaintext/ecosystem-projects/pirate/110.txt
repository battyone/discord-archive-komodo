kmd = pirate before the weekend at this rate

`kmd = pirate before the weekend at this rate`
I wouldn't go quite that dramatic, but at the new sustained rates I can see 0.75 KMD in the not too distant future

it seems to outperform other privacy-focused coins in some (a lot of?) ways. we could - as crypto space - for once focus on something that is done right.

like I told someone a little bit ago
2 days ago I was mining 2x what I am now, 2 days before that I was mining 2x what I am now at 1/2 the cost of now

[04-Oct-18 12:27 PM] 0x03#8822
i dont get it. i'm mining a little bit. whatever price increase happens to PIRATE will likely be very well-perceived by everybody involved.

but that approach (more will help more) is why we now have webbrowsers that consume GBs of ram.

usually that means 'more bandwidth, cpu, ram, <insert here>'

[04-Oct-18 12:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
more bandwidth = my largest issue here

[04-Oct-18 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
got a whole building that would take 2 days to turn into a decent server farm --- with net speeds of 10M down and 0.5M up 🤣

[04-Oct-18 12:38 PM] 0x03#8822
thats not even enough for a miner farm 😛

[04-Oct-18 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

English profanity is an amazing exception to ESL accents 🤣

[04-Oct-18 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've worked with many people that I can't understand 20% of what they say because of their accents, every one of them says "mother f@#$r" and "dickhead" with perfect clarity

[04-Oct-18 12:46 PM] 0x03#8822
because theres so much spoken examples of the 2 words to learn from 😉 most german pupils will also speak a rather american dialect of english just because they hear it 'everywhere' 😄

[04-Oct-18 12:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Meanwhile, in the US you can't get students to lean English, much less any useful version of a 2nd language 😣

[04-Oct-18 12:48 PM] 0x03#8822
whats the top 2nd language in the US? spanish?

[04-Oct-18 12:48 PM] 0x03#8822
not by numbers of speakers, but by... education

I’d say Spanish is 2nd

[04-Oct-18 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Our schools are still stick in the 1800s -- they usually teach a choice between Spanish and French

[04-Oct-18 12:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

it's french here, because 'deutsch-franzoesische freundschaft' (german-french friendship). what a joke. the elementary school right next here does sport classes... in french

[04-Oct-18 12:52 PM] 0x03#8822
i'm not joking, i witness it twice a week when it's warm enough to let them outside on the school yard

[04-Oct-18 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, for a german school, french makes far more sense than in a US school

[04-Oct-18 12:53 PM] 0x03#8822
i just fail to understand how anything but english makes sense as the first language to teach besides mother tongue

i mean we tried forcing esperanto and that didnt work

[04-Oct-18 12:53 PM] 0x03#8822
can we fucking stick to english please?

in countries with languages too small to bother translating, it is shown with english audio and subtitles, basically a language lesson

[04-Oct-18 12:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Actually, @0x03, from a "word for word" stance English is easy to learn, but from a structure sense English is one of the stupidest languages in the world

[04-Oct-18 12:57 PM] 0x03#8822
in the end, it will enable people to communicate.

[04-Oct-18 12:57 PM] 0x03#8822
easier than require everybody to learn french for example

*cant bring himself to sell any*

[04-Oct-18 01:05 PM] snowdamn#2414
if you're not a miner, you got no business selling!!!

[04-Oct-18 01:06 PM] snowdamn#2414
still don't have any btw

[04-Oct-18 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if you're not a miner, you got no business selling!!!`
I know plenty of non-miners that have plenty of business selling and they'd be making 3-8x by doing so

[04-Oct-18 01:07 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, if 3-8x is satisfactory, sell

[04-Oct-18 01:07 PM] house#8741
Just looking for excuses to sell but me brain won’t let me

[04-Oct-18 01:07 PM] snowdamn#2414
good brain

[04-Oct-18 01:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
3-8x is 2-10x more than miners are making 😛

[04-Oct-18 01:07 PM] snowdamn#2414
wow

[04-Oct-18 01:08 PM] snowdamn#2414
that's why i say mining sucks 😀

[04-Oct-18 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but if everyone followed the "mining sucks" axiom along with the "if you're not a miner, you got no business selling" axiom, then the coin would go nowhere
>You can't have it both ways, Senator

[04-Oct-18 01:10 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, i have made prior statements about the importance of both for the ecosystem

[04-Oct-18 01:10 PM] snowdamn#2414
works out perfectly in the end 🤓

[04-Oct-18 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Until you count that miners are douching the KMD price to cover the costs of mining

[04-Oct-18 01:12 PM] snowdamn#2414
KMD is a hidden gem
either crypto will go nowhere generally or the gem will inevitably be found

[04-Oct-18 01:12 PM] snowdamn#2414
you can take that to the bank

[04-Oct-18 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
