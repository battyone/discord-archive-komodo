[25-Sep-18 09:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I only used cli so far.

[25-Sep-18 09:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Agama has PIRATE added in it's code

[25-Sep-18 09:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I think it hasn't been released yet

[25-Sep-18 09:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so may be next Agama release you can use PIRATE from it's GUI

[25-Sep-18 09:27 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think any marketing blast should coincide with Pirate being accessible from agama. I guess I should learn how to do z transactions now

no problem mate 🙂

[25-Sep-18 09:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackjok3r if you want to sell those PIRATE, I can buy them 😄

[25-Sep-18 09:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain I think it's good idea you can announce your idea of bounties

[25-Sep-18 09:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
best use it for marketing bounties

[25-Sep-18 10:00 AM] SHossain#0007
I don't mind. That 10,000 can be used for any good reason for the chain

[25-Sep-18 10:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
- similar to KMD infographics, PIRATE Infographics bounty

[25-Sep-18 10:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
include my 10,000 PIRATE for this bounty too

[25-Sep-18 10:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
total counts to 20,000 PIRATE for bounties

[25-Sep-18 10:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I leave the decision to community decide on bounty tasks and allocation of amounts to those bounties

[25-Sep-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
I like the idea of onboarding

[25-Sep-18 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
basically a support process where new users are guided through installing agama, syncing PIRATE, generating zaddress and then receiving some PIRATE. they would pay market rate amount of KMD to the onboard support person, who would keep the KMD for the service

[25-Sep-18 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
this allows relatively non-tech peoples to get some PIRATE and a way for support peoples to earn KMD

[25-Sep-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
for larger purchases, above the onboarding amount, specific deals would need to be negotiated

as @dukeleto point in early discussions

[25-Sep-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
seems 0.02 to 0.05 is the current OTC rate, so 777 PIRATE would be  15.54 to 38.85 KMD worth. seems a good amount for the onboarding. so we just need onboarders who help people get their 777 PIRATE in exchange for 15 KMD

[25-Sep-18 10:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
man! it doubled already ? 😄
