@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  does it have to be version 0.3.4 ??

[24-Oct-18 06:02 PM] Algorismus#9195
for ewbf

[24-Oct-18 06:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 all have 200,9 removed, so yes

[24-Oct-18 06:04 PM] Algorismus#9195
omg makes so much sense now

[24-Oct-18 06:04 PM] Algorismus#9195
thank you a lot @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

when the pool has little users, it doesnt find blocks as fast, but when they are found the rewards are greater because they are only split between those people
when you have more people you find more blocks but the rewards are less because they are split between many people
i would go with the bigger pool if you want more regular payouts, but with the infancy many things can potentially change

[24-Oct-18 06:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
here Someone asked me today about "team" members, devs and the likes entering the giveaway... 
Here is my official stance:
These people work hard on pirate.   They are really not compensated for their time in any set terms.   This is a product of learning and the passion to develop.  If they want to facilitate the growth of the community in ways that most others are unable to, then you better bet your sweet peg leg having, eye patch wearing,  swine sweat swiling pirate ass that I am going to let them.  If I could give them more entries I would.   

This isn't some waltonchain bullshit where I'm gonna post from the Pirate chain account - 
🚀 🚀 🚀 ❤ ❤ ❤  OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE I WON.  @PirateChain YOU'RE THE BEST!!!❤ ❤ ❤  🚀 🚀 🚀  


These are hard working community members working very hard on very cool behind the scenes stuff and I hope you agree with me on the above.  
And if ya don't, well shove off ye land lubbers.   
I will be video taping the draw results as well so rest assured, everyone who is playing fairly will have the appropriate  chance to win!
