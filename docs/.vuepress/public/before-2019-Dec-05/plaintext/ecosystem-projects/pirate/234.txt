Quick look at something I'm working on, "relative difficulty" of mining #Equihash coins, for use when choosing what is the easiest coin to mine at any given time (relatively speaking, within a set of coins of your choosing).

[27-Oct-18 08:48 PM] yorktronic#2703
basically it compares current difficulty to SMA over some user-defined window

[27-Oct-18 08:48 PM] yorktronic#2703
in this case 24-hours

[27-Oct-18 08:48 PM] yorktronic#2703
anyway I have all kinds of stuff like this so I'm stoked to get Pirate into the mix of other Equihash coins

thanks @jl777c -- I've been looking at that but I need the raw data. I'll just get it from the chain.

[27-Oct-18 08:51 PM] yorktronic#2703
thanks for the tips

[27-Oct-18 08:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
York, is this something we can use on our website?   Is it a snapshot or is it a data stream?

[27-Oct-18 08:51 PM] yorktronic#2703
hm

[27-Oct-18 08:52 PM] yorktronic#2703
let me think about that

[27-Oct-18 08:52 PM] yorktronic#2703
I'm building a site with another guy right now to show stuff like this in real-time

[27-Oct-18 08:52 PM] yorktronic#2703
you guys seem cool so I figured you would find it interesting if I threw pirate in there too

[27-Oct-18 08:52 PM] Oszy#5734
we could link a dynamic image on the site if you can update the img with a cron every day or so.

[27-Oct-18 08:53 PM] yorktronic#2703
but as far as one-off analysis and stuff go I'm happy to share whatever I come up with

[27-Oct-18 08:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I see.  
That‚Äôs fine... people just love graphs and data. 

Also @bhteam ^^^ 
Hit this guy up.  Looks like he‚Äôs got a useful tool that could be applicable to your site.

[27-Oct-18 08:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Awesome thanks @yorktronic be sure to tag us when you post relevant data!

[27-Oct-18 08:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@yorktronic - @bhteam runs the mining and crypto information site crypto-coinz.net

[27-Oct-18 08:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Perhaps it‚Äôs a service / tool you could provide for them. 
Just a thought.

[27-Oct-18 08:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Maybe I‚Äôm in the wrong direction here though üòÉ

[27-Oct-18 08:55 PM] yorktronic#2703
I want to put my own site together with my partner, but it will be free to use

[27-Oct-18 08:55 PM] yorktronic#2703
