Logical, we are in the pirate Bay here, are  there any rules?

I still dont understand LOL. So this is a

[02-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
test chain right?

[02-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
Are there plans to make something of it

[02-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or is that just up to how the future pans out

[02-Sep-18 11:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
not anymore 😄

[02-Sep-18 11:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
at least for me, not anymore.

[02-Sep-18 11:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
don't count my words if it's test chain or not.

[02-Sep-18 11:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't advice anyone on that decision.

[02-Sep-18 11:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
Are you going to be working on it 😛

[02-Sep-18 11:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
probably, 🙂

[02-Sep-18 11:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I only buy stuff for 2 reasons:
- I will use that for either my expenses sometime in future
- or I'll be using that to build the projects

[02-Sep-18 11:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
these are the only 2 reasons so far for my portfolio

[02-Sep-18 11:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and it's a very small portfolio.

WTS - 100k PIRATE @ 0.005 KMD each ☠

[02-Sep-18 11:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
monster pirate!

[02-Sep-18 11:38 AM] SHossain#0007
until someone buy at that price, i'll keep mining 😃

[02-Sep-18 11:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
keep mining

[02-Sep-18 11:42 AM] SHossain#0007
@blackjok3r is mining with rockets 🚀

[02-Sep-18 11:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
are there actually centralized exchanges that will be able to trade pirate? 😮

[02-Sep-18 11:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
If anyone wants to sell at 0.000777 I will buy 1000kmd worth 😛 Offer will last for the next 7 days.

[02-Sep-18 11:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so far I spent this much on PIRATE:
275 + 200 + 100 + 50 + 50 = 675

[02-Sep-18 11:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
1287000 pirate -> 1000kmd

[02-Sep-18 11:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
@Hollowman9000  taught me how to lowball 😛

[02-Sep-18 11:48 AM] SHossain#0007
when i mine 1 million, i'll put the price more higher. i already managed to sell a small chunk @ 0.0025 KMD each

[02-Sep-18 11:48 AM] SHossain#0007
this is gold and it is cheap 😄 ☠

[02-Sep-18 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If there is this much market for it now, I will keep mining 😄

[02-Sep-18 11:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't know what others think or realise, but I understood from James' comment that just privacy alone is the strongest feature of PIRATE.

[02-Sep-18 11:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and that doesn't need a roadmap. it's a done feature. use it now feature.

bugs are found and thanks to the community we have this as a live chain

[02-Sep-18 11:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and that helps even better

[02-Sep-18 11:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now to get pirate added to some marketplaces 😂

[02-Sep-18 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, PIRATE wont be getting much more features, it really cant

[02-Sep-18 11:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the devs like @dukeleto and @Alright are killing those bugs and helping @jl777c

[02-Sep-18 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
get just one central exchange to process z deposits and z withdraws and that alone will provide an external pricing for the PIRATE coins

[02-Sep-18 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
when binance?

[02-Sep-18 11:54 AM] Deleted User#0000

[02-Sep-18 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
I am not so happy with digitalprice

{Reactions}
😮 

[02-Sep-18 11:56 AM] SHossain#0007
Digitalprice  requires BTC for updating a wallet daemon. 😦

[02-Sep-18 11:56 AM] SHossain#0007
so, if any coin is listed there, you update your source, you need to pay them

{Reactions}
🤢 

[02-Sep-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
and this within weeks after initial payments were made and they didnt disclose such pricing. so it is possible after block 1 million, their KMD goes onto a fork

[02-Sep-18 11:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
>yes, PIRATE wont be getting much more features, it really cant
agree. but a product/service around PIRATE can be built. That I can expect.

[02-Sep-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly. a totally z-based coin is ready to be used

[02-Sep-18 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Somewhere I can sell my pirate treasures 😛

[02-Sep-18 12:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
would be so cool to see this private chain on tor based CEX 😄

`"difficulty": 149014.0189939037` 😦

[02-Sep-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah we need a public pool, at the moment there is unfair advantage to people who know how to set up a stratum. I mined so many of these in a couple of hours on friday night it was hilarious.

[02-Sep-18 12:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
@blackjok3r or you could bridge that advantage by teaching us how to setup a stratum

[02-Sep-18 12:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
😛

[02-Sep-18 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok can do. I made enough free money off this its only fair.

[02-Sep-18 12:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c what API calls are important for a centralised exchange ?
withdraw: z_sendmany
receive: z_getnewaddress
manage coin/funds: z_mergetoaddress

DB operations: keep link of user login and it's associated z address
regular backup, and backup of backups.

[02-Sep-18 12:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess that's a lot of management stuff ... 😄

[02-Sep-18 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
actually everything would be the same that they have to do now, with the difference being using z address for deposit

[02-Sep-18 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
and z address for withdraw

[02-Sep-18 12:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
no I was thinking from the ground up. not thinking of existing CEX

[02-Sep-18 12:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
thinking like if I have to code the CEX

[02-Sep-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
dont overthink it. just need to find a technically competent exchange who can handle zaddress from z_getnewaddress and payments via z_sendmany

[02-Sep-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
best to work with an existing exchange

[02-Sep-18 12:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
right...

[02-Sep-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
why make a CEX from scratch??

[02-Sep-18 12:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
let's see... does anyone has contact of cryptopia.co.nz ? 😄

[02-Sep-18 12:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@dukeleto

[02-Sep-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
there are thousands of existing central exchanges, just find one forward thinking enough to create z deposit/withdraw capability

[02-Sep-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
once this is in place, then all zcash forks can also be supported and it will have some large popularity is my guess

[02-Sep-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, cryptopia would be good

[02-Sep-18 12:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree

[02-Sep-18 12:15 PM] SHossain#0007
i can ask cryptopia if needed

[02-Sep-18 12:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes would be good idea mate

[02-Sep-18 12:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
before that, I guess we need update/change our ANN thread

[02-Sep-18 12:16 PM] SHossain#0007
please do 😃

[02-Sep-18 12:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so please give me nicer formated text of that

[02-Sep-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is quite popular as it is and as it is feature complete for what it does, there is no need for any more PIRATE core improvements

[02-Sep-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
it is all about the PIRATE community to get it out there and create an external price point

[02-Sep-18 12:16 PM] SHossain#0007
also, it would be nice if someone can write couple of paragraph explaining this COIN, feature and why this would be good for their PR would be nice

[02-Sep-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
currently it is 0.001 KMD

[02-Sep-18 12:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes

[02-Sep-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
what will its total emissions be?

[02-Sep-18 12:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
emissions: a putting into circulation

[02-Sep-18 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
total coin supply

[02-Sep-18 12:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Exactly to be 39,821,823.99884100 by year 2023

[02-Sep-18 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so about 40 million, with pretty front loaded emission due to short halving period

[02-Sep-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
best to get a mining pool also to spread ownership

[02-Sep-18 12:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
- Block halving every 77777 blocks.
   - aprox every 54.01180556 days

[02-Sep-18 12:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
buying a domain for it now.

[02-Sep-18 12:20 PM] SHossain#0007
@webworker01 is working on a pool setup.

[02-Sep-18 12:20 PM] SHossain#0007
@0x03 do you want to setup a pool as well for PIRATE?

[02-Sep-18 12:21 PM] SHossain#0007
would be nice to have minimum 2 pools 😃

[02-Sep-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can do a pool, once someone else figures out how to make it pay out 😄

[02-Sep-18 12:23 PM] SHossain#0007
I will give away 25k PIRATE to first 5 PIRATE pool operators

[02-Sep-18 12:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can support those pools by buying those PIRATES 😄
