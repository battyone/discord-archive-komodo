Yo thanks 🙏 😎

[28-Oct-18 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE needs special changes but hardforking PIRATE earlier would be possible

[28-Oct-18 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
but no promises on timing

Will each T have a limit on it?

[28-Oct-18 08:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
1 vin, then locked

[28-Oct-18 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
not locked, but z -> taddr -> z as a "bundle" if possible

[28-Oct-18 08:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
T addresses will be ‘legal’, to ensure continued privacy, how will their use be limited, or is that still up in the air?

[28-Oct-18 08:47 PM] AndrewK#3947
Are there any plans to create a web wallet service for Pirate? This will definitely be a lot easier to do after sprout, but would give Pirate a huge boost. Not everyone is up to downloading, synching and running a full node

[28-Oct-18 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
one time use, just as a bridge

[28-Oct-18 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
in time, lite sapling SPV will be

[28-Oct-18 09:37 PM] yorktronic#2703
@AndrewK I agree, something like https://wallet.myhush.org/ (though I think you can only do t-addr transactions through the web wallet)
