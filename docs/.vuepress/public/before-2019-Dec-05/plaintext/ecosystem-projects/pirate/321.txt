didn't realize you meant the same addy won twice

[18-Nov-18 05:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
thought you meant 1 person won twice with 2 differing sets of creds

[18-Nov-18 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_isn't participating just because of the telegram requirement_

[18-Nov-18 05:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Have another idea for verification? Mainly trying to deter the people who like to game every little thing they can.

[18-Nov-18 05:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure how requiring a person to join telegram does that

[18-Nov-18 05:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Not that they cant now, but multiple telegrams is more of a pain than discord.

[18-Nov-18 05:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
just tell them to write the date & Mike_O on a piece of paper, take a selfie and send it to you :trollface:

Its a mindfuck trying to figure out how to be fair sometimes, even more so when you know you are in a group of people who value their privacy highly.

[18-Nov-18 05:23 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I wouldn't expect anyone here with a non white name to be gaming the contest @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  if their is another way to verify I will gladly add  "telegram OR XXXXX" to the fine print for week two.

[18-Nov-18 05:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
``even more so when you know you are in a group of people who value their privacy highly`
So you design a contest that requires them to give their personal information to a 3rd party?

[18-Nov-18 05:26 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I came up with the best set of ideas and rules I could, how would you do it?

[18-Nov-18 05:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, there's no real way to avoid someone "gaming" the contest, that keeps in line with privacy, even with forcing them to join an app that uses phone #s that aren't disclosed(I have 9 of those)....

[18-Nov-18 05:33 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm just trying to run a a fair and fun contest here meanwhile supporting the project in some way.

[18-Nov-18 05:33 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I feel like you are giving me a hard time for the fun of it.

[18-Nov-18 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
one approach would be to pick the pool with the fewest participants and have a contest for just that pool

[18-Nov-18 05:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not "for the fun of it", because you asked
I simply stated that I wasn't participating because of the requirement to join some random app site that requires my personal info

[18-Nov-18 05:36 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I think that there should be some sort of "If the pool is over 50% hash it's not eligble."

[18-Nov-18 05:36 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The pool ops still get their bump... and they really are champions for hash spread and equalization / decentralization.

[18-Nov-18 05:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I dont know.. this is a tough contest, that's why I passed it to Mike.   He's doing great, I have been on a small pool for a week now.

[18-Nov-18 05:38 PM] mrlynch#5735
it could be a bit hard with the 50% hash .. this week coolmine.top has sometimes been on the same or close to same hash % of piratepool

[18-Nov-18 05:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I think that there should be some sort of "If the pool is over 50% hash it's not eligble."`
The downside to dPoW; on most other coins, people lose their shit if a combination of subsidiary pools reach 30-40% 😛

[18-Nov-18 06:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
hehe.  We've tried not to do that.  Seems like a good idea thought to spread that hash out.

[18-Nov-18 06:28 PM] Cryptofist#7504
🤔

[18-Nov-18 06:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We usually dont get all freaky about Pirate pool owning most of the hash.

[18-Nov-18 06:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Glad @Cryptofist put this contest together.

[18-Nov-18 06:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I didn't win this week.  Damn!

I sent in apps to two more medium sized exchanges this evening since @Crex24 didn't seem to have the devs to make it happen.  
Someone is gonna want some of this trading volume, I know it!

Cryptopia listing would be about 12-15 BTC unless anyone here has a bunch of DOT to donate.

[19-Nov-18 07:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Working on the paper wallet so we can then tumble that into the Shop Plugin development.  
I think Someone is working on a general roadmap as well  🐙

@Acura where is arrr listed?

what has the otc price been for Pirate?

[19-Nov-18 09:44 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Cryptopia takes 15 BTC for listing?? not sure it's worth it. After they list Arrr they may abandon maintenance if wallet will be broken. @dukeleto  what you think? Anything better then Cryptopia?

[19-Nov-18 09:45 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
better polo then topia maybe

[19-Nov-18 09:55 AM] Flexatron#8809
too expensive

[19-Nov-18 09:55 AM] Flexatron#8809
IMO

[19-Nov-18 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
the reality is that there only a 0.000001% change topia will be able to implement zaddr support and a 99.99999% chance after they fail to do it, wont refund any payments made

[19-Nov-18 10:07 AM] Flexatron#8809
risk reward ratio to damn high

[19-Nov-18 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
15BTC is the price to get onto one of the big exchanges

[19-Nov-18 10:15 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
from small exchanges coinroom.com , stex.com could be an option? also sonox comming soon? med-volume there is gate.io, poloniex, bittrex bigger then this I doubt would list a new coin with not many exchanges...

[19-Nov-18 10:17 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
coinexchange should list for free as Arrr got daily volume = 10% of current coinexchange volume as for last 24h

[19-Nov-18 10:20 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I asked coinexchange they said 3 BTC 😂 after I said it's too expensive they went down to 2 BTC but the person said was not relevant to discuss discounts, but anyway for them good business to list even for free. They could get 0.5BTC bonus if they do quick and seamless, proving capability of coding z into their exchange.

[19-Nov-18 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont think coinexchange would be able to do it quickly

[19-Nov-18 10:24 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
then we can forget it - small vol exchange not much help for Arrr liquidity (nice to have, not must have)
