artificial or not

[07-Oct-18 08:07 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
does PIRATE check for the 'absurd fee' - so transaction has to be > fee?

[07-Oct-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
ZEN spends $400,000 per month, we would spend 30 PIRATE per month for 10,000 per day

In the future

[07-Oct-18 08:08 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
question if it make sense at all, just an empty marketing trick or even not really ?

[07-Oct-18 08:08 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
at least cost small

[07-Oct-18 08:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Well the answer is simple...  

it costs more to makeover an ugly pig than it does a pretty woman.

[07-Oct-18 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it does increase the anon set

[07-Oct-18 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
I have said this, do I need to repeat it again?

[07-Oct-18 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it will slow down all nodes syncing

[07-Oct-18 08:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Not to some.   Not everyone heard it and it’s part of our info campaign going up.

[07-Oct-18 08:09 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
well if the stupid contest is "who makes more", not "which one is truly used more"

[07-Oct-18 08:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I’ve been posting about the tx set more on media.

[07-Oct-18 08:09 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
veryfying truly may be hard though

[07-Oct-18 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
we can find out exactly how many ztx there are

[07-Oct-18 08:10 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but I have 1 test idea - histogram of amounts differentation

[07-Oct-18 08:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It’s not about the amount of transactions or use pass.  It’s just about the whole shielded base regardless of transaction purpose

[07-Oct-18 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
so we should find out what it takes to be #1 and just send out that many ztx

[07-Oct-18 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, all ztx look the same

[07-Oct-18 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
that is how zero knowledge is leaked

[07-Oct-18 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
as all look the same

[07-Oct-18 08:10 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ah yes not amounts here 😃

[07-Oct-18 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
even if they are "useless"

[07-Oct-18 08:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Honestly these will work themselves out in the future.   It would be nice to have them now for marketing... but at less than 2 months since INCEPTION, I think we’ve got good ground moving and made it to coming together.    We don’t need to force any metrics to be the best.  We will be the best in all areas if we aren’t already the best in some.

[07-Oct-18 08:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The 98%+ shielded is already a big “metric” to throw out now.  That’s a good one.

[07-Oct-18 08:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Info campaign followed by sapling campaign will win the hearts of many.

[07-Oct-18 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
99.9%

[07-Oct-18 08:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Damn 99.9% now?

[07-Oct-18 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
if @Deleted User would reduce his taddr balance it would get close to 99.99%

could you not just run multiple kicker scripts to increase tx #?

[07-Oct-18 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is what i said

[07-Oct-18 08:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I didn’t start the protocol to hunt them down.  I only did it once 🤣
Someone else is sailing after the rest.

[07-Oct-18 08:48 PM] kangster#3597
how does dexstats work? Can I sell ARRR on there too?

[07-Oct-18 08:48 PM] Flexatron#8809
You can sell to @CHMEX  through #otc-project

[07-Oct-18 08:54 PM] kangster#3597
so @CHMEX  buys OTC and sells through DEXStats?

[07-Oct-18 09:04 PM] Dr Debt#0891
its onboarding, which is designed to give newcomers access to pirate from an automated source

[07-Oct-18 09:04 PM] Dr Debt#0891
eliminates the possibility of an OTC deal going bad

`so @CHMEX buys OTC and sells through DEXStats?`
yes

[07-Oct-18 10:09 PM] Llama#1330
how would you describe this project as a whole?

[07-Oct-18 10:09 PM] Llama#1330
like "A community coin created by the Komodo devs"?

[07-Oct-18 10:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
A community coin created in the Komodo Ecosystem

[07-Oct-18 10:10 PM] Llama#1330
is the website community made?

You can’t multiply by zero genie.  You know that.

[07-Oct-18 10:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then it should try

[07-Oct-18 10:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You’re not wrong

[07-Oct-18 10:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Does it work if you put us pleb electric rates in?

[07-Oct-18 10:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, it needs watts too ( I think)

[07-Oct-18 10:56 PM] Flexatron#8809
How is the otc rate incorporated?

[07-Oct-18 10:56 PM] Flexatron#8809
:)

[07-Oct-18 10:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
random BTC value 🤦🏼

[07-Oct-18 11:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It uses the dex stats boarding rate I believe flex

[07-Oct-18 11:10 PM] Flexatron#8809
Cool

[07-Oct-18 11:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Conversion Rate is 1KMD = 4.3478 PIRATE. 1 PIRATE = 0.23 KMD `
Me no see no BTC der cap'n

[07-Oct-18 11:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
There an api that does the conversion of KMD to btc

[07-Oct-18 11:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@CHMEX worked it up.   Thanks bud!

[07-Oct-18 11:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

2⃣ 🇽 

[08-Oct-18 03:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes it is not the steal it once was but it’s typically below market rates.

[08-Oct-18 03:28 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Is it set to auto adjust with hashrate/difficulty

[08-Oct-18 03:41 AM] jspook16#3059
I don't think so. I think it's manually adjusted cause it changed during the middle of me making a few onboards

[08-Oct-18 03:43 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes it’s manually adjusted

[08-Oct-18 03:44 AM] jspook16#3059
Maybe it's time to raise it again :trollface:
