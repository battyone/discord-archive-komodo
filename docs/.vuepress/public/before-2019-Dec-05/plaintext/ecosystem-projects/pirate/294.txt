Statement from the researcher of the TITANIUM Project https://titanium-project.eu/ on ZCASH (EU project), which is concerned with deanonymizing various crypto currencies: The situation is more difficult with Zcash, another Bitcoin derivative, which can encrypt transactions itself using zero knowledge proofs. A colleague from Haslhofer researched it in the spring: "We can track normal transactions well, but if they use the Zcash shield, they are virtually anonymous. But that's only an extremely small part of the transactions." As long as this remains so, it is easy to separate Zcash's suspected criminal transactions from the decent ones.

@webworker01  it could be same good as bad news 😛 XMR fans will use this as "all Zcash forks are bad" and more articles needed to explain Arrr is different.

yea thats insanely cheap

[10-Nov-18 12:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
While they're jolly'ing at 1 cent per $ i'm filling my stash. With their hard earned arrr for pennies

[10-Nov-18 12:30 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
kinda wish we had OTC back.... its becoming not profitable to mine at these prices.

[10-Nov-18 12:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
Of course it's profitable to mine. The prices will go up as soon as dumpers deplete their stashes

[10-Nov-18 12:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
Have a little faith and hodl. If you really need cash, just sell enough to cover your costs.

[10-Nov-18 12:33 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
that just it, dumpers are miners and just dumping it as fast as they mine it

[10-Nov-18 12:33 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
and the nethash chilled way out, soooo thats having a negative impact too

[10-Nov-18 12:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
I'm currently covering my costs out of my own pocket and waiting for new asics to arrive

[10-Nov-18 12:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
It's still early days man. We've been on cex for less than 2 weeks and we're not even on CMC yet

[10-Nov-18 12:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
Look. Here's my story with bitcoin and maybe you'll understand why I wrote the above

[10-Nov-18 12:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
I started mining BTC early 2010 when it was worth $0.02

[10-Nov-18 12:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
When it reached $1 i was so f8ckin happy that i lost track of bitcoin's mission and sold my stash. All of it. Rest of mining proceeds i sold and kept about 5% kinda hoping it will go up even more

[10-Nov-18 12:37 PM] mrlynch#5735
In 2016 when it reached $200 i sold it all again (not a lot left) only to kick myself in the nuts in 2017 when btc was $18k

[10-Nov-18 12:38 PM] mrlynch#5735
If i were to keep 30% over the years i would have been a millionaire now but i was short sighted and jolly'ed at pennies thinking it was a good ROI

[10-Nov-18 12:38 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
yea lol id be bloody pist too lol

[10-Nov-18 12:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
Never again! Pirate has great potential and I strongly believe that it will reach $xxx within the next 1-2 years. I don't mind the wait. I won't be selling anything until it reaches $xx and even then i'll only sell enough to pay for asics and power, nothing more

[10-Nov-18 12:40 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
Ive got my pirate bag im holding, I'm just mining and selling to pay the bills and work on my ROI.

[10-Nov-18 12:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
If your bills aren't high i'd cover them out of pocket

[10-Nov-18 12:40 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
my share of electric is about 600 a month

[10-Nov-18 12:41 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
I'm not a rich man haha...

[10-Nov-18 12:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
I'm doing a daily mental exercise in the morning as i'm tempted, every day, to cash out for power & % of asics cost and i'm thinking. I'm selling 1000ARRR for $120 now to pay for some measly bills, OK. And then i'm picturing myself in my bitcoin situation thinking at how i sold 1000ARRR for $120 when it's now worth $12000. That feeling is gut wrenching and i don't sell, I buy more on top of my mining

[10-Nov-18 12:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
Of course i could be dead wrong and 1000ARRR could be by some unimaginary exponential force be brought down to $12. That's ok. That's a risk i'm willing to take

[10-Nov-18 12:44 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
yep I'm in the same struggle...

[10-Nov-18 12:44 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
But I pretty much decided I'm half way to ROI, I just want to get that back then its gravy.

[10-Nov-18 12:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
Worst case scenario i break even and don't make a profit. That's ok too. What i'm not willing to risk is my btc situation again

[10-Nov-18 12:45 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
Yea I hear ya

[10-Nov-18 12:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
Go big or go home. History has been made by strong people (men & women alike) that made hard decisions in face of risk & adversity. Now, i'm not risking death of myself and my family. I'm merely risking the cost of power & a few asics :realpirate:

[10-Nov-18 12:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
I'm not rich (stupid short sighted me) but i've learned my lessons the hard way

In late 2019 you will learn of the system I have been creating to track with evidentiary value all so~called privacy coins.

ZCash
Monero
Dash

100% traced, criminal case level evidence trails.

Have a nice life. It is too late to stop.

certainly wouldnt be surprised about DASH being deanonymized and a lot of early XMR is already deanonymized and could well leak privacy of current

[10-Nov-18 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
ZEC has so much taddr with most of the zaddr being miners shielding and z->t to exchanges, it leaks a lot of info

[10-Nov-18 12:53 PM] mrlynch#5735
Marketing hype? I'm sure he's gonna try to sell some piece of software to govs for excruciating prices that will be able to track some txs

Regarding the above discussion on dumpers and miners, dont forget that otc volume probably wasnt that high and a lot of people have just been mining without selling otc. Now that they have the option to sell on an exchange these stashes are being dumped. Once this runs out we only have miners/traders putting coins on the market and price will go up

@jl777c can you explain more about early XMR being deanonymized and leaking pricacy?

[10-Nov-18 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the dark web` is just like `marijuana`, it's some "spooky" term to demonize some random thing made up by someone that benefits from not having that thing

[10-Nov-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
XMR used to be privacy optional

[10-Nov-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810

So what? Buy more if you can

[10-Nov-18 01:04 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
but does it go lower....

[10-Nov-18 01:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
0.000019 is aprox $0.12 and 0.000016 is aprox $0.10

[10-Nov-18 01:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
Not much of a difference when you'll be selling at $10 in 2-3 months

[10-Nov-18 01:05 PM] BlockTech#6895
Just average your buy lower, by buying more, i'm doing the same, got from 0,16$ to 0,12$ now, and aiming for 0,1$ average buy 😄

[10-Nov-18 01:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
I bought when it was 0.20 as well

After there's no more to dump or arrr becomes not profitable for dumping miners, they'll move to another coin and we'll start trading at decent prices while they'll be looking bewildered from the outside
