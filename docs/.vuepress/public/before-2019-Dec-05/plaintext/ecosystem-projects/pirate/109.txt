ARRR

[03-Oct-18 09:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Llama yes, plus KMD and BTC both are down (which means the pseudo USD value changes)

[03-Oct-18 09:16 PM] cantptalblonit#9346
ARRR 😃

[03-Oct-18 09:16 PM] Llama#1330
The only reason i want to sell is to make back my investment and/or pay for more mining

[03-Oct-18 09:16 PM] cantptalblonit#9346
Matie!

[03-Oct-18 09:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
AHOY!

[03-Oct-18 10:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Just had someone PM me wanting to buy PIRATE for 0.05 KMD and when I said
`yeah, that's not going to happen, me selling at 40% of market rates`
he comes back with:
`ok Il get it cheaper when the CEX launches`
😁 🤣 😂 😭

[03-Oct-18 10:01 PM] Llama#1330
cex?

[03-Oct-18 10:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ikr

[03-Oct-18 10:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it'll be years before there's a CEX that will code a full z address system
by then it be 20x what it is now`

[03-Oct-18 10:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's 'trying to get a bargain' and then there's 'straight up delusional'

[03-Oct-18 10:04 PM] Llama#1330
what is a CEX

[03-Oct-18 10:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
centralized exchange (e.g., Bittrex, Cryptopia, etc.)

[03-Oct-18 10:05 PM] Llama#1330
ok that's what I was thinking but didn't know for sure

[03-Oct-18 10:06 PM] Llama#1330
also if it gets on a cex the price will boom...?

[03-Oct-18 10:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[03-Oct-18 10:21 PM] Llama#1330

35M ain't cheap

[03-Oct-18 10:32 PM] starcevic#0296
how long does it take to recieve the free 77

[03-Oct-18 10:32 PM] starcevic#0296
are they sent on the click or is there a date set to release

[03-Oct-18 10:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ask in #deleted-channel

[03-Oct-18 10:34 PM] starcevic#0296
on the recieve tab the private adress is the one i use?

[03-Oct-18 10:38 PM] Llama#1330
It's most likely manually sent. @starcevic

[04-Oct-18 12:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085
They are manually sent.  I will bne doing them in a few batches.

[04-Oct-18 12:28 AM] Hermes#6934
@starcevic You need to use your private z address .

[04-Oct-18 01:12 AM] Llama#1330
Is it still profitable to keep mining? I mined through last night and the net hash doubled

[04-Oct-18 01:13 AM] bishop#9773
Depends on your electric rates

[04-Oct-18 02:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Llama 
Mining_profitability = Mining_revenue - Mining_expenses
That formula never changes 😉

[04-Oct-18 02:03 AM] Flexatron#8809
50 is the new 40 Msol

[04-Oct-18 02:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
60M is the new 20M :trollface:

[04-Oct-18 02:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
find a grow house, strike up a deal free elec 😛

[04-Oct-18 04:27 AM] house#8741
94.82 MSol/s

[04-Oct-18 04:27 AM] house#8741
😮

[04-Oct-18 05:17 AM] FishyGuts#5085
You guys want me to stop reaching out to miner influencers?  😛

[04-Oct-18 06:56 AM] alibaba#0419
ahoy matey

[04-Oct-18 06:59 AM] BlockTech#6895
@FishyGuts no, that's a good job, what i'm concerned is them mining a lot now and going away because there is no cex, dumping the price.

[04-Oct-18 07:05 AM] snowdamn#2414
i wonder what effect ARRR getting listed elsewhere will have on tortuga timeline 🤔 
they'll be more than one pair outside tortuga most likely, so definitely not as exciting (to me) as the tortuga premise

[04-Oct-18 07:06 AM] snowdamn#2414
not exciting to me, but good for PIRATE

[04-Oct-18 07:59 AM] 0x03#8822
wat... still not >.1gsol?

[04-Oct-18 07:59 AM] 0x03#8822
how... disappointing 😛

```Stratum Host: stratum.pirate.komodopool.xyz
Low-Diff Port: 8888 - Hi-Diff Port: 18888 (NiceHash)```

@0x03 for your pool, do I use this for my z9 (not mini) miners?
stratum+tcp://stratum.pirate.komodopool.xyz:8888

[04-Oct-18 08:56 AM] 0x03#8822
how much hashrate per unit do these sport?

[04-Oct-18 08:57 AM] 0x03#8822
ah, 10ksol?

[04-Oct-18 08:57 AM] ronyi#5719
or use this ssl://piratechain.org:3032

[04-Oct-18 08:57 AM] 0x03#8822
this is not how we do it, ronyi

[04-Oct-18 08:58 AM] 0x03#8822
@satinder you should check out the low diff port

[04-Oct-18 08:58 AM] 0x03#8822
if it doesn't do what you want let me know, i can still add a 3rd port

[04-Oct-18 09:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@0x03 nope about 50 ksol/s each miner

[04-Oct-18 09:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have 2

[04-Oct-18 09:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so around 100 ksol/s

[04-Oct-18 09:02 AM] 0x03#8822
go for hi 😄

[04-Oct-18 09:02 AM] 0x03#8822
i'm pointing my .1msol rental at the high port every time

[04-Oct-18 09:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay 👍

[04-Oct-18 09:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so this:

stratum+tcp://stratum.pirate.komodopool.xyz: 18888

 ?

[04-Oct-18 09:03 AM] 0x03#8822
yup

[04-Oct-18 09:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, will setup

[04-Oct-18 09:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm heaving headache now 😦

[04-Oct-18 09:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will keep my miners off maybe till tomorrow

[04-Oct-18 09:04 AM] 0x03#8822

[04-Oct-18 09:04 AM] 0x03#8822

[04-Oct-18 09:04 AM] 0x03#8822

[04-Oct-18 09:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't drink. very rare.

[04-Oct-18 09:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[04-Oct-18 09:05 AM] 0x03#8822
i think you actually said that before, i was just joking 😉

[04-Oct-18 09:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[04-Oct-18 09:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
🙂

[04-Oct-18 09:05 AM] 0x03#8822
oof.

[04-Oct-18 09:06 AM] 0x03#8822
hope you're well again soon matey

[04-Oct-18 09:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll be fine...

[04-Oct-18 09:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
my wife got the headache too

[04-Oct-18 09:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
guessing these miners gave us jet-lag 😄

[04-Oct-18 09:07 AM] 0x03#8822
😃

[04-Oct-18 09:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
looking for a place to put these miners on a rented place. have a friend who have such place. let's see.

[04-Oct-18 09:26 AM] ronyi#5719
I know.... @0x03 
Unfortunately I have no ASIC miners, no one is willing to help, I can not fund it indefinitely... Global hashrate rising, but my hashrate is same(20-24Ksol/s). Unfortunately, in exchange for help, I can not offer extra stuff. Soon there will be a mining pool with 0 hash, but the pool will remain without a test. I asked for help if everything worked well(1 block). I thought I was good for the community with an EU server, but the dog did not have to. I talked yesterday @webworker01 I started to work global and diff hashrate chart, but for this help I do not want to put more energy.  I will solve it differently. thank you all for the persistent help.

[04-Oct-18 09:30 AM] 0x03#8822
in this case we'll just announce your pool first whenever somebody new joins asking for a mining pool.

[04-Oct-18 09:31 AM] 0x03#8822
don't worry, one of my other mining pools went idle for a month before anything happened.

[04-Oct-18 09:31 AM] 0x03#8822
...wait what

[04-Oct-18 09:31 AM] 0x03#8822
your pool is untested and didnt find a block yet?

[04-Oct-18 09:32 AM] ronyi#5719
as I wrote I would stay without a test

[04-Oct-18 09:32 AM] jorian#4555
to test, create your own chain

[04-Oct-18 09:32 AM] jorian#4555
and self mine it

[04-Oct-18 09:33 AM] ronyi#5719
@jorian good idea thank you.

at current rates it costs ~1 BTC to mine 45k coins
