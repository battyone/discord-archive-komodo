exact same commands and setup must be for `komodod` too

[25-Sep-18 11:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for linux users these can be setup in `.conf` file itself

[25-Sep-18 11:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and a `tor` service setup and set start on system startup

[25-Sep-18 11:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm however just trying the most simplest way. just starting Tor browser

[25-Sep-18 11:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and confirming that command params I just need to add to `komodod` command

[25-Sep-18 11:12 AM] cipi#4502
```proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
addnode=hwdkehdke2u62u7a.onion
addnode=jsyh3w5huo4j5x6y.onion
addnode=sncc4su7phf4hc3h.onion
addnode=4shay2omzoretwtz.onion
addnode=j66xfe5u43pww3e4.onion
addnode=zglsemlpr2ddvgm2.onion
addnode=onoj652tqwlf662f.onion
addnode=wqajno7lufuo5a54.onion
addnode=3t2vybqwit5ntprf.onion```
for KMD... but tor must be configured properly... you will have to add `ControlPort 9051` to your torrc file and add the user to the group `debian-tor`, so he has access to a special directory... that is for debian

[25-Sep-18 11:15 AM] cipi#4502
in fact, you don't necessarily need the addnode-directives... the wallet will simply access the "normal" nodes through tor... using .onion-addresses is just a bit faster

Just start Tor Browser on your machine and use this command

[25-Sep-18 11:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

maybe add TOR to the [ANN][PIRATE] line? along with dPoW and BTC secured

[25-Sep-18 11:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
sure, adding it there too

[25-Sep-18 12:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[25-Sep-18 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810

[25-Sep-18 12:27 PM] wookie#7663
it's impressive that Pirate isn't even publicised to mainstream and it has 1/3rd the difficulty of KMD! and 1/4th the hashpower!! The FOMO is real!

[25-Sep-18 12:28 PM] scubapanda#2485
Hashrate is around 0,2% or ZEC. Could easily see it reach 1%?

it seems even without dPoW PIRATE is pretty secure and now is ready for high value transactions

[25-Sep-18 12:42 PM] SHossain#0007
it appear so. or a little bit less, if they are overclocked

PIRATE whales. A good way to expand the userbase would be an airdrop to KMD.

[25-Sep-18 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
But I think we need to gather 1 million PIRATE to make it have any real effect

[25-Sep-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
probably better to do a funding for onboarding

[25-Sep-18 12:57 PM] SHossain#0007
That is a good idea.

[25-Sep-18 12:57 PM] riddler18k#0791
is there a real world usecase for PIRATE or this just a fun/pet project?

Is there somewhere where pirate bounties are being posted? It doesn't look like the forum has all of them (I.e the logo design)

@jl777c they were looking at doing a bitcointalk airdrop, but a KMD airdrop may be better.

now a 2nd airdrop is being discussed, to KMD holders

[25-Sep-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
@riddler18k the only usecase for PIRATE is whatever usecase there is for XMR

[25-Sep-18 01:10 PM] riddler18k#0791
@jl777c  fair enough, only thing I'd say is I hope KMD logo/colours aren't used in anyway for PIRATE. I think KMD is fabulous tech which can and hopefully will be adopted by commercial solutions given time. Blatant link to something like PIRATE could be bad PR

[25-Sep-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE needs to be marketed totally independently as it is a totally independent chain, usecase, demographic, etc.
