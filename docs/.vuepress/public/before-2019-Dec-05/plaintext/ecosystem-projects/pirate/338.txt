@KNOX @Alright there is a bug with showing balances correctly in ZEC upstream, both radix42 and I have noticed it, and it might have come in on recent merge. If you are seeing some issues with getwalletinfo/getbalance not being in sync, could be related

[24-Nov-18 05:40 PM] KNOX#9338
merged! https://github.com/PirateNetwork/komodo/pull/11

z_sendmany to allow z -> t by ParrotGotMeEye · Pull Request #11 ...
https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/43793612?s=400&v=4

[24-Nov-18 05:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
the bug has something to do with having sprout + sapling transparent funds, and not all funds show up in `getwalletinfo` until you rescan

[24-Nov-18 05:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
but `listunspent` shows it correctly

[24-Nov-18 05:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
a rescan fixes it

[24-Nov-18 05:43 PM] gt#2812
that fix seems to work

[24-Nov-18 05:46 PM] KNOX#9338
@Alright you can also use `git reset --hard` if you dont' want to keep local changes and get fresh from the repo

[24-Nov-18 05:46 PM] KNOX#9338
very fast and effective i found for testing

[24-Nov-18 05:46 PM] Alright#0419
tyty

[24-Nov-18 05:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright you can't have conflicts and do a pull

[24-Nov-18 05:47 PM] Alright#0419
@KNOX can you just comment out all the rpc checks for now

[24-Nov-18 05:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
`git stash pop` is like applying a patch

[24-Nov-18 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810

[24-Nov-18 05:47 PM] SHossain#0007
Dukeleto preferes different 😛

[24-Nov-18 05:47 PM] Alright#0419
we need to test the consensus rules themselves and the rpc errors interfere with that

[24-Nov-18 05:47 PM] KNOX#9338
merging changes

[24-Nov-18 05:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
and if there are merge conflicts, well, you still have conflicts
