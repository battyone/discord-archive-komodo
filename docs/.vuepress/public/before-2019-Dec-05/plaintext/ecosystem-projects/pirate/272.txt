Pirate (coin) as the champion of privacy should be associated with freedom, NOT secrets and shadows. I can afford to be open, welcoming if I am safe and secure. This is what Pirate means for me, not silliness like the 'pirate party' (google it), boats and treasure maps. They all have their place, but as the 'dibs and nibbles' to lighten the perception, NOT the centerpiece of the messaging.

sorry if that sounds a bit too esoteric

[05-Nov-18 09:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I am certain that the look we settle on will be great.  
I have shared the initial deck with two people and the general response has been positive.

I would not invite him to dinner to my house....

[05-Nov-18 09:30 PM] jansako#3330
maybe for a beer to the pub

[05-Nov-18 09:30 PM] jansako#3330
if you get the difference

[05-Nov-18 09:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The cool thing... is once we have colors and textures, everyone can go to town on their own stuff and still have it look very much pirate related.

[05-Nov-18 09:30 PM] jansako#3330
right, but colors, textures, forms, they all mean things

Piracy is not a crime.

[05-Nov-18 09:32 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
it's NOT theft

[05-Nov-18 09:32 PM] Zanzarismo#6500

Liberty by Privacy !

[05-Nov-18 09:35 PM] blubbi#0643
most people forgot about these days

[05-Nov-18 09:36 PM] akibebi#2853
When ‘piracy’ is defined well for us than we are good

[05-Nov-18 09:37 PM] akibebi#2853
@blubbi 
This is it for me: Liberty by Privacy
maybe Liberty (powered) by Privacy

[05-Nov-18 09:37 PM] blubbi#0643
when Liberty meets Privacy = Piracy

[05-Nov-18 09:37 PM] blubbi#0643
😄

[05-Nov-18 09:38 PM] jansako#3330
Yeah, thing is 'privacy' may not be a worthy goal by itself, maybe consider what having privacy secured allows us to do

[05-Nov-18 09:39 PM] blubbi#0643
Thats were Liberty drops in

[05-Nov-18 09:39 PM] jansako#3330
As a grand principle, yes.

[05-Nov-18 09:39 PM] blubbi#0643
people luve it 😄

[05-Nov-18 09:39 PM] jansako#3330
trouble is it could be a bit too 'distant',

[05-Nov-18 09:39 PM] blubbi#0643
and thats he connection to Pirate

[05-Nov-18 09:40 PM] blubbi#0643
get the liberty and Privacy point closer together

[05-Nov-18 09:40 PM] jansako#3330
what is a specific, hands-on benefit if being free?

[05-Nov-18 09:40 PM] jansako#3330
and does having privacy helps you accomplish that?

[05-Nov-18 09:41 PM] akibebi#2853
Liberty by Privacy is very great short slogan for me!!! 👍

[05-Nov-18 09:41 PM] blubbi#0643
isnt it what USA stands for, stood for, pardon and justify the whole civil order the last 200 years in most of the world

[05-Nov-18 09:42 PM] jansako#3330
like I said, it is a great 'grand principle', but how many Americans thing about that in their daily life, to use your point?

[05-Nov-18 09:43 PM] jansako#3330
@FishyGuts I hope you are whiteboarding this 😃

[05-Nov-18 09:45 PM] blubbi#0643
so i guess Liberty will be always a thing people searching for, now u need a connection to Privacy and fiat , how free is it to have a daily withdrawel at the bancomat, max cash payments etc. knowing ur banc balance, negativ (low) taxes,etc and why "Piracy" is the only true BC solution for it

[05-Nov-18 09:45 PM] jansako#3330
Sorry guys, gotta take off. was nice to stretch the ol' brain muscle for a bit!

in how many of those countries can you fly from 1 side to the other with $30k USD in a briefcase and a gallon of water, rent a car with no govt ID when you land, and park wherever you please in the "private property" parking lot of the store you're going to return the gallon of water to?

[05-Nov-18 09:51 PM] blubbi#0643
in Europe u can even fligh between countries without showing ur id for less than 20 bucks

[05-Nov-18 09:52 PM] akibebi#2853
lol

[05-Nov-18 09:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blubbi yes, but can you do so while carrying $30k USD and a gallon of water?

[05-Nov-18 09:53 PM] akibebi#2853
Why would i take 30k in a briefcase?!?! 
we are a crypto community, aren’t we?! lol

[05-Nov-18 09:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Why would i take 30k in a briefcase?!?! `
The fact that you can't is why many of us are in crypto 😉

sure the water and knife in the backpack were not a problem, dont know if the 30k will make the diffrence brow

Yes, I agree, @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 👍

`sure the water and knife in the backpack were not a problem` and what airline are you using? I need to switch

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  to my estimation 30 new buyers daily needed to keep the price stable. LEss then 30 new people daily - price dump, more price up.

anyway we need to mine people now, buyers especially, everyone got to become an antminer of buyers 😛

[05-Nov-18 10:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 buyers aren't actually the problem it's inverted "greed" that refuses to wait for buyers to move up and dumps for less than they actually think they are being greedy for 😣

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  price is created by both buyers and sellers equally. This is how market works in real life and virtual games too

[05-Nov-18 10:15 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it's like a basic nature of exchanging

[05-Nov-18 10:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085

Gotta grow the stash

[05-Nov-18 10:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Dumpers stashes will deplete.` Yeah, that's why I put greed in "", because it's so shortsighted that it actually lacks greed

[05-Nov-18 10:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
I can't even consider giving away 1k arrr for 200 bucks now when there's a high probability that it will be worth a lot more

[05-Nov-18 10:25 PM] mrlynch#5735
Any good ideas for cooling off asics? Getting a bit hot in the house :)) it's winter where i am and haven't turn the heating on at all
