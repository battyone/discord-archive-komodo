@TheCryptoMonk Wasn't $BTCP at $35 a few months back? 
We looked at their privacy protocol and it must be SUPER private because we couldn't find the privacy features that are actually useful.

Hi...any plans to use asic equihash-192 for asic resistance?

[12-Nov-18 12:25 AM] CiPhEr#2091
why would we care about asic resistance since we are dpow?

[12-Nov-18 12:28 AM] crumb#2550
you hit the nail on the head. dPoW is exactly the main reason why we should not worry about asic resistance.
