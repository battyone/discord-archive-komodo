[15-Oct-18 12:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You mean min conf for solo mining block rewards?

[15-Oct-18 12:09 PM] jandec30#8767
testing the Agama wallet by depositing few KMD coins and and it gave me 5%/12 rewards..

[15-Oct-18 12:09 PM] jandec30#8767
sorry.. new to the site and this is the only place to ask or be able to type in the question

[15-Oct-18 12:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, this is far from the right channel, but the answer is 1 second after the lock timestamp of the UTXO is the next time you can collect reward

[15-Oct-18 12:11 PM] jandec30#8767
thanks

[15-Oct-18 12:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
under a bajillion, though, collecting that soon is about pointless

@twistedmind the spreadsheet issue is one of privacy and accounting.    The whole reason is to not have that stuff In pirate so you have ultimate privacy with your finances.

[15-Oct-18 04:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Okay I will sell my alpha coins then. All of those 000000000000 PIRATE

[15-Oct-18 04:42 PM] snowdamn#2414
now if you could also convince them to add z-KMD deposits THAT WOULD BE GREAT

[15-Oct-18 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
over-paranoid much?

[15-Oct-18 04:43 PM] snowdamn#2414
nope, trying to increase z-KMD anon set 😉

[15-Oct-18 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
next you'll want z<->z atomic swaps

[15-Oct-18 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[15-Oct-18 04:43 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, THAT WOULD BE GREAT too

[15-Oct-18 04:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I bet z kmd deposit will be a premium feature

[15-Oct-18 04:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Exchange must have it

[15-Oct-18 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it would seem to me that if they can do pirate deposits then KMD,ZEC,etc z depostis should be no big deal

@CHMEX is this API yours? https://dexstats.info/api/pirateprice.php

[15-Oct-18 04:59 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes

[15-Oct-18 05:01 PM] CHMEX#0686
We are using the unlimited buy volume price of james as to avoid disappointed miners.

[15-Oct-18 05:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's not easy to use from the new TreasureChest gui wallet, because of  Access-Control-Allow-Origin

[15-Oct-18 05:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
it lacks that header

[15-Oct-18 05:03 PM] CHMEX#0686
can you try again

[15-Oct-18 05:03 PM] CHMEX#0686
header("Content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8");

[15-Oct-18 05:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX  ` Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` would allow any other website or nodeJS desktop app to hit the api

[15-Oct-18 05:04 PM] CHMEX#0686
I see let me read about that :S

[15-Oct-18 05:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
i will try again with your change, but i don't think it will work. it's CORS/same-origin policy stuff

[15-Oct-18 05:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you allow logged in users on the same domain, the header above is maybe not good

[15-Oct-18 05:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you don't allow logged in users on that domain, it's relatively safe

[15-Oct-18 05:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
i spent way too much of my life protecting elderly webapps from CSRF-attacks

[15-Oct-18 05:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, you can enable that header *just* on that single read-only URL, not the whole app

[15-Oct-18 05:06 PM] CHMEX#0686
So I added Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * to the header

[15-Oct-18 05:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think it did, now I have to fig a gui bug to see the data....
