Just don't dump like crazy. Stand your ground and up the price

[02-Nov-18 09:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
We have to drive this and create the need/hype

No one has listened to that advice in OTC for 3 weeks now 😣

[02-Nov-18 09:37 PM] mrlynch#5735
This project is too cool to be treated like a shitcoin

[02-Nov-18 09:37 PM] jansako#3330
because noone listens to that advice in general... or I should say there is 'always' some whale that does not...

[02-Nov-18 09:37 PM] mrlynch#5735
We are in a position to be the market makers. Between us early birds is the most of ARRR stash

[02-Nov-18 09:39 PM] FishyGuts#5085
There's a fine line between participation and manipulation.  Just be sure we are encouraging natural healthy trading 😃

I'm upping my hash rate now. And I will refuse to sell my ARRR at shitcoin prices. I've done the same mistake with bitcoin in 2010 when i sold my stash for $1 per coin only to kick myself in the nuts last year 😂

[02-Nov-18 09:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have set sell amounts all the way up from below where it's at now to above where I think it will be 24 hours from now.

someone changed me cannon loads 😕

[02-Nov-18 09:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Just to give volume and find a stable price.

[02-Nov-18 09:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
My intention is not to manipulate the market but to play it smart and not treat ARRR like a shitcoin

[02-Nov-18 09:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
LOL @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 we had it do splash damage now instead of additional cannonballs.

[02-Nov-18 09:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I agree @mrlynch and I wasn't inferring that you were, I apologize if it came off that way.

[02-Nov-18 09:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but I liked giving 50 to each ☹

[02-Nov-18 09:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have sells from .12 up to .5  All the low ones are gone.

[02-Nov-18 09:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
As I said the project is too cool and I'd love to see it be the next big thing. Full disclaimer, my stash is not that big, only a few Ks not 10s of Ks :D

[02-Nov-18 09:41 PM] iAmLedger#8530
What is the projected stable price?

[02-Nov-18 09:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We don't do that @iAmLedger

[02-Nov-18 09:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It will be what it will be.

[02-Nov-18 09:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That's up for the market and users to decide.

[02-Nov-18 09:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I think if we can get the trading post up and running within 3-6 months time, that the price will be healthy. 😃

[02-Nov-18 09:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
@FishyGuts no offence taken :) we're all adults. How's the leg btw?

[02-Nov-18 09:42 PM] iAmLedger#8530
Oh I apologize. I read your comment about volume and stable price so I was curious.

The lotto, the games and all the other items we're on should also help keep interest along the way.

[02-Nov-18 09:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I see @iAmLedger  - I was just talking about today.   Im probably dreaming though.  I only put less than .5 BTC worth of coins on there, and with deposits halted, that could go very fast.

[02-Nov-18 09:43 PM] iAmLedger#8530
I'm not trying to start any problems. If anything I'd like to do more to contribute to this project.

As to things the project could use.....

RIght now... if anyone knows a Shopify Paymnet Plugin Dev, that would be great.   I could start on that while the WooCommerce one is being done.

I think the comparison articles will go a long way for helping bring on new users and stabilize the price. @iAmLedger

[02-Nov-18 09:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
@FishyGuts you want to add ARRR payments to shopify?

[02-Nov-18 09:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I could search Git, but I am looking for a solid referral first.

[02-Nov-18 09:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes Mr Lynch, if we can.

[02-Nov-18 09:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
Or just a merch shop?

[02-Nov-18 09:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Shopify plugin for all shops.

[02-Nov-18 09:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
That would be so cool. I was thinking the other day of making myself a pirate shirt 😂

[02-Nov-18 09:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The WooCommerce one is about to start on dev coding.  Should not take more than a few weeks to a month (part time dev).

[02-Nov-18 09:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Vosk had some Pirate shirts for sale when he released his video.  I bought 2.

[02-Nov-18 09:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
Nice. Unfortunately my only experience with shopify did not involve coding 😂

[02-Nov-18 09:47 PM] iAmLedger#8530
@Cryptofist Mike good call. I will be sure to continue reposting and get the word out.

[02-Nov-18 09:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
I did see Vosk's vid. That's what got me into ARRR. Don't know if he ships to EU though 🤔

[02-Nov-18 09:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Cryptofist - @Flexatron really stepped up with that XVG article.  I think he did a perfect job to keep the bashing to zero and explain the projects from a tech/real world standpoiint.

What's shopify plugins coded in? I could ask some guys at work that do web dev if they're capable

[02-Nov-18 09:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The shirts aren't through him so they may send to you no problem.  Check it out on Teespring.

[02-Nov-18 09:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
I'll have a look thanks!

[02-Nov-18 09:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
L:ooks like I have to use.... Coinpayments, GoCoin or BitPay.

[02-Nov-18 09:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Don't see an option to add your own plugin so I will get with those three.

[02-Nov-18 09:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Cryptofist  - I won't get to that until tonight or tomorrow... if you wanted to reach out to them, that's a place to start 😃

[02-Nov-18 09:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
"How can we get accepted as a payment method on your platform?"   Z addr only support is important to mention.

[02-Nov-18 09:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
"contact us - send email"  If you want or can find time.

[02-Nov-18 09:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I will later this evening!

[02-Nov-18 09:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And if you can't, no worries, I can get to it tomrorow.  
I appreciate you offering to help with things like this 😃

[02-Nov-18 09:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
"We should have CoinMarketCap support soon" if asked about price api/reference.

[02-Nov-18 09:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And digital Price could always provide a plugin if needed.   SO yeah.  Thanks!

@twistedmind  - Are you talking of Sapling of Commerce portal?

[02-Nov-18 11:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The sapling integration isn't up to us, and 6 months (april is the latest it would be deployed).

[02-Nov-18 11:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
For the commerce portal... we can't just slap a wix site together and let people add links.  

Think silk road.   
The website has to have legal advice and council prior to creation.

[02-Nov-18 11:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
In addition, we have to finish the payment plugins as well as market to stores to get it in use.

[02-Nov-18 11:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Can shops start using the plugins in a month or so,  probably.   A new community member reached out today to help with new integrations on that front.

[02-Nov-18 11:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Will we have a fully operational Shopping portal in 30 days,  not that I know of, but I am not talking anything off the table.

@twistedmind At one time, one could say that Bittrex was just a BTC shill exchange and "i can fund that exchange on my own dust and still have more than it has."
