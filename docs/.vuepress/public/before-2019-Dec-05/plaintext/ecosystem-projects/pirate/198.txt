[20-Oct-18 10:25 PM] Cryptoboar#3557
I'm having trouble with the pool. I've been mining for 14 hours but have received no shares. Also, it should reflect that I have close to 30 KSol/s because I have 2 miners running at approx 15 KSol/s directed to the pool. Why does it show I only have 11.68 KSols/s?

[20-Oct-18 10:27 PM] Cryptoboar#3557
My wallet starts with zcX65

[20-Oct-18 10:32 PM] BlockTech#6895
It's showing you have 2 times 15Ksol/s and a balance of 62,59. You should get your first paiement in the next few hours i guess.

[20-Oct-18 10:33 PM] Llama#1330
yeah. minimum payout is 77.

@webworker01 Looks like you may be able to drop your fee soon,  the hashrate is splitting up.

{Reactions}
❓ 

[21-Oct-18 12:26 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We can use more split tho for pool ops to be less stressed.  Piratechain.org working right yet?  How about TheMiningPool?

[21-Oct-18 12:26 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I'm out for the night I think yall.  Have a good one and speak the pirate code far and wide!~

[21-Oct-18 04:23 AM] Friskerbiscuit#6036
I just started mining last night using piratepool.io and I am having trouble figuring  out the pool. I haven't found a way to  look up my miner stats/balance/payouts, tried looking up my address in worker stats but it does nothing, I can see my private address in the worker stats column with everyone elses and see that I am mining 12-18 KSol/s. Am I missing something here, how do I sign in, is there a way to see your current balance?

[21-Oct-18 04:25 AM] Llama#1330
@Friskerbiscuit you just click on your address in the column and it will show balance, and amount paid. There is no signing in or anything needed.

[21-Oct-18 04:30 AM] Friskerbiscuit#6036
I have tried that a few times for some reason it wont load my info its all blank

[21-Oct-18 04:32 AM] Llama#1330
what is your address?

[21-Oct-18 04:36 AM] Friskerbiscuit#6036

[21-Oct-18 04:37 AM] Llama#1330
all the stats should be there.

[21-Oct-18 04:43 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@sc38 the exchange is in testing.   There is no volume because pirate depostids and withdrawals are disabled . 😃

[21-Oct-18 04:44 AM] FishyGuts#5085
They should be up in a week or so +-

[21-Oct-18 04:49 AM] Friskerbiscuit#6036
It the same thing, where it says balance and paid it is still blank

[21-Oct-18 04:51 AM] Llama#1330
I don't know what the problem is. it shows up for me.

[21-Oct-18 05:03 AM] Friskerbiscuit#6036
Thanks for the help  ill keep checking back with it maybe it will show up

[21-Oct-18 05:11 AM] Friskerbiscuit#6036

guys which pool do you mining (arrr.pool-mining.xyz or piratepool.io)?

[21-Oct-18 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_mines solo 😎_

[21-Oct-18 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
there are a few new pools that need hashrate

[21-Oct-18 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_recommends selecting the pool that you trust with the lowest hashrate_

Lets talk about how there is a point where mining becomes unprofitable

[21-Oct-18 01:55 PM] kaks#6612
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  for getting more reward?

[21-Oct-18 01:55 PM] Llama#1330
Like renting 30msols

[21-Oct-18 01:55 PM] Llama#1330
Or 50 lol

[21-Oct-18 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I get 1% more solo mining than mining in a pool that has a 1% fee

[21-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Llama#1330
I use arrr.mining-pool

[21-Oct-18 01:56 PM] kaks#6612
any pool reccomends?

[21-Oct-18 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Llama it's far too much of a blanket statement to pick a random number out of thin air and say renting xMsols is "unprofitable"
