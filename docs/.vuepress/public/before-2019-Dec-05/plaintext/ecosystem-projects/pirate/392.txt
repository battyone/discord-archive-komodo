[dscrd-prt] <Tek> you might not even be able to cash out

[13-Nov-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> if its btc

[13-Nov-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> and it gets stuck during the next bullryn

[13-Nov-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ üë¥üèºüì¢ then let's make a pirate chip wallet

[13-Nov-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> cause blocks are full

[13-Nov-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Make it look like a casino chip, with a small LED touch screen and a camera on the back, so that it can scan QR codes

[13-Nov-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Prolly around the size of a smart watch screen

[13-Nov-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> I can raw it into a block, that's the ez part
syncing that feken chain on 10MB download speed sucks ass

[13-Nov-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Open source the design

[13-Nov-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Or they can just download the mobile wallet üòÇüòÇüòÇ

[13-Nov-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> sure because why would I want custody of my currency?

[13-Nov-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Unless you plan to expand your casino all over the world I don't see the benefit of using something decentralized like blockchain for payments. You could use the CEX way: deposit onto your local blockchain (available on all local devices), let the customer use that and when he leaves withdraw the remaining balance (or leave it for the next visit).
All you need to do then is create an easy-access system (chipcard, RFID-chip or something similar) for easy use on the premesis.

[13-Nov-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> sounds like LN to me üò¶

[13-Nov-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> :troll:

[13-Nov-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> I think the gambling computer should just have a scanner that scans your QR Code to cash out

[13-Nov-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> No need to use an ATM or anything else you can purchase crypto and put it into your mobile wallet

[13-Nov-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> I'm thinking a computer that looks similar to am arcade console, custom build, steel chassis

[13-Nov-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Think about it, you already got pirate in your mobile wallet, you scan the screen on the machine, send your payment, the machine loads with the balance, and when you want to cash out, the machine scans the QR on your phone... literally nothing has to be developed except the blackjack application

[13-Nov-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> So it's basically depositing ARRR for use in the store/casino... High level of trust involved... As soon as one deposits, that person doesn't own the balance (not your keys, not your coins).

[13-Nov-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Yeah, it's a casino? What do you think happens when you put $100 into a slot machine

[13-Nov-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Would you prefer plugging your private key into the computer?

[13-Nov-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> When I gamble with the MBit casino, I have a wallet there, but I dont own that key

[13-Nov-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> I would prefer a multi-sig option. the slot machine cannot withdraw without the customers approval.

[13-Nov-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> I'm not a developer I just have ideas If you have a better idea....

[13-Nov-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `I would prefer a multi-sig option. the slot machine cannot withdraw with the customers approval.`
the downside to that is you can still lose all custody it the casino folds and the op just says "fek it, I don't care any more"

[13-Nov-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <CHMEX> but I believe with ztrx you can't do multiseig (yet; ever?)

[13-Nov-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> True. The multisig should not be on the casino system, but on the external customers wallet. Only withdrawing when placing a bet

[13-Nov-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Sooo maybe a physical wallet, you insert it into a box and flip a switch activating the rfid, and the signal can only travel from within the machine

[13-Nov-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> That way, your crypto stays in your physical wallet but at the same time doesn't physically have to be plugged into the computer compromising the system

[13-Nov-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> not sure @CHMEX outside of 3 situations, I've never done multi ü§∑üèΩ

[13-Nov-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> When you gamble say 1 coin, that 1 coin is removed from your wallet in real time

[13-Nov-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> If you lose it's gone, if you win, your wallet is updated with the new balance

[13-Nov-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `If you lose it's gone, if you win, your wallet is updated with the new balance`
sounds just about like kmdice CC

[13-Nov-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> You'ld need a chain with short blocktimes... when gambling the house doesn't want 1 minute between each bet

[13-Nov-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> When your done, click a button the box opens, physical wallet is released

[13-Nov-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <CHMEX> discordapp.com/channels/512188534111862784/512194717706878977/529356292721213460

[13-Nov-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <CHMEX> no msif for zaddr... for now

[13-Nov-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Turn the switch on the physical wallet shut off the rfid, and remove it from the machine

[13-Nov-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> if *I* were to do such a thing, CC is how I'd go

[13-Nov-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> but no CCs on pirate either (*currently, not sure about in future)

[13-Nov-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Giving the RFID a kill switch and having the gambling machine have an insulated box is a good idea cmon

[13-Nov-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> It's like those charging stations at the mall, you put your phone in a box

[13-Nov-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Put your physical wallet in the box, switch on the rfid

[13-Nov-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Then your players card will unlock the box and return your wallet to you

[13-Nov-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> CG, afaik there are efforts to bring ARRR to atomicDEX. That would incolve CCs. So I'm confident CCs will come to Pirate

[13-Nov-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> @BlackMarket let me know when you install one of those boxes in the county of 16k people I live in üëçüèΩ

[13-Nov-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> üòÇüòÇüòÇ

[13-Nov-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <t0sma> Hello, how many ARRR is needed for AtomicDex implementation ?

[13-Nov-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Dont hate the player hate the game

[13-Nov-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> In theory it can be done right

[13-Nov-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <t0sma> I will make a little donation in order to contribute

[13-Nov-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @t0sma the target bounty is 150k, what's extra will be given as a bonus to maybe speed things up

[13-Nov-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Were talking a metallic box with a magnetic lock

[13-Nov-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> I can easily weld that

[13-Nov-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> And wire it

[13-Nov-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @t0sma thank you for your contribution

[13-Nov-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `Dont hate the player hate the game`
my point was to point out to you that there are limitations to physical devices like that (specifically that you will exclude 90% of the world's population just by geography alone)

[13-Nov-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Similar to a safe, it will have locking pins, it will be insulated so the RFID signal cant travel outside the box

[13-Nov-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Or maybe the QR scanner is a better idea :-P

[13-Nov-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> what's my incentive to buy your device to play your game?

[13-Nov-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Any time you give the casino your money and hold chips you forfeit the ownership of that money for worthless chips anyway

[13-Nov-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> I'm not trying to sell anything I would open source the design

[13-Nov-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> I just wanna get around state laws and have blackjack in my night club

[13-Nov-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `Or maybe the QR scanner is a better idea`
`I'm not trying to sell anything I would open source the design`
So, you're sending out free scanners?

[13-Nov-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> No a blueprint

[13-Nov-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Open sourcing a design doesn't mean it's free hardware lol

[13-Nov-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `No a blueprint`
so I have to travel 200 miles to buy electronics to play your game?

[13-Nov-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> But it won't be available for everyone, you gotta call me and ask for it

[13-Nov-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <t0sma> waiting my wallet is full synchronized and i will donate. I will be really good to see ARRR on atomicdex. Good for Arrr and also for KMD

[13-Nov-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> I'm building an arcade console

[13-Nov-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> I would be walking around in your Casino with a QR-scanner and siphon away a lot of funds from your careless customers. QR is not a good idea IMO

[13-Nov-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> That's the idea at least

[13-Nov-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Yeah maybe the box is a better idea

[13-Nov-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Lockbox that holds the physical wallet

[13-Nov-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `I'm building an arcade console`
I own (without exaggeration) 40 PCs, what's my incentive for wanting to build your thing?

[13-Nov-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Or even a slot where you insert the wallet, and the chip slides in

[13-Nov-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> And then machine holds the chip till your done

[13-Nov-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> You mentioned RFID. How do you protect the RFID chip when it's not inserted into the machine. You would need a Faraday cage around the chip once it is outside the box.

[13-Nov-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ üë¥üèºüì¢ no incentive to build it whatsoever, I get $0 why would I care if you build one?

[13-Nov-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> then why would one want to play your casino?

[13-Nov-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Because people like to get drunk and gamble?

[13-Nov-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> If you build it they will come

[13-Nov-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <t0sma> can you confirm that this address is for donation zs1zcvuz4gf826yp8trncj9l86a6xracrf2jk8lwz5v6xz7zntgmgahwrxw9rxu9jtthscex4aanpe

[13-Nov-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <t0sma> ?

[13-Nov-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> @ùôäùôûùô£ùô† no the physical wallet would have a kill switch that closes the circuit to the RFID chip, or alternatively the RFID would be modular in design so that it can be removed

[13-Nov-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `Because people like to get drunk and gamble?`
true, but how many also like to travel to electronic stores, buy random parts, travel back home, and build something out of those parts just to do so?

[13-Nov-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ üë¥üèºüì¢ so your saying you want to play it but you dont wanna drive to colorado or build one yourself

[13-Nov-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> So that you'll never play it üòÇ

[13-Nov-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763

[13-Nov-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Me too, that's why I don't gamble... LOL

[13-Nov-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> The house always wins

[13-Nov-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> If your on the other end, your always making money, especially if its video blackjack

[13-Nov-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> I like money too, so I can't see why I'd spend it on building something to play were the odds are that I'd lose more on top of the cost of manually building a device that's essentually a guarantee to lose me money
