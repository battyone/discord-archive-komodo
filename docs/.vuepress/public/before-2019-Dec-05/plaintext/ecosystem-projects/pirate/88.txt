hrrrmmm... I tried to install Agama on a fresh laptop- buuuut since it is fresh it does not have the needed ia32 libs for a 64bit system, and a forgot again which ones those were

[29-Sep-18 12:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[29-Sep-18 12:12 PM] LocoMB#8593
it is buried somewhere in github, ut it is a pain in the ass digging it up each time

[29-Sep-18 12:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only I can drink 24 oz of espresso and need a nap 😦

[29-Sep-18 12:13 PM] ch6ris#5240
i usually have a coffee right before bed. no problem.

looks like the hw upgrade i gave to the pool server was good for pretty much exactly 24hrs... insanity at its best 🤣

[29-Sep-18 12:24 PM] 0x03#8822
from the admins point of view that means 100% growth in 24hr

[29-Sep-18 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you should add a pool fee

[29-Sep-18 12:31 PM] LocoMB#8593
hm - the issue with Agama not displaying Pirate and several other coins seems to not have to do with the instzallation- I just made a fresh install on a new maching, but still same problem

[29-Sep-18 12:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
tried portable of agama 42c ?

[29-Sep-18 12:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
move or backup your Komodo Data folder

[29-Sep-18 12:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
use portable agama

[29-Sep-18 12:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it should work

[29-Sep-18 12:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
will resync your blockchain but should work

[29-Sep-18 12:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

@LocoMB  please help to resync your pirate chain from scratch, this will solve most of the issues

[29-Sep-18 02:25 PM] bishop#9773
There's no way to cancel an operation and try to batch in smaller sizes right? I just have to wait this thing out....

[29-Sep-18 02:25 PM] bishop#9773
absolute insanity

[29-Sep-18 02:26 PM] bishop#9773
guessing too many notes

[29-Sep-18 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've never been brave enough to try, but in theory if you kill the daemon before it completes there's no actual tx made (i'd suggest doing `zapwallettxes` on startup though)

[29-Sep-18 02:28 PM] bishop#9773
I'm at the crossroads where I've already given this one just over an hour so trying to figure it out if it is best to stop now or just let it ride.

[29-Sep-18 02:29 PM] bishop#9773
Serves me right for not batching as I was going

[29-Sep-18 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ffs, how many txes are you trying to merge?

[29-Sep-18 02:29 PM] bishop#9773
I haven't the faintest idea, lol

[29-Sep-18 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[29-Sep-18 02:30 PM] bishop#9773
just ran z_mergetoaddress *

[29-Sep-18 02:30 PM] bishop#9773
lets just say it has been accumulating for a while

[29-Sep-18 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you didn't use a literal `*`, did you?

[29-Sep-18 02:31 PM] bishop#9773
no

[29-Sep-18 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

z_mergetoaddress '["*"]' zaddr

[29-Sep-18 02:33 PM] bishop#9773
More interested at this point to see how long it takes. Figured it would have errored out by now if it couldn't handle the notes

[29-Sep-18 02:38 PM] Flexatron#8809
