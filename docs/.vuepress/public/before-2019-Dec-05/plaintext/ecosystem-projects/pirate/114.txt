Hard to tell honestly

[05-Oct-18 12:04 AM] Dr Debt#0891
I plan on mining continually until it’s no longer profitable to do so

[05-Oct-18 12:05 AM] FishyGuts#5085
That’s gonna be forever?

[05-Oct-18 12:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, stop doing that, I need mawr coinage

[05-Oct-18 12:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
😂

[05-Oct-18 12:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@FishyGuts One has to bear in mind that "profitable" means different things to different people
At ambient outside temps under 90F, I'm still running my S7s because $1 a day is $1 a day more than I had yesterday

[05-Oct-18 12:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Hehe yep.  I agree.

[05-Oct-18 12:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I am in the same boat.

[05-Oct-18 12:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a "free" mini every 2 months out of a dozen S7s
all one has to do is not get "sticker shock" by the costs

[05-Oct-18 12:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I admit, I almost stopped mining when I got my first 1,000 electric bill.

[05-Oct-18 01:28 AM] Dr Debt#0891
yeah that can be detrimental to your ambitions.

[05-Oct-18 01:35 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Which release of agama has pirate

[05-Oct-18 01:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[05-Oct-18 01:36 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I'll even send you Pirate if you send me your zaddr 😃

[05-Oct-18 01:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
That’s why I didn’t want to make any promises 😉

[05-Oct-18 01:36 AM] FishyGuts#5085
No promises needed.   Just have fun.  I don't want you to miss this boat.

[05-Oct-18 01:36 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The meme potential is endless.

[05-Oct-18 01:37 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I think you should create a twitter account as a deckhand and mess with the captain

[05-Oct-18 01:37 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Shit I already missed the boat

[05-Oct-18 01:37 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Everyone can have an alter ego pirate twitter account to interact with @PirateChain

[05-Oct-18 01:37 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I got you man.  Get that wallet address, DM me and Ill send you some Pirate!

[05-Oct-18 01:37 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I remember satinder buying for .015 KMD :abusedsmily:

[05-Oct-18 01:39 AM] Alright#0419
was that while he was telling people not to buy on twitter and BCT?

[05-Oct-18 01:39 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fuck if I know

[05-Oct-18 01:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Back when I was like “I thought that was a fucking test coin?”

[05-Oct-18 01:40 AM] Alright#0419
because it was

[05-Oct-18 01:40 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Everything starts as a test coin

[05-Oct-18 01:40 AM] Alright#0419
and at some point someone thought to themselves "wow, I have a lot of this. We should call this a real coin instead"

[05-Oct-18 01:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Well it’s not legit because I wasn’t here at the very beginning

[05-Oct-18 01:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
:abusedsmily:

[05-Oct-18 01:41 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I'm pretty sure that isn't the reason 😄

[05-Oct-18 01:41 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The fact that it is more private than XMR and more secure too probably has something to do with why it went live. :trollface:

[05-Oct-18 01:41 AM] house#8741
I'll pitch in also ... fuck hollow ... why you miss boat

[05-Oct-18 01:42 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We should make PIZZA a real coin if that's the case... I have an assload.

[05-Oct-18 01:42 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I tried to let Hollow know last week 😃

[05-Oct-18 01:42 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
ComputerGenie is ahab

[05-Oct-18 01:42 AM] FishyGuts#5085
He was "busy"  life or something

[05-Oct-18 01:43 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fucking kids

[05-Oct-18 01:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`We should make PIZZA a real coin if that's the case... I have an assload.`
Or people could stop being whiny bitches about loosing less on a rental than the prize was for testing PIZZA

We were a channel of love earlier.  You would have vomited @Hollowman9000

[05-Oct-18 01:49 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Well agama is trying to do its thing

[05-Oct-18 01:51 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Wish my zaddr had Pir4tes in it 😂

[05-Oct-18 01:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
You can start any coin in native or lite and then you have to activate Pirate as native once it starts @Hollowman9000

[05-Oct-18 01:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We also have a giveaway right now wehre you can get 77.7 pirate for free.

Pinned tweet on @piratechain twitter.

[05-Oct-18 01:53 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Be back later all.

[05-Oct-18 01:56 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[05-Oct-18 01:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Wish my zaddr had Pir4tes in it`
For 200k KMD each I'll make you however many you want

[05-Oct-18 02:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Speaking of... 

I have a 10,000 PIRATE bounty on the vanity address.  If you can prove to me its you and you shield those funds, I will send you 10K pirate.  

The value of the coin and its shielded coinbase will be better that way anyhow.  It's best for the project.  

Currently 85% of circulating supply is shielded.  
It goes over 98% when that address shields.

[05-Oct-18 02:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a bounty of less than 1% of their wallet isn't likely to be a motivator

[05-Oct-18 02:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I can't afford more.
Hopefully the value of the shielded coinbase means more than the vanity to that person.  

Perhaps we can parlay a deal... Keep 1 PIRATE over the #2 address.

[05-Oct-18 02:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So you can still show up as #1 on the richlist

[05-Oct-18 02:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
That's 2500 KMD for free basically.

[05-Oct-18 02:09 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
So there is 1,000,000 mined pirate still in the t address

[05-Oct-18 02:10 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
They can’t go anywhere but z

[05-Oct-18 02:10 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
What’s it hurt

[05-Oct-18 02:10 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Optics?

[05-Oct-18 02:10 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
“Holy shit they have 1MM”?

[05-Oct-18 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And people were yelling at me about my 100k in T addr... I still got 79K there... I will be very happy if that PIRATE with 1 million sheilds his then I will be number 1 on rich list :trollface:

[05-Oct-18 02:22 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Within 7-8 months that address will be only like 1% or less .  I don't think it's much to worry about.

[05-Oct-18 02:33 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
I am confused as to why we are actively trying to discover the identity of a use r on a chain that is  based on anonymity?  I mean, I get it...would be great for stats to have the highest percentage of shielded coins, but doesn't it go against some ideals?

[05-Oct-18 02:38 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
True, they are in a T addr and is going to catch attention. I just dont see why there is a bounty to uncover this peach

lol

[05-Oct-18 02:40 AM] house#8741
It is not a matter of discovering identity, it is a matter of disappearing the large wallet so that new pirates do not see an address that could potentially dump on the market at any time in the not so distant future

[05-Oct-18 02:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
So you prefer unsuspecting victims :trollface:

[05-Oct-18 02:41 AM] house#8741
it psyco thing

[05-Oct-18 02:41 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
I get it, I just suppose I have a different idea of what Pirate was suppose to be about. Its always interesting to see what a collaberative approac from many different types creates

[05-Oct-18 02:42 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
thats what makes things great, different opinions

[05-Oct-18 02:42 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
that and the monkey stealing a peach graphic

[05-Oct-18 02:42 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
phuckin great man, I loled

[05-Oct-18 02:42 AM] house#8741
I doubt it is anything of major importance ... just a tweek

[05-Oct-18 02:43 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
you talkin about the monkey or the peach?

[05-Oct-18 02:43 AM] house#8741
hehe

`it is a matter of disappearing the large wallet so that new pirates do not see an address that could potentially dump on the market at any time in the not so distant future`
If 7% of the supply moving scares you, then crypto might not be the thing for you

You’re all wrong.

[05-Oct-18 02:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It’s about the shielding being stronger with more funds shielded.

{Reactions}
👆🏼 

[05-Oct-18 02:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
All funds are mixed together and it becomes 1000000 pirate harder to determine your transactional identity.

[05-Oct-18 02:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
exactly the *only* reason anyone should care

Well, two boys under 4, that counts

[05-Oct-18 03:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It’s a principle thing.    I could care less if they do... it’s just for the strength of the privacy and nothin else. 😃

[05-Oct-18 03:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
This is not a manhunt thing.   It’s the Person DMing me with a screenshot of the transfer..... and they can even do it from a discord throwaway.

[05-Oct-18 03:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Sorry for any confusion folks. 😃

[05-Oct-18 03:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
