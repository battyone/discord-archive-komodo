Isn't that how dPoW works?

[29-Sep-18 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` build onto a block (by referencing it in blocks they create) if it is the latest block in the longest valid chain. "Length" is calculated as total combined difficulty of that chain, not number of blocks, though this distinction is only important in the context of a few potential attacks. A chain is valid if all of the blocks and transactions within it are valid, and only if it starts with the genesis block. `
Because, Bitcoin

Hello guys. When I try to move my funds I got this: "witness for note commitment is null". Do you know why?

[29-Sep-18 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
@FishyGuts this hardfork activated dPoW, before it, there was no dPoW so blocks were subject to being reorged at anytime

[29-Sep-18 03:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I see.  I was giving Alright some crap about it briefly the other day too.   He's just having fun griping I think.

[29-Sep-18 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, he's not having fun, it cost him a good chunk of change out of his poket

[29-Sep-18 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but, that's the risk we miners take

@doc_bitcoin @RealCryptoLlama @lopp That's where many PIRATES around the world mine our chain for their privacy.  Where do you mine for your privacy?

block #44065 contains transparent address, normal ?  http://pirate.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/a166b147992d2b3e5e10a74c7e7edff71eacdbc6d28946ef9f2653645901c5c4

[29-Sep-18 03:55 PM] Llama#1330
i think pirate is mined into a transparent address. idk if that has anything to do with it.

Who do I give my chicken to get post an order on the *google* spreadsheet

[29-Sep-18 04:17 PM] wookie#7663
I think the spreadsheet defeats the purpose of privacy...to quote jl777 "It wont be possible to make a mistake to lose the PIRATE privacy, unless you are announcing publicly to the world"

[29-Sep-18 04:20 PM] Llama#1330
its the exact same as using the discord to announce trades @wookie

[29-Sep-18 04:21 PM] snowdamn#2414
guys, the spreadsheet doesn't make sense as an orderbook for many reasons, but don't worry about privacy, it's the z-txid that should NEVER be posted anywhere, Discord is no better

[29-Sep-18 04:21 PM] Alright#0419
"don't worry about privacy"

[29-Sep-18 04:22 PM] Alright#0419
😐

[29-Sep-18 04:22 PM] Alright#0419
the txid isn't even what matters btw

[29-Sep-18 04:22 PM] Alright#0419
post your txids, they don't mean anything

[29-Sep-18 04:22 PM] Llama#1330
there's no difference between posting your trade in the #talk-trading channel and having the trade listed on the sheet

[29-Sep-18 04:22 PM] Llama#1330
unless for some reason you hate organization

[29-Sep-18 04:22 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, no z-txid on spreasheet, so no privacy issues, at least not anything worst than posting on Discord

[29-Sep-18 04:23 PM] Llama#1330
and the only people who would ever see that spreadsheet are the same people that would see your offers in the discord

[29-Sep-18 04:23 PM] Alright#0419
well if someone says, just sold for X amount for Y KMD

[29-Sep-18 04:23 PM] Alright#0419
and at the same moment, there is a KMD transaction with Y KMD

[29-Sep-18 04:23 PM] Alright#0419
🤔

[29-Sep-18 04:24 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, never buy PIRATE with KMD, always buy with z-KMD...

[29-Sep-18 04:25 PM] wookie#7663
@Llama I see your point

[29-Sep-18 04:27 PM] Llama#1330
but i deleted it cause i guess everyone hated it

Selling 3000 PIRATE @ 0.125 KMD or 1.05 VRSC
Order sizes starting at 100 PIRATE
PM if interested, thank you!
-------------------

[29-Sep-18 04:28 PM] snowdamn#2414
was good educational lesson for all
if i was a seller, i would only accept z-KMD

[29-Sep-18 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe a different price for KMD vs zKMD?

[29-Sep-18 04:31 PM] snowdamn#2414
now that would be something to scratch your head about
