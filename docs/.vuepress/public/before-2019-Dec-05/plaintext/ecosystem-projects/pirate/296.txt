[10-Nov-18 06:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
i've read that

[10-Nov-18 06:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
so... basically the solution to it is use ONLY fully-shielded tx's

[10-Nov-18 06:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
which Pirate already does 🤔

[10-Nov-18 06:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
or am I wrong?

[10-Nov-18 06:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
i think that too

[10-Nov-18 06:48 PM] plazma#1625
Very worrysome

[10-Nov-18 06:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
indeed

Hey all, new here. Are there any mining pools for Pirate

[10-Nov-18 06:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
the only weak link would be the tx between the pool and the z address (applied to miners) which can be sort of mitigated by moving your mining proceeds to a secondary z address and smooth sailing from there. correct?

Mining - Pirate Chain (ARRR)
PIRATE (ARRR) uses Equihash mining algorithm and can be mined using GPU and ASIC – Block time: Aprox 60 seconds – – Block Reward: 256 PIRATE (ARRR) – – Block reward halves: every 388885 blocks – every 270 days) – – Block reward of 1 satoshi will be reached ...

[10-Nov-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
well this level of metadata was mostly deducible from tx size before sapling

[10-Nov-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
knowing that a pool sent out payments identifies that tx as a pool payment

[10-Nov-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so?

[10-Nov-18 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
there are no destination addresses on the blockchain

[10-Nov-18 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
just a bunch of encypted data

[10-Nov-18 06:53 PM] mrlynch#5735
tx's are safu

[10-Nov-18 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
since you cant know the amount used for inputs or know the total amount sent, does it really matter if you know that there were N inputs and Y outputs?

[10-Nov-18 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly if you use a specific type of output, like 54 payments for a pool, then the information that the pool made a payment is known

[10-Nov-18 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
but I think we kind of already knew that

[10-Nov-18 06:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the important thing to remember is that the actual amounts are fully encrypted

[10-Nov-18 06:55 PM] jl777c#5810
so is the source address

[10-Nov-18 06:55 PM] jl777c#5810
so is the destination address

[10-Nov-18 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
we can deduce that someone sent funds from some place to another place, using 3 inputs and 7 outputs

[10-Nov-18 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
and the code will default to using 2 outputs as a standard, so most tx will have 2 outputs

[10-Nov-18 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
in a way the number of inputs could leak a bit of info about the approx size

[10-Nov-18 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
but people who merged their outputs would then convey false info

[10-Nov-18 06:57 PM] jl777c#5810
and if the standard merge is 10 inputs to 2 outputs, then it can be seen that somebody did a merge

[10-Nov-18 06:57 PM] mrlynch#5735
@jl777c sorry to hijack you, but... what's the komodo-cli command to see details based on opid? i'm trying to move funds from one zc address to another just to better track my mining proceeds and it's been a while since it's been in processing in agama

[10-Nov-18 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
in any case, all this info was deducible before, it is just now visible in the rpc output

[10-Nov-18 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
z_getoperationstatus

[10-Nov-18 06:58 PM] mrlynch#5735
cool.. thanks!

[10-Nov-18 06:59 PM] mrlynch#5735
lol, just as i was about to type it went through

[10-Nov-18 07:02 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
FUD will be - there is still some info = someone did a transaction -> it's bad anon tech :trollface:

[10-Nov-18 07:03 PM] plazma#1625
Now more worrysome

[10-Nov-18 07:03 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Now or no ? :trollface:

[10-Nov-18 07:04 PM] plazma#1625
Lol

[10-Nov-18 07:04 PM] plazma#1625
I think old zaddress use should not be ban

[10-Nov-18 07:05 PM] plazma#1625
Just for safety

[10-Nov-18 07:06 PM] Flexatron#8809
Thanks for stepping in James

[10-Nov-18 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
a 0.0001 utxo is the same size as a 100,000 PIRATE utxo

[10-Nov-18 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so really how much info is leaked that someone somewhere did a tx with 3 inputs and 2 outputs

[10-Nov-18 07:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
now... when do pirates get sapling? 😄

[10-Nov-18 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

hi i have a problem when try to send from agama

@plazma if you dont understand the tech your only choice is to believe someone who understands it (can code on such level). If you cant trust such person then better not to use that tech at all and forget about it. This is the only choice you got.

@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 oh boy zk snark r one heck of a thing, it takes time to master it

[10-Nov-18 07:38 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@jl777c  I think would be good for alle the people on this planet if you published your comments/summary/final judge on software changes (good or bad) on steemit and make it public to all

[10-Nov-18 07:38 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
no-coders and other people don't have to understand the tech (will never do most probably) just enough people know what to think based on authority in the area

[10-Nov-18 07:39 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
here in discord it will be flooded with posts and disappear / your typing wasted

[10-Nov-18 07:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622

[10-Nov-18 07:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
There is an interview I am doing and the questions pertains to the End User Experience....
Any ideas you have are welcome.  
I have my own answers but I am curious since Pirate ourselves won't be the only ones creating value with these parameters set forth.
What kind of answers might you guys report to the following questions.

How will the man on the street experience/use PIRATE CHAIN?
How will ordinary shop owners & small businesses?
How will government bodies and large corporations?
How will the crypto investor?
