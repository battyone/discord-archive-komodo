[05-Sep-18 08:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
unfortunately because I was traveling and family stuff I was getting fraction of day time to do some stuff. didn't do much good with BTT updates etc.

[05-Sep-18 08:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, things go so quickly here.

[05-Sep-18 08:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep

[05-Sep-18 08:14 AM] CrisF#3405
This is why I like this place so much.  
It's not just skills and knowledge.  People here have character. And passion.
I believe this misunderstanding shows that very clearly.  It's all over, in the channel above.
Get someone from #komodo-team  to show others this and everyone who is willing will benefit.

you need to find the person who is nicehashing it or try @Alright  if he is sellig any more.

[05-Sep-18 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but as the chain is private, that may be quite hard üòÑ

[05-Sep-18 09:16 AM] xoso#1057
ok

great. depending on how many people will participate in airdrop, we can make a new ANN

[05-Sep-18 09:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
ok

[05-Sep-18 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
someone should start an escrow service while this is not on CEX

[05-Sep-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As those 250k are in my address, @jorian can you please just let me know the sendmany command and I will send them when it is time, as I use that address and dont want to give out the private key.

[05-Sep-18 09:52 AM] jorian#4555

who else is selling pirate?

[05-Sep-18 11:10 AM] CrisF#3405
20 minutes is a long time!  It usually takes me a few minutes + confirmation wait.  Even `z_mergetoaddress`  or `z_sendmany` have been a 5 min max for me so far.
Not sure about load spreading.  Hope so, then more z_transactions üòÉ

[05-Sep-18 11:11 AM] CrisF#3405
How many transactions are there, 100s?!

[05-Sep-18 11:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, that's a lot.  I did a `z_mergetoaddress` with 67 addresses, mostly having tiny amounts and that one took a few minutes.

[05-Sep-18 11:47 AM] CrisF#3405
That command with the `*` saved me sooo much copy and pasting!!

[05-Sep-18 11:47 AM] CrisF#3405
I image that must be using a lot of cpu!

Huh, this seems like a fun idea. May try mining some.

[06-Sep-18 03:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@webworker01 do you push pool payments or those are on demand by user request on pool account?

[06-Sep-18 03:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
How much a user has to mine to get payment?

[06-Sep-18 03:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
