Oh well if this turns to be 1:10 of xmr value in the future I’m gonna be a very happy person 😂

[28-Sep-18 12:07 AM] Buddz1993#5380
What market cap would that give us ??

[28-Sep-18 12:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i'll keep saying this... if someone makes a darknet market with this coin... there is no limit on how high the price can go.

... don't get me started just got into a huge argument on fb community group over private police force,  they are trying to raise taxes in the community .

[28-Sep-18 12:19 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Why pay a bunch  to a group of people that do nothing but harass,  if you want police then you can pay if not then don't,  hate in being enforced

[28-Sep-18 12:19 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It

[28-Sep-18 12:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I like that idea

[28-Sep-18 12:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
What you need is pirate cops

[28-Sep-18 12:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are already pirates

[28-Sep-18 12:19 AM] snowdamn#2414
wait for the payback, when they don't have any dough left to pay the taxes, the private police will break down their doors 😀

[28-Sep-18 12:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
Yeah civil asset forfeiture is rampant. Got a stack of cash in your car? Thats suspicious. I’ll just take that.

[28-Sep-18 12:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Here I have been trying to get every single person to challenge every fine, speeding, street drinking, littering, whatever they give you, in court. If everyone did that, revenue raisingf would halt overnight.

[28-Sep-18 12:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In Australia, they dont really seize property, they just harrass ppl with meaningless fines

[28-Sep-18 12:21 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I don't think many local police will be able to get my pirate :pirate:

this is why we need things like PIRATE

[28-Sep-18 12:24 AM] actionslacks#4072
Thats nuts, well they keep pushing... they’re gonna push too far.

at this diff, yes a little better than 1 block a day seems about right for 2 minis

[28-Sep-18 12:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I remeber when 2 minis got 70% of the blocks in a day 😂

[28-Sep-18 12:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
suffice to say it didnt last more than a day

[28-Sep-18 12:33 AM] matt#3084
so about $30 /day.. better than mining zcash .. wonder if it'll hold..

[28-Sep-18 12:34 AM] matt#3084
@blackjok3r   yeah thats some luck there!

[28-Sep-18 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to be fair the coin was a day old

[28-Sep-18 12:34 AM] matt#3084
right on, thats how u make bank.

[28-Sep-18 12:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_mined 5 blocks back then and turned the coin off 😭_

[28-Sep-18 12:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[28-Sep-18 12:36 AM] matt#3084
are there any plans to list this on an exchange?

#deleted-channel

[28-Sep-18 12:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they are working on a privacy exchange just for it

[28-Sep-18 12:36 AM] matt#3084
do u know max supply value?

[28-Sep-18 12:37 AM] cHOPE#9228
why not tradeogre.com?

[28-Sep-18 12:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
math

[28-Sep-18 12:37 AM] matt#3084
i think I'll mine until it halves..

[28-Sep-18 12:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
blocks * rewards = supply

[28-Sep-18 12:38 AM] matt#3084
oh not max cirulating. .the max num of mined that will be allowed

[28-Sep-18 12:38 AM] matt#3084
unless there is no cap

[28-Sep-18 12:38 AM] snowdamn#2414
tortuga is the coinflip! 😉

[28-Sep-18 12:38 AM] matt#3084
supply is 10.6 million now..

[28-Sep-18 12:38 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The problem with 3rd party exchange listings is that they have to accept zdeposits and send z transactions ,  most aren't equipped for such

[28-Sep-18 12:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's halvings and that math gets added up = total ever

[28-Sep-18 12:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if an exchange has high volume of withdrawals.... even SHossains Alein server would struggle

[28-Sep-18 12:39 AM] matt#3084
oh I can just read.. Total supply of around 200 million PIRATE  -- https://pirate.black/   so we are 5% mined..

and even if they support z-transactions, I doubt exchanges want the liability of completely anon
