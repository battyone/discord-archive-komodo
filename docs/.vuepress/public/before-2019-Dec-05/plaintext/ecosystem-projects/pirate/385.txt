[dscrd-prt] <SHossain> why unSAFE?

[04-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> also, true democracy in those times (1600-1700) was found on pirate ships - crews elected their captains based on skills and character and anyone could challenge a captain if he/she did something wrong (of course, one would need to match in skills and character)

true equality (at least back in those days) was found also on pirate ships - nowhere in the world, at that time, women had any say or rights and yet on pirate ships women (whomever chose to) were part of the crew, working, eating, looting and fighting alongside men

most crews shared the loot equally, regardless of rank, but by work put in - coward in battle? lazy sailor? sorry.. but then, most wouldn't have been accepted by their peers if they were so.. ruthless, but efficient

[04-Nov-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <zebedee> although the Barbary Pirates did the exact opposite, they toke over 1 million+ Europeans as slaves 4 the Ottoman Empire and castrated most of them, most never made it back home. At the height of the problems vast areas of Europe were unhinhabitated by the coast because of the threat. USA fought 2 wars against them before dealing with the problem!!!

Barbary pirates
The Barbary pirates, sometimes called Barbary corsairs or Ottoman corsairs, were Ottoman and Berber pirates and privateers who operated from North Africa, based primarily in the ports of Sal√©, Rabat, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. This area was known in Europe as the Barbary C...

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> ```...Men‚Äôs Journal writer Stephen Rodrick visited McAfee at his home in Tennessee, where McAfee dragged him outside to show him proof that he was being shadowed by hit men from a Mexican cartel.  ‚ÄúAll they eat is cream cheese,‚Äù McAfee told him, scanning the leaf litter in the woods. ‚ÄúI find cream cheese packets everywhere. If there‚Äôs cream cheese, I know the cartel has been here.‚Äù```

[04-Nov-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @zebedee corsairs and privateers were not pirates
although some were former pirates, most were just guns for hire to do some empire's dirty business
much like today, some state paying some group to carry out an insurgency war on their behalf that allows them to maintain deniability

[04-Nov-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <zebedee> yeah i know, they be more mercenary than pirate
