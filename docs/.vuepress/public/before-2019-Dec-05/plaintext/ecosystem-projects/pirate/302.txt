Not much in it but fame and glory.

We want to have an old treasure map as the paper wallet.

@FishyGuts i think the new Logo is a Bit lame. I like the Black one with the white P much more.

pirate.black does not have a single image for me... apart for the background on the exchange page...

[12-Nov-18 10:45 AM] jansako#3330
the wallet page is blue, everything else is black, is that on purpose?

[12-Nov-18 10:46 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Not for long.

[12-Nov-18 11:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So in order to curb the spam... You all need to start checking the #deleted-channel channel now.  
I know it gets old and boring but I have started a new channel.... to collect all the media posts.  From twitter to reddit to wherever.

So you can all just upvote and comment on media posts from one spot.  Please start frequenting and commenting liking and reposting things you find there that interest you.   We really really really are benefitting from this kind of exposure üòÉ
Thank you all.   If Pirate succeeds, it's not because of one person sailing the ship, its because of the crew and the ship that was built.
