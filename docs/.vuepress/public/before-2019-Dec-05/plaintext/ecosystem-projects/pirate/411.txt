[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> welcome to 1984

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> welcome to "I don't care what the UA says, just take my money and make it work"

[01-Dec-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> i am naming and shaming all Europeans who still have not even figured out what crypto is. A continnent in the dark ages at the moment. Shame, especially for western europe

[01-Dec-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> I must be the exception to the rule... üòè

[01-Dec-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> developed countries my backside....

[01-Dec-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> not just you oink but comparative it is shameful

[01-Dec-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> i am in europe too and what i am seeing from my adoption campaign is so dissapointing

[01-Dec-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> I fully agree... Besides that: People who __do__ know crypto, only know about cryptocoins (usualy BTC). Not the vast potential blockchain technology has.

[01-Dec-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> very true

[01-Dec-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> _is neither European or non-crypto  and basks in not being shamed or named_

[01-Dec-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> i mean seriously, europe is supposed to be a centre for history and civilisation, and after thousands of years, the only thing that Europe still understands about online payments is bank transfer?

[01-Dec-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> IN that respect, CG, I consider myself an inhabitant of the world, that happens to reside in Europe.

[01-Dec-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> something like 70% of people i speak to think crypto is illegal!!!!

[01-Dec-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Didn't Germany make some favorable laws for crypto recently

[01-Dec-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Several European countries did... But it's a patchwork of different laws, so nobody knows which regulations apply to them.

[01-Dec-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `something like 70% of people i speak to think crypto is illegal!`
thank movies and TV for that

[01-Dec-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> maybe, but Germany is soooo behind on the internet due to a hesitation to facilitate online payments, they have still some of the lowest ecommerce figures

[01-Dec-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> agreed CG, its all from propaganda, but people should be more clever than that

[01-Dec-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Mainstream media is definately demonizing crypto, implying it's mainly being used for illegal activities like laundering money and funding terrorism.

[01-Dec-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `but people should be more clever than that`

[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> Reply from retailer (who lives in 1984): ```Thank you for your email and I know where you are coming from.  Unfortunately we can only take debit and credit cards, not even Pay Pall as they don't deal with tobacconists.  Looks like it will be a trip to the shop with cash, sorry.```

[01-Dec-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> well, the realistic flip-side of that is that "BTC is *the* king of all coins" and BTC news is non-existent and combine that with "drama" sells

[01-Dec-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> plus the banks had to do something CG

[01-Dec-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @+dreamTim that retailer should actually adopt crypto. he's one of the folks that get denied/refused/banned by "traditional" platforms

[01-Dec-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> I know, right? they are the perfect candidate. I am trying to up my game with these communications now, have to have the right things to say, maybe i need some private lessons from the master of these things -> @wookie :pirate:

[01-Dec-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> Crypto is a "risky business" for most people european or not

[01-Dec-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> i guess that is what we are working to change @Ocash

[01-Dec-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> exactly

[01-Dec-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> retailer adoption is extremely low in europe

[01-Dec-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> US is low too in my experience

[01-Dec-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> and I'm glad there are people like you trying to educate and help retailers to switch to accepting crypto

[01-Dec-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> I tried to talk my brother back in europe into accepting payments in crypto but it just seems impossible to convince him to spend some time to learn about it

[01-Dec-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> I'll keep trying though

[01-Dec-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> keep trying and in my experience something will give, like mrlynch said above there are specific categories of retailers such as vape shops for example that are ostracised by banks and even paypall for dealing in products they dont approve of, those are perfect for adoption

[01-Dec-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <stimhack> I'm sure that crypto is super confusing for  normes. Far from cozy, standardised, stable and safe.

Like... 99 different privacy cryptos with their different and non-compatible wallets. Whats up with that?

[01-Dec-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[01-Dec-19 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[01-Dec-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> we have one

[01-Dec-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> but i don't think it's updated

[01-Dec-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `99 different privacy cryptos with their different and non-compatible wallets. Whats up with that?`
because otherwise it would be centralized and no different from using ACH and banks

[01-Dec-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
