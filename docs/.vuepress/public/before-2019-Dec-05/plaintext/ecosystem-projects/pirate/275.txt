[06-Nov-18 01:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ARRR will not work on iphone/android as those are lite mode only I think

[06-Nov-18 01:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ARRR needs native

[06-Nov-18 01:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Unless you can run coins native on mobile

[06-Nov-18 01:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
In which case ignore everything I just said

[06-Nov-18 01:45 PM] ph03nix#3115
they are talking about ARRR on blockfolio

Hey guys,

I've already asked this questions here but i keep getting this problem. Everytime i close and open agama wallet again, i get the message of activating best chain and it download the whole blockchain everytime...I think im not doing anything wrong, i open wallet, click on activate coin, select "pirate" than daemon is set to default and native mode

[06-Nov-18 02:55 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Is it normal ?

[06-Nov-18 03:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I am gonna need some help later today with Verus.

[06-Nov-18 03:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have 5 HDDs with coins on them and I want to merge them to one.

[06-Nov-18 03:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I also want to stake.   Do I need to run native to do so?  I assume yes.

[06-Nov-18 03:12 PM] Oszy#5734
Yes. You need native.

[06-Nov-18 03:12 PM] Oszy#5734
Make sure you get the latest VRSC enchaced Agama so you can set up cheat catching too.

[06-Nov-18 03:13 PM] Oszy#5734
In GUI just press the Start Staking

[06-Nov-18 03:13 PM] Oszy#5734
in CLI start with -mint=1

[06-Nov-18 03:14 PM] Oszy#5734
I can help if i will be around üôÇ

[06-Nov-18 03:18 PM] TheGemologist#6023
@FishyGuts Hey, i've been thinking these days about the crex offer... Ogre seems to be a way better option

[06-Nov-18 03:18 PM] TheGemologist#6023
And their listing fee is less than half crex

[06-Nov-18 03:20 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so Arrr will be one of the first Zcash forks to have sapling? :pirate:

[06-Nov-18 03:20 PM] TheGemologist#6023
There are a lot of good projects trading at Ogre that are missing good exchanges so its a place people are constantly looking at.. DERO, XTL, LTHN, XNV, MSR, ACM, ZEL..

[06-Nov-18 03:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Ogre has not responded to either of my emails @TheGemologist

[06-Nov-18 03:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We hope so @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã

[06-Nov-18 03:21 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Try twitter inbox

[06-Nov-18 03:21 PM] TheGemologist#6023
they seem to be responsive there

[06-Nov-18 03:22 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Its like 0.3btc listing fee

[06-Nov-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
@passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã i would not assume anything about timing as it is not under direct control, plus several other zcash forks just have to rebase and change chain params. curiously the closer to a pure clone a chain is, the less work to add sapling

[06-Nov-18 03:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think vrsc was the first to implement sapling?

[06-Nov-18 03:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[06-Nov-18 03:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Until someone else proves otherwise.

[06-Nov-18 03:23 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
ok thx for sharing  insight JL

[06-Nov-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
yes VRSC was the first other than ZEC

[06-Nov-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so far nobody else yet, i think some might have testnet running

[06-Nov-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so unlikely PIRATE will be third

[06-Nov-18 03:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Crex has more than 2x the volume of trade ogre.  I will email them and twitter again but they haven't responded - Probably because they don't havee zcash support.

[06-Nov-18 03:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Crex is 3x the volume of TO.

[06-Nov-18 03:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
2.5 million last 24

[06-Nov-18 03:24 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@FishyGuts Ogre has never responded to me for any project either.  However that is definitely a place people look for gems now.

[06-Nov-18 03:26 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Since Crex is the gateway to cmc, it's definitely important.  I wouldn't pick TO over Crex @TheGemologist ... But would love ARRR to be there asap.

[06-Nov-18 03:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Definitely need sapling ARRR

[06-Nov-18 03:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Crex lowered their fee to .75.  I will use the 0.05 BTC to buy ARR for the donation fund.

[06-Nov-18 03:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Paid them now.

[06-Nov-18 03:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Says 3 days... will probably be 9.

[06-Nov-18 03:30 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622

[06-Nov-18 03:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
