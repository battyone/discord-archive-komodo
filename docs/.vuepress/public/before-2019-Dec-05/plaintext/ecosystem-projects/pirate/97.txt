hopefully we can get websites to accept it

[01-Oct-18 11:04 AM] actionslacks#4072
It wont be a matter of if, it will just be how soon it is ready.

[01-Oct-18 11:05 AM] actionslacks#4072
Reporting can only be voluntary, much like cash. It is the killer crypto.

[01-Oct-18 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
also, it is actually a bit tricky to know exactly who paid you. you can monitor your wallet for total balance, but if multiple payments come in at once, how to know who sent what?

[01-Oct-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess if the other side shows you the operation status, it is possible, but if not, it is just money came in from somewhere

[01-Oct-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is a loan and you have to pay it back?

[01-Oct-18 11:09 AM] actionslacks#4072
The simplicity is the feature.

[01-Oct-18 11:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
To what extent are notary nodes involved with processing transactions on the pirate chain as far dPow?

[01-Oct-18 11:22 AM] jorian#4555
PIRATE is notarized into KMD. in order to do that, transparent transactions are needed

[01-Oct-18 11:23 AM] jorian#4555
each notarization, 13 notarizing pirates send a t-transaction to the publicly known notarizing address

[01-Oct-18 11:23 AM] jorian#4555
the notaries are not involved in any other transactions

[01-Oct-18 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries are NOT mining PIRATE

[01-Oct-18 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries dont have block producing power

[01-Oct-18 11:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
So The t-transactions notarized are not traceable to the z addresses that are processed in the block

[01-Oct-18 11:26 AM] jorian#4555
how can that happen?

[01-Oct-18 11:26 AM] jorian#4555
if that was possible, zcash wouldn't exist

[01-Oct-18 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the ztransactions show that somebody send some amount of zfunds to somebody else

[01-Oct-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
who might be the same person

[01-Oct-18 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the presence or absence of notary tx has no effect on this

[01-Oct-18 11:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
Let me preface all of this by saying I dont know shit. could you theoretically cross reference by transaction times

[01-Oct-18 11:28 AM] jorian#4555
if you dont know shit, please google zcash and start your journey

[01-Oct-18 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
only if a person announced that they just did a transaction

[01-Oct-18 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
or if somebody was monitoring your IP traffic

[01-Oct-18 11:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
That answers my question

[01-Oct-18 11:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
I will now dive into the zcash rabbit hole

[01-Oct-18 11:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
In a world where IP traffic is universally monitored and certain requests are flagged... is that behind the push for tor? Is tor still effective?

[01-Oct-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
just look at this transaction and try to figure out who got paid: http://pirate.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/fe027cf7b2bca9c68bce5bf14c10d22850c18f16cc682200af1c6cda115f1ded

[01-Oct-18 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
tor is better than nothing

[01-Oct-18 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
but it does attract attention

[01-Oct-18 11:39 AM] actionslacks#4072
Ok, i see 0 pirate transacted and .0001 fee. So i can assume something happened but what it was? Who knows.

[01-Oct-18 11:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
The notaries cannot know, the transaction cannot be dissected. So this is the trick. And I am playing dumb for the lurkers.

[01-Oct-18 11:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
Of which there are many

[01-Oct-18 11:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, no metadata for big data analysts

[01-Oct-18 11:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's garbage for them.

[01-Oct-18 11:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
not even the z tx sent back to t address which could have helped deanonymising a person based on what amount and of funds were entered and exited private txs, what time based t to z and z to t txs been

[01-Oct-18 11:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
such analytics data is totally missing in PIRATE

[01-Oct-18 11:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and since there is no jumbling, mixing, shuffling kind of techniques used to make obfuscation of the funds transacted, it's harder, because it's encryption

[01-Oct-18 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
the key is PIRATE stays in Z forever

[01-Oct-18 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
all PIRATE just adds to the one big giant anonymity set

Tfw Pirate beats zcash for network bandwidth

[01-Oct-18 11:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it beats KMD so far in network hash and difficulty

[01-Oct-18 11:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
how much x it is from KMD ?

[01-Oct-18 11:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

$1.17 * 0.175 KMD = $0.20475

[01-Oct-18 11:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if 20 cents price, then I guess the per pirate price cost counts to 0.175 KMD ?

So thats approx 2500 z9 minis mining PIRATE

[01-Oct-18 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
more like 8000

[01-Oct-18 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
5000 if they are all overclocked 50%+

Oups true just realized they do 10k sol not 30k sols

[01-Oct-18 11:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
z9 does around 30k sol I think...
z9 mini does around 10k.... ðŸ¤”

[01-Oct-18 12:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
~~$130.74 USD (ZEC) * 0.04 = 5.2296 USD~~ :trollface: :abusedsmily:

[01-Oct-18 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it got dPoW one week ago

[01-Oct-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
to map to ZEC you need to adjust by blockreward and blocktime ratios

[01-Oct-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
until dPoW it wasnt a "real" chain safe for storing value

[01-Oct-18 12:05 PM] CHMEX#0686
So atm the hash rate is 3.7% that of ZEC
