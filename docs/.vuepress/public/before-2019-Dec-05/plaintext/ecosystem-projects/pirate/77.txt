@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ is to expensiv :) 720kmd i can offer 400kmd

[28-Sep-18 01:03 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`is anyone buying?`
I have less than 10k, atm; so, "yes, they are"

[28-Sep-18 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@Talo When the cost of goods sold increases, so does the price to the consumer

[28-Sep-18 01:07 PM] Talo#5450
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ i know but i only have 400 kmd left

[28-Sep-18 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
then you might could get 4-5k

[28-Sep-18 01:08 PM] zatJUM#9924
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  Don't know why "they" are buying "your" PIRATEs and not mine. ü§î

[28-Sep-18 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Because I'm a "known" miner and people know you less? Dunno. Markets and we traders are irrational by nature

[28-Sep-18 01:09 PM] zatJUM#9924
with an escrow it's no problem!

[28-Sep-18 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
I am buying now at 0.08, but only for large lots

[28-Sep-18 01:10 PM] zatJUM#9924
I'm not desperate üòÇ

[28-Sep-18 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
0.1 if for 1 million

[28-Sep-18 01:10 PM] zatJUM#9924
I don't have 1 million to sell

[28-Sep-18 01:10 PM] jorian#4555
large lots being > 100k?

[28-Sep-18 01:10 PM] zatJUM#9924
I don't have 1 million üòÇ

[28-Sep-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
i can do 100k

[28-Sep-18 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`with an escrow it's no problem!`
That could be 1/2 of your problem; escrow, while adding trust, is considered a pain in the ass to most people

[28-Sep-18 01:13 PM] zatJUM#9924
ok

[28-Sep-18 01:14 PM] zatJUM#9924
When I baught my first PIRATE to Shossain everything went well, without any escrow üòâ

[28-Sep-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
just be careful who you OTC with.

[28-Sep-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
if they are brand new, then beware

[28-Sep-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
the newbies would send first to the established

[28-Sep-18 01:15 PM] zatJUM#9924
for sure

[28-Sep-18 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810

James offered 1 million at 0.1...damn

[28-Sep-18 01:36 PM] 0x03#8822
some people seem to be intimidated by PIRATE

[28-Sep-18 01:36 PM] Flexatron#8809
That's like 16 btc

[28-Sep-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
XMR thread looks like it is a PIRATE thread

[28-Sep-18 01:38 PM] jorian#4555
so @jl777c i'm curious why a trusted setup is not for a cypherpunk. is it really that bad?

[28-Sep-18 01:38 PM] 0x03#8822
PIRATE thread is the new SPIDERMAN thread

[28-Sep-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
it gives XMR hope that zcash is compromised

[28-Sep-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
of course there is no evidence that all ceremony participants colluded

[28-Sep-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and unless all of them did, there is zero problems with the parameters

[28-Sep-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
but they keep repeating how it isnt impossible for it to have happened, so that is basically the same as it happened

[28-Sep-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
plz ignore that XMR had an infinite coin emission bug in actuality

[28-Sep-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so I could claim there is yet another bug in XMR that is worse than if the zcash params are compromised by all ceremony participants being in collusion

[28-Sep-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
they cant disprove my claim

[28-Sep-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
therefore it must be true, right?

[28-Sep-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
The same people spouting that nonsense are saying everything I do is a scam

[28-Sep-18 01:43 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yea, clearly they're dumb. We've been hearing the "jl777 is a scam" for what 5 years now?

[28-Sep-18 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[28-Sep-18 01:43 PM] house#8741
Lack of Ability to disprove /= true

[28-Sep-18 01:43 PM] xRobeSx#5136
you've scammed me for sure üòÉ just kidding of course ha

[28-Sep-18 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE has transactions that are like: http://pirate.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/568402e62fb71c1ac84ad596bcb6cbdbcdcbfb3709af4ac47b82fa263bb3a869

[28-Sep-18 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
try to extract any meaningful info out of that

[28-Sep-18 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
with XMR every tx has 10 possible signers

[28-Sep-18 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
you get plausible deniability with XMR, as in "I wasnt the one out of 10 that signed that tx"

[28-Sep-18 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
with PIRATE there is nothing to deny as there is no indication who did the tx, who got the tx, nor how much it was for

[28-Sep-18 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why XMR peoples are very concerned about PIRATE

[28-Sep-18 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
being mandatory privacy was their one edge over zcash

[28-Sep-18 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
now that is gone

[28-Sep-18 01:46 PM] house#8741
Newton was a scam too I believe (at first)

[28-Sep-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
WTB PIRATE 0.08 to 0.1, depending on volume. the more volume, the higher the price

Hey guys... What the heck?

I am really good with techs and it is hard to follow the information on how to swap 15 KMD for pirate.

[28-Sep-18 01:49 PM] mentortechies#9400
Nothing is clear in that twitter post.

[28-Sep-18 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810

This is awesome and crazy at the same time

[28-Sep-18 01:53 PM] Oszy#5734
@mentortechies  download agama, get z address, send kmd, post tx in #deleted-channel  wait for $Pirate

[28-Sep-18 01:54 PM] mentortechies#9400
Yes, in those instruction you forgot upgrade Agama to latest version if you installed it 5 days ago and you need the version from 3 days ago so you can find Pirate in the list üòõ

[28-Sep-18 01:54 PM] mentortechies#9400
I am good with tech and was completely lost... you should get clearer instructions.

[28-Sep-18 01:54 PM] Oszy#5734
yes you need the latest that got released 3 days ago

[28-Sep-18 01:54 PM] mentortechies#9400
Also, it did not say to join discord in the twitter post. It said telegram.

[28-Sep-18 01:55 PM] Oszy#5734
There are a lot twitter posts the one i saw said discord

[28-Sep-18 02:04 PM] wookie#7663
@webworker01 not sure why, the pirate that I managed to mine early yesterday, has not shown up in my wallet. It's been almost 24 hours and it's still not here.
