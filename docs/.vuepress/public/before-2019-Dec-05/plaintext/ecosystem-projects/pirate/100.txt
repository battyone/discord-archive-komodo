I think a good flow for backend code is to use z_getoperationstatus until everything about that tx is completed, put in DB, archived, then to a z_getoperationresult on just that opid to clear it from the wallet

Little help with this... 
First reddit post....

ARRR mateys!  We are here to inform you that there is a new pirate on the seas to look after your private booty.   Be aware we take no prisoners!  Be prepared for an onslaught of PIRATE being thrown and new mateys climbing aboard as well as a new  perpetual reward system for creating your own pirate alliance!
Stick to the code and we will be all right mateys!

- Pirate Code - Subject to changes, terms and conditions -
- The Code is law, and the law is privacy.   We are taking it back!
- Thou shalt spew freely as a tavern drunkard would about the privacy of the coin.  Your booty is safe in the community chest.  Share freely with all, the benefits and privacy of PIRATE.  There is enough booty for everyone!
- All fake privacy coins are to be locked in the brig upon boarding.
- All pirate booty, heretofore known as ARRR shall be locked away in a community chest.  No other pirate no establishment will be able to know how much booty ye be havin' matey.  We ARRR all in this together.
- Treat your fellow pirates with respect as we ARRR all for a common goal, the privacy of our booty, and if you don't feel free to walk the plank into the roiling sea of other sub-par privacy coins.
What else should I add?

[02-Oct-18 11:02 AM] Zach#9973
I guess you edited it while I was reading it. I got really confused why you repeated yourself and then I couldn’t find where you first wrote it haha

[02-Oct-18 11:04 AM] Zach#9973
The part about spewing freely, should that be Thou or Thee instead of Though?

[02-Oct-18 11:04 AM] 0x03#8822
some reference to 'having to walk the plank' if you do not comply (heh) would go a long way i think 😉

[02-Oct-18 11:05 AM] 0x03#8822
but be careful, i guess one wrong word will probably trigger people 🤣

[02-Oct-18 11:06 AM] 0x03#8822
and you maybe could use the 'look at me. i am captain now.' meme, unsure if that works tho

well. attention is given ad-hoc (as opposed to over long time spans), thus memes are a fucking killer tool

@SHossain can help with the fork I think.

[02-Oct-18 11:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thing is managing the fork

[02-Oct-18 11:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there is nothing significant to even fork it

[02-Oct-18 11:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the most simplest assetchain we have

[02-Oct-18 11:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
To my opinion, keep using the same komodo platform `komodod` binaries is the best. the agama wallet anyways uses the same.

[02-Oct-18 11:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but feel free to fork it

[02-Oct-18 11:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
community has it's control already

[02-Oct-18 11:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
to me it doesn't make sense to fork it, while there's not individual devs working on it everyday

[02-Oct-18 11:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's a complete project on it's own

[02-Oct-18 11:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and the next updates are also expected from komodod sapling changes

[02-Oct-18 11:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain or @jorian (don't remember) has access to github. I leave to community whatever you guys want.

[02-Oct-18 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, a reference fork should be made

[02-Oct-18 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
there is backstroke that keeps a repo updated from an external repo, artem set it up for marketmaker

[02-Oct-18 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
but for PIRATE, it wont care about any of the new CC changes, which is where most of the changes are so it would be stable until the sapling update

[02-Oct-18 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
a lot of exchanges will require a repo

[02-Oct-18 11:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
forking jl777 repo then

[02-Oct-18 11:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or should I fork komodoplatform repo ?

[02-Oct-18 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
I dont think it matters

[02-Oct-18 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
all are having the dPoW support for PIRATE

[02-Oct-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe jl777:dev
