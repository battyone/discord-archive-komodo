[25-Nov-18 04:51 PM] KNOX#9338
yes

[25-Nov-18 04:51 PM] KNOX#9338
all mined block is being migrated first

[25-Nov-18 04:51 PM] KNOX#9338
try it out

[25-Nov-18 04:51 PM] KNOX#9338
just use `git pull && make`

[25-Nov-18 04:52 PM] KNOX#9338
then, `./cc/dapps/makedapps`

[25-Nov-18 04:52 PM] KNOX#9338
that will build `zmigrate` binary in `~/komodo/src/` dir

[25-Nov-18 04:52 PM] KNOX#9338
and, use the syntax i used

[25-Nov-18 04:52 PM] KNOX#9338

does `zmigrate` ever stop on its own or does it need user termination?

[25-Nov-18 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
there are some bugs with it thinking it is done before it is, but until it thinks its done it should keep zmigrating

[25-Nov-18 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
i did just update it to fix end detection

[25-Nov-18 05:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I seem to have the opposite problem, it reloops with each new coinbase tx

[25-Nov-18 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
well, that is part of migration

[25-Nov-18 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
if it sees a taddr, it will zmigrate it

[25-Nov-18 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
did it process all your sprout funds?

**Steps to test `zmigrate`**
1. Stop the chain and build latest
```
cd ~/komodo/src
./komodo-cli -ac_name=RKT stop
git pull
make
```
2. Compile dapp
```
./cc/dapps/makedapps
```
3. Start the chain (don't start mining)
```
./komodod -ac_name=RKT -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=54.36.126.42 -addnode=94.130.224.11 &
```
4. Create a sprout address and shield mined funds there
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=RKT z_getnewaddress sprout
./komodo-cli -ac_name=RKT z_shieldcoinbase "*" zcdiaH6hVy8vuTiCwerBoGPt2fpthQo6KEPDZJwiMekqsj3mhXYLiGZ4SzvbyVZzQbqAp94fH761imGfHa4cc3tUqnuaDo7
# change to your zc address
```
5. Create and sapling z addr and initiate migrate
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=RKT z_getnewaddress
./zmigrate RKT zs1fp7h7y348l6nm4qwwqq2ntu8vjtsgkmf7ghntsd72tef2wkzdh8ppyeegv9klaj4zzcpupfr0kd
# change to your sapling z address
```
6. Wait for migrate to be done. It may take a while at the end, don't worry and don't cancel.

7. Use `z_listunspent` call and search for and address that starts with `zc`. If none, that means the migrate has been successful for you.
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=RKT z_listunspent
```

[25-Nov-18 06:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c that is a peculiar way for `getsnapshot` to fail, if it can get the metadata, then it's a bug in iterating over results and converting them to JSON

`zcash does not have bitcore merged, so they don't even know/care if they break it

Because they haven't had time to randomly strip shit out yet?

[25-Nov-18 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
@dukeleto yes, since the dbwrapper was changed, likely some assumption of how it is deserializing the data changed
