probably 15 seconds buffer would be sufficient

[22-Oct-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but because of the TX being change -> input

[22-Oct-18 12:42 PM] 0x03#8822
holy cow

[22-Oct-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they all asemble in the blocks in order

[22-Oct-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
5000 is a lot

[22-Oct-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
500 maybe it starts slowing down

[22-Oct-18 12:42 PM] 0x03#8822
15s would be a seller tho

[22-Oct-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so the GUI side would need to be able to adjust the buffer window

[22-Oct-18 12:43 PM] 0x03#8822

[22-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Flexatron#8809
Arrr how do you store such an immensive amount of data

[22-Oct-18 12:43 PM] 0x03#8822
anything better usually requires dedicated uplinks and special protocols to work out

[22-Oct-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can get data ito chain, and it has the previous TXID at eh start of each chunk and a 8 byte hex number as backup to make sure it can be put back together

[22-Oct-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
you dont have to

[22-Oct-18 12:43 PM] 0x03#8822
i.e. tens of thousands of dollars of equipment

[22-Oct-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it is meant for onetime usage and throw it away, unless you want to archive it

if this reliably provides 15s over 'arbitrary internet' given enough bandwidth: it will be a killer

[22-Oct-18 12:44 PM] 0x03#8822
i.e. shoutcast could just stop their silly efforts for example

[22-Oct-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes if dPoW you only need a single copy to be be able to verify against KMD to prove authenticty at any time.

[22-Oct-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it wont be 100% performance like that to all nodes due to networking

[22-Oct-18 12:44 PM] 0x03#8822
archiving for the audio streams would be a thing to have tho

[22-Oct-18 12:45 PM] 0x03#8822
definitely

[22-Oct-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its a consensus rule that they mine it

just stream out to dPoW and your private key prves you made it at X time

[22-Oct-18 12:50 PM] 0x03#8822
make that work and you will win all my internets forever

[22-Oct-18 12:51 PM] 0x03#8822
right now the majority of 'low budget webradios' is forced to trust one of these
1) 15 year old software that best runs on 32bit, but then reliably and is so well documented you can just patch the binary with vi and all will be well v1.9.8 of shoutcast
2) more recent shoutcast 2.0 which is not so very developed at all. and if there is some activity, it's very strange decisions at times

[22-Oct-18 12:51 PM] 0x03#8822
so this will possibly be a  huge hit amongst the few 'independent' webradios in europe that are left, and probably also in other places

[22-Oct-18 12:52 PM] 0x03#8822
there are other solutions for web audio streaming obviously, but a lot of them are mildly to absolutely fucking expensive

[22-Oct-18 12:54 PM] 0x03#8822
you can also go for icecast but then again not a lot of the 'directories' listing streams will support it

[22-Oct-18 12:55 PM] 0x03#8822
and icecast isn't the very best thing if you're streaming mp3 either, although you can use it for that

[22-Oct-18 12:55 PM] 0x03#8822
</monologue>

[22-Oct-18 12:55 PM] 0x03#8822
so there is a use case for that

[22-Oct-18 12:55 PM] 0x03#8822
just sayin'

[22-Oct-18 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haveing all of james code avalible makes a lot of thing very fast to develop even with little experiance ... just takes some effort and thaught and msot problems can be solved  by combining things he already made.

[22-Oct-18 12:56 PM] 0x03#8822
if you factor in something that accounts for short losses in the uplink stream it will be superfragicallistic for `field audio streaming`

[22-Oct-18 12:57 PM] 0x03#8822
like livestreams from festivals or discotheques

[22-Oct-18 12:57 PM] 0x03#8822
because there's usually a crapton of mobile devices in the same cell which doesnt overly benefit your connection

[22-Oct-18 12:57 PM] 0x03#8822
so if there is any way to account for that

[22-Oct-18 12:57 PM] 0x03#8822
even more value

[22-Oct-18 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the use case for putting unlimted data into a blockchain secured by dPoW are endless...

[22-Oct-18 12:58 PM] 0x03#8822
oh god i love this idea

Right now, you set it to blast on one RPC port , then send it data on another port and it just wits until data then sends

[22-Oct-18 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Wasnt able to get it out of my head since it was conceived ... how quickly I was able to get it working was because of that üòÇ

[22-Oct-18 12:59 PM] 0x03#8822
now all thats left for me is to find some time to test it üòÑ

[22-Oct-18 12:59 PM] 0x03#8822
where does time hide nowadays, anybody?

[22-Oct-18 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha .. need to get data reassrembled yet, but i think thats no hard .. then sending a file over blockchain from 1 to X nodes will be possible after that its whatever people ca build with it.

[22-Oct-18 01:00 PM] 0x03#8822
let me know if you think it can be testdriven

data over head isnt as bad as I thaught it would be either btw.

[22-Oct-18 01:02 PM] 0x03#8822
ehhh one thought

[22-Oct-18 01:02 PM] 0x03#8822
this could be used to replace stuff like UVB-76 am i right? (please just google the term if you dont know it, it's a 'numbers station' which i think is offline now but was thought to feed russian spies abroad with new info)

[22-Oct-18 01:02 PM] 0x03#8822
as it would actually expose all the properties of such a transmission

[22-Oct-18 01:03 PM] 0x03#8822
i mean it still requires osme internet connectivity

[22-Oct-18 01:03 PM] 0x03#8822
but... hmmmm the possibilities

[22-Oct-18 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think with the confirmed blocks, rather than mempool, any slow connection would catch up .. but yes so far, the faster the connection the faster it goes.

[22-Oct-18 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mining from the node wher the data is sent from, stops the mempool just breaking ... which happened really quicly whe n the sender/miner were far apart and there were multiple miners.

[22-Oct-18 01:07 PM] 0x03#8822
another question, concerning metadata

[22-Oct-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the data stream is arbitrary data, just encode whatever data, metadata, etc into the data stream

[22-Oct-18 01:08 PM] 0x03#8822
there is idv3 for mp3s, but it never works the way it should. or... lets rephrase it to 'it only does show its full potential if you give it more attention than you should to tagging your files alone' - especially in audio streaming environments where you just need a string to send along like "artist - title"

[22-Oct-18 01:09 PM] 0x03#8822
can that be _outside_ of the actual block data as a comment to th block, as in coinbase maybe?
