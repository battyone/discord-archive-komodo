@RoyalCrypto what's the current market price of VRSC? What exchange has highest volume?

[27-Sep-18 10:52 PM] RoyalCrypto#0034
you're pretty much stuck with digitalprice.io or Barterdex

[27-Sep-18 10:52 PM] RoyalCrypto#0034
nearly all volume is OTC or dp.io

[27-Sep-18 10:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`notarizations will just stop being valid`
@blackjok3r You do get where that makes it a bad thing to not do the hf, right?

[27-Sep-18 10:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦

[27-Sep-18 10:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with a hash rate this high I dont think it matters at all tbh

[27-Sep-18 10:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[27-Sep-18 10:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Come see why having your booty in a collective pirate chest is better than having 10 mixins.

[27-Sep-18 11:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181

@blackjok3r `why is it even this high? `
https://image.ibb.co/c6VBU9/Capture.jpg
Because miners don't want to sell for less than it costs to mine

I'm just hodling for now.

[27-Sep-18 11:55 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Omg how did you guys get so many coins lol

[27-Sep-18 11:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Mining

[27-Sep-18 11:55 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I wished lol

[27-Sep-18 11:55 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I’m about 1 k

[27-Sep-18 11:55 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Not being a miner sucks a lot lol

[27-Sep-18 11:55 PM] xRobeSx#5136
mining when it was just a test coin. I was focused on staked and didn't bother with pirate at the start :/

[27-Sep-18 11:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
~~Selling 20k PIRATE at 0.09 KMD (1800 KMD total) ~~
~~get 'em before they're gone!~~
SOLD

[27-Sep-18 11:56 PM] Buddz1993#5380
now the mining difficult is much higher you got in early that’s what pays off entirely

[27-Sep-18 11:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I got drunk and put Z9 minis on PIRATE on the second day and mined 100% fo the supply for nearly 2 days.

[27-Sep-18 11:57 PM] snowdamn#2414
also, not all mined coins have found their way here, which most likely going to end up being very positive for some

[27-Sep-18 11:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I made something supid like 100x gains on what it cost.... it was the bst drunken desicion i have ever made

[27-Sep-18 11:57 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Lol I bet you are feeling proud

[27-Sep-18 11:57 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I would be aswell

[27-Sep-18 11:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am quite happy... at the time it was a joke, I never thaught this would happen, but I'll take it 😄

[27-Sep-18 11:58 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Apparently mining it’s costing  nearly 0.1 Komodo

[27-Sep-18 11:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah mining went quickly stupid once I told a few people how to make a solo pool...

[27-Sep-18 11:58 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I mean what if this surpass the top privacy coins ?

[27-Sep-18 11:59 PM] Buddz1993#5380
It is possible lol

[27-Sep-18 11:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
weeks back now it went silly ... this is just ridiculous now ...

[27-Sep-18 11:59 PM] Buddz1993#5380
completely

[27-Sep-18 11:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with FOMO like this anything is possible

[27-Sep-18 11:59 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ye that’s correct this chat is invaded with buyers lol

[28-Sep-18 12:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Don't find it too ridiculous ,  like 8 months and that will half of all coins mined

[28-Sep-18 12:00 AM] Buddz1993#5380
What’s the max supply ?

[28-Sep-18 12:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
200 mil but rapidly drops every 270 days

[28-Sep-18 12:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I mean coin rate drops not supply lol

[28-Sep-18 12:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
With the origional halving... it was 54 days until 1/4 of the suppym was minied or something... thats why I put minins on it when it was only CPU ... I htink I might have started all this hash war tbh.

[28-Sep-18 12:01 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I see ...

[28-Sep-18 12:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they changed somehting to it when dPoW was added im still not suite surte I understand what lol

[28-Sep-18 12:01 AM] Buddz1993#5380
It’s nearly the same max  supply as Komodo can this achieve its value ? I can think of that happening lol

[28-Sep-18 12:01 AM] snowdamn#2414
i don't necessarily need ARRR to drop 10 times if KMD x10 :mindblown:

[28-Sep-18 12:02 AM] Buddz1993#5380
With the FOMO that’s happening right now

[28-Sep-18 12:02 AM] Llama#1330
it's called ARRR?

[28-Sep-18 12:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
ARR is the suggested ticker

[28-Sep-18 12:02 AM] Llama#1330
I like ARR

[28-Sep-18 12:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think ARR was taken, so it has to be ARRR

[28-Sep-18 12:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ah

[28-Sep-18 12:02 AM] Buddz1993#5380
That’s weird @cHOPE

[28-Sep-18 12:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
more R's is better

[28-Sep-18 12:03 AM] Llama#1330
PRT or ARR sound good

[28-Sep-18 12:03 AM] Buddz1993#5380
So what’s he supply then ?

[28-Sep-18 12:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The supplly WAS 40 million, but the coin emmisoon would ahve ran out of coins in 2 years.

[28-Sep-18 12:03 AM] Llama#1330
ARR is still in ICO. aka we are ahead of them

[28-Sep-18 12:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so they changed it to 200 million

[28-Sep-18 12:03 AM] Llama#1330
but that's kinda mean

[28-Sep-18 12:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mined all mine when it was 40million total... and the price has gone 100x since then or something LOL

[28-Sep-18 12:04 AM] Llama#1330
so what even are z transactions

[28-Sep-18 12:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[28-Sep-18 12:04 AM] Llama#1330
oh ok

[28-Sep-18 12:05 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Most private transactions in crypto I think .

[28-Sep-18 12:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Z cash sheilded TX ... to give you an idea, I just sent 97utxo to someone on a 36 core server and it took 70s to calculate the transaction 😮

[28-Sep-18 12:05 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Wow

[28-Sep-18 12:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah lol

[28-Sep-18 12:05 AM] Llama#1330
