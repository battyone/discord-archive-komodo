yea I hear ya, was just hoping it would keep a .10 floor

[16-Nov-18 01:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
Don't you worry

[16-Nov-18 01:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
The first halving is around the corner

[16-Nov-18 01:30 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
I'm sitting on 30k, which I know isnt a lot in comparison to some of you guys, but I'm a pretty small miner.

[16-Nov-18 01:32 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
Any idea why the price of kmd is on a steady decline?

[16-Nov-18 01:35 PM] jansako#3330
cause the price of pretty much all is

[16-Nov-18 01:37 PM] BlockTech#6895
Komodo is amazing but lacking design, marketing a bit. So for now we're between 50-60 CMC doing sideway in comparison to other crypto. But i'm hoping for the best by Q2 2019.

[16-Nov-18 01:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
What's going on with the hash rate? Dropped to 35 msol

[16-Nov-18 01:47 PM] Flexatron#8809
35?

[16-Nov-18 01:48 PM] BlockTech#6895

[16-Nov-18 04:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
It very well may increase in Q1. If not, in Q2 with the halving

[16-Nov-18 04:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
When mine & dump will no longer be profitable

[16-Nov-18 04:14 PM] kaks#6612
go rich or go poor 😂

[16-Nov-18 04:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
I've been poor, didn't like it. Never again 😉

[16-Nov-18 04:14 PM] kaks#6612

[16-Nov-18 04:15 PM] BlockTech#6895
I'm poor, i don't like and it will always be that way

[16-Nov-18 04:15 PM] mrlynch#5735
But i'm hoping more to be able to pay in shops with arrr than converting it in fiat to be fair

[16-Nov-18 04:16 PM] mrlynch#5735
@BlockTech it doesn't have to be. It's up to you 😉

[16-Nov-18 04:16 PM] BlockTech#6895
Mainly up to ARRR 😜

[16-Nov-18 04:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
It's still up to you because you decided to mine it, learn about it, hodl, etc

Many issues in Pirate ecosystem:

[16-Nov-18 09:28 PM] FrancoMontana#1536
- Main site isn't working good
- Homepage don't say anything about the mission. What is Pirate coin, why is different from others?
- Hard to find informations about total supply, current supply, daily mined coins
- Write at least one-page wp with informations above
- Terrible SEO. Googling piratecoin and look at results
- No cmc

Ps: Informations about Devs would be really attractive for the average user. Even if we follow the same path of komodo with many devs anonymous

there is a lot of ongoing work behind the scenes and a lot of effort put into this

[16-Nov-18 09:39 PM] FrancoMontana#1536
I think kmd devs themself didn't understand the real potential of pirate, we need good developing and we can hit top 50 or more cmc
