wow, that is a lot of progress @jl777c

[24-Nov-18 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810

[24-Nov-18 06:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
progress shouldn't go above 1.0

[24-Nov-18 06:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright which situations can progress be >1 ?

[24-Nov-18 06:01 PM] Alright#0419
did someone send that address I posted 100 coins?

[24-Nov-18 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the fix was a consensus rule change

@Alright i don't think progress uses timestamps at all

[24-Nov-18 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
the flipping of z->t and t->z was a CONSENSUS change

update

[24-Nov-18 06:02 PM] Alright#0419
fairly sure it does, duke

[24-Nov-18 06:02 PM] Alright#0419
could be wrong though

[24-Nov-18 06:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD progress works a bit different, it tries to use `longestchain`

[24-Nov-18 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it uses height vs longestchain?

[24-Nov-18 06:02 PM] Alright#0419
only reason I thought that was because it's consistently >1 on ac_staked chains

[24-Nov-18 06:03 PM] Alright#0419
which have blocks in the future by design

[24-Nov-18 06:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have fixed some bugs in KMD/VRSC `progress` indicator, which is why I am a stickler for it being correct 😃

[24-Nov-18 06:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have never seen it over 1.0 except maybe in the last decimal place, as a rounding error. So seeing it as 1.002 now feels like a bug

[24-Nov-18 06:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
perhaps longestchain is effected by the new sapling merge

[24-Nov-18 06:05 PM] KNOX#9338

[24-Nov-18 06:06 PM] dukeleto#7326

[24-Nov-18 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
just cap it to 1

[24-Nov-18 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe a node can be 1 block ahead

[24-Nov-18 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
especially if it mined the block

[24-Nov-18 06:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, that seems possible

[24-Nov-18 06:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
```457 / 456
1.00219298245614035087```

[24-Nov-18 06:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
that explains it

[24-Nov-18 06:07 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm glad that sync issue is now almost gone

[24-Nov-18 06:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's just being 1 block ahead, because you mined the block

[24-Nov-18 06:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
nice

[24-Nov-18 06:07 PM] Alright#0419
ok so progress is definitely not based on timestamp?

[24-Nov-18 06:08 PM] Alright#0419
I consistently have >1

nope

[24-Nov-18 06:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's because you are mining the block

[24-Nov-18 06:08 PM] Alright#0419
no

[24-Nov-18 06:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
and you are ahead by 1/height

[24-Nov-18 06:08 PM] Alright#0419
not mining at all

[24-Nov-18 06:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
that amount over 1, is (height)/(height-1)

[24-Nov-18 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
basically if you are the first 30% or so of nodes to get the new block, your progress is over 1

[24-Nov-18 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
seems not so crazy

[24-Nov-18 06:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is during network sync time, it seems reasonable

[24-Nov-18 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so back to the sprout to taddr

[24-Nov-18 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
is that working?

[24-Nov-18 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and does saplint to taddr not work?

[24-Nov-18 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
taddr -> taddr

[24-Nov-18 06:09 PM] Alright#0419
would it be reasonable to remove all rpc error checks in piratenetworkrepo

[24-Nov-18 06:09 PM] KNOX#9338
i'm generating new r address and will try to send sprout funds there

[24-Nov-18 06:10 PM] Alright#0419
we want to test the consensus rules, not the rpc error checks

[24-Nov-18 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[24-Nov-18 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
z_sendmany has the rpc checks removed, so you can construct all the cases that way

[24-Nov-18 06:10 PM] Alright#0419
zs -> t consensus rule is working

[24-Nov-18 06:11 PM] Alright#0419

fwiw, new doesn't build on debian 8 for the same `-Wint-conversion` error that VRSC had; removing it from the src/Makefile.am *before* trying to build is the fix

[24-Nov-18 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so is sapling for ac_private chain basically done? just need to make the z_migrate so people dont lose privacy by reusing taddr, or unique amounts

[24-Nov-18 06:23 PM] Alright#0419
pre-activation is not well tested

[24-Nov-18 06:24 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
SHossain said he had some pre-activation problems

[24-Nov-18 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
pre-activation? like what issues. it should operate as now

[24-Nov-18 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
there is also post-deadline

[24-Nov-18 06:26 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Looking back, he said zc > t wasn't working prior to activation. Not sure of specific details, but he also tested on another chain

[24-Nov-18 06:27 PM] Alright#0419
it shouldn't

[24-Nov-18 06:28 PM] KNOX#9338
Community and all testers, please don't stop this chain until next week. we need to keep this running until after the deadline to make sure everything works as they are designed to. (explorers, pools and other logic)

[24-Nov-18 06:29 PM] Alright#0419
week is too long IMO

[24-Nov-18 06:29 PM] Alright#0419
couple days at most I'd say

[24-Nov-18 06:29 PM] Alright#0419
or start another with short deadline

[24-Nov-18 06:30 PM] Alright#0419
or 3 chains, pre-activation, activated pre-deadline and post deadline?

[24-Nov-18 06:31 PM] KNOX#9338
yeah, we can change deadline and start new chain, if that is what everyone wants.
but, pool is not ready yet, we may need time

[24-Nov-18 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
unmodified FSM branch can be the pre-activation

[24-Nov-18 06:31 PM] KNOX#9338
so, 1 week is good enough time

[24-Nov-18 06:32 PM] KNOX#9338
if we have everything ready to support sapling, we can use closer deadline

[24-Nov-18 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
1 week or whenever all the things are working

[24-Nov-18 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
