@FishyGuts whats the status of Crex?

[17-Nov-18 06:18 PM] Flexatron#8809
Thanks fishy

[17-Nov-18 06:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Draeth - not looking positive.  
Let‚Äôs just say that they probably can‚Äôt integrate it or won‚Äôt take the time to do so.   Either way that‚Äôs all I want to say about that.   
Onward and upward.   
I really would like to have a 2M + daily volume exchange.  

As is Dig Pri is a solid experience and they‚Äôve thoroughly earned our trading volume.

From JL regarding it all: 

"what digitalprice did was quite impressive"

[17-Nov-18 06:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We‚Äôve gotta realize our product is not easy to integrate.   As much as we want to force it, not everyone is willing to work for innovation.    

We will find the right exchange.   I‚Äôm egg hunting today.

I think this will be the way how Pirates can outperform Monero - implement SPV and sapling, be able to use mobile phone

agreed @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã , until we implement Sapling & SPV, ZCash still has that major edge on Pirate

[17-Nov-18 08:22 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
it's not about theory Andrew, it's about the rate of adoption. Rate of adoption is geometric, exponential initially. What matter is if that is the power of 1.01 or the power of 1.1. Decreasing heaviness of the system or increasing ease of use changes the factor and growth can be totally different after few folds same as compound %. Who knows what Im talking? :pirate:

[17-Nov-18 08:25 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Having sapling today = exchanges have 10x less chances to have problems maintaining wallets with multiple UTXOs. It means also = easier CEX adoption.  CEX adoption is what drives price, and price is what drives people to come and be interested. All is circle.

[17-Nov-18 08:25 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
HAving also SPV = ability to use lite wallet and MOBILE! which is same huge step as for sapling for exchanges.

[17-Nov-18 08:26 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
After this there is nothing more to do technically for 1-2 years, just make marketing, education, promotion. But if you have ease of use it can even grow organically.

Don't think I don't ask at least one person responsible for this if there is anything they need from us on this.   I ask someone at least once a week.  üòõ

[17-Nov-18 09:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It's more than just integrating sapling too.   

I have taken it up to get a dev group together to commit to this.  We will raise community funds for this once they reach out to me.   Let's give them a week to organize, especially with the American holiday coming.

Blackbeard - The Most Notorious Pirate Ever
Blackbeard (Edward Teach) was the notorious captain and certainly the most famous pirate of all time. His deeds, behavior and a terrifying image made him a perfect villain, who harassed many ships in Caribbean.

Cool article @FishyGuts

[17-Nov-18 09:38 PM] AndrewK#3947
Yes. Ease of use & holding/buying is a HUGE factor. But understand that the majority of the adoption and value of crypto today doesn't come from actual usage. Its from SPECULATION. You, me, everyone here is speculating on a future price increase. Everyone in crypto is. But why do people speculate? Because they believe in future adoption and future real utility which comes features like SPV, and payment integrations, etc., but ultimately comes down to the tech. These other lower tier privacy shitcoins can have as many exchange listing and merchant support as they want, but noone gives a shit because they have no real utility/privacy edge over Monero or Zcash. Take this from someone with a profession institutional background in crypto investing (not that that means anything with all these underperforming funds lol)

[17-Nov-18 09:41 PM] AndrewK#3947
People hate the action of speculating, but at the end of the day, the price increase that resulted from the speculation was the most important piece for bitcoin's rise because it gave it attention & liquidity which makes it more pertinent for non-retail players. The same is true for any other crypto.

[17-Nov-18 09:44 PM] bishop#9773
@AndrewK I'd love to hear you elaborate more on your institutional background in crypto.

(napster:centralized control of copy written material) as compared to (torrent network:decentralized control media)   ::  (fiat currency:centralized control of $) as compared to (cryptocurrency: decentralized control of $) ....no one controls the way commerce occurs...the power goes to the individual.  At the end of the day...speculators are trying to get ahead of the value...but the value will come...money can no longer be censored...the core fundamentals cannot be overlooked.
