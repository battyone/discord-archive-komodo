[dscrd-prt] <allbits> This fool was banned from komodo discord for consistent disrespectful behavior. How long will he be allowed to run rampant here? Tagging the same guy over and over for nothing is harassment.

[18-Nov-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> it might seem like a trite answer, but the reality is that the chains aren't pegged; so, afaik, it couldn't be one without a hardfork (and I'm not sure if it could even be feasibly pegged at this point in time)

I just published a new attack that breaks Mimblewimble's privacy model. This attack traces 96% of all sender and recipient addresses in real time. Here's a summary and what it means for the future of privacy coins:

[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> what i have been saying all along. in addition to being interactive protocol, it is also linkable

[18-Nov-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> so (almost) all tx can be seen in clear by every node of the network when they are being relayed?

[18-Nov-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> not by default, you need to make a highly connected node to connect to every peer to get 100%

[18-Nov-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> but that is just a matter of cost, the miners combine the tx that are in plaintext into a block. once the block is made you cant undo it, but of course if you monitor the mempool, you see all tx in plain. i called this the "grin reaper"

$ARRR uses zk-SNARKs (Zcash's privacy tech) and has the largest anonymity set of all privacy coins because it uses only shielded transactions. $ARRR is not affected by this attack and remains the strongest privacy coin. @PirateChain https://t.co/WOK3twMj5S

[dscrd-prt] <Peace> I am also curious to know if its safe to have large funds on Lite wallet.

[dscrd-prt] <Peace> 🙂

[18-Nov-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> for large amounts, i would use a fullnode

[18-Nov-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @jl777c you could set up a node and use your lite wallet to connect to it correct? (In the instance of using a mobile lite wallet, etc)

[18-Nov-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <coyote> Is there an official denomination for ARRR units?  If not I vote for planks

[18-Nov-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> for LARGE amounts best to have it onfew wallets on few OSes secured by diff passwords

[18-Nov-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> @Draeth if you control all the nodes involved in the lite node process, then it seems the only attack surface is the comms between these nodes. which i can imagine can be made pretty secure. but again, for large amounts, it is well worth the extra effort to have a fullnode in the compact configuration

[18-Nov-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> he did say a "large amount", which i take to mean large enough that if anything happened to it, would make him sad

[18-Nov-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Gotcha

[18-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> in that case, get a fullnode

[18-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jamesmarkx> @jl777c thanks for the answer

[18-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> every additional component, adds additional risk factors

[18-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kaks> @jl777c is lite wallets can get hacked?

[18-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> i didnt say that

[18-Nov-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> but even if the lite wallet can get hacked, the fullnode is immune to it

[18-Nov-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> lite wallet is very new codebase

[dscrd-prt] <jamesmarkx> btc electrum wallet nodes were compromised afaik

[18-Nov-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <coyote> It’s always good to give new codebase some time to work out the kinks

[18-Nov-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> the electrum compromise was it displayed a message to the user to update, and then gave them a compromised wallet url

[18-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> but with a pirate lite wallet, there is chance of things being logged if you dont control all the infrastructure, which cant be seen anywhere

[18-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> for convenience, it is very convenient. use it with small amounts, but for anything that would make you sad if you lost it, run a fullnode

[dscrd-prt] <jamesmarkx> 👍

[18-Nov-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763

So far there have been 3 approaches to privacy in cryptocurrencies: Zcash, Monero and Mimblewimble/Grin. In Zcash, your anonymity set is all the shielded transactions (theoretical maximum)
