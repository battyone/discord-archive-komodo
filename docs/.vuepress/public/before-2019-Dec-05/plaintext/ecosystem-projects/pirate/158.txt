Nice progress folks

[12-Oct-18 06:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Probably will be a few days for that bot, if at all TBH.   the z tx thing is requiring a retooling on the dev side.  He's testing today/tomorrow I think.  😃

Hey everyone, The bot creator has been working with us on a few things.
First, the minimum about to rain is 0.5 KMD now and the mininmum amount to soak is 1 KMD.
He has also enabled Private Send for tips.   If you type : 
!kmdtip @ buddy 10 private 
then the message will go to your DMS only.
And yes, it works.    Spam should reduce and you will be able to post tips privately now.

@Shadowalker Drop an offer in #deleted-channel I don't know about ZEC, but there have been offers for BTC in the past

[12-Oct-18 09:21 PM] Shadowalker#6698
thanks

[12-Oct-18 09:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Fun fact:
When the pseudo USD for KMD is $0.994
0.207083 KMD for 1 PIRATE
holds the same value as
when the pseudo USD for KMD was $1.20
and the trading rate was
0.25 KMD for 1 PIRATE.
So, while KMD has fallen 17%, PIRATE has fallen 32% (given a 1:0.17 trade ratio) --- not counting the *additional* pseudo USD loss PIRATE suffers after the conversion.

[12-Oct-18 09:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Isn't math fun?
