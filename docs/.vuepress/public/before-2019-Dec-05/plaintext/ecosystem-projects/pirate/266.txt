@webworker01 what's with Pirate Pool giving delayed payouts

[04-Nov-18 08:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
100 seems reasonable to me; if they can't wait for $18.45, then they shouldn't be mining :trollface:

If you have an account, it doesnt matter.   Ref link earnings will go towards onboarding and pirate costs.

We will do the same with Crex24 when we get signed up.  The links on the website will be auto ref links.

@discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh  think of it this way, every exchange at one point or another was too young with no/low volume
