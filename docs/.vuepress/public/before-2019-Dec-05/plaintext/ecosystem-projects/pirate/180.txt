"the zk-SNARKs will need to start with new public parameters. As with the previous public parameters, this will mean that a parameter generation public ceremony is required."

Guys, I just downloaded the Agama Wallet, still syncing.  But I need a Z address for mining.  I went to "get New Address" selected "Private Z Address" and copied the address to clipboard.  But it looks like I have to get the private key for that address.  But address doesn't show up in the list of addresses???

[19-Oct-18 01:34 AM] Emotionless#4424
Only the original one created shows.

[19-Oct-18 01:35 AM] Emotionless#4424
Ho do I select the new address that doesn't show up now.  Is it maybe because the chain hasn't finished syncing?

[19-Oct-18 01:36 AM] Emotionless#4424
@Bitcoin Benny @grewalsatinder can you guys help?

[19-Oct-18 01:37 AM] Zach#9973
@Emotionless You need your wallet to fully sync before you create and use your zaddress

[19-Oct-18 01:39 AM] Zach#9973
and you only need the public address for mining, the private key you will need to save so you can access your wallet if you swap computers or something

Can I create my own general password for the whole wallet to send or do I have to use the million characters they give me per wallet?

[19-Oct-18 01:40 AM] Zach#9973

[19-Oct-18 01:41 AM] Hermes#6934
Your wallet.dat file hold your private keys

[19-Oct-18 01:42 AM] Hermes#6934
Just keep this file safe and you will be ok

[19-Oct-18 01:43 AM] Emotionless#4424

@actionslacks  well just trying to figure this thing out.  I dont know any coins that dont have their own wallets.  And I know it just came out, but all this selling and buying in OTC is also weird to me.  S I'm trying to figure out if there is quality in this coin worth mining and holding long term.

[19-Oct-18 01:56 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@twistedmind 
1) You're wrong
2) the *highest sell price* doesn't put downward pressure on the market when the lower prices equal triple the volume (because, math)
3) my 6% total over the entire time that OTC has even been a thing is far less than your imagination has made it to be

@webworker01 thanks man.

@Llama how does that work.  I send to them they send to them and he sends to us?

[19-Oct-18 02:03 AM] Llama#1330
for example: you are selling ARRR to (john) and the middleman is (tim)

1. you will send your ARRR to Tim
2. John will send his KMD to Tim.
3. Tim will send you the KMD
4. Tim will send John the ARRR
