@SHossain I posted mine 10 lines up from your most recent comment with my joke. Not sure if it's worthy to get rewarded, but in case you did, I don't see a transaction to the address on the explorer. Thanks.

if you provided correct z address, the funds should be there http://pirate.explorer.dexstats.info/block/000000a86ccd35e3622c733cb60739df3f579e9716cbb68fc7740f9195191c98

In a dark, dirty tavern, this pirate was telling his adventures to a dozen drunk sailors.
- I have this wooden leg because the original was eaten by a shark.
- Oh! And what about the hooked hand?
- My hand was lost in battle, cut off by a swordsman ... days later, I decided to put the hook ...
- Oh! And the eye patch?
- I use it, because my left eye has been pierced...
- Also by a swordsman?
- No! It was an accident... I was sunbathing on the bow of the ship, when a seagull suddenly shrilled right in my eye... It was my first day with the hooked hand!...

[07-Sep-18 01:11 PM] wookie#7663
Is it possible to mine pirate with a cpu or is that negligible (similar to KMD)?

[07-Sep-18 01:11 PM] wookie#7663

A pirate and his parrot, were adrift in a lifeboat following a dramatic escape from a valiant battle. While rummaging through the boat's provisions, the pirate stumbled across an old lamp. Secretly hoping that a Genie would appear, he rubbed the lamp vigorously. To the amazement of the castaways, a Genie came forth. This particular Genie, however, stated that he could only deliver one wish, not the standard three. Without giving any thought to the matter the pirate blurted out, "Make the entire ocean into rum!" The Genie clapped his hands with a deafening crash, and immediately the entire sea turned into the finest rum ever sampled by mortals. Simultaneously, the Genie vanished. Only the gentle lapping of rum on the hull broke the stillness as the two considered their circumstances. The parrot looked disgustedly at the pirate and after a tension-filled moment spoke: "Now yee've done it!! Now we're gonna have to pee in the boat."

[07-Sep-18 01:20 PM] SHossain#0007
any z address will work.

[07-Sep-18 01:20 PM] SHossain#0007
you just need to have the privkey of that address to access the funds

A pirate walks into a bar with a big ships wheel down his pants. The bartender says, ‚ÄúExcuse me, sir, but do you know you have a ship‚Äôs wheel down the front of your pants?" The pirate replies, ‚ÄúAaargh, it‚Äôs driving me nuts!!"

I see several messages talking about getting pirate notarized. Can someone explain what that means?

[07-Sep-18 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW requires transparent addresses

[07-Sep-18 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE has no transparent addresses possible as a destination for funds

[07-Sep-18 03:07 PM] wookie#7663
So by design, pirate just will not have dpow?

[07-Sep-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
Maybe it will be possible to add dPoW in the future with some special exemptions for notarizations, but for now it cant be notarized.

[07-Sep-18 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE will need to be like most all the other coins and rely on just its hashrate to secure itself
