On Pirate.black this wording is still in there for the netwrok connection info.   I thought the halving was increased.   Should we update this or am I being stupid?  

 Connect to PIRATE blockchain

@SHossain ok. Im downloading chain, but it didnt hv me input my kmd key... Once i hv pirate, dont i need a priv key?

[26-Sep-18 05:15 PM] SHossain#0007
if you generate a PIRATE z address using Agama, you will already have private key inside the wallet under your control. back it up somewhere safe

[26-Sep-18 05:16 PM] jcooper#1100
Ahhh. Ok. Thx bro.

[26-Sep-18 05:17 PM] jcooper#1100
So ill hv my kmd priv key for agama. Then ill hv separate priv key for pirate. Is this case for all separate tokens on agama?

[26-Sep-18 05:17 PM] 0x03#8822
i propose to rename the special case of PIRATE private key to just be `pirate key`

quick question, do Z transactions on Pirate have an effect on Z transactions for KMD or Zcash?

[26-Sep-18 05:36 PM] xRobeSx#5136
they are the same type of transaction between the three @Regnar

[26-Sep-18 05:37 PM] xRobeSx#5136
its just that PIRATE would technically be more secure, because all of the TX's are z transactions so its harder to trace. On KMD or zcash its much more visible because most of the tx's are transparent

[26-Sep-18 05:41 PM] jcooper#1100
@SHossain ok. Pirate chain is synced. But i dont see how or where priv key is.

PIRATE is z-only. hoped you'd know this already...

[26-Sep-18 06:04 PM] Regnar#6164
If you run native for both KMD and PIRATE, do they share Keys?

[26-Sep-18 06:04 PM] SHossain#0007
you can import export z address with priv keys

Just in case it's not clear for everyone, I want to clearly explain the point I was making about zero knowledge vs. encrypted. To recover the data, it must be encrypted, not just zero knowledge proven. To prove that a certain receiver is the receiver of a transaction or that the math between sources and destinations is correct, the original information does not need to be used. How this applies to a private transaction with zk-SNARKs is that the actual message and amount are there and encrypted, but the amount is never exposed, since the transaction can be proven correct without doing so, and there is no reference, no record stored whatsoever of sender or receiver, besides the ability for the sender or receiver to verify that they are a party to the transaction.

miketoutLast Monday at 5:27 AM
for privacy, nothing beats zero knowledge, because zero knowledge proofs separate the data from the proof of the data. That's why Monero and the ring sig based coins are all moving to bulletproofs or other forms of zero knowledge proofs. Lightning uses the Sphinx protocol, which is basically an improved Tor to provide multiple layers of encryption. This is still encryption of all relevant data, so theoretically, it can eventually be cracked, but to do so is very hard. To perform mathematical operations to ensure that transactions are correct, the lightning network needs to know the values of the transactions, which is another way to correlate who is doing what. This data also isn't used on zero knowledge transactions. While one can argue that Lighting has added a layer of privacy, I don't believe that privacy comes close to the theoretical privacy in zero knowledge systems.
