@0x03 I can't view Miner Stats on my desktop, but can on my Phone. Do I need a plug-in or something?

[19-Oct-18 08:24 PM] 0x03#8822
no, it may be your browsers fault. can you try restarting it? the nomp graph stuff isn't exactly optimized or well performing

[19-Oct-18 08:25 PM] actionslacks#4072
Wuwuwhat? We got a pirate bot?

[19-Oct-18 08:25 PM] penguin#0544
F5 - Do it ! , A page refresh usually sorts it out

[19-Oct-18 08:26 PM] 0x03#8822
in my case killing the tab/reopening it will be faster, a lot 😄

[19-Oct-18 08:26 PM] 0x03#8822

if they did, they lied

[19-Oct-18 08:26 PM] Snoop#8470
@0x03 nope, didn't work

[19-Oct-18 08:27 PM] penguin#0544
which browser ?

[19-Oct-18 08:27 PM] 0x03#8822
maybe using noJS or similar?

[19-Oct-18 08:27 PM] Snoop#8470
Tried IE explorer and MS edge

[19-Oct-18 08:27 PM] 0x03#8822
that would also kill it

[19-Oct-18 08:27 PM] 0x03#8822
ah. no noJS probably

[19-Oct-18 08:28 PM] penguin#0544
pirates don't use IE though

[19-Oct-18 08:28 PM] Oszy#5734
Those are not browsers :trollface:

I'll look into extensions

How many Pirates has a block? whats the blockreward?

[19-Oct-18 08:29 PM] 0x03#8822
@FishyGuts u were asking for my pool address before - was it the URL you wanted?

[19-Oct-18 08:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Done.

[19-Oct-18 08:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
yes

[19-Oct-18 08:30 PM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
I read that it would be possible to have a verushash mining algorithm in Pirate coin. This is real?

[19-Oct-18 08:31 PM] Snoop#8470
@0x03 works fine on Chrome.

[19-Oct-18 08:31 PM] penguin#0544
yohyoh a big chest of pirates that one

[19-Oct-18 08:31 PM] Snoop#8470
No surprise

[19-Oct-18 08:31 PM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
It would be nice if this coin was mined on the GPU and not on the clothes dryers)

[19-Oct-18 08:31 PM] penguin#0544
this is true

[19-Oct-18 08:31 PM] 0x03#8822
@Snoop in that case - excuse my french - stop using shit browsers (and use another shit browser called chrome instead, lol)

[19-Oct-18 08:32 PM] 0x03#8822
i refuse to support edge if changes should be necessary

[19-Oct-18 08:32 PM] 0x03#8822
(to th epool that is)

[19-Oct-18 08:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Takoy_Nahal  it's possible in the near future

[19-Oct-18 08:33 PM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
@polycryptoblog If so, this is great news. Will there be a change of algorithm or two algorithms parallel?

[19-Oct-18 08:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It'll be GPU and not ASIC when all the ASICs die and folks are forced to pull their GPUs back off the shelves 😛

[19-Oct-18 08:36 PM] 0x03#8822
you mean when nobody will wanna buy new ASICs off bitmain because they wanted to KYC?

Very good GPU will attract more people to this project, ASIC is beneficial only for large miners and even for several months)

[19-Oct-18 08:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Takoy_Nahal if you have $800 for a GPU, then you have $800 for an ASIC

[19-Oct-18 08:38 PM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
No thanks, ASIC is only beneficial for sha-256

_walks away before getting on a soapbox about the silliness of GPU-fanboys_

[19-Oct-18 08:40 PM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
Everything else is a huge risk. Where I live ASIC for $ 800 you can not buy, and they sell you used Bitmain ASIC. Bitmain first mine itself, then sells to others)

[19-Oct-18 08:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1 z9 mini makes the network 16x more secure than 1 GPU
That you cannot purchase where you live is no reason to create a less secure network

arggggg who be swashbucklin me plunder? Reduce yer hashrates while i be captain o'er the pool!!!  (Please sirs for mi familia)

[19-Oct-18 08:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Also, BM is only 1 of 4 ASIC makers

[19-Oct-18 08:43 PM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
But who cares, everyone cares about money, I have been dealing for a long time with different ASICs, on different algorithms. All of them after 3-6 months produce very little and go to the garbage.

[19-Oct-18 08:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm still running my S7LNs after 29 months

[19-Oct-18 08:46 PM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
sha-256 ASIC?

[19-Oct-18 08:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[19-Oct-18 08:48 PM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
A good project, I read about Pirate, really looking forward to the appearance of the verushash algorithm. Good luck to you guys

[19-Oct-18 08:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
everyone that cries "ASICs aren't profitable" owns less than 10 or 0

[19-Oct-18 08:48 PM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 read what I wrote above about sha-256

[19-Oct-18 08:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes, but he just said he is running them for 29 months 😛

[19-Oct-18 08:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Honestly, we didn't start the project for miners exactly...  we have dPoW for security.  
We do feel the increased hashrates from these hardware specific applications do support a stronger networkm, especially now with them being readily available

[19-Oct-18 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's all about scale; if you cannot afford to, or refuse to, scale with the network (of any chain) then you'll be left behind

[19-Oct-18 08:50 PM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
I do not cry, I know that besides sha-256, the rest of the ASICs are a very risky investment, especially if I did not buy it on the first wave. If you like ASIC, it's your business, I expressed my opinion based on experience with ASICs)

[19-Oct-18 08:52 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You're not wrong.    
This has been proven time and again :)

Ultimately, I think that the z9 will be profitable on Pirate for a while.

@CryptoForge_cc The OTC trading in KMD discord, the last 48 hours has been flooring at 0.09 KMD per pirate.
There is a standing order for 100K or more at 0.1 KMD per pirate.
At 0.09 that is about $0.114 per.
One rig has averaged about 70-80 Pirate a day the last 2 days.
$7...

[19-Oct-18 08:52 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
There will be other coins that use verushash maybe even a private one

[19-Oct-18 08:52 PM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
Guys, if you want to enrich Bitmain, which sells used ASICs for you, it's your choice, good luck to you)

[19-Oct-18 08:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Same as enriching Nvidia or AMD..

[19-Oct-18 08:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Takoy_Nahal Why are you stuck in full FUD mode on 1 company out of 4 that make ASICs

[19-Oct-18 08:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
At least Bitmain charges you the same $$ for one unit capable of 20X the workload at 1/10 the electric cost.

[19-Oct-18 08:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
By the time the asics are bricked, so are the GPUs that were competing with them.

[19-Oct-18 08:54 PM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
Yes, only Nvidia sells new GPUs, and I can sell them in a bull market with a small loss in a year)

[19-Oct-18 08:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You're right you can.

[19-Oct-18 08:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But the electric useage was at least 10x more... and they required about 7-8x the hardware components for the same network hashing power (ignorant estimate there).

[19-Oct-18 08:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The arguments go both ways.  It's a moot point here 😃

[19-Oct-18 08:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Until Jihan sprouts horns and 51%'s a coin himself, I don't consider it a real concern.

[19-Oct-18 08:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Yes, only Nvidia sells new GPUs, and I can sell them in a bull market with a small loss in a year)`
Or until the 2080Ti is $600 and no one wants your 3 year old, tired hand-me-downs

[19-Oct-18 08:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Constantly evolving and developing filed.

[19-Oct-18 08:58 PM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
My electricity costs 5 cents, for me it is not a problem. I'm not saying that the GPU is well mined, I now did not buy either the ASIC or the GPU. It is now easier to simply buy a coin than to mine it for 2-3 months, and even better, POS mining. Again, this is your business, I did not dissuade)

[19-Oct-18 08:59 PM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
Better not ASIC or GPU, better just to buy)

[19-Oct-18 09:00 PM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
Good luck guys. Waiting verushash)

[19-Oct-18 09:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
On buying vs mining, I think we can agree on that about a good many coins
On GPU vs ASIC, my bags just will not let me see your point of view
