we need to reduce the diff so it is easier to mine

[25-Sep-18 06:33 PM] Alright#0419
Oh another surprise hard fork?

[25-Sep-18 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry about the unintentional hardfork.

[25-Sep-18 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
I didnt expect shossain to get notarizing all working so fast

[25-Sep-18 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, diff is down to 5Msol now

[25-Sep-18 06:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's so cute to see @Alright experiencing but one of the many things I, @xRobeSx, and other miners experience on a regular basis :trollface:

[25-Sep-18 06:36 PM] Alright#0419
I was 1/3 of the network hash rate when you guys hard forked 😐

_wasn't even mining until after that_

[25-Sep-18 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry about making PIRATE 10x more valuable overnight by adding dPoW

[25-Sep-18 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
if only I took a long time for that, this wouldnt have happened

[25-Sep-18 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
I should wait for a PIRATE roadmap

[25-Sep-18 06:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_mined 5 blocks on Aug 29; everything else he mined came after the fork_

[25-Sep-18 06:39 PM] xRobeSx#5136

[25-Sep-18 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
pirate.black

[25-Sep-18 06:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's this thing called "the interwebs", it has lots of sites 🙂

[25-Sep-18 06:40 PM] Flexatron#8809
Awesome

[25-Sep-18 06:40 PM] Flexatron#8809
Forgot that one

[25-Sep-18 06:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Alternatively can use Verushash PoW, but has to be used for a 100% PoW chain.`
What's that mean? 🤔

[25-Sep-18 06:41 PM] Alright#0419
well, 👋 made enough KMD off of this, can't be bothered until the diff comes down

[25-Sep-18 06:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`can't be bothered until the diff comes down`
See you in 4 years 👋

[25-Sep-18 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
that line was there to deal with the end of mining in 2 years, but the 5x on halving solves it better

[25-Sep-18 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
still blockreward of 16 in 4 years

[25-Sep-18 06:44 PM] Flexatron#8809
So who's gonna make a pirate treasure chest chart

[25-Sep-18 06:45 PM] Flexatron#8809
The PIRATE version of "whale"

[25-Sep-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
not possible

[25-Sep-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810

[25-Sep-18 06:47 PM] Flexatron#8809
Need names for different degrees of treasure chest sizes

[25-Sep-18 06:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Kinda arbitrary

[25-Sep-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
in zaddrs, it is not visible to anybody but the wallet with the privkey, unless a viewing key is given out

Can use these names + pics and assign 10k, 50k, etc next to it

[25-Sep-18 06:56 PM] Flexatron#8809
Lame, I know

[25-Sep-18 07:02 PM] Flexatron#8809
Didn't know Drake was a pirate xd

[25-Sep-18 07:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Rather than amount amassed make it on hashrate 😛
🎣 = " 😭 the diff is too high"

[25-Sep-18 07:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🐋 = "Not a bad day's income"
:trollface:

[25-Sep-18 07:06 PM] Flexatron#8809
Lol

[25-Sep-18 07:08 PM] scubapanda#2485
@Flexatron Why richlist?

[25-Sep-18 07:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Because comparing is fun

[25-Sep-18 07:13 PM] scubapanda#2485
I especially love it when it's impossible.

[25-Sep-18 07:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
On the plus side, if it is possible and you can do it, then you'll go down in history as the one the broke equihash 👍

[25-Sep-18 07:15 PM] scubapanda#2485
😃

[25-Sep-18 07:22 PM] snowdamn#2414
"richlist isnt" - what is being depicted on dexstats ?

[25-Sep-18 07:22 PM] Flexatron#8809
T adresses

[25-Sep-18 07:22 PM] snowdamn#2414
t for pirate?

[25-Sep-18 07:23 PM] Flexatron#8809
People that solo mines

[25-Sep-18 07:23 PM] Flexatron#8809
Then didn't send to z

[25-Sep-18 07:23 PM] snowdamn#2414
dumb it down, please!

[25-Sep-18 07:23 PM] Flexatron#8809
Blocks rewards go t a transparant address

[25-Sep-18 07:23 PM] snowdamn#2414
wait, they have an option not to send?

[25-Sep-18 07:24 PM] snowdamn#2414
i guess they will eventually, thanks! 👍

[25-Sep-18 07:24 PM] snowdamn#2414
or else it's like burning lol

[25-Sep-18 07:27 PM] snowdamn#2414
so there is a t -> z?

[25-Sep-18 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
coinbases are transparent

[25-Sep-18 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
the rule is no ->t, other than to notary address

[25-Sep-18 07:28 PM] snowdamn#2414
ok, so my brain goes back to if i do t->z, z->z and then only send to z it's the same thing

[25-Sep-18 07:29 PM] scubapanda#2485
So notary node can only send coins to z? Or ta another notary node?

[25-Sep-18 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
coinbase is in taddr

[25-Sep-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
from there it goes to zaddr

[25-Sep-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
or to notary addr

[25-Sep-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
all nodes can send to either zaddr or notary addr

[25-Sep-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont expect large amount of donations to notaries

[25-Sep-18 07:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I dont expect large amount of donations to notaries`
Other than proofs, I'm not sure there's likely to be *any*

[25-Sep-18 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
exactly. so I am confused why some people are worried that the notary taddr tx will someone affect PIRATE purity

[25-Sep-18 07:34 PM] snowdamn#2414
not worried, stating you can do exactly same thing with z-KMD

[25-Sep-18 07:34 PM] scubapanda#2485
So notary nodes can transfer as many coins in t-t as they want and then send to z?

[25-Sep-18 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
it was on bitcointalk

[25-Sep-18 07:34 PM] 0x03#8822
I am happy to announce public beta testing of https://pirate.komodopool.xyz/stats

[25-Sep-18 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
if notaries obtain PIRATE in their notary addresses, then yes

[25-Sep-18 07:34 PM] 0x03#8822
@xRobeSx can confirm that the pool is paying out

[25-Sep-18 07:34 PM] 0x03#8822
and it's set to zero fee

[25-Sep-18 07:35 PM] SHossain#0007
@0x03 you may be eligible to get 5000 PIRATE bounty from me

[25-Sep-18 07:35 PM] SHossain#0007
for public pool

[25-Sep-18 07:35 PM] scubapanda#2485
I'm not worried, just curious and want to learn.

[25-Sep-18 07:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My pool has 0 fee too, and 0 payout; anyone want to join it :trollface:

[25-Sep-18 07:35 PM] 0x03#8822
@SHossain please test my pool then 😛

[25-Sep-18 07:35 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I can confirm that I've been mining on @0x03 's pool and it's working 😃

[25-Sep-18 07:36 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm han solo ☠

[25-Sep-18 07:36 PM] 0x03#8822
ok then please _somebody_ point his power to my pool to get further confirmation

[25-Sep-18 07:36 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@SHossain join me so @0x03 can get his bounty 😃

[25-Sep-18 07:37 PM] 0x03#8822
oh yes let me add

[25-Sep-18 07:38 PM] 0x03#8822
i'll be sharing the modifications to s-nomp in a repo, for free.

[25-Sep-18 07:38 PM] 0x03#8822
unsure if i will before i get up again tho - i've kind of had it for the day 😛

[25-Sep-18 07:39 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. putting one of my miner

[25-Sep-18 07:39 PM] 0x03#8822
i'm not planning on introducing pool fee, so that part may be broken (and i didn't bother to test). however, anybody who wants a copy ahead can have a tarball

[25-Sep-18 07:39 PM] 0x03#8822
that'll be no problem

[25-Sep-18 07:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`anybody who wants a copy ahead can have a tarball`
You think people actually use something other than Winduhs? 😮

[25-Sep-18 07:42 PM] 0x03#8822
windows still doesn't handle tarballs by its own?

[25-Sep-18 07:44 PM] SHossain#0007
@xRobeSx did you get paid from @0x03's pool?

[25-Sep-18 07:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`windows still doesn't handle tarballs by its own?`
I'm not sure, but given that 10 is mostly still 7 I assume not

[25-Sep-18 07:44 PM] SHossain#0007
i mean, mining reward

[25-Sep-18 07:45 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@SHossain yes, including @0x03 's rented hash as well. Thank you for that.

[25-Sep-18 07:45 PM] SHossain#0007
@0x03 post your z address. i'll send you the bounty

[25-Sep-18 07:46 PM] SHossain#0007
and, i'll keep mining in your pool until tomorrow

[25-Sep-18 07:46 PM] Flexatron#8809
Pointing my hash as well

[25-Sep-18 07:48 PM] SHossain#0007
@webworker01 maybe you can release the source now? or pass it over to other pool operators for some donation? we can have multiple pool running then. (just thinking out loud)

[25-Sep-18 07:48 PM] 0x03#8822
@SHossain `zcGuJ5iDu2SvLvjSkA78313UuhjA218zFM2uCW7mA5pK59KtTvvoYieWRBS5Q8VQsNNuXdvwZ33eGxDxoVNyigK5dLrtwq9` thank you very much
