Now @jl777c is porting it into all KMD chains for everyone to use.... Is the simple explanation.

[24-Nov-18 06:35 PM] FishyGuts#5085
These guys here are testing like bad a$$ MFers.   I asked them for their ZC addresses and noone has sent one yet 😛

[24-Nov-18 06:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
man, I love that z_ transactions now finish before I even tab to tail :shexy:

yes, i love this z transactions.

[24-Nov-18 06:37 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c can we penalize people who do zc -> t and leave it in t?

[24-Nov-18 06:37 PM] Alright#0419
maybe make them unspendable after some time

[24-Nov-18 06:37 PM] SHossain#0007

[24-Nov-18 06:39 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm still thinking if i should replace i7-8700k with a new i9-9900k in my laptop 🤔

[24-Nov-18 06:39 PM] SHossain#0007
hard decision

[24-Nov-18 06:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is still waiting for his "pre-order" i9-9900k 😭_

[24-Nov-18 06:40 PM] SHossain#0007
i9-9900k OEM and retail boxed already available for me to buy using BTC

[24-Nov-18 06:40 PM] Alright#0419
Why do you need a beefy laptop if you have beefy servers already

[24-Nov-18 06:41 PM] Alright#0419

no one "needs" a i9-9900k

[24-Nov-18 06:41 PM] SHossain#0007
i compile komodo within 10 minutes

[24-Nov-18 06:41 PM] SHossain#0007
saves time while testing

[24-Nov-18 06:42 PM] Alright#0419
how often are you compiling on host machine though?

[24-Nov-18 06:42 PM] SHossain#0007
everyday

[24-Nov-18 06:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i compile komodo within 10 minutes`
the 6700k did that 😛

[24-Nov-18 06:42 PM] Alright#0419
not sure I've ever compiled komodod on anything but a remote server

[24-Nov-18 06:42 PM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 it basically takes about 5 minutes 😛

[24-Nov-18 06:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
5 != 10 :trollface:

[24-Nov-18 06:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
can I get in the feken tub now or are you guys going to break something else?

[24-Nov-18 06:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[24-Nov-18 06:45 PM] SHossain#0007
they are way too slow

[24-Nov-18 06:46 PM] SHossain#0007
actually, i have a NAS that uses HDD and i dont' use it 😦

[24-Nov-18 06:46 PM] kaks#6612
@SHossain  SSD is better than HDD

[24-Nov-18 06:46 PM] SHossain#0007
for sure

[24-Nov-18 06:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
@FishyGuts i was referring to these mad scientists over here that are bringing sapling to pirate 😁 was aware of Verus's integration

[24-Nov-18 06:53 PM] kaks#6612
noob question:
does VRSC coin is asic resistant?and which algoritm is it? 🤔

[24-Nov-18 06:53 PM] Alright#0419
verushash

[24-Nov-18 06:54 PM] Alright#0419
they made it. it's based on Haraka_v2

[24-Nov-18 06:54 PM] Alright#0419
no asic for it

[24-Nov-18 06:54 PM] SHossain#0007
@kaks there is no ASIC for VerusHash

[24-Nov-18 06:54 PM] kaks#6612
nice

[24-Nov-18 06:54 PM] Alright#0419
yet :trollface:

[24-Nov-18 06:54 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, you are right @Alright

[24-Nov-18 06:55 PM] SHossain#0007
until Bitmain or other company invents them

[24-Nov-18 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
I imagine we will see many verushash chains now that it's supported for asset chains

[24-Nov-18 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
more chains, more likely to see an ASIC

[24-Nov-18 06:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Once it beomes profitable to mine and other Verushash chains pop up.

[24-Nov-18 06:56 PM] Alright#0419
don't know much about the algo itself tbh, not sure if it's particularly challenging to create an ASIC for it or not

[24-Nov-18 06:58 PM] Alright#0419
@kaks it's a unique algo in that CPUs can actually compete with GPUs

[24-Nov-18 06:58 PM] kaks#6612
@Alright i will try to mine using on RX 580 GPU

[24-Nov-18 07:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`z_mergetoaddress`
the "old-fashioned" way:
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=RKT z_sendmany "zsaddy_here" '[{"address": "zsaddy_here" ,"amount": '"$(echo "scale=4;  ($(./komodo-cli -ac_name=RKT z_gettotalbalance | jq -r '.private') - 0.0001)" | bc)"'}]'`

[24-Nov-18 07:04 PM] kaks#6612
in agama wallet VRSC is lite?

[24-Nov-18 07:04 PM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 can you please test how many max addresses you can put for a z_sendmany?

[24-Nov-18 07:05 PM] SHossain#0007
currently 50 is the limit

[24-Nov-18 07:05 PM] SHossain#0007
wondering if that has changed

[24-Nov-18 07:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I will after I finally get into the tub 😛

[24-Nov-18 07:05 PM] SHossain#0007
cool. thanks 😃

[24-Nov-18 07:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Before Sapling activates, the maximum number of zaddr outputs is 54 due to transaction size limits.`
maybe no max *after*?

[24-Nov-18 07:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤔

[24-Nov-18 07:14 PM] SHossain#0007
not sure.

[24-Nov-18 07:15 PM] KNOX#9338
seems the chain is running fine and no stuck node reported

[24-Nov-18 07:17 PM] KNOX#9338
@FishyGuts DM'd you my z addr 😃

[24-Nov-18 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
maxsize is 200kb

[24-Nov-18 07:22 PM] Alright#0419
was is 100kb previously?

[24-Nov-18 07:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
If you guys need another node running i have a spare machine to put to use. Point me to the right direction

[24-Nov-18 07:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
Just build the FSM branch?

[24-Nov-18 07:23 PM] KNOX#9338
you need to build FSM branch from here https://github.com/PirateNetwork/komodo

Cool. Anything else?

[24-Nov-18 07:25 PM] KNOX#9338
nope, all you need to do after compiling just issue the chain param 
```
./komodod -ac_name=RKT -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=54.36.126.42 -addnode=94.130.224.11 &
```

[24-Nov-18 07:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`maxsize is 200kb`
so based on data size limits and not count (like a "normal" tx), correct?

[24-Nov-18 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, based on actual size
