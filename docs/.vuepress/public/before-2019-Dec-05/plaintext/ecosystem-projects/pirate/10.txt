there probably could be a consensus-level check to prevent taddr outputs that are not amount=0

[01-Sep-18 02:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
then these hacks wouldn't work, but I am not sure what we are trying to accomplish anymore

[01-Sep-18 02:45 PM] Alright#0419
there is

[01-Sep-18 02:45 PM] Alright#0419
that is the consensus level check

[01-Sep-18 02:46 PM] Alright#0419
basically if outputs >0 for transparent tx, reject it

[01-Sep-18 02:46 PM] Alright#0419
there are a couple checks in AcceptToMemoryPool you need to get rid of to actually get your node to accept the tx, but those aren't consensus rules

[01-Sep-18 02:49 PM] Alright#0419
IMO it should be left the way it currently is

[01-Sep-18 02:49 PM] Alright#0419
0 sat output t -> t transactions can be useful

[01-Sep-18 02:50 PM] Alright#0419
provably burning coins, notarizations, OP_RETURNs

[01-Sep-18 02:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
what way "is it" now?

[01-Sep-18 02:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
notary nodes should be able to notarize ac_private chains without hacking the code, right?

[01-Sep-18 02:57 PM] Alright#0419
need some work to get there, but there is a viable way to do it

[01-Sep-18 02:57 PM] Alright#0419
they'd need to be funded in coinbase transactions

[01-Sep-18 02:57 PM] Alright#0419
and the outputs of a notarization tx need to be 0 sat

[01-Sep-18 02:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
hmmm

[01-Sep-18 02:58 PM] Alright#0419
funding them with coinbase transactions is simple

[01-Sep-18 02:58 PM] Alright#0419
I can start doing it if we had an amount

Shiver me timbers, thar be a whale in these waters

[01-Sep-18 03:00 PM] Alright#0419
Basically the only thing that needs to be done to support dpow is to make an exception for the notarization tx for ac_private chains

[01-Sep-18 03:01 PM] Alright#0419
instead of paying RXL address .09(or whatever it is), pay it 0

[01-Sep-18 03:02 PM] Alright#0419
if someone wants to try to do that, lmk and I'll start mining blocks that fund each notary address with tiny UTXOs

@webworker01 you could do transparent payouts with a bit of work

[01-Sep-18 05:50 PM] Alright#0419
do `-connect` to a separate node, change the AcceptToMemoryPool rules on the stratum's node then send transactions with 0 outputs and all the mined blocks as inputs

[01-Sep-18 05:50 PM] Alright#0419
then when you mine a block, pay each address what you owe them in the coinbase

[01-Sep-18 05:50 PM] Alright#0419
that make sense?

[01-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Alright#0419
let's say you had 1000 PIRATE, and you need to pay it out to 3 people

[01-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Alright#0419
you would change the AcceptToMemoryPool rules on a node that is `-connect`ed to a vanilla node

[01-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Alright#0419
then you can send a raw tx using those 1000 transparent coins as inputs and have a single 0 sat output

[01-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Alright#0419
then next block it mines, you change the coinbase outputs and pay the miners their shares

[01-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Alright#0419
yep

[01-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Alright#0419
🤔 maybe

[01-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Alright#0419
hold on

obviously don't use this version, but any version of stratum-pool module will have something similar

[01-Sep-18 05:54 PM] Alright#0419
that's how it adds pool fee addresses

[01-Sep-18 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
wonder why pools wouldn't do that already

[01-Sep-18 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
must be a reason for it

[01-Sep-18 05:59 PM] Alright#0419
transparency is the opposite of what this chain is for :trollface:

[01-Sep-18 06:05 PM] Alright#0419
has me thinking.... how do we know pool ops don't make exceptions on their own pools so they can fake shares? 🤔

[01-Sep-18 06:06 PM] Alright#0419
kind of unrelated, but I imagine someone is already doing that

[01-Sep-18 06:06 PM] Alright#0419
essentially taking a higher fee without anyone being aware

[01-Sep-18 06:28 PM] scubapanda#2485
Run same hashrate on two different pools and compare results?

[01-Sep-18 07:07 PM] Alright#0419
Ah, the whole "pay out miners in the coinbase" thing is horribly insecure

[01-Sep-18 07:07 PM] Alright#0419
just realized someone can reorg the block, and take the coins

[01-Sep-18 07:09 PM] Alright#0419
well my proposed method of sending a transaction with 0 outputs and using the fees in the coinbase to pay miners

[01-Sep-18 07:09 PM] Alright#0419
if you could straight pay the miners in each coinbase, that would work, but that leads to other problems

[01-Sep-18 07:20 PM] Alright#0419
I'll show you an example, couple minutes

[01-Sep-18 07:20 PM] Alright#0419
but again, it's terribly insecure

[01-Sep-18 07:20 PM] Alright#0419
because if you someone reorged the block, they could take the coins

[01-Sep-18 07:20 PM] Alright#0419
yea, it's not a good way to do it

[01-Sep-18 07:23 PM] Alright#0419
well than you can't use the pay miner directly in the coinbase method either

[01-Sep-18 07:23 PM] Alright#0419
both would rely on the assumption that the pool will find another block

[01-Sep-18 07:23 PM] Alright#0419
as it would have to pay out shares of the previously found block, not the current one

[01-Sep-18 07:24 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[01-Sep-18 07:25 PM] Alright#0419
yep sounds like it

[01-Sep-18 07:26 PM] SHossain#0007
z addr payout is also good idea for this chain. USAGE

[01-Sep-18 07:27 PM] Alright#0419
solo mining is a good idea for this chain :trollface:
