Also, your view key isn;t long enough.

[11-Sep-18 02:55 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
It should look like this: "ZiVKe1SKhNjv2ewZXMDMnzzRwEKkna3hJoMXtwPoTcdQY61MKc3f8HWaavqDLtjEunk6ydR765T7bsPHA6rkBLYmeNgcwvbwL"

[11-Sep-18 02:57 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Or you could give me a real viewing key to play with. üòõ

[11-Sep-18 02:58 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Here is the import command: z_importviewingkey

[11-Sep-18 03:00 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Well... what are you waiting for? I could empty it out and try again but that wouldn't prove it.

[11-Sep-18 03:02 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
It is KMD. Should be empty.

[11-Sep-18 03:03 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
I just quickly ran komodod with default settings and brought up the cli.

[11-Sep-18 03:04 AM] Alright#0419
nou

[11-Sep-18 03:04 AM] Alright#0419
woah my staked KMD node forked?

[11-Sep-18 03:04 AM] Alright#0419
or is rejecting blocks

[11-Sep-18 03:05 AM] Alright#0419
well no, I just realized because I tried to run that

[11-Sep-18 03:06 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
So, any luck?

[11-Sep-18 03:09 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Also, the whenkeyisnew is optional.

It doesn't have any TX associated with it so I don't see the point of a rescan.

[11-Sep-18 03:11 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
komodo-cli z_importviewingkey "ZiVKe1SKhNjv2ewZXMDMnzzRwEKkna3hJoMXtwPoTcdQY61MKc3f8HWaavqDLtjEunk6ydR765T7bsPHA6rkBLYmeNgcwvbwL" no

Rescan from 0 is default, this should prevent that.

[11-Sep-18 03:13 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
@Alright, help! I need to prove a point! And I am stubborn so I can't go to sleep yet...

[11-Sep-18 03:14 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
That is the one. I have a snip of my CLI to prove it.

As long as someone paid you, why does it matter? :trollface:

[11-Sep-18 03:18 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Now I can sleep soundly.

[11-Sep-18 03:53 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Is pirate 200_9 or 210_9?

[11-Sep-18 03:53 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
I know KMD is 200_9, but wasn't sure is that meant PIRATE was as well.

[11-Sep-18 04:39 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
@webworker01, that is a lot of SOLs to just drop. I hop in and out, but I am not even at a ksol/sec. :P

[11-Sep-18 05:11 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
@webworker01, for me it is just more so because my laptop doubles as a mining rig so when I need to use it for something, I have to switch the mining off. Still 300 Sols/sec isn't too bad.

[11-Sep-18 05:13 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Also, found out the new EWBF doesn't support the KMD equihash variant.

[11-Sep-18 05:13 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Yup. They removed them.

[11-Sep-18 05:13 AM] Alright#0419
should be using PPLNT

[11-Sep-18 05:14 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
He said he may add it in an update but didn't focus on it because of the ASICS.

[11-Sep-18 05:15 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Also, IDK about the temp. It runs pretty hot just for gaming.

[11-Sep-18 05:18 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Did some digging, here is the standard GPU Temps for my laptop. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/5poh50/razer_blade_1060_safe_temps/

Lots of people run this particular laptop pretty hot. I have already undervalued the CPU though.

PPLNT any info on it?   and what are the other options when running a mining pool?   for a pirate article.

[11-Sep-18 11:12 AM] Flexatron#8809
Good

[11-Sep-18 12:02 PM] abcd#1803
Those NH spikes are caused by the bots manipulating the orderbooks

[11-Sep-18 12:02 PM] Flexatron#8809
Ah

[11-Sep-18 12:02 PM] abcd#1803
Usually anyways.. in this case, I do believe it‚Äôs a user with a 1mhs order

[11-Sep-18 12:02 PM] Flexatron#8809
Im a NH newb

[11-Sep-18 12:02 PM] abcd#1803
Oh god.. they‚Äôre greedy bastards

[11-Sep-18 12:03 PM] abcd#1803
Worked very well until the bot API crap

[11-Sep-18 12:03 PM] Alright#0419
still works fine if you actually realize what the bots are doing

[11-Sep-18 12:05 PM] wookie#7663
does anyone know what's the expected sols for a 1080TI? I just want to make sure I have it close to optimal

[11-Sep-18 12:05 PM] Alright#0419
~700sols

[11-Sep-18 12:06 PM] wookie#7663
Thanks. That's what I get ~695-705. What about a 1060 3gb?

[11-Sep-18 12:06 PM] Alright#0419
no idea

[11-Sep-18 12:10 PM] wookie#7663
ok. thanks.

[11-Sep-18 12:14 PM] Flexatron#8809
Difficulty dropped below 2M

[11-Sep-18 12:18 PM] Flexatron#8809
5Q and 4T were like, yo lets both spend less money

[11-Sep-18 12:18 PM] Flexatron#8809
For the same result

[11-Sep-18 12:18 PM] abcd#1803
hahaha

[11-Sep-18 12:18 PM] abcd#1803
4t had 1.2msols yesterday

[11-Sep-18 12:19 PM] abcd#1803
1080ti can do 740khs, but optimal efficiency is received at 60-75% tdp depending on model

[11-Sep-18 12:20 PM] Flexatron#8809
Whats the conversion to sol?

[11-Sep-18 12:20 PM] abcd#1803
Lyrarev2 for example on a evga ftw3 uses 60%, sc2 uses 65% for same power draw and hashrate ‚Äúroughly‚Äù

[11-Sep-18 12:21 PM] abcd#1803
Sorry 740 sols

[11-Sep-18 12:21 PM] Flexatron#8809
Khs = sols?

[11-Sep-18 12:21 PM] abcd#1803
Which is 740hs I believe

[11-Sep-18 12:21 PM] Flexatron#8809
Ah

[11-Sep-18 12:21 PM] abcd#1803
0.74khs

[11-Sep-18 12:22 PM] abcd#1803
You have 1080ti mining?

[11-Sep-18 12:22 PM] abcd#1803
You don‚Äôt want to mine equihash if that‚Äôs the case.

[11-Sep-18 12:23 PM] abcd#1803
Get the software bios mod for 1080ti and ethhash becomes 40% more profitable?

[11-Sep-18 12:23 PM] abcd#1803
Even then, I think lyrarev2 is slightly more profitable than ethhash

[11-Sep-18 12:27 PM] wookie#7663
if electricity is not a cost, would you still recommend ethhash?

[11-Sep-18 12:28 PM] wookie#7663
I can't get my 1080ti to 740. I'm at 100% power, 69-70degrees, -15core, +820memory

[11-Sep-18 07:35 PM] scubapanda#2485
Whaaat, what about KMD/Pirate? "   Sapling Turnstile

To audit existing shielded ZEC, we‚Äôve implemented a process we call the Sapling turnstile. Users will be required to send funds held in old Sprout shielded addresses to transparent addresses before sending to new Sapling shielded addresses. There will be no way to send ZEC directly between Sprout and Sapling shielded addresses."

[11-Sep-18 07:41 PM] scubapanda#2485
I especially like the Pirate part where you are required: "to send funds held in old Sprout shielded addresses to transparent addresses".
