[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `having an exchange in a completely different market (in this case Hong Kong) gives us more visibility`
so, file it under the marketing budget üòõ

[29-Oct-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> Im totally for the listing - just let those who voted to tip for the listing üòõ

[29-Oct-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> 0.5 BTC / 20 people said yes = 0.025 BTC per voter = cinema ticket

[29-Oct-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `in reality we can estimate more like twitter users devided by 100`
except that twatter is far more a western thing, so if any exchange is mostly folks in the east then that whole concept breaks down

[29-Oct-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> guestimations are guestimations - it's never 100% user base is active every day

[29-Oct-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> dividing by 100 give more realistic feel for order of daily users active

[29-Oct-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> maybe we should devide by 1000 or 777 idk, but somehow I 100 seems fine to me

[29-Oct-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `dividing by 100 give more realistic feel for order of daily users active`
if, and only if, their user base uses the random social media platform you picked out of thin air ü§∑üèΩ

[29-Oct-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> Similarweb gives a decent estimation imo

[29-Oct-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> divide it by WeChat users and you flip everything around

[29-Oct-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> I voted no because I'm guessing they can't handle the z_addr wallet and I know nothing of the company.

[29-Oct-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> Yes, at least they say they can take your moneys at will. `Hubi does not assume any responsibility for this and you will bear any direct or indirect losses and adverse consequences arising therefrom.`

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `at least they say they can take your moneys at will. `
No, they say they can *keep* the funds *you already gave them ownership of* "at will" (once you send it, it's not yours anymore)
I so wish more people understood how banking actually works....

[29-Oct-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Let me also quote my response to a similar conversation in Verus Discord. Replace VRSC with ARRR and it applies here:
>>> `Once top exchange and on cmc there should be volume`
People will need to have a reason to buy VRSC. Just being visible doesn't cut it. 
(In stores I see plenty of lady hygiene products... I don't have any reason to buy them, but they are visible)

[29-Oct-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> imo first arrr application will be lite wallet with private messaging - a real reason to buy arrr, as you wont get such thing anywhere else

[29-Oct-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ üë¥üèºüì¢ Good to know.

[29-Oct-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> imagine mobile phone with arrr messanger

[29-Oct-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> ` first arrr application will be lite wallet with private messaging`
yay, I don't have to be involved :trollface:

[29-Oct-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> What's the reason to buy half the coins out there in the top 100 in cmc?

[29-Oct-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `What's the reason to buy half the coins out there in the top 100 in cmc?`
The lemming effect (FOMO)

[29-Oct-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> top 100 cmc is many icos and manipulated trades so the comparison makes no sense since we try to compete on highly unfair market

[29-Oct-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> and that

[29-Oct-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> I've checked bytom for example that had a decent pump 2 days ago

[29-Oct-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> 30% premine

[29-Oct-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> when dev controll most coins and want to manipulate - it's easy

[29-Oct-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> but I appreciate KMD ecosystem does not do it

[29-Oct-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> If there were any real "reason" for the top 100, BTC wouldn't be 18x the price (or noticeably) of the next highest price

[29-Oct-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Here's my issue. I feel like even if the listing price was .25 BTC, we would have exactly the same conversation with any smaller exchange. The problem is, we're need 2 main things for pirate: Marketing and Exposure. Exchanges can provide both. Our "reason" for people to buy ARRR is clear: we're the most private coin out there and we have more outlets to actually use our currency than most other coins, which are continually being built on.  If I were to suggest raising .5 btc for marketing, I guarantee more people would be against that because there are less of a guarantee of results than listing in an exchange that's primarily used in a market we aren't present in.

[29-Oct-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> OK, let me ask this:
Once I buy ARRR, from some exchange that I have to give my personal info to, what can I do with it besides buying trinkets?

[29-Oct-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> Go boating?

[29-Oct-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `Go boating?`
But I cannot use it to get to that boat

[29-Oct-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> ``Once I buy ARRR, from some exchange that I have to give my personal info to, what can I do with it besides buying trinkets?``
Once I buy *insert most other coins*, from some exchange that I have to give my personal info to, what can I do with it ~~besides buying trinkets?~~ at all?

[29-Oct-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> @Draeth you're almost beginning to see my point üôÉ

[29-Oct-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> Utility needs to be the primary focus, else it just becomes another random commodity

[29-Oct-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> We're continually building a list of stores and services.  We're actively working on this. Utility is built over time, that doesn't mean we shouldn't market it

[29-Oct-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> As much as I despise toy PCs, at least @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã's suggestion is *some* utility

[29-Oct-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Define utility

[29-Oct-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> once atomicDEX supports zaddr swaps, ARRR utility becomes the largest trustless mixer for all the supported coins

[29-Oct-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `Utility is built over time, that doesn't mean we shouldn't market it`
then wait to spend money on marketing a thing and not just an "empty" brand (and yes I realize where I stand in the picture of price value)

[29-Oct-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> i think that is sufficient

[29-Oct-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> for rather large value

[29-Oct-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `for rather large value`
indeed, but that (imo) shits on the bed with the idea of spending gobs of currency on listing on CEXs ü§∑üèΩ

[29-Oct-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> also ARRR is on CMC, we have a couple of reliable exchanges. unless you can get onto one of the top 10 actual volume exchanges, anything else is almost certain to be of very little impact. even a top 10 actual volume exchange wont do much without the demand side

[29-Oct-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> get a listing on one of those 10, or dont waste time and money

[29-Oct-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> being listed on CEX is not mutually exclusive with being the largest privacy pool in existence

[29-Oct-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> wen polo?

[29-Oct-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> but we are on CMC and have a couple reliable exchanges. that is sufficient

[29-Oct-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> most of the real volume exchanges are old time exchanges born before the fake volume craze

[29-Oct-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Have you ever applied to any exchanges?

[29-Oct-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> i havent

[29-Oct-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> it is totally ridiculous now, most exchanges have so little real volumes, they know they will never make money from trading fees, so they make up some giant number of users/trading volumes to get projects to pay them X BTC

[29-Oct-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> and THAT is their revenue model

[29-Oct-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> The biggest ones, including the ones you listed in that article, ask "what exchanges are you listed on" expecting to see a decent amount of exchanges,  as well as some well known ones. They also ask "what first rate sites has your coin been posted about", asking if we have marketee ourselves and gotten noticed by big news sites.

Also, half of those exchanges that were listed in that article wont list us because there is no company behind pirate

[29-Oct-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> the fact that CEX requires a company to list an open source project, illustrates exactly what is wrong with the picture

[29-Oct-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> better work toward getting mentioned on first rate sites, than CEX

[29-Oct-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> CEX is waste of time and money

[29-Oct-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> ZatomicDEX will create the massive usecase for ARRR

[29-Oct-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> While true, that doesn't negate the fact that the overwhelming majority of users use CEXs

[29-Oct-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> BTC -> ARRR -> BTC

[29-Oct-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> the market will be people using centralized BTC mixers, not traders using CEX

[29-Oct-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> So t-addresses will have to be brought back to pirate to enable atomicdex?

[29-Oct-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> only atomicDEX taddress that is in a z -> t destination will be enabled

[29-Oct-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> this will create a bit of privacy leakage but if you trade with a dedicated trading address and never with your main zaddrs, it will be sufficiently private. also, such a z->t leakage will be MUCH less than is leaking via CEX

[29-Oct-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Finality> Wonder if holding just 1000will be a huge thing by end of next year

[29-Oct-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> it is a compromise, but now that the anon set of PIRATE is so big, i think we can allow a specific type of z->t transactions for atomic swaps. The net result is that the BTC that was swapped for the ARRR is now in some new BTC address and arguably more private than it was before. The ARRR that is swapped for BTC got their via a z->t and t->z, so it is a bit less private, but that ARRR is much more private than the BTC it was swapped for. The BTC is of course fully transparent, so this tradeoff is a gain of liquidity for the ARRR side and gain of privacy for the BTC side

[29-Oct-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> compared to any centralized mixing service or even decentralized mixing service, it will be orders of magnitude superior

[29-Oct-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> @Finality probably 10% of portfolio in ARRR is not a bad amount to have, allocations should be  based on overall porfolio value, so if you have $300 worth of crypto, 1000 ARRR is not a bad amount to have

[29-Oct-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> damn its good when jl777 is here

[29-Oct-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> @jl777c any ETA on atomicdex zaddr swaps?

[29-Oct-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> So the biggest difference to zec, which is already on atomicdex, is the size of the anon set?

[29-Oct-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> ..and the fact that you can only use t-address for the swap I guess?

[29-Oct-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptoon> Dont forget dPoW

[29-Oct-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptoon> Not sure about zec blocktime

[29-Oct-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> Good point, 51% might be an issue for zec some day!

[29-Oct-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> i offered a 100,000 ARRR bounty for the mm2 team to get zaddr swaps completed. it is competing with other priorities and maybe they can start implementation end of this year. if people want to contribute to the ZatomicDEX bounty, maybe it will spur them to get it done faster

[29-Oct-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <CHMEX> I add 40,000 ARRR to that

[29-Oct-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> @mrlynch please make an address for ZatomicDEX bounty

[29-Oct-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> Nice! I hope it happens soon. Is it going to be available on mobiledex or only computers running full nodes?

[29-Oct-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> fullnode support first. most all the atomic swap is in taddr space, so normal SPV server would work for that, but constructing the z->t and t->z transaction would require the zksnark code. maybe nSPV mode can be used to construct the z transactions, but that wont be the initial implementation.

[29-Oct-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> So should we start a fund for marketing and stop applying to exchanges not on that list?

[29-Oct-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> How much funds has Pirate got at the moment?

[29-Oct-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> That's a @mrlynch question

[29-Oct-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> most of crypto media is paid placement, so it could be that funds are needed to get on the top sites. then again, maybe not. why to waste time and money on exchanges that dont add any value?

[29-Oct-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Because what's the point of building a product that nobody knows exists

[29-Oct-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> PIRATE has only very limited funds it relies on community to donate funds or time to achieve the results needed

[29-Oct-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> @Draeth how does getting on an exchange that nobody you know actually uses? you consider that pointful?

[29-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> maybe only 12 people actually use these fake volume exchanges

[29-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> <http://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RBAX5wJmu3VzR7iPyb5wxAdrqvgwn5y43z> <- notary node dev fund donations

[29-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> how does that help in any way?

[29-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> That's a flawed statement

[29-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> there are mining donations as well from some pirate pools that amount to some 2k / month maybe

[29-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> I dont know anyone that uses kraken

[29-Oct-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Should we list there?

[29-Oct-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> i know people that use kraken

[29-Oct-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> people actually use kraken

[29-Oct-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> and community donations from some members that choose to remain private, however it's not a big amount and we have to choose wisely on what we spend

[29-Oct-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
