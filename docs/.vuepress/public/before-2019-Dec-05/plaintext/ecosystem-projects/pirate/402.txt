[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> is there any guide to setting up a fullnode?

[18-Nov-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> I thought fullnode was something different than just a wallet? surely most people keep their arrr in one of these?

[18-Nov-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <polycryptoblog> Yes because lite client hasn’t been out long

[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> jl777c  said above fullnode is immune to hacking

If your privacy model has a medium anonymity set, it really has a small anonymity set. If your privacy model has a small anonymity set, it has an anonymity set of 1. Only global anonymity sets (eg. as done with ZK-SNARKs) are truly robustly secure. https://t.co/VduwqrbMfs

[19-Nov-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> apparently grins position is that since this is a known issue, it doesnt matter? granted they have plans to mitigate this, but fundamentally the way MW works is by combining tx into a block. that combined with needed to interact with anybody that sends you funds, even if all the linkages are broken via fancy methods, a dust attack would seem to really bypass any defense.

[19-Nov-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> maybe there is some new solution that will solve this, but it is like waiting for ETH to properly scale. might be a long wait

Whats the point of selling/releasing an non private coin as a private one ? It's even worst to know . One day maybe they will deliver a privacy coin, but Its maybe and its not for now at least.
