Ahoy mateys.. is nicehash worth getting some hash from?

[30-Oct-18 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
if you accept that prices aren't comparable to 2 days ago because BTC dropped $200

[30-Oct-18 12:21 PM] Flexatron#8809
you mean the sell prices here right genie

[30-Oct-18 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
no, I mean that BTC dropped in value, which means that a "savings" on current nh prices vs 2 days ago nh prices might not be any actual "savings"

[30-Oct-18 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
depending on the math, it might cost more

[30-Oct-18 12:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
Well i have some btc to test with. Just want to see if it's worth it short term or if i'm better off getting more asics

[30-Oct-18 12:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
Need to stash more pirate :D

[30-Oct-18 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
you're always better off owning more than you rent üòâ

[30-Oct-18 12:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
I plan on getting more asics for pirate anyway but it's going to be a few more weeks to bank roll it

[30-Oct-18 12:26 PM] house#8741
looking at current differential with million solutions per sec vs NH cost per ... looks pretty avg to good entry point considering last 24hrs

[30-Oct-18 12:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
Cool. Thanks! Now i have to figure out the best way to place orders on nh

[30-Oct-18 12:30 PM] house#8741
factor in also this block of time that we would call 'earlybird'
take a good look at the solid base we've formed ... I can only assume that this is only going higher

[30-Oct-18 12:31 PM] Flexatron#8809
22.5% throught the 256 arrr blocks now

[30-Oct-18 12:33 PM] house#8741
blah, blah, blah inflation rate ... blah, blah emission .. .blah not sustainable
Imho, this is THE most secure ... most privacy centric coin that will be available for some time to come ...

[30-Oct-18 12:34 PM] house#8741
plus ... we have blackbeard ... who I know very well does not do things half heartedly

[30-Oct-18 12:34 PM] house#8741
If you are in now ... I expect you will be here for a while

[30-Oct-18 12:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
I'm all in on Pirate, don't get me wrong. Bought asics specifically for this. Saw voskcoin do a review on YT on it, checked the project and liked it... a lot :)

[30-Oct-18 12:35 PM] Flexatron#8809

too many shitcoin pump and dumps lately, arrrrrr

[30-Oct-18 12:54 PM] BlockTech#6895
That's Ominous, all those shitcoin getting traction, is a sign of the market not being ready for a Bull rally.

This pirate ship cannot dock to standart exchanges?

[30-Oct-18 01:25 PM] Flexatron#8809
no arrr, arrr needs special anchors to be able to dock arrr

because of the delay probably

[30-Oct-18 02:52 PM] scubapanda#2485
Pirate is getting expensive if this growth continues üòâ Will be a time for a toast when we make it to 10% of Zcash hash.

[30-Oct-18 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
strange thing is price appears to be stable

[30-Oct-18 02:54 PM] Exile13#4458
Conversion Rate is 1KMD = 7.1429 PIRATE. 1 PIRATE = 0.14 KMD

[30-Oct-18 02:57 PM] scubapanda#2485
I also have no idea how much equihash one can rent from NH without pushing the price up a lot.

[30-Oct-18 02:57 PM] BlockTech#6895
Price is probably stable because of your "2M" buy order at 0,1KMD. It gives kind of a bottom to the price, otherwise i'm pretty sure we would see a price range between 0,06-0,15KMD each.

[30-Oct-18 02:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
An exchange is going to help the price I think after a short term dump.

[30-Oct-18 02:59 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Are we still expecting a market today on Digi price ?
