`85% shielded is easy to market. 99% sells itself`
Your math is off or old. That addy is 7.8% of current supply

[05-Oct-18 04:19 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
good, so sounds like we are in agreement. 100% of the 85% of TOTAL supply is shielded 😉

[05-Oct-18 04:19 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
lol

[05-Oct-18 04:19 AM] FishyGuts#5085
There are other addresses with coins showing.

[05-Oct-18 04:19 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yesterday it was 85%

[05-Oct-18 04:20 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yeah I know, I feel you all.   This is easy from a privacy standpoint.    Just gotta make materials to share with the public.

[05-Oct-18 04:21 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
lol, ok. I am starting to feel for fishy!

[05-Oct-18 04:21 AM] FishyGuts#5085
As petty as that sounds, I appreciate the verbiage clarification.

[05-Oct-18 04:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`coins are not shielded, there is no coins in the bitcoin protocol, only transactions and utxos`
That looks like some shit that @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 asshole would write

We’ve certainly gone off on a tangent too.

[05-Oct-18 04:21 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Haha yeah.   Sounds petty but accuracy is important in these things.

[05-Oct-18 04:22 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I’m glad to have y’all sharing this stuff

[05-Oct-18 04:22 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
Just keep in mind that 100% of coinbase transactions are transaprent, so the only difference between that top  address is the amount of time since the last TX to a zaddress

[05-Oct-18 04:22 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Don’t worry @Deleted User they will show up when they realize we have the better privacy protocol.

[05-Oct-18 04:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@mountaindrifter exactly, I have the explorer on a auto-refresh tab showing my mining addy so I can see the running total of all the coins I've ever mined

[05-Oct-18 04:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"Final Balance" is usually less than 3k but the total still shows

[05-Oct-18 04:30 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
So at the core of bitcoin I feel like what makes it work is everybody operating in their own self interest... If we want to have coinbase transactions shielded as quickly as possible and not held in a transparent address, maybe we can come up with a way to reward people for making a transaction within a certain amunt of time rather than a time-lock loss. It might be an interesting exercise as I am not aware of any other chains that do this so it would be another unique feature of pirate.  It would be very interesting to see how it works out.  We have Masternodes, staking, interest etc...but no reward for shielding. Maybe something like reward a full coinbase utxo transaction with 1% of the amount if transacted to a zaddr withing XX blocks of when it was mined? It would increase the total supply and emission, but would be very interesting aspect as the halvings progress

[05-Oct-18 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[05-Oct-18 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ike how the KMD intrest works... but just T->Z is 1% larger..

[05-Oct-18 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But you have to block list notary address from said rule

[05-Oct-18 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise they can create as many coins as they like

[05-Oct-18 04:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or ban notary address from making Z transactions all together... so notary address cna ONLY do T TX.

[05-Oct-18 04:33 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
seems if thought was put in to it, it would be rather easily solvable to make happen. The interesting thing is since it is a feature of the reward system it would be a constant remonder/advertisment that tx's are shielded on pirate

[05-Oct-18 04:33 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
Iis there any reason a notary must make shielded transactions?

[05-Oct-18 04:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notary is opposite to everyone else... 🤔  that actually works IMO.

[05-Oct-18 04:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no notary never has to make a sheild TX

[05-Oct-18 04:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as it can send to itself...

[05-Oct-18 04:34 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
Then it seems it is alogical rule anyway

[05-Oct-18 04:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and receiv coins from someone to get PIRATE to spend to notarise

[05-Oct-18 04:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it all seems like a shit load of pointless work to hide 0.998976% of the total supply just because it "looks like" 15% early on

[05-Oct-18 04:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nothig stops someone else from mining millions and not sheilding

[05-Oct-18 04:36 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
meh, not rally about existing, IMO, more as a interesting excersice going forward and to promote pirates privacy. I wouldnt say it would be to resolve anything existing. Though I would say if it is ever implemented at whatever block height that the rule allows existing coinbase UTXO  to be sent within x time

[05-Oct-18 04:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure it would apply to old utxo, seems hard to code...

[05-Oct-18 04:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it would be a height activated chainge applying to any utxo mined after that block

[05-Oct-18 04:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`nothig stops someone else from mining millions and not sheilding`
nothing stops you from not worrying about what someone else is doing :trollface:

[05-Oct-18 04:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im just thinking... and saying whats possibel

[05-Oct-18 04:38 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
seems it would just be a one time check if block height is above XX and below XX

[05-Oct-18 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a thaught experiment... this is how the best ideas come about

[05-Oct-18 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pirate exists from such a discussion

[05-Oct-18 04:38 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
I agree ith you 100% blackjok3r...more just thinking out loud and is an interesting thought experiment

[05-Oct-18 04:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
also, who is this jackwagon that you think is going to spend $35k just to mine some and let them sit there?

[05-Oct-18 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that really doesnt matter who it is,... the fact they can do it.... is all I was saying 🤷

[05-Oct-18 04:40 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
So if miners are moining to get coins, it seems very logical that they would send the coinbase to a zaddr to get the additional reward. This in fact would be the interesting experiment to see how it works in the wild

[05-Oct-18 04:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, they *can* and every day it would cost them more to do so and mean less if they did

[05-Oct-18 04:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
talking about this?

[05-Oct-18 04:40 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
and if they don't it is ok as it is alowed by the paremeters to let it sit forever in a taddr

[05-Oct-18 04:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[05-Oct-18 04:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

why not try cracking it?

[05-Oct-18 04:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
