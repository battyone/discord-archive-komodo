Nobody was mining it until I started. I think it was stopped on block 20909

[10-Dec-18 04:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I'm about to bump the difficulty for a bit, testing GPU's

[10-Dec-18 04:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's what it's for 👍🏽

[10-Dec-18 04:56 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Any idea why I'd keep getting ```(Thread 1) We thought a block was found but it was rejected by the daemon, share data:```

[10-Dec-18 04:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you're getting valid, accepted blocks as well then it's because you're hashrate is high enough in relation to the diff that you're creating multiple valid blocks before starting on the next and that will stop as the diff rises

[10-Dec-18 04:58 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm not finding any blocks actually

[10-Dec-18 04:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then it's probably because you're not creating valid blocks

[10-Dec-18 04:59 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I've not seen that before. This is the coin daemon error
```2018-12-10 04:59:15 ERROR: ContextualCheckTransaction: overwinter is active

Not sure what he did with/to that, I haven't looked at it; mine's an snomp fork

[10-Dec-18 05:01 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah okay. Have you seen this before at all?

[10-Dec-18 05:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, it means that the pool is trying to create the wrong type of block (sprout)

if you sync to it with the wrong timestamp in the code, likely you will need to totally resync with the right timestamp

[10-Dec-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise I see it just get stuck

[11-Dec-18 10:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@stevemassive have you earned 256 more in the last 24 hrs?

[11-Dec-18 10:28 PM] stevemassive#3034
not yet

[11-Dec-18 10:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then yes, it's normal for you to not get a transaction paying you less than the minimum payout

[11-Dec-18 10:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I think if we get more eyes on the exchange, Pirate, Verus and other KMD projects listed there will naturally grow as more potential investors have eyes on it

Cryptopia has 0.05 BTC volume right now for KoMoDo, meanwhile DigitalPrice exchange has 0.35 BTC volume, 7x more! :yassinheart: :shexy: :treasure: :rum:

Pretty sure Komodo and it’s projects, Arrr and vrsc have been digital prices big players.   I never saw th exchange before October but I assume it was the same.

[13-Dec-18 03:48 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Now we’re at 3BTC daily and have been at least 2 daily since launch with them.

why pirate pool shows pirate and arr coins?

[15-Dec-18 10:00 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Should only show ARRR

[15-Dec-18 10:01 AM] Acura#2748
freshly mined pirates are on a visible adress

[15-Dec-18 10:06 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Because Pirate is the sprout pool. ARRR is the sapling pool

[15-Dec-18 02:58 PM] flo0#0517
hello I mined 20 pirate in the new adrees zs, is passed 2 hours but I can't see it in my agama walett
what is happening?

[15-Dec-18 03:09 PM] SHossain#0007
probably the pool payment processor didn't run yet to send your funds. you will get your funds when the payment from pool is done

[15-Dec-18 03:09 PM] SHossain#0007
better also post which pool you are mining in. so, pool operator can try to help

[15-Dec-18 03:51 PM] SHossain#0007

without checking reply on any channel you have been posting same question again. that is not recommended

[15-Dec-18 03:54 PM] SHossain#0007
if you are mining on piratepool.io get in touch with @webworker01 . he is the pool operator of that pool and can answer your question accurately

[15-Dec-18 04:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

you can't mine 20 pirate
you have submitted enough shares to earn 20 pirate when the pool you mine for pays you that 20 pirate (payout minimums and frequencies are decided by each individual pool)`
