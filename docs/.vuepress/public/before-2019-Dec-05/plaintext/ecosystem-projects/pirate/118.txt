zkSNARKs in a nutshell
The possibilities of zkSNARKs are impressive, you can verify the correctness of computations without having to execute them and you will not even learn what was executed - just that it was done correctly. Unfortunately, most explanations of zkSNARKs resort to hand-waving at s...

the most impressive thing about pirate is its simplest explanation.
what is does: 100% encrypted private transactions. Most anonymous cryptocurrency in industry.
how secure it is?: As secure as Bitcoin, thanks to delayed Proof of Work.

[05-Oct-18 09:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
only 2 points to explain 😄

[05-Oct-18 09:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
of course explaining on further of these 2 points is more explanation

[05-Oct-18 09:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yep.   The product is not complicated.

`The possibilities of zkSNARKs are impressive, you can verify the correctness of computations without having to execute them and you will not even learn what was executed - just that it was done correctly.` that probably is the key sentence from above blog article

[05-Oct-18 09:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Explaining why it is private is a little more complex.

[05-Oct-18 09:25 AM] 0x03#8822
now how to explain that to an average joe

[05-Oct-18 09:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Naw... did you see my “how to teach a blind man colors” explanation?

[05-Oct-18 09:26 AM] 0x03#8822
nope

Let me get on my keyboard I’ll save it this time.

`The hashrate has another 30-40 Mh before it’s roughly equally profitable to mine KMD and I expect a drop in growth at that point.`
@FishyGuts What imaginary hole did you pull that number out of?

[05-Oct-18 09:27 AM] FishyGuts#5085
napkin math based on my returns and what to mines projected returns on kmd

[05-Oct-18 09:27 AM] FishyGuts#5085
VERY accurate and scientific methods.  You wouldn't understand.

[05-Oct-18 09:28 AM] 0x03#8822
napkin math = best math

[05-Oct-18 09:28 AM] 0x03#8822
it's true

[05-Oct-18 09:28 AM] 0x03#8822

[05-Oct-18 09:28 AM] 0x03#8822
*scnr*

[05-Oct-18 09:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so we should get ready for 100 kmd = 1 pirate ? 😃

@grewalsatinder yes please 😛

[05-Oct-18 09:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
when I started bidding on buying pirate I said:
1 KMD = 1000 PIRATE 😅

[05-Oct-18 09:30 AM] 0x03#8822
actually the very first trades i remember were 1:1

[05-Oct-18 09:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it'd be so amzaing to see the opposite sometime in future 😄

[05-Oct-18 09:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
1000 KMD = 1 PIRATE 😅

[05-Oct-18 09:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
one can at least dream

[05-Oct-18 09:31 AM] 0x03#8822
so please, fingers crossed

[05-Oct-18 09:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I haven't even calculated what it will buy me :abusedsmily:

[05-Oct-18 09:32 AM] FishyGuts#5085
ZK snarks works like this: 

Give a blind person 2 balls of the exact same size, shape and weight, but two different colors.
Have them hold the balls behind their back and then show you one.   
Have them put the balls behind their back again and switch them, or not.
You can tell the blind man if he switched them correctly each time no matter what he does.
Do it enough times and it's not coincidence. 
He doesn't know how or why but he knows you're right.    

That is an analog version of a zero knowledge proof.

🤓 👌 

[05-Oct-18 09:32 AM] 0x03#8822
what is a 'correct switch' of the balls?

[05-Oct-18 09:34 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Doesn't matter... You always know if he switched them or not and he always knows that you know without seeing it.

[05-Oct-18 09:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 You're right.  I pulled out a calculator and guesstimated.   We have to about 300MH/s until it's about as equal to mine KMD.... at .25 per pirate.

[05-Oct-18 09:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
"about"

[05-Oct-18 09:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
300 Msol/s.... :trollface: piece of cake.... for pirates :trollface:

[05-Oct-18 09:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Over time, if you apply 30M sols to KMD you will profit far more that if you apply that same 30M sols to PIRATE
👆🏼 assumes no other changes than the effect of the 30M

[05-Oct-18 09:37 AM] FishyGuts#5085
This is a fact too.

`Computer Genie is here to make coin, not friends.`
@FishyGuts I'm moving this from otc to here as to not clog up offers
It's not about friends or profits.
What @And1_89 is doing by trying to undercut onboarding is silly and counterproductive for *the* coin, not for *my* coinage (I'll still be here long after his sale)

[05-Oct-18 10:18 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Oh I hear you.  I was making a joke.

When the tipbot is done, I will tip you.

🤔 yes I understand

[05-Oct-18 10:23 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I'm going to make it active on reddit if possible so we can tipbot people in monero threads with ARRR.

[05-Oct-18 10:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Not sure how much that would cost but the dogecoin tipbot was how I first heard about doge.

[05-Oct-18 10:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
What are your thoughts fellow sea dogs?

[05-Oct-18 10:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
does reddit even allow tipbots anymore w/o kyc?

[05-Oct-18 10:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
ooooo didn't even consider that.  Was there some sort of issue?

[05-Oct-18 10:26 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I think I see bcash tipbots

[05-Oct-18 10:26 AM] mato121#5963
ark tip bot is working on reddit

[05-Oct-18 10:26 AM] mato121#5963
so i think reddit still allow tip bots

[05-Oct-18 10:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah then do it

as insular as most projects seem to be that may be viewed as an affront. a true pirate tactic

Yeah I was kidding about doing it in Monero threads. 😛

[05-Oct-18 10:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_shouldn't have watched them the 1st time 🤦🏼_

[05-Oct-18 10:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Fun fact: 
Harry Potter series gave is in development Privacy Tech: MimbleWimble and Grin project
Pirates of the Carribean series gave is the in production Privacy tech: zk-SNARKS based assetchain PIRATE from Komodo Platform

[05-Oct-18 10:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Only talking about names etc.

As I understand from ummjackson video on his privacy monero vs zcash and others talk, he doesn't favour neither Monero nor Zcash.

[05-Oct-18 10:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
his end remarks most towards Grin

[05-Oct-18 10:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Is that the dude I wanted to pay people to slap every time he made air quotes?

[05-Oct-18 10:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess so, don't remember that chat. didn't follow all 😄

[05-Oct-18 10:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Monero has ringCT which he explained has a big giant pool to do coin mixing and very difficult to de-anonymise  participants. But it's coin mixing, with strong mixing mechanism. and good number of anon tx.
Zcash he says is all absolute encryption, and a near wizardly magic anonymisation (I'm just describing in my words, not exactly his words). but zcash has big dataset for z tx, and with zk-STARKS that is compressed but still isn't much of an effect?? don't remember his comments on zk-STARKS....

[05-Oct-18 10:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in the end he talked about Grin light weight implementation of MimbleWimble

@ummjackson Thanks for sharing the vid link. Very well explained overview of @monero and @zcashco
The vid doesn't cover the exact answer to my question, but sounds like a 100% #zkSNARKS tx blockchain a bad idea to you, as I summed up from your point of view. Would like to ...
