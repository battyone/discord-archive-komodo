@blackbeard Why do people always think I'm scam. I've sold Arrr for you. Why do not you send KMD for me

[28-Oct-18 08:10 AM] Mr. HashEm#3357

[28-Oct-18 08:11 AM] blackbeard#8888
Mr @Mr. HashEm - Jest show us yer screenshot trade that went askew and ye shall lay claim ta this 'ere plunder. Do we 'ave an accord ?

@blackbeard I want to ask you about the exchange between us. I sent Arrr for you. But you do not send KMD for me that continually says I'm scam. Do you want to take my coin number ???

[28-Oct-18 08:26 AM] blackbeard#8888
Mr @Aleck99  ... ye shall be detained until further notice!

@blackbeard It is injustice. I have to sell Arrr to pay for the rental cost. So you do so.

[28-Oct-18 08:33 AM] house#8741
Jeeez ... that was f@#&ing satisfying 🤣

[28-Oct-18 08:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Aleck99 , @blackbeard asked you for proof of your transaction, untill you prove you sent anything to Cap'n blackbeard, us mates may rightly assume you are full of shite

No, it's not rocket science just drag the images in the imgur screen

if you are smart enough to mine coins, then this should be a walk in the park.

[28-Oct-18 09:51 AM] CHMEX#0686
It's intresting looks like most people have NH orders set to 0.05 - 0.059 BTC / MSOL / Day
as soon as the standard rate goes above the 0.06 BTC / MSOLS / day the PIRATE hashrate dropps

[28-Oct-18 09:55 AM] Flexatron#8809
Noticed that as well when I was still mining

[28-Oct-18 09:55 AM] penguin#0544

[28-Oct-18 11:11 AM] Aleck99#4468
@blackbeard I did not pretend. You can check if I cheated on anyone under the name holloman900. I see the name or the place, not deceiving anyone

[28-Oct-18 11:12 AM] Aleck99#4468
Am I not named like another?

[28-Oct-18 11:13 AM] Aleck99#4468
