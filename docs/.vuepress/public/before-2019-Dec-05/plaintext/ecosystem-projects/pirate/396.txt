[dscrd-prt] <wookie25> You can't see the txn based on just txhash, that's the beauty of Pirate's privacy. No public display of addresses or transactions. 
If the issue is that someone said they sent you some ARRR but you didn't receive it, and you want to confirm it, then you need the viewkey from the other party.

[dscrd-prt] <lc123456> other question

[15-Nov-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <lc123456> use rpc api very slowly

[15-Nov-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <lc123456> how to deal it?

[15-Nov-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> for a high volume (number of addresses * number of tx) i strongly suggest separating the deposit handling from the withdraw handling. assuming deposited funds are swept to the zaddr on the withdraw node, then the withdraw node only has a single zaddr to deal with and will be N times faster. with zcash, EVERY zaddr in the wallet needs to try to decrypt EVERY transaction it sees, to see if it is destined for that address or not.
that at least will make withdraw processing a lot faster and solves that side of things. on the deposit side, whatever hardware is being used will be performant for X number of zaddr, above a certain point it will likely become very slow, the only way i know to keep it performant is to limit the zaddr per node. it doesnt matter if a zaddr is actually used or not, if it is in the wallet, it must be scanned

[15-Nov-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <lc123456> but withdrawal will not increase new address to wallet

[15-Nov-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> yes, that is why it will continue to be fast
