yes, that would help, but would snitch if it came down to being his/her ass

[10-Oct-18 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
had 2KG of organic tobacco deliered once ... just in a box and platic shopping bags smelt crazy ... still no idea how it worked like that 😂

[10-Oct-18 11:30 AM] snowdamn#2414
tobacco is illegal in Oceania? WTF?

[10-Oct-18 11:30 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Jazz cabbage or just tobacco?

[10-Oct-18 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wish you could still buy the organic tobacco... since I got that, and sold most of it at a loss just to get rid of it before it went bad, the price of tobacco here has incresed 100% ... $100 for 50g puch of rollies

[10-Oct-18 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
actual tobacco

[10-Oct-18 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing serious

[10-Oct-18 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
although I think hte fine for tobacco is even higher than the green stuff.... coz tax

[10-Oct-18 11:33 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Damn.

[10-Oct-18 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am surprised there is not a massive illegal tobvacco trade here tbh .. the government is ncreaseing tax on it like 12% every 6 months... I am surprised people dont just stop paying it its crazy

[10-Oct-18 11:34 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I can get you some organic tobacco here in the states I am sure. 😃  DM for some help.

another approx 228 days

[10-Oct-18 04:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@0x03 so the hourly pool stutter only seems to be happening on your pool.    The piratepool.io pool has a smooth curve.   
I ran 1.5 MS on Nicehash on both.   and your pool was choppy in a very consistent manner.   Seems like something is occurring every 50-70 minutes to cause this.

i know this happens

[10-Oct-18 04:45 PM] 0x03#8822
this is a thing i have to fix, but remember you're mining on a free pool

[10-Oct-18 04:45 PM] 0x03#8822
(and i'm busy as unimaginable fuck)

[10-Oct-18 04:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I do remember.   I thought someone said it was happening on both pools.

[10-Oct-18 04:45 PM] 0x03#8822
as soon as i get to it i will not only upgrade the hardware for the pool but also fix that issue

[10-Oct-18 04:46 PM] 0x03#8822
rest assured both is on my `monitor`

[10-Oct-18 04:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I do my friend I do.   I was just advising since the answer someone gave me made me think it was a pirate thing 😃

[10-Oct-18 04:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Now I feel like an ass for bringing it up.   Sorry boss.

[10-Oct-18 04:46 PM] 0x03#8822

no problem, i just have to get around to it

[10-Oct-18 04:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I never look at pool fees.   
I always assumne pool ops deserve them.

[10-Oct-18 04:48 PM] 0x03#8822
fees make sense if the pool works completely, but as you've correctly mentioned, mine has a hourly hickup (which isn't costing anybody any money, just to be clear)

[10-Oct-18 04:49 PM] 0x03#8822
and a recent look on https://piratechain.org/ shows that the dude still hasn't got any hashrate

[10-Oct-18 04:49 PM] 0x03#8822
so send him some, will ya

[10-Oct-18 04:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
OK.   Will do.  I keep forgetting we have a third.

[10-Oct-18 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

_ssh tunnels to one of his GPU rigs and sends 9k sols to the newbie pool_

[10-Oct-18 05:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
When the rig contest is over in 4 hours, I will run my rigs to the new pool too.

[10-Oct-18 05:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
