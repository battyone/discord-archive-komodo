[27-Nov-18 08:01 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

[28-Nov-18 01:07 AM] Alright#0419
@blackbeard research "powers of TAU" ceremony

[28-Nov-18 01:07 AM] Alright#0419

[28-Nov-18 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
it's not implemented yet

[28-Nov-18 01:15 AM] Alright#0419
but when it is, the "trusted setup" FUD will be entirely gone

[28-Nov-18 01:15 AM] Alright#0419

What up dirty birds?

[28-Nov-18 02:23 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The needed factors to ALL come together to create a fraud issue with the ceremony is not even possible in a Hollywood script scenario.

[28-Nov-18 02:23 AM] FishyGuts#5085
That‚Äôs my take on it.  It‚Äôs some high level conspiracy shot that not a single person would be able to prove.

I'm actually a mountain biker, trail and lift access downhill. So I'm really using the excite bike logo tangentially. Feel like a poser now

Where do you ride @PUMPnJUMP I am very close@to Aliso woods trails and the Luge in Laguna Beach.

[28-Nov-18 02:55 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Google them.    Famous trails around here.   Brian Lopez helped build the luge.  A crazy Bermed our high speed run down Laguna canyon.

Big bear is awesome.  I had a season pass two years ago.   Last year I didn‚Äôt I broke my back riding BMx.  Pedal grind to 360 out on a 9‚Äô quarter pipe.  My front tire hung up and I fell ~11 feet to my asscheek.  It‚Äôs been a slow biking year for me but im just getting back at it.

Have you checked your miners outputs?

might turn the oc down on em when i get back

usually i can restart em...and then boom hash shoots up for a while...levels off...day later in the tank

[28-Nov-18 05:41 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah, I'd double check the output log. See if the temps are ramping up or any problems going on

[28-Nov-18 05:45 AM] Ric of Ric & Thadeus#8816
thanks...both of mine have been stable around 64-66 while being on 24 hours a day over the last 3 weeks

[28-Nov-18 05:46 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah okay, doesn't sound like you're having any issues. I'm not sure of any other reasons why your hash would drop suddenly then. Maybe internet problems or ping problems to the server? Are you getting a lot of invalid shares?

[28-Nov-18 05:58 AM] Ric of Ric & Thadeus#8816
ill have to check when i get home...ill give an update thursday

The Zcash Foundation facilitated and hosted the Powers of Tau ceremony, which took place between November 2017 and April 2018. It accepted 87 contributions from cryptographers and members of the community. Only one of these contributions needs to be honestly constructed for the parameters in this phase to be secure.

Most of the participants wrote about their experience and the unique countermeasures they deployed. Andrew Miller and Ryan Pierce famously flew in a plane with radioactive material to seed their random number generator. Filippo Valsorda wrote an independent implementation of the ceremony code in Go. Devrandom developed a trusted build environment for the Rust code.

The Zcash Company hosted the MPC for constructing Sapling‚Äôs final zk-SNARK parameters. We announced the ceremony in May and accepted contributions through early August. In all, this ceremony accepted over 90 contributions, of which only one must be honestly constructed for the success of this phase.
