[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> thanks man. i strive to become better eveyday

[16-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> Weird for a Godless person.

[16-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> i dont need any external forces or ghosts to help me

[16-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> right!

[16-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> woke? Conscious? idk

[16-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> God isn't an external force

[16-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> The Kingdom of God is within.

[16-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> hes not. because hes psycologically constructed

[16-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> yes

[16-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> exactly my point

[16-Nov-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> You either choose to let God live in your mind or you don't.

[16-Nov-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> If you love the bible. keep it up. Just dont rely on gods plan...

[16-Nov-19 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> have a plan for yourself and execute to the best of your abilities as a living breathing human

[16-Nov-19 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> What do you think Gods plan is?

[16-Nov-19 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> Why do you think you know?

[16-Nov-19 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> God is fake. there is no such thing

[16-Nov-19 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> people think he has a plan for them... no... he dosent exist to even begin making a plan

[16-Nov-19 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> You generalise.

[16-Nov-19 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> This is why good people die. this is why great research goes missing. this is why bad people live to commit horrendous crimes. there is no plan.

[16-Nov-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> God just doesn't want to  get a brain tumor so its best we don't destroy the cell in his brain we live on.

[16-Nov-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> Earth?

[16-Nov-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> What?

[16-Nov-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> You aren't paying attention at all

[16-Nov-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> Religious people man... i dont get em sometimes

[16-Nov-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> They try to make things so vague and think theyre cool for doing it. lol

[16-Nov-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> You miss the vision to see beyond what is right in front of you

[16-Nov-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> makes em look dumb

[16-Nov-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> yeah ok

[16-Nov-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> What is the vision

[16-Nov-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> I've given you a bunch of wisdom but you just kept talking about how you do not believe in a bearded man in the sky

[16-Nov-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> youre not taking the moral high ground here. nor the intellectual high ground.

[16-Nov-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> What wisdom

[16-Nov-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> youve spewed rhetoric

[16-Nov-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-prt] <Tek> laterino

[16-Nov-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> You have been socially and psychologically convinced into thinking ghosts exist. But thats okay... ill let you be. Just dont rely on some plan your ghost leader has for you

[16-Nov-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> anyways

[16-Nov-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> no one conditioned me

[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> back on topic

[16-Nov-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> I grew up an atheist

[16-Nov-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> then got into hermetisism

[16-Nov-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-Nov-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-Nov-19 08:52 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
volume so low and wallet under maintenance on the other exchange causing inflated price

[16-Nov-19 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <KOSIUS> Use AltsBit

[16-Nov-19 08:56 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
never heard of that exchange , I'll check it out

[16-Nov-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ so geenlet, coded anythig nice t'dai

[16-Nov-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> Think KMD will do the same as RLC?

[16-Nov-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> kmd needs more memes

[16-Nov-19 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <FlyingDutchman> if you click get wallet on the website, it takes you to a old medium article

[16-Nov-19 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <FlyingDutchman> that shld be updated to some sort of page with the lite wallet and all included

[16-Nov-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <FlyingDutchman> sevenseas, agama, etc

[16-Nov-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @FlyingDutchman were working on that

[16-Nov-19 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> @Draeth  is there a priority order for the fundraising? Should we equally contribute to all of them? What do you susggest?

[16-Nov-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> It's all based on what you feel is more important. My opinion is that marketing is the most important at the moment

[16-Nov-19 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zanzarismo> question, Is the turtlenetwork the same coin as the TRTL on tradeogre???

[dscrd-prt] <Zanzarismo> Okay, so no relation. Got it

[16-Nov-19 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zanzarismo> I'm halfway through listening to the youtube livestream you just made 4 hours ago. GREAT stuff

[16-Nov-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Thanks!

[16-Nov-19 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> That's what I was thinking too. Marketing is a bit more of an urgency.

[16-Nov-19 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zanzarismo> Well, if John McAfee is to be interviewed soon, that will be a great event!

[16-Nov-19 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zanzarismo> We all know what happens after he endorses a project

[16-Nov-19 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kaks> McAfee supports privacy coins :powder_monkey:

[16-Nov-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> I am everywhere lately üòÇ ü§£

[17-Nov-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> What if we had a game that used Pirate? Similar to how tron uses poker.

[17-Nov-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> Or is this not like that?

[17-Nov-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> I understand Tron is MADE for that. But i mean, a private coin... thats a different story ya know?

[17-Nov-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> it's hard to have accountability on a novelty game on a private chain

[17-Nov-19 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <NickH> @Draeth hubi or huobi?

[17-Nov-19 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Hubi

[17-Nov-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Jimm B.> I remember the worldcoin website from back then.  They had several fundraising events on their website.  each had a picture, a short description and a progress bar.  that would be a good thing for the pirate website.  This would also give you an overview of what the community has already achieved.

[17-Nov-19 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Jimm B.> And maybe someone can bring the website up to date.¬† in the 'get started' section on the main page are outdated information.

PirateChain (ARRR) is actively being traded on DigitalPrice exchange against KMD and BTC

I think the website is confusing.
much that can be improved there.
is a revision of the website planned?

Who manages the website?

[17-Nov-19 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> @Jimm B.  Its currently under way, there are a few people working on it now.  There are some definite problems people are trying to resolve.

[17-Nov-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <McBeastie> Did Graviex fix their withdrawal problems? Experienced some strange action in July.

[17-Nov-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> YO WHO TOOK A CRAP ON TRADEOGORE?!

[17-Nov-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
