or how is it that you only show up in KMDICE to setup a pool after i do so? anything you still feel you have to pay me back for ruining your pool fee when i showed up here?

[06-Nov-18 10:06 AM] 0x03#8822

yiimp/yaamp pools are great (once properly set up and if there are proper resources to run them)

[06-Nov-18 10:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[06-Nov-18 10:16 AM] 0x03#8822
@twistedmind setup a bounty in here, i'm sure somebody will setup your pool

[06-Nov-18 10:16 AM] 0x03#8822
i wont, but the higher the bounty, the more likely it is

[06-Nov-18 10:16 AM] twistedmind#1523
what are we talking about $$

[06-Nov-18 10:17 AM] ronyi#5719
I trust @webworker01 and I do not care about other opinions. Sorry. everyone can have an opinion and this is mine. you have to trust someone(example: root CA). so I can not believe that we do not trust anyone...

[06-Nov-18 10:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@twistedmind are you wanting to do a solo-pool?

[06-Nov-18 10:17 AM] twistedmind#1523
for my core people that have hash to point

[06-Nov-18 10:18 AM] twistedmind#1523
there is a group of us

[06-Nov-18 10:24 AM] 0x03#8822
"do not set and forget" is a dangerous underestimation. the veruscoin pool is "do not set and forget". this one was something completely different.

[06-Nov-18 10:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_starts to write about how that readme assumes one already knows wtf they are doing.... erases it and goes back to 📺 _

[06-Nov-18 10:28 AM] twistedmind#1523
im not one that lnows all the details and knowledge to "fix" issues that come up that will be complex. Thats why i want a pool just for me to test the waters and learn

[06-Nov-18 10:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
playing with pools, be they local or public, isn't really a "test the waters" thing if you want positive results. you pretty much need to be committed to learning all of what it is and does or committed to banging head against desk when it doesn't work

[06-Nov-18 10:43 AM] twistedmind#1523
thanks Genie, i laughed my a@@ off about the banging head on on desk

all I can say in this conversation is that both @webworker01  and @0x03  were both nice and professional in private messaging in helping me setup @Polly 🐦

[06-Nov-18 10:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jeezy much of that convo goes a ways back and involves some feelz

[06-Nov-18 10:47 AM] jansako#3330
For me the first KMD pool (and later assetchains pools) was the 'test the waters' experience. Got it to work on 6-7th try with a lot of help from here. The next 10-15 times I did it was all good. Now I did not touch it for 6 months and would have to spend a lot of time to get up to speed again. I think that is what 'this is not a set & forget' means...

well we could use some hash spreading

[06-Nov-18 01:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@STIMO89 the pool is closed.

[06-Nov-18 01:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We have 4 other options to choose from you can find them on pirate.black

[06-Nov-18 01:02 PM] STIMO89#7222
I had 5 ARRR on balance

[06-Nov-18 01:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
He will pay all of them out I am sure.  

As to the website... there’s gonna be no way to please everyone.   I’ve heard the old one was great and I’ve heard it was awful.

[06-Nov-18 01:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The existing isn’t done yet but should be all “artified” in the next week or so.

[06-Nov-18 01:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We can button down any navigation issues after that.
