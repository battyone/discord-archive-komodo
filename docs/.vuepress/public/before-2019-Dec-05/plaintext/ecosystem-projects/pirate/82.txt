[29-Sep-18 02:20 AM] gt#2812
the world would be much easier to deal with if there were such things as an overarching conspiracy like you’re insinuating

[29-Sep-18 02:20 AM] ch6ris#5240
purge time

[29-Sep-18 02:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well... MR Scotty's first directive after gaining office, was to change all of our defense force personell to mandatory weapons retraining every 3 months regardless of deployment status... so maybe thats gonna happen sooner than we think 🤔

[29-Sep-18 02:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My best friend is in the Navy, he called me to tell me that a few weeks ago btw... I dont think its been reported anywhere

@ch6ris My life isn't entirely agnostic, but I live with $5-12k USD worth of monthly mining bills (separate from the massive amount I've spent on PIRATE) you can pay anytime you want
