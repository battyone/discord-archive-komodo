I'll give it a go webworker01, thanks

[26-Sep-18 03:34 PM] klunex#3191
there is always the argument optional privacy is bad. I never understood why.

[26-Sep-18 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
because it allows privacy to be lost

[26-Sep-18 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
with mandatory privacy there is no issue of mixing with de-anonymized transparent funds

[26-Sep-18 03:54 PM] Mylo#8306
who is in charge or pirate.black?  i've got a question, wanna DM them.

Can i create a $PIRATE address & send 15 KMD from Agama 0.1.0 (Android) and receive 777 PIRATE in my Mobile Wallet ?

[26-Sep-18 03:59 PM] SHossain#0007
you need native mode

[26-Sep-18 03:59 PM] Sharifa#7849
@SHossain 😭

[26-Sep-18 03:59 PM] SHossain#0007
web, spv or android has not support

[26-Sep-18 03:59 PM] SHossain#0007
you can use KMD, but not PIRATE

[26-Sep-18 04:00 PM] Sharifa#7849
@SHossain what's PIRATE contract address?

[26-Sep-18 04:01 PM] NedBGQ#8462
I'm looking around trying to find any mentioned major differences btw. pirate and btch.

[26-Sep-18 04:01 PM] SHossain#0007
There is no contract address. Check the pinned posts to learn more about PIRATE.

[26-Sep-18 04:01 PM] Sharifa#7849
@SHossain ok thx

[26-Sep-18 04:01 PM] SHossain#0007
@NedBGQ BTCH can use t transaction. PIRATE doesn't. It only does z tx

[26-Sep-18 04:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And PIRATE didn't include the moneygrab airdrop of BTCH

[26-Sep-18 04:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
:trollface:

[26-Sep-18 04:02 PM] NedBGQ#8462
true story bro

[26-Sep-18 04:03 PM] NedBGQ#8462
:rum:

[26-Sep-18 04:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
there's the one and only single thing that I think PIRATE will feel annoyed with.....

[26-Sep-18 04:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
till sapling....

[26-Sep-18 04:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the long time of z tx processing

[26-Sep-18 04:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
nothing else would be annoying....

[26-Sep-18 04:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
only patience can help

[26-Sep-18 04:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
PIRATE will teach you how to be patient 😄

[26-Sep-18 04:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
till Sapling

[26-Sep-18 04:03 PM] SHossain#0007
@Sharifa you can't receive PIRATE in your KMD R address

[26-Sep-18 04:05 PM] 0x03#8822

[26-Sep-18 04:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Rock64 you can expect

[26-Sep-18 04:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but not raspberry pi 😄

[26-Sep-18 04:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it will run, but die soon

[26-Sep-18 04:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄

[26-Sep-18 04:06 PM] 0x03#8822
because of little ram?

[26-Sep-18 04:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
R.I.P by KMD 😄

[26-Sep-18 04:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes

[26-Sep-18 04:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[26-Sep-18 04:06 PM] 0x03#8822
