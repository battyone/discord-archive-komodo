Ok. I was just wondering because on piratepool my info shows a balance of 10+ but paid is 0 so trying to figure out when the balance is paid out

[19-Oct-18 05:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The nineth Tuesay of every 17th week?

[19-Oct-18 05:24 PM] Steve10#5203
Lol

[19-Oct-18 05:24 PM] foxy#5199
Mine was paid out after 25

[19-Oct-18 05:25 PM] Steve10#5203
@foxy thank you, that's all I was wondering

[19-Oct-18 05:26 PM] 0x03#8822

whats really funny to me: what i see in PIRATE with hashrate distribution is just the opposite to VerusCoin

[19-Oct-18 05:28 PM] penguin#0544
@webworker01  Has the asic port been closed? having issues trying to connect

[19-Oct-18 05:28 PM] 0x03#8822
but i bet "being first" counts a lot more than i can imagine in my little tiny mind

[19-Oct-18 05:30 PM] 0x03#8822
ah, nobody confessed to it yet? 😄

[19-Oct-18 05:30 PM] penguin#0544
Ah ok, yeah that could be it - thanks

[19-Oct-18 05:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_will be starting a pool on Monday that is 0 fee until hash >20M sols, and then 0.5% fee from 20-30M sols (which will go to onboarding), and then 1% fee from 30M sols on up (which will go to 1/2 to onboarding and 1/2 to me)_

[19-Oct-18 05:31 PM] 0x03#8822
so that means in the worst case fee on/off 20 times per day because that one 20msol miner jumps on and off :trollface:

[19-Oct-18 05:31 PM] 0x03#8822
besides that, for real?

[19-Oct-18 05:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, for real order cart is ready as soon as I come up with a domain name I like and then the rest will be worked on over the weekend

[19-Oct-18 05:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all non-z_addy workers to my pool will auto donate to onboarding, no banning anyone that submits valid shares

[19-Oct-18 05:34 PM] penguin#0544
Sneaky Pirate? 😄

[19-Oct-18 05:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sneaky, will be in bold on all info pages on the site

[19-Oct-18 05:35 PM] penguin#0544

nice @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  👍

[19-Oct-18 05:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I think it went well.   I may have messed up on one fact though...

[19-Oct-18 05:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Which means the video will get downvoted and that's all people will see 😂

[19-Oct-18 05:49 PM] 0x03#8822
you said Monero when you should've said Pirate? :trollface:

[19-Oct-18 05:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[19-Oct-18 05:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I only had to cut once.   Everything else was seamless.   Not sure how he edits.

[19-Oct-18 05:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
He said a few days as he will do a setup video first.

[19-Oct-18 05:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😦

[19-Oct-18 05:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"a few days", sounds like my supplier when I said I wanted an  i9-9900K

[19-Oct-18 05:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[19-Oct-18 06:02 PM] 0x03#8822
i'm pretty sure "well done" is it anyways

[19-Oct-18 06:02 PM] 0x03#8822
so, well done

[19-Oct-18 06:05 PM] Jaspr-QuantifyMining#0987
aaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

[19-Oct-18 06:06 PM] Snoop#8470
Is it just me that can't see my "Miner Lookup" stats on piratepool.io?

[19-Oct-18 06:06 PM] Jaspr-QuantifyMining#0987

[19-Oct-18 06:09 PM] TheMiningPool#9076
Remember you can mine at https://theminingpool.online too with 0% fees 😄

yeah, but when I put my address in the "Miner Lookup" field and click "Lookup", it brings me to a page with no stats

[19-Oct-18 06:11 PM] TheMiningPool#9076
@0x03 tried to, but dont really know how to commit that !!

[19-Oct-18 06:11 PM] 0x03#8822
@Snoop check the upper right corner above the graph, is there something to select?

[19-Oct-18 06:11 PM] 0x03#8822
@TheMiningPool just PR to the main repo

[19-Oct-18 06:11 PM] 0x03#8822
fork it, edit your pool in, commit to your fork, create PR to the upstream

[19-Oct-18 06:21 PM] TheMiningPool#9076
@0x03 Ty! I think I did it :p

[19-Oct-18 06:21 PM] 0x03#8822
i think so, too! 😃

[19-Oct-18 06:26 PM] TheMiningPool#9076

[19-Oct-18 06:30 PM] TheMiningPool#9076

[19-Oct-18 06:31 PM] SHossain#0007

[19-Oct-18 06:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You’ll want to know how to use that interface...

[19-Oct-18 06:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You need Agama wallet 42c which is pinned in new pirates.

[19-Oct-18 06:51 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562

[19-Oct-18 06:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[19-Oct-18 06:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Active native pirate chain.

[19-Oct-18 06:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Generate new z address.

[19-Oct-18 06:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Use that for your mining on a pool.

[19-Oct-18 06:52 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[19-Oct-18 06:55 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562

[19-Oct-18 07:12 PM] penguin#0544
Go -> Activate Coin

[19-Oct-18 07:12 PM] penguin#0544
Select Pirate from list

[19-Oct-18 07:12 PM] penguin#0544
Here's a bootstrap of the chain: https://bootstrap.0x03.services/pirate/ARRR.html

[19-Oct-18 07:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes.  Native or lite for Komodo in Agama 42c

[19-Oct-18 07:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Then activate coin in the top right for native pirate

[19-Oct-18 07:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
In a short while the chain should sync.

[19-Oct-18 07:15 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
