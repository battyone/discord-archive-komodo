lol... but maybe they're not here at all, if you're referring to the the same folks i have in mind

[12-Nov-18 11:13 PM] burbank#1598
@mrlynch I wish I was sending too much. Nice problem to have.

[12-Nov-18 11:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
the actual amount doesn't matter

[12-Nov-18 11:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's all in the utxo's

[12-Nov-18 11:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
as someone recently explained it to me 😄

[12-Nov-18 11:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's based on the amounts of payments you received in your wallet

[12-Nov-18 11:15 PM] mrlynch#5735
let's say you have 5,000 ARRR in your wallet received in 500 transactions (different amounts)

[12-Nov-18 11:15 PM] mrlynch#5735
make an average per transaction -> 5000 / 500 = 10

[12-Nov-18 11:16 PM] mrlynch#5735
now multiply that by 54 (max tx's at once) -> 10 * 54 = 540

[12-Nov-18 11:16 PM] mrlynch#5735
and then use 80% as your send amount (to play it safe) -> 540 * 0.8 = 432

[12-Nov-18 11:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
that send would most likely (95% chance depending on what incoming utxo's are selected) go through

[12-Nov-18 11:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
that's the math, replace with your numbers

[12-Nov-18 11:19 PM] burbank#1598
@mrlynch - Wow silly me I  didn't realize how handcuffed these transactions were.  I don't have these restrictions with fiat <puts on helmet awaiting barrage>.  Heh.

[12-Nov-18 11:19 PM] mrlynch#5735
they're not handcuffed... just shielded 😄

[12-Nov-18 11:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Wow silly me I didn't realize how handcuffed these transactions were. I don't have these restrictions with fiat`
What if I told you that crypto isn't supposed to be like fiat and you never actually *own* any fiat...

[12-Nov-18 11:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you're receiving lots of small payments from mining it would be best to z_mergetoaddress on a daily basis

[12-Nov-18 11:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'll dig up the command

[12-Nov-18 11:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 he did say he's putting on the helmet waiting for the barrage(?) .. let'er rip :_))

[12-Nov-18 11:22 PM] burbank#1598
Heh. I knew mentioning the f word would cause issues here

[12-Nov-18 11:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[12-Nov-18 11:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
enjoy yer scallops ye' salty sea dog

[12-Nov-18 11:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_mergetoaddress '["*"]' <insert_your_zcAddress_here>

[12-Nov-18 11:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
without <>

[12-Nov-18 11:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
that will consolidate your utxo's

[12-Nov-18 11:24 PM] burbank#1598
Well it is an important piece of knowledge that letting my  Agama wallet go to 10,000 and then sell it seems like a bad plan if I can't transfer 10K to DigitialPrice at once. I would have kept going in circles if I didn't post here today. That is what makes this so much fun to learn all this.

[12-Nov-18 11:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's heavy on resources (especially CPU) so tread carefully if you're using on an old machine / older macbook

[12-Nov-18 11:26 PM] burbank#1598
So this so far only affected transferring to DigitalPrice but does it affect sell orders in the same way?

[12-Nov-18 11:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
z_mergetoaddress should solve that

[12-Nov-18 11:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
once they're in there, they're in there and you can trade them as you wish, sell orders are not affected

[12-Nov-18 11:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
just... please ... (personal opinion / piece of advice) don't dump to stupid low prices

[12-Nov-18 11:28 PM] burbank#1598
very cool. sounds like the z_mergetoaddress should be a button in the Agama wallet

[12-Nov-18 11:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
of course, they're yours to do as you please... if you do dump, just let me know and i'll buy it 😄

[12-Nov-18 11:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
that's a good idea ... might want to let #deleted-channel know 😄

[12-Nov-18 11:29 PM] burbank#1598
I once had a CEO tell me not to sell my stock while he was on a auto sell plan monthly. It isn't dumping when mining ARRR earns more than other equihash coins in my view

[12-Nov-18 11:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085

@burbank not telling you what to do... your proceeds, your biz... just saying that if you do dump... let me know 😁

[12-Nov-18 11:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Llama yup it got to 11

[12-Nov-18 11:32 PM] Llama#1330

[12-Nov-18 11:33 PM] mrlynch#5735

[12-Nov-18 11:33 PM] burbank#1598
@mrlynch I dropped a line at #deleted-channel about adding a button

@mrlynch very cool. All boats rise when info is shared. If we make it simple for more people then ARRR becomes more usable and valuable.

[12-Nov-18 11:47 PM] wookie#7663
I like @burbank 's idea, @SHossain can z_mergetoaddress be a button in some future agama iteration?

[12-Nov-18 11:50 PM] burbank#1598
@mylynch https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/komodo-API.html  WARNING: z_mergetoaddress is DISABLED but can be enabled as an experimental feature.  I have to go out now but I figure that I can stop Agama and perhaps figure out how to run this with experimental on,  (I am on Windoz)

[12-Nov-18 11:52 PM] burbank#1598
komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_mergetoaddress '["*"]' zc.....      gives error > error: Error JSON:'[*]'.... Back it to it later tonight..... Thanks.... No rush just want to get the flow from Agama to selling down pat for when ARRR hits $1.00

[12-Nov-18 11:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's '["*"]'

[12-Nov-18 11:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
more like when ARRR hits $10 😁 :treasure:
