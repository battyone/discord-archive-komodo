Zcash Sapling introduces potentially major privacy concerns. They will soon show the number of inputs and outputs in FULLY-shielded transactions, which will likely be critical metadata to help isolate mixing transactions even more.

Best depends on who you are.   To @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ there is no such thing as best.... he solo mines üòõ

[23-Oct-18 05:33 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If you want higher rewards and less blocks, hit a pool with lower hashrate.  If you want more blocks but smaller rewards hit a bigger pool.  All told, you will likely hashout about the same amount of coins over a long period of time.

[23-Oct-18 07:12 AM] Andr√©#2488
What is the supply? Does anyone know?

[23-Oct-18 07:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Current supply = Number of blocks x blockreward

[23-Oct-18 07:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Total supply will be around 200 million I think

[23-Oct-18 07:19 AM] Andr√©#2488
So the current supply is around 20 million?

[23-Oct-18 07:24 AM] Flexatron#8809

I am running into an Agama error when sending Pirate using the send 'all' button from the UI. Made a video, should I post it here or in the Agama channel?

[23-Oct-18 07:31 AM] jansako#3330
@Community Contributor

[23-Oct-18 07:32 AM] FishyGuts#5085
What is the error?

[23-Oct-18 07:32 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Could be a UTXO issue if you're a miner.

[23-Oct-18 07:34 AM] jansako#3330
error 3, I posted the video in Agama channel.

[23-Oct-18 07:35 AM] jansako#3330
it worked when I reduced the number of decimal places (the issue is likely with the UI, using the send 'all' button)

[23-Oct-18 07:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Ok.  Sorry I don't think I can help.

help is not needed necessarily, just reported it so it gets to the dev queue in case it was not reported before

[23-Oct-18 08:09 AM] Mr. HashEm#3357

[23-Oct-18 08:25 AM] duxiaoer#1142
Our total supply is 200 million

[23-Oct-18 08:25 AM] duxiaoer#1142
How many coins have been mine now?

[23-Oct-18 08:33 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[23-Oct-18 08:33 AM] FishyGuts#5085
200M total.

[23-Oct-18 08:34 AM] jeezy#3408

[23-Oct-18 08:34 AM] jeezy#3408

[23-Oct-18 08:55 AM] 0x03#8822
anything unobvious wrong on my pool?

[23-Oct-18 08:55 AM] jeezy#3408
390000 something blocks

[23-Oct-18 08:55 AM] 0x03#8822
i cannot see problems but a lot of the hashrate just left at once

[23-Oct-18 08:56 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Nh contract expired maybe

[23-Oct-18 08:56 AM] 0x03#8822
actually that may be it

[23-Oct-18 08:57 AM] 0x03#8822
i'm a bit on the toes over pool problems the last couple of days üòÑ

[23-Oct-18 08:57 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Nothing wrong with that lol

[23-Oct-18 09:00 AM] 0x03#8822
yea usually the 'funny' scaling of the pool graph adds to it as well

[23-Oct-18 09:00 AM] 0x03#8822
i may have to introduce a 'lower display limit' for high bandwidths and vice versa or something into this rendering thingy

[23-Oct-18 09:01 AM] 0x03#8822
especially if i'm jumping +-80 msol at a time, lol

[23-Oct-18 09:01 AM] scubapanda#2485
Sapling can't be here soon enough. Most of my z_mergetoaddress failed, still waiting a few more hours for the last ones to clear/fail. Seems like it's better to merge small amounts at a time.. "z_mergetoaddress finished (status=failed, error=16: bad-txns-oversize)"

[23-Oct-18 09:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I now send mining wallets daily to a new address and then send all that to another as 3-4 transactions.

[23-Oct-18 09:13 AM] scubapanda#2485
Yep, should definitely do it daily..
