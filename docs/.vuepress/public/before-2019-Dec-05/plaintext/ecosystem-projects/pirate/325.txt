@scubapanda sure, but we are talking about a few Ksol/s,  instead of getting (example 34,2ARRR a day) you'll get 34,19ARRR a day. But it won't be accurate if you intend to put 20Msol/s indeed, you can expect 20% less than the displayed amount

[20-Nov-18 12:20 PM] BlockTech#6895
It gives a good idea for miners with less than 1Msol/s.

[20-Nov-18 12:49 PM] dokrates#8987
anyone interested in buy ARRR ?

It is just BS on their side

[20-Nov-18 01:58 PM] jansako#3330
best case they don't know what the hell are they doing

[20-Nov-18 01:58 PM] jansako#3330
worst case someone there already sold my coins

[20-Nov-18 01:58 PM] dokrates#8987
mmm are they saying, you lost the coins if you sent to the wallet's web because we didn't any announcement

[20-Nov-18 01:58 PM] dokrates#8987
right?

[20-Nov-18 01:58 PM] jansako#3330
because they think well, pirate, all private and stuff

[20-Nov-18 01:58 PM] jansako#3330
yes

[20-Nov-18 02:05 PM] PTYX#6840
I say put more pressure on them.

[20-Nov-18 02:07 PM] PTYX#6840
@jansako what does be mean about not being "on the social media"

[20-Nov-18 02:07 PM] dokrates#8987
i think they haven't technical habilities to implement pirate

[20-Nov-18 02:13 PM] jansako#3330
yep, I sent coins, later when I heard that Pirate won;t be implemented I asked them to send the coins back

[20-Nov-18 02:13 PM] jansako#3330
the 'social media' I 'assume' means they have not published that 'marked added' to BTT

[20-Nov-18 02:13 PM] jansako#3330
which makes no difference under the law

[20-Nov-18 02:14 PM] jansako#3330
I am sure they know it, they are engaging in the time honored corporate tactic of pretending their customers are idiots

[20-Nov-18 02:14 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Id say if they had a deposit address for you on your account then that is definitely an issue caused by them

[20-Nov-18 02:14 PM] jansako#3330
yep

[20-Nov-18 02:14 PM] jansako#3330
exactly

[20-Nov-18 02:15 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
not everyone uses btt or twitter etc

[20-Nov-18 02:15 PM] jansako#3330
very easy to put a notice on the account like  DP did

[20-Nov-18 02:15 PM] jansako#3330
'deposits not available' or something similar

[20-Nov-18 02:15 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
yup

[20-Nov-18 02:16 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
You shouldn't have deposited but they shouldn't have give you the option either

[20-Nov-18 02:20 PM] jansako#3330
no argument from me there.

[20-Nov-18 02:20 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
was it alot of coins?

[20-Nov-18 02:20 PM] jansako#3330
I am now considering it a test of their integrity and  how they care about their business

[20-Nov-18 02:21 PM] jansako#3330
the amount is not relevant, really. I do not want to make this about 'poor Jan lost his coins' üòÉ

[20-Nov-18 02:23 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i know its not relevant but for eg when dp opened i sent 10 coins to test. maybe take it as a lesson, Shame they are not willing to even try to refund though and does show there lack of commitment for sure

[20-Nov-18 02:30 PM] jansako#3330
I have taken it as a lesson, now they (may) have to learn theirs.  Estonia is not a wild west as long as they are part of the EU. It is the lame ass arguments more than anything that will make me go after them üòÉ If they really are that incompetent...
Sometimes the company screws up, I did it plenty of times. You own up to it, apologize and make it right. You do not make lame excuses and you most definitely do not take people's money for something you did not deliver...

[20-Nov-18 02:31 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah a reply stating they are looking into it would have been nice. sucks bro

[20-Nov-18 02:32 PM] jansako#3330
shrug... If it was me, even for a 10 coin loss I would have offered you a say trading fee credit or something... in my case that would not be enough any more

[20-Nov-18 02:32 PM] dokrates#8987
maybe the guy who answered is just an ignorant from call center, with premanufactured answers

[20-Nov-18 02:32 PM] dokrates#8987
and he knows nothing

[20-Nov-18 02:32 PM] jansako#3330
he should know to escalate something like this

[20-Nov-18 02:33 PM] jansako#3330
I run tech support, so if something, I understand good support procedures

[20-Nov-18 02:33 PM] dokrates#8987
i sent 1 ARRR to their deposit wallet, but i was also waiting for their confirmation of listing in twitter

[20-Nov-18 02:34 PM] jansako#3330
sure, the fact whether I should have sent the coins or not is not under discussion here üòÉ

[20-Nov-18 02:35 PM] dokrates#8987

[20-Nov-18 02:38 PM] jansako#3330
I have it, thanks. That whole argument is BS. 
- I opened a new account, completed the process
- I logged in to my account, located several coins I wanted to trade
- I saw the deposit addresses, I made a deposit 
- my deposit did not arrive

At no place during this process have I been told to go check BTT or other 'social media' if those deposit addresses are valid!!!

[20-Nov-18 02:40 PM] jansako#3330
enough of this, thanks for the input guys. Time to go and be productive again üòÉ

[20-Nov-18 05:19 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@jansako is rightfully angered.  They allowed him to make the deposit and gave no warnings in any fair amount of time or space.

[20-Nov-18 05:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
They lost 300 ARRR of mine that I sent trying to test.     I am pretty sure that the Crex24 Devs just don't know what they are doing.   
They told me "We can add ARRR if we use R addresses" - despite my first email to them CLEARLY stating we have no public R addresses.   
Then they told me they could use the bitcoin RCP instead of the zcash module....

[20-Nov-18 05:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Now I'm not a dev... but I know that those are two easy items they could have checked off weeks ago.

@jansako i've sent 30 ARRR as a test as well and they sent me the same half-assed reply. @FishyGuts I hope they refunded the listing fee.
