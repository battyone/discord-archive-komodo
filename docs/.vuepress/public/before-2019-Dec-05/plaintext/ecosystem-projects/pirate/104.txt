[03-Oct-18 06:46 AM] 0x03#8822
*headdesk*

[03-Oct-18 06:46 AM] criptobear#6402
and there is a problem in the visualization of amounts overlept by the addresses

[03-Oct-18 06:46 AM] 0x03#8822
and lets make sure nobody will ever be able to exchange his keyboard, should it be broken

[03-Oct-18 06:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
*and build the whole thing inside a too thick aluminum box

[03-Oct-18 06:47 AM] 0x03#8822
i like the alu block btw 😄

[03-Oct-18 06:47 AM] criptobear#6402
ahahah i get your point but let's think about the fact i got it for free so i don't give a s about defects

[03-Oct-18 06:47 AM] 0x03#8822
we're not done bashing apple yet 😛

[03-Oct-18 06:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_only makes fun of it because he has one too :P_

[03-Oct-18 06:47 AM] criptobear#6402
you can continue i do not own any apple stock

[03-Oct-18 06:48 AM] 0x03#8822
i bet the z-transaction is just executing and it will take a while

[03-Oct-18 06:48 AM] 0x03#8822
and this is why it's getting hot

[03-Oct-18 06:48 AM] criptobear#6402
everything went fine in the end

[03-Oct-18 06:48 AM] 0x03#8822
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 A1280 from late '12 here *ducks*

[03-Oct-18 06:48 AM] criptobear#6402
anyway did u all read about the other problem not mac related

[03-Oct-18 06:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so i don't give a s about defects`
Then quit bitching that it overheats when you finally use that $2000 CPU :trollface:

[03-Oct-18 06:49 AM] criptobear#6402
when you send pirates and you are in the second step the amounts and addresses are shown but one on the other

[03-Oct-18 06:49 AM] criptobear#6402
i was only trying to help not bitching

[03-Oct-18 06:49 AM] 0x03#8822
STOP

[03-Oct-18 06:50 AM] 0x03#8822
this turns into a wrong direction 😉

[03-Oct-18 06:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@criptobear How many different places that are not #deleted-channel are you going to post about the issue with #deleted-channel ?

[03-Oct-18 06:50 AM] 0x03#8822

[03-Oct-18 06:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[03-Oct-18 06:55 AM] 0x03#8822
you have to reconfigure the OS a bit tho

[03-Oct-18 06:55 AM] 0x03#8822
and that sux

[03-Oct-18 06:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Only nh would design a system where you can place 10 fixed orders for 1M sol/s for significantly cheaper than 1 order for 10M

[03-Oct-18 06:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏼

[03-Oct-18 06:57 AM] matt#3084
how much is a 1M sol/s order?

[03-Oct-18 06:58 AM] FishyGuts#5085
OMG

[03-Oct-18 06:58 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Gleam needs a rework.

[03-Oct-18 06:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
~0.015 per 1M chaper than 10

[03-Oct-18 06:58 AM] 0x03#8822
😄

[03-Oct-18 06:58 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It doesn't autosave as you work in it... and it won't let you save until certain fields are done...

[03-Oct-18 06:59 AM] FishyGuts#5085
This is the second time I've been 80% done with entering a contest and the damn thing freezes or shuts out.

[03-Oct-18 06:59 AM] 0x03#8822
the software quality is too damn low!

[03-Oct-18 06:59 AM] FishyGuts#5085
:mad:

[03-Oct-18 06:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like BTC core? :trollface:

[03-Oct-18 07:00 AM] 0x03#8822
i said quality *scnr* 😛

[03-Oct-18 07:00 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Literally have wasted like 3 hours between those two, entering these to only have them disappear. 

Needs to learn coding So I can make my own contest entry portal.

[03-Oct-18 07:00 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Will be staying up late to get this out.  I know it was supposed to go today.

[03-Oct-18 07:00 AM] actionslacks#4072
These hashrates are too damn high!

[03-Oct-18 07:00 AM] 0x03#8822
'need to learn coding' -> no

[03-Oct-18 07:00 AM] 0x03#8822
your expectations and the probable reality in the near future diverge WAY too much

[03-Oct-18 07:00 AM] FishyGuts#5085
near future... no

[03-Oct-18 07:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I am aware that 5 years from now I might be able to program a webpage 😛

[03-Oct-18 07:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Might.

[03-Oct-18 07:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`These hashrates are too damn high!`
Cover my daily revenue and I can drop it for you by 25% :trollface:

[03-Oct-18 07:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Perhaps I can find someone skilled in these things and we can work together to create our own secure contest portazl for creating giveaways and tracking entrants.

[03-Oct-18 07:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Will pay... once any critical items are checked off the list.

[03-Oct-18 07:02 AM] actionslacks#4072
There may be a bootstrap template that works

holy wave of difficulty adaption lag that makes me find `a hundred blocks in a row`

[03-Oct-18 07:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`a hundred blocks in a row`
that's a `fork`, not `lag` :trollface:

[03-Oct-18 07:28 AM] 0x03#8822

OK, this diff is too high, Komodo needs to switch K&N values to be fair to my GPUs 😡

we invented that for another chat community months ago when the first CoCs sprang up

[03-Oct-18 07:34 AM] 0x03#8822
tactically it was a proper decision

[03-Oct-18 07:34 AM] 0x03#8822
everybody is triggered, reads our thoughts on it

[03-Oct-18 07:34 AM] 0x03#8822
