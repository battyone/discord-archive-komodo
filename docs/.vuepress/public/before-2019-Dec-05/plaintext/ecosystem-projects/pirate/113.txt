@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 can you ask your provider for static IP address? they'll charge you extra for it, but might very well be worth it

[04-Oct-18 08:27 PM] 0x03#8822
oh hell, if i only could do this here. they don't offer it

[04-Oct-18 08:27 PM] Alright#0419
imagine that happening when you're 1/3 of the network hash

[04-Oct-18 08:27 PM] 0x03#8822
hah

[04-Oct-18 08:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Why would I imagine what is real?

[04-Oct-18 08:28 PM] Alright#0419
5%!=1/3

[04-Oct-18 08:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
5%?

`I went from 30% of hashrate to 5% :sob:`

[04-Oct-18 08:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for the same price

[04-Oct-18 08:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Alright, did you actually switch from whining about the fork to something else? 😛

[04-Oct-18 08:30 PM] Alright#0419
no, I will never stop whining about it

[04-Oct-18 08:39 PM] 0x03#8822
anyways if bloomberg is right, a lot of people ...will have servers with nice extra chips on their ipmi boards. extra free features if you want it so.

[04-Oct-18 08:40 PM] 0x03#8822
and if you're a customer of some webhosting company for your website you can probably be 50% sure your stuff is actually hosted on supermicro, whatever the implications to the endcustomers may be in this case.

Windows 10 October 2018 Update is deleting user data — here's ho...
The upgrade process to the Windows 10 October 2018 Update seems to be deleting users personal files. If you're planning to upgrade, you should consider making a full backup before proceeding.

it's been ~ 8 months since I gave up my Silver status, but the last I looked 99.2% of win10 kernel is win7 kernel and the other 0.8% is 50% screwed

[04-Oct-18 08:44 PM] 0x03#8822
ah, so you probably have money to burn still

win 7 rip

[04-Oct-18 08:44 PM] 0x03#8822
what i dont get, in the usual one shit-one great-one shit-one great-OS cycle that MS does

[04-Oct-18 08:44 PM] 0x03#8822
win8 has been very bad

[04-Oct-18 08:44 PM] 0x03#8822
win10.... seems to break the cycle with being another bad version

[04-Oct-18 08:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`win8 has been very bad`
to be fair, win 8 was more of a marketing flop than anything else
beyond the desktop aesthetics there wasn't enough change for any valid claim that it was "worse than" 7

[04-Oct-18 08:46 PM] 0x03#8822
imo there has only been one exception so far, when wxp followed right after w2k. some say wxp didnt count before sp1 tho

[04-Oct-18 08:46 PM] 0x03#8822
for me, judging by the stability of the system, 98se, 2k, xp and 7 really did a great job

[04-Oct-18 08:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
with the right drivers (once gfx was sorted), 8 was every bit as stable as 7

[04-Oct-18 08:48 PM] 0x03#8822
hm, for a reason i cant remember i did some side jobs on peoples notbooks to get win8 fixed for them

[04-Oct-18 08:48 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I still use 7 for any windows machines

well thats properly tested by now too 😉

[04-Oct-18 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

not like the most bleeding edge distro of 'em all

[04-Oct-18 08:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when testing bleeding edge non-OS stuff, I take stable OS over bleeding edge OS every time

[04-Oct-18 09:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Alright I offered more than “I’m sorry”.   I won’t post the screenshot where you declined it though.   ❤️🐙

[04-Oct-18 09:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Let’s not be salty dogs about one small thing that was actually necessary for the survival of Pirate and let’s be salty sailors instead.  ❤️

[04-Oct-18 09:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
PS my offer still stands too.

[04-Oct-18 09:44 PM] Alright#0419
You had nothing to do with it. I don't want your money especially not with the conditions attached

[04-Oct-18 09:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Haha.   I only asked that you help with a goal my man.  No other conditions :realpirate:

[04-Oct-18 09:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I understand your position and respect it.

[04-Oct-18 09:46 PM] Alright#0419
I'd rather just completely separate myself from this project at this point

You’re the one responsible for me being here.  I owe you a debt of gratitude.

[04-Oct-18 09:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You’ve done something for me that I will likely be forever grateful and indebted to you for.... if only emotionally.

You may have very well given me the opportunity to change my life for the better my man... and that’s no small task since I pretty much liked my life to begin with.

[04-Oct-18 11:11 PM] Flexatron#8809
Today 100 Msol still?

[04-Oct-18 11:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have a feeling we will sustain this number for a while.  As more personal miners start using their equipment... less people will rent Nicehash time.

[04-Oct-18 11:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We may hit a stability level here Pretty soon.

[04-Oct-18 11:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Then again I thought that on Monday. 😂

[04-Oct-18 11:18 PM] Flexatron#8809
Is hash from our competitors dropping?

[04-Oct-18 11:50 PM] Llama#1330
why is the nethash so high lol

It's a privacy coin that is more private than XMR and as secure as Bitcoin.  

Get used to the hashrate.

@FishyGuts I believe you're wrong about rentals (that will have more to do with price than competition alone), but you're right about sustaining this kind of hash level as a new minimum range.

[05-Oct-18 12:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I meant rentals solely as a means to take advantage of the price action.

[05-Oct-18 12:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Regular rental miners will continue

[05-Oct-18 12:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
