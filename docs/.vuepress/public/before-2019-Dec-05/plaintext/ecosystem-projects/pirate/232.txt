Ahhh my bad, wires crossed, was meaning escrow

[27-Oct-18 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
If it's ARRR/KMD (or assetchain) then I can do escrow with no issues; I just never posted it because there's like 5 people that have

that twitter link worked for me

[27-Oct-18 04:40 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe your browser blocking t.co redirects? ü§î

[27-Oct-18 04:41 PM] SHossain#0007
sometimes browsers does that

[27-Oct-18 04:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[27-Oct-18 04:56 PM] Meyse#0952
I put the www. on purpose, not many people will understand pirate.black is a link I think. Worked fine on my end too tho

[27-Oct-18 05:13 PM] Oszy#5734
true. it should be https on the image üòõ

[27-Oct-18 05:14 PM] Oszy#5734
t.co link also takes me to http > timeout

[27-Oct-18 05:15 PM] Oszy#5734
can't you guys just redirect in the htaccess?

‚òù 

[27-Oct-18 06:05 PM] SHossain#0007
@Oszy i guess redirect is already setup.

[27-Oct-18 06:05 PM] Oszy#5734
non-www it is

[27-Oct-18 06:05 PM] Oszy#5734
plain pirate.black is ok

[27-Oct-18 06:06 PM] Oszy#5734
the link on twitter points to http tho it means someone typed that in manually and if that happens redirect don't work

[27-Oct-18 06:07 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, that could be the thing also.

[27-Oct-18 06:07 PM] SHossain#0007
also, if you use private mode of your browser, the http doesn't redirect to https

[27-Oct-18 06:08 PM] SHossain#0007
@webworker01 said it could be cloudflare issue

[27-Oct-18 06:08 PM] SHossain#0007
i guess the team will fix it soon

[27-Oct-18 06:55 PM] penguin#0544

[27-Oct-18 07:07 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
to make a simple site is more 200$ for sure not 2000$

[27-Oct-18 07:08 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
all people using CMS which makes 99% job done

[27-Oct-18 07:08 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622

[27-Oct-18 07:08 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
if you got content (text) it's about 1 day work for skilled guy

[27-Oct-18 07:08 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
anyway it'c CMS so content can be changed anytime

[27-Oct-18 07:09 PM] penguin#0544
layout presentation - decent design - can't be copy pasted though

[27-Oct-18 07:10 PM] penguin#0544
this is why there is so much derp, everyone uses templates and it kills the design industry

[27-Oct-18 07:11 PM] Bikob2#4549
cool design makes miracles

[27-Oct-18 07:11 PM] penguin#0544
pencil and paper planning still saves lifes.

If we want mass-adoption, we must market our coin, as world class product.

[27-Oct-18 07:16 PM] SHossain#0007
i like ionic framework. it is quite cool. though i can't code

[27-Oct-18 07:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How much

[27-Oct-18 07:16 PM] Bikob2#4549
I don't like XRP, but they market it exceptionally.

[27-Oct-18 07:16 PM] Oszy#5734
who does komodoplatform? that looks cool

[27-Oct-18 07:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
marketing only needs to be done exceptionally when the product is balls

[27-Oct-18 07:17 PM] Bikob2#4549
komodo is ok, not great

[27-Oct-18 07:17 PM] penguin#0544
this is true

[27-Oct-18 07:18 PM] Oszy#5734
it's true, i am here because of the product, i think i've been on the website once to find the discord link üòÑ

[27-Oct-18 07:18 PM] Oszy#5734
don't really care how it looks :p

[27-Oct-18 07:19 PM] penguin#0544
there's a website?

[27-Oct-18 07:19 PM] SHossain#0007
FishyGuts said he has been working on some graphics for the website

[27-Oct-18 07:20 PM] SHossain#0007
but, it would be nice to have a pro WP dev to design to build a professional looking site

[27-Oct-18 07:21 PM] Bikob2#4549
we don't even need WP. The site can be static, not much pages, only blog can be on WP

[27-Oct-18 07:23 PM] penguin#0544
