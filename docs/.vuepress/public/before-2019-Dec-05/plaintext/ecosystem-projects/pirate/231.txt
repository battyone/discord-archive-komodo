you need to type in https://

[27-Oct-18 10:17 AM] house#8741
Yeah should be forced ssl

[27-Oct-18 10:17 AM] Flexatron#8809
Worst of both worlds now

[27-Oct-18 10:35 AM] crumb#2550

[27-Oct-18 10:35 AM] Domoo#4108

@house Yes exact the glean one

[27-Oct-18 10:37 AM] house#8741

Three day average is now 102.8 Msol and ten days is 96.5Msol. The ten day average seems to be going up about 2Msol per day so we might cross 100Msol around Monday.

Our first article  is a moving how to.

[27-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Nioted aka Tedward#1071
hello all, I am interesting in buying ARRR in the #deleted-channel channel but how to I check people's references on the number of good trades they made.  Some people's ad claim 10+ successful trades but as a new buyer, I can I check that?

[27-Oct-18 03:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@Nioted aka Tedward  take your time, observe discussion and see who seems trustworthy

[27-Oct-18 03:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also there are team members you can trust - click on them and see roles

[27-Oct-18 03:44 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if you cannot trust - use another person as escrow - als oa team member or another trustworthy

[27-Oct-18 03:45 PM] Nioted aka Tedward#1071
is there a way I can search backlog chat to see a seller's references?

[27-Oct-18 03:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
scroll up?

[27-Oct-18 03:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Perhaps it’s time to create the “careful who you trade with pin”

[27-Oct-18 03:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
from current offers llama and AndrewK should be ok

[27-Oct-18 03:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I can do escrow for 0.5% each side

[27-Oct-18 03:46 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@FishyGuts  some lists of 100% trusted and 100% untrusted accounts would be nice

[27-Oct-18 03:49 PM] Nioted aka Tedward#1071
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋  so you can vouch for AndrewK?

[27-Oct-18 03:50 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Im only saying he's trading here for few weeks and I didnt see people complaining for him 😃

[27-Oct-18 03:50 PM] Nioted aka Tedward#1071
okay thanks for you help

[27-Oct-18 03:51 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@blackbeard  was confirmed to pay safe deposit to our dev guru, so you can also trade with him or use as escrow
