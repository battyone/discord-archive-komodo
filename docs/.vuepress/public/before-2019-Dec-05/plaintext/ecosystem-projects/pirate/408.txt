Last night we released a beta of our new mobile wallet with full sapling support.

Special thanks to @str4d whose light wallet work was invaluable.

[26-Nov-19 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> every decent project should be at least supported by naming it on our site

[26-Nov-19 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> e.g. there are a couple of free android forks, not sure which one is good but maybe someone could recommend

[26-Nov-19 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> same could be for hardware

[26-Nov-19 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> if we go for privacy it can either be 100% or nothing

[26-Nov-19 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> here's my question of the day, though (unrelated to 42):  When are we going to see more "user-friendly" wallet installs?  I can help by testing. I'm not really good at coding, but I'll help where I can if anybody has some direction they're already going with pirateocean or sevenseas

[28-Nov-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763

[28-Nov-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> SevenSeas on linux only works with the 0.8.0 from Radix42's repo. And even then, you have to start it from command line and leave that terminal open.  And the first time it won't find/start pirated on it's own.

[28-Nov-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> the sevenseas 0.7.9 from piratenetwrok repo doesn't have pirated or sevenseas binary

[28-Nov-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> I will try the lite wallet on mac later today. I know linux usually requires users to be a little more tech savvy then windows, but I still think it's nice to have easy to use wallets

[28-Nov-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `When are we going to see more "user-friendly" wallet installs? `
Shortly after someone stops using that phrase and defines it....

[28-Nov-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> User-Friendly = predictable and using  an interface and terms that are standardized.  
 
A user friendly program (or wallet) has several qualities. It must install easily and **predictably**, without arcane commands required. It should use a GUI and be available from a consistent source, such as Snap or a downloaded binary from pirate.black.  It should open to a gui interface with basic setup questions.  After install, it should work predictably, with minimal need for debug commands or restarts.
