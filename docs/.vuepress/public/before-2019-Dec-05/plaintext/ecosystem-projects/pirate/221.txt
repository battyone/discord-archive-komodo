once a company is made, without writing a "death clause or passing of the torch clause, or transcendence clause" into the framework, the company will seek to survive by any means necessary

[25-Oct-18 01:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I’m going to switch there.  Or piratechain.org

[25-Oct-18 01:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We should start spreading the hash

[25-Oct-18 01:52 AM] at#4177

polly pool whats the address?

[25-Oct-18 01:53 AM] Exile13#4458
and with supporting the greater good at least in mind, to know that operation is done by customers using the thing, there would be no need for the service otherwise

[25-Oct-18 01:55 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I’ll move mine to a zero hash pool tonight.

I totally thought btc was going to take a dive after it stabilized.

[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> i think the whale is still around

[25-Oct-18 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> and i think komodo is getting exposure with all the dpow talk going around

[25-Oct-18 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> if this keeps up we could moon by 2029
