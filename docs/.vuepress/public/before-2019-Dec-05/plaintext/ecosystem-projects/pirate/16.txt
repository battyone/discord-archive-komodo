@jl777c plz give me your z address. I'll send you all. do whatever you want

[04-Sep-18 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
use nicehash rates to calculate costs

[04-Sep-18 09:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can give it all for free.

[04-Sep-18 09:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Don't care of this bullshit

[04-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Alright#0419
I just hit it with some NH, I can try to give an estimate

[04-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Alright#0419
couple minutes

[04-Sep-18 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, then do that. but charge people mining costs

[04-Sep-18 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
sell it in lots of 5,000 at mining cost, limit 50 people

[04-Sep-18 09:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
anyone want to take these PIRATE coins and plz do that?

[04-Sep-18 09:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I will not be active on computer

[04-Sep-18 09:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
can't do such z tx all the time

[04-Sep-18 09:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
at least not till end of week

[04-Sep-18 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
I think we can get a list of people who want to be PIRATES and it can be processed this weekend

[04-Sep-18 09:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't really think it will solve anything honestly. fudders gonna fud

[04-Sep-18 09:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
doing just that

[04-Sep-18 09:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
done

[04-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Alright#0419
snapshot/airdrop is not possible, but a migration would be

[04-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Alright#0419
just very very annoying

[04-Sep-18 09:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If the community wants a fresh restart of PIRATE. I'd also strongly advise the same.

[04-Sep-18 09:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have no issues at all.

[04-Sep-18 09:14 PM] jl777c#5810
the community just wants to get cheap PIRATE

[04-Sep-18 09:14 PM] jl777c#5810
the 50 lots of 5000 PIRATE at 5KMD per lot solves this

[04-Sep-18 09:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
In fact I can't control this Assetchain. No single person can.

[04-Sep-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
a lot of hash went into the chain already, wouldnt be fair to the miners who did that, and they have contributed a lot more to PIRATE than some whiners on BCT.

[04-Sep-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
however their point that you prominently say "test chain" dont buy, while buying... it does seem contradictory

[04-Sep-18 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so now, the "dont buy" notices are removed

[04-Sep-18 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
community gets to by PIRATE for the same cost

[04-Sep-18 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
i think that solves the problem

[04-Sep-18 09:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
2201884.99934985 * 0.001 = 2201.8849993499 KMD

[04-Sep-18 09:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
is that the cost ?

[04-Sep-18 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, total cost so far

[04-Sep-18 09:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can give it.

[04-Sep-18 09:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Stop Pirate mining. Send the coins to me and I'll pay you.

[04-Sep-18 09:17 PM] Alright#0419
roughly 1000 coins costs 1 KMD to mine with NH

[04-Sep-18 09:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Restart PIRATE assetchain from start.

[04-Sep-18 09:17 PM] Alright#0419
that's not what he's saying

[04-Sep-18 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i advice against a restart, that is a bigger mess

[04-Sep-18 09:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The only mistake did I do is letting ppl know of this assetchain from my username.

[04-Sep-18 09:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I did not even started this.

[04-Sep-18 09:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was only talking about it

[04-Sep-18 09:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I liked the idea so I bought it

[04-Sep-18 09:18 PM] Alright#0419
slap the word AIRDROP on that BCT ANN, and it'll cheer up all the people complaining ðŸ˜‚

[04-Sep-18 09:19 PM] Alright#0419
I'm conflicted over restart vs continuing

[04-Sep-18 09:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have been telling here from the early days, that I'm just he community member

[04-Sep-18 09:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
why not anyone just post those comments and tell ppl

[04-Sep-18 09:19 PM] Alright#0419
I don't quite understand the need for a restart

[04-Sep-18 09:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
can do airdrop

[04-Sep-18 09:20 PM] jl777c#5810
all that is needed to do now is setaside 250,000 PIRATE, split it into 50 lots of 5000

[04-Sep-18 09:20 PM] Alright#0419
but if that's what we're doing, ðŸ¤· ok

[04-Sep-18 09:20 PM] jl777c#5810
first 50 to sign up, get their 5000 PIRATE

[04-Sep-18 09:20 PM] jl777c#5810
they need to post their z-address

[04-Sep-18 09:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can't manage it. anyone wants to do this management task ?

[04-Sep-18 09:22 PM] Alright#0419
what is the task at hand?

[04-Sep-18 09:22 PM] Alright#0419
organize an airdrop?

[04-Sep-18 09:22 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, sending up to 50 lots of 5000 PIRATE to people that post a zaddress

[04-Sep-18 09:22 PM] jl777c#5810
and pay the 5KMD. likely wont be anywhere near 50, but you never know

[04-Sep-18 09:23 PM] Alright#0419
people are still going to complain about that >.<

[04-Sep-18 09:23 PM] Alright#0419
gathering money like a week into the chain's existence doesn't seem like a good idea

[04-Sep-18 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
if it takes a week or 2 to get 50 people signed up, seems not much reason to complain

[04-Sep-18 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
250KMD isnt really that much money and can pay for web hosting and other costs

[04-Sep-18 09:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can't be here for long. have to leave now. Plz figure this out.
and let me know what you guys decide.

[04-Sep-18 09:24 PM] scubapanda#2485
I think having a pool or two would be important.

[04-Sep-18 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a pool

[04-Sep-18 09:25 PM] CHMEX#0686
http://pirate.komodostats.com   thats the pool

[04-Sep-18 09:26 PM] Alright#0419
what if we just announce a launch date, and migrate to a new chain

[04-Sep-18 09:26 PM] Alright#0419
say take a decimal place off of everyone's balances?

[04-Sep-18 09:26 PM] Alright#0419
maybe more?

[04-Sep-18 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
or the best option IMO

[04-Sep-18 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
keep going

[04-Sep-18 09:28 PM] Alright#0419
do nothing?

[04-Sep-18 09:28 PM] scubapanda#2485
Very nice, didn't know! For an average user 'Getting Started' could contain a line 'how to mine'?

[04-Sep-18 09:28 PM] CHMEX#0686
I can prove that i have a certain balance in a z_address right?

[04-Sep-18 09:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
later guys. this kinda ruined an important day of the year of mine already. ðŸ˜¦

[04-Sep-18 09:30 PM] Alright#0419
burning coins would also have the same effect as selling them at cost, no?

[04-Sep-18 09:30 PM] Alright#0419
seems easier to do also

[04-Sep-18 09:31 PM] Alright#0419
we could say "we're burning the first x days of block rewards and chain is staying as is"

[04-Sep-18 09:31 PM] jl777c#5810
but that wont appease the "community" at BCT

[04-Sep-18 09:31 PM] jl777c#5810
plus airdropping/lowcost is a good way to get more people involved

[04-Sep-18 09:31 PM] scubapanda#2485
@webworker01 Thanks! I have no HW to mine Pirate but I think a lot will join the pool once it's public knowledge.

[04-Sep-18 09:31 PM] jl777c#5810
pool should be on the OP

[04-Sep-18 09:34 PM] Alright#0419
I am willing to organize a burn. This way I wouldn't have to deal with the BCT community, and would only have to deal with people here

[04-Sep-18 09:35 PM] Alright#0419
I'm not interested in doing 50 OTC trades with BCT members

[04-Sep-18 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810
but dont we want to increase the size of the community?

[04-Sep-18 09:35 PM] Alright#0419
ðŸ¤”

[04-Sep-18 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
who knows, if we just get a handful of new people via this, it would be well worth the effort

[04-Sep-18 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
which comes down to copy pasting and sending at most, 50 tx

[04-Sep-18 09:36 PM] Alright#0419
the copy and pasting isn't the problem, it's having to deal with the people to be frank

[04-Sep-18 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
just make them post a zaddress, that will get rid of most

[04-Sep-18 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
and the ones that make a PIRATE zaddress, they are basically a PIRATE already

[04-Sep-18 09:39 PM] Alright#0419
At the moment, I'm swamped with staked and burn protocol stuff. I'll be back in a couple hours. I'll think about it

[04-Sep-18 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
this is something that should be at least a week out if not 2 weeks

[04-Sep-18 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
to give people enough time to find out

[04-Sep-18 09:44 PM] scubapanda#2485
Pirate is the best live implementation of what a privacy coin can right now be. Please, please donâ€™t let it die!

[04-Sep-18 09:55 PM] CHMEX#0686
57% of mined coins are shielded now

[04-Sep-18 10:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
AirDrop for kmd holders? :trollface:

[04-Sep-18 10:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
Iâ€™m gonna start my own VIKING chain ðŸ¤­

[05-Sep-18 12:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Deleted User do it!

[05-Sep-18 12:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
But be careful 
Just informing community about the chain will put a blame on u for whatever happens to it.

[05-Sep-18 12:07 AM] CrisF#3405
@grewalsatinder Hi, haven't been able to read all yet, just up to your offer of coins.
If you are still offering I'd be grateful for coins.  Cpu mining didn't last long for me!

[05-Sep-18 12:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If only the faucet contract worked on pirate ðŸ¤”
