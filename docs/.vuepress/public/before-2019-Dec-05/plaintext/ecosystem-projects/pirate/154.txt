4chan? Did someone get WLC working and zap us back to 2004?

I know it’s lonely in your miner cave, but there are multiple venues harboring cryptophiles

[12-Oct-18 03:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And that's not the only -philes 4chan harbors 🙄

Reminds me of the horse vet who told me “only crummy people know what ketamine is”

[12-Oct-18 03:49 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Keep that head buried, I told him

[12-Oct-18 03:49 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
(He mentioned multiple break-ins at his office, I asked if they were dopers after ketamine)

there were still some people on the old pool, but only 2. it is off now. please, reconnect to https://arrr.pool-mining.xyz! just change your miner stratum host to `stratum.arrr.pool-mining.xyz` (ports are the same, `8888` for low diff and `18888` for hi-diff/nh). old pool is now off. better to not mine than to mine without the chance to find any blocks 😛

[12-Oct-18 06:15 AM] 0x03#8822
i just started to rinse out the old payments, one payout has been done already. a lot of <25PIRATE totals to rinse out

[12-Oct-18 06:28 AM] 0x03#8822
at around noon today (spoken in GMT/UTC as usual) i'll finally turn off the old pool. if anybody feels something is wrong/open/unfinished related to the old setup, kindly drop me a pm about the matter

nice, NH warns users to check the URL using a screenshot of an old chrome version which displays more cert data than it does now

[12-Oct-18 07:18 AM] 0x03#8822
real pros right there.

[12-Oct-18 07:18 AM] 0x03#8822
side fun fact; the warning first showed up AFTER chrome without cert-holder-name in the display was released.

[12-Oct-18 07:36 AM] abcdelweb#0752
ok if you give me $ 10 in any cryptoneta swappable doge ... lite..ecc I send you 60 arrr

[12-Oct-18 09:22 AM] CHMEX#0686
I have heard now a few people suggesting adding a sell feature on a website something like offloading.
Do you think there should be a place to offload PIRATES for KMD?

yes

[12-Oct-18 09:24 AM] 0x03#8822
yes from me

[12-Oct-18 09:25 AM] abcdelweb#0752
I think there should be a chance to change pirates with others

[12-Oct-18 09:25 AM] Flexatron#8809
Hmm would that be possible?

[12-Oct-18 09:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
off-ramping. so your going to subsidize mining.

[12-Oct-18 09:25 AM] Flexatron#8809
Guess below mining costs?

[12-Oct-18 09:27 AM] CHMEX#0686
I would also be particular interested in a big miners opinion I see he's typing now

[12-Oct-18 09:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If we add offloading to any site that we send people to, miners might as well just expect to bag everything they get

[12-Oct-18 09:28 AM] abcdelweb#0752
you can limit the change

[12-Oct-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just make the buy order liek a spread of 25%

[12-Oct-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if they want to dump they can lose money

limit isn't going to change the fact that most people will opt to make 30000000 small sales to a trusted site than look for someone *to* trust

[12-Oct-18 09:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because, human nature

[12-Oct-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so have more than one site ...

[12-Oct-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if someone wants to buy

[12-Oct-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they can decrese the margin ?

[12-Oct-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
although yes

[12-Oct-18 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
one whale with enogh buy pressure withh get ALL the pirate like that

[12-Oct-18 09:32 AM] actionslacks#4072
the pirate reserve

[12-Oct-18 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
provided there are people dumping ... isee a lot of sell orders all the time ... but the price dposnt nessarlly fall that much

[12-Oct-18 09:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think it would be a cool experiment

{Reactions}
🤦🏼 

[12-Oct-18 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
depends how much you want there to be one giant whale

[12-Oct-18 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how doe sthe onboarding/offboarding site work if there are no buyers ?

[12-Oct-18 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a  LOT of pirate mined every day

[12-Oct-18 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and there is a LOT of days left at this rate ...

[12-Oct-18 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if 50% of miners just dump into offbaord

[12-Oct-18 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you get one massive whale

[12-Oct-18 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
who can controil the price '

[12-Oct-18 09:37 AM] actionslacks#4072
how does the whale control the price? by dumping then buying cheap?

[12-Oct-18 09:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Because that whale also controls onboarding

[12-Oct-18 09:39 AM] actionslacks#4072
timelock it?

[12-Oct-18 09:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because most users know how to do that, especially most new users, right?

[12-Oct-18 09:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
the pirate bank locks all sold pirate for x amount of time after sale, or only releases for sale when demand threshold/price point is reached? idk just spit balling. sound like a foray into monetary policy.

[12-Oct-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just hurry up and get exchage

[12-Oct-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
:trollface:

[12-Oct-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The entire reason we went with notary nodes and allthat stuff for staked was just so we could have 1 chain an CEX could run so the free market could detrermine its price.

[12-Oct-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
becasue no CEX was going to update every week

[12-Oct-18 09:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@actionslacks Next question...
How would it benefit miners (or even regular users) for CHMEX to have 3 million PIRATE that unlock next week, rather than at time of buy?

[12-Oct-18 09:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah, it would only benefit holders of pirate.

[12-Oct-18 09:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
its pretty much small scale currency manipulation

[12-Oct-18 09:51 AM] actionslacks#4072
do we got a central banker here?

[12-Oct-18 09:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`do we got a central banker here?`
At the point where we have on and off boarding on an 'official' site, yes

[12-Oct-18 09:55 AM] actionslacks#4072
we just have to create the magic algorithm that keeps everyone happy

[12-Oct-18 09:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

hashrate \  supply * onboard price - avg kwh cost * difficulty + 🌈

[12-Oct-18 10:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
avg kwh cost is meaningles with 4 types of equipment and like 80+% of hash being rented

[12-Oct-18 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems a bad idea to have the centralized site doing unlimited onboard/offboarding

[12-Oct-18 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
not to mention big problems of available capital

[12-Oct-18 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
onboarding is currently designed to be able to scale on a self-sustaining basis

[12-Oct-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
its purpose is onboard and rewards

[12-Oct-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
adding the burden to it to solve the as of yet unsolved central banking problem... seems a real FTL drive might be easier

[12-Oct-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
the market needs to provide the buyside

[12-Oct-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
I put a very far away floor, but with unlimited volume

[12-Oct-18 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
that at least gives a worst case and I expect the market to tighten above that, especially if mining costs are more

[12-Oct-18 10:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm 100% in favor of onboarding, because any short-term losses miners see from it are outweighed by the long-term benefits of what is to be done with the funds.
I'm not a fan of an instadump inverse of onboarding though.

[12-Oct-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
it is like short circuit. not covered by warranty

[12-Oct-18 10:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The irony is that I would benefit from having the feature, short-term, I'm just not sure I can see the long-term good of it (offloading).

[12-Oct-18 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
even the bank of england couldnt do it

[12-Oct-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
against a single soros

[12-Oct-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
granted leverage was invloved

[12-Oct-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
but if there is any arbitrage, then chmex capital becomes 100% KMD or 100% PIRATE, thus disabling one or the other

[12-Oct-18 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
to do this two sided market making would prevent it from being able to do the rewards automation, which believe me, all pirates will want

[12-Oct-18 10:13 AM] actionslacks#4072
the pirate bank

[12-Oct-18 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a short term problem caused by the onboarding having to set a price, rather that to get it from tortuga.exchange

[12-Oct-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
in general it is a bad idea to make long term structural changes with lower future outcomes to solve a small short term issue, where a 30ksol miner is spamming that he cant offload his massive PIRATE stack

[12-Oct-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
even more so, when the problem is temporary

The simple solution for that is `well, ya knew that going in, stfu` :trollface:

[12-Oct-18 10:16 AM] actionslacks#4072
so its a band aid, but whats this rewards automation about?

[12-Oct-18 10:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
possible tortuga feature?

[12-Oct-18 10:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@actionslacks There are many things planned for the future with regards to where the onboarding funds go and what's to be done with them. A lot of these plans haven't been made public (there were some hints dropped along the way), but the things I know of (including marketing) are such that I'm a fan.

[12-Oct-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
onboarding is just the first part of it
