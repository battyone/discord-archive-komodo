i think just adjust pool fee, it will adjust the load

OK - the https://pirate.black/ website is now updated with all (\o/) the pools and core info. still has the ugly color layout tho 😛

INTRO PIRATE is the best of Zcash (ZEC) combined with the best of Monero (XMR). It’s a forced Shielded-transactions (z-transactions) only blockchain, meant for completely anonymous transactions. PIRATE is mined into a transparent address, but can only go into a shielded add...

no idea how to fix that

[22-Oct-18 09:53 AM] jorian#4555
seems there was no update to the theme on github

there is some web 'frontend' to manage this thing somewhere 'below' github.com

if i only found the url back it would be awesome

[22-Oct-18 09:58 AM] SHossain#0007
@jorian as far as i know the current website uses WP and the team needs a  front-end WP dev to design it nicely

[22-Oct-18 09:59 AM] 0x03#8822
WP? y tho

[22-Oct-18 09:59 AM] 0x03#8822
the github pages was fully OK

[22-Oct-18 09:59 AM] jorian#4555
so until then, why not switch back to the black site?

[22-Oct-18 10:00 AM] 0x03#8822
it's not like this has to have tons of dynamic features on the website already. you can embed images and links and stuff, that is a lot

[22-Oct-18 10:00 AM] jorian#4555
that black one had some uniqueness, some misteriousness around it

hi all!!

[22-Oct-18 12:24 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I've read zcash has a "payment disclosure" experimental feature, this will be useful for Pirate. You can prove to an arbitrator that a payment has been done, so easier integration with p2p marketplaces or fiat/crypto DEX like Bisq https://medium.com/@_garethtdavies/an-introduction-to-payment-disclosure-in-zcash-96748c209d49

outside, was presented at a conference and requires schnorr signatures

[22-Oct-18 12:29 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
a CC for that will take some time

[22-Oct-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
hopefully one of the researchers will write the CC

it is perfect for testing just specific enhancements to crypto signing

[22-Oct-18 12:31 PM] house#8741
James ... have you heard of the eos-forum.org ... fully censorship resistant and written with C++ ... I have a good feeling about it and wonder if it could be replicated here

[22-Oct-18 12:32 PM] house#8741
for journalists etc ... could be exciting times ahead

blackjokr is working on a chain that can stream at 256kb/sec using arbitrary data, audio, video, text, mix and with dPoW it is censorproof

@KomodoWorld Have you tried disclosure to see if it works as described?

[22-Oct-18 12:35 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
no, I just found the article

[22-Oct-18 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the geocold streaming fiasco led to the idea for making a decentralized streamer

[22-Oct-18 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
blockchain, with dPoW

[22-Oct-18 12:36 PM] snowdamn#2414
lol

[22-Oct-18 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
I have a feeling PIRATE blazed the trail for the community created chains that get a life of its own.

[22-Oct-18 12:36 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I was looking for addition of Pirate to Bisq, but they require that an arbitrator can verify tx in case of dispute. So they don't even support z-addresses for now

the STREAM chain would be able to handle a lot of different use cases, just need a different codec GUI for each one

IMO the hardest part is solved

[22-Oct-18 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Unless the apparent easy part proves difficult

[22-Oct-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
the hardest part is making paying STREAM to the blockchain to autospawn a custom broadcast chain

[22-Oct-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and hooking that up to the GUI in a sane way

[22-Oct-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
btw it didnt crash on me before ... it ran out of coins ... it was sending so quickly i didnt notice it run out 😂

you can stream anything ... right now I just generate random data with a 10 line C program then push it into marketmaker via bash and curl

this sounds fucking awesome

[22-Oct-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as its hex string

[22-Oct-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it works... and each chunk can be of any size

[22-Oct-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and it checks if the hex is valid

[22-Oct-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
before sending

[22-Oct-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The  limit appears to be outgoing network bandwidth...

[22-Oct-18 12:41 PM] 0x03#8822
what would be the expected delay between sending and recieving it on 'any of the clients'? most mp3 streaming solutions introduce about a 30-60s delay into the whole thing

[22-Oct-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on a local VM -> local VM same machine it seems almost infinatly fast, confirmed blocks 😮

[22-Oct-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but when I treied to send from node in Perth -> node in asia, where miner was, it just failed ... the node sending needs to mine all the blocks

[22-Oct-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
mempool delay would be a few seconds unless a lot of peers

[22-Oct-18 12:42 PM] 0x03#8822
is 500 a lot?

[22-Oct-18 12:42 PM] 0x03#8822
or 5000?
