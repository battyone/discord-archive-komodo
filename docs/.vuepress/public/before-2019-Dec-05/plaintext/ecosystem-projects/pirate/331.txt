have ~45 minutes, I'll test that z txs work normally

[23-Nov-18 05:14 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alright when did you last update to FSM?

[23-Nov-18 05:14 PM] Alright#0419
couple minutes

[23-Nov-18 05:14 PM] SHossain#0007
the last commit makes everything easier

[23-Nov-18 05:14 PM] SHossain#0007
nice

[23-Nov-18 05:14 PM] Alright#0419
easier how?

[23-Nov-18 05:15 PM] SHossain#0007
only `src/komodo_defs.h` file needs changing with the current timestamp and sapling will be activated

[23-Nov-18 05:15 PM] Alright#0419
have everything in my branch other than this 
`https://github.com/jl777/komodo/commit/1b726e61fa8c10e689662efcca4861e403547769`

[23-Nov-18 05:15 PM] Alright#0419
should be fine

[23-Nov-18 05:15 PM] Alright#0419
yes, that's what we're doing

[23-Nov-18 05:15 PM] SHossain#0007
no need to uncomment `//` from inside `src/main.cpp` file

[23-Nov-18 05:15 PM] ronyi#5719
PIA or ARRRT?

[23-Nov-18 05:15 PM] Alright#0419
PIA

[23-Nov-18 05:16 PM] Alright#0419
it will activate in ~45 minutes

[23-Nov-18 05:16 PM] ronyi#5719
okay i stop ARRRT node

[23-Nov-18 05:16 PM] Alright#0419
I want to get some coins in z address to test that sprout works properly after activation

[23-Nov-18 05:16 PM] Alright#0419
and just do general z tx testing

[23-Nov-18 05:17 PM] Alright#0419
right now, just testing general sapling activation, not testing ac_private with it yet

[23-Nov-18 05:17 PM] Alright#0419
oh might as well do both

[23-Nov-18 05:17 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm starting a PIA node from jl777's FSM branch

[23-Nov-18 05:17 PM] Alright#0419
I'll get another chain up with ac_private

[23-Nov-18 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
ac_private is not really working right yet

[23-Nov-18 05:18 PM] Alright#0419
won't work unless you match the timestamp @SHossain

[23-Nov-18 05:18 PM] Alright#0419
so don't bother with ac_private chain?

[23-Nov-18 05:18 PM] Alright#0419
only takes a moment, but if you know for sure it won't work, I won't bother

[23-Nov-18 05:20 PM] Alright#0419
@SHossain if you use jl's FSM branch, do this before you build it

ok. i'll build with that timestamp

[23-Nov-18 05:21 PM] Alright#0419
someone just started it with `-gen`

[23-Nov-18 05:21 PM] Alright#0419
don't do that

[23-Nov-18 05:21 PM] Alright#0419
you mined a new genesis block

[23-Nov-18 05:22 PM] Alright#0419
stop node, `rm -r ~/.komodo/PIA` then start the chain without -gen

[23-Nov-18 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
you can use an -ac_private chain for testing mining pool as it is the coinbase that needs to be sapling

[23-Nov-18 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
just dont expect it to allow sprout -> taddr

[23-Nov-18 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
that will be fixed soon, of course

[23-Nov-18 05:31 PM] Alright#0419
my nodes forked, not sure how

[23-Nov-18 05:31 PM] Alright#0419

[23-Nov-18 05:32 PM] Alright#0419
other node is at

[23-Nov-18 05:33 PM] Alright#0419
is a fork, not just lagging behind

[23-Nov-18 05:33 PM] Alright#0419
no indication why it forked

doesn't have `-ac_private=1` on the chain param?

[23-Nov-18 05:36 PM] Alright#0419
is intended

[23-Nov-18 05:36 PM] Alright#0419
making ac_private chain now

[23-Nov-18 05:36 PM] SHossain#0007

Did a t -> z on PIA, forked shortly after

[23-Nov-18 05:41 PM] Alright#0419
not sure if that's related, but someone please try the same please

[23-Nov-18 05:42 PM] ronyi#5719
Now PIA or PPIA?

[23-Nov-18 05:42 PM] Alright#0419
we have two, one with ac_private, one without

[23-Nov-18 05:43 PM] Alright#0419
my node keeps lagging behind it seems

[23-Nov-18 05:43 PM] Alright#0419
one of them

[23-Nov-18 05:43 PM] Alright#0419
same exact build

[23-Nov-18 05:44 PM] Alright#0419
someone please test t -> z on PIA

[23-Nov-18 05:44 PM] Alright#0419
within the next 15 minutes

[23-Nov-18 05:45 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alright there is a -ac_private specific bug fix pushed into FSM branch

[23-Nov-18 05:45 PM] Alright#0419
it seems it still hangs, just in different places now

[23-Nov-18 05:46 PM] SHossain#0007
just a min ago

[23-Nov-18 05:46 PM] Alright#0419
so synced 4 blocks then stopped

[23-Nov-18 05:46 PM] Alright#0419
now hanging

[23-Nov-18 05:46 PM] Alright#0419
so my node kept doing that, then mining it's own fork

[23-Nov-18 05:46 PM] Alright#0419
doesn't reorg

[23-Nov-18 05:47 PM] Alright#0419
ok, then it synced up to 115, didn't get 116

[23-Nov-18 05:47 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alright let's start a new chain with latest fix from James' FSM branch

[23-Nov-18 05:47 PM] Alright#0419
seems to get some blocks, hang a bit, get some more blocks, hang a bit

[23-Nov-18 05:48 PM] SHossain#0007
so, we test lastest source

[23-Nov-18 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
did you pull my fix for syncing small networks?

[23-Nov-18 05:48 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[23-Nov-18 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe for now, just have a single mining node?

[23-Nov-18 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
then there wont be a fork

[23-Nov-18 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
short chains are very unstable and fork very easily

[23-Nov-18 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
latest version has initial attempt at -ac_private rules

[23-Nov-18 05:49 PM] Alright#0419
not like this typically

[23-Nov-18 05:50 PM] Alright#0419
it seems to be doing the same thing as before, but occasionally accepting blocks

same thing as before, just synced to latest chain at start then got stuck

[23-Nov-18 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
sapling -> taddr never allowed, sprout -> taddr allowed, taddr -> taddr not allowed, all excepting notary addresses

[23-Nov-18 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the bug fix I made has it so the mining node needs to mine blocks for it to send headers, i think

[23-Nov-18 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
the other node should be printing                 fprintf(stderr,"request headers from failed process block peer\n");

[23-Nov-18 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
so the mining node mines a block, broadcasts it, the other peers get an error and then request headers

[23-Nov-18 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
make sure to use the latest version as a basis

[23-Nov-18 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
just fixed a taddr -> taddr hole

[23-Nov-18 05:54 PM] Alright#0419
one that existed since launch?

[23-Nov-18 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
or recently introduced?

[23-Nov-18 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
for sapling activated chain

[23-Nov-18 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
quite recently introduce. or more like never properly blocked as sapling just started being there

[23-Nov-18 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
so other than whatever bugs, -ac_private mode could actually be working decently now

[23-Nov-18 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
I have seen chains activate sapling on-the-fly

[23-Nov-18 05:56 PM] Alright#0419
