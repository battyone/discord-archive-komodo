seems like diff has gone down? when looking at the chart

[02-Dec-18 01:18 PM] mrlynch#5735
oh yea... 48 now 😁 it was close to 60 about 1H ago

[02-Dec-18 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`have another nh order that's not doing as well as the previous one`
stop using a public pool and math correctly

[02-Dec-18 01:19 PM] mrlynch#5735
not sure i want to setup my own stratum at the moment 😄

[02-Dec-18 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then don't try to blame nethash for why your math is off 😛

[02-Dec-18 01:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
unless you're willing to let yourself pestered with (most likely silly) questions about setting it up 😄

[02-Dec-18 01:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
```at current NH prices & relatively low diff. (not average over 24H)```
not the math, the results are off, because i did not take into account an average of the net diff over the past 24H

[02-Dec-18 01:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
it was just a quick calculation to see roughly how much profit that dude made in the dump

[02-Dec-18 01:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
emphasis on estimate / ball park

[02-Dec-18 01:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
not actual analysis 😄

[02-Dec-18 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1) mine is calculated at higher than 48
2) pool making payments can actively slow your finding blocks; because, sprout
3) ya math bad

[02-Dec-18 01:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
😂

[02-Dec-18 01:25 PM] mrlynch#5735
so, your suggestion is to setup a stratum of my own and hit that?

[02-Dec-18 01:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
in terms of server would a VPS do?

[02-Dec-18 01:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
never built a pool before

[02-Dec-18 01:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can do on a VPS or on your livingroom NAS

[02-Dec-18 01:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
hmm... tell me more... i actually have a NAS that's not put to use atm. can you point me to some docs? what to look out for?

[02-Dec-18 01:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
as i'm pretty sure this is a bit different than setting up any other pool due to sprout (could be wrong)

`as i'm pretty sure this is a bit different than setting up any other pool due to sprout (could be wrong)`
yes, you're wrong; "sprout" is what we've been using "forever" now

[02-Dec-18 01:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
and then use webworker's stratum git?

[02-Dec-18 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1st there's a sprout
then it overwinters
and becomes a sapling

[02-Dec-18 01:37 PM] mrlynch#5735
thanks for clearing that... as i said, never setup a pool, let alone 1 that needs to handle z-tx

[02-Dec-18 01:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and then use webworker's stratum git?`
afaik, it does work for current PIRATE

[02-Dec-18 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
personally, for solo (even most of it still) I use `https://github.com/aayanl/equihash-solomining`

[02-Dec-18 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure what the current state of that project is, though, I downloaded my copy like a yr ago and have made many personal edits

[02-Dec-18 01:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
thank you for that!

[02-Dec-18 01:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
learning time 😃

`Latest commit 38cea0c on Apr 2, 2017`
heh, I guess teh current state is the same as when I dled it 😛

[02-Dec-18 04:42 PM] Llama#1330
Dang I’m gonna have to stock up on some arrr soon

Anybody have problems sending Arrr to DigitalPrice? I sent some this morning and they are still not there. On DP Pirate "My Balance" page it says that withdrawal are not possible, but  deposits are.

[02-Dec-18 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's the cosmos telling you not to dump so low

@Llama long time no see

[02-Dec-18 05:34 PM] Llama#1330
Yeah

[02-Dec-18 05:40 PM] kp#3190
Pirate is a scam!! (pls dump on my bids) 👀

[02-Dec-18 05:42 PM] burbank#1598
I doubt a scare tactic would work here

[02-Dec-18 05:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
@kp 😂 bahaha 😂 that was funny

[02-Dec-18 05:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
gtf outta here 😠 😡

[02-Dec-18 05:51 PM] kp#3190
relax man

[02-Dec-18 05:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
🔥

[02-Dec-18 05:53 PM] burbank#1598
I was wondering if this sapling update should be considered a good thing or a bad thing? I realize it open things up but it just seems a problem that a step is required or your coins burn down.

[02-Dec-18 05:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
it is a very good thing

[02-Dec-18 05:56 PM] burbank#1598
Just seems something that scares away mainstream people. I am a noob so it scared me that holdings could be wiped out and since you don’t really have a account you can’t be notified

[02-Dec-18 05:57 PM] burbank#1598
I get it that we are on the cutting edge

[02-Dec-18 05:57 PM] mrlynch#5735
so... you need to update the daemon by 15th December

[02-Dec-18 05:58 PM] mrlynch#5735
after 15th December and before 15th Feb 2019 if you already have funds in a zc (sprout) address you will need to migrate them to a zs (sapling) address

[02-Dec-18 05:59 PM] mrlynch#5735
- you will need to generate a zs (sapling address)
- the migration process will be relatively seamless. there is a dapp for it and you'll need to run one 1 line command and that's it

[02-Dec-18 06:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
after 15th December users will not be able to generate zc (sprout) addresses, therefore if there are new users after 15th December they need not worry

[02-Dec-18 06:00 PM] burbank#1598
Agreed. I realize that the early folks like us are very likely to be engaged but still

[02-Dec-18 06:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
instructions will be posted on how to go through the whole process before 15th December

[02-Dec-18 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
sprout addresses will work until feb 15th, but it is advised to switch to sapling for all usage as soon as possible

[02-Dec-18 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is still just several months old. having a 2 months transition period is a significant percentage of its entire lifetime

the exchange servers just cannot keep up with the calcs needed from the sprout tx

[02-Dec-18 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
if we want a running exchange, we cannot be allowing sprout

[02-Dec-18 06:02 PM] mrlynch#5735
have edited my comment above to avoid confusion in regards to zc addresses

[02-Dec-18 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
some transactions are literally taking hours to complete

[02-Dec-18 06:04 PM] burbank#1598
I am only having an academic thought here. I am sure practically all of us will be fine but the issue is related to forking as well. The idea that what you think a coin is today is subject to change. It’s already difficult to explain crypto.  Increases perception of risk.

[02-Dec-18 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
pirates just need to make a big noise to make sure all will know to zmigrate

[02-Dec-18 06:04 PM] burbank#1598
I am thrilled these changes makes the flow much more efficient

[02-Dec-18 06:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
@jl777c noise shall be made :pirate:

[02-Dec-18 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
ultimately all cryptocoins are based on complex software

[02-Dec-18 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
that it needs to be updated, well, that should not be any surprise

[02-Dec-18 06:05 PM] burbank#1598
The idea of using ARRR at POS at a store is an incredible vision.

[02-Dec-18 06:06 PM] burbank#1598
Just excited to be on the train this early

[02-Dec-18 06:07 PM] burbank#1598
@jl777c  ha even you would get frustrated explaining things to my mother

[02-Dec-18 06:07 PM] burbank#1598
Heh

[02-Dec-18 06:08 PM] burbank#1598
Maybe we should create ARRR gift cards and send them around for Christmas

[02-Dec-18 06:09 PM] burbank#1598
Force crypto on family and friends

[02-Dec-18 06:09 PM] burbank#1598
Sorry I need more coffee

[02-Dec-18 06:11 PM] burbank#1598
Or send to crypto journalists

[02-Dec-18 06:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
not a bad idea

[02-Dec-18 06:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
get the qr code from @Cryptofist

[02-Dec-18 06:17 PM] burbank#1598
Well I guess there is another reason why we need sapling. A web wallet would work better to send a loaded wallet as a gift card.

[02-Dec-18 06:18 PM] burbank#1598
My family isn’t going to install Agama and Activate Coin and wait for the sync.

[02-Dec-18 06:19 PM] burbank#1598
Kind of scary that you’d have to send the wallet key along with the gift card unless someone can think of a better way to gift ARRR to someone without a wallet

[02-Dec-18 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
lite mode is needed

[02-Dec-18 06:20 PM] burbank#1598
Doesn’t have to be a Christmas

[02-Dec-18 06:21 PM] burbank#1598
I have heard of crypto gift cards. How mainstream sounding. Maybe sell them at CVS on the gift card wall.

[02-Dec-18 06:21 PM] burbank#1598
I haven’t heard I mean

[02-Dec-18 06:21 PM] burbank#1598
Jump over a huge number of coins in terms of awareness

[02-Dec-18 06:23 PM] burbank#1598
At least you could give 1000ARRR instead of .00000002 BTC (bad math)

[02-Dec-18 06:23 PM] burbank#1598
Sounds more substantial

[02-Dec-18 06:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Well I guess there is another reason why we need sapling. `
because growth and improvements isn't enough of a reason?

[02-Dec-18 06:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Sounds more substantial`
I don't always pick the currency with the most whole number of digits per dollar, but when I do I like to spend 190000000 CoinX on Dos Equis

[02-Dec-18 06:55 PM] DmanXX#2257
My withdrawals are ARRR disabled in DP how to move my coins to Agama?

[02-Dec-18 06:55 PM] KOSIUS#0001
u wait, till they re-enable them

[02-Dec-18 06:56 PM] DmanXX#2257
How about new version of Agama, when do we need to update? Is it ready?

[02-Dec-18 06:57 PM] KOSIUS#0001
as far as I know the new agama version isn't out yet

[02-Dec-18 06:57 PM] SHossain#0007
by the end of next week

[02-Dec-18 06:59 PM] DmanXX#2257
Yeah but end of next week is fork, so we gonna have few hours to update ?

[02-Dec-18 06:59 PM] KOSIUS#0001
sapling is on 14th

[02-Dec-18 06:59 PM] DmanXX#2257
Yes and supposed to update Waller before that right?

[02-Dec-18 06:59 PM] SHossain#0007
sapling activates on 15th. you have about 2 weeks left

[02-Dec-18 07:00 PM] SHossain#0007
Most likely 1 week before the update, you will get Agama

[02-Dec-18 07:00 PM] DmanXX#2257
I don’t have two weeks , there no updated wallet available yet

[02-Dec-18 07:02 PM] KOSIUS#0001
u'll get new agama wallet by the end of next week

[02-Dec-18 07:02 PM] KOSIUS#0001
and sapling is on 15th of December

[02-Dec-18 07:02 PM] KOSIUS#0001
and today is the 2nd of Dec

[02-Dec-18 07:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`My withdrawals are ARRR disabled in DP how to move my coins to Agama?`
Until they open and process withdraws, they aren't your coins

[02-Dec-18 07:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I don’t have two weeks`
Are you dying in 13 days?
