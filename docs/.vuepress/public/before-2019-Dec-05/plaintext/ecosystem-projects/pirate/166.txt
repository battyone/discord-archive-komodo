Well, there's the other problem, current hash is down because of sell-ability turnover not being as rapid as last week

[14-Oct-18 11:15 AM] scubapanda#2485
In my calculations the cost of adding 20Msol from MiningRigRentals is now about 0,14-15KMD/Pirate. I guess NH is a bit cheaper.

[14-Oct-18 11:15 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
few people know about the pirate. need more translations

[14-Oct-18 11:16 AM] BlockTech#6895
I looked in Mining Rig Rentals for 50Ksol, it's about 0,09KMD per pirate. 
But bigger mining rig are sometime expensive ^^

[14-Oct-18 11:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nh is about 0.09 to 0.12 KMD for  fixed; standard can be less but all that goes with that

[14-Oct-18 11:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
A website that calculates the % of zaddr xtns on every ZEC-related chain, let's say per day. Rank by smallest % of transparent xtns

[14-Oct-18 11:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
I think I know who will be at the top of the list

[14-Oct-18 11:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
sounds like great marketing if somebody wants to build it

[14-Oct-18 11:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
I have been thinking of building this myself for a while, before Pirate existed, but haven't had time

[14-Oct-18 11:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My next question, and this goes back to a point james made, is anyone factoring dwindling supply into their costs/pricing?

[14-Oct-18 11:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
compare all ZEC forks, with various metrics. Most sites really suck and don't have data related to shielded stuff

[14-Oct-18 11:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
ZCL has 24% of their supply mined already: https://onchainfx.com/asset/zclassic

All we have to do is beat these numbers and ZCL miners come to PIRATE

_wonders if he will ever sell his ZCL given that his "do not sell under" board still has $20 listed_

[14-Oct-18 11:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
oh gosh

[14-Oct-18 11:23 AM] CHMEX#0686
Some more numbers
There are now 1000 visitors to dexstats. Before pirate was started there where about 400 each day so there is a clear PIRATE effect.
Website calls in the whole website went from 1.5m to 3m per day - more and more websites grab data.

that's OK, @dukeleto HUSH is still listed on the board for $2 😝

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i have it at $50 😉

Just like nobody could have predicted the last crazy bull market, the next will also surprise us

users flock to shiny GUI wallets. I don't quite get it, but it's true. No matter how much I hate dealing with binaries on Windows, it's true

[14-Oct-18 11:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
it will always be true

[14-Oct-18 11:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@dukeleto having ZCL miners would be great; attracting ZCL buyers to Arrr even more great :pirate:

{Reactions}
👆🏼 💯 

[14-Oct-18 11:33 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I would say actually marketing most important. Here the logic: marketing attracts people, people create demand, demand increase prices, prices attract miners. Im good? :coolpirate:

[14-Oct-18 11:34 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Lets add few more steps: miners increase hashrate, hashrate increase security (before dPOW) and also public interest as feeling the chain more secure = more valuable, and then even more people interested in Arrr...

[14-Oct-18 11:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The flip side of that is that the higher the market price is in relation to mining costs is the larger the marketing budget 😉

[14-Oct-18 11:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
what is the mindset of the current ZCL miner? "Maybe Rhett will abuse this chain again and it will go crazy and I hope to catch that price spike" ?

[14-Oct-18 11:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
is it anything more than that? Does anyone think ZCL is a valuable project on it's own, without Rhettscams?

[14-Oct-18 11:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what is the mindset of the current ZCL miner?` "mine ... dump... repeat"

[14-Oct-18 11:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
zombie chains attract zombie miners

[14-Oct-18 11:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
evidently some devs still work on ZCL directly, i guess so their miners still work

[14-Oct-18 11:37 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
possibly there is no mindset :trollface:  just people buying what they see most on forums, paid adds, articels, twitter and reddit

[14-Oct-18 11:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's fun to look at ZCL+BTCP codebases and see bugs from days of old still there, that have been fixed in other zec forks for months or longer

[14-Oct-18 11:37 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@dukeleto  werent you zombie mining you own chain couple days ago :trollface:  ? :pirate:

tbt, I don't think I've met a single ZCL fanboy 🤔

I just keep these gems to myself, it's worth more than any bounty they could pay

@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 I have 2 z9m's, one for Hush and one for ARRR

not much to heat the house though

[14-Oct-18 11:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
for long term mine+HODL, those are very attractive right now, in terms of how easy difficulty is

[14-Oct-18 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`one for Hush` Oh, so you're the one guy still mining it :trollface:

[14-Oct-18 11:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
yup, just me

[14-Oct-18 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[14-Oct-18 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I joke, but even at pseudo of 10 cents, my profit switcher hits on HUSH ~ 30% of the time

[14-Oct-18 11:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
I held onto BTC 6 years before ever selling a satoshi, it treated me well. I surely don't need to see a rise like that in Hush for it to be a good deal 😃 And I expect prices of all coins to be drastically different in, let's say, 2 more years when BTC halves

[14-Oct-18 11:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The next BTC halving should be interesting times

@CHMEX dexstats.info has 3 million pageviews per day?

[14-Oct-18 11:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
lolwut

[14-Oct-18 11:55 AM] CHMEX#0686
currently about 1'000
but there are all this crypto websites that grab data CMC blockfolio coinfairvallue blocktivity and some mining calculators.
Blockfolio hits it with 1.5m requests per day

[14-Oct-18 11:55 AM] CHMEX#0686
the other 1.5m come from the rest

[14-Oct-18 11:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
calls include API, I assume?

[14-Oct-18 11:55 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes

[14-Oct-18 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
seems a bit excessive

[14-Oct-18 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
how much CPU does it use up?

[14-Oct-18 11:58 AM] CHMEX#0686
its a hosted service with replicated data etc I could not pay for it if I had to setup myself I guess. So i have no idea on the CPU
yes blockfolio is very exesive they call each unique trading pair a few times a day

[14-Oct-18 11:58 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes said they will change that at some point... I guess it will need another 'bull' market. some companies only invest than

[14-Oct-18 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`each unique trading pair a few times a day`
Holy exponential rise, Batman!

[14-Oct-18 12:01 PM] CHMEX#0686
approx 385 coins * 384 coins * 10 times a day that gives about 1.5m calls

[14-Oct-18 12:13 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
some cashing could decrease cpu usage if someone requests that much... not many pairs updated in relaity on daily basis?

[14-Oct-18 12:13 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
cms's like drupal or WPusually have some build int cashing, not sure id dexstats is built on cms?

[14-Oct-18 12:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have used Redis in front of read-only API requests for insane performance

[14-Oct-18 12:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
redis can auto-expire data at the interval you choose as well, or "keep it alive" for X seconds after it's been read, things like that

[14-Oct-18 12:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
Redis can even talk directly to a postgres DB and render read-only API requests directly, no dynamic language interpreter is run

[14-Oct-18 12:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
30ms API responses

[14-Oct-18 12:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
I helped run a short-url company, we did a lot of in-line API stuff to generate HTTP redirects, ultimate performance was necessary

[14-Oct-18 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
I would like to do a reverse auction. 10000 KMD for the best PIRATE offer, time limit 3 hours

[14-Oct-18 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so sellers, do your best to undercut each other

[14-Oct-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
the lowest price gets the 10000 KMD

[14-Oct-18 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in OTC?

[14-Oct-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[14-Oct-18 12:31 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
5k PIRATE for the 10k KMD 😄

[14-Oct-18 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The best part of participating in this reverse auction, for me, is that there's no loss-point (theoretical or economical)

[14-Oct-18 01:27 PM] CHMEX#0686
As you will outbid anyways yassins 0.02 might come true

If I can push a large volume from an unknown to a large holder, in a one-off OTC trade, there's not much downside from any vantage point
If I "win" I still pull profit, so "no harm, no foul"

[14-Oct-18 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my "worst" outcome is that I make $12 and have a free 5 hr rental

[14-Oct-18 01:32 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes big x amount off the market and 'locked' for a while is a good thing.

When I came on board our hashrate was about 10-15 ms.   Now we hover around 100 within 2 weeks.   James has provided some wonderful avenues for increasing this numbers and the crew has been great to help me produce material along the way.

We’ve organized a group of 9 international translators @discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh - and they are working through our list of articles to get as many languages up as possible as well as hitting Regional message boards and chat rooms.   

The Agama wallet traffic from pirate.black is a nice stat to know.   We can pretty much guarantee that these people are downloading for pirate.
