Monero maybe

[26-Sep-18 08:57 PM] ideamachines#8156
true

[26-Sep-18 08:57 PM] ideamachines#8156
so does this mean PIRATE will take more of the privacy use case vs Komodo?

[26-Sep-18 08:57 PM] ideamachines#8156
is that by design?

[26-Sep-18 08:57 PM] ideamachines#8156
what's the point of using privacy feature on KMD if PIRATE is 100% private all the time

[26-Sep-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
if you know what you are doing you can use zaddr in KMD just fine

[26-Sep-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is noob friendly in that it is really hard to mess up your privacy with an all zaddr chain

[26-Sep-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
you literally have to publicly announce your txid and details for anybody to have any idea what is happening

[26-Sep-18 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is very cool, it enhances the ecosystem and KMD benefits from that

[26-Sep-18 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
more specifically with tortuga.exchange supporting zdeposit/zwithdraw for KMD<->PIRATE trading, usage of zaddr in KMD will increase. since KMD is the only way to get PIRATE, demand for KMD increases. with more ztransactions, JUMBLR becomes more private.

[26-Sep-18 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
please think about the overall ecosystem

[26-Sep-18 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE performs a very important function

how long does PIRATE take to sync on Agama Native?

[26-Sep-18 09:22 PM] jcooper#1100
20-25 min

[26-Sep-18 09:23 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
ok, thanks

[26-Sep-18 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810

Where does the PIRATE chain get downloaded to? (win 10)? And how do I see the current block height that has been downloaded?

[26-Sep-18 09:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`C:\Users\YourUserNameHere\AppData\Roaming\Komodo\PIRATE`

[26-Sep-18 09:42 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
Hmm, that's empty for me - and has been for the past hr

[26-Sep-18 09:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
using komodod, agama, or ocean?

[26-Sep-18 09:43 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
Agama

[26-Sep-18 09:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
which version?

[26-Sep-18 09:43 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
Does it make a difference that I use KMD in Lite mode?

[26-Sep-18 09:43 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
0.2.42c-beta

[26-Sep-18 09:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
KMD in any mode will not give you the PIRATE chain, you need to select PIRATE

[26-Sep-18 09:44 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
I have done that

[26-Sep-18 09:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ok, then go into your folder options and make sure you can see hidden folders

[26-Sep-18 09:44 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
It says synchronization is in progress

[26-Sep-18 09:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
bbl 🍽

[26-Sep-18 09:45 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
Yep, still empty

[26-Sep-18 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
lets use #deleted-channel for onboarding issues like syncing the chain.

[26-Sep-18 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
#deleted-channel for the central exchange

[26-Sep-18 09:46 PM] jl777c#5810
#pirate for OTC trading and things other than onboarding or the central exchange

[26-Sep-18 10:38 PM] wookie#7663
@jl777c @SHossain as Pirate is it's own independent chain (from KMD), and Pirate is a combination of both Monero and ZCash, and it is currently the most secure privacy coin around. Other than Monero's and ZCash's cult followings, is it possible then that Pirate could match either of their marketcaps? What am I missing here?

[26-Sep-18 11:18 PM] Flexatron#8809

Why... once they haev tortuga working, makeing a PirateAlphaBay will be trivial I think. IMO thats where to ral money will be made.

[27-Sep-18 01:38 AM] rrrj288#7865
Hey guys. Is pirate tradeable?  Other than mining, is there any other way I can buy pirate  ?

[27-Sep-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181

So.    Serious question....   
Who here would donate a z9 mining pirate for 24 hours for a rig giveaway exposure contest?

[27-Sep-18 02:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I am putting all 10 of my rigs up.  9 minis and a big.   
24 hours.  5 winners.

[27-Sep-18 02:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Any additional z9s will be distributed evenly amongst the winners or perhaps I will add more to the winners list.

[27-Sep-18 02:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The last time I did this for KMD it garnered 77k interactions.

[27-Sep-18 02:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
And that was in June for 8k sols.

[27-Sep-18 02:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[27-Sep-18 02:16 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Question... is anyone working on the api for our otc price estimates?   I have crypto-coinz taking about adding ARRR/M8E/PIR8/RUM/BUTY to their calculator.
