I used to live in that area and knew they were building a huge mining facility

(he asked for help in the EMC2 discord before)

[13-Oct-18 11:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Can’t say one way or the other

[13-Oct-18 11:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not gonna lie I’m really looking forward to the @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 paper he’s typing

[13-Oct-18 11:50 PM] Zach#9973
I think he passed out on his keyboard so it’s just gonna be “ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd”

*In actuality he is afk and something fell on his keyboard*

[14-Oct-18 12:07 AM] Zach#9973
*Or he has a cat that likes to sit on keyboards*

[14-Oct-18 12:07 AM] 0x03#8822
it requires 'continuous keypresses' or the 'is typing' display will timeout

[14-Oct-18 12:08 AM] 0x03#8822
so he's probably just :trollface: us with 1 keypress/30s 😄

[14-Oct-18 12:08 AM] Zach#9973
Then I applaud his determination to be the best pirate troll there will ever be

[14-Oct-18 12:15 AM] 0x03#8822
his initial announcement on twitch said ~5hr

[14-Oct-18 12:15 AM] 0x03#8822
he didnt even manage 4

[14-Oct-18 12:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
he ran out of his $9 already?

[14-Oct-18 12:15 AM] 0x03#8822
😄

[14-Oct-18 12:16 AM] 0x03#8822
before he accidentially revealed one of his IP addresses, got banned off 2 streaming sites and so on

[14-Oct-18 12:16 AM] 0x03#8822
and i think the last sentence here says it all

snomp on Ubuntu, I wasn't expecting anything impressive anyway :trollface:

[14-Oct-18 12:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and I was about to fork it` aka "since you can't see it I can say any lie I want"

[14-Oct-18 12:19 AM] 0x03#8822
considering he didnt know about EMC2 having dpow until shortly before the attack (which made him change his plans a first time) i dont think he even knows what he is doing

[14-Oct-18 12:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can't say much, I didn't know either until yesterday

[14-Oct-18 12:20 AM] 0x03#8822
then he was all over the emc2-discord for the better part of 2 nights trying to get an EMC2-compatible scrypt-nomp to fly

[14-Oct-18 12:20 AM] 0x03#8822
i witnessed it 'first hand' whereever i got a possibility to do so

[14-Oct-18 12:21 AM] Concorde#4322
hey guys

[14-Oct-18 12:22 AM] 0x03#8822
all in all i get a feeling he may have overestimated this 'project' by a lot

[14-Oct-18 12:23 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
i see new pool http://theminingpool.online/

[14-Oct-18 12:25 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
but the website doesn't open ...

[14-Oct-18 12:27 AM] 0x03#8822
well it redirects to a weird subdomain

[14-Oct-18 12:27 AM] 0x03#8822
is that dynamic DNS?

[14-Oct-18 12:28 AM] 0x03#8822

How to trade pirate🤔

[14-Oct-18 04:41 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
At the moment you can only trade OTC. Have a look in #deleted-channel for buy/sell orders

[14-Oct-18 04:45 AM] Mmt#2590
Are there any other otc trading platforms?

[14-Oct-18 04:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Not that have pirate and I know of. #deleted-channel is currently in production. It will be a ztx -> ztx CEX. The aim is to have it running by Q1. There is a couple of projects in the pipeline that I am aware of for it.

[14-Oct-18 04:51 AM] Mmt#2590
@NutellaLickathank you

[14-Oct-18 04:52 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
No worries

[14-Oct-18 06:20 AM] Don King#8901
What is the best way to merge lots of mining utxo into one large utxo? I just tried sending to another address and got an error saying tx was over the size limit. Is there a specific command to merge utxo, or just send in batches is only option?

[14-Oct-18 06:25 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
There sure is. Depending on how many UTXO's you have, you may have to run this a lot of times (I had to run it shitloads and it took hours to merge all of them)
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_mergetoaddress '["*"]' "yourzaddrhere"`

[14-Oct-18 06:26 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
`remainingnotes: x` should tell you how many you've got, and I believe mergetoaddress does 10 at a time (at least in my case)

[14-Oct-18 06:27 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I ran that command like 20times in a row and they just queued up one after another. I monitored the progress with `z_getoperationstatus`

[14-Oct-18 06:31 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Does that answer your question @Don King

[14-Oct-18 06:38 AM] Don King#8901
@NutellaLicka , cool man, that looks like what i need, thanks!

[14-Oct-18 06:39 AM] Don King#8901
I will try using cli in the  agama wallet

[14-Oct-18 07:40 AM] tigersfang#3444
how to i exchange pirate to fiat?

[14-Oct-18 07:56 AM] Acura#2748
@tigersfang find someone that pay´s you fiat for pirate

[14-Oct-18 07:58 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@tigersfang  sell Pirate for KMD, transfer KMD to exchange -> sell for BTC -> sell BTC for USD or EUR

[14-Oct-18 07:58 AM] tigersfang#3444

It is, indeed, morning

how can that be? on all parts of the world, at the same time?

How can we list $arrr on coinmarketcap

[14-Oct-18 09:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Convince a CEX to add z addy deposits and withdraws

[14-Oct-18 09:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And then teach their CFO/CTO how z addy txes work

[14-Oct-18 09:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Lets hope the CTO knows what a z tx is

[14-Oct-18 09:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
CFO probably the biggest hurdle

[14-Oct-18 09:54 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Or build our own 😃

[14-Oct-18 09:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or legal dept

[14-Oct-18 09:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Cryptoon knowing what it is and knowing how to properly work them aren't always mutually inclusive

[14-Oct-18 09:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm valid point

[14-Oct-18 09:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I want to believe that someone like CZ would see the benefits of having a Z chain on their platform

[14-Oct-18 10:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Not sure how AML works in Malta though

[14-Oct-18 10:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe $ARRR can be a solution for their binance ‘dex’

[14-Oct-18 10:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from the CEX perspective, z doesn't change that because they still track in and out though the CEX's in-house accounts

[14-Oct-18 10:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm also true

[14-Oct-18 10:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Dear miners, sellers, and buyers:

In order to create a more cohesive community, that is geared towards promoting a better PIRATE to the rest of the world, I pose the following questions/thoughts:

What do you feel is, or should be, the price determining factor(s) of ARRR?
Hashrate alone? Is 32 cents at 124k diff and 11-15 cents at 40k diff a valid notion?
Does/should KMD/USD have an impact on ARRR/KMD price? Do we, as a community just peg price to KMD no matter what KMD value is?

These are just the base questions I have and hope that the can be answered and prove to springboard into a larger conversation about the true value of PIRATE as well as the perceived monetary value.

Thanks,
CG

[14-Oct-18 10:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or peg to x% of monero/zec mcap for the time being?

[14-Oct-18 10:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[14-Oct-18 10:28 AM] mozzx#6466
is possible to ask node list ?

[14-Oct-18 10:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@mozzx you need to have the latest komodod, getting stuck there means that you have outdated ruleset

[14-Oct-18 10:29 AM] mozzx#6466
hmm

[14-Oct-18 10:30 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  price is not determined by voting or thinking (unless market is easy to manipulate). Free market prices regulate themselves. Want higher price - attract enough users toward which you can unload....
