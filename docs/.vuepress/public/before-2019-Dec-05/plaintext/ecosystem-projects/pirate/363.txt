what would be the advantage of piratechain if zcash implemented 100% sksnarks and dpow (or another 51% attack protection)?

[05-Dec-18 03:06 PM] Acura#2748
Any arguments ? 😅

and dpow

[05-Dec-18 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
if the zcash roadmap is to become like PIRATE without dpow over the next years, that seems very good for PIRATE

[05-Dec-18 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
already PIRATE will be the first sapling only chain

[05-Dec-18 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure zcash will allow sprout to exist since they dont have any zaddr exchanges bogging down with sprout processing

i want to set a 3 gpu rig to mine pirate, what port should i connect to?  the difficulty in port 2096 seems a little too high for 3 gtx 1060. Please help

GPU Port (diff 0.1): stratum+tcp://stratum.piratepool.io:2095
Multiple GPU Port (diff 10): stratum+tcp://stratum.piratepool.io:2096

[07-Dec-18 11:22 PM] Algorismus#9195
Thanks @webworker01 
i also want to ask, how can i set the intensity to 50 on DSTM miner?

[07-Dec-18 11:22 PM] Algorismus#9195
i'm assuming the intensity value needs conversion when using dstm

[07-Dec-18 11:35 PM] Algorismus#9195
there's an example for ewbf and bminer only on the getting started page. on the help menu of dstm i get the following values as example 0.9 and 0.85 seem waay to far from 50
#intensity=0:0.9,1:0.85       # Reduce the load which is put on the gpu valid
                              # range ]1.0-0.0[. Format: comma separated list
                              # of dev_id:intensity values e.g '0:0.893,2:0.8'

[07-Dec-18 11:36 PM] Algorismus#9195
sorry if i was unclear previously 😃

[07-Dec-18 11:36 PM] Algorismus#9195
@webworker01

[07-Dec-18 11:38 PM] Algorismus#9195
makes sens. so 50% should be .5

[07-Dec-18 11:38 PM] Algorismus#9195
right?

[07-Dec-18 11:38 PM] Algorismus#9195
thank you

[07-Dec-18 11:39 PM] Algorismus#9195
yes, dstm do not apply changes to all gpus by one command

[07-Dec-18 11:39 PM] Algorismus#9195
i have to set the intensity for each gpu

[07-Dec-18 11:42 PM] Algorismus#9195
yes, i agree. the dev team of dstm was doing an amazing job. i don't know why they abandoned the project

[07-Dec-18 11:43 PM] Algorismus#9195
there was no releases after v 6.0.2

I'm trying to sync the RKT chain, any idea why it'd be stuck at block 331 (I understand this was the block sapling was implemented)

[09-Dec-18 10:14 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I have updated to the 0.3.0 komodo daemon

[09-Dec-18 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
RKT needs a different repo

[09-Dec-18 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
using the normal release will make it stuck at 331, sapling activation

[09-Dec-18 10:44 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
thanks 👌 might create another test chain on the komodo repo to test sapling pools

[09-Dec-18 10:46 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
If I create an `-ac-private=1 `chain with the updated komodo daemon, will it be automatically start with sapling integration from block 1

[09-Dec-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
no

[09-Dec-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
sapling activation is around 1am Dec 15th UTC

[09-Dec-18 10:49 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
copy, I see why i'd need the other repo now 😛

[09-Dec-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
the only difference is the sapling activation timestamp in ~/komodo/src/komodo_defs.h

[09-Dec-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
you can just change it to any timestamp to change when sapling activates

[09-Dec-18 10:59 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So I'd have to ensure both nodes that start the chain had the same timestamp (say for in an hours time). Then I'd be able to create a chain with all sapling addresses

[09-Dec-18 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[09-Dec-18 05:23 PM] SHossain#0007
@dukeleto @jeezy please update your PIRATE pool to latest komodo daemon and start using sapling ready pool software. please ping me once your pool is sapling ready.

[10-Dec-18 12:12 AM] NutellaLicka#4241

[10-Dec-18 12:50 AM] NutellaLicka#4241

[10-Dec-18 01:00 AM] SHossain#0007
sapling already activated on this chain

[10-Dec-18 01:00 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Thought so. Hmm

[10-Dec-18 01:50 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I had to rm the RKT file in .komodo and restart the chain. Seemed to fix it

[10-Dec-18 02:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain Given that the "ACTIVATION" date is correct and both of the "DEADLINE" dates have past, it shouldn't matter as long as the "DEADLINE" is *in the past*
if you set "DEADLINE" to yesterday it would still yield the same results as the rest of the network has already accepted it as having past and now a requirement
The only issue that could arise is if you set it in the future and tried to do sprout - in which case your node would believe it valid and the rest of the network would refuse it

[10-Dec-18 04:38 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Is anyone sync to the RKT here?
