CoC = "cover our asses so that we don't get sued by millennials who are so coddled that they think *words* are *violence*" 🤦🏼

somehow meritocracy is bad for code

[03-Oct-18 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
since we dont want the best solution to the coding problems, that is unfair

[03-Oct-18 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
as if there has ever been any race/gender based discrimination in open source. it is all about the code and if it works or not.

[03-Oct-18 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
I certainly dont care what gender a person is, especially after my sex change operation

@SHossain what site has 41d?

[03-Oct-18 02:21 PM] SHossain#0007
we didn't update the site with 42c as it was a testing version for PIRATE

[03-Oct-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
but pirate.black links to the right version?

@SHossain I think only the top link was changed. There is one lower down in Getting Started that links to the komodoplatform.com/wallets too

haha ... you mat be right in point of fact ... being of Portuguese decent, I did an extensive historical geneology only to find out that my family were very much original traders ... can't help but wonder if that loosely translates as Pirates 😃

can somebody give me a very rough estimate of how much PIRATE a z9 mini can mine per day, in current network conditions? I mined some PIRATE with a CPU in the beginning, things sure have changed

[03-Oct-18 04:39 PM] Flexatron#8809
A handful I think

[03-Oct-18 04:39 PM] Flexatron#8809

[03-Oct-18 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they changed enough that the influx of hash last night made my over-night cost for mining PIRATE 0.1428571428571429 per 😭

[03-Oct-18 04:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@dukeleto at 150k sols yesterday was about 1100 pirate per day on pirate.komodo.xyz

[03-Oct-18 04:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
1M sols on piratepool.io netted about 9,000 yesterday.

[03-Oct-18 04:48 PM] CHMEX#0686
so a mini would be like 90?

[03-Oct-18 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810

[03-Oct-18 04:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Sounds about right.  I have been posting a lot on twitter and responding directly to miners about the project.  Plus the mining rig giveaway

[03-Oct-18 04:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And I have been hinting at givin away a z9 mini starting next week.
