ignoring overheads

[30-Sep-18 07:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That's what I'm saying

[30-Sep-18 07:50 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
It all depends on what you are referring to really. The more pools there are, the more likely a single pool failing won't cause huge fluctuations in the total net hash and block rate. The  more pools that run different software, teh less likely the network is affected by a single common bug. There is greater security  with fewer pools as large amounts of hash could not be used by a "bad actor". As jl777c said, no single mining source over 50%, but the best security would be if getting any large majority of hash power to one instance was increasingly difficult.  Having more solo miners increses the chance that altered software is not being mined to.  As of today, the owner of pirate.komodostats.com could direct the majority of  PIRATES hash rate however they plese

[30-Sep-18 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
nicehash is the biggest danger to coins

[30-Sep-18 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
not pools or no pools

[30-Sep-18 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
need 3 pools, maybe up to 10 after that it is diminishing returns

[30-Sep-18 07:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the more likely a single pool failing won't cause huge fluctuations in the total net hash`
On that, we agree; 0x03's issues are evidence of that

[30-Sep-18 07:53 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
I always trust people that tell me to, but you seem awfully trustworthy

[30-Sep-18 07:53 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
lol, j/k btw...being sarcastic

[30-Sep-18 07:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Having more solo miners increses the chance that altered software is not being mined to.`
Actually, that's a fallacy and about backwards 😉

[30-Sep-18 07:54 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
I should reword that...you are correct

[30-Sep-18 07:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for about 10 reasons, my node is altered all over the place

[30-Sep-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
@webworker01 yes but in that case there are say 1000 of such small pools and some will be finding blocks

`within a reasonable time` is a subjective term

[30-Sep-18 07:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
2 days is my personal limit

[30-Sep-18 07:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, your OCD doesn't count 😛

[30-Sep-18 07:57 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
If you took network connections and software efficiency out of the picture, if it takes you on average 1 day to find a block solo, it should take 1 day of earning on a pool to equal a block,  If you are on a pool that finds 10 blocks in a day, you are probably getting 1/10 of each block. If you are on a pool that finds 100 blocks in a day you are probably getting 1/100 of  each block. It feels like less, but it is the same in the end

[30-Sep-18 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`It feels like less, but it is the same in the end`
You have no clue how many times I've said that same thing in #talk-mining 😛

The larger teh pool is the less variance you have, that is a benefit in one since

[30-Sep-18 08:03 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
It is the law of big numbers

[30-Sep-18 08:03 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
In 100 years it will be all the same, in the next cuple hours, it could vary

[30-Sep-18 08:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1% hash means that, statistically, you will most likely find 1000 blocks out of 100000

[30-Sep-18 08:04 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
on AVERAGE you will find the  same over the next 100 years. In the next hour it is difficult to say

[30-Sep-18 08:07 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
webworker, you are right that the % does not change as time goes. When you flip a quarter the % stays the same. It is always 50% because the quarter has no idea what happened last and is not affected by it. We deal with probabilities here in mining.  When you flip a quarter once it is a 1:2 that you will get heads. It is a 1:1000000 chance you will flip heads 20 times

[30-Sep-18 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
you assume that conscious thought cant affect the brownian motion of the air molecules to change the probabilities of heads vs tails

{Reactions}
🤦🏼 trollface 

[30-Sep-18 08:09 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
if your example is 1% of the net solves, and you got 0 of the last 100 blocks, you still only have 1% likelihood at the 101st, only it is more probable over time that you will get 1%.. The more time there is, the more accurate the numbers will be

[30-Sep-18 08:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Anywho, the short version is that no one is "hurt" if they get 1 coin a day or they get 7 coins every Monday

[30-Sep-18 08:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
7=7

[30-Sep-18 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
unless the 1 coin can stake or earn somehow

_missed the PoS option of PIRATE_

[30-Sep-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
selling high and buying low is a form of income generation, in some ways similar to income

[30-Sep-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
which you cant do until Monday

[30-Sep-18 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
granted the harm is minimal

[30-Sep-18 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, but at a scale where number of public pools counts, that income isn't going to be statistically large

[30-Sep-18 08:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_occasionally pops miners to a BTC pool that has `Estimated time between blocks: 10 days, 13 hours, 13 min, 16 sec`_

[30-Sep-18 08:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and makes like $16 a month 🚽

[30-Sep-18 08:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
vs 53 cents a day isn't going to arb but a cup of ☕ every 3 months

[30-Sep-18 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
instant coffee maybe

[30-Sep-18 08:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
coffee is only 70 cents at the diner

[30-Sep-18 08:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
:p

[30-Sep-18 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a small effect, just being precise and maybe this explains the intuitive feel people have to like the pools, which wont even return the 1% extra

[30-Sep-18 08:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
undoubtedly pools still exist for most coins because of the psychological effect of "regular payments"

[30-Sep-18 08:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or more specifically "as many pools"

how profitable is mining right now?

[30-Sep-18 09:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
same as it ever was

[30-Sep-18 09:22 PM] Llama#1330
well

[30-Sep-18 09:22 PM] Llama#1330
I sort of want to get into mining

[30-Sep-18 09:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my personal advice, if profitability is a factor then don't "sort of" do it, give it every last dollar you can afford

[30-Sep-18 09:27 PM] Llama#1330
the factors that are going into it are noise and price

[30-Sep-18 09:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then you're going to be small enough to be in the "hobby" realm and profitability is going to depend on every choice you make on what/when to mine

[30-Sep-18 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
far more so than at a larger scale

[30-Sep-18 09:34 PM] Llama#1330
yeah for sure

i think that pirate should have a mobile dedicated app because if you think about it's the nearest thing to cash there is in crypto, untraceable and private but only with a desktop you can send it, so i think its adoption would really go up a lot.

[01-Oct-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
we need sapling, zSPV and then such a mobile app is possible

[01-Oct-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
next year at the earliest

a centralized way to earn PIRATE rewards, yes.

centralized?

[01-Oct-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810

yes, that is just the initial. it will be enhanced so you can earn PIRATE by referring others to get PIRATE. the earlier you start the more PIRATE you get at the early prices and the bigger your referral team will be

people are rewarded PIRATE for getting others to get rewarded for getting others to get PIRATE

[01-Oct-18 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
measured in PIRATE, so the earlier you get involved the lower the cost (assuming PIRATE goes up in price)

[01-Oct-18 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing stops you from selling your PIRATE after getting the rewards, a good pirate is spending all his PIRATE

[01-Oct-18 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
we want PIRATE to be used
