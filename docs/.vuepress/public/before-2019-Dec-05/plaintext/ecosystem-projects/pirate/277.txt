much better BTC does today, while Pirates also got notarization / BTC hashrate protection/ it's an outstanding tech

How do you get nicehash connected to piratepool.io?

[06-Nov-18 06:06 PM] B.B.Symphony#1809
I keep getting error messages. Tried a bunch of combinations of urls and ports

[06-Nov-18 06:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Not sure.  Never had a problem.  Let me copy paste my connectrion detausl.

I really expected there to be more volume once pirate went live on DP. No one is really doing much of anything from what I can see.

[06-Nov-18 06:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Its pretty standard for a new coin and new listing.

[06-Nov-18 06:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
2 BTC volume per day average is also nothing to shake a stick at.

[06-Nov-18 06:41 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
I'm trying to sell on the BTC/ARRR pair and not having hardly any luck, spread is very wide.

[06-Nov-18 06:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Some altcoins cant hit 2 BTC volume in a month.

[06-Nov-18 06:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
BTC/ARRR isnt as common right now.

[06-Nov-18 06:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Once Crex opens up it will be more used.

[06-Nov-18 06:42 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
yea

[06-Nov-18 06:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Our BIGGEST volume push will begin as we craft outlets for ARRR.

[06-Nov-18 06:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I will personally use ARRR as much as possible.

[06-Nov-18 06:43 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
Do you have an ETA?

[06-Nov-18 06:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
nope.

[06-Nov-18 06:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Just started talking to web page devs the last couple days about it.

[06-Nov-18 06:43 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
I'm holding a bag for a year+, but for my day to day, I need to be able to sell and pay the bills.

[06-Nov-18 06:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Chand is going to start the plugin this week.

[06-Nov-18 06:44 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
thats cool, Im very excited for this project, it has so much potential.

[06-Nov-18 06:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If I HAD to throw a timeframe out... I would say 2-3 montsh for a solid working product and another 2-3 months for onboarding new vendors.

[06-Nov-18 06:45 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
yea thats what I was putting together in my head, 6-9 months

[06-Nov-18 06:48 PM] Number1Miners#9105
Hi. Is this the correct channel to ask something about the pool piratepool.io?

[06-Nov-18 06:52 PM] Maat#9515
@B.B.Symphony how it is?does it worth?

[06-Nov-18 07:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Number1Miners yes.  @webworker01 runs that pool.

[06-Nov-18 07:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
What can we help with?

[06-Nov-18 07:03 PM] Maat#9515
@FishyGuts ure expirience with easyhash...!?

[06-Nov-18 07:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
No just nicehash

[06-Nov-18 07:04 PM] Maat#9515
Sorry,with nicehash!?üôà

Where can I see in that pool the transaction history?

[06-Nov-18 07:20 PM] Number1Miners#9105
How can I confirm the pool payouts deposited to digitalprice.io?

[06-Nov-18 07:22 PM] Number1Miners#9105
Not every payout is showing in the exchange and I need the txid to send to the exchange to verify the deposits

[06-Nov-18 07:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
don't mine to the exchange wallet

[06-Nov-18 07:26 PM] jansako#3330
pirate does not have transaction history/explorer. That is why it is the most private coin out there....

[06-Nov-18 07:27 PM] Number1Miners#9105
Ok thanks for the info

[06-Nov-18 07:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Number1Miners You should not mine to the exchange.

[06-Nov-18 07:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It causes issues with UTXO and transaction sizes.

[06-Nov-18 07:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And tracking deposits can be trying as you are learning üòÉ

99% on piratepool lol

[06-Nov-18 09:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I‚Äôve sugggested a few ways to alleviate that but not getting any luck.

[06-Nov-18 09:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Min payouts could be raised even more.  Fees could be raised.   All seem to be rife with their own accompanying set of challenges.

[06-Nov-18 09:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But those seem to pale in comparison to one pool having the hash.

[06-Nov-18 09:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I know.

[06-Nov-18 09:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I‚Äôm not blaming you.

[06-Nov-18 09:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It‚Äôs vosks fault.  lol.

[06-Nov-18 09:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
12k views.

[06-Nov-18 09:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
What if something happens to web...

[06-Nov-18 09:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Or the pool goes down when he‚Äôs on vacay or something.

[06-Nov-18 09:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Miners need to realize this and make move.   I‚Äôm on Polly pool üòÉ

[06-Nov-18 09:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I bet.

[06-Nov-18 09:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
400 workers?

[06-Nov-18 09:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I know we talked before but what about going to a 2% fee temporarily?

[06-Nov-18 09:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The onboarding fund wouldn‚Äôt mind :trollface:

[06-Nov-18 09:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Lazy miners can pay the fee. üòú

[06-Nov-18 09:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Good perspective I hadn‚Äôt thought about.

[06-Nov-18 09:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I guess min payouts aren‚Äôt a concern at 200k hash üí™

[06-Nov-18 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe if there is non-zero balance below minimum for 24hrs, it can pay it out to clear it?

[06-Nov-18 09:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Or batch them into payouts without 54 people

[06-Nov-18 09:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Somehow.   As of you didn‚Äôt have enough to do already.

[06-Nov-18 09:22 PM] jl777c#5810
one easy way could be to track the last payment time and if it is more than 24hrs ago to not have a min payout for that address

[06-Nov-18 09:22 PM] jl777c#5810
or weekly

[06-Nov-18 09:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Payouts every 24 hours.

[06-Nov-18 09:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Regardless of balance.

[06-Nov-18 09:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
400 miners = 8 payment blasts.

[06-Nov-18 09:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Not sure how to track that but anotehr idea üòÉ

[06-Nov-18 09:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I still think raising the fee is a good idea.

[06-Nov-18 09:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
A you work hard.

[06-Nov-18 09:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
B the onboarding can use more funds

[06-Nov-18 09:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
C it will encourage active miners to move.

[06-Nov-18 09:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I weatched it work well for Veo

[06-Nov-18 09:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
They always had hash collection issues and the large pool would go to 2.5% when it got bad.

[06-Nov-18 09:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But he always kept it around 50-60%

[06-Nov-18 09:26 PM] mrlynch#5735

[06-Nov-18 09:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
