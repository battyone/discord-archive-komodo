You can save it to a txt file but to me that‚Äôs a dangerous game too.

thank you for sharing all those info..now I know what I should do for the next time I wanna reinstall my windows

[28-Nov-18 02:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It is for ANY wallet that you have on your machine.   If you have others... save those .dat files safely as well.   I use two USBs in case one gets corrupted or accidentally overwritten.

have you guys used any other wallets such as coinomi or even myetherwallet?

This happened to me about a year ago with metamask.  I lost about $1,000 worth of tokens.... good thing they‚Äôre only worth $90 today!   Hurts much less.... üòí

all of these wallets tell us what we need to do so even if we are new people who are learning we don't have much problems

Is a first time setup guide or option / pop ups available for Agama?

[28-Nov-18 02:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
To help new users?

[28-Nov-18 02:59 PM] hfaz63#1930
in my opinion those who create these wallets should make sure that new people can use them safely and easily by giving enough info about what steps need to be taken by new users

[28-Nov-18 02:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It‚Äôs a fine line @hfaz63

[28-Nov-18 03:00 PM] hfaz63#1930
coins in agama have different systems.. for example I created a comodo wallet in agama and this time i was given a recovery seed

[28-Nov-18 03:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Hold hands too much, provide too much assistance and now you‚Äôre in a different realm of compliance as a crypto creator.

[28-Nov-18 03:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Too much help and assistance and your role becomes custodial... rife with regulation compliance and fines. üñï

[28-Nov-18 03:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
If i remember correctly when i first setup agama (think it was 41) there was a notice to backup the private key

[28-Nov-18 03:01 PM] hfaz63#1930
or maybe these tips about Pirate and agama need to be on some webpage...

[28-Nov-18 03:01 PM] mrlynch#5735

@hfaz63 many early bitcoin miners wish there was a way to recover a wallet.dat file after you format the drive it was on without backing up your data...
what you're asking is akin to saying
"Please help me get my cash back from the leather wallet I threw in the waste shredder"

[28-Nov-18 04:08 PM] Cassius#9158
So, downloaded Agama, enabled Pirate and waiting for sync...

[28-Nov-18 04:08 PM] Cassius#9158
Agama looks essentially like Nxt login approach, i.e. you have to enter your seed phrase?

[28-Nov-18 04:11 PM] Cassius#9158
Right. So if I create lite mode wallet with seed, then enable Pirate... it will create a wallet.dat for me?

[28-Nov-18 04:13 PM] Cassius#9158

[28-Nov-18 04:13 PM] Cassius#9158
It's running native mode for Pirate. Hopefully the blockchain isn't too large

All miners out there, just a reminder: make sure you are mining to your own Agama or CLI wallet. Mining to the Digital Price exchange causes massive issues and should not be done at all. This may be the reason for all of the wallet maintenance.

I'm trying to send pirate from the adama Wallet and it's just shows processing. What's the expected behaviour

[28-Nov-18 06:20 PM] memo#0706
Does it send right away or do I have to leave the wallet open

[28-Nov-18 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
if cPU is being used, it is still calculating the tx. it takes 30 seconds per zaddr input

[28-Nov-18 06:22 PM] memo#0706
Been 10 minutes... I close the wallet and reopen it

[28-Nov-18 06:22 PM] memo#0706
Coins still there

[28-Nov-18 06:23 PM] memo#0706
Should I send smaller amounts

[28-Nov-18 06:23 PM] memo#0706
I'm trying to send thousands

[28-Nov-18 06:25 PM] SHossain#0007
This is normal. Expect this to get better after the sapling upgrade.

[28-Nov-18 06:25 PM] SHossain#0007
sending smaller amount helps

[28-Nov-18 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
each zaddr utxo takes about 30 seconds. depending on how big your utxo are, thousands could take a long time

[28-Nov-18 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
sapling will solve this

[28-Nov-18 06:28 PM] memo#0706
Alright thanks

Folks, I need some help.  
@Strob is doing a video on Privacy and why we need it.  
He and I could use help putting a script together.   Here are some notes from my interviews and the statements made about privacy.  Please feel free to add more or take away unneeded wording.  
Thank you everyone!

[28-Nov-18 08:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Its an animated video about privacy.

[28-Nov-18 08:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And yes @Cassius we would love input.   The more input the merrier, then we can edit the ideas down to a core message.
