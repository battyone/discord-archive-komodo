@wolfgang you can get an address under the receive button without waiting for the whole chain to download. It'll that helps

[12-Nov-18 12:46 PM] Mr. HashEm#3357
Wow What is happening in DP ? 0.17 buy and latest buy order 0.13 ? 🤔

[12-Nov-18 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dumpers all dumped out and buyers haven't moved up yet

[12-Nov-18 12:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yea someone bought the book up to 0.17 fallen a bit now

[12-Nov-18 12:56 PM] Lord Shaper Andy#5856
Asics for equihash?

[12-Nov-18 12:57 PM] Lord Shaper Andy#5856
Or is it only gpu ATM?

[12-Nov-18 12:58 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
U can use asic equi

[12-Nov-18 12:58 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Not a problem for arrr it has dpow. Asics help

[12-Nov-18 01:05 PM] Lord Shaper Andy#5856
If it work mining with one you?

[12-Nov-18 01:05 PM] Lord Shaper Andy#5856
GPU*

[12-Nov-18 01:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
you can, but you probably shouldnt as the difficulty is already quite high

[12-Nov-18 01:06 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Personally i mine with 2 gpus. And they are not doing really well considering everyones using asics lol

[12-Nov-18 01:08 PM] Lord Shaper Andy#5856
Yeah I'm getting one coin a day with rx570

[12-Nov-18 01:09 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Mine something else and buy ARRR , thats what ive been doing with my amds

[12-Nov-18 01:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
2-4 ARRR a day maybe instead of 1

[12-Nov-18 01:11 PM] Lord Shaper Andy#5856
What you like to mine? Cryptonote coins?

[12-Nov-18 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Personally i mine with 2 gpus.`
heh I have 3 just for my day-use PC; wouldn't know how to act if I only had 2 GPUs

[12-Nov-18 01:16 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Lol 1 card per screen. Man i manage with just 1 for my gaming rig lol and 2 monitors

[12-Nov-18 01:16 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Miner rig is well outdated tbh 2 x r9280xs basically paper weights now

[12-Nov-18 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`1 card per screen.` yes, that's why I have 3 😛

[12-Nov-18 01:18 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I need to update badly. But its a never ending cycle.

[12-Nov-18 01:18 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@Lord Shaper Andy  Yeah, although I haven't had much time to play lately (so its auto switching)  I'd be more concerned and more into it if I had more cards.

[12-Nov-18 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not really "never ending", you have to abuse a new card pretty hard for it to not outlive the rest of the system

[12-Nov-18 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my 1080tis in here are from old system

[12-Nov-18 01:19 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
More along the lines of "your never done buying pc parts" lol

[12-Nov-18 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, that's true

[12-Nov-18 01:19 PM] jansako#3330
_is wondering why 3GPU's when he can work with 3d architectural models and a bunch of other stuff on 2 screens with 1 GPU_

[12-Nov-18 01:20 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Cos hes the genie jansako lol

[12-Nov-18 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`2 and new` is how I look at it, every 2 years it all gets an upgrade

[12-Nov-18 01:21 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Id like a 1080ti for a fair price when ur done genie let me know ;)

[12-Nov-18 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jansako the short answer is because I can, the longer answer involves having a truckload of GPUs anyway 😛

[12-Nov-18 01:21 PM] jansako#3330
that works!

[12-Nov-18 01:21 PM] jansako#3330
it is more wanting than needing...

[12-Nov-18 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CryptoNinjaa I'm done with GPUs when they earn less than 1 cent per month 😛

[12-Nov-18 01:22 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Lol

[12-Nov-18 01:22 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I wont hold my breathe then 😂

[12-Nov-18 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it is more wanting than needing...`
yes, most times I could do all I do on just 1 1080ti (even splitting 3 monitors)

[12-Nov-18 01:34 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Is $850 USD a good price for a Z9 mini 1st batch ?

[12-Nov-18 01:34 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Am i reaching if i try to talk them into $700 ?

[12-Nov-18 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$1994 for a new Z9, so I wouldn't pay more than $450 for a used mini ($500 if it's a proven 16k model)

[12-Nov-18 01:40 PM] P3L3#1096
thats the price i paid a couple of weeks ago.. 2 for 1500$ with a psu unit
overpaid a bit but still its worth while

[12-Nov-18 01:40 PM] P3L3#1096
i get 16.5 avg on both

[12-Nov-18 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
why would you new B2-B3 prices for a B1 that someone used/abused for 8 months?

[12-Nov-18 01:42 PM] P3L3#1096
mine were working only 2 months.. guy that sold it to me had issues and couldn't run them

[12-Nov-18 01:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's like buying a 2 yr old car for the same price as a 2019 sitting on the lot

[12-Nov-18 01:43 PM] P3L3#1096
it saved me from taxes and so on

[12-Nov-18 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`guy that sold it to me had issues and couldn't run them`
I've got some S7 I "couldn't get working", want to buy them? 😈

[12-Nov-18 01:45 PM] P3L3#1096
hahahahaha.. not issues with the units..

[12-Nov-18 01:45 PM] P3L3#1096

[12-Nov-18 03:21 PM] Flexatron#8809
Damn

[12-Nov-18 03:21 PM] jeezy#3408

[12-Nov-18 03:22 PM] kaks#6612
Today is a bad day i found only 2 blocks in 4 hours with 3msol 😅

[12-Nov-18 03:22 PM] kaks#6612
But the difficulty is 290m

[12-Nov-18 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CryptoNinjaa 14k = Z9 *mini*, not "Z9" 😛

[12-Nov-18 03:32 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah i just seen a 50ksol for £2.5k 🙄

[12-Nov-18 04:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh so you're *the one*

[12-Nov-18 05:00 PM] KSanJuan#9608
Any experiences with “larger” balances taking longer to settle than smaller transactions? Or does it matter at all?

[12-Nov-18 05:03 PM] jansako#3330
It depends on the number of UTXO's in your balance. larger balances (if mined, i.e.) are more likely to consist of larger  number of UTXO's (individual transactions)

[12-Nov-18 05:03 PM] jansako#3330
more UTXO = need more computing to get it sent

[12-Nov-18 05:04 PM] KSanJuan#9608
I was moving funds off DP and into Agama and it seems that the transaction wasn’t assigned a TXID even though it says its completed.  Just concerned.

[12-Nov-18 05:04 PM] KSanJuan#9608
Now that it’s been nearly an hour.

[12-Nov-18 05:07 PM] jansako#3330
that is different. They are processing them in batches, and they do process a rather large amount of UTXO's in one batch.

[12-Nov-18 05:07 PM] jansako#3330
an hour is not too much yet

[12-Nov-18 05:09 PM] KSanJuan#9608
Apparently it’s not too much.  Small coin just move much more quickly while treasure chests land with a loud thump.

[12-Nov-18 05:27 PM] fintechj#4292
can someone help me with Pirate mining pool  payouts?/

[12-Nov-18 05:29 PM] ronyi#5719

punch your hashrate there to see how long it takes to get to 144 Pirate, then add at least an hour for payment processing

[12-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Exile13#4458
punch it in the gotahs

[12-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Exile13#4458

@webworker01 Hey I have a question about your pool....can you assist me?

[12-Nov-18 05:45 PM] Oszy#5734
shoot it maybe we can help

[12-Nov-18 05:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
Holly timbers. Been away for a few hours. Come back to that volume and price shooting up

`Time                    Price (KMD)     Amount (ARRR)

Not sure I would call that "shooting up", but OK....

[12-Nov-18 05:47 PM] Oszy#5734
it was a `spike` 😄

[12-Nov-18 05:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
0.11000000 is to "spike" as "driveway" is to "highway" 😕

[12-Nov-18 05:53 PM] Oszy#5734
I believe he meant the buy up to 0.17 earlier

[12-Nov-18 05:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
Yeah. Of course there's going to be some idiot to ruin it. Why sell for .11 when it's got to .17 is beyond me

[12-Nov-18 05:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
At least .1695 ... geez

[12-Nov-18 05:54 PM] mrlynch#5735

Does pirate need to be mined into a Transparent address or can it also be mined to a private one?

[12-Nov-18 06:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
If you want to run a pool in needs to go in a t addy first

[12-Nov-18 06:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
Or at least that's what i've heard 😁

[12-Nov-18 06:06 PM] AndrewK#3947
thanks. Do you know why that is?

[12-Nov-18 06:07 PM] jansako#3330
I think the coins just don't generate into a Z address directly. No idea why
