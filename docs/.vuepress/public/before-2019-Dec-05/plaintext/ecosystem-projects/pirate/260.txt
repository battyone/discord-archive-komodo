Damn... dumping is ocurring on btc/arrr as well

[03-Nov-18 07:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
At least the market is moving

[03-Nov-18 07:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Dumping is expected.

[03-Nov-18 07:52 PM] FishyGuts#5085
For at least a month.

[03-Nov-18 07:52 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Don‚Äôt get discouraged.

[03-Nov-18 07:52 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Miners want profits no matter how small.

[03-Nov-18 07:52 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Some people mine without looking at what we‚Äôre trying to create.

[03-Nov-18 07:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And I can understand dumping if you‚Äôre making or you have made 50% more for your mining efforts.

[03-Nov-18 07:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The last coin I mined for a few months and thought would 100x so I held, has basicallly netted me about 1$ a day.   Coulda been 8-10 if I had sold when I mined.

[03-Nov-18 07:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
Oh, i'm not discouraged :) i'm a miner too but i've put my sell trades in increments of $15. When they happen they happen. I know i'm not going to lose money :)

[03-Nov-18 07:57 PM] mrlynch#5735
I wonder what would happen if darkweb folks start adopting arrr

[03-Nov-18 07:57 PM] mrlynch#5735

We‚Äôre gonna figure out a way to even out this hashrate.

[03-Nov-18 08:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And have a place for pool ops to chat.

[03-Nov-18 08:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
Are there any rewards for block finders?

[03-Nov-18 08:38 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That's a good method to encourage spread.   Also considering asking the large pools to raise their fees until the hash spreads.

[03-Nov-18 08:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
@FishyGuts i'm looking into setting up a pool as well. Can i have your 2 cents on wether it's worth it or not?! Or actually... what to look out for?

[03-Nov-18 08:40 PM] Oszy#5734
Luckpool is doing that. Sadly pirate won't be on there until sapling enabled.

[03-Nov-18 08:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@webworker01 or @0x03 are your best resources.

[03-Nov-18 08:45 PM] dc55#0947
Guys can anybody help me? Ive sent used the onboarding page a few times and received some pirate in agama, but the full balance is not relfected but dexstat says sent

[03-Nov-18 08:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
@webworker01 thank you!

[03-Nov-18 08:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Ladies and gentlemen.
I have been approached by an excahnge with 300+ daily BTC volume to list ARRR.
The exchange is CREX24.   I have used them and they are seamless in my experience.  No verifs needed.   Not sure of their daily limits.

This would put Pirate on Coin Market Cap!

The challenge... a .8 BTC listing fee.
This is about 4,000 KMD.
I want to know how the community feels about raising funds towards this.
We can use some of the onboarding earnings but we would like these funds to go towards other things.   It's a tough choice for me to even ask you guys so lets have a discussion.

For me, I will gladly throw in 1000 KMD of the team funds and 30 of my own (1% of the remaining 3000 needed)

Thoughts?

http://minethepiratechain.black will donate the 1% pool fee to the listing fee until we achieve the total amount. This will give miners the opportunity to donate through hashing :)

@FishyGuts  I think we can easily get the 0.8 BTC if all pools had like a 2-3% fee that went towards the goal

[03-Nov-18 09:10 PM] zatJUM#9924
I'm ok too for 30 KMD, but would rather pay in ARRR

[03-Nov-18 09:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I‚Äôll get a wallet address set up for this.  I have also received a few DMs so it looks like we can possibly have this done fairly quick.

OK - Official donation address for listing fees and other Pirate related costs is :  RMNJmRxcZ8gVuMo8sd6cRnZohkWzcpk3ou

I will hold off on accepting ARRR for now so as not to hurt the low volume market when I have to exchange for BTC.  

Please feel free to track that wallet address.   The amount of KMD we need is approximately 4,000.  I am sending my parts now.

[03-Nov-18 09:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
One last thing to note....  If they cannot list us, we will be refunded the KMD.   Send me your TXID if you will want this refunded instead of applied to future pirate needs.
