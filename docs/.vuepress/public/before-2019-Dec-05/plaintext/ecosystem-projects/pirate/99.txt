There are many ways to violate privacy including hacks, force and subpoena

I need maximum retweet and like button overdrive on this.  
We could really use CZ's help with this.  He has the team and resources to integrate into their exchange, I am CERTAIN.

I’m kind of drifting putting pieces together for this, but are devs planning a privacy piratey exchange??

@Dr Debt #deleted-channel

[02-Oct-18 02:28 AM] jellysmash#6680
Are there plans to list pirate on an exchange any time soon?

[02-Oct-18 02:29 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
PIRATE is private Z-transactions only. There are no Central (or Decentralized) exchanges that accept z-transactions

[02-Oct-18 02:31 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
If you visit the #deleted-channel channel you will see there is an effort to create a KMD/PIRATE exchange that works with anonymous z-transaction deposits and withdraws

[02-Oct-18 02:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jellysmash Only if you pay the fees that a CEX charges and then teach them how to add z txes :trollface:

[02-Oct-18 03:02 AM] actionslacks#4072
Yes, give the cex exchanges money and then teach them how to take more money for free.

[02-Oct-18 03:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well my sarcasm comes more from the fact that people tend to expect devs to shell out $50+k to get a coin listed on a single exchange so that they can make $5

[02-Oct-18 03:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Even more annoying when they know the coin is part of an ecosystem that has its own DEX 😣

If you need some material we would be happy to help. 
PIRATE chain is completely private for users as all send transactions are required to be zaddr transactions.

be careful giving out txid. combined with access to your wallet, some of the tx details are extractable

[02-Oct-18 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
if you sent it, a lot of details could still be in your wallet via the opid, though doing a z_getoperationresult seems to make a lot of it go away, not sure if it is totally purged though.

[02-Oct-18 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
even as a recipient giving out the txid allows someone with access to the wallet to see the amount and the memo field

[02-Oct-18 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
however, who sent it is not visible. what zaddr received is not there either, though it would likely be possible to correlate that with the wallet

[02-Oct-18 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it is quite impressive how little data is available even with full access to the wallet

[02-Oct-18 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
after you do a z_getoperationresult, it seems there is no info about any of the opids

[02-Oct-18 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you have a bunch of ztx and you want to reduce the data exposed, do a z_getoperationresult. but keep in mind that after you do that, even with a blockchain rescan, all you would be able to extract are the txid/amount/memo

[02-Oct-18 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
@pbca26 would be a good GUI button to have to wipe the opid via z_getoperationresult, with the proper warnings
