[27-Sep-18 02:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c what do you expect what will be the state of PIRATE after 1st halving, when the circulating supply will be half the supply of total PIRATE ?

[27-Sep-18 02:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
less/more mining hash rate ?

[27-Sep-18 02:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
price action etc ?

[27-Sep-18 02:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
skeptic value ?

[27-Sep-18 02:30 PM] Flexatron#8809
10$

[27-Sep-18 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the hashrate would likely drop, but not by half

[27-Sep-18 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
making the mining cost per coin go up

[27-Sep-18 02:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but doesn't less hashrate means less valued token?

[27-Sep-18 02:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or am I thinking opposite ?

[27-Sep-18 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
half the coins 52% of the hashrate would make it more hashrate per coin

[27-Sep-18 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but it could be factors other than mining cost is setting the price

[27-Sep-18 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
in that case the hashrate would increase

[27-Sep-18 02:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
clear 👍

[27-Sep-18 02:34 PM] scubapanda#2485
At current mining cost and diff, it will cost about 4 million USD to mine until halving.

@webworker01 you can do it from `getblocktemplate` if you do the math

`Current Diff = Diff1 /Target`
and for equihash, diff1 = `0007ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`

[27-Sep-18 03:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the real irony is that is actually all backwards because we miners look for a result that is *higher* than *x* and the protocol looks for a precision that's *less* than *y*

[27-Sep-18 03:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Alright if you have calculated mining expenses of NH, then please share your numbers

[27-Sep-18 03:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'd like to mine if it's cheaper to mine than buying

[27-Sep-18 03:45 PM] Flexatron#8809
Diff is increasing over time as well

[27-Sep-18 03:46 PM] Flexatron#8809
Keep that in mind lmao

[27-Sep-18 03:46 PM] Flexatron#8809
Its quite expensive actually now

Sorry guys

[27-Sep-18 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@grewalsatinder Because NH's limiter is broken, there's no real way to calculate cost atm

currently, an order with a "limit" of 5.4 is running anywhere between 9 and 19.8

[27-Sep-18 03:48 PM] Alright#0419
All I can say is that even at 26msol, it's cheaper to NH

[27-Sep-18 03:48 PM] Alright#0419
and that's why it's at 26msol 😂

We understand your concernings. Because of new Equihash ASICs it's hard to get low hash rates and that's why we will raise the minimum speed limit in the following days.

Kind regards,

I'm not sure where 5.4Msol/s is considered &quot;low hash rates&quot;. But we're looking at a 4 hour period with sustained average of more than 2 times the order limit.`
