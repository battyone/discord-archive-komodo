Currently I have apps out at 3 exchanges... one of which has taken 1/2 payment and they say they can do this.   It would be about 2 weeks from today.

`We can pretty much guarantee that these people are downloading for pirate.`
That is just :shexy: in and of itself 😎

I can appreciate the excitement and motivation people have.    I am here to support and discuss any ideas you may have no matter how big or small.  
Keep in mind the chain isn’t even 2 months old yet.    You all have done a fantastic job to date.    Let’s keep up the positive mentality and keep bringing new people in. 😃

[14-Oct-18 01:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 an exchange will be fantastic.    As mentioned I only need one more to get on CMC and to be honest, we may have a connection to get on sooner.  💪

As you mentioned @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 the AML issue is internal.  Zaddr don’t affect their tracking of buy and sell books.

[14-Oct-18 01:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We’ve got a good community and a strong foundation being built.   CryptoBridge seemed interested except that they don’t have ZEC support but said they would contact when it was added.

[14-Oct-18 01:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Other influencers and people I speak with are impressed which what’s been done by James and the team so far.

A white paper would be pretty simple yes?   I will find time for that this week unless someone is confident and has the skill to do that.   I would greatly appreciate it.

[14-Oct-18 01:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
To me.... our biggest hurdle... with a privacy coin used for payments.... is to get the avenue of use laid out.    This means the shop plugin currently under development....  Once we have exchange and price support, the our doors open up for this.   We can also start pushing our coin to more info sites as well with this like CMC coingecko livecoinwatch ...  then in the future mobile wallet will enable further P2P spending.

[14-Oct-18 01:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It is tough to sustain a continually increasing price on a new coin who’s functionality is complete but the avenue of remittance is not.  The onboarding of new pirates and James fantastic referral plan will alleviate much of the lull until we get the above completed.

[14-Oct-18 01:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I really appreciate everyone’s desire to participate and throw ideas out.   

Do not hesitate to DM me to discuss them.   My gangplank is always down.

`It is tough to sustain a continually increasing price on a new coin who’s functionality is complete but the avenue of remittance is not.`
That's quite true, and a good part of why I asked about pricing earlier (to gauge just how far of a divide there is between where *I* think it *should be* and where others do)

[14-Oct-18 02:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
One more thing about articles and editorials.... @Seko has been great and is taking charge of the medium layouts, submissions and reviews.   Send him a DM with your medium handle if yo want to be added as an Author. 

We spiff KMD or ARRR for well written original content.

@FishyGuts i have a bit of hard-learned advice about `Then we Attack the info campaign-dissecting all other privacy coins and showing why we are superior.`

[14-Oct-18 02:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts best to show off how awesome pirate is, without shit-talking other specific coins, which just causes all kinds of bad juju

[14-Oct-18 02:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto He's done a really good job at staying factual and not anything that, imo, could be viewed as "shit-talking"

[14-Oct-18 02:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts I am guilty of shit talking about other coins, and it caused a lot of unnecessary drama that benefited nobody but the trolls. I learned my lesson. Best to describe as precisely as you can, why your tech is better, leave the shit talking for other places

[14-Oct-18 02:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 agreed, it was only a bit of future advice

[14-Oct-18 02:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have seen nothing but awesome marketing about ARRR so far

[14-Oct-18 02:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, it's easy to get pulled into the muck and mire with shitcoin zealots

[14-Oct-18 02:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
metrics about how many more shielded xtns ARRR has, than any other ZEC-related chain, is golden

[14-Oct-18 02:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's been something I wanted to build for a while now. It's not easy to, at a glance, look at which ZEC-fork chains have more shielded xtns that others, this week or last month or any time period

[14-Oct-18 02:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
real hard data, that would make ARRR look like a golden child

[14-Oct-18 02:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't know what the pirate equivalent of a golden child is

@CowboyCrypto @YORK780 @devilscompiler recently said that getting privacy development in crypto right is akin to practicing medicine.   
Do it wrong and people get hurt.  

$ZEC for privacy is like puttin some ‘tussin on it.  

$ARRR is like John Hopkins Medical Center.

Since these are new waters, I do appreciate every piece of advice @dukeleto as well as any criticism and praise @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[14-Oct-18 02:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Everyone here has been killer and I have the utmost respect when you guys want to discuss ways to do it better.

[14-Oct-18 02:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Im new to the crypto scene compared to most of you so I’ll try to never pretend like I know better.  I’m always learning.

[14-Oct-18 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Given that you're moving ftl, I can't see too much that could be "better"
Just do you the way you've been you and I think it will come up roses

[14-Oct-18 02:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I love the hard data approach.   We just layout why our pieces to the puzzle are better.    
I picture an infographic displaying privacy as a puzzle.

[14-Oct-18 02:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Pirate is a 4 piece puzzle... and other coins are puzzles with pieces missing.

[14-Oct-18 02:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Just one example.   

Maybe a privacy treasure map... I dunno.

[14-Oct-18 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts yup, some hard data and shiny graphics go a long way 😃

[14-Oct-18 02:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts to pull shielded data from a collection of Zcash-related coins, such as KMD, ZEC, ZCL, HUSH, BTCP

let's fucking measure how private Bitcoin Private is

[14-Oct-18 03:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
see, it's hard for me to not shit talk, but I work on it. Let's measure the privacy diff between BTCP, KMD and ARRR

[14-Oct-18 03:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you are mining or buying BTCP, do you know how private it is? It's 11pm, do you know where your UTXOs are?

[14-Oct-18 03:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
by design, ARRR will blow away the competition in the statistic "% of shielded xtns"

[14-Oct-18 03:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
rank all ZEC forks by % of shielded xtns

[14-Oct-18 03:03 PM] dukeleto#7326

you could, in real-time, show xtns flying by, as pirate ships
