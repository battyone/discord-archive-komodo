On NH, 5Msol/s right now is 0.1107 BTC per 1M

[30-Sep-18 08:18 AM] 0x03#8822
oof

[30-Sep-18 08:18 AM] 0x03#8822
what was the last trade?

[30-Sep-18 08:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
last sale I had was at 0.11 KMD per PIRATE

[30-Sep-18 08:21 AM] 0x03#8822
in theory price should continually go up

[30-Sep-18 08:21 AM] 0x03#8822
lets see

[30-Sep-18 08:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't know how to discuss the pricing issue without being more offensive than I normally come across 😕

[30-Sep-18 08:23 AM] 0x03#8822
for my part, i think i can handle it

[30-Sep-18 08:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
broke ass hobbyists need to stop undercutting onboarding by 25-40%

[30-Sep-18 08:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[30-Sep-18 08:24 AM] 0x03#8822

[30-Sep-18 08:25 AM] Alright#0419
onboarding price is arbitrary

[30-Sep-18 08:25 AM] 0x03#8822
what, no complaint about hardforks? 😄

[30-Sep-18 08:25 AM] 0x03#8822
i am disappointed 😛

[30-Sep-18 08:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`onboarding price is arbitrary`
True, but it was set according to market (and yes this is a market, we're not having that convo again)

[30-Sep-18 08:26 AM] Alright#0419
market at the time, yes

[30-Sep-18 08:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and the prevailing market has risen while people are trying to undercut the market to get $2 worth

[30-Sep-18 08:27 AM] 0x03#8822
so it's already a 'sell for as much as you still can get' kindof behaviour?

[30-Sep-18 08:27 AM] 0x03#8822
...may people have a hard time believing in the actual value of pirate?

[30-Sep-18 08:27 AM] 0x03#8822
i mean, tbh, if we saw this from the outside, we'd probably think 'scam'

[30-Sep-18 08:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so it's already a 'sell for as much as you still can get' kindof behaviour?`
well, that's trading in a nutshell to begin with

[30-Sep-18 08:28 AM] 0x03#8822
would'nt usually an impulse to hodl have to be weighted in as well 😉

[30-Sep-18 08:29 AM] Alright#0419

[30-Sep-18 08:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Ignore that I'm a miner, for a minute...
If you see me buy at 0.08, dafuq makes you think that I'm selling to you for 0.06
(you being general)

[30-Sep-18 08:30 AM] 0x03#8822
exactly that hashappened yesterday, twice

[30-Sep-18 08:30 AM] 0x03#8822
seeing your sell orders at price X, 5min later somebody chips in with a way lower price

[30-Sep-18 08:30 AM] 0x03#8822

who wants an espresso btw, brb

[30-Sep-18 08:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lower I can see, to an extent
I set x, you set x-y to get the sale
that's competition
Whales buying at 0.11 and guppies trying to get scraps at 0.06 is just feken silly

[30-Sep-18 08:34 AM] 0x03#8822
i think it will change when the orderbooks will be decoupled from names

[30-Sep-18 08:34 AM] 0x03#8822
which isnt the case with OTC

[30-Sep-18 08:34 AM] 0x03#8822
i think this explains a lot of the 'why dont they buy from me' also

[30-Sep-18 08:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright is the closest I believe that I could ever call a friend as far as a person that I only know online and have never met irl, he and I have talked extensively over time, and I have a longer DM log from a guy trying to get me to sell at 1/2 price than I have of everything Alright and I have discussed 🤦🏿

dafuq ia a "milk bag"? Besides the thing that sits inside a bra?

you have these plastic bottles dont u

[30-Sep-18 08:40 AM] 0x03#8822
at least in germany (probably all over EU) we use these tetrapaks

[30-Sep-18 08:41 AM] 0x03#8822
they are useful when they're 1/3 down. completely impossible to get the milk to where you want it after you open it, tho

actually... using a bottle like ^

[30-Sep-18 08:42 AM] 0x03#8822
the solution to my problem would be a small hole in the handle

[30-Sep-18 08:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
45 years of pouring milk the same way, all a hole in the handle would do for me is make me spill it all over myself when I forget it's there 😛

[30-Sep-18 08:44 AM] 0x03#8822
well i'm in the mid of my 30s. by some that you usually encounter within cryptospace, i'm probably also stone aged

[30-Sep-18 08:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was already in my 40s when I finally accepted that crypto would be a real thing, so you're doing better than me 😛

[30-Sep-18 08:47 AM] 0x03#8822
'a real thing'.. that reminds me of the reactions mr nakamoto got upon his original release 😄

[30-Sep-18 08:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_thought that mining "this new Bitcoin thing" was just going to be a fad... years later, he's spending 9000x just trying to break even_

[30-Sep-18 08:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What I thought then is every reason I like PIRATE now, I saw the banks and govts perverting it into something meaningless (I just thought they'd do it a lot faster)

[30-Sep-18 08:52 AM] 0x03#8822
on the way to meaningless-ness theyre putting up a bunch of fights

[30-Sep-18 08:52 AM] 0x03#8822
thats why i'm into crypto in the first place

[30-Sep-18 08:54 AM] 0x03#8822
so we have this tech, that people are into. all you hear from our government is 'we will regulate it'

[30-Sep-18 08:54 AM] 0x03#8822
and they seem to have 0 clue what to do about it

[30-Sep-18 08:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not really as much fight as you might think. When you take a serious look at CEXs, banks, and how people "value" crypto, you'll see that we just traded a ton of separate banks for 6 world banks

[30-Sep-18 08:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"It's not on an exchange, so it has no real value" 🤦🏿

[30-Sep-18 08:55 AM] 0x03#8822
so - all hell about to break lose should some 'irl exchange' list crypto?

[30-Sep-18 08:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[30-Sep-18 09:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, there's that too... the short of the "real" banks not getting into crypto is that they would no longer be able to use the fake/ghost 90% of non-existent capital that they rely on

[30-Sep-18 09:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
