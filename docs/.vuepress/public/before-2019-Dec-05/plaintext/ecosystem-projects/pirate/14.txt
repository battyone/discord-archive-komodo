Enjoy the profit

[03-Sep-18 02:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Thanks for correcting me. Was trying Wong way. Will mine next coins.

[03-Sep-18 02:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
U guys have a long term holder here for this coin.

[03-Sep-18 02:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can stop buying just try mining further if I can.

[03-Sep-18 02:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Never tried nomp and such. It's learning phase for me on this.

[03-Sep-18 02:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Will ask for all ur help here. üôÉ

[03-Sep-18 04:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Nice I had a look at it, and deicded to wait for your version üòÑ

[03-Sep-18 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Most of the code seemed to be there already for sheilding, I was going to change sendTtoZ function to take array of address then call it istead of sendmany API, but maybe that wouldnt have worked.

[03-Sep-18 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Glad to see you figured it out... I better get more hash on PIRATE before the pool is up and the block reward halves.

[03-Sep-18 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[03-Sep-18 10:08 AM] SHossain#0007
you still have more a month and half before the halving occurs

[03-Sep-18 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes very very fast coin emission a the start on this coin üòÇ

[03-Sep-18 10:11 AM] SHossain#0007
i'll stop mining in couple of days...

[03-Sep-18 10:11 AM] SHossain#0007
you can mine most of the blocks for next 2 weeks üòÉ

[03-Sep-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure I will for that much longer, I only put back into hash what I made in profits.

[03-Sep-18 11:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

anything relating to this project can end up to it's own dedicated github org

[03-Sep-18 11:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackjok3r @webworker01 if you think it's good to move pirate related mining code to this github repo, we can do that

[03-Sep-18 11:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
keep deving on your own repo, we can have yours forked to this github org repo

[03-Sep-18 11:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like jl777 code is forked to kp org repos

[03-Sep-18 11:26 AM] SHossain#0007
@grewalsatinder don't you want to move the pirate.black website to the gh org repo?

[03-Sep-18 11:26 AM] SHossain#0007

I first moved it from meshbits to github user acount, then thought let's make the org of this, so didn't moved it

[03-Sep-18 11:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
can move it if more are willing to contribute to it's code

[03-Sep-18 11:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
can be done anytime

[03-Sep-18 11:28 AM] SHossain#0007
having everything in `PirateNetwork` org repo sounds better idea to me. all at one place üòÉ

[03-Sep-18 11:28 AM] SHossain#0007
just a thought

[03-Sep-18 11:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[03-Sep-18 12:03 PM] Nj#9394
perhaps on win? or only linux?

[03-Sep-18 12:06 PM] SHossain#0007
you can use the chain on any OS

[03-Sep-18 12:07 PM] Nj#9394
I already have Agama. but I can not run the chain on win /

[03-Sep-18 12:12 PM] SHossain#0007
if you can use command prompt, you can run the chain. there is no GUI available for PIRATE chain. only way is using CLI on any OS

[03-Sep-18 12:12 PM] SHossain#0007
Agama doesn't have support for this chain yet

[03-Sep-18 12:14 PM] Nj#9394
Oh sure. please tell me the CLI link. since many are incorrect.

[03-Sep-18 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the komodod is in the agama folder, just launch it with the channel title

[03-Sep-18 12:18 PM] Nj#9394
there is an invalid link for win64 cli.

[03-Sep-18 02:31 PM] jorian#4555
i can send you the rest

[03-Sep-18 04:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What is pirate and why do I need to buy it now to be able to buy a lambo in a month?

[03-Sep-18 04:10 PM] jorian#4555
no-one will know you are rich enough to buy a lambo

[03-Sep-18 04:11 PM] jorian#4555
PIRATE is forced anonymity

[03-Sep-18 04:11 PM] jorian#4555
it's the good from Monero combined with the good from Zcash

[03-Sep-18 04:27 PM] scubapanda#2485
Hope someone gets a pool running soon!

[03-Sep-18 04:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@jorian aha and is it a test project to test possibilities or will it actively be marketed?

[03-Sep-18 04:32 PM] jorian#4555
both

[03-Sep-18 04:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
mineable from wallet or diff already too high?

[03-Sep-18 04:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It's equihash so probably not

[03-Sep-18 04:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have 2 minis on it still

[03-Sep-18 04:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont think I am getting all blocks any more

[03-Sep-18 04:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You are getting all blocks? üòÑ

[03-Sep-18 04:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unlikely able to CPU mine it.. I was

[03-Sep-18 04:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So selfish :p

[03-Sep-18 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I had pool on first...

@grewalsatinder kudos for the website!

[03-Sep-18 05:29 PM] jorian#4555
you should add a tip address üòâ

[03-Sep-18 05:48 PM] Alright#0419
so someone else finally started NHing? üòÖ

[03-Sep-18 05:48 PM] Alright#0419
darn

[03-Sep-18 05:50 PM] metaphilibert#0926
It seems, difficulty passed the million üòï

[03-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Alright#0419
definitely temporary

[03-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Alright#0419
whoever that was rented a ton of hash for a short amount of time

[03-Sep-18 05:52 PM] jorian#4555
million.. boy

[03-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Alright#0419
or at least I hope so üòÇ

[03-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Alright#0419
that'd be a couple hundred dollars a day though to rent

[03-Sep-18 05:56 PM] scubapanda#2485
Wow.. "difficulty": 1148142.276503586

[03-Sep-18 05:58 PM] metaphilibert#0926
I hope you're right @Alright üòÖ

[03-Sep-18 05:59 PM] metaphilibert#0926
I temporarily remove my poor gpu's from the race , will be cooler here

[03-Sep-18 06:12 PM] Alright#0419
restarting my pool with 
```
    "rewardRecipients": {
    "RRyyejME7LRTuvdziWsXkAbSW1fdiohGwK":1.0
    },
```
Anyone else willing to do the same?

[03-Sep-18 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
pump SUPERNET NAV full of PIRATE anyone?

[03-Sep-18 07:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Alright thanks for ur help mate. Setup my nomp last night. Will try NH probably tonight on it.

[03-Sep-18 07:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
N good morning Pirates! ‚ò†Ô∏èüíÄ
How‚Äôs goin?

[03-Sep-18 07:30 PM] Alright#0419
someone is slamming the chain with NH atm, you probably want to wait until the diff comes down to rent NH

[03-Sep-18 07:31 PM] Alright#0419
or compete with them, not sure

[03-Sep-18 07:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Alright I have komodod running with diff pubkey than what is setup in nomp setup.
Where would I expect the block rewards go?

[03-Sep-18 07:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess still in pubkey address?

[03-Sep-18 07:35 PM] Alright#0419
the address you have set in nomp

[03-Sep-18 07:35 PM] Alright#0419
no, the stratum simply gives blocks the the daemon it's connected to

[03-Sep-18 07:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Hmmm okay so it‚Äôs only if komodo in built mining is used it sends block rewards to that pubkey

[03-Sep-18 07:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Thanks for clearing

[03-Sep-18 07:59 PM] Alright#0419
what is the error when it rejects the blocks?

[03-Sep-18 08:05 PM] scubapanda#2485
Are we up to 5% of Komodo difficulty with 1523679?

[03-Sep-18 08:06 PM] Alright#0419
difficulty on Komodo is weird because of NNs

[03-Sep-18 08:06 PM] CHMEX#0686
its not pirate related but if you want to jumble funds now might be a good time as 442k KMD are currently shielded from 128k last week

[03-Sep-18 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
diff around 25 million
