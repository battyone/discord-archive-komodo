Thanks! I have intake cones (purchased from amazon) mounted to the miners, with holes on the side of the box

[06-Nov-18 03:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Hey guys.... I just want to give everyone a heads up... with the new exchange listing, expect the price to drop.  It‚Äôs just the nature of things.

[06-Nov-18 03:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
About 2-3 months after our listing we should start to see value increase as we start to add to our list of fundamentals.

[06-Nov-18 03:51 AM] Draeth#3300
no worries Captain, i'm in it for the long haul üòÉ

[06-Nov-18 03:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Even on binance look.   Coins pump them they dump.

[06-Nov-18 03:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Just wanted to throw that out there.

[06-Nov-18 03:52 AM] Draeth#3300
yea, it generally happens with every coin, spikes in the beginning, drops low, then climbs back up

[06-Nov-18 03:58 AM] TheGemologist#6023
so it is going to list on Crex?

[06-Nov-18 03:58 AM] yousurnayme#1631
Usually the drop is from ICO dumpers though. Only reason Pirate should drop significantly over an extended period of time is (1) the community stops growing (i.e. demand dries up), or (2) the big miners dump. Seems like the miners have pretty strong hands and are setting prices above 0.2 KMD, and seems like the community is growing organically at an impressive clip. I'm bullish on prices!

[06-Nov-18 03:58 AM] TheGemologist#6023
i thought you would wait

[06-Nov-18 04:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
I would think there is constant sell pressure to fund mining. I think It‚Äôs still above where it was at trading otc before being listed.

[06-Nov-18 04:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@yousurnayme I‚Äôve seen it on 100% PoW coins too.

[06-Nov-18 04:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We‚Äôre gonna have two months of sell pressure outpacing buy pressure.

[06-Nov-18 04:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
As we buidld use case and outlets for pirate...

[06-Nov-18 04:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The demand Will grow... hopefully right around the time thenminers who are dumping are out of coins to dump.

@house the amount of work i'd have to put into it, even if i charged 5% fee, is hilarious

[06-Nov-18 09:49 AM] 0x03#8822
and the feedback of the people you get certainly is less than friendly, especially for a free pool like mine.

thats not "people dont understand"

as a general rule, people using services suck. did you ever stop to wonder why I waited 2 years into mining to start putting up a pool? :trollface:

[06-Nov-18 09:56 AM] 0x03#8822
well, thats one of the things you learn while administering enduser systems anyways: "without the users, this here would be quite a job"

[06-Nov-18 09:57 AM] house#8741
Can I ask ... why did you set up pool with no fee ?

[06-Nov-18 09:57 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
kindness for a new coin

[06-Nov-18 09:58 AM] 0x03#8822
