[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Once the new tortuga is up and running and we create the foundation, binance will come to us anyways

[19-Nov-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Having the entire caymans accept pirate as a payment one the PoS is developed will put the attention of the entire crypto world on us

[19-Nov-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> 1 island to begin with is not too bad

[19-Nov-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> 1 island = a launch pad to go everywhere else

[19-Nov-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> It shows our use case and that it works

[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> regarding TPB... 
 some members here  have reached out before (and lets all continue to do so)

A presence here may get us on TPB and all the proxies.->  https://pirates-forum.org/
other wise... a presence there is probably good anyway... 
The "official" TPB  has multiple coins listed , all the proxy ones (from what I have seen) have just BTC
BTC addys are different across the proxies too.   So I assume theres some independent action there and may need direct contact.
Justr some thoughts.

[19-Nov-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> idk why people tag @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 👴🏼📢 either

[dscrd-prt] <Llama> How many full nodes do we have? I just read that BTC only has 10k and i thought we had around 1k ish?

[19-Nov-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `How many full nodes do we have?`
I've got 10 🤣

[19-Nov-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `I just read that BTC only has 10k`
given that most users only have wallet running for 5 mins or less, that's not as bad as it seems at 1st glance

[19-Nov-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> is there somethin that incetivizes people directly to run full nodes ?

[19-Nov-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> it makes the network more secure or somethin like that

[19-Nov-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `is there somethin that incetivizes people directly to run full nodes ?`
decentralization

[19-Nov-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> being cool

[19-Nov-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> saying that you run a full node

[19-Nov-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> a lot of benefits

[19-Nov-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> if you don't run a full node and the network forks, you don't get the right to complain that you're on the "wrong side" of a vote

[19-Nov-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> any consensus change relies on nodes to pick the "proper" code
applies less with our alignments, but in general

[19-Nov-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LoPhatMelk> The pirate chest is the coolest full node you can run.

This is really funny how MW fans find your article “nothing new”.
This is really funny how MW fans find your article “nothing new”. So basically the argument is MW is well private because the known attack is known from the beginning, so it does not work, because…

[19-Nov-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> But side from that, I'm still working on the details for the foundation

[dscrd-prt] <Llama> ccx block reward increases as it progresses... weird.

[19-Nov-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> @Llama Thats because it designed to not punish late adopters or to give to much advantage to early ones. Its not about being first. Its a marathon that rewards the ones that stick with the project.

[19-Nov-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> I know it sounds weird at first but it makes sense if you think about it

[19-Nov-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> yes, inflation makes perfect sense (if you run a govt)

[19-Nov-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> There will probably be a steady decrease once the max emission per block is reached. CCX has a very slow emission and thus inflation

[19-Nov-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> Yeah I guess... it’s more of an argument on whether it’s better to reward early adopters or everyone

[19-Nov-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 👴🏼📢 You can check, the inflation is way lower then almost any coin out there

[19-Nov-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> @Llama Exactly

[19-Nov-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> Pirate chose a very fast emission on the other hand

[19-Nov-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> I like the CCX approach more but this is a personal preference.

[19-Nov-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> Btw disclosure: I am a part of CCX team, so I am biased lol

[19-Nov-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> None of the ccx mining calculators work anywhere

[19-Nov-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> Really? They forgot to update the block rewards?

[19-Nov-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> I have not checked to be honest

[19-Nov-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> You can put in an infinite number for hashpower and the rewards will be infinite too

[19-Nov-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> Heh

[19-Nov-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> Anyway, a lot of people fail to understand the philosophy behind Conceal as we took many not so conventional approaches to the project.

[19-Nov-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> In the end the diversity is good for the investors
