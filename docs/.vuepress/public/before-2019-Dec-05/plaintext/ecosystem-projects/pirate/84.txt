i'm a cow.

[29-Sep-18 07:15 AM] 0x03#8822
mooooh.

[29-Sep-18 07:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I look like a cow, does that count?

[29-Sep-18 07:17 AM] 0x03#8822
and we have an indian around, so  we're basically safe 😛

[29-Sep-18 07:17 AM] 0x03#8822
however, WTS 2500 PIRATE @ 0.1KMD

[29-Sep-18 07:23 AM] Instel7#1416
(n00b question) Why accessing Pirate through Agama doesn't let you choose a wallet seed?

[29-Sep-18 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
native mode only

[29-Sep-18 07:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I made a public sell order, which isn't asked yet. I guess even if I make it 0.9, it won't sell.
because I do not trust ppl are actually buying at 0.9

[29-Sep-18 07:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if anyone buys at 0.9, I'll sell some in chunk

[29-Sep-18 07:25 AM] Instel7#1416
So, the data to enter to my Pirate funds through agama is stored in my PC, or where?

[29-Sep-18 07:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but it has to be public discussed trade

[29-Sep-18 07:25 AM] Flexatron#8809
Computergenie is lying?

[29-Sep-18 07:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I do not know

[29-Sep-18 07:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hence public trade offer

[29-Sep-18 07:25 AM] Flexatron#8809
I got offered to buy at 0.088

[29-Sep-18 07:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`because I do not trust ppl are actually buying at 0.[0]9`
I could tell you 14 people that have, but that would defeat the point of the whole thing 😛

[29-Sep-18 07:26 AM] Flexatron#8809
Haha

[29-Sep-18 07:26 AM] Flexatron#8809
:trollface:

[29-Sep-18 07:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree on that privacy point genie

[29-Sep-18 07:26 AM] Instel7#1416
Can anyone help me (?)

[29-Sep-18 07:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but then again, I want to see a trade which is public and matches the claimed sell prices

[29-Sep-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
#deleted-channel  for newbie questions

[29-Sep-18 07:27 AM] Instel7#1416
Thanks @jl777c !

[29-Sep-18 07:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if we had tortuga already running would have been easier to see the actual trades

[29-Sep-18 07:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbh, I have 0 idea why anyone bought from me yesterday and Alright couldn't sell his for 20% less if he gave hookers away with it

[29-Sep-18 07:29 AM] 0x03#8822
this OTC involves too much personal surface

[29-Sep-18 07:29 AM] 0x03#8822
that leaves people free to choose if somebodys nose is to theirliking or not

[29-Sep-18 07:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
because of this blind trades, I want to see a trade discussed and happen in public 
give me an offer, and I'll trust that's the price

[29-Sep-18 07:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
else I can also say that I sold 21 million pirate at 0.1 BTC rate

[29-Sep-18 07:30 AM] 0x03#8822
my last order was me, selling for .1, exactly 500 pirates

[29-Sep-18 07:30 AM] Flexatron#8809
Escrow?

[29-Sep-18 07:30 AM] 0x03#8822
the 2 people that bought from me seemed to trust me 😛

{Reactions}
👌 

[29-Sep-18 07:30 AM] Flexatron#8809
You sold for 0.1?

[29-Sep-18 07:30 AM] 0x03#8822
yes sir

[29-Sep-18 07:31 AM] Flexatron#8809
Nice

[29-Sep-18 07:31 AM] 0x03#8822
only a very small amount tho.

[29-Sep-18 07:31 AM] 0x03#8822
idont think anyone will want to buy 10k at this rate (yet)

[29-Sep-18 07:32 AM] Flexatron#8809
If so, PM me😁

[29-Sep-18 07:33 AM] 0x03#8822
well, part of the OTC fun is that people will have to do their own research 😉

[29-Sep-18 07:33 AM] 0x03#8822
but i think it'll help all if a trade price is just announced once the trade has finished

[29-Sep-18 07:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@grewalsatinder also, not sure if the non-acceptance of your offer has to do with
the ath price
the public aspect
the time of day
or
the fact that you're selling a lot of 100k

[29-Sep-18 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
0.1 price is for small lots of very large one

[29-Sep-18 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
we have a "U" shaped price curve based on volume where the smallest and largest trades have the highest prices

[29-Sep-18 07:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 change the conditions, let me know, and maybe I can sell you.

[29-Sep-18 07:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
except public part

[29-Sep-18 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
how much for a genie? Always wanted to have my own

[29-Sep-18 07:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can sell genie at 0.8 kmd

[29-Sep-18 07:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
To have me as your own, not even you have that much KMD :trollface:

[29-Sep-18 07:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[29-Sep-18 07:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, drop the price to 1/10th of that, make it 10k PIRATE, and I might just do it so that we have the 1st public private trade

[29-Sep-18 07:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so will buy 10k pirate at 0.1 kmd?

[29-Sep-18 07:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[29-Sep-18 07:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[29-Sep-18 07:49 AM] 0x03#8822

[29-Sep-18 07:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for me, yes I want to determin price

[29-Sep-18 07:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[29-Sep-18 07:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
