I wonder if they are ignoring or plotting at this point. ü§îü§îü§î

That‚Äôs a VERY good question!

[10-Nov-18 03:22 AM] radix42#3743
I‚Äôll make some calls next week and maybe see if I can find out

[10-Nov-18 03:23 AM] radix42#3743
They totally dictate electronic data and payment interchange with all they suppliers and could just say ‚Äúyou WILL at our option be paid in $crypto or we find someone else to supply what you make‚Äù

Speaking of.... Im about to google "How to start a cryptocurrency foundation" and get prepped for my meetings with attorneys.  

Anyone here have a reputable crypto legal referral and / or links to this stuff?   Would prefer to not start at ground zero if I don't have to.

[10-Nov-18 04:51 AM] HenryChinaski#2919
Ahoy!
Im reading how you guys want the project to grow and that seems awesome!
One idea i really liked is that the ethereum guys made some sort of "world tour" for universities, especially science universities, they got our emails and send us a lot of info, the basics of what is a blockchain, smart contracts and all that stuff, they where also aiming to create some sort of "crypto clubs" where students could build, program and understand all the crypto stuff, sounded really nice but they never did that jaja

[10-Nov-18 04:52 AM] HenryChinaski#2919

We don't have the "learning development" opporunity that ETH had ( And should have capitalized on more ).

[10-Nov-18 04:59 AM] FishyGuts#5085
But we can certainly expose these users to pirate.  
Perhaps through lectures and discussions.  
That would be something we would need someone here to do, to be financed and capable to do.
Focus on privacy, financial privacy and crypto privacy.

[10-Nov-18 05:06 AM] HenryChinaski#2919

@FishyGuts Please let me know about future campaigns because I love to make some extra ARRR

[10-Nov-18 05:54 AM] FishyGuts#5085
All of our chances to earn ARRR will be very visible.  

Some people have been earning extra spiffs here and there by writing articles, creating expousre and bringing Pirate to the public eye.

[10-Nov-18 06:04 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
That is right, we are back sailing the seven seas. Our first block (although it is about our 500+ block, the stats were reset unfortunately) is the first of many to be found! If you're a miner and looking for a 0% fee, low payout pool (20 ARRR), please consider http://minethepiratechain.black.

[10-Nov-18 08:26 AM] Mr. HashEm#3357
Why the price is so low at the exchange ? :/

[10-Nov-18 08:35 AM] BlockTech#6895
@Mr. HashEm Some will say because "dumpers b' dumpin" instead of Holding, and there is not enough buyers right now, or at least they don't want to go on DP and wait for another exchange. (Pirate is new, there is some buy orders and i don't see the price any day below 0,08) it's a common "dump" at this stage of a project (2 months old, first exchange, lots of miners, few buyers) but we need some months before seing 0,3-0,5KMD again and raise awarness about the project. üòâ

Yes, the market is rough with us, but it's only a matter of time until people start understanding komodo tech is the most advanced tech out there. And finally then, we'll maybe get into top 10 marketcap. At least it's where it's supposed to be in my opinion

Blackbeard suddenly appears over the main deck, gazing starkly into the night sky. A warm blush compliments his tar stained face.

The crew look up, some compelled to raise to their feet ... and as Blackbeard clears his throat ... not only the crew ... but it seems the ocean itself falls silent in anticipation of hearing his raspy words]*
