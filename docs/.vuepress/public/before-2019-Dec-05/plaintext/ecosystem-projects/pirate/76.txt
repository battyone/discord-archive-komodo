I can do the same price if anyone wants to buy

[28-Sep-18 12:04 PM] Alright#0419
Can you explain your logic behind buying from him at .09 while others have open offers at a cheaper price?

[28-Sep-18 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`who'd you sell it to? yourself?`
Just because you can't sell water to someone dying of dehydration doesn't mean you have to be salty 😛

Anyone else experiencing an issue where z txes are taking longer to create each time?

[28-Sep-18 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should only do that is it has to combine more "peices"

[28-Sep-18 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the last TX I did was T->Z 97 UTXO and took 70s on 36 maxed out cores

[28-Sep-18 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, my vm only has 2 😛

[28-Sep-18 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181

Could you hypothetically spam someone with 0.000001utxos

[28-Sep-18 12:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
So they can’t move their loot

[28-Sep-18 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no... because Z address doesnt use utxo

I think

[28-Sep-18 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not 100% on that ut utxo is T adress

[28-Sep-18 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Z is called something else

[28-Sep-18 12:11 PM] Alright#0419
if you knew someone's z address @Deleted User

[28-Sep-18 12:11 PM] Alright#0419
can do the same to any normal address though

[28-Sep-18 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it would take you just as long to send it...

somebody is trying to have his or her way with my pool right now. i'll have to restart both the wallet and the pool to get 2 changes in place, and i'll use the chance to reboot off a new kernel while i'm already at it. this means some minutes of downtime tho - all shares and balances are safe. remember, it's a 0fee pool. and somebody certainly needs to try harder.

because my 2 core vm it would kill my pool b4 his 😛

[28-Sep-18 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you would need to do it with coinbase txs

[28-Sep-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
a stratum ointed at his pool address making 2000 utxo per block

[28-Sep-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1 block would kill it for hours

[28-Sep-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
:trollface:

[28-Sep-18 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I forget what ck said max was, but I'm pretty sure you can't do that many in coinbase

[28-Sep-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it wont take long to process taddr vout

[28-Sep-18 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i did one before with 97utxo T->Z 36 cores 70s

[28-Sep-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and if you make so many zaddrs, it will be slow

[28-Sep-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems like 2000 would take a hell ofa a long time

[28-Sep-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
the time was the zaddr

[28-Sep-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
not the taddr vins

[28-Sep-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but you can only send to Z

[28-Sep-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😕

[28-Sep-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but only 1 or 2 z outputs

[28-Sep-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I sent 97 T utxo to 1 z address 36 cores 70s 😕

[28-Sep-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
what does it usually take?

[28-Sep-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not that long

[28-Sep-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
how big was the tx?

[28-Sep-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
might be some strange edge case bug

[28-Sep-18 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
http://ckpool.org/pool/pool.work <- whatever the count is in the payouts, that's a rounded figure of the max you can put in the coinbase without issues to yourself

[28-Sep-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
