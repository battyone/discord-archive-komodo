@Cryptoon thanks for my first pirate.....

[13-Oct-18 11:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I found the tx, just no method in agama to copy, not that it matters as the tx shows nothing

[13-Oct-18 11:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
no worries, good to have you on board our ship @plazma 😃

[13-Oct-18 11:34 AM] plazma#1625

Oh thanks

@Acura Nice post on bct ("The privacy coin race")
I was about to post the info that Fishy had, but you beat me to it and for that context your post was better than what I was going to put

[13-Oct-18 02:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@plazma that mining button in Agama only uses your CPU, and solo CPU mining ARRR now is not feasible

[13-Oct-18 02:05 PM] Acura#2748
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you can also post your Content, not a problem 😉

ARRR

[13-Oct-18 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I set the PIRATE rpc... but it gives me Komodo diff btw`

`komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE ...`?
