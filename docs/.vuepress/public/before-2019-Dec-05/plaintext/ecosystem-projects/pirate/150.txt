Pirate being the 'subject' of the sentence 'Basically a replica with minor changes and a cool name.'?

[11-Oct-18 02:32 AM] ch6ris#5240
This is ridiculous, there is plenty of fiat here @Redbeard

I think a lot in the komodo ecosystem are looking at doing more than just make fiat dollars.

[11-Oct-18 02:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`there is plenty of fiat here`
That being the case, I'm selling ARRR at $1 per 15 ..... all you fiat people DM me

[11-Oct-18 02:36 AM] ch6ris#5240
It's called a centralized exchange.

[11-Oct-18 02:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that ain't "here"

Stop feeding the trolls.

[11-Oct-18 02:36 AM] ch6ris#5240
Yes but what is needed for it most certainly is here.

[11-Oct-18 02:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@FishyGuts That means I'd have to put on pants and I'm not doing that

[11-Oct-18 02:38 AM] FishyGuts#5085
But trolls love to eat pants.

[11-Oct-18 02:38 AM] ch6ris#5240
You blew this completely out of proportion and tried to poke holes in whatever you could find merely because I said assets don't always increase in value over time.

[11-Oct-18 02:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`But trolls love to eat pants.`
That's why I have none 😛

@ch6ris If you're talking to me about "out of proportion", I have no idea what assets comment you're talking about (which would make you wrong again).

[11-Oct-18 02:41 AM] ch6ris#5240
My post before you poked holes "Or maybe it is not the deal of the century, hodling may achieve nothing, and now is the best time to mine and sell.
fiat has a long way to go before it's days are numbered. I feel a cashless society is just around the corner, that doesn't mean it is not fiat.
My 2 cent's, Crypto is so fucking risky. Millions, Billions? have been lost and gone into the pockets of very few."

[11-Oct-18 02:42 AM] ch6ris#5240
I strongly believe you are one of those few.

[11-Oct-18 02:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The fact that I didn't scroll up that far is evidence that you're entirely wrong about my "motives" and I quoted what I was "poking holes in".

[11-Oct-18 02:43 AM] ch6ris#5240
Then your poking holes out of context.

[11-Oct-18 02:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Then type in complete sentences that are in context 😛

[11-Oct-18 02:44 AM] ch6ris#5240

Good for him, if true. I do often wonder if we are creating new Rockefeller’s in a new 50 year cycle..

Then, again, you believe wrongly. I have a shit-ton of unrealized losses, but as realized gains go, I have none at all.

You were born a goat?

[11-Oct-18 02:47 AM] ch6ris#5240
In hindsight you should of got out sooner. The loses are spread over millions of people.

[11-Oct-18 02:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
They are unrealized and as such meaningless.

[11-Oct-18 02:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Why would I get out instead of hold and recover them years from now?

lol, just might happen. I'm not saying it won't.

@FishyGuts I'm confused by your confession.

[11-Oct-18 02:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Am I pissed that I spent $500k last year that I can only sell for a loss? Yes. Did that actually come out of my pocket? No, it was turnover.

[11-Oct-18 02:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Is it possible to change pirate to btc?

[11-Oct-18 02:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you find a person that has the opposite and wants to trade, yes.

What if @FishyGuts is actually a double agent sent from Monero to infiltrate and sabotage Pirate?

[11-Oct-18 05:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What if he wasn't "sent" but that was the idea all along?

[11-Oct-18 05:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085

Pirate is next on the docket.   Looking into a Verus one too.

[11-Oct-18 05:09 AM] CHMEX#0686
10k transactions on PIRATE needs a lot of machines to process

[11-Oct-18 05:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Servers are included :trollface:

[11-Oct-18 05:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
What are our “active nodes” for this coin.

[11-Oct-18 05:26 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Exchange listing form question.

[11-Oct-18 05:28 AM] CHMEX#0686
I see 74 atm
But its way more maybe 150 is a good guess.

[11-Oct-18 05:28 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Is there a list or something to send them for an answer?

[11-Oct-18 05:29 AM] FishyGuts#5085
These guys say they can do it.   They probably don’t give a f about AML. 😆

[11-Oct-18 05:29 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Or they already have a solution.  

“It’s a KMD coin right?   Yeah we can do it.”

[11-Oct-18 05:30 AM] CHMEX#0686
I can give you a list in a few with current nodes. But if they already know KMD can just run it and do
./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE getpeerinfo

Off to get us listed on an exchange.  CZ didn’t answer. 😔

[11-Oct-18 05:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I use a program called jq, so getting things like that from cli is pretty ez

[11-Oct-18 05:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's quite handy when playing with json

[11-Oct-18 05:40 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Stop playing with json and get back to mining!  😜

[11-Oct-18 05:42 AM] CHMEX#0686
I think mining has lot to do with JSON. 
The better you understand whats in the data the better you can adjust your operation. The data is in JSON.

[11-Oct-18 05:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I wouldn't know how to mine w/out json -- it's what the cli deals in 😛

[11-Oct-18 06:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Learning json is required for any blockchain related things.
