Add an SSD.  You can get a good one for $100+-

[15-Oct-18 01:28 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Download those PKs onto three usbs.  One to use one to store and one to store somewhere safer in case the first two get corrupted.  At least two.   Had a corrupted usb once thankfully i had it happen just updating me files.

[15-Oct-18 01:28 AM] Llama#1330

At least use a offline PC with 7-zip to encrypt the notepad file before loading it to usb :p

[15-Oct-18 02:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Or you can ever note it with no password, that seems to work too

[15-Oct-18 02:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@hyperDEX 54 pages so I scanned for 2 seconds.... zercash privacy coin?

@FishyGuts basically what pirate already has if it did cc too

[15-Oct-18 02:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
and yes.....zerocash lol

I hate to reveal what a newbie I am but I assume it would be a good thing to increase ARRR profile. For example would it be strange to make an inquiry to Coinomi about why I can't add Pirate to my Coinomi wallet. I am enjoying mining on the piratepool.io but it struck me how hard it is to find any info on this coin because the keyword pirate just swamps results with sailing pirates. Heh. I am just fascinated with the chatter about this coin as for other coins there is a sense of complete disconnectedness.

[15-Oct-18 04:29 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Right now, pirate is desktop only due to the need of running a full node and having adequate hardware to do z transactions .  When sapling and mobile upgrades happen in Zcash I'm sure they will be merged into pirate

[15-Oct-18 05:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Coinomi does not have full zaddr support that I am aware of but I will reach out to their team to ensure that.   
The problem mainly lies in the difficult processing power for the z transactions.

diff is up, BTC is up, KMD is up, that means ARRR should go up

[15-Oct-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just because you took profits off KMD and BTC to rent hash on ARRR isnt going to make it moon 😉

But but mining aint free:abusedsmily:

[15-Oct-18 09:34 AM] LocoMB#8593
here is a thought on the Exchange question with ARRR:
as I understand, because of z-add only, DEX is not possible- so how about someone write a CC where an agreed upon exchange is pushed through in small batches?
tedious and forbidding manually, but then if there is smart contract to incrementally exchange 10, 100, or 1000 batches, then the counterparty risk would be limited to one batch only ... old concept ofc, but unfeasible w/o smart contracts- but for ARRR this could be an important ingredient

[15-Oct-18 09:35 AM] twistedmind#1523
can someone put together one spreadsheet that we can put our buy's and sell's on?

[15-Oct-18 09:35 AM] twistedmind#1523
start our own "spredsheet sheet otc" exchange

[15-Oct-18 09:36 AM] twistedmind#1523
just a thought

[15-Oct-18 09:38 AM] Flexatron#8809

when schooner?

[15-Oct-18 11:53 AM] klunex#3191
hey! Did i understand it right? Each coin running in native mode on agama wallet uses a wallet.dat which contains the keys. So pirate supposed to use a wallet.dat?

[15-Oct-18 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, every assetchain has its own wallet.dat file

[15-Oct-18 11:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because assetchains are each their own full chain

[15-Oct-18 11:56 AM] klunex#3191
for kmd i use a seed (spv mode). The keys in the wallet.dat of pirate, they have nothing to do with the seed right? Should i better backup the wallet.dat?

[15-Oct-18 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
backup the privkey for your zaddr

[15-Oct-18 11:56 AM] klunex#3191
