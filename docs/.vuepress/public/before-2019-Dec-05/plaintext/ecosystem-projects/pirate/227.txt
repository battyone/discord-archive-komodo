before i was using 3 different pool of pirate

[26-Oct-18 10:23 AM] kaks#6612
after i use only 1 pool at asic configuration

[26-Oct-18 10:24 AM] kaks#6612
you can try to use 1 single pool at see the difference ðŸ˜ƒ

[26-Oct-18 10:24 AM] Bikob2#4549
I use 1 pool for 5 asics and see this https://ibb.co/cKmD3A

I want to mine with z9. Which pool is good stable. What is the format for line command?

[26-Oct-18 10:25 AM] kaks#6612
@Bikob2  delete other pools from asic configuration

[26-Oct-18 10:26 AM] kaks#6612
pool 2 and pool 3 must be empty

[26-Oct-18 10:26 AM] Oszy#5734
@godgreat https://polly.chainstrike.io/ low payout, stable pool.

[26-Oct-18 10:26 AM] Oszy#5734
info to connect is in the top menu

[26-Oct-18 10:27 AM] godgreat#0235
Top menu means pinned messages?

[26-Oct-18 10:28 AM] godgreat#0235
Ah in polly site

[26-Oct-18 10:30 AM] Oszy#5734
yeah there ðŸ˜ƒ

sorry i tend to be unclear sometimes ðŸ˜„

@kaks there will always be large hashrate fluctuations - as the HR shown in pool is calculated by rate of shares sent

[26-Oct-18 10:44 AM] Bikob2#4549
is there difference what difficulty to use for ascis -  Low-Diff Port: 8888 - Hi-Diff Port: 18888 ?

[26-Oct-18 10:46 AM] penguin#0544
the difficulty difference results in solutions being hashed at different rates, therefore shares submitted to pool at different rates

[26-Oct-18 10:47 AM] penguin#0544
low diff port on high hashrate unit can cause pool issues

[26-Oct-18 10:51 AM] Bikob2#4549
thanks!

[26-Oct-18 10:52 AM] Bikob2#4549
by the way

[26-Oct-18 10:53 AM] Bikob2#4549
don't know why those 2 pools don't work for my asics - still dead in the status field

[26-Oct-18 10:54 AM] penguin#0544
100% certain all details are correct?

[26-Oct-18 10:54 AM] Bikob2#4549
yes

[26-Oct-18 10:54 AM] penguin#0544
most likely a DNS issue

[26-Oct-18 10:54 AM] penguin#0544
using a z-address?

[26-Oct-18 10:54 AM] Bikob2#4549
may be somethinkg about -Priate- word in the domain

[26-Oct-18 10:55 AM] Bikob2#4549
yes, z adress for sure

[26-Oct-18 10:55 AM] penguin#0544
ahok, you can try adding a public dns to your router - or specify static ip address with public dns in actual miner

[26-Oct-18 10:55 AM] penguin#0544
you are using an asic?

[26-Oct-18 10:55 AM] kaks#6612
@penguin but i sees changing pools

[26-Oct-18 10:55 AM] kaks#6612
see*

[26-Oct-18 10:56 AM] Bikob2#4549
yes, asic Z9

[26-Oct-18 11:06 AM] cryptographic#0598
ok got my 1080 ti mining now finally lol been a while

@Bikob2  working with pub dns?

[26-Oct-18 11:08 AM] cryptographic#0598
whats a decent sol/sec for 1080 ti ðŸ˜ƒ

[26-Oct-18 11:09 AM] Bikob2#4549
@penguin still trying

[26-Oct-18 11:10 AM] penguin#0544
~750 for 1080 ti

[26-Oct-18 11:10 AM] Oszy#5734
i gave him IP address of the pool before he said it didn't work so not dns i think.

[26-Oct-18 11:11 AM] cryptographic#0598
thanks penguin. guess i'll need to figure out better params

[26-Oct-18 11:12 AM] penguin#0544
Done any overclocking? Do some searching for your specific card though

[26-Oct-18 11:13 AM] Oszy#5734
when i had a 1080 Ti i think i was OC'ing it to +150 Core +400 mem on 70% TPD  I was getting more than 3 Sols/W

[26-Oct-18 11:13 AM] Oszy#5734
efficiency matters if you pay for electricity

[26-Oct-18 11:13 AM] penguin#0544
did memory oc actually make a difference?

[26-Oct-18 11:15 AM] Oszy#5734
it does a little but , if you going for efficiency then it's not worth.

[26-Oct-18 11:28 AM] cryptographic#0598
are the equihash asics worth buying?

[26-Oct-18 11:29 AM] cryptographic#0598
@penguin I prefer efficiency and low temps to max sol/sec ðŸ˜ƒ

[26-Oct-18 11:58 AM] penguin#0544
so far it does seem so - very noisy though ofc

[26-Oct-18 11:59 AM] penguin#0544
equihash on gpu isn't all that profitable anymore unless you gains some coins while nethash is low, lol

[26-Oct-18 12:15 PM] P3L3#1096
I'd like an opinion guys.. I have an opportunity to by 2 z9 mini asics
one is 1 batch the other 2nd batch..
do you think it is wise to buy them now?

[26-Oct-18 12:16 PM] Flexatron#8809
depends on your electricity costs

[26-Oct-18 12:17 PM] Flexatron#8809
i'd say you could still buy them if you have low costs but Im not an expert

[26-Oct-18 12:17 PM] P3L3#1096
well according to specifics 266w without oc is not much for me

[26-Oct-18 12:17 PM] Flexatron#8809
they have only been here for a few months.

[26-Oct-18 12:18 PM] P3L3#1096
ik thats why i'm planning to by them

[26-Oct-18 12:18 PM] P3L3#1096
just wanted someone's else opinion

[26-Oct-18 12:19 PM] Flexatron#8809
wait for a miner to respond

[26-Oct-18 12:19 PM] P3L3#1096
cheers

[26-Oct-18 12:21 PM] mcki#3376
run a 2nd batch z9mini with the frimware of 1st batch without problems at 725MHz / 340w

[26-Oct-18 12:25 PM] P3L3#1096
sweet

[26-Oct-18 12:35 PM] kaks#6612
not all z9minis support overclock to 750m, some of them goes crash ðŸ˜…

[26-Oct-18 12:48 PM] penguin#0544
@P3L3 better sooner than later !

[26-Oct-18 12:49 PM] penguin#0544
anyone know if it's an issue with all of the 2nd batch z9's ?

[26-Oct-18 12:49 PM] penguin#0544
where can I find the firmware from 1st batch miner - what are the changes?

[26-Oct-18 12:55 PM] kaks#6612
2 can overclock max to 550m , with firmware of 1 batch you can overcloc to 750m

[26-Oct-18 12:56 PM] P3L3#1096
i hear you can oc 2nd batch onl yup to 681

[26-Oct-18 12:56 PM] mcki#3376
as i said before my z9mini 2nd batch runs fine until 725MHz.
I had an old firmware backup from a 1st batch - wich runs flawlessly.
the only obvious change in 2nd batch firmware is that you cant specify the overclocking... thats all I know.

[26-Oct-18 12:57 PM] P3L3#1096
nice

[26-Oct-18 12:58 PM] P3L3#1096
so you guys think it still a good buy.. with my calculations i should get back what i invested within 3-4 months..

[26-Oct-18 12:59 PM] P3L3#1096
this is whats killing me.. the aren't new.. they've been running for 4 months already

[26-Oct-18 01:01 PM] mcki#3376
i thing it really depends on what you will pay for the z9mini and your electricity costs...

[26-Oct-18 01:03 PM] P3L3#1096
well i did soem calc and with a steady stream of $arrr 100 per day i should get what i invested within 3-4 months 
well, if the price stays as is now

What is the date of file system version on 2nd batch Z9 MINI ? - August ?

[26-Oct-18 01:16 PM] Domoo#4108
Hi, sorry to disturb you. I am filling the 7step of pirate competition. The 2 first ones worked well, but the last one is not working (the Twitter retweet). I delete cache & cookies. I was wondering if someone had a solution ?

[26-Oct-18 01:17 PM] kaks#6612
@penguin  26 may

did you bind discort to gleam.io

[26-Oct-18 01:18 PM] godgreat#0235
You can find all firmware here

[26-Oct-18 01:19 PM] P3L3#1096
thats so cool @godgreat  thanks

[26-Oct-18 01:23 PM] godgreat#0235

[26-Oct-18 01:26 PM] P3L3#1096
nice.. been wondering about the zmaster from Innosilicon..
any comment?

[26-Oct-18 01:32 PM] Domoo#4108
@P3L3 Yes I bind discord and twitter to glean.io  . However the problem seems to be with Twitter

[26-Oct-18 01:33 PM] Domoo#4108
But Twitter follow worked perfectly, but not the Twitter retweet

[26-Oct-18 01:36 PM] P3L3#1096
strange..

[26-Oct-18 01:41 PM] Domoo#4108
Yes

[26-Oct-18 02:27 PM] Lordofwar#2355
@P3L3 i have a bunch...love them. Make sure you get "first gear" if ordering from China

[26-Oct-18 02:31 PM] P3L3#1096
i hear its hard to get them by pcs.. like 5-6.. is this true..
i would guess not if not buying from Innosilicone straight
