@FishyGuts If I wanted to make an airdrop to the Pirate Community from PIXDUM with PXDs in the future, there is no way for doing it, right?

[23-Oct-18 01:55 AM] bishop#9773
Correct... you can't snapshot a zaddr chain

[23-Oct-18 01:57 AM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Yea, ummm!

[23-Oct-18 02:00 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Ignacio Figueroa (FIG) @CHMEX could open the onboarding code@we@used to where you could have pirates pay x amount for y pxd

[23-Oct-18 02:06 AM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
@FishyGuts  I am actually considering accepting ARRR and PXD (PIXDUM coin) as a way of payment inside the Gaming Platform once is built.

[23-Oct-18 02:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[23-Oct-18 02:09 AM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
So people can have options if they want to go completely annonymous with ARRR

@LoPhatMelk if you're going to take up a full screen in #deleted-channel at least math your prices correctly

[23-Oct-18 02:56 AM] LoPhatMelk#9055
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Last time I looked my math was correct, cant be exact all the time.

[23-Oct-18 02:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And out of curiosity, other than ripping off my post, why are *you* charging more for BTC?

[23-Oct-18 02:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
15 cents of KMD is 0.1161, not 0.11 😉

[23-Oct-18 02:57 AM] LoPhatMelk#9055
I just liked the format, and i was just messing around with the colors.

[23-Oct-18 02:57 AM] LoPhatMelk#9055
I'm just a little guy, why so much butthurt?

[23-Oct-18 02:59 AM] LoPhatMelk#9055
Aren't you charging more for BTC as well?

[23-Oct-18 02:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yeah, I can't imagine why I'd be upset that **every** ad I do, people start ripping off **the exact same format**

[23-Oct-18 02:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I charge more for BTC for a reason

[23-Oct-18 03:00 AM] LoPhatMelk#9055
transfer fees are higher for one no?

[23-Oct-18 03:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
No, because fees are on the buyer
I charge more because KMD trade takes <4 minutes, whereas BTC trade can take as long as an hr
My time has value

Well please dont send me a bill for taking up so much of your time....

Yea I'm not as cool as you and dont have mine scripted

[23-Oct-18 03:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mine's not scripted either (beyond the macros in my spreadsheet)

[23-Oct-18 03:05 AM] LoPhatMelk#9055
Ah ok, I figured maybe you had it scripted to delete the old and repost the new with updated values

[23-Oct-18 03:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, I manually change it when there's a significant market change in one or the other

[23-Oct-18 03:07 AM] LoPhatMelk#9055
Cool, yea I'll probably make up my own. I was just trying to poke the bear and see what happened, and it worked haha... As they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

[23-Oct-18 03:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I like punk rock TBH, it's probably my fave.   Grew up playing bass in various garage punk bands.   Nobody played bass, and everyone played drums and guitar so I was able to make the rounds.

[23-Oct-18 03:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
