@jl777c

[01-Nov-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but as soon as we verify that zdeposit and zwithdraw are working, they will activate trading

[01-Nov-18 01:56 PM] Flexatron#8809
exciting

[01-Nov-18 01:58 PM] Flexatron#8809
so you're saying deposits/withdraws are stable now?

[01-Nov-18 01:58 PM] Flexatron#8809
trying test deposit

[01-Nov-18 01:59 PM] Flexatron#8809
wallet looks enabled

[01-Nov-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
i have been working with their devs on how best to implement reliable zdeposit/zwithdraw, there is so little info even in the receiving wallet side,  it was a bit of a challenge. they did all the implementation and rather quickly considering the amount of work needed

[01-Nov-18 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so wallet is enabled, but trading disabled as it is still not proven other than to the test account. I think if we get enough reports of success on zdeposit and zwithdraw,then it is ok to enable trading

[01-Nov-18 02:03 PM] Flexatron#8809
loading chain then testing

[01-Nov-18 02:04 PM] zatJUM#9924
how do we report success/fail? Here?

[01-Nov-18 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, plz report any problems with zdeposit or zwithdraw

[01-Nov-18 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
