[29-Sep-18 09:16 AM] ch6ris#5240
So transaction history is blank (No history Avaliable) is that by design? Only incoming transactions to z address.

[29-Sep-18 09:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ch6ris what wallet and version are we talking about here?

Agama wallet.

[29-Sep-18 09:17 AM] ch6ris#5240
latest 42c

[29-Sep-18 09:18 AM] ch6ris#5240
I fucked around on the CLI creating the wallet though.

[29-Sep-18 09:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then if your history is totally blank and you had actual transactions, you have the wrong wallet.dat for the history you want to see

[29-Sep-18 09:19 AM] ch6ris#5240
hmm, thanks, I will try again and send my coins to a new wallet created with agama.

[29-Sep-18 09:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm loathe to suggest it, but maybe do a rescan?

[29-Sep-18 09:20 AM] ch6ris#5240
yeah maybe. coins are there just no transaction history.

[29-Sep-18 09:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then my best advice would be to run komodod manually and use `-zapwallettxes`

[29-Sep-18 09:21 AM] ch6ris#5240
Thank you Genie.

zap dumps the db and then does a rescan

[29-Sep-18 09:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbh, it's not that I think it's a "waste of time", I'm moving stuff around and in the middle of 4 z txes that are pegging my CPU

[29-Sep-18 10:00 AM] ch6ris#5240
yeah fair enough.

[29-Sep-18 10:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as I'm concerned, 1 KMD I make today is 1 more than I had yesterday

[29-Sep-18 10:00 AM] ch6ris#5240
I didn't get that vibe from you earlier today.

[29-Sep-18 10:00 AM] 💰KQweci🌟#6562
How much is pirate worth

[29-Sep-18 10:01 AM] ch6ris#5240
whatever people are paying ath i think was 0.095 - 0.1?

[29-Sep-18 10:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I didn't get that vibe from you earlier today.`
It was likely that at that point I had 10k in each z and didn't want to split it 5 minutes after I rolled out of bed

[29-Sep-18 10:08 AM] Flexatron#8809

who ever thought that there'd be an equihash assetchain with a diff 3x higher than KMD itself?

pirates talking about alcohol?

[29-Sep-18 10:15 AM] ch6ris#5240

[29-Sep-18 10:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`pirates talking about alcohol?` And not even rum 😕

Drinking before 10am makes you a pirate not an alcoholic.

[29-Sep-18 10:34 AM] LocoMB#8593
I cant seem to access it

[29-Sep-18 10:35 AM] 0x03#8822
i got rid of the `~/.agama` folder

[29-Sep-18 10:35 AM] 0x03#8822
and then it magically reappeared

[29-Sep-18 10:37 AM] ch6ris#5240
I still have the problem of no transaction history.

[29-Sep-18 10:37 AM] ch6ris#5240
tried rescan, tried zapwallettxes, tried deleting pirate folder and creating a new wallet.

[29-Sep-18 10:38 AM] ch6ris#5240
sent funds to newly created wallet, coins appear but no transaction history.

[29-Sep-18 10:40 AM] ghisote#2507
I would say that no transaction history is normal, as it is a z adres only blockchain ,but I´m not an expert ,may be someone can confirm.

[29-Sep-18 10:41 AM] LocoMB#8593
darn! didnt work for me

[29-Sep-18 10:42 AM] ch6ris#5240
that's what I first thought but apparently not, zec shows incoming transactions in the transaction history. can anyone else confirm if they have any history or not?

[29-Sep-18 10:44 AM] ch6ris#5240
Under Transaction History - No history available.  (Agama 0.2.42c)

[29-Sep-18 10:59 AM] ch6ris#5240
can anyone open agama? check if they have a transaction history? in or out?

just think of the poor bastids that got a fixed order yesterday to see standard orders now running at 1/2 the price

❓

[29-Sep-18 11:19 AM] 0x03#8822
btw, the price-down direction on NH seems to have a bug where you can easily trigger a new 500s waiting period but not lower the price

[29-Sep-18 11:20 AM] 0x03#8822
for that; from the order view; leave open the screen to adapt the price and hashrate.

meh.. my Agama still refuses to display most of the cons in native mode- including Pirate ..
I tried scrubbing it from my system and reisntalling, but didnt work

[29-Sep-18 12:07 PM] ch6ris#5240
any coin at all? that's strange. I only have no transaction history on PIRATE.

[29-Sep-18 12:07 PM] 0x03#8822
theres likely another place it loads stuff from where you didnt check yet (that would be what i would check for)

[29-Sep-18 12:07 PM] 0x03#8822
checkcheckcheck

[29-Sep-18 12:08 PM] 0x03#8822
likely because of 'if you kill the config and the behaviour doesnt change, it probably was the wrong place'

[29-Sep-18 12:08 PM] ch6ris#5240
Instead of reinstalling agama maybe you should clear the appdata/komodo folder

[29-Sep-18 12:09 PM] LocoMB#8593
yes probably..
