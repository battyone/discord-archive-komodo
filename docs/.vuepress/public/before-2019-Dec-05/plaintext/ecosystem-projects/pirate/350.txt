How long were you thinking to make it?

[28-Nov-18 08:14 PM] Strob#3417
I will also work on the script itself to speed up things. I think around 60 sec would be a good lenght like the monero one: https://getmonero.org/ I will use this asset pack to illustrate the script: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/historic/polygon-pirates-pack-92579

@Mr. HashEm see above for the other video makers assets.

[28-Nov-18 09:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Not sure what you had in mind but perhaps both videos using similar assets would be good.    @Strob will you link the smaller pirate asset pack too?  Maybe they would prefer that?

[28-Nov-18 09:22 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Does anyone know how to create a transparent address in the newer version of Agama?

[28-Nov-18 10:16 PM] Strob#3417
the smaller pirates are those one, they are part of a Fantasy Character Pack so they are only five. I could take the other pack character and just scale their head up and legs down to make them the same if needed. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/polygon-mini-fantasy-character-pack-122084

I downloaded the first pack and I just have to figurre out how to import them in my 3D package from unity. Then I will try to scale them to the more cartoony proportions.

@NutellaLicka You mean with other coin than Pirate? Pirate does not have transparent address. With other coin you just click Receive=>Get new address=>transparent address. (v0.2.44c)

[28-Nov-18 10:46 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
No I mean for Pirate. In Pirate you still have the ability to have a transparent address, you're just unable to send funds to anything but a Z address (no T -> T). Pools require a Taddr as coinbase is paid out in it. You can easily use CLI to do it, I am just asking for a friend as they're using windows and require a Taddr. Since Agama has updated, they took the option out for Pirate. I was asking if there were still ways to get one in Agama.

[28-Nov-18 10:47 PM] Strob#3417
Ok sorry I didn't know that. Thanks for the info.

[28-Nov-18 10:48 PM] Strob#3417
I mine without a taddress with a pool and it works so far.

[28-Nov-18 10:49 PM] Strob#3417
Do you mean if I use a transparent address intead I will make more with the coinbase?

[28-Nov-18 10:49 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
No worries. If you're pointing hash at a public pool (i.e https://minethepiratechain.black) you are required to use a Zaddr. If you run your own pool, or wish to create one, you need a Taddr to receive the funds. The pool software then shields these amounts in order to pay out to members who point their hash at the pool.

[28-Nov-18 10:50 PM] Strob#3417
Ok now I understand!

[28-Nov-18 10:50 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Glad I could clear that up üòÉ

[28-Nov-18 11:03 PM] Strob#3417
It's not too hard to change the proportions for the characters if needed. I did that one: https://i.imgur.com/Pigwu8p.png
