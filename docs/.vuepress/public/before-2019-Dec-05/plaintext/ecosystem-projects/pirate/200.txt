`Blue dildo difficulty line` only thing I can think of

[21-Oct-18 04:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you think that even remotely resembles a "dildo"....

[21-Oct-18 04:38 PM] bishop#9773
I don't

Today the first purchase of a real world item  (in part at least )with pirate was made.  Polycryptoblog paid 1000 pirate and 750 cash for a batch 1 z9mini and PSU. #Pirate #ARRR #PRIVACY @PirateChain @maxherbertwest @CowboyCrypto @Jacobstoon @Panama_TJ @CryptoNinjaa @Crypt...

I’d like to get into mining & figured ARRR would be a good fit! I currently have the option to purchase a new S9 from a friend. Would this be a good piece of equipment to mine pirate with?

[21-Oct-18 06:35 PM] RunningMantheCoin#7435
I’m a mining noob. This is a first for me so bare with me through the stupid questions!

[21-Oct-18 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
z9 not s9

[21-Oct-18 06:38 PM] RunningMantheCoin#7435
So I shouldn’t bother with the S9 if I want to mine pirate?

[21-Oct-18 06:39 PM] SHossain#0007
no. s9 will not work

[21-Oct-18 06:40 PM] RunningMantheCoin#7435
Glad I checked. Thanks

[21-Oct-18 06:44 PM] bishop#9773
Get a miner that does equihash, not sha256

[21-Oct-18 06:45 PM] RunningMantheCoin#7435
Dually noted

[21-Oct-18 06:45 PM] RunningMantheCoin#7435
Was just an opportunity that came up a cheap price. Figured I’d ask. Ill keep a lookout for an equihash miner

[21-Oct-18 07:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
5% increase.

[21-Oct-18 07:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Nearly 35% more KMD discord members in the last 3 weeks. 💪

[21-Oct-18 07:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I’d like to think pirate has to do with at least 25-% of that.

[21-Oct-18 07:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Thanks everyone.  Have a great day.

Pool donates

[21-Oct-18 07:38 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Pool donates.  Whales donate.   KMD received for onboarding goes towards marketing and buying more ARRR.

[21-Oct-18 07:38 PM] FishyGuts#5085
There’s a standing order for 100k chunks at a time for 0.1 KMD per

[21-Oct-18 07:38 PM] Voight#4922
@FishyGuts ok thnx. Glad to have this option since mining is not an option for me.

[21-Oct-18 07:39 PM] FishyGuts#5085
For example I sold 40k arrr to the onboarding for 0.0777 this month.

[21-Oct-18 07:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And price is 0.12 now so the spread goes towards marketing and more arrr

[21-Oct-18 08:34 PM] sclear#0274
Pirate tipbot is back. In expectation of the beefier server due to arrive tomorrow hopefully, I had to temporarily disable rains and soaks. Thanks for understanding

[21-Oct-18 08:41 PM] TonyL#3577

Is someone working on a webwallet so people don't need to dl agama?

[21-Oct-18 09:05 PM] AndrewK#3947
It's less secure, but better for casuals

[21-Oct-18 09:17 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
native you need to download blockchain anyway for Pirates

[21-Oct-18 09:17 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and Arrr is for security also

[21-Oct-18 09:21 PM] SHossain#0007
@AndrewK there will not be any web wallet for PIRATE. at least not until next year

we should have a % of Pirate go to a foundation fund to do stuff like creating web walet, etc.

@AndrewK is it not possible until we have sapling update. so, next year perhaps

[21-Oct-18 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
2-5 random users? that seems kinda odd

[21-Oct-18 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

What share/payment method is being used on the pools? anyone know?

[21-Oct-18 09:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
either prop or plns; prop is my guess

@Lordofwar  ^^

[21-Oct-18 10:03 PM] sclear#0274
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Yes indeed. The last soak tried to reach nearly 600 users

[21-Oct-18 10:03 PM] 0x03#8822
prop for my pool as well (arrr.pool-mining.xyz)

[21-Oct-18 10:03 PM] sclear#0274
The cannon does 2-5 random users with the entered amount, yeah

[21-Oct-18 10:04 PM] 0x03#8822
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 the option is pplnt, not s (sadly)

[21-Oct-18 10:15 PM] jl777c#5810
need to have a dedicated node that queues up ztx to send and decouple it from the tipbot node

[21-Oct-18 10:16 PM] jl777c#5810
sending is an async operation anyway, so the logic could be that once an opid is generated, it pretends that all is good

[21-Oct-18 10:25 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
is it possible to force a payout on the zz nomp pool?

sounds more like it should be called 'ftsm' (fek the small miners)

[21-Oct-18 10:57 PM] Waldemar#9727
hi, will it be profitable to mine pirate on dual xeon e5 2670 cpus?

[21-Oct-18 10:57 PM] jl777c#5810
unlikely, unless you have free electricity

[21-Oct-18 10:57 PM] jl777c#5810
VRSC is a better one for CPU mining
