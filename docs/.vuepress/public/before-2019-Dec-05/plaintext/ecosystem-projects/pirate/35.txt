@SHossain  any chance you wanna pin the logo message I added last night? Makes it easier to find the current submissions

net diff is why @Alright#0419 = :sob: using nh and I = :grin: using 500k local :trollface:`

For what you spend a year in rentals, you'd own 2-3x the miners I have 😣

that was a required update to fix notary sendtoaddress

[24-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Alright#0419
Oh hmmm, maybe give more than 12 hour notice?

[24-Sep-18 09:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
says the guy that once restarted a chain/daemon 3 times in 12 hrs 😂

[24-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Alright#0419
Did anyone lose money in that?

[24-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Flexatron#8809
If you mine to the pool you are fine right

[24-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Flexatron#8809

wow 20 cents per kwh

[24-Sep-18 09:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm paying just under 10 cents and happy even in the "down" market; if you can be out-of-pocket for a bit and hold, then I think you'll find a few to be worthwhile

[24-Sep-18 09:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the more you can buy the sooner is the more you'll get out of them; the more you buy later is the more everyone else has bought too

trying to figure out about how much money that just lost me

[24-Sep-18 09:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I hit a peerban wall about 600 blocks back iirc

[24-Sep-18 09:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and as far as what you lost, the answer is "Whatever you make minus whatever you spent"

[24-Sep-18 09:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can drive yourself mad with theoretical numbers, trust me I've been there

[24-Sep-18 09:24 PM] Alright#0419

[24-Sep-18 09:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unless you're dumping today, it's all bad math anyway

[24-Sep-18 09:31 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alright sorry for not giving you enough time. there was a specific tx in the mempool which wasn't being confirmed. we were at the edge of having a chain split. with few nodes updated quickly, we were good. still there was a small reorg.

[24-Sep-18 09:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_seems to recall a theory about how the tech shouldn't stop/slow to one miner and/or type of hardware :trollface:_

Pirate fomo is real

[24-Sep-18 09:35 PM] scubapanda#2485
Ok, I think I need to give up. Re-downloaded the chains enough times.. Neither of my nodes will go past height=36858. On Ubuntu it's "ERROR: CheckTransaction(): this is a private chain, no public allowed" and "ERROR: CheckBlock: CheckTransaction failed".

[24-Sep-18 09:35 PM] Flexatron#8809
The halving is very far away now tho

[24-Sep-18 09:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Neither of my nodes will go past height=36858`
@scubapanda are you sure you're on the newest build? That's about the spot I stopped with the old build

now, we need minimum 13 notary nodes to update

[24-Sep-18 09:51 PM] SHossain#0007
notarization didn't happen yet

[24-Sep-18 10:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
was checking price, 
if 1 PIRATE = 0.015 KMD
1 KMD price = 1.14 USD as per CMC
0.015 * 1.15 = 0.01725 USD is the current aprox price of a single PIRATE 🤔

[24-Sep-18 10:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
in case I didn't do it wrong... :p

[24-Sep-18 10:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
0.01725 USD = ~0.09 HUSH

I can sell all my WLC for PIRATE if anyone accepts :trollface:

[24-Sep-18 10:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I might have a million of WLC or something, don't remember....

[24-Sep-18 10:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
how much you can offer for a million WLC ?

[24-Sep-18 10:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
10k PIRATE ?

[24-Sep-18 10:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
🤔 I guess I don't have any WLC.... bought ZEC using them 😄

no 10.79233756 + 0.32249396 = 11.11483152 ZEC

[24-Sep-18 10:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[24-Sep-18 10:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I remember when some fools pumped WLC on craptopia last year and you dumped like a btc or half one I to their pump, rude ;) 😆

[24-Sep-18 10:21 PM] SHossain#0007
