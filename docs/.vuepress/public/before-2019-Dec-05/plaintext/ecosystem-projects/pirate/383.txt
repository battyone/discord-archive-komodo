[dscrd-prt] <Keppie> Just finished listening to Joe Rogan's podcast with Edward Snowden. Very interesting podcast. After hitting *Edward snowden cryptocurrency* into google, it tells me he is/was a fan of Zcash and that he thinks the only thing bitcoin is missing is privacy.

[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> not sure if having fun is celebration and even if it is if it is the same kind of celebration as all saints

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> not sure how my eating 197000 lbs of candy while being dressed like a hooker pirate is even remotely like celebrating the reverend dead üòú

[31-Oct-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> celebrating dead seems quite hipocritic to me; what I see people many times pretend(?)  to "care about dead" more then alive

[31-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> having fun with deat (haloween) got different role - trying to be acustomed to death which makes more sense as psychological goal, however it is ilusionary to me

[31-Oct-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <CHMEX> Its the commercia version of old habits

[31-Oct-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> btw regarding all saints (christian culture) you may find Jesus quote funny - the one where he said let alone dead people to care about those dead, sth like that / not sure in english

[31-Oct-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> christianity is many ways go against what Jesus actually said, but nobody questions that

[01-Nov-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptoon> I think arrr will be free to list on (gui) atomicdex, no? Just the integration into mm2.0 is a bit tricky

[01-Nov-19 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763

[01-Nov-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763

These people have no respect for anyone and now are stealing their users funds by introducing KYC out of the blue and having notified nobody in advance.

They ban and kick out or bully all the people that are complaining. These scammers have no place in our server and community. üëéüèº

[01-Nov-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `stealing their users funds by introducing KYC out of the blue`
I'm not sure that qualifies as "stealing" üòï

[01-Nov-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> it is though, why did they not alert anyone? Because they knew that many people would withdraw their funds

[01-Nov-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> now they will leave, with their wallets behind. What is CB going to do? At some point they will 'absorb' the dormant accounts

[01-Nov-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> For me that is stealing

[01-Nov-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> An honest person gives you a heads up. Does not say, hey, from today its KYC or F*** off

[01-Nov-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> Adding an additional step that you can get your funds back if you follow isn't "stealing", as you *can* get them (you just *choose* not to)

[01-Nov-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> I have left pennies at CB, this is not a personal vendetta, I am losing something like $0.50. I am outraged because these people think they can behave however they want.

I say we kick them out of here like they mistreat anyone who raises a valid concern.

Out of all people I thought you were going to back me on this one CG. Unless you became a fan of KYC and CB suddenly...

[01-Nov-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `I am outraged because these people think they can behave however they want.`
Because they can.
`Unless you became a fan of KYC and CB suddenly...`
You're confusing my correction of your understanding of banking and ownership with something that it is not.
`I say we kick them out of here like they mistreat anyone who raises a valid concern.`
imo, 3rd party transactions shouldn't be a "team" concern
I may be outweighed on this topic, but I feel (and always will) that the project has a duty to "warn" of "known" things (which I believe has been more than done in the case of CB), but to censure individuals for the practice of the enterprise is above and beyond (otherwise I'd have issue with a ton of Komodo folks over the revenue-centric direction of KomodoPlatform üòõ )
