@ronyi there is no text data "evidence" that you received a payment

[07-Oct-18 06:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's no evidence that a payment was even made

[07-Oct-18 06:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I know you're always right, but please look at it from another angle. I understand what you're talking about. I have been following this technology since the beginning(zec and xmr). if possible, say something I do not know. I think not even good send data in plain text. The data is the data. the whole technology to retain the data is the goal

[07-Oct-18 06:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
So that goes back to my original pool statements
a) don't mine
or
b) solo mine

[07-Oct-18 06:51 AM] ronyi#5719
a) ok
b) who wants to become a part of it wait more weeks one block is lucky?

Simple question for clarity ....
“If ox or web was suddenly raided by internet police ... would they be able to get my IP address and therefore my location ?”

[07-Oct-18 06:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`b) who wants to become a part of it wait more weeks one block is lucky?`
256 PIRATE a month is 256 PIRATE a month if you mine 1 block a month on your own or you join a pool (thus agreeing to divulge info) and get 8.53333333 per day

[07-Oct-18 06:54 AM] ronyi#5719
@house yes and your PIRATE address.

[07-Oct-18 06:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`“If ox or web was suddenly raided by internet police ... would they be able to get my IP address and therefore my location ?”`
Simple answer: if that is a concern for you, then don't do it

[07-Oct-18 06:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If there is "exposure" using a pool, you **choose** to add that in of your own free will.

[07-Oct-18 06:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no different than posting a pic on fb of you in front of a restaurant sign and saying "well how did you know where I was?"

[07-Oct-18 07:00 AM] ronyi#5719
I want to protect the miners, as far as possible. solo mining or no't mining is your all solution?! Okay and thank you, but I do not think the miners' defense is so resolved. the other question is whether or not it is necessary.

[07-Oct-18 07:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[07-Oct-18 07:03 AM] house#8741
Seems to me that pool operators carry a weight of responsibility ... if there comes a time that the PTB want to crack down on crypto.
I wonder if there is a way to create cookie-cutter type pool that any Joe Sixpack could launch independently

[07-Oct-18 07:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ronyi If you write and test the code to encrypt internet between you and your pool (which includes rewriting the closed-source code of the miners) I'd be willing to bet that miners and pool ops alike would be willing to implement it
Barring that, no one is going to sit down and devote thousands of manhours so that you can make 15 cents

[07-Oct-18 07:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm just as guilty as the next guy, but to be brutally honest, getting that level of "security" is impossible, we still don't even have 1 pool that doesn't look like this:

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 believe me I have much better professionals for this task...  is this your third solution now? there were only two before. I hope there will be more.
@house redis stored every share and payments.... on the one hand, is necessary. how long is it necessary to preserve it? After Paying x blocks? if we delete it to prove any mistake(example: hardware fail)?

[07-Oct-18 07:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`believe me I have much better professionals for this task..`
@ronyi then why are you not presenting us with working models or at least a PoC?

first I look for the theoretical best solution, after PoC.....

[07-Oct-18 07:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ronyi what I understand is that theory is meaningless unless you have someone to put it into practice. You say you have such peole, then do it.

the "theoretical best solution" is to not conflate your personal choices and anything having to do with the coin/protocol

[07-Oct-18 07:29 AM] ronyi#5719
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I decide what I do. which is good for me in this situation is good for the community as well.

[07-Oct-18 07:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You make a conscious choice to take 1/30th of x as payment daily rather than x as it comes (assuming hash to get 1 block per month on average)
When you make that choice, you willingly accept what comes with that choice
This is no different than if you decided to post your viewing key and then said "but people can see my transaction".... yes, they can' you gave them the key

[07-Oct-18 07:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Assuming one set all of that aside, what if all of the pool ops say "no, we don't want to add that code"?

[07-Oct-18 07:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

4. do I do nothing to sue?
5. what licence type....

So, as I said before, choose #3 make your pool and be happy

[07-Oct-18 07:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As for #5,  that was me being an ass and aimed at one of the pool ops

[07-Oct-18 07:45 AM] ronyi#5719
but I'm still on the original question I'm looking for no answer to that.

[07-Oct-18 07:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The answer to the original question is that if you don't want to be known then don't make yourself known

[07-Oct-18 07:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

`ZEN version 2.0.15 replaces ZEN 2.0.14 but it is by no means a hard fork.`
`Horizen warned that the ZEND Swing wallet will cease to function if an upgrade is not performed by 10th October and that miners and node operators will be unable to earn ZEN until they have upgraded to ZEN 2.0.15.`
OK, someone tell me how those sentences do not conflict?

IP correlation is indeed a privacy leak at a different layer, that is why Tor is supported

[07-Oct-18 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
probably cant pool mine via Tor...

[07-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Flexatron#8809
True

[07-Oct-18 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you are using rented hash, what exactly links the nicehash ip address to you?

[07-Oct-18 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
the BTC you send, ok, so that is an issue, you need post-jumblr BTC

[07-Oct-18 08:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
most, if not all, executable 200,9 miners lack tor support

[07-Oct-18 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
but the zaddress is NOT visible on the blockchain

[07-Oct-18 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
you can publish your zaddress on twitter, doesnt matter as long as you z_getoperationresult, it wipes all the send history from that zaddr

[07-Oct-18 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
on the receive side, all you have is the txid, amount and memo field

[07-Oct-18 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
no zaddr

[07-Oct-18 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, if you give access to your wallet, then they can tell that you own the zaddress, in that case if the counterpart who sent to your zaddress did not z_getoperationresult, then they could link that transaction

[07-Oct-18 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so basically if both your wallet and your counterpart's wallet are confiscated and the sender didnt z_getoperationresult, then can figure out what txid was sent from zaddr to zaddr

[07-Oct-18 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
mining via nicehash, the BTC you pay from is the biggest privacy leak

[07-Oct-18 08:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ronyi's issue was that there's text data sent between miner and pool that allows one to be identified as being a miner

[07-Oct-18 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
so it will become known that nicehash mines?

[07-Oct-18 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
if you have your own mining equipment, SOLO MINE

[07-Oct-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise your privacy is breached, as far as the mining pool knowing how much PIRATE you mined, however, there is nothing other than the amount of PIRATE mined that is knowable without confiscating all the wallets

[07-Oct-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
zaddr are NOT on the blockchain

maybe many people assume that zaddr are visible on the blockchain like taddr are. they are not

[07-Oct-18 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the way it works is that each node has a set of zaddr/privkey pairs in their wallet

[07-Oct-18 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
then for EVERY ztransaction, they try to decrypt it. if they can, it is a transaction for that wallet and it is processed

[07-Oct-18 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
so the zadddr exists in the blockchain only by being able to decrypt transactions encrypted to that zaddr

_ironically instantly distrusts anyone that feels the need to say "trust me I know...."_

just send from the zaddr that is public known to a new one

[07-Oct-18 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
preferably in a different wallet.dat

[07-Oct-18 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
that breaks any link, unless both your wallet.dat are confiscated. in such cases I suggest not to let all your wallet.dat get confiscated

[07-Oct-18 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
move out of australia?

[07-Oct-18 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is true that at the boundary of PIRATE, there are potentially some small leaks of privacy that can be obtained via non-blockchain means + wallet.dat confiscation
