Pirate pool.io is not offline.  It is active - We just took it off the main pirate site to encourage hashrate spread.

[09-Nov-18 11:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
Can you miner ARRR directly to digitalprice  exchange?

[09-Nov-18 11:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
mine*

[09-Nov-18 11:36 PM] crumb#2550
no

[09-Nov-18 11:36 PM] crumb#2550
DO NOT mine directly into exchange address

[09-Nov-18 11:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
why not?

[09-Nov-18 11:36 PM] crumb#2550

Why does the diff go to 6000000 then to 260000000 then back to 600000000 all the time

So its not like mining  Zencash directly to a binance Address?

[09-Nov-18 11:40 PM] crumb#2550
yes, CG completely unheard of. owning their own money. sheeesshhh :trollface:

[09-Nov-18 11:41 PM] crumb#2550
you should not mine any token directly into exchange addresses

[09-Nov-18 11:41 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
@Deleted User shouldn't reply mine to any exchange what if something was to go wrong it will only be your loss

[09-Nov-18 11:41 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
Really**

[09-Nov-18 11:41 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@stephenleeholmes118 diff is what controls the rate of block finds and maintains the 1 minute average

[09-Nov-18 11:41 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
faster blocks= diff goes up

[09-Nov-18 11:41 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
slower blocks = diff goes down

[09-Nov-18 11:42 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
So can we not just have slow blocks according to the calculations my miner mines more on slow block üòÇüòÇüòÇ

being mining Zen to binance for over 2 months.....never misses a beat

[09-Nov-18 11:44 PM] crumb#2550
binance is just taking the abuse. it doesn't mean that they are really happy with the situation

[09-Nov-18 11:45 PM] crumb#2550
it does not matter which exchange or which token we are talking about. mining directly to exchange address is a BAD IDEA @Deleted User

[09-Nov-18 11:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
So if I mine Arrr to a wallet ,  the send a few Arrr at a time to digitalprice exchange, thats ok?

[09-Nov-18 11:46 PM] crumb#2550
yes. first to your own wallet and then transfer from there to exchange

[09-Nov-18 11:48 PM] crumb#2550
also with ARRR you should consolidate your UTXO-s with
komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_mergetoaddress '["*"]' zcYourPirateAddress

[09-Nov-18 11:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know many  mining Zen to Binance and none have ever had a problem.......I guess everyone has their own opinion .

[09-Nov-18 11:49 PM] crumb#2550
daily or so. otherwise your transfers could take a lot of time. z-transactions are resource heavy

[09-Nov-18 11:49 PM] crumb#2550
it's not an opinion for god's sake

[09-Nov-18 11:50 PM] crumb#2550
if you had to ask what an UTXO is, perhaps you should realise that you have some things to learn still?

[09-Nov-18 11:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
you are right

[09-Nov-18 11:50 PM] crumb#2550
i don't know most stuff still

[09-Nov-18 11:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
I do what works for me

[09-Nov-18 11:51 PM] crumb#2550
like i said. binance just took the abuse

[09-Nov-18 11:51 PM] crumb#2550
what you did was not a good idea

[09-Nov-18 11:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
@crumb is there a way to consolidate in agama? or is that not required?

[09-Nov-18 11:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Tell me what......also with ARRR you should consolidate your UTXO-s with
komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_mergetoaddress '["*"]' zcYourPirateAddress......Means?

[09-Nov-18 11:53 PM] crumb#2550
you can use that same command i listed above also in agama, but i'm using CLI

[09-Nov-18 11:53 PM] crumb#2550
you run that command to consolidate your ARRR @Deleted User

[09-Nov-18 11:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thats above my pay grade

[09-Nov-18 11:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
thanks!

[09-Nov-18 11:54 PM] crumb#2550
it's not that difficult. if you want to take mining seriously it pays off to learn new stuff

[09-Nov-18 11:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Desk top wallet like exodus works great for me

[09-Nov-18 11:55 PM] crumb#2550
