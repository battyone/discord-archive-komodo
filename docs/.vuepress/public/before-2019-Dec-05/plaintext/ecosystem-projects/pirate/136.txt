not likely

[07-Oct-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
debit cards involve fiat, which involves govts, which involves disclosure, which defeats the point of pirate

[07-Oct-18 02:04 PM] mato121#5963

This is a moment where I don’t want to get in over my head and make a mistake.

[07-Oct-18 02:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@blackjok3r or @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 or maybe @jl777c - any of you folks want to talk to him?

[07-Oct-18 02:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We got the fish on the line now we need an experienced angler. 

I don’t mind opening the door to talk but I want to make sure everyone’s ok with it.

[07-Oct-18 02:46 PM] mato121#5963
i vote fore j777c 😄

[07-Oct-18 02:46 PM] actionslacks#4072
I’m sure his lackey fields all kinds of crazy shit. Most likely he’s gonna hit you up for an endorsement fee before he does anything.

[07-Oct-18 02:46 PM] mato121#5963
yep

[07-Oct-18 02:47 PM] mato121#5963
he wont be chep

[07-Oct-18 02:47 PM] mato121#5963

[07-Oct-18 02:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I’ll see what they say.  👍

[07-Oct-18 02:47 PM] mato121#5963
👌

[07-Oct-18 02:48 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I think just assessing the situation will be a good start to see what he wants in exchange

[07-Oct-18 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
he will ask for $100,000

well then no, we don't need that type of marketing then..

[07-Oct-18 02:55 PM] Buddz1993#5380
better use those funds for something else that adds even more value to this ecosystem.

[07-Oct-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
in last 1000 blocks, 998 are above 100 MSol

[07-Oct-18 02:55 PM] Buddz1993#5380
which I mean its being done anyway

[07-Oct-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
we were above 150 Msol for a bit

[07-Oct-18 02:56 PM] Buddz1993#5380
wow

[07-Oct-18 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
within striking distance of ZEN, which was as low as 160MH recently, but up to 200 now

[07-Oct-18 02:56 PM] bishop#9773
Did I hear Vosk was doing a video specific to ARRR?

[07-Oct-18 02:56 PM] Buddz1993#5380
with this rate we will surpass it lol

[07-Oct-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont remember a single day of less hash than the previous in the last 2 weeks+

[07-Oct-18 02:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
My email@to Mac if anything... will let him know we’re a serious privacy player.   Maybe he throws 50BTC at buying some pirate 😆

[07-Oct-18 02:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I will not pay him to shill our shit.

[07-Oct-18 02:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
He gave me enough exposure responding in our thread. 😆

[07-Oct-18 03:01 PM] Buddz1993#5380
@FishyGuts  Indeed ahah

[07-Oct-18 03:02 PM] actionslacks#4072
Props for the hustle @FishyGuts

[07-Oct-18 03:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Sometimes it is just about planting a seed.

[07-Oct-18 03:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You plant it and you water it and you nurture it and one day... you’ll have a bush.

[07-Oct-18 03:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That bush is pretty but it still needs care and nurture and love for that bush to bear fruit.

[07-Oct-18 03:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Any help the community provides in these forums for information and discussion, is just more water... more fertilizer and more light for that bush.

[07-Oct-18 03:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I’ve seen more and more of you posting and mentioning pirate.   It’s tough for me to stay on top of.

[07-Oct-18 03:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The community helps a lot.   In addition, I am building a multilingual armada of Twitter pirates to help me with this.

[07-Oct-18 03:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We will have 5-6 Pirate ships captained by speaker of many tongues, sailing the twitter seas all with a common message and goal.

[07-Oct-18 03:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If any diplomatic and knowledgeable people want to apply to sail a ship, send me a DM.  
 It requires diplomacy, and an ability to discuss protocol in a fashion that non-pirates will understand.   It requires recognizing opportunity and seizing it.   Sharing your conquests inhere will help broaden their reach.   


Let’s build this armada!

[07-Oct-18 03:09 PM] mato121#5963
that was well written☺

[07-Oct-18 03:10 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Nice speech man !

[07-Oct-18 03:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You all engaging on twitter and across forums is encouraging.  It makes me want to work even harder.... because I know collectively, all of you are more powerful than I could be myself....  you are fantastic first mates.

"Total" chart looks weird

[07-Oct-18 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
doubled in 4000 blocks

[07-Oct-18 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty crazy

[07-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Flexatron#8809
Haha yup

[07-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Flexatron#8809
But starts at 47K in my browser

[07-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Flexatron#8809
Would like see earlier than that as well

[07-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Flexatron#8809
:)

[07-Oct-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
data wasnt being captured is my guess

[07-Oct-18 03:45 PM] Flexatron#8809
Hmm think I have seen something tho

[07-Oct-18 03:45 PM] Flexatron#8809
Someone posted a chart before

[07-Oct-18 03:46 PM] Flexatron#8809
Onboarding now 0.23, otc 0.25 mostly

[07-Oct-18 03:48 PM] jspook16#3059
Onboarding dropped?

[07-Oct-18 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
since nobody was selling to chmex, and more PIRATE is always needed for onboarding

[07-Oct-18 03:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
*nobody* ? 🤔

[07-Oct-18 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
well not enough to meet demand

[07-Oct-18 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then he should have asked for more coins 😛

[07-Oct-18 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
I suggested that the onboarding starts mining and offer small amounts at close to cost.

{Reactions}
☝ (2) 

[07-Oct-18 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
that creates a closed loop and a good entry price for onboarding

[07-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Flexatron#8809
Dont know any other coin that does onboarding btw

[07-Oct-18 03:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in the interest of straight records and all that
While I know the revenue is intended for marketing and etc, a 24% markdown shoulda helped funding and I can only think of 1 time in the last week that shortage would have been an issue

[07-Oct-18 03:58 PM] house#8741
Wouldn't that end up being counterproductive to the price KMD ?
Not to mention that it could potentially destroy the otc market

[07-Oct-18 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
moving forward, we need a system in place that can onboard 100,000+

[07-Oct-18 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
limited volumes

[07-Oct-18 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
built in marketing incentives

[07-Oct-18 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
and the onboarding price will necessarily following costs

[07-Oct-18 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
which most early stage PoW coins track anyway

[07-Oct-18 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Wouldn't that end up being counterproductive to the price KMD ? Not to mention that it could potentially destroy the otc market`
you  talking about the closed loop or the markdown?

[07-Oct-18 04:00 PM] house#8741
`onboarding starts mining and offer small amounts at close to cost.`

[07-Oct-18 04:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
key being "small amounts"

[07-Oct-18 04:00 PM] house#8741
small amounts with 100,000 people adds up

[07-Oct-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
that amount cant be mined by a single miner

[07-Oct-18 04:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`small amounts with 100,000 people adds up`
well, it's not like it's 100k ppl per day

[07-Oct-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so the volumes will be capped

[07-Oct-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
for now the more pirates the better

[07-Oct-18 04:01 PM] house#8741
I guess if it's for an interim period it makes sence, but I fear that if it becomes an expected norm their could be trouble

[07-Oct-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it wont be forever

[07-Oct-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
and if the hashrate doesnt go up significantly, the price wont either

[07-Oct-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
onboading site wont change that at all

[07-Oct-18 04:03 PM] house#8741
cool, just adding my 2c  for consideration

[07-Oct-18 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
in some small sense it will reduce the price, but it brings in more people, creates more hashrate which boosts the price

[07-Oct-18 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
my assessment is that it is a big net positive

[07-Oct-18 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
even if it has a small negative effect
