I think this is the year for them

[12-Nov-18 11:41 AM] Godballz#9524
As silly as it is to say something like that I feel like it's been a long time coming and there are a lot of projects that only prove its worth

[12-Nov-18 11:42 AM] Godballz#9524
But as far as pirate goes- I don't know who that is interested in privacy wouldn't want to pick pirate especially one sapling is activated there will be no denying its superiority

[12-Nov-18 11:42 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[12-Nov-18 12:11 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
You gotta click "add coin" and type in "pirate. Is the agama wallet for Pirate the same as version for KMD?

[12-Nov-18 12:11 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Or "activate coin" maybe.
