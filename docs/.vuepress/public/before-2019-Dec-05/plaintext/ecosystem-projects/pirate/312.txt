[14-Nov-18 02:20 PM] Strob#3417
Is there anyone using Agama who could explain why I am seeing only N/A in the time column in the transaction history please? I can't see easily if I got my shares from the pool today for example.

[14-Nov-18 02:23 PM] Oszy#5734
Because pirate

[14-Nov-18 02:29 PM] Flexatron#8809
Lol

[14-Nov-18 02:45 PM] Strob#3417
Ok iT's so private that we can't even see if when we receive something?

[14-Nov-18 02:46 PM] Strob#3417
In fact I can see the date when I click Tx detail but I  can't sort them all by date.

good afternoon!!! I have been mining pirate for 3 weeks at: piratepool.io. Do you recommend some other more profitable pool? Thanks a lot pirates !!

[14-Nov-18 03:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
all pools are profitable on average

[14-Nov-18 03:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
we have a contest running where 1 miner will be selected randomly from each pool on a weekly basis

[14-Nov-18 03:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
so less miners on a pool, more chances are to win

[14-Nov-18 03:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
as per the stats above

[14-Nov-18 03:10 PM] Jpscoin#4755
Where can I see the winners? 😬

[14-Nov-18 03:15 PM] Jpscoin#4755
thank you!!! I read the bases of the contest yesterday ... I've been following the project for 4 weeks and despite not participating much ... I read everything I can on televram to be updated.

@Strob i think you are using an old Agamavert

[14-Nov-18 03:26 PM] Strob#3417
I have 0.2.43d-beta

[14-Nov-18 03:27 PM] Acura#2748
Normally you should see an Transactionhistory on Pirate inside Agama.

[14-Nov-18 03:28 PM] Strob#3417
I see the transaction history but in the time column, everything is N/A

[14-Nov-18 03:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@Strob  @Acura  I requested change to show incoming z tx in Agama. Not sure they already got it? Also it will probably be a local file only (so if you sign in on different machine you won't see it I think). For sure doable to see in Agama z tx incoming and outgoing logged in local file.

[14-Nov-18 03:32 PM] Strob#3417
@passcombo.com  @Acura I see the incoming transactions but I can't sort them by time, they appear in random order.

[14-Nov-18 03:37 PM] blubbi#0643
jep thats normal

[14-Nov-18 03:55 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@mrlynch it's only the 5 pools listed in the article.

[14-Nov-18 04:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Oh wtf?

[14-Nov-18 04:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Wake up to that ?  Ouch

[14-Nov-18 04:41 PM] wookie#7663
I just learned that messages can be encrypted into the blockchain (you can I'm non-technical), is it possible then to tag along encrypted completely private messaging into pirate's chain? just a thought.

[14-Nov-18 04:41 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
ARRR halves may 2019 ...is that correct?

[14-Nov-18 04:43 PM] wookie#7663
@Deleted User I know there are numerous iterations of private messaging blockchains out there, just about every chain has one. Since we're the most private of all, that would also make pirate's messaging the most private messaging service in the industry. I just saw that xzc's blockchain was used for elections in thailand, just wondering about other things that can be encrypted onto pirate.

[14-Nov-18 04:45 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
especially when its said by Captain_Jack  ARRR!!!

[14-Nov-18 04:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Cryptofist so which pools are participating?

[14-Nov-18 04:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'll take out the rest

[14-Nov-18 04:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
one of them is giving me headaches anyway... they're not always available to my api requests 😭

Hello

[14-Nov-18 05:41 PM] dokrates#8987
I withdraw 2 big amounts from digitalprice in 2 txid

{Reactions}
treasure 

[14-Nov-18 05:41 PM] dokrates#8987
it shows as completed, but the txid shows "..."

[14-Nov-18 05:41 PM] dokrates#8987
anyone knows what happens?

[14-Nov-18 05:41 PM] dokrates#8987
i wrote a ticket

[14-Nov-18 05:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
They batch withdrawls.   It can take up to an hour.

[14-Nov-18 05:46 PM] dokrates#8987
oh thank you very much @FishyGuts

[14-Nov-18 05:46 PM] dokrates#8987
I was a little nervous

[14-Nov-18 05:46 PM] dokrates#8987
I invested seriously on it

[14-Nov-18 05:46 PM] dokrates#8987
and wanted to withdraw and keep them for long time

[14-Nov-18 05:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Always best to do small test batches when trying a new exchange, wallet or service.

[14-Nov-18 05:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
My first deposit and withdraw was only 10 Pirate and 1 KMD.

[14-Nov-18 05:47 PM] dokrates#8987
I did with 100, later 1000

[14-Nov-18 05:47 PM] dokrates#8987
and i have in my agama wallet

[14-Nov-18 05:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
👍

[14-Nov-18 05:47 PM] dokrates#8987
then i did a big withdraw

[14-Nov-18 05:47 PM] dokrates#8987
and another

[14-Nov-18 05:47 PM] dokrates#8987
but don't see the txid since half hour

[14-Nov-18 05:47 PM] dokrates#8987
also nothing in my agama wallet

[14-Nov-18 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the bigger the transfer, the longer it will take

[14-Nov-18 05:48 PM] dokrates#8987
Also its a little annoying to move wallet.dat to an encrypted drive each time i want to interact with the komodo coins and pirate coins

[14-Nov-18 05:48 PM] dokrates#8987
i don't know the reason, but it hasn't encryption

[14-Nov-18 05:49 PM] dokrates#8987
@jl777c do you know if there is any eta for encryption or at least security in  the wallet?

[14-Nov-18 05:50 PM] dokrates#8987
Also i must say this stuff of claim in the agama wallet with komodo is amazing, looks like cold staking

[14-Nov-18 05:50 PM] dokrates#8987
very well done

[14-Nov-18 05:50 PM] dokrates#8987
i really like komodo project and also pirate

[14-Nov-18 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
do you like to know when you receive PIRATE?

[14-Nov-18 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if so, you need to have your wallet unlocked anyway, as all ztx are encrypted and you need the privkey to decrypt it, or to try to in order to see if it was meant for you

[14-Nov-18 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
to use PIRATE is to be decrypting with the privkey all the time.

[14-Nov-18 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is a way in sapling to use viewing keys, but this is not a simple matter to just reenable wallet encryption. zaddrs are totally different than taddr

[14-Nov-18 06:27 PM] dokrates#8987
The coins have arrived 😄

[14-Nov-18 06:27 PM] dokrates#8987
but i have tons of txid

[14-Nov-18 06:27 PM] dokrates#8987
they sent me in txid of 1000

[14-Nov-18 06:27 PM] dokrates#8987
😅

[14-Nov-18 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
z_mergetoaddress is your friend

[14-Nov-18 06:30 PM] dokrates#8987
heheh im an ignorant☺

[14-Nov-18 06:30 PM] dokrates#8987
i can close the wallet and forgot them for 1 year

[14-Nov-18 06:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
What is the wallet command to pull up a list of my transactrions?

[14-Nov-18 06:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I enter it into the CLI yes?  THank you in advance

[14-Nov-18 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
z_listreceivedbyaddress zaddr

[14-Nov-18 06:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
DOes that pull up sends also?

[14-Nov-18 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
there actually isnt a really good way to do sends...

[14-Nov-18 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
you can get a list of opids, but that is reset each time you restart the komodod

[14-Nov-18 06:35 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Hmmm. So short of saving my info, there isn't a solid way to track sends privately if the wallet is closed?

[14-Nov-18 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
I am working with miket to have a way, but the zero knowledge is very zero, even for the sender

[14-Nov-18 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
z_listoperationids

[14-Nov-18 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe that will have opids from past instances

[14-Nov-18 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be good to have a log of sent txids... but not having it makes it easy to deny that you sent it

[14-Nov-18 06:59 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
thoughts on market drop?  BCH effects or something else?

[14-Nov-18 07:00 PM] Flexatron#8809
what goes up must go down

[14-Nov-18 07:00 PM] Flexatron#8809
before it goes up

[14-Nov-18 07:01 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
agree...I just picked up what I think was the dip...but we'll see...I think its volatility due to BCC dumping pre fork...but was curious for other perspectives

[14-Nov-18 07:11 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@mrlynch seems you figured it out! Sorry, been working this morning.

[14-Nov-18 07:14 PM] Cryptofist#7504
