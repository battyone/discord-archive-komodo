so adding dpow -> increase of mining -> increase of diff -> increase of value

[02-Oct-18 08:59 PM] Llama#1330
@Buddz1993 I think so, but don’t mark my words

[02-Oct-18 09:00 PM] Llama#1330
I think there is 25k being given out

[02-Oct-18 09:08 PM] KNOX#9338
Any brave Pirate out there to test these freshly baked binaries in Linux, macOS and Windows to run PIRATE chain?

[02-Oct-18 09:10 PM] jorian#4555
PirateNetwork also hosts the website

[02-Oct-18 09:11 PM] KNOX#9338
@Deleted User Yes. They are from the official organization repo.

[02-Oct-18 09:12 PM] jorian#4555
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 how much higher is PIRATE diff compared to KMD?

[02-Oct-18 09:12 PM] jorian#4555
what ratio?

[02-Oct-18 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only ~ 2.4x because NH is retarded

[02-Oct-18 09:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
3 people with "standard" 10M limits, the one paying the least has the most hash at 14M, and the one paying the most has 9M

[02-Oct-18 09:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@FishyGuts will be proud

[02-Oct-18 09:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jorian 3.01x now

[02-Oct-18 09:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and rising

[02-Oct-18 09:24 PM] jorian#4555
w00t. nice. would be nice if the chart @CHMEX made could be made available online

[02-Oct-18 09:26 PM] CHMEX#0686
and maybe 2 datapoints so PIRATE and KMD just to compare (ZEC?)

[02-Oct-18 09:27 PM] scubapanda#2485
Ten block average at 48716 was 154m  hashps. Nice.

[02-Oct-18 09:32 PM] jorian#4555
even better

[02-Oct-18 09:56 PM] Llama#1330
how can i calculate how much I'll mine

[02-Oct-18 09:56 PM] Flexatron#8809
With a calculator:trollface:

{Reactions}
🤣 😂 

[02-Oct-18 09:59 PM] scubapanda#2485
What is your hashrate?

[02-Oct-18 10:00 PM] Llama#1330
10 ksol/s

[02-Oct-18 10:01 PM] Flexatron#8809
Piratepool just crossed 100 workers👌

[02-Oct-18 10:04 PM] scubapanda#2485
Daily hashrate average (?) is now around 40 million . Divide your hashrate with that and multiply with block rewards (about 360k).

[02-Oct-18 10:05 PM] scubapanda#2485
=100 PIRATE/day?

[02-Oct-18 10:05 PM] Flexatron#8809
+add your hashrate

[02-Oct-18 10:05 PM] Llama#1330
Is nicehash profitable?

[02-Oct-18 10:06 PM] jl777c#5810
nicehash makes a lot of money

[02-Oct-18 10:06 PM] Llama#1330
for me or for the company? lol

[02-Oct-18 10:06 PM] jl777c#5810
for nicehash of course

[02-Oct-18 10:06 PM] Llama#1330
rip

[02-Oct-18 10:07 PM] scubapanda#2485
Any idea how much is Nicehash profit margin/hash?

[02-Oct-18 10:08 PM] SHossain#0007
@KNOX Tested the Linux and macOS binary with fresh sync. No issues. Anyone wants to finish the Windows test?

[02-Oct-18 10:08 PM] jl777c#5810
cost seems to be around 10 cents, maybe a bit less or more depending on nethash

[02-Oct-18 10:08 PM] Llama#1330
well I can rent 1 MH for a day for 0.0634 BTC. With that I would mine about 0.13

[02-Oct-18 10:08 PM] Llama#1330
according to your calculations

[02-Oct-18 10:09 PM] scubapanda#2485
@jl777c I meant Nicehash profit % buing in and selling out. Is it 10% or more?

[02-Oct-18 10:10 PM] jl777c#5810
depends on many variables, but yes, 10% profit seems attainable

[02-Oct-18 10:10 PM] jl777c#5810
unless the hashrate goes way up

[02-Oct-18 10:10 PM] scubapanda#2485
Good business for them 😃

[02-Oct-18 10:13 PM] Llama#1330
I might have to test nicehash out

[02-Oct-18 10:14 PM] scubapanda#2485
Happy hunting! 😃

[02-Oct-18 10:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I might have to test nicehash out`
Start small and learn all of the system

[02-Oct-18 10:22 PM] Llama#1330
yeah for sure. It's not like I'd have enough money to start large anyways 😛

[02-Oct-18 10:28 PM] Llama#1330
should i generate a transparent address for mining into?

[02-Oct-18 10:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only if you're solo-mining

[02-Oct-18 10:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
otherwise it'll be unusable

[02-Oct-18 10:34 PM] Llama#1330
ok

[02-Oct-18 10:52 PM] Llama#1330
alright here goes my first nicehash test.

[02-Oct-18 10:52 PM] Llama#1330
Let's get it./

did you get NH to accept a run of 0.06 for 1m?

[02-Oct-18 11:37 PM] Llama#1330
@Dr Debt yeah but only 0.1 msol/s

[03-Oct-18 12:02 AM] Llama#1330
one of the things I'm confused about is that I limit it at 0.1msol/s but sometimes it runs at double that...

[03-Oct-18 02:27 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Just to clarify - the 77.7 Pirate will be paid out after the contest ends.   


Also, it appears some people are putting Pirate addresses that begin with S ?   Not sure where that comes from but all pirate addresses will begin with z, right?

[03-Oct-18 02:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes

[03-Oct-18 02:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
zc

[03-Oct-18 02:59 AM] rrrj288#7865
@FishyGuts  'S' maybe their privkey..

[03-Oct-18 03:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Damn.    “With great power comes great responsibility.”

[03-Oct-18 03:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Will email them direct.

[03-Oct-18 03:05 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I can’t send to a privkey can I? The 77.7 pirate?

[03-Oct-18 03:14 AM] bishop#9773
someone sent in their privkey?!

[03-Oct-18 03:14 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Hold on what’s up with 77.7 pirate?

[03-Oct-18 03:15 AM] bishop#9773
twitter contest I think

[03-Oct-18 03:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I can’t send to a privkey can I?`
no, but you can own anything sent to the addy thats owned by that key :trollface:

[03-Oct-18 03:54 AM] Flexatron#8809
Lmao

[03-Oct-18 04:16 AM] Mylo#8306
No.  And nobody share privkey with anyone ever ❗

[03-Oct-18 04:16 AM] Mylo#8306
And purchasing wallet.dat files is also a no-no.

[03-Oct-18 04:18 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@FishyGuts 

I'm a bit behind - where are people sharing their privkeys?

We need to stop this asap.

[03-Oct-18 04:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Bryan_Beus Of course.  It was an accident by someone entering the contest.   They are supposed to send the zaddress
I Was looking thorugh the entrants addresses and I saw one with an S not a z.

{Reactions}
👍 

[03-Oct-18 04:26 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I am emailing them to let them know I have destroyued their entry and they will need to re-enter the contest properly.

[03-Oct-18 04:26 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I have 39 zaddresses and one S address.

[03-Oct-18 04:27 AM] FishyGuts#5085
🤦

[03-Oct-18 04:27 AM] Dr Debt#0891
I need to enter it lol

[03-Oct-18 04:51 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, I'm glad to hear it's just an isolated incident.

[03-Oct-18 04:58 AM] Flexatron#8809
Anyone has a recent dump of the pirate chain?

[03-Oct-18 04:59 AM] Flexatron#8809
Syncing and downloading is awfully slow at my laptop

[03-Oct-18 04:59 AM] Flexatron#8809
@0x03  I remember you had one from vrsc

[03-Oct-18 05:00 AM] Dr Debt#0891
if everyone could quit mining for 3-4 days I could make a lot of pirate 😂😂😂

[03-Oct-18 05:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you pay me what I make in 4 days, then I'll stop mining for 4 days :trollface:

[03-Oct-18 05:24 AM] Dr Debt#0891

[03-Oct-18 05:32 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
if you guys could just give me 1 mil pirate for free , It's all  for marketing , I promise :trollface:

[03-Oct-18 05:34 AM] Dr Debt#0891
My concrete recipe we will be building with does float... just sayin

[03-Oct-18 05:36 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
then I will need another mil PIRATE :trollface:  in my pocket

[03-Oct-18 05:37 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Electronics and the open seas are a recipe for disaster!

[03-Oct-18 05:37 AM] Dr Debt#0891
That would be something awesome to make though...
