Will my kmd litemode work if i still have kmd native in agama

[11-Nov-18 07:59 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes litemode works even if you have a native synced.
Look at litemode as a 'website' that you run on your PC

[11-Nov-18 08:01 AM] plazma#1625
Can i access my wallet in litemode even in native mode @CHMEX

[11-Nov-18 08:01 AM] plazma#1625
example i have low net

[11-Nov-18 08:02 AM] plazma#1625
So i use litemode kmd but no z address

[11-Nov-18 08:02 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes litemode only works with t addresses no zaddresses on litemode

[11-Nov-18 08:02 AM] plazma#1625
Then i switch to native and use z address

[11-Nov-18 08:05 AM] plazma#1625
@CHMEX i m using native i got wallets jumbler import key (jumbler new i dint saw in pirate)

[11-Nov-18 08:06 AM] kaks#6612

[11-Nov-18 08:06 AM] plazma#1625

@plazma Ok than it looks like something is strange. You can ask in #support  or open a Ticket on komodoplatform.com they are very fast to answer and they most likely know how to solve your issue fast.

[11-Nov-18 08:08 AM] kaks#6612
@ronyi  thanks 😊

[11-Nov-18 08:09 AM] plazma#1625

@FishyGuts do we have a ref link for crex yet? Want to take advantage of the early bird dumpers 😂

[11-Nov-18 09:07 AM] mrlynch#5735

are we listed there @FishyGuts ?

[11-Nov-18 09:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Not yet @Dr4gonTrader but we want people to use that ref link.
@mrlynch is right in asking early.  I am sure people are signing up.

[11-Nov-18 09:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I have different ones for Discord, Website and Twitter.

[11-Nov-18 09:15 AM] Dr4gonTrader#6152
ok, noted, thanks.  Will go sign up with that link.  Anything to help out

[11-Nov-18 09:17 AM] mrlynch#5735
All signed up :D now we wait...

[11-Nov-18 09:17 AM] mrlynch#5735
Is it true crex doesn't want id verification?

[11-Nov-18 09:17 AM] mrlynch#5735
Where are they based?

[11-Nov-18 09:18 AM] FishyGuts#5085
0.00014707 BTC made on DigPri so far through affiliates.

[11-Nov-18 09:18 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Crex has no KYC.

Sweet!

[11-Nov-18 09:22 AM] mrlynch#5735
Keeping the pirate private. Not that it bothers me. I'm not into nefarious biz but is sure not nice when coinbase gets into my life

[11-Nov-18 09:27 AM] FishyGuts#5085
At some point we will have to hit exchanges with KYC options.

Is anyone still having issues with Polly? Was going to fire up mining  again.

[11-Nov-18 09:34 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Looks like I’m hashing.  Haven’t checked for blocks.

[11-Nov-18 09:37 AM] actionslacks#4072
So crex this week?

[11-Nov-18 09:41 AM] plazma#1625
Wow nice vid

[11-Nov-18 10:16 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The video does an ok job I think of discussing privacy, pirate and general Komodo stuff.  It was my first ever interview and I was still a greengill.

[11-Nov-18 10:16 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Crex maybe next week...  based on where they are at and where digpri was at the same point.

[11-Nov-18 10:17 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I still don’t even know if they can.   They are much less communicative than DigitalPrice.   Maybe because they have a bigger team and can handle the issues that they are encountering.

[11-Nov-18 02:42 PM] Bradbury#7249
@stephenleeholmes118  umm didn't this happen a couple of days ago. All got sorted in the end. see if anyone else having issues

[11-Nov-18 02:44 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
No the other day I just had a massive build up of immature that panned out but now I have 0 immature and bal 19 and it's been like that for a little bit now

[11-Nov-18 02:47 PM] Bradbury#7249
my balance has not changed either. Not sure how often it updates as I don't look at it much

[11-Nov-18 02:48 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
Do you have immature as well or does that say 0

[11-Nov-18 02:48 PM] Bradbury#7249
0 as well

[11-Nov-18 02:49 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
Well as I see it immature is a build up of what you have mined then it goes over to ballence but as it looks to me I haven't mined anything and with yours saying 0 you havnt 😂 who owns the pool

[11-Nov-18 02:50 PM] Bradbury#7249

`We needed a big 'ole "WhaleBro" to come in a set a foor on this price action.`
They are already taking action under the unending floor offer that james set (and never rescinded afaik); so there's that...

[11-Nov-18 07:40 PM] KSanJuan#9608
The invisible 0.10 offer that's apparrently too much effort to execute?
