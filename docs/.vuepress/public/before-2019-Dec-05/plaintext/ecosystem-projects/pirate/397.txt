[dscrd-prt] <Jimm B.> I did not hear the turtle thing completely.  can someone briefly explain the connection between pirate and turtle?

[16-Nov-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> Wolf is joining pirate, wolf has created turtle network and will be now combining the two, Turtle Network(TN) will become Tortuga Network(Still TN!)  filling the gap that we had there.

Turtle network is a dex that's part of a larger group of companies. One of those companies is an on-ramp/gateway that will be connected to TN. 
TN will then be adding ARRR and stablecoins , this will then be a way of having a *crypto black box* .... the most anonymous coin mixing ever will then be available.

[16-Nov-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> PirateOS has a channel in captains quarters for development. once it's finally released, it will get it's own public channel

[16-Nov-19 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> GhostShipOS will be free afaik and you can put it on your own stick drive

[16-Nov-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Jimm B.> So it's called GhostShipOS and not PirateOS?

[16-Nov-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> PirateOS will have 2 versions

[16-Nov-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> GhostShipOS and GalleonOS

[16-Nov-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Jimm B.> what is the difference?

[16-Nov-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> GhostShip is a bare bones OS that provides security features and otehr basic things

[16-Nov-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Galleon is the high end version with tons of various tools and features

[16-Nov-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Jimm B.> will it be simple, so that not so technical users can use it?

[16-Nov-19 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> that's the goal, yep

[16-Nov-19 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> we learned a LOT from the cayman trip, one of the biggest things is making sure non-technical users are able to use anything we build

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `making sure non-technical users are able to use anything we build`

[16-Nov-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ üë¥üèºüì¢ i completely agree, but it's a goal we should be heading towards

[16-Nov-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LoPhatMelk> All I heard CG say was ```challenge accepted```

[16-Nov-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-Nov-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Jimm B.> That sounds great and I am pleased to see that Pirate Chain does not exclusively care about the financial privacy of their community.

[16-Nov-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `but it's a goal we should be heading towards`
or should our goal be to get them to meet in the middle?

[16-Nov-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> that would be an ideal situation

[16-Nov-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> but we should push further to make sure we capture as many people as possible

[16-Nov-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> I don't disagree with that, but imo there needs to be a realization that people need to come to the future
I hate my feken "phone" because the phone bits are pretty much an after thought and I had to learn how to operate the silly OS just to make a dam'd call
and crypto isn't much different

[16-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LoPhatMelk> the learning curve of crypto is much much greater though, imo.

[16-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> i can see your point

[16-Nov-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Jimm B.> what are the chances for a mobile os?

[16-Nov-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `the learning curve of crypto is much much greater though, imo.`
maybe because you didn't only have 3 phones in the last 18 years?
