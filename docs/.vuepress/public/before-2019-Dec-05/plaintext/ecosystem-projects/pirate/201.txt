ok, thanks 😃

[21-Oct-18 10:59 PM] jl777c#5810
even GPU would have a hard time mining when 100Msols

[21-Oct-18 11:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my GPUs were so pointless that I stuck them back on KMD 😛

If you GPU mine PIRATE, never do it solo; always point them at a public pool

[21-Oct-18 11:06 PM] Microbeguy86#3447
Anyone know if there is a solo pool?

[21-Oct-18 11:07 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
A solo pool implies it is just for you. You can use knomp to set your own one up.

@jl777c That is indeed the architecture, separate servers for the bot and daemon

oh, so the errors about pending is just precautionary

[21-Oct-18 11:11 PM] sclear#0274
Yes

[21-Oct-18 11:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Microbeguy86 I did, shortly, consider a public solo pool
The problem with them is fielding all of the complaints by people that don't understand what they are and want to know why they didn't get paid for shares that were not block finds 😕

[21-Oct-18 11:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_isn't exactly a "people person"_

[21-Oct-18 11:15 PM] Microbeguy86#3447
Yeah you would think the word solo would indicate the purpose. Thanks for the responses

bro

[22-Oct-18 04:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
diff is double yesterday, which means you could likely earn 1/2 of what you earned yesterday
depends on what hash is where

[22-Oct-18 04:09 AM] damodar#8781
Iam mining since 4 days I added 100khs for 1day from NH that’s the reason it is 641. But for first day I mined completely with 30khs . Got 180arrr

[22-Oct-18 04:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Network Hash Rate:    95.35 MH`
pool:`28.66 MSol/s (Avg)`
So, pool should average 110920.9700787402 per day (at the given 95.35 M network rate; more if networks goes lower, less if network goes higher)
I leave the rest of the math up to you

[22-Oct-18 04:31 AM] duxiaoer#1142
1 MSlo/s  .How many ARRR can be mine every day?

[22-Oct-18 04:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
read the post above yours and math

Did it got canceled

`You have 1 pending operation(s).`

[22-Oct-18 04:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You can dm the bot and see what you have

[22-Oct-18 04:38 AM] plazma#1625
It showing 0 pending operation

[22-Oct-18 04:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and now you know

[22-Oct-18 04:39 AM] plazma#1625
It seems that tip got terminated

Neither! This is real—and it's 100% transparent. You're literally giving your money to someone on the internet and getting completely useless cryptocurrency in return.```

[22-Oct-18 06:59 AM] jansako#3330
Is something not right with the pools? 
https://arrr.pool-mining.xyz/stats - pool hash 60 Msol, nethash ~60 Msol
https://piratepool.io/ pool hash - 40 MSol, Nethash 60 Msol

[22-Oct-18 07:00 AM] jansako#3330
arrr.pool fork?

[22-Oct-18 07:01 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Will PIRATE be traded on any exchanges?
I hope so. You have no idea how much I hope so.

In fact, if it does get picked up by any of the major exchanges, I promise to use some of the PIRATE proceeds to constantly and incessantly manipulate the market. 😂

[22-Oct-18 07:03 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@jansako it could be because the pool hash's have lag and are a running average. So these won't always equal to the total network hash rate

[22-Oct-18 07:04 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@DR3WSKi #deleted-channel is the planned ztransaction only cex that is in development that will support ARRR-->KMD--->ARRR trading

[22-Oct-18 07:14 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
@NutellaLicka I know, that was posted in the pirate cash website listed above in bitcointalk

can you just check ONE url or so before saying something like this, i would really appreciate that, thank you

[22-Oct-18 07:19 AM] 0x03#8822
it's probably more the case that we both actually do have these numbers, but the nethash may be just off. i'm still unsure how much 'weight' that nethash number has, it doesnt' seem to be much more than a 'loose hint'

[22-Oct-18 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
there is already a PIRATE copycat coin, it just has no tech

[22-Oct-18 07:28 AM] 0x03#8822

@0x03  IF there was indeed an issue would it not be more likely that the pool which reports that it owns the whole coin hashrate would be the one having the issue? Nothing personal, + my hash has been on your pool since the beginning, so forgive me if I am concerned about that one a bit more. Understood about wonky nethash numbers though.

[22-Oct-18 08:07 AM] 0x03#8822
nothing personal as well

[22-Oct-18 08:07 AM] 0x03#8822

verus-sunday was enough for me 😛

[22-Oct-18 08:08 AM] 0x03#8822
i remember before it was the other way around, where .io had most of the hash (around nethash) and it looked like my numbers were just missing

[22-Oct-18 08:08 AM] 0x03#8822
so, at this point in time it's nothing that really concerns me

[22-Oct-18 08:09 AM] 0x03#8822
we're finding the blocks on the right chain, the payouts work (slow, but they do). the stats output "isn't building up a queue as it seems", i feel good about the status of .xyz

[22-Oct-18 08:10 AM] 0x03#8822
this whole z-only thing is a bit experimental from my pool-point of view. but the hashrate display on the pool web UI is just taken from the daemons api call

[22-Oct-18 08:16 AM] duxiaoer#1142
When is the block reward halved?

[22-Oct-18 08:34 AM] duxiaoer#1142
It has already been synchronized by 7%, and then the program is closed, and it do not work when I  open again.

[22-Oct-18 08:54 AM] jansako#3330
That one is a 'known issue' with Agama wallet. The only sure-fire way (that I know of) to resolve is to back up your wallet, then delete the folder the wallet was in. Put the wallet.dat back and restart Agama.

[22-Oct-18 09:46 AM] 0x03#8822
i was thinking about limiting my pool to a maximum number of miners (also maybe workers) in order to 'force spread' hashrate, i think that could be done, looking for comments on the idea. so far it was just a thought.
