Is there a toggle to disable CPU mining Pirate within Agama? Considering there is not much use of it any more, maybe the next Agama release could have it 'OFF' by default?

[18-Oct-18 11:33 AM] 0x03#8822
i'm pretty sure -gen is 0 by default

[18-Oct-18 11:34 AM] 0x03#8822
however the apicall is `setgenerate true/false`

[18-Oct-18 11:34 AM] 0x03#8822
or `getgenerate`

[18-Oct-18 11:34 AM] jansako#3330
for me the hammer is on and I definitely did not turn if on manually

[18-Oct-18 11:35 AM] SHossain#0007
you are right @0x03 . @jansako you can ignore that. the feature is there to mine any minable coin easily using Agama

[18-Oct-18 11:35 AM] SHossain#0007
users also can select how many threads to use for mining specific chain

[18-Oct-18 11:36 AM] SHossain#0007
by default it uses `genproclimit=0` option which doesn't eat CPU time for PIRATE

[18-Oct-18 11:36 AM] jansako#3330
It is clear why it is there,. I am questioning the need to be on by default at this time

[18-Oct-18 11:36 AM] jansako#3330
If in fact it does not mine, then maybe the issue is with the GUI showing the hammer icon

it's definitely off if you add `gen=0` and `genproclimit=0` to your PIRATE.conf tho

[18-Oct-18 11:38 AM] 0x03#8822

[18-Oct-18 11:38 AM] jansako#3330
indeed.

[18-Oct-18 11:38 AM] 0x03#8822
you could also monitor the debug.log at startup, it will tell you wether it's mining

[18-Oct-18 11:38 AM] 0x03#8822

Hi, I am trying to mine ARRR, but the GPU nVidia miner says: "authorization failed" What to I do???

[18-Oct-18 11:40 AM] jansako#3330
let me see 'getgenerate'

[18-Oct-18 11:41 AM] SHossain#0007
@jansako try `./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE setgenerate false`

[18-Oct-18 11:41 AM] jansako#3330
I get 'false'

[18-Oct-18 11:41 AM] jansako#3330
so it does not generate, but the UI shows that it does

[18-Oct-18 11:41 AM] jansako#3330
Issue: Fix UI to not show the hammer icon when setgenerate = false 😃

[18-Oct-18 11:42 AM] SHossain#0007
this is a cosmetic display issue. nothing harmful.

This is a very good example of why it is pointless to call optional privacy, an effective method.

Replying to @fluffypony @PirateChain and 8 others

The Zcash MPC transcript files have been missing for months; I no no one who has verified them fully. Without those files there's no way to verify the trusted setup ceremony was actually used.

I was promised a few weeks ago that this would be fixed ASAP; still missing.

[18-Oct-18 07:35 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Anyone familiar with the above?

to be fair, he found issues with the compiler used and now this one, that are outside the scope of his part as partecipant. I really don't know enough to say if he's too much nitpicking or it's the zcash devs too sloppy
