porting Hush-NG, essentially rebranding the codebase with a few tweaks, for Pirate is looking very interesting. It allows sending and receiving messages via the memo field, which I think Pirate users would enjoy filling with bad pirate jokes

[03-Oct-18 05:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto I deleted my crappy joke so that the honest question didn't get lost

[03-Oct-18 05:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am not used to honest questions. I usually look for interesting bounties and work on them if the reward sounds reasonable for the risk of trying to deliver the working code

[03-Oct-18 05:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
just for my own curiosity, you might find that I rage-commit a Pirate-NG wallet (obviously needs a better name), and then let the community spruce it up with nice graphics/css/etc

[03-Oct-18 05:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Asked because I'm always intrigued by the fine balance of people don't know how much to offer and coders don't want to ask/announce for fear of people 😮 over what the work is actually worth

[03-Oct-18 05:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
been too busy insulating water pipes and fixing Hush dpow, but it's bubbling up to the top of the list

[03-Oct-18 05:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have been rewarded generously for cryptocoin bounties, and I have also been screwed over a few times with really low-ball amounts for the work involved, which I usually decline but sometimes you can't resist

[03-Oct-18 05:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
and sometimes you spend dozens of hours to figure out if you can estimate how hard the whole project is, and it all ends in getting paid nothing. But that is not the case with this particular thing, Pirate gui wallet is comparatively easy, to say fixing weird KMD coredumps

[03-Oct-18 05:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
the ongoing maintenence of a gui wallet, constant updates and security fixes and ..., that is what is the biggest time sink for the dev

[03-Oct-18 05:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
personal example:
I got offered x amount for a private stratum
To me, that was an insanely low amount for that much work
To him, that was incredibly high and "generous offer"

[03-Oct-18 05:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
yep, that sounds very familiar

[03-Oct-18 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
sudo somebody think up a good name for a gui pirate wallet

using hush-ng codebase for pirate wallet also means we inherit translations into about 10 different languages, and keeps growing

i started agama but the KMD daemon doesnt start synchronizing. it just says  Loading data please wait...

[03-Oct-18 06:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`please wait...` is an indicator that you should wait

[03-Oct-18 06:27 PM] okr#4596
im waiting for more than 30 minutes now

[03-Oct-18 06:28 PM] okr#4596
nothing happens

[03-Oct-18 06:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, then at that point it's likely an issue
Have you used Agama before and what version are you using now?

[03-Oct-18 06:35 PM] okr#4596
i started it the first time. Agama v0.2.34c-beta

[03-Oct-18 06:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm assuming Windows and have to ask: firewall blocking it?

[03-Oct-18 06:36 PM] SHossain#0007
there is no 34c

[03-Oct-18 06:36 PM] SHossain#0007
it is 42c

[03-Oct-18 06:36 PM] okr#4596
42

pirate mining really nice

[03-Oct-18 07:59 PM] starcevic#0296
wallet stuck at 100% and no adress

[03-Oct-18 08:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@6.5x the KMD diff, it's nicer for the coin than the miners @And1_89 😝

[03-Oct-18 08:03 PM] And1_89#6578
yes I feel it there are fewer coins for me...must be retrofitted

[03-Oct-18 08:06 PM] And1_89#6578
only 2 pools?

[03-Oct-18 08:06 PM] And1_89#6578
for pirate?

[03-Oct-18 08:07 PM] joe2x4#5987
The map wallet leads you to your pirate treasure ARRR. Sounds about right.

[03-Oct-18 08:08 PM] And1_89#6578

[03-Oct-18 08:21 PM] Flexatron#8809
You want pirate? Go get it..

[03-Oct-18 08:22 PM] And1_89#6578
is there a mining calculator?

[03-Oct-18 08:22 PM] BlockTech#6895
I don't think so ... not for now

[03-Oct-18 08:26 PM] BlockTech#6895
But quick math : --->>> Nbr of Pirate per day / Network Hashrate = Pirate per sol.      ---->>>  Pirate per sol * your sol/s = Your pirates earned per day (approximatively). ---->>>  Not 100% sure.

[03-Oct-18 08:27 PM] BlockTech#6895
with 1Ksol/s you get around 4 pirates a day with the currend Network Hashrate I think.

[03-Oct-18 08:28 PM] BlockTech#6895
For the electricity cost, just go : ---->>>   your consumption, * 24 / 1000 * your electricity cost per Kwh. -----> >>>  give you your daily electricity cost.

[03-Oct-18 08:35 PM] BlockTech#6895
Personnaly it cost me around 1,5$ (electricity ) mining with 2 GTX 1070  -> Give me around 3,8 pirates a day = ~ 0,5$  I'm probably gonna stop mining tomorrow ^^. (High electricity cost in my country.) @And1_89

[03-Oct-18 08:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@starcevic when it's at `100%`, that means you have all the blocks; it will never go higher than 100% because math

Don't forget, we are still giving away "FREE 77.7 ARRR, TWICE!!" - Technically it's not free, we just need a little time and influence spreading.

how much pirates can be created every day?

[03-Oct-18 09:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
368640 on average

[03-Oct-18 09:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1440*256

[03-Oct-18 09:11 PM] And1_89#6578
nice  if one owns 10% hash is 36864 pirats

[03-Oct-18 09:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
on average, in a perfect world; yes

[03-Oct-18 09:11 PM] And1_89#6578

or miningrigrentals

[03-Oct-18 09:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
note:
`in a perfect world`
includes that when you add 10% of current, the new total is larger and you're not 10%, so that's assuming you *already have* 10%

[03-Oct-18 09:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it also ignores the reality that sometimes life sux and bad luck can kick you in the balls

[03-Oct-18 09:15 PM] And1_89#6578
Ok, thanks for the information

[03-Oct-18 09:15 PM] Llama#1330
I'm assuming that selling price of pirate is going to go up since mining costs a lot now?

[03-Oct-18 09:15 PM] cantptalblonit#9346
I like AARR  ❤
