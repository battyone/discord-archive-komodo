If my math is right, that puts PIRATE market cap at $349K or 306K KMD

[26-Sep-18 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810

[26-Sep-18 07:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Is there already an infographic on how to setup the wallet and buy pirate?   Would putting one together be useless if Agama is integrating soon?

[26-Sep-18 07:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I want to do a mining rig time giveaway.

[26-Sep-18 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it is in agama already

[26-Sep-18 07:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The release version?

[26-Sep-18 07:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[26-Sep-18 07:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Ooohhh. Sexy.  I thought that the wallet released was a test.

[26-Sep-18 07:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all Agama releases are a test 😛

[26-Sep-18 07:06 PM] Flexatron#8809
46M

[26-Sep-18 07:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Ok.   So if I do a mining rig time giveaway... current Agama users can add pirate (native mode only) and send me their zaddr for entry?

[26-Sep-18 07:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The last one I did for KMD got 77k impressions.

[26-Sep-18 07:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Flexatron You've really got to start looking at block diffs; you're posting it going higher when actual diff dropped a touch

[26-Sep-18 07:09 PM] jorian#4555
@FishyGuts Agama works, so it's a nice idea!

[26-Sep-18 07:14 PM] jcooper#1100
just to be sure. All i do is copy the wif priv key for my pirate z address and then put that wif key in agama to start and i should have my balance?

Just a quick Q, You can mine with Agama using the CLI with the same commands to mine as other coins?

[26-Sep-18 07:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, but unless you're on a super-computer it will not do you much good to do so

[26-Sep-18 07:41 PM] LesDudis#3792
in Agama there is an icon for Pirate that says "Mining is enabled". I wondered what this is (I don't want Agama to mine)

[26-Sep-18 07:43 PM] snowdamn#2414
i'm too old for multiple stage OTC, is anyone here placing Bids market-making or you're keeping what you get? have an offer if you are, PM me. @jl777c ?

[26-Sep-18 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
I am selling at 0.05 KMD

[26-Sep-18 07:44 PM] snowdamn#2414
hey, why did my name change here?  i only meant to change it on YDX lol

[26-Sep-18 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
have a bid at 0.02 KMD, but nobody sells at that price anymore, market seems to be moved up to 0.03

[26-Sep-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
due to higher hashrate, my bid is now 0.04 and ask of 0.07. Also the 5BTC for 1 million PIRATE if a single trade

[26-Sep-18 08:15 PM] Flexatron#8809
Its just one guy with 10Msol going from pool to solo

[26-Sep-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE needs no whitepaper, it is already complete

[26-Sep-18 08:15 PM] Flexatron#8809
