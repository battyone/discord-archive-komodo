I'll be sending you 250,000 PIRATE as we discussed earlier.

[25-Sep-18 06:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jorian is the person taking care of giveaways

[25-Sep-18 06:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain might also coordinate and help I guess

[25-Sep-18 06:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
you three can discuss further how you want to handle this giveaway

[25-Sep-18 06:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If message missed from earlier chat then @SHossain proposed to extend this giveaway time, to get more users to project

[25-Sep-18 06:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If I could be of any help, let me know, I'll try my best

[25-Sep-18 06:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm still willing to buy PIRATE at reasonable rate

[25-Sep-18 06:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
WTB PIRATE @ 0.015 KMD

[25-Sep-18 06:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_doesn't have enough volume yet to sell at that price_

[25-Sep-18 06:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what volume you have ? 🙂

[25-Sep-18 06:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only 27k 😦

[25-Sep-18 06:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and then I have 0 PIRATE 😕

[25-Sep-18 06:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄

[25-Sep-18 06:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what happened?

[25-Sep-18 06:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
fork etc ?

[25-Sep-18 06:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
🍴

[25-Sep-18 06:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
hardfork daemon update

[25-Sep-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I still have that 250k I mined for $50 at the start 😄

[25-Sep-18 06:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackjok3r I can also send you $100 worth of KMD if you like 😉 :trollface:

[25-Sep-18 06:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
instead of PIRATE 😄

[25-Sep-18 06:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
double profit for you 😄

[25-Sep-18 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am super busy, on STAKED stuff, what I need is a valid sendmany I can just send. if you guys can figure that out I can send it whenever.

[25-Sep-18 06:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Since the block reward was so high, I thought you guys were just fekin' around with a joke, so I only ever mined 2 blocks before today

[25-Sep-18 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have trouble working out how to do the no change thing

[25-Sep-18 06:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think FSM has the update to do sendmany update

[25-Sep-18 06:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
isn't it?

[25-Sep-18 06:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
afaik all branches now have it

[25-Sep-18 06:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I went excited and crazy once I read the words from James "already complete/finished project"! 😄

[25-Sep-18 06:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
:abusedsmily:

[25-Sep-18 06:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackjok3r don't worry about pirate then, just wait for @SHossain

[25-Sep-18 06:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_never read it because he had this whole category except #private-staked muted_

[25-Sep-18 06:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
he has it figured it out

[25-Sep-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha.. .STAKED has taken many many sleepless days here, almost killed me I think... getting somewhere though. I enjoy the problem solving and learning, having to mix C and C++ depsite knowing none at all to start with has been challenging 😄

[25-Sep-18 06:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
You are doing great so far my friend.... 🙂

[25-Sep-18 06:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
keep it up

[25-Sep-18 06:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and stay healthy

[25-Sep-18 07:49 AM] jorian#4555
so the sendmany problem that seems to be preventing the airdrop has been fixed in latest?

[25-Sep-18 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
what sendmany problem? for zaddrs it should just work as normal, the pool is sending to many in one tx

[25-Sep-18 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, z_sendmany

[25-Sep-18 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
sendmany is for taddr

[25-Sep-18 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
wont work

[25-Sep-18 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
z_sendmany has no change thats all

[25-Sep-18 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
sendtoaddress will only work to notary address

[25-Sep-18 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to calculate the amaount of the utxos in my address and divide it exactly right over the address you collected

[25-Sep-18 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once this is done, I can send it, then grewal can send me abck pirate

[25-Sep-18 07:52 AM] jorian#4555
what about you backup your wallet, move it, create a new wallet, let grewal send 250k and then have 1 utxo to work with?

[25-Sep-18 07:52 AM] jorian#4555
i can do that too

[25-Sep-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant move the coins from a T address at alll

[25-Sep-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are in 256 coinabse utxo

[25-Sep-18 07:53 AM] jorian#4555
does it need to be a t addy?

[25-Sep-18 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
how about z_shieldcoinbase ?

[25-Sep-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we decided that for transparency, but if its proves too hard, just send it from a Z address then you dont need mine

[25-Sep-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤷

[25-Sep-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_shieldcoinbase "*" <zaddr>

[25-Sep-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
it deals with exact amounts issue

[25-Sep-18 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it also sheilds all the coins, which was to be avloided, the TX has liek 30 receipents

[25-Sep-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
packs 50 coinbase into a single z

[25-Sep-18 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
why does it need to be avoided?

[25-Sep-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
250,000 / 30*256

[25-Sep-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
an TX fee of somehting should work

[25-Sep-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if sending from Z address, you dont need my unsheilded funds

[25-Sep-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I held them all this time so they could be used for the aridrop to prove it was sent

[25-Sep-18 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
you cant easily prove it was sent to any specific zaddress

[25-Sep-18 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you save the log of the z_sendmany, z_operationstatus then while it isnt 100% proof, from all practical purpose it will be sufficient

@Alright @blackjok3r would you guys like me / help me to write up a pocket guide for Pirate? So there is one place noobs can find all the important links and get some simple explanations? We could attach the audio to it. If this sounds good can you give me all relevant links that exist in a google doc pls?
