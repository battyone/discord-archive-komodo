[20-Oct-18 04:11 PM] Dr Debt#0891
is piratepool down or something?

[20-Oct-18 04:11 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I havent gotten a balance increase in a while.

[20-Oct-18 04:13 PM] penguin#0544
its up, hashrate has spread quite a bit

[20-Oct-18 04:13 PM] penguin#0544
currently 25% on piratepool

[20-Oct-18 04:14 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Just have not seen an increase lately on my stats.

[20-Oct-18 04:14 PM] Dr Debt#0891
that will change in a few minutes.

[20-Oct-18 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
backlogged from 300 miners

[20-Oct-18 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe people can test piratchain.org?

[20-Oct-18 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
we have a third pool, but no hashate on it

[20-Oct-18 04:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I moved to arrr this morning.  Please don’t make me move my rigs again 🙉

[20-Oct-18 04:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
May have missed it, how’d the interview go @FishyGuts

[20-Oct-18 04:15 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I'll have to sell what I mined to get rigs running again, but I can put 1/3 hashrate on it

@FishyGuts you should make a stuff-to-share channel for pirate and then people can know whats up

[20-Oct-18 04:17 PM] bishop#9773
Need moar channelz

[20-Oct-18 04:17 PM] Dr Debt#0891

[20-Oct-18 04:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Hollowman9000 I said know your chicken twice... I made a inside joke reference with computergenie and I hung my head in disgust when he mentioned “a monero fork with KYC”.

[20-Oct-18 04:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Overall I think I did great actually 👊

[20-Oct-18 04:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085

I dont have a lot of time but I can make the little I have work well

[20-Oct-18 04:19 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Data and layout is the challenge.  We have lots of artists.

[20-Oct-18 04:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You forgot snipers in the trees and serial killers hiding in the bushes for the pirate house

[20-Oct-18 04:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
We also diagonally drill and drink milkshakes

[20-Oct-18 04:22 PM] penguin#0544
this is true

[20-Oct-18 04:22 PM] penguin#0544
and good ol' jolly does a mean tap dance

[20-Oct-18 04:23 PM] Dr Debt#0891

[20-Oct-18 04:33 PM] Dr Debt#0891
as of what block?

[20-Oct-18 04:33 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I will still mine there to help out

[20-Oct-18 04:33 PM] Dr Debt#0891
just figuring the numbers up.

[20-Oct-18 04:34 PM] bishop#9773
not really helping if you aren't spreading hash to other pools, assuming it is all dumped on webs

[20-Oct-18 04:34 PM] Dr Debt#0891
this one donates half the pool fee to marketing.

[20-Oct-18 04:34 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Im ok with that.

[20-Oct-18 04:35 PM] Dr Debt#0891
and if you havent noticed that piratepool is no longer a majority.

[20-Oct-18 04:35 PM] bishop#9773
there is a backlog needing to be worked through

[20-Oct-18 04:35 PM] kankanbr#2286
How can i buy ?

[20-Oct-18 04:35 PM] bishop#9773
I haven't looked in awhile

[20-Oct-18 04:35 PM] Dr Debt#0891
go to the OTC channel @kankanbr

[20-Oct-18 04:35 PM] bishop#9773
I figured if he was bumping mins and fees, it's still bad
