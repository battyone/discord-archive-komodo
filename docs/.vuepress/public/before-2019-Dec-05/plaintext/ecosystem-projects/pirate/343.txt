do they do it themselves or do like znomp and leave it to ZCL/others?

@jl777c i think `ssKey` needs to be initialized/set differently, but comparing the ZEC to KMD code is pretty rough

[25-Nov-18 07:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c perhaps my "iterating backwards" trick no longer works

[25-Nov-18 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it is getting 100+ entries, but I think it is just the local wallet entries. i got it to iterate the local wallet addresses. the DB code is just so far from what I usually work on...

[25-Nov-18 07:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
the DB code is a strange place

[25-Nov-18 07:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
reading thru the code in wo01 (which is pretty nice, succinct, less code that does the same), I don't see them doing things in a different way, other than using a normal forward iterator

[25-Nov-18 07:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
like this code, which doesn't use a `chType` variable, and feels easier to read: https://github.com/wo01/zcash/blob/bitcore/src/txdb.cpp#L337

maybe `CAddressUnspentKey` changed?

[25-Nov-18 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yes iterating addresses in the wallet is working, but using the addressindex=1 DB for all addresses is what is the problem

[25-Nov-18 07:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i may have found something in `CAddressUnspentKey`

[25-Nov-18 07:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c looks like GetSerializeSize is set to 57 in KMD

[25-Nov-18 07:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c the wo01/zcash repo does not do that

@ComputerGenie was that 645K or 324K ARRR in holdings (edited)? When it was $.14 that's over $90,000. Wow. Seriously impressive. I was holding over 10K ARRR at DP waiting to sell until I heard that keeping balances at an Exchange isn't a smart idea since that holding wallet isn't yours. Seems obvious to you old pros but the simple rule I just learned was if you don't have the password for the wallet then it isn't yours so don't treat it like it is yours for holding. (And based on all the warnings of these desktop wallets for other coins like SCRIV it seems even then one needs to be careful of malware. Yikes)

`Pirate (ARRR) is a real privacy coin that takes financial privacy very serious` This sentence makes me cringe.
My suggestion would be (happy to hear peoples thoughts or additions):
`Pirate, the privacy coin.` This is simple and to the point. 
Other suggestions could be:
`Pirate (ARRR) is a coin that addresses the issue of financial privacy through the use of anonymous transactions.`
or
`Pirate (ARRR) addresses financial privacy on the blockchain through the use of anonymous transactions.`

[26-Nov-18 03:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@burbank It's RKT (a test coin), not ARRR, which is why I made the comment about not having value and a weather caused blackout glitched my db causing the initial count to double (hence the edit)
As for ARRR:
I have a good chunk of holding in my own wallet for security...
I gave a portion of my earnings to an exchange (and yes, you're giving it to them) --  a tradable amount...
If you ever don't trust the proper wallet of a given coin then you shouldn't be anywhere near that coin...

<b>Pirate, the privacy coin.</b>
Pirate (ARRR) is a cryptocurrency that solves the issue of financial privacy on the blockchain by forcing anonymous transactions. Using ZK-Snarks, 100% of peer-to-peer transactions are shielded. Meaning, no data from a transaction is given and complete anonymity is retained. 

<b>Pirate uses a privacy protocol that cannot be compromised by other users network activity.</b>
As other privacy coins offer the choice to use regular or shielded addresses, complete anonymity cannot be guaranteed. This privacy compromise is due to data correlation between regular and shielded transactions that can be tracked quite easily. Pirate forces shielded transactions, providing no ability to leak information.

<b>In order to 51% attack Pirate, you would have to first 51% attack Bitcoin. </b>
Komodo's delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) {link this website: https://komodoplatform.com/security-delayed-proof-of-work-dpow/} protects Pirate's blockchain against double spends and 51% attacks. Simply put, a backup of the ARRR chain is written into a block on the Bitcoin blockchain every 10 minutes and can be restored if needed. An attacker would need to compromise the Bitcoin blockchain to destroy the backups, prior to compromising the ARRR chain.
This provides complete security against double spends and hostile takeovers, causing them to be extremely costly and near impossible.

I like what you wrote.

[26-Nov-18 05:02 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Personally, I think the front page has too many fluffy words. If people want to take this seriously, it needs to be informative, to the point, and not contain too much technical jargon (I have kept ZK-snarks in there, not sure if it should stay).

[26-Nov-18 05:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085

I like what you wrote.  We haven’t hard coded the site because I don’t have verbiage.

[26-Nov-18 05:04 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I fully understand, you've taken on a massive project. You may even benefit from having a couple of people aboard with you to help task shed

Certainly.  There have been great people helping contribute.   The delegation and assistance need will only grow with time.

[26-Nov-18 05:08 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I would say that not including devs, there’s about 25 people including pool ops doing things for pirate.

[26-Nov-18 05:08 AM] FishyGuts#5085
You see sometimes I also have a hard time with perspective.

[26-Nov-18 05:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It’s nice to hear and use others writings on the subjects we need to cover as I find it difficult to detach my knowledge from the project. I always assume people know more than they do.

[26-Nov-18 05:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Then it’s a tough balance@of overexplaining things.

I think to start creating videos, there needs to be solid graphics, and a solid website. That way, any marketing efforts aren't wasted when they go to the website and get confused, or see it as unprofessional and not something they'd want to be interested in.

[26-Nov-18 05:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I have video guys.  Ad a voice guy.

[26-Nov-18 05:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085

I have two video producers making videos for our site.  
I need scripts@for their videos to give@to the voice and video guys.  
One video is about Pirate in general.  Refer to getmonero.org and their explainer video.   

I also want another video on privacy and why we need/deserve it.   

Both about 1-2 minutes.
