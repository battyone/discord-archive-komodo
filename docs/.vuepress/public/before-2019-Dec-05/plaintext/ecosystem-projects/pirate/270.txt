Hi guys

[05-Nov-18 01:54 PM] Grey#9588
I wonder why arrr not asic resistant?

[05-Nov-18 01:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Why should it be?

[05-Nov-18 01:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
More hashrate means more security

[05-Nov-18 01:59 PM] crumb#2550
why use lawnmowers when you can cut grass with scissors?

Sell scissors, buy few good lawn mowers :D

[05-Nov-18 02:03 PM] crumb#2550
you'd need to sell a lot of scissors 😄

[05-Nov-18 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
actually the price for lawnmowers and scissors are about the same

[05-Nov-18 02:05 PM] crumb#2550
in this case yes, so the arguments for asic resistance is just being resistant to change

[05-Nov-18 02:05 PM] crumb#2550
which in the long term is not a good idea

[05-Nov-18 02:09 PM] Oszy#5734
once there were cpu mining then gpu came along, now it's the time of asic, can't remember people  getting triggered about able to gpu mine.

[05-Nov-18 02:09 PM] Oszy#5734
next they going to want mining resistance? :trollface:

[05-Nov-18 02:11 PM] crumb#2550
there already is a case against mining. make everything 100% PoS :trollface:

[05-Nov-18 02:19 PM] jorian#4555
@Flexatron i don't see ARRR on blockfolio

[05-Nov-18 02:21 PM] jorian#4555

[05-Nov-18 03:00 PM] TheGemologist#6023

[05-Nov-18 03:16 PM] Oszy#5734
Just post here for the time being

[05-Nov-18 03:18 PM] joe2x4#5987
Let's just make it a more complicated OTC, transfer yer ARRR to a trusted escrow, they'll issue you a barterdex compatible proxy token, trade on barterdex, escrow releases ARRR once successful. :trollface: or digipri

I think the P will probably be "The Logo" you think Web?

[05-Nov-18 05:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We can pick an image or something else too... but I wanted to get your idea/insight.  

Like how Bitcoin and Eth and all others have their symbol.

[05-Nov-18 05:54 PM] SHossain#0007
i like the P as logo
