Push & pull

[09-Nov-18 08:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
Spread them out a bit and it's fine. Building an enclosure though to reduce the noise and try to deliver cold air more efficiently

[09-Nov-18 08:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
On the upside, it's winter where i am and i haven't turned on the heating üòÇ

I was looking at gov grants but my house is positioned in the worst possible way for solar panels and they won't do it

When pirate moons, I'm just gonna pay off my house live debt free (as well as buy more miners and add solar panels lol)

[09-Nov-18 08:58 PM] wolfgang#3508

[09-Nov-18 09:00 PM] nackmaster#2726
lol

[09-Nov-18 09:00 PM] Draeth#3300
@Wolfgang renting is actually better than owning in a lot of cases (unless you can buy a house with cash or get a 15 year loan n pay it off in 10)

[09-Nov-18 09:01 PM] nackmaster#2726
but renting you aren't paying towards an investment....

[09-Nov-18 09:01 PM] ronyi#5719
@webworker01 = piratepool

[09-Nov-18 09:01 PM] wolfgang#3508
yeh no long term mortgages

[09-Nov-18 09:01 PM] nackmaster#2726
you're paying somone else's mortgage

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[09-Nov-18 09:01 PM] nackmaster#2726
basically wasted money

[09-Nov-18 09:02 PM] Draeth#3300
@nackmaster yea, but if you get a 30 year mortgage, you'll pay double the value of the house (or more) in that time frame, and you'll never make that money back

[09-Nov-18 09:02 PM] Draeth#3300
Plus with renting, you dont have to pay to fix anything (unless you break it]

[09-Nov-18 09:02 PM] nackmaster#2726
depends on market, but yeah you might not make it back

[09-Nov-18 09:03 PM] Draeth#3300

[09-Nov-18 09:07 PM] nackmaster#2726
solar shingles are maaaad expensive, talk about never getting an ROI

[09-Nov-18 09:07 PM] tahoeminer#4362
@mrlynch  it was 10 Fahrenheit here where I live last night.  I thought It might have been to cold for the miners when I looked at the stats and the chip temps were at 48C

[09-Nov-18 09:07 PM] tahoeminer#4362
between 38c and 48c

[09-Nov-18 09:09 PM] nackmaster#2726
the reported hashrate on polly is a lot lower than piratepool

[09-Nov-18 09:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Draeth @nackmaster @wolfgang renting sucks. Even if you don't make your money back you will make SOME money back whereas by renting you just make someone else's SOME money back. Food for thought ;)

Ah I see. Some people won't trust a coin unless it is scratch built. Maybe we shouldn't trust any surgeons today since they are standing on the shoulders of giants as well?

[09-Nov-18 09:17 PM] dolladollaiv#3294
