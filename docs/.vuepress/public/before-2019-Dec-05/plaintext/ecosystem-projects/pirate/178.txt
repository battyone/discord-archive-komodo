Hey guys I bought 777 pirates for 184 kmd now is half the price, am I getting extra pirates , cause that’s kind of not fair, you guys are in control of price so you can change it anytime

[18-Oct-18 02:28 AM] bishop#9773
@DmanXX What are you talking about? When you decided to send those KMD for that number of pirate, you agreed to that price...

[18-Oct-18 02:29 AM] bishop#9773
I find it hard to believe the onboarding amount changed mid transfer

[18-Oct-18 02:30 AM] DmanXX#2257
It did man, it’s just not fair

[18-Oct-18 02:30 AM] bishop#9773
BTC is in the 6s... it was in close to 20

[18-Oct-18 02:30 AM] bishop#9773
is that fair?

[18-Oct-18 02:30 AM] DmanXX#2257
It is different

[18-Oct-18 02:31 AM] DmanXX#2257
Btc is controlled by market

[18-Oct-18 02:31 AM] bishop#9773
pirate is controlled by the market

[18-Oct-18 02:31 AM] bishop#9773
supply and demand

[18-Oct-18 02:31 AM] DmanXX#2257
Pirate price is controlled by someone

[18-Oct-18 02:32 AM] bishop#9773
Excess supply and low demand pushes prices down

[18-Oct-18 02:32 AM] bishop#9773
If buyers do not pay prevailing rates for the available supply, sellers lower prices until they find buyers

[18-Oct-18 02:32 AM] DmanXX#2257
Still not fair it is ico

[18-Oct-18 02:32 AM] bishop#9773
no it is not

[18-Oct-18 02:33 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
ico ?

[18-Oct-18 02:33 AM] DmanXX#2257
Pirate is not on market

[18-Oct-18 02:33 AM] bishop#9773
a market is willing buyers and willing sellers

[18-Oct-18 02:33 AM] bishop#9773
were you not a willing buyer that paid a seller?

[18-Oct-18 02:33 AM] DmanXX#2257
You can call it onboard or whatever it is still ico

[18-Oct-18 02:34 AM] bishop#9773
I think you need to look up the definition of what an ICO really is

[18-Oct-18 02:34 AM] DmanXX#2257
I bought it from pirate not from someone on exchange

[18-Oct-18 02:34 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
Price goes down because Nicehash dropped rent price.

[18-Oct-18 02:34 AM] bishop#9773
Pirate isn't one person

[18-Oct-18 02:35 AM] DmanXX#2257
I don’t care about definition of ico

[18-Oct-18 02:35 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
Networkstats: Diff 497.9M | 137.3Msol/sec. I sold at 0.24 KMD with that stats 2 weeks ago

[18-Oct-18 02:36 AM] Flexatron#8809
Lmfao again

[18-Oct-18 02:36 AM] Flexatron#8809
Just buy more

[18-Oct-18 02:37 AM] Flexatron#8809
Its cheap

[18-Oct-18 02:37 AM] DmanXX#2257
I get it because of nicehash,

[18-Oct-18 02:37 AM] DmanXX#2257
Whatever

[18-Oct-18 02:37 AM] bishop#9773
Pirate is in price discovery mode

I love kmd and what they do I stand by them but pirate onboarding is a scam

[18-Oct-18 02:39 AM] bishop#9773
How do you figure it is a scam?

[18-Oct-18 02:39 AM] bishop#9773
is this from the same dictionary as your ICO definition

😆 

[18-Oct-18 02:39 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
If you rent the hash and mine the chain yourself, is it still a scam?

Dude I bought first kmd 11.64

[18-Oct-18 02:39 AM] DmanXX#2257
Went down I don’t have any problem with that, I buy more

[18-Oct-18 02:40 AM] bishop#9773
so where is the scam coming from?

[18-Oct-18 02:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I bought my first pirate at .165kmd

[18-Oct-18 02:40 AM] DmanXX#2257

[18-Oct-18 02:40 AM] freakbros#9074

[18-Oct-18 02:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I averaged down yesterday at .115

[18-Oct-18 02:40 AM] bishop#9773
I'm trying really hard to get dman's point

[18-Oct-18 02:43 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
“Scam” in cryptospace is analogous to “racist” in the political arena, it’s lost all meaning and is used by those who’ve run out of arguments

[18-Oct-18 02:43 AM] freakbros#9074
I bought way higher than u buddy just have to wait it out Fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

i dont have any NH orders for equihash active rn, but does the price adjustment via 'the arrows' from the marketplace view now also jump more than 0.01 down in equihash?

[18-Oct-18 06:56 AM] 0x03#8822
or is that scrypt only?

if the onboarding price is not to your taste, buy otc. it is for small amounts anyway, why such a fuss over a few dollars?

i have found complaining is a lot like 1/tech effect, the fewer the coins the louder and more they scream

if you cant handle a little 50% drop in KMD price, (less in fiat terms), what on earth are you doing buying a brand new coin without any exchange
