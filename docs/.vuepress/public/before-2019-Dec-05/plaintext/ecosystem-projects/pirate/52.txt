FYI, The ticker PRT is used by property token (never heard of it) and ARR is used by 2 projects (ARROUND and ARCADIA).

PIRATE whales, we need to donate so we can get more pirates

[26-Sep-18 11:06 AM] SHossain#0007
this is current community funds ^^

[26-Sep-18 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
@wookie is ARRR used by any other coin?

[26-Sep-18 11:15 AM] wookie#7663
@jl777c not that I can find. ARRR didn't seem to be used. Funny thing is in searching I found the  "Pirate Summit" ü§£

[26-Sep-18 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE peoples. make sure to have an offline backup of your privkey for your zaddr. use z_exportkey and keep it in a safe place

[26-Sep-18 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
also for the whales, plz donate some small percentage of your stash. onboarding is a critical part of the value building process

[26-Sep-18 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
just a few percent is enough to keep the new pirates joining

[26-Sep-18 11:18 AM] Mylo#8306

Arrrrrrrrrrrr. PIRATE whales ^^

[26-Sep-18 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
There is still 2 million PIRATE in taddr. maybe we can make a new blockchain rule that allows to confiscate just public displays of PIRATE if it isnt shielded within a few thousand blocks? then we would have plenty for onboarding

@jl777c Can you explain what you mean to "shield your pirates"?

[26-Sep-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are mining and have coinbase you need to shield it with z_shieldcoinbase

[26-Sep-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are not mining, then it isnt anything to worry about

[26-Sep-18 01:07 PM] wookie#7663
what if I'm mining it on the pool?

[26-Sep-18 01:08 PM] wookie#7663
how do I use z_shieldcoinbase?

[26-Sep-18 01:09 PM] SHossain#0007
if you are mining in a pool. you are already getting paid after the mined funds are shielded
