I don't scam anyone. I just sell ARRR for Blackbeark and he does not pay KMD for me

You know what. Why am i wasting time typing.

[04-Nov-18 06:25 PM] candy#2951
@Deleted User I sold 2435arrr = 267kmd for blackbeark. But he didn't pay me kmd

Blocked.  We're working hard here to build something.  We don't need to waste time with someone thinking they are clever and getting something for free through a scam.

[04-Nov-18 06:30 PM] candy#2951
It is true that the lies. I had to hire the rig to mining, but after selling I was robbed.

@Deleted User I thought you sent funds to his wallet?  txid is from wallet to wallet right?  Send it again.

Forget about Blackbeark. He's an assh0le. Always speaking in piratish.

@Deleted User Ok. I understood. I'm very thankful to you. You are a good person.

@webworker01 anything in particular to look at when setting up a pirate pool using knomp?

[04-Nov-18 08:00 PM] Oszy#5734
The instructions

{Reactions}
😄 

[04-Nov-18 08:08 PM] Outlier#8780
@webworker01  Thank you for all the explanations and how payments work once the system is saturated. I know increasing to 50 is a temporary work around.

[04-Nov-18 08:09 PM] Flexatron#8809
Lol

[04-Nov-18 08:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@webworker01 the readme needs to be changed off of `assetchains.old` to `assetchains` imo

[04-Nov-18 08:11 PM] mrlynch#5735
do i need to download all assetchains though? or is pirate enough?

[04-Nov-18 08:11 PM] mrlynch#5735
also... vultr or digitalocean? :?

[04-Nov-18 08:11 PM] mrlynch#5735
so i have to make it pirate specific 😄

[04-Nov-18 08:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`assetchains has a random start cpu mining`
True, but it also has a 20 sec delay between commands

{Reactions}
🤔 

[04-Nov-18 08:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
ok cool... thanks! thy work must begin

[04-Nov-18 08:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
i've just decommed my server :)) so i have to get a vps and see how it goes. 2 cpu 4 gb ram for starters? what d'you reckon?

[04-Nov-18 08:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@webworker01 I know you didn't but my point is that '.old' starts up like 300 gajillion daemons "all at once"

[04-Nov-18 08:15 PM] mrlynch#5735
ok to leave just pirate in assetchains.old?

[04-Nov-18 08:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it doesn't work for "lesser" VPSs

[04-Nov-18 08:16 PM] mrlynch#5735
min spec then?

[04-Nov-18 08:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
crashed mine earlier 😛

[04-Nov-18 08:16 PM] mrlynch#5735
ok

[04-Nov-18 08:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
what do you recommend as a minimum spec for the server?

[04-Nov-18 08:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has strat on 1 server and wallets on another_

[04-Nov-18 08:19 PM] mrlynch#5735
never started my own pool hence the questions so i do apologize if they seem dumb

[04-Nov-18 08:19 PM] mrlynch#5735
was never interested in a pool until now 😄

[04-Nov-18 08:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`how do i do that?`
there's this thing called a "configuration file" ....

[04-Nov-18 08:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```JSON
    "daemons": [
        {
            "host": "127.0.0.1",```
👆🏽 make it *not* that :trollface:

If anyone is looking for a lower payout pool, please consider http://minethepiratechain.black We are still looking for miners to come aboard :)

[04-Nov-18 08:27 PM] IsekiSolari#2059
Maybe, or maybe it's have volume on the exchange?

[04-Nov-18 08:28 PM] bishop#9773
Guessing it has to do with someone scripting it, not to mention now the onboarding price should be set to around the ask on DP

[04-Nov-18 08:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`not to mention now the onboarding price should be set to around the ask on DP`
Why?

[04-Nov-18 08:29 PM] bishop#9773
I think JL and Chmex where talking about it this morning

[04-Nov-18 08:30 PM] bishop#9773
to prevent people from buying on onboarding and selling on DP

[04-Nov-18 08:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dumpers quit dumping for pennies and the price will come back up

[04-Nov-18 08:30 PM] bishop#9773
I think this will help

[04-Nov-18 08:31 PM] Oszy#5734
Onboarding did not run out

[04-Nov-18 08:31 PM] Oszy#5734
777 was removed intentionally

[04-Nov-18 08:32 PM] Oszy#5734
So people don't buy it up all to sell on the exchange

[04-Nov-18 08:32 PM] AndrewK#3947
@FishyGuts I think we need an OTC channel - maybe for confirmed higher volume buyers & sellers

[04-Nov-18 08:33 PM] Llama#1330
what's the onboarding fund address? @webworker01

[04-Nov-18 08:33 PM] Llama#1330
nvm

[04-Nov-18 08:33 PM] AndrewK#3947
It's not good to do large volume trades on Digital Price - because of slippage (liquidity) and KYC requirements for $5k USD +

[04-Nov-18 08:33 PM] Llama#1330
@AndrewK you can still do OTC but there won't be a channel for it.

[04-Nov-18 08:33 PM] Oszy#5734
You can still do it just channel is closed

[04-Nov-18 08:34 PM] AndrewK#3947
@Llama I don't want to spam the main #pirate channel

[04-Nov-18 08:34 PM] Llama#1330
dont spam then 😛

[04-Nov-18 08:34 PM] AndrewK#3947
Happy to monitor the OTC channel if needed

[04-Nov-18 08:34 PM] bishop#9773
Maybe don't spam multi line offers then

[04-Nov-18 08:34 PM] Llama#1330
if people want to buy OTC they will find people selling OTC

[04-Nov-18 08:34 PM] bishop#9773
one line is suffice

[04-Nov-18 08:35 PM] AndrewK#3947
It's a competitive business out there. Gotta do what you can to eat :trollface:
