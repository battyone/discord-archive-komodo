Hey guys.  What is your FAVORITE blockchain/coin/token website?

[13-Nov-18 03:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Send me a link.   I'm trying to get some inspiration.

[13-Nov-18 03:08 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I despise all of them that are one, mile long page with section links (that seems to be the new trend in the last year or so)

[13-Nov-18 03:09 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
not sure I have a "favorite" though

One of our community members is putting on a GREAT contest to encourage spreading the hashrate.
Take a moment to read this and learn how to win a one of a kind Pirate Shirt, Hoodie or hat and $ARRR prizes.

@FishyGuts my main b@tch with web sites are not having the core basics up front. What are we looking for? what's our demographic of the person visiting the site? I hate having to scroll down and look through a conviluded mess trying to find the wallet link. Keep that wallet link at the top nice and large

[13-Nov-18 07:22 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Hopefully it will start simple.  We will add more verbiage and info as needed.  It will be very basic to start though.

[13-Nov-18 07:24 AM] CiPhEr#2091
maybe like a 'start in 1...2...3  with 1 being agama download, 2 being exchange / onboarding option, 3 being discord

[13-Nov-18 07:24 AM] CiPhEr#2091
or a variation thereof

[13-Nov-18 07:28 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Across the top is a header - Home - Wallets - Exchanges - Mining -

[13-Nov-18 07:28 AM] FishyGuts#5085
And that stays put when you scroll.

[13-Nov-18 07:29 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The Github - Social - mining tabs don't open new pages, they just have dropdowns.

[13-Nov-18 07:30 AM] FishyGuts#5085
When my webdev wakes up he will get to work on it, even if I am sleeping.  I gave him directions.

[13-Nov-18 07:32 AM] CiPhEr#2091
awesome! yeah with an impressive website that will definitely help generate interest when people stop by to check out project

[13-Nov-18 07:33 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It‚Äôs gonna have room to grow I promise that.

[13-Nov-18 07:34 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Still working on material for it.  Have to get with a vid maker about a privacy video and a explain like I am 5 years old video about how pirate tech works.

[13-Nov-18 07:34 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@FishyGuts  what you think instead of promiting medium art on twitter to a chain like twitter->reddit->medium or wtitter->reddit->steemit (meaning first create reddit on big subreddit), then linkt the reddit article ? This way we could get bigger exp maybe on reddit crypto? And people in the end go the article too ?

[13-Nov-18 07:34 AM] CiPhEr#2091
i don't know if you've ever seen the style of the game guild wars 2, if you ever check out their website / game they use a lot of anime style 'drawing while page loads / scrolls' very visually cool

[13-Nov-18 07:35 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
not sure if we loose some % of readers due to too many links, but if made properly could work good ?

[13-Nov-18 07:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã I did that on my post this morning if you notice. üëç

[13-Nov-18 07:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Sort of.  I didn‚Äôt go SUPER deep on the links but I posted all formats at the same time.

[13-Nov-18 07:36 AM] CiPhEr#2091
something like that with a pirate ship type feel

[13-Nov-18 07:36 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[13-Nov-18 08:34 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The website I need built for a project I‚Äôm doing... community stepping forward.

[13-Nov-18 08:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I get offers at least once a day for help, advice, fine tuning and all kinds of great people saying all kinds of great things about ways they think the project could be better.

[13-Nov-18 08:36 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Just because I don‚Äôt do them immediately doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt write the ideas down, or tell someone else who could benefit and use them later.

[13-Nov-18 08:36 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It‚Äôs really great to have so many people step forward.   Did you see that most of our medium articles come in 10 different languages?

[13-Nov-18 08:37 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We had the .8 BTC needed for the crex listing in less than 2 hours.
