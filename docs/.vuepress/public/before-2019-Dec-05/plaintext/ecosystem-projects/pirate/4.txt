Hmmm 🤔

[30-Aug-18 01:48 PM] Alright#0419
god that is annoying, i just tried to reorg those 5 coin blocks *twice*, tried to broadcast a longer chain and my selfish node reorged to the shorter chain

[30-Aug-18 01:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Pirates :trollface:

[30-Aug-18 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant mine directly to a z addr

[30-Aug-18 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
so the coinbase -> t address is possible?

[30-Aug-18 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
that seems like what happened

[30-Aug-18 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it wasnt a z->t

[30-Aug-18 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
Just made a 1000 coin fee z transaction and mined that block to whatever address i wanted

👌 

[30-Aug-18 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it was a coinbase -> t

[30-Aug-18 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, yes txfees are t-addr

[30-Aug-18 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
as it goes through coinbase

[30-Aug-18 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
so it isnt 100% z

[30-Aug-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
briliant

[30-Aug-18 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
and if you cant control when it is mined it is a risk, so you need a special miner that mines your own custom tx to do this

[30-Aug-18 01:54 PM] Alright#0419
I can control that

[30-Aug-18 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
why not build in an atomic swap protocol to the mining -> coinbase -> taddr!

[30-Aug-18 02:12 PM] Alright#0419

[30-Aug-18 02:12 PM] Alright#0419

I mined 3 blocks overnight, damn you scoundrels and your mini's

[30-Aug-18 03:50 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 where does nomp get the `blockReward` value from? I figured it was `"coinbasevalue"` but that doesn't seem to be the case

[30-Aug-18 03:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
i mined the first block within seconds of joining the chain

[30-Aug-18 03:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright nomp uses arguments in the `getblocktemplate`, so the daemon returns a different JSON than if you just did `getblocktemplate` via cli
`var blockReward = (this.rpcData.miner) * 100000000`

[30-Aug-18 03:56 PM] Alright#0419
I don't understand

[30-Aug-18 03:57 PM] Alright#0419
how is it getting a different number than what is specified in the block template
