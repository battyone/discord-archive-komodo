ARRR will be on CMC as soon as it is listed by another exchange which again, is being worked on

Welcome @FrancoMontana - I appreciate your open and honest feedback.   The website does need to be redone.  It's "functional" and that's what mattered to start.   I have a web dev who would probably cost an arm and a leg to hire alone, making a very secure site.  We just put a simple page up and it needs a lot of work still yes.   I can't really argue with this and there are no excuses, just reasons.  My challenges are funding and time.   We should be able to buckle down and have it done in the next week or so.  
One of the challenges was art for the site which we received last week.   Will get the rest of the words and explanatory stuff up shortly.  Thank you for bringing attention to it.  

We would need to SEO into the search Piratecoin - but we haven't.   We don't use that term or phrase.   There is already a "piratecoin" someone tried to make years ago and it died.

CMC can't be supported without supporting exchanges.   I have tried to facilitate getting Digital Price on to Coin Market Cap to no avail.  I even tried to get it done withthe Onboarding API... no luck.

Team page in the works.   It's a lot more complex than it seems, especially with a truly decentralized project. 

KMD devs absolutely understand what they made.  The fifth message from JL to me when we started talking was *"arguably the most private combined with most secure"* 

"Probably is only about marketing, user friendly and time" - Yep... pretty much.   There has been no shortage of growth and interest in the project.

We're gonna keep pressing hard and doing things that are going to not only make the coin look good but grow as well.  It's a balance for certain and we will continue to welcome constructive criticism and comments such as these.

[16-Nov-18 09:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I guess I could have like, a super cool lookng webpage that checks off these lists and roadmarkers....  Maybe I should get an art guy on it.
But I would rather spend a day working on list items than making a feelgood page to say "HEY LOOK WHAT WERE GOING TO DO!!"

[16-Nov-18 10:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I dunno, maybe my approach is wrong, or needs to be revisited for this piece.
We probably should start to do that as some of these items start to be longer term projects or integrations.

It would acttually be a benefit to give people an idea of when things may happen as they start to take longer to complete.

[16-Nov-18 10:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But putting a release date on development is often the kiss of death, yes?

[16-Nov-18 10:01 PM] BlockTech#6895
Well, it attract investors indeed, when you don't have a "good looking" website, some people don't event try to understand they just look and say oh, ok, no front-end, i can't even imagine back end.

[16-Nov-18 10:09 PM] FrancoMontana#1536
Well @FishyGuts, first thank you for the answer. Glad to see your commitment. I see you have already noticed many of the problems i pointed out. I agree about CMC, we can't get it right now. Lottery is nice , referrals too, but probably i would do it later. Priority, considering that developing is almost completed, is site and seo. First because site and wp are the appearance of the project, you need at least a bit of appeal. I'm sorry to say but if i watch the site now i think is a ponzi mining coin. The seo, cause to find the site i need 5 min, join discord, go to pin message, click and refresh till site opens.... Another consideration, is sad the team doesn't have many funds, this will slow down the process. Any solution? This is the sad side of no premine

[16-Nov-18 10:10 PM] FrancoMontana#1536
And about the mining consideration, i still didn't buy because of that. Hard to find informations to do right calculations

[16-Nov-18 10:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We will certainly push the website up higher.   There is no excuse for it now that lots of our pressing engagements and work has been fulfilled.

[16-Nov-18 10:12 PM] FrancoMontana#1536
What is the word you are workin on seo?

Pirate coin is not a bad idea to try and push up the SEO pages...

[16-Nov-18 10:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But we dont want to associate iwth the seemingly dead piratecoin.

Have to have a structure to the site that won't change for awhile before SEO

[16-Nov-18 10:37 PM] Flexatron#8809
There is already a lot of backlinks from social media going to pirate.black

[16-Nov-18 10:37 PM] Flexatron#8809
But yea we need to keep an eye on the keywords

[16-Nov-18 10:37 PM] Flexatron#8809
And making sure the website reflects that

[16-Nov-18 10:53 PM] crumb#2550
i have watched the website/seo discussions for the sidelines for a while now.  i have worked in seo / web marketing agencies and have over 10 years experience. 

the term seo is a bit of misleading last couple of years already. sure there are some 'must have' technical things that are seo specific, but we really need to take a more holistic 'big picture' view. 

firstly regarding content. the way to get better discoverability/positions is using to 'long tail' approach. that means having a lot of good content on the actual pirate.black website. otherwise a lot of good links (google link juice) point to other sources. at the moment that is medium. all these comparison articles (xmr vs arrr, xvg vs arrr etc) are pure gold in terms of having good content with just the right search phrases people look for.

of course some 'main' keywords like 'pirate coin', 'privacy crypto' and some others deserve extra attention, but there is no point stopping there.

secondly. as there are no universal google result positions anymore (it depends on user location, language settings, device type, previous search history etc) it is all about 'USER TASK ACCOMPLISHMENT'
of course different users want different things, but it is not too complicated to start with the most obvious ones:
- info about the coin (max and current supply, block time, mining algo, stuff like that)
- info about wallet(s)
- info for potential miners
- info about exchanges
- some people want the comparisons with other privacy coins
-etc

the tricky thing is how to divide this info onto different pages as the popular 'one-pager' solution favoured by so many crypto projects is terrible idea from digital marketing / seo / usability standpoint

@FishyGuts my Brave browser just notified me that it is going to disburse the "free" BATs that it gives me monthly for trying out Brave. I want to send it all to Pirate.black. I imagine if many of us diehard Pirates that use Brave send their monthly free allotment of BAT to pirate.black in the coming months, it would be a decent addition to the pirate fund.  If this is something you're interested in, someone needs to register pirate.black with Brave to receive payments.
