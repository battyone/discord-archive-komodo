I have a lot of coins on different distributed servers.

[13-Oct-18 03:27 PM] TheMiningPool#9076
becaouse its easy to move it.

[13-Oct-18 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@TheMiningPool On your PC, even if you're running Agama for GUI, it's best to use the actual cli if you want cli (rather than using agama's passthrough "cli")

[13-Oct-18 03:29 PM] TheMiningPool#9076
but its ok. You are free to think whatever you want 😃

[13-Oct-18 03:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User many cheaper hosting services use dynamic - you get what you pay for

[13-Oct-18 03:30 PM] TheMiningPool#9076
no worries 😃 I'll remove Pirates if no one wants to mine it lol.

[13-Oct-18 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, since you're giving up in less than 5 minutes, I'm glad I didn't do it 🤦🏼

[13-Oct-18 03:31 PM] TheMiningPool#9076
XD!!

[13-Oct-18 03:31 PM] TheMiningPool#9076
na. Remember I have no fees.

[13-Oct-18 03:32 PM] TheMiningPool#9076
I'm doing this just for fun and for support cryptos and get some donations. Nothing else.

[13-Oct-18 03:32 PM] Flexatron#8809
Cool

[13-Oct-18 03:33 PM] TheMiningPool#9076

[13-Oct-18 03:34 PM] TheMiningPool#9076

[13-Oct-18 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I liked it a decade ago

[13-Oct-18 03:35 PM] TheMiningPool#9076
yea, well... not very much else to choose

[13-Oct-18 03:38 PM] TheMiningPool#9076
Is there only 1 pool for Pirate now?

[13-Oct-18 03:38 PM] TheMiningPool#9076

[13-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Flexatron#8809

Miners in a walmart bag; how cute

[13-Oct-18 06:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"grow tent"? Do you water them daily or twice a week?

[13-Oct-18 06:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085

850 cfm of air flow NOT going into my garage.   That’s why.

[13-Oct-18 06:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
My electric bill dropped when I stopped having to AC the whole house because of my rigs.

[13-Oct-18 06:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
850 cfm? are you trying to kill them before you get them paid off?

[13-Oct-18 06:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The exhaust fans.  850 cubic feet per minute

[13-Oct-18 07:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a standard PC fan moves 150-200, 850 is like nothing

[13-Oct-18 07:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Hmm

[13-Oct-18 07:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I certainly feel like these two units pump WAY more than 6 pc fans.

[13-Oct-18 07:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But I have no calculations to back that up

[13-Oct-18 07:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Plus they were 50$ each.  Not much more than the needed pc fans to match.

[13-Oct-18 07:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yeah they’re all ducted and sealed.   I am gonna run the exhausts into the house when it gets colder.

[13-Oct-18 07:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏼

[13-Oct-18 07:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when you get more than a couple, you'll begin to appreciate that they aren't "space heaters" :trollface:

[13-Oct-18 07:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yeah.  Agreed.   My garage sits at 90* Fahrenheit on 70* days.

[13-Oct-18 07:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's 50F out and we're still running the evap unit on ours 😛

[13-Oct-18 07:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If I had more, a permanent heat solution would be required.

[13-Oct-18 07:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
What are you running 50-100 units?

[13-Oct-18 07:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I have considered a zone damper to push air through home in winter, but distance to mining building is far enough that I decided against a $9k heat system 😛

[13-Oct-18 07:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just under 50 now, getting some A9s soon

[13-Oct-18 07:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fek, my GPUs push just as much heat 😛

[13-Oct-18 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_hmmmmmmms at the idea of a 13 GPU workstation .....
🤔_

[13-Oct-18 07:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's no tariff if shipper codes it correctly

[13-Oct-18 07:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I tried that on the last shipment, DHL told me to pound sand.

[13-Oct-18 07:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Craigslist webworker. I’m negotiating on 4 units right now with someone.

[13-Oct-18 07:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just because I was bored enough to look....
at 6k RPM, each BM fan pushes 190 CFM
so, for a 1/2 dozen not running full OC, you might be alright

[13-Oct-18 07:58 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I want to make an aircrete mining facility, as it is the best insulator I've found yet. So with a nice exhaust system and FAE it'd be great for those conditions.

[13-Oct-18 08:18 PM] Flexatron#8809
KMD cheap

[13-Oct-18 10:04 PM] Buddz1993#5380
99 cents 🤑

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 around what size is your farm? If you don’t mind me asking.

[13-Oct-18 10:24 PM] Zach#9973
Just under 50 units
