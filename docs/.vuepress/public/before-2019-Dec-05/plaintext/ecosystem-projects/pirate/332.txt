Yes you did,  You expected to be able to help.   You expected that the time and effort you put in would be more effective.  
Sometimes it happens that we do not get done what we wanted, but as long as we learn and teach and keep trying, it's the best outcome we can hope for and I appreciate your time and effort!

there is now in FSM branch sapling enabled with support for acprivate chains. it needs a good solid testing to make sure it behaves as it should, but it is down to bug fixes and we will have a PIRATE that is sapling enabled

[23-Nov-18 06:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have a rig or two to point at it if needed.

[23-Nov-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
the sapling testing needed is to make sure an acprivate chain works as it should

[23-Nov-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
we also need to get the pools sapling ready

[23-Nov-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
there will also be a z_migrate that each node has to run to convert all sprout funds into sapling. there will be a strict timelimit for people to complete this process, so we will need user videos to show how to use agama console to issue the rpc call

[23-Nov-18 06:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Strict timeframe to be announced folks... don't worry üòõ

So you‚Äôre saying your script shows pirate as 11x more price effective to buy right now vs renting hash?

[23-Nov-18 07:36 PM] ronyi#5719
I think no. ~50kmd profit(current price, current hash), if renting hash, but missing renting hash price.

[23-Nov-18 07:41 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`So you‚Äôre saying your script shows pirate as 11x more price effective to buy right now vs renting hash?`
I'm saying that the cost to mine is 0.05603905 and the buy price is 0.06100001
nothing more, nothing less

[23-Nov-18 07:42 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
just used 10k as a "base" because whole numbers round better

[23-Nov-18 07:43 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`but missing renting hash price.`
at the time I posted that,

When setting up the agama wallet you need to ‚Äòactivate‚Äô a coin, which one do I select?

[23-Nov-18 08:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have experienced that I need to setup Komodo in Lite or Native, and then in the GUI I select pirate as a second coin to activate, in native only.

[23-Nov-18 08:59 PM] dwx#9071
Great thanks buddy

suggestion for the next Agama release: please use the new P logo. no reason to rush a new release because of that, but it would be nice to have an 'official' logo in the wallet, whenever new Agama comes out

Empty the cache in the app, it won't work.  The way it looks, Medium blocked you.  So it was with me.  Contact the support.  With me it was the Spamfilter.  I was then unlocked again.

[23-Nov-18 10:25 PM] crumb#2550
one reason that pops into my mind is that quite a lot of that content i have seen/read already on different medium articles. perhaps they didn't like that? how much did you use already published content anyway @FishyGuts when giving answers?

this is just a hunch and it could be not an issue at all. just trying to find possible explanations

[23-Nov-18 10:26 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Every interview has been hand answered.  Only copied Tiny sections from one to the other.

[23-Nov-18 10:26 PM] Seko#7408
A combination of words in the article that are in the spam filter was probably the trigger for you, too.

[23-Nov-18 10:26 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I spent 4 hours on the last one.
