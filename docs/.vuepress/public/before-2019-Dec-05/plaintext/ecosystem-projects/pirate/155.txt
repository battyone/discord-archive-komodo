imagine an automated and gamified system that gets people to actively motivated to onboard others

[12-Oct-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
once it achieves a metric of 1.03 new onboards per onboard, then it is basically viral and reaches market saturation

[12-Oct-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
to complain about the short term issues, is like complaining about the scorch marks on the launch pad, after having a successful rocket launch

On another note, I have had all my `z_mergeaddress` commands processing for about 10 hrs and i'm a couple hours off finishing

[12-Oct-18 10:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, part of the "problem" is that most people cannot tell the difference between what is short and long term

[12-Oct-18 10:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
10 hrs? fek @NutellaLicka how many UTXOs you got?

[12-Oct-18 10:26 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I started with about 1200 `remaining notes`

1250 would take like 30-40 minutes from t>t on my vm, I can't imagine how long it would take in z

[12-Oct-18 10:30 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeahhhh, I didn't realise I had that many, I guess that's what I get for mining. I have now cronjob'd it every hour

[12-Oct-18 10:30 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Good advice for miners

I was wondering why I couldn't send any coins

offering  .1 kmd per for pirate otc seems like enough of an escape hatch for anyone. if they need it automated via website then they shouldn't have the pirate in the first place.

[12-Oct-18 10:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I really should cron my shields and merges, but I like to over-micromanage everything 😛

[12-Oct-18 10:57 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
haha, aint nobody got time for that

theres a new load pattern on my pool, whcih is different from the errors i had on the old setup (wich i consider solved). one of the miners MAY have an issue with his HW, but i couldn't track it down to a payout addr  yet

[12-Oct-18 11:27 AM] 0x03#8822
it's not as obvious as 'check your efficiency, dewd'

[12-Oct-18 11:28 AM] 0x03#8822
altho i have to admit on the first glance to me it just looked like the old errors from the old pool were back, which they luckily aint.

[12-Oct-18 11:29 AM] 0x03#8822
it may however just be 'NH misbehaving' time again

[12-Oct-18 12:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

The only problem I have with using ARRR for stuff like that @Dr Debt is something we talked about in STAKED yesterday. The fact that 99.999% of usage is legal, it only takes that fractional amount for jackwagons to get on some platform with a megaphone and start shouting "See we told you that they just want to use it to hide criminal activities". 😣

[12-Oct-18 12:46 PM] 0x03#8822
all it needs is clever asking on how the most popular form of currency, cash, protects from that

[12-Oct-18 12:46 PM] 0x03#8822
🤣

[12-Oct-18 12:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 There's a much larger picture to life than my personal margin and someone willing to be happy making 12 cents a block profit. Larger prices bring more miners and more hash (which is better for the coin in 100 different ways)

[12-Oct-18 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@0x03 You can't ask the guy on the news that's already broadcasting to a few million people at a time, that would be like fair and shit. 😕

[12-Oct-18 12:52 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Yeah

[12-Oct-18 12:52 PM] Dr Debt#0891
My response would be “prove it”

[12-Oct-18 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

a non-tradable currency is useless for this our mining activity will end today until pirate coin ARRR will not make clarity

no one wants to buy

[12-Oct-18 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there are buyers, plenty of them; they are just waiting to see how low silly folks are going to drag the price

[12-Oct-18 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's the result of literally dropping the price every couple hrs

[12-Oct-18 01:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
This is a lull moment between euphoria and development coming to light.  The recent price drops haven’t helped

[12-Oct-18 01:31 PM] BlockTech#6895
I think it's more a price correction, we got to hyped with hashrate increasing (for now, at the actual stage of the coin)

[12-Oct-18 01:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
how do you know there is plenty of buyrs waiting to buy lower?  the result is the same like there is no buyer currently, no liquidity

[12-Oct-18 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@BlockTech 60% of the "missing" hash is because the price is too low to support it

[12-Oct-18 01:32 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so the otc price in calculator is misleading some miners potentially - they start mining , come here, no one wants to buy

[12-Oct-18 01:32 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so ti means people have some reasons to expect price dump ?

[12-Oct-18 01:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 I know there are buyers because I have sales

[12-Oct-18 01:32 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
did you have some sales since 2 days ago ?

[12-Oct-18 01:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
less than 12 hrs ago

[12-Oct-18 01:33 PM] BlockTech#6895
I think , it's because none wants to buy a those price. A miner that can't sell, just move to another coin.. That's why we "loosed" hashrate (my opinion)

[12-Oct-18 01:33 PM] BlockTech#6895
Ok

[12-Oct-18 01:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so ti means people have some reasons to expect price dump ?`
yes, that reason is:
`they can read`

[12-Oct-18 01:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@BlockTech Your opinion is skewed by the fact that you're wrong.
That miner didn't move anywhere, he just can't afford to dump that much cost every day for nominal returns

[12-Oct-18 01:37 PM] BlockTech#6895
ok. But a miner with a Z9 mini is still more than 8 times over his expense.

Not a single coin has that much of a high ROI by mining.

[12-Oct-18 01:37 PM] BlockTech#6895
(sorry for my bad english)

[12-Oct-18 01:38 PM] BlockTech#6895
I understand, mining for 10ct a day is ridiculous, but mining calculator are saying with actual price it's still over 8$ a day

[12-Oct-18 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, a hobby miner can cover his $23 electric bill nicely
larger miners have additional bills (networking, additional hardware, etc) and larger bills

[12-Oct-18 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
**plus**
the calculator assumes that hashrate is already included on the network

[12-Oct-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we should lower the price that is sent to the mining so they dont have crazy expectations

[12-Oct-18 01:42 PM] 0x03#8822
i like how the term `hobbyist` is slowly turned into an insult 🤣

[12-Oct-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
