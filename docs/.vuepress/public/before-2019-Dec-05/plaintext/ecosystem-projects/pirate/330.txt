web and I can just do our own chain if you like

[23-Nov-18 02:53 PM] ronyi#5719
then do it and i stop this chain

[23-Nov-18 02:53 PM] Alright#0419
if you just stop the chain and use that branch and restart the nodes, we can sync it

[23-Nov-18 02:53 PM] Alright#0419
if not, it's fine. We'll just do another chain

[23-Nov-18 02:54 PM] ronyi#5719
okay. stop chain. clone branch edit timestamp, build and start

[23-Nov-18 02:54 PM] Alright#0419
the timestamp is edited already

[23-Nov-18 02:55 PM] Alright#0419
just stop chain, build from that branch, start chain with that build

[23-Nov-18 02:55 PM] ronyi#5719
okay. i do

[23-Nov-18 02:55 PM] Alright#0419
thank you, sorry for making that a bit more complicated for you

[23-Nov-18 03:16 PM] ronyi#5719
no problem

[23-Nov-18 03:17 PM] Alright#0419
let me know when you have nodes up

[23-Nov-18 03:17 PM] Alright#0419
ready to sync from them

[23-Nov-18 03:25 PM] ronyi#5719
Done

[23-Nov-18 03:28 PM] Alright#0419

Might need a new chain, didn't think pushing back the timestamp before it was activated would do anything

[23-Nov-18 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
@ronyi did you stop the chain before your timestamp past?

[23-Nov-18 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
the one that you set

[23-Nov-18 03:29 PM] ronyi#5719
yes. i stop now

[23-Nov-18 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
I'm just going to create another

[23-Nov-18 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
want to get it going before the timestamp

[23-Nov-18 03:29 PM] ronyi#5719
okay

[23-Nov-18 03:41 PM] Alright#0419
see if you can sync that

[23-Nov-18 03:42 PM] Alright#0419
I wasn't able to

[23-Nov-18 03:42 PM] Alright#0419
I'm thinking it activated sapling already then we pushed the timestamp back and it broke

[23-Nov-18 03:45 PM] Alright#0419
haven't been able to start it yet, one of my machines ran out of HDD space >.<

[23-Nov-18 03:45 PM] Alright#0419
small chance I might need to push it back again

[23-Nov-18 03:45 PM] Alright#0419
one node is up and waiting
`./komodod -ac_name=ARRRT -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=195.201.20.230 -addnode=195.201.137.5`

[23-Nov-18 03:46 PM] Alright#0419
connect and start mining if you can

[23-Nov-18 03:47 PM] Alright#0419
there we go

[23-Nov-18 03:47 PM] Alright#0419
started

[23-Nov-18 03:47 PM] ronyi#5719

[23-Nov-18 03:48 PM] Alright#0419
your node accepting these blocks just fine?

[23-Nov-18 03:49 PM] ronyi#5719
yes.

[23-Nov-18 03:50 PM] Alright#0419
got the same thing on my second node while trying to sync 
```

[23-Nov-18 03:51 PM] Alright#0419
fairly sure that's because of an unrelated bug

[23-Nov-18 03:51 PM] Alright#0419
new node refusing to sync thing again

[23-Nov-18 03:55 PM] Alright#0419

[23-Nov-18 03:55 PM] Alright#0419
that's expected behavior so far

[23-Nov-18 03:55 PM] Alright#0419
were you able to sync another node?

[23-Nov-18 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i am investigating that bug. it appears to happen on short chains at the beginning. i think once the chain gets long enough people will be able to sync to it

[23-Nov-18 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
hopefully i can fix the bug too

[23-Nov-18 03:56 PM] Alright#0419
yes, that seems to be the case

[23-Nov-18 03:56 PM] Alright#0419
not sure if this is helpful, but if you stop mining on the chain and leave new nodes in the hanging state, they sync eventually

[23-Nov-18 04:02 PM] Alright#0419
is there a specific way to generate a sapling address?

[23-Nov-18 04:02 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c should `z_getnewaddress` produce sapling addresses after activation?

[23-Nov-18 04:03 PM] Alright#0419
aha thank you

[23-Nov-18 04:06 PM] Alright#0419
@ronyi what block height do you have

[23-Nov-18 04:07 PM] ronyi#5719
45

[23-Nov-18 04:08 PM] Alright#0419
restarted my node, can't reconnect

[23-Nov-18 04:08 PM] Alright#0419
going to leave it and see what happens

[23-Nov-18 04:08 PM] ronyi#5719
My secound node just hanging. First node working well

[23-Nov-18 04:08 PM] Alright#0419
how to test whether sapling was truly activated? I tried a z_shieldcoinbase and it failed with sapling address

[23-Nov-18 04:09 PM] Alright#0419
then tested with sprout address and tried to kill it because I did `"*"` without thinking about it

[23-Nov-18 04:09 PM] Alright#0419
you're the only node now ðŸ˜›

[23-Nov-18 04:09 PM] Alright#0419
I think if you stop mining and just let it sit, our new nodes will sync eventually

[23-Nov-18 04:10 PM] Alright#0419
seems to take 15-30 minutes of no blocks

[23-Nov-18 04:11 PM] Alright#0419
ok, I think it's best to try this on non ac_private chain first

[23-Nov-18 04:11 PM] ronyi#5719
okay stop mining my node

[23-Nov-18 04:11 PM] Alright#0419
don't stop the node

[23-Nov-18 04:11 PM] Alright#0419
just stop mining on it

[23-Nov-18 04:11 PM] ronyi#5719
yes yes

[23-Nov-18 04:17 PM] Flexatron#8809
Guess I can rewrite the sapling part in the WP soon when it works

[23-Nov-18 04:29 PM] Alright#0419
ok, I'm going to start a chain with no ac_private, let it get a good amount of blocks, we can all connect to it *then* restart with a different timestamp

[23-Nov-18 04:29 PM] Alright#0419
the problem seems to be with newly started chains, so let's try to get around that for now

[23-Nov-18 04:34 PM] ronyi#5719

ping me when I can test it please @jl777c

Confirming, received my deposit back from crex24. Glad they got their stuff sorted out! Thanks @FishyGuts if you had anything to do with it!

[23-Nov-18 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810

[23-Nov-18 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
pull FSM branch, change the sapling timestamp to "now"

[23-Nov-18 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
in 30 blocks, it will set the activation block to 60 blocks from the 30 blocks ago

[23-Nov-18 04:50 PM] Alright#0419
@ronyi @webworker01 you guys still around? Ready to try this again?

[23-Nov-18 04:50 PM] ronyi#5719
Yes. i building on my secound node

[23-Nov-18 04:50 PM] Alright#0419
need to change the timestamp

[23-Nov-18 04:50 PM] Alright#0419
was going to do it in that same branch

[23-Nov-18 04:51 PM] Alright#0419
just want to make sure we have the same timestamp

need to update it, couple minutes

[23-Nov-18 04:54 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c just want to make sure I get this correct. I'll change the timestamp to a few minutes in the future(enough time to build and create chain)?

[23-Nov-18 04:54 PM] Alright#0419
all that is needed, yes?

[23-Nov-18 04:55 PM] Alright#0419
we want the chain to be moving as we hit the timestamp

[23-Nov-18 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[23-Nov-18 04:58 PM] ronyi#5719
@Alright timestamp?

[23-Nov-18 05:00 PM] Alright#0419
I didn't change the timestamp yet

[23-Nov-18 05:00 PM] ronyi#5719
i changed: 1542992358

[23-Nov-18 05:03 PM] Alright#0419
is in the past already

[23-Nov-18 05:05 PM] Alright#0419
changed it to 55 minutes from now, you can create your own chain if you don't want to use my branch

[23-Nov-18 05:05 PM] Alright#0419
@ronyi we want the chain to be running already as that time passes

[23-Nov-18 05:06 PM] ronyi#5719
@Alright pls send your timestamp

might be best not to include ac_private, so we can do z -> t if we have to
