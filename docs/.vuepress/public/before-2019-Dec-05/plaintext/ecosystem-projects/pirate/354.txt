@jl777c @Oliver Westbrook brought up a good point about timing analysis being done on people using the migrate dapp. Could you add an option to do smaller amounts instead of the entire wallet?

[30-Nov-18 09:13 PM] Alright#0419
or maybe we'll just organize a day where we encourage everyone to do it at once?

[30-Nov-18 09:13 PM] Alright#0419
really doesn't matter in grand scheme of things, but if it's a simple addition, would be worth it

[30-Nov-18 09:21 PM] jl777c#5810
it caps at 10000 PIRATE

[30-Nov-18 09:21 PM] jl777c#5810
if your wallet is more than 10000, then it would do it in 10000 increments

lewl... guess i'll archive my wallet as well 😀 never know when RKT might reach $1000 :)) provided the asset chain still lives

[30-Nov-18 11:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as long as 1 copy of the chain exists, the chain lives

[30-Nov-18 11:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
btw @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i've noticed that as tx count increases so does execution time (not by a lot and i'm assuming it's normal) ... confirm normal?

[30-Nov-18 11:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
i've sent multiple 50 RKT txs and sent back in 1 lump sum

[30-Nov-18 11:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's still awfully quicker than sprout but getting around 50 secs exec time

[01-Dec-18 11:36 AM] gets#8925
hey

[01-Dec-18 11:37 AM] gets#8925
so is pirate a part of komodo or how does that work?

[01-Dec-18 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Pirate uses the komodo platform (including komodo dPoW), but is a stand-alone chain

[01-Dec-18 11:39 AM] gets#8925
ok, what does it mean that it ‘uses’ the komodo platform? if u dont feel like explaining can u point me to some reading material? 😛

[01-Dec-18 11:41 AM] gets#8925
also greetings to whoever I was just chatting with on twitter, seemed like a cool guy 😃

[01-Dec-18 11:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Komodo, itself, allows chains to be spawned that are not KMD but use the code of Komodo to create a new chain. The main advantage of doing this over forking the Komodo code is that this give the independent chains near-instant updates and the entire dev backing of Komodo

[01-Dec-18 11:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
among other benefits

[01-Dec-18 11:43 AM] gets#8925
is there a cost for that?

[01-Dec-18 11:43 AM] gets#8925
or how does it work if u change stuff and it breaks when komodo pushes an update?

[01-Dec-18 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You can change stuff and maintain complete autonomy (like Veruscoin does) or never change anything an just update as Komodo does

[01-Dec-18 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
PIRATE does the latter with updates being pushed to Komodo as needed

[01-Dec-18 11:46 AM] FishyGuts#5085
AFAIK the only costs under KMD are the annual dPoW costs.  
I believe you can launch a chain free of charge, yes @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ?

[01-Dec-18 11:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yes, chains are free (in fact on an average week I spin up 20-30 new chains for testing), but dPoW does cost because it costs to operate dPoW

[01-Dec-18 11:46 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The KMD team and chain teams offer integration services which would be a separate cost/fee based on the services they specifically offer.

[01-Dec-18 11:48 AM] FishyGuts#5085
But as an example pirate was launched free and pays for dPoW. 
We benefit from Komodo in many ways.   Dev costs and times are exponentially reduced in many cases.  Most recently, the Verus coin project implemented Sapling and has given their work to Komodo.   Now Komodo is integrating the activation date for 12/15 and after that, asset chains can adopt the new changes.   So pirate will adopt the initial sapling integration.

[01-Dec-18 11:49 AM] gets#8925
I see, but aren’t u then over reliant on upstream updates?

[01-Dec-18 11:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Pirate can focus on going forward with further advancements like zSPV wallet development.   Otherwise we would be working furiously to get devs to integrate Sapling still.

[01-Dec-18 11:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
No. We could perform these tasks as well.

[01-Dec-18 11:50 AM] gets#8925
do u have a plan in place for funding if thats ever needed?

[01-Dec-18 11:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It would take time money and effort.

[01-Dec-18 11:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sapling updates are a perfect example of why to use an assetchain over forking - all the dev, debugging, and testing is essentially done pro bono

[01-Dec-18 11:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes.  We have some of the mining pools designating funds from their fees.   All exchanges we get in we have a ref link we use to refer for use.  The on boarding program is probably our biggest generation of revenue.

[01-Dec-18 11:51 AM] gets#8925
on boarding program?

[01-Dec-18 11:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It’s being revamped and should be launched by 1/1.  

You can see it now in the pins.   Dexstats.onboarding.

[01-Dec-18 11:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
People can pay a small amount more for ARRR there, and the excess helps fund the project.   Kind of like a donation.

[01-Dec-18 11:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We have a new feature to that being prepped and readied and should be active by 12/31.

[01-Dec-18 11:52 AM] gets#8925
I see

[01-Dec-18 11:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[01-Dec-18 11:53 AM] FishyGuts#5085

You can see the article in #deleted-channel @gets

[01-Dec-18 11:54 AM] gets#8925
yea with Veil too, we don’t have a whitepaper yet either hehe

[01-Dec-18 11:55 AM] gets#8925
our chain hasn’t even launched yet and we have a bunch of interest

[01-Dec-18 11:55 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I saw that.   Finally another actual privacy coin.  Lots of moving parts to the protocol.   Interested to see how it all is going to come together.

[01-Dec-18 11:56 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Were privacy fans here.   Even XMR gets our love even though their probably our toughest tech challenge for now.

[01-Dec-18 11:56 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It’s not about being better than them or anyone else, it’s about getting a solid privacy protocol in the hands of people to use to protect themselves.
