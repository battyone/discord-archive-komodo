If a bunch of newcomers come to buy Pirate, then that will also pump the price of KMD. It‚Äôs the Ethereum effect.

[30-Oct-18 05:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

Just ask me in otc
Will trade in otc

It would be great to have a tool to airdrop Pirate to people that don't have Agama wallets with fully synched pirate nodes.

[30-Oct-18 06:18 PM] AndrewK#3947
maybe we can look into partnering with https://airwire.io/

[30-Oct-18 06:19 PM] AndrewK#3947
^ they let you airdrop to people that don't have wallets/accounts

[30-Oct-18 06:19 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
cointext is better

[30-Oct-18 06:19 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
but if people dont have wallets it's waste of time

[30-Oct-18 06:20 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
same as to people who dont have computers üòÉ

[30-Oct-18 06:20 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Pirate is about privacy so you need to have your hardware + software + understand it's important (the privacy)

[30-Oct-18 06:20 PM] AndrewK#3947
If we looked at this stuff from the lens of this coin is only for technically savvy people, then we will never see real adoption

[30-Oct-18 06:21 PM] AndrewK#3947
pirate is about privacy for people that want privacy

[30-Oct-18 06:21 PM] jansako#3330
hmmmm something is off. Sent 10k ARRR to DigiPrice, the incoming transaction shows 1676 Pirate... that is some deposit fee!
