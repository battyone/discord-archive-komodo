Guys its official, i've gone pirate mad.

[16-Oct-18 06:47 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm not sure if this was some weird pirate related hallucination or not. But I just noticed a coffee store a couple of doors down the road is opening. Guess what the name is. Pirate Coffee.

[16-Oct-18 06:47 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Someone's fucking with me, I know it.

[16-Oct-18 06:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Well be sure to send you there first if we get a Point of sale done.

[16-Oct-18 06:52 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
After a bit of googling, turns out there is pirate coffee all over the world

[16-Oct-18 06:53 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
How could that be any better. Buy pirate coffee with pirate coins

[16-Oct-18 07:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess the ones who says Pirate gives negative vibe to this project must consider, the subject can be presented in positive way. it's about marketing and how it's presented.

[16-Oct-18 07:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Well we certainly don't want skulls and other dark images 😃

bootstrap

[16-Oct-18 07:18 AM] 0x03#8822
see https://bootstrap.0x03.services/

[16-Oct-18 07:18 AM] 0x03#8822
it's not a 'real bootstrap' (other coins have fancy bootstrap.dat files), people have been giving me fire for that

[16-Oct-18 07:19 AM] 0x03#8822
but it will save a lot of time for initial sync, for komodo it's... about a year

[16-Oct-18 07:20 AM] 0x03#8822
would somebody be kind enough to put the correct logo in png format in here or into my DM for the bootstrap to display?

[16-Oct-18 07:23 AM] 0x03#8822

Hey everyone... we could really use some more social media force.  
We're in the very beginning of getting proper material to share as well as a proper place to direct people for all the info they need.

[16-Oct-18 07:46 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If you see any topics you want the channel or the official pirate accounts to respond/interact with, please post them in the #pirate-marketing channel

[16-Oct-18 07:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Pin some of the infographics we can use

[16-Oct-18 07:47 AM] FishyGuts#5085
These algorithms for keeping posts in peoples feeds are all different, but with all, the sooner the better.

[16-Oct-18 07:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Will try to make some tweets laters

[16-Oct-18 07:47 AM] 0x03#8822

Since easily shareable material is still being built, if you guys just link tweets we can interact with, that is helpful too.

[16-Oct-18 07:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The website will be up soon and that will be a great place to point people for any info they need.

@0x03 it is on purpose. i guess people didn't like the way the website looked and changed it

[16-Oct-18 09:22 AM] jorian#4555
oh darnit, discord didn' tload

[16-Oct-18 09:32 AM] scubapanda#2485
I liked the original a lot, it was classic style in a good sense.

[16-Oct-18 09:32 AM] scubapanda#2485
And it was .black.

[16-Oct-18 09:35 AM] jorian#4555
yes, it had something mysterious to it. now it has a contact page. which pirate in his right mind will reveal his identity? 😛

[16-Oct-18 09:52 AM] Flexatron#8809
An idea to redirect to the old version of pirate.black until the new lay-out is finished?:)

[16-Oct-18 10:01 AM] Oszy#5734
something is in the works site doesn't load up for me now

[16-Oct-18 10:03 AM] Flexatron#8809

yes

[16-Oct-18 12:26 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
small success is 2k views, but with < 100 upvotes in 4 h we go nowhere
we need to organize mailing lists where people will receive email after post like that to vote up. Why they should ? Once a week from that user lists there could be a lottery and some Arrr to win. Miners who want good for Arrr should tip/fund to that lottery.

[16-Oct-18 12:30 PM] Flexatron#8809
yes...

[16-Oct-18 12:30 PM] Flexatron#8809
quick bursts of upvotes in the beginning to defeat the downvoters

[16-Oct-18 12:31 PM] Flexatron#8809
The net hashrate has been off for a few days now btw.. it should be over 100 Msol now..

[16-Oct-18 12:33 PM] CHMEX#0686
What do you mean by it should be over 100 Msol?

[16-Oct-18 12:35 PM] Flexatron#8809
Piratepool+ arrr pool = 100+

[16-Oct-18 12:35 PM] CHMEX#0686
I think getmininginfo returns avg over the last 120 blocks

[16-Oct-18 12:36 PM] Flexatron#8809
Okay then its just lagging

[16-Oct-18 12:40 PM] scubapanda#2485
Last 10h average hashrate is just under 80Msol.

[16-Oct-18 12:47 PM] Flexatron#8809

[16-Oct-18 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
`komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE getnetworkhashps 0` will give you instantaneous network hashrate

[16-Oct-18 12:52 PM] Flexatron#8809
Nice

[16-Oct-18 12:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
```$ komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE getnetworkhashps 0

[16-Oct-18 12:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
that 0 is "the last 0 blocks", so you can give it different stuff, with no argument, it uses the default averaging window
