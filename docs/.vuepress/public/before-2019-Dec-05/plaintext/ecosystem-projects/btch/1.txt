Did you guys want to bridge this channel to another discord channel? Let me know and we will get it done. I need an inivation link to your discord.

[21-Jun-18 02:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Audo this will replace our #btch Slack channel, so I don't think we need a bridge

[22-Jun-18 08:44 AM] Audo#5667
ok thanks @dukeleto

[22-Jun-18 07:13 PM] AkiraX#8269

@dukeleto has BTCH got a src repo?  i've only got this: https://github.com/bitcoinhush - want it for a submission to an exchange

@Mylo it's a komodo asset chain, so it's source code is KMD itself

[08-Jul-18 11:32 PM] Mylo#8306
yep understood.  zilla and coqui have a src repo but you never know what kind of tech you find at exchanges to understand komodo's tech stack üòÉ

[08-Jul-18 11:32 PM] Mylo#8306
thank you

[08-Jul-18 11:33 PM] Mylo#8306
that info will do.  has the instructions for aforementioned tech

[12-Jul-18 07:24 PM] nobby#8396
Will duke return to btch or is this being given to other devs? Just want to know what‚Äôs happening.

[13-Jul-18 05:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@nobby still here, and I would love to know, what would "other devs" do with BTCH ?

[13-Jul-18 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
I would add crypto conditions üòÉ

[13-Jul-18 06:40 PM] nobby#8396
@dukeleto  are you looking to grow the team? It would be a real shame to ignore btch. I am aware you are busy on other projects but is there not anyone you'd trust to continue this?

[13-Jul-18 06:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
@nobby i have not heard from any devs wanting to do anything. Patches are always welcome. Do you want to add crypto conditions to BTCH? That would be great üòÉ

[13-Jul-18 06:46 PM] nobby#8396
I know an incredible dev involved on a project at the moment. I won't mention the project here or who he is but it wouldn't hurt talking to him in the near future. @dukeleto Just an idea but I'd be happy to talk to him myself to see if I can get you 2 to have a discord meeting.

[13-Jul-18 06:47 PM] nobby#8396

[13-Jul-18 06:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
@nobby i always welcome experienced devs or people that want to genuinely learn to get involved. There is way more to do than I can work on, I am maybe only 1/777th as productive as jl777 . Basically, find an itch, and scratch it. That is how I got involved in free software + open source over 20 years ago

[13-Jul-18 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
actually crypto conditions is already in btch

[13-Jul-18 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
since it is in the KMD codebase

[13-Jul-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
what would be needed is a hardfork to enable ac_cc=1

[13-Jul-18 07:45 PM] nobby#8396
What would be the pros and cons of doing this?

[13-Jul-18 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
my point is that without any specific btch development, all the improvements to komodo codebase is inherited

[13-Jul-18 09:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
@nobby BTCH inherits most/all features of KMD, but some features are related to the creation of the AC, specifically, the arguments that control all the options for the new AC

[13-Jul-18 09:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
when James and I created BTCH, there was no mining of AC's, and when we created BTCH, there was no CryptoConditions, so the current live chain does not have those features. If we recreated BTCH again, with these options, we would need to hardfork or maybe do a snapshot and airdrop onto the new chain to get those features.

can just do a height activated change of ASSETCHAINS_CC = 1

[13-Jul-18 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
the point is without any extra effort BTCH is always getting work done

[13-Jul-18 09:24 PM] Labhras#2315
what is BTCH ?

[13-Jul-18 09:24 PM] nobby#8396
Yes, even for someone with far far less technical knowledge than you guys I can see that.

[13-Jul-18 09:25 PM] nobby#8396
I just would love to get this project out there more.

[13-Jul-18 09:26 PM] nobby#8396
Oh. My last comment was regarding btch is always getting work done bit

[13-Jul-18 09:28 PM] nobby#8396
I hope this one day becomes a priority for you both in the future. A lot of time as gone into this and I believe there is a chance for huge growth. This is the time before the next crypto bull run.

[13-Jul-18 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe some from community can help market it

[13-Jul-18 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
and to get out there

[13-Jul-18 09:32 PM] Berg#2666
I'd offer to lend a hand but I don't have any stake in BTCH üòâ

[13-Jul-18 09:33 PM] nobby#8396
Sounds like a great plan. But without something new. A new development in the btch world it won‚Äôt work. You‚Äôll need some new feature or something otherwise you‚Äôll get ‚Äúoh that dead coin blah blah‚Äù

[13-Jul-18 09:33 PM] nobby#8396
The whole project is promising. I‚Äôm trying to buy some on coinexchange but my damn order isn‚Äôt being filled. Maybe I‚Äôm being too tight

[13-Jul-18 09:34 PM] Berg#2666
BTCH had great potential, it just needed funding to provide liquidity and marketing when the drop happened... CoinExchange alone will keep the coin in the grave until it's listed elsewhere.

[13-Jul-18 09:34 PM] Berg#2666
Has*** great potential.

[13-Jul-18 09:34 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it can be the first coin that actively uses CC

BTCH (2) 

[13-Jul-18 09:37 PM] nobby#8396
It needs to move forward with something yes. Then marketing, social media etc. New roadmap. At least a dev or 2 with some available time to work on it. That may not be as easy as it sounds.

[13-Jul-18 09:37 PM] nobby#8396
Now is the key time. We know the bull will return.

[13-Jul-18 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
you can coordinate all this! it sounds great idea

[13-Jul-18 09:39 PM] nobby#8396
As I‚Äôve mentioned I am not a developer so my skills are usually used elsewhere.

[13-Jul-18 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
the management part of it

[13-Jul-18 09:40 PM] nobby#8396
Very happy to discuss things another time in pm. This needs to be revived and moved to the next level.

[14-Jul-18 11:28 AM] Hegelian#0018
I'm excited by this messaging feature as the sapling upgrade will allow me to send z transactions with only 40mb ram. So I can send messages on my Samsung s9. That is very cool. Do you think its feasible to make a BTCH branded mobile wallet for android?

[14-Jul-18 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
its possible, but a fair amount of work

[15-Jul-18 01:43 AM] AkiraX#8269
Airdrop with existing btch?

[15-Jul-18 01:43 AM] AkiraX#8269
I would love it

[15-Jul-18 01:43 AM] AkiraX#8269
I've got a ton

[15-Jul-18 01:48 AM] AkiraX#8269
@Hegelian there's already mobile btch.  It's a fork of agama mobile

[15-Jul-18 01:48 AM] AkiraX#8269
Just gotta build it

[15-Jul-18 01:48 AM] AkiraX#8269
I've been using agama mobile forever

[15-Jul-18 01:49 AM] AkiraX#8269
@nobby @dukeleto @jl777c  very happy to see these discussions.  I've been holding and accumulating

[15-Jul-18 01:50 AM] AkiraX#8269
I have 3x of what I had since airdrop

[15-Jul-18 01:54 AM] AkiraX#8269
@nobby how do you know the bull will return?

[15-Jul-18 05:28 AM] nobby#8396
@AkiraX the bull run will 100% return. I‚Äôve held bitcoin for many years and seen this pattern before. Yes we may go lower but btc will destroy the $19,600 ATH for sure. All the institutional money is flowing in most of which will surely have been otc. Whether btch pumps or not is a different story. All we need here is some new development, roadmap and some people who can spend some time on this project. I think btch could be massive and I‚Äôm (trying) to accumulate now (if my damn buy order is filled).

[15-Jul-18 05:33 AM] nobby#8396
When this bull returns we will without doubt see well over a trillion dollar crypto market cap. I‚Äôd be disappointed if btch doesn‚Äôt join the run and have huge increases. But again, we need some development and good news.

[15-Jul-18 02:23 PM] AkiraX#8269
Chances are. You probably already loaded the boat at 1700 :)

[15-Jul-18 02:54 PM] AkiraX#8269
nothing wrong with coinexchange

[15-Jul-18 02:54 PM] AkiraX#8269
i find it pretty good

[15-Jul-18 03:50 PM] nobby#8396
I am no way loaded up on btch at all. I have some but need more. I‚Äôm really interested. Need my orders filled.

[15-Jul-18 03:52 PM] nobby#8396
Then I really think some planning needs to take place on where to take btch and finding people to help the devs. Seems more people are needed. I‚Äôm great on social media with projects and would love to help. I‚Äôm involved in a project now but can help in the near future

[15-Jul-18 04:18 PM] AkiraX#8269
awesome

[15-Jul-18 04:18 PM] AkiraX#8269
i totally agree

[15-Jul-18 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing stops BTCH from getting to where other bitcoin forks have, in fact it is the smallest blockchain among all the bitcoin forks

[15-Jul-18 06:45 PM] Alright#0419
most of them have worth while block rewards

[15-Jul-18 06:45 PM] Alright#0419
so it leads to speculation on the price

[15-Jul-18 10:58 PM] AkiraX#8269
What about incentive for minerw

[15-Jul-18 10:59 PM] AkiraX#8269
Are there any blocks left

[16-Jul-18 06:42 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the last bull market , every coin with btc on its name got pumped pretty good

[17-Jul-18 11:13 AM] nobby#8396
@jl777c do I post here or in the hush/ btch section? @AkiraX

[17-Jul-18 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
they shuld be cross connected. @Audo how to enable that?

[17-Jul-18 11:17 AM] Audo#5667
Does Hush Discord has a #btch channel too, and these should be cross connected?

I can ask Noashh to do it

yes

[21-Jul-18 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
the limit for coins I dont think has changed

[21-Jul-18 08:16 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes in the article it mentions exchange volume however the limit is removed from the request form.... lets see...

[21-Jul-18 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
million exchanges and coins!

[22-Jul-18 05:37 AM] CHMEX#0686
Hi,

Unfortunately BitcoinHush does not meet our requirements for listing at this time. Please feel free to re-apply when this project has become more established.

Sincerely,
CoinMarketCap Support

[22-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Alright#0419
Might not be my place to suggest this, but has anyone considered relaunching BTCH with a worth while mining reward? Maybe airdrop to a new chain with initial supply of 2.1M and still have 21M max? Maybe make it a high % POS, so it doesn't detract from HUSH's or KMD's hashrate?

[22-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Alright#0419
Would be cool to see a POS chain in production once the tech is rock solid

[22-Jul-18 07:46 PM] nobby#8396
@Alright sounds great but I think the main issue is having devs that have time to give to btch.

[22-Jul-18 07:48 PM] nobby#8396
I see all the shit on coinmarketcap and they won‚Äôt list btch. The issue here is they see the 0 volume and lack of exchanges and not what btch is.

[22-Jul-18 07:49 PM] Alright#0419
I think lack of volume is partly due to it basically being a token as opposed to coin with mining rewards

[22-Jul-18 07:50 PM] nobby#8396
Yes. True.

[23-Jul-18 01:52 PM] Berg#2666
I mean, I know KMD members are holding a ton of reserved BTCH, is there a dev fund that we can use to throw a 1 BTC listing fee towards getting on Crypto-Bridge or some medium exchange? I honestly believe that's the biggest thing BTCH is lacking behind marketing, nowhere to trade.

@Alright mining AC's wasn't an option when BTCH was launched, we most likely would have made it mineable if that was an option at the time. Your ideas are interesting
