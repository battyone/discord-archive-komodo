(Maybe when JL reads this he would suggest a better idea)

[20-Jul-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
just do a test with funds in all segids to smooth out the granularity of initial blocks

[20-Jul-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
statistically if staking is N times more, over time, it should end up with N times more

[20-Jul-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
to make it easier to detect, best to make it 30x for testing

[20-Jul-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
put funds in 64 different segids for each category, just do it with a script

[20-Jul-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
in normal use it wont matter

[20-Jul-19 03:54 PM] dimxy#2587
So we want to do a test with activated coins split into 64 segids.

[20-Jul-19 03:57 PM] dimxy#2587
Suppose we have  those 64 addresses, with some utxos on them, forever.
And we will not split locked-in-loop amounts into segids.
Wouldn't these activated utxos outperform locked-in-loop utxos (that are not split)?
(As I understand splitting is needed only for initial blocks. So later it does not matter, does it?)

[20-Jul-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
with many users, the splitting effect is averaged out

[20-Jul-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
but active users can get more blocks by analyzing the 64 segids and putting coins in the weakest one

[20-Jul-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a multiplayer game on 64 segids, with limited resources

[20-Jul-19 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
very complex strategy game that depends on how everybody else allocates their coins

[20-Jul-19 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is a simple bug in the boosting calc?

[20-Jul-19 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
you know for mining to make it easier you need to multiple the value

[20-Jul-19 04:08 PM] dimxy#2587
Actually I did a test for only activated coins on 2 PoS nodes. I wanted to get to the point where both equal staking utxos would generate approximately equal results.
But my chain for a weekly test duration was in unstable state (apparently because of no staking utxo spliting).
So I wondered once more if the splitting needs only for initial blocks or it is better to have it always

[20-Jul-19 04:09 PM] dimxy#2587
Yes, I 'll do splitting and provide the chain to be stable

[20-Jul-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
if you start with them split, then each one will increase the coins in that segid, overtime relatively balanced. which is fine

[20-Jul-19 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
number of nodes is not what matters as a single node can stake many addresses

[20-Jul-19 04:27 PM] dimxy#2587
You wrote `put funds in 64 different segids for each category'.
If we have 'activated' and 'lock-in-loop' accounts does this mean we need to split both of them?
(our current locked-in-loop account implementation does not allow splitting because of shared 1of2 address)

[20-Jul-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
need to make 64 different loops?

[20-Jul-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be there is a bug in your staking percentage multiplier. can you post the code that does the calculation

[20-Jul-19 05:07 PM] dimxy#2587
I mean suppose we have a credit loop. The issuer has locked some amount in this loop.
This amount should have 3x multiplier in staking.
The question is should this amount be split on 64 segids?

[20-Jul-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[20-Jul-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as it really has 3x the chance, that is what matters

[20-Jul-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i think there must be some bug in the 3x calc

[20-Jul-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
how exactly do you make it 3x

[20-Jul-19 05:13 PM] dimxy#2587
this is how I calculate 3x:
```
uint32_t komodo_txtime2(uint64_t *valuep,uint256 hash,int32_t n,char *destaddr)
{
...
if ( n < tx.vout.size() )
    {
        int32_t stakemultiplier = GetStakeMultiplier(tx, n);
        *valuep = tx.vout[n].nValue * stakemultiplier; 
    ...
    }
}
```
so there is GetStakeMultiplier() func, it calls MarmaraGetStakeMultiplier() func

[20-Jul-19 05:15 PM] dimxy#2587
MarmaraGetStakeMultiplier() returns either 1 or 3:

[20-Jul-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
and you verified that the actual stake compare uses the bigger value?

[20-Jul-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
lets try a 100x boost, that should make it very clear and not need to fiddle with segids

[20-Jul-19 05:19 PM] dimxy#2587
No, I have not reached this testing progress yet.
I have been testing only how activated staking amounts work which always should have 1x multiplier. (and I had my chain unstable, as Alright yesterday explained it could have been because of lack of segids)

[20-Jul-19 05:20 PM] dimxy#2587
So I initiated this discussion about what should we do about splitting utxos on segids in marmara chains

[20-Jul-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to make sure the actual staking calc is using the bigger values

[20-Jul-19 05:35 PM] dimxy#2587
okay let's try 100x or similar value

[20-Jul-19 09:21 PM] Paro#7842
How can I try 100x? @dimxy

[21-Jul-19 06:22 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I think he will change the code. You need to recompile with that code.

[21-Jul-19 08:38 AM] dimxy#2587
I have changed the mult for boosted to 100x. Changed it for the version with new rpcs:

Did you test this version or the previous?

[21-Jul-19 08:39 AM] dimxy#2587
(we need yet to split activated into 64 segids)

[21-Jul-19 12:00 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@dimxy Is this version with non-functional version2 parameters? If so, we tested with @Paro last weekend but deleted the chain soon since settlement was not working.

[21-Jul-19 12:11 PM] Paro#7842
I made the file 400x.

[21-Jul-19 01:50 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I hope we can clearly see this time that LCL coins result in much more staking than activated ones.

[21-Jul-19 06:03 PM] dimxy#2587
BTW, what was wrong with the settlement in the version with the new rpcs?
Didn't it start at all?
Or, was it finished with an error?
(I tested a credit loop with this version, with an issuer, one endorser and one holder, and the autosettlement seemed worked)

[21-Jul-19 07:14 PM] dimxy#2587
Plus, for the new version with new rpcs, the tx structures were changed, so it could work only with new credit loops (that is, created with this new version's marmarareceive, marmaraissue etc rpcs)

[21-Jul-19 08:05 PM] Paro#7842
I don't know, I'm gonna do a new test.

[21-Jul-19 08:06 PM] Paro#7842

@Paro good You can test with Version 2 params! Remember. We tried with Version 2 params but we could not succeed with settlement

[21-Jul-19 08:27 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Then we had deleted the chain we created new chain according to old Version

[21-Jul-19 08:27 PM] Paro#7842
I won't test "marmara-v1-1-opret-v2." I'm going to test version-1-1.

[21-Jul-19 08:27 PM] Paro#7842
"marmara-v1-1-opret-v2" parameters do not work.

[24-Jul-19 03:28 PM] dimxy#2587
I could not see problems with 50,000 coins.
But I can see that the settled 100,000 amount did not go to PK3 normal account. Did you install the latest update for 'corrected pubkey for the holder in settlement' from 22 July?
