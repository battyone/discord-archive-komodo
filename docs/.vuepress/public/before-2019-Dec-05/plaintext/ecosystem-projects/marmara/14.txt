Is everything okay with the latest test? What does 'Total Staking' column mean?

[14-Oct-19 09:33 AM] dimxy#2587
I have fixed the problem when issuance txid is not removed after the settlement in marmarainfo (the update is in the repo)

[14-Oct-19 02:30 PM] Paro#7842
coin produced by each node " total staking" .

[14-Oct-19 03:52 PM] dimxy#2587
So all the nodes produced approximately equal amount of coins, and there is no multiplication for boosted coins (as PK1 and PK2 should have had 8000 boosted coins each and PK3 only 10649 activated coins)?

[14-Oct-19 06:12 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Yes it seems so. There should be much less in PK3.

[14-Oct-19 06:12 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Maybe we need to wait for longer.

[14-Oct-19 08:54 PM] Paro#7842
ALL nodes began to "staking" at the same time.

[14-Oct-19 08:56 PM] Paro#7842
In the real process "PK3" will then enter "loop"

[14-Oct-19 08:56 PM] Paro#7842
it produces little in the "loop" that subsequently enters.

[15-Oct-19 08:30 AM] dimxy#2587
Actually I was not able yet to achieve this effect (more blocks generation for boosted coins) on my several test chains. 
I asked our test lab for help, they will be able to test in several days.
Alternatively we can just multiply coinbase value for boosted coins

[15-Oct-19 04:04 PM] Paro#7842
if you ask me. The system is currently working well.

[26-Oct-19 10:57 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
The holder should never be able to produce more or even same/similar amount of coin when compared to the issuer and other endersers who have more locked-in-loop coins. That is the case in one example. I think we need to test for longer terms such as 1 month.

if you are testing multiple things at the same time or running multiple daemons along with other things, i found 16GB is not enough. 32GB is best to have as minimum

I am very busy at the moment and I could not follow pegs and gateway. But as far as I understand it might solve a common problem that are happenning with post-dated cheques use. I think @jl777c will give idea since he knows very well how post-dated cheques work in Turkey. 

The problem is this. Suppose you have a post-dated cheque from someone with a long redemption date say 1.1.2021. I am holder of cheque now. I cannot wait until that date and I cannot sell it for goods. Can I exchange it for KMD, VRSC, BTC etc? What happens at the moment in Turkey? The person goes to a bank and sells it for cheaper price. Actually bank becomes holder. They call it breaking a cheque. But in reality, the cheque, i.e. the credit loop is not broken. A bank becomes holder, i.e. waits until the redemption date. It is simply using another asset/coin instead of GOODS. Can we do that with pegs and gateways? @Paro may share the case as a picture since I cannot upload the picture.

[04-Nov-19 03:24 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@Paro any idea on how you might do that with pegs and gateways?

[04-Nov-19 03:24 AM] Paro#7842
@B. G√ºltekin √áetiner example 

receive Post-dated Cheques
``` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCLTEST marmarareceive pkendorser batontxid 55 KMD "kmd-walletaddress"```
accept endorser 
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCLTEST marmaratransfer pkholder batontxid```
in this way, "Post-dated Cheques" will be passed to a new endorser.
In order to get the check, the person needs to have a KMD coin.
I still haven't made plans about how KMD or other coins will be formed.
I guess it needs to be multi-wallet.
In this way, "Post-dated Cheques" can be swap safely and conveniently.
on foot with this thought. can be developed in different ways.

[04-Nov-19 03:26 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
So he buys the post-dated cheque for 55 KMD?

[04-Nov-19 03:27 AM] Paro#7842
yes. 55 KMD example. hypothesis

[04-Nov-19 03:27 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Instead of providing goods?

[04-Nov-19 03:28 AM] Paro#7842
Yes you pay 55 KMD (sample) instead of giving the goods. I get "Post-date Checks" worth 55 KMD

[04-Nov-19 03:29 AM] Paro#7842
varies according to the agreement between the buyer and seller.

[04-Nov-19 03:30 AM] Paro#7842
or pegs - automatic with gateways.

[04-Nov-19 03:30 AM] Paro#7842
but it is very difficult to do this automatically with pegs-gateways.

[04-Nov-19 03:32 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
So you transfer the cheque to the person giving an aggreed amount. The person becomes holder. You get 55 KMD. Does it need pegs and gateways? @jl777c may give idea.

[04-Nov-19 03:35 AM] Paro#7842
"latch gateways" play the main role.

Voucher worth opening on sale. when the other party accepts it. KMD (sample) is paid automatically.

[04-Nov-19 03:35 AM] Paro#7842
Idea for buying-selling "pegs and gateways".

[04-Nov-19 03:36 AM] Paro#7842
improved. or replaceable.

[04-Nov-19 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is done manually, this can of course be done, the KMD just being the "goods"

[04-Nov-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
to blockchain enforce an atomic swap would require custom handling in atomicDEX, which is possible, but not easy
