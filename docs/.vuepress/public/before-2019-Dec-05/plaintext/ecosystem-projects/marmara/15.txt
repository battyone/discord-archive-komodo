non - loop node. looks in the loop.

a node that has never looped. seems to have entered a loop before.

final loop test
```PK1 : 8700 MCL (3x staking)
Pk2 : 9718 MCL (3x staking)
PK3 : 120 MCL (not in loop)```
note: matures 600 block 
matures : 32000 MCL

[04-Nov-19 07:43 PM] dimxy#2587
I could not achieve the required results in my tests for coin generation for activated and boosted:
My test conditions were to create activated coins evenly on 64 segids and lock the same amount for a long loop. The multiplier was set to 100x. So I had the even amount of activated and boosted coins and big multiplier for test results to be easy to interpret.
Then I waited for 10K blocks and checked number of blocks generated in each segid (there is a getlastsegidstakes rpc to get PoS block count in segids). I hoped the boosted coins would generate much more blocks but it seemed the generated block number was the same on all segids (so seems the multiplier or the way how I applied it did not provide the expected staking effect).
I asked kmdlabs for help with this.
We might repeat a similar test on your chain providing very accurate test start conditions to have test results easy verifiable and observe the whole picture of PoS (maybe I did something wrong or misinterpreted the test results)

[04-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Paro#7842
To me the latest tests are successful.

[04-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Paro#7842
as requested. produces more than normal "staking" mode.

[04-Nov-19 07:54 PM] Paro#7842
do not compare with nodes initiated at the same time.

[04-Nov-19 07:54 PM] Paro#7842
issuer and endorser 1 start at the same time.

[04-Nov-19 07:55 PM] Paro#7842
endorser 2, endorser 3, endorser 4.
it is not clear when they will start ..

[04-Nov-19 07:55 PM] Paro#7842
if you ask me. 3x successful.

[04-Nov-19 07:56 PM] Paro#7842
There are things I wonder.

Will the system always work as 64segid?

[04-Nov-19 07:58 PM] Paro#7842
In addition, why isn't "staking mode" shared "earned coins" ?

[04-Nov-19 07:59 PM] Paro#7842
staking mode  system earned coins
%50 normal
%50 activated

[04-Nov-19 08:00 PM] Paro#7842
Anyway 3x successful.

[04-Nov-19 08:00 PM] Paro#7842
There is only one problem. We need to do a mass-test.!

[04-Nov-19 08:00 PM] Paro#7842
that's all we don't do.

[04-Nov-19 08:10 PM] dimxy#2587
PoS enumerates 64 segid and looks for utxo for staking. On large chains where there are many addresses they will be present in each segid naturally.
For our test chains we need to generate addresses for all segids to provide PoS to work correctly (otherwise it could be stalling)
I temporarily have turned off generation of activated coins (in coinbase) in order to they do not contaminate the initial test conditions (so the initial number of utxo would persist throughout the whole test) - so we can observe how many PoS block are generated with the multiplier and without it.
Mass load tests are required I totally support this!

[04-Nov-19 08:11 PM] Paro#7842
It is difficult to reach a clear result without mass-testing.

[04-Nov-19 08:11 PM] Paro#7842
in my opinion "3x stretching" was successful.

[05-Nov-19 07:18 AM] dimxy#2587
@Paro fixed 'incorrect issuerpk output' in marmaracreditloop (the update is in my repo)

[05-Nov-19 11:54 AM] Paro#7842
ok ty. rebuild all node ?

[05-Nov-19 06:22 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
If activated coins are disabled, how do you test 3x for LCL staking against activated staking? Or do you only mean the block rewards which are 50 percent coming out as activated rewards?

[05-Nov-19 06:56 PM] dimxy#2587
Yes I disabled 50% rewards generation of activated coin so generated activated coins would not affect staking. Only the initially activated coins in 64 segids and LCL coins in one segid remain throughout the whole test (and after the end of the test we can calculate PoS blocks in each segid)

[06-Nov-19 03:46 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Good Engineering practice.

[06-Nov-19 03:49 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I think 3x staking is working. @Paro ‚Äòs last tests seem to be ok. The ones in LCL should be compared with outsiders who have only activated coins. He would make some more tests.

I've been trying mass-testing for three days.
There 's a little thing I run into.
it takes a long time to find 102 when I set up a new chain.

how do you get that error? can you produce the same error again? if yes, how did you reproduce it?

[11-Nov-19 03:28 PM] SHossain#0007

"marmarareceiving" do not need to "marmaratransfer" is doing.

[11-Nov-19 07:03 PM] dimxy#2587
fixed - added check if a request txid is a true request tx (the fix in my repo), thank you for finding this

[12-Nov-19 10:32 AM] dimxy#2587
@Paro I added one more check (it never existed earlier): now marmaraissue checks that the request tx has the passed receiver pubkey in tx normal inputs. This will better secure the baton transfer (it can go only to the node which issued marmarareceive). The repo updated

what would listaddressgroupings output?

[14-Nov-19 08:57 AM] Paro#7842
wage earned in mining. The "seg64" token also does not work.
