[25-Jul-19 06:16 PM] dimxy#2587
Thank you
This is the settlement tx

[25-Jul-19 06:17 PM] dimxy#2587
Let's see where the settled amount went to...

[25-Jul-19 06:17 PM] Paro#7842
Unparsed address [0]

[25-Jul-19 07:25 PM] dimxy#2587
yes bad address

[25-Jul-19 07:36 PM] dimxy#2587
could you please run 'git log' in komodo src directory and paste the first page of the output?
for this node 03878fbb38cf2b42a4f640ca36f49cde644b231cdd6cc2bb255f5e318d8f4d6dae

[25-Jul-19 07:41 PM] dimxy#2587
this is one of the ubuntu nodes, I believe.
Seems it has not been upgraded, but it has mined the settlement transaction
(I used to have that empty address issue some time ago but it was fixed. Maybe this bug still remains on ubuntus?)

[26-Jul-19 12:06 AM] Paro#7842

[26-Jul-19 03:42 AM] dimxy#2587
Apart from the pk1,pk2 and pk3 nodes you have two more ubuntu nodes, don't you?
Could please add git log output from them too?
as settlement now is done by miners in auto mode then every node in the chain should be upgraded to the latest version because there were bugs in the settlement (and could be further as we are in active development stage)

[26-Jul-19 10:59 AM] Paro#7842
first node and second node. Not updated.

[26-Jul-19 11:00 AM] Paro#7842
update. I will build a new chain.

I found the problem.

[26-Jul-19 02:57 PM] Paro#7842
second node server is shut down.

[26-Jul-19 02:58 PM] Paro#7842
mining was the only server.so he cannot "settlement".

[26-Jul-19 04:48 PM] dimxy#2587
The important thing is that the first and second nodes are also upgraded up to the latest version to eliminate the empty address issue (that we saw in the last test)

[26-Jul-19 05:18 PM] Paro#7842
all node update ..

[02-Aug-19 07:02 AM] Paro#7842
I've tried it many times and I've done long tests. settlement works well. @dimxy

[02-Aug-19 07:02 AM] dimxy#2587
great!

[02-Aug-19 07:03 AM] Paro#7842
Do you want me to run another kind of test?

[02-Aug-19 07:12 AM] dimxy#2587
we might try to break the system by passing incorrect parameters

[02-Aug-19 07:12 AM] Paro#7842
oh ok

[02-Aug-19 07:13 AM] Paro#7842
try almost everything. I will report errors.

[03-Aug-19 08:05 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Good. Going very well then. Can we definitely say that coins Locked in Credit Loops have definitely much more staking power than other activated/locked coins?

[03-Aug-19 08:07 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
That was question 1. Question 2: Would you suggest the staking power of LCL Coins  to be more than 3x in real chain?

[05-Aug-19 08:28 PM] dimxy#2587
Actually  my test chain is not very stable in sense of staking. I  believe this is segid problems which to be solved yet

[05-Aug-19 08:32 PM] dimxy#2587
About the question2 I think we could set any multiplier (which I believe depends on what business requires) as long as stacking in the marmara chain works okay

[06-Aug-19 05:49 PM] dimxy#2587
I'm rethinking about issues with staking.
Actually my 3-node marmara chain is stalling. This shows itself as blocks are generated with long delays and there are messages in log:
```640 seconds until elegible, waiting. 
600 seconds until elegible, waiting.
...```
(That is, more than 10 min waiting for an utxo.)
Our other developers suggested that this is because not enough utxos for staking.
Indeed, in non-marmara chains we usually use utxo splitting on 64 addresses (this is about normal coins of course).
In our marmara chain we have not yet implemented such splitting for activated coins, and I'm thinking why we need this.
As I understand JL correctly, in large marmara chains we would not need splitting as there will be many user addresses and segids will be filled up naturally.
In fact this splitting on 64 segids is needed for small chains, while we do not have many addresses yet.
So I am implementing this splitting of activated coins for small test chains to run stable 
(And we should understand it would affect rewards generation: of course, split activated coins will have much more advantage over non-split lock-in-loop coins). 

Seems, this feature will be used also in the production chain on its early stage to make it stable.
And it should be some transition period until enough addresses appear on chain because the initially split coins would affect new users' activated and lock-in-loop coins rewards. 
(That is, the initially split coins should be taken off as enough other addresses are on the chain)

@dimxy  github will update when sin. I need to run new tests.

[07-Aug-19 11:07 AM] dimxy#2587
I'm working now on splitting feature, it should not affect any program logic.
(I hope to get splitting working today or tomorrow)

[07-Aug-19 04:33 PM] Paro#7842
ok i waiting.

[08-Aug-19 07:53 PM] dimxy#2587
I'm still working on the splitting (but close to finish)
And I had to improve the marmara stake transaction opreturn structure (so we would need to start a new chain)

[08-Aug-19 09:04 PM] Paro#7842
hmm ok i waitin u

[09-Aug-19 06:20 AM] dimxy#2587
I believe staking works much better with the new command marmaralock64 splitting activated coins on the segids.
The update is in in my repo.

Please note that I have merged the latest changes from the main komodo repository and your local build repositories may report conflicts with my repo. You may either remove your local repos and clone them again or use for build remote branches instead local branches with this commands: 
```
git fetch origin marmara-v1-1-opret-v2 
git checkout origin/marmara-v1-1-opret-v2
make clean
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```

[09-Aug-19 06:44 AM] Paro#7842
OK. new chain build.

[09-Aug-19 06:45 AM] Paro#7842
I'll do a test later

[09-Aug-19 06:58 AM] dimxy#2587

[09-Aug-19 08:05 AM] dimxy#2587
this marmaralock64 is used only for initial marmarachain start, to fill in all 64 segids, until many user addresses appear

[09-Aug-19 08:06 AM] dimxy#2587
so it's okay to use low amounts just for PoS to be able to work

[09-Aug-19 08:06 AM] dimxy#2587
if all the segids are not covered with addresses with utxos, the PoS could be unstable

[09-Aug-19 08:07 AM] dimxy#2587
so it is temp solution to make the chain stable

[09-Aug-19 08:08 AM] dimxy#2587
marmaralock64 does not create lock-in-loop coins.
It creates new 64 addresses with activated coins on them

[09-Aug-19 08:09 AM] Paro#7842
oh ok

[09-Aug-19 08:09 AM] Paro#7842
will I use "marmaralock" to lock?

[09-Aug-19 08:09 AM] dimxy#2587
you can see them with new rpc marmaralistactivatedaddresses

[09-Aug-19 08:09 AM] Paro#7842
yes

[09-Aug-19 08:10 AM] Paro#7842
i see

[09-Aug-19 08:10 AM] dimxy#2587
yes you can still use marmaralock to create  activated  coins on **your pubkey** that is in -pubkey= param

[09-Aug-19 08:11 AM] dimxy#2587
marmaralock64 creates 64 new pubkeys, they are not used in credit loops

[09-Aug-19 08:11 AM] dimxy#2587
they are only used in staking

[09-Aug-19 08:11 AM] Paro#7842

[09-Aug-19 08:12 AM] dimxy#2587
My own chain was stalling for 10-20 mins until I made this marmaralock64, because staking protocol  could not find staking utxo for the lack of addresses on 64 segids (there was only 1 address then)

[09-Aug-19 08:13 AM] Paro#7842
oh ok

[09-Aug-19 08:14 AM] dimxy#2587
you need to run marmaralock64 only on PoS nodes (I believe  you have 2 PoS nodes?)

[09-Aug-19 08:14 AM] Paro#7842
ooo

[09-Aug-19 08:14 AM] dimxy#2587
no need to do it on PoW or other else nodes
