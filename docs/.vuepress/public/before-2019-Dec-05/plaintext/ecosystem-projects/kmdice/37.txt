[24-Oct-18 07:47 PM] Flexatron#8809
okay this was weird

[24-Oct-18 07:48 PM] Flexatron#8809
played with Decker's gui and had a superlong losing streak, almost emptying my account

[24-Oct-18 07:48 PM] Llama#1330
how long

[24-Oct-18 07:48 PM] Flexatron#8809
then went to the block explorer and I only lost a few kmdice

[24-Oct-18 07:48 PM] Flexatron#8809
like super unlikely long

[24-Oct-18 07:48 PM] Llama#1330
hmmm

[24-Oct-18 07:48 PM] Llama#1330
decker backdoor ??!

[24-Oct-18 07:48 PM] Flexatron#8809
0.5^8 long

[24-Oct-18 07:49 PM] Llama#1330
0.5 ^ 8 = < 1

[24-Oct-18 07:49 PM] Flexatron#8809
ill switch back to jorian's gui

[24-Oct-18 07:50 PM] Flexatron#8809
phieuw, only last 26 kmdice

[24-Oct-18 07:50 PM] Flexatron#8809
lost*

[24-Oct-18 07:51 PM] Flexatron#8809
according to the balance at decker's I lost 600

[24-Oct-18 07:51 PM] Decker#3767
win or lose - doesn't depend on GUI )

[24-Oct-18 07:51 PM] Flexatron#8809
balance doesnt refresh automatically right/

[24-Oct-18 07:51 PM] Flexatron#8809
?

[24-Oct-18 07:52 PM] Decker#3767
yes, in current version you should press "refresh" button ...

[24-Oct-18 07:52 PM] Flexatron#8809
dont know what happened then, it said 63 kmdice balance, on explorer 538

[24-Oct-18 07:52 PM] Flexatron#8809
ill restart

[24-Oct-18 07:53 PM] Decker#3767
daemon depends ...

[24-Oct-18 07:53 PM] Decker#3767
gui just do `getinfo` call to show balance ...

[24-Oct-18 07:53 PM] Decker#3767
if gui show 63 - your daemon thinks that is 63 ...

[24-Oct-18 07:54 PM] Decker#3767
just try to relaunch with `-reindex -rescan` ...

[24-Oct-18 07:54 PM] Decker#3767
you can leave gui opened.

[24-Oct-18 07:56 PM] Flexatron#8809
okay seems better now

[24-Oct-18 07:57 PM] Llama#1330

[24-Oct-18 10:24 PM] c2k#4915
ok just curious

[24-Oct-18 10:25 PM] c2k#4915
see people offering 0.7 and 0.8 so couldnt really figure it out

[24-Oct-18 10:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That you're posting a sale offer that no one is buying does not a "market price" make

[24-Oct-18 10:26 PM] Llama#1330
I *really* understood that sentence.

[24-Oct-18 10:27 PM] Decker#3767
there are more sellers than buyers here ...

[24-Oct-18 10:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
No one is paying you the 61.6 cents you're asking for, which means 61.6 cents is *not* the "market price"

[24-Oct-18 10:29 PM] Llama#1330
so it's basically just like your pirate sell order 😛

[24-Oct-18 10:29 PM] Flexatron#8809
Hahahaha

[24-Oct-18 10:29 PM] Flexatron#8809
Boom

[24-Oct-18 10:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I traded mine for ~ 21 cents market

[24-Oct-18 10:29 PM] Llama#1330
and I traded my kmdice for 0.4

[24-Oct-18 10:29 PM] Llama#1330
idk why you think you know of every trade that happens

[24-Oct-18 10:30 PM] Llama#1330
its absurd

[24-Oct-18 10:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what that before or after DM crying :
`LlamaToday at 1:50 PM
lol nobody is buying kmdice`

[24-Oct-18 10:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
?

[24-Oct-18 10:30 PM] Llama#1330
that was before

[24-Oct-18 10:31 PM] Llama#1330
i sold it before that

[24-Oct-18 10:31 PM] Llama#1330
I was trying to get you to dump yours

[24-Oct-18 10:31 PM] Llama#1330
lol

[24-Oct-18 10:31 PM] Flexatron#8809
Lol

[24-Oct-18 10:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that was before`
ergo
`No one is paying you the 61.6 cents you're asking for, which means 61.6 cents is not the "market price"`
because, words

[24-Oct-18 10:33 PM] Llama#1330
I sold before and after i sent you that lol

[24-Oct-18 10:34 PM] Llama#1330
and I was never asking for 61.6 cents

[24-Oct-18 10:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I bought some, a bit, for .375

[24-Oct-18 10:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I was trying to get you to dump yours`
Either that's the largest pile of 🐄 💩 on this server or you bumped your head and forgot who I am and what I do for a living

[24-Oct-18 10:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah, i know... what a shame.

my bad

[24-Oct-18 10:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not untouchable, but there's not a single coin that I mine that I'll ever dump all of except BTC

[24-Oct-18 10:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mining and dumping is just silly

No, it's GUI for daemon.

[25-Oct-18 01:01 AM] Llama#1330
@yh you need to download https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/download/multios-201810011016-71fc062/komodo_win64_master.zip if you are on windows.

[25-Oct-18 01:01 AM] yh#8735
@Llama ok tq

[25-Oct-18 01:02 AM] Llama#1330
then you open a command prompt and navigate to the folder with cd/(filepath). the last part should be win64.

[25-Oct-18 01:02 AM] Llama#1330
and then paste this in ```komodod.exe -ac_name=KMDICE -ac_supply=10500000 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=144.76.217.232```
