are we still seeing people getting on a fork?

[25-Oct-18 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
blocks seem to be regular and I dont hear complaints

[25-Oct-18 03:23 PM] And1_89#6578
WTS  5000 kmdice  for  1500 kmd

[25-Oct-18 03:25 PM] SHossain#0007
i have not seen fork since then

[25-Oct-18 03:26 PM] SHossain#0007
all nodes running fine

[25-Oct-18 03:28 PM] sφldat#8733
[         WTS KMDICE       ]
=        0.4 KMD  each      =

[25-Oct-18 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the level of activity shows why it is good to have a dedicated chain for a single dapp. if this was on KMD, and it keeps growing like it is, it would start bogging KMD down at some point. As it is, we might need to go to a KMDICE cluster

it could be there are not enough entropy tx, i see mempool go to about 30 and then stop

[25-Oct-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
@siu - Chainmakers @jorian can you add another 100 entropy tx

[25-Oct-18 03:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jl777c no, no forks, but i think that the issue was when you tried to do too many bets from your node when there are no entropy txs

[25-Oct-18 03:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
jorian will setup more entropy in about an hour

[25-Oct-18 03:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he is out of his house

[25-Oct-18 03:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but yeah, it already being evident why the setup was an issue :/

[25-Oct-18 03:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we needed to break those 10million in thousands of entropy utxo

[25-Oct-18 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe a cron task to make a few entropy tx is needed

[25-Oct-18 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so some error checking in the gui could work around this issue

[25-Oct-18 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pretty much all of it is `cant find dice input` now

[25-Oct-18 03:53 PM] jorian#4555
sent

[25-Oct-18 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to stop once you get an error

[25-Oct-18 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
wait for the next block

[25-Oct-18 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but maybe 70 utxo wasnt enough on my end

[25-Oct-18 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the loops is self corecting

[25-Oct-18 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when it fails it just bails and tries again later

[25-Oct-18 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
started 1000 of them

[25-Oct-18 03:55 PM] jorian#4555
what is it you're trying?

[25-Oct-18 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
0.001 bets

[25-Oct-18 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to infinity

[25-Oct-18 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
usually wins

[25-Oct-18 03:57 PM] hamid502#6386
So I imported the keys and I see address in the dice wallet but no coins in there it says paid out on mainpool ? Any help?

[25-Oct-18 03:57 PM] jorian#4555
interesting

[25-Oct-18 03:58 PM] jorian#4555
@hamid502 is it on explorer? imported correct keys?

[25-Oct-18 03:59 PM] hamid502#6386
It’s right keys but haven’t checked explorer yet

[25-Oct-18 03:59 PM] jorian#4555
@blackjok3r do you set odds high too?

[25-Oct-18 03:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1:1

[25-Oct-18 03:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think

[25-Oct-18 03:59 PM] jorian#4555
i see a 1 indeed

[25-Oct-18 03:59 PM] jorian#4555
so it's a lot of work

[25-Oct-18 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did the same exact script I made on staked ... but i dont have enought utxo here

[25-Oct-18 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there I used marketmaker to make 2000 utxo then ran it

[25-Oct-18 04:00 PM] jorian#4555
ah

[25-Oct-18 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
little better though

[25-Oct-18 04:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its def entropy tx missing here tho not my wallet

[25-Oct-18 04:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
plenty of listunspents

[25-Oct-18 04:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I started like 1 millio bets here ... I estimate about 1/100th of them will work

[25-Oct-18 04:05 PM] jorian#4555
i sent 200 txns

whatever happened, I'm getting `CCduration no hashBlock....` for *every* bet

[25-Oct-18 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can reindex and "sneak" 1 or 2 in, but everything else goes to hell and somehow I lost 3k

[25-Oct-18 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
blame the jok3r

[25-Oct-18 04:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[25-Oct-18 04:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it just needs to mine the entropy tx

[25-Oct-18 04:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
happens every time

[25-Oct-18 04:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
now we are having to load entropy tx daily :/

[25-Oct-18 04:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is never a dicestatus return for a single one

[25-Oct-18 04:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just keeps sending more

or i could lost all mine
