are you somehow winning a lot more than you should?

[24-Oct-18 11:50 AM] Decker#3767
no ... bet 50, odds 2 - win 150 ...

[24-Oct-18 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
i mean the percentage of times you win

[24-Oct-18 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
should be 1 in 3

[24-Oct-18 11:50 AM] Decker#3767
may be i'm lucky? or feel the blockchain? )

[24-Oct-18 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
but your balance shows you are quite in the positive, unless you mined a lot

[24-Oct-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810

that sounds like someone got lucky or the table is still timing out

[24-Oct-18 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it usually always ended up with the table winning over enoug bets

almost finished with GUI ... it works, but needs additional code to parse KMDICE.conf, needs Windows build, and needs some additional error checking. when all of these is finished, i will release first alpha.

if qmake failed in some reasons you always can open `kmdice-gui.pro` in Qt Creator and build from GUI.

@Decker Works good on Debian 👍🏼 
One suggestion I would make is some indicator to user to wait when all contract UTXOs are in use
Currently, from a user view it seems to sit there and be unresponsive (because it can't bet at that point in time)

Is this some kind of record?

[24-Oct-18 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r You're thinking too narrowly
The cli will give you *something* as a result of `dicebet` there is an error field in the JSON when there's an error
`on err print 'shit is used up, wait your ass a minute'`

[24-Oct-18 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it cannot defferentiate between entroy and locatl wallet ...

[24-Oct-18 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the onyl place you can find no entroy is in stdout

[24-Oct-18 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
CC_EVAL cant send back to JSON, yet ... I hear there are people working on this.

[24-Oct-18 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if [[ -n "$result" && "$result" == "error" ]]; then` <- works and is a real thing; I promise

maybe it was somone else then

[24-Oct-18 02:39 PM] Decker#3767
for all who wanna test Windows build right now ... you need start daemon with your `-pubkey` before launch this.
