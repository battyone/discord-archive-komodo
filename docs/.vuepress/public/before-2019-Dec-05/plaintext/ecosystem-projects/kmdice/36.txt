i think i broke my node ```CCduration no hashBlock for txid a1ef2ba4be426ca7ab23ca1e1fd14c61e5e3b3f233f2c9be56ba3b17ad4ceeb1

[24-Oct-18 03:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
seems like where there is high traffic and not enough entropy this happens.

[24-Oct-18 03:11 PM] SHossain#0007
how many entropy tx you had?

[24-Oct-18 03:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it says 3 here

[24-Oct-18 03:11 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to keep making them. as users play they get consumed

[24-Oct-18 03:11 PM] SHossain#0007
3 is nothing üòÉ

[24-Oct-18 03:12 PM] Alright#0419
there's way more than 3

[24-Oct-18 03:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hmm... might it be?

[24-Oct-18 03:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, but i got this in my output: ```544b2c805183509259b53a2ea7ccde9530eb5c87c1ce4084867e1ddf40e0adff.(E 0.00100000) 9475108c3715bd079cd45f5ee1fa086b9fe52dfa00a4cbb0e569b7087e1dbbff.(E 0.00100000) numentropy tx 3: 501.94770000

@siu - Chainmakers make hundreds of them

[24-Oct-18 03:13 PM] SHossain#0007
keep making them everyday üòÉ

[24-Oct-18 03:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we did 900 about 2 days ago

[24-Oct-18 03:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and got the chain broken in the meantime üòÇ

[24-Oct-18 03:13 PM] Alright#0419
entropy tx isn't one use, doesn't dicefinish from dealer node create a new one?

[24-Oct-18 03:14 PM] SHossain#0007
entropy tx number reduces as users play

[24-Oct-18 03:14 PM] SHossain#0007
at least what i have seen during testing period

[24-Oct-18 03:14 PM] Alright#0419
does dicefinish make another entropy utxo

[24-Oct-18 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
Fairly sure it does

[24-Oct-18 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
so you might not need 100s a day

[24-Oct-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It used to create new ones ...

[24-Oct-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But didnt you make james disable it ?

[24-Oct-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
still not sure why you did that, as there is no withdraw anyway

[24-Oct-18 03:21 PM] Alright#0419
dealer was still able to choose not to put winnings back into plan

[24-Oct-18 03:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
back to normal now

[24-Oct-18 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
but, then again, @blackjok3r said that output isn't real, so what do I know?

[24-Oct-18 03:33 PM] SHossain#0007
probaly, wait for the block confirmation with all those entropy txs

@SHossain That was more of a dig at joker's new found self-exaltation than anything else
5 minutes learning C and he seems to have forgotten everything we did before that üò£

[24-Oct-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what ?

[24-Oct-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cant find dice input is ambigious

[24-Oct-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it will do the same if you have no local wallet funds

[24-Oct-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
üòï

[24-Oct-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt matter if its entropy or 0 balance

[24-Oct-18 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
If you have no local funds, then your balance is 0 not > 0
`if err && balance > 0 then ....`
"ambigious [sic]" is better than the feken thing sitting there staring at you and *appearing* to do nothing

[24-Oct-18 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
ffs this isn't rocket science

[24-Oct-18 04:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Entropy txs being sent

[24-Oct-18 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe like notaries, monitor entropy utxo and issue them if not enough

[24-Oct-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i saw 400+ bets in one block, so that used up a lot of entropy until it confirmed

[24-Oct-18 04:05 PM] jorian#4555
so entropy txes do not get back?

[24-Oct-18 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
well in most paths they should...

[24-Oct-18 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but if the dealer node doesnt finish, it wont come back

[24-Oct-18 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe there are other code paths where it doesnt

[24-Oct-18 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
when i tested it, all cases the entropy tx came back

[24-Oct-18 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but i did notice that entropy tx do get eaten

[24-Oct-18 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it could simply be when the dealer node does a finish, it needs utxo for txfee and that eats an entropy tx

[24-Oct-18 04:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
did we break it again?

[24-Oct-18 04:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah... entropy tx kill the chain

[24-Oct-18 04:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or maybe just too much betting without entropy tx

[24-Oct-18 04:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not sure

[24-Oct-18 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
any errors in the miner debug.log?

[24-Oct-18 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810

[24-Oct-18 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810

[24-Oct-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
probably just hashrate dropout

[24-Oct-18 04:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok... just took some time to digest those txs

[24-Oct-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure it should take so long to "digest" the tx

[24-Oct-18 04:54 PM] jorian#4555
lots of bets happened

[24-Oct-18 04:54 PM] jorian#4555
also a GUI happened

Hi Chmex,
I only add blockchain that are already listed on coinmarketcap. 
I can't find yours. 
What is KMDICE, is it a sidechain to Komodo ?

[24-Oct-18 05:51 PM] SHossain#0007
Tell them this is an independent chain

[24-Oct-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
unless saying that "yes it is a sidechain" gets it listed

[24-Oct-18 05:52 PM] jorian#4555
until it really gets it listed.. maybe blocktivity is pro Komodo

[24-Oct-18 05:53 PM] jorian#4555
doubt it though

[24-Oct-18 05:58 PM] CHMEX#0686
Hi Estefan,
Thank you for your swift feedback.
It is an independent chain but of course people can also call it sidechain does not really matter. It currently has 15msol which is approx 1BTC per day spent on hash only KMD has 21msols. Yes it's not on Coinmarketcap yet.
It would be great if you can list it anyways it's not some Joke Coin, Meme Coin or whatever they call it. It's secured by KMD / BTC and lots of electricity used.

[24-Oct-18 06:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
nice! thanks!
