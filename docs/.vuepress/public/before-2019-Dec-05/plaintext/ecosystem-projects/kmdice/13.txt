once funds are in it, there is no need to run anything special

[19-Oct-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
the blockchain implements the faucet

[19-Oct-18 08:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, ill do one then

[19-Oct-18 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
i think people can handle: issuing a faucetget cli

[19-Oct-18 08:29 PM] SHossain#0007
creating one

[19-Oct-18 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe a script:
hex=`./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE faucetget | js ...`
./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE sendrawtransaction $hex

[19-Oct-18 08:30 PM] SHossain#0007
done

[19-Oct-18 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont know the jc command or whatever extracts the field from json, but whatever it is can be done and then a script can be made that is call ./faucetget

[19-Oct-18 08:31 PM] SHossain#0007
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE faucetinfo
{
  "result": "success",
  "name": "Faucet",

[19-Oct-18 08:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[19-Oct-18 08:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[19-Oct-18 08:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
all blocks mined by that rental will go to faucet

[19-Oct-18 08:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
👍

[19-Oct-18 08:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I gave up on making the faucet noob friendly and just remove the new address requirement... cant do that on this chain.

my pool is paying out btw...

[19-Oct-18 08:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I was doing a copypasta and adapt the tonyl scripts for dice. . got the tx to go through but nothing more

[19-Oct-18 08:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to monitor stdout 
smks script has bug on line 66

[19-Oct-18 08:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you can fix it

[19-Oct-18 08:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wasnt hard

[19-Oct-18 09:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The wallet thing?

i'm not getting any blocks at all

[19-Oct-18 09:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
damn

[19-Oct-18 09:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
too fast! 😂

[19-Oct-18 09:44 PM] SHossain#0007
probably there is more hash

[19-Oct-18 09:44 PM] SHossain#0007
it takes time for the daemon to update total net hash

[19-Oct-18 09:44 PM] SHossain#0007
i go back to my secret testing 😛

[19-Oct-18 09:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
:p

[19-Oct-18 10:10 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
pool address?

[19-Oct-18 10:12 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
port 6333?

[19-Oct-18 10:13 PM] SHossain#0007
pool port can be different. if you are using knomp, you will find it in `pool_configs/KMDICE.json

[19-Oct-18 10:14 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
i was wondering about @blackjok3r  's pool,   3067 it says on the site i see now

[19-Oct-18 10:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah my pool ia working ... Some guy put only 400 sol on it

[19-Oct-18 10:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So I got a rental

[19-Oct-18 10:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
To make sure it gets a block

[19-Oct-18 10:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1ltc

[19-Oct-18 10:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Will donate all coins left in the pool address to faucet.. Not sure if the pool has a fee

[19-Oct-18 10:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But its working

[19-Oct-18 10:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If anyone wants to use it

[19-Oct-18 10:18 PM] jl777c#5810
what are the otc prices for KMDICE?

[19-Oct-18 10:23 PM] SHossain#0007
last i sold 2000 KMDICE for 300 KMD

[19-Oct-18 10:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so > PIRATE?

[19-Oct-18 10:24 PM] SHossain#0007
almost

[19-Oct-18 10:24 PM] SHossain#0007
0.15 each

[19-Oct-18 10:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So ridiculous...

[19-Oct-18 10:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess I can always make a faucet rapid g script and get my mined coins back out 😂

[19-Oct-18 10:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
0.1 at a time...

[19-Oct-18 10:37 PM] Alright#0419
Why did the dice plan get stuck earlier?

[19-Oct-18 10:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No dice status or entropy

[19-Oct-18 10:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They didn't read the destructiobs

[19-Oct-18 10:38 PM] jl777c#5810
and there is an easy way to withdraw funds from the dice plan

[19-Oct-18 10:38 PM] jl777c#5810
dice plan owner makes a bet with the dicefinish not being called

[19-Oct-18 10:38 PM] jl777c#5810
when it times out, then all bets win

[19-Oct-18 10:38 PM] jl777c#5810
of course this seems a oneshot as everyone else will race to do the same

[19-Oct-18 10:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔 so now the dice plan creator can exit scam?

[19-Oct-18 10:39 PM] jl777c#5810
no, it can start a free for all where all bettors win, including them

[19-Oct-18 10:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I like a fixed length table better... Table lasts for x blocks

[19-Oct-18 10:40 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway,just one trick, but dice2 can have all the fancy controls to the plans

[19-Oct-18 10:40 PM] jl777c#5810
getting it working, provably fair, and performant was the hard part

[19-Oct-18 10:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We got a roadmap :trollface:

[19-Oct-18 10:40 PM] jl777c#5810
adding options and tweaks shouldnt be hard for a CC dev to do

[19-Oct-18 10:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Some one should make a fancy roadmap with all the requested features

[19-Oct-18 10:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will await @Mihailo to think of or implement solution to cc eval being able to be returned to RPC, then I will start on cc dev stuff ;)

[19-Oct-18 11:17 PM] javadth#4536
whats the dice ?

[19-Oct-18 11:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
its a blockchain dice game,  50% of the coins were premined  and are used as the house, the rest are minable.  to get the premined coins you have to win in the dice game .  you can set your odds and amount to wager,  only available in cli right now

[19-Oct-18 11:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@blackjok3r   anyway you could increase the pool share difficulty?  😃

[19-Oct-18 11:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
in 1 hour or 2

[19-Oct-18 11:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm not home... What exactly needs doing I just used the staked template? Need more ports?

[19-Oct-18 11:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Post the diff u need can add asap my house is 100m away

[19-Oct-18 11:43 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
ok one sec let me check nicehash min diff

[19-Oct-18 11:44 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@blackjok3r  32768

[19-Oct-18 11:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That's the nomp diff? That will need a new port...

[19-Oct-18 11:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Can do, is it unwise to put a nh port on all ac?

[19-Oct-18 11:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[19-Oct-18 11:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
hmmm lets find out 😃

[19-Oct-18 11:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems like it opens up a fair few attack vectors for people looking to have some fun

[19-Oct-18 11:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
High diff port should only be active for high hash chain

[19-Oct-18 11:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Might be able to do that actually
