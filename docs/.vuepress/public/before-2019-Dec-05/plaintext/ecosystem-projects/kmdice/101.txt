@SHossain have you noticed wins with same amount of bet? this happening a lot to you?

[02-Dec-18 04:28 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[02-Dec-18 04:28 PM] SHossain#0007
quite a lot of them. same win amount as bet

[02-Dec-18 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810

[02-Dec-18 04:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

It's a pile of crap, needs jq, and crashes after 450-600 bets because of mem leak in looping...

Well, not for a casual player hehehe

[03-Dec-18 04:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Actaully you dont need todo that ....

[03-Dec-18 04:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If your playing lots, and dont have too many utxos the `cleanwallettransactions` RPC in by dev fork will work fine for all high transaction nodes.

[03-Dec-18 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As having to rewrite the wallet to somehting that actually handles high amount od txs is just about impossible, I just made it remove transaction history in runtime,instead.

[03-Dec-18 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Very simple, and very effective.

Not sure what we could do - but... anything that might be fun. Could you even script some game into discord and inv more devs in here? Up to you guys as to what your overall goals / most valuable behaviour is. But if you tell me I can try to help.

[04-Dec-18 02:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Right now the dice game is alive and well and working grat. Best thing would be to do some KMDICE giveaway for people interested in testing.

[04-Dec-18 02:33 PM] benohanlon#1119
How would they test? Is this purely dev focused? In which case do you want to be posting in bitcointalk or other forums to attract competent testers?

[04-Dec-18 02:34 PM] benohanlon#1119
How much KMDICE and how many testers would you be pleased to get? i.e. what's a win for us?
