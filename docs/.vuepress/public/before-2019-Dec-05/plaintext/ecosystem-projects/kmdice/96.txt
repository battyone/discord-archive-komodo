just started doing them now

[11-Nov-18 09:32 PM] jorian#4555
but not from dealer node

[11-Nov-18 09:33 PM] jl777c#5810
hope it works

[11-Nov-18 09:33 PM] jorian#4555
ooff, the sendmany went faster than expected

[11-Nov-18 09:33 PM] jorian#4555
might blow up miners :abusedsmily:

[11-Nov-18 09:33 PM] jorian#4555
mini SV attack here

[11-Nov-18 09:34 PM] jl777c#5810
aha! from a clean wallet, it would be 100x faster

[11-Nov-18 09:35 PM] jorian#4555
yes

[11-Nov-18 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so clearly a sleep can be added to that loop

[11-Nov-18 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810
it should keep the 0.0002 utxo at a relatively constant amount 2x a full block is the target, so i used 7777

[11-Nov-18 09:35 PM] jorian#4555
where can i check current 0.0002 utxos?

[11-Nov-18 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
./c listunspent | grep 0.0002 | wc

c is your shortcut to kmdice?

[11-Nov-18 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
entropy should also be up around 7777, but not as critical as the 0.0002

[11-Nov-18 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
by splitting the tasks threeways, i think it can now handle a fully saturated block on a sustained basis

[11-Nov-18 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
the key to keeping the -dealer=1 node alive seems to be to not do anything else on it!

[11-Nov-18 09:37 PM] jorian#4555
`have 390 0.0002 utxos, need 7777`

[11-Nov-18 09:38 PM] jorian#4555
it's in output of daemon

[11-Nov-18 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
that is not good

[11-Nov-18 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it needs to be sent from the same -pubkey

[11-Nov-18 09:40 PM] jorian#4555
ok, i'll need to do a importprivkey key "" false then

[11-Nov-18 09:41 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but it is strange, in the code it shouldnt matter

[11-Nov-18 09:50 PM] jorian#4555
i did sendmany100 from dealernode pubkey

[11-Nov-18 09:50 PM] jorian#4555
still same

the real number is 24982

[11-Nov-18 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure why the other path is not displaying it right

[11-Nov-18 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
i added a printout of it in the -dealer=1 node

i think things are looking pretty good. aha! found the problem with display, fixing

[11-Nov-18 10:43 PM] jl777c#5810
latest FSM branch fixes the display issue. still some bugs to fix for -dealer=0 side of the dealer nodes

[12-Nov-18 01:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to try and work out the wallet filter/cleaner better .. if I can get that working with txs other than notarisations it seems it can be usefl here aswell.. I have been thinking about a new way to remove old txs, get all txs in the wallet , sort by blockheight and iterate backeards down the list checking for unspents, once you count unspents that equal the balance jjst delete everythig before this last transactio. Seems much safter than the current method I tried, which can sometimes leave a rouge tx that is spent as an unspent n the wallet messig things up.

[12-Nov-18 09:03 AM] Mylo#8306
Morning all!
So as long as I keep my node online I can set up a table/diceplan ?
If yes, is there a way to know how many dealer nodes are online?

[12-Nov-18 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
dicelist

[12-Nov-18 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
shows all the dice plans, there cant be more than 1 dealer node per diceplan

[12-Nov-18 09:05 AM] Mylo#8306
Thanks

[12-Nov-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
updated FSM node. we are ready for mass stress testing

[12-Nov-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
utxo creation is split onto a different node from the realtime processing

[12-Nov-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i hope all the deadlocks are gone, but only one way to find out. the crazy level of dicebet is needed to know for sure it can handle the load

[12-Nov-18 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I finally fixed my notary node so will try and make a cdice bet blaster tonight

[12-Nov-18 12:45 PM] Mylo#8306
do you need two (or more) nodes to run a dealer node that is under heavy use?

[12-Nov-18 12:46 PM] Mylo#8306
starting with -pubkey allows dealer node to do processing, and same -pubkey on 2nd node for utxo splitting.   no more required.

[12-Nov-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
you need 2 cores, so it would be possible to setup a single server to run two instances

[12-Nov-18 12:52 PM] Mylo#8306
good to know, thanks

[12-Nov-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just realised why myt KMDICE is taking so long to sync ... there is private keys imported with thousands and thousands of bets 😂

[12-Nov-18 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
get an SSD?

[12-Nov-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its on SSD

[12-Nov-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
RAID1 samsung 860s ... not exactly super fast

[12-Nov-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its the wallet ... once it gets to 10,000 txs it slows everythign down/

[12-Nov-18 02:08 PM] jorian#4555
can you imagine how slow the dealer node is now? 😄

[12-Nov-18 02:08 PM] jorian#4555
if that ever needs a rescan we're feked

[12-Nov-18 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yep would take a long long time ... I hope my wallet cleaner works ... it doesnt seem to actually remove the data from wallet.dat ... but it does speed up the calls to wallet thigs by a large amount, just as much as if the walelt.dat was small again ... not sure why it doesnt remove it though.

[12-Nov-18 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
actually a full resync happens in about an hour (or two) last time i did it

[12-Nov-18 02:11 PM] jorian#4555
a resync without importing the privkey of dealer node

[12-Nov-18 02:11 PM] jorian#4555
with dealer node key it's taking a long time

[12-Nov-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Worst is, you cant even put a spent filter on the walelt during sync, as it doesnt know the utxo is spent 😦

[12-Nov-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
only way around it is to sync without then z_importkey the last X blocks

[12-Nov-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and I found btw that normal importprivkey can have a resacan height aswell... it just doesnt use it and defaults to chaintip

[12-Nov-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[12-Nov-18 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
utxo are slightly down but i think just from one block worth of bets

[12-Nov-18 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems there is an issue mining during a dicebet blast

[12-Nov-18 02:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or coincidental to hashrate?

[12-Nov-18 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
aha, yes, maybe so but not sure if the hashrate is lower due to lower hashrate or daemon problems due to big mempool

[12-Nov-18 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when I was testing chickenpool over the weekend and 3 of us were spamming, it seemed everything was good until folks started driving price up on nh (not sure how much hash is rented vs actual, no one was willing to answer the last time I asked)
