Yes

[18-Oct-19 08:19 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I made a small bet on KMDICE with 
```
komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicebet "KMDICE" "5be49570c56d036abb08b6d084da93a8a86f58fc48db4a1086be95540d752d6f" 0.001 777
```
then broadcast the tx, when I check the status of tx with `dicestatus`, the result is 
```
{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "bet still pending"
}
```
since block 519187, & it is still pending, any idea why or how to make it confirmed ?

[18-Oct-19 08:29 PM] Alright#0419
just wait, and you'll win 😛 @PHBA2061

I want to build an equivalent of eth dice dapp, on komodo using cc-dice, that's why I want to start playing around with KMDICE first 😃

[18-Oct-19 08:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
several had a dream of that before sudoku and k64 were abandoned

[18-Oct-19 08:50 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I was excited about K64, thought I could learn something from them, turn out to be an disappointment 😕  
I've built a dice smart-contract on Eth. before, it's not very complicated, so I think I should start doing the same thing on Komodo

[18-Oct-19 08:55 PM] jorian#4555
@Alright maybe you can talk with PHBA

[18-Oct-19 08:58 PM] jorian#4555
kmdice wallets are rescanning. might take a while

[18-Oct-19 08:59 PM] jorian#4555
@PHBA2061 i think it's not hard to create your own cc-dice chain though

[18-Oct-19 09:17 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah, I was thinking about that too, but since KMDICE already has 3 funding contracts, I gave it a try first

[19-Oct-19 03:17 PM] PHBA2061#2530
the bet finally confirmed, somehow I managed to lose 10 times in a row 😂

[19-Oct-19 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
depending on the odds, I've lost over 1000 in a row before 😛
