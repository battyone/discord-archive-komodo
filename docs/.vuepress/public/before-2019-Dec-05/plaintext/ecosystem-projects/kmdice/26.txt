yea and kill the chain's emissions

[22-Oct-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
making the dealier node forfeit makes it trustless

[22-Oct-18 07:41 PM] Alright#0419
dealer node goes down, anyone can take any amount from the contract

[22-Oct-18 07:41 PM] Alright#0419
chain relies on that dealer node not going down

[22-Oct-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
timeout is 10 hours

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ my bad. i've been making so much mistakes today. probably it is just one of those days üòâ

[22-Oct-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
plz make a suggestion on how to make it not rely on a dealer node being online and still be realtime

[22-Oct-18 07:42 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[22-Oct-18 07:42 PM] forkwitch#6080
We talked about it today. Yes

[22-Oct-18 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
dealer can run multiple nodes

[22-Oct-18 07:42 PM] Alright#0419
but 10.5M of the coins are in one dealer's dice plan

[22-Oct-18 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
no worry about it running out

[22-Oct-18 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
there is only one house with this chain concept

[22-Oct-18 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the house is basically a socialized bankroll

[22-Oct-18 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
one that matters at least

[22-Oct-18 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it could have had 64 different dice plans

[22-Oct-18 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it is what it is and if the dealer node goes down for prolonged period, people get free money

[22-Oct-18 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
i highly suggest to run redundant nodes for the dealer node

[22-Oct-18 07:44 PM] Alright#0419
so some government subpoenas the dealer node of 10.5M KMDICE plan

[22-Oct-18 07:44 PM] Alright#0419
says "hey, stop that"

[22-Oct-18 07:44 PM] Alright#0419
chain is dead?

[22-Oct-18 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
airdrop to new chain

[22-Oct-18 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
always have an escape clause

[22-Oct-18 07:45 PM] Alright#0419
I think it worth looking into a way where the dealer could respond with "sorry, can't"

[22-Oct-18 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and dealer node can grind entropy and make 100% winning bets

[22-Oct-18 07:46 PM] Alright#0419
what is it @Deleted User

[22-Oct-18 07:47 PM] Alright#0419
but decentralization isn't....

üòê

[22-Oct-18 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
@Alright if the dealer nodes go offline that is frustrating, but we hope chainmakers can keep some nodes running constant

[22-Oct-18 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
if each bet takes minutes, nobody would use it

[22-Oct-18 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is a way to use homomorphic encryption to be able to have the blockchain sign tx and run the dealer node, but it is beyond my expertise

[22-Oct-18 07:49 PM] Alright#0419
it's undeniably a single point of failure, that is my entire point

[22-Oct-18 07:49 PM] Alright#0419
it works as long as that single point does not fail

[22-Oct-18 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, a trustless provably fair single point of failure

[22-Oct-18 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
the next chain will learn from this and partiion funds into more than a single global bankroll.

[22-Oct-18 07:50 PM] Alright#0419
what is the fastest possible "trustless" source of entropy we could grab

[22-Oct-18 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
though it is quite impressive to have a million dollar bankroll appear out of thin air

[22-Oct-18 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
one minute

[22-Oct-18 07:50 PM] Alright#0419
we discussed using another chain's future merkle roots

[22-Oct-18 07:51 PM] Alright#0419
but could we use KMDICE's merkle roots itself?

[22-Oct-18 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
no!

[22-Oct-18 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
miner can cheat

[22-Oct-18 07:51 PM] Alright#0419
then you can throw some txs in the mempool, if they were confirmed, you can be sure miner didn't cheat it

[22-Oct-18 07:52 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_is off to do things, but leaving solo pool and 2M running for now_

[22-Oct-18 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
wrong

[22-Oct-18 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
miner puts all tx in the mempool and then adds an extra one to grind the desired entropy

[22-Oct-18 07:53 PM] Alright#0419
Ah understood

[22-Oct-18 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
also, mempool isnt consensus safe to rely on

[22-Oct-18 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
so it will be very tricky to punish a mempool violator without splitting the chain

[22-Oct-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i got lucky with my 51% design in that it could be placed right at the moment the dealer determines win/loss + refund

[22-Oct-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it is very tricky stuff, you need to think of all possible attacks

I don't see 2 second rule as important as decentralization

[22-Oct-18 07:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you need to `sudo apt install figlet jq`

[22-Oct-18 07:57 PM] Alright#0419
make a betting website, no need to use a blockchain if it's centralized around a single private key

[22-Oct-18 07:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
lol

[22-Oct-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, make a chain that isnt realtime and we can compare popularity

[22-Oct-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
if only there wasnt the cheat by putting in poisoned entropy

[22-Oct-18 07:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
oh shit... im getting addicted... ill lose all my coins NOO!!!!

[22-Oct-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
we could publish the dealer privkey

[22-Oct-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
then it would be decentralised

[22-Oct-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
but everybody would be able to cheat

[22-Oct-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe someone can add decentralized to the current solution

[22-Oct-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
solving the 51% made it viable

[22-Oct-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
and we all know mass market windows people wont care about dependence on a single privkey, if it is provably fair and trustless

@Deleted User talk about notary nodes? please dm me!

[22-Oct-18 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
one question is if the 51% fixed KMDICE is the best solution in the industry to date

[22-Oct-18 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
not familiar with other dice blockchains if any. most seem to do a daily reveal of entropy secret, but that isnt trustless as bets are resolved and you need to trust the house will reveal the entropy

[22-Oct-18 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
and not sure how realtime they are

[22-Oct-18 08:06 PM] Alright#0419
@jorian @siu - Chainmakers *someone* should run dealer node behind tor

[22-Oct-18 08:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[22-Oct-18 08:14 PM] jorian#4555
need to do dico

[22-Oct-18 08:15 PM] Alright#0419
maybe we could base entropy on oracles? Have N number of nodes submitting random stuff every single block, combine them, instead of dealer providing hash of entropy, dealer only provides which order to take the oracles in

[22-Oct-18 08:16 PM] Alright#0419
the data submitted could be some arbitrary data feed that no one would likely be able to influence

[22-Oct-18 08:16 PM] Alright#0419
say some data taken from twitter usage or something like that

[22-Oct-18 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes oraclizing random data is a fine idea

[22-Oct-18 08:17 PM] Alright#0419
or make all nodes have to agree on that entropy

[22-Oct-18 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
when i wrote dice CC, oracles CC didnt exist

[22-Oct-18 08:17 PM] Alright#0419
if 15/16 nodes say "this is the latest" and one is disagreeing, throw it out

[22-Oct-18 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes the issue becomes latency

[22-Oct-18 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
you could generate a hash chain from a seed but then the ordering of tx determines the RNG

[22-Oct-18 08:18 PM] jorian#4555

[22-Oct-18 08:18 PM] Alright#0419
could some arbitrary number be used as the order?

[22-Oct-18 08:19 PM] Alright#0419
instead of a centralized person saying "this is the order", could we take something like merkle root or block hash and make it determine order? The attacker would have to submit data that will influence the entropy and also mine the block

[22-Oct-18 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
CHIPS solves the realtime multicomputation of RNG

[22-Oct-18 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a difficult problem if you remember seeing the CHIPS math paper, and that was not good enough, we iterated on it one more time
