these "fork" issues from what I have heard is that your own node loses sync with the mainchain, but no other node is affected

[26-Oct-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe this is disincentive for the spamming?

[26-Oct-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
I think I know why getblocktemplate is not putting in all the tx from mempool

[26-Oct-18 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
with many dicebets using mempool utxo, depending on the order you add tx to a block, it might not allow all the mempool tx to be mined. the issue is in miner.cpp where it creates a block. I think fixing that would make things a lot better as it would recycle bets that much better, but still eventually utxo will run out

[26-Oct-18 07:05 PM] Oszy#5734
i think it's something like that. when it didn't work i was always behind a few blocks

[26-Oct-18 07:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i got the fork today... i was not spamming

[26-Oct-18 07:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
playing, but no spamming

[26-Oct-18 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so the behavior is making bets can cause a node to lose sync...

[26-Oct-18 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
this seems to indicate some sort of mempool based consensus issue

[26-Oct-18 07:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, definitively something is up.

[26-Oct-18 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[26-Oct-18 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
we need this isolated and understood so we can fix it

[26-Oct-18 07:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It was working quite well all day... 99% of the bets went through smoothly

[26-Oct-18 07:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but suddenly i got a bet still pending and when i checked getinfo it was forked.

[26-Oct-18 07:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It could be that 2 bets select the same utxo in the house and when the first one confirms, the second one gets orphaned

[26-Oct-18 07:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
?

[26-Oct-18 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be it ends up in your mempool, but not in the real mempool that gets mined

[26-Oct-18 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so your node thinks you did a bet, but really it didnt happen

[26-Oct-18 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, this feels like what is happening from the reported behavior

[26-Oct-18 07:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`ok, so the behavior is making bets can cause a node to lose sync..`
It has to be a little more than *just* that; I've been running my autoplay off and on for 2 days and during "the big lock up" was the only time I experienced the fork

[26-Oct-18 07:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
now i reindexed the chain and getting this all the time ```CCduration no hashBlock for txid 6b6f204b8c6e2a4b6a574704d20fbb129721d90821f575c05d71cd047f00c501
```

[26-Oct-18 07:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆🏼 that I still haven't figured out

[26-Oct-18 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
what i mean is that the mempool must be affecting the consensus. maybe it is simply due to being orphaned

[26-Oct-18 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
6b6f204b8c6e2a4b6a574704d20fbb129721d90821f575c05d71cd047f00c501

[26-Oct-18 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
is not in the explorer

[26-Oct-18 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
was orphaned

[26-Oct-18 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you clear that tx from the wallet, it should fix things

[26-Oct-18 07:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that would mean a resync?

[26-Oct-18 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i think there is a way to cancel a tx from wallet

[26-Oct-18 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
via rpc call

[26-Oct-18 07:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jl777c it doesn't seem that mempool/consensus is even an issue with that as I get it even with same node as my pool

[26-Oct-18 07:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE resendwallettransactions

]
```

[26-Oct-18 07:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if a consensus thing, then it has to be consensus ruleset

[26-Oct-18 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
there is the whole realtime mempool response aspect...

[26-Oct-18 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the dicebet rpc needs to check for the bet being orphaned

[26-Oct-18 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
or dicestatus

[26-Oct-18 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess a new rpc needs to be made to delete an orphaned txid from the wallet, but I thought it did that automatically

[26-Oct-18 07:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
`resendwallettransactions` solved it for me

[26-Oct-18 07:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no i can bet

[26-Oct-18 07:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my halfassed workaround was to just self restart the script if pending was the result after 3x 5 second trys and a 90 second wait

resendwallettransactions is a good workaround for now

[26-Oct-18 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
so i think dicestatus needs to check for orphaned tx and maybe this can be fixed automatic

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 On which odds?

[26-Oct-18 09:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
3.4

[26-Oct-18 09:08 PM] TonyL#3577
3 and 4  combined?

[26-Oct-18 09:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
0.1 less than three and one half

[26-Oct-18 09:11 PM] TonyL#3577
If you have an average odds of your bets 3.4  it assumes ~22,7% average wins
You have  17,7% so a little bit unlucky ☹
