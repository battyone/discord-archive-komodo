Look at the mempool prints for this chain... everyone is trying to spend spent utxos

[29-Apr-19 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ive been using it to make this snapshot thing for days

[29-Apr-19 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you just tried to spend spent utxos`
I didn't write the CC, so I didn't try to do any such thing :troll:

[29-Apr-19 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not the CC, its the function that choses CC inputs

[29-Apr-19 03:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I know, just teasing him 😛

[29-Apr-19 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
by sending a transaction that tries to spend spent utxos, *you* tried to spend spent utxos

[29-Apr-19 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can somewhat fix it, but uncommenting some code I added that randomoizes what utxo it chooses

[29-Apr-19 03:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm too busy for all that, I just wanted to play a few rolls in between adding it to pool 😛

[07-May-19 07:47 PM] ciumete#3212
why the sync of blockchain is so slow ?! no network traffic with 3 connections active , no hdd actifity !!!

[08-May-19 09:53 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It may have to do with the number of txs this chain has

[08-May-19 09:53 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It has way more transactions than your average chain

[08-May-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181

Hi Im new to kmdice, Im abit confuse so can anyone kind to explain whats the different between Kmdice and chips? Do both need to work in parallel?

[27-May-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
they are totally different

[27-May-19 10:44 AM] SVET5#3137
From my understanding, chips are for card games like poker. What about kmdice?

[27-May-19 10:48 AM] gcharang#6833
dice is just betting on a provably random number and automatic payout of the bet - all in a decentralised way
it is a proof of concept on which many other games where a "provably random number" is needed and no one need to trust anyone else can be built

[27-May-19 10:52 AM] SVET5#3137
Seems cool, does it mean it could be applied on games like roulette, sic bo or slot machines?

[27-May-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810

yes and pretty sure there is some sort of gui for dice, not sure of details
