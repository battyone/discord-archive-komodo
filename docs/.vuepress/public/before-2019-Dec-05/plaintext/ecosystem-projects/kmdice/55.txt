if I fixed it right

[28-Oct-18 04:41 AM] Alright#0419
so one of us needs to ignore the other's txs?

[28-Oct-18 04:42 AM] Alright#0419
I can just reject all txs other than my own then eat up all the entropy

[28-Oct-18 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I changed it so that dicevalidate needs the entropy TX to be confirmed

[28-Oct-18 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rahter than unconnfirmed which tbh seems to make no sense and was alikely a mistake

[28-Oct-18 04:42 AM] Alright#0419
Oh wait

[28-Oct-18 04:42 AM] Alright#0419
you need to do that

[28-Oct-18 04:42 AM] Alright#0419
reject all txs other than your own

[28-Oct-18 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it works 100% perectly fine

[28-Oct-18 04:42 AM] Alright#0419
and place bets while I'm betting

[28-Oct-18 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think if you just spam a bunch of bets it will be ok

[28-Oct-18 04:43 AM] Alright#0419
this way we don't need to time it perfectly

[28-Oct-18 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
shouldnt need perfect timeing

[28-Oct-18 04:43 AM] Alright#0419
start your daemon with `-minrelaytxfee=1`

[28-Oct-18 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its reindexing

[28-Oct-18 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
soon

[28-Oct-18 04:43 AM] Alright#0419
then you can try bets while I'm eating up all the entropy?

[28-Oct-18 04:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as I cna see entropy txs... I can try and bet, but if you spent them already you will fork I think... or maybe not

[28-Oct-18 04:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh having entropy being able to be spent from empool seems stupid, so this should fix it for sure

[28-Oct-18 04:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
along with blocknotify on dealer to keep it full

[28-Oct-18 04:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
stated it with that parm

[28-Oct-18 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant send any txs with that lol

[28-Oct-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Down to 7 entropy now still working

[28-Oct-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181

I need a couple minutes

[28-Oct-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all good they seems to return after a block

[28-Oct-18 04:56 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r k, did you need something from me

[28-Oct-18 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just bet

[28-Oct-18 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
send bets one after the other

[28-Oct-18 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
entroy ran out and my node bailed, as I added check for under 2 entropy stop

[28-Oct-18 04:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure if i had time to try and spend an entropy

[28-Oct-18 04:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
probably need to just keep doing it .

[28-Oct-18 04:59 AM] Alright#0419
use all the entropy?

[28-Oct-18 05:00 AM] Alright#0419
should i*

[28-Oct-18 05:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[28-Oct-18 05:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think so at least

[28-Oct-18 05:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just bet normally

[28-Oct-18 06:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant know for sure, but since I made that change I have not been able to amke ti stall/fork

[28-Oct-18 06:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I also figured out how to get error message to return to JSON

[28-Oct-18 06:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But I will only do it for DICE CC, as its a lot of screwing around

I need more entropy and more people to bet at once to make sure this is working.

I'm not around a lot today

[28-Oct-18 06:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sure no worries, I am jsut 99% sure this has fixed the problem and we need you to test it properly. there is enough entropy but timing it ishard

[28-Oct-18 06:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you could add 100 more that would help

[28-Oct-18 06:51 AM] jorian#4555
100 entropy TX?

[28-Oct-18 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes pelase

[28-Oct-18 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can set up the auto fill script later... if you dont ahve time but 100 will enable me to test the fork fix at least

[28-Oct-18 06:52 AM] jorian#4555
ok doing now

[28-Oct-18 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks man, enjoy your sunday

[28-Oct-18 07:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am now able to bet massive loops without a fork or floods of errors

[28-Oct-18 07:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but until other people bet at the same time, I cant be 100%

[28-Oct-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its working, because now its getting mad at me on DiceFinish for `could not find bet or entropy tx` I assume this is from invalidating the mempool TX that was previously forking/stalling the chain.

[28-Oct-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will need some kind of error check in script for this I think

[28-Oct-18 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
going to solve this by @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢's suggestion and have dicestatus return `null` when a tx gets invalidated.

[28-Oct-18 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems I have worked out how to return errors to JSON ... now I had a 1000 KMD bounty out for this ... guess I pay myself :trollface:

[28-Oct-18 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
requiring entropy tx to be confirmed is a good fix! Seems the theory about mempool causing the local fork was indeed correct and a single addtional check would avoid this issue. great work!

[28-Oct-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
only the entropytx is in a globally shared pool for all players

[28-Oct-18 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes it appears to work, I really need someon other people to spam bets a single node cant really cause the fork on its own.

[28-Oct-18 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is plenty of entropy atm

[28-Oct-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no lock utxo globally rpc, would need a centralized node to even implement that

{Reactions}
👌 

[28-Oct-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
but by requiring entropy tx to be confirmed, the dicebet itself does not have to be confirmed as the other vins are not globally shared

[28-Oct-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes dicebet is unconfirmed, entopy is confirmed... problem seems solved

[28-Oct-18 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
so I missed a single additional constraint, sorry about that

[28-Oct-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I also fixed errors for dicestatus and dicebet

[28-Oct-18 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
bugs happen

[28-Oct-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so the user has some feedback

[28-Oct-18 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
especially when it is a complex realtime system on top of the complex blockchain/mempool system

[28-Oct-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes layers of complexity .... I spent a while on this one... 90% of the time reading and thinking

[28-Oct-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
i still feel that under load, there will still be a few more edge cases, but we should be good for a 10x increase in usage before we hit them

[28-Oct-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes we need a few more people to stress it with me....

[28-Oct-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just testng latest error checks... then shoule be ok to merge

[28-Oct-18 09:08 AM] Oszy#5734
I just fully resynced the chain to test it, and still getting "bet still pending" result. on the first try,and is there anything else i could do to make it work again?

[28-Oct-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should not.. I just did like 100 bets, 10 loops of 10 in paralell on 1 node 0 errors or failss

[28-Oct-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it can take a while

[28-Oct-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ideally a good script should b used thta polls dice finish

[28-Oct-18 09:10 AM] Oszy#5734
it looks like after fully syncing the sync is stopped at the last block and didn't move since

[28-Oct-18 09:11 AM] Oszy#5734
"blocks": 15282,
  "longestchain": 15289,

[28-Oct-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need the newest build

[28-Oct-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with my fixes

[28-Oct-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think its merged yet

i changed the min entropy needed to 10

[28-Oct-18 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
2 is too low as 3 simultaneous bettors could end up choosing the same utxo. even though it should be cleanly handled now, the local bet will fail. much better to have the dealer node make sure there are 10+ entropy tx

[28-Oct-18 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes 2 was mostly for my testing when total was 14

[28-Oct-18 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
makes sense

[28-Oct-18 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the getblock funtion is not good code, but I wasnt able to call it

[28-Oct-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
with a blocknotify setting the entropy tx to 100+number of bets that block, it should be able to handle growth of 100 bets per block

[28-Oct-18 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, using dicestatus you cna check entropy on blocknotarify (it should be accurate excatly at this time) then create entropy to a threshold

[28-Oct-18 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
at validation time you are constrained in what you can do
