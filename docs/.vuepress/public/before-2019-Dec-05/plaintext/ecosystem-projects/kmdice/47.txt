can anyone tell me? It's like i refresh to check and suddenly it's not showing - but it has been paying out today a little so 🤷🏻

[27-Oct-18 05:11 PM] benohanlon#1119
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 shud be about 60 cos it's 4 x Z9 minis

[27-Oct-18 05:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then it sounds like a pool issue

[27-Oct-18 05:12 PM] benohanlon#1119
OK https://forkwitch.com simply says #kmdice is the place to say 😄

SELLING 1500 ARRR  = 0.115 KMD each
SELLING 350 KMDICE = 0.3 KMD each

[27-Oct-18 05:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Selling KMDICE @ 0.2 KMD each.

Anyone know how long it takes pool.forkwitch.com to recognize and post data for a new address?  My miner says I'm connected but the pool doesn't show any connection after 20 minutes...

Use BarterDEX atomic swap for KMDICE

💯 ☝ 👍 

[27-Oct-18 06:26 PM] Llama#1330
Yeah

[27-Oct-18 06:27 PM] vogelfreund#4122
how it works, can i log in with my agama seed?

[27-Oct-18 06:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
log in where?

[27-Oct-18 06:56 PM] vogelfreund#4122
on barterdex. but it dont connect

[27-Oct-18 07:02 PM] SHossain#0007
@vogelfreund you will find using BarterDEX very hard. Try swapping BEER/PIZZA first using HyperDEX and learn how it works. BarterDEX GUI is for advanced users and devs.

[27-Oct-18 07:07 PM] Decker#3767
@SHossain i don't think that the BarterDEX GUI is for advanced users. We just need understandable description with examples of all functions and basics. Mean, before start BarterDEX every user should understand basic things:
1. what is utxo?
2. what is atomic swap and what the differencies between bdex and cex.
3. steps needed to swap complete.
4. small api description (users should know that alice and bob api exists, and should understand the difference between it)
without these basics - yes, users can find barterdex hard.

[27-Oct-18 07:09 PM] SHossain#0007
Thanks @Decker. @gcharang can you please make a doc detailing those points that @Decker mentioned?

[27-Oct-18 07:09 PM] SHossain#0007
That will be helpful. Thanks

[27-Oct-18 07:09 PM] Decker#3767
Also nice to have some graphics explaining swaps, like this: https://bitnovosti.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/one-output-animation.gif

[27-Oct-18 07:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
most confusing part is adding the coins, at least last time I used it

[27-Oct-18 07:11 PM] Decker#3767
@SHossain we have few docs and articles, but seems good idea is to make "Help" menu in BarterDEX interface with a "table of contents" (like How to use?), and all of these links in one place.

[27-Oct-18 07:12 PM] SHossain#0007
That would be also nice

[27-Oct-18 07:13 PM] SHossain#0007
probably something for first time users as splash screen explaining those would be good, along with the how to add coins video

[27-Oct-18 07:13 PM] SHossain#0007
we will try to get something done initially.

[27-Oct-18 07:14 PM] SHossain#0007
if not splash screen, a guide is first priority.

[27-Oct-18 07:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what we really need is an army of liquidty providers

[27-Oct-18 07:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if no reliable servers are online, then nothing will work as expected

[27-Oct-18 07:49 PM] SHossain#0007
no one is buying KMDICE in BarterDEX. even though there is a very high-end server running mm

[27-Oct-18 07:49 PM] SHossain#0007
i wanted to see how good that setup is

[27-Oct-18 07:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hehe

[27-Oct-18 07:50 PM] SHossain#0007
there are actually 4 sellers now

[27-Oct-18 07:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think that only 2 are in vps

[27-Oct-18 07:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or at least well setup

[27-Oct-18 07:52 PM] SHossain#0007
where is your easy app?

[27-Oct-18 07:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
easy app?

[27-Oct-18 07:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
never got to be created 😦

[27-Oct-18 07:53 PM] SHossain#0007
the whitelabel one

problem is that i left it with open prices, not fixed to a specific server and the only price it offers is for .21kmd

[27-Oct-18 07:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
which is a server that is not well setup

OK, forked again
observation from my end (if it helps any):

`8d6dbe8548a3ccdac04e28cdaf73b1cb16486528f105a6e1851058de6a63053f` stuck in  `bet still pending`

[27-Oct-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
thanks for this, it narrows it down

[27-Oct-18 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so the first 2 confirmed, but the third didnt?

[27-Oct-18 08:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the 3rd (the "split causer") is confirmed on the chain and checks out during a reindex, but not at the time that it forks

[27-Oct-18 08:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
also, the 3rd isn't involving my node at all (or my bets)

[27-Oct-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
are you running FSM branch?

[27-Oct-18 08:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dev

[27-Oct-18 08:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what's "FSM"?

[27-Oct-18 08:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
a branch

[27-Oct-18 08:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
noooooooooo?

[27-Oct-18 08:48 PM] SHossain#0007
Finite State Machine?

[27-Oct-18 08:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🙄

[27-Oct-18 08:48 PM] SHossain#0007
FSM branch has a workaround fix for this when I pinged everyone earlier

[27-Oct-18 08:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
will it effect my other chains?

[27-Oct-18 08:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, Finite State Machine

[27-Oct-18 08:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no

[27-Oct-18 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
FSM should work for the other chains, but it is the bleeding edge

[27-Oct-18 08:50 PM] SHossain#0007
back in days we tested `jl777` branch a lot. now, it is `FSM`

[27-Oct-18 08:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
FSM should work on all chains without CC no problem

[27-Oct-18 08:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We had to keep to a single chain on staked when testing oracles

[27-Oct-18 08:51 PM] SHossain#0007
there are some nice features and fixes present

[27-Oct-18 08:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I hope they are not show dice entropy in diceinfo

[27-Oct-18 08:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am just about to test that

[27-Oct-18 08:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😄

[27-Oct-18 08:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has a bad tendency to forget that 1 chain is on x branch and others may not be when he reboots 😛_

[27-Oct-18 08:52 PM] SHossain#0007
just leave those chains running

[27-Oct-18 08:52 PM] SHossain#0007
update daemon and use for specific coin

[27-Oct-18 08:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes its not nice to have to do... thats why I made staked repo choose branch and build all chains their own binaries automatically

[27-Oct-18 08:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
any chain can have any branch, withoput affecting others, or human error

[27-Oct-18 08:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`just leave those chains running` 
_looks for the `reboot but keep app x running during reboot` command_

[27-Oct-18 08:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
😂

[27-Oct-18 08:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You could use the StakedNotary repo and change the assetchains.json accordingly for any chains you want to use.

[27-Oct-18 08:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and disable start_iguana script so it only starts komodods

[27-Oct-18 09:17 PM] Alright#0419
^this is very useful for any machine that has many chains running on different branches

[27-Oct-18 09:17 PM] Alright#0419
set it up right, and it's a single script to run after reboot

[27-Oct-18 09:18 PM] Alright#0419
will update the branches for you also

[27-Oct-18 09:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
FSm branch = same result
`2018-10-27 21:19:10 ERROR: CScriptCheck(): d134e6434060a98cc91b227ba8d8bfff700828bad497358b3049a2112d559034:2 VerifySignature failed: Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element`
was also in debug.log at point of fork, if that helps

[27-Oct-18 09:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so even with FSM branch it doesnt sync? is it stuck or on its own fork?

[27-Oct-18 09:21 PM] Alright#0419
do we have a "good" chain?

it synced and after two back-to-back "stuck" bets, it forked

[27-Oct-18 09:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at each fork,
`CC Eval EVAL_DICE Invalid: always should find vin.0, but didnt for wlt spending tx....`
seems to be in the print and
`ERROR: CScriptCheck(): ...:.. VerifySignature failed: Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element`
in the debug.log

[27-Oct-18 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
by fork, you mean it is on its own chain?

[27-Oct-18 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess you are mining on a node connected to the betting node

[27-Oct-18 09:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by "fork", I mean that it refuses the next network accepted block (and as such the only block it will accept *will be* a fork)
currently not mining, but was earlier and did end up with private fork chain

[27-Oct-18 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the FSM branch should get it back on track, has a workaround for this, but clearly we need to find and fix the causal issue for this forking

[27-Oct-18 09:27 PM] jl777c#5810
some mempool dependency on consensus is my assessment
