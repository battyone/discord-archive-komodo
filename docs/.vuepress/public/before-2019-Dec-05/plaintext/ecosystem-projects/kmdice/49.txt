if it bails on dicebet this should stop it forking.

[27-Oct-18 10:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that prints when there are no entropy utxos`
@Alright the fact that the contract lacks UTXOs shouldn't return that the bettor needs to check if **they** have funds

we need to fix the core issue, but if this change is made to dicebet, then it will more clearly indicate what is going on

[27-Oct-18 10:26 PM] jl777c#5810

yes wont sync, same issue as wlasys happens when I spam dicebet ...

[27-Oct-18 10:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thinking if its checking for entropy first it might help

[27-Oct-18 10:34 PM] Alright#0419
Are nodes always getting stuck at that height or is it different for each

[27-Oct-18 10:35 PM] Alright#0419
I didn't have any nodes get stuck 🤔

[27-Oct-18 10:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`same issue as wlasys happens when I spam dicebet `
moral of the story: stop spamming 😉

[27-Oct-18 10:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it depends when you empty the entropy

[27-Oct-18 10:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This is how you fix it

[27-Oct-18 10:35 PM] Alright#0419
Oh

[27-Oct-18 10:35 PM] Alright#0419

[27-Oct-18 10:35 PM] Alright#0419
look at getmempoolinfo

[27-Oct-18 10:35 PM] jl777c#5810
for now, let us not spam without checking numentropytx > 10

[27-Oct-18 10:35 PM] Alright#0419
tons of txs in mempool?

[27-Oct-18 10:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
24

[27-Oct-18 10:35 PM] Alright#0419
oh nope

[27-Oct-18 10:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well that means @jl777c  I cant spam at all bevcause its under 10

[27-Oct-18 10:36 PM] Alright#0419
was thinking it was that rule I talked about in which a a tx can spend inputs from mempool within a single block

[27-Oct-18 10:36 PM] Alright#0419
which *apparently* doesn't exist?

[27-Oct-18 10:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it does

[27-Oct-18 10:36 PM] jl777c#5810
but if two nodes spend the same entropytx, the mempools end up with txA vs txB

[27-Oct-18 10:36 PM] jl777c#5810
i explained it above

[27-Oct-18 10:36 PM] Alright#0419
yes, but why is that a problem?

[27-Oct-18 10:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i explained

[27-Oct-18 10:37 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a bug that consensus must depend on state of mempool

[27-Oct-18 10:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
problem seems ovbious... if entropy is too low, 2 nodes spend same one.

[27-Oct-18 10:37 PM] jl777c#5810
or having a tx orphaned creates a consensus problem

[27-Oct-18 10:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dealer needs to script entropy above X

[27-Oct-18 10:38 PM] Alright#0419
I can get the network in that state

[27-Oct-18 10:38 PM] jl777c#5810
so if we can NOT do dicebet when < 10 entropytx and the problem goes away

[27-Oct-18 10:38 PM] Alright#0419
differing mempools

[27-Oct-18 10:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it reinforces this theory

[27-Oct-18 10:38 PM] Alright#0419
will that help us debug?

[27-Oct-18 10:38 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[27-Oct-18 10:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes but I need more than 10 to test it

[27-Oct-18 10:38 PM] jl777c#5810

if you are in a non-working state, going to another non-working state... what did you learn?

[27-Oct-18 10:39 PM] jl777c#5810
that it was either broken before the same as now, or in a new way too?

@siu - Chainmakers @jorian a test chain with identical setup would be very handy

[27-Oct-18 10:43 PM] jl777c#5810
so the theory is that running out of entropy tx is bad, so lets change dicebet to not bet if there isnt enough entropy, like 10

[27-Oct-18 10:44 PM] Alright#0419
and every contract that has something similar

[27-Oct-18 10:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sounds good, do you want to add that to the actual dicebet RPC or just client side?

[27-Oct-18 10:44 PM] jl777c#5810
you can make it to dicebet RPC

[27-Oct-18 10:44 PM] jl777c#5810
just do the same count of entropytx and return error in dicebet if less than 10

[27-Oct-18 10:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm mighe be posible, actualyl entropy was already avalibe from dicefund call, just needed to add a pointer to it

[27-Oct-18 10:45 PM] Alright#0419
if someone were determined to spam, they'd just remove the error

[27-Oct-18 10:45 PM] Alright#0419
in fact they could keep it below 10 always

[27-Oct-18 10:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so the theory is that running out of entropy tx is bad, so lets change dicebet to not bet if there isnt enough entropy, like 10`
so, if no splitting to more than 10, no one ever gets to bet and the whole thing dies?
