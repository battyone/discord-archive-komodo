what do you mean you bet from a different pubkey than the daemon was using

[19-Oct-18 04:45 PM] Alright#0419
you changed the contract's code?

[19-Oct-18 04:45 PM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r O.  I'm good at using wrong keys üòâ

[19-Oct-18 04:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1 entropy TX

[19-Oct-18 04:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant bet

[19-Oct-18 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
you can make dicestatus automatically create entropy txs if you like

[19-Oct-18 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
it'd never run out

[19-Oct-18 04:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I still have 90 coins left ... can I fund entropy ? or does @jorian need to

[19-Oct-18 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
it'd put all the dealer node's winning back into the plan

[19-Oct-18 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
dealer needs to make entropy txs

[19-Oct-18 04:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats the way it should be on this partcular chain

[19-Oct-18 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
you can but they won't do anything

[19-Oct-18 04:47 PM] jorian#4555
so i just dicefund some KMDICE to the fund?

[19-Oct-18 04:47 PM] Alright#0419
hold, on you'll need to rebuild your node

[19-Oct-18 04:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes

[19-Oct-18 04:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
what's the update on stream/video blockchain?

[19-Oct-18 04:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
thought I ask here as our guys are here üòâ

[19-Oct-18 04:47 PM] Alright#0419
jl changed it to not automatically make entropy UTXOs

[19-Oct-18 04:47 PM] Alright#0419
have to find the commit

[19-Oct-18 04:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@grewalsatinder  I have most of it working ... converting strings to hex in C code was sending me in circles ... you cant do it with odd numbers üòÇ  I spent 3 hours debugging something, because i randomly keyboard mashed 3 hex strings of numbers and all of them were an odd length

Oh those commits seem way too simple

[19-Oct-18 04:50 PM] Alright#0419
try it ü§∑ if it doesn't work, look at commit history of the contract and figure out what else changed

[19-Oct-18 04:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And @jl777c is out partying today :trollface:

[19-Oct-18 04:51 PM] CrisF#3405
I used dicefund to add entropy.  That was the script.

[19-Oct-18 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
I still don't understand why the chain is "dead"

[19-Oct-18 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
you flat out can't make bets?

[19-Oct-18 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
if so, why exactly?

[19-Oct-18 04:54 PM] CrisF#3405
You can still bet.

[19-Oct-18 04:55 PM] CrisF#3405
I just made one.

[19-Oct-18 04:56 PM] Alright#0419
ok, what is the problem

[19-Oct-18 04:56 PM] CrisF#3405
For me it is this ```"result": "success",
  "status": "bet still pending"```

[19-Oct-18 04:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No entropy utxo and all bets sucesfully sent are stuck in pending

[19-Oct-18 04:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just eats coins

[19-Oct-18 04:56 PM] Alright#0419
seems cron isn't working

[19-Oct-18 04:57 PM] jorian#4555
what do i run?

[19-Oct-18 04:57 PM] Alright#0419
dicestatus should clear all pending bets

[19-Oct-18 04:57 PM] jorian#4555
siu says dicefinish

[19-Oct-18 04:57 PM] Alright#0419
`komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicestatus <txid>`

[19-Oct-18 04:57 PM] jorian#4555
tell me the command

[19-Oct-18 04:57 PM] jorian#4555
yes, did that

[19-Oct-18 04:57 PM] Alright#0419
just that every couple minutes

[19-Oct-18 04:57 PM] jorian#4555
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "no txfee inputs for win/lose"
}

[19-Oct-18 04:57 PM] jorian#4555
with this in stdout: ```TX_PUBKEY invalid pubkey
ExtractDestination failed
TX_PUBKEY invalid pubkey
ExtractDestination failed
```

[19-Oct-18 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r what did you mean by you did a bet with pubkey other than the one set by daemon?

[19-Oct-18 04:58 PM] jorian#4555
```
dicestatus KMDICE f9d23769ccb481a398121d9f48ce02bafdd65e85c4be3c8464f7ab3eace03ae7
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "Diceinit error in status, is your transaction confirmed?"
}
```

[19-Oct-18 04:59 PM] CrisF#3405
@Alright  Is this any use?```#!/bin/bash
./komodo/src/komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicestatus KMDICE 5be49570c56d036abb08b6d084da93a8a86f58fc48db4a1086be95540d752d6f

[19-Oct-18 04:59 PM] Alright#0419
that's what i used for STAKED plans

[19-Oct-18 04:59 PM] Alright#0419
worked fine each week

[19-Oct-18 05:01 PM] jorian#4555
2 days ago we tested on a different chain and bets were running just fine

[19-Oct-18 05:01 PM] jorian#4555
no idea what changed

[19-Oct-18 05:01 PM] SHossain#0007
did you start the daemon with pubkey?

[19-Oct-18 05:01 PM] jorian#4555
yes

üëçüèΩ 

[19-Oct-18 05:01 PM] jorian#4555
fund pubkey i guess?

[19-Oct-18 05:02 PM] Alright#0419
doesn't matter if the pubkey address has funds

[19-Oct-18 05:02 PM] Alright#0419
any address imported will work

[19-Oct-18 05:02 PM] Alright#0419
only needs tx fees I believe

[19-Oct-18 05:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What I did exactly was use my ./startassets script to start KMDICE it used a pubkey

[19-Oct-18 05:03 PM] Alright#0419
ok, if you need something I'm around, just ping me. Trying not to get distracted from learning python right now

[19-Oct-18 05:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then I imprrted a private key with 100 KMDICE which was a diff pubey

[19-Oct-18 05:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and OI bet

[19-Oct-18 05:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it bet but had weird errors

[19-Oct-18 05:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and looped for 30 or so blocks failing

[19-Oct-18 05:03 PM] jorian#4555
i guess we broke it then

[19-Oct-18 05:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then I kiled it

[19-Oct-18 05:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and fixed the pubkey issue

[19-Oct-18 05:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but nothing worked agfter that

@Alright  do you know if timout affects the returned funding utxos ?

[19-Oct-18 05:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like are they locked for 600 blocks ? if so that explains it

[19-Oct-18 05:04 PM] Alright#0419
not locked for 600 blocks

[19-Oct-18 05:04 PM] Alright#0419
after 600 blocks, it times out

[19-Oct-18 05:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Although my using wrong -pubkey may have created an invlaid dicebet that was somehow still accetped into a block

[19-Oct-18 05:05 PM] Alright#0419
if dealer didn't do dicefinish/dicestatus within those 600 blocks, better can claim it as a win

[19-Oct-18 05:05 PM] Alright#0419
it shouldn't matter joker, but maybe

[19-Oct-18 05:05 PM] CrisF#3405
```Set the timeout block longer. If the dice creator node is offline, after the timeout block the sytem will automatically declare the bets winner and payout winning funds. Long timeout block will ensure house to not loose any funds if there is any downtime of the node and comes back online within the time.```

[19-Oct-18 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`no txfee inputs for win/lose`
```    if ( AddNormalinputs(mtx,mypk,txfee,1) == 0 )
    {
        CCerror = "no txfee inputs for win/lose";
        fprintf(stderr,"%s\n", CCerror.c_str() );
        return("");
    }```

[19-Oct-18 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
exact error

[19-Oct-18 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it appeared to stop working after that

[19-Oct-18 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
anyone can use STKDTROLL to test this condition... just start with a -pubkey thats not in your wallet then dice bet

[19-Oct-18 05:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it has instnat confs

[19-Oct-18 05:07 PM] jorian#4555

and I appoligise for my rants sometimes guys its nothing personal ... Im stuck in the middle of nowhere looking after small chidren all day, and usually stay up very late working on these things so I get some peace and quiet ... and it burns me out after a few days... need to chill out more lol
