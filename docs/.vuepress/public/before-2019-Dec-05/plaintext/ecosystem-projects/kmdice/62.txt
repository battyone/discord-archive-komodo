good that the validation seems to be reverted back to what it was before, which means the validation wasnt the issue

Can i mine kmdice on my binance kmd wallet?

[29-Oct-18 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
no!

[29-Oct-18 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
binance doesnt list KMDICE yet

My pool doesent work with z adress

[29-Oct-18 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
KMDICE doesnt require zaddr

[29-Oct-18 06:21 PM] Maat#9515
Wich means?

[29-Oct-18 06:22 PM] Hermes#6934
You need to use a transparent address

[29-Oct-18 06:22 PM] Maat#9515
Aha

[29-Oct-18 06:22 PM] Hermes#6934
zaddress was obligatory for the Pirate pool

[29-Oct-18 06:23 PM] Maat#9515
So just to tey with kmdice transparent wallet!?

[29-Oct-18 06:23 PM] Hermes#6934
t address is the standard one you will see while creating the wallet

[29-Oct-18 06:23 PM] Hermes#6934
correct

you can ask community members here in this channel or in #talk-mining

[29-Oct-18 06:24 PM] keda666#1678
how come my nicehash order is connected to pool but mining 0 share?

[29-Oct-18 06:26 PM] Hermes#6934
haven't tested nicehash

[29-Oct-18 06:28 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to set your pool's max diff very high as nicehash suggests.

are these due to your rebroadcast?

[29-Oct-18 08:24 PM] SHossain#0007
blocks seems normal now.

[29-Oct-18 08:27 PM] jorian#4555
weird. 260 txns block, it is just above the 128-256 range

[29-Oct-18 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it could be that optimal varint encoding is required

[29-Oct-18 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
and using 2 byte len varint means doing it for 128 to 253 might be rejected

[29-Oct-18 08:45 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
the only way to know for sure is someone is going to have to add some prints to their pool and keep an active eye on how big the blocks are that it's trying to make

[29-Oct-18 08:47 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
or set minblocksize and maxblocksize to that range and make them on purpose

[29-Oct-18 10:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Maat the chain is being debuged and has moments where its not operational so i guess some holders might freak out.

[29-Oct-18 10:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No worries, im sure everything will be solved and this will only get better.

[30-Oct-18 12:01 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
nh isn't working with what?

[30-Oct-18 12:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Has anyone tested that new version or did you just update, you need to male sure that txs your trying to send are not lost for no reason... When it re adds to the mempool on block receive if you have valid txs maybe they would not be added for some reason , it seemed OK, but I ran out of day to tst it in a controlled fashion.

[30-Oct-18 12:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the miners may have issues trying to use that version, or maybe they don't, I guess a test chain will br needed to test that 100%

[30-Oct-18 12:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As having to rent nh to find a block to test changes is a bit extreme

[30-Oct-18 12:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can ape d some more time on this today but some help would be great as trying to make invalid txs on a test chain against myself with a stratum etc is going to be pretty hard

[30-Oct-18 12:34 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`As having to rent nh to find a block to test changes is a bit extreme`
Every reason I put my pool back on KMD, can't do much as 1/30 of hash when the other 29/30 are small blocking

[30-Oct-18 12:34 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Will test in a few minutes

[30-Oct-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cool... my nodes seem fine but it apears all blocks are empty

[30-Oct-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and there are simply no txs in my mempool

[30-Oct-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It could be that emptying it every block doesnt allow enough time for it to progagate through the network

[30-Oct-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I hope that isnt the case, as that means instead of just copying the whole mempool, it will need to check each tx being added to the mempool against what is in the mempool, and remove only hte invalid txs in the local mempool, to allow the txs in the block to be added.

[30-Oct-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
much more complicated

[30-Oct-18 01:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have 3 bets with results just go through so its working ok...

hi

[30-Oct-18 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes they were a bit excessive, but I needed them to check the fix was working, I guess the best confirm we have for that is for people to just use it

[30-Oct-18 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the 1 second per dicefinish is an arbitrary restriction. an optimized dealer processing that uses multiple queues for dicebet in different states should be able to handle 10x or 100x more

[30-Oct-18 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not even consensus level code, more like a multithreaded dapp, but it is inside the dice.cpp

let me try the new code

[30-Oct-18 11:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems a lot better, liekly multi threading the dealer node further is the next bottleneck.

[30-Oct-18 11:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
spamming heaps of bets from a single node, is not longer a good test, need lots of people to play at once
