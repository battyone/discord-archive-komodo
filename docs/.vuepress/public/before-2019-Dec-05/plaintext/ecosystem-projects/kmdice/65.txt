yes i saw that, was wondering why

[01-Nov-18 07:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
took me a while to work out how to do it

[01-Nov-18 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
FSM branch synced right up to latest, so all it needs is an update

[01-Nov-18 07:52 AM] Alright#0419
yep

[01-Nov-18 07:52 AM] Alright#0419
and z txs?

[01-Nov-18 07:53 AM] Alright#0419
I'll test one I guess?

[01-Nov-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you want to test it just send a few yeah ...

[01-Nov-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
checks for it are only disabled on an already confirmed block, so should not be any issue

[01-Nov-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so FSM branch survived 2 hours of tx spamming?

[01-Nov-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
dicebet spamming?

[01-Nov-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
far longer than that

[01-Nov-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not exactly spamming

[01-Nov-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just my dice bet script

[01-Nov-18 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it bets, waits for result, then for last bet to confirm then bets again

[01-Nov-18 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
started 50 of them, each does 20 bets

[01-Nov-18 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but some exit, when the first tx fails... not many going through any more

[01-Nov-18 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
after a while the wallet, is full of dust and needs to be consolidated... or it just falt cannot work any more

[01-Nov-18 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all id does is on block confirm, it does not check mempool add conditions for z-txs

[01-Nov-18 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it just adds them back with no check

[01-Nov-18 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
assuming the tx was checked the first time it was added to mempool

[01-Nov-18 08:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this will add ztx back to mempool after a confirmed block though... the best way would be to disable the mempool fix on chain sync... but couldnt work that out

[01-Nov-18 08:01 AM] Alright#0419
that error may have been from me trying to use unconfirmed coins as input

[01-Nov-18 08:01 AM] Alright#0419
not sure, testing again

[01-Nov-18 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181

ok that time input for z tx was definitely confirmed

[01-Nov-18 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
mempool fix breaking ztx is not a good thing...

[01-Nov-18 08:08 AM] Alright#0419
Can someone else try z tx on latest FSM?

[01-Nov-18 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it works with PIRATE

[01-Nov-18 08:08 AM] Alright#0419
pretty confident it's not something I'm doing, but it could be

[01-Nov-18 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
but maybe it can sync, just cant send ztx

[01-Nov-18 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems unable to send ztx

[01-Nov-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats what it was doing before

[01-Nov-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So I disabled the check on mempool fix

[01-Nov-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe its a diffrent issue

[01-Nov-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[01-Nov-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will have a look at the code in a minute and se if disabling what I did, allows a z tx just eating atm

[01-Nov-18 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, likely it cant add it back to mempool

[01-Nov-18 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
what you need to do is NOT delete it from the mempool in the first place

[01-Nov-18 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it marks the zksnark proof as spent

[01-Nov-18 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe when it goes into the mempool...

[01-Nov-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you can only remove non-ztx from the mempool, it should fix this

[01-Nov-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok will try it

[01-Nov-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure how easy that is, though, as simply `mempool.clear()`

[01-Nov-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is a lot eaier than deleting each tx as its moved to the other mempool

[01-Nov-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to make a mempool.cleartaddr()

[01-Nov-18 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
something that doesnt clear a ztx

[01-Nov-18 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure how best to do it

[01-Nov-18 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Neither lol...

[01-Nov-18 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
and dont add ztx to the tmp mempool

[01-Nov-18 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe before that, I should locally remove all changes I made and try to send a Z tx ...

[01-Nov-18 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just incase its something else

[01-Nov-18 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
FSM only has the mempool fix, including the mempool flag for ztx

[01-Nov-18 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as its a local thing, that your node cannot accept its own tx

[01-Nov-18 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and they send on other branches ?

[01-Nov-18 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or at least add to mempool ?

[01-Nov-18 08:28 AM] Alright#0419
please don't try that on KMDICE

[01-Nov-18 08:28 AM] Alright#0419
will fork it

[01-Nov-18 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because its failing the add to mempool check, the boolean is working, as if it wasnt, the check would not happen at all

[01-Nov-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i am running FSM branch on the node, i dont think it got around to broadcasting it

[01-Nov-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, fix this on some other chain!

[01-Nov-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
then we update FSM branch

[01-Nov-18 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[01-Nov-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
WLC is good

[01-Nov-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
PIZZA, BEER

[01-Nov-18 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
so we want an FSM branch with the mempool fix that still allows to send ztx

[01-Nov-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK.

[01-Nov-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im still not sure how what I did could prevent z-tx from being added to the local mempool tbh and nthing there changed at all

[01-Nov-18 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but will investigate on anothe chain

[01-Nov-18 08:31 AM] Alright#0419
`ConnectInputs failed ` typically indicates that the input isn't on chain

[01-Nov-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
did you do tat on a fresh sync?

[01-Nov-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
anywya i'll have  alook at it myself here

[01-Nov-18 08:33 AM] Alright#0419
rebuilt latest FSM, deleted blocks and chainstate, resynced

[01-Nov-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool

[01-Nov-18 08:33 AM] Alright#0419
then funded a t address, waited for conf then tried z_sendmany

[01-Nov-18 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r I just explained why i think it isnt working

[01-Nov-18 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
you didnt mark the spent verifier as unspent, so it is still marked as spent

[01-Nov-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and when you try to add it to the mempool again, it says, "hey that is already spent, this isnt bitcoin core, you cant double spend"

[01-Nov-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
but dont go messing with the zksnark internals!

[01-Nov-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
just remove only the non-ztx from the mempool

[01-Nov-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe as you make the copy, you can just remove the single tx from the mempool

[01-Nov-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol.... but this is not happening on re-add ... it son the initaial add ... on the re add it skips the check all together and juts adds it, but anyway will inviestingte this now, first prioroty here

[01-Nov-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes thats what I was thinking,

[01-Nov-18 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure how you know exactly when it is being rejected...

[01-Nov-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there must be a check that enables the z-tx to be checked to the right function, so it the opposite of that then copy and remove

[01-Nov-18 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will test this myself before chaning anyhting so I know exactly what is doing what.

[01-Nov-18 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just going to make a test chain locally on this one... This makes zero sense

[01-Nov-18 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181

the chain is back to normal, right?

[01-Nov-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
actually it has survived a 2 hour dice bet if it was on FSM branch

[01-Nov-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
just dont do any ztx on FSM branch until that is fixed

[01-Nov-18 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
FSM z-tx are broken on all chains not just ac_cc=

[01-Nov-18 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
