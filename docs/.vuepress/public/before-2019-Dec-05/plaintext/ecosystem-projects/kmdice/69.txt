These chains have always done that

[02-Nov-18 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the mempool fix helps but there is stil a problem

[02-Nov-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i think in miner.cpp it assumes that the order in the mempool matches the order of dependency, but really it can be random so i think a lot are being skipped

[02-Nov-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
CreateNewBlock or something like that is the one that makes a new block template for mining

[02-Nov-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉  was able to make his pool mine large blocks, but gave up as there was too much hash on the other one.

[02-Nov-18 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
I will look into this one, it really shouldnt be skipping so many tx

[02-Nov-18 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems a lot of the tx are 0 fee tx?

[02-Nov-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
bug seems to be tx of the form: http://kmdice.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/bad63c85765bc34e4f788cb1156b104eb3a1751f2fa00d6bb7deade10f675224

[02-Nov-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
not having a txfee!

[02-Nov-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
this is a non-consensus fix in the dicefinish to add a txfee

[02-Nov-18 01:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Why would they not have txfee ?

[02-Nov-18 01:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Typo on @blackjok3r script?

[02-Nov-18 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing to do with script

[02-Nov-18 01:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok

[02-Nov-18 01:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Pool issues then?

[02-Nov-18 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[02-Nov-18 01:53 PM] Alright#0419
contract code

[02-Nov-18 01:54 PM] Alright#0419
there's a startup param to allow 0 fee txs into your blocks

[02-Nov-18 01:54 PM] Alright#0419
don't remember the exact one, minrelaytxfee=0 may work though

[02-Nov-18 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess thats what genie was doing

can you sset minrelaytxfee to 0 though?

[02-Nov-18 02:04 PM] Alright#0419
bunch of txs in mempool with 0 fee

[02-Nov-18 02:04 PM] Alright#0419
or is it like that by default?

[02-Nov-18 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
you don't want it 0
basically, you want a full block and in this order
paying over min
paying min
paying some
paying none

[02-Nov-18 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i think one of the dicefinish tx constructors is off by txfee

[02-Nov-18 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
once that is fixed and the dealer node updated, we should get most all the mempool confirming each block

[02-Nov-18 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, this is indeed confirmed: "fee rate skip" is the reason

[02-Nov-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
I can certainly fix it fast enough, but it would be good for someone like @Alright to find the bug and maybe even fix it

[02-Nov-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it will be easy enough to verify as the txfee wont be 0 after the fix

[02-Nov-18 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
I can try. I'm a bit preoccupied with STAKED testnet launch atm however. Is it a vital fix?

[02-Nov-18 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
I'll drop what I'm doing over there if so

[02-Nov-18 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
not vital

[02-Nov-18 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
just will allow a lot more dicebet per block

[02-Nov-18 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
bottleneck is dicefinish appears to be making 0txfee so the miner (correctly) only allows a few per block

[02-Nov-18 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
with the current dealer node code, 60 per block should be sustainable

[02-Nov-18 03:35 PM] Alright#0419
ok understood, will start looking at contract code in a couple hours

[02-Nov-18 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
once it gets the completion queues, then 1000+ per block

[02-Nov-18 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
just look at the dice.cpp DiceFinish where it is constructing the txfee, likely it just needs an extra txfee added

[02-Nov-18 03:35 PM] Alright#0419
just tack on 10k sat fee to each dicefinish tx?

[02-Nov-18 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
should literally be a few char fix as it probably tries to get txfee or 2*txfee and it needs to be 2*txfee or 3*txfee

[02-Nov-18 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
best to fix only what is broken, so need to find the path that leads to 0 txfee and boost that by a txfee

`bottleneck is dicefinish appears to be making 0txfee so the miner (correctly) only allows a few per block`
Or the pool could stop using default end-user settings and set it up to scrape properly
#justSayin

[02-Nov-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but we dont want to have the only pool setup in a configuration that would allow a bunch of 0 fee tx

[02-Nov-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
best to fix this bug, especially if it is just the dealer node that needs to be updated

[02-Nov-18 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I'm not seeing how allowing 0fee is a "bug" but ok

[02-Nov-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i see the bug, it is indeed a matter to change txfee to 2*txfee since the 'L' path adds a marker vout

[02-Nov-18 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
is it true that wins have nonzero txfee, but losses have 0 txfee?

[02-Nov-18 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, all dicefinish paths appears to be 0 txfee. how did we not notice this before?

[02-Nov-18 04:09 PM] Alright#0419
didn't matter until now I guess

[02-Nov-18 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix, you can see how easy it was

[02-Nov-18 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
@jorian @siu - Chainmakers please update and it should fix the tx not confirming issue

[02-Nov-18 04:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, on it

[02-Nov-18 04:17 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`oh, all dicefinish paths appears to be 0 txfee. how did we not notice this before?`
I can see the *creation* of a 0fee being a bug, but still not seeing where a pool being able to *process* 0fee is

[02-Nov-18 04:17 PM] Alright#0419
if blocks are ever full, we will need to up the fee on dicefinish txs

[02-Nov-18 04:17 PM] Alright#0419
dicefinish txs are high priority

[02-Nov-18 04:17 PM] Alright#0419
I'm looking at it now, jl thanks

[02-Nov-18 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
and KMDICE is destined to get to full blocks

[02-Nov-18 04:18 PM] Alright#0419
yep, exactly what I was thinking

[02-Nov-18 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
easy enough to increase the dicefinish txfee (as you see)

Maybe that wallet needs to be rescanned after all that abuse or -Zapwallettxs

[02-Nov-18 04:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
let me reindex the chain then

[02-Nov-18 04:34 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
you can do zap without reindex
99% of the time you only need reindex if you have a known bad block or diverge from the "real" chain

[02-Nov-18 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
blocks and txes use separate databases

[02-Nov-18 04:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes ... I was messign with the wallet today, before I broke my branch trying to get notary address form some place in you dont seem to be able to get them from, I managed to make the wallet DB reject txs sent to you if they average vout was under a size ... works perfectly btw

so because of 0 fee *and pools using default settings*, txns weren't mined

i guess that no matter what is done, we will have to wait for the 1.2k transactions to get confirmed one by one

[02-Nov-18 05:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or orphaned or whatever

[02-Nov-18 05:39 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`we will have to wait for the 1.2k transactions to get confirmed`
so, like 1 block?

[02-Nov-18 05:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no

[02-Nov-18 05:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
they are not confirming at the same time

[02-Nov-18 05:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
they go one by one

[02-Nov-18 05:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and sometimes blocks go empty

[02-Nov-18 05:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i mean, all blocks are going empty

[02-Nov-18 05:43 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
and, as I've said 100 bajillion times, that's *only* because the pool(s) are using default, end-user settings and not setting up nodes as actual mining nodes

When mining nodes are set to mine, every block can be full
the only exception is if you prestart based on a non-scrape like antpool does (bu no one here is getting that deep into a pool anyway)

[02-Nov-18 06:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
could you give it a try and try to mine a block with all these tx?
