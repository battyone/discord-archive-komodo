but thanks will make sure our miner is using it ... start with CPU if that works add stratum and see what happens

[28-Oct-18 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`streamer and that do , and I never set any of those`
because you're doing something entirely different - part of this goes to the convo/issue in the locked channel

[28-Oct-18 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the other part goes to 'depends', if a "depended upon" tx isn't in the block, then the "dependent" tx(es) will not be either

[28-Oct-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes thats how the streamer works, each tx depends on the tx before it, so they never arrive out of order

[28-Oct-18 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, but with steamer, you're actively looking for that "parent" tx (and not just "stumbling upon it"), no?

[28-Oct-18 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Any tx seen in any block will point the the first tx sent

[28-Oct-18 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and what block its in

[28-Oct-18 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not perfect... but i figured steaming would use blocknotify, so you start the chain

[28-Oct-18 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and wait until blocknotify gives you a return, then seek back to that block and pull it out

[28-Oct-18 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for a whole bunch of files... maybe there needs to ne an oracle on the chain you post the location of the files to.

[28-Oct-18 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
right, and that's not how bitcoin works 😛

[28-Oct-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe using baton utxo

[28-Oct-18 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I never designed it t have more than one file

[28-Oct-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but if you sent them one after the other with a diffrent ID

[28-Oct-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can do it

[28-Oct-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its got an easy pattern to seek to it, there is always a block with 3tx before the next stream

[28-Oct-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
iterating over all blocks for a big chain is too slow though

[28-Oct-18 01:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Its got an easy pattern to seek to it, there is always a block with 3tx before the next stream`
...
`ComputerGenie 😠Today at 8:41 AM
right, and that's not how bitcoin works :stuck_out_tongue:`

[28-Oct-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My first idea was to save each stream ID on conect block

[28-Oct-18 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just have no idea how to make it stick around after shutdown

[28-Oct-18 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and RPC like dicelist to return all

[28-Oct-18 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`iterating over all blocks for a big chain is too slow though`
hence why default node doesn't scrape the entire pool

👌 

[28-Oct-18 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I get what yor on about now

[28-Oct-18 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
like I said before, s/k/znomp being "easy enough for anyone to set up their own pool" can create more problems than it fixes by having a gajillion pool ops that don't know what they are doing

[28-Oct-18 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
agreed ... my pool was terrible

[28-Oct-18 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
especially when 90% of the hash is in a "bad" pool

[28-Oct-18 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... I am going to use my local VM that I used for streamer, easier, will satrt with simple chain 3 nodes

[28-Oct-18 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cpu mine

[28-Oct-18 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no options

[28-Oct-18 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
flood from 2 nodes mine on 1...dunno if it will work though because the might not be far enoough apart... 🤔

[28-Oct-18 01:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
kissing slush's ass and removing getwork from bitcoin was one of the 10 worst things to ever be done,  imo

[28-Oct-18 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ccould we add it back in ?

[28-Oct-18 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there were so many changes then and since, I'm not even sure how 😛

[28-Oct-18 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
might be hard or could be very easy, it depends if the data structures it pulls the data from are the same

[28-Oct-18 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if they are, likely wouldnt be hard

[28-Oct-18 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
duke could likely do it

[28-Oct-18 01:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, the other side of that is needing new miner apps (since most are now built on a version of cgminer that also no longer has it)

agama is crashing too.

[28-Oct-18 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Reindex ususally stops it crashign on sync

[28-Oct-18 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wlthough Agama must be on an older version

[28-Oct-18 02:12 PM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers use the latest version of Agama. the one you are using maybe couple of build old

[28-Oct-18 02:14 PM] Oszy#5734
anyone selling small amount of kmdice? like 20? need for testing, i lost the 0.1 the faucet gave 😄 i can pay kmd

block diff is just a tad lower than KMD block diff

[28-Oct-18 02:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
solved, thanks @SHossain

[28-Oct-18 02:18 PM] SHossain#0007
cool

[28-Oct-18 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mine those empty blocks miners 😄

[28-Oct-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think putting more hash on will fix it

can dice even work with z_only txes?

[28-Oct-18 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤔

[28-Oct-18 02:30 PM] SHossain#0007
ARRR and KMD is not compatible yet

[28-Oct-18 02:30 PM] SHossain#0007
KMD doesn't have CC activated, ARRR is z tx only

[28-Oct-18 02:46 PM] Llama#1330
lol someone is really renting 20Msol/s

[28-Oct-18 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
don't lol, it makes your silly prices almost valid

[28-Oct-18 02:56 PM] SHossain#0007
😄

[28-Oct-18 02:57 PM] SHossain#0007
i mined 2 blocks in the last 48 hours with 2x z9 mini (first 24 hours the chain was stuck 😛 )

[28-Oct-18 02:57 PM] Llama#1330
lol

[28-Oct-18 02:58 PM] Llama#1330
they are renting 20/22 msols

its still not working for dice with lots of players though at least the chain keeps moving

oh, yes...i have been using FSM branch since then

I pushed something broken to the jl777 one I am pretty sure

[28-Oct-18 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should be fixed there

[28-Oct-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810

[28-Oct-18 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[28-Oct-18 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
chain may need reindex or will crash, or it did for me

Before that change... you could not start dicebets close to each other on a single node.. now you can. 🚀

seems like the dice finish needs to some how be faster.. or cna do more at once

[28-Oct-18 04:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or its that pool 👀

likely the mining node didnt get the full linked list of mempool tx

[28-Oct-18 05:20 PM] Oszy#5734
hmm now i got stuck on 15756

[28-Oct-18 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
on latest FSM branch?

[28-Oct-18 05:28 PM] Oszy#5734
jokers FSM i complied this morning,

[28-Oct-18 05:30 PM] Oszy#5734
it was fine until i created a new wallet, placed some bets, then it got stuck, on explorer i still have the amount i started with.

[28-Oct-18 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
try the current FSM branch from my repo, has some of the latest tweaks

[28-Oct-18 05:31 PM] Oszy#5734
Okay. Thanks.

[28-Oct-18 05:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My node is doing well... but the old ones are poisining it... until all update it will be not working well

[28-Oct-18 05:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My mempool is flat out rejecting transactions

[28-Oct-18 05:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[28-Oct-18 05:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[28-Oct-18 05:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its mostly the pool man

[28-Oct-18 05:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if they were running hte right verison and forcing large blocks, it would probably be fine

[28-Oct-18 06:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's no "version" needed to build large blocks

[28-Oct-18 06:09 PM] ciumete#3212
don't work anymore diceing ?! {
