that should be the 1st payout

[02-Nov-18 10:17 PM] 0x03#8822
while i'm already at it, should i bootstrap kmdice as well? it probably doesnt make sense yet, but for the future?

[02-Nov-18 10:17 PM] 0x03#8822
ok, my local wallet says payout received. https://kmdice.komodopool.xyz officially in service, ladies and gentlemen. happy mining.

Still 1254 txs not mined 🙃

[02-Nov-18 10:18 PM] 0x03#8822
then this pool at least is not useless :trollface:

[02-Nov-18 10:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_wonders how it is that he's the only one that can fill blocks (even when others use the same settings) :trollface:_

well, getmempoolinfo doesnt want to rise above 0 yet

[02-Nov-18 10:34 PM] 0x03#8822
in none of its values sadly

[02-Nov-18 10:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@0x03 is your debug log showing much in the way of refused to add to mempool?

[02-Nov-18 10:38 PM] 0x03#8822
i had _some_ before, like `2018-11-02 20:43:34 ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: BUG! PLEASE REPORT THIS! ConnectInputs failed against MANDATORY but not STANDARD flags 362f752d7e5591e886bbabf54da2766858e20c1167e0c1005183ae6042bf9126

[02-Nov-18 10:38 PM] 0x03#8822
but that didnt happen again since the pool is online and finding blocks

[02-Nov-18 10:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Maybe if @jorian rebroascasts the tx again they get published

[02-Nov-18 10:56 PM] 0x03#8822
i think he said before he tried

[02-Nov-18 10:56 PM] 0x03#8822
and when i understand genie correct, he's gradually mining _some_ of them

[02-Nov-18 10:57 PM] 0x03#8822
... is there something mempool.dat-like to 'copy around'?

[02-Nov-18 11:01 PM] 0x03#8822
what does your `getmempoolinfo` say

[02-Nov-18 11:05 PM] 0x03#8822
why isn't mine ever getting more than one tho

[02-Nov-18 11:07 PM] 0x03#8822
no, but let me try that 👍

[02-Nov-18 11:20 PM] 0x03#8822

[02-Nov-18 11:21 PM] 0x03#8822

[02-Nov-18 11:31 PM] 0x03#8822
at least i've seen 2 txes now multiple times in the pool. i just need to find a block :trollface:

🤞 (2) 

[02-Nov-18 11:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Unconfirmed in dealer node is still at 1254

[02-Nov-18 11:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Seems like those specifically are the tx that no one wants. The one @blackjok3r  spammed :trollface:

[02-Nov-18 11:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
He spammed a lot more. But these seem to have issues

[03-Nov-18 12:11 AM] forkwitch#6080
@siu - Chainmakers "ill remove forkwitch pool from the ANN" why is this? The forkwitch pool was only pool up and when i got requested to update i did a update. Running the pool with last FSM branch since jl777c requested updates.

[03-Nov-18 12:12 AM] 0x03#8822
on fsm branch i'm not finding anything, haha

[03-Nov-18 12:12 AM] forkwitch#6080
Taking pool offline then you can remove from ANN.

[03-Nov-18 12:12 AM] forkwitch#6080
@0x03 what is your problem with fsm branch?

[03-Nov-18 12:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@forkwitch It isn't anything personal, the issue is your pool either isn't getting the full mempool or isn't processing it and since it has all the hash, any other pool has difficulty getting blocks

[03-Nov-18 12:17 AM] forkwitch#6080
Ask me to include the 0 fee transactions if it is a problem for you.

[03-Nov-18 12:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_walks away muttering something about "why would you need to be asked to process transactions....."_

[03-Nov-18 12:19 AM] forkwitch#6080
Why would you include risk for spam transactions in mining pool if its not standard?

[03-Nov-18 12:20 AM] 0x03#8822

[03-Nov-18 12:20 AM] 0x03#8822
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you're no longer alone in filling blocks :trollface:

[03-Nov-18 12:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Number Of Transactions     2`
🤦

[03-Nov-18 12:21 AM] forkwitch#6080
🙂

[03-Nov-18 12:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@forkwitch the *entire thing* is "not standard"

[03-Nov-18 12:21 AM] forkwitch#6080
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 make a pool and mine free transaction.

[03-Nov-18 12:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's in the works

[03-Nov-18 12:22 AM] forkwitch#6080
👍 we are three pools so.

[03-Nov-18 12:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my being stoopid on Tuesday set a bunch of stuff back (timeline wise) for me

[03-Nov-18 12:57 AM] forkwitch#6080
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 what is the mempool size now?

[03-Nov-18 12:57 AM] forkwitch#6080
On your node.

[03-Nov-18 12:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't have one running, but the dealer node is showing:
```Unconfirmed
Unconfirmed Txs Balance     -11357.46970000 KMDICE
No. Transactions     1254```

[03-Nov-18 12:59 AM] forkwitch#6080
I do not see the transactions the dealers sees.

[03-Nov-18 01:21 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is the problem. No pool is seeing them

[03-Nov-18 01:22 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But now there are more pools, so maybe reindexing or rebroadcasting txs might help, which i cant do until tomorrow

[03-Nov-18 01:25 AM] forkwitch#6080
minrelaytxfee is amount of smallest to be accepted tx fee for transaction that you rely.

[03-Nov-18 01:25 AM] forkwitch#6080
But you can not set this to 0. This is not allowed because the free transaction are handled separate.

[03-Nov-18 01:26 AM] forkwitch#6080
It must be > 0. Daemon has one startup flag to relay free transactions.

[03-Nov-18 01:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What happens is that the mempool is saved then cleared the added back, and  thinking its not enough of a delay maybe, and the mempools are forking

[03-Nov-18 01:26 AM] forkwitch#6080
limitfreerelay

[03-Nov-18 01:27 AM] forkwitch#6080
limitfreerelay can set amount of bytes your node will relay for volunteering in the network.

[03-Nov-18 01:27 AM] forkwitch#6080
With transaction fee null.

[03-Nov-18 01:27 AM] forkwitch#6080
Maybe transactions gone from mempool @blackjok3r . How long its been?

[03-Nov-18 01:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` This is not allowed because the free transaction are handled separate.` <insert goggle citation here> :trollface:

[03-Nov-18 01:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That's all well and good but if there isn't enough time for the tx that's causing the entire mempool on jorian s node to propagate to his mode while his mempool is temporary empty so when they are readded they are rejected

[03-Nov-18 01:28 AM] forkwitch#6080
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 want to add something helpful?

[03-Nov-18 01:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@forkwitch Not sure what I can add, you're paraphrasing gmax just fine

[03-Nov-18 01:28 AM] forkwitch#6080
Minrelayfee is spam preventation i believe.

[03-Nov-18 01:29 AM] forkwitch#6080
Or greedyness factor.

[03-Nov-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a chain. With this particular fix ready to test today along side a control so I cab better define the behaviour

[03-Nov-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Technically the fix should only help but maybe it does not

[03-Nov-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If there is 1 tx in that 1200 txs that all other nodes see as invalid

[03-Nov-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That mempool isn't going anyehwre

[03-Nov-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe they need to restart that dealer node again to clear it

[03-Nov-18 01:30 AM] forkwitch#6080
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 because i say that free transaction are handled separate? Beacuse gmaxwel developed it and explained it in the github thread? 
🤦

[03-Nov-18 01:31 AM] forkwitch#6080
I made a plagiate, i am sorry @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 . Tell gmax, maybe he comes and blames me.

[03-Nov-18 01:31 AM] forkwitch#6080
I heard he likes this.

[03-Nov-18 01:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that you used the exact same words

[03-Nov-18 01:33 AM] forkwitch#6080
🤦

[03-Nov-18 01:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just struck me as funny

[03-Nov-18 01:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no big issue

[03-Nov-18 01:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
can't help that you can't take a joke

[03-Nov-18 01:34 AM] forkwitch#6080
Was sarcastic @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 , can't help that you can't take a joke.

[03-Nov-18 01:36 AM] forkwitch#6080
Please can you make a bet @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 .

[03-Nov-18 01:36 AM] forkwitch#6080
Or @blackjok3r please.

[03-Nov-18 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can start betting again but maybe a little less than yesterday

[03-Nov-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That broke the dealer

[03-Nov-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will take me 20mins at least to get setup

[03-Nov-18 01:37 AM] forkwitch#6080
Only 1 bet i need. I changed pool for bet-transactions.

[03-Nov-18 01:37 AM] forkwitch#6080
Then i can see if it works in the mempool grab.

[03-Nov-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK cool few mi s

[03-Nov-18 01:37 AM] forkwitch#6080
This will be super nice from you.

[03-Nov-18 01:37 AM] forkwitch#6080
Thank you.

[03-Nov-18 01:40 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Please dont spam the dealer yet until i get it to be normal

[03-Nov-18 01:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Right now we need to move the 1.2k tx stuck

{Reactions}
🤦 

[03-Nov-18 01:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
heh I can't make a bet because my wallet is in an offline VM 😝

[03-Nov-18 01:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I have a feeling that either the dealer node is totally stuffed up and not rebroadcasting the txes or something in the new changes is stopping it

[03-Nov-18 01:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```$ komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getmempoolinfo | jq '.size'

[03-Nov-18 01:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[03-Nov-18 01:46 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hmm

[03-Nov-18 01:47 AM] forkwitch#6080
Memory pool is empty on three nodes of my.
