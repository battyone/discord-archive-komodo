I'm on the FSM branch and the exact thing happened

[27-Oct-18 09:27 PM] jl777c#5810
if you stop and restart it, it doesnt sync to mainchain?

[27-Oct-18 09:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, just like dev, if stopped and reindex, it will go back to main chain, but that doesn't stop the meanwhile fork if unattended

[27-Oct-18 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
very strange, shossain had different behavior

[27-Oct-18 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
without reindex

[27-Oct-18 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
it just stays stuck?

[27-Oct-18 09:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
checkin

[27-Oct-18 09:29 PM] cipi#4502
me too... stopping the stuck KMDICE from dev branch and restart with FSM branch solved my stuck issue

[27-Oct-18 09:29 PM] SHossain#0007
i just started the chain using daemon from FSM branch, it caught up the remaining blocks for me. no reindex or rescan

[27-Oct-18 09:30 PM] SHossain#0007
automagic

[27-Oct-18 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, w/out reindex, it refuses next valid block

[27-Oct-18 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`ERROR: AcceptBlockHeader: prev block invalid`

[27-Oct-18 09:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
w/out reindex, it gets stuck on the same
`ERROR: CScriptCheck(): ...:... VerifySignature failed: Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element`

PR ?

[27-Oct-18 09:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
now you can make script to refill entropy

[27-Oct-18 09:32 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[27-Oct-18 09:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did it on dev branch

[27-Oct-18 09:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is that ok, or need to be FSM didnt know there ws fix when i started

[27-Oct-18 09:33 PM] jl777c#5810
FSM is better

[27-Oct-18 09:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok will try merge to there

[27-Oct-18 09:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`couldnt create dice bet transaction. make sure your address has funds`
Well, that's both new and wrong 😕

[27-Oct-18 09:46 PM] SHossain#0007
I have prepared a guide for pure CLI betting using KMDICE chain

[27-Oct-18 09:46 PM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers you want that to be published in KMDICE repo wiki? or shall i use komodo wiki?

@jorian  that PR allows you to script entropy creation, as you can now see how many there are.

[27-Oct-18 09:54 PM] SHossain#0007
Let me know if anything needs changing

[27-Oct-18 09:56 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alright just checked. `kmdice` repo doesn't have `komodo` repo or wiki

[27-Oct-18 09:57 PM] Alright#0419

yeah, they just need to change the chain params

[27-Oct-18 10:01 PM] SHossain#0007
@Decker's GUI betting app will make it much easier to bet for end user

[27-Oct-18 10:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@SHossain im making docs.kmdice.bet

[27-Oct-18 10:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, im doing that

[27-Oct-18 10:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
entropy txs i dice info is working perfectly

[27-Oct-18 10:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
spammed 10 bets and it enptied one at a time

[27-Oct-18 10:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
until it got to 0

[27-Oct-18 10:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
any dice script or GUI can just check entropy and wallet for utxo before sending bet to avoid error

[27-Oct-18 10:14 PM] jl777c#5810
and maybe not dicebet when too few entropy would work around the forking

[27-Oct-18 10:15 PM] Alright#0419
Why exactly is it forking? Do we know?

[27-Oct-18 10:15 PM] jl777c#5810
some subtle consensus problem, likely a mempool dependency and mempool is not consensus safe

[27-Oct-18 10:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think maybe if dealer node cna crontab a script to keep entoopy above 100 it would help very much, maybe even more than that

[27-Oct-18 10:16 PM] Alright#0419
Anyone have a node on the fork that I can sync from?

[27-Oct-18 10:16 PM] Alright#0419
or bootstrap?

[27-Oct-18 10:16 PM] Alright#0419
anyone look into what differs between the forks?

[27-Oct-18 10:16 PM] Alright#0419
what one is rejecting while the other is accepting?

[27-Oct-18 10:16 PM] jl777c#5810
most nodes just get stuck

[27-Oct-18 10:16 PM] Alright#0419
Ah

[27-Oct-18 10:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but that is likely due to forkwitch pool mining most blocks

[27-Oct-18 10:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes my node is forked 😂

[27-Oct-18 10:17 PM] Alright#0419
what is the auto reconsider block thing?

[27-Oct-18 10:17 PM] Alright#0419
joker pm IP please and open the p2p port

[27-Oct-18 10:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it automatically reconsiders a bad block

[27-Oct-18 10:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
definatly did it after entroy tx ran out and dice bet kept spamming from script 1280 local utxos so isnt that

[27-Oct-18 10:17 PM] Alright#0419
why would it be any different the second time it considers it?

[27-Oct-18 10:18 PM] jl777c#5810
once it marks it invalid it doesnt look at it

[27-Oct-18 10:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so the mined block is rejected and never considered without FSM

[27-Oct-18 10:18 PM] jl777c#5810
workaround

[27-Oct-18 10:18 PM] Alright#0419
wouldn't it violate the same rule the second time no matter what?

[27-Oct-18 10:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so something about the mempool state makes it reject it the first time

[27-Oct-18 10:19 PM] jl777c#5810
then later it becomes valid as it is an onchain block

[27-Oct-18 10:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the behavior seen makes me deduce this

[27-Oct-18 10:19 PM] jl777c#5810
some tricky mempool dependent consensus issue

[27-Oct-18 10:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is it possible one node can spend entropy at the same time as another due to netowrk latency of mempool?

[27-Oct-18 10:20 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[27-Oct-18 10:20 PM] jl777c#5810
attempted double spend equivalent

[27-Oct-18 10:20 PM] Alright#0419
that shouldn't fork though

[27-Oct-18 10:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so different mempool states

[27-Oct-18 10:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems likely, as my node forked a soon as new getinfo showed 0 entropy txs

[27-Oct-18 10:21 PM] Alright#0419
I was asking about that earlier

[27-Oct-18 10:21 PM] Alright#0419
if 2 txs spend the same input, which one does the miner decide to put into a block?

[27-Oct-18 10:21 PM] Alright#0419
higher tx fee or first one?

[27-Oct-18 10:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the one it receives first

[27-Oct-18 10:21 PM] jl777c#5810
and a dependency of the mempool state affects consensus

[27-Oct-18 10:21 PM] jl777c#5810
its called a bug

[27-Oct-18 10:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`some tricky mempool dependent consensus issue`
That's kinda what I saw thinking, multiple pulls from the same in/out one gets confirmed and other(s) error?

[27-Oct-18 10:21 PM] jl777c#5810
it is doing something it shouldnt be doing

[27-Oct-18 10:22 PM] jl777c#5810
the node that mines the block determines which nodes see the orphaned tx

[27-Oct-18 10:22 PM] jl777c#5810
which is not known until the block is mined

[27-Oct-18 10:22 PM] jl777c#5810
dice CC operates on mempool

[27-Oct-18 10:22 PM] Alright#0419
do we think it's trying to put 2 txs in the same block that spend the same input?

[27-Oct-18 10:22 PM] jl777c#5810
needs to have more protections

[27-Oct-18 10:22 PM] jl777c#5810
i am thinking the nodes on the network have two different mempools

[27-Oct-18 10:23 PM] jl777c#5810
one with txA another with txB

[27-Oct-18 10:23 PM] Alright#0419
they almost always will while 2 people are betting at the same time

[27-Oct-18 10:23 PM] jl777c#5810
if txA gets mined, the nodes with txB in mempool get orphaned

[27-Oct-18 10:23 PM] jl777c#5810

and returns 
`couldnt create dice bet transaction. make sure your address has funds`
for dicestatus needs fixed

I described the very likely scenario

[27-Oct-18 10:25 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is changed so dicebet isnt done if there are less than 10 entropytx, it should reduce the occurance of this
