But it's in norms of dispersion so far

[26-Oct-18 09:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Keep gamble and maybe you'll get your KMDICE back

[26-Oct-18 09:11 PM] TonyL#3577
😃 Or lose more :trollface:

[26-Oct-18 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yep, that's how it goes 😛

[26-Oct-18 09:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Trick about dispersion that next rolls results not depends of result of previous ones

[26-Oct-18 09:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
likely sometime next week I'll do a run of four thousand or more bets to get a true image of how well this script performs

[26-Oct-18 09:13 PM] TonyL#3577
But on infinity distance anyway you will have your 22,7%

[26-Oct-18 09:13 PM] TonyL#3577
But infinity is hmm infinity

Because I'm a cheap bastid (hence the bets of only 20) and my rental runs out in ~7 minutes, here's my latest result:
` wins: 128 losses: 376 --> 160
wager: 20
odds: 3`

next time anybody gets on a "fork" please see if it is actually on a fork (different blockhash from mainchain) or just stuck

[27-Oct-18 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
if just stuck, FSM branch might have a fix

[27-Oct-18 12:47 PM] SHossain#0007
everyone Please check your KMDICE node if it is stuck sync. There are some nodes that are stuck at block 11319. If it is stuck, update your daemon from FSM branch and restart the daemon with chain params. that should allow nodes to sync up.  please report if you are still stuck.

[27-Oct-18 02:02 PM] HenryChinaski#2919
But didnt found how is the game played

[27-Oct-18 02:03 PM] HenryChinaski#2919
i mean, i read its in cmd, but how is supposed to the game played? you roll a dice and what else?

[27-Oct-18 02:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's a simple "hi/low" game
you bet if the house is higher or lower than you based on the odds you pick
House is higher = you loose
House is lower = you win

with bets of 10-40 KMDICE and with 3-7 odds, I've been up as much as 10k and down as much as 5k 😝

[27-Oct-18 02:07 PM] HenryChinaski#2919
Awesome!

[27-Oct-18 02:08 PM] HenryChinaski#2919
oh wait, that means you lost? 😂

[27-Oct-18 02:09 PM] Decker#3767
Small explanation of daemon printouts:
```modval 8668 vs 3333 - means that somebody bet with odds=2 and lose (player's number - 8668, house number - 3333)
modval 2293 vs 3333 - same, but win (player's number - 2293, house number - 3333)

odds=2 -> house number=3333
```

{Reactions}
👆🏼 🤔 

[27-Oct-18 02:11 PM] Decker#3767
More odds you choose -> lower house number -> harder to win.

[27-Oct-18 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
*odds=2 -> player number=3333

[27-Oct-18 02:13 PM] Decker#3767
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 may be viceversa ... but meaninng is same: if first number in `modval` is lower that a second number - it's a win.

[27-Oct-18 02:16 PM] HenryChinaski#2919
And i suppose you have to use an specific wallet 🤔

[27-Oct-18 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```JSON
  "minbet": "0.00100000",

  "maxodds": 1500,```

[27-Oct-18 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as wallet, the only "specific" is that it has to have funds
