[23-Oct-18 12:18 PM] Flexatron#8809
@Decker  sir, there is a typo in how-to-play-en.txt

[23-Oct-18 12:18 PM] Flexatron#8809
the left quote in step 4 hugging the pubkey is outside

[23-Oct-18 12:20 PM] Flexatron#8809
I get this when running with the pubkey btw:
Error: There is no RPC client functionality in komodod. Use the komodo-cli utility instead.

[23-Oct-18 12:21 PM] Oszy#5734
you dont even need the quotes. oh wait, you do when .cmd

[23-Oct-18 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`Error: There is no RPC client functionality in komodod. Use the komodo-cli utility instead.` usually means you left off a `-`

[23-Oct-18 12:21 PM] Decker#3767
You can just add `-pubkey=your_pubkey` directly in `kmdice.cmd` ...

[23-Oct-18 12:22 PM] Oszy#5734
but you can include -pubkey in the cmd as well.

[23-Oct-18 12:22 PM] Flexatron#8809
nvm it was on purpose

[23-Oct-18 12:22 PM] Flexatron#8809
now seems to work

[23-Oct-18 12:22 PM] Decker#3767
`kmdice-cli` is a temporary solution until we don't have a GUI. as i know - 2 peoples work on GUI right now.

[23-Oct-18 12:23 PM] Decker#3767
so, we should have 2 different GUIs ...

[23-Oct-18 12:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think we might have dozens of GUIs

[23-Oct-18 12:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
in the future :p

[23-Oct-18 12:40 PM] Flexatron#8809
i am playing with one gui

[23-Oct-18 12:40 PM] Flexatron#8809

[23-Oct-18 12:41 PM] Oszy#5734
i looped the batch asking to enter amount every turn, quite convenient this way.

We want to let everyone know that for donations for funds on doing bounties and bring exposure to KMDICE you can send KMDICE to: bagZ4Zu9mEcV3cwEtzUxdCfjvp8xAZbQBf
