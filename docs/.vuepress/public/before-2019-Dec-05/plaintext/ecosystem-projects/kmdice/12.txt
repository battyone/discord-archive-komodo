if there have been no changes to the software, ACs with .00X reward will not work

[19-Oct-18 06:45 PM] 0x03#8822
just sayin'

[19-Oct-18 06:46 PM] 0x03#8822
you can obviously set a superlow payout

[19-Oct-18 06:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tested on over 500,000 utxo wallet adn took 3 hours to compelte

[19-Oct-18 07:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[19-Oct-18 07:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[19-Oct-18 07:00 PM] Oszy#5734

[19-Oct-18 07:00 PM] Oszy#5734
in DTSM cfg you dont need to enter stratum+tcp://

[19-Oct-18 07:00 PM] Oszy#5734

never thought to use z_merge, instead I wrote a whole damn script for mine 😦

[19-Oct-18 07:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that script was for something else entrily ... but I just adapted it to this in 2 mins ..

[19-Oct-18 07:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was the front end for a custom z_mergetoaddress

[19-Oct-18 07:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just removed the last parameter and it works with default on....

[19-Oct-18 07:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
custom one, takes a minumum utxo size

[19-Oct-18 07:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
merge anythign under this

[19-Oct-18 07:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181

when its 100 then we are talking ... I remember a staked chain early on had like 300 conenctions or more maybe 500.

[19-Oct-18 07:33 PM] Alright#0419

[19-Oct-18 07:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[19-Oct-18 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
is the faucet funded?

[19-Oct-18 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
how do people get KMDICE to dicebet?

[19-Oct-18 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
are there instructions on how to bet?

[19-Oct-18 08:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[19-Oct-18 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
will there be a faucet

[19-Oct-18 08:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We were not able to do one

[19-Oct-18 08:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If one of the miners is charitable he can do it

[19-Oct-18 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe post the faucet address so whales can donate to it?

[19-Oct-18 08:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That can be done, yes.

[19-Oct-18 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
if this is going to be a real chain, lets make it so we can onboard dice bettors with minimal pain

[19-Oct-18 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
for now faucet instructions, and cli dicebet script

[19-Oct-18 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe a TUI can be made

[19-Oct-18 08:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[19-Oct-18 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
having a faucetget call in a dicebet TUI would be convenient

[19-Oct-18 08:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Aftrr killing it i did dicestatus and it was done

[19-Oct-18 08:26 PM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers post the faucet address. i'll put 100 there

[19-Oct-18 08:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im not at my computer now... @jorian could set the faucet in the same node we have the dice game

[19-Oct-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody can just do a faucetaddress to get the faucet address

[19-Oct-18 08:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@TonyL was going to work on it but he is too busy with oracles
