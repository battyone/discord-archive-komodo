going to remove the bool in AcceptToMemory pool all together and see what happens then .

[01-Nov-18 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it broke before the mempool changes?

[01-Nov-18 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that is the case ... and I noticed it after changing it ... and had to add the exeption for mempory pool fix to amke the chain sync

[01-Nov-18 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wondered why that hapened.... I will start going back through commits and testing z-tx

[01-Nov-18 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
binary search starting with a week ago, pretty sure it worked back then

[01-Nov-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[01-Nov-18 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
if not, go 2, 4, 8 weeks back

[01-Nov-18 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
once you find it is working, try N/2 commits ago, where N commits is the working version

I will definatly be working on fixing my git workflow after having to deal with this, my 70 commits with no name make this hard 😅

[01-Nov-18 12:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hehe

[01-Nov-18 12:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what functions could we implement in KMDICE oracles?

[01-Nov-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
post the total bankroll balance, then create binary options on its total

[01-Nov-18 12:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hhmm

[01-Nov-18 12:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
wait, what?

[01-Nov-18 12:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
post the total balance of the house address and create a derivative based on that number?

[01-Nov-18 12:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
🤔

[01-Nov-18 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
bet for or against the house!

[01-Nov-18 12:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, so i can just query the balance of the house into a oracle, doesnt seem to be hard, but then... how is the binary option done?

[01-Nov-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess we need a binary CC

[01-Nov-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
need more CC devs...

[01-Nov-18 12:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there is a saying that says: "if you build, they will come" :trollface:

[01-Nov-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah it will happen, we need some better way of doing this but, having all these commits into a single branch is ha bit hard to see where something went wrong, liek z-txs stop working lol

[01-Nov-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the way git works doesn't make it any easier ...

[01-Nov-18 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its specifically the boolean added to AcceptToMemory pool, although why that is the case is a mystery... Going to appempt fix by removing that all together

[01-Nov-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤦

[01-Nov-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181

wait so you just got the polarity wrong?

[01-Nov-18 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its till doesnt work even with that fixed.

[01-Nov-18 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There was 2 checks against athat bool, on ewas true and the other false

[01-Nov-18 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but making both true still isnt working

[01-Nov-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
confusing myself no end here....

[01-Nov-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This is the problem

[01-Nov-18 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
deafult is false ... not true ... it was skipping the check for joinsplit requirements on all AcceptToMemoryPool calls

[01-Nov-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the most recent version you found that works

[01-Nov-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
remember about going from working baseline

[01-Nov-18 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the one before I added the bool

[01-Nov-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so do we need that bool?

[01-Nov-18 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes but we need to it to skip only on CC chains on CheckBlock

[01-Nov-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i didnt understand why it was needed, looked harmless enough, but clearly it broke something

[01-Nov-18 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not on every call

[01-Nov-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so skipping a check breaks sending all ztx?

[01-Nov-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
seems something else is going on as that doesnt make sense

[01-Nov-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe that sleep thing is needed?

[01-Nov-18 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You can either customise the clear memory pool clear to leave ztx behind, or just not check them when adding them abck, I see no diffrence.. in any case testing now, if this doesnt work, I will change the mempool clear to leave ztx behind

[01-Nov-18 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes they are now sending on a normal chain...

[01-Nov-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will activate CC's on this test chain

[01-Nov-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and test them there make sure it can sync

[01-Nov-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so you unbroke the ztx!

[01-Nov-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well to be fair I broke it

[01-Nov-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
good to get a pull request for that

[01-Nov-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
true != false

[01-Nov-18 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
but i guess if it cant sync KMDICE then it is not good...

[01-Nov-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will just make sure it still works on CC chains then submit PR

[01-Nov-18 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[01-Nov-18 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am guessing that the CheckJoinSplits function, updates some pointers, so when it was missed it failed the check inputs check  further down the line

[01-Nov-18 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Also that longestchain miner check should be disabled under 128 blocks, it slows the miner down a lot .. .can I submit that too?

[01-Nov-18 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, but maybe in a different PR after ztx is working stable again

[01-Nov-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, ok ..

[01-Nov-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well after I fixed them for normal chains, the CC chain wont sync again... not sure why though...

[01-Nov-18 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i think best to not remove the ztx from mempool, then we dont need to go through taking it out and putting it back in

[01-Nov-18 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
which I already said likely wont work without revaliating the verifiers

[01-Nov-18 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
but that is all very tricky stuff

[01-Nov-18 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are tired, then maybe the sleep thing and do this when fresh

[01-Nov-18 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes the solution is to check if a tx has joinsplits before adding to tmp mempool, then remove each tx after adding to the tempmempool

[01-Nov-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What happens is, if the tx is in the mempool, when the block arrives, the daemo gets deadlocked

[01-Nov-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the skip works, but only on sync it seems

[01-Nov-18 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not tired, this is preobably he best time I have to get it fixed everyone is asleep so I can concentrate

[01-Nov-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[01-Nov-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I fixed it

[01-Nov-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[01-Nov-18 03:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
