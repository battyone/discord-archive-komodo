ask if you have any questions about the design

[30-Oct-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
this is a standard way to speed things up. whenever there is a need for a sleep, put it in a queue

[30-Oct-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
then process that queue in parallel. if that processing also needs a sleep, you make another queue, etc

[30-Oct-18 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ok sounds good,

remember to not have any sleeps :trollface:

[30-Oct-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Nar definatly doesnt help ... as soon as I slept I found the issue with dice forks in a couple of hours... sleep is needed

what is the process for creating a 50% premine into the dice contract?

[30-Oct-18 09:08 PM] SHossain#0007
`./komodod -ac_name=KMDICE -ac_supply=10500000 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=144.76.217.232 &`
the `-ac_supply=10500000` is the premined fund. you need to create fund the dice contract using that fund

[30-Oct-18 09:11 PM] Mylo#8306
thanks @SHossain but no need to put -ac_pubkey to have it go into the dice plan?

[30-Oct-18 09:11 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[31-Oct-18 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going to try an make a way for a % of BR to be mined to a CC contract, seems very useful for many things. 😄

[31-Oct-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Have a lot on today so cant get startedfor quite a few hours, at least I have plenty of time to think about it. That ususally helps with making too many wrong turns and having to rethink strategy.

pool broken?

[31-Oct-18 08:30 PM] forkwitch#6080
@Llama updated on latest fsm branch after i got request and changed payout treshold for small miners.

[31-Oct-18 09:35 PM] Llama#1330
`error: couldn't connect to server: EOF reached (code 1)

[31-Oct-18 09:35 PM] Llama#1330
wat this

[31-Oct-18 10:16 PM] bishop#9773
@Llama doesn't appear your daemon is running

[31-Oct-18 10:18 PM] Llama#1330
I'm just trying to send because agama never works

[31-Oct-18 10:19 PM] bishop#9773
check your daemon is running

[31-Oct-18 10:19 PM] Llama#1330
idek what that means

[31-Oct-18 10:19 PM] bishop#9773
the settings at the top pin

[31-Oct-18 10:20 PM] Llama#1330
how do i know if it's running

[31-Oct-18 10:21 PM] bishop#9773
your task manager in linux or windows should tell you

[31-Oct-18 10:21 PM] bishop#9773
look for a komodod

[31-Oct-18 10:21 PM] bishop#9773
w/ those params

[31-Oct-18 10:23 PM] Llama#1330
ive done the exact same thing ive done every other time

[31-Oct-18 10:33 PM] Llama#1330
does agama just not work with kmdice?

[31-Oct-18 11:03 PM] bishop#9773
I only run cli on the fsm branch

[31-Oct-18 11:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It might not any more

[31-Oct-18 11:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So now pool is updated I will try stress the dice again today

[31-Oct-18 11:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is every chance the fix is not backwards compatible with the old version in agama... Now the pool is updated i can spend some time testing, properly

seems chain is not mining. do we have a second pool yet?

[01-Nov-18 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am sending lots of txs atm

[01-Nov-18 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[01-Nov-18 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm

[01-Nov-18 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
probably about when I started to flood it

[01-Nov-18 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
and you didnt notice you stalled the chain?

[01-Nov-18 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have confirmed txs

[01-Nov-18 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so no

[01-Nov-18 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
still going through

[01-Nov-18 07:12 AM] Alright#0419
fork then?

[01-Nov-18 07:12 AM] Alright#0419
What's the current status of the fix? Haven't checked in on  KMDICE in a day or two

[01-Nov-18 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181

well yes, ok, so the explorer needs to be updated

[01-Nov-18 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
and the notaries too

[01-Nov-18 07:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and maybe notaries need that fix

[01-Nov-18 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
well all the nodes

[01-Nov-18 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
lets makes sure FSM branch syncs up to the 580 chains

[01-Nov-18 07:16 AM] Alright#0419

[01-Nov-18 07:17 AM] Alright#0419
@CHMEX update explorer node when you have a minute please

[01-Nov-18 07:17 AM] Alright#0419
latest FSM

[01-Nov-18 07:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im still not 100% sure that that mempool fix is safe for everything we are just about to start a new staked testnet, with it just in 1 chain and try to test it there isolated form other things

[01-Nov-18 07:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even with just meyself flooding dicebets (that I know of) a fair few treansacitons disapear.

[01-Nov-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
mempool tx is a gamble

[01-Nov-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
thats why all the confirmations but if you want realtime response, it seems the only method

[01-Nov-18 07:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was thinking that maybe the mining node doesnt need the mempool fix, but wasnt sure how to go about that, as a pool doesnt use -gen flag ther eis no easy way to dsiable it

[01-Nov-18 07:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
however it really should not matter, unless when the txs are added back they are being rejected when they should not

[01-Nov-18 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
but the mempool fix isnt actually doing anything other than making sure all mempool tx are valid, which is a good thing

[01-Nov-18 07:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, as long as thats what it is doing...

[01-Nov-18 07:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I eman it takes all mempool -> another mempool

[01-Nov-18 07:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then just ads them back without z_cash joinsplit checks

[01-Nov-18 07:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
becaus those stopped sync

[01-Nov-18 07:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried to make it not do it on sync, but that didnt work

[01-Nov-18 07:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just kept doing it anyway

[01-Nov-18 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so if it is a ztx, it removes it?

[01-Nov-18 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
how will ztx ever confirm?

[01-Nov-18 07:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no it just adds it to the mempool with out checkingf any conditions

[01-Nov-18 07:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wether its valid or not

[01-Nov-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
oh... so it relies on the fact that it was in the mempool

[01-Nov-18 07:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[01-Nov-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
which should be ok too

[01-Nov-18 07:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yesh I thaughh so... iwas going to test ztx on it to amke sure later on

[01-Nov-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
should be ok, but definitely need to make sure

[01-Nov-18 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lucky someone one made some onthis chain, eary on and I was able to spot the error that stopped it to sync

[01-Nov-18 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
probably the verifier was marked as already spent

[01-Nov-18 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so when you removed it, you didnt mark it as unspent. but all that gets very dangerous to mess around with. just adding it back seems best

[01-Nov-18 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it only does it on that operation, I added a conditional bool to `AcceptToMemoryPool` for just the CC checks.

[01-Nov-18 07:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in all normal mempool adds it checks them as normal
