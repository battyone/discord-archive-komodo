But its FUN

[19-Oct-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm guessing your just trying to mine 7777 kmd worth to sell to James before we have time to 51% attack the dice contracts so whatever I'll mute this channel and get back to work. Have fun

[19-Oct-18 01:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Those coins r still yours`
Yes, and so are my ACOIN and my WLC and just like STAKED1-STAKED5, no one wants them either 😛

[19-Oct-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Staked will be good when libscott come back or I some how get super intelligence to fix whatever it is he did wrong

[19-Oct-18 01:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, so either is it drainable or all coins will get locked? Decide

[19-Oct-18 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can drain it... But we haven't got time at the moment, maybe alright will have time tonight but he needed my help to script the attack

[19-Oct-18 01:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think those are the only 2 outcomes of the game

[19-Oct-18 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
7777 kmd makes it worth it but if genie mines all that and sella to the order before we do it there is no point

[19-Oct-18 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Have fun... I got work to do

[19-Oct-18 01:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hmm so you guys where the ones that raised the diff?

[19-Oct-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No

[19-Oct-18 01:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_hasn't even mined 1k and wonders why dafuq everyone assumes he's spending like $9M to mine this_

[19-Oct-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We do need majoritry hash rate to attack the chain, likely some ridiculous nh order I guess at this point

[19-Oct-18 01:21 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I guess that is the whole point

[19-Oct-18 01:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So seems pointless... Might see if we can just do it on another chain as it doesn't need to be on this one for any reason

[19-Oct-18 01:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Point is to do it right or what ia the point I'm still lost on that one... Have fun with your game

[19-Oct-18 01:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what ia the point I'm still lost on that one... Have fun with your game`
errr ummmm do you always answer your own questions?

[19-Oct-18 01:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Why would it be on another chain?

[19-Oct-18 01:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The point is to break this one

[19-Oct-18 01:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
breaking is easier than fixing

[19-Oct-18 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I already told you all how to fix it... The only thing not yet done was the actual attack vector commented in the code but at this hash rate its too expensive to carry out, so we would need to do it on another chain like coquo with less hash rate

[19-Oct-18 01:37 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah. That is the point of why its being done in one chain

[19-Oct-18 01:38 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But thw thing is... give the hashrate and conditions of bet... is it practical to do the attack?

[19-Oct-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The bet parametees make it very easy, but obviously some one know knows this and put a shit load of nh on it to make it impossible... Or someone ia nhing it to get the needed supply to carry it out

[19-Oct-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
7777 kmd is quite a bit

[19-Oct-18 01:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im also impressed by hashrate

[19-Oct-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Unsustainable

[19-Oct-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
One of the staked chains had a nuge hash rate sustained for it's entire week, however if of went went much longer than that it would have fallen off

[19-Oct-18 02:07 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If it can be broken it better be

[19-Oct-18 02:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can break it it you want... But I really thought the intention was to fix it?

[19-Oct-18 02:21 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Once its broken, we can make better things

[19-Oct-18 02:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Breaking just for the sake of breaking it seems stupid... But I wonder who is pointing that much hash at it... Maybe it is already someone trying to break it

[19-Oct-18 05:02 AM] jspook16#3059
I haven't been able to mine any..

[19-Oct-18 07:44 AM] Mylo#8306
morning ☕

[19-Oct-18 07:44 AM] Mylo#8306
had to end the night ubruptly last night so i'll continue where i left off.

[19-Oct-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
arrrr you trying to break it now ?

[19-Oct-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[19-Oct-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Serious ... look at my list thats pinned ... there is no point fixing the issues out of order

[19-Oct-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the GUI will be shocking and not even work half the time

[19-Oct-18 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
a gui that does one bet at a time should work fine

[19-Oct-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[19-Oct-18 08:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what if 10 people use it at once ?

[19-Oct-18 08:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I never actually did get to doing that, parallel bets to a single table from X daemons / addresses

[19-Oct-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if 10 utxo it should work

[19-Oct-18 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
manual usage via GUI is much less load than a script gone wild

[19-Oct-18 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
true filling blocks with dice bets made it very angry, the main thing was being able to check for entropy tx before letting you bet... you can kind og get around it, by trying to bet, then if it fails check if the local wallet has balance to make the bet and then you can determine it was entropy tx was the problem.

As promised, we would like to release some additional information about our upcoming game. The next addition to the DICE platform, as many of you know, will be Lottery!

We will officially be launching this game on 10/21 23:00 UTC.

[19-Oct-18 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then you can try another table

[19-Oct-18 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
check what I just said mylo, if your making GUI it will help a lot.

[19-Oct-18 09:02 AM] Mylo#8306
ok - i'm only making basic gui to make me do the js rpc api wrapper

[19-Oct-18 09:02 AM] Mylo#8306
for dice

[19-Oct-18 09:03 AM] Mylo#8306
ok so need entropy tx available before sending bet.   won't be hard to fix once if i don't get it right first go.   will it stuff up the chain though?

[19-Oct-18 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
im just saying if the bet wont submit ... it is usually entroy tx not avalibe ... this will espically the case with te plan on this chain that has only 7 of them, means 7 bets per block.

👍 

[19-Oct-18 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the local wallet has balance, then its definatly entropy ... there is an ambigium json returned like "bet transaction failed"

[19-Oct-18 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it the wallet has balance and that is returned... make them wait until a block happens to bet again, might be a hacky way around it ... or try anohter table... but they onyl made one table hre 😂

here's that 3 dice game they play on american movies, on the street corners https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cee-lo

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cee-lo
Cee-lo
Cee-lo is a gambling game played with three six-sided dice.  There is not one standard set of rules, but there are some constants that hold true to all sets of rules. The name comes from the Chinese Sì-Wŭ-Liù (四五六), meaning "four-five-six". In America it is also call...

[19-Oct-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
why cant more entropy utxo be created?

[19-Oct-18 09:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they put the whole supply in there ?

[19-Oct-18 09:45 AM] jorian#4555
we can always fund, right?

[19-Oct-18 09:45 AM] jorian#4555
and yes, 10.5 million went into one fund

[19-Oct-18 09:46 AM] jorian#4555
should have thought about that a bit more

[19-Oct-18 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
and they are not able to mine a single block?

[19-Oct-18 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
entropy tx can be for 0.0001

[19-Oct-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so a single block can be 250000 entropy tx, which would be quite overkill

[19-Oct-18 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r you tend to exaggerate issues a bit and declare them unsolvable. that might not be the best point of view when trying to find solutions

[19-Oct-18 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only other people problems :trollface:

[19-Oct-18 10:27 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ive been thinking of more entropy tx... but if no one is playing yet... why would i need to?

[19-Oct-18 10:28 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Neither is anyone trying to break it

[19-Oct-18 10:29 AM] jorian#4555
some 0.01 bets were done, but not more than that

[19-Oct-18 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well ... with that hash rate ... I would break it but I cant get any coins 😂  and I really haven't got time... I already worked out how to break dice ages ago.

[19-Oct-18 10:55 AM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers more entropy tx is recommneded for any scenerio. with less, users will not be able to bet for longer

[19-Oct-18 10:57 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But ill lose the little bit i was able to mine 😭 😭

Do you want a blockchain streamer or not .... I'm sure jame would have finished this already, but that doesnt help me learn lol... This ir really requiring a lot of patience

[19-Oct-18 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
copy paste working code into iguana... stops working 😂

[19-Oct-18 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess thats why he told me to do it that 1 specific way, and trying to take shortcuts and leave the data as a string just watsed hours of time.

[19-Oct-18 11:53 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No, dont stop on your work. that is great

[19-Oct-18 11:53 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But, if you wont take the time to break the kmdice contract, then stop wasting your time bashing it here.

[19-Oct-18 11:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its better to use that time on working ways to get users and making it easier to play

[19-Oct-18 12:30 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll play.

[19-Oct-18 12:38 PM] CrisF#3405
Are these params Alright posted yesterday good?

[19-Oct-18 12:39 PM] CrisF#3405
