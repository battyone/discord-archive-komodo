[19-Oct-18 02:05 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[19-Oct-18 02:05 PM] SHossain#0007

[19-Oct-18 02:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So people prefer to trade it before gambling? 🤔 🤔

[19-Oct-18 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it works great until you go bust

[19-Oct-18 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
trading it is gambling

Thanks @Deleted User ... saves me taking down the mining pools to mine some 😉

[19-Oct-18 03:27 PM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers @jorian is there any community bounty funds?
i want to put 100 KMDICE in the bounty funds for the first public pool

[19-Oct-18 03:30 PM] CrisF#3405
Apart from Blackjok3r is anyone playing now?

[19-Oct-18 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for some reason, my script broke, so I can't yet

[19-Oct-18 03:34 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm wondering if mine has also.

[19-Oct-18 03:35 PM] CrisF#3405
It not moved for 5 minutes or so.

[19-Oct-18 03:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am playing with smks .. .we did 10 @ 1500 😂

[19-Oct-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
heh, mine isn't even calling the daemon 😦

[19-Oct-18 03:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181

`no txfee inputs for win/lose` 🤔

[19-Oct-18 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm using 10 first go was a bad idea 😂

[19-Oct-18 03:43 PM] CrisF#3405
How long did one bet take?

[19-Oct-18 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```    if ( AddNormalinputs(mtx,mypk,txfee,1) == 0 )
    {
        CCerror = "no txfee inputs for win/lose";
        fprintf(stderr,"%s\n", CCerror.c_str() );
        return("");
    }```

[19-Oct-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure what happened there lol ... the raw tx looks ok .. Bug ?

[19-Oct-18 03:47 PM] SHossain#0007
@blackjok3r is the command not working?

[19-Oct-18 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unles the script is bugged ... its not allowing dicefinish to happen on my dicebet TX

[19-Oct-18 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
bet TX ws valid and accepted ... unless my KMd daemon is wrong version 🤔

[19-Oct-18 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this chain is on dev branch ?

[19-Oct-18 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
discord wont let me post entire decoded tx .. so posted the comamnd to get it

[19-Oct-18 03:49 PM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers is your dealer node online?

[19-Oct-18 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems the dice finish needs a TX fee paid, that is not existing

[19-Oct-18 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
might need dealer to pay it ?

[19-Oct-18 03:50 PM] SHossain#0007
@blackjok3r i see this using the same command you posted https://gist.githubusercontent.com/himu007/30e3d1f966dd6ff4056090bb1acf1024/raw/9ffff53289de0aa3906c159ba61779c7aae788a2/kmdice-getrawtx

[19-Oct-18 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
looks the same as my output ... I dont see any hardofrking changes to DICE in the last week ... so its clearly not version change

[19-Oct-18 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its failing on dicefinish

[19-Oct-18 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  @Mihailo

[19-Oct-18 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Has anyone else been betting ?

[19-Oct-18 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or can they try please

[19-Oct-18 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smk762/kmd_pulp/master/Staked/dice/dice.sh
chmod +x dice.sh```

[19-Oct-18 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
change line 17 to KMDICE

[19-Oct-18 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
works just fine

[19-Oct-18 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont bet 10 😂

[19-Oct-18 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
0.001 will be fine ... btw script only dealing in intergers .. so min but is show as 0

[19-Oct-18 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔  might be the script mixing up address

[19-Oct-18 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```Step 1: Setting up DICE address for KMDICE

[19-Oct-18 03:56 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm using your dice script.  sent transaction but no confirmation

[19-Oct-18 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mine is likely simpler .. this is cool, but I am not 100% sure how it works ... will investigate let me know your outcome 😄

[19-Oct-18 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my visitors were keen to gamble 😂  kind of ruined the fun that lol

[19-Oct-18 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
daemon was started with the wrong pubkey ... interesting it still allowed me to bet like that

[19-Oct-18 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
trying with correct pubkey now

[19-Oct-18 04:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cant find dice inputs 🤔  
`cant find enough normal inputs for 1.00000000, plan funding 10073333.00000000`

[19-Oct-18 04:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wtf LOL

[19-Oct-18 04:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
something is wrong ... I broke it without trying to 😂

[19-Oct-18 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@siu - Chainmakers  @jorian  how dod you send the funding TX to it ? is it multiple utxo or just 1 giant one ?

[19-Oct-18 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that because of the first bet I made that failed, the entire funding might be stuck

[19-Oct-18 04:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
line 66 has STAKEDB1 in it ... might be also problem 😂

[19-Oct-18 04:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[19-Oct-18 04:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
-pubkey sent my change to another addres

[19-Oct-18 04:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry

[19-Oct-18 04:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[19-Oct-18 04:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hmm... its getting drained :/

[19-Oct-18 04:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[19-Oct-18 04:19 PM] CrisF#3405
My script hung after sending transaction.

[19-Oct-18 04:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181

```komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicestatus KMDICE 5be49570c56d036abb08b6d084da93a8a86f58fc48db4a1086be95540d752d6f 29e6e0c16b14c30446b3017d818fabbae08a01671186eb327c6ff1474e66230d

@siu - Chainmakers

[19-Oct-18 04:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
should be, yes

[19-Oct-18 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
might not be runnign can you check it

[19-Oct-18 04:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
jorian is the one in charge

[19-Oct-18 04:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i cant :/

[19-Oct-18 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dice finish isnt happening as far as I can tell

[19-Oct-18 04:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im getting this from my node: ```~/komodo/src/komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicefinish KMDICE 5be49570c56d036abb08b6d084da93a8a86f58fc48db4a1086be95540d752d6f f9d23769ccb481a398121d9f48ce02bafdd65e85c4be3c8464f7ab3eace03ae7

[19-Oct-18 04:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the actaul error is in STDOUT

[19-Oct-18 04:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the json is ambigiuos

[19-Oct-18 04:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
always returns the same

[19-Oct-18 04:22 PM] CrisF#3405
I believe the number of blocks is is set by plan creator. Does anyone know what that was set to? @siu - Chainmakers

[19-Oct-18 04:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
600 blocks

[19-Oct-18 04:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so ... the dicefinish isnt valid until 600 blocks ?

[19-Oct-18 04:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
are you sure ...

[19-Oct-18 04:23 PM] CrisF#3405
Wow!

[19-Oct-18 04:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dice runs out of mempool and shout return result within seconds unles the plan has been flooded with bets

[19-Oct-18 04:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we set the timeout at 600 blocks

[19-Oct-18 04:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
timeout .... doesnt mean it has to take that long

[19-Oct-18 04:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no, it doesnt.

[19-Oct-18 04:24 PM] CrisF#3405
I only had mine at 10.

[19-Oct-18 04:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think thats the maximum it can take

[19-Oct-18 04:24 PM] CrisF#3405
no, so maybe the node is offline?
