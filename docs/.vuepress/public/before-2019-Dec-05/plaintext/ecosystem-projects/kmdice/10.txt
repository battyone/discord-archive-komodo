lil kids can wear anyone down

[19-Oct-18 05:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and I had to quit smoking weed to learn KMD + blockchain ..

[19-Oct-18 05:14 PM] c2k#4915
oh the horror.  😱

[19-Oct-18 05:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
weed is good ... but its not ..

[19-Oct-18 05:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
makes lazy and brain slow

[19-Oct-18 05:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Depends on the strain 😂

[19-Oct-18 05:15 PM] c2k#4915
or pen

[19-Oct-18 05:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That too

[19-Oct-18 05:16 PM] jorian#4555
no, theyr'e all gone now

[19-Oct-18 05:16 PM] jorian#4555
there were only 7

[19-Oct-18 05:16 PM] jorian#4555
and theyre locked

[19-Oct-18 05:16 PM] jorian#4555
aka: chain is feked

[19-Oct-18 05:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

you need to create "funds"/1000 to fund it

[19-Oct-18 05:17 PM] Alright#0419
figure out what happened first though

[19-Oct-18 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes someone needs to do what I did and see if indeed it was a bug

[19-Oct-18 05:18 PM] jorian#4555
i'm building now

[19-Oct-18 05:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
👍

[19-Oct-18 05:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on VULTR 4 core it takes very little time, they are very fast

[19-Oct-18 05:18 PM] Alright#0419
if you snapshot, make announcement of block height before hand please

Who's silly idea was that?

[19-Oct-18 05:19 PM] jorian#4555
*whose

[19-Oct-18 05:19 PM] jorian#4555
no idea, but who in their right mind would fund something for free, while you can win the odds?

[19-Oct-18 05:20 PM] Alright#0419
STAKED notary network is well suited for chains that are constantly snapshot/airdrop

[19-Oct-18 05:20 PM] Alright#0419
just saying 😅

[19-Oct-18 05:20 PM] jorian#4555
ok ok, we love you guys, you did an amazing job with STAKED

[19-Oct-18 05:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but who in their right mind would fund something for free, while you can win the odds?`
Who in their right mind ever thought I was in my right mind?

[19-Oct-18 05:21 PM] jorian#4555
now there's a good question

[19-Oct-18 05:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[19-Oct-18 05:22 PM] Alright#0419
sorry if I sound like a shill, but you could use STAKED network until it's stable if you like. We can push new assetchains.json and have notaries start notarizing automatically

[19-Oct-18 05:22 PM] Alright#0419
that way you wouldn't have like a full day waiting for dpow between each

[19-Oct-18 05:22 PM] jorian#4555
yes, i see the progress, it was a little joke, but for real: it looks good

[19-Oct-18 05:24 PM] jorian#4555
@blackjok3r can i use the address as used in the README.MD?

[19-Oct-18 05:24 PM] jorian#4555
i don't own that

[19-Oct-18 05:24 PM] jorian#4555
wait that doesn't work

[19-Oct-18 05:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to fill out `config.ini` with a valid address you own.

[19-Oct-18 05:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then do `/TROLL/getfunds`

[19-Oct-18 05:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
send those coins to a new address

[19-Oct-18 05:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then delate wallet.dat

[19-Oct-18 05:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then change the pubkey in config.ini

[19-Oct-18 05:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and restert

[19-Oct-18 05:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it onyl checks if the config.ini is filled out

[19-Oct-18 05:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt check the address/wif./pub match

[19-Oct-18 05:26 PM] jorian#4555
i see, it only checks the length

[19-Oct-18 05:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just to stop noobs complaing of inifnate loops

[19-Oct-18 05:27 PM] jorian#4555
lol

[19-Oct-18 05:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
50% of the code is just to noob proof it

[19-Oct-18 05:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
many advantages of letting noobs test

[19-Oct-18 05:29 PM] jorian#4555
```[blackjok3r] : tesing $
[blackjok3r] : I fixed it :D
[blackjok3r] : test
[blackjok3r] : chatting
```

[19-Oct-18 05:29 PM] jorian#4555
lol

[19-Oct-18 05:30 PM] jorian#4555
check chatbox for progress?

[19-Oct-18 05:31 PM] jorian#4555
anyways. i send the funds i just got from faucet to a random address?

[19-Oct-18 05:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes make sure have private key

[19-Oct-18 05:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wait ..

[19-Oct-18 05:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to start the daemon with a pubkey that does not ahve its wif imported to the daemon

[19-Oct-18 05:32 PM] jorian#4555
i need to have funds to do a bet

[19-Oct-18 05:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats all

[19-Oct-18 05:32 PM] jorian#4555
yes i guess so

[19-Oct-18 05:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to make a table ..

[19-Oct-18 05:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe do that first 😂

[19-Oct-18 05:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then restart with wrong pubkey

[19-Oct-18 05:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
random one

[19-Oct-18 05:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and bet

[19-Oct-18 05:34 PM] jorian#4555
with table you mean dicefund?

[19-Oct-18 05:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
oh crap ... min dice fund is 100 ...faucet only gives 10 at a time sorry ... maybe should ahve used a diff chain... but that one is disposable

[19-Oct-18 05:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can faucet get as many times as you like though

[19-Oct-18 05:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i disabled the new address thing

[19-Oct-18 05:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Any updates?

[19-Oct-18 05:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I might have sent him on a bit of a job there ... and i still havent gone back to streamer ... did exactly what Alright told me not to do tonight 😂

[19-Oct-18 05:54 PM] jorian#4555
yeah it takes a bit of figuring out that staked repo

[19-Oct-18 06:00 PM] jorian#4555
also blocks are getting in slower now

[19-Oct-18 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 the way the dice is provably random is that neither side knows both entropy values when they are betting

[19-Oct-18 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
the dealer generates the entropy tx (no idea why the chainmakers dont make more entropy tx with 0.0001 values)

[19-Oct-18 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is only visible as the hash(entropy) the hentropy

[19-Oct-18 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
the bettor then picks a random dealer hentropy utxo adds his entropy in the clear

[19-Oct-18 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
now the dealer can tell if it is a win or loss, if he is honest he pays out the wins immediately

[19-Oct-18 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
if he doesnt and it times out, it must be a loss of dealer, ie automatic win, otherwise the dealer can just never payout wins

[19-Oct-18 06:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If my node was betting with a pubkey that did not have the WIF in the wallet (daemon started with wrong one ) would that cause an issue with dicefinish?

[19-Oct-18 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so, given this, what is the attack vector by allowing users to create entropy tx?

[19-Oct-18 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
your node wont be able to dicefinish properly, but the dealer node doesnt need any privkeys from the bettors

[19-Oct-18 06:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok so my node not being able to claim win/loss even after restarting with correct pubkey is not he issue ?

[19-Oct-18 06:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
all bets are stuck in pending

[19-Oct-18 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
your node would only ever be able to claim a timeout forfeit win

[19-Oct-18 06:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh ok got it

[19-Oct-18 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
since there are 7 entropy tx, once they are waiting for timeout, what else can happen

[19-Oct-18 06:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm seems like an error check needed ... its ther for other contracts

[19-Oct-18 06:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
"pubkey does not have wif imprted"

[19-Oct-18 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
why cant more entropy tx be created?

[19-Oct-18 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it does seem like a good error check, maybe tonyl can make a pull request

[19-Oct-18 06:07 PM] CrisF#3405
@jorian Did diceaddfunds not work?

[19-Oct-18 06:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But what might be getting the bets stuck?

[19-Oct-18 06:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no entropy

[19-Oct-18 06:08 PM] jorian#4555
i think the bets released just now

[19-Oct-18 06:08 PM] jorian#4555
can y'all check?

[19-Oct-18 06:09 PM] jorian#4555
seems the house won

[19-Oct-18 06:09 PM] jorian#4555
all i did was add a little entropy tx'es

[19-Oct-18 06:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
