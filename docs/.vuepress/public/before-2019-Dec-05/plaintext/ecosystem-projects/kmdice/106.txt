there is a 256 bit random number between house and player

[04-Mar-19 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can generate the gameplay from the 256bits,then you can do it

[04-Mar-19 08:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Can I get this number from RPC?

[04-Mar-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought I made an RPC that displays the RNG

[04-Mar-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe I didnt

[04-Mar-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
but its there in the code

[04-Mar-19 11:25 AM] Meyse#0952
if we can get it to generate a number between a certain range that would be amazing, we can add many more games to our dapp

[04-Mar-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it is generating a 256 bit hash, which you can extract many numbers from

[04-Mar-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
especially if you make a hashchain out of it

[04-Mar-19 11:34 AM] Meyse#0952
a rpc call would be heaven that prints this number out

[04-Mar-19 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, ok, after the dicebet is responded to, but the current code will process it as a normal dicebet

[04-Mar-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the issue is that each games rules needs to be put into the consensus to enforce payouts for a specific game

[04-Mar-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so for each supported game, i would need to know the exact gamerules and then can make an rpc call that is the equivalent for dicebet for that game

[04-Mar-19 12:50 PM] ch6ris#5240
`I can  connect some simple GUI like this: https://github.com/momo-ozawa/blackjack-gui.` Tried our that GUI and it is terrible. Just FYI.

[04-Mar-19 01:01 PM] Meyse#0952
Soon you can play Roll the Dice and Guess a Card from within your wallet. Easy games, but we will add more complex games to the mix of course. Developments are going pretty steady

[04-Mar-19 01:04 PM] Meyse#0952
Its gonna be a branded experience with an easy to use wallet

[04-Mar-19 01:56 PM] Mylo#8306
Thanks for tips on reusing the code @jl777c that’s interesting (re 256bit number, hashchain mechanism)

[04-Mar-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess a small bet can be made and then use the revealed secret for the gameplay. I will try to add the revealed entropy to JSON

[04-Mar-19 02:01 PM] Mylo#8306
So to shuffle a deck of cards, allocate a hash to each card in array of cards[52] then sort alphanumerical from the hashchain, using 256bit number as the seed?

[04-Mar-19 02:03 PM] Mylo#8306
Ace spade = cards[0] which is hash(256bitRNG)
2 spade = cards[1] = hash(cards[0])
....
sort.

[04-Mar-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
it depends on the type of numbers needed what the best way is

[04-Mar-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
and how they are used

[04-Mar-19 02:05 PM] Mylo#8306
Ok.  Many possibilities without a concrete plan.  Good conceptual thinking juice nonetheless, cheers

it's possible that someone is profit switching and the halving caused their pool to switch

But never got to running ut

[17-Mar-19 05:04 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r no, the block template was correct. @Mylo use joker's knomp fork with disable-cb feature. It will work with any equihash assetchain out of the box

[17-Mar-19 05:05 AM] Alright#0419
if any pool was using joker's stratum, the chain would not have stalled

@ciumete seems like you understand kmdice. I mined a handful of kmdice just so I could try this out hands on. 

Is there an easy way to get started with the cli? It looks like you're making bets with some kind of automated script as if this was a form of mining?  Is it fun slash profitable slash something else?

[09-Apr-19 08:45 AM] ciumete#3212

Its provably fair and it has been proven by the many testers that have done thousands of bets

Are there still plans for a GUI built on KMDICE? It seems a lot of the discussion around this project as tailed off asymptomatically to zero

[11-Apr-19 12:40 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The gui is being worked out by dicebets

Hahaha. Touche @siu - Chainmakers 
I mean the dischord seems quiet, not many folks in the mining pool, not much volume trading KMDICE on DP, etc.  I am curious if the community that supports this is taking a deep breath of sorts, or has moved on somehow

[11-Apr-19 08:03 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
There have been some intents of getting a gui done. None seem finished. Sadly at this time it seems like there is no public outcomes.

[11-Apr-19 08:03 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The chain is completely functional though

[11-Apr-19 12:38 PM] Mylo#8306
kmdice.komodo-cakeshop.com/#/console and a few other buttons work, but it's just a demo.  could be made into a standalone thing for your local daemon if anyone knows some vue, i can give some direction.

[11-Apr-19 07:19 PM] dogracer#3298
Yeah I spent Monda evening getting it working with a bunch of handwritten batch scripts. Though i didn't quite understand all of the transaction activity... In addition to seeing bets won and lost I saw lots of other tiny transactions which I think equate to the "cost" of placing a bet...?

also entropy txs

[11-Apr-19 10:56 PM] dogracer#3298
Is there a metaphor that could help me understand the "entropy utxo" concept?  Entropy is just a random number seed right? I'm confused about why that is transacted as a KMDICE spend

[11-Apr-19 10:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_doesn't use metaphors well_
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy>

[12-Apr-19 03:26 AM] Alright#0419
@dogracer dealer posts a hash of entropy in an "entropy tx", bettor selects an "entropy tx" to bet against, bets against it, dealer must then reveal this entropy within the "timeout window" or the bet defaults to win

Will try that out in my Ubuntu embedded into Win10 later @0x03 thanks.

Ok so my next question is: who is the dealer? 

As soon as I start the chain Does that mean I take turns being the dealer too? In other words will I somehow slowly accrue KMDICE just by having the chain running using the pubkey from my wallet? Or is "the contract" basically the dealer?

[13-Apr-19 07:28 AM] Mylo#8306
Dealer can be anyone.   Look at dice_table.sh in this repo https://github.com/smk762/kmd_pulp/tree/master/kmd_labs/dice
