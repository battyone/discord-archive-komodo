had to resync the dealer node from scratch

[09-Nov-18 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
300 bets were backlogged, was cleared basically as soon as it was in sync

[09-Nov-18 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe it accepted a bet to the mempool that invalided the other 300?

[09-Nov-18 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems that should not happen though.

[09-Nov-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
i had force killed the dealer node over a dozen times. was surprised it kept the DB valid for so long

[09-Nov-18 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahhh makes sense

[09-Nov-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the 300 bets were backlogged as the dealer node wasnt processing any bets while it was syncing

[09-Nov-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
essentially 300 bets were made during the resync

[09-Nov-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
and the stuck tx were unstuck as they were stuck due to bad data from the spentindex DB

not many tx on this chain atm http://kmdice.explorer.dexstats.info/blocks is everyone waiting for a bug fix or is the explorer on a fork?

[09-Nov-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
found the cause... a fix will likely cause a chain fork... so we would need to have the pools update along with explorer

[09-Nov-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix, but each dicebet will be rejected by all the other nodes

[09-Nov-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
@forkwitch @CHMEX @0x03 please update to latest FSM branch

[09-Nov-18 01:39 PM] CHMEX#0686

[09-Nov-18 01:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
updating

[09-Nov-18 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, but let us not make any bets until both pools and notaries update

[09-Nov-18 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
@siu - Chainmakers no bets till both pools are updated and also the notaries

[09-Nov-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
let us plan on resuming stress test after enough notaries have updated

@forkwitch  please update pool

[09-Nov-18 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
we need at least 20 notary nodes to update first

[09-Nov-18 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
before stress test, or the network will likely fork

[09-Nov-18 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
of course all the mining pools need to be updated

side cheat for the other pool operators: use https://github.com/miketout/node-stratum-pool and set `burnFees` in the coin config - that one does equihash too

[09-Nov-18 07:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
everyone Please update your KMDICE nodes to the latest FSM branch of komodo! A hard fork change has been done to the chain and everyone needs to update and be sure you keep on the right fork. If you hold your funds in Agama wallet, please dont use them until we have cleared all the tests and release a new version of Agama with fixed chain. Also if you were mining using a pool, be sure your pool is on the right fork, if not, encourage the owner to fix it or point your devices to a pool that is in the correct fork.

[09-Nov-18 07:23 PM] 0x03#8822

I'm excited to try this when the new version is done!

[09-Nov-18 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so an update to the latest FSM branch and you should sync up to the correct chain: https://kmdice.komodopool.xyz/stats

[09-Nov-18 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so dealer node is caught up, notaries are notarizing the right chain, xyz pool is mining on the right chain

[09-Nov-18 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
seems that if you are on FSM branch you can stress test and try to crash the dealer node

[09-Nov-18 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
as far as I know, the only changes needed for dice CC are all dealer node specific at this point, so hopefully this is the last emergency KMDICE update

[09-Nov-18 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
before we make special cross os agama versions, I would like to make sure it survives stress test and best to have all the dealer node changes too, so let us plan for next week to get FSM branch stabilized for a KMDICE release candidate

[09-Nov-18 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810

@Llama if you do want to mine, you can do so on my pool (kmdice.komodopool.xyz), it's up and running on the correct chain. you'll probably not get a working GUI for kmdice yet to manage your rewards tho

but if you're cli-savvy nothing should go wrong as long as you follow jl's instructions above, that would be 'use FSM branch'
