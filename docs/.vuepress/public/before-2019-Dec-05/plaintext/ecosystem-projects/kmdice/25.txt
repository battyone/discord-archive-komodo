It is by logic the bug. Yes. Wrong byte encoding formats in the block hex. Typo or wrong calculation from zclassic nomp developer Yoshua. https://github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool/blob/master/lib/blockTemplate.js dont have this.

if there are 10x less KMDDICE than pirate then that means each one is worth 1KMD?

[22-Oct-18 06:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Now, having more tx as most chains, with the vulnerability having a solution and we finding bugs in deep code of nomp and other pool software, we can say KMDICE in a week has done more than many chains do in years :p

Fix for all nomp-based software:
```if (this.txCount <= 0x7f){
    var varInt = new Buffer(txCount, 'hex');
}
else if (this.txCount <= 0x7fff){
    if (txCount.length == 2) txCount = "00" + txCount;
    var varInt = new Buffer.concat([Buffer('FD', 'hex'), util.reverseBuffer(new Buffer(txCount, 'hex'))]);
}
```
I save the logic of 0x7f and 0x7fff ... don't know why devs use "signed" checking here (may be compare with 0x80 in nodeJS cause problems), so, examples:

```this.txCount = 15, varInt = 0f
this.txCount = 127, varInt = 7f
this.txCount = 128, varInt = fd8000
this.txCount = 256, varInt = fd0001
this.txCount = 777, varInt = fd0903```

[22-Oct-18 07:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
any reason why dicestatus keeps asking if the tx is confirmed even when it is evidently confirmed?

@Decker I changed to that and I'm now only scrapping 1 or 2 txes at a time 😕

[22-Oct-18 07:25 PM] wookie#7663
so with all this discovery of bugs going on, what's happening with the mining? Haven't had rewards for several hours now. Should I stop mining kmdice until the bugs are fixed?

two players cannot dice against each other, short of creating their own plan

but it is still trustless even if the dealer node is involved
