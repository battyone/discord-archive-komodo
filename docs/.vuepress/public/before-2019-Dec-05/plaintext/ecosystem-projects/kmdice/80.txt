[07-Nov-18 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
is it stuck syncing?

[07-Nov-18 04:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no

[07-Nov-18 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
then it is transient error, likely in between blocks

[07-Nov-18 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810

i still need to add validation to the refund, but it is ready to be stress tested

dont start the stress test

please dont spam yet, still getting dealer node caught up

[07-Nov-18 07:10 PM] SHossain#0007
not spamming. just mining some blocks with ~40k sol

[07-Nov-18 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
processing is now much slower. I need to get a fresh start after some rest. plz dont spam dicebet

[07-Nov-18 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
duplicated the dealer node slowing down, exponentially... this must be fixed, but I will need a bit of a major surgery to do this.

[08-Nov-18 11:49 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jl777c compiling failed, debugging?

[08-Nov-18 11:49 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i see.. you are working on it.

[08-Nov-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
major, major changes to dealer node. not stable until I announce it as stable

[08-Nov-18 12:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

@siu - Chainmakers @Decker I have the dealer node caught up and running a very optimized bet handling

[08-Nov-18 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure how many dicebets it can handle, but it cleared 1000 in less than a minute, more like 10 to 15 seconds

[08-Nov-18 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it also automatically creates entropy and dealer txfee utxo if they run low

[08-Nov-18 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
please see if it is more responsive and how it does in general

[08-Nov-18 06:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I will test in a couple of hours, out of the house. Sorry

[08-Nov-18 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
assuming it survives the load test, there are just a few more things to add, like refund validation, hash tables, but i think the hardest part is done. processing all pending bets in parallel got a 100x to 1000x performance boost

[08-Nov-18 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
I also havent tested the 51% secret reveal attack, but the code is there to at least detect it

[08-Nov-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
@jorian @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 @Alright can anybody spam dicebets?

[08-Nov-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
been up for most of past 60 hrs, so would like to watch the dealer node while lots of dicebets going on

[08-Nov-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
before I collapse

[08-Nov-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
i estimate chance of KMDICE not needing KMDICE2 at 95%

[08-Nov-18 06:50 PM] jorian#4555
95% is good

[08-Nov-18 06:50 PM] jorian#4555
i'll test now

[08-Nov-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
start with easy tests before blasting

[08-Nov-18 06:56 PM] jorian#4555
did anything change for the random part?

[08-Nov-18 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
a bit, why?

[08-Nov-18 06:57 PM] jorian#4555

if the dealer node doesnt see it arrive in mempool the first time, you can sendrawtransaction again. it is harmless and I have seen it get through on the second or third try

yes, if it doesnt see it in the mempool, it picks it up when it is mined into a block, i am running dicestatus on a 10 second timer

[08-Nov-18 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
it is taking less than a second to process  a bet, once it sees it

[08-Nov-18 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 maybe a rescan? or resync. i found things were very slow and wrong after I had kill -9 to get it unstuck. after resync, it has been running smoothly

[08-Nov-18 07:00 PM] jorian#4555
did 30 bets or sth

[08-Nov-18 07:00 PM] jorian#4555
gonna need @blackjok3r scripts for heavy spamming

[08-Nov-18 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so far it is keeping up without any problems

[08-Nov-18 07:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
doing a zap and reindex, will try again after

[08-Nov-18 07:02 PM] jorian#4555
the coinflip odd is not coming back?

[08-Nov-18 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
is it critical?

[08-Nov-18 07:02 PM] jorian#4555
not critical, but nice

[08-Nov-18 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it did seem to be giving out winners higher than 50%

[08-Nov-18 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
and it uses a different algo

[08-Nov-18 07:03 PM] jorian#4555
i need that 😄

[08-Nov-18 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
changing it would be a hardfork

[08-Nov-18 07:03 PM] jorian#4555
ok

[08-Nov-18 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and i made all the fixes so far without any hardfork, didnt expect i would be able to do that

[08-Nov-18 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
any errors?

[08-Nov-18 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
or big delays?

[08-Nov-18 07:04 PM] jorian#4555
no errors

[08-Nov-18 07:04 PM] jorian#4555
but i'm losing an awful lot

we need proper volume testing the odds

[08-Nov-18 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
using mempool and still achieving consensus, it was quite tricky and still not 100% sure I got all the edge cases

[08-Nov-18 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL plz test many dicebets at different odds to make sure it is kosher

[08-Nov-18 07:08 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Ok, will do it. Hope it halal as well 😃

[08-Nov-18 07:14 PM] jorian#4555
gambling halal?

[08-Nov-18 07:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Is it?

[08-Nov-18 07:17 PM] TonyL#3577
It was kinda joke regards software properly working, not gambling itself

I dont see that anymore with the latest FSM branch

[08-Nov-18 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe use the new -addnode in the channel header and resync from scratch?

[08-Nov-18 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i do see that some peers are stuck, likely they are running older version and if you have too many such peers, you might end up with some strange behavior

[08-Nov-18 07:27 PM] jorian#4555
i'll update the mothernode

[08-Nov-18 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
but run it without the dealer pubkey for now. I want to run the dealer node during the stress test

[08-Nov-18 07:28 PM] jorian#4555
sure

[08-Nov-18 07:28 PM] jorian#4555
no need to move wallet for the time being?

[08-Nov-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
no need

[08-Nov-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
it does its own utxo management using -pubkey

[08-Nov-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
so any other pubkey of address in the wallet is fine

[08-Nov-18 07:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fresh sync, with FSM branch and topic params, still same

[08-Nov-18 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
is anybody else seeing this?

[08-Nov-18 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess it is the mempool affecting sync effect....
