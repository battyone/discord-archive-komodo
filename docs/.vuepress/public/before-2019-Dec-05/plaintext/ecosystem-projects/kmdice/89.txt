can somebody force a situation like before?

[10-Nov-18 05:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pretty much, yes

[10-Nov-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
there was a fork yesterday

obviously now the one miner left on the pool seems to have issues

[10-Nov-18 05:18 PM] 0x03#8822
which makes me believe its related to the change i just did

[10-Nov-18 05:19 PM] 0x03#8822
well, NH to the rescue

[10-Nov-18 05:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the template manipulation is server-side, so it's not going to impact miner(s)

[10-Nov-18 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
good news! The problem I had was that I made 100 payment tx to create a bunch of vouts for the parallel dicefinish

[10-Nov-18 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
this made me find the bug that I wrongly assumed the vout for the entropy txid would always be 0, off by one in the vout/vin dereferencing

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[10-Nov-18 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
so to fix it, I needed to include the vout into the entropy calculation

[10-Nov-18 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
but that would be a hardforking change and I didnt want to do it two days in a row

i'll show myself out :trollface:

[10-Nov-18 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
but, after analysing the code, I realized that only the dealer node actually calculates the entropy for the dealer entropy and that the players are posting their entropy in the opreturn, so they can change how they calculate it at anytime

[10-Nov-18 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
but there are 7000+ entropy tx using the old broken way to calculate the entropy

[10-Nov-18 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
luckily the validation uses the proof of hash of entropy, ie. the entropy used in the dicefinish tx

[10-Nov-18 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and the entropy tx includes the hash of entropy

[10-Nov-18 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so, the dealer side can compare the entropy using the old way and if the hash of entropy matches, to use that. if not to use the new bug fixed method!

[10-Nov-18 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
and i am seeing this work now that we had a bunch of bets go by

[10-Nov-18 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so after a while the entropy collision will go away and the 51% secret reveal attack will be properly detected

[10-Nov-18 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
all this was a pretty good test of the 51% attack detection

[10-Nov-18 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr spam the bets as much as possible and try to break the chain

[10-Nov-18 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
still have the dealer node optimization to make it go faster, but that wont affect any consensus, or actually any behavior as it would be an inplace change. which means we are down to just a few things left before we can consider KMDICE completed at the core level

[10-Nov-18 05:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, so we can bet now?

[10-Nov-18 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[10-Nov-18 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
spam away

[10-Nov-18 05:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, recompiling

[10-Nov-18 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
dealer node is using 5% of one core CPU

[10-Nov-18 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
let me know of any strange unexpected behavior

[10-Nov-18 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
bets should mostly be processed in a second

suggestions as to how to get on real chain?

[10-Nov-18 05:54 PM] SHossain#0007
delete current chain data and resync is the ultimate way

[10-Nov-18 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
pretty sure the IP of node posted in chain params isn't on the correct chain

[10-Nov-18 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
so if you delete peers.dat and don't add an additional peer to start up params, you won't sync to real chain

[10-Nov-18 05:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think Ive lost over 500 KMdice 😦

[10-Nov-18 05:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I even tried with one of the peers I have from local node instead of that one, because you said that before

wiat no I didnt  🤣

i could get a business account to my house.

i just hope its not $500 a month

[10-Nov-18 06:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it takes special "knowledge" to split fiber and not destroy the entire network (knowledge that no one at the phone co here has)

[10-Nov-18 06:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I would pay $500 a month, easy
We pay $100 now for 2x 10MB lines ($50 each)

just got 50mbit here ... can get 108 max ... thinking about it already 50 isnt very fast already ....

much better than the 15 it was tho

if my 20mb were really 20mb i would be happy

[10-Nov-18 06:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but when you pay for a 20mb that actually tops at 5mb, that is where you get the @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 in you

[10-Nov-18 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
likely is 20, just limited by your hardware

20mb is alright for 4g mobile nets :trollface:

[10-Nov-18 06:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but ... that said my server in perth has 1 gbit and its lucky to get anything over 60-70mbit internationally ... so it seems 50mbit+ is pointless.
