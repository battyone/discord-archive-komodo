very easy to get into a deadlock with all the semaphores being locked at higher levels

[28-Oct-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the threshold should be a dynamic one. unless it is just set to the max possible bets per block

[28-Oct-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is set to 100, and there are 200 bets wanting to be made each block, half of them will fail

[28-Oct-18 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so block.tx.size() + 100 would be a good blocknotify threshold

[28-Oct-18 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm yes true ... jorian is not going to be avalibe to set it today anyway I think just having set to maximum per block (or even abit more) would be good, unles this slows it down, I know alright amde liek 20,000 of them and itwas still working on STAKED.

[28-Oct-18 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a good thing the bitcoin wallet code isnt used directly for the CC utxos

[28-Oct-18 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes all this stuff we are working on bypasses it its great

[28-Oct-18 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
much more powerful

[28-Oct-18 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
seems BTC was sort of internally designed for the 7 tx/sec

[28-Oct-18 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
so having a wallet that can only do 7.1 tx/sec, nobody would notice

[28-Oct-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
helps with spam I guess 😄

[28-Oct-18 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
considering the relatively surgical fixes, it seems dice CC wasnt totally braindead, just unable to handle high load

[28-Oct-18 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
and only way to know you can handle high load is to stress test it

[28-Oct-18 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It could never handle high loads to amke ti work I had to slow things down

[28-Oct-18 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when testing the early times

[28-Oct-18 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
the whole mining pool bug was certainly an unexpected tangent

{Reactions}
👌 

[28-Oct-18 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I never tested multiple nodes, so didnt get this bug

[28-Oct-18 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, there is a decent chance KMDICE is almost "real" now

[28-Oct-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems to be working much better yes... FSM branch though

[28-Oct-18 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
we just need to keep pushing the max load it can handle and when we achieve full blocks, then that means it is ready

{Reactions}
💯 

[28-Oct-18 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it does seem that due to popularity, KMDICE might need to hardfork to its own cluster

[28-Oct-18 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r with this fix you have submitted you have shown your skills as a core dev. welcome to the club!

[28-Oct-18 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810

assuming the fix works, all that would be left is to fix the 51% secret reveal attack vector

[28-Oct-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
I will write up some details on how it should be implemented

[28-Oct-18 10:27 AM] Oszy#5734
@blackjok3r thanks, it works with that branch compiled everything from scratch 👍

[28-Oct-18 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I might have used up all the entropy again 😂

[28-Oct-18 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will stop my loops

[28-Oct-18 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and see if they return

[28-Oct-18 10:27 AM] Oszy#5734
sometimes all 15 goes trough but mostly less

[28-Oct-18 10:28 AM] Oszy#5734
yea that could be the case 😄

[28-Oct-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[28-Oct-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will show the dice entropy avalible now

[28-Oct-18 10:36 AM] Decker#3767
We have KMDICE Remote GUI updated, now it have new "Tab" named "History" with history of your transactions.

Nice...

[28-Oct-18 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Decker I changed some of the JSON returns from `dicestatus` and `dicebet` in FSM branch.

[28-Oct-18 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so that the actual error message is returned. This can help you display whats going on a bit nicer

[28-Oct-18 10:41 AM] Decker#3767
@blackjok3r thx for your work!

[28-Oct-18 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if there are any others you might need let me know please and I can fix now

[28-Oct-18 10:42 AM] Decker#3767
I will try FSM branch later, need to sort out latests commits and changes for myself ...

[28-Oct-18 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok no problem.

[28-Oct-18 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nice work too btw

[28-Oct-18 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Found an issue

[28-Oct-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The fork is fixed now... but if entropy is low (not sure hwo they are all gone already lol ) and 2 people are betting

[28-Oct-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it send the bet, but then the tx is invalidated

[28-Oct-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and my script gets stuck

[28-Oct-18 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and its not on an error that is new, ie... that error happens during normal operation ... so will need to add a `GetTransaction` call here to check if tx was invalidated

[28-Oct-18 10:49 AM] jorian#4555
I think I need to monitor the utxo set of the address of the fund

[28-Oct-18 10:49 AM] jorian#4555
Keep it full

[28-Oct-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes

[28-Oct-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to add a -blocknotify script

[28-Oct-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and call diceinfo

[28-Oct-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that will give you `entropytxs` at the block receive

[28-Oct-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then create X entropy to make up to Y

[28-Oct-18 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ideally it would be enough entropy to filla block

[28-Oct-18 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maye the min entropy needs to be even higher in dicebet RPC... or maybe mine is still at 2 lol

[28-Oct-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r any reason you didnt use CCduration to see if the txid was confirmed or not?

[28-Oct-18 10:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It is already using that

[28-Oct-18 10:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just looked at the code

[28-Oct-18 10:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just got a seg fault

[28-Oct-18 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
iinvestigating

[28-Oct-18 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
you used a custom GetBlock, which I think would return valid even if the block was orphaned

[28-Oct-18 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahhh ... I wasnt ablet ot call the getblock used by EVAL::

[28-Oct-18 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so i just copied it there... I had a feleling that was goign to cause problems

[28-Oct-18 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Aldo the ConfirmedTX call, did nt work as hashblock is not set by that function

[28-Oct-18 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it was hash block

[28-Oct-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
if hashblock is not set, it is unconfirmed

[28-Oct-18 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... cchain didnt even sync using that

[28-Oct-18 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe I can add hashblock to the confirmed tx call

[28-Oct-18 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and use that instead

[28-Oct-18 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm seems like that miht break things ... may need to make new EVAL function just for DICE lol

[28-Oct-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
what are you talking about?

[28-Oct-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
there is the CCduration call that takes a txid and returns how many confirmations

[28-Oct-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
if you need to check to see that a txid has confirms, just use CCduration

[28-Oct-18 11:11 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Kmdice seems to be a good tool to test the performance and illustrate the scalibity of Komodo blokchain. I wonder if it works as a zero-sum game or not. As far as I understand, people bet against the fund having half of total supply as premined coins. When betting, do people lose their bet into that fund? If so, it will be like a lottery game which means a zero-sum game. Or is it one side where people do not lose their bet. In that case it would be somehow draining all the funds in premined address in some period of time. Which one is the case?

[28-Oct-18 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CCDuration is just returning "no hashBlock" however a getrawtransaction call on komodo-cli for that tx returns that the tx does not exist... I am fixing it prety sure I know what I did wrong.

[28-Oct-18 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
dice is a zero sum game against the dealer/house

[28-Oct-18 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
lost bets go into the fund

[28-Oct-18 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
wins come out of the fund

For sure the contract will end up with the entire supply over a long enough time frame and enough bets..

{Reactions}
👍 😂 

[28-Oct-18 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
However there is no way to withrdraw the coins

[28-Oct-18 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so they are stuck there until someone wins

[28-Oct-18 11:41 AM] ch6ris#5240
So with the entire supply in the contract they are stuck indefinitely?

[28-Oct-18 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess so, unless the contract is changed in some way

[28-Oct-18 11:43 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@blackjok3r I am not so sure. It might end up with all people's bets in that account. I am personally against the gambling. However, It would be very interesting to see. I have to admit that it is very creative and shows different aspects of blokchain.

[28-Oct-18 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
there is always the next block reward

[28-Oct-18 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe this has continuous scarcity

[28-Oct-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats why I sad long enough time frame

[28-Oct-18 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but really on average it should be winning and losing equally

[28-Oct-18 11:45 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I agree with @jl777c it would keep going at least for very long period of time. If not forever.

[28-Oct-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this chain will last for a long time yes

[28-Oct-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah entropy is all gone again @jorian  I cant bet lol
