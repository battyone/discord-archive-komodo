which it calls on every dice tx when processing block

[28-Oct-18 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and its checking mempool

[28-Oct-18 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which invalidetes the block

[28-Oct-18 01:13 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Side chains, not multiple asset chains

[28-Oct-18 01:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what are side chains ?

[28-Oct-18 01:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[28-Oct-18 01:13 AM] Alright#0419
that's exactly what staked is

[28-Oct-18 01:13 AM] Alright#0419
although they aren't "side chains"

[28-Oct-18 01:13 AM] Alright#0419
just many chains in the same fungible cluster

[28-Oct-18 01:13 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Its why i thought you were burning coins

[28-Oct-18 01:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only when it hits the easteregg

[28-Oct-18 01:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otheriwise the coins are not burnt forever, only temporatily

[28-Oct-18 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
we're just calling bugs "eastereggs" now?

[28-Oct-18 01:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes :trollface:

[28-Oct-18 01:14 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I read side chains 2 years ago

[28-Oct-18 01:15 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Each human owns there own side chain

[28-Oct-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I only heard of side chains relating to blockstream, so by definition they must be bad

[28-Oct-18 01:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`we're just calling bugs "eastereggs" now?`
Only when they are features and not bugs

[28-Oct-18 01:15 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
They are pegged

[28-Oct-18 01:15 AM] Alright#0419
@kmdkrazy you're talking about staked

[28-Oct-18 01:16 AM] Alright#0419
fungible clusters in general

[28-Oct-18 01:16 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
To what you owned or want to have value too

[28-Oct-18 01:16 AM] Alright#0419
won't have a chain for every person

[28-Oct-18 01:16 AM] Alright#0419
just people who want their own for a specific reason

[28-Oct-18 01:16 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Im saying you can

[28-Oct-18 01:16 AM] Alright#0419
we are

[28-Oct-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Have you seend the streamer crazy?

[28-Oct-18 01:17 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
My personal chain could be equal to BTC

[28-Oct-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats exatly that, a chain owned by a private key

[28-Oct-18 01:17 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Im unknowingly pushing projects .... you guys are great!!

[28-Oct-18 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well as I said at that party last night, make as much cool shit as we can, then launch

[28-Oct-18 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hype lol

[28-Oct-18 01:18 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Use p2sh addresses to lock up funds ....maybe even in dice

[28-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
You're talking about what gateways cc

[28-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
allows someone to lock BTC(or whatever) and receive pegged tokens

[28-Oct-18 01:19 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
You can use p2sh for CCs

[28-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
then can trade those pegged tokens to someone and that someone can redeem them for the real BTC

[28-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
you're giving us ideas that are already being developed 😂

[28-Oct-18 01:20 AM] Alright#0419
like one after another 😂

[28-Oct-18 01:20 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Yeah...2 years ago...im waiting for someone to help me hook up VaraPay

[28-Oct-18 01:21 AM] Alright#0419
guys, guys... what if we made peer to peer decentralized money?

[28-Oct-18 01:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with an infinate supply like USD :trollface:

[28-Oct-18 01:21 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Just need a decentralized database and dustribute tx payments to multiple annonomous addresses

[28-Oct-18 01:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we would be rich

[28-Oct-18 01:21 AM] Alright#0419
monero has unlimited supply

[28-Oct-18 01:21 AM] Alright#0419
as do plenty of other coins

[28-Oct-18 01:21 AM] Alright#0419
Kind of like the idea for STAKED honestly

[28-Oct-18 01:22 AM] Alright#0419
indefinite static BR

[28-Oct-18 01:22 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Are you guys making fun of me?

[28-Oct-18 01:22 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Lol

[28-Oct-18 01:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I think infinate supply is fine as long as its not too fast

[28-Oct-18 01:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because its PoS ... people will be more inclined to hold for longer 😄

[28-Oct-18 01:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
moree coins 😄

[28-Oct-18 01:24 AM] Alright#0419
circulating supply is going to be relatively low compared to other coins

[28-Oct-18 01:25 AM] Alright#0419
we won't hit 1M STAKED for more than a year

{Reactions}
👌 

[28-Oct-18 01:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am still keen on the idea as adoption and use grows too, we can inflate the supply more... like a reverse halving, to a point then just back to static... stops whales making giant profits off users when it gets popular

[28-Oct-18 01:26 AM] Alright#0419
😅

[28-Oct-18 01:26 AM] Alright#0419
we'd need to iron that out *before* launch

[28-Oct-18 01:26 AM] Alright#0419
and honestly I'm not a fan

[28-Oct-18 01:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well the easiest way would e launch another chain int he cluster with a diff BR for X time

[28-Oct-18 01:27 AM] Alright#0419
we can't just have an "increase inflation" button

[28-Oct-18 01:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what if all notaries over 3 eras needed to vote?

[28-Oct-18 01:27 AM] Alright#0419
notaries can do whatever they want

[28-Oct-18 01:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
likely they never would actaully ... as they just lose money

[28-Oct-18 01:27 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
we can't just have an "increase inflation" button
Make it an easteregg

[28-Oct-18 01:27 AM] Alright#0419
if all the STAKED notaries decide to do something, it's happening

[28-Oct-18 01:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah, and if not ... someone can make more notaries if they disagree... ther eis nothign stoping someone starting a competing network trying to get chains to use their services.

[28-Oct-18 01:28 AM] Alright#0419
If I push a new assetchains.json with higher inflation rate and min sig number of notaries decide to start notarizing it....

{Reactions}
💯 

[28-Oct-18 01:29 AM] Alright#0419
or anyone for that matter

[28-Oct-18 01:29 AM] Alright#0419
if anyone pushes a new assetchains.json*

[28-Oct-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol, if something happens like there is some shoddy half rate unreliable netowrk offering serviced for half price 😂

[28-Oct-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
liek PIRATE CASH

[28-Oct-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[28-Oct-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
STAKED CASH

[28-Oct-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cheaper than staked

[28-Oct-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[28-Oct-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
btw simply removing that unconfirmedtx check instantly forked my chain, so thats not right

[28-Oct-18 01:57 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
@kmdkrazy im pretty sure the front fell off

[28-Oct-18 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think if unconfirmed is 0 then it needs to also check just GetTransaction

[28-Oct-18 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it should be ok

[28-Oct-18 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I worked it out, but I dont know how to fix it

[28-Oct-18 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When it calls CC_EVAL when processing block, it should use ONLY `GetTxConfirmed`, and at every other time its called use `GetTXUnconfirmed`

[28-Oct-18 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught it would be easy, just add a bool to the function, and pass it in ConnectBlock but it does not work like that

[28-Oct-18 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The DiceValidate is apssed in a scructure and has 0 arguments 🤷

[28-Oct-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Might have worked it out ... simply forcing DiceValidate to need a confirmed entropy tx

[28-Oct-18 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
still can use unconfrimed bet tx... but entropy has to be confirmed

[28-Oct-18 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when block arrives, mempool tx should just invalidate.. maybe

[28-Oct-18 04:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems to work, but need more entropy to stress it out

[28-Oct-18 04:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[28-Oct-18 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Is anyone avalible to test this please? I need someone else to bet while I am also betting to see if we fork.

@Alright

[28-Oct-18 04:40 AM] Alright#0419
spam bets?

[28-Oct-18 04:40 AM] Alright#0419
is that what you want

[28-Oct-18 04:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just need you to send like 5 or something at the same time as me... there is only 14 entropy txs

[28-Oct-18 04:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you just need to sepnd one at the same time as me

[28-Oct-18 04:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your node will get stuck but mine should keep wokring
