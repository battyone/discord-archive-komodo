at least the behavior is that there are no funds lost in this scenario

[10-Nov-18 11:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, that s very cool

[10-Nov-18 11:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
seems just the status may be : refunded ^^

[10-Nov-18 11:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
or this will be handled by GUI determining | jq -r .won == $betsize

[10-Nov-18 11:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
maybe

[10-Nov-18 11:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm it needs to be documented somewhere if it'll be on GUI side

[10-Nov-18 11:52 AM] Mylo#8306
refund = betsize ?

[10-Nov-18 11:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, bet like a just didn't happen in such scenario and bettor getting bet amount back

[10-Nov-18 11:53 AM] TonyL#3577
But with status "win" atm

[10-Nov-18 11:54 AM] TonyL#3577
And for actually won there is a status "win" atm

[10-Nov-18 11:54 AM] TonyL#3577
This is a clue

[10-Nov-18 11:54 AM] Mylo#8306
ok thanks - well a refund is a "win" in gambling 😛    what is the best TUI in use at the moment so i can copy to web gui

[10-Nov-18 11:54 AM] Mylo#8306
if tui maker is ok with it

[10-Nov-18 11:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Haha not sure if GUI devs will like philosophical  approach 😃

[10-Nov-18 11:55 AM] TonyL#3577
TUI for dice?

[10-Nov-18 11:55 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah, or are you guys just scripting it?  i made a table based off smk's work https://github.com/smk762/kmd_pulp/tree/master/Staked/dice

Decide when you should stop and when continue to play

[10-Nov-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
found the reason for hyperactive refunding. thinking how best to fix it, basically it is doing it 100x what it should be due to the 100 vout payments that I seeded the node with

[10-Nov-18 11:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Decide when you should stop and when continue to play`
All the years in casinos taught me 1 thing: I don't know how to walk away on my own 😖

[10-Nov-18 11:59 AM] TonyL#3577
You have to implant some chips with your bash script inside

[10-Nov-18 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[10-Nov-18 11:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Not casino chips - computer ones 😂

[10-Nov-18 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Sometimes, there's a danger to knowing that you can make back any amount that you lose

[10-Nov-18 12:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh in game hard to stay rational

[10-Nov-18 12:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Especially in negative edge game 😂

[10-Nov-18 12:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe one day...

[10-Nov-18 12:03 PM] TonyL#3577
But it's good decision I think 👍  I can imagine how hard it is to not lose 1/4 when you just lost other 3/4

[10-Nov-18 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, it was over time, not all at once (thankfully)

[10-Nov-18 12:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"pot committed" <- the stupidest concept I've ever stuck to in my life

Hmm I hope that nobody will lose on Dice CC money which they not afford to lose

[10-Nov-18 12:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe to put some disclamer regards responsible gambling blah blah somewhere in project descr

"It's just a game" said no one that's player professionally and won any large tournament, ever

[10-Nov-18 12:10 PM] TonyL#3577
There is a big difference between skill games (like a let's say poker) and no skill games (like a let's say dice)

i see a lot of code is being pushed

[10-Nov-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not all of it has to do with dice

[10-Nov-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is something there for staked chains ... I was goign to start on that exact thing tonight, but james beat me to it.

[10-Nov-18 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@siu - Chainmakers When you get the airdrop thing sorted, just ping me the details and tell me an addy to send to

[10-Nov-18 02:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, thanks a lot!

[10-Nov-18 02:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we will need to get things sorted in the chain first., get agama working with dice again, then see if we can get a nice gui for the dice game

[10-Nov-18 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
np, like I said I'm fine with giving back any bits that I didn't really earn

[10-Nov-18 02:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
once we have that, an airdrop to KMD holders would make sense... before it might just not get much attention

👍🏽 

[10-Nov-18 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
fixed the overeager refunding bug

[10-Nov-18 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
added some printouts to verify 51% secret reveal detection is working properly

temporarily there is a small window for doing 51% attack to reveal secret

[10-Nov-18 02:41 PM] Alright#0419
@siu - Chainmakers how many coins do you plan to airdrop to KMD overall and where are they coming from

Did we lose miners or break sumpin?

[10-Nov-18 03:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Alright plan was to get some funds for airdrop with the new chain. Now im think that starting a fund for people that want to donate for later airdropping them is the way to go

[10-Nov-18 03:07 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I think that might actually be the node that is in the params

[10-Nov-18 03:08 PM] Alright#0419
I don't think you'll be able to gather any meaningful amount for an airdrop @siu - Chainmakers

[10-Nov-18 03:08 PM] Alright#0419
I liked jl's suggestion. Taking 2M out of the dice plan and airdropping that

[10-Nov-18 03:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That was possible with new chain, not now

[10-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Alright#0419
place a 7000 coin 1500 odds bet, kill the dealer

[10-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Alright#0419
should empty the plan

[10-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Alright#0419
then recreate however

[10-Nov-18 03:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Not exactly easy to do

[10-Nov-18 03:10 PM] Alright#0419
not impossible though 😛

[10-Nov-18 03:14 PM] Alright#0419
2M airdropped to current KMD t supply would be 1 KMDICE/~55 KMD

[10-Nov-18 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
still not a crazy amount, but it should be enough to get some people interested

[10-Nov-18 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
Also could do something like ZILLA did and only airdrop to addresses that have > a certain amount

you want whale support

[10-Nov-18 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont distribute based on how much KMD an address has

give everyone the same amount
