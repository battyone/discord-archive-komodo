[19-Oct-18 12:51 PM] Philtr#9415
What is KMD ICE?

[19-Oct-18 12:51 PM] SHossain#0007
@Philtr this chain is dedicated for Dice game

[19-Oct-18 12:51 PM] jorian#4555
komodo dice -> KMDICE

[19-Oct-18 12:51 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ok ill snap them up then i can do 150 @SHossain - They just go to the same KMD address right as its an asset chain?

[19-Oct-18 12:52 PM] SHossain#0007

[19-Oct-18 12:53 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[19-Oct-18 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[19-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jorian#4555
that is a good idea, joker

[19-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jorian#4555
discord == distractor

[19-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jorian#4555
except for james who has 7 minds and dedicates 1 on monitoring discord

[19-Oct-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes .. well seems we created a way to have unlimited chains for a diffrent use that all use the same COIN .... Seems no need to create a new COIN for every chains.

[19-Oct-18 01:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Is this coin tradable? Oo

[19-Oct-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems like people are trading it to me ...

[19-Oct-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[19-Oct-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
STAKED is a metacoin

[19-Oct-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ..

[19-Oct-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
KMDICE has street value of 0.05 KMD

[19-Oct-18 01:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmmm maybe have to create own coin and trade to someone

[19-Oct-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well it can be ... when MoMoM is bulletproof ... until then

[19-Oct-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😦

[19-Oct-18 01:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Seems like a value from nothing so far

[19-Oct-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😢

[19-Oct-18 01:15 PM] TonyL#3577
At least on this point

[19-Oct-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The value = electricty

[19-Oct-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810

we will have a dog chain

[19-Oct-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤣

[19-Oct-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
how much is 1,000,000 dogs worth ?

[19-Oct-18 01:16 PM] TonyL#3577
We can create gateway

[19-Oct-18 01:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If you think about it, this had never been done publicly

[19-Oct-18 01:16 PM] TonyL#3577
DOGE -> DOGS

[19-Oct-18 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The dog chain ... maybe should not be just for STAKEDDOG ... maybe it can be for anything that requires immutable GPS tracking, to know the location of something at any time in the past .

[19-Oct-18 01:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Maybe alright and blackjoker tested it, but i dont think the idea was the same

[19-Oct-18 01:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This whole chain is a game

[19-Oct-18 01:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
50% locked, 50% need to be mined to try and unlock thw other 50%

[19-Oct-18 01:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No other minable chain had been created for this specific purpose

Ans this one is possible only now

[19-Oct-18 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This whole chain is a game, you took something that had no value and turned it into a game, which cannot be won (as long as you play it long enough) but if lucky ... you can get much value

[19-Oct-18 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe GPS chain is better

[19-Oct-18 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think STAKEDDOG will be a great PoC ...

[19-Oct-18 01:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Isnt that the definition of gambling?

[19-Oct-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@kmdkrazy  said he ahd hookups to mas produce the DOG tracker @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  is building.

[19-Oct-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but the software can e applied to anything...

[19-Oct-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it could be optional to encrypt the data so only auth can see it or could be public.

[19-Oct-18 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I see many use cases for this ... like to evade speeding fines

[19-Oct-18 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[19-Oct-18 01:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Perfect... who will put 10.5million kmd into a unwithdrawable contract

[19-Oct-18 01:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Better yet... lets find the person who can put 100m kmd into a unwithdrawable contract since inception.

[19-Oct-18 01:24 PM] SHossain#0007

@siu - Chainmakers other miners didn't sell yet. i'm just spreading the coins rather than keeping them to myself 😂
