This is just a demo for new users, is that the idea?

[06-Nov-18 01:38 AM] Decker#3767
My personal point of view - is just an example of features provided by CC ... it can be used with other CC on one chain, but i can't imagine real cases of usage of dice cc jointly with other CC.

[06-Nov-18 01:43 AM] Mylo#8306
It follows the informal spec of what it is set out to do.

For the moment it demonstrates things that can be done that are different to the other CCs.   Same answer can be applied to each CC.  They can be standalone solutions to that given problem.  oracles, gateways etc.

If there's a use case in the future for locking coins from other chains, sure gateway could be done - but as a reference contract, diceCC does what it does.

The entropy tx is another feature of diceCC i should have mentioned earlier.

[06-Nov-18 01:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Seems like the entropy aspect of dice is what we should be putting in the docs?

[06-Nov-18 01:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
here's the breakdown of the returned response:
```
"result"        (string)  whether the diceaddress method was successful
"DiceCCaddress" (string)   
"Dicemarker"    (string) 
"CCaddress"     (string)
"myCCaddress"   (string)
"myaddress"     (string)
```

[06-Nov-18 01:50 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Can someone please give me a description of what each one is?

[06-Nov-18 01:50 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
(ignore result, that one's easy)

[06-Nov-18 01:50 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I need a full sentence for each that articulates what it is, and it needs to be clear how each one differs from the others

[06-Nov-18 02:27 AM] Mylo#8306
result  is like all other rpc, e.g. "success" or "error"

the rest are smart contract addresses.
a cpl of those addresses are explained here https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Mastering_CryptoConditions/blob/master/Chapter%2002%20-%20CC%20contract%20basics#L37
privkey for diceCC is here https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/FSM/src/cc/CCcustom.cpp#L98

I'd have to play it to make reason of the relationship between addresses, the player, the dealer the game.  I'm not even a KMDice noob, but i hope to change that soon

@Bryan_Beus 
afaik:
```
"result"        (string)  whether the diceaddress method was successful
```
```
"DiceCCaddress" (string)  is the address that corresponds to the dice priv key in the source code, but it has the dice eval code modifying it 
```
```
"Dicemarker"    (string)  is the normal address generated from the dice priv key that is in the source code
```
```
"CCaddress"     (string) seems to be same as myCCaddress for dice. But might be different for other contracts
```
```
"myCCaddress"   (string) CC address of the user (from the pubkey that was used to start the daemon which was modified by dice eval code)
```
```
"myaddress"     (string) normal address of the user (from the pubkey that was used to start the daemon)
```
@jl777c  please correct any mistakes from the above  explanations

[06-Nov-18 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
seems fine

[06-Nov-18 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be possible to combine dice CC outcomes into another CC, the other CC would just have to have a dice tx proof as input, so it could be a more complex game that has some specific random chance events that are needed. but the purpose of dice CC is more to show what is possible, using a similar method a large class of other CC can be created, ie. challenge/response, deterministically provably random, realtime gameplay

[06-Nov-18 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright there is no need to create a test KMDICE chain as we can use the original KMDICE as the test chain. I am working on fixing all the issues we know of, so when that is updated, then you can stress test the old KMDICE chain. I will be running the dealer node

[06-Nov-18 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be nice if one of the pools can remain on the old KMDICE so we can keep mining it, even though the coins are test coins. @0x03 could you delay updating until we get all the KMDICE bugs sorted?

[06-Nov-18 08:28 AM] forkwitch#6080
@jl777c if it is gonna be a new chain KMDICE 2, i can make forkwitch pool dual pool for both KMDICE version also.

[06-Nov-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes it will be KMDICE2, that would be great to have pool for both!

[06-Nov-18 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
would be nice if the explorer can also remain alive for KMDICE and a new one made for KMDICE2

[06-Nov-18 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just a test chain, so one pool is enough. KMDICE2 will need more pools though

[06-Nov-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you want them yes

[06-Nov-18 08:56 AM] blubbi#0643
how much kmdice1 testcoin u need to be mined more? make an offer and i can take a look how many miners i can put on it

[06-Nov-18 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
no need, I already got some rentals that should hopefully keep the chain moving

[06-Nov-18 09:02 AM] blubbi#0643

we will be doing the snapshot at block 27000 anyway, once we get there.

Also, we will wait for all issues to be sorted out to be sure we have the fixes on the code first.
