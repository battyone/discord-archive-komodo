here For people that have doubts about the state of the chain or the snapshot. The possibility to stay with this same chain has gone up to 95% now. @jl777c has not finished debugging and fixing the issues we have, we will announce when it is ready for everyone to play. BUT, since we are inviting people to mine the chain again, we will do a new snapshot in the future JUST in case that we do need to change to a new chain.  Hope this answers any questions you guys have about the snapshot.

[09-Nov-18 08:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The snapshot we did at block 27k will be invalidated now.

btw - i've noticed this while doing tests for veruscoin the other day on a testnet, the *nomps webdashboard isn't made to display the data it gets when it's actually 100% of the chains hashrate. for whatever reason that may be... payouts and stuff will be fine (they will. trust me.), it may just happen that the displayed stuff on the pool seems off.

Notary node on correct branch is showing that

```checktoshis = ((uint64_t)GetBlockSubsidy(height, Params().GetConsensus()) - block.vtx[0].vout[0].nValue);
                // some pools will need to change their pool fee to be (poolfee % - txfees)
                //checktoshis += txn_count * 0.001; // rely on higher level validations to prevent emitting more coins than actual txfees```

seems so

[10-Nov-18 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont think that many notaries even had the old FSM branch to begin with, my guess is that if its being notarised... enough notaries are updated.

I updated pool when jl777c sent me info of his fix. Yesterday.

[10-Nov-18 10:18 AM] jorian#4555

No message from you.

[10-Nov-18 10:19 AM] jorian#4555

[10-Nov-18 10:19 AM] forkwitch#6080
No, i got only message from jl777c and llama in last couple of days.

[10-Nov-18 10:20 AM] jorian#4555

normally, someone running a pool wants to make sure his stuff is right

solution is to DM forkwitch when needed, but also good to let us know when it is updated

@jl777c found 1-2 bugs
1500 odds is winning way too much and pays out as 1 odds when betting 0.99

[10-Nov-18 10:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm assuming that the 2 are related - winning because it's seeing odds as 1 and that's why the payout is 1

[10-Nov-18 11:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
seems all 1500 odds are seen as 1 odds

But if you want to get VPN in Kazakhstan you need VPN!

[10-Nov-18 11:24 AM] TonyL#3577

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 if you bet 2 and get back 2, that means it was refunded

[10-Nov-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
refunds are not a win and not a loss

[10-Nov-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
it happens if you use the same entropy tx that was already revealed

[10-Nov-18 11:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Ohh right, refund indicating as win now

[10-Nov-18 11:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If that's the case, then shouldn't `dicestatus` return something not `win`?

[10-Nov-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[10-Nov-18 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
remember I am still in the process of debuggng and fixing things. getting status messages correct is not the highest priority yet

[10-Nov-18 11:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, I'm aware of that, but I can only report on what I see 😛

[10-Nov-18 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
the issue is that the rpc call doesnt have easy access to the amount bet. I was hoping the GUI could deal with it 😃

[10-Nov-18 11:32 AM] TonyL#3577
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  great script btw 👍  with it you're cold as ice gambler 😃

[10-Nov-18 11:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess GUI could go with `if $win = $bet && $odds != "1"`

[10-Nov-18 11:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@TonyL LOL tnks, it's a ugly WiP, but it works(ish) 🤣

[10-Nov-18 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
if odds are 1 you get back double  so just compare win amount to bet amount to know if it was a refund

[10-Nov-18 11:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Afraid that devs of GUI for this CC may notice such behaviour only in production

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 just tested, it goes as a win, but balance stays the same

[10-Nov-18 11:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
after the tx is confirmed, no gain, like if I never did the bet

[10-Nov-18 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, refund is a cancel of the bet

[10-Nov-18 11:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
work as intended then ?

[10-Nov-18 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User yes, that's what he meant by refund; I was just reporting what I saw and how it reported

first bet was a glitch one, second was a regular

[10-Nov-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
restarted node to see if it was just in a bad state

[10-Nov-18 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it was the 51% detection going hyperactive. considering that code isnt done yet, maybe not so surprising
