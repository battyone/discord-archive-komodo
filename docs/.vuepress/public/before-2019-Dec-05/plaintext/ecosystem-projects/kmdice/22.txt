59 txns in a block were 24101 bytes, 460 means almost 2 MB

[22-Oct-18 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no  problem... just sent 200MB of data into an AC in 5 mins before

[22-Oct-18 01:28 PM] jorian#4555
ahh 😄

[22-Oct-18 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the thing sending it broke, but chain mined out just fine

[22-Oct-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
10x 24k is 240k

[22-Oct-18 01:31 PM] jorian#4555

nothign in debug.log

[22-Oct-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
block decoded failed? so it is submiting invalid blocks

[22-Oct-18 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[22-Oct-18 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
all of them

[22-Oct-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not an error ive seen on this pool before

[22-Oct-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
before genie removed all the zcash stuff from  it, it used to reject the blocks, but not just say decode failed.

i don't see reject error in my pool

[22-Oct-18 01:36 PM] SHossain#0007
just started it after the chain got stuck

[22-Oct-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
someon just pointed over 1Msol at my pool

[22-Oct-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and its rejecting every block found

[22-Oct-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
decode failed

[22-Oct-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe is is a memory limit in the pool?

[22-Oct-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure ... I merged in webworkers update to node 10 a while ago, but cant say ive ever filled blocks to test it ...

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[22-Oct-18 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pool is telling you: `"Block decode failed"`
What does the debug.log for the node you're connecting to say at ~ the same time?

[22-Oct-18 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`"Block decode failed"` comes from the node, so the node should have *something* about it

[22-Oct-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181

restart the node with `-debug=1` it'll add some extraneous stuffs, but should help show more

to investigate issue needs a hex block from `submitblock` ...

my mempooli s still full

[22-Oct-18 01:57 PM] Decker#3767
main question - why pool produces blocks that can't be decoded? may be during high tx count?

[22-Oct-18 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sorry I cant be of more help with this, y pool is still doing decode block failed

[22-Oct-18 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but there is nothing i debug.log

[22-Oct-18 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
would need to add print of TX to nomp

[22-Oct-18 01:57 PM] Decker#3767
need to add printout before `submitblock` ...

[22-Oct-18 02:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you have debug=1 and the block fails and there's nothing in the daemon debug, then the only thing that comes to mind is equihashverify is wonky (did they update?)

[22-Oct-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a few soution failed on the pool prints outs

there's been a ton done to it since I last looked, so I dunno for sure, but fwiw that's the base I'm forking for my alpha (so maybe I'll see something in the process)

[22-Oct-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181

it doesnt seem to be doing the confirmations on time though 😦

[22-Oct-18 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`loopvar="0"
echo "Waiting on confirm of tx"
while [ $txval -le $loopvar ] 
do
txval=$(komodo-cli ac_name=KMDICE gettransaction $tx | jq '.confirmations')
sleep 1
done`
Will work nicely to catch the tx conf

nice... let me see

[22-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Decker#3767
btw, may be this will useful, to print hex block simply edit `pool.js` with this:
```    function SubmitBlock(blockHex, callback) {

        var rpcCommand, rpcArgs;
        if (options.hasSubmitMethod) {
            rpcCommand = 'submitblock';
            rpcArgs = [blockHex];
        } else {
            rpcCommand = 'getblocktemplate';
            rpcArgs = [{
                'mode': 'submit',
                'data': blockHex
            }];
        }

        emitLog('Block hex : ' + blockHex);  // add this line

        _this.daemon.cmd(rpcCommand,
            rpcArgs,
            function(results) {
                for (var i = 0; i < results.length; i++) {
```

[22-Oct-18 02:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[22-Oct-18 02:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
is it being attacked or something?

[22-Oct-18 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
something about the chain is making it hard for the pools to find blocks

[22-Oct-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
never saw this before. very strange

[22-Oct-18 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes my pool was fine util sometime today it seems

[22-Oct-18 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and no code has changed

[22-Oct-18 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
whatever it is, i would imagine it is latently there for any and all assetchains and even KMD

[22-Oct-18 02:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So we just found a big bug...

[22-Oct-18 02:49 PM] SHossain#0007
i saw this behaviour in other assetchains

[22-Oct-18 02:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
new block

[22-Oct-18 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
and it says 9 minutes ago, even though it just came in. so i guess it just took 9 minutes to calcuate?

[22-Oct-18 02:55 PM] c2k#4915
blackjoker mentioned a problem around 1hr 20mins ago if i remember correctly

[22-Oct-18 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes chain stalled ... my pool definatly is having major issue finding blocks, even with a lot of hash rate on it.

[22-Oct-18 03:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
is it just filtering the txs very slowly?
