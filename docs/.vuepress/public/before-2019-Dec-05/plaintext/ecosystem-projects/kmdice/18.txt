what do you have for minimum diff on the port?

[21-Oct-18 08:16 PM] Alright#0419
if it's static, what is it set to?

[21-Oct-18 09:34 PM] Llama#1330
The pool @Alright

[21-Oct-18 09:40 PM] Llama#1330
It’s 3877

[21-Oct-18 09:40 PM] Llama#1330
Diff is 3949507

[21-Oct-18 09:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can only hope that there will come a day when people listen when I say that nh is a waste for low diff chains

[21-Oct-18 09:44 PM] forkwitch#6080
@Llama It is dynamic difficulty and will adjust to your miner. https://pool.forkwitch.com/stats Now we get lot of blocks. Jump in!

[21-Oct-18 09:45 PM] Llama#1330
I don’t think it’s adjusting to my miner

[21-Oct-18 09:45 PM] Llama#1330
I’m rkk

[21-Oct-18 09:45 PM] forkwitch#6080
Network hashrate is not right.

[21-Oct-18 09:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it never is

[21-Oct-18 09:45 PM] forkwitch#6080
Whats your miner @Llama ?

[21-Oct-18 09:46 PM] SHossain#0007
i see 2.66 now

[21-Oct-18 09:46 PM] Llama#1330
It might have adjusted a little. Seems like it’s mining more now

[21-Oct-18 09:46 PM] Llama#1330
I’m just using nicehash as a test

[21-Oct-18 09:46 PM] Llama#1330
That’s probably the problem lol

[21-Oct-18 09:48 PM] forkwitch#6080
lol

[21-Oct-18 09:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
using nh is fine, as long as you do it understanding that their min submitted share is generally much higher than required to find a block on a low diff chain

[21-Oct-18 09:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
which means that until the chain diff rises, you get less than "expected" number of blocks

[21-Oct-18 09:53 PM] Llama#1330
I jst had an extra $200 and thought "why not"

[21-Oct-18 11:12 PM] jl777c#5810

[21-Oct-18 11:12 PM] jl777c#5810
i have never seen a brand new chain get so many tx/block

[21-Oct-18 11:12 PM] jl777c#5810
could it be that instant dice is addictive?

[21-Oct-18 11:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and at 4Msols, doing a 51% already becomes somewhat expensive

[21-Oct-18 11:15 PM] jl777c#5810
current nicehash mining cost is about 0.04 KMD?

[21-Oct-18 11:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it is 10x less coins per block than PIRATE, so would be comparable to 40Msols on PIRATE

[21-Oct-18 11:16 PM] jl777c#5810
this seems quite popular and already far above the lower hashrate equihash coins and fast approaching KMD

[21-Oct-18 11:16 PM] jl777c#5810
any ssell offers?

[21-Oct-18 11:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems after thousands of bets the house is up 500+ KMDICE

[21-Oct-18 11:31 PM] jl777c#5810
any sellers?

[21-Oct-18 11:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
People seem to be hoarding it

[21-Oct-18 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
or mining to bet, a lot of bets

[21-Oct-18 11:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah... just noticed the tx per block. Its quite high

[21-Oct-18 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
since it is a gamble anyway, maybe people dont care there is a theoretical vuln

[21-Oct-18 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
submit it to blocktivity

[21-Oct-18 11:40 PM] Alright#0419
I stopped caring as soon as I realized how hard it would be to pull off

[21-Oct-18 11:41 PM] Alright#0419
@siu - Chainmakers can you add more entropy

[21-Oct-18 11:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Now that 2k were donated to chainmakers, i could yes.

[21-Oct-18 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it can be 0.0001 entropy tx

[21-Oct-18 11:42 PM] Alright#0419
don't do it all

[21-Oct-18 11:42 PM] Alright#0419
yes many tiny ones

[21-Oct-18 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
just make 100

[21-Oct-18 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
have enough entropy tx to stay ahead of the average tx per block

[21-Oct-18 11:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok. Understood.

[21-Oct-18 11:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Will tell jorian when he wakes up.

[21-Oct-18 11:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But betting seems to be picking up

[21-Oct-18 11:46 PM] jl777c#5810
who is betting?

[21-Oct-18 11:46 PM] jl777c#5810
these single purpose chains seem quite popular, flaws and all

[21-Oct-18 11:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No idea. I guess the miners, since there is no selling going on

[21-Oct-18 11:46 PM] jl777c#5810
when ANN?

[21-Oct-18 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
when polo?

[21-Oct-18 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it already has more hashrate than VOT, CMM and even HUSH

[21-Oct-18 11:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Today i added it to barterdex and agama, ans started with documentation.

[21-Oct-18 11:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Tomorrow ill do an ANN

[21-Oct-18 11:48 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as you are clear that it isnt complete and we need to eventually hardfork to dice2, it seems ready

[21-Oct-18 11:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Or maybe just now. Finally my daughters went to bed. So i shouls have some time

[21-Oct-18 11:48 PM] jl777c#5810
and as alright said, the theoretical 51% is not that easy to do, especailly 10x and with the notarizing window so small the timing makes it expensive to guarantee a success

[21-Oct-18 11:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Other than theoretical vulnerability, which other issue we have? The exposed enthropy?

[21-Oct-18 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the theoretical 51% vuln, the exposed entropy

[21-Oct-18 11:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok. Understood.

[21-Oct-18 11:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So its trying to do a double spend on a won bet in the window between notarizations?

[21-Oct-18 11:50 PM] jl777c#5810
but this is a gambling chain and at worst it is a 50% dilution of all coins. ok, so that is pretty bad, but the entire chain being a gamble is sort of cool in a strange way

[21-Oct-18 11:50 PM] jl777c#5810
no, you do a double spend on a losing bet, doesnt matter, and then grind your entropy to win at max size

[21-Oct-18 11:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The 50% supply locked will be great until someone gets a lucky bet and wins 500k coins hehe

[21-Oct-18 11:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Then we will have the first lucky whale

[21-Oct-18 11:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so you reorg, the entropy tx becomes unspent and you dicebet with it using a precalculated entropy

[21-Oct-18 11:51 PM] Alright#0419
I think dice plan should have been funded gradually to match emissions

[21-Oct-18 11:51 PM] Alright#0419
at current state, one lucky bet could double the circulating supply

[21-Oct-18 11:51 PM] jl777c#5810
no coin launch is perfect

[21-Oct-18 11:52 PM] jl777c#5810
and maybe it is ok to have this flaw as it allows realtime betfinish

[21-Oct-18 11:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Still, the lucky whale will still maintain a chain more decentralized than most

[21-Oct-18 11:53 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont see a way to keep it realtime and 51% proof

[21-Oct-18 11:53 PM] Llama#1330
I’ll sell some

[21-Oct-18 11:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Since the whale becomes a whale because of luck

[21-Oct-18 11:53 PM] Llama#1330
Actually nvm

[21-Oct-18 11:53 PM] jl777c#5810
what price?

[21-Oct-18 11:53 PM] Llama#1330
I don’t have the wallet enabled yet

[21-Oct-18 11:53 PM] Llama#1330
Just using my kmd address rn. One of the team members said it should work.

I honestly have no idea how much. Would be a good price.

[21-Oct-18 11:55 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will buy it

[21-Oct-18 11:55 PM] jl777c#5810
once there is a windows gui for this... it seems like crazy usage can happen

[21-Oct-18 11:56 PM] jl777c#5810
there should be a bounty for a lite wallet that can submit dicebet CC tx

[21-Oct-18 11:56 PM] jl777c#5810
it would require doing cryptoconditions in js

[21-Oct-18 11:57 PM] Llama#1330
Somewhere around $1000 each

[21-Oct-18 11:57 PM] Llama#1330
Lol jk

[21-Oct-18 11:57 PM] Llama#1330
I’m open to offers.

[21-Oct-18 11:58 PM] jl777c#5810
some small premium over mining cost 😃

is KMDICE technically a DAO?

[22-Oct-18 12:01 AM] Alright#0419
Can I have a request for dice2? Actually betting against the blockchain itself using some chain's merkle roots as entropy

[22-Oct-18 12:02 AM] jl777c#5810
lets make a document with dice2 desired features

[22-Oct-18 12:02 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont be realtime to use future block info

[22-Oct-18 12:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Already suggested possible solutions in pin

[22-Oct-18 12:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No need to change the contract

[22-Oct-18 12:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just use 2 chains

[22-Oct-18 12:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No mining on dice chain. where

[22-Oct-18 12:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No 51% attack

[22-Oct-18 12:05 AM] jl777c#5810
or maybe notarization freq of 2
