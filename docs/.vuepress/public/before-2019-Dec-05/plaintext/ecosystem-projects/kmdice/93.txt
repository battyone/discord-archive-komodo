and in a cluster mode, it would be one dealer node per chain, so that allows to scale

[11-Nov-18 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
I think if you remove the refunded bets, it will adjust the stats to expected levels

[11-Nov-18 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810

Refunded bets noting as wins

[11-Nov-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so you are getting 1:50 wins with 1:150 odds?

[11-Nov-18 03:00 PM] TonyL#3577

Oh, you meant that there is more pushes that you expected

[11-Nov-18 03:01 PM] TonyL#3577
I thought you meant you have wins as on 1:3 odds

hmm... i have many still pendings

[11-Nov-18 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
with many nodes betting at the same time, it could be half the bets are refunded

now we have crazy betting activity I will monitor it. it seems there might be some rare deadlock edge case, but could just be due to having two dealer nodes active

Can someone explain the 51% refund thing to me please?

[11-Nov-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so if it deadlocks you can ctrl-C and see where it was stuck

[11-Nov-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
if same entropy tx is used, it allows to cheat

[11-Nov-18 03:22 PM] Alright#0419
if dicefinish tx is reorged it defaults to refund?

[11-Nov-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so if it is detected, it is refunded

[11-Nov-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
entropy is a single reveal basis

[11-Nov-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
once you see the entropy, you can just calculate a winning player entropy at whatever odds

[11-Nov-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so refund is the only sane thing to do, as it is possible that without any evil intent you choose the same entropy tx that was already selected by somebody else

[11-Nov-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
of course you can also do it with evil intent, but only the first one that is dicefinished is valid, the rest are refunded

[11-Nov-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
at least that is what it is supposed to do

[11-Nov-18 03:24 PM] Alright#0419
and if that valid one is reorged no other bets can use that entropy?

[11-Nov-18 03:24 PM] Alright#0419
they just refund?

[11-Nov-18 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

@FishyGuts ?

[11-Nov-18 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
dealer node tracks all entropy tx that is used, doesnt matter if only in mempool or confirmed then reorged

[11-Nov-18 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it is really quite clever way to avoid this attack

[11-Nov-18 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
can dealer choose to refund at any point?

@Alright until I add validation to require proof of prior tx with same entropy tx, yes it is possible, but if this happens the statistical results will get skewed

[11-Nov-18 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
