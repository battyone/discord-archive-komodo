[26-Oct-18 12:52 PM] The Crow#9299
how this it works ?

[26-Oct-18 12:52 PM] The Crow#9299
you can mine it?

[26-Oct-18 12:53 PM] The Crow#9299
kmdice its a coin?

[26-Oct-18 12:53 PM] The Crow#9299
or ca be echanged?

[26-Oct-18 12:53 PM] The Crow#9299
i found a pool

[26-Oct-18 01:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you can mine it... so far its not listed in any exchange

[26-Oct-18 01:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you can play the dice game with CLI or deckers GUI

[26-Oct-18 01:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
KMDICE wallet is also available in AGAMA

[26-Oct-18 01:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you need to run it in native mode and use the pubkey setup in settings to be able to play.

[26-Oct-18 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`$ komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getmempoolinfo

but yet
`cant find dice input`
abounds

[26-Oct-18 01:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you should just reindex

[26-Oct-18 01:12 PM] memo#0706
oh guys im running it in lite mode... how do i switch

[26-Oct-18 01:13 PM] memo#0706
i have dice balance in lite mode

[26-Oct-18 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@siu - Chainmakers If you mean me, I am at a loss as to what reindex would do, I obviously have the proper chain or else the network wouldn't accept my blocks

[26-Oct-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
@Decker do you think you can isolate why a node goes on a fork with lots of bets all at once?

[26-Oct-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
the code isnt that complex, there must be a bug in the validation code under lots of load

[26-Oct-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
or could be due to two blocks having the same timestamp

[26-Oct-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
or gremlins

[26-Oct-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
and the not finding the tx in the mempool is another clue

[26-Oct-18 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jl777c is there a way to isolate when `cant find dice input` is a result of user UTXOs vs the contract being locked up?
as it is now, the return is the same for both

[26-Oct-18 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the stdout shows the difference but not the rpc reply

[26-Oct-18 01:30 PM] benohanlon#1119
@memo close it down and reopen with KMD in native mode. Then active coin and choose native for KMDICE. It'll be defaulting to lite so make sure you choose natiive.

[26-Oct-18 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
decker is very good as isolating these things

[26-Oct-18 01:33 PM] Decker#3767
@jl777c you overestimate me a little ... first i need finish to read "How to write utxo based CryptoConditions contracts for KMD chains" and clean for myself how all of these works )

[26-Oct-18 01:34 PM] Decker#3767
@jl777c what about this "do you think you can isolate why a node goes on a fork with lots of bets all at once?" - i will try, and report if found somethng.

[26-Oct-18 01:38 PM] The Crow#9299
@siu - Chainmakers  thank you

[26-Oct-18 01:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 restart doesnt help either?

[26-Oct-18 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@siu - Chainmakers no, because it was a UTXO issue (I didn't have enough not-in-use UTXOs that were bet or bigger)

flush wallet and start over with new wallet maybe?

[26-Oct-18 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I just needed to consolidate and redivide

[26-Oct-18 01:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the problem is that, without looking at the stdout, there's no way to tell that's the issue

once again I have been saying this from beginning

[26-Oct-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem is aswell, that the inputs can be in mempool, (not confirmed block) and it cant tell the diffrence either

[26-Oct-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
James has posted how the code can check for entropy and display in dice info a couple of times

[26-Oct-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
count CCout

[26-Oct-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for user, the GUI (dAPP logic) can check listunspent

[26-Oct-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and not let you bet if you dont have required utxo

[26-Oct-18 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, that was my workaround, but it adds a ton of overhead (comparatively speaking, when compared to the rpc response having more detail)

[26-Oct-18 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes that helps, but the low level design of the CC_EVAL function means that it cannt send the data to JSON return in its current form.

[26-Oct-18 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
CC_EVAL either returns a txid or ""

[26-Oct-18 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and it pushes the reason for the fail to stderr

[26-Oct-18 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe there is a way to push it via another path, so it can be accessed by the RPC return fucntion

[26-Oct-18 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The RPC could maybe check as many contitions as possible before trying CC_EVAL ?

[26-Oct-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and onyl very edge cases then return an ambigious error

[26-Oct-18 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe we need `dicewhyfail` similar to `dicestatus`?

[26-Oct-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[26-Oct-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The RPCs I have been working, on have like 2x more code checkiung all inputs before calling any functions, so it cna return an error first.

[26-Oct-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that seems the easiest way, but adds a LOT of code overhead inside the daemon

[26-Oct-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Either way it needs to be somewhere

[26-Oct-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I found using the C++ code inisde the daemon to sort data and return is liek 100x faster than caling multiple RPCs though

[26-Oct-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and sorting / filtering via dAPP

[26-Oct-18 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I found using the C++ code inisde the daemon to sort data and return is liek 100x faster than caling multiple RPCs though`
right, which is why even though it 'adds a LOT of code overhead inside the daemon', it's still a better option than processing overhead client-side, imo

[26-Oct-18 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its definatly the best solution, BUT its a lot harder to code .

[26-Oct-18 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, if it was easy to code then I could have done it already :trollface:

[26-Oct-18 02:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
filtering JSON in python or something outside (even jq) is easier than trying to work out what class and objects to use ...

[26-Oct-18 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lukily most of the stuff im doing are all avalibe via an existing RPC, so copy ad pasting other code then modifiying as needed is an option

[26-Oct-18 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for CC's thats not the case

[26-Oct-18 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Mihailo said he was going to try and think of a way to get CC_EVAL to be able to return errors

[26-Oct-18 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if possible, thats the best solution by far

[26-Oct-18 02:25 PM] Mihailo#5902
@blackjok3r It is not difficult, just needs to refactor all the RPC calls, and all CCs to return the error in string instead of "". Takes a lot of refactoring 😉

[26-Oct-18 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
As long as its not impossible, thats a great thing

[26-Oct-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
before too many more RPCs are added ... it would be good to get it sorted otherwise it will be impossible to fix lol

[26-Oct-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess if someone can do 1 RPC then other people can copy those changes to more calls... ?

[26-Oct-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
saving skilled person from needing to spend the time on every one

[26-Oct-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe we cna do it just for DICE for now ?

[26-Oct-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
solves 90% of the current issues

[26-Oct-18 03:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we need to apply some kind of spam protection too.

[26-Oct-18 03:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Got a swap through

[26-Oct-18 03:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the node at 0.40 cents works great if anyone wants to try it.

[26-Oct-18 03:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mainly "spam protection" is only needed because nodejs pools aren't all that great (especially with end-user daemon settings), or is there something I'm missing?

[26-Oct-18 03:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[26-Oct-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but if it cannot process full blocks of dicebets

then its broken #justsayin 😄

[26-Oct-18 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, raise minbet and make it economically non-feasible
`"minbet": "0.00100000"`
just creates a cheap invitation

[26-Oct-18 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but if it cannot process full blocks of dicebets`
That's a crazily easy fix by pools actually using daemon options rather than relying on end-user defaults

[26-Oct-18 03:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes kind of ... but there is definatly a bug there

[26-Oct-18 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if the mempool is full and its just ignoreing half or more of te txs in getblocktemplate

[26-Oct-18 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hopefully decker can track that oe down...

[26-Oct-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not a bug

[26-Oct-18 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`-blockminsize` and `-blockmaxsize` exist for a reason

[26-Oct-18 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as does `-minrelaytxfee` 😉

[26-Oct-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Does he know this? or is the bug that sending hundreds of dice bet causes a fork ?

[26-Oct-18 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the fork thing is separate from the "lack of full blocks" as far as I can tell

[26-Oct-18 03:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
being me for a moment:
The fact that s/k/znomp exists and anyone can throw up a pool in 7 minutes sometimes creates its own issues in that pool ops don't "need" to know what they are doing
Just because we *can* throw up 100 pools doesn't mean that we have even one *stable* pool

[26-Oct-18 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
even as much as I've messed with the code, I never would have thought of the bug that decker found/fixed
