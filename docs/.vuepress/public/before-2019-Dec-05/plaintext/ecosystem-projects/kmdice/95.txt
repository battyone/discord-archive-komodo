debugging how it recovers from load

[11-Nov-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
@jorian I split the dealer function into two parts. one is the -dealer=1 node, and it processes the realtime bets

[11-Nov-18 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
without -dealer=1, the node would be running the diceloop and it processes the backlog and ones missed by the dealer=1 node, it also generates the entropy tx

[11-Nov-18 07:55 PM] jorian#4555
nice

[11-Nov-18 07:56 PM] jorian#4555
so the entropy creation doesn't interfere with handling the bets?

[11-Nov-18 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is on the dealer node it causes the lockups

[11-Nov-18 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
but it needs to be signing the dealer privkey

[11-Nov-18 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
so we need one node doing the diceloop and the other node the realtime processing

[11-Nov-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
I cant get my single node to catch up on the entropy tx while processing the dicebets coming in, as it locks up

[11-Nov-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
let me know when you get it running

[11-Nov-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
it should start printing

[11-Nov-18 07:57 PM] jorian#4555
so do i start with or without dealer=1?

[11-Nov-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
for now , without dealer=1

[11-Nov-18 07:57 PM] jorian#4555
ok

[11-Nov-18 07:58 PM] jorian#4555
starting in 10 seconds

[11-Nov-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
tomorrow, you can run the second node with -dealer=1

[11-Nov-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i want to monitor the realtime behavior longer term as it could still have some deadlocks

[11-Nov-18 07:59 PM] jorian#4555
and i also start cc/dapps/diceloop ?

[11-Nov-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[11-Nov-18 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
just got the dealer node running

[11-Nov-18 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a pretty strong correlation between dealer node not running and bets not being processed

now with the work of entropytx split out, i hope it runs stable and we dont run out of entropy

@jorian please update FSM branch and run it as you are

[11-Nov-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
I had to shift making the 0,0002 vouts to the -dealer=0 node too

[11-Nov-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
it should also serially process any pending bets

each one seems to take some 20 seconds or so

[11-Nov-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
soon there wont be any more utxo left for the dealer node...

[11-Nov-18 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, sorry, it deadlocks

[11-Nov-18 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, you need to manually do the sendmany100 script

[11-Nov-18 08:55 PM] jorian#4555
with an unresponsive daemon?

[11-Nov-18 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
kill it, update

[11-Nov-18 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
it will print the number of 0002 utxo it has

[11-Nov-18 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to run the cc/dapps/sendmany100

[11-Nov-18 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
to get to enough utxos

[11-Nov-18 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
then start the diceloop

[11-Nov-18 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
the 0,0002 utxo are used up a lot faster than the entropy tx

[11-Nov-18 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
need to think how to automate this properly but too tired for such tricky things now

[11-Nov-18 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
if you have a third node, just putting a shell loop doing sendmany100 would be good

[11-Nov-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
i think at the current rate of dicebet, it might take a dedicated node just doing the sendmany100

[11-Nov-18 08:59 PM] jorian#4555
what it takes to be a house

[11-Nov-18 09:00 PM] jorian#4555
it doesn't necessarily have to come from dealer node, the funds in sendmany100?

[11-Nov-18 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i am not 100% sure the validation would accept donated sendmany100, 90% sure it will work

[11-Nov-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
so one node doing a sendmany100 loop

[11-Nov-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
the other doing entropy tx loop

[11-Nov-18 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
just updated FSM to prevent long loops of processing pending tx

[11-Nov-18 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
