then which ever the miner saw first should get put into a block?

[06-Nov-18 10:25 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[06-Nov-18 10:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so the key issue to fix is that the dealer node is assuming what gets into its mempool will be mined, which is false assumption, it is the miners mempool that matters

[06-Nov-18 10:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so it ends up getting a bit confused as to what bettxid to complete, but really I guess both might need to be refunded in case of a conflict

[06-Nov-18 10:27 PM] Alright#0419
longest chain just went to 0

[06-Nov-18 10:27 PM] Alright#0419

dealer node is on that chain

[06-Nov-18 10:30 PM] Alright#0419
still syncing my second node, only at ~16k blocks and it's not going all that quick

[06-Nov-18 10:31 PM] jl777c#5810
very active chain

[06-Nov-18 10:31 PM] Alright#0419
any chance we'll keep it?

[06-Nov-18 10:32 PM] Alright#0419
basing that on these tests I guess?

[06-Nov-18 10:34 PM] jl777c#5810
I estimate 50/50 chance

[06-Nov-18 10:34 PM] jl777c#5810
still dont know if the dealer node will be able to resync from scratch

[06-Nov-18 10:35 PM] jl777c#5810
also, getting the 51% solved will definitely need a hardfork and not sure it will be compatible with the existing chain. I will try to preserve the chain, but security will come first

[06-Nov-18 10:35 PM] jl777c#5810
I see how the dice CC can be made production ready, so that is the priority

[06-Nov-18 10:36 PM] jl777c#5810
doing it within existing KMDICE is secondary goal, with KMDICE2 as the fallback solution in case it cant be done

[07-Nov-18 12:15 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i left the script running for a couple of hours and it got really messed up

[07-Nov-18 12:17 AM] jl777c#5810
i restarted dealer node half a dozen times and it isnt caught up yet

[07-Nov-18 12:17 AM] jl777c#5810
in a realtime system if any part doesnt keep up, it continuously falls behind

[07-Nov-18 12:17 AM] jl777c#5810
optimizing speed now

[07-Nov-18 12:18 AM] jl777c#5810
it is catching up at around 3 bets/sec and i think it can process a similar amount from mempool, so 6 to 10 tx/sec

[07-Nov-18 12:19 AM] jl777c#5810
but if it isnt caught up, it will take a while for the bet to be processed

[07-Nov-18 12:20 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i had to kill my chain, stop didint work

[07-Nov-18 12:20 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
CCduration all over the place.

[07-Nov-18 12:23 AM] bishop#9773
If we are planning on potentially keeping the original chain, are we rewinding the gamed bets that drained down part of the contract?

[07-Nov-18 12:26 AM] jl777c#5810
i think most of that was donated to the house account

longestchain 0 does not mean a fork

[07-Nov-18 12:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it just means you dont have consensus among peers as to the longest chain

[07-Nov-18 12:56 AM] jl777c#5810
things are faster, but still an order of magnitude too slow for a single node to be able to process a block full of dicebets

[07-Nov-18 12:56 AM] jl777c#5810
as of now, not being able to get it fast enough is the most likely reason we will need KMDICE2, but need some more days to see how much faster i can make it

[07-Nov-18 01:06 AM] Alright#0419
they may just be using up all the entropy, can stop them if you like

[07-Nov-18 01:07 AM] Alright#0419
although, seems blocks are coming in quick enough that they don't use all the entropy

[07-Nov-18 01:07 AM] Alright#0419
you may just be trying to use an entropy utxo that one of my nodes spent already

[07-Nov-18 01:16 AM] jl777c#5810
each dicebet has a chance of being rejected, even if it looked good at the time the tx was created

[07-Nov-18 01:16 AM] jl777c#5810
this is because the utxo are constantly being used

[07-Nov-18 01:17 AM] jl777c#5810
so if your sendrawtransaction doesnt work, it means it was rejected. this is a normal possibility

[07-Nov-18 01:17 AM] jl777c#5810
even if it gets into the mempool locally, the miners mempool is what matters, so it can get orphaned after being in the mempool

[07-Nov-18 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
further, even if it got into the mempool and was confirmed, normal reorgs could happen and orphan an already confirmed bet!

[07-Nov-18 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810

[07-Nov-18 01:19 AM] jl777c#5810
all these cases need to be properly handled, most of this will be in the dealer node, but the gui should also be aware of such things being possible

[07-Nov-18 01:20 AM] Alright#0419
thinking it may mess with the wallet of better

[07-Nov-18 01:20 AM] Alright#0419
if they broadcast a tx that attempts to spend an input that is already spent

[07-Nov-18 01:20 AM] Alright#0419
will their wallet realize the problem after the tx that actually spends it is confirmed?

[07-Nov-18 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
it should

[07-Nov-18 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
i am bypassing the wallet for most things, using the addressindex DB

[07-Nov-18 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems to be keeping up and able to catch up now. So now I estimate more than 50% chance KMDICE can continue

[07-Nov-18 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810

ok, recompiling again

[07-Nov-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, current version is a release candidate:
1. dealer node is much more efficient
2. entropy tx is automatically created to maintain 5000 utxo
3. large bets are handled
4. various edge case errors fixed
5. detection of the same entropy being used and in that case the dicebet is refunded. even in a nonattack scenario this can happen. a dicestatus where you win what you bet indicates it was refunded
6. smarter handling of auto-broadcasting

assuming it can handle multiple node stress test without getting confused and doesnt allow 51% secret reveal attacks, it just might be ready for production use. I estimate chance of KMDICE being able to be salvaged at 70%. The questions are if it has good enough performance using a single dealer node and if the dealer node can synce from scratch. I will do that now as things seem to be quiet, will post when it is back to the current mainchain. so get ready for stress test, but dont start it till I post it is ready
