3 tries of bet 1 in a row:
1. lose
2. lose
3. CCduration no hashBlock for txid bc812f4011272f52fd676da6ba79ce45418fe5519a36cb9d4a56092272150124

there are 6 wins of large amounts that are having error creating the finish tx due to the bug that is not fixed yet

[06-Nov-18 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810

https://github.com/z-classic/node-stratum-pool/issues/39#issuecomment-436327781 - fix for pools updated. Without updated fix mining of block like this http://kmdice.explorer.dexstats.info/block/000000f19c5d5f3b0c69d787a8d669fd5256913b684fac37c91d81bc8c39494c was impossible. I saw that 183 tx stucks in mempool for a long time, when i saw this - i started my own pool and it was unable to send block with 183 txes to daemon with error "unable to decode". Now it's fixed, after applying this fix your pool software will be able to mine any txes length block.

james is debugging the original chain. It needed to be done before we did the new chain, but at the same time it seems like the original chain might still survive.

[06-Nov-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
@siu - Chainmakers fixed most of the bugs, even large bets should work now. having multiple nodes betting at the same time still seems to mess things up, but i think it is ready for the next round of stress tests
