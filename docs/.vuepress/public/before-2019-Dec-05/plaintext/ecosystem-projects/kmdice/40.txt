NH a known good pool and get a block?

[25-Oct-18 04:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
a block was published

[25-Oct-18 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
stratum+tcp://103.6.12.112:3069

[25-Oct-18 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I put it back on?

[25-Oct-18 04:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
blocks are going through now

[25-Oct-18 04:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but they are not full 😕

[25-Oct-18 04:48 PM] jorian#4555

[25-Oct-18 04:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
oohhh I WON!

[25-Oct-18 04:49 PM] jorian#4555

Any way to exchange right now?

[25-Oct-18 05:11 PM] hamid502#6386

[25-Oct-18 05:55 PM] Llama#1330
Should I reinstall agama if I want kmdice in it?

[25-Oct-18 05:58 PM] SHossain#0007
you should, if you don't want to keep using CLI

[25-Oct-18 06:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Now its as easy as using native iguana with pubkey setup and running deckers gui

[25-Oct-18 06:15 PM] SHossain#0007
iguana? 😂

[25-Oct-18 06:36 PM] hamid502#6386
What’s going on with blocks ting hours?

[25-Oct-18 06:36 PM] hamid502#6386
Taking

[25-Oct-18 06:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there were 3 blocks in the last 2 hrs, what more do you want?

[25-Oct-18 06:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and the diff even came down 25%

[25-Oct-18 06:42 PM] hamid502#6386
I thought it was minute blocks just wondering

[25-Oct-18 06:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it is when people mine it

[25-Oct-18 06:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
folks mined some, dumped it and ran off

[25-Oct-18 06:43 PM] hamid502#6386
Well I’m still mining

[25-Oct-18 06:44 PM] hamid502#6386

[25-Oct-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
what pools exist for KMDICE?

[25-Oct-18 06:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`just wait for next block`
so the block after the block it's in?

[25-Oct-18 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
oh... not sure, maybe it is an off by 1 bug>?

[25-Oct-18 06:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dunno, it's been blocked but status never came out of pending and that's the print any time you check status

[25-Oct-18 06:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, next block got rid of the print
but still has 
```JSON
{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "bet still pending"
}```

[25-Oct-18 06:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That swap didnt happen

[25-Oct-18 06:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It will come back

[25-Oct-18 06:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Does list transactions show it in negative confirmations?

[25-Oct-18 07:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`   "confirmations": 2`

[25-Oct-18 07:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hmm

[25-Oct-18 07:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Well. The dice fund is too busy maybe

[25-Oct-18 07:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This seems to be tanking the blocks too

[25-Oct-18 07:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I have no idea why my pool sucks at scraping the mempool of this chain

[25-Oct-18 07:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😣

[25-Oct-18 07:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So we are stuck again

[25-Oct-18 07:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It seems like the cc address takes some time to process the entropy txs and that makes the chain get stuck since txs keep piling up in mempool

[25-Oct-18 07:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, it might help if I weren't the only one mining the chain 😛

[25-Oct-18 07:40 PM] Alright#0419
I have a feeling that fix for the node-stratum-pool either isn't working or hardly anyone updated

[25-Oct-18 07:41 PM] Alright#0419
tested sending >128 into the mempool yesterday, stalled the chain until I sent another batch

[25-Oct-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it does seem that the forkwitch pool isnt updated properly

[25-Oct-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
and that pool seems to be the only one

[25-Oct-18 07:42 PM] Alright#0419
for the time being if the chain is stalled, look at `getmempoolinfo` if it's >128 but <256, make it >256

[25-Oct-18 07:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
seems my problem is that no one is sending me the txes....

[25-Oct-18 07:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```$ komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getmempoolinfo

[25-Oct-18 07:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
anyone that has stuck txes, plz run

[25-Oct-18 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
is there just one pool?

[25-Oct-18 07:53 PM] Alright#0419
can somoene send 257 txs

[25-Oct-18 07:54 PM] Alright#0419
should unstick the pool if it receives them in mempool

[25-Oct-18 07:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`is there just one pool?`
from the looks of the last 2-3 hrs, my solo pool is either all there is or there's no miners at any of the other pools

[25-Oct-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
https://pool.forkwitch.com/workers

[25-Oct-18 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, then there's definitely issues with his pool

[25-Oct-18 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm only running ~400k on it

[25-Oct-18 08:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and I've gotten all 13 of the blocks in the last 2.5 hrs

[25-Oct-18 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
definitely seems like a forkwitch pool problem

[25-Oct-18 08:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
given that he had 6-8M when I started, yes

[25-Oct-18 08:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dunno if joker is doing more or finally broadcasting, but mempool is finally propigating

[25-Oct-18 08:04 PM] jorian#4555
block found, 300 txns

[25-Oct-18 08:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that

[25-Oct-18 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
and the theory is that now it should become normal

[25-Oct-18 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
unless there are still more than 128 in mempool

[25-Oct-18 08:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```$ komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getmempoolinfo
{
  "size": 124```

[25-Oct-18 08:07 PM] jorian#4555
relatively empty blocks are now mined

[25-Oct-18 08:07 PM] wookie#7663
is kmdice in the agama .43b announced today?

[25-Oct-18 08:07 PM] jorian#4555
yes

[25-Oct-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
we need more pools, and with the pool bug fixed

[25-Oct-18 08:07 PM] jorian#4555
it happens when i enable my entropy creator

[25-Oct-18 08:07 PM] jorian#4555
i'll do a cronjob

[25-Oct-18 08:08 PM] jorian#4555
with  more time inbetween

[25-Oct-18 08:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`relatively empty blocks are now mined`
lack of propigation, like I had earlier, I'd bet
```$ komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getmempoolinfo
{
  "size": 108,
  "bytes": 79950,
  "usage": 204064

[25-Oct-18 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
best is to fix this bug in the only public pool that is running

[25-Oct-18 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems the actual capacity is quite limited until this is fixed

[25-Oct-18 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so let us not push it too hard until the bug is fixed
