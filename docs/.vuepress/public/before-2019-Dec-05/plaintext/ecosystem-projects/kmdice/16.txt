[21-Oct-18 03:55 AM] c2k#4915
i saw grewalsatinder post something about a kmd dice pool on twitter
curious how to get connected tho
which URL to use 3067 or 3069?
and is there a port #?

[21-Oct-18 04:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackjok3r can maybe help

[21-Oct-18 04:10 AM] c2k#4915
ok ty vm..and have a nice night/day.
 im off to sleep for now and will ahve to ask him in a few hours.
essentially just wondering to connect to the pool i need to edit my equichas miner to read...?

server stratum+tcp://103.6.12.112:3069 --port 2095 --user <address>

[21-Oct-18 04:17 AM] CrisF#3405
@c2k I'm not the best to answer this.  Might want to wait for Blackjok3r.
This is what was said before though 👆 ```AlrightYesterday at 9:21 AM
103.6.12.112:3067
``` ```3067 or 3069 for higher difficulty?``` ```blackjok3rToday at 6:59 AM
69 is high diff
for NH
still testing it```

[21-Oct-18 04:19 AM] CrisF#3405
Seems to me `3067` and `3069` are the port numbers.
Again, advisable to check this with someone who knows more about what they are doing. (I just tried this for the 1st time yesterday 😉  )

[21-Oct-18 04:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`server stratum+tcp://103.6.12.112 --port 3067 --user <address>` normal port
`server stratum+tcp://103.6.12.112 --port 3069 --user <address>` Nh port

Im trying to do ./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE exportkey "myaddress" but I keep getting 
error code: -32601
error message:
Method not found

[21-Oct-18 06:07 AM] wookie#7663
what am I doing wrong?

[21-Oct-18 07:01 AM] CrisF#3405
@wookie `exportkey` is for a z_address.

[21-Oct-18 07:01 AM] CrisF#3405
Do you want your privkey?

[21-Oct-18 07:02 AM] CrisF#3405
If so then `dumpprivkey`

[21-Oct-18 10:11 AM] Bakes#0367
just to confirm........KMD address will work for mining?

[21-Oct-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, KMDICE is a normal runtime fork, taddr work fine

[21-Oct-18 10:14 AM] Bakes#0367
so if I mine to a KMD taddr for now, as my cli skills are non existant, once a wallet is available on agama I could transfer the priv key and access the KMDICE then?

[21-Oct-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[21-Oct-18 10:16 AM] Bakes#0367
appreciate the time. just a layman trying to understand. Trust me I am the exact type of person you want interested to justify adoption.

[21-Oct-18 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
I am glad you are here

[21-Oct-18 10:18 AM] Bakes#0367
been watching since sept 2017 and like a great novel I don't want to put Komodo down. The next chapter always leaves you thinking, what next.

[21-Oct-18 03:51 PM] Llama#1330
so i can use my normal kmd address in agama as a kmddice address?

[21-Oct-18 03:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes. Once agama publishes a new release with KMDICE integrated it should show you the balance on that address

[21-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Llama#1330
sweet.

[21-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Llama#1330
I guess I'll mine a bit to test it out 😄

[21-Oct-18 06:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
🤔 1 kmdice = 0.001 kmd

[21-Oct-18 06:39 PM] SHossain#0007

[21-Oct-18 06:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Current price?

[21-Oct-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
about 150000 coins

Mining rewards and halving schedule?

[21-Oct-18 06:45 PM] SHossain#0007
21 million total. 10.5 premined which is locked to the Dice game contract

[21-Oct-18 06:45 PM] SHossain#0007
10.5 million minable, started with 25 KMDICE per block

[21-Oct-18 06:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
1 minute blocks?

[21-Oct-18 06:45 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[21-Oct-18 06:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or is everything 1 minute blocks in the KMD ecosystem?

[21-Oct-18 06:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not sure if stupid question

[21-Oct-18 06:46 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[21-Oct-18 06:46 PM] SHossain#0007
~1440 blocks per day like KMD

[21-Oct-18 06:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Hash rate?

[21-Oct-18 06:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[21-Oct-18 06:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
there is no working actual product yet

[21-Oct-18 06:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
only a vulnurable smart contract dice program

[21-Oct-18 06:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it needs a new version if this token needs to be used in real life

[21-Oct-18 06:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
.0045 KMD

[21-Oct-18 06:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
until then it's all speculative value

[21-Oct-18 06:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
.00045 KMD

[21-Oct-18 06:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that looks still a bit fair to me 🙂 :abusedsmily:

[21-Oct-18 06:51 PM] SHossain#0007

[21-Oct-18 06:51 PM] SHossain#0007
