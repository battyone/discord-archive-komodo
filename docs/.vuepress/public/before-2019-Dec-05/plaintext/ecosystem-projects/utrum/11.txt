[07-Sep-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> if it happens

[07-Sep-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> In the long run, it should be

[07-Sep-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Anyway user who made prediction should not lose heart, because his success rate speaks for himself

[07-Sep-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I played Cindicator and had a really good strike rate

[07-Sep-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> It will be the metric people look for

[07-Sep-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> But to ask for alts for 7 days out... with BTC @ 75% dominance

[07-Sep-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> It's difficult for anyone

[07-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> For now, it looks like that. We cant keep changing the whole process based on dominance ðŸ™‚

[07-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> But I like the challenge

[07-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Based on low rate of success...yeah

[07-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yes, its possible to set predictions for 7 days, 15 days, 30 days so on

[07-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We also can change success rate deviation to 10% if everyone agrees

[07-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Is that 5% up or down?

[07-Sep-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> both up or down is considered as success

[07-Sep-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I'm gonna get a hit

[07-Sep-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> It was over a $10 prediction increase inyhno

[07-Sep-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I think

[07-Sep-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> It's moving up too

[07-Sep-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> You should get 100% success

[07-Sep-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yorklab just did yesterday

[07-Sep-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I want to get close to $177

[07-Sep-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> My goal is to get very close

[07-Sep-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> 1-2%

[07-Sep-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> You will, keep trying ðŸ™‚

[07-Sep-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> 2 days left

[07-Sep-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> There are 2000 coins and you can make predict all of them

[07-Sep-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Fingers crossed, lets see if you hit 100%

[07-Sep-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> But coming up with charts on those

[07-Sep-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Bc not all alts go off of TA

[07-Sep-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> True

[07-Sep-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Some get FA pumps

[07-Sep-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> You can always try

[07-Sep-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I can label the move up

[07-Sep-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> on a chart

[07-Sep-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> as FA

[07-Sep-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> You can mention that in description and reason

[07-Sep-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> even though it might not make much TA sense

[07-Sep-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> some people mentioned FA in description and reason

[07-Sep-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> If it does do it, then why not

[07-Sep-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I stay away from broad terms

[07-Sep-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Specific reason  within this time frame

[07-Sep-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Can we wager UTRUM against another user?

[07-Sep-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> For a prediction

[07-Sep-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Desired by both parties

[07-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We thought 1 week is a reasonable time

[07-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Or maybe, maybe you can premine another coin, and we can buy it with Utrum. And use that coin, if using Utrum for that reason is not desireablen

[07-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Waging prediction is a good idea, we will think about it

[07-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Platform is nice

[07-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> It would be a good use case of coin

[07-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Thanks

[07-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I use it as my feed

[07-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I wish I could webhook it, to an RSS

[07-Sep-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> for mobile

[07-Sep-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Thats the main feature of Utrum.  You dont need to run around for project updates.

[07-Sep-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Mobile , you can access the feed, but not on rss

[07-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> There's no way to push the feed, so I can read it on an app?

[07-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I'm not complaining

[07-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Just curious

[07-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Dont you think its too early to provide all the features ðŸ™‚

[07-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Haha

[07-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We just started so lot needs to be done

[07-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> With limited budget, we already built so many features

[07-Sep-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We put it on task list, when time arrives, it will be built

[07-Sep-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Right now, working on Rankings

[07-Sep-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Combination of Marketcap, social and developer

[07-Sep-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> It will give you a complete picture

[07-Sep-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> $174.50

[07-Sep-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I should rename my user to, The Oracle

[07-Sep-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> lol

[07-Sep-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> You need to wait for few more hours for final result

[07-Sep-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> @Sri

[07-Sep-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Funny how we are $178

[07-Sep-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I should get OOT of the Month, for that accuracy

[07-Sep-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> @Sri

[07-Sep-19 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Its not yet over, we have to wait

[07-Sep-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I need to look

[07-Sep-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> @Sri

[08-Sep-19 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Can we place predictions, in BTC, not USD.

I've never used USD, in trading crypto.
BTC price is the real price.
USD price changes, every second

[08-Sep-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> ETH-BTC could be 0.017 today, but BTC $10K

[08-Sep-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yes its on task list, other user also asked

[08-Sep-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Ahhhhh thank you

[08-Sep-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Thank you so much

[08-Sep-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I'm sure u have plenty to do, already..
