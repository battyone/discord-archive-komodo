[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Well, I'm curious.

[08-Sep-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> indeed

[08-Sep-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> How is everything holding up?

[08-Sep-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Errors or little things

[08-Sep-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So far good, No major bugs, I would call it a big achievement

[08-Sep-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> The site looks great

[08-Sep-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I would as well

[08-Sep-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> No doubt

[08-Sep-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Except few css bugs, nothing major

[08-Sep-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Monumental for one man to do

[08-Sep-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We are a team üôÇ I m only the architect

[08-Sep-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Usually with new stuff, you have down time & adjustments

[08-Sep-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Things don't always go right

[08-Sep-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We planned it really well

[08-Sep-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Which is fine

[08-Sep-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> It looks like it

[08-Sep-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Jeez

[08-Sep-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Very nice rollout indeed

[08-Sep-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Utrum runs on 16 servers including blockchain, hold, rewards, explorers so on

[08-Sep-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> 16

[08-Sep-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> yeah can you believe it

[08-Sep-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Like VPS?

[08-Sep-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> 16

[08-Sep-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> dedicated servers 8 gb ones

[08-Sep-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> some are 4 gb ram

[08-Sep-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Thats good bc it keeps everything flowing nice

[08-Sep-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Everything is segmented

[08-Sep-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> True, that is why we never had a problem with hold rewards, content rewards and portal

[08-Sep-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Thanks to @Emman - Devops he did a good job

[08-Sep-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Too much, from one place, is not good

[08-Sep-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Planning

[08-Sep-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Is that expensive?

[08-Sep-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> For a new portal it is

[08-Sep-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> But we thought, we should run it in a professional way from day 1

[08-Sep-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> that is why none of our services went down

[08-Sep-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> That is true.

[08-Sep-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We just need some traction now

[08-Sep-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Better to maintain the status quo with everything

[08-Sep-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Not like these other suckers

[08-Sep-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Trade off usability for profits

[08-Sep-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Once we get some recognition, nothing will stop our growth

[08-Sep-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I know what you need

[08-Sep-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> A contest

[08-Sep-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Problem is this, we ran so many bounties and contests and it pulled our price so down, we dint recover yet

[08-Sep-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Top 4 closest predictions to price...
Big Pot.
And then advertise to bring your friends & you'll get referral rewards

[08-Sep-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Ask the community if they can donate funds

[08-Sep-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> I m scared of bounties now

[08-Sep-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> This is a contest on a working platfotm

[08-Sep-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> They will dump and dump and dump

[08-Sep-19 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> That requires users to interact

[08-Sep-19 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I said 4 winners

[08-Sep-19 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Just a contest

[08-Sep-19 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I'll buy some and donate

[08-Sep-19 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Every post is rewarded, what more you want üôÇ

[08-Sep-19 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> More yards

[08-Sep-19 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> users

[08-Sep-19 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> ok lets plan it

[08-Sep-19 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I can buy maybe 1000 Utrum and donate

[08-Sep-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Maybe more...

[08-Sep-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Maybe others here will see value in it

[08-Sep-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Problem is not OOT, problem is very few buyers as we are not popular yet

[08-Sep-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> If someone dumps, that's fine.
I'll rebuy them and we will run the contest again.
and get more usres

[08-Sep-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> users

[08-Sep-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> The goal is more users

[08-Sep-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Ok plan it and let me know

[08-Sep-19 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I'm just trying to think of marketing

[08-Sep-19 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I know they should want to be on Utrum with nothing

[08-Sep-19 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> I added you to ideas channel, you can post there

[08-Sep-19 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> But I'm just trying to be creative

[08-Sep-19 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> others will give their opinion and we can act

[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> That should say it all

[10-Sep-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> @Sri 
Would a Dark Mode, Lite Mode, Blue Mode theme, be something we could look at, down the road?

[10-Sep-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> yes

[10-Sep-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> themes like twitter is possible

[10-Sep-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Like some people don't have the best eyesight and need a dark theme

[10-Sep-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Some young people like to customize the colors

[10-Sep-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
