[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> Hi guys! Hope all is well with all of you. Well it's the start of another week and lots to look forward to. I've been pretty quiet about the Utrum review/interview I'm putting together but that's going to change in the coming days. I'd like to see adoption and new users coming in. I think its important to emphasize that simply participating can earn rewards. It's fun, engaging and rewarding. I'm posting this message also because I'd like to here from YOU, the users. **If any of you would like to post comments on your experiences and thoughts about the Utrum platform there's a good chance I might quote you in the review**. It would add to the review very well and show the community interaction. You can post comments here, or DM me, or catch me on twitter. I'd love to hear from you,  thank you!

[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab - Ambassador> You can go through some of my tweets to get some quotes, but I‚Äôll give you this also. I'm sure you'll find better, so I'm OK if don't find anything useful from me. üòÄ 

Although I‚Äôve been involved with Utrum from the beginning, I had no idea how useful it would be until the portal launched. The two areas I never gave any thought to before is News and Events. You get news for any coin of your choosing; or if you can simply choose to follow all cryptocurrency news in general and never miss a thing. I find myself going there every day now. The same goes for the Events section; it amazes to see all that is happening virtually every day in the crypto world. Lastly, voting can be addictive! You can vote on anybody‚Äôs post, and it‚Äôs so simple; just one click and you‚Äôre done. Then on top of that you get paid for voting! Making money with just a few mouse clicks is a no brainer to me.

[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> excellent, ty @YorkLab - Ambassador

[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> @Sri 
 @gigamesh & I talked and I think we were both in agreement, that a two option,  dark UI & light UI would address everyone's needs. So I made something for you, as an example.
As always, these are only suggestions, not complaints. And the examples are an attempt at trying to be constructive, instead of just coming here and saying we want this or that ... ‚ù§

[26-Sep-19 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> I wonder if you could hold the article for 30 mins on your server before committing to blockchain and allow 30 mins of editing. somertimes things look diff when u upload. i cant recall is there a Preview button?

[26-Sep-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> a preview button would help. one of my reviews i copy pasted from a different website looked good in the editing window but after uploading some of the images ended up being huge.
