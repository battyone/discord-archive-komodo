[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> Sorry, @wanderingwahoo , we're still a bit used to Slack.

[13-Jul-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> Sometimes I look for the thread button üòÖ

[13-Jul-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab> @Cryptoon  it's 2 months when the wallet comes out in August.

[13-Jul-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cryptoon> Ahaa not just agamac

[13-Jul-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cryptoon> ?

[13-Jul-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab> When OOT wallet comes out then the OOT Holding Reward (OHR) will apply.

[13-Jul-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab> Should be out sometime next month.

[13-Jul-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab> Does not work in Agama.

[13-Jul-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> It shouldn't be hard to implement in Agama as well. But we cannot make promises about when that will happen.

[15-Jul-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cryptoon> Was the referral bounty OOT already distributed?

[15-Jul-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cryptoon> I have some OOT I cant account for in my blockfolio and wondering if I bought it or whether it was from the bounty :p

[15-Jul-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab> If you mean from bountyhive, yes there was a distribution.

[15-Jul-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cryptoon> No the 5% bonus

[15-Jul-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cryptoon> I dont think its that, think I bought some more, will check barterdex files tomorrow

[16-Jul-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Yes @Cryptoon referral tokens are distributed

[16-Jul-18 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> You received them

[16-Jul-18 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cryptoon> Was it july 5th?

[16-Jul-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Yes @Cryptoon

[16-Jul-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> You also got some extra OOT for being early bird supporter üòÉ

[16-Jul-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cryptoon> Alright cool!

[16-Jul-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdutrum] <Crumb> i asked about the vesting functionality timeline a couple of weeks ago. it's going to be part of the OOT wallet functionality and if i remember correctly the timeline was beginning of september
@goldenman

[26-Jul-18 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> @goldenman James is developing a long term solution, it's actually already coded, you can check the discussion yesterday at #crypto-conditions on the Komodo Discord. 
Meanwhile we're researching and developing intermediate solutions for the same problem, that don't require hard fork (inevitable in the middle/long term).

[26-Jul-18 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> The alpha wallet is already working, it just needs the new features added, you can check our Github.

[26-Jul-18 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> It requires a re-design too.

[26-Jul-18 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> Our web designer is working on it.
