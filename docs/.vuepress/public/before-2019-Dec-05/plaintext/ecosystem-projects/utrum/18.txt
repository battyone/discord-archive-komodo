[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yes, Preview will be a good option, will add to task list

[26-Sep-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> @Sri - Lead as u were telling me in DM dPoW notarizes the articles/reviews/predictions we write to the Bitcoin blockchain. Is it human readable on the BTC chain (i.e. ASCII text?)

[26-Sep-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> (thought id share this question with the crowd)

[26-Sep-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> No

[26-Sep-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Content is in the block, blocks are notarized to KMD and then to BTC

[26-Sep-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> so on the utrum explorer my review is humam readable (http/ascii) https://explorer.utrum.io/opreturn/api/v1/blockchain/579744-044382

[26-Sep-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Its possible to view it on Utrum explorer

[26-Sep-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> when that tx is notarized to KMD does it still have that data?

[26-Sep-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> It does

[26-Sep-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> and so when it goes to BTC does it still have that http/ascii data?

[26-Sep-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Technically it is. I should speak to emman to get more details

[26-Sep-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> that would b great if u could confirm

[26-Sep-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> will do

[26-Sep-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> thx! would b cool if it does still look like that

[26-Sep-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> on the BTC chain

[26-Sep-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yeah but thing is this, we can track only from OOT - KMD

[26-Sep-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> we cant track from KMD - BTC

[26-Sep-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> OOT cant but KMD presumably can yes?

[26-Sep-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> KMD does notarize every chain they have to BTC

[26-Sep-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So cant track OOT there

[26-Sep-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> is there such a thing as a dPoW explorer?

[26-Sep-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> But can be synced

[26-Sep-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> would b useful

[26-Sep-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So I assume you cant see the ascii on kmd or btc

[26-Sep-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Only possible on OOT explorer

Statistics for the Komodo Platform's dPOW notarization of KMD and supported blockchains.

[26-Sep-19 10:24 AM] gcharang#6833
the data flowing from OOT -> KMD and KMD -> BTC
are just blockhashes signed by Notary nodes
so on the BTC chain, there will be a "Proof" of existence of a certain post in the OOT blockchain at a certain time
it guarantees that the posts haven't been tampered after the notarization time (unless the BTC blockchain has also been tampered)

[26-Sep-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Thanks for the clarification charan

[26-Sep-19 10:28 AM] gcharang#6833
no problem!

[26-Sep-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> so BTC proves the authenticity but does not serve as a backup in the event of catastrophic blockchain attack

[26-Sep-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> i suppose keeping local backups of the OOT chain data is enough

[26-Sep-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> esp since BTC can validate it so to speak

[26-Sep-19 10:36 AM] gcharang#6833
all the nodes running the OOT blockchain will have a copy
even if a 51% attack is done, only the txns/b;ocks that are yet to be notarized are vulnerable
once a txn/block is notarized, unless someone hacks all the nodes and deletes the blockchain, there is no problem

[26-Sep-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> thanks

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> You can promote your utrum post links on discord channel #üìò-member-posts

[26-Sep-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> @Sri - Lead what about comments for predictions/reviews?

[26-Sep-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Your vote is your opinion on Utrum

[26-Sep-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> some guy called Benedict doing masses of reviews

[26-Sep-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> @Sri - Lead about predictions.  I notice there r no time frames. would time frames be useful?

[26-Sep-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 7 days is time frame

[26-Sep-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> You mean like 7 days, 15 days, 30 days?

[26-Sep-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> yeah

[26-Sep-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ok so predictions are for 7 days?

[26-Sep-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> so like if BTC is 9000 and i predict 7500. after 2 days it hits 7500, but then goes back to 10 k on day 7. was i right or wrong?

[26-Sep-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> i assume i am right but maybe being able to pick a time frame is useful?

[26-Sep-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> The time frame is 7 days

[26-Sep-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So you are wrong

[26-Sep-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ooohhh

[26-Sep-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> System only checks the price for 7 days

[26-Sep-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ooohh that means we def need time periods imo

[26-Sep-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> my BTC 7300 is happening

[26-Sep-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> dunno where itll be in a week

[26-Sep-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yeah not just you, the rule is same for everyone

[26-Sep-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Everyone is predicting for 7 days

[26-Sep-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> sure

[26-Sep-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> fair enough

[26-Sep-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Problem with providing time frame - voting is for 5 days now, rewards are paid based on 5 day voting

[26-Sep-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> After few months, we plan to change prediction rewards based on success rate, then we can provide time frame option - 7 days, 15 days, 30 days

[26-Sep-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Now we are paying everyone irrelevant of success rate just to encourage them

[26-Sep-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Voting becomes important as we grow, if many people agree with prediction, then most likely people will buy or sell based on it

[26-Sep-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> That is the power of community predictions

[26-Sep-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> thanks for explaining

[26-Sep-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> would it b possible to get this page to auto-refresh https://utrum.io/cryptos ?
