[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> You can vote when we do it

[13-Sep-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> it takes me more than 3 days to write the damn thing üòâ

[13-Sep-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> I understand, but trust me 3 days is more than enough

[13-Sep-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> when we have lot of posts per day

[13-Sep-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So, the logic here is get more followers

[13-Sep-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> > I understand, but trust me 3 days is more than enough

[13-Sep-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> if like twitter then yes

[13-Sep-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So your post gets into their feed, they vote

[13-Sep-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> but this is like medium as well?

[13-Sep-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yes its like medium

[13-Sep-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We have 4 different types of content so we need some uniformity so that we dont confuse members

[13-Sep-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> well then.. id like to hear other opinions on this... what say y'all?

[13-Sep-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> is 3 days enough?

[13-Sep-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> @Sri - Lead üòâ

[13-Sep-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> everyone

[13-Sep-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Ok I hit the panic button lol

[13-Sep-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Lets see

[13-Sep-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> cool, everybody pitch in

[13-Sep-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Are you comfortable with 3 day voting or do you wish to have 7 days, 15 days or 30 days?

[13-Sep-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <FtrSaroth> 7 days

[13-Sep-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Crypto Baggins> I feel like 7 is good

[13-Sep-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Jimm B.> 7üëç

[13-Sep-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ill settle for 7

[13-Sep-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> üòâ

[13-Sep-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We just got 3 votes

[13-Sep-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> in 30 secs

[13-Sep-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> we wait

[13-Sep-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> were u thinking of twitter when u picked 72 hours?

[13-Sep-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> did you calculated content reward supply?

[13-Sep-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @gigamesh It was 15 days at the start, but we changed it to 3 days

[13-Sep-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> why?

[13-Sep-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> I thought when there are lots of posts, no one will read the old ones

[13-Sep-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 3 days also let user login atleast once into the system üôÇ

[13-Sep-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> 3 is ideal to me, community is still tiny, we can't predict how many time consume the reward supply when we are very huge community

[13-Sep-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> @gigamesh what's up guys

[13-Sep-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @Zafer - TR Ambassador Its a good angle, we also need to think not to overpay

[13-Sep-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> This might cause more inflation

[13-Sep-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> 7 days, take the rewards down 30%

[13-Sep-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> even over generous right now

[13-Sep-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> across the board

[13-Sep-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I like that too

[13-Sep-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> reward  early users

[13-Sep-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> yeah I said like bitcoin's early mining days

[13-Sep-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We dint recover from the bounties we paid yet

[13-Sep-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @Privatoshi - Ambassador whats the logic? 7 days take reward down

[13-Sep-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Spread out

[13-Sep-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Decrease risk of inflation

[13-Sep-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> You are missing every post does that, it means more votes, more rewards

[13-Sep-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763

[13-Sep-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We already paying good amounts but market price is low, so it appears as peanuts

[13-Sep-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Can we get our Turkish friends involved

[13-Sep-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 21 Million OOT for hold rewards

[13-Sep-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> What do you believe is an issue or something to look at Giga?

[13-Sep-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Lack of awareness

[13-Sep-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> i write a detailed review and give only 72 hours for it to go "VIRAL". having said that i dont underatnd teh reward system Utrum has

[13-Sep-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Well we need to get that resolved

[13-Sep-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Do you know anything about it?

[13-Sep-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Or should we start from scratch

[13-Sep-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> there's a Predictions section (last question b4 i read all the docs).... most of those predictions are for events more than 3 days in the future. how r ppl rewarded for being right?

[13-Sep-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> 7 days

[13-Sep-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> You get a 5% variance from the projected price and actual price

[13-Sep-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> U hit that, you are successful

[13-Sep-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @gigamesh We are paying rewards based on member vote, same like rest

[13-Sep-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Later, we consider only success rate

[13-Sep-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> My apologies

[13-Sep-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> The platform relies on user input

[13-Sep-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ah YorkLab

[13-Sep-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> have seen ur significant contributions

[13-Sep-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab - Ambassador> I think it's too early to make changes. If you keep making changes people will get confused. As @Sri said, let's give it more time then vote on a permanent change.

[13-Sep-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab - Ambassador> @gigamesh yes, just trying to do my part to contribute.

[13-Sep-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> absolutely. i was only curious about why 3 days was regarded optimal

[13-Sep-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> @gigamesh mate, copied contents are not allowing in platform, you should write and never published somewhere üôÇ

[13-Sep-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> i copied myself

[13-Sep-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> is that allowed lol?

[13-Sep-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> yes lol

[13-Sep-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> hahaha

[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> I noticed now

[13-Sep-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> cool review, choose us first next time, we need you  more than anyone ‚ù§

[13-Sep-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> so members vote and funds which they do not control (from total/reserve/someotehrname supply) go to the those they vote for?

[13-Sep-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
