[dscrdutrum] <benohanlon> FYI everyone I am suggesting something for Komodo that you may want to have a say on because it could benefit. It's an idea for a 'brief and micro-bounties' community that would create a decentralized resource for our content, comms and marketing and bring it into line with Komodo's ecosystem. I've recorded a video of myself explaining it (not official KMD video just me talking!).

If you're interested please come and share your thoughts here and leave comments https://forum.komodoplatform.com/t/about-the-komodo-influencer-network-category/117. 

If this gains enough traction and you like the idea I can take this to Steve and JL777 and suggest we try it out. Please make your voice heard! 

P.S. if you just want the video it's here https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=O1LdWU1WEQo.
