[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Same lead developer

[13-Sep-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Steemit got more bots than normal users

[13-Sep-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I think that dissuades even some potential good contributor's from joining

[13-Sep-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Basic methods usually work best. 
No different here.

[13-Sep-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 2fa and slider are new things for Utrum.  No social network uses it

[13-Sep-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> maybe? https://www.autoitscript.com/

[13-Sep-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Try it and see if you can manipulate

[13-Sep-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> not worth yet, enter 2fa at start, then start the script but need available 1000+ content for worth to write üôÇ

[13-Sep-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> maybe we can set a timer between two voting, cooldown

[13-Sep-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> later

[13-Sep-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yeah like reddit

[13-Sep-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> As we grow, many things can be done

[13-Sep-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> For Beta, I think we already have a lot of things

[13-Sep-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We just need users and content now

[13-Sep-19 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I agree.
Need feedback from a variety of users

[13-Sep-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> What happens when the 100M rewards have been fully spent? (sry if WP covers this, reading now)

[13-Sep-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> i.e. will there be more than 216M one day?

[13-Sep-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ``Contributors are rewarded OOT tokens whenever a user rates content within a period of 30 days. This allows articles or other content provided by a contributor enough time to be discovered and given adequate assessment by the community. This also promotes an active, healthy community ecosystem by motivating both contributor and curator.
``

[13-Sep-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ok so used to be 30

[13-Sep-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> can I see my **MVA**?

[13-Sep-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> was there a trustee election recently, how dod it go?

[14-Sep-19 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Gigamesh with good questions

[14-Sep-19 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> MVA calculations look complex

[14-Sep-19 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> the paper mentions MVA and coefficients and the rating system. Just wondering if I can see my own MVA rating or coefficient or whatever

[14-Sep-19 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> also i read in the wp about the 12 trustees and how another 6 would be voted every 6 months or something. Has that happened, how did it go?

[14-Sep-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Elections will be held in Jan 2020, once we have enough members

[14-Sep-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Mva not implemented yet

[14-Sep-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We need more content

[14-Sep-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Right now, it's 5 posts a day

[14-Sep-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Ad revenue and other revenue sources will be rotated so it will never end

[14-Sep-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> I think we won't spend more than 64 million from the 108 million reserve

[14-Sep-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We launched the project on Aug 22 last month

[15-Sep-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I really look forward to reading what will be, a very honest review about Utrum.

[15-Sep-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I think everyone has contributed their own thoughts about Utrum, to @gigamesh.

[15-Sep-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> But we invited you here, to write your own thoughts. How do you feel?

[15-Sep-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Community been helpful?

[15-Sep-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> yep was chatting with Sri last couple hours. should be fun üòâ thanks @Privatoshi - Ambassador for introducing me me to Utrum üëç

[15-Sep-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> To be honest, I wanted you to come here and write an honest review on utrum

[15-Sep-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> everybody been great!

[15-Sep-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I felt like it would be mostly hands off

[15-Sep-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> And that you would have freedom to look at what you want to.

[15-Sep-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Like I said, most of all, we just want your honesty and your enthusiasm, to be in the article

[15-Sep-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I'm glad you came here.

[15-Sep-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> And I hope you hang around, as we grow

[15-Sep-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> There are some good projects in crypto.

[15-Sep-19 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> @gigamesh thx for coming here

[15-Sep-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> sure, np. i like the incentive scheme and will use the platform + stash away some OOT

[15-Sep-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> scheme lol.... design, layout, platform

[15-Sep-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> model.... that's the one

[15-Sep-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> incentive model

[15-Sep-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> i guess scheme sounds sinister lol

[15-Sep-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> altho is still correct in the context of incentives

[15-Sep-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Maybe if we are talking specifically using the oxford dictionary.

[15-Sep-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> But we know words take on new meanings, and then those definitions change.

[15-Sep-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> schematic and scheme are two different words

[15-Sep-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> A schematic is a way something is set up
A scheme is a plan, usually sinister.
