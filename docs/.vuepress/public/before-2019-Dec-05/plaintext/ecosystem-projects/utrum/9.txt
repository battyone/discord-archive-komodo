[dscrdutrum] <Smedley> The prediction feature looks interesting. How will it work?

[06-Jul-19 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @Smedley A trading analyst can make a prediction. He need to set price for the question " What will be the price of coin after 15 days". He needs to mention reason and can provide charts to support his prediction.

[06-Jul-19 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Members can vote on this prediction, if they agree or disagree with the prediction

[06-Jul-19 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> If analyst make a prediction for a coin ( example kmd), he will not be able to predict again until 15 days. He can predict other coins though.

[06-Jul-19 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We assign success rate to the analyst based on the prediction result. This is the metric you should look for to understand the capability of analyst along his Reputation Score

[06-Jul-19 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Reputation score is the result of verdict, how many members agrees with this post, be it a review, prediction, insight or report

Hello guys. Did rightbtc delist Utrum? I can only access my OOT via the wallet of the old site. The new site doesn't have any OOT trading pairs

[18-Jul-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Seems they dint update our wallet yet

[18-Jul-19 01:21 PM] Simon#6247
Ok thanks for the headsup. You can still withdraw Utrum from the old site though, so it's no big deal. Any remaining orders I had on the Utrum pair have been cancelled and the BTC is in the wallet of the new site, so it's fine.

Made my first review on @utrumdotio I reviewed @PirateChain. I definitely see a strong future for this coin and after a few key developments like lite wallets and atomic swaps, it will be an easily adopted top notch privacy coin. Now waiting on others to review my review :D

Testing @utrumdotio again, here's a SWOT analysis of @PirateChain. I'm definitely a lover of ARRR but in making reviews it's important to be objective & understand where weaknesses are. Luckily many of these are already on Pirate's radar & progress is being made daily.

Very unobtrusive, looks good.
