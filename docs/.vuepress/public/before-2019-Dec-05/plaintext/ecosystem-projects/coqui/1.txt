Just curious do they peg it to usd? I see 2.77 Coqui =17.53 usd? Did coqui just 'moon' as its refered to?

[01-Jul-18 03:07 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
An OTC purchase price doesn't effect the market price still being a pseudo of 20cents

Had a discussion with my friend last night about an idea for a game. Its free to play and paid for by product placment, you can so silly things like use your ingame earned crypto to buy a voucher for pizza which allows you to order an actual real life pizza to be delivered. It would be super cool. Not sure how viable it is to create, but we are going to brainstorm it out before I head home.

it's an inverse 10x as KMD is ‚¨á over 50% BTC

@blackjok3r i actually thought about something similar

turns out that cock fights is a national sport in PR

[06-Jul-18 12:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[06-Jul-18 01:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That would be a good idea too. My mate and I had a big discussion, his game idea is to say the least large in scope and would not be easy to make.

[06-Jul-18 01:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have no doubt it would be successful though if it could be made.

[06-Jul-18 01:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it would definitively help with adoption

@siu - Chainmakers look in #komodo-pioneers i posted some links to the unity assetstore (game dev) there might be a "fighting" style game template already where you'd only need to supply graphics for your animals.
otherwise, there are html5 frameworks that might have samples of a fighting game that could be modded.
check that channel - i'll keep an eye out as well for something that could fit your purpose, otherwise reddit gamedev and related subreddits might be able to source something to help

We are happy to announce that on block 200,000 COQUI Cash will do a fork to add Crypto Conditions Smart Contracts capability. This fork will add a fully functional Decentralized Token Exchange, capability to create you own token, a decentralized dice game, capability to create rewards programs and a decentralized faucet. 

Please, if you are running a COQUI full node, update your node as soon as possible to evade a fork on your node. 

The new COQUI Cash execution command looks like this: ./komodod -ac_name=COQUI -ac_supply=72000000 -ac_ccactivate=200000
Questions or suggestions are welcomed,

have a nice day everyone.
