[25-Oct-18 12:43 PM] crumb#2550
@Virginia (Peer2Group) i'm curious why is the amount of tokens dropped to KMD holders expressed as 200.000 not just 200?

[25-Oct-18 12:43 PM] crumb#2550
as there is only going to be total 10 million pungo tokens. so it can't be 200 000

[25-Oct-18 12:44 PM] crumb#2550
200.000 can be understood differently in many parts of the world

[25-Oct-18 03:26 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
hey @crumb right will change to 200k

[25-Oct-18 03:28 PM] crumb#2550
so how can it be 200 000 tokens per KMD address

[25-Oct-18 03:28 PM] crumb#2550
if there are only 10 million tokens total

@kimmel (Pungo.io)

[25-Oct-18 03:42 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275

[25-Oct-18 03:45 PM] crumb#2550
aah, ok

[25-Oct-18 03:45 PM] crumb#2550
my bad

[25-Oct-18 03:45 PM] crumb#2550
yes 200k total

[25-Oct-18 03:45 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
we are airdropping 200k PGT among kmd addresses holding 10+ kmd

[25-Oct-18 03:45 PM] crumb#2550
do you know the snapshot date yet

[25-Oct-18 03:46 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275

secret snapshot to avoid manipulation :)

[25-Oct-18 03:47 PM] crumb#2550
then it should be in the past. otherwise it's impossible to prevent now

[25-Oct-18 03:55 PM] gt#2812
is there an airdrop for voters?

[25-Oct-18 04:01 PM] crumb#2550

😎 

[25-Oct-18 09:06 PM] SadykovT#2123
recently, chainzilla did airdrop on all wallets that have more than 500 KMD

[25-Oct-18 09:07 PM] SadykovT#2123
will the size of airdrop depend on the amount of kmd on the wallet ?

[26-Oct-18 12:35 AM] gt#2812
@crumb  ah right, kind of hidden. i think the same could have been said to you as well 😉

[26-Oct-18 03:33 PM] BlockTech#6895
@SadykovT  No, it will be a fixed amount for all wallet with more than 10 KMD.

@Virginia (Peer2Group) Any BUG bounty up in here ?  Seems that android wallet has a bug bro .....when transfering wallet to a new phone ive created a new wallet on new handset and installed it via seed and my assets PGT , KMD are not showing 😦 upon closing and restarting thinking this will remedy the problem im now told the new pin i created (used same as old one) and i am now locked out of the new wallet on the new handset

[17-Nov-18 02:26 PM] Virginia (Peer2Group)#1459
Hi @Cryptoprenuer let me check it with technical team, I will keep you updated

[17-Nov-18 03:19 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
hey

[17-Nov-18 03:20 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
@Cryptoprenuer will contact through PM to fully understand whats the problem

[18-Nov-18 12:10 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I have been checking Bassliner comments and pending on new proofs or  comments sor far the possibilities I see are:

1) He commented about different addresses on different devices with same seed. That is only possible doing a typo when recovering the seed. Which effectively creates 2 seeds. the ''original seed'' and the ''typo seed''. One seed always has same address in any device and since our seed is non BIP39 compatible, each seed always has only 1 address for each coin.

2) About setting a PIN and not being able to re-open the wallet using the PIN in the wallet anymore. I dont discard some kind of bug in a given device. I have tested on some devices and couldnt reproduce. Additionally, this should not happen using the web version mobile.pungo.app however will ask the team to make some tests on previous android versions, just in case

[18-Nov-18 04:55 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Virginia (Peer2Group) does agama 43.d support Pungo?

[18-Nov-18 11:59 AM] yorklab#7270
I couldn't find it when activating coin, unless they have their own version of Agama.

@FishyGuts @yorklab I checked last week, you can add PGT as full node or light node, from inside the wallet

[18-Nov-18 05:17 PM] yorklab#7270
Hmmm, I have 2.43d and I still don't see it unless I somehow I keep missing it when I look.

is it right, that I cant transfer  PNG coins from the airtrop from  my android Pungo wallet to my Agama wallet. They are blocked?
Pungo Version 0.3.3

can I suggest to carefully backup your seed. Uninstall Pungo Wallet and install it again? just in case, that might help

I do not get an error message. After transferring, the top bar will run and run and run.
I will be new in this evening.
I will inform you later
