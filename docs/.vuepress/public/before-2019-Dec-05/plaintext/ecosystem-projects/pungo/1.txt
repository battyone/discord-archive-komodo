good luck peer2 ppl.   i 'm interested to see how to use the token for fees at a discount.  i think this same/similar model will work for community owned businesses (for purchasing the goods of the co-op by local residents).

I'm on this.   Setting up to put 1,000 KMD into the ICO.   

Good luck!    Your buyback model is fantastic.   

Do you think this could be adopted for other companies trying to raise funds that eventually want to become self managed and sustained?   

Let's say for example, I want to raise 10 Million in funds to invest in loans.  
As the loans payback, the buyback fund will increase through the interest earnings and investors can withdraw their original investments through the buyback fund allocation.    Hopefully to the point where the company holds all the original assets/funds.  

Is this the goal for Peer2?

[10-Sep-18 08:02 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
good to see you onboard @Mylo @FishyGuts

[10-Sep-18 08:07 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
sure there are many models which can be built on this model. Buybacks seem to me a promising model if correctly applied. 

As always the model needs to be developed properly and I hope some countries will allow to do it. Because drawning innovation with high capital needs and bureaucracy is the same old way of limiting innovation only to the rich, and they always try to do so.in order to keep on that ''layer''

[10-Sep-18 08:08 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
we hope to develop a legal frame with Inlea Foundation collaboration which could maybe also apply to other projects, so this is just the start

Is Pungo a dICO?

not exactly we found dICO model a bit complex or not as user friendly as we would like, so we adapted our backend to do the sale almost automatically

thats in fact a node, so you can include 1st question one here. But not sure this node will allow connections from.additional nodes @jorian @Deleted User

[15-Sep-18 12:09 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
probably we capped connections to unknown nodes to avoid problems until we add DPoW

[15-Sep-18 12:12 PM] Seko#7408
@kimmel (Pungo.io) that means exactly, that Pungo is a token on the Komodo chain?

[15-Sep-18 12:13 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
mmm not exactly we created an independent chain which will be later notarised using komodo DPoW

[15-Sep-18 12:14 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
for now its an independent chain with 10 million coins, with block under demand (when there are tx on the mempool=aka queue, miners nodes generates a block automagically)

[15-Sep-18 12:15 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
however there are no fees to send tx (its free) and miners get 0 fees to mine blocks

[15-Sep-18 12:18 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
that means there is no economic reason to mantain the blockchain if you dont run a service supporting PGT. Thats why appart of having our nodes with the chain, when we add komodo DPoW we make sure that the 64 notary nodes of komodo will be mantaining our chain + it gets copied (backed) into Bitcoin blockchain through this notarization service, so it means it gets fully secured

[15-Sep-18 12:18 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
clear enough @Seko ??

{Reactions}
💯 

[15-Sep-18 01:28 PM] Seko#7408
Can you tell me more about the use-case? Which problem will solved Pungo?

[15-Sep-18 01:46 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
hey @Seko good you make this question, I wrote an article about this but still haven't published on medium.

[15-Sep-18 01:46 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
You should consider that cryptocurrencies are new form of private money and value transfer

[15-Sep-18 01:48 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
we are  building different products that bridge fiat and digital world: easy to use wallet, fiat gateway, card program, distributed fiat gateway...everything meets in  digital wallets (ours or 3rd party we dont actually mind)

[15-Sep-18 01:48 PM] Seko#7408
That sounds good...

[15-Sep-18 01:48 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
we want to provide the infrastructure

[15-Sep-18 01:49 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
what you asked is a very good question. Every company out there (big ones and small ones) have the ability to build a digital economy based on their products. To reward users, to create other business around their products, to build a community

[15-Sep-18 01:51 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
however companies out there are still not aware of this or still dont understand it

[15-Sep-18 01:52 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
they can create a whole economy around their business models that will make at the same time their business models grow

[15-Sep-18 01:52 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
thats what some companies are starting to do. However blockchain is still in its infancy and those who want to go too fast wont succeed

[15-Sep-18 01:53 PM] Seko#7408
Ah ok, I understand. But cryptocurrencies very volatile at the moment. If I accept crypto as a seller, instead of Fiat, then I have the problem of volatility. Why shouldn’t I take Fiat directly?

[15-Sep-18 01:53 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
for example a Shoe shop chain probably wouldnt succeed. But binance created a save-fees token and buyback program and see what happened

[15-Sep-18 01:54 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
they created a full economy that benefited users and themselves

[15-Sep-18 01:55 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
crypto has its own use cases. You know, casinos, trading online but also because crypto can be understood as a protocol by machines and fiat doesnt, thats why smart contracts are being born.

[15-Sep-18 01:56 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
as you know there are also some pegged cryptocurrencies which are interesting if you dont want to expose yourself to volatility

[15-Sep-18 01:58 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
Or why do you think most of the exchanges out there are now working with Pegged cryptos? its not legal tender, its more secure so computers can control it better. It's like dollar, but when you have dollar someone can freeze your account at any time. Pegged crypto doesnt has this problem.

Each crypto might have its use cases.

[15-Sep-18 01:58 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
In our case ( regarding to your question) its quite clear. We create a FUND with REVENUE  from our business. So underlying "value" of PGT tends to grow.

[15-Sep-18 01:59 PM] Seko#7408
Do you visualize this concept. For a better understanding graphics and videos would be helpful. Your designs are fantastic.

[15-Sep-18 02:00 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
then we use PGT to pay commissions, affiliations, save fees...so PGT tends to grow in value and circulate. Nobody can say its worthless because we will always be able to calculate the exact value of each PGT (the amounts in the FUND). However market might give extra value if it thinks PGT is worth it

[15-Sep-18 02:00 PM] Seko#7408
And it’s helpful for the community, of you write an article on Medium about the use-case.

[15-Sep-18 02:00 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
Yes, will try thanks for the suggestion

[15-Sep-18 05:53 PM] jspook16#3059
So is PGT required for these services? Meaning I have to go from one crypto currency to PGT to Fiat? Or can I go directly?

[15-Sep-18 07:46 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I tried to calculate the rate base of .35 usd /pgt . 1 kmd = 3 pgt

[15-Sep-18 07:46 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
But the app only shows 1kmd =2.76pgt

[15-Sep-18 09:21 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
hey @Gordon Komodo checked 1/0.35 = 2.8571, its solved, there had been a typo and was set 2.5871

[15-Sep-18 09:23 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
@jspook16 of course you can go directly 😃  PGT will be used to pay fees, comissions, affiliations. Will make an article about that as @Seko commented

[15-Sep-18 11:53 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275

Hi, I've been testing the app, funding my KMD address and also the sale page. I always start small and so far I can't input less than 500KMD into the page, is that the minimum buy order?

[16-Sep-18 01:34 PM] bishop#9773
@Dyeles  $500 is the minimum buy order, so with KMD around $1/coin, that's why
