Projects within the 'ecosystem projects' category in our Discord are not endorsed by Komodo. These projects have adopted or are using Komodo's technology. As our ecosystem is decentralized and there are many interesting projects we create a channel when requested because this helps give an overview of everything that's happening, however, you should do your own research and judge the project on it's own merits.
