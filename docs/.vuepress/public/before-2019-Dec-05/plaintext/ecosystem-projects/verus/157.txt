[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Oink Site looks great!

[05-May-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It's still not ready yet....

[05-May-19 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I know it is already on there but I didn't see the words white paper for those who look specifically for that. Not sure it matters and I see you've said it isnt finished but it looks great, really neat!

[05-May-19 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Any cool ideas you'd like to see or implement?

[05-May-19 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm waiting on feedback from some people now, but I'll add your point of the whitepaper to my 'improvement' list

[05-May-19 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'ld like a developement news-feed on the main page... More extensive that the milestones there is now.

[05-May-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Especcially since we're working towards PBaaS now

[05-May-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I like it a lot. That's insignificant anyway, I just know sometimes people ask

[05-May-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That^^^ is a great idea!

[05-May-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Gnite all. ThinkI have had enough

[05-May-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A live newsfeed would be good for getting things out right away in an official capacity outside of discord

[05-May-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Night  @Badfish!

[05-May-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm not really a 'content' guy. Making up what should or should not be in that section is not really my forte

[05-May-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm not far behind

[05-May-19 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> TripleX (Claudio)Today at 2:00 PM
We are facing an issue with deposits, working on it to get it solved asap.

[05-May-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> hmm sorry about the everyone tag

[05-May-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> DigitalPrice.org deposits are not functioning as we're used to, right now. Deposits do not register in *My balance* page.
The (tiny) deposit in BTC I did this morning and monitored via Blockchain Explorer, never registered and was transferred away to an address unknown to me, without the transaction showing in *My Balance* page.
For safety reasons: **do NOT deposit on DIGITALPRICE.ORG until further notice.**

[05-May-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> This issue has been reported to DP

[05-May-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-May-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I don't know why they never post updates on the site itself but they usually keep the discord updated

[05-May-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just received email: they are working on it...

[05-May-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Anything about the reason?

[05-May-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Nope, nothing

[05-May-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well, let's hope it's just a glitch in the code then ....

[05-May-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed. My message above falls into the category: better safe than sorry

[07-May-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aikida3k> So mining this coin is mainly for newer CPUs.  I took a look at the spreadsheet and didn't see any of the Xeon X series CPUs benchmarked that you can buy in  refurbished servers.  I tried a dual processor hex core Xeon X5680 at 3.3 GHz.  At 2 threads per each core, mining with 24 total threads, it underperformed AWS instance Xeon Platinum 8175Ms at 2.5 GHz and Xeon E5-2686 at 2.3 GHz.  The AWS instances do about 2 MH/s with 4 threads; the X5680 does about 750 KH/s on 24 threads.

[07-May-19 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> interesting https://www.apnews.com/7e78189c21ce4a7cb7cb73432705c3ca
This is why when I spoke with Josh Beneloh about Verus, his fundamental issue was that we were using a public blockchain, which boiled down to him wanting a central authority to control vs. decentralized in my understanding. The big difference here is that, but if you believe in centralization, I suspect they have a solution in that context that is better that what people use today for elections. IMO, we should use this news to start a conversation, especially as PBaaS is entering testing. Thoughts?

[07-May-19 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Im missing the point of why it needs to be centralized?

[07-May-19 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> so they can control the votes

[07-May-19 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I mean if its open source, there is still one governing body over it

[07-May-19 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> @ph03nix  exactly

[07-May-19 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-May-19 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Can we find out who it is they are in talks with by chance?üòö 
Perhaps offer a more voter friendly decentralized option?

[07-May-19 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I see they do have the hardware thing going for them but I can also see that being a potential point of weakness depending on how it is done

[07-May-19 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @ph03nix wouldn't call that an accurate comparison in this particular situation but I dont want to detract from this or fill the page as that link could be a good topic for discussion so if you want to discuss with me in #off-topic I'm down. No offense meant of course üôÇ

[07-May-19 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> definitely off topic, i don't like to engage in politics

[07-May-19 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> IMO this is Microsofts strategy trying to get into a new global market using their giant marketing machine, before any other entity get the chance to establish a customer base in those markets.

[07-May-19 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Think so too  @Oink. Luckily, for all Microsoft's pull, I  like to think that won't be enough to counteract public opinion or natural selection when Verus rolls out a superior option that is for/by the people

[07-May-19 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Working on a Tweet now... counteract the MS view and hitching a ride  on their twitter feed for maximum exposure...üòá

[07-May-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I had actually spoken to the person probably most technically involved from Microsoft, Josh Beneloh, when we were writing the proof of power paper. Generally, I believe this validates the importance of these applications for people and when it is available, which it isn't yet, will offer a set of open-source tools for development that can be used to make and run non-blockchain, centralized elections that employ zero knowledge privacy in some way and are auditable cryptographically. I think in this case, we need to consider that decentralized public polling and elections is one of the important applications we want to enable with PBaaS, and not only does Verus have technology to make that capability confidential, verifiable, and transparent, it will be available to everyone with Verus to use and secured by the voters themselves, which is why that is part of our vision. I think the best outcome would really be to start a real discussion about centralized, expensive solutions vs. decentralized solutions by and for the people.

[07-May-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I am going to quote this!

[07-May-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> maybe how it is now üòÉ, or now üòâ

[07-May-19 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think the focus on public versus centralized and community vs commercially developed are the main discussion points. Not to mention that apparently (IMO) MS considers PBaaS enough of a competitor to make press releases about their system... Which is basically a compliment to the work done here.

[07-May-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I wouldn't credit their concern as the reason. they usually do things for different reasons. in this case, i honestly think it's part of being connected to the DARPA contract work through their research group

[07-May-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I agree on that, but in order to get a public discussion about it outside our discord, I will put that consideration in the tweet.

[07-May-19 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Crazy that DARPA is involved but then again it shows it's something the govt knows is important. Also makes me a bit weary or that after they wouldn't also want at least some element of control

[07-May-19 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Why would you trust a democratic tool, developed by a **Defense** Advanced Research Project Agency?

[07-May-19 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Since it's centralized, the public doesn't control it, therefore it cannot be considered a democratic tool in its core.

[07-May-19 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Exactly! ^^^
