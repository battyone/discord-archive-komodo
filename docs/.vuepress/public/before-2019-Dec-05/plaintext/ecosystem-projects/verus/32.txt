[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @xRobeSx that's correct. Since the rollout of the pools happened as we were upgrading from 0.3.11, which had been causing people to lag and sometimes fork a little, I believe a fork/reorg happened during that combined upgrade and hash power reallocation that didn't resolve as automatically as it should have. We have a strong main chain, but there seem to be some people on a fork left over from that. I just want to make sure everyone stays productive on the main chain, which is the reason for my announce. If my theory is correct, we basically hit a perfect storm and are still fine, but through an unlikely combination of events, I have figured out how to make the chain completely immune to what may have happened going forward.

[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Sorry, what‚Äôs staking?

[17-Aug-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> @jimboscott  how do we set up the second address?

[17-Aug-18 02:10 PM] Mische#6695
is there a noob-guide to mine verus? I've never mined anything and like to try it to get it working but I have no idea where to start

[17-Aug-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @Mische There is an explanation on the FAQ, it's really simple/straight forward.

[17-Aug-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @ChrisC30a Proof of Stake (PoS) is a distributed consensus mechanism that a person can mine or validate blocks according to how many coins he or she holds. Holding coins on your wallet for that purpouse is what is called staking. There is a lot of info on the internet about it, that is prob enough for you to start üòÉ

[17-Aug-18 02:49 PM] Mische#6695
I can't find the FAQ on the website

[17-Aug-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @miketout `I believe this is a result of the lag issues we had in 0.3.11. It is not a required update to 0.3.12, but everyone who can upgrade, should.` some Notary nodes are saying this is incorrect, and they could not sync until they upgraded to 0.3.12, fyi. I was using 0.3.11 fine for a while, but it seems some of my miners have gone onto a fork, and current network conditions may mean that 0.3.12 is a necessary update

[17-Aug-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dukeleto Thank you. if there was any consensus change, it is not something I put in directly and would have to relate to the merge with KMD, which I understood had no consensus change. I'm looking into whether there may have been an unexpected, notary-related consensus change in the latest KMD merge.

[17-Aug-18 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> @miketout you really might want to post your latest announcement to https://www.reddit.com/r/VerusCoin

I've spent all morning upgrading miners and re-downloading the chain and I see there's still nothing mentioned on Reddit.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @runningwithbeer will do. thank you

[17-Aug-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> upvoted:)

[17-Aug-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @ChrisC30a Here are the steps...

1. Create a Z address in your wallet - this is a Private Address - NOT to be confused with a private KEY.  Create this in the 'Receive' section of the wallet.
2. Now, go to the SEND section of the wallet and make a new transaction.  When you do this, you will click the button that says "Shield all recent coinbase transactions" and input your Z address in the 'send to' line.  There is no need to input the amount.  This will shield ALL unshielded coins.
3. Once that transaction has ONE confirmation, send the coins BACK to a regular Transparent address.  You will click the button that says 'Send from a private address".  Enter the amount (allow a very small portion for fees) and send the VRSC to your T address (regular transparent address).
4. Wait for 150 confirmations and those coins will be staking.

correct me if I'm wrong, downloading agama v0.3.12-beta, start VRSC in native, wait till synced, and starting the miner will get rewards? It's been 2 hours with: Local Mega Hash/s: 63.933
and still got nothing. Did I do something wrong?

[17-Aug-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> With that hashrate you should have a block in two weeks or something, just let it run everything is fine

[17-Aug-18 09:09 PM] CHMEX#0686
At current hashrate statisticly approx 2 months. Maybe poolmining is safer for you

[17-Aug-18 09:38 PM] Mische#6695
I got it running now for luck pool, however I got it working for Decker now, how do I change the receiving address ?

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> It took me at my longest 37 days to find a 96 coin block,
Iv been on the pools for the past 2-3 days, with my 30mh/s in nheqminer and iv got 1.15 vrsc , 
Looks like i had better odds at solo mining , i could be wrong,

[18-Aug-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Only had payouts so far from luck pool, small payments, like 0.13 every hour or so maybe a bit longer, i do know xyz pool has upped the min payout to 3 vrsc to help the network , nothing wrong with that, iv just had most of my info from luck pool

[18-Aug-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Matterbridge You did nothing wrong.  64 Mh/s is going to produce a block (on average) at a rate of about 1 per month, assuming a network hashrate of about 2400 Gh/s.

[18-Aug-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @stretcher83 Technically speaking, your odds are much better a pool mining because you WILL get something.   With 30 Mh/s, you could conceivably hit some bad luck and go 4-6 months with nothing.

[18-Aug-18 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Thats a sad fact that im truly not looking forward to, but iv decided to keep 1 pc on the luck pool , and my second pc , my fastest one , is going to stay solo mining, if it takes longer than my last block did on this machine(37 days) , then ill probably put it on the pool too,

[18-Aug-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763

Or do a getblockhash on your last block and compare with the explorer

[20-Aug-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> what block height are they on? if they are on the fork, it would seem you should be isolated. have you tried getmining info to see what the difficulty is?

[20-Aug-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if you weren't isolated, you would pick up the notarized chain. is it notarized?

[20-Aug-18 02:38 AM] jspook16#3059
Ive tried resynching twice now and I end up on the same fork

[20-Aug-18 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> somehow, you are picking up seed nodes that are still on the fork. have you added these lines to your VRSC.conf from the announce?
seednode=185.25.48.236:27485
seednode=185.25.48.236:27487
seednode=185.64.105.111:27485

seednode=185.25.48.72:27487

[20-Aug-18 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that was the different between 0.03.12 and 0.03.12a in the daemon. the presence of these nodes

[20-Aug-18 04:59 AM] jspook16#3059
I did not have those lines. I've added them and am attempting another resync.

[20-Aug-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you'll need to fresh sync. if you are in sync with the fork already, i don't know that you can easily get off

[20-Aug-18 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> start with -connect=<seednode> using the ip address of the seednode and dont have any -addnode

[20-Aug-18 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> that will force connection to just one node

[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> should the coins shielded from the wallet before sending to exchange?

[20-Aug-18 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> or we can send either shielded or unshielded??

[20-Aug-18 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> tried to send by doing both but did not arrived in exchange, 30 mins already..does it take time?

[20-Aug-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> entered block hash not found in the explorer

[20-Aug-18 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> coins gone?

[20-Aug-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> @JoeCrypto did you resolve your issue?

[20-Aug-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> if the blockhash is not in the explorer you are on a fork

[20-Aug-18 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> your coins if mined before you went on a fork are still on the mainchain

[20-Aug-18 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> is it lost?

[20-Aug-18 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> @CHMEX

[20-Aug-18 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> anything i should do?

[20-Aug-18 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> I dont know the exact details of your case but if you mined them on a fork than they are not worth anything because fork
If you mined mainchain coins and spend them on the fork they are still on the mainchain.
If you want post or send me your R address and I try to help you might need to resync your chain

[dscrdvrsc] <jr.trump> Hello everyone, I have built a website to make a little game, in order to help distribute the Verus among more users, increase the number of transactions in the Verus network, as well as favoring the adoption of Verus. I know it's not a big deal, but as I said it's a small game, the operation of the game is backed by enough Verus so that it can run smoothly for several years.
If the game is successful, I surely take out a Verus faucet so that people can get in easily and for free. If you want to take a look the link to the web is https://verusgame.webnode.es/

Thanks and I hope you like it

[20-Aug-18 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> generally speaking, sending funds to a private address to play in a raffle pool creates a completely unauditable, private process that theoretically no one would be able to verify. i appreciate the creativity of a game, but please don't send funds to a private address to be tallied in a raffle and expect to be treated fairly. I don't know @jr.trump or whether he has anything but intent to do the right thing, but basically any other way would be more transparent than this one

Unlocked funds, send to an address you generated in the final wallet. Locked funds, dumpprivkey for each address and importprivkey from cli

[21-Aug-18 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @TexWiller made a FAQ some time ago, which is in the #faq-chosen channel, along with a lot of great stuff. From the FAQ:
Q: How to consolidate multiple wallet.dat files in one?
 
Answer:
1) Edit the VRSC.conf file on each instance you have, adding the following line: exportdir=/LOCAL_PATH/ (ie /home/user/)
2) Restart verusd
3) Issue the following command (on the verus-cli): z_exportwallet FILENAME (ie z_exportwallet export_instance01)
4) Copy the generated file to the machine who host your main wallet
5) Issue the following command (on the "main" verus-cli): z_importwallet /LOCAL_PATH/FILENAME (ie /home/user/export_instance01)

[21-Aug-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you can do this on the GUI as well, but use the Settings->CLI to enter the z_exportwallet and z_importwallet commands
make sure that before you do this, you backup all of your wallet files carefully

[21-Aug-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Scrotum Tickler> where do you find the  z_exportwallet and z_importwallet commands?

[21-Aug-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you enter them as command line commands in the Settings->CLI </> section of the settings menu in the wallet. you need to select VRSC (native), then enter the command below and press the execute button. The commands would be:
z_exportwallet filename
and to import:
z_importwallet filename

[21-Aug-18 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Scrotum Tickler> Thanks Mike .......I will give it a go

[21-Aug-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jr.trump> @miketout  @ok88  I understand what you say, but keep in mind that if you sent to a transparent address everyone would see if that transaction has already been made or not , therefore there would only be 1 daily transaction and the game does not make sense.
Regarding the fee, that is indicated on the web, if you distribute 90%, then you can say it is 10%, although it is not correct because if they played 4 people or less then I would have to put remaining up to 0.5 VRSC, as indicated on the web.
Also with most of the fee, it would be to build after a faucet and other things related to Verus.
Anyway, people are free to participate or not, I do not intend to swindle anyone 0.1 VRSC, if nobody wants to play, nothing happens. I will close the web and think of another more reliable way to do it.
I hope I have clarified your doubts.
Best regards.
