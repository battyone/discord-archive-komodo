[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> And once amd miner is up , I can actually mine on cpu AND gpu ?

[09-Mar-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if your cpu isn't very weak, that is

[09-Mar-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and yes, if you have a nvidia gpu and a proper cpu, you can do both at the same time

[09-Mar-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Some i5 3800. Turbo to 4200 Karbly lake thing

[09-Mar-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but generally, the 'recent' cpus are more power efficient than GPUs on verushash2

[09-Mar-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that doesn't mean you won't be able to score a higher hashrate with a 2080 or whatnot

[09-Mar-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but it's eating a ton of power in the process

[09-Mar-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Any idea when AMD is supported ? Where can I follow ..

[09-Mar-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> I am on MAC

[09-Mar-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's being worked on

[09-Mar-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> nheqminer is available for mac

[09-Mar-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> can you just read theveruscoin website

[09-Mar-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thank you

[09-Mar-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Eg. My Ryzen 2600 does 18 GHs, my 1080ti does 5...

[09-Mar-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> GH?

[09-Mar-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> MH!

[09-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> MH indeed

[09-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Erm u misunderstood me.  I know MAC is supported.   I am finding out about AMD GPU ..

[09-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Mining other coin with 1080 and trading the revenue for VRSC

[09-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> I gave up boot camp into windows.  I installed the latest Radeon driver and it made windows 10 unbootable -.-

[09-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> AMD is not supported right now

[09-Mar-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> AMD GPUs are not supported on verushash2 yet

[09-Mar-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but chris said before he's working on it

[09-Mar-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Yap I know.  I mean where can I follow the progress..

[09-Mar-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> details on that: i dont know

[09-Mar-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> probably in #mining-dev

[09-Mar-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Ok ty !

[09-Mar-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> MAC doesnâ€™t get much love in these leading edge stuff lol.

[09-Mar-19 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> GPU isn't exactly leading edge on verus2 ðŸ˜‰

[09-Mar-19 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and: it's way better than before where we "had" to use docker or something to get a miner onto osx

[09-Mar-19 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Typical response  I get for â€œ  hi I am using an iMac .. I want to mine â€œ .. â€œ thatâ€™s like a laptop.  Donâ€™t bother â€œ

[09-Mar-19 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> LOL

[09-Mar-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's not completely useless for veruscoin

[09-Mar-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'm mining with a mbp and an air, amongst other things

[09-Mar-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> I tried a short run for vertcoin on boot camp w10.   My gpu was 83 degrees lol.   25mh

[09-Mar-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yea no

[09-Mar-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just get nheqminer for osx from the veruscoin website

[09-Mar-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ...your cpu will get hot anyways

[09-Mar-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but you don't have to fiddle around with bootcamp

[09-Mar-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @0x03  wow.  Air even????   U da star !!!     Not doubting u.. just to learn .. how do u know you are not wasting money on electricity v

[09-Mar-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i am, especially because of the country i'm living in.

[09-Mar-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> (for that matter,probably any mining is money loss here)

[09-Mar-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> So this is more like an investment where in future when the value is up?

[09-Mar-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that or ideal values

[09-Mar-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and it really depends on your power prices

[09-Mar-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but what i'm saying is the CPUs in these mac notebooks are not useless for veruscoin.

[09-Mar-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> in fact, i'm also mining with 2 core i5 cpus

[09-Mar-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> these also work

[09-Mar-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and 'make a difference'

[09-Mar-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ...2 more. thats 2 thinkpads

[09-Mar-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> one x220 and one x230

[09-Mar-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but most of us are probably waiting on ukminer.io to deliver ðŸ˜‰

[09-Mar-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> or lets say "quite some"

[09-Mar-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> most is probably ridiculously exaggerated

[09-Mar-19 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I know I am

[09-Mar-19 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> +1 from me

[09-Mar-19 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @SmeLLyArMpiTs you probably want to give #cpu-hashrate a good read and search for your cpu there

[09-Mar-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Ukminer sells the customised machines?

[09-Mar-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> an fpga

[09-Mar-19 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Ok I may get some frag here but I am really sincere to learn.  I tot the purpose of verus is to level the playing field .. if a FPGA can rack up more coins vs a modern cpu.   Then wonâ€™t it be back to square one ?

[09-Mar-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Dunno if theyâ€™re gonna release MAC s/w for it...

[09-Mar-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> they're breaking their legs off to achieve 1.5x of the best available CPU for their FPGA

[09-Mar-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and the contender, blackminer, is RIDICULOUSLY FAR from achieving their performance in terms of hash/power, but then again you can already rent the blackminer FPGAs for verus2

[09-Mar-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> so no, FPGAs won't completely fuck up anything either. somebody who wants to own a ton of FPGAs can do a comparable amount of 'damage' probably when he just buys a ton of huge CPUs

[09-Mar-19 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yea. i forgot mentioning you can already have the blackminers for verus2. and to my judgement, it didnt reshuffle the game

[09-Mar-19 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Other algoâ€™s are more profitable on the F1, so most of them stay on those.

[09-Mar-19 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> They key is $ per MH.

[09-Mar-19 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Not total hashing power

[09-Mar-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Key is $/Watt!

[09-Mar-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> mainly power consumption for our end of the world

[09-Mar-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> As anyone can go out and spend thousands and blow the average miner out he water.

[09-Mar-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yup

[09-Mar-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> (hash/watt) * power price

[09-Mar-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Yeah but for bounty

[09-Mar-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> And FPGAs disturbing the ecosystem

[09-Mar-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> If they was stupid high MH for cheap

[09-Mar-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Then they would flood the market

[09-Mar-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> And push out smaller miners

[09-Mar-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Since they keep a comparable $ per MH (not too much higher) it wouldnâ€™t kill cpu mining

[09-Mar-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yea. 1.5x is the golden ratio for now in terms of hashrate increase. and ukminer said 70w (if i'm not mistaken)

[09-Mar-19 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> this gon b gud!

[09-Mar-19 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 80w

[09-Mar-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Close close

[09-Mar-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 70MH

[09-Mar-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> got those numbers backwards ðŸ˜¢

[09-Mar-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ranma103> First 192 Block Unlocked yay

[09-Mar-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> anyways, 70mh for 80w is still a banger

[09-Mar-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ranma103> For sure keen to see how the ukminer goes

[09-Mar-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Me2, me2... canâ€™t wait...

[09-Mar-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Is it there yet?

[09-Mar-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ðŸ˜„

[09-Mar-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hin5584> Which exhaange is good for selling and buying veruscoin

[09-Mar-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hin5584> Crypto bridge or stex?

[09-Mar-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @hin5584 you may find Digital Price a bit more active than them two. But I used to use CB a lot for other crypto a while back

[09-Mar-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> hello .. trying to install the wallet...  so i choose native mode and VRSC .. it says something about missing zcash ... so i select download from veruscoin.io?

[09-Mar-19 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> you get them from within the wallet

[09-Mar-19 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> sould be an option to get the params

[09-Mar-19 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> it says select a source ..  there is . z.cash and veruscoin.io    so i chose verus

[09-Mar-19 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> default is fine

[09-Mar-19 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> oh dear.. default is z cash
