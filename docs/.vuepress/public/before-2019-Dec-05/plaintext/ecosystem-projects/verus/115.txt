[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> more stakes for mining, yes please

[15-Feb-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> suck it miners

[15-Feb-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> I think at this stage, with the impending next generation CPUs this year, especially with 7nm TSMC and 10nm Intel, CPUs will be getting a bump in efficiency.

[15-Feb-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> Oink: arent they what? idiots? well it depends üòâ

[15-Feb-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @GlorymanRTS , that's the question on how to achieve this best and i'am far especially on that matter to give advice what would be best. I only can say what's proofen doomed to fail or flawed.

[15-Feb-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Cuttlebit yes threadripper 3 üò±

[15-Feb-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Can't wait

[15-Feb-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> For what it‚Äòs worth: I‚Äôm Dutch.... even worse

[15-Feb-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> your country does have advantages

[15-Feb-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and disadvantages

[15-Feb-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> üòâ

[15-Feb-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @boxalex ur proven is just u making something up

[15-Feb-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @0x03 talk to @jbates58  in the ginasis server. He has an off grid setup.

[15-Feb-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> whereas affordable 7nm FPGAs is still at least 1.5-2 years away imo

[15-Feb-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> eh?

[15-Feb-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Gloryman you talk out of your ass all the time so you really shouldn't be telling anyone else they are making something up

[15-Feb-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i feel like you misdirected that message @Ginasis Mining Pools

[15-Feb-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i can't make sense of it

[15-Feb-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @0x03 that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt live in Holland... The disadvantages...

[15-Feb-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> @0x03 I know a couple of people who have built small second hand solar systems and used 18650's for storage for less than $1000.

[15-Feb-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Patrick ManBearPig üòò

[15-Feb-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @GlorymanRTS , that's pretty unfair. You can do your calculation right now to see how much you have to pay to accumulate let's say 500,000 VRSC

[15-Feb-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @CryptoYeti I‚Äôll love to have info on that!

[15-Feb-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @0x03 solar setup for mining?  Talk to jbates about it he runs miners completely from solar/battery no mains

[15-Feb-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Calculation and proven are not the same thing buddy  @boxalex

[15-Feb-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @Ginasis Mining Pools ahhhhhh thanks

[15-Feb-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yes, now it makes sense üòÑ

[15-Feb-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Obviously your unfounded opinions are much more proven than math, right Gloryman?

[15-Feb-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Patrick ManBearPig üòá üòä üëç

[15-Feb-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Math has been the same for thousands of years, but your opinions change with the day

[15-Feb-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> it's proven that accumulating whale stakes on POS costs several times more than than the investment on mining to achieve the same level of stake with POW.

[15-Feb-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Assuming you could get it at the current bid on DP it would cost ~$45,500 to buy 500k verus

[15-Feb-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> nope

[15-Feb-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Or about 114 of the new FPGA cards

[15-Feb-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @boxalex both affect price. Pow distribution means more users that can make the coin more valuable. Pos means that the coins go to a smaller community of whales if pushed harder.

[15-Feb-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> with every portion you buy the order book changes and price gets higher

[15-Feb-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Yeah well, you would need to be a moron to market buy half a million of coin this thinly traded

[15-Feb-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Patrick ManBearPig ‚úå

[15-Feb-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> buy daily 10,000, price gets up if you want or not

[15-Feb-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Patrick ManBearPig appreciate the compliment buddy

[15-Feb-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> excuse me what exactly is it that we're discussing right now üòÑ

[15-Feb-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> remember, it's friday dudes

[15-Feb-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @0x03 blabbing mainly buddy.

[15-Feb-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Lol

[15-Feb-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> IMHO: the biggest effect on the price of any altcoin is the fact that you have to trade it, before you can spend it... If VRSC was widely accepted the price would be stable

[15-Feb-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> that's why Verus is hybrid stake and mine üòõ

[15-Feb-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> You could probably get it from our good friend Devpro for $60,000

[15-Feb-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Oink agreed. Making tradable coin and increasing use is better.

[15-Feb-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> So instead of bickering over the (de)centralization one should focus on acceptance

[15-Feb-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> .... if anybody needs to have a website hosted or similar, i will gladly accept VRSC.

[15-Feb-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just sayin'

[15-Feb-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Good initiative!

[15-Feb-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But I think you should put offer in the tradings channel...üòá

[15-Feb-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> It's friday and I just scraped about 3kg of mold from the sink of an apartment I just moved into so I suppose I am cantankerous

[15-Feb-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> there is at least 3x more where that came from

[15-Feb-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @0x03 im not doing to bad bud , plodding along as usual üòé

[15-Feb-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Growing ‚Äòshrooms?

[15-Feb-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @stretcher83 in the house.

[15-Feb-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> original gangster

[15-Feb-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> No. I think it grew on paper labels they contractors didn't remove from the bottom of the sink

[15-Feb-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I tried to look at crypto bridge but couldnt see verus on there

[15-Feb-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> A water leak + 100% humidity = horror movie

[15-Feb-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Patrick ManBearPig very relevant to verus coin. üòÇ
