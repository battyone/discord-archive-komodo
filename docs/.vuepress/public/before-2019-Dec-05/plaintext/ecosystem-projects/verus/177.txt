[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I just randomly bought some Pasta today and paid with Verus on VerusMobile and one click-to-confirm with a QR invoice. The store owner had a number of Komodo family coins and had just updated to the Verus PC and Mobile wallet. He lost some KMD in the hack and had already gotten it back, so had nice things to say about the ecosystem and liked the wallet. He suggested that when making an invoice on Verus Mobile, if his employees could enter the amount in dollars and have the invoice convert, it would be perfect for point of sale, and also said he'd put Verus Mobile right by square on their tablets for crypto-payment. Tweet has more details.

[10-Jun-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I only know they are new, have been working hard on their release, which seems to be a new system that is fast and seems to work well, and they chose a number of coins themselves for first listing, which included Verus Coin and the others. A number of devs from different projects were asked to test and wait until they announce to announce to the broader communities. They say the first 500 signups get 0% fees. I don't really know much else about them, and I would doubt that if DP doesn't have CMC listing yet that they would have it now.

[10-Jun-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they did share this whitepaper: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/571199911731658761/587188179778666506/EN_Zyrex_Whitepaper_1.0.pdf

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> on their Discord

[10-Jun-19 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> It feels a lot like DP, in the sense that it is listing more privacy projects, and has a native coin that runs masternodes. I like it & I think it the exchange looks really good.

[10-Jun-19 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> I am thinking about writing an article on CoinMarketCap. The main reason it bothers me, is that they are treated as the main resource for cryptocurrency/exchange financial information--past & current. And they decide who gets listed & who doesn't, and they don't seem to hold true to their preferred listing requirements.

For example, they have Tron Classic listed, #1212.
It has $177 daily vol. and 465B tokens. 

CMC likes to see $10k daily volume, from potential listings. But most of the upper half, #1000-#2000, don't meet that one requirements. However, a project like Verus has yet to be listed. It's bs.

[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> confusingly (cause ZEX renamed to ZEXO) there's another token in the list called ZEXO, with a different logo. i am activating the right token right?

[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> ponderously long waiting time

[10-Jun-19 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> @Patrick Crypto  I like using Normalized Price, to check real value... Maybe you know it already. 
Make the total supply 21M. 
Take whatever number you needed, to bring it to 21M, and apply that to the current price.

The closer the two are, the better..

[10-Jun-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I mean... crypto coins are not shares in companies. They don't produce anything. Calling number of "coins * exchange price" market capitalization like they are stocks is silly. Same as people using "ROI" as a time.

[10-Jun-19 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @gigamesh if ZEX renamed to ZEXO, I think it would be prudent to activate ZEXO in Agama...

[10-Jun-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> @gigamesh  yes use ZEXO

[10-Jun-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> @miketout I am trying to understand the relation between VERUS and Komodo- I understand that VERUS is a friendly fork of Komodo, and obviously the blockchains are mostly compatibel - but is  VERUS a  sort of main chain as Komodo chain is, and that VERUS replicates a complete Komodo-like chain hierarchy with assetchains parallel to Komodo? VERUS uses a different hashing algo? (I bought 11k VERUS for 1 BTC in the early days, so I really love see it increase again these days üòÖ but not sure if I can afford to bolster my stack)

[10-Jun-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> I am trying to understand the degree of cross chain compatibility

[10-Jun-19 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> Verus-Agama 0.6 saved a lot of peoples assets.. I was the one bitching around here about the naming overlap a cpl months ago, but the functioinal overlap is very beneficial obviously.
Oth, it wouldn't be too surprising if Komodo would discontinue Agama entirely, come to think of it

[10-Jun-19 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @LocoMB, yes Verus is friendly fork of Komodo but is very much it's own project in every sense. The lead devs for the projects maintain a healthy relationship and make regular contributions to each other. It seems a few out there share a similar interest in open-source and technologically advancing crypto for the benefit of the entire field, recognizing that rising tides lifts all ships, versus the more closed off I, me, mine, self-serving model that *some* of us may already be familiar with.

[10-Jun-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Though, that doesn't help you to understand the degree of cross chain compatibility on a more technical level, just wanted to clear up that they were in fact both very unique, stand alone projects that share a similar code base and in which the developers maintain a healthy relationship centered on general blockchain growth for a better over all future.

[10-Jun-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> oh I think I'll just dig around some more in the tech resources...

[10-Jun-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> iirc Verus is completely compatible with the crosschain capabilities that Komodo has. Verus has extended those capabilities quit a lot in preparation of PBaaS release.

[10-Jun-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> Baas is a buzzword that many projects have been riding for quite some time, but somehow most of them don't seem to be going anywhere really, except grabbing huge pots of ICO money (thinking of ARDOR, HEAT, STRATIS etcetc) ...  Komodo/Verus seem to be overhauling these shiny spit-n-polish business types by leaps and bounds

[10-Jun-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think the easiest way to seperate the 'grab and exit' projects from the serious projects is having a look at ICO, premine, marketing and presence  at exchanges.
It's a bold statement, I know that. Some of the projects that I just weeded out with that statement will have solid tech, will have good intentions and are here to stay and make a difference.
The dedication that this community and particularly our developers  have to realizing the Verus vision is hard to compare to other communities outside the Komodo ecosystem. I think that sets us apart from other projects promoting BaaS.
In addition to that: most BaaS chains are depending on a centralized environment, controlled by an entity with the intention to make profit... Verus is quite the opposite.

[10-Jun-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> @Patrick Crypto Well you have to find some method to price alts.

[10-Jun-19 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Jun-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Jun-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Jun-19 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> They should list 1-10,000...

[10-Jun-19 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> And Verus should be listed on there, no doubt.

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> About the only thing I ever look at on CMC is the converter to check arbitrage. I've never cared about supply. I find coingecko to list smaller exchanges which is the only other reason I ever look at sites like that

[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> If you want to find a list of new projects being announced, you go to one place, Bitcointalk.
Everyone does it & it makes it very fair.

If I wanted to find the price of a 1989 Troy Aikman rookie card, I'd go buy a Becket Price Guide, or look online, at their site.

If I want to find out the price of a cryptocurrency, i might have to look at 3 places. And then I wonder, but why wouldn't it be on the other one? Is there an issue?

[10-Jun-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well I always felt max supply was a somewhat relevant way to judge scarcity. A $0.10 coin with 21mil max supply has an apparent greater potential  for growth than a $0.10 coin with a 21bil max supply. Of course there are many other factors too and most terms are relative to something else so no one true easy gauge but put all those little bits of info together and hopefully we can make a somewhat educated guess.

[10-Jun-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gamer278> I saw a post of someone paying for something with verus. If Verus is going to be used to pay for things wouldn't the price have to go way up in the future with a max supply of 84 mil?  There wouldn't be enough to go around if it didn't correct?

[10-Jun-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Well, you've got decimals.

[10-Jun-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Jun-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> 84 mil is the same as Litecoin and its at $126 now
