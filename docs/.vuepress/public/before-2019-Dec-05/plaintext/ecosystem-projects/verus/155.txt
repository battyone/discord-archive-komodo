[dscrdvrsc] <10> More buying than selling

[29-Apr-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> The thing with verus is it has natural growth (Be it slower than your usual 10000000% pumps on crap coins) it is natural and healthy

[29-Apr-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Current price is only interesting in two respects:
1) short term profit
2) staying listed at exchanges

[29-Apr-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> PBaaS is only going to help that growth

[29-Apr-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> No real price increase in 5+ months

[29-Apr-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> PBaaS will have to

[29-Apr-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> What else is left

[29-Apr-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> "will have to"

[29-Apr-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> haha

[29-Apr-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> can always tell when someone is here for the insta profits

[29-Apr-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> No no  @That_Guy8

[29-Apr-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I'm saying, what else is left, in terms of development?

[29-Apr-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Price doesn't have to do anything

[29-Apr-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> if you think Mike is going to stop there. xD

[29-Apr-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Price does what it does & that's that

[29-Apr-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Further development would be included in the White Paper, no?

[29-Apr-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Was PBaaS initially in the WP, I forget?

[29-Apr-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I feel like it wasnt

[29-Apr-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Yea

[29-Apr-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yup, further dev is in vision paper... PBaaS is only stage 2/4

[29-Apr-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> oh in the vision paper

[29-Apr-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> "Phase Four ‚Äì Integrated Machine Learning, Content, Storage"

[29-Apr-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> yummmmmyyyy

[29-Apr-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I guess it changed

[29-Apr-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Well it changed a few times
But things evolve

[29-Apr-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> By the time we‚Äôre in phase four, there‚Äôs probably more stages...

[29-Apr-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Evolution never stops

[29-Apr-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> It seems like a lot

[29-Apr-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I feel like PBaaS was the vision

[29-Apr-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Voting & running Verus chains, for businesses

[29-Apr-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Bringing something new & promoting it to businesses

[29-Apr-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I doubt that's the pinnacle of the teams abilities, or Mike's ideas. Yet, it'll be a main focus for a long while, I'd guess.

Heres another one to keep in mind as a Community Project!-

Reed's Law: "The Value of a Network Increases Dramatically When People Form Subgroups for Collaborations and Sharing"
In 1993, Robert Metcalfe noticed that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of users of the system. For example, two people with telephones can only make one connection. Five telephones can make 10 connections, and twelve telephones can make 66 connections. This is now famously known as "Metcalfe's Law" or network effect: The value of a network is proportional to n2, where n is the number of users.

[29-Apr-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> translates to "verus mirabilis" üòè

[29-Apr-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <TheBitcoins> can someone give me a roadmap of sorts to what is planned with this project. Everything I have seen so far is interesting, but im not sure i get it all

[30-Apr-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @TheBitcoins The whitepaper is a good place to get an idea but Verus is no one trick pony and so like in most cases, complex systems require complex explanations. Right now Verus is focused on PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service), basically it's a system for developers or project creators to easily start up blockchain projects in just a few clicks. Projects created this way will be fully secure against attack and endowed with all of the technical capabilities of the parent chain (Verus). In conjunction with this already major achievement, Verus is now capable (in testnet for now) of merge mining (mining up to 15 projects all at the same time with the same hardware you already have and at no additional energy expenditure).
This is now but they also aim to tackle the deep seated flaws in the voting/polling and identity sectors. I'm sure if you stick around here a while you'll start to wonder what it might be that Verus CAN'T do. üòâ

[dscrdvrsc] <When 350? (350club)> Why is there a PQRST wave in the middle of the V?  Is this for health care?

[30-Apr-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @When 350? (350club) - no, it's not for healthcare, specifically. It's a wide ranging project that can potentially encompass just about any industry that stands to benefit from blockchain technology- including healthcare.

[30-Apr-19 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <michaeltoutjr> @When 350? (350club) The heartbeat in the logo is meant to represent the human aspect of our goals. We want to emphasize that although we focus on creating big, multi-chain systems to scale and solve many real-world problems, we are still a community, and our systems are built by humans, to help humans achieve their goals while maintaining integrity. (rather than say, built by a centralized organization for profit)

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Hollowman9000 Maybe I missed it but I don't see a source that backs up his claims. Do you know where this is coming from? Something to do with their implementation? Most importantly, I don't think this has anything to do with Verus other than the loose zcash connection but maybe I'm missing something.

[dscrdvrsc] <TheBitcoins> @Godballz thanks for the write up yesterday.. Can someone tell me whats happening with the voting system here? I thought that was the original plan.

[01-May-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @silverlining could you put up some info on your website how this works. I would not really be prepared to create an account using my email address, just to see if it‚Äôs something I would be interested in.
The link suggest you can mine something called ‚Äòwebcoin‚Äô, so you would loose lots of potential miners.

[01-May-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @TheBitcoins  The voting system is the next step and needs PBaaS to be implemented.
