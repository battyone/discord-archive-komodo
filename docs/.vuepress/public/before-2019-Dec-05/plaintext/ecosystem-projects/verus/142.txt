[dscrdvrsc] <GM> I see.
So maybe I should just come back and see if there is active development on the project, in 6 months.

[14-Apr-19 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> more like in a month

[14-Apr-19 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if it will be that long.

[14-Apr-19 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> No point in buying, if PBaaS, is one of the last major tech things done on here, and there is no price reaction to it.

[14-Apr-19 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> I'm afraid therr are just too many sellers out there.

[14-Apr-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> whats the point of your fudding?

[14-Apr-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> Too many Verus that need to be sold.

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> You have some valid points, but you're mostly fudding, coz' you don't know the future of the trading volume. You're only guessing that there won't be any more buyers.

[14-Apr-19 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @GM PBaaS is not 6 months away, and there are people committed to supporting it. at the same time, you are right about some things... 1) devs have been putting all of our energy into doing it rather than talking about it, and 2) we'd love to have some people help with marketing.
At the same time, there are people who want to develop with it, and we expect it to be quite useful to developers and non-developers who want to use blockchains in their applications, start their own projects, or with the reserve features, their own liquid currencies.
Yes, people have been saying wait for PBaaS, but you didn't have to to see a lot of advances already. It has not been quite a year since mainnet, and for the scale of what it is, that is extremely fast. You won't have to wait long at all at this point. I think I'll go to bed tonight without a PBaaS test chain up, but test chains are imminent. It won't be too long from test chains to having fully functional, robust PBaaS, and I fully expect people to be using it.

[14-Apr-19 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Oh, really. Nice there too, been to Berlin and Leipzig - great cities 😃

[14-Apr-19 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> Everything takes time.

[14-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Deleted User  Development is not done on Twitter or Reddit. I've seen several projects with constant big announcements about  great ideas and so-called developments in process, and how soon it's expected to be released - and not few of them are in these "develpment process" since many months, if not years. 
Thus I think it's wise not to make big announcements before you can provide anything substantial. Because if you don't, neither the project nor the community would benefit, if not even damage is done .

[14-Apr-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I don't think @GM was fudding- I've raised many of the same concerns myself in this discord. If anyone looks at an order book as thin as what he describes on DP and doesn't think that's something to at least be potentially concerned about, they're not paying attention. At the same time, I see Mike's response to his concerns, and I understand it's a tough balancing act. We really all shd be doing more to market, at least once PBaaS is up and running. I also get the other side that says we don't want an influx of attention and interest before Verus is ready for Primetime, as that cld be a disaster in itself...I personally am waiting for PBaaS to be spun up and running before I start pounding the marketing pavement, so to speak. Also, I think it would be helpful if we cld get some direction, however minimal from the team. If @miketout said hey guys- wait till after PBaaS, then go wild, or it doesn't matter- call it out from the rooftops whenever and wherever, however- that'd be another form of direction. I've been thinking of talking to Chico Crypto about our community, but tbh, I'm not sure what to do- wd the community and Mike appreciate it (Chico isn't everyone's cup of tea)? If we do get an influx of interest right now, wd it be like calling in new guests to the dinner table before the feast is ready? I'm truly unsure of our direction here. And these blind accusations of FUD! whenever someone raises a legitimate question don't really help all that much, I don't think.  I love this project and this community, and I'm here for the long haul. I just think these are valid points.

[14-Apr-19 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It did start with a legitimate concern indeed, but during the conversation a couple of points started to look suspiciously like fudding:
- Although he entered this server moments before he raised his concerns, he didn’t shy from calling the entire community ‘relaxed’, while the devs work like crazy. That assessment looks not to be based on facts.
- He claims he can find experts on this server, but doesn’t want to waste his time.
- when he’s friendly asked to stop, he indicates that it’s not an admin asking, so why should he...

I call that fudding...

[14-Apr-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> From what I remember, mike said in one of his earlier announcement that the concept of PBaaS is better explained if people can actually see working examples of what is possible. (Must be over a month or so ago)
In my head I can see lots of possibilities of what can be done with PBaaS, but explaining those visions to others is a different story (at least for me).
I agree (as you already know) that we need marketing, but since it is not my field of expertise, I can but follow.
I disagree however that it is mike that has to say when to start: he is the prime developer, visionary and his opinion in this bares much weight, ultimately it’s the communities decision.

[14-Apr-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Though I don't think we should hurry. Haste makes waste,  and this project is ment to be something for the future.

[14-Apr-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> True.. personally I think that all the people complaining about the low VRSC price are just looking for a quick profit, not staying for the long haul.

[14-Apr-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jintaa @Oink @Deleted User @0x03 @Thoskk and all... thanks for your caring about the project and discussion. in fact, I have gotten the first PBaaS chain "up" and am now working through issues. "Up" is in quotes because it is not quite self sustaining yet. We are well on the way, and though I am still going to be heads down for a few more weeks as we bring in all the features, the hardest part of PBaaS is in place. I think it would be a good thing for people to feel fine spreading the word at this point. I just thought it might be harder to be successful at and have less impact before everyone is armed with details of how PBaaS works, which is coming soon. Letting people know about what we're doing is great, but we will be able to arm you with solid information on a new, multi-chain, decentralized PBaaS protocol very soon. Verus PBaaS will allow anyone to launch a chain through the Verus network that includes leveraging all of the Verus network's infrastructure, miners, and stakers, steps for pre-sale on the chain, and making merge mining, staking, and notarization of your chain/project/application an offer in both Verus and its native currency for the participation of the entire Verus network, now and in the future.

[14-Apr-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I'm starting to see the full scope of it ... although I think I have to wait for more details before I can participate in discussions 😉

[14-Apr-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I couldn’t resist putting this on twitter....

[14-Apr-19 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Apr-19 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> wohoo, need to get more VRSC before it spreads ... 😄

[14-Apr-19 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Apr-19 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I raised the point of thin order books whenever new exchanges were discussed. Hopefully at this point there will be no more low tier low volume exchanges cconsidered

[15-Apr-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wookie> wth happened to buy support on digitalprice?

[15-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Out of funds for now.. 😒 As soon I have any to spare I’ll set up some strategic buy orders.
Zergpool has VRSC support, but pays in BTC, so lots of VRSC flooding the market

[15-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not to mention 52hash....

[15-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <vrsc.52hash.com> 🤔

[15-Apr-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No hard feelings, 52hash, but being the largest pool, there will be some big miners wanting to cash in to pay the electricity bills

[15-Apr-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wookie> getting dumped hard. oh well

[15-Apr-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <1,3> is  vrsc asic/fpga resistant?  why is there a fgpa channel?

[15-Apr-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Verus is ASIC resistant. FPGA's can run on the network, but a FPGA-miner that is affordable and runs at comparable H/W ratio haven't hit the market (yet).

[15-Apr-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <1,3> fpgas will still have huge advanges over gpus  if it can hit the market.  so there's still risk there that can not be predicted now?  do you think this is something that's very hard to solve?

[15-Apr-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Currently there are probably no/not many fpgas on verus, I believe.

[15-Apr-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @1,3 nothing needs solving. We want equalization of different hardware bro, including fpgas.

[15-Apr-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> VerusHash  uses specific algorithms (vcmul) which are built into modern CPU's. FPGAs can do that work, but not yet at a rate where they are comparable to the efficiency of a modern CPU

[15-Apr-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Of coarse a 600Watt FPGA will run a better MH/s than a 65W Ryzen 2600...

[15-Apr-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Oink what do you mean FPGA is not comparable to the efficiency of a CPU?

[15-Apr-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I believe that FPGA are already doing better MH per watt than any CPU can do...

[15-Apr-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <1,3> i dont know much fpgas,  but what i remember  it is just a slower version of  'asic' that are more flexible.  so no matter what algorithms are being used ,  fpga can adapt,  right?   and  how easy and how long that is?

[15-Apr-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @That_Guy8 that's what  @Oink is saying. Fpgas are bettwr

[15-Apr-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @GlorymanRTS " but a FPGA-miner that is affordable and runs at comparable H/W ratio haven't hit the market (yet)."

[15-Apr-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> he is saying the exact opposite

[15-Apr-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @That_Guy8 oh. He means the black miner f1 I think he owns one.

[15-Apr-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I think he means in terms of investment. Maybe mis wrote a bit.

[15-Apr-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @1,3 yes fpgas can adapt and create bitstreams buddy.

[15-Apr-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Well its bad info, Go get the price in hardware it would take to get the over 250MHs from standard PC hardware. then compare that to the 2k USD for the F1

[15-Apr-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I feel like the F1 would be the more cost effective and better MH per watt

[15-Apr-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @That_Guy8 yeah, but cpus don't require an initial investment if u already have one. Also, to buy a better one is more versatile and holds its price better than an fpga. Also, anyone who buys a f1  fpga could just mine a coin that gains 50% more profit than verus. So, I think what he is saying is reasonable.

[15-Apr-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @1,3 if it were easy, they would be on the market, I presume. How long it’ll take before they hit the market? Could be next week, could take a while

[15-Apr-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <1,3> it allow cpu gpu fpga at the same time.    it seems this way you always have to worry    about  someone creating a more efficient fpga  someday?  it's not clear,  why didnt verus choose to be a asic mined coin,   that seems to be a better option to me. but i don know.

[15-Apr-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I’m using the info on reported speeds in hashrate channels. Probably F1 has updated by now, but no new figures in the hashrate channels.

[15-Apr-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think if the asic owners want an easy mineable coin for asic, they should create one themselves. Verushash was created with decentralization in mind. CPU’s are well distributed, asic’s aren’t.

[15-Apr-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <1,3> i see!

[15-Apr-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That is why FPGA’s are not necessarily bad, if they can be bought at reasonable prices. It helps distribution. If they are expensive, they’ll promote centralization.

[15-Apr-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> The aim of verus algo was to be proportional. Aiming to have the cost of hardware vs hashing power be fairly even across the board

[15-Apr-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <1,3> i guess that's not easy. a lot of coins try to be asic resistant.

[15-Apr-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Future will tell if we really are resistant...

[15-Apr-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @GlorymanRTS unfortunately I don’t own a F1... $2000 is out the question for a hardware investment for me and I won’t take out loans for hobby equipment...

[15-Apr-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Oink oh i see. thanks for clarifying
