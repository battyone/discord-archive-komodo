[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> (As long as the TV stays functional, that is...)

[22-Apr-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I thought Verus was built to disable IoT as far as possible?

[22-Apr-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Now you mention it: I did read something about that somewhere...

[22-Apr-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But I don't know if it was something from Verus itself, or somebody interpreting it as such

[22-Apr-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Think I even saw it in the white paper... but not totally sure

[22-Apr-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Mining with your Tesla.. How decentralized can you get.... Whoehahaha

[22-Apr-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Docker image for ccminer 3.4 is now available https://hub.docker.com/r/crupti/verushash-ccminer-cuda .

[22-Apr-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You stepped away from using nheqminer in your docker, Crupti?

[22-Apr-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or are you still maintaining that too?

[22-Apr-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> If you have NVidia Docker 2 and nvidia drivers on your host OS already it should be as simple as
**$ docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm crupti/verushash-ccminer-cuda -a verus -o stratum+tcp://na.luckpool.net:3957 -u VERUS_T_ADDRESS.WORKER**
to download and run ccminer 3.4.

[22-Apr-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink I still support nheqminer too, this is a seperate Docker image.

[22-Apr-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> OK, then I'll need to update some links here....

[22-Apr-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> guess I need to retire early to be able getting deeper into these things ðŸ˜‰

[22-Apr-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hahahaha

[22-Apr-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I did....

[22-Apr-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yeah, but I'd still need some income, though ^^

[22-Apr-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Luckily that's been taken care of at my end... (Not entirely voluntary, but OK)

[22-Apr-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I stopped playing lotto and such, so I'm afraid I'll have to work a little longer ðŸ˜‰

[22-Apr-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> not that I woudln't enjoy my job, it's just none of those jobs that make you rich in the financial way

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Docker is OS portable, so itÂ´s not "Linux Docker" - just Docker. You can use Windows or even UNIX has a host OS as long as you have Docker on it.

[22-Apr-19 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Tnx for the info. Didn't know that. I'll change it. (I'll start thinking on the icon to use... LOL)

[22-Apr-19 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Even though the Docker container internally runs Linux, your host OS can be whatever.

[22-Apr-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> ThatÂ´s kind of the point and what's neat with Docker, in addition to better security and scalability etc.

[22-Apr-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> TBH, I hadn't heard of *Docker* before I got into the Verus community.

[22-Apr-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink ItÂ´s basically virtualization software, taken to a new level.

[22-Apr-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Docker runs an OS inside your OS, and in our case, runs the ccminer in the virtualized OS - which also make it more secure as itÂ´s a seperate OS from your physical host OS (which can be whatever, Win, Linux, UNIX)

[22-Apr-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> As soon as I got some time i'll read up on it... Virtualization is always fun

[22-Apr-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Right now I'm using Vbox, so Docker would be an alternative...

[22-Apr-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Maybe even converting my Vbox with Local VerusPool into Docker...

[22-Apr-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Virtual machines, like VMWare, Hyper-V, VirtualBox, etc, usually have horrible miner performance - with Docker I get canÂ´t find any significant performance degregation.

[22-Apr-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'll read up on it, at some point in the future. No too far away, I hope

[22-Apr-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> hmmmm. got a demo shop in VBOX too, for testing Veruspay. The VHD performance is terrible (The website runs on database, common problem in virtualization)... Would that improve too, or mainly the CPU performance?

[22-Apr-19 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Docker is espesially handy when it comes to mining, I mine multiple coins which miner software all require different OSÂ´s and OS versions, different libraries and library versions, different compilers and compiler versions, etc, without Docker you would have to install new OS and software each time your want to switch coins, with Docker itÂ´s just a single command to switch the coin I want to mine. In addition, I donÂ´t always trust the code of the mining software and Docker runs in itÂ´s own OS which is more secure than running the miner directly from your host OS - with Docker any potential hacker would have to break out of the Docker OS to get access to your host OS, which is hard to do.

[22-Apr-19 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink You use Docker Volumes instead of VHDÂ´s. Their performance depends on the platform implementation.

[22-Apr-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'll definately have some reading to do... and if my gut doesn't deceive me: some reconfiguring, transplanting, migrating and whatnot...

[22-Apr-19 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I wish this all wouldn't always take so much time to get into... I'm already spending a good part of my leisure time for all of this, and it doesn't seem to get less with each new development ðŸ˜«

[22-Apr-19 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> so much for "computers make it all easier" ... dafagg they do ...

[22-Apr-19 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Well, if it aint broke, don't fix it....

[22-Apr-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> different thing

[22-Apr-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> it's more about what you have to do to get it halfways safe and secure

[22-Apr-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The main reason I'm going to look at docker is to see if I can get that verusPay test site running smoother...

[22-Apr-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yes, Docker sounds great, just I'm so not motivated to setup another thing on top of all others again...

[22-Apr-19 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But I agree, every new technology is a steep learning curve, eating away time

[22-Apr-19 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> absolutely

[22-Apr-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The LAN pool runs fine on VBox, so i"ld leave that alone, if I were you. (Unless I 'transplant' it into Docker before you have yours up)

[22-Apr-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> if people had to spend the same time with learning about new things in their cars that is necessary to get your IT safe and sound (as far as possible), you wouldn't see a tenth of the new cars on the streets that you currently can see.

[22-Apr-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hahahaha. So very true

[22-Apr-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well, setting up my other machine is more tricky than I thought ... having driver issues for the GPU. At the moment it only works correctly when I'm logged in from remote ðŸ˜¬

[22-Apr-19 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Thatâ€™s annoying.... but at least you still have access... Iâ€™ve experienced complete lockouts, only to be solved by taking out the offending hardware.... (LOOOOOOONG time ago)

[22-Apr-19 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well, that times have passed for me when NT technology came up for windows, luckily. Had this a few times with Win95 and ME, though...  install, restart ... nothing.

[22-Apr-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> but it was comparably easy to get it fixed.

[22-Apr-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I used to have an ancient PCI VGA card for those cases....

[22-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> VLB cards were a menace, without proper drivers...

[22-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> all hardware was ðŸ¤£

[22-Apr-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink ItÂ´s pretty simple to learn Docker. The Dockerfile describes what should be done, if you look at the ccminer Dockerfile then itÂ´s simple to understand. First the FROM command tells it to download a nvidia linux distro that has CUDA 10.1 preinstalled. The first RUN command updates the linux distro in the FROM and installs all the compilers etc - the next RUN line does all the downloading and building of the ccminer software on the linux distro specified in the FROM, then I just create a new on the linux distro in the FROM line so that you wonÂ´t have to run as root - and your basically done. Easy ðŸ˜„

[22-Apr-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I spent a week to get my Win95 laptop to run with the network of the hostel, back then...

[22-Apr-19 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I used to connect CNC milking machines, controlled by DOS or WIN 311, to windows server 2003 and up....

[22-Apr-19 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well, **THAT** sounds like **FUN** haha

[22-Apr-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Telnet is your friend ðŸ¤£

[22-Apr-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> As it turned out, hardly anybody knows the tricks to get it connecting.... since modern win servers use SMB3

[22-Apr-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Couple of old floppies, Dos networking....

[22-Apr-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Disabling enforced use of smb3... voila, piece of cake

[22-Apr-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Biggest problem was usually to get the network drivers running, without hogging all base memory... emm386 couldnâ€™t be used because of the CNC controller that needed to run in real mode.

[22-Apr-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> when we set up the lab net at that time, we had to connect Win3.11, OS half ... ehm, OS/2, Linux and Unix machines in the same net ... I wasn't involved too much, but I've seen the network admin become grey haired within months ðŸ˜„

[22-Apr-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Luckily only a handful of those customers every year

[22-Apr-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Itâ€™s easy, no netbios, no netbeui, only tcp/ip...

[22-Apr-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Get 1 WINS server on the network and it all works

[22-Apr-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> just the  computer center would demand netbios

[22-Apr-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> IP conflicts over and over

[22-Apr-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> So IP management was new to the network admin.... whoehahaha

[22-Apr-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> it was just the beginning of the internet still... so, he wasn't a proper network admin, just a scientist with a more modern computer than others ðŸ˜‚

[22-Apr-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The least ignorant Computer hobby guy around...

[22-Apr-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> more or less, yes ^^

[22-Apr-19 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Iâ€™ve seen those sites... always fun to straighten things out... Most amazing solutions to non-problems youâ€™ll ever see.

[22-Apr-19 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And the â€˜IT-guyâ€™ is always pissed of, because heâ€™s no longer allowed to fool around anymore

[22-Apr-19 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> most of the labs were working on 286 PCs with 128bit graphics ... you know ... ^^

[22-Apr-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yup...basically same stuff as the CNC-machines I ran into.

[22-Apr-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Minus the graphics, of coarse

[22-Apr-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> compared to that, the 166 MHz machine running OS/2 was superfast ^^

[22-Apr-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hahahaha....

[22-Apr-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> it didn't have a Turbo button any more! Can you imagine!? ðŸ¤£

[22-Apr-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, I can....

[22-Apr-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> my first XT computer had a NEC V20 in it, running an amazing 9.56 MHZ....I had to actually use a slowdown TSR to be able to play games...

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ðŸ˜‚

[22-Apr-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yes, I can remember that times ^^

[22-Apr-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> And I still have my first computer ... Commodore SX64 .. portable... **way** ahead of the time ðŸ˜„

[22-Apr-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well, not the first, but the first portable

[22-Apr-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ah, a 'movable' computer...

[22-Apr-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> more like that, yes ðŸ˜„

[22-Apr-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[22-Apr-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> In the navy they had those cases back then. You clip the front of (Turns out to be the keyboard) and you had a 5" screen.... about 30 kilograms

[22-Apr-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
