[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> thanks Oink

[04-Jun-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You could read this article, and in your mind exchange tokens for Coins on the PBaas Chains

What Is the Bancor Protocol? - The Merkle Hash
We have seen an increased focus on digital tokens created on top of Ethereum as of late.Â Hundreds of new tokens have been brought into circulation this year alone. However, the Ethereum blockchain is not the only way to go inÂ this regard. The Bancor Protocol, for example, a...

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> ~~Other than that I'd say it's too early for a "solution" and more the possibility.~~ Wish @miketout  would go on a educational rant right about now. ðŸ˜‰

[04-Jun-19 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> if I can understand the underlying working and symphony of PBaaS, I can imagine how the end solutions may look like

[04-Jun-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Hmm, I may have underestimated the progress. Reading through search and noticing Mike is further along than that.

[04-Jun-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> I can foresee Verus blockchain names being as important as website domain names. What is to keep people from taking up all the useful names early on?

[04-Jun-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mykos> so which one you all wanna run nodes when i start my blockchain?

[04-Jun-19 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoBubbl3> Is mining with 1.000 hs good?

[04-Jun-19 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoBubbl3> 1,000*

[04-Jun-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> No, that's near impossibly bad. What are you using? Sure it's only H/s?

[04-Jun-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoBubbl3> An asus vivobook pro '17ðŸ˜‚

[04-Jun-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoBubbl3> Im new to mining

[04-Jun-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Do you have the model name of the processor?

[04-Jun-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @dakgnosis, what I like about Verus' model over permanent ones like rvn for example, people can really squat on names in the same sense, since users will be required to support their chains. Big companies may take some good names and hold on to them but they had better have a good use case (also will prevent spam and poor management of blockchain)

[04-Jun-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoBubbl3> Its an i7-7500U

[04-Jun-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Nice, gimme a sec.

[04-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Sorry, I thought I had the hashrate in my own records, but there was one entry in the common spreadsheet instead. i7-7500U should have about 1 MH/s per thread, and it has 4 threads total.
What miner are you using, @CryptoBubbl3 ?

[04-Jun-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Recommending either ccminer (cpu)<https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer/releases/tag/v3.5> or nheqminer <https://github.com/VerusCoin/nheqminer/releases/tag/0.7.2>

[04-Jun-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> Is it possible to stake from command line wallet?

[04-Jun-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Yes

[04-Jun-19 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Think it's the -mint parameter

[04-Jun-19 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoBubbl3> Im using nheqminer

[04-Jun-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> ``nheqminer -v -l poolhost:port -u YourPublicVerusCoinAddress.newuser -p x -t 4``
You might want to use less threads than total, maybe ``-t 3`` or ``-t 2`` because it's a laptop, unless you have really good cooling.

[04-Jun-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoBubbl3> Yeah, ill use 2 just in case

[04-Jun-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoBubbl3> Is there a calculator to estimate how many coins can I get?

[04-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoBubbl3> With 2.4MH

[04-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> <http://direpool.com/veruscoin/>

[04-Jun-19 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> But the network hash is way more than that site indicates, especially since the price went up today - attracting more miners.

[04-Jun-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoBubbl3> I see

[04-Jun-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoBubbl3> Thanks for everything

[04-Jun-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> K thanks. Best place for documentation and instructions for command line wallet?

[04-Jun-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @allbits just use "./verus help" and for a specific command "./verus help command", it is based on komodo-cli, but sadly you need to sign-in nowadays just to read the komodo-cli documentation.

[04-Jun-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> Yes. Understood. I'm looking for installation documentation tho

[04-Jun-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> On the Medium article it explains that you need some test Veruscoins (VRSCTEST)

Are these different from the real ones? I do have some Veruscoins that I could use.

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> whatever @zpajk  says

[04-Jun-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> lol

[04-Jun-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> PBaaS is in development on the test chain, VRSCTEST, not the same as the main chain where your regular vrsc are.

[04-Jun-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ack ^

[04-Jun-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> If you've activated VRSCTEST chain and need some VRSCTEST funds to start, just post your address and there'll be plenty of people who can send funds.

[04-Jun-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @D2D if you want to test PBaaS, I have enough VRSCTEST I can donate (They're not worth anything, because they're not tradable). Just give me your VRSCTEST address once you got the PBAAS preview of Agama running

[04-Jun-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> On the article it suggests looking  for "friendly test-net whales" : )

[04-Jun-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> To test you don't have to be a whale, but one of the PBaaS chains is called WHALECOIN...

[04-Jun-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And the good part is, If you put 1 thread onto merge mining, you'll be a testnet whale in no time

[04-Jun-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And on all chains created.

[04-Jun-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Testing is open to anybody who wants to give it a try...

[04-Jun-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Yes, just pasting what it said on the article : )
I'm ready, all synced and have a wallet address

[04-Jun-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> @Godballz I guess what I'm concerned with is more so that anyone can take up an important name and basically keep it forever, even as a dead chain. Unless you can reuse names, I could see this as an issue. Kinda like Bitcoin.com being owned by BCash

[04-Jun-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I imagined that they'd be reusable after they stopped being paid for but I have no idea, maybe that isn't doable and that is a good point  @dakgnosis

[04-Jun-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> The other concern is case sensitivity, because people can get duped into accepting verus coin, rather than Verus coin and end up ripped off (if my understanding is correct about creating blockchain names). These are little things, but preventing some of these phishing vectors is important.

[04-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Good points to think about. At first thought, I likely would have sided against case sensitivity till I read what you wrote. It would be cool if some of the code savvy types had the option to create their own unique wallets to help combat that. Seems there are a lot of ins and outs and that's only what we can see now, I can only imagine the mess of wires and hoses under the hood, most users will never see, that Mike and fellow devs had to sort to get us to here. Its reassuring to know that the project continues to grow.

[04-Jun-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I cant wait to see some of the PBaaS use cases we can't even picture yet till we see em in action. This should open up a new level of usability in blockchain tech and I truly cant wait to see how itll be used

[04-Jun-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thanks, and hopefully, it's not a mess of hoses and wires even under the hood ðŸ˜ƒ there are core protocols constructed from relatively simple and sound cryptographic principles and primitives, including the Merkle Mountain Range with the ability to prove any block and commit to its power that is maintained for every chain, including Verus in the PBaaS system. This is combined with enhanced crypto conditions that allow Komodo style custom consensus transactions to include more data that is part of the transaction and can carry parameters and have flexible destinations that include normal blockchain addresses or combinations of programmatic and normal addresses. All function is actually built over relatively simple and primitive protocols and rules, which essentially employ the same original principles of Nakamoto consensus, only applied across a many blockchain ecosystem.

[04-Jun-19 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Merge mining is achieved with a new, flexible block header format that can carry useful data about each of 15 chains in the same header space otherwise used for an Equihash solution. This also depends on sharing a hash algorithm, which is made easier with a hash algorithm that can be effectively mined on the most available hardware. On that note, @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining, the community's leading miner developer and developer of a VerusHash 2.0 ARM miner, just posted a pull request that @Asher is looking reviewing/testing now (as will I) and when validated. will enable ARM/RPi compilation and use of Verus nodes. Though I don't know if these are optimized yet for mining, it's exciting to think of inexpensive merge mining and staking chains run by a small Raspberry Pi farm working with faster merge mining cores to mine and notarize many simultaneous chains.

Zcash params are missing or incomplete:

[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> What OS?

[05-Jun-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> Yes. I installed lite mode first. Then I installed native mode. Haven't imported the keys from Lite mode yet

[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> or zcash-params

[05-Jun-19 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I believe this is because zcash moved their file location so it isn't finding one or two files to download into the params folder

[05-Jun-19 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I would imagine this might not effect native mode using regular priv key / address

[05-Jun-19 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Just the light mode wif seed method

[05-Jun-19 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> But I am not 100% sure on that

[05-Jun-19 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> They proceed to tell you to use the Komodo-cli which is where you get your native mode priv and pub keys from while using agama.

[05-Jun-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Infinit0 to get the Zcash params you launch agama select verus native mode and it should prompt to download them
