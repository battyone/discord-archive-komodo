[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> With only 10MH/s you would most likely get even one block per year now.

[27-Sep-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I have another couple of rigs, I have been in from early days so believe I do have some valise coins, how do I validate them and move them across?

[27-Sep-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> *valid coins

[27-Sep-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Make sure to backup your wallet.dat file. Then install latest wallet and resync. Then hopefully your coins from the right chain should be there. The coins from fork will be gone.

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> thats the top end of the file, new lines will be in the end of it (if thats a less, hitting shift-g should do the trick)

[27-Sep-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> When you first open agama you probably need to select activate coin first and download the files needed then after that restart agama and then choose vrsc in the native mode drop down box

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I think its called a reindex

[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Hey all. I landed on a forked chain when I first synced Agama. Not sure how that happened but when I did getmininginfo in cli it showed me this

[28-Sep-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> { "blocks": 96580, "currentblocksize": 1000, "currentblocktx": 0, "difficulty": 4986569830169.323, "errors": "", "genproclimit": 0, "localhashps": 0, "networkhashps": 1064892909935, "pooledtx": 0, "testnet": false, "chain": "main", "generate": true }

[28-Sep-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> When I did the above my wallet was synced "100%" but was only at block 96580. Do you guys think the above hashrate represents this incorrect chain or does it reflect the actual chain?

[28-Sep-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> To me it looks like its still not on the correct chain

[28-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> I did manage to sync to the correct chain, just noting that there is about 1TH still being mined in the wrong chain

[28-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Umm hopefully those coins stay on their chain where they belong ha

[28-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I imagine they'd have to

[28-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I suppose it could mean that net hash rate was that value at the time of that block hight , when the correct chain used to be at that block hight months ago, im just guessing here, i mean there carnt be too many people on there own chain nowadays giving it its own hash rate of 106489290995 , i hope not any way, i do understand though that some people turn on there miners and just leave it for long periods of time without keeping up-to date with the discord help posts or announcements,

[28-Sep-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[28-Sep-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> @JohnWestbrook on chain and see my mined coins now. So thanks for that. The explanation from @stretcher83 above may make sense, just curious how I ended up  on a chain which is way behind but *might* have a ths of mining going on.

[28-Sep-18 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JohnWestbrook> i‚Äôm not sure either, tbh how you ended up there, what version of the wallet are/were you on?

[29-Sep-18 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Same one I just synced. Just deleted everything except wallet.dat and redownload the same one

[29-Sep-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @etrnlgldnbraid I believe the #announcements section will be helpful for you - please check announcement from 07/23/2018. I assume you have just stayed on the chain that was no longer supported after halving. And for the nethash, I believe @stretcher83 is right and the value is a snapshot of nethash from last blocks of that abandoned chain üòÉ I assume that just based on the block hight you ended up on which corresponds to halving&mandatory wallet update ü§†

[29-Sep-18 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I understand many of the great technologies that comprise Verus but I was wondering about the private z address function and how it compares to whatever monero is. Are there pros and cons to each technique or (less likely) is it all the same thing as and despite it not being its use case, if need be for some reason would Verus be able to step in and fill the same role with its tech tomorrow if for some reason monero ceased to exist today? Just curious about the z address function. Of course there is so much more to this project.

[dscrdvrsc] <wrxys> A newbie question. I'm supposed to be able to find my wallet.dat file here <system drive>/Users/<user name>/AppData/Roaming/Komodo/VRSC/wallet.dat, right? But with this latest AGAMA wallet, under Komodo folder, there is nothing but a file named as"komodo.conf". So where should I find my wallet.dat file? Thanks!

[29-Sep-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> @JohnWestbrook my man ‚úäüèª

[29-Sep-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @wrxys is this the first time you have run agama wallet , if so maybe your antivirus blocked its full install and your wallet was unable to run properly and create all the other files it needs in the komodo folder

[29-Sep-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> You could check your antivirus logs to see if anything got quarantined or blocked upon instillation of agama, if it did, i would deactivate your antivirus, then redownload agama again from veruscoin.io website and let it run for a bit , like 10 - 20 mins then add exemptions for agama in your antivirus, then enable your antivirus again

[29-Sep-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Add the agama folder that you downloaded in to exemptions and the komodo folder and the agama folder located in %appdata% folder on your system
