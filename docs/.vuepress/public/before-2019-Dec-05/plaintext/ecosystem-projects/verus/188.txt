[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The community decided not to market anything until there is something to market. We can go big on selling PBaaS now, but as long as it is not implemented on main net, it'll be like selling hot air in the desert. We started to let the world know about PBaaS once it was on testnet, so people could experience it for themselves.
We are now starting to actively market Verus (K64 gaming conference in The Hague withg Micheal Tout jr for example)

[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> selling hot air on desert - I like that quote

[dscrdvrsc] <TopMix> can we do mining with the coin it self ?

[29-Jun-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã this reminds  me Cyrix. I am sure Mictoutoghni knows this. One of the best processors out there in 1990's. I was an AMD fanboy then . But Intel swept everythint through pure marketing. Cyrix is non existence now

[29-Jun-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @TopMix You mean mining outside of a mining pool? Yes, directly from the Verus Agama wallet is one way.

[29-Jun-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> @Oink he is very experienced programmer and visionary. But as for marketing. Thats another field by itself.

[29-Jun-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> I am  sure he is aware of this

[29-Jun-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Jun-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I didn't say he was a marketeer and I'm pretty sure he knows his limits. Doesn't mean he's oblivious to other fields of expertise... But hopefully that goes for all of us.

[29-Jun-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don't agree it's complaining. They're all valid arguments

[29-Jun-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Now its just about choosing sides. Both tech stands out.

[29-Jun-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But we're not talking about the tech being inferior or superior. It's executed from a different vision. Verus is for the people, by the people.

[29-Jun-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Advantage of Verus: Decentralization
Algorand: Finalty and fork proof

[29-Jun-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Lets see

[29-Jun-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Cause ultimately banking centers will enter. They will choose. Finalty vs decentralization. Both are 51% hash attack resistant

[29-Jun-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> I hope both could co exists but then comes Cardano  and Dfinity

[29-Jun-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Must I add: Algorand is for the rich.

[29-Jun-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It's not the banks that will decide this. It's a simple choice what is more important to any user of BaaS or PBaaS (I don't think individuals now). renting a chain and setting up an infrastructure to run it, or paying per notarization a chain with the complete infrastructure in place (at a lesser cost per month).
Not to mention the liquidity capabilities that will be available... I'm sure another chain will develop something similar...

[29-Jun-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Hope a pure  community project disrupts this

[29-Jun-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> And currently i feel verus needs a strong marketing advocate.

[29-Jun-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Jun-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm a small individual doing my part in a global community. I'm sure a 'small' marketeer can make a difference... Nobody is insignificant here, we all have some expertise we can utilize.

[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Lets hope the best

[29-Jun-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> just quick skimmed through the FlyClient pdf. It's long, and I'm feeling lazy. üòÅ 
So, I picked a better target, reading the Verus vision paper now. It clears a lot of things! I had only skimmed it earlier. now reading it all thoroughly.

[29-Jun-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> clears it that Verus is much about AI and Machine learning and what we see now is just the building blocks reaching to that point.

[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Decentralised Autonomous Governance system, with truly verifiable and yet privacy preserving identities, along with Decentralised Reputation system for these identities

[29-Jun-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yup, we‚Äôre barely at the beginning...

[29-Jun-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I'm at part 3.1 yet

[29-Jun-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> so, as I understand the target of Verus applications is going to be segmented and it will be useable across the cryptocurrency ecosystem just because it is specialised in the specific area more

[29-Jun-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> To be honest I tried reading the Flyclient yesterday, but didn‚Äôt get far... decided to print all 30 pages so it‚Äôs larger than my tablet and continued reading while BBQing...

[29-Jun-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I quick looked through the doc and it felt boring, so I picked something interesting to read which I hadn't fully read yet, and picked the verus papers.... üòÅ

[29-Jun-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> will get back to FlyClient later for sure

[29-Jun-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hahaha... i haven‚Äôt finished either... I want to, though.... but it‚Äôs Formula 1 weekend and I‚Äôm really into that... priorities, priorities, priorities....

[29-Jun-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> üòÅ

[29-Jun-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think the sum of the segmented applications will be far bigger than segmented chains with one application...

[29-Jun-19 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> This will have the opportunity to use functionally that may not be available on separate chains.

[29-Jun-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> agree

[29-Jun-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> just an Identity and Reputation alone is very strong thing in a decentralised application, to be used even by rest of the cryptocurrency space if it's solved properly and is cheap and efficient

[29-Jun-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> and Verus will also have applications like polls and voting which will result in both Decentralised Autonomous Governance and AI and Machine Learning based applications

[29-Jun-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> It'll be amazing for institutions to general public

[29-Jun-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed... the future bringing polls and voting in that manner is what made me decide to look further into Verus... AI and machine learning is a bigger thing, but for the general public less tangible. Took a while before it sunk in with me...

[29-Jun-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It‚Äôll open a world of new possibilities.

[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> to be fair, i tried to read the flyclient paper, but the deep math made me want a simpler solution and i didnt read (understand) all the details in the paper, just enough to know it was very complex and since miket already did MMR, i didnt plan to do anything more than try understand it a bit. superlight clients are an easy enough to understand usecase and i realized nSPV was possible and achieved the goals of flyclient

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I basically want it to be an addition to my retirement plan... So I'm thinking long-term... That's also why I smile upon folks getting all worked up on the rise or fall of BTC or any other coin...

[30-Jun-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Actually, their approach is basically the same. The only real difference is how you can trust notarizations.

[30-Jun-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> The big thing about the fly client paper is that the approach allows someone to trust an incomplete chain because the MMR-based proof of work (in Verus we do proof of power), makes it statistically impossible to present a fake chain as real, and you can then use the most work rule to select.

[30-Jun-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> At the end of that, just as with Verus cross-chain notarization, there is the merkle mountain range root that you can trust

[30-Jun-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> just as with Komodo notarization, there is a merkle of merkles of merkles that you can trust through the elected notarization process

[30-Jun-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I was thinking also that we should enable the PBaaS cross chain notarization to allow a trusted notary body or group of notaries, like the Komodo notaries, to be commissioned by a chain and earn as a notary group to more quickly cross-notarize a PBaaS chain, enabling faster confirmations than the fully decentralized notarization if the chain creators wanted to make that tradeoff
