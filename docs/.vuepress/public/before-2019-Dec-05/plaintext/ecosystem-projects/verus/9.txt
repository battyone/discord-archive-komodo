[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @patcrypto That's not uncommon. Are you running Agama or the CLI?

[28-Jun-18 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <patcrypto> Agama

[28-Jun-18 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <patcrypto> Is a mining pool used or is this individual solo efforts ?   Can you group your different miners together  into your own pool I also wonder ðŸ˜„

What do you guys do with a vps

[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> How can 3 computer on 1 LAN

[29-Jun-18 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> Mine one wallet??

[29-Jun-18 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> Copy wallet ??

[29-Jun-18 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Norain You can copy a wallet between the computers, but be aware that after a time they may generate new addresses that aren't common between them. The safest way to do it, if you're using the CLI is to use the pubkey parameter.

[29-Jun-18 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> On linux, for instance, you would start verusd using:
./verusd -pubkey=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

[29-Jun-18 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> That will cause all blocks mined to use only the address for that public key.

[29-Jun-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Agama should have an option to copy the public key for an address. In the CLI you can do the following:
./verus getaddressesbyaccount ""              - to list your addresses
or
./verus getnewaddres                                      - to get a new address instead
then
./verus validateaddress XXXXXXXXXXXXX         - putting in the address you want the public key for
the result of that command is the public key for that address.

[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> Hello all

[29-Jun-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> Pretty new into crypto got somes questions who can help me on that?

[29-Jun-18 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Mike1900 Sure, what's up?

[29-Jun-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> Hello, just download agama

[29-Jun-18 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> am just running no install, am with ubuntu running on i5 cpu using 4 cores. Just started mining, where the coin go after the mining if i close the app or the pc?

[29-Jun-18 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> like i said am pretty noob about crypto right now don't even know all it's really work yet

[29-Jun-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> don't even know how it's really works

[29-Jun-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @englal Any issue with importing PRIV KEYS from one wallet to another that could haunt at a later date?

[29-Jun-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @jimboscott I don't believe so. Do you mean in terms of having the private keys in both wallets?

[29-Jun-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I would get rid of the old wallet .dat and archive it

[29-Jun-18 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Mike1900  The first time you run either Agama or the CLI it will create a file called wallet.dat. The location of this file differs based on your operating system. On linux this will be in ~/.komodo/VRSC

[29-Jun-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok let me check ðŸ˜ƒ

[29-Jun-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Win 10 here - it's in my appdata/roaming

[29-Jun-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Mike1900 When you receive or mine coins they will go to addresses that are recorded in the wallet file.

[29-Jun-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I have been mining on 7 machines and using the PRIV KEYs to import into one main wallet

[29-Jun-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @jimboscott I think you should be fine. I'm of the mind that it's a good idea to NEVER delete a wallet.dat file unless you're positive it is empty and hasn't made its way onto any other machines, or been mined to using pubkey, etc.

[29-Jun-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> If you hang onto that file you know that data will be secure.

[29-Jun-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I will back them up, but not have the 'outside' wallets mining to a wallet that I have already exported everything from.

[29-Jun-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Gets messy that way.

[29-Jun-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> And on import, just make sure the addresses show up, reindex if needed, and I would call their presence in the UI, be it Agama or CLI, sufficient evidence that it is safe to use that wallet and expect those addresses to be used like any others in the wallet.

[29-Jun-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> @englal  what can i do with the coins after? importing into somewhere?

[29-Jun-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The only difference is the imported transaction shows a different date - but the block dates are all the same.

[29-Jun-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> sorry everybody am really new into all that

[29-Jun-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> me too...

[29-Jun-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Everything looks right in the wallet - the 'time' just changes to when it was imported

[29-Jun-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Mike1900 There's nothing you need to do with the coins, you have them, they're yours. Anything you mine right now, and for the next month will be locked for a period ranging from about a month to two years and a month. In that time, the coins are still yours, in your wallet, but can't be spent.

[29-Jun-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Consolidated some yesterday

[29-Jun-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Mike1900 If you buy coins, are paid for bounties, or otherwise recieve unlocked coins, those will also be in that wallet file and can be transacted with.

[29-Jun-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Mike1900 How familiar are you with cryptocurrencies in general?

[29-Jun-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> am like at 5%

[29-Jun-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> have friend who push me on that tonight

[29-Jun-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> vrsc coin

[29-Jun-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> am still like i don't really understand all that... i have an another friend also how have a some bitcoin and trade

[29-Jun-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> trying to introduce myself into all that to do not miss the boat

[29-Jun-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Probably the most fundamental thing to know is that what you have in your wallet is not some piece of data that is the coins, it is the cryptographic keys that allow you to spend the coins. The coins are basically a collection of balances on the blockchain - a public ledger. Your wallet allows the software to scan the blockchain and figure out which of those balances are yours, and allows you to create a transaction that spends them, using that key, known as the private key.

[29-Jun-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Your wallet.dat file, or any private keys you export from it should be treated like cash. Anyone that ever gets access to them could potentially spend your coins. So the security of the technology is only as secure as you are able to keep that file.

[29-Jun-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> SOmeone needs to make a wallet that lets you name your wallet.dat file something like 'catsatplay.jpg'

[29-Jun-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Likewise, if you lose your wallet, either because the hard drive dies, you delete it, it becomes corrupted, etc., the coins are lost to you. They still exist on that ledger, but you no longer have the key that allows you to spend them.

[29-Jun-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> how do we backup the wallet

[29-Jun-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> just any place safe like usb key ?

[29-Jun-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Excellent question. Shut down the software, whether agama or the CLI. Once it has finished shutting down, you can just copy that wallet.dat file to somewhere safe, and after the copy is complete (it's not typically a large file) you can restart the software.

[29-Jun-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok

[29-Jun-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> You can also export the wallet in a text format that gives you more direct access to the private keys, etc., which is useful for combining wallets, etc., or as an extra safety measure on a wallet backup.

[29-Jun-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> like right now am downloading block it's mining right?

[29-Jun-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> if am not a 100% and i close the soft do i need to start form scratch?

[29-Jun-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Always make sure your wallets don't have a chance to sync to any cloud storage or anything like that which could expose them to any third parties. A thumb drive is a great way to back wallets up.

[29-Jun-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> No, it will pick up where it left off.

[29-Jun-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok

[29-Jun-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> it the mean time the wallet change during all the process?

[29-Jun-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> or only at 100%?

[29-Jun-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Also remember that new data goes into your wallet file after certain types of activity, such as creating new addresses, after very much mining, etc., so it should be backed up regularly, especially after you receive any large funds, etc.

[29-Jun-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok

[29-Jun-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Right now you're syncing the blockchain, downloading a local copy from peers and scanning it to both verify it's integrity and look for transactions that appear in your wallet. I don't know for sure, but I wouldn't expect it to be writing to the wallet during the sync.

[29-Jun-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> And you won't be able to mine until you have finished syncing the chain.

[29-Jun-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> gonna use usb then and copy and replace the wallet on it many time as needed

[29-Jun-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> You can enable mining, but it won't be able to do anything about it until it is synced up.

[29-Jun-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> syncing look long how about mining after?

[29-Jun-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Mining is basically like trying to win a lottery that happens every two minutes, and the number of tickets you have is proportional to the amount of computing power you can put into it. Sometimes you'll go days, maybe weeks without getting anything, sometimes you get lucky and get a bunch all at once sometime. It is completely random, but again, in proportion to your hash power.

[29-Jun-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok

[29-Jun-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> look like that take a lot of downloaded data?

[29-Jun-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> I like to think of it as like laying& an egg for a chicken

[29-Jun-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> You might lay an egg

[29-Jun-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> You might not

[29-Jun-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok thanks for the comparison haha... does it worth mining with an i5

[29-Jun-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> That's still unknown

[29-Jun-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Case in point  - got 10 blocks on 6/27 - got one on 6/28

[29-Jun-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> But you have no investment

[29-Jun-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> So why not

[29-Jun-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> can i broke it ok in general its safe?

[29-Jun-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Mike has concerns he might burn out his cpu

[29-Jun-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Mike1900 Whether or not it's worth it depends on what you think about the future of the currency.

[29-Jun-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok

[29-Jun-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> i mean does it worth mining with an i5 only

[29-Jun-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Mike1900 get Core Temp to monitor temps

[29-Jun-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> let me look into it

[29-Jun-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> i5 with 0.3.9 will do about 145 Mh/s

[29-Jun-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I got my only block today on my i5

[29-Jun-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok

[29-Jun-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> that's 3 cores and 6 threads?

[29-Jun-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> if i understand an block its the thing you got before mining?

[29-Jun-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> 4 cores

[29-Jun-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> then you will do better than 145

[29-Jun-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i5-3320M CPU @ 2.60GHz Ã— 4

[29-Jun-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Right - that depends on what you think the coins will be worth in the future. Is the future value you're betting on greater than the cost of the energy and the use of your computer? I'm rather optimistic, so I'm mining with everything I have, including an old 4 core laptop.

[29-Jun-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> mine is a 6 thread Coffee lake

[29-Jun-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> got the pc in gift then ... but stay the only pc i use at home under unbuntu

[29-Jun-18 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> as a gift*

[29-Jun-18 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> if i install agama on an another computer gonna got a new wallet right?, is there any way to join them ? i think you talked about that just before i join?
