[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> its just 4 x of Bitcoin

[10-Jun-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> BTC: You buy most things in satoshis, not always 1 whole BTC.

[10-Jun-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Same for Verus

[10-Jun-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It’ll go into history together with the 26BTC pizza from 2012(i believe)

[10-Jun-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> "That'll be 10 verushis"

[10-Jun-19 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> What kind of Verus price are you guys thinking can we expect once DigitalPrice and Verus get added on CMC? Do coins usually go up in value before they are added to CMC? With Verus´s current market cap we´ll be ranked #379, could we expect to bump up in rank too?

[10-Jun-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I firmly believe it will lead to more exposure overall.

[10-Jun-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> The "Recently Added" on CMC is highly monitored.

[10-Jun-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> For me, price going up or down, isn't the issue.

[10-Jun-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I think being listed among all of the other projects, on CMC, will be a positive thing all around.

[10-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Verus has held up its price, very well.
It doesn't react to BTC price swings, as do other alts.
And that is unique.

[10-Jun-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Most of the time, they are still in price discovery when they get added to CMC.  @Crupti I think you are describing more of being added onto say, Binance.
Bc all of the above that you mentioned, will happen.
But CMC is for total overall exposure. You might get new community members, that eventually bring new volume. But the idea, is to focus on full market exposure and a good community

[10-Jun-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yaheardme> maybe try comparing to pirate chain? they were recently added on to cmc

[10-Jun-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Pirate Chain was listed when they became listed on a new exchange, so they naturally got an increase

[10-Jun-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> For a few days

[10-Jun-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @10 @yaheardme @Patrick Crypto Then it will be a great if Pirate (ARRR) is anything to go by. Pirate was $0.05 May 15th, $0.09 on May 23rd (CMC listing day), peaked at $0.23 June 3rd, and is today at $0.13. That's more than +300% if you sold at the peak in just two weeks. https://coinpaprika.com/coin/arrr-pirate/

[dscrdvrsc] <10> @Crupti I know it sounds lame.
But for me, it's about recognition, as a project.

[10-Jun-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Sure, that too.

[10-Jun-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> The information should be presented for the individual, so they can decide

[10-Jun-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> But I need to eat 😄

[10-Jun-19 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> You're hungry for gainz lol

[10-Jun-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I'm not saying it's bad to want a price increase.
That's the main reason why some are here. But it'll be nice to be listed, if it happens. If it doesn't, we just continue as we are

Your consistency & your ability to put your head down & put in the daily work, is a testament to you & your Professional experience. You've done so much.

[10-Jun-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> @Crupti Pirate is basically back to where it was at the end of May before the listing. Any USD value is based only in the change of BTC/USD

[10-Jun-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> VRSC has had much higher sat prices than ARRR before

[10-Jun-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Verus hit .00009400+ btc

[10-Jun-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> ARRR is about 20% higher than it was on May 22 when the CMC listing was made. VRSC is more than 50% higher from the same day

[10-Jun-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Yeah that was 1 wick on 1 tick

[10-Jun-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> But it was trading above 5000 for a while

[10-Jun-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Verus price is very consistent

[10-Jun-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> It's pretty volatile and usually has large spreads. I make more trading than staking.

[10-Jun-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Spread is usually no more than 200 sats

[10-Jun-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> That's ~10% at current prices!

[10-Jun-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Even if that is how small it "usually" is.

[10-Jun-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Today I sold VRSC at 4915 which I bought 5 hours before at 2200

[10-Jun-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I haven't accumulated enough vrsc to feel comfortable... #postponeCMC

[10-Jun-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Someone made a mistake

[10-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> how many vrsc is enough 😄

[10-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thank you! @10 just dropping in for a minute before getting back to that.
On blockchain compatibility, the core blockchains are generally compatible in many ways that matter, but after the last upstream of Sapling tech, Komodo decided to change blocksize and max tx size in a way that I was not comfortable pushing that quickly into Verus at the time (not criticizing their decision, just was the case at the time). That led to our decision to include 2 daemons in Verus Agama, which allowed us to support all coins natively while focusing on interoperability vs equivalene. Since that time, we released further enhancements to custom consensus processing, VerusHash 2.0, the nothing at stake solution, and the newest Verus Proof of Power that was the mathematcially provable 51% hash attack resistant update, which with Komodo-notarized projects is a bit less important.

[10-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> For PBaaS, we changed the header meaningfully for merge mining, merkle mountain range proofs, and header-based proof against targeted fake-stake header attacks, another industry solution that we just haven't talked about yet. We also changed the coinbase and extra-nonce to make it so that coinbases can include an instant-spend form of output that enables PBaaS notarization competition and will also enable reserve currency conversion on chain in a way that solves front-running. This is a lot of detail on things that will also be in PBaaS and have not been written up yet, but that is a basic set of differences, which are fairly substantial. At the same time, there is compatibility in notarized, cross-chain transactions and much of the enhancements to things like CCs and even notarization benefits can be pulled upstream at some point. PBaaS itself requires some significant changes, so it may be more a Verus thing for some time, hence the primary goal is full interoperability over equivalence.

[10-Jun-19 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Header-based proof to defend against fake stake header attacks

[10-Jun-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> That is new

[10-Jun-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @LocoMB 👆

[10-Jun-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yes. in the fake stake attacks that made the rounds a while back, everyone, including Verus, stopped them at the block level and mitigated any header-based issues. This new proof in PoS headers after the PBaaS upgrade will allow headers to efficiently prove their PoS validity and be quickly invalidated as appropriate before ever being considered as a potentially valid entry.

[10-Jun-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's also nice in that it improves the ability to disprove incorrect auto-notarizations on PBaaS chains

[10-Jun-19 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So cool 😎. Here, I feel like every day there is something new to be blown away by, when it's a rarity to get that more than even once elsewhere. I think I've said this but I always think of an onion with layers on layers of tech and best is how each part comes together to form an entire self-reinforcing ecosystem where the sum is greater than its parts. I have been impressed but I continue to be blown away. 🎇

[dscrdvrsc] <Dot> oh sorry, posting this in the #cpu-hashrate chat instead

[11-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rob> Just tried to withdraw some Verus from DP, however TXID isn't in verus explorer, not sure if they ended up on a fork, may be worth not withdrawing until resolved. Waiting to hear back from DP.

[11-Jun-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @rob I just checked and my withdrawal arrived within minutes. I think it's ok.

[11-Jun-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rob> @Thoskk  ah that's good, thanks for checking! Mine did appear in my wallet briefly, but with 0 confirms, then disappeared shortly after. Will wait to hear from DP on it.

[11-Jun-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <johnyk> Hi guys? Do we have any information about verus getting added in coinmarketcap? I know that they wanted some info from digitalprice exchange have they asked something too from verus?

[11-Jun-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I've heard the rumours, but haven't heard that somebody was contacted for information.

[11-Jun-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <johnyk> they seem too slow for integration. But you have applied months ago right?

[11-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We don't meet their requirements if DP isn't listed, I'm not sure... It was discussed a lot here

[11-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You can bet on it that as soon as DP is listed, we will apply if that hasn't happened yet

[11-Jun-19 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <johnyk> Dp will be listed sooner or later. I would be happy to see vrsc too. Its a good project and so many projects out there get listed and are pure scams

[11-Jun-19 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Just a little patience ... Verus just had first anniversary, give CMC some time to mature 😉

[11-Jun-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed... but we're growing slow and steady right now.. No hypes, steadily building the foundation for a healthy future!

[11-Jun-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yes, that looks very nicely at the moment ... although it inferferes with my investment plans 😂

[11-Jun-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <johnyk> @Oink exactly verus is not a hype p$d coin. In the long run it will be just beautiful to watch

[11-Jun-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Thoskk Mine too... But I wasn't exactly Columbus when I discovered Verus

[11-Jun-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Columbus wasn't the first, though 😉

[11-Jun-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Then you can imagine how 'late' I was....

[11-Jun-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cypher> hey all quick questions how hard is it to mine and which exchanges do you recommend tag me ill be prob be in another discord 😛

[11-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <johnyk> @Cypher best exchange for volume etc is digitalprice.io

[11-Jun-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cypher> and in terms of mining is it worth just running on a desktop in the background ?

[11-Jun-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Easy to CPU mine.... got it running (on a Ryzen 2600) in the background while doing other stuff on it

[11-Jun-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cypher> i have a OCed i5 3370k not sure it can cope haha

[11-Jun-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You can check in #cpu-hashrate in the pinned spreadsheet what it can do

[11-Jun-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just leave 1 thread free for your desktop and it’ll cope

[11-Jun-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[11-Jun-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cypher> im guessing its the same for the gpu

[11-Jun-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cypher> might be worth rebuilding an old rig 😃

[11-Jun-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Better mine something more profitable with GPU and exchange for Verus (or get payed in Verus)

[11-Jun-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cypher> they are super old cards tbh just thinking power to cost efficiency

[11-Jun-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Check the GPU tab of that excel sheet I mentioned.... CPU outperforms GPU by far

[11-Jun-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <gamer278> Can anyone explain to me what the diffrence is between the sapling private address and the legacy?  I have been using the legacy to shield my coins then back to transparent address. Is that correct to stake?

[11-Jun-19 03:26 PM] goldenman#7301
Verus Agama(0.6.0-13) cannot send CHIPS to any R address.
It says "Invalid pub address" for any R-address.

[11-Jun-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @gamer278, legacy uses the older Z*c* addresses, where Sapling is the newer faster Z*s* addresses. Both work but might as well use the newer one. Much faster and lighter on resources. Haha Thanks @Oink, it doesn't extend much further! 😆
