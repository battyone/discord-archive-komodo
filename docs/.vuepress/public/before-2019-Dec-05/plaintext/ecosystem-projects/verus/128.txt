[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> It wouldn‚Äôt be at that much of an undercut to UKMiner.

[10-Mar-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yea. the question will be: will it pay to have a copy

[10-Mar-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> this will be deciding factor.

[10-Mar-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @Ginasis Mining Pools Alright

[10-Mar-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> we should just all stfu and wait until mike has spoken

[10-Mar-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @SmeLLyArMpiTs please don‚Äôt abandon your wallet. You can either install the TestFlight mobile app onto your phone and send the coins there normally or @michaeltoutjr, @Asher , me, or someone should soon be able to tell you the wallet location on a Mac.

[10-Mar-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 8. Who is the developer of the xil chip?

[10-Mar-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i tried explaining it to him üòâ

[10-Mar-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 2. There could be a version 2 but to get better gains from a new unit it would require a better base FPGA chip (or more chips) this cost more.

[10-Mar-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gregorst> xilinx

[10-Mar-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Xilinx. They sell them as if they are CPUs.

[10-Mar-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Basically

[10-Mar-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 5. There is basically firmware called bitstreams that can be updated any time to mine better or mine other crypto algorithms

[10-Mar-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Or do any other task that is made for the device for that matter

[10-Mar-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> ok @Ginasis Mining Pools

[10-Mar-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> like weather sim

[10-Mar-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'm looking forward üòÑ

[10-Mar-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 6. Yes you can have your GPUs mine 1 thing. Your cpu mine another and the FPGA mine something different.

[10-Mar-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> cool

[10-Mar-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i didnt answer 6 because we don't have the hw yet

[10-Mar-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Hell you can seperate your GPU rig and mine something different on each GPU.

[10-Mar-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it shoul dbe a yes however

[10-Mar-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @0x03 You thinking of getting one?

[10-Mar-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I see no reason that the FPGA miner will stop / hinder mining anything else on GPUs.

[10-Mar-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> That would be a bad flaw in the program / miner of the FPGAs

[10-Mar-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @fng77 i've preordered one

[10-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> !! Jealous !! Me that is

[10-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but don't take me as a decision helper on that

[10-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> When do you expect delivery?

[10-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i just asked over in the ukminer discord

[10-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> üòâ

[10-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> ok

[10-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> HOPEFULLY some time in march

[10-Mar-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> üëç

[10-Mar-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Nice!

[10-Mar-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 8. The blackminer has multiple slightly lower model xil chips in it than the single one in the UKMiner. So once they update their bitstream it‚Äôs performance may increase but shouldn‚Äôt be anything crazy high.

[10-Mar-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 7* ^

[10-Mar-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ukminer17 and @Cuttlebit have taken an open approach. That means they are supporting the community effort to move to FPGAs without secret mining or the centralization that comes with it. We can expect clone boards at some point, and people will be able to use their open bitstream over time. Exactly when they publish their source with confirmation is still open. I believe that as long as they are confirmed, the community should support them as much as is reasonable, as the open approach they have decided on is somewhat unheard of in other projects. While we may and likely will tweak the algorithm in a future PBaaS update if more equalization is needed, we do not intend to move to an algo that blocks FPGAs at this time, and I don‚Äôt see a reason to do so.

[10-Mar-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Thanks for that info @miketout , That is a essential question I had.

[10-Mar-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'd like to share this from over at the ukminer discord

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just was posted.

[10-Mar-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Thanks

[10-Mar-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> To top it off: $399 is a competitive price for a 85Watt, 70MHs card. This will not hinder decentralization. I believe it will promote it...

[10-Mar-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @0x03 can you invite me to ukminer discord? Dont rember if ukminer already did it but im still not in üòÉ @Oink Yeh, thats good number.

[10-Mar-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> did that work? see your DM

[10-Mar-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Worked, Splendid!

[10-Mar-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You could have followed the link on UKMINERS homepage... LOL

[10-Mar-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Ok, just lazy today

[10-Mar-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> + brain = only 50% working

[10-Mar-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That would be a good day for me...

[10-Mar-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Yo yo

[10-Mar-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Just popping in to answer any Q‚Äôs while I‚Äôm stopped off. Out and about at the moment but do have 5/10 mins before I‚Äôm driving again.

[10-Mar-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> fng: hit him üòõ

[10-Mar-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> A lot of questions I know. But 399 is a lot of money. But Im thinking about selling one of my pugs to get it. He is 12 years old anyway..

[10-Mar-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Hahahaha.

[10-Mar-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Dogs before mining please dude. üê∂

[10-Mar-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @CryptoYeti Alright. üòÉ  If you look up a couple of lines I have asked 7 questions that are essential to me. These:

[10-Mar-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 1. Is there any chance that someone else will make a clone? Like china and sell it for 100 bucks or something? Heard it was opensource on the software.
2. Will there be a version 2 in the nearest future and will this one be worthless in that case?
3. Is there a possibility that versus 2.0 makes their algorithm "FPGA incompatible" in future?
4. Are the community onboard with this FPGA miner? I mean do the think its ok?
5. Is there a "firmware" in the device that can be upgraded in future, if there are bug and so on?
6. I have a gpu mining rig. Can you dualmine, with say all the GPU:s and this one on the same motherboard, just as you can do with Cpu:s and gpus on the same board?
7. What about this "blackminer" everybody is talking about? is it better, worse, same? Can it mine verus 2.0

[10-Mar-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> fng77 if you actually sell a dog for mining, i'm never ever going to speak a single word with you again

[10-Mar-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that is one of the worst things i've heard around this discord so far please do not even think about it!!!

[10-Mar-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @CryptoYeti Some are already awnered but Id like your input when you got the time.

[10-Mar-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Cloning is irrelevant unfortunately. Someone only needs to design a card using the same 420t chip and also with the power mods/requirements in order to do the same job. One unfortunate element to FPGA tech.

[10-Mar-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @0x03 I hope you understand I was joking üòÉ I love them more then I love myself

[10-Mar-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> good to know. it wasn't obvious.

[10-Mar-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> UKMINER is only releasing 1 Verus mining option. The one for sale right now.

[10-Mar-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> to me üòâ

[10-Mar-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @0x03 sorry

[10-Mar-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> It‚Äôs unlikely that Mike will make an algo change that totally eliminates FPGA. This is very hard to do. FPGA‚Äôs can be nerfed but generally not eliminated.

[10-Mar-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Right

[10-Mar-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We have some great community support. But we are a new company so it‚Äôs very early days for us. We have various coders and other people join the team since we launched.

[10-Mar-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> No firmware as such. But we will be releasing bitstreams for other coins that will work on this card

[10-Mar-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Cool, sound very good!

[10-Mar-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Blackminer is another company. We can‚Äôt comment on their business.

[10-Mar-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Ok, very happy with the answers Thanks @CryptoYeti

[10-Mar-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> @fng77 pleasure dude.

[10-Mar-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @fng77: one general remark. With the future rise of miners / FPGA‚Äôs / new CPU‚Äôs the network hashrate will inevitably rise, resulting in lower revenue for every device on the network. To me it‚Äôs common sense to keep that in mind, but I realize not everyone looks at it this way. It will translate into a longer ROI and in the end lower revenues, if that is the goal.

[10-Mar-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> yes

[10-Mar-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If your goal is supporting the network, my above statement is obviously irrelevant

[10-Mar-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> we have limited sales to 2 batches to support the CPU side of Verus mining.

[10-Mar-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Which I appreciate, @CryptoYeti !!!

[10-Mar-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But there‚Äôs talk of Ryzen3 series and maybe the prospect of cloned FPGA‚Äôs. Just a general warning that nothing in our future is set.

[10-Mar-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> mm

[10-Mar-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We're also putting some further thought into this matter and will comment once we have finished discussing internally.

[10-Mar-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> and yeah, this is crypto. The future changes daily üòÉ

[10-Mar-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @Oink Cloning could be a big problem. @CryptoYeti Perfect!

[10-Mar-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Closing the source code is not a good idea... this is an open community... the code might be adapted for other devices... Cloning is not too worrying for me, because the Xilinx chips are still needed, so it won‚Äôt cut the price in half. They may be a little cheaper b using substandard parts, but will they perform as UKMiners device. Will they last as long? Cheaper device may turn into spending more money than it‚Äôs worth

[10-Mar-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Yes I know, that's why I deleted it üòÉ I¬¥m with you on that.

[10-Mar-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Sry, was writing. Didn‚Äôt notice it changed...

[10-Mar-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> no, no Nice of you to answer, I was thinking about it and the drawbacks. Like windows vs Linux üôÉ

[10-Mar-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Its very cool that you also can mine other crypto with the FPGA as well I think!

[10-Mar-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> But Im gonna stick to VRSC for a while, thats for sure.

[10-Mar-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> you better do üòâ

[10-Mar-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> üòÖ

[10-Mar-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think it would be madness for UKMINER to not make use of the versatility of FPGA. Even if it‚Äôs just for marketing... I will stick to VRSC for sure, but then again, nothing in our future is fixed, except the fact that we all have to die....

[10-Mar-19 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Thanks everybody for your input! Out with the dogs again. I have to carry the older one, he cant hadle the cold here. My left arm looks like this after this winter üí™

[10-Mar-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ...doesnt `!vrsctip info` work in DM?!

[10-Mar-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> it used to

[10-Mar-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> doesn't it for you, as well?

[10-Mar-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> no longer working

[10-Mar-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ok, then it's prolly a discord issue
