[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> @bigtom @miketout 

I would think that having a blog/newsfeed with this sort of stuff on the verus.io site would be a good idea, or another domain that has a social networking/blog focus, with comments enabled etc

[11-Jul-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> could be a stream of contributions and news, as well as info pages to refer people to, contact, comment/discussion

[11-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> not my forte but I think it would make sense. I know there is the reddit too, so that could be developed further as one option

[12-Jul-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @O_User I believe @englal is working on some of this stuff. As the coin is a community coin,  there are a lot of coins available for people who take the initiative to do these kinds of things... (hint, hint ðŸ˜ƒ )

Getting error in agame for mining verus

Error reading configuration file: Missing komodo.conf

[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @Dr David the GUI version provides a Graphical User Interface. The CLI is a Command Line Interface, a more nerdy interface.

@[TPUX] Djith Wattignies what OS are you using?

[12-Jul-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> @Dr David sounds about right for a mobile CPU.

[12-Jul-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Some of the high turbo Speed Mobile CPUs have a really low TDP and cannot handle the heat of running all threads at 100%. Some of them start thermal throttling/modulating as low as 30%.

[dscrdvrsc] <Unholy1> Hi im trying to start mining but i dont know where to start i downloaded the Agama program n stuff but where do i go from there not even 1 youtube video about how to start mining the coin

[12-Jul-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> @miketout awesome, yes I assumed as much but wanted to expand on the ideas of your discussion above

hehe, yes currently trying to figure out how much I can commit, and what will be the best use of my time ;)

I'd love to go all in, but have a habit of over extending. The best stuff I can offer is generally ideas and networking - like, forwarding people I know and persuading them to do stuff. Have been sharing the project around quite a bit. My next person to talk to is a sociologist/data scientist, I will be interested in their opinion on the project (I expect they will love it) and if they want to get involved.

How long does agame sync with verus?

[12-Jul-18 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @Matterbridge the agama wallet is always syncing with the verus block chain if it is open and working , its an ongoing thing, but you should get it to 100% synced in about 5-10 mins, thats my experience with it,

[12-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[12-Jul-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> If your lucky you can restore the file amd run the wallet again with antivirus turned off temporarily, then add an excemption for agama and komodo folders

[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> @mammothine no more forced hodl soon

[13-Jul-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> @englal  ðŸ˜ƒ good point. But well, depends if the value of the project is in the price value of the coin or not... One could value the project and not have to follow the price necessarily. If he's still got coins he would've (might've) sold, he's going to have to be a part of the community longer than he may have planned if he was "lucky" enough to get the coins straight off the bat. 

If you are holding coins that you can't touch for 24 months, you probably are going to pay less attention to the price however. It would only be pertinent in the weeks leading up to the unlocking to watch the price. 

I'm here for the project first and foremost, if I get rich at the same time it's a bonus... others, I don't know, but many may see a coin as a coin and an investment opportunity and nothing more. They judge the content and the intent of the coin as part of the valuation of the investment. I really like the dynamic of locked coins though, it's very interesting trying to understand what it means to be involved in a crypto project but not actually have the coin in hand.

As for selling, it's inevitable that over time people will sell some of their holdings. For cash flow, diversification, dealing with debts etc. This way we're just not going to have that leakage in the same way. Although with more users we would hope some would sell to expand the partipant base of the project

[13-Jul-18 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @O_User Great points all around. I didn't phrase it clearly, but I meant pay attention to the project, rather than pay attention to the price. ðŸ˜ƒ

[14-Jul-18 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> @Gordon Komodo you mean Lil komodo's publicity campaign ;)

I'm a little ambivalent for now about promoting as I want to mine more. On the one hand, one can get bounties that will count towards staking, on the other hand, more competition for said staking expansion. Incentives are a bit tricky. However I am looking into what I can do and am spreading the word. 

@englal ðŸ˜ƒ I know what you meant really, I just wanted to be super clear about what was in my mind and do a bit of thinking aloud. I notice it does take some time for the timelock idea to sink in, and then one would have to re-adjust their decision whether to get involved in the project and evaluate their approach. It's a pretty awesome angle IMO

[14-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @cryptopat You can get the privkey from the wallet you want to move from then import the privkey ONE AT A TIME using the import private key function.
DO NOT try to import multiple private keys.  That does NOT work and sort of screws things up a bit by locking out those privkeys without fully importing them.   
It is very easy, but you just need to know where to get the privkeys and avoid the mistake of trying to import a list of them instead of one at a time.  I cannot stress that enough - ONE AT A TIME.

[14-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> I think I did also do a couple with dumpwallet and there was no option to wallet rescan on import so same issue that I couldn't see that they had imported, so didn't like it, but it worked

[14-Jul-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @O_User I tried to import a set of private keys by following the instructions on the Agama wallet.  They did not import and, when I then tried to import them one at a time - they would not import singly either.  I believe the wallet partially imported somehow during the attempt at multiple key importation and that led the wallet to ignore the single key import after that.  I had to restore my wallet.dat to a previous state  before I could get them to import as singles.  @miketout confirmed that the multiple import should be avoided.  Pretty sure that's who it was.

[14-Jul-18 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
