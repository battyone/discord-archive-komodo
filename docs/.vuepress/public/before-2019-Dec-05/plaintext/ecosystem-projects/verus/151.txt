[dscrdvrsc] <wookie> no block for 30 mins now

[25-Apr-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> True, and interesting.

[25-Apr-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wookie> were back now

[25-Apr-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Looks like there were several blocks solved within 1-2min which should have risen the difficulty by a lot.

[25-Apr-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wookie> so my luck when i was half way through a send haha

[25-Apr-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 22 blocks within a minute....

[25-Apr-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Apr-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> pfft... its only got a roi of 21,000%.....weak

[25-Apr-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> takes 99 years to get to that percent lol

[25-Apr-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @wookie and @zpajk thanks for documenting that. it was one of our longer periods. Even with those longer blocks, we do average 1 minute blocks. We have had long blocks periodically, but that was unusual. In any case, it is still within the statistical norms and can happen. There is some newer research on methods to reduce the high variance, and we will be looking into potential improvement in that area after rounding out the PBaaS work.

[25-Apr-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Man... this  is all exciting stuff. Everything coming together

[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Badfish did the minis actual ship???

[25-Apr-19 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I dont have any tracking number or anything yet. Waiting to hear back from Lilli

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Works like a charm, too.... (I wouldn't publish it if I had not tested it first...)

[26-Apr-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That's how you get people to adopt!

[26-Apr-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Looks very intuitive. Legit.

[26-Apr-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And safe... You supply the addresses at install / upgrade... The destination addresses cannot be changed in the web interface.

[26-Apr-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Would be nice to implement this interface in a staking pool.... (just popped up in my head)

[26-Apr-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Ginasis Mining Pools ... Hint, hint...

[26-Apr-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm heavily thinking about a staking pool (based on s-nomp) with  automatic periodical payouts and a web-interface for putting in stakes. The database behind it tracks the stakes entered and takes care of the automated payouts on PROP base...

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I'm still learning for sure. I got involved after all of that, but I guess our community has been involved in some of the feelings expressed, maybe unknowingly fanned the flames a bit. There was definitely a big reaction to our PoS work.

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Unfortunately there will be mixed feelings when some are in it for the tech and others for their bags when it comes to other projects than where they put their efforts.

[26-Apr-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> True, @zpajk , Which simply means they feel threatened by our tech, because they know it's going to hit them financially in the end...

[26-Apr-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Progenitor> Anyone heard about a potential Zcoin vulnerability? I may be way off here, but is VRSC related to Zcoin?

[26-Apr-19 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I Just read about it... apparently their cryptographic algorithm is flawed. We have our own unique algorithm, so we‚Äôre safe.

[26-Apr-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We use Zcash Sapling (and an updated Sprout) for zero knowledge, so that vulnerability doesn't apply to VRSC.

[26-Apr-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Nice to mine with...

[26-Apr-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> As @Oink mentioned, Verus has unique algorithms for a number of things, like proof of power (PoS/PoW), addressing nothing at stake, and further enhancing Komodo crypto conditions to enable PBaaS with merge mining, which has just started early testing. Right now, we're focusing on the next update of PBaaS testing, to make the autonotarization and payouts fully functional, and then reserve conversions.

[26-Apr-19 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
