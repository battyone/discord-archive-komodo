[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Some groups create a group for bots that is always visible to the right, like "MOD" here but named "BOTS" where it would show the latest price contstantly, handy for those that like the price in Discord.

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And besides that... I am of the opinion that BTC doesn‚Äôt go up or down, but fiat goes down/up

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Same as transition to Euro...people didn‚Äôt get used to it, because they kept converting to old currency

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Yellowstone if you don't solve this. please DM me. I had never seen this before until someone told me about it happening to them a few days ago. I also suggested a rescan and suspect that is what is needed, but I will be able to look at their machine by tomorrow if it still has issues.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Some excellent examples of the power that decentralized networks have to disrupt across many different fields and who knows, perhaps a few avenues of thought to go down for future PBaaS devs.. https://hackernoon.com/how-crypto-will-change-international-trade-6329696702a6

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I have heard from them. I believe they will ship. They explained what happened, which I will let them explain themselves and said they would provide an update within the week. I suggested that at this point, if they are near having something to show proof of where they are, they should consider waiting until they can include that in the update. They have a new dev working only on that, and I will make myself available to him if it will help.
