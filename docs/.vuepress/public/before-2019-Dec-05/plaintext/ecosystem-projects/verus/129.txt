[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> because it answers others in DM

[10-Mar-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> paia confirmed

[10-Mar-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ok, gonna restart discord

[10-Mar-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> looks like the bot is broken

[10-Mar-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> oh, ok

[10-Mar-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> oh?

[10-Mar-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @sclear

[10-Mar-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> wake up

[10-Mar-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @0x03 it doesn't answer me in DM. only when I'm DMing with the bot itself, and then it can't send to others

[10-Mar-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @sclear needs to have a look i think

[10-Mar-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i have asked @sclear since we got the bot about fixing rain and soak, but I haven't gotten a reply. @FishyGuts / Pirate donated it to the community, and I believe they have asked as well.

[10-Mar-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> me neither, i did message him before

[10-Mar-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> in fact i'm waiting for a reply since exactly the day the bot joined us here

[10-Mar-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> me too üòÉ

[10-Mar-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> awesome üòê

[10-Mar-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and I suspect @FishyGuts maybe as well

[10-Mar-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> kinda worried, he's a nice dude and it's unexpected for him to go missing like that

[10-Mar-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> no more sclear-like exits please üòÉ

[10-Mar-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> hopefully, he's fine. the bot seems to be working with basic tipping functions still

[10-Mar-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> !vrsctip thunder 24

[10-Mar-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VRSC TipBot> :cloud_lightning: @elme has been thunderstruck with 24 VRSC!

[10-Mar-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> lucky dude, eh

[10-Mar-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> üòâ

[10-Mar-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and thunder works

[10-Mar-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> üòÉ

[10-Mar-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yea everything thats commonly used works in public

[10-Mar-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's just the DM part that went bonkers a day or so ago

[10-Mar-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i was able to talk to it in DM no 48hrs ago

[10-Mar-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that still works for me when I am in DM with the bot, but I have never been able to access it from DM with someone else

[10-Mar-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> he'll probably get the @mentions. and i've just sent another message for good mesure.

[10-Mar-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Yes I told him I need to get a RL contact for him with Peoples funds sitting in his bots. üòÉ 
@sclear

[10-Mar-19 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i have found back his mobile # and sent an sms

[10-Mar-19 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'll let u know when i get a reply

[10-Mar-19 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> promised

[10-Mar-19 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> bot seems to have resumed work ... maybe it was out for dinner

[10-Mar-19 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> It works for me in DM, at least to make inquiries.

[10-Mar-19 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yea, probably went on a short strike. works for me again as well

[11-Mar-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ok, sclear is alive üòâ

[11-Mar-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> got a reply üòâ

[11-Mar-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> how can we make use of the fact that we've answered about any question about 10 times in the past in this discord? would anybody like to do a FAQ or something?

[11-Mar-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the search function of discord isn't of much use and i understand 100% why people may not want to use it

[11-Mar-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Something like #faq-chosen #faq-draft #faq-edited , maybe? üò¨

[11-Mar-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I get what you're saying. I'd wanna reach a point where we don't need to write to each other too. That'd be the dream! /s

[11-Mar-19 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Another back office boy.... LOL

[11-Mar-19 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But a faq or a how-to section would be a valuable addition!

[11-Mar-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> oh right we have faq channels *ducks, whistles and goes back into his corner*

[11-Mar-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but that still doesn't free us from the search feature üòÑ

[11-Mar-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it may be overcomplicated, but why not just have a directory full of textfiles where we put in the more productive discussions like with Smellyarmpits before and some web tool to search it?

[11-Mar-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just an idea tho

[11-Mar-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I didn‚Äôt say it had to be a discord section....

[11-Mar-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> FAQ discussion board √† la Stack Overflow

[11-Mar-19 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Did anybody see or had suspicions about FPGA mining VRSC v2?

[12-Mar-19 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Thoskk Currently I believe the F1 has a bitstream, or an early version of one, for VerusHash 2.0. I think the price to hash is relatively similar to other components currently on or about to be on the network.

[12-Mar-19 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Godballz  what I meant was: Is there any evidence that FPGAs already started to mine v2?

[12-Mar-19 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I think just the F1 community. I believe  @That_Guy8 did a trial too but I may be mistaken.

[12-Mar-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> saw it, thanks

[12-Mar-19 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Np. For the price, I'm interested in what ukminer can do

[12-Mar-19 12:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> though, if I'm not missing something, it might be hard to tell if a high hash from a single address is an FPGA or just a bunch of CPUs with same ID, right?

[12-Mar-19 12:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I'd also be happy with one of those... however, I think for the local cost of electricity, and break even taking 450 days, I will sell some FOIN and buy me some VRSC for staking.

[12-Mar-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> @Godballz: Over in #mining, @ukminer17 is asking for some assistance in testing a pool.

[12-Mar-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @wistar I saw him asking for someone with a few hundered mh/s but I am definitely not that guy, I wish.. I could put maybe 10mh/s when I get home but that's alls I got. üôÑ

[12-Mar-19 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> hello all!!  is there an authority on coin prices?   for example if i get prices from  https://coinpaprika.com      it is accurate?   or there is a better one you all reference from. . .

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> <https://coinpaprika.com/coin/vrsc-verus-coin/#!exchanges>
Yes, with DigitalPrice as a source, it's fairly accurate

[12-Mar-19 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> John Westbrook created and posted this api-
 Use with: <https://veruspay.io/api/> for simple USD VRSC price, or choose options now added!

Options (values are case insensitive): 
      currency - BTC or Fiat code like USD or CAD
      ticker - ARRR or VRSC
      data - volume or price - volume only relevant if exchange is defined
      exch - name of supported exchange, e.g. digitalprice - If no exchange, price is average of all supported for that coin.

If no options are set, the default is average price in USD fiat of VRSC.

Examples:

<https://veruspay.io/api/> - This get's the current price of VRSC in USD, weighted against 24hr volume across all exchanges. This is the default return.

<https://veruspay.io/api/?exch=digitalprice&currency=cad> - This will get the current price on digital price for VRSC and display in CAD fiat

<https://veruspay.io/api/?currency=btc> - This will get the average price of VRSC in BTC, weighted by 24 hr volume across both exchanges

<https://veruspay.io/api/?currency=cad> - This gets the current average price of VRSC in CAD, weighted by 24 hr volume across both exchanges

<https://veruspay.io/api/?exch=cryptobridge&data=volume> - This will get the 24 volume of VRSC on CryptoBridge in the default currency of USD

<https://veruspay.io/api/?exch=cryptobridge&data=volume&currency=btc> - This does the same but with BTC as the currency result

<https://veruspay.io/api/?currency=cad&ticker=arrr> - Gets the average price of ARRR, now added to the api! smiley
 @SmeLLyArMpiTs

[12-Mar-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> thank you

[12-Mar-19 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i notice ARRR .. its just another coin right?  why is it so special to be in the api ?  want to understand

[12-Mar-19 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It is another KMD related project

[12-Mar-19 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I believe the developers have worked together as well

[12-Mar-19 06:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> unlike other coins, pirate (which has the symbol of ARRR) *forces* you to do 'undercover transactions', @SmeLLyArMpiTs and thats the most important selling point of it, to me.

[12-Mar-19 06:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> z-transactions is what happens there, should you have read that term already

[12-Mar-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that aside. if anybody is running an nginx driven webservice, said person may be interested in knowing about https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-joins-f5/

[12-Mar-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Sure looks like spam to me..

[12-Mar-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> You posted this wall of text right here in general and also in trading at the same time?

[12-Mar-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crabby Paddy> well its $25 of free coins to komodo/verus users

[12-Mar-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crabby Paddy> il delete from trading channel

[12-Mar-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm not sure what the best approach is or the rules but I feel like when people see that more than once, that's the general impression they'd get too. Similar to many of the less welcome DMs but if you're giving something away, that seems like a nice gesture at least. I haven't seen ya around so the sudden burst set off alarms, ya know?

[12-Mar-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I would,like to see this confirmed by @miketout , since he has strong ties to Komodo, because of developing... I‚Äôm reluctant in giving that party any info at the moment by DM...

[12-Mar-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And in general: if it looks too good to be true, it usually is...

[12-Mar-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @Crabby Paddy

[12-Mar-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's like <1% reasonable anything of you say is true.

[12-Mar-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and you're making a lot of noise about it.

[12-Mar-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'll completely retract my statement should i be false; but this is too obvious in being bullshit

[12-Mar-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @paia when you notice this, can you delete above?

[12-Mar-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yes, i'm on purpose very unfriendly.

[12-Mar-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> even if it's true you're still unwanted here, @Crabby Paddy

[12-Mar-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's fun how spammers expect to be greeted with approval, otherwise they wouldn't do it

[12-Mar-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> don't bother reacting

[12-Mar-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> rest assured it will be subject to approval. @paia please remove it anyways, it can surely be reposted at a later time if it's legit, especially at a time when more people are active, should it be legit.

[12-Mar-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> how many tps/ctps are possible at the current state with VRSC ?

[12-Mar-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'd say equivalent to the benchmark komodo did a year(?) back

[12-Mar-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> 1 million tps?

[12-Mar-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if this was the number, i'd think it would be possible, yes

[12-Mar-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> may need more nodes for the network, but thats obviously probably a limiting factor

[12-Mar-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> is it possible to read vrsc as MQTT ?

[12-Mar-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> -> @miketout should be able to answer that, i cannot (but i'm certainly interested in the answer as well)

[12-Mar-19 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> the official vrsc explorer is saying there is a current supply of 38544018.02537829 coins. how is that float value possible **0.02537829** ?

[12-Mar-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @Crabby Paddy this is definitely not the place to promote or advertise, as the name of the channel implies, it's a place for general discussion related to Verus.  I would classify it as spam.

[12-Mar-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> @Crabby Paddy if you want to promote anything, ask for permission first and wait for approval.

[12-Mar-19 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Please remove your posts @Crabby Paddy, that would be dope.
