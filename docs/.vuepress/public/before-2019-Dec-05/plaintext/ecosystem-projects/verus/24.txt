[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Or I think I read something on here about pool mining. Is this something that may happen soon?

[28-Jul-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> When the halving occurs in a few hrs, all coins you get from then on will be non-timelocked. So you can stake them and make em work for you. Or you can sell them if youâ€™d prefer that.

[29-Jul-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Godballz well, right now in thinly traded conditions it is selling for around 12k to 20k sats - that's .98 to 1.64 usd

[29-Jul-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> And yes... pool mining should start soon after the non-locked block rewards start ... less than 3 hours from now.

[29-Jul-18 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> that assumes a pool has VRSC pooled mining working ðŸ˜ƒ

[29-Jul-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Alright> What is the block height for halving?

[29-Jul-18 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> 96480

[29-Jul-18 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> Is there a new wallet?

[29-Jul-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> 0.3.11 is the current version. you should upgrade before the halving if you haven't already, as it improves the PoS resistance to attack and is a required upgrade at halving

[29-Jul-18 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @dukeleto Probably just a matter of time I would think.

[29-Jul-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Sorry what does it mean to stake coins and have them work for you? Also what is the reward for finding a block

[29-Jul-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> I believe we just went through the next halving, which means the reward is now 96 coins.

[29-Jul-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> Look at #staking  to see more info on what staking is:)

[29-Jul-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> (5:30 am here, so kinda sleepy, woke up but going back to sleep:P)

[29-Jul-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> Network hash rate up to 1.1 TH/S, that didn't take long!

[29-Jul-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> 1 hour after halving

[29-Jul-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Godballz Staking is an incentive to those who have coins to keep their wallets and connections open in support of the network.  It is a bit like mining as far as luck and probability go, but instead of leveraging computational power in an effort to achieve a consensus on a transaction, coins are leveraged.

[29-Jul-18 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh ok thank you

[29-Jul-18 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Shaun> who knows how many confirmations before matureï¼Ÿ

[29-Jul-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sethmw> 100

[29-Jul-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> can I use the same wallet.dat in two cpmputers?

[29-Jul-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> just mining together

[29-Jul-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sethmw> you can, but I'm not that familiar with how. I believe they discuss how to do that in the redit faqs

[29-Jul-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> ok,

[29-Jul-18 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <thedon> So now evey coin i mine is instently mature and i can move it or use for staking , right ? Just making sure..

[29-Jul-18 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sethmw> yep, just move to a private z address from shielded coinbase and back to your transparent address and its staking

[29-Jul-18 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> I have staking before,but when I send some coins out ,then staking is over

[29-Jul-18 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LOUD Mining> @oscar anytime you make a transaction with your wallet, POS stops and you have to restart to continue staking available coins. At least that's what I understand about POS wallets.

[29-Jul-18 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LOUD Mining> Correct me if I'm wrong here anyone...

[29-Jul-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @LOUD Mining actually, that's not the case with Verus

[29-Jul-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the only coins that stop staking are the ones from the source transaction for the new transaction, because their age gets reset and they need to wait another 150 blocks

[29-Jul-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> alright

[29-Jul-18 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blancodiablo> how do we know how long the maturation is for the new 96 coin blocks?

[29-Jul-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> just 100 blocks till it mature

[29-Jul-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blancodiablo> cool. thanks

[29-Jul-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If something pops up under mining saying type: public direction: immature amount: 96 etc does that mean a block is found?

[29-Jul-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <riesbree> I see vrsc in blockfolio but still no value. Is there a way i can change that??

[29-Jul-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <iO_User> Just glad we had a small increase in hashrate, it's the perfect balance. 

I think the 2 worst case scenarios would have been a massive increase (so we all get less rewards), or no increase (indicating a lack of interest). 

However it may be that those mining now are just the existing community, but just put more hashpower on. 

But I'm optimistic with time and through spreading the word, people will start to understand the value of this coin and help us grow.

[29-Jul-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @garnettfan The coinbases (block rewards) can only be spent to a private address in an action called "shielding" you need to shield the coins, then you can use them as any other coins, such as sending them to a private address to stake with.

If you're using Agama there's an option in the send interface (might only show up after you select private tx, I can't remember as I only really use CLI) to shield coinbases.

If you're using CLI you need to use the z_shieldcoinbase command.

[29-Jul-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Jul-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @bitcoinB ahh you are still using 0.3.9.. I think you are on the wrong chain..

[29-Jul-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Jul-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam - [triforce]> so all of the mined blocks are on the wrong chain? do I need to get rid of old chain data and start from scratch?

[29-Jul-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam - [triforce]> Ok, Iâ€™ll do that when I get home. I have a bad feeling.... I had thought the extra blocks were due to the lower hash rate from the block halving

[29-Jul-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam - [triforce]> Although I did send from the Mac to the win10 so maybe..... unless theyâ€™re both on the wrong chain

[29-Jul-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> ya hashrate is at an all time high right now.. popping off blocks on 0.3.9 is most likley pissing in the wind..

[29-Jul-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @bitcoinB Yup, looks like you are mining with the old version, so you have been mining on a fork after block 96480. That explains how you are getting so many block rewards.

[29-Jul-18 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bitcoinB> k thanks so how do i rectify this

[29-Jul-18 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bitcoinB> download the new version and then inport the wallet.dat file

[29-Jul-18 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bitcoinB> or can i use my pass seed

[29-Jul-18 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> just download the new wallet.. and start it.

[29-Jul-18 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> it automatically picks up on the existing wallet

[29-Jul-18 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Jul-18 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ameserkha> Will it pick up my old blocks from the other wallet?

[29-Jul-18 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> yes.. it all refrences the same 'app data' location where the komodo fodler is with the wallet.dat and etc within it

[30-Jul-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ameserkha> Lol shit, I had 3 blocks from the old app it isnâ€™t showering up on the new one

[30-Jul-18 12:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Old Man Phil> go back through the discord chat others have had that problem and the fix is not hard if you saved the old wallet
