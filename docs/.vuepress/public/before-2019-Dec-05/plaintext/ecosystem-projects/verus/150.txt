[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> 39 981 198 (48.00%) is this correct cir supply?

[24-Apr-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Pretty much. Yet, a lot should still be time locked.

[24-Apr-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> I see. How much is timelocked?

[24-Apr-19 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Hard to know exact amount without going through the whole chain. Early rewards above 192 vrsc were time locked to be "randomly" released the following 2 years.  *"During the first 5 months, Verus will have an accelerated reward curve for mining and staking, with a halving every month. During the first two months, when the block rewards are at or above 192 Verus, mined blocks will have time locked coinbase transactions, preventing spending, staking, or transferring of those coins for a period that varies from approximately 3 months after the genesis block, based on numbers of blocks, to 2 years and 3 months."*

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Oink so glad you did that! Was hoping to get to give it a try tonight.

[24-Apr-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Looks awesome!

[24-Apr-19 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Do you have a reddit account or would you want to have that linked there? Not that reddit has ever helped much but maybe another way to spread the word won't hurt

[24-Apr-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I do have reddit, but feel free to put it up there...

[24-Apr-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I wanted to write something myself but I haven't used it yet and don't know enough to speak comfortably about it

[24-Apr-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh well if you do, maybe I can find some obscure subs to link it later

[24-Apr-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just read my tweets... that should cover the average reddit reader... whoehahaha

[24-Apr-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôm actually not a reddit-fan... I try to avoid it whenever possible...

[24-Apr-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Dont blame ya. I like to read random stuff but the community is garbage

[24-Apr-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Most Reddit‚Äôs in /crypto are just links to other places... not wasting my time on that.

[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> My wife took the pictures and due to the shinyness of the coin and the lighting she took it in, the lettering is hard to read. I'll take better pictures tonight

[24-Apr-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> nice and shiny üòÉ

[24-Apr-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I like it... glad I ordered as soon as I did!

[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> So, I cant blame my wife for the picture... shiny is an understatement lol. These things are haaaarrrd to get a good picture of to show the words

[24-Apr-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> that's really difficult. You could try with dimmed light coming from a flat angle, and the reflecting surface mirroring a white background (ceiling or alike).  
However, when zooming in a little, it's better:

[25-Apr-19 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> By the way, anyone who's interested, I just announced in #veruspay - the new release of VerusPay, v0.3.0, is now out!  Be sure to follow the guide (either install or upgrade) carefully.  Although VerusPay v0.3.0 is in the WordPress library, you must follow the steps and run the appropriate script on your wallet server first.  See the channel there for details!  üòÉ

[25-Apr-19 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> This version includes wallet management features, new security layers, and KMD support

[25-Apr-19 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> and a bunch other stuff, that's the highlights

[25-Apr-19 12:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I'll be doing this in about an hour

[25-Apr-19 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> anyone who has ideas of how we might want to get all of this information out, I'm going to stop by the marketing channel and discuss all of the news we have and ideas for getting the word out. feel free to join and contribute

[25-Apr-19 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Firing up Veruspay VM to upgrade...

[25-Apr-19 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> FYI everybody, besides an excuse from CryptoYeti **nothing** has happened since i requested my refund. it's about 24hours now.  i was also asked to contact ukminer17 about the refund, which i did, also nothing.

[25-Apr-19 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> So besides radio-silence on their discord, no DM's?

[25-Apr-19 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I just pinged them. I will go to sleep and check back in the morning.

[25-Apr-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @Oink: roughly around the time i wrote to their discord yesterday i sent a DM to CryptoYeti, to which he responded with a similar excuse that he also posted in their general channel, additionally asking me to contact ukminer17 as he has control over the funds. and since then the ether has gone silent.

[25-Apr-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Well, from what I've seen, Ukminer17 isn't the best communicator...of the ukminer group, that is...

[25-Apr-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But I supposed your BTC wallet hasn't grown since your message too...

[25-Apr-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Oink who is the communication winner of the group? üòÇ

[25-Apr-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @GlorymanRTS You tell me!

[25-Apr-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if they actually did a silent refund i'll laugh my ass off. i had DM contact with both ukminer17 and CryptoYeti at time of preorder making sure they'd account for my changelly transaction correctly, to which they both positively responded that they would do so.

[25-Apr-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that would've lost me the money and i'd be very amused

[25-Apr-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> üòÇ

[25-Apr-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> however that would mean correct refunding

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Personally I'm torn... I really want this FPGA (I invested in building a proper rig for it), on the other hand: the way it's going i say stuff it!

[25-Apr-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> See, being broke has its advantages. It means no one can get my money! üòÑ

[25-Apr-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[25-Apr-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[25-Apr-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[25-Apr-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I was guttered that I missed opportunity to dump yesterday. Price went from 2200 to 1980 üò≠

[25-Apr-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> and bitcoin went from 5.6k to 5.4k

[25-Apr-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I would have made like 25-30% in one trade üò≠

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I was definitely not going to preorder anything quoted in USD but charging in crypto from an unknown company

[25-Apr-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Still talking about prototype boards over a month after initial ship by date

[25-Apr-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> They don't realize it, but they're digging a deep, deeeeeeep hole right now...

[25-Apr-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm actually too pissed off, to react sensibly on their discord, so I won't.

[25-Apr-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I think serious missteps were made with the entire fpga reaction from the time the f1 was found out about

[25-Apr-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> but hey who am I

[25-Apr-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> so... ukminer = scam?

[25-Apr-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I don't think its a scam as much as probably just a few guys being too ambitious, and got in over their heads

[25-Apr-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> And now they don't know how to get out

[25-Apr-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I think they have fucked up, but probably not out of malice

[25-Apr-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I am in a state, that I will personally bring that company down

[25-Apr-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I think the fork was premature, I think announcing this board for the bounty was as well. As far as I know they have not received the bounty, but they profited from the announcement but have yet to deliver

[25-Apr-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I stand by the fork and don't think it was a overreaction. I believe we'd be worse off if it continued. Other than that I agree that preordering anything is really risky, and their time estimates have been way off, but I see nothing wrong in keeping an open mind about which board to use. It should be the same fpga chip and their supplier is said to be ready to ship either way. That's my interpretation.
