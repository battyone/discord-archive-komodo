[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> 62% hashrate

[26-Oct-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> greedy fuckers

[26-Oct-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> @damodar when the network is more secure, your coin is more valuable. I would rather have this large hashrate support the network than be smallest and have a successful adversarial attack.

[26-Oct-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> looks like a sick pac man

[26-Oct-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Is that a pool? I thought it was solo miners

[26-Oct-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> 62% hashrate is most like solo miners + small + private pools

[26-Oct-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> i hope this might be private pools

[26-Oct-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> and i repeat, most websites incorrectly take into account solo miners in mining pool % stats

[26-Oct-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> math is hard

[26-Oct-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> @Gameoverzoin I had a cli hiccup the other day, restarted with a -rescan and that fixed it

[26-Oct-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Maybe shut down agama, and upon startup select the -rescan from the menu below the native button

[26-Oct-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Worth a shot since I have no idea what error code 8 is

[26-Oct-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Rescan May take some time but it might fix it

[26-Oct-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gameoverzoin> last time i loose my coins when i restart wallet lol)

[dscrdvrsc] <Gameoverzoin> it was before freezing

[26-Oct-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Oct-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Oct-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Oct-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Doesn’t make much sense but I’m not a tech expert

[26-Oct-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gameoverzoin> waiting for the mike answer

[26-Oct-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Let the rescan finish and @miketout or @michaeltoutjr could chime in maybe

[26-Oct-18 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <2Faze> So max circulating supply one time will be about ~50 million is that right?

[26-Oct-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Circulating is somewhere between 9-10 million right now

[26-Oct-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Max supply is 80 million

[26-Oct-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Current total supply is just short of 29 million

[dscrdvrsc] <2Faze> Got it thx

[26-Oct-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <michaeltoutjr> @Gameoverzoin Hi, shielding shouldn't have any effect on how your coins are stored in your wallet, even before shielding, you have the keys to your coins so quitting the wallet shouldn't lose them. It is possible however, that you were on a fork before and you are now on the main chain, so you don't have the funds you had from the fork
