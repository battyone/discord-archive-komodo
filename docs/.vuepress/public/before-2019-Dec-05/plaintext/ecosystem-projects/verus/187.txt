[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> completed reading that MMR newsgroup email of Peter Todd. took me two days going back and forth shuffling between other things and reading it.
I'm that slow reader. Just repeatedly read a part until I feel like I understand it's context and meaning. üòÖ

[28-Jun-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Haha I've been going down a Peter Todd rabbit hole too here- <https://petertodd.org/> and I actually looked into blur and coda that you mentioned which led me to a very cool video with a nice simple explanation of zk-snarks. Interesting tech behind both but I don't want to get too sidetracked

[28-Jun-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> have few questions now. Please note that this is coming from a blockchain core newbie:
- in MMR the TXO commitments delays play some role in it's security and validity of the txout spends. How long is this delay in Verus' implementation?
- Need also a clarity and confirmation that if Mountain Merkle Ranges are compatible and implementable on the same blockchain which uses Merkle Roots? I feel like sounding a bit silly asking this question, but just asked.
- In that newsgroup post of Peter's it says the MMR TXO commitments can be verified solely by the Full nodes as well, if they wish to, as I understand from the concept of MMR the peaks can be used to generate the path to validate the UTXO/STXO/TXO spends/unspends. With that understanding the Miners doesn't has to do the amount of work for the validation part of these MMR. If I understood this part correct, can you please clear how this validation of peaks and TXO commitments are handled in Verus? If it is validated by the miners, is that implementation applied to the stagers as well?

[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @Godballz I'd like to better understand zk-SNARKS mate, please share that video which helped you üôÇ

[28-Jun-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Ok well I can find a better document for that but I'll look for both

[28-Jun-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[28-Jun-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That's not it but essentially

[28-Jun-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> - If the MMR are only used in the PBaaS currency and not in the main chain of Verus, then I want to understand how they are working cross blockchains to keep the calculations that your algo will be doing for reserve currencies? Feel a bit confused on this part. I understand with MoMoM implementation, the Notary Nodes play a role to keep the Merkle Roots data notarised and that helps any network full nodes to validate the proof of some transaction happened on any other cross blockchain. How is this validated in PBaaS model using MMR structure ?

[28-Jun-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Wait

[28-Jun-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It is part of the whole ecosystem including Verus pretty sure

[28-Jun-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It had been implemented in one of the recent upgrades, likely the mandatory one?

[28-Jun-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> - How much data does it really save using MMR instead of traditional UTXO models? If for example I prune my full node, how will it get all the valid data if for example there are lessor of the full nodes or may be even in case there are nodes who either archived or pruned the TXO of spends from it's database to keep the size of the blockchain smaller, under MMR implementation.

[28-Jun-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I believe it is orders of magnitude smaller in size I'll have to check but I believe Peter Todd gives a rough assessment

[28-Jun-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @Godballz cool! bookmarked that link üôÇ

[28-Jun-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Basically the video that I am going to link you describes the proofs like this- imagine I have a giant boulder and I want to prove to you that it exists. One way of doing this is that I can bring you to the boulder which would require time and effort or I can ship the boulder to you which would also require time and effort but there is a third option, let's say I take a photograph of the boulder and bring that to you, it requires less work and less time but I can still prove to you that the boulder exist and describe it to you in detail

[28-Jun-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @grewalsatinder every Native wallet running is essentially a full node. The lite clients leave the work to be done by the electrum servers. So any native wallet can notarize and verify...

[28-Jun-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I know it‚Äôs not a full answer on your questions, but it‚Äôs a start.

[28-Jun-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @Oink I understand your answer from existing Merkle Roots/trandtional UTXO models based. Mine are more towards the MMR based. üôÇ

[28-Jun-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @Godballz that's nice example indeed ü§î üëç

[28-Jun-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you prune your MMR, you basically remove UTXOs that have been spent, so they no longer matter. But if you rescan the previous blocks in the chain, the pruned data s still available there. So if you want insight in the spent UTXOs you can walk back into the chain history, to ‚Äòunprune‚Äô you‚Äôre MMR

[28-Jun-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> hmm... so does that mean I don't need to connect to the rest of the nodes to unpruned my full node?

[28-Jun-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> does that also means that MMR can be overlayed or applied along with the UTXO model? I feel confused that if MMR is totally different implementation of data structure for a blockchain or is extending the existing UTXO model?

[28-Jun-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Theoretically you should be able to retrieve that data from the chain you have in store. Since every block should match the block of the same height on every other node (otherwise you‚Äôve forked away) it‚Äôs useless to ask other nodes for this unpruned data, since they too have to look it up in their chain history.

[28-Jun-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> okay, that clears at least the pruning/unpruning part. üôÇ Thanks üëç

[28-Jun-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Compare it to spending money.... you give somebody a 10 dollar note and receive back a 1 dollar note.... the 10 dollar note UTXO is gone and can be pruned and you got a new 1 dollar note UTXO on a new branch in the tree..... once that is 1 dollar note UTXO is spent, you can prune the entire branch back to the ‚Äòoldest‚Äô unspent UTXO...
those notes are no longer in your wallet, so not worth remembering.

[28-Jun-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> agree

[28-Jun-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Very important to note that we do NOT use MMRs at all like other coins. I can‚Äôt answer with details at the moment, but the discussion took a turn, and talk of UTXOs with MMR, etc don‚Äôt apply to Verus use at all. Same structure, different uses. Like I said, the closest use case is in the FlyClient paper. Nothing anyone else is doing really relates to Verus use of MMRs. It‚Äôs a tool with many possible uses.

[28-Jun-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> As far as efficiency, from a raw data structure perspective, we almost certainly have the most efficient MMR implementation there is. Finally, it is in the current release, but is not yet used until PBaaS.

[28-Jun-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> okay, thanks for clearing. I yet to read the FlyClient paper. Only had finished the Peter Todd's MMR text. at least got a bit of grasp where things are heading reading that.

[28-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôll start reading the flyclient paper...

[28-Jun-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> will read FlyClient paper and get back here if I have any further questions. Thanks again @miketout üòÉ

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Thanks for correcting me, Mike.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thanks too! I appreciate the discussion, and I understand that there‚Äôs a lot of tech that will probably take some time for people to fully understand. After I finish with implementation, explanation will be a big priority üòÉ

[29-Jun-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> How much verus u guys think one should atleast have?

[29-Jun-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Depends on your goals... 
- A profit-miner will want to exchange ASAP to a coin that's valuable to him.
- An investor will accumulate as much as feasible to sell in future at a profit.
- A Coin supporter will get enough for staking to secure the network.
- A careful 'newbie' will get a small amount to see what he can do with it.

[29-Jun-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> I am looking at staking

[29-Jun-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Is there a minimum amount?

[29-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No minimum for staking...

[29-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> It aint cheap at this price too

[29-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Optimus_prime There is a staking pool which is better if you want regular rewards, look in #staking for more info.

[29-Jun-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Every coin has the same weigh on the network, so if you have 10 coins, you stake on average 10 times more often than with one coine in the same time period

[29-Jun-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> How often would you like to get a reward?

[29-Jun-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Holding 750 now

[29-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> With 750 coins it would be wise to consider a pool, like @Crupti said

[29-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Alright

[29-Jun-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Optimus_prime I think it¬¥s @Ginasis Mining Pools that has the staking pool

[29-Jun-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Jun-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> @Crupti also any plans on atomic swap. Thats pretty much the future. Decred is probably leading that field now

[29-Jun-19 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Optimus_prime I¬¥m no expert on this, ask @Oink - I think Verus already has Komodo atomic swap, though.

[29-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Verus has all the capabilities inherited from the Komodo chain. afaik Komodo has the atomic swap capabilities, therefore Verus can use that.
As soon as PBaaS is released we'll have a far more advanced exchanging capability between Verus and it's ecosystem chains on top of that.

[29-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cryptoon> You can already swap verus with 95% other coins using barterdex. Currently working on new marketmaker 2.0 which should improve user experience tenfold

[29-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> TY @Cryptoon

[29-Jun-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Thanks for the into. Have been in crypto space since 2016. I thin. Verus and Beam are by far the 2 community focusing on tech in social discussions. Thats great.

[29-Jun-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> And my i ask. With verus sharing the tech with Arrr , Hush and entire komodo community. How is it Verus would stand out although its the creator of these innovative techs? Doesnt that in long run depends on which ecosystem has better marketing strategy?

[29-Jun-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We'll always have the advantage of being the first to have that tech implemented. The Komodo ecosystem may decide not to implement, or only implement parts (if possible).

[29-Jun-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> PBaaS is not the end of the Verus Vision. It may be worth reading the Vision Paper from out website

[29-Jun-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> I ask this cause I have been following verus since Nov 2018. It was around 0.08-0.1 then. Arrr waz at mere 0.03-0.02. But now the sister company ( if I may call it as such ) is way successful due to marketing strategy

[29-Jun-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> verus has few amazing tech:
- 51% attack resistant even without dPoW
- Nothing @ Stake solved
- PBaaS is very exclusive to Verus
- Verus Reserve currency will be very exclusive to Verus too
- Thank to Verus reserve currency, the PBaaS ecosystem very much like Komodo's Smartchain ecosystem will make it a centre of not just Verus PBaaS, but also Komodo Smartchains as well. This is also amazing in sense where you don't even worry about Atomic Swaps. It is amazingly cool tech development.

[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> @Optimus_prime  what you are really asking is what to invest to get more money. No one can tell that for you üòÉ

[29-Jun-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> and it's not tech that leads the prices ibviously so does not make sense to disucss such at current stage

[29-Jun-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> see top 20 coins - all have less tech then Verus, KMD and others

[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçãno absolutely wrong

[29-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not only marketing strategy, but also development strategy. People are getting more and more aware of privacy with everything that is happening in the world around us. Basically they focus on other things than Verus.

[29-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> so since it got nothing to do with tech at current stage, it's market deciding the price, which nobody knows

[29-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> In long run tech wins but with a wity lil planing

[29-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Let me expand on the first point:
- 51% attack resistant even without dPoW, that means Verus is having 3 layers protection:
- Consensus algo 50%: Verushash v2 Proof of Work
- Consensus algo 50%: Verushash v2 Proof of Power/Proof of Stake
- Consensus algo makes it 51% attack being 50/50
- Komodo dPoW notarisation is 2nd' layer of 51% attack.

[29-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> in the long run the world will cease to exist üòõ

[29-Jun-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã yea marketing for now is based on FOMO if the individual do not know the tech. And this currently accounts to 90% of crypto investors..look at Tron. Shitcoin. Even Iost is better but thats wht market relies on nowadays
