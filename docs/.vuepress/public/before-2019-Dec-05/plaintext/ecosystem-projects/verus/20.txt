[dscrdvrsc] <Dzimmy> what happened to the reddit page? Appears that it was banned...

[24-Jul-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Dzimmy I'm just looking into that. I went there myself and saw that. I'm a mod there, but I had nothing in my inbox stating anything we might have done wrong, and the last post I made was about the update with instructions. I've sent an appeal and a request to let us know what even happened. Any other ideas would be appreciated.

[24-Jul-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> still haven't heard anything from them except for the first bot response

[24-Jul-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Dzimmy> I'll send them an email as well. Maybe if they see more than 1 email regarding an issue they'll give it a higher priority.  Wish I could be of more help but I'm not very familiar with reddit's rules and regs. Hopefully it get's sorted out soon and if I receive a response I will be sure to let you know.

[24-Jul-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm not sure either. michaeltoutjr also sent them mail before I knew. maybe they assume we are the same person with 2 accounts or something. i really have no idea why the community was banned, and none of the mods have gotten notice or an explanation yet.

[24-Jul-18 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if anyone wants to send a message, i don't see how it could hurt. thanks

[24-Jul-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> I also emailed reddit!

[24-Jul-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Lucivere thanks. none of the mods have heard anything back from them. I didn't even realize something like this could happen with no notice, no reason, and no answer. I'm concerned about making a new community there until we figure this out, but they seem to have no method of doing so reliably.

[24-Jul-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> I got a very cryptic (haha!) mail in response to my ticket. The only word in it was ¬´dnr¬ª.
Errr, ok...? I wrote back asking what that was supposed to mean:P

[24-Jul-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)
That is VERY strange.

[24-Jul-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Lucivere what else was in your mail response? what made it seem like haha?

[24-Jul-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> That‚Äôs precisely what I wrote! I also think of the medical term! The haha was just for my use of cryptic given we‚Äôre into crypto;)
Nothing else at all from the reddit support person, just... dnr

[24-Jul-18 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> This seems almost as if it's not random or a mistake, but that the community was targeted. We have seen a very obnoxious troll on bitcointalk making false claims. I wonder if there is some connection. I would have expected more from Reddit, but I guess I have no experience that tells me I should. I'm about ready to ask everyone for help on this, as we are getting no information from Reddit so far. As far as I know, we violated no rules whatsoever.

[24-Jul-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> It's common practice for BTC and BCH (and various zec forks) people to fight and ban each others subreddits and all kinds of shenanigans. I would not be surprised if it's a competitor coin or just some bored internet trolls. Sadly, this is common on Reddit

[24-Jul-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> how does someone even ban someone else's subreddit? corruption in reddit admins?

[24-Jul-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> Considering the many adult subs (nudity and gore for example), I would say Verus‚Äô sub was quite innocent! If they reply back to me, I‚Äôll update ofc

[24-Jul-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Not just the type of content, based on their rules, we can find nothing violated that we know of ... considering next steps, so if anyone has ideas or knows someone at Reddit, please let me know. Thanks!

[24-Jul-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <samson> I have no idea what I'm doing üòú

[24-Jul-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Lucivere dnr could mean "do not respond"

[24-Jul-18 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> I had that inkling too. But why the heck send it to me...?

[24-Jul-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> No blocks in 2 days 2000 stake and 600mh

[24-Jul-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> @Lil komodo turn VPN off, resync from start. Helps me.

[24-Jul-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I'm also very low on staking still. I was thinking it was getting back to normal, but it hasn't yet. if it's caused by someone gaining an unfair advantage, that should go away at the halving. To figure out if there's anything like that, I will look at the blockchain to see if there are standout staking addresses that are making more than they statistically should.

[24-Jul-18 10:27 PM] digital bullion#8223
Hi all,  just curious as to how many threads I should be running in the Verus mining wallet, as to achieve the greatest efficiency and chance of mining a block. I am just mining with my desktop cpu.  Any advice is appreciated üßê

[24-Jul-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I just have a shitty laptop on it

[24-Jul-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> Not sure if this apply for mining, but usually a CPU can handle one thread for each core. Some of them have "hyper threading technology" and can handle two threads for each core. If you are using windows just press Ctrl+Shift+Esc and look for "Logical Processors" under Performance tab

[24-Jul-18 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Mining about 24 hours, no blocks (none expected, the math says I should get one every 11-12 days)

[25-Jul-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> @BigCat45  no vpn

[25-Jul-18 12:31 AM] digital bullion#8223
Awesome. I thought it may be related to the number of cpu cores and cpu ‚Äòhyper threading‚Äô.
Thank you for the clarification.

[25-Jul-18 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Tommygun007> 8 days without a block lol it will come soon

[25-Jul-18 03:51 AM] digital bullion#8223
8 days üò¶ü§Æ?
I am about 24 hours in and was hoping for a block üòÜü§™

[25-Jul-18 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> OK, so I'm officially on target for staking returns now

[25-Jul-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> 24 days mining and iv found 2 blocks, im feeling lucky üòÜüòÇ

[25-Jul-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Need to get more cpu‚Äôs

[25-Jul-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> WORKING ON IT üòÇ

[25-Jul-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Someone recommended me to switch mining to verus from graft.

I can‚Äôt find much in terms of reviews or info.

Any help would be appreciated

[25-Jul-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Is there any pools or solo mining?

[25-Jul-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @ChrisC30a hi remember me üòÅ

[25-Jul-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I very much do üòâ

I‚Äôve been trying to find more info

[25-Jul-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> The problem your having finding reviews and tutorials for verus is because its still so new to the crypto scene

[25-Jul-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Which is sort of good for you and me because we still have a good chance of beating all the hoards of miners to the big rewards

[25-Jul-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> So basically it‚Äôs a gamble, get in while it‚Äôs under the radar.

[25-Jul-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Everything is a gamble, I‚Äôll rephrase that üòâ

[25-Jul-18 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I have spare resource not doing much as it‚Äôs older multi core CPU‚Äôs. Being written for cpu mining I might be able to utilise some wasted resource

[25-Jul-18 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Sort of, i mean solo mining has a big luck factor in it, eg say 1 person has got 700mh/s  and you have got 50mh/s , dont think because they have got a lot more hash power than you means you wont get anything, it just means they will have a better chance at getting blocks than you, but you could still find a block or more just like they did

[25-Jul-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> If you increase your hashrate to say 500mh/s you could find more than before or you could still be waiting days to find  a block

[25-Jul-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Iv only found 2 blocks in 24 days with only 61mh/s

[25-Jul-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I had about 7kh/s with etn then switched to graft and it dropped to about 3.5kh/s

Same miner.

[25-Jul-18 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> But its not turning me mining because i know i will get more soon, but if i didnt start mining verus coin now and i started say in 10 months time i would think my odds at finding blocks would be greatly diminished

[25-Jul-18 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> How does it work if you have multiple rigs? Do they create your own pool or does each rig mine independently? Each one has its own chance of finding a block, of one does then the other will be able to help or not be able to?

[25-Jul-18 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Last time i checked the verus coin network hashrate was 650gh , it could be treble that in 10 months

[25-Jul-18 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Which makes it alot harder to find blocks

[25-Jul-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> More people on the network means more miners fighting for blocks

[25-Jul-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Very interesting, I‚Äôll dedicate a couple of rigs to it.

[25-Jul-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I am using 2 pc‚Äôs at the moment with 2 separate wallets , most people on here are using multiple machines , iv not dived in to combining wallets to mine to one address but i know others have, but im pretty sure even if you have 50 machines going they are all just solo mining not creating there own pool , but you could say in your head that your combined hadhrate from them 50 machines is your own virtual pool because any wallet you own that finds  blocks is yours

[25-Jul-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> You would control the whole hashrate of your machines

[25-Jul-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Its a bit confusing at first

[25-Jul-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I see, so basically each machine you assign increases your chance of finding a block

[25-Jul-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Yes exactly

[25-Jul-18 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> What the hell, I‚Äôll give it a go while it‚Äôs still new üòä

[25-Jul-18 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> What platform are you on?  Windows, MacOS or Linux?

[25-Jul-18 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> If you have rigs that are gpu mining, why not use the cpu‚Äôs to mine Verus:) As long as your cpu‚Äôs support it ofc

[25-Jul-18 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Also i believe you don‚Äôt accumulate hash shares for each rig so if you leave one rig mining for like 2 days solid but you need to restart your pc for some reason you would not lose any built up hash shares

[25-Jul-18 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> That‚Äôs a good shout, my rigs are older machines that were top of the range when new. The gpu‚Äôs are poor or not supported.

I mainly cpu mine, gpu‚Äôs count towards less than 10% of my hashing power

[25-Jul-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> Heck, my daughter‚Äôs laptop which is a low i5 around three years old is mining and has also found a block:P

[25-Jul-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Great, once the block is found is it yours until mined? Or can someone else steal that block?

[25-Jul-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> You get coins as a reward:)

[25-Jul-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Yeah, sorry I mean until completed. I guess you only get the reward once the block is complete?

[25-Jul-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> The block is yours if it stays in your imature block balance for like an hour or so or maybe less

[25-Jul-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Iv not seen one come in my wallet and then disappear but i have heard of it

[25-Jul-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Cool, ok. That makes sense

[25-Jul-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> For the moment all blocks found will be time locked for a specific amount of time

[25-Jul-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> My fist block has got 324 days untill it matures, my second block has got 6 months before it matures

[25-Jul-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I‚Äôm not entirely sure what that means, I‚Äôve ever only mined as part of pools.

Compile my own miners and keep them up to date.

[25-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> There is a halfing coming very soon wher all blocks found after the halfing will have 96 coins instead of 192 coins , and non of them will be time locked

[25-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I didnt understand this point when i first started mining verus but over time iv come to understand it better

[25-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> They locked the early blocks so that people wouldnt just pump and dump coins on there network,

[25-Jul-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Aw I see, I‚Äôm a hoarder üòÇüòÇ

[25-Jul-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Crashing the price down

[25-Jul-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I am a hoarder also üòÅ

[25-Jul-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I have a large variety of coins, lost a small fortune but oh well

[25-Jul-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Haha!! Great minds think alike

[25-Jul-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I don‚Äôt buy anymore, just mine

[25-Jul-18 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> So basically the wallet is all you need? It‚Äôs also the miner?

Hence when you said about having multiple wallets, makes sense now.

[25-Jul-18 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im in the frame of mind that crypto will take over the world soon quietly and quickly , or maybe in 10 years but its defo coming, so the more crypto i can amass now in the early days the more happy me and my family will be in the future, also i like the community‚Äôs that im following so im having fun along the way, so yes all you need is that agama wallet open and mining and thats your miner and wallet in one

[25-Jul-18 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> The one thing i found the most helpfull was how to back up your wallet if you have blocks or coins in it

[25-Jul-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Its not very intuitive , but i found out if on windows you need to go to %appdatta% folder then roaming then make a backup copy of the agama and komodo folders, iv heard all you really need is your wallet.bat file thats located in one of the folders but i just back up both folders and keep them safe

[25-Jul-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Yeah, it‚Äôs difficult to keep on top of.

I have a portfolio, keep some in binance, some managed by the ledger.

Binance isn‚Äôt ideal but it‚Äôs all on one place

[25-Jul-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Iv got a bit of bitcoin on coinbase then some more sat on nicehash and a hadfull of other coins that iv mined so far, same as you not a big fortune but its getting bigger by the day üòÜ

[25-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> In 6 moths i only managed to mine 573 etn coins

[25-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Worth only about ¬£5 now but it helped me get in to mining so i happy with what i got

[25-Jul-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> About the cpu instruction set, you will need to check your cpu and make sure its got the aes and or avx instructions set on it , the wallet wont work without them

[25-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I used speccy to find out under the cpu section but theres loads of programs out there to check if you dont like speccy

[25-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> One more thing about solo mining is you wont get any rewards at all untill you find a block, it could take days or weeks depending on your own hashrate , but the rewards are big if you do

[25-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> We‚Äôre in the starting phase of what looks to become a very good community:)

[25-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Hopefully pools will open soon after the halfing and we can start to get more regular rewards

[25-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I will second that @Lucivere

[25-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> And congratulations on finding a block all ready, will you be sharing the block with your daughter after all it is her laptop , or are you keeping it quiet üòÅüòÜ
