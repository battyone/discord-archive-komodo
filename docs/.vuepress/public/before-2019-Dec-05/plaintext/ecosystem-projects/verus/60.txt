[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> it's going to be months for things to be resolved on convincing a manufacturer

[04-Dec-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A vast majority of p o w earned coin would be sent to China at a huge discount

[04-Dec-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> so continue to expect 20TH and up hashrate

[04-Dec-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bishop i wish everyone would think that so if it's sooner more people will be happy

[04-Dec-18 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> The manufacturer isnt mining, there are people all over the world enjoying some verus. There, decentralization üëè

[04-Dec-18 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> yeah im not sure why your focused on china lol

[04-Dec-18 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Yii this is our understanding as well. i will go back to working on options. i just thought it would make sense to talk about this. i'll check back to see if i can answer more questions a bit later.

[04-Dec-18 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> My concern is the effect on price and growth of the project moving forward. Hopefully this is something insignificant and not catastrophic

[04-Dec-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @miketout I would love to be surprised but I know the lead-time involved with hardware. They're not magically going to have something ready in a couple weeks

[04-Dec-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> It's fine that you are having the discussion with them but multiple months at best is a very reasonable timeframe, absent a fork

[04-Dec-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> The price declined fromm 9k to 4k before they went online, and is stable now, what do you think

[04-Dec-18 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Godballz I strongly believe this too will pass. we need to keep our eye on the goal of decentralization and realizing the vision. these algorithms are a way to get there, and there are many factors to consider as a project evolves. I guess that's what keeps life interesting üòÉ

[04-Dec-18 05:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I really like the algo too and the balance it provides between GPU and CPU. Hope that stays true at least. It is a cool and unique feature

[04-Dec-18 05:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bishop honestly, i wish everyone would believe that üòÉ we will have nowhere to go but up in that case

[04-Dec-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @Godballz GPUs and CPUs can continue to play in the same ball league... except it's little league and the majors are 30x larger

[04-Dec-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> üòâ

[04-Dec-18 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I know my fear is it having an effect on how the project was designed to work. I will continue to mine and stake I just fear that little guy miners like myself might find it makes more sense to mind something else, sell it to buy verus, and stake rather than mine- leaving the mining for the fpga and the staking for everybody else

[04-Dec-18 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I also want to be clear. we do not have an agreement yet that allows us to say this is solved. i think it would be better to strike some cooperation that can make the best mining accessible to as many as possible and keep CPUs and GPUs an option. if we can't find a way that we believe is good for the community, we will have to fork with an algo that bricks them. everyone should know, as we do, that that will also postpone and likely complicate any ultimate solution

[04-Dec-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Makes sense. Thank you for having the conversation openly I imagine there are many difficult decisions that need to be made. I feel bad even raising my concerns now but it is probably best we have this discussion sooner rather than later like you said Mike the next round could be worse

[04-Dec-18 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if you or anyone else has concerns, you are almost certainly not the only one, so it's good to be able to talk about them

[04-Dec-18 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> so verus now have fpga

[04-Dec-18 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> what's the timeframe on community vote?

[04-Dec-18 05:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we will have a plan, and we will discuss with the community. we are a community coin with community resources. i will be willing to code what i believe is the correct, or a good solution for the community. hopefully the community will work to get consensus and we won't have a reason to need an official contentious vote. how about we wait until there are options with more info?

[04-Dec-18 05:20 AM] actionslacks#4072
There was a guy who I think was fpga mining litecoin back in 2014 or so and was selling shares, kind of like one of the original cloud miners in a sense. I would think that the technical aptitude necessary to fpga mine would be a barrier to entry for most but I have no idea. Just wanted to mention it.

[04-Dec-18 05:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I'm having difficulty understanding why FPGA-folk would honor a "slow down" agreement.

[04-Dec-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if we change the algo, they will need to run the modified algo. i am working on how to slow down what an FPGA can do with a VerusHash V2

[04-Dec-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> relative to CPUs and GPUs

[04-Dec-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> So then it's a fork.

[04-Dec-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Is memory the primary weakness to an fpga?

[04-Dec-18 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> Yes @Godballz

[04-Dec-18 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it is a major weakness and raises the cost of any similar type of equipment, but just until the device with memory takes over.

[04-Dec-18 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh okay so that might not be the best route Because the next round of fpga would create a higher entry barrier

[04-Dec-18 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> But take and gpu/cpu combo with an fpga accelerator and you‚Äôre back to square one anyway

[04-Dec-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I'd like to see continued forks until 24 rewards are over, at least. Hoping more people have time to get involved and spread out staking shares. But it's a double edge sword, because FPGAs lower exchange prices, which mean people should be able to buy more. Worst case, we get some people with large volume that plays with the market prices later on.

[04-Dec-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> At some point fpga's will be sold like gpus - the floodgates are open - 2019 will be a harder time for gpus than 2018 i think

[04-Dec-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> Yup, there‚Äôs enough of a demand this time around to make them stay

[04-Dec-18 05:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
Ltcgear, that was the name. There‚Äôs some bct threads. A little history on fpga mining.

[04-Dec-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Rather much more shitcoins on the market than 2013

[04-Dec-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @zpajk i have to be careful talking about the future plans too much to get people too excited about the future vs. what we have, but if you could fully understand the alternative things those resources would be moving forward if not regularly forking, you would likely have a different opinion.

[04-Dec-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Might. I held Electroneum while they made a few mistakes and made themselves ASIC-dependent. It really screwed a lot of holders over. But I see FPGAs as being very useful for blockchain as a whole moving forward, if they become more common. But small projects that don't actually need the hashrate should try to avoid them if decentralization is intended. At this point in time. I don't doubt things will happen in 2019-2020 that could sway my opinion.

[04-Dec-18 06:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Hard fork FPGAs asap and start thinking about algo change that could wipe them off the grid forever afterwards. No negotiation is possible, FPGAs with such a hashrate can't be part of the network that is community driven, as they destroy economical incentive to be a part of the community for all but their owners, so basically limits the possible growth of our community.

[04-Dec-18 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> I personally disagree, I myself am a GPU miner and have 3 - 6 card rigs which are currently mining nothing but dust as the power cost outweighs the income. I have purchased an F1 FPGA mainly because it is very similar to GPU's as it can mine many different algo's but much more efficiently. I dont think this is something that can be fought and more time will be spent on "forking" and less time will be spent on the actual project. If it aint broke dont fix it. It's like trying to fork away from newer GPU's or CPU's because the hashrate is much higher. Embrace change or you will be left behind and become another project that has no volume.

[04-Dec-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> FPGA isn't for the common person yet. You're talking about limiting great network hash to few. Point of limiting to CPU/GPU is that "everyone" has one or can get it, unlike FPGAs.

[04-Dec-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It seems like you guys have covered, almost every angle. If you want to eliminate FPGAs, make them riskier to buy, in the first place. Miners think in terms of ROI, and if this can't be accounted for, for sure--then it might have a significant impact on the sales & ultimately their usage w/Verus...

[04-Dec-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @eNOz  But Verus was created with VerusHash, which put CPU & GPU hash levels on an even playing field

[04-Dec-18 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> That is a core idea of the project

[04-Dec-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> @Cruz  is that the "use case" though or only reason for mining it?

[04-Dec-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> Not being a dick just asking

[04-Dec-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> cause I only heard about this project VIA the F1 discord

[04-Dec-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @eNOz No, you're good

[04-Dec-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> without them I wouldnt be here

[04-Dec-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Can you explain what you mean, by use case?

[04-Dec-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Sorry, I'm not trying to be a dick, either

[04-Dec-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> what is the core use of the coin?

[04-Dec-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> other than another digital currency that can be mined

[04-Dec-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> because there are 1000's of those

[04-Dec-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> VerusCoin ultimately will be used, as an example, to secure voting through its secure block chain

[04-Dec-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Getting to that point, there are many other aspects of the project

[04-Dec-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> This isn't a run of the mill project

[04-Dec-18 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Look at the lead dev's experience and you'll understand that

[04-Dec-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> @ok88 good luck with that, the devs will have to dedicate s lot of time accomplishing that and the actual project wont move forward. As someone said: you can run, but you cant hide

[04-Dec-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I understand that miners play a role, in crypto, too..
I'm not anti-miner

[04-Dec-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Yii I'm sure that can be done. It'd be better to focus on a project with a weak dev team....just my advice

[04-Dec-18 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Dont get your sentence, who should focus on what?

[04-Dec-18 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> People with FPGA/People that make FPGA should focus on a weaker project .... I know designing these is for the reason to make more money

[04-Dec-18 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Everything is about money. Gpu miners want to make money, cpu miners, asic/fpga miners, software dev for mining applications. Everyone

[04-Dec-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> FPGA want more money though

[04-Dec-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> That doesnt make much sense

[04-Dec-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Which means more influence

[04-Dec-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I vote that the community is more important for the development of this coin than fgpa adoption

[04-Dec-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> A fpga miner is most likely a gpu/cpu miner as well

[04-Dec-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Let's fork the shit out of it

[04-Dec-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Yii But with more capability.. so it's not

[04-Dec-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> More capability?

[04-Dec-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ok88 totally agree

[04-Dec-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Why not mine something like Digitex? lol

[04-Dec-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> I dont get you, nevermind

[04-Dec-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> FPGA ‚â† VerusCoin

[04-Dec-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Fpgas might not be able to do a 51% attack but they can drive the coin down and then do a pump and dump, if they control enough of it.

[04-Dec-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> It has a algorithm which can be cpu/gpu mined, there will always be someone which invents a miner which is better

[04-Dec-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> luckily its not asic

[04-Dec-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> how about randomJS research by monero

[04-Dec-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout let's just folk it now before all the coin is in the hands of a few rich miners

[04-Dec-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> to remove fpga and asic

[04-Dec-18 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I can't see the benefit of working with these massive fgpa miners

[04-Dec-18 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> It's like trying to help get the coin locked up by asic  miners

[04-Dec-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Yeah, please fork it. Cant buy a gpu right now, please only cpu mineable or ill get angry on the huge gpu farms in china

[04-Dec-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I'm actually thinking about selling all my vrsc.

[04-Dec-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Yii FPGAs owners have no voice on this as they are basically cheaters that we as the community are trying to get rid of the community in the first place. If the gates developer would at last have half a gut to admit its creation my opinion would differ. Secretely mining is an instakill for those bastards as this have no single point in common with the vision the devs or community have on this project. Do not dare to compare this to the GPU miner developements that we had here, that were openly tested, announced and perfected to its current state. You just dont dare. We should have a hard fork as soon as its ready and plan no dates, no schedules and give no hope to the likes of scum that act in the full opposition to what we have achieved here as the community. Just fork it whenever we are ready and start back from solo mining on wallets, no problem with that - active community members will adopt the change in no time.

[04-Dec-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Because as a few people get all the coin, it will be worthless and controlled by them and impossible for anyone else to mine.

[04-Dec-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @ok88 Amen

[04-Dec-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I'm going to try and learn those exchanges later on today

[04-Dec-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ok88 either this happens soon or I'm finding myself a new project

[04-Dec-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Gloryman Stay for Emery!!

[04-Dec-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> lol

[04-Dec-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> It would be good if they made this coin cpu from wallet only.

[04-Dec-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> What is emery?

[04-Dec-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Unai Emery... your skipper.. Arsenal

[04-Dec-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Yeah as i said, good luck with that. As More developers will get into the game, they will work on algos simultaniously. It took 2 guys 2-3 weeks to develop it, what do you think can secret mining ops with huge amount of money do? luckily the people who mined verus have at least just one machine and got some verus. Than it will be just one operation and you dont know what hit you, but ok

[04-Dec-18 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Lol
