[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Well it‚Äôs okay to question, no one is suggesting blind belief or support üòÉ

[04-Dec-18 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the discussion is great. i feel there are ulterior motives when it becomes a long term pattern

[04-Dec-18 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> But there‚Äôs a diff between discussing, questioning, even challenging...and stirring things up, fud, etc without a clear purpose of helping or contributing to the discussion besides perhaps alt motives

[04-Dec-18 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> @John Westbrook That's exactly right

[04-Dec-18 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> To get people pissed off, for no reason

[04-Dec-18 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> I know Dukeleto from early Hush days. Please don't judge, he's a good dev. Let's not FUD on people. Respect ‚úå

[04-Dec-18 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> @Emmanuel Where was the respect for Mike?

[04-Dec-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Tommygun007> @miktout you have done lots i mean lots for this coin i would not take any personal offence to what one may say or imply just be the better person and brush it off and keep doing what you do best.  Mike you do a lot of great work from helping beginers such as myself to begin the mining process as well as working out whatever bugs may occur with the coin..so if anything just move on and keep doing what your doing don't let one persons opinion get to you.  You know you do a great job so no worries it will all be good again soon.

[04-Dec-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> I'm talking from everyone. Respect and no FUD, from everybody.

[04-Dec-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> iv researched quite a lot on verus , some goes over my head , some clicks very easily , i admire what iv found on my research binges , certainly wouldnt think of it as blind faith but ,ok

[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Bear market derangement syndrome is a thing.

[04-Dec-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I don‚Äôt know if/what any motives would be, but it‚Äôs hard to see clearly through the fudfog to get to productive talk

[04-Dec-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> and i think it‚Äôs appropriate to call it out if it‚Äôs there

[04-Dec-18 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> good @stretcher83 ! Exactly how to approach it, good to know people are really doing their research and coming from a solid place

[05-Dec-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thanks all üòÉ I appreciate your comments and will delete a few of my own to not air dirty laundry in the process. I was also in HUSH in the early days and had much reason to respect and admire Duke when I started this. It would have been great to see things evolve differently.

[05-Dec-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> iv still got a lot to learn üòÑ

[05-Dec-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I have been trying to think of what benefit someone would have spreading fud. It seems like there is none. The only thing I could come up with is fear. It only means they are heavily invested and are afraid of what might happen so they spread fud in order to get people behind them to rally on what they believe is the right course of action which of course isn't necessarily the best for a community

[05-Dec-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Tommygun007> fud=sell

[05-Dec-18 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Tommygun007> that's basically what happens people spread fud and then weak hands panic and sell

[05-Dec-18 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Sometimes there are agendas totally invisible to others @Godballz

[05-Dec-18 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That is true @John Westbrook

[05-Dec-18 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> So---how does everyone feel about FPGA?

[05-Dec-18 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Just one sentence or two

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> lol

[05-Dec-18 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> i feel worse about them now than i did before , secretly mining and pourpesly hiding it from us , sketchy bunch, obviusly , not the fpga's fault , üòÑ  just the operators

[05-Dec-18 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i think if we get the right agreement, and especially if we can achieve the changes I'm hoping for, we will have made the transition without facing another in the near future. i believe the right agreement cannot cut out the community of miners we have now, and it cannot make the entire project dependent on any one company

[05-Dec-18 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if we can't get the right agreement, then i feel we need to fork away and work towards our own FPGA solution

[05-Dec-18 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> maybe a pic from 30,000 feet will lighten the conversation...anyone ever seen a raincircle? (rainbow circular)

[05-Dec-18 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> @miketout Do you think you will be able to please them both?

[05-Dec-18 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> both?

[05-Dec-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> FPGA company and our miners

[05-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's not about pleasing them both to me, so i am not thinking about pleasing as much as making it the best option forward for the community of miners in light of some upcoming transition to new hardware, and giving the company an option that makes it in their interest to support the Verus community.

[05-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i know that some people will not be happy either way

[05-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Sorry, poor word selection

[05-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not a problem and not trying to be pedantic üòÉ

[05-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> It does make a difference. I understand

[05-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> It sounds like you have every situation sort of mapped out

[05-Dec-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Thanks Mike.

[05-Dec-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> I know this isn't something we planned for.

[05-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i believe a low price of entry for mining Verus with specialized hardware will be good for the community, and if we can achieve continued viability of casual mining on CPUs and GPUs, which could then be profitable with coming changes or a bull market, that would be ideal

[05-Dec-18 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i also believe if we can't find a way to resolve it by turning it into an opportunity, then it will cost us more in resources and time to the real vision. that doesn't mean we should accept something that isn't good long term for the community

[05-Dec-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> The community did get what, 6-7 months, of CPU & GPU, no Asics or FPGA?

[05-Dec-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> That means those that have been here, probably have taken advantage of this.

[05-Dec-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i don't think it's a burden of proof issue at all. we have made no claims to justify such a statement. i think it's a matter of looking at the reality we find ourselves in and making the best decision we can make for the future. I actually believe as @jl777c said that if we can make this transition in a positive way, it can be a major positive for Verus Coin and the Verus Project, but I don't want that opportunity to cloud my judgement into wanting to accept something unless it is good long term

[05-Dec-18 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> @miketout I agree with JL777, in that we (all of us) should move forward, on a positive note. So speak up, if you have an opinion on this matter. Everyones opinion in this community matters

[05-Dec-18 12:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Maybe we should consult hardware specialists.

[05-Dec-18 12:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> I personally think that today's processors are crap. Much more than what we believe.

[05-Dec-18 12:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> And probably people should quit trying to mine with them. But I can't know that for sure, because I'm no hardware expert.

[05-Dec-18 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It definitely puts stress on them, yeah

[05-Dec-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> This could be an opportunity for some miners

[05-Dec-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> In a way we are...at least in talks with hardware specialists (i.e. the hashalt guys) üòÉ

[05-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> that‚Äôs one of the points of reaching out to them

[05-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I am working with multiple people who can design FPGA code, and I feel like we have a good handle on things with people that I know won‚Äôt have conflicts or if they do I know what they are. I‚Äôm interested in talking to other real hardware experts, of course, but i do know some, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wise to show our full hand before an agreement.

[05-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> I mean, CPU is probably already dead in the water, and it's a lost cause. That would be a terrible scenario if Verus decides to keep fighting back FPGA supremacy.

[05-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> CPU may yet have more life than people think. No guarantee now, but with some changes I‚Äôm looking at, CPU is likely to have the biggest benefit, and possibly a big one at that. FPGA‚Äôs, if not blocked will still be fastest by some amount.

[05-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @miketout Really, CPU?

[05-Dec-18 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Nice

[05-Dec-18 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> There was no harassment, only explanation of my issues with your behavior relative to the community and truthful communication intended not to embarrass you, but inform in case you had a different perspective to explain. I welcome anyone to follow the link to see your advertised dirty laundry if they have any concerns. Personally, I prefer to take up beefs with people in private than to air in public, as I believe being honest, which doesn't always need to happen in public, is the first step towards a chance for something to improve. I have no shame for what I said trying to hash it out with you and give you a chance to respond without involving everyone in the discussion. That you choose to seek attention and share this way up to you. I consider your taking an argument to the community a negative, and I suspect I am not the only one. I will leave this post here unless people in the community would like both deleted.

[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I think its childish posting the PM conversation

[05-Dec-18 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Until the decision is ultimately decided, in all fairness, it's probably wise to remove references to CPU and GPU mining as it isn't viable at all (well, right now it is due to the F1s shutdown). You don't see Bitcoin listing CPU and GPU mining because it isn't practical. A 30x multiplier on top of the line CPUs/GPUs  with the F1s. By all means, altruistic miners continue mining at a loss but you are better of mining nearly anything else and exchanging to Verus than mining directly (again, shutdown aside).

Latest word on the street is the @VerusCoin mining network has been taken over by FPGA miners. 20-40X power efficiency and ~50X the hashrate of high end CPUs + GPUs, it's not looking good for CPU/GPU miners. What happens next?
