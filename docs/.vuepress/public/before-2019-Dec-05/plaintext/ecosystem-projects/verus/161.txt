[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @CryptoYeti it is almost like you don‚Äôt want certain people pointing out holes in your stories any more. Would love to see a video of the device hashing away and connecting to a pool within a week. xD

[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 4 Pin and 6 Pin have different pin out...?

[10-May-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> And you are ramming a 6 pin into a 4 pin connector?

[10-May-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Is this FUD @CryptoYeti

[10-May-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Or.....

[10-May-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Isn't it the same pinout? Except, the "See note" pin? Between the PCIe 6/8.

[10-May-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> They are up the other way

[10-May-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Like 12v on top instead of bottom.

[10-May-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> it'll probably do -70MHs now

[10-May-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Reverse of 0 is still 0....

[10-May-19 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Ehm... yeah, + on top. I'm clueless then.

[10-May-19 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Even if they have pinned it out the same as a 6 pin this will no doubt have very bad results as if someone less knowledgeable receives theirs then sees a 4 pin connector and puts one in....

[10-May-19 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Thing that say: Boom!!!

[10-May-19 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I don't get why they even fit to begin with... Depending on the female housing, that is..

[10-May-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @zpajk  the 6 pin will go in as the 4 pin has the square, the 6/8 pin has the corners cut so it will fit in

[10-May-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> but a 4 pin wont go in a 6/8 pin

[10-May-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Either way, They are called "Standards" for a reason you don't go messing with or mixing them xD

[10-May-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> But hey what would I know I just filled their discord with FUD. Never brought up anything worth clarification @CryptoYeti

[10-May-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> you are not supposed to use 6-pin connector in 4-pin socket.

[10-May-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @paia  Yet they have it pictured using a 6-pin connector in it....

[10-May-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> See why I am questioning this...

[10-May-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> another bad design?

[10-May-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> well, I am trying to comprehend how it is working with a "Standard" 4 pin connector and a 6 Pin power in it.

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Reminds of of those tests in kindergarten, trying to put a square peg in a circle-shape hole...

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> "Jammed with FUD" these guys are definitely burning up any potential benefit of the doubt left for them at this point

[10-May-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> 2  months late on original ship date, can't keep their own replies consistent, but FUD!

[10-May-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I feel like most things I mentioned in there had substantial reasoning and proof behind it. -__-

[10-May-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> There may have been a couple times I could have been considered unreasonable. But most like this power connector query had good backing.

[10-May-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> IMO "fudding" would not have started if communication had been clear from the start...

[10-May-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I think that it should at least be considered: Removing the announcements advertising ukminer in light of the current situation and behavior

[10-May-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Patrick Crypto I‚Äôll do that shortly and try to reach them as well.

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Ginasis Mining Pools As many of you already know, I might also start selling my Verus2 FPGA soon, I¬¥ll post some test board pictures in a minute. Hashrates are secret for now, though, as I have some custom board designs that I¬¥m testing out. Looking good though üòÉ https://grizzlyminer.com/ is my shop. Only small scale store, though.

[10-May-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> And I¬¥ve been testing it since about December last year, so it works quite nicely now.

[10-May-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôld love to see how it performs...

[10-May-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> On my Mac it does about the same as CCMiner, so no big surprises there.

[10-May-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Did you already compile for Linux or Windows?

[10-May-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> But I needed to learn how the algo work (and have some fun too üòÉ ..) so I did not just want to build on nheqminer of ccminer

[10-May-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Very nice

[10-May-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We should move to #mining-dev by the way

[10-May-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> It compiles for Linux and Mac.

[10-May-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> kk, I¬¥ll continue in #mining-dev np

[11-May-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> is anyone awake? lol

[11-May-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm sleeptyping..

[11-May-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i just downloaded the whole blockcain and started mining. im guessing the local mega hash is my speed?

[11-May-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> using the GUI

[11-May-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, it is. You are mining with the wallet?

[11-May-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> yes

[11-May-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You could also explore the option of using an external miner to do poolmining. That may get you started on gathering VRCS a bit quicker on the start

[11-May-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> im getting 18.008 on a ryzen 7 1800X using 12 threads

[11-May-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> will it change on the fly?

[11-May-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> or do i have to stop mining

[11-May-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, it will

[11-May-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> tryin 14 now

[11-May-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> what does the Start STaking button do?

[11-May-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> Staking*

[11-May-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you have coins, it will secure the chain. If you stake a block you get the same reward as you would mining a block

[11-May-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so when should i click it

[11-May-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The Verus chain is 50% PoW (mining) and 50% PoS (staking)
