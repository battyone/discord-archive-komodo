[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> that can be a really good place to be @GlorymanRTS in regards to helping others who don't know much

[31-Jan-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> if you can learn enough to accurately help people and simplify it for them

[31-Jan-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook sure I don't mind helping and trying

[31-Jan-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> part of the challenge for people who get more and more entrenched in complex technology is sort of the disconnect in how to explain it in simple terms

[31-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> cos the questions don't happen for them anymore

[31-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I'm on track to getting around 2000 hours of watchable stream

[31-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> they are creating stuff and don't need to see it from the angle of a noob

[31-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> nice

[31-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> <https://www.popsci.com/giant-boom-polar-vortex-frost-quake>
Yay, I don't have to worry about earthquakes anymore ðŸ˜‚
ok, enough distractions, you guys enjoy...

[31-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> actually the guys I usually stream to don't need simplification. They are some of the best coders in the world

[31-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I'm happy to help you if you have certain topic etc, you could pick my brain

[31-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> oh, cool!

[31-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> is it relevant tho?

[31-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> you stream poker games?

[31-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> The guys that watch my RTS games are like top level academics and computer scientists, lol

[31-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> oh awesome

[31-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook yeah, poker stream is not too popular at the moment

[31-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> so the real challenge is to explain things in a way that they don't discredit you?

[31-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> oh rts games I missed that in my tired fog

[31-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I will ask them to pop by sometime. One of them said he wasn't interested because he's doing too much academic work and doesnt want to do much elese

[31-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Another said he prefers to code computer games

[31-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Another said he wants to design games instead

[31-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> well, gotta do what you love

[31-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Oh there is one guy who said he would pop by

[31-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> let me find his youtube. really nice guy

[31-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> cool

[31-Jan-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> his name is warren

[31-Jan-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> he played that RTS final 2v2 on my stream

[31-Jan-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> He mainly codes websites

[31-Jan-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I think he went to harvard

[31-Jan-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I'd imagine if the acedemians understood what Verus is about and is so far, they may find it quite fascinating

[31-Jan-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> as you can see by my spelling, I'm not one

[31-Jan-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> cool

[31-Jan-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> as for coding, I mainly do websites as well

[31-Jan-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> they do. but they often are busy doing really importants stuff or just stuff they find more amusing.

[31-Jan-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> i prefer building things from scratch, regionally where I am in the usa there's not much business for that

[31-Jan-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I can also feel a bit guilty about asking them because they usually play RTS to relax

[31-Jan-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Not to be asked to work! lol

[31-Jan-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> people are cheap and have the owner's son or whoevever do the wordpress stuff lol

[31-Jan-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> ah yeah

[31-Jan-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> speaking of work, I'll chat later ðŸ˜ƒ

[31-Jan-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> good questions and hopefully my explanations were helpful!

[31-Jan-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook catch you later buddy

[dscrdvrsc] <mountaindrifter> Is there information somewhere about the security issue that was resolved with the recent update, however vague it may be

[31-Jan-19 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @mountaindrifter I would imagine if we hear anything it would be well after most have upgraded to the new version. I'm sure many users haven't had the chance and it wouldn't be good to reveal a potential exploit so soon

[31-Jan-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thinking about the z-transaction/t-transaction thing, one good thing about z-transactions is that it would ease the suspicions of a few that some exchanges could be staking. So that's a plus, along with being untraceable.

[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> @hellcatz hey nice pool. It's been standing up to all of my abuse. API is great also

[31-Jan-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> haha,  if you break it,  i will fix it ðŸ˜„

[31-Jan-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> is that a challenge? ðŸ˜‰

[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> I'm thinking about trying pinned docker containers so I'd have around 20,000 workers

[31-Jan-19 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> you think that's safe?

[31-Jan-19 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> Interesting, it should be fine.  If you start getting connection issues let me know.  We may hit some unknown limit.

[31-Jan-19 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> good deal. Will test it out first to make sure it's actually faster

[31-Jan-19 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> If you do run into connection problem, you can always send some workers to the alternate stratums around world.
Thanks for playing, happy to help!

[01-Feb-19 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Question: Is Verus' explorer as comprehensive/functional as other explorers in the crypto space? i.e: can one view what amounts individual addresses/wallets hold on the blockchain? And also, is it possible to determine that a group of addresses belong to the same wallet? e.g: can it be determined, without having access to one's Agama wallet, that all 100 addresses that come with that wallet belong to one wallet/account, simply by viewing the explorer?

[01-Feb-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jintaa yes and no. it is possible to track connections between transparent addresses, but when they go into the private pool of funds, any direct connection to their source or destination is broken. Still, with deeper analysis, it is also possible to track some funds into the pool and assign probability of those transfers being related to others of similar amounts out shortly after being somehow related. Having both transparent and private addresses makes privacy possible, but unless you have a forced, fully private chain, like Pirate, which then has some challenges with programmability, you may be able to analyze to some degree, unless people are trying to preserve privacy intentionally.

[01-Feb-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Ok, @miketout , how about being able to determine if the 100 addresses assigned to an agama wallet all belong to the same wallet, just by looking at the explorer? Are the addresses randomly assigned to each wallet, or are they somehow linked, even on the blockchain/explorer?

[01-Feb-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> wallets generate addresses that cant be linked

[01-Feb-19 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> however usage can end up linking them, especially via change

[01-Feb-19 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> or using multiple addresses as vin inputs

[01-Feb-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> what I see on BTC is that some entity is sending small tainted dust amounts 0,000005 to the largest BTC addresses. then when these wallets do a spend, the tainted dust is spent and creates a linkage to the other input addresses and output addresses

[01-Feb-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> this allows construction (over time) a pretty accurate statistical mapping of email address to BTC address

[01-Feb-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and ip address

[01-Feb-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @jl777c buddy can i ask your opinion on something.

[01-Feb-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> combine this with the KYC info that exchanges (and hackers) have and transparent addresses, lives up to its name

[01-Feb-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> of course, not everyone and certainly not the explorers will have access to the ip router level correlations or exchange KYC info

[01-Feb-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @jl777c If I put most of my verus on a sale order on verus at 3100 hoping it will sell and then the price will go lower in future, so I can buy. Do you think  that is a good trading strategy?

[01-Feb-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> can you predict when the bear market ends?

[01-Feb-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> if you can, just sell all crypto and buy back the moment the bear market ends

[01-Feb-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @jl777c not using technical analysis or fundemental analysis.

[01-Feb-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> you need to use psychic powers to determine the exact end of bear market

[01-Feb-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> if you dont have such powers, then best to cost average while the price is low

[01-Feb-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> thanks buddy

[01-Feb-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @GlorymanRTS What you proposed is gambling, unless you have enough to control the market, thus minimizing the risk.

[01-Feb-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> So, it's gambling but it could pay off?

[01-Feb-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> With my luck whenever I'd sell it would be right before a bull run.

[01-Feb-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> But if there is a bull run, the price will come back down in future and u can just buy again when the price is low right?

[01-Feb-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> If it were that simple. It's a gamble either way.

[01-Feb-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Someone has to be willing to buy at the price you're selling, and someone has to be willing to sell at the price you're buying. Pure and simple.

[01-Feb-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @zpajk thanks for it advice buddy, it's appreciated.

[01-Feb-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> ``1000 VRSC sell at 0,00003100 BTC = 0,031 BTC
0,031 BTC buy back at 0,00002500 BTC = 1240 VRSC``
240 VRSC gain, if it goes through. Only you can determine if it's worth the risk. Multiply that with whatever the amount you were thinking. But greater amount would equal less chance of hitting full bids/asks because of the low volume on the exchanges.

[01-Feb-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> This is called market making. You can do it with any commodity. Most commodities are more heavily traded than Verus so the spread is not so wide and they are less profitable

[01-Feb-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> But there are companies which exist to do exactly what is described here and they certainly are profitable

[01-Feb-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> The wrinkle is that you need to consistently be the top of book at the bid and the ask, which means you need to fight with others (read: bots) trying to do the exact same thing

[01-Feb-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> The other risk is that the underlying commodity moves out of the channel you have identified. It's hard to estimate the size of that risk for Verus

[01-Feb-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> I notice that the new wallet seems to connect to 5 peers by default. Is there a list of additional reliable peers?

[01-Feb-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I'm the most reliable peer i guess. ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‡

[01-Feb-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gamer278> What is the difference in connections? since the start of mining verus back over the summer I always had 4 connections. After upgrading to 0.5.5 i know have 5 connections. Any benefit to more connections?

[01-Feb-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> yes, more connections means that new blocks will propagate to you faster

[01-Feb-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> reduces the time you spend mining stale blocks

[02-Feb-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's a great benefit to all 'full node' operators like pool operators, explorers and such (also for the electrum servers respectively the vrsc nodes behind). before it was rather hard to build up a number of connections. now, it's much easier

[02-Feb-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and while the increase by 1 on your local end won't do much difference for you guys but in some edge cases where 4 of the 5 are not responding (), my pool went from cancering around 4-8 connections to >15 right after relaunch with the new release

[02-Feb-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> this is a slight change that makes me very happy ðŸ˜ƒ

[02-Feb-19 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> every staking wallet is a full node
