[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I think mine would still work, I just have an issue with the floppy, it's on endless loop ... guess one of the ICs should be replaced.

[22-Apr-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> and cleaned!

[22-Apr-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> clickety clickety click...

[22-Apr-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> already did that, didn't help

[22-Apr-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> and I'm not a master in soldering, so I refrained from removing the IC myself üòâ

[22-Apr-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> oh, that was another device... That was the ZIP drive... Click of death...

[22-Apr-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> oh, ZIPs ... I hated them. Totally unstable and always broken when you needed them.

[22-Apr-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I har a firewire version, worked reliably for 5  or 6 years...

[22-Apr-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> we just had SCSIs

[22-Apr-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> external

[22-Apr-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> My father in law had the combined SCSI/parallel version

[22-Apr-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That was a disaster!

[22-Apr-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> probably same ... just remember SCSI, but may have been that one though

[22-Apr-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You had a parallel, SCSI and a combined one... That was about ??? al lot more expensive

[22-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> we had them ad university, for data backup ... well, was more of data breakdown after all

[22-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The firewire I had from work: one of my colleagues was a soldering whizzkid and replaced the parallel interface for a firewire interface for me

[22-Apr-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> we switched to tape instead üòâ

[22-Apr-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> After that you had the Jazz-drive... I never thoughed that one, though

[22-Apr-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> those had enormous capacities, compared to other media at that time

[22-Apr-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Tapes were just as unreliable.... Our Sa's never bothered to verify the backup every once in a while....

[22-Apr-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> did he? Hm, never had issues with those

[22-Apr-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And when they needed them.... They turned out to be corrupt...

[22-Apr-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> the trick was an antimagnetic casing ^^

[22-Apr-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> or rather a magnetic shielding, to put that in proper terms

[22-Apr-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you don't regularly replace the tapes with fresh tapes... After 4 years of continuoes use you cannot expect them to hold all the data

[22-Apr-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hm, can't remember a single tape that was corrupt... we used them for about 5 years before CDs came up

[22-Apr-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> but those were much less reliable

[22-Apr-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> especially the first versions

[22-Apr-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We reccommended to replace your DLT tapes every 2 years for a fresh set

[22-Apr-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We never really used CD for backups, unless a customer wanted a copy. Then we'ld supply them a CD/DVD

[22-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> one of the Professors recommended to print the data, which he considered to be the safest way... we made a joke and made a printout of a program in assembler code and asked him if he could put it back into the computer ... after that, the ZIP drives came in ^^

[22-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hihihihi... Just supply the good professor with a thermal printer... Gnagnagna

[22-Apr-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hot needles... oh yeah

[22-Apr-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just like your cash receipt from a supermarket... Leave it in the car for a week during summer.... Not readable!

[22-Apr-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> doesn't need summer, a strong source of light will be enough

[22-Apr-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> indeed.... I would love to see that professors face when he finds out!

[22-Apr-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> or a weak source and time

[22-Apr-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yeah, that's also what I'm always angry about ... you need the bill for guarantee things, but after a year it's bleached ... great

[22-Apr-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I always scan an copy bills I may need for warranty in the future

[22-Apr-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And staple the original to the copy

[22-Apr-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> i just put them in aluminum foil... also works ... but it's not a treat anyway

[22-Apr-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But, proof of payment should be sufficient, so if you can produce a bankstatement with the payment on it, it should suffice.... Most stores don't accept it without a fuss, though

[22-Apr-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> luckily most cases happen within the first 2 or 3 weeks, and at least the discounters don't make much fuzz if you bring their stuff back... they just pay you back and put it back into the shelf again... üò¶

[22-Apr-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yeah, indeed. At those places I rummage through until  I find a box that isn't tampered with

[22-Apr-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ok, time for coffee and sun... l8er m8 ^^

[23-Apr-19 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Good news everyone! I'll have the Verus physical coins in my hands on Wednesday! Which means I'll have the orders shipped out by Thursday or Friday!

[23-Apr-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> good

[23-Apr-19 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yay  @Draeth!

[23-Apr-19 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Congrats to the first ever PBaaS chains too! Wooooooo!!

[23-Apr-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thanks @Godballz ! The first ever PBaaS chains shared by the entire community! Stop by the #pbaas-development channel and try a little merge mining. The PBaaS chain LOTSOFCOINS will start emitting 1000 coins per block as soon as VRSCTEST passes block 408.

[23-Apr-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> lol

[23-Apr-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> why does this website say verus2?  whats the difference between verus and verus2

[23-Apr-19 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> VerusHash 2.0 significantly equalized FPGA performance with CPUs

[23-Apr-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> what exchanges accept veruscoin?

[23-Apr-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> https://digitalprice.io/order?url=vrsc-btc

[23-Apr-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> most active exchange for vrsc currently

[23-Apr-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> thanks

[23-Apr-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> nice only .2% fee

[23-Apr-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Digital Price, Crypto-Bridge, Stex and AAcoin. Just to name them all.

[23-Apr-19 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Congratulations @miketout  and @team  ! Amazing work with PBaaS testchains already available after just ten months since Verus¬¥s release. It¬¥s been fun and inspiring to watch the amazing progress that this project has made in such a short time, and I¬¥m looking forward to the day Verus¬¥s PBaaS goes live üôè #announcements

[23-Apr-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Congrats @team  Great job.... I'll start testing ASAP and spread te word!

[23-Apr-19 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And Arrrrrr, @Draeth ! It's raining good news. Only thing that can make it better is shipping news from UKminer...

[23-Apr-19 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> heh, ukminer isnt the only fpga üòâ

[23-Apr-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> May 5th, ü§û

[23-Apr-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <13HARGA‚àö> Whats there on May 5th?

[23-Apr-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I'd guess the Blackminer F1 Mini. *"The first batch is only 300 units and will be shipped on May 5, 2019."*

[23-Apr-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thanks @Crupti @Oink and all! Stop by the #pbaas-development channel and try some merge mining üòÉ

[23-Apr-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I had to google merge mining https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/guides/what-is-merged-mining-bitcoin-namecoin-litecoin-dogecoin/

What is merged mining ‚Äì Bitcoin & Namecoin ‚Äì Litecoin & Dogecoin?
Merged mining is the process of allowing two different crypto currencies based on the same algorithm to be mined simultaneously.

[23-Apr-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> You learn something new every day in crypto üòÉ

[23-Apr-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @miketout  Will merge mining be possible on every PBaaS chain after Verus goes live or just now on testchains?

[23-Apr-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yes. this is the only system I know of that allows you to dynamically merge mine up to 15 chains, and when PBaaS goes live you will still be able to connect to and merge mine up to 15 chains on any source of hash power

[23-Apr-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> merge mining is great with p2pool

[23-Apr-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> they killed auxpow though

[23-Apr-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> so returns are shit compared to what they used to be

[23-Apr-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> How‚Äôs this going to go with pools?

[23-Apr-19 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Pools will have to load additional deamons, clients mine like nothing happened.
You will probably have to make some ‚Äújsons‚Äù in pool_config to accommodate the new coins, like you would normally add another coin in the pool.

[23-Apr-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think it‚Äôll be pretty straightforward...

[23-Apr-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Ginasis Mining Pools

[23-Apr-19 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> pools should be able to offer great merge mining, but the reward calc and payouts will be a little work, since they can come from up to 15 different chains at once. there will be some work to do for pools to offer more profitable merge mining and differentiated features, but basic mining won't change that much.

[23-Apr-19 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> best way to merge mine i found out is to open a p2pool and remove the dev fee and you earn all the merge coin from their hash power

[23-Apr-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hey that's a pretty cool way to do "dev fee free" pools! ^^ could be better for em even. Nice to have options either way! It's a bold new world!

[23-Apr-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Isn‚Äôt that what PBaaS basically accomplished, just with a different technology, @Codeman ?
@Godballz get on installing that VM, it‚Äôs configured to be fee free... (although it can be put back in)

[23-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôm sure s-not can be adapted for PBaaS merged mining...

[23-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> How can the miner control how many coins he's mining at a pool?

[23-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not... if the pool implements a deamon for one of the autochains, you would automatically mine it...

[23-Apr-19 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Your miner mines the same hash as now, but since the autochains connect periodically to veruschain, you get the rewards for notarization and mining for all blocks since the last connection (presently 8 blocks)

[23-Apr-19 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> So pools can't use the miner's work just for themselves?

[23-Apr-19 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> They could, if they sneaked in some extra deamons to mine Autochains not on the site. But that would involve that autochains coin, not the notarization...

[23-Apr-19 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hm.. well, if there's a way, somebody will do it I'm afraid

[23-Apr-19 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> At least, these are my deductions based on what I understand of the merged mining process... if I make a *booboo*, please correct me...

[23-Apr-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> need to "compile" more info first, though... we'll see what else can emerge from those possibilities.

[23-Apr-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And from what I saw my test mining do tonight,,,

[23-Apr-19 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hmmm, playing with the idea of cloning my private pool and see what happens if I put it on the test chain.... next week, maybe...

[23-Apr-19 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> endless ponderabilities üòÑ

[23-Apr-19 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Luckily I added  next week and maybe.... don‚Äôt need pressure right now

[23-Apr-19 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> as I said, take a break... too much brainwork isn't good, too üòâ

[23-Apr-19 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Correct... spent an hour at pc and closed my eyes for another 2... it‚Äôs getting better, so we‚Äôll see what a nights rest will do to me...

[23-Apr-19 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Every chain mined in a header can be determined by the miner. If a pool added chains that they did not payout for, they would be easy to expose.

[23-Apr-19 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ok, so there's a chance to catch cheaters ... that's good to know ^^

[24-Apr-19 05:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> When did mining start at Verus. I am seeing a lot of coins in circulation. I saw this at coinpaprika
