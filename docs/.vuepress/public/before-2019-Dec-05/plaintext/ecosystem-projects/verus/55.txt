cant remember the numbers but i7 for cpu and 980ti for gpu

[14-Nov-18 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Not sure if it's worth it with those specs, u need to check your lecky price. I got a threadripper and vega 64 for gaming/mining.

[14-Nov-18 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I would say it's about worth it  @stretcher83üòâ

[14-Nov-18 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> 420mh/s for gtx 980 ti

[14-Nov-18 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Id need your specific i7 cpu you are using for its hash rate

[14-Nov-18 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im mining with 900mh/s and getting 3-4 verus coins a day , low overclocks now, saving on electricity

[14-Nov-18 11:19 AM] M√∂r√∂k√∂lli (Boogeyman)#8765
I will check when i get home from work

[14-Nov-18 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I would say if you want to be involved in a truly legit and innovative project/ coin , verus is a very good choice , there are other coins out there that are also worth going for , but iv got a good feeling about verus , and its not just for its profits , although they are nice too .

[14-Nov-18 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> There are lots of crypto‚Äôs out there today that boast they are amazing and everyone should mine them but , sadly alot of them are not that good, from what iv learnt about verus project, it has got some truly new and fascinating qualities to it , which for me say its well worth getting involved in .

[14-Nov-18 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> And our community is awesome too so win, win .üòé

[14-Nov-18 12:10 PM] M√∂r√∂k√∂lli (Boogeyman)#8765
yes I am interested in the project and others that are in the Komodo ecosystem Verus seems to be the cpu/gpu coin I have been looking for üòÉ

[14-Nov-18 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> I think Verus needs the mempool fix for CC activated chains from KMD ... whne syncing it the debug.log is flooding with joinsplit errors

[14-Nov-18 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> its not harmful ... but I fixed this in KMD, i beleive ... or maybe its theother way around, either case I think that zts should not be being added to the mempool on sync.... its only supposed to be for CC vout txs.

[14-Nov-18 02:48 PM] M√∂r√∂k√∂lli (Boogeyman)#8765
@stretcher83  got i7-6700k 4.00GHz and 16gb RAM

[14-Nov-18 02:59 PM] M√∂r√∂k√∂lli (Boogeyman)#8765
I have mined monero before with CLI and vertcoin with oneclick-miner but i guess there is only a CLI for Verus?

[14-Nov-18 03:00 PM] M√∂r√∂k√∂lli (Boogeyman)#8765
didnt get any payout with monero because the miner was killing my computer üòÇ

[14-Nov-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @Matterbridge theres not many results posted for i7 6700k as of late with the newest miners ( ccminerv3) , people posted months ago when they where solo mining that they where getting roughly 200mh/s , i would guess with the new ccminerv3 you could double that hashrate so i7 6700k could possibly get 400mh/s , maybe a bit more , or maybe a bit less,

[14-Nov-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> When you manage to get yours up and running on verus, you could be the first person to post your i7 6700k hash rate results for ccminerv3 over in the #cpu-hashrate ,

[14-Nov-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Good luck bud , and theres plenty of help on here if you have problems so all you have to do is ask .

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz_77> @miketout  John & his siblings set up a GoFundMe, for his parents. His dad is a Vietnam Veteran, and also an amputee---and they need help with medical expenses. 
Here is the link, if anyone wants to donate.
Or maybe we can pool something together here..
That was tough to read.

[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> Thank you for the new resistance to 51% attack document. Wouldnt it be a good idea to also include the notarization aspect?

[15-Nov-18 11:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skillachie> These guys are doing voting but doing an ICO with resale https://www.agora.vote  . Verus should ensure they get covered in all the media outlets these guys get covered in

[16-Nov-18 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @idrtis in fact, the paper proves that Verus is immune to 51% hash attacks even without dPoW. We do mention that we are also notarized with dPoW, but it would take a very expensive, combined stake and work attack to get to the point where we'd even think about needing help from dPoW. The great thing is that if that ever happens, it's there üòÉ  defense in depth. Though we haven't written a proof for it, we may be the most secure public chain in crypto right now.

[16-Nov-18 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Skillachie we are not yet a voting solution, but it is our vision. Today, we believe we are one of, if not the most secure, privacy-centric cryptocurrency that brings together the best technology for fundamental use over time. Until we are a voting solution, which is definitely part of the vision, we would prefer to be compared to the best advanced cryptocurrencies, where we stack up pretty well. There will be a time for that, and we hope that by that time, there still won't be a reasonable comparison, just for a different reason üòÉ

[16-Nov-18 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> Do we have a timeline to start serious marketing campaign? Until now all we‚Äôre doing is just organic grow

[16-Nov-18 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @mavenL I think we need to create a successful, community driven, organic marketing campaign. the Foundation can support community efforts, but it is not setup as a company to drive a marketing campaign separate from the community

[16-Nov-18 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Just so you know. There is a lot going on, but we still have a lot of work to do to get to the mobile adoption and additional applications, which I believe will drive more adoption than people think right now. Until then, a community member offered and started working on a rebranding effort. In the not too distant future, we hope to have the community help decide on some makeover options. We're also getting help on marketing from community members going forward.
Right now. we just posted our latest news on r/Cryptocurrency, and again, we have downvoting trolls. This time downvoting a mathematical proof that solves the 51% hash attack problem. If you have ideas to improve the project with foundation resources beyond working to find great contributors and rewarding them for contributions, we would love to hear them.

[16-Nov-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <IP> @miketout hey Mike, something shady going on with mining. Nethash is very high while mining profitability is much lower than eth or rvn mining or whatever coin from whattomine. most of hash is on some private pools. my guess is it is either private mining software or botnets. either way worth taking a look

[16-Nov-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @IP we are also looking at those numbers. If there is something, we will adjust accordingly.

[dscrdvrsc] <nmnm> can anybody contact coingecko? their price seems bit off

[17-Nov-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Coingecko goes by STEX. We have lower liquidity there, as there was not a lot of awareness of trading at STEX. We need Cryptopia to come online, which I suspect would solve that as well as enable CMC. I hope it's soon.

[17-Nov-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> Hi guys, just landed on Discord but following Verus since the beginning üòâ  I would like to discuss a few questions: why I need a privacy coin if my cash-to-crypto (and the other way too) can and is easily tracked?  In the future Verus will allow a secure and privacy centric voting system but....how many average Joe will trust "a strange and nerd thing processed abroad, like China"? 51% isn't something you can explain to uneducated large public. 

Disclaimer: I'm not in the US, said China mainly due to their hashing power but my question is country-less  üòÅ

[17-Nov-18 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> And the last one: PBaaS is, imho, the best approach and can really bring blockchain in IT industry but...is there an use case? I'm the company X and use Verus autochain to deliver my project; which guarantee I have that the service will keep running? I mean: who gurantee my SLA and/or OLA? And what about KPIs?

[17-Nov-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> Also: will Verus be compliant with EU gdpr? If yes, what approach will be used to: keep Customers data within EU and to erase their data if/when requested/needed?

[17-Nov-18 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A few of your questions can be answered with how blockchain technology itself works. Your information is never held by any one corporation and your private data need not ever be erased as it is truly and provably untraceable.

[17-Nov-18 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The guarantee your service will continue to run is the same or better than any other corporation. You can see the hashrate providing power to the network

[17-Nov-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Not any one thing is being processed abroad, as every single thing is being processed everywhere, across the entire network, fragmented and encrypted, and so impossible to hack or steal any useful data from.

[17-Nov-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @Godballz I have an enterprise point of view and like, really like, Verus because it's made by an industry expert (imho there isn't a c-level who will adopt a thing made by underground developers). "processed anywhere" means that an enterprise, in EU or abroad if handling EU datas, can not put any Customer data on it (kyc, ie); same goes with the data deletion, also against EU GDPR.  Mike's aaS approach, again imho, is the future of business blockchain and I would like to understand if and how Verus position in the market.

[17-Nov-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Sounds like you'd want to talk to the man himself, Mike. You bring up interesting questions though and now I'm curious myself. I mean yes technically the data leaves the country but only in an illegible, indecipherable form. I'm sure all this has to be addressed but just me to you- how is that in any way not better than storing something in one semi-secure location with no or minimal encryption in your on home country?

[17-Nov-18 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I hope blockchain technology and particularly veruscoin is given the opportunity to prove itself if precedents have not yet been set

[17-Nov-18 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> I'm still looking for a place where a business approach to blockchain can be discussed...and I'm sure here is the right place üòÉ  GDPR is just an example of the many, many business issues that all (imho, of course) blockchain solutions/approaches do not address. 

Take all the uber super coins born to solve counterfeit issue...since Verus is a latin word, let me explain my point of view in latin: Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?¬†
They are facing a 2000 years problem: you have an immutable and ethernal proof of....something manually entered by a human. At the end, you still need to trust a third party.

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @Diabolik one of the very exciting things about Verus is the ability for a project or company to stand up a custom blockchain that serves their purposes very specifically.  With the inclusion of Crypto Conditions, a company can have a very targeted config at the blockchain level, specifically serving their own niche purposes.  The Stake Guard CC, for example, is the first to be activated on Verus, but any org or company could, through PBaaS, stand up their own blockchain and code their own CC that is, essentially, ‚Äúapplication specific‚Äù and the community is rewarded as providers of the blockchain services.  I‚Äôm speaking in very general terms btw. 

I‚Äôd also like to hear @miketout‚Äôs thoughts on the concerns a corp may have surrounding data security, control, trust, etc.

[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @John Westbrook this is exactly the reason why I really like Verus and I think it can be a game changer...but: a Company X spin a custom chain to deliver a service to their Customers; how it can guarantee the service availability? who is accountable in case of issues/data breaches/downtimes? which is the cost model? roi? tco? 

I'm sorry, a lot of questionsüôÑ

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Explain ‚Äúdata breach‚Äù? The way in which decentralized networks operate removes the dependency of uptime on a single point or even cluster of servers controlled by a single party.  Of course if the company is operating a private chain within a closed network that‚Äôs a different story.

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> The other point to consider is that this model is not always the right model for every businesses needs.
