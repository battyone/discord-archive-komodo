[dscrdvrsc] <Shaun> i can see verus in exploer but cant find in my wallet

[01-Aug-18 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Shaun> what happened?

[01-Aug-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Shaun what do you mean "withdrew", sent from one address to another?
was one address or both a private address (z-address)?
how long have you waited?
can you confirm that the destination address is yours in the new wallet?
was this from an exchange or another wallet?

[dscrdvrsc] <Shaun> that meas the address is also a fake one?

[01-Aug-18 03:36 AM] bishop#9773
No, address will be fine but you need to get on the right chain

[01-Aug-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Shaun> i am updating my wallet now

[01-Aug-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> all wallets must be upgraded as of the halving because of the PoS change. so, blocks between the halving and now will be gone, but your address will match what you see on the blockchain now

[01-Aug-18 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Shaun> tks for your help , i have got back my coins when updated@miketout

[01-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zorgs> @oscar Got to start somewhere, fact is we need AN exchange haha. There's plenty of other community voted exchanges we can get into, the more this occurs the more chance we have of getting onto bigger exchanges. Also with a better community the more chance we can get listed on some exchanges without paying for the privledge.

[01-Aug-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> there is an https://digitalprice.io/order?url=vrsc-btc for trading now but the less person konw,for example you send a news between your blog and twitter,you'll get the diffrence result,vrsc is good coin,so should a good place for it to standing on

[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I‚Äôve not found a block yet üôà

[01-Aug-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mk111> to upgrade from v0.3.9 to v0.3.11 can i just download and v0.3.11 and unzip it. then run agama.exe from the v0.3.11 folder ?

[01-Aug-18 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @mk111 I believe you need to delete all the files in VRSC folder (user/AppData/Roaming/Komodo/VRSC) except wallet.dat, to download the correct chain, but remember to take a backup of your wallet.dat file first!! The old 0.3.9 folder is best to delete after, to make sure you dont start your own fork again by accident.

[01-Aug-18 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mk111> thank you cragorn

[01-Aug-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bluemagestrut> what folder should versus-cli be found in linux

[01-Aug-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @ChrisC30a sorry you have not found a block yet bud, but it will come, i found my first 96 coin block last night about 23:45 ish, only just seen it when i got up, 16 days from my last block, its a waiting game but i think its worth it üëçüèº, iv only got 31 mh/s going on the pc that found my last block, and it found a 192 coin block about 16 days ago,

[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> Thanks!

[01-Aug-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> @bluemagestrut  The linux cli version of Verus is just  a tar file you can extract where ever it is convenient for execution. The important file, your wallet.dat, will always be found in //home/(username)/.komodo/VRSC folder regardless of where your verus-cli executables live.

[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Something wrong?

[02-Aug-18 03:05 AM] bishop#9773
No, hashrate is at alltime highs

[02-Aug-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> Can someone mention the current hashrate? I am on an iPad and the hashrate is not visible on iOS.

[02-Aug-18 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> Thank you, dukeleto & miketout. That's higher than I have ever seen it so far. I guess it's time to break out my Chevy 427 powered miners. I've been holding off.

[02-Aug-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @AkiraX . with 313mh at current hash yu should get a block every 4.6 days!

[02-Aug-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> actually scratch that.. net hash just jumped to 2.4Th. You now should get a block every 5.1 days..

[02-Aug-18 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> by may calc.. taking into acount everything.. POW, unlocked rewards to POS , the hash rate bump, etc... 
This 96 reward phase so far, is about  25% as profitable as the 192 phase.   << SO FAR.

[02-Aug-18 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763

[02-Aug-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Kidkid> Do you know when the next reward will be reduced?

[02-Aug-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @yitiaochong  go to the veruscoin web site.  Veruscoin.io

[02-Aug-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Latest version is on there. 0.3.11 beta üëçüèº

[02-Aug-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yitiaochong> It's so slow to download on the website

[02-Aug-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Really , it only took me about 5-10 mins to download the agama wallet from the veruscoin website, not even that long, it takes a bit longer downloading the blockchain , between 10 mins to 1 hour but not really much longer than that

[02-Aug-18 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Is it taking you long to download the agama exe from veruscoin site or is it taking long to download and sync with the block chain

[02-Aug-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im not sure on the rules of discord , weather i can post the downloaded exe file from my end on these chats  for you , to be honest iv never had any issues with downloading it from the website, maybe your internet is playing up , try a router restart üëçüèº

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Hey @Eightynine  welcome

[02-Aug-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Eightynine> Hello. How can I mine this? Where can I exchange it?

[02-Aug-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Eightynine> @stretcher83 Hey as you can see I'm trying to get some information about this coin.

[02-Aug-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> You can exchange it if you want on digitalprice.io but i would hold on to whatever you get because you can also stake your coins to earn more coins and help the network at the same time

[02-Aug-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Read every thing you can on this discord and then see what you want do, you will learn more by reading the facts to yourself instead of taking my word for it i mean i might explain it in a way you dont understand me/ my interpretation might be different than yours,

[02-Aug-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Theres plenty of valuable info here just waiting for you to use üòÅüëçüèº

[02-Aug-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Eightynine> Thank you. So this is proof of stake coin?

[02-Aug-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Its more than that, its pow, pos and thers another proof of something coming , i forget what its called

[02-Aug-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Just to let you know, this is one of the coins im holding for the future, not looking at exchanging any verus , maybe if i get absolute shitloads but i carnt see that happening right now, im on 61mh/s across 2 pc‚Äôs üëçüèº

[02-Aug-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> The block reward size is at 96 coins per block, i found 1, but it recently halved from 192 coin block rewards, i found 2 of them
