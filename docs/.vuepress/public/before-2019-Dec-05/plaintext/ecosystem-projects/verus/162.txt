[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> what happens if i froget to click it

[11-May-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No, just switch is on. Any addition to your balance will automatically stake once it's added after 150 blocks (about 2.5 hours)

[11-May-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so witch it on in 2.5 hours?

[11-May-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No, just switch in on. It'll stay on.

[11-May-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> speed is about 18.9 now

[11-May-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> 14 threads

[11-May-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so because i started this in legacy mode. which wallet and i mining to right now?

[11-May-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> and how would i ge tthe seed information and stuff

[11-May-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> Native mode sorry

[11-May-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You are right now mining to your own wallet.

[11-May-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so where do i see that info and the seed words for it?

[11-May-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i clicked on Settings

[11-May-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> TThe seed info is applicable to the light wallet. You'll need to backup your `priv key`

[11-May-19 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You'll need to go to **recieve**

[11-May-19 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You're addresses should be listed there.

[11-May-19 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> On the left hand side of the address is a button with three dots on top of eachother

[11-May-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> yes i got the address and private key saved

[11-May-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> but is ther eno seed word when using the wallet in native mode?

[11-May-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> if you click it it'll show a menu with `copy priv key (WIF)`. you should store that key in a safe place

[11-May-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> yessir already done

[11-May-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The priv key is used as seed phrase...

[11-May-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ok perfect

[11-May-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> nad i cant change the wallet name in Native mode right?

[11-May-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> and*

[11-May-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You can use it to add that address to another wallet, light or native

[11-May-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> right nows its just random numbers and letters

[11-May-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No, cannot change the name

[11-May-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ok and i did Encryp wallet seed

[11-May-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That's simply the fromat the address is in. Like on your bank account you cannot change the account number to something nice

[11-May-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i should delete the  other wallet i created in simple mode correct?

[11-May-19 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Did you have funds in the light wallet?

[11-May-19 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> no

[11-May-19 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You can do 2 things: 1) import the address in native using the seed you have or 2) forget about the light address

[11-May-19 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It's not saved on your system.

[11-May-19 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i dleted it

[11-May-19 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> and encrypted the new one

[11-May-19 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ok almost done lol

[11-May-19 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> the wallet.dat keys whjat is that

[11-May-19 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i just got 99 jeys lol

[11-May-19 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> keys

[11-May-19 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The wallet.dat is your actual wallet. Make sure nobody else but you has access to it. If you want to backup your wallet, this is the file to backup

[11-May-19 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> sorry i mean the "wallet.day Keys"  option in the setting

[11-May-19 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i selected VRSC nd then click get keys

[11-May-19 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> says 99 found

[11-May-19 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> These are 'reserved' addresses for your wallet and their keys

[11-May-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> oh ok

[11-May-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so i dont need to save those

[11-May-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No, that's not necessary

[11-May-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> awesome

[11-May-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so what directory is the blockchain and my wallet saved in?

[11-May-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Check the pinned message in #community-support  channel

[11-May-19 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It also tells you how to backup, amongst other things

[11-May-19 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ok found it

[11-May-19 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> wallet.dat  etc

[11-May-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> the blockchain is only 3.2 GB ?

[11-May-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, but of coarse it keeps growing

[11-May-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> yes

[11-May-19 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> what is this bootstrap thing for that i read in the pinned message. do i need it?

[11-May-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If for any reason your blockchain gets corrupted (system crash or something) this is a fast way to download the chain.

[11-May-19 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The bootstrap is created daily on the server by 0x03, one of our valued community members.

[11-May-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> oh i see

[11-May-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Thatâ€™ll save you a lengthy synchronization.

[11-May-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so the few hours i just waited initially would have been faster? lol

[11-May-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yup... didnâ€™t want to emphasize that... lol

[11-May-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> lmao

[11-May-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> no worries

[11-May-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> didnt take too long

[11-May-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i think 3 or 4 hours

[11-May-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Thatâ€™s fast. Some folks reported over 24 hours...

[11-May-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> oh no def not that long

[11-May-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i would say 5 hours max

[11-May-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Greatly depends on cpu and internet connection speed

[11-May-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> yes for sure

[11-May-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so now i just sit back and wait i guess

[11-May-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yup...

[11-May-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> speeds at 19.4 now with 14 threads

[11-May-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> With your speed expect on **average** 1 block mined per week.

[11-May-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> At the present network difficulty.

[11-May-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i guess thats ok

[11-May-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> and 1 block of VRSC is how many i seen it earlier but i forget

[11-May-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 24 VRSC

[11-May-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so just over 2 USD a block at the moment

[11-May-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> 2.12

[11-May-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yep, priced just dropped, but itâ€™s pretty stable.

[11-May-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> nice

[11-May-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just have a look around the other channels here. Youâ€™ll notice some pretty awesome stuff being developed right now...

[11-May-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ya i took a super quick looks when i frst lgged in

[11-May-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i will def research a lot more

[11-May-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> PBaaS being the major development at the moment...

[11-May-19 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> reading more on it now

[11-May-19 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> Verus is CPU only right?

[11-May-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Mainly... thereâ€™s much work done on gpu mining and we do have FPGAâ€™s on the network

[11-May-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But the FPGAâ€™s donâ€™t outperform the newest CPUâ€™s by much

[11-May-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i prefer cpu anyways

[11-May-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> less electrcity as well

[11-May-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Most people have one... ðŸ˜‚

[11-May-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> lol ya

[11-May-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i have a 580x gpu as well but rather use my cpu

[11-May-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> F1 mini actually performs at about 1MH/W, which is pretty good...

[11-May-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> sorry RX 580**
