[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> One downside is that it wont have a metal feel to the coin anymore

[03-Apr-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That’s true

[03-Apr-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But then again: why turn to a material used for many centuries in coins to represent such a modern coin...

[03-Apr-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> That's a deep question lol

[03-Apr-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Cobalt has I nice blue tint to it... lol

[03-Apr-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol

[03-Apr-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I can do gold,  silver or brass (polished or antiqued for each), black nickel or a combo of the any 2 (which is a bit pricier)

[03-Apr-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @miketout when you get a chance, take a look at Thoskk's comment about the Latin used by Verus

[03-Apr-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> what kind of brass? Light yellow, golden, or reddish?

[03-Apr-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Golden

[03-Apr-19 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> is it surface coated in any way, or will it oxidise and darken with time?

[03-Apr-19 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> so it could "mature" 😉

[03-Apr-19 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> As long as it's not exposed to crazy weather elements and extreme temperature it shouldn't. Basically, if you have it on display it won't

[03-Apr-19 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Draeth I defer to Thoskk. we should change it

[03-Apr-19 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I am not an expert in Latin, and we did not have it proofed by an expert who could analyze it at that level of detail

[03-Apr-19 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I gotcha

[03-Apr-19 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thanks @Thoskk !

[03-Apr-19 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Any opinion on the shiny silver vs antiqued?

[03-Apr-19 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I personally like the shiny better. what do other people think?

[03-Apr-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i don't have a strong opinion on it, but that is my personal preference

[03-Apr-19 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I'm gonna post a poll on Twitter and see what others think as well (@theinfamouskata). Oink and Thoskk are torn between both lol

[03-Apr-19 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You made me split my personality....

[03-Apr-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol

[03-Apr-19 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @miketout  yeah, I think an expert would be helpful. It's not easy to translate correctly into Latin, especially such general statements.

[03-Apr-19 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Draeth  thinking about it, I more and more like a shiny golden brass ... but that's only my personal preference ^^

[03-Apr-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Kk I'll get a proof made up of brass

[03-Apr-19 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Actually,  before I do, we should figure out the Latin first

[03-Apr-19 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yes 😃

[03-Apr-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I'm already checking for people I can ask for assistance 😄

[03-Apr-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Awesome!

Attention! I'm taking a poll on what you think looks better for the @VerusCoin physical coin: Antiqued Silver or Polished Silver. The community has been torn because they like both, so i'm taking a vote (fyi, the latin will probably change). Pics: https://t.co/mgRxnzExcu

[04-Apr-19 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> "not to mension the insane amounts of washtrading that was present there"

With this statement I think it's unlikely you ever even looked at the exchange

[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> DP has been working fine for ages, why pull an exit scam when the market starts to look in recovery

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Volume on Verus was less than 1btc most of the time. Why would anyone bother wash trading it?

[04-Apr-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I posted this in the GUI-WALLET channel, but bringing it here in case anyone can help me:

[04-Apr-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Is anyone able to assist me? I was launching my Agama wallet Native mode after a system update and tried to stop it while the daemon was booting up or something. It gave an error msg stating it cldn't stop, so I X'd out Agama. Now when I try to start it back up, nothing happens when I click on Verus under the native wallet dropdown. I deleted the Agama application (MacBook Pro), then downloaded it again- no difference. Any assistance is much appreciated!

[04-Apr-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> @Patrick Crypto  thanks for informing me

[04-Apr-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @jintaa you may need to delete the associated files in the komodo and agama folders but I think it's a  bit different on mac.

[04-Apr-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'll do a search and see what I can find and if so will continue this chat in the gui section

[04-Apr-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @Godballz -thanks, dude- Oink already helped me sort it out in gui-wallet

[04-Apr-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Godballz we backup’d the wallet.dat, removed the complete Komodof older and installed new. Replace wallet.dat & bootstrap and it’s working

[04-Apr-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> 👍 @jintaa Awesome, glad to hear. That  @Oink is a heck of a dude 😉

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @basti From where?
Edit. nvm, saw it from the explorer.

[04-Apr-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Draeth  Still working on it, but no answers yet, unfortunately. However, I don't think it will work like intended, because "virtus" still is female, while "verus" is male ... they just don't match

[04-Apr-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I'm already looking for alternatives. Unfortunately, almost any possible replacement is either also female, or neuter.  😦

[04-Apr-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ok here , I have a suggestion from a former classmate who studied Latin and old Greek: "Virtus vera non potest emi".  Alternative: "Virtus vera non emitur".
However, as expected, "Ver**us**" is gone 😦

[04-Apr-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> How about a little alteration: "Verus progressus non potest emi", or "Progressus Verus Non Emitur" ... it's the only thing I can think of to keep the Ver**us**.

[04-Apr-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> this of course it would be "True progress can't be bought" in English.

[04-Apr-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I don't think progress fits will tbh

[04-Apr-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Well*

[04-Apr-19 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well, I'm running out of ideas and alternatives ...

[04-Apr-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> How about some synonyms for virtue

[04-Apr-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Like integrity

[04-Apr-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> already checked and found nothing; integritas : female

[04-Apr-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I got it "true Latin is hard as shit"

[04-Apr-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Yea

[04-Apr-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I'm open for any suggestion. Now I now how to construct the phrase, I only need a suitable noun 😉

[04-Apr-19 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Confidentiality

[04-Apr-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Familiaritas would be closest, and guess what? It's female 😉

[04-Apr-19 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol

[04-Apr-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Excellence?

[04-Apr-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> make an educated guess... ^^

[04-Apr-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Female?

[04-Apr-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Bingo! ^^

[04-Apr-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
