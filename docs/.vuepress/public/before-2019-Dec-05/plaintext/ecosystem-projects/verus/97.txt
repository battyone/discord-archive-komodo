[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the Verus Coin Foundation pays bounties to people who contribute to the project in different ways at its discretion. often bounties are unexpected and offered to people who have just been helping in different ways. generally, the way to earn bounties is to learn about things that need to be done or think of things that need to be done and start helping out. if you have a specific skill and feel it could be helpful, please DM @Asher , @John Westbrook , @michaeltoutjr, or me explaining your thoughts. right now, the Foundation currently has a couple large open bounty offers for advanced algorithm development on GPUs and FPGAs. aside from that, there are regular bounties paid at the discretion of the Foundation to people who really help others or make a real difference in helping the Verus Project gain awareness. These are often not offered beforehand and are just paid as part of recognizing community contributions.

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> Do I own now two coins or what ?

[03-Jan-19 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Do you mean two types of coins now due to the fork? If so, then the answer is no. You should only have one type, the most recent one.

[03-Jan-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> So it‚Äôs not a fork ?

[04-Jan-19 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> it's a fork, change of pow

[04-Jan-19 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dude if you'd like to run an old version of the wallet and stay on the other fork, you are welcome to do so if it runs. there is no connection to the Verus community or support from any community developers for that fork, and we would consider it obsoleted by the new version that is available now. It is also not notarized by Komodo or part of the KMD ecosytem, and it's algorithm has been centralized by FPGA miners, so if they are going to carry a project forward with what they have left, you can decide if you think it is worth your time.

[04-Jan-19 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> what I am actually asking was that my private key is now getting access to a wallet from the original vrsc and now the new 2.0 fork ? Or is original vrsc completely down ?

[04-Jan-19 12:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> ah

[04-Jan-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you would have access to both, but I believe the older fork will not exist for long if it does at all right now. if you're worried about replay, that should not be an issue.

[04-Jan-19 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kilgore> what was the name of that KMD exchange that offered a VERUS market again? Or is STEX the only exchange?

[dscrdvrsc] <Mark [CPUminers.club]> hey guys, is this coin cpu minable only?

[05-Jan-19 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> No. CPU is currently preferred though, until when(and if) GPU catches up, and/or FPGA bitstreams are made.  The algorithm  has been made with intent to level them closer together. Check #announcements for details.

[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @John Westbrook I don't understand what u are asking? U want us to join twitter or discord?

[06-Jan-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i interpreted what he said as maybe click like or express support if you think it's a good idea.

[06-Jan-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they haven't decided to do it yet, but the time locked mining support in Verus would likely work fine for what they need.

[06-Jan-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Fisher Pri Catz> what is time locked mining?

[06-Jan-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Mining blocks that are time locked after you hash them

[06-Jan-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Any rough idea on how much of an effect the time locked rewards will have on the overall supply in two years? For example, it's fairly easy to get on the top 100 list right now with 20k vrsc- is there any idea how drastically this list is expected to change by the next halving?

[06-Jan-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I can 100% appreciate early supporters getting rewarded for their faith and effort, I'm just wondering if there is a clear representation of the proportion of distribution.

[06-Jan-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Nevermind I think I found it but my math might be off- does 16.67% of supply sound about right?

[06-Jan-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> The more important question is how much of that timelocked VRSC is lost forever because of the wallet discards etc

[06-Jan-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> as long as it is not you who discards his wallet: your coins should get a bit more worthy in theory üòâ
