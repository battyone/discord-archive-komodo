[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> yea, it was syncing up over night, woke up this morning, checked it and it gave me this

[26-Apr-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Exception: 15dbwrapper_error
Database corrupted
Komodo in AppInit()

[26-Apr-19 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @J Oliver Westbrook  chech Dreaths problem, please...

[26-Apr-19 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> he is

[26-Apr-19 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> i've been talking to him

[26-Apr-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> OK...  Sounds like a corrupt chain to me...

[26-Apr-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> First thing I would try is bootstrapping...

[26-Apr-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> yea. problem is, both vrsc and arrr stopped running and don't want to run

[26-Apr-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> so literally nothing wants to run

[26-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 3x bootstrap.... That would be weird...

[26-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> yea

[26-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> if you don't have enough diskspace, you would have ran into trouble earlier...

[26-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> are you on a VM at your provider?

[26-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or do you have a dedicated server?

[26-Apr-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> dedicated server

[26-Apr-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> i did run out of space, but i upgraded

[26-Apr-19 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> i think you need to wipe your db and chain data and get the bootstrap again

[26-Apr-19 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> so go in your /opt folder and for each coin folder in there, go in, go into the all caps folder within, delete everything EXCEPT FOR YOUR wallet file. Your wallet file is named something like ‚Äúvrsc_store.dat‚Äù

[26-Apr-19 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> then from within that same folder download the bootstrap for that chain, unpack it, after unpacking delete the tar file, then start the chain

[26-Apr-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> my guess is when you ran out of space your db or block data got corrupted

[26-Apr-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> let me know if you‚Äôd like me to fix for you, i‚Äôm happy to do so, you‚Äôll just have to give me ssh access

[26-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> that worked! you rock!

[26-Apr-19 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> Woop!

[27-Apr-19 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> So, long story short, I was still having space issues (I need to look into what is taking up space that shouldn't be there). I ended up creating a new volume with enough space to hold the kmd bootstrap, moving the kmd bootstrap there, then unpacking it into the correct directory

[27-Apr-19 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> now everything fits

[27-Apr-19 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> testing now to see if everything works

[27-Apr-19 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> everything is running perfectly now

[27-Apr-19 06:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bubu> hello everyone,good day üññ

[27-Apr-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Good Morning  @bubu Happy Saturday! üéâ üéâ

[27-Apr-19 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ssssssstt, I‚Äôm still waking up...

[27-Apr-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Actually I was driving to work earlier today and I slammed right into a mattayogey. Nearly swerved off the road. Scary.

[27-Apr-19 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Someone is supposed to ask: what's a matter Yogi.
To which I reply: Nothin Boo-boo!
  @bubu üòâ üòÜ

[27-Apr-19 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Sorry, attention called away... DM disturbed

[27-Apr-19 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Nice joke, BTW

[27-Apr-19 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Heh. Was hoping someone would be enough of a Yogi the Bear fan to get it! Haha. Good dad joke for kids. Well it was when kids knew what Yogi was..

[27-Apr-19 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Let them watch Big Bang Theory.... so they‚Äôll know to watch Yogi to teach them not to burn the Forrest down...

[27-Apr-19 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or some Indian character teach them not to play with Cobra‚Äôs

[27-Apr-19 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But this is really an #off-topic conversation... whoehahaha

[27-Apr-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> @miketout @michaeltoutjr @Asher   My coin is missing.

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> a bit more specific please?

[27-Apr-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> Display transfer to private address. Private address has no transaction record

[27-Apr-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Check the `Raw info` tab., to ensure that you sent it to the right address

[27-Apr-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> nevermind, that doesnt work unless you send to public

[27-Apr-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> How can I get my coin back?

[27-Apr-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don't now if it is possible to check to which Private address you sent it. I'm afraid you'll have to wait for Mike for this

[27-Apr-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Ouch. Did you mean to send it to a private address in your wallet or to an Exchange like CryptoBridge?

[27-Apr-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> It wasn't sent by me. It was like this when I saw it. Was it stolen?

[27-Apr-19 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Unfortunately, I'd say yes. Everything except the time locked balance was sent.

[27-Apr-19 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Any reason your wallet credentials could be compromised?

[27-Apr-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Holly crap! Someone had 21k stolen?

[27-Apr-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Did I read this right?

[27-Apr-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Nice way of rubbing it in, @GlorymanRTS.
But yeah, it would seem so.

[27-Apr-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> But it doesn't show that it's sent out.

[27-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> At what block? Or the transaction id? Don't want to type each character from an image.

[27-Apr-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Thanks.
<https://explorer.vrsc.0x03.services/address/R9g49XDc9gqvi5dkeEGJBenrtAWJ6MT7fz>
So it's on the explorer, so it's just not only your wallet messing up.
You haven't sent the transaction yourself, which indicates that someone else has access to your address and/or wallet.
And seeing how it's sent to a private address there is no way of tracing it, but even if it was possible there's not much to do about it.

[27-Apr-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> Are you sure it was stolen?

[27-Apr-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> It was sent out from your wallet, by someone other than you, to an external address. So unless you've forgotten about sending it to a service handling private z-addresses (like CryptoBridge) then they're most likely transferred by someone other than you to their own address.
Has anyone had access to your computer handling the wallet? Backups of the wallet.dat? WIF keys? Are any of those stored on an online services where your login credentials may be compromised, like e-mail auth? Are there any file sharing services running on the device you've got copies of the wallet on that could have been hacked?

[27-Apr-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> The wallet papers were never passed on to anyone else.

[27-Apr-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> And of course the risk of malware getting installed, stealing files like crypto wallets.

[27-Apr-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> The machine is a new system. Kill with anti-virus software, no poison

[27-Apr-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Seeing how you've been staking the amount you're running a native wallet which uses an wallet.dat file located on that device. If that has been stolen then they've got access to every address.

Brand new system? Cheap shady device with preinstalled OS from the internet or from a respectable retailer?

[27-Apr-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> guess a pwd for sending would really not be a bad idea.

[27-Apr-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Except wallet.dat is still unencrypted.

[27-Apr-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> right

[27-Apr-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Which it needs to be to stake.

[27-Apr-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> so the pwd had to be stored elswehere, in an encrypted way

[27-Apr-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Else paper wallet with BIP38 is reasonable.(The address becomes encrypted with password, and needs to be decrypted with it to use.)

[27-Apr-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Don't get me wrong, @superbig, I feel really bad if that's the case, but I'm only trying to state the vulnerabilities and what could have happend. I hope you the best!
I'm off to rake some leaves.

[27-Apr-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @zpajk omg u can get ur wallet stolen by buying 2nd hand pc!

[27-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I wish there was some kind of list of ways to secure crypto wallets. So, computer noobs like me can protect ourselves.

[27-Apr-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @GlorymanRTS  Well, if you buy a cheap PC from the internet, with pre-installed OS, the **very least** thing to do is: Make a fresh install of the OS (you should have the key if it's Windows), get a firewall and antivirus of your own choice, choose a safe password and don't login as administrator or user with high privileges.
But it's probably better not to buy a cheap/used machine if you aren't sure how to take care of. You wouldn't buy a used and probably modded car if you wouldn't know more or less exactly that it's ok and compliant to regulations... could also cost you a lot on top.

[27-Apr-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Thoskk thanks bro. Yeah, I will load a fresh install of windows. I wish I was more computer savy.

[27-Apr-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @GlorymanRTS  don't forget to backup important data to external drive before erasing the OS üòÑ

[27-Apr-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> just don't make an image of the OS and put it back on afterwards üòâ

[27-Apr-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> @superbig

[27-Apr-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Relaunch agama with -reindex

[27-Apr-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Kind of looks like 16-20k was dumped on DP.

[27-Apr-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Sure does look like that

[27-Apr-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> volume on the last candle 24k

[27-Apr-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Hardware wallet staking now please

[27-Apr-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @GlorymanRTS Yeah, it's probably a very lucrative "business" idea. Sell cheap devices with malware and hope to strike gold sooner or later.

[27-Apr-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Why you should be careful with any USB device with storage, or ones you think "what could be the harm of charging the device with my computer's USB port instead of the assigned adapter?".

[27-Apr-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> Geez that‚Äôs my worst nightmare, seeing unrecognised outgoing transactions from the old wallet

[27-Apr-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I mean, we live in a time where malware can pretty much fit in a USB cable connector and not the device itself.

[27-Apr-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @zpajk just 1% would make nice extra profit...

[27-Apr-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> He didn‚Äôt screenshot any movement of 21k coins that I saw

[27-Apr-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> He needs to reindex

[27-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> He did post screenshots, about 4 hours ago.

[27-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Missed the second pic

[27-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> That sucks

[27-Apr-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Why is he still using sprout addresses there?

[27-Apr-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Odd transaction fee too

[27-Apr-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Wouldn‚Äôt happen to be Australian would he?

[27-Apr-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> That guy bought that wallet

[27-Apr-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Just a wild guess

[27-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Not impossible scenario either.

[27-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> That would be the only realistic explanation I could think of

[27-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> talking about wallet papers
