[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Thanks, it's very interesting to learn about this.

[06-Jun-19 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Another question I have is, does it make a difference with the hack that happened with Agama if our wallet is encrypted or not?

[06-Jun-19 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> In Zelcore's wallet, encryption is by default, but in Agama it has to be done through the settings.

[06-Jun-19 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> It is very interesting yet unfortunate for the people who lost money.

[06-Jun-19 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> I like how communicative the Verus community is. Very transparent. Unlike any other project I've looked at.

[06-Jun-19 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> In this case, I don't think it would have mattered if the wallet was encrypted, as I believe the exploit compromised code that would have had access to the encrypted data regardless. I should probably refrain from any more speculation until we hear more from Komodo. We should be patient until that time, but we are definitely learning everything we can from this.

[06-Jun-19 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK, that's what I also thought. I want to add that I find the Agama UI not very user-friendly, especially for new people that come into crypto

[06-Jun-19 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> I just imported my Lite Agama keys/address into Native mode.

[06-Jun-19 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> Agreed. I love how it has so many settings but it's not intuitive for the average Facebook dummy.

[06-Jun-19 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> The sending/receiving section, and also the creation of the wallets section are ok, but all the other settings can be quite confusing and there are no tooltips

[06-Jun-19 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> even when you expand the sections, they are not well explained

[06-Jun-19 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Also, is it still ok to launch a blockchain on the Verus testnet using Agama, or better wait until we know more about what happened?

[06-Jun-19 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> How long does it usually take to download the Verus chain? Took me a day to dl the Monero chain.

[06-Jun-19 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Took me a couple of days

[06-Jun-19 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> But I switched off the computer at night

[06-Jun-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> Ah.. then about a day.

[06-Jun-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> Hopefully tomorrow night it will be done then. Do you know the current size?

[06-Jun-19 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> While you download you should see a progress bar showing % you have reached out of the total size

[06-Jun-19 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> You have to click on the Transactions button in Agama

[06-Jun-19 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> Thanks

[06-Jun-19 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <its> Is there a tutorial how to shield coins from the command line (linux)?

[06-Jun-19 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> One more question. I have some Veruscoin in the Verus version of Agama. Does it make it any safer if I move them to a shielded address?

[06-Jun-19 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @D2D  There is no issue with creating test chains on test Agama. You don't have to wait. You do currently need to add public nodes to the definition, and you may have to add them to a conf file, but that should be simplified in the next update. You do not have to do anything in your Verus Agama. There was no issue, and unless you used the Komodo Agama on the same machine, your funds should be fine. You don't have to do anything.

[06-Jun-19 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Yes I did use the Agama version on the same machine

[06-Jun-19 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Ah, did you load Verus on the Komodo Agama?

[06-Jun-19 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> then I downloaded the Verus version, created a new wallett address, and moved the coins there

[06-Jun-19 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I think I might have done so

[06-Jun-19 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> OK, so, you sent the coins from Komodo's Agama to the Verus Agama's new address?

[06-Jun-19 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> My coins are still all there

[06-Jun-19 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Both ARRR and Veruscoin

[06-Jun-19 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I just want to make sure that no one has the private key, which I think can be determined by exact steps. How did you create the new wallets and then send from the old ones?

[06-Jun-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I can't remember, I might have opened the Veruscoin wallet and then re-activated the wallet there. Or maybe I activated the Veruscoin wallet in the Agama/Veruscoin version for the first time. I'm not 100% sure, because every time I upgrade Agama instead of replacing the old version I just keep both copies in case anything went wrong

[06-Jun-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> as long as you never loaded the new wallet on Komodo Agama, you should be OK, but to be sure, I think you would need to rename your wallet files between loading

[06-Jun-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Ah OK thanks. How can I do that?

[06-Jun-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> (rename the files)

[06-Jun-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Or I could just send my Veruscoin to the mobile wallet (testflight version) or Pungo

[06-Jun-19 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> But still have my ARRR there too

[06-Jun-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> My KMD, I sent them to the Pungo wallet just a few days ago, and Pungo were not affected by the hack

[06-Jun-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> But they can't hold ARRR, only Veruscoin and KMD

[06-Jun-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the right way to do it, and you may want to do it again to be sure would be:
1. Close Komodo Agama
2. Rename the wallet.dat in the ~/.komodo folder to wallet-old.dat and the wallet.dat in the ~/.komodo/VRSC and ~/.komodo/PIRATE folder  (or other komodo family chains) to wallet-old.dat
3. Load Verus Agama wallet. Make sure before you do that all folders of coins do not have a wallet.dat file in them.
4. Activate each coin and create the addresses to send to. Copy them to some editor, so you can send to them
5. Close Verus Agama
6. Rename all wallet.dat files in all directories to wallet-new.dat
7. Rename all wallet-old.dat files in all directories to wallet.dat
8. Load Verus Agama
9. Send all funds to the new addresses on each coin
10. Close Verus Agama
11. Rename all wallet-new.dat files to wallet.dat
12 Load Verus Agama

[06-Jun-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> basically #1 is not necessary if you are sure that you never load it again. You can do all of the new things with Verus Agama only

[06-Jun-19 06:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK great thanks

[06-Jun-19 06:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Very clear

[06-Jun-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> sure. I should have asked if you were on Linux

[06-Jun-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I'm on Mac

[06-Jun-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> as long as you can map those wallet directories to Mac folders. can you?

[06-Jun-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> have to explore now : )

[06-Jun-19 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> basically, each coin has a wallet.dat in a data folder, which has all of your keys and saves the transactions as well

[06-Jun-19 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you need new ones, which will be made automatically if the old one is not present or renamed

[06-Jun-19 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> whichever one is named wallet.dat in the right directory when you load is the one that will be activated

[06-Jun-19 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> How do I do these changes to ~/.komodo, through the terminal or just normal search in Finder

[06-Jun-19 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if you assume that the ones you ran Komodo Agama on may be compromised, these steps make new wallets for you and then you load the old ones, which you can do on Verus Agama to send the coins to the new ones, which aren't compromised

[06-Jun-19 06:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I don't really use Mac, but those folders are the locations on Linux. I need to check with someone on Mac. I think they are in a place called Application Support and then with similar directories. Let me check the source.

[06-Jun-19 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> It looks like ~/Library/Application Support/Komodo and then below

[06-Jun-19 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> what if I move both Verus and ARRR out to Digital Price for example, delete the Veruscoin version of Agama, re-download it, then create two new wallets and send the coins back from Digital Price?

[06-Jun-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you don't need to delete the app

[06-Jun-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK

[06-Jun-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the only one you should delete is Komodo Agama

[06-Jun-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it is the wallet.dat files that are your actual wallet keys and transactions

[06-Jun-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK. But is it enough to just send  the app from Applications to Trash, or are there more hidden files that need to be deleted?

[06-Jun-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the app can stay where it is, and when you change the wallet.dat (only when the app is closed), it will be the different wallet

[06-Jun-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I mean to delete the old Agama app

[06-Jun-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you should not load the Komodo app again, but the wallet.dat can still be accessed by Verus Agama

[06-Jun-19 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> ah, yes. it should be ok to just delete the app

[06-Jun-19 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK thanks

[06-Jun-19 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but please make sure you locate your wallet.dat files

[06-Jun-19 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they hold all your funds, nothing else

[06-Jun-19 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> But if I move them to a DigitalPrice wallet, then create a new wallet in Agama (Verus version) I'll be fine

[06-Jun-19 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> And after send them back from Digital Price to the new wallet

[06-Jun-19 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> As long as I delete the old version of Agama

[06-Jun-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Only if you create a new wallet.dat

[06-Jun-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> otherwise, it will be the same wallet and the private keys to at least some of the addresses may be compromised

[06-Jun-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, you would need to delete the old Agama and also the wallet.dat after you are sure DP has your funds

[06-Jun-19 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK perfect, thanks

[06-Jun-19 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Just realized that deposits for ARRR are still not working on Digital Price

[06-Jun-19 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> And withdrawals

[06-Jun-19 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> yes, I noticed that too

[06-Jun-19 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> what you are trying to do D2D?

[06-Jun-19 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ranma103 (Ginasis Mining)> Hey Mike @miketout Is there a reason in the new v6.0 PBaaS wallet you need like 5000 plus verus to be able to send out?

[06-Jun-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> @grewalsatinder just trying to find a safe home for my ARRR : )

[06-Jun-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> maybe I'll use Gravex instead, never used before

[06-Jun-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> 🙂 Verus is good choice then

[06-Jun-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> yes, but just to get them out, then delete the old Agama, create a new wallet, then send them back to Agama Verus

[06-Jun-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> give your best try to keep your funds off exchange, and if you couldn't manage it only then go with sending those to some exchange.

[06-Jun-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SVK_Noko> hi, how old is this coin ?

[06-Jun-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> with good help you can manage them off exchange fine.

[06-Jun-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Would be just temporarily out then in

[06-Jun-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> you seems confuse. I can may be help.

[06-Jun-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I prefer rather than changing the dat files...I'm worried I might do something wrong

[06-Jun-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
