[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> From my screen shot i have obviously spoken with mike himself from long ago. There is no negativity towards the team or their decisions.

[12-Dec-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> This is your text: "Fact is they decided to change (from cpu only to cpu/gpu)"
That is not correct, and that is the only thing I am trying to tell you. And nobody except mods gets to tell baby to stay in the corner :)
@NWhiskeyTango

[12-Dec-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Im sorry i'll see myself out. I was not the first to be rude. Have a nice day

[12-Dec-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> I dont want you to leave mate. I just want you to understand where you are wrong, and that devs have been very up front and fair since before launch.

[12-Dec-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> What is the total Supply and when is that Supply expected to be reached?

Half of the reward issued is done through the proof of stake system but is that reward the same as the mining reward? 

As far as I can tell it's just about 25 tokens per mineing block but is it the same for proof of stake?

Do you have to have a certain amount in order to participate in the proof of state if so how much? what would be the expected reward? Are there different tiers or does the amount change over time?

[12-Dec-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @NWhiskeyTango I would prefer you don't leave too, and I'm sorry to make a judgement about who was being rude. Perhaps I missed something. I'd delete my statement, but I think it's fair to you to leave it, so it might justify your response a bit. I just feel pretty bad when I see that we "decided" to change. We didn't decide to have either GPUs or secret mining FPGAs. The original algorithm stood up well to GPUs, but it was too small in size, had some things that could be optimized significantly on hardware and was simply missing enough barriers to equalize FPGAs. we've learned. I can promise that I never decided to add them, but you could argue that Chris, as a developer, decided to write the GPU miner, and we didn't change the algo for that. Chris did a great job on the GPU miner, and it didn't stop CPU mining altogether. FPGAs were a very different story, and it is time to adjust.

[12-Dec-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> And it is rather obvious that FPGAs are making Verus centralized when one entity that turned off all minig units to do maintenance resulted in nethash dropped from almost 30TH/s to about 7TH/s for almost a day.

[12-Dec-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> (Sorry walked out, i'm cool)

[12-Dec-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Other people were rude to  @NWhiskeyTango too but let's chill now

[12-Dec-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Ok my "decide to change" was a stretch I appologize.

[12-Dec-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> accepted as well. I hope you do stick around. can I ask for a summary of your current thinking?

[12-Dec-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Cool mate. No worries. I think most people in here will say you wont be sorry for staying 😃

[12-Dec-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @NWhiskeyTango stay bro

[12-Dec-18 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey  @Cragorn. That was only hosted fpgas I believe. I think alot of the 7th hash was also the non-hosted fpgas.

[12-Dec-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> I understand where you all are coming from (the lashing I took lol jk jk). My opinion is truely open minded. My biased vote would be create a "cpu-only algo" as THAT is how I became a Veruser. For this to work, the FPGA secrecy has to go, no doubt. An all-around-hardware algo would be dope. Something like what Mining Spec mentioned?

[12-Dec-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> I understand the changes that happened I just hope you all here kinda see in between the lines of where I, personally, was at then. That I couldn't keep up with the changes at the time as a CPU miner ( maybe a little sad about that GPU miner, maybe. Just a personal perspective)

[12-Dec-18 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I understand your point, I started cpu only as well. It's been very interesting watching this project grow though to say the least and it looks to only get better.

[12-Dec-18 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the new Algo will likely be CPU only at first, was designed to leverage every strength of CPUs, especially where they are weaknesses of hardware, and is expected to bring GPUs much closer to CPUs, as Chris doesn't think they will yet be slower. We've closed every known hole for algo-specific optimization of hardware. Short of testing on an FPGA, we are optimistic as is reasonable, and rather than take some additional steps to cut them off, which will make things worse, IMO, when they come back, we believe the new algo has a very good chance of making them a non issue and reinvigorating CPU mining. Since we don't yet have GPU or FPGA, we can only go by opinions of experts we know. On FPGA, due to the money involved, only an actual implementation optimized by someone really good will give us the final answer.

[12-Dec-18 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Yes i agree. I try to keep up. Crypto Rich interviews and frequent discord visits.

[12-Dec-18 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @Gloryman Yea, that might be, but I can't say for sure. Also, the point was that this puts close to 23TH/s on one entity. The other FPGAs could be more decentralized if they are on private hands.

[12-Dec-18 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cragorn agreed

[12-Dec-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout did u think anymore about that option to work with that fpga manufacturer?

[12-Dec-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> The $500 one.

[12-Dec-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> when I say "likely CPU only", I actually do hope that Chris finishes the GPU miner, and I think it will be a challenge to beat CPUs if it is possible. as far as net hash, I am quite sure we will go back to numbers from the earlier days (still with the 51% attack immunity of VerusPoP). The new algo, if it ends up being final, is significantly slower on CPUs as well because it's just doing more. We'll get more benchmarks on different CPUs before I put out numbers, as it should advantage the newest CPUs over older ones as well, which is our strategy to defend against bot-nets.

[12-Dec-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> As long as it works ok with my threadripper 😉

[12-Dec-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> 😂

[12-Dec-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman I would like to, as I'd rather have it done in the open. Right now, we're just waiting on the algo release, as then we can get more opinions of FPGA experts and devs on whether they'd even like to try in the near future.

[12-Dec-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Threadrippers should be quite good. I think the newest Intel's may be fastest.

[12-Dec-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Wow 8 core can beat 16 core. What about 32 core? Will that be ok/fast?

[12-Dec-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> *side note* realizing now in my ramblings that I said something on the lines of -benefiting the devs- relating to if/when deciding to make changes was way out of line. My sppologies. Let it be known.

[12-Dec-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> It was not my intent

[12-Dec-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @Mining Spec Check out the spreadsheet in #faq-chosen  #23. Download to edit the current blockheight and your amount of coins staking. It should help you get some answers.

[12-Dec-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <penguin> Is there an ETA for the algo change ?

[13-Dec-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> @Cragorn  Thx

[13-Dec-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skillachie> CPU

[13-Dec-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skillachie> > as it should advantage the newest CPUs over older ones as well, which is our strategy to defend against bot-nets.

[13-Dec-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skillachie> This is only a temporary strategy since eventually more computers will have newer cpus. Would be nice to have decent performance on old CPUs. I have old CPUs 😃 but I understand. Still vote CPU

[13-Dec-18 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763

[13-Dec-18 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JT> thanks for repeating the question.. I'd *prefer* a GPU miner (since I have a 1080Ti on my main box, and rig with 5 1070 and 2 1060 cards that I want to mine with) but I'd be willing to just run the CPU one initially if that was available.

[13-Dec-18 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> I would like to post a response on friday if that is ok? Currently leaning towards CPU only. "Uncertain" is fine for the time being too

[13-Dec-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> CPU only for me 🎅 Delivering a positive change as fast as possible is more important than my own benefit (I am mostly GPU mining)🙃

[13-Dec-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> by cpu only, do we mean potentialy inefficient gpu miner (with the current information) and financially infeasible special products fgpa asic etc ?

[13-Dec-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ok88 agreed. I have mainly gpus. But, I want this project to get back to a normal growing project. Not just hanging around waiting for something to be done about fpgas.

[13-Dec-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> i really very like you@ok88 hhhhhha

[13-Dec-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @John Westbrook I'd feel comfortable with 'CPU First'. I also want to express once more in general that if we go cpu first, or even with gpu ready, I hope we can all take the opportunity to market and attract new miners instead of us regulars just taking profits from lower difficulty.

[13-Dec-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SadykovT> SandyKovT 😂

[13-Dec-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @ted Approach should be good for the community, not myself, thats all. I have VRSC so I want the project to be successful, not my mining... 👍

[13-Dec-18 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <evilwar> I say kill the fpgas asap. Secretly mining is not in the interests of the project.

[13-Dec-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> So, will the new algo need a new CPU miner written for it?

[13-Dec-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @John Westbrook Just noticed I'm on the uncertain list. I mine with both CPU and GPU but I am totally up for CPU only if it will bring balance sooner. If it can still be tweaked and there's no compromise for timeliness, I don't see a problem with a fresh start. The rest should fall in place naturally

[13-Dec-18 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Daiyox> @John Westbrook I'd fall into the CPU first category as well.. When Verus launched I found it very refreshing to see a project with CPU centric beginnings

[13-Dec-18 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Prague> @John Westbrook I still think that we should be CPU + GPU balanced, with CPU advantage. 1 good CPU (i.e. Ryzen) = 6 good GPUs (i.e. 1070-1080)

[13-Dec-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> I vote CPU but agree with the equal hash rate/power argument.

[13-Dec-18 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto Baggins> My POV is, dont hate the player, hate the game. Let's not change the game because someone figured out how to play better.

[13-Dec-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey @miketout, I was wondering if we could have some information about security and protecting our wallets and crypto on exchanges. How to prevent hacking and code practice for protecting Verus or any other cryptocurrency. Perhaps we could have a channel @aelder to share hacking attempts, scams, security flaws in other coins or security ideas/advice. We just call the channel 'security'. What do you think?

[13-Dec-18 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> I totally get your point @Crypto Baggins but I feel like FPGAs can spoil the game for the other coins.  This one has a different intention than other PoW coins so I’d love to see the spirit preserved and see how the strategy works over time.

[13-Dec-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jbates58 You probably have the biggest stake i have seen. Could you contribute to security advice for the Verus community please?

[13-Dec-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto Baggins> @cryptonoobie the arguement to me seems very playground. Johnny has nicer toys, now Johnny cant play with us. ASICs, FPGAs, stacks of GPUs, 10 CPUs if there's a way to grab more hash someone will do it. Changing the game just prolongs the inevitable IMO.

[13-Dec-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> unless technically the hashrate/watt for the different hardware can be made close

[13-Dec-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> why not wait for release according to announcement?

[13-Dec-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> until then it is all speculation on the outcome of the new algo

[13-Dec-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> things always change in order to make the situation better. instead of arguing about why changing you should present the advantages of being fgpa friendly over spending energy to be more equalitarian @Crypto Baggins

[13-Dec-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lubo> Verus is truth we will witness it soon 😄

[13-Dec-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[13-Dec-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> If anyone is considering using the AAcoin staking feature, I would be very cautious. AAcoin is a very new exchange, and very little information is available about it(At least in English). English support is basically non-existent. I recently made a bitcoin withdrawal from the site, and it took about two hours for it to process beyond "pending review" of course there is no information on what that means. 

That coupled with the fake trading activity on the site means I will be staying away.

[13-Dec-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> The twitter account they link to from their site doesn't even exist, and their about page is complete nonsense and gibberish.

[13-Dec-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> What I would like to know if there is any realistic possibility of supporting staking with a hardware wallet. I know some POS ERC20 tokens it is possible, but understand it's completely different.

[13-Dec-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> @Patrick ManBearPig thank you for the heads-up

[13-Dec-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I think it would be good to set up a 1 vrsc account to get the lifetime staking fee if we change our mind.

[13-Dec-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Fyi some of our community members are presently holding some significant VRSC on the exchange and we definitely would not have given AAcoin a shout out if we felt at all uncomfortable with their comm or actions.  They are very new yes, and keeping your coins on any exchange is always a risk.  As for the slow withdrawals, I also experienced this and it’s unclear why they take a long time to approve withdrawals.  Bottom line, always proceed with caution when dealing with a third party...we haven’t seen any significant reason to distrust these guys more than any exchange however.

[13-Dec-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> @Gloryman good point

[13-Dec-18 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Have you seen any reason to trust them more than any other exchange?

[13-Dec-18 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Nope, personally I treat all exchanges exactly the same unless I see some reason not to use one altogether.

[13-Dec-18 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> They claim to be a team of people from large Chinese companies, but provide no details. Could be former mailroom clerks for all we know. I trade on some really sketchy exchanges, and this one sets off alarm bells.

[13-Dec-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> At the least they could put the effort into hiring a competent proofreader to clean up the translation, and also making sure their links all work. That's just amateur.

[13-Dec-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> AACoin looks shady to me. But I realize I might have some bias against chinese crypto anything. Long story...  I hope they are on the up and up. But I'm staying out...

[13-Dec-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> All I know is that they seemed interested in the project from the time they contacted us. They don't seem to be doing that for all projects, which you might expect if they were more of a scam, and they are the first exchange or pool to build automated staking support. We don't know them more than working with them here, but they seem technically capable, and based on their interest, they integrated and listed Verus for free before even asking for the 25K, which was earmarked for promotion. The trading bot was interesting. They acknowledged it, explained it, and they have turned it off in response to the Verus community. I hope they are trustworthy as they seem when communicating, and it would be great if we could have the ability to know. Lifetime 1% staking fee is a reason to at least register, IMO.

[13-Dec-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Not saying they are a scam. Just sharing personal experience and observations. In my unprofessional opinion, people should tread carefully.

[13-Dec-18 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Still wondering about the possibility of hardware wallet staking at some point in the future

[13-Dec-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> You should always be concerned with how you keep your cryptocurrency. You're responsible, being your own bank and all. You have every reason to be careful. I wouldn't go so far to call everything unreliable to be scam though. I'm too cautious and  wouldn't dare to take the risk in my own current situation, but my understanding is that there are gamblers out here/there that would throw themselves at these kind of things. And AACoin are great for making it available either way, just be careful to engage if that's not your thing.

[13-Dec-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> Ginasismining pools has been offering pooled staking for over a month now.

I nearly choked when I saw the aacoin announcement, 20% fee after the grace period.... lol, wtf.

At ginasis mining it's a 1%fee if you mine on our pool, or 2% of you don't. So just a casual 20x / 10x lower....

We have been doing g it long enough to get a decent rep aswell, with many members with plenty of verus in the kitty.


@Gloryman I have nfi about coding, so would be useless for the security thing. Haha. But thanks for the kind words.

[13-Dec-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> Anyway it is a service. Other exchanges do not offer that. Do their wallets not staking too? Is good if you are a daytrader and get a small bonus!

[13-Dec-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> 20% would be around $15 a month at today's rates if you stake 1 block a day

[13-Dec-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @basti staking just happens automatically on your Verus wallet on the exchange while it has a balance.

[13-Dec-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @John Westbrook Is the 1% fee on the first amount or the all amounts we put on there in future?

[13-Dec-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Kind of cool, even if you’re going to do a single trade, you could potentially cover your trading fees and maybe then some

[13-Dec-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> They agreed to offer 1% forever once you get going.

[13-Dec-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> well if you do your first before jan 31 that is

[13-Dec-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> So, if I put some coins in there in 2020, they  will be staked?

[13-Dec-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> at 1%

[13-Dec-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> if you did some today, then withdrew, then did some later in 2020, yes

[13-Dec-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> that’s the offer they are making

[13-Dec-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> ok thanks for clarifying.
