[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> GPUs were shut out by FPGAs and ASICs relatively

[24-Dec-18 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> and not losing money  on power costs

[24-Dec-18 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> when everyone has FPGAs, you will have gained exactly zero efficiency in mining

[24-Dec-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> profit wise your right

[24-Dec-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> at geoscale

[24-Dec-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> as eveyrone gains the same hardware it equals out

[24-Dec-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but if a single piece of hardware is the same price as say 10 piece of hardware, then even if profits remain the same but power costs go down then you gained something

[24-Dec-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, algorithms should do a good job to make dedicated mining investments, like FPGAs better, but not crushing the non-dedicated investments, like CPUs and GPUs, to the extent they can. that supports the scalable economics AND decentralization

[24-Dec-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that is not stopping progress

[24-Dec-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> algorithms that can do that ARE progress

[24-Dec-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> you can't fully support cpu mining without hurting gpu mining and the like

[24-Dec-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> it can only be done artificially

[24-Dec-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's all relative, and they all have their strengths and weaknesses

[24-Dec-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> no more artificial than proof of work itself

[24-Dec-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> cpu mining has strengths only if the aglo is built to use a cpu's architecture in a way that isnt' supported by gpu's

[24-Dec-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> CPUs are ASICs

[24-Dec-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> technically everything is an asic

[24-Dec-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> point being, PoW is about proof of work. it is arbitrary

[24-Dec-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> as long as it proves work

[24-Dec-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> right now, the algo "artifically" advantages FPGAs

[24-Dec-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, soon, it won't

[24-Dec-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> so your saying that by manualy reducing the effectiveness of hardware you work to maintain the status quo of hardware in a way that makes the network better?

[24-Dec-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> not sure if i worded that right

[24-Dec-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i'm just tryin to see your pov

[24-Dec-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> you want to keep all hardware relative to one another regardless of what they are actually capable of

[24-Dec-18 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> by balancing the proof of work algorithm to leverage strengths and weaknesses of the available hardware worldwide in a way that both incentivizes dedicated mining and doesn't close the door to casual mining, i believe there is much more chance of true decentralization. just because no one is doing it well now doesn't mean it is not achievable

[24-Dec-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> whatever they are capable of, proof of work only proves investment and interest in observing the protocol due to economic risk, nothing more

[24-Dec-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i look forward to seeing how it works out

[24-Dec-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> me too üòÉ

[24-Dec-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> mining isnt an altruistic endeavor unfortuantely

[24-Dec-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> at least pow isn't

[24-Dec-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> if a coin you believe in is profitable then you mine it, if its not profitable then you mine something else and buy what you believe in

[24-Dec-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> thats the reality of mining

[24-Dec-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but i hope you guys are successful with the changes and i'll definitely keep an eye out for how it comes along

[24-Dec-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> will be curious to see how hash rates work out across the board

[24-Dec-18 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> agreed to some extent. there's a thing called "speculative mining", and mining one coin just to sell it and buy another doesn't always get you the same result. when some large group of people lose financially due to factors that were both out of their control and secretly leveraged by a small group, that is quite the opposite of altruistic in a way this community prefers is eventually eliminated by not being rewarded. we prefer a system where people don't have to be altruistic, just one that rewards openness more than a covert approach.

[24-Dec-18 05:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> at the end of the day, only a small amount of miners on your network will mine a coin that isn't profitable; those that believe in the coin or those that are hoping for a pump at some point

[24-Dec-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> otherwise it makes more sense to mine something that is profitable and buy the coin you  believe in

[24-Dec-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> people dont mine at a loss out of the goodness of their heart

[24-Dec-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that's ok

[24-Dec-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> there are lots of variables of course

[24-Dec-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but thats just a rough statement

[24-Dec-18 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> anyways, good talkin to you..glad to hear your pov and wish you Happy Holidays!

[24-Dec-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> at least when things are more equal, we won't lose 70% of the hash power when one data center goes offline. that only happened when many who didn't have the secret FPGA algo found it no longer something they should mine and the PoW became much more centralized. we expect that to go back to a healthier state for the network

[24-Dec-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Happy Holidays to you too!

[24-Dec-18 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Ive been mining at a theoretical loss for a while now...just sayin...

[24-Dec-18 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Bloody hell , iv been mining at a loss since i started i think, maybe a few months ago before the secret algo 1 was getting targeted, i was in profits but that didn‚Äôt last long , 
Profits are nice , but are not everything , just sayin üòé
Merry xmas everyone üéÑ

[24-Dec-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Since fpga‚Äôs secretly came on the network its become practically silly for me to try to compete , im still staking verus and i do keep coming back to mine it now and then but right now i carnt justify leaving my rig clinging on to 2 verus coins a day when its costing me ¬£1.50p a day in electric, i feel bad saying that but all i can do is wait patiently for the fork , to make it fairer for everyone, and not just a few lucky people

[24-Dec-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> everything will be fine

[24-Dec-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zawy> what CPUs are considered effective with the new POW?

[24-Dec-18 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> I see some advantage in having higher clocked core, and probably more cache. So oveclocked xeon could be on top this time.

[24-Dec-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> But there are not so big differences in performance per 1 core.

[24-Dec-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> 1-2 mhs per core in general.

[24-Dec-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zawy> then I just wonder what this means ``` it is far more likely that the CPUs in those PCs will be older, rather than the newest models. With VerusHash 2.0, modern CPUs are strongly advantaged over older CPUs, and the newest, advantaged even more.```

[24-Dec-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @zawy I'm not the expert, but if you look at the #cpu-hashrate channel you can see the perf of CPUs presently and historically, while the hash rate will be much lower after the fork this is a good place to begin determining what's best.  Personally I'm going to utilize an i7-8700. If I was going to buy something new it would be the i9.  I'm curious to see the new numbers after the fork!  In the old hash I always got better perf from my i7 over my Xeon, but again, I'm not an expert on CPUs or the features of each when compared to each other.

[25-Dec-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Verus offers many unique features, too many to list right now, I would check out their website and read the paper I linked

[25-Dec-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @rickiejohnson There is mutual respect for both communities and each lead acts as an advisor on each other's project. Further, KMD got sapling so quickly because of Mike's speediness in Verus.

[27-Dec-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <PascalV> little question , i have a lot of Verus coin .. what happen with them when the 2.0 ?

[27-Dec-18 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Nothing at all bud , your verus coin will stay the same , no change , its just the miners , wallets, and pools that will be getting updated , coins will stay the same , its not a fork like bitcoin cash recently just went through , ending up with 2 different coins , no , verus coins are staying the same üëçüèºüòé

[27-Dec-18 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Just update your wallets and miners

[27-Dec-18 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Before 28th December

[27-Dec-18 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <technopato> Am i correct to assume that the fork will occur on November 28th EST (US Time)?

[27-Dec-18 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> about 40 hours from now

[27-Dec-18 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
