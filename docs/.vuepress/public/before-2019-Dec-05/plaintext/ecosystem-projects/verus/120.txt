[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Speculative

[27-Feb-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> No pre-mine or pre-buy. So I don't know what's of interest to you.

[27-Feb-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TheDruid> so the only coins available are the ones who were mined ?

[27-Feb-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TheDruid> what's the price ATL ?

[27-Feb-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> 2000 sats is pretty much ATL. I may be bias, but it doesn't say much because of the low volume.

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> <https://digitalprice.io/order?url=vrsc-btc>
Change to "6m" or "All" for overview.

[27-Feb-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TheDruid> thanks

[27-Feb-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TheDruid> I was indeed concern by the "truth" of coingecko graph concerning price

[27-Feb-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> is this ever gonna recover?

[27-Feb-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> i mean its completely dead

[27-Feb-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> lol

[27-Feb-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> lol all you want its dead pricewise

[27-Feb-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> its going down like a masternode shitcoin

[27-Feb-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Not really, but ok

[27-Feb-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> basically indicating most of what is mined is insta dumped

[27-Feb-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> So buy it and stake if you want the price to go up

[27-Feb-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I’d say the opposite. Most users hold.

[27-Feb-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> What is your point in complaining about the price

[27-Feb-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> It's a rhetorical question of course because all you do is make outlandish claims about the price and dumping

[27-Feb-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Price is higher / around the same as August last year...

[27-Feb-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> doesn't seem to be going down like a "masternode shitcoin"

[27-Feb-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Classic trolls looking at the 1d trade window

[27-Feb-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Every comment from that guy is claiming the price is dumping, the devs are dumping etc etc

[27-Feb-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Trying to fud a price dip to buy probs

[27-Feb-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> or just the usual nothing better to do

btc wont dump too much
too many people would like to see it dump thats why i dont think it will happen
btc usually seems to follow counter moves on general sentiment
Ted06/12/2018
I think btc will dump to 5000$.
rptr06/12/2018
unlikely
Ted06/12/2018
Maybe 3000$.
😂
rptr06/12/2018
why would that happen

[27-Feb-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> classic

[27-Feb-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> pls, dont feed the trolls.

[27-Feb-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @rptr yeah man, why still come round here anyhow? I mean,  just do a simple user search and you will see every single comment of yours going back months and months is garbage fud and trash talk.

[27-Feb-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @paia you're right.  @rptr,  never mind. That was a rhetorical question.

[27-Feb-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Wow actually Ted was pretty spot on haha

[27-Feb-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> @Ted wen btc back to $6000?

[27-Feb-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hahaha

[27-Feb-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Thanks @Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops 😃

[27-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> @Godballz i wanna sell but not ATL, also i kinda believe that the devs might come with some news

[27-Feb-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I understand. It can be frustrating too when price drops happen or things don't go as you'd like/expected. Instigating does no good to spur that on though, believe me. I think general positivity will do more for the whole space. I say we give positivity a chance! 😀

[27-Feb-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> perhaps would be good to enhance activity towards building better value

[27-Feb-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> @Patrick ManBearPig  btw that was before btc rally to 8.5k lol

[27-Feb-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Do you still only have 113? 😂

[27-Feb-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @rptr thanks for your vacuous opinion. like other things, everyone's got one

[27-Feb-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> btw, all we're doing is building value. perhaps you're looking for a team that focuses only on marketing 😃

[27-Feb-19 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Komodo now supported on Trezor. Staking Verus from a hardware wallet is still my #1 wishlist for Verus

[27-Feb-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Patrick ManBearPig our big focus right now is completing the first PBaaS release. that's a big baby, and I suspect you'll be happier with that than you would with hardware staking when it's out 😃 please let me know after the fact if I'm right

[27-Feb-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I honestly don't even know what it is. Not making any kind of value judgment there, but simply proclaiming my ignorance. On the other hand, I know how F'ed I would be if my VPS/Wallet/Keys and stakes were compromised:(

[27-Feb-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I realize it's not top of your list-- not complaining-- just curious if in your opinion it is in the realm of possibility

[27-Feb-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Patrick ManBearPig that's an easier question to put some thought into. it is not obvious how that would work actually

[27-Feb-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> staking is actually processing transactions like mining

[27-Feb-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, it needs to validate an entire block of transactions and send them to the network

[27-Feb-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> which is what earns the stake reward. Komodo interest is really just interest. not actual staking

[27-Feb-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, it can happen just with the tx sitting there

[27-Feb-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I am sure it's not entirely the same with ERC20 tokens, but there are tokens out there which you can earn rewards while your stake is in a hardware wallet. TNT, Smartcash probably others

[27-Feb-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> but for example Smartcash requires smartnode linked to staking wallet

[27-Feb-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> thats more expensive than running Agama wallet on your computer

[27-Feb-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> It seems like there should be some possible way of proving a stake beyond the coins being held in a hot unencrypted wallet

[27-Feb-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> certainly a chain can be designed to provide passive inflation and distribution of rewards to holders, but to do actual staking, which is rewarding people for their contribution to processing transactions, there has to be some way to validate and process a block. delegating holdings to someone else is potentially doable, but there are centralization issues with that as well, and the staking model we have now contributes in an important way to decentralization that will be even more important with PBaaS

[27-Feb-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> Verus is using just a different approach, that is more user friendly imho

[27-Feb-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> proving a stake is the thing that lets you process the block

[27-Feb-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the block still must be processed by someone

[27-Feb-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and generally, since we only have transactions and blocks as ways to make a record that others can validate, we need to use them for proof as well

[27-Feb-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Ok, so just looking at TNT for example, you hold 5k tnt in an ethereum wallet. Run a VPS which is available to process hashes. If your ethereum address does not hold the 5k tokens then you are not eligible for rewards

[27-Feb-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> but you are running a node which processes transactions/audits etc

[27-Feb-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that's more like a master node

[27-Feb-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> which, IMO, is more a way to push people into holding coins (taking them out of supply) because you have no other use for them, and when people do that, it can temporarily hold the price up

[27-Feb-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Could the processing of transactions be separated from the wallet holding the coins somehow?

[27-Feb-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we believe that with PBaaS, people will have a lot of use cases

[27-Feb-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but also yes. there are ways to do that, which effectively would provide a delegated staking function

[27-Feb-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I've seen some talk of signing or something or other

[27-Feb-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i have a call and then will be focused on PBaaS development. i don't have a way of hardware wallet staking yet without delegation, but i will keep a background thread on it, and we can revisit after PBaaS

[27-Feb-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> 👍

[27-Feb-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> I can give some feedback from recently started ZEL nodes - big PITA, imho impossible to run for average user. masternodes mainly require some Linux / SysOps knowledge, that is out of reach for average user. and to cover the costs of VPS and sometimes coins locked in a way, that user cannot simply unlock them, if they need them.

[27-Feb-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> How much is the theoretical average user staking?

[27-Feb-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> i have a few different responses to that, but I am too tired right now. Time for sleep

[27-Feb-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> depends on amount of staking coins

[27-Feb-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it seems leasing the address to another address is what is wanted?

[27-Feb-19 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Here is the excerpt-

[27-Feb-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> -PBaaS: or Public Blockchain as a Service is a revolutionary new take on the blockchain as a service model entirely unique to Verus that offers the tools and necessary means to build on and utilize blockchain technology for business or personal use. It is similar to using a web hosting service to build a website with, but rather than having to build one by yourself from scratch, the service provider supplies the basics and handles all the necessary tasks from general upkeep to infrastructure maintenance. Since Verus doesn't rely on a centralized authority to work, there isn't any one single point of failure in the network, so in the event of a hack, power failure, data breach or loss, Verus' system is immune while the other options aren't. Instead of relying on a centralized system, Verus elegantly does work for the public by utilizing the public to do work.

[28-Feb-19 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jl777c IMO, with the delegation approach, it comes down to a decision of whether the loss of decentralization from delegation would be worth the convenience. Some projects do allow delegating your coins only for the purpose of staking, which would be pretty easy with CC's, as I guess you might be thinking with the leasing idea. I've also seen critiques of the centralization of these projects that are hard to argue with. I think there's a real security benefit to having all general users of Verus who have a PC staking as much as possible. I guess doing it with delegation might tend to centralize to the same or close to the same entities as pools and farms, which seems to reduce at least some of the security benefit you get from a hybrid algorithm.

[28-Feb-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> wow,thanks,verus was born almost one year,i really like it,and respect the hard work of the team,believe we will have a great future.

[28-Feb-19 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> Merge mining,pbaas,and ... must be the future.

[28-Feb-19 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thanks @Godballz for the post and @Ted as well for your support 😃

[28-Feb-19 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No prob and thank you back for all the hard work! Like @ted said, looking forward to PBaaS and merge mining!

[28-Feb-19 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> agreed. leasing is convenient and centralizing

[28-Feb-19 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TheDruid> Seems the mining rewards is pretty high when we look at the sell pressure 🤔

[28-Feb-19 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Funny way of looking at it. Seeing how the rewards are "constant", and other things are variables. Yet, rewards halving in about 882140 blocks, ~ 1,67 years.

[28-Feb-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I don’t think it would be rewards necessarily, as I think no single party is earning that much. It does seem like some one with bags may be selling recently. We will see if they kick themselves when we finish this phase we’re on 😃

[28-Feb-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I just wanted to put these two links here, they're what I've been able to find on some of the subjects mentioned in the announcements and are rather inspiring to read. Gives me great hope for what lies ahead-
This might help to get an idea of what PBaaS could do vs current implementations of BaaS- <https://blog.chronicled.com/the-argument-against-blockchain-as-a-service-platforms-5396cb31077e>
And something sure to get the mining crowd excited-

[28-Feb-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Merge mining comes with a risk: if 1 entity gathers the hash power to take over 51%, he will most likely also take over all auxiliary chains...

[28-Feb-19 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Only if you can be affected by that Verus is immune

[28-Feb-19 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> How many chains are as robust as Verus?

[28-Feb-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I don't think any single piece has been left to chance there seems to be a lot of care and consideration into the design of this project

[28-Feb-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Sorry for my criticism. I used to do my proposals to my staff, asking them to shoot it down. That was my way to discover weak spots... If it can’t be shot down, it must be a solid proposal...

[28-Feb-19 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No I think a critical eye is important

[28-Feb-19 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I believe the same

[01-Mar-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cryptofist> Anyone around with bash 4.2 knowledge and SSH knowledge? trying to install veruspay...

[01-Mar-19 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zxd666> Why have my POS rewards been much less recently?😇

[01-Mar-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zxd666> My POS address is unfortunately in the new 0.5.6？

[01-Mar-19 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @zxd666 PoS rewards will vary depending on the total verus live and staking, More users could be staking thus less rewards for everyone. I have noticed this change within the last couple weeks also so I expect more people have been staking 😄

[01-Mar-19 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> Maybe market price was low, better stake in wallet then selling low

[01-Mar-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zxd666> Now the wallet has been restarted for too long. What can we do to solve it?
