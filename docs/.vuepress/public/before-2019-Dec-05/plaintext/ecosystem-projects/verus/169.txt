[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> @That_Guy8 hope so. I'll still feel better if I move my funds though

[05-Jun-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @dakgnosis Have you used lite mode?

[05-Jun-19 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> I've done so much movements and experimenting with Agama I don't even know lol.

[05-Jun-19 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Well then. If there is a chance you used lite mode I‚Äôd move it. But if you‚Äôve only used native mode then I wouldn‚Äôt bother.

[05-Jun-19 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Fairly poor formed announcement

[05-Jun-19 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Do this because we will tell you in the coming days....

[05-Jun-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> Yeah, I assume they have informed lead devs and they are busy working on a patch. I've been wanting to use the CLI wallet for a while so this is a good time to learn

[05-Jun-19 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> @That_Guy8 I've been mining on your pool for many months and want to say I appreciate the great job you all do to always keep it online! Thanks!

[05-Jun-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Thanks man. Happy to be here for you guys. And happy to have you all supporting us keeping us with a solid hashrate üòÉ

[dscrdvrsc] <BTC-BTC-BTC> What is the latest version?

[05-Jun-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wookie25> Is the latest version of Agama linked in this discord the "Verus Enhanced Agama" that is safe?

[05-Jun-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> So .5.6a is latest agama and it's safe?

[05-Jun-19 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <michaeltoutjr> @wookie25 @Akira X The announcement message sums it up, but yes

[05-Jun-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wookie25> thank you!

[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> how to know if I am running Verus Enhanced Agama

[05-Jun-19 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> am i safe with ``Version 0.5.6-beta (0.5.6-beta)``

[05-Jun-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> @michaeltoutjr ?

[05-Jun-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> is  Version 0.5.6-beta the Verus Enhanced Agama?

[05-Jun-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yaheardme> the newest wallet is in the gui channel pinned messages

[05-Jun-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yaheardme> 5.6 a

[05-Jun-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yaheardme> I think technically all verus wallets have been considered "verus enhanced" but in #gui-wallet channel the freshest release is pinned.

[05-Jun-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <michaeltoutjr> @gigamesh ^^ is right, but you can also go to the top left hamburger menu in Agama and go to the about page

[05-Jun-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> thanks

[05-Jun-19 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> I love hamburger üòÑ

[05-Jun-19 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @gigamesh The version you posted is not the latest version (I'm missing an `a` at the end), so I urge you to upgrade.

[05-Jun-19 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @gigamesh no version of the Verus wallet, which includes the version you posted was affected by the issue. I think people are just recommending that you upgrade to the latest, but not due to anything related to that issue. If you were running the non-Verus Agama wallet (not in the same 0.5.6 version series), you should check on the latest from the Komodo discord.

[05-Jun-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Spuddyminer> I don't wanna seem dense, but I have to ask. I've been running both KMD Agama and Verus Agama on same machine. Separate installations. When I look in my appdata, I don't know which wallet created what to be honest...can I still use Verus Agama to save my KMD/PIRATE? Lol

[05-Jun-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Spuddyminer> Both wallets native mode. It's not clear if native mode KMD addresses were affected, but I want to move funds anyway.

[05-Jun-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, Verus Enhanced Agama also supports KMD and ARR

[05-Jun-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> (Actually, those are the two extra coins I have in Agama too)

[05-Jun-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Spuddyminer> I wish I knew better wtf is going on, now I see that all my komodo is gone and I have to fill out a form.

[05-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Spuddyminer if you have only ever run native mode you do not need to worry

[05-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Spuddyminer also check #gui-wallet . @grewalsatinder posted useful links, also to the form to request refund.

[05-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Spuddyminer> Yes, I have to fill out the form. I forgot that the address I've been using was actually created by guarda wallet last year and imported into Agama. üò≠

[05-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Spuddyminer> Agama native mode with imported address is no good.

[05-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I saw a few new stakers asking about staking and then I came across this informative article. Since PoS is a big part of this project and since lately there are a lot of new faces who might not have owned a stakeable coin before, I figured this would fit in #general just as well as #staking. If it is more appropriate there, I'll be happy to move it. üôÇ

[05-Jun-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> A wallet hacker was able to steal 1 million KMD

[05-Jun-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <austone> Yeah ‚òπ are there any precautionary steps we, as community, should be taking?

[05-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Our wallet has been tested and is safe

[05-Jun-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> it _is_ fucking node.js, so it is only safe until it is targeted...
I guess this incident will create a lot of resentment against javascript, node.js and all the assorted hipster dildos

[05-Jun-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> JavaScript and Node.js been already a concern in dev communities

[05-Jun-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> AtomicDEX is built using latest programming languages like Flutter.io and Dart.

[05-Jun-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> KomodoOceanQT is already like BitcoinCore QT, using C/C++ code as it's core code and it's GUI in QT language.

[05-Jun-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> That is why these native/core wallets are safer, as the dependency is visible to devs for these wallets.

[05-Jun-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> node.js modules dependencies are nightmare to track.

[05-Jun-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> The issue does not affect Verus Agama, but I believe if you import a seed that was made through Verus or any other way into Komodo Agama, the key can get exposed. If you have not used Komodo Agama, you are fine and should not be concerned. If you have, it would be safest to make a new address in Verus Agama, DO NOT import that into Komodo Agama, and send your coins to the new address. After careful review we did confirm that this issue does not affect Verus Agama and is not a weakness in its code or language. We will continue offering Verus Agama (possible rebrand?) and moving it forward in development as a multi-coin solution that will support PBaaS.

[05-Jun-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> well- the issue is that Komodo Agama was explicitly targeted by upstream injection, which can happen to other distros as well in the future, because of the gazillion dependencies

[05-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> yes, rename it from agama, it is like calling it the titanic or hindenburg

[05-Jun-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> oh boy üòê good luck (or whatever good wishes make sense) for everybody involved

[05-Jun-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <super55> Been thinking the whole day, what if a country decided to adopt cryptocurrencies and "MILLIONS" of people will use the desktop wallet or even Hardware wallet. So the questions is, will many people will get the same Seed or Private Key?...any solutions to this problem if this can happen? just curious

[05-Jun-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> we will not live to see a day like that unless something catastrophic happens(world wars, etc). Even if crypto gets mass adoption in the current state, gov will probably issue it's own centralized coins where you could reverse a fraudulent payment or stuff like that. And real crypto coins will live alongside.

[05-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> @jl777c  is the cli build from your repo subject to the vulnerability? (non-verus version)

[05-Jun-19 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cesare1985> Hi, I need to create a new wallet on Verus Agama? Or I'm safe with the old wallet?

[05-Jun-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> maybe someone can steal my lost our and zex for me:smiley_abused:

[05-Jun-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> cli doesnt have any npm module dependency, neither does oceanQT wallet, or magnum, or guarada, or ledger. only the agama that included a poisoned module was vuln

[05-Jun-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> but even older versions of the verus windows agama wallet were not vulnerable? I think I created my wallet with that and imported it into my verus cli

[05-Jun-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jun-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @D2D that's basically an approach that would be equivalent to sending all your money to a custom consensus smart transaction and setting rules of how you yourself can access it. You might be able to add safeguards, but still need addresses and keys in order to do that. Once you give up control to the smart contract, you can limit how much damage you can do with your own keys, and how you might change them using other information, which also could limit what damage someone else might be able to do. In any case, if someone gets your keys, which was the issue with Komodo's Agama, they can do anything you can do. If you use some other form of secure information, like biometrics, then eventually, there is still some authorizing information, which if compromised, will be an issue. We will still leave more communication on this to Komodo before in-depth discussion, but we think there are a few things that can be learned from based on what we've seen so far. I wouldn't limit ourselves to a smart contract wallet, and I think if such a code base was attacked in a similar way, it may provide no additional real protection.
