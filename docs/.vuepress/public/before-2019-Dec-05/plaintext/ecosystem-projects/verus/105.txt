John posted this link to logos about a week ago. I guess the svg version is vector so it can be scaled for high rez in any size.
I like the idea of a sticker contest or just have people maybe come up with a bunch of ideas and make something together. I might have a go at it and play around with the logo and some ideas during the week ahead.

[20-Jan-19 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Badfish same here, dont remember doing it for them though which is weird. I do for circle way back and coinbase though

[20-Jan-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phaelon> If you read the article, that's no proof Binance was hacked.  There were discrpencies the hacker provided, that made the pull less valid

[20-Jan-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phaelon> My guess is, the hacker just mnade up a bunch from already available data

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @basti txbit back!

[20-Jan-19 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm ready for round 2!

[20-Jan-19 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @miketout  @Godballz  Of course you're right, I just think they (CPU Miners Club) would like to have someone present over in their Discord to answer questions. That's why they put that into their rules. 
And in my opinion, "Purgatory" is not better than "unloved", in contrary it is probably worse, and Verus might be kicked out of their discord if we can't at least partially fill their "application" form and publish it. That's why I posted it above, so the empty parts could be filled in by people who know. And about their desired mods or devs, I think we could give a hint to come to Verus discord for answers,  if noone else is present there. Guess this could also work.

[20-Jan-19 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Thoskk on the other hand, let em do what they want. I don't see jumping through hoops while work can be done being a priority for the really dedicated projects that are focused on accomplishing goals. We didn't even know about them a few days ago and our activity there I'm sure is welcome too

[20-Jan-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Godballz  I just think this would be good publicity, because it's exactly where a lot of CPU miners meet. Wouldn't take much, if somebody could give me the information missing above, I could post that and see what happens. I just can't be here 24/7, cuz I'm a little busy with live outside discord, too. Else I would do the mod job with pleasure.

[20-Jan-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> oh, gets deleted... great

[20-Jan-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> how can I post this again without it beeing deleted?

[20-Jan-19 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Its just a lot of hoops to jump through when us going there is good for their discord too so I think it's sort of a mutual thing and itd be nice a little leniency on all the rules. It should still be fun

[20-Jan-19 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah I found that out the other day as well. Discord links automatically delete your post

[20-Jan-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I don't really know a way around it but I'm sure they're probably is a simple one that I just don't know

[20-Jan-19 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I already filled it as to my knowledge, I just want it to be completed and checked by people who know better ... I'll try again

[20-Jan-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> kept in now?

[20-Jan-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Godballz  do you see it, too, or is it just me?

[20-Jan-19 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I am actually not sure if we need more profiteering farms on the network. What we need is people who are interested in the project and want to see it thrive.

[20-Jan-19 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I cant

[20-Jan-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ok, one more try, and I only post the minimal lines that should be checked... if it doesn't work, i give up:
```

[20-Jan-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Jan-19 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Gloryman  Not sure if there's a difference.

[20-Jan-19 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> What about the PoW period?

[20-Jan-19 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @miketout  Yes. A few people were saying that we shouldn't spend the funds to get on an exchange. And sure, it is a lot of money. But there is no way around it. I think what we are doing, is right. 
Sorry for the late response. I am watching my niece and my nephew.

[20-Jan-19 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Thoskk I dont know what that means- um indefinite maybe? What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Unknown?

[20-Jan-19 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Do they all have to be filled out?
