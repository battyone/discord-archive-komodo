[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> has anyone any idea aproximetly when the solo mining phase will end and when will we get some pools? I didn't get any blocks since the halving ðŸ˜¦

[07-Jul-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> There were some conversations on here a couple days ago about how pools might be set up while new blocks are so time locked, not sure if that will happen before the time locks end out not. In any case the time locks will be off after the next having, I believe in about 2-3 weeks. I'm not at my computer, so harder to check at the moment. Once the that happens pools will be much safer and more straightforward, and we expect to see multiple pools pop up. We also intend to have an official pool sorry after that.

[07-Jul-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> ok, thank you...still... I am pretty much bullish on this one... nothing changed regarding the feelings I have for this project... I just feel like I am heating up my cpu for no reason :/

[07-Jul-18 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> not sure how long before graphene CPU  becomes available but here is an interesting article https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/08/your-computer-could-be-1000-times-faster-in-the-the-future-thanks-to-graphene?utm_source=Facebook%20Videos&utm_medium=Facebook%20Videos&utm_campaign=Facebook%20Video%20Blogs

[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Roughly July 28th is when 192 blocks end and we halve to 96

[07-Jul-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> is that using 1440/day or what appears to be the slightly lower yield of just over 1400?

[07-Jul-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it was a recent estimate, and since it's only a few weeks in the future, so it doesn't have as much error as trying to predict maturity dates 2 years out

[07-Jul-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> in less than a day, we switch to the correct 50/50 POS, which I belive will give us 1440/day as well (block 67680)

[07-Jul-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> in testing, it has been looking right on target

[07-Jul-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @miketout what has the ratio been for POW/POS?

[08-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @jimboscott I believe it has averaged approximately 55/45

[08-Jul-18 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> PoS 45.71%

[08-Jul-18 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout to confirm something thats been a little confusing and not clear on the blockchain explorer. ... is it 1440/day to POS and 1440/day to POW?
each mined block is getting 192.. not shared.... but I'm not seeing an equlivant POS share for that block
are the POS shares clumped into block payouts?

[08-Jul-18 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> wow,1vrsc=6$

[08-Jul-18 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[slackkmd] <jspook16> Where?

[08-Jul-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> the exchange

[08-Jul-18 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gmoney 50% of blocks go to POS, but the hash rate for POW can still be calculated with 1440 due to the way the difficulty algorithms work

[08-Jul-18 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout  ok thanks. yes that the main thing that I needed to know. My hash formula is using 1440

[08-Jul-18 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout do you have any thoughts on that since the hash spike to 850 on the 4th (i think it was) there has been an incresing numner of poeple saying that they have found no blocks for several days, or luck has been off dramatically? Will anything with the switch at block 67680 go to fix any distribution issues? Do you have any toughts on this?

[08-Jul-18 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Personally, I have .5% of the hash and for sure luck has been off since then. A bunch of junk machines I have have been picking up the slack for all the big machines, so it hasnt been a total loss, but I'm off a few blocks a day for sure for sure, even thogh hashrate has long since stabalized.

[08-Jul-18 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> There were two spikes . Earlier one was to 870ish on the 4th.

[08-Jul-18 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> I'm a believer in randomally random random so all this could just be a part of the cosmos, but I have a sence that there is slight gaming of the system.

[08-Jul-18 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm not aware of a gaming of the system, but if there is one, i would like to know

[08-Jul-18 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I had little since the 4th but picked up 3 in the last 24 hours. Also have close to .3-.5%.

[08-Jul-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> 3-4 for you should be normal
so the void of the last few days is abnormal

[08-Jul-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> which has been common

[08-Jul-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> anyways. clearly I dont have the awnsers.. haha.. I'm just sharing my feeling as someone who has been keeping my own stats,

[08-Jul-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I am pulling as much data as I can to analyze it. I am not seeing anything too odd that lasts for too long.

[08-Jul-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout .. does the ping time to your connected miner nodes affect your ability to deliver hash?

[08-Jul-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if someone spikes in a big way on hash rate, they could theoretically take a few more blocks and then drop off completely and let others take less as the difficulty adjusts. with the POS, they should be thwarted from really messing with the chain too much, and even with a big spike, the POS should prevent them from getting over 51%. since we've been low on POS, there's been an opening for more than 51%, but that is closing in a little over an hour

[08-Jul-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and to get that, someone would have needed a huge hash spike

[08-Jul-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that we haven't seen

[08-Jul-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> and regarding ping time.. Is it possible to blacklist slow server and whitelist fast servers to end up with any competitive advantage?

[08-Jul-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the calculated diff takes a long time to adjust down after a big hashrate spike comes in and goes away. the PoS blocks solve the high diff to slow down the diff from dropping

[08-Jul-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> It is certainly possible to grab maybe 10% of the nethash, but it would be a big costly undertaking. Getting 50%+ would take a team of people and a few thousand $.

[08-Jul-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> ping time doesn't affect your ability to deliver hash, but you could certainly waste time hashing on stale chain tips or not get your blocks submitted without long delays and have them orphaned

[08-Jul-18 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> also the hashrate spike doesnt immediately reflect in higher diff, but I have seen a dramatic drop in my PoW blocks found, which then is followed by a hashrate increase. this is just a delay in the block time diff adjusting and on the way up, likely the PoS mechanism is also dampening the change

[08-Jul-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> That is one question I had about how the algo decides the winner. Is the first to report back or the one with a solve and the lowest timestamp.

[08-Jul-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gmoney we are considering ways to improve the p2p network, and QoS is an important factor.
@jl777c VerusPoS should exactly follow PoW, not dampening, nor destabilizing PoW response on difficulty, but interfering with any attempt to mess with time stamps or get more than 51%

[08-Jul-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Network could be an issue.

[08-Jul-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> PoW diff adjustment to real hashrate and solve times just has some latency

[08-Jul-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yes

[08-Jul-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and with PoS getting half the blocks, it seems it will slow down things by 50%

[08-Jul-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> how many blocks does the diff algo take into account?

[08-Jul-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gmoney with PoS, it's a little complicated

[08-Jul-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> i dont think it is a bad thing, it is just what it is and has a longer latency that pure PoW

[08-Jul-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> in one sense, 45, in another many more

[08-Jul-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> yes within 100 blocks it is adjusting pretty well

[08-Jul-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i don't think PoS will slow response

[08-Jul-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's just a different algo than the normal Digishield in Zcash

[08-Jul-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> PoS can affect adjustment, but equally all the time, regardless of hashrate changes

[08-Jul-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, in one sense, you could say that it does

[08-Jul-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> well I have experienced cases where the real hashrate is drastically lower than the diff, and PoS blocks are coming in ave 60 seconds, but if pure PoW they wouldnt have. if PoS is assuming the hashrate is the diff and the hashrate is lower than diff, it slows down

[08-Jul-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> k.. ya that generally lets me know.. 100 isnt that great.. a hash spike is out within 2 hours then (or less) so shouldnt be an issue why it coinsided with days of lower POW blocks for many..

[08-Jul-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but it does when the hashrate is stable or when climbing or dropping

[08-Jul-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> 45

[08-Jul-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> for PoW, it uses 45 for averaging, but the PoS relative difficulty can go much longer and is often 90. PoW should respond in 45

[08-Jul-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but PoS randomizes its response a little

[08-Jul-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> always

[08-Jul-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but with big spikes, it may take 100

[08-Jul-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> to stabilize, but this is pretty common

[08-Jul-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> still low.. 120 for most equihash coins.. 720 for monero..etc

[08-Jul-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and would be like that without the PoS as well

[08-Jul-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> yes, it seems responsive enough

[08-Jul-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Steve666> Is there anyway to see how many coins are being staked? That could explain the spikes somewhat if someone is not staking 24/7 and has lots of coins

[08-Jul-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> staking won't change that way. it is completely relative to PoW at every block

[08-Jul-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i don't know of a way to see either, because the only time you see is when someone submits a PoS block

[08-Jul-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Ok anyways @miketout  I think its worthwile to look into the ability to deliver equal distribution across the P2P network. Perhaps studing ip addresses.... Although that would only be useful if it could be correlated with hashrates to see if anyone really is getting a network competitive advantage.

[08-Jul-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Steve666> I thought staking is 50% of the hash rate, thus if someone were to stake more for a short period wouldnt the hash rate adjust?

[08-Jul-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I would suspect network latency as an issue. Everything else seems solid. Even 100ms can be big.

[08-Jul-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> staking difficulty is completely relative to PoW and could make a short term change, but should be quickly adjusted for. i guess if someone took huge amounts off completely and back on, but it uses an exponentially adjusted, linear weighted moving average to take into account bursts and adjust more quickly

[08-Jul-18 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i would also suspect network latency may be an issue, as there are definite ways it could have an impact. i think if it is the issue, it could be solved with a way to discover and further decentralize trustworthy nodes, which I've been thinking of, as well as eigentrust++ types of approach with QoS

[08-Jul-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but @Steve666 you could also have a point with big changes in staking supply

[08-Jul-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i can't rule it out without more study, i should say

[08-Jul-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Steve666> That is the only thing that would make sense to me, because it has always declined after a while.

[08-Jul-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Are node connections random or calculated?

[08-Jul-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Steve666> But im a dummy and have no proof either way lol

[08-Jul-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> randomized

[08-Jul-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i shouldn't be up guys ðŸ˜ƒ i'll check in tomorrow

[08-Jul-18 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> get some rest.

[08-Jul-18 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> in other news.. I guess I should shut up because I just found 3 of the last 110 blocks..  haha

[08-Jul-18 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Thanks for your time @miketout ... Really appreciated

[08-Jul-18 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> i think people are just used to mining on pools with steady payout per hour

[08-Jul-18 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> solo mining just doesnt work that way. never has, never will

[08-Jul-18 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Ya @jl777c ... I mean yes .. but no..

[08-Jul-18 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> no matter how much you want it to be a smooth return

[08-Jul-18 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> things seem to be coming back to normal in the last 24 hours

[08-Jul-18 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Silky smooth.

[08-Jul-18 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> but there really was off for a few days for a lot of people

[08-Jul-18 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> i think people are obsessing over when they are not finding blocks, ignoring the times when they are finding more than expected

[08-Jul-18 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> randomly random random..

[08-Jul-18 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> if you only notice when there is a shortage, it will seem something is against you

[08-Jul-18 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and I notice you need to get many many blocks before it all averages out

[08-Jul-18 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> since we see the hashing mechanism and if our node is hashing, then it is just luck

[08-Jul-18 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> I feel I'm pretty even about it..  understanding the highs and lows..  I'm standing by my concern . If it was gamed for a few days, it could happen again..  Or maybe it's just how the oscillations go..

[08-Jul-18 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> oscillation in difficulty is understandable. big oscillation in hashrate is different.

[08-Jul-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> well.. hashrate and diff are directly correlated.. I'm talking osculation in reward distribution..

[08-Jul-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Ok suns up, time for me to sleep aswell
Thanks for the discussion everyone..
