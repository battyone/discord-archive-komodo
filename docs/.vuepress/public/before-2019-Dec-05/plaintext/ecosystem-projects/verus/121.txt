[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> I think there is a difference between being annoying and being a 'scammer'

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Just bought a Pirate coin from @Draeth's new store (<https://physicalcryptocoins.com/shop/>) for Verus using Sapling privacy through the VerusPay plugin. Worked like a chARRRm! And the Sapling pay <--> store "seeing" the payment was under 30 sec

[02-Mar-19 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> OK, I knew this was going to work, but WOW!! @michaeltoutjr and @John Westbrook you guys have worked together to make an awesome purchase experience! I used the VerusPay multi-coin QR code from my wallet home screen. Pointed it at the VerusPay mobile invoice, and one click later, I was done! Best crypto purchasing experience I've ever had.

[02-Mar-19 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Thanks Mike! The mobile wallet is incredibly fast and so accessible and easy to use, such a good user experience!

[02-Mar-19 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I was banging my head on a wall for days on end trying to get it to work, ended up getting @John Westbrook to help and poof, everything is amazing. I can't thank him enough

[02-Mar-19 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I'm getting some screen shots ready. it was literally a one click confirmation, and that included loading the coin (I hadn't gone to Verus Coin in the wallet, just logged in)

[02-Mar-19 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> My pleasure. You in turn helped me figure out the pain points and I should have a fairly automated install script ready this weekend.

[02-Mar-19 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> awesome!

[02-Mar-19 12:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Yeah, when I tested the wallet with VerusPay I was lifting the phone to read the QR and the split second it could see it it was off to the races! It was shocking in the best kind of way lol. Really great work @michaeltoutjr

[02-Mar-19 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> I posted my screenshots in Verus Pay and Verus Mobile.

[02-Mar-19 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> The Blackminer F1 has a bitstream that is now available and somewhat slower price/performance than CPUs

[03-Mar-19 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Mar-19 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> UKMiner is taking pre-orders for a $399 card that, if confirmed, will be just over 1.5x the best price performance of CPUs

[03-Mar-19 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Around what mh will that be?

[03-Mar-19 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it hasn't been shipped yet, but will be open source when it is available, and if they confirm, they will get the bounty

[03-Mar-19 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they say 70 MH/s

[03-Mar-19 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Jskull04> my cpu is mining but not my gpu

[04-Mar-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> @Jskull04 just donâ€™t mine with gpu. Itâ€™s not worth the hashrate

[04-Mar-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jskull04> ah ok

[04-Mar-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It is possible with CCminer, but as dude pointed out: itâ€™s not worth it....

[04-Mar-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> @Jskull04 just take a look into gpu hashrate channel. Last I tried with my 1080 ti it was about 3-4 MH/s ðŸ¥´ verus is best miner with CPU or FPGA

[04-Mar-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jskull04> i saw that but i need to know how to set it up @dude

[04-Mar-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Current 1080ti hashrates are much better, about 9 - 10 MH/s last I saw

[04-Mar-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Please excuse my boldness, @miketout, but isn't that 2080 hashrates? I only see around 3-4MH/s for 1080 in #gpu-hashrate and @paia notes.

[04-Mar-19 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> turns out 2080 and 1080ti are almost the same. @Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops benchmarks on 2080, but 1080ti is very close to the same

[04-Mar-19 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> maybe 500KH/s less or so

[04-Mar-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Ok! I haven't seen it. My 1070 doesn't perform that good anyway. ^^

[04-Mar-19 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> instead of gpu mining you should buy the amount of vrsc worth the price of a 1080/2080 and just stake. You will earn more   With staking instead of mining that stuff with gpu

[04-Mar-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <ethacetin> Can someone explain why the Verus monile wallet app wants permission to use the microphone on my phone (as well as a number of other permissions I don't understand such as controlling my phone and being able to access all my storage and write over it and it pleases)?

[06-Mar-19 12:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @michaeltoutjr can correct me if I'm wrong about anything. as I understand it, it needs storage because it stores data on your phone. I think that one is as simple as that. The audio/microphone is due to the QR code library used needing access to the video camera, which also includes the audio permission. It isn't used for anything by the app, and if you disable audio permission after it is installed it will still work. since it's open source, you can check the source if you have any real concerns

[06-Mar-19 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <michaeltoutjr> @ethacetin Yep, the detailed descriptions of the permissions the app uses, and why it uses them are available at https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Mobile/releases/tag/v0.1.3-beta under the "Permissions" header. Any other permissions stated as required in the install screen are either used for the above descriptions, related in some way to the above descriptions, or possibly added by react-native or gradle during building but never used. We're trying to sort those out before official release

[dscrdvrsc] <ethacetin> Cool. Thanks a lot guys. I'll check that out. I love this project and have the highest hopes for it. 
I look forward to using the mobile wallet and can't wait until the official release. 
I had no idea it supported so many other coins too. That short list already contains like half the coins I consider useful!

[06-Mar-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763

[06-Mar-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Jskull04> hey theoretically and just as an idea to throw out there does anyone think it would be efficient to mine with raspberry pi's?  for verus? im looking at minimal space and power.

[06-Mar-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Mar-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Jskull04 think its been mentioned but not sure a miner has been compiled / built for rpi yet.

[06-Mar-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
