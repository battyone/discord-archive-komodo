[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I thought CMC was a simple application to fill out

[28-Aug-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Or are there minimum volumes involved?

[28-Aug-18 11:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @Hollowman9000 From CMC FAQ
The criteria for a cryptocurrency to be listed is the following:

- Must be a cryptocurrency or a crypto token.  (OK)
- Must be on a public exchange with an API that reports the last traded price and the last 24 hour trading volume. (DP is getting there, it seems)
- Must have a non-zero trading volume on at least one supported exchange so a price can be determined.  (OK)
- For market cap ranking, an accurate circulating supply figure is required. (OK)

If you'd like to have a cryptocurrency listed and it meets all of the criteria, please fill out the request form.

[28-Aug-18 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I thought it was a minimum of $500k

[28-Aug-18 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Maybe that was adding an exchange to CMC

[28-Aug-18 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Right now, it's a question of being on a supported exchange and getting accepted, as far as I know.

[29-Aug-18 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> 2 hours to halving 😃

[29-Aug-18 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I finally staked a block

[29-Aug-18 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I mined for a week and got jack $hit

[29-Aug-18 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Stake 1000 vrsc for 2 days and boom

[29-Aug-18 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <servercookie> @Hollowman9000  you should use the pools  if mining from a single pc i think

[29-Aug-18 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I know

[29-Aug-18 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I mined during the end of the timelocked blocks

[29-Aug-18 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> No pools

[29-Aug-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> How are the pools doing? I have 500Mh and got 4 blocks in the past week solo.

[29-Aug-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz99> Great Job Mike & all of the Verus Team

[29-Aug-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I would say thank you and extend that to all the Verus Community 😃 Best crypto community I could have hoped for when starting the project.

[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> Hey guys, I just read about a mandatory update to agama 0.2.41d on Komodo server. Will it still be possible to use KMD on verus version of the agama wallet or is it better not to do so?

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dukeleto I assume you were posting it because you disagreed with him, but without any commentary from you. am I right?

[29-Aug-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I see he's taking on all of crypto with blithe tweets that have no substance

[29-Aug-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> @miketout : Ah, gawd. I actually know Matt Blaze from a long time ago (via his then girlfriend Jutta Degener). I am a little surprised at his broad brush denouncement.

[29-Aug-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @wistar I'd be happy to talk to him and help him understand, which would likely require a little more than 280 characters

[29-Aug-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> Well, let me see if I can reach out to him. It has been ... over a decade.

[29-Aug-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> @miketout: Did you ever know Josh Benaloh of MSR? He and Blaze are crypto colleagues. He might be a better path but I didn't ever know him very well.

[29-Aug-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I didn't know him really, but I believe we met before. He looks like someone we should talk to. Do you know him?

[29-Aug-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> He'd never remember me, but I certainly had meetings with him in attendance in relation to future vision scenarios for craig.

[29-Aug-18 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @miketout mostly looking to just spark discussion. Matt did help design ZeroCoin protocol, which evolved into Zcash protocol that KMD/VRSC/ZEC all have at their core. I agree about "blithe tweets" and also, he has probably earned the right to be blithe. He just ran a voting machine hacking event at DefCon, he is very deep into the now-and-here election technology world, and seems pretty jaded by fancy new technologies like blockchains/etc

[29-Aug-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i think when you're blasting real tech of real projects, gaining fame and then being blithe about your own failure to do something securely is irresponsible

[29-Aug-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> actually, I confused him with Matt Green from Zerocoin protocol, oops

[29-Aug-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Most likely he is talking about the 999 scammy coins out there that have no tech and are telling people their ICO will solve elections, and has never heard of Verus

[29-Aug-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Matt Blaze is of clipper chip fame

[29-Aug-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> if anything, he is a very informed and knowledgeable devil's advocate, and does deal with day-to-day election machine security

[29-Aug-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> i imagine he is pretty jaded by that

[29-Aug-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> I would love for Verus to prove him wrong, so all those time-locked coins will buy me an island to retire on 😃

[29-Aug-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> what, no lambo?

[29-Aug-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> *scnr*

[29-Aug-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> could be that and the centralized solutions that charge millions of $ to run an election on a private blockchain, where the software looks cool, but they are in as much control over the security as if they used Diebold machines. They gain ground because of ignorance and that ignorance obscuring even the existence of the problems to solve and the value of real solutions, just as scammers obscure blockchain benefits. claiming "all", as if he's an actual expert on the projects he doesn't take time to learn about just spreads ignorance and makes a real solution more difficult to discover and use. if he would make actual credible claims, like "I haven't seen" or "I would like to see" or "I'll give xxx in my challenge to see", then he might contribute value to the discussion

[29-Aug-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> clipper chip - makes a little more sense now. it looks like he did good work on that, which earned his fame. would be nice to see him back up his current criticisms with a paper like that vs. blanket tweets

[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @miketout will it be possible to make privacy only assetchain with verushash ?

[30-Aug-18 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/assetchain-params.html#ac-private

[30-Aug-18 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> we are already testing a test assetchain with privacy only chain, but I wonder if we can use verus algo instead of equihash

[30-Aug-18 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's possible. i haven't ever tested it

[30-Aug-18 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> verushash isn't integrated into the main Komodo yet, and I'm just helping do it in CHIPS. if it was done in Komodo as a one off, without a proper merge, it would almost certainly make it much harder to get other tech moved over.

[30-Aug-18 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> we are testing it right now, if want to join us in #staked channel in KMD discord

[30-Aug-18 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I guess verus code must have the privacy ac params code in it 🤔

[30-Aug-18 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> means the verucoin forked code

[30-Aug-18 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> and if using verus komodod I want to make this privacy only chain, would love to know what will be the suitable params 🙂

[30-Aug-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @miketout @grewalsatinder I am happy to inform you both that -ac_private is already included in Verus master branch: https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/commit/2f151c301925c9959d62d52a82d6ddcbe7971f00 and since -ac_private chains cant have any PoS, it's not compatible with Verus itself, and I am not sure if Verus asset chains will be 50/50 PoS or configurable, but in theory you should be able to use VerusHash + -ac_private together on a pure PoW chain

[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> so can specify verus 100% PoW ?

[30-Aug-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> if so can have a verushash PoW privacy only chain

[30-Aug-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> looked at the verusd script. if just copy it then a privacy only chain will have this command:
`./komodod -ac_name=ARRGH -ac_algo=verushash -ac_cc=1 -ac_supply=0 -ac_eras=3 -ac_reward=0,38400000000,2400000000 -ac_halving=1,43200,1051920 -ac_decay=100000000,0,0 -ac_end=10080,226080,0 -ac_timelockgte=19200000000 -ac_timeunlockfrom=129600 -ac_timeunlockto=1180800 -ac_veruspos=0 -ac_private=1`

[30-Aug-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763

Existing single qubit systems not needing quantum entanglement allow seemingly arbitrarily fast computation, violating the previously-"proven" limit. New limit is unknown. May invalidate POW hashing & crypto keys w/o full QM computers

problem is, there are no price sources for VRSC

[11-Sep-18 09:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
Can't the BarterDEX network be it's own price source?

[11-Sep-18 09:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
it only makes sense to rely on external prices for established markets

[11-Sep-18 09:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
for markets exclusive to BarterDEX it should be the trade activity that sets the price

[11-Sep-18 09:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
and that should be the end goal for all currencies one volume is big enough

[11-Sep-18 09:26 AM] cipi#4502
don't know of such a feature

[11-Sep-18 09:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
I mean you just set the price you want to sell at, and Alices set the price they want to buy at
