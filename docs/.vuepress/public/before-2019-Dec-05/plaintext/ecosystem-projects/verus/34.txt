[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> my first locked block is about to mature...  exciting..

[22-Aug-18 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Mine hits in a little over an hour

[22-Aug-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> What block is the next halving going to occur at? When it goes to 48.

[22-Aug-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> 139680 == 1440 x (7 + 30 + 30 + 30)

[dscrdvrsc] <RoyalCrypto> @miketout we should apply for the Binance coin of the month.  Could be a great opportunity to leverage the halving for cross promotion with the Binance vote https://twitter.com/binance/status/1032100769594372096?s=19

[dscrdvrsc] <nasher> @thedon just came from that link only

[22-Aug-18 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> that's still a forked chain ~120 blocks behind

[22-Aug-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ruplikmastik666> Guys anyone can tell me if the diff is too high to mine to the wallet? pool is needed? also there is just the miner integrated int eh wallet?

[22-Aug-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> who is mining at forked chain? still have 43GH/s  network hashrate

[22-Aug-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I‚Äôm at 130685

[22-Aug-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> One machine has chain height at 130856

[22-Aug-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Other 130854

[22-Aug-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Neither as synced

[22-Aug-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Both only have 4 connections

[22-Aug-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> One machine has chain height at 130856
that is the one on the mainchain, the one 2 blocks behind might or might not be, you need to check blockhashes

[22-Aug-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the 685 is almost certainly on a fork

[22-Aug-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> you can sync with -connect=<ip> using ip of seed node or a known good node on the mainchain

[22-Aug-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> do that once to get it in sync and after that just normally

[22-Aug-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Anyone have some good nodes I can connect to?

[22-Aug-18 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <arton> those are two of mine: 195.128.228.141, 195.128.228.142

[22-Aug-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the forked chain, last I heard was in the 120s. I am not aware of any fork in the 130 range. @Hollowman9000 my guess is that the difference in those heights was simply a network latency issue and two fast blocks. The seednode entries from the announcement should suffice.
The fork was a combination of unfortunate events, but not just random, and it is not an indication that it should happen again. If you don't have 0.3.12a or the seed nodes in your VRSC.conf from the announce, there is still a chance you may hit the fork on a new sync. There do still seem to be some seed nodes that we are getting from the a seed server we don't run that may be still on the fork. The fork was caused by specific coincidental events related to a pool and notaries on an old version, combined with a rule change we unexpectedly pulled in from our merge with KMD that only affected a chain with pools at exactly the time pools were coming online. The new rule from KMD is now active on the chain and there is nothing to contribute along with other events to create the situation again.
Regarding the hash power of the chain, the difficulty is 45 billion, not the hash power, the hash power is about 12 GH/s. There are some people on it still who have not upgraded and/or synch'ed, but it is about 1/500th of the main chain in power.

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @miketout Just noticed that my wallet balance is different on the explorer than it is in my wallet... explorer shows about 191 VRSC more than my wallet...  I think I heard of this happening before but do not remember the resolution or reason.

[22-Aug-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> From @miketout ...
the good news is that the blockchain is right. The easiest and most complete way is through the command line (or settings->CLI) and first requires setting the "exportdir=<path>" in your VRSC.conf to a trusted location on your storage drive. Once you close and restart with that setting, you can run the CLI command, either from the CLI in the wallet or the actual command line:
z_exportwallet filenamenopath
Then you can close your wallet completely, rename your wallet.dat, so that you no longer have a wallet.dat in the VRSC folder, force creating a new one, then load again. Now run:
z_importwallet filenamenopath
which will recreate your wallet from scratch with all keys, leave any fork residue behind, and sync all of your transactions from the chain(edited)

[22-Aug-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> z_importwallet filenamenopath did not work - says cannot open wallet dump file...  üò∂

[23-Aug-18 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> VerusHash, it's a quantum secure hash, which is the fastest algo in the world on CPUs, making the current GPU efforts to support it significantly slower than fast CPUs. it uses Haraka512 V2 as its core, but is its own algo

[23-Aug-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763

[23-Aug-18 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763

Get and compile from verus repo and start synching it. They dont hurt each other just make sure you run verus from inside the verus dir.

[23-Aug-18 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> It's not on the current chain, so you did not actually send it. I advise just waiting, if it goes chain it will start getting confirms, if not it will stay in the sourcing wallet and you will just need to resync.
