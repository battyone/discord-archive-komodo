[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> you can calculate the rest yourself ðŸ˜›

[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> I can mine a lot of Monero in 164 days:)

[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> But I get it

[dscrdvrsc] <Moker> ok, but before we all get to exited; if your hashrate goes to the moon ðŸš€  so is everyone esle's. 
The diff will rise and the outcome of your mining will be more or less the same as it was before ðŸ˜‹

[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> ofc ofc, but maybe not everyone updates their wallet as fast ðŸ˜›

does someone have the libdb_cxx error when compiling with latest ?

[26-Jun-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> We haven't seen any reports of that yet.

so here we are ðŸ˜„ : configure: error: libdb_cxx headers missing, Bitcoin Core requires this library for wallet functionality (--disable-wallet to disable wallet functionality)

will revert to older commit (the one that worked for days), and will try

[26-Jun-18 08:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
btw I didn t need to make with last version, cause everything was just fresh, and it seems calling make clean even on the older commit number outputs the same exact error. Maybe we re not supposed to make clean, but that's what I've been doing with kmd for monthes now, so basically I mimicked the update steps

[26-Jun-18 08:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
a gitpull with ./zcutil/build.sh -j8 is in progress, it seems that it won't stop, but... having that make errors made me ask here

[26-Jun-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> I'm not sure about make clean. I know I've always just rebuilt using zcutil/build.sh

[26-Jun-18 08:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, the make clean is a step I add on kmd everytime I checkout/pull. I'm not a coder, and not fully aware of what it changes without "make clean" and just rebuilding. Maybe that's just an unneeded step, but just in case...

[26-Jun-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> I haven't looked at the makefiles, but my guess would be that the build script and/or make both download files and store them so they don't need to be downloaded on future builds, and also store intermediate files and static libraries that it builds, so those don't have to be rebuilt unless updated. If those are the case, I would expect make clean to purge all of that, which you'd want if there's a problem with that cached info and prebuilt stuff, or if you want to free up disk space, but also means longer builds and more potential points of failure when you build next. I'm happy to be corrected if anyone has more correct or precise info.

like the base mining is somewhat 13M then adding threads just increase by 5~7% per thread

[dscrdvrsc] <yea.ninimi> this is so nice , in the world of crypto identities and crypto assurances, i am glad i got the dev teams assuring word they have not mined until public release
forget your crypto knowledge , i base mine on the devs word

[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it can be verified on the blockchain

[27-Jun-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yea.ninimi> please do share your know

[27-Jun-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> @yea.ninimi  Mike written yesterday how --> You can check to see if anyone has ever mined a block with this approach by checking for a non-zero solution

[27-Jun-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> @yea.ninimi I think Mike was quite clear about the check but,  an image may be easier for someone ðŸ˜ƒ 
Here's the count of non zero solution by all time...as you can see, match exactly what Mike said

[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> what percentage of PoW blocks are the new type?

[27-Jun-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> in the recent hours

[27-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> the dashboard on website is updated @ loadtime

[27-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Jun-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> compute from today midnight; let me know if you need a narrow timeframe

[27-Jun-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> looking good!

[27-Jun-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> What strikes me as odd @TexWiller is that I thought there should be 1440 block rewards every day. Based on the graphic it looks more like 1850-1900. What am I getting wrong?

[27-Jun-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> I like the bottom part with the time to reward for the 3 CPUs ðŸ˜ƒ That's great info. I guess times will still go up a bit as more people move to the new version and network hash power will move up.

[27-Jun-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> (and may go down again when rewards will cut in half)

[27-Jun-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> @karero uhm....let me check, I may have done something wrong

[27-Jun-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> so if all 384 rewards go to the miner.. how does the staking work?

[27-Jun-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> when does 50/50 pow/pos come into play

[27-Jun-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> there should in theory be 720 minted/stacked and 720 mined rewards. The exact ration varies from day to day. It used to 46/47% stacked and 53 or so % mined. With v0.3.8 it should be closer to 49/50 stacked and 50/51% mined.

[27-Jun-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> got it..

[27-Jun-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> second question.. how many confirmations are required before not immature.. Or will it stay immature until the end of the lock period?
