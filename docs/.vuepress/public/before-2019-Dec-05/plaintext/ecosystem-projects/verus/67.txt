[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Godballz it will be close to 100% when people look at their lecky price

[04-Dec-18 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah so I think it's hard to say it's not really a problem it's extremely skewed

[04-Dec-18 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @dukeleto I agree, the whole thing needs forking

[04-Dec-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> ?

[04-Dec-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That means nearly half of all coinbase rewards will soon go into the hands of fpga

[04-Dec-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> many Blackminer F1 current owners, on discord, are complaining that their rewards on VRSC drastically went down in the last few days

[04-Dec-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> they are angry that more people are getting FPGA's, ruining their daily profits

[04-Dec-18 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Haha,

[04-Dec-18 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I saw that

[04-Dec-18 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> the company quoted $14/day profit mining VRSC, as of 11/28/2018

[04-Dec-18 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> they call it "algo1" everywhere

[04-Dec-18 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it's down to around $5 or less, i heard

[04-Dec-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> those numbers use a 0.10/kwh elec cost, as per their hosting

[04-Dec-18 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Yeah, so they can just mine something else I guedd

[04-Dec-18 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Perhaps they will ruin a good thing and find some other coin to suck off of

[04-Dec-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Godballz hahahaha

[04-Dec-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Probably

[04-Dec-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> VerusHash seems to be one of the most power efficient algorithms to run on the F1

[04-Dec-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @dukeleto you mentioned there are more powerful fpgas with more ram which are also currently mining vrsc. what is your source for that comment?

[04-Dec-18 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @John Westbrook the internet

[04-Dec-18 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> F1's are very tiny/inexpensive FPGAs, is one point. There exist "pro" FPGAs, that cost more than your car

[04-Dec-18 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Those FPGAs, people can program to mine any coin. Like Verus

[04-Dec-18 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> those people don't share their bitstreams, they write them for themselves, and paid customers, and maybe hedge funds or VC people

[04-Dec-18 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Blackminer F1 is like the iphone, but some people use ham radio

[04-Dec-18 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> that is probably a $50K fpga rig

[04-Dec-18 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you can reprogram it while it's running

[04-Dec-18 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> i don't even have to power down my machine to follow your fork, when I have the right bitstream

[04-Dec-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> if I owned such a thing ðŸ˜ƒ I don't.

[04-Dec-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Yeah, I have watched many videos of people with super expensive fpga rigs and talking about private bitstreams and secret bitstreams

[04-Dec-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Think logically, if someone had a killer algo, why share it early?

[04-Dec-18 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> the above evidence shows, if you just knock off F1s from the network, you are just disabling the tiniest FPGA's

[04-Dec-18 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you are not disabling professional FPGAs

[04-Dec-18 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> concentrating the power into smaller group of richer miners is worse, right?

[04-Dec-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I thought you said "people have verushash bitstreams for more expensive fpgas..."

[04-Dec-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @dukeleto depends on the affect on the community.

[04-Dec-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> who has verushash bitstreams for more expensive fpgas?

[04-Dec-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> I did say that. It's a very reasonable estimation. I have no proof written in blood for you

[04-Dec-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> lol, not after your blood

[04-Dec-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Whoever writes them will make lots of money, therefore somebody has written it or is writing it.

[04-Dec-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @dukeleto I believe the same thing after looking at the videos of fpga rigs.

[04-Dec-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Until fpga becomes mainstream they are just decentralization vampires. It seems foolish to leave nearly half of verus hash coinbase Rewards to the hands of the few who own fpga that is centralization by definition and seems counterintuitive to what the project began as

[04-Dec-18 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> what is happening now, is FPGAs are becoming trivially easy to use

[04-Dec-18 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> The thing is, fpgas need very skilled developers to creat new algos all the time. So, I doubt the top ones will ever be mainstream. Just half way like f1 miner.

[04-Dec-18 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Do you know how to program an fpga?

[04-Dec-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> FPGAs have existed since much before Bitcoin was invented. It's now becoming mainstream. Less optimized than ASICs, but they are so flexible, as to be more useful

[04-Dec-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> not trivially to program, trivial to mine with, i should say

[04-Dec-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I can't program anything, lol

[04-Dec-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Ah, how do you use it?

[04-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> ssh?

[04-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it acts just like a Z9 mini or similar. Web interface

[04-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> The black miner f1 comes with a team of miners and developers

[04-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> almost the same ugly GUI as bitmain, better css ðŸ˜‰

[04-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> No need for coding skills by the customwr

[04-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you upload various coins you want to mine, select the coin, and set pool details + mine

[04-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I've never used any ASIC so I don't have a reference point

[04-Dec-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Do you mine to a pool?

[04-Dec-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you can only support a few coins at a time, so you can add and subtract them, even while it's running

[04-Dec-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you create your own pool or mine to a public pool

[04-Dec-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Hmm, interesting.

[04-Dec-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> And what if the algo changes?

[04-Dec-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Is this an "on site" thing you need to handle?

[04-Dec-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> that $20/day was verushash, i believe

[04-Dec-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @John Westbrook you seem kind of confused, maybe because you haven't mined a bunch. Go look at some YT videos, it should explain how simple they are to use

[04-Dec-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> "if the algo changes" is what we have been talking about for the last 16hrs or so ðŸ˜ƒ

[04-Dec-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @dukeleto FPGAs are around for a few years, it's just the accessibility that changes now indeed. We did have fpgas in 2013/2014 already. I believe there are good ones that have a solid bitstreams and are mining popular algos. My concern in here is just the fact, that we are such a newb community and quite a fresh coin and that FPGAs right now could really screw us badly in terms of organic growth of community. BTW. they are in the network for over a month now so we should not panic this much, it's done. The question is: do we want to deal with it somehow

[04-Dec-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I only have mined using GPUs and CPUs

[04-Dec-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> My question to that end is how easy is it from the interface to update to the next algo

[04-Dec-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @ok88 FPGAs existed when I started mining BTC in 2011, only custom built ones by "BTC gods" of the time, like ArtForz

[04-Dec-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Is it automated? Do you download it?  I wasn't in this conversation all 16 hours ðŸ˜ƒ

[04-Dec-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @John Westbrook clicking 3 buttons, maybe 2

[04-Dec-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it's like installing a new driver on your computer. they call it "flashing a new bitstream"

[04-Dec-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> And is bitstream the service they update the algo through to you?

[04-Dec-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> a bitstream is just an .exe for an FPGA

[04-Dec-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Ah, okay

[04-Dec-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it's a binary executed on the hardware

[04-Dec-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Do you have to stop mining to do this?  And for how long?

[04-Dec-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ok88 well the way I felt with it is to sell it all and keep an eye not this project and how it develops

[04-Dec-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you must load the bitstream into the FPGA, for it to execute. Like a bios update

[04-Dec-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @John Westbrook like I said, no. You can live update coins, no downtimes

[04-Dec-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> live updates is built into the hardware

[04-Dec-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Ah, interesting

[04-Dec-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> of all FPGAs, it seems

[04-Dec-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> Maybe we need to learn from the experience of projects which claim to FPGA resistance? Surely there are ready-made solutions from other projects

[04-Dec-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it's not specific to the blackminer. The FPGA knows how to update it's own BIOS while it's running, essentially

[04-Dec-18 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> a few parts of the FPGA are dedicated to nothing but updating while running

[04-Dec-18 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> We don't need to be FPGA resistant, it's more about maintaining decentralization, accessiblity to new hardware, and reasonable support for casual miners

[04-Dec-18 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @Takoy_Nahal

[04-Dec-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @John Westbrook agreed, but can't see how all can be maintained with fpgas

[04-Dec-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Cool, thanks for the answers @dukeleto, I have zero experience with an fpga as I said, but sounds like a fun process to learn

[04-Dec-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> @John Westbrook Then you want to sit on two chairs

[04-Dec-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> constant source code updates to invalidate existing bitstreams. But from the developer perspective, it's a nightmare. Also a nightmare for pools and exchanges

[04-Dec-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> exchanges will charge verus money for every update, pools will go down, some pools will not be able to keep up

[04-Dec-18 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> The only viable option I see is Verus Foundation itself making an FPGA miner, that is better in some way. Even if it's about the same, most people would rather give money to Verus community than an fpga company

[04-Dec-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Verus could strategically make a few small changes, on the way there, to give some temporary breathing room. That alone though, is not a full strategy, in my opinion

[04-Dec-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> It is impossible to please everyone, I've never seen such a hashing algorithm where fairly distributed coins among CPU, GPU and FGPA miners, it's impossible. Someone will be slighted. So if to choose between two bad options I would have opposed FPGA fully

[04-Dec-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Also, by the way, on the topic of hashes and hardware, hope everyone saw @Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops impressive update to ccminer! ~27%  improvement I think?

[04-Dec-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> What do you mine with @Takoy_Nahal ?

[04-Dec-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> GPU/POS. Now only POS
