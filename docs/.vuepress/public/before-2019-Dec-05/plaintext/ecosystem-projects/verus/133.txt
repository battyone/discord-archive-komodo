[dscrdvrsc] <dude> ? Don’t get it

[20-Mar-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> you said the balance is increasing more than it could by only staking alone, if i got you right.

[20-Mar-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well, one can redirect rewards using `-pubkey=<somevalue>` to another place

[20-Mar-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it could as well be the collecting address for more than just one operation

[20-Mar-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thats what i'm saying

[20-Mar-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> yeah but it’s still one wallet where the % share is slightly increasing

[20-Mar-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> anyone knows which wallet is DP ?

[20-Mar-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gt> i believe it may be the wallet for the funds komodo collects

[20-Mar-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> Why is it so big ? Is Komodo investing into vrsc ?

[20-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> afaik theres some verus in supernet

[20-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> emphasis on afaik

[20-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gt> i believe there was a deal in the beginning

[20-Mar-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Don’t see why they wouldn’t be

[20-Mar-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> This isn’t plebecoin

[20-Mar-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> There’s real dev firepower at verus

[20-Mar-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> a deal? is there some information about this? don´t get me wrong but around 5% is a bit fishy

[20-Mar-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Sorry guys, no need to worry.  That's just my staking wallet

[20-Mar-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> anybody got a link to the rich list?

[20-Mar-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> <https://explorer.vrsc.0x03.services/richlist>

[20-Mar-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> 🤑

[20-Mar-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bobby1> afaik the top account is jl777's MSHARK fund, so ownership is spread over holders of the MSHARK asset chain

[20-Mar-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bobby1> MSHARK asset was swapped from NXT

[20-Mar-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bobby1> You can check all MSHARK holdings here

[20-Mar-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bobby1> MSHARK is also a top3 KMD account

[21-Mar-19 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> What is MSHARK ?

[22-Mar-19 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Curious to see what it translates into... higher price because of harder competition or lower price because big players have reduced their costs to sell lower while still profitable.

[22-Mar-19 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think the second, which is actually beneficial to me, since I’m exchanging my non-Verus mining rewards into VRSC, to have it stake.

[22-Mar-19 05:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Difficulty jumps all over the place at the moment. Saw yesterday network hashrate below 135 GH/s...

[22-Mar-19 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If VRSC drops 5%, all big miner seem to switch away.

[22-Mar-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Would be strange to see price drop too much, because it's already pretty attractive to buy an amount to stake vs mining. Or keep rewards to stake instead of selling at low price. Of course there's always big stakers who can sell at pretty much whatever price, even if it might be detrimental to their remaining balance.

[22-Mar-19 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don’t expect it to drop much, I think the bottom will be around 2000-2050 satoshi. You really need to drop more than 1BTC worth of Verus to get it lower.... if that happens, I’ll transfer my BTC to drive the price up... unfortunately I don’t have too deep pockets, so won’t be more than .25BTC

[22-Mar-19 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Staking power % remains the same regardless of the network hash, so if price drops it only makes more sense to buy to stake instead of mining equipment.

[22-Mar-19 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed, it does... HODL, HODL, HODL....

[22-Mar-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Only depends on total amount of VRSC staking....

[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> well damn.  Time to reload.  

At any rate, I wanted to give you guys this Article highlighting Veruspay and the bounty we are putting on in conjunction.

[23-Mar-19 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> If you all could post this with Veruscoin takes, z commerce tags and let people know about the bounty, we would be appreciative.   
The first version I wrote felt too "Piratey" SO I wanted to "Verus it up a little.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Great article  @FishyGuts, I posted it on reddit a couple of places too. - <https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/b4dgn9/vrsc_arrr_private_free_and_selfsovereign_payment/> and <https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/b4cvnb/vrsc_arrr_private_free_and_selfsovereign_payment/> .

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Question: are my minted coins from staking automatically added to my staking weight/total after they mature? Or do I have to unshield them? I get confused...

[23-Mar-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @jintaa Shield to private address, then send back to public address to have them staking.

[23-Mar-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> What? @0x03

[23-Mar-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @Cragorn ok, thanks.

[23-Mar-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> @zpajk when miners sell and dump the price it’s easy for top stakers to increase their stake, they just buy at lowest price. When they increase the stake they have a higher chance to get a block reward. In the end are miners dumping the price for the stakerholders. 

At some point there will be a turn. It’s harder for miners to sell for a lower price because the cost are increasing. So the price is increasing. Imho staking is the best option.

[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> Does veruscoin have financial attributes?what is it?what are our applications in finance?

[24-Mar-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well right now Verus is already one of the most secure and decentralized stores of value thanks to its many technical and security features, but since one of Verus' primary goals is a PBaaS network made of multiple cohesive projects all working hand in hand to build security and add value for miners and staker, I believe ultimately it will become an entirely self sufficient full blown economy in it's own right with merged mining and PBaaS creating a positive feedback loop, reinforcing and building upon itself in perpetual growth.
If you haven't read about PBaaS and merged mining yet, the search function should provide you with more insight.  It reallly is revolutionary stuff that the Verus devs are toiling away at and I for one am extremely excited for the future!  @anrahu akeba

[24-Mar-19 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @anrahu akeba This is a brief description actually- <https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/b4la6x/merged_mining_and_pbaas_for_verus_two_peas_in_a/>

[24-Mar-19 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> Thank you for reply,yes,I have already read about PBaaS, I translated Mike’s statement of it to Chinese.I mean for now,whether ICO or IEO,they all give people outside the circle a message:”come and make money”So I wish one day PBaaS have this ability,I think we can.@Godballz

[24-Mar-19 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hopefully it will indeed have that effect- Inspire other devs to build here and grow on PBaaS, and for other miners to join in merge mining their many projects!

[24-Mar-19 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I believe when that time comes, it will leave little other alternatives for miners and project creators as it is difficult enough as it is to make a profit right now. Verus should offer relief and a new hope for a better and more efficient system that was built from the ground up, designed to support and reinforce itself and its users.

[26-Mar-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Verus is up 8% today on multiple exchanges, and trade volume is also up  (guesstimate) 5x of the usual daily volume - any good news that I've missed today? Cheers 😃

[26-Mar-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <satoshwe> I worked on a rebrand concept for Verus and want to share it. I think this would go well on a shirt.

[26-Mar-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> obviously feel free to share it in here. but if you'd like people to take note, use #marketing - #general-discussion gets rather busy at times.

[26-Mar-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that is nheqminer and that one doesn't like the `stratum+tcp://` URI

[26-Mar-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it just wants a hostname:port

[26-Mar-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> Ah

[26-Mar-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> turn `stratum+tcp://na.luckpool.net:3957` into `na.luckpool.net:3957` and all will be good
