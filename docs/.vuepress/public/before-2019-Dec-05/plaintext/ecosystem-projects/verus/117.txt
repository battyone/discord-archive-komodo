[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> sorry üòÑ

[17-Feb-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> Do i have to do something with the sapling update ? Like on ARRR coin to send to the new address ? Don‚Äôt like to lose my funds

[17-Feb-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> are you holding your coins on a z-address?

[17-Feb-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> There is no requirement to do anything with z-addresses on Verus. We do recommend moving funds to Sapling addresses for performance, but there is no requirement or announced timetable for depreciation of old z-addresses on Verus, and we have never announced anything like that. I believe on Pirate, the deadline may have been Feb 15.

[18-Feb-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> no idea what a z address is. I just received the coins in my agama wallet

[18-Feb-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <markv> Hi, noob here. I can't create new wallet in agama?. Anyone here can help? Thanks.

[18-Feb-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> which step?

[18-Feb-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <markv> It wont allow me to register

[18-Feb-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <markv> But when I download the Agama wallet from Komodo is works but the version is v.03.4-beta not the v.0.5.5c-beta

[18-Feb-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> why?it seems fine

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Hey, @miketout ; I'm a few days late with this, but I thought your take on a very interesting discussion from earlier was much needed. Boxalex and another community member were going back and forth on the topic of how fpgas in electricity cheap regions (among other factors), leads to an inevitable centralization of hashing power in areas like China's inner Mongolia, or someplace like that, in spite of the cpu equalization. @boxalex  made some very interesting points (and admirably kept the conversation mature), and seems to be coming from a place of experience. Basically, his argument is, cpu equalization is woefully inadequate if you don't have equalization of the cost of electricity: if a cpu in Berlin runs on electric costs that are 10-15x's more expensive than fpga/cpu farms have access to in parts of China, the code sadly doesn't matter (in preventing centralization), regardless of how ingenious; the cost is inherently too prohibitive and in due time, most of the mining of the coin would be coming from a very specific region, and voila- Centralization. Thanks for your time, @miketout.

[18-Feb-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @miketout- above is a screenshot of @boxalex 's summarizing statement, so to speak...

[18-Feb-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Well, I don't think the Verus team can do anything to equalize electricity rates around the world so what is the point of the conversation?

[18-Feb-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> That's like saying I don't think a crypto dev team can do anything about government monetary policy or censorship, so what's the point? The point is developing an effective solution to the problems facing the world, in case you haven't been paying attention. This is a potential obstacle to Verus' stated goals, hence the point of the conversation is what is Verus' plan to overcome or circumvent it, if they indeed agree that it's an issue. Verus couldn't control secret, unethical fpga mining could they? Did they ask what's the point? No, they did what they've always done and came up with Verus 2.0 along with all its innovative solutions to the problems at hand, regardless of the fact that they couldn't control other actors' actions. So the POINT of the conversation is doing what can be done on the part of Verus to prevent this potential of crippling centralization from derailing the entire mission.

[18-Feb-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> well i think a part of the solution is PoS right?

[18-Feb-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> since PoW is inherently dependant on cost of electricity

[18-Feb-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I think he means further adjustments to the algo to bring CPUs closer to 1:1 with FPGAs but I'm sure that would come with it's own drawbacks such as exposing us to more expensive and out of reach FPGAs and ASICS because the methods used to make it more difficult for FPGAs would make it so only a few could have access down the line. I believe the current algo was designed to create as close to balance while not using some common techniques like requiring expensive ram that other projects chose to use. The FPGAs for those projects are much more expensive. I do agree with as close to 1:1 but not at the cost of much worse centralization further down the line

[18-Feb-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah and PoS helps A Lot

[18-Feb-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> @Godballz If you make the algorithm memory hard, then CPU won't stand a chance until we get HBM on CPUs. So i think the current solution is a nice balance

[18-Feb-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> It would increase the efficiencies of GPUs, decrease CPUs and force more wealthy miners to use higher end FPGAs

[18-Feb-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I agree.

[18-Feb-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @jintaa its an important topic to discuss and I found @boxalex comments interesting but I don't agree with him.

[18-Feb-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Godballz no one would use fpgas for mining 1:1 because of hardware cost. Also, fpgas decentralise imo because it puts the chinese cpu farms out of business.

[18-Feb-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> well there are also FPGA farms too, ideally no one gets put out of business üòõ

[18-Feb-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> All I said was a clarification on what the other dude said if you read what I said I said that the developers likely chose the algo for a good reason

[18-Feb-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Cuttlebit fpga has max 6 selling. Also, its so inefficient that i doubt anyone would build a verus fpga farm on a large scale

[18-Feb-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Godballz oh i see, cool bud i get u

[18-Feb-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> my bad

[18-Feb-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> Yes that's true for the ukminer boards, tho with the code being eventually open source, there will ports to other boards in time

[18-Feb-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Cuttlebit but i still doubt they will be as efficient and therefore likely to farm something else

[18-Feb-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> @Godballz Yea the algo was a major pain to work with for FPGA lol >.>

[18-Feb-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[18-Feb-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @miketout have you considered making the code exclusive for like 6 months to give a chance for ukminer to sell his hardware a limit the a potential immediate jump in difficulty in verus fpga mining ?

[18-Feb-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Any solution that relies on appealing to "better angels" and "have you no shame" tactics is dead in the water. That's not how competition in an open market works, regardless of your personal feelings or morals. I'm flabbergasted at how people don't get this. The only viable solutions are ones that optimize the equality of the playing field as much as possible for everyone, and then let's them have at it. If you think pleading with hardware devs "please! don't sully my beautiful crypto vision with your greedy end runs!!" is even marginally  effective, you don't know how this works. We've ALREADY seen this play out just a few weeks ago- Mike Tout tried to reason with the secret miners and they chose instead to continue making profits (shocker!). That's the whole reason why the team was forced to implement VerusHash 2.0. It's just how markets work, and more importantly, how human psychology/society works.

[18-Feb-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @jintaa you're right. There's no way to control people and it is human nature to look for an advantage, so really it is up to the code to try to equalize things as much as possible and idealistic visions are just that- idealistic, but I do still believe it is good for developers to keep site of them and always keep them in mind and I think that is what we have seen so far here, more than in most projects. Just as it is natural for people to seek advantages, I think it is natural for this type of conversation, and even healthy in the right context

[18-Feb-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I think much of the conversation is naive at best

[18-Feb-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> How can anyone be surprised? You can't release something open source then say "but oh don't use it!"

[18-Feb-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Hopefully no more time will be wasted with the whack-a-mole game, and development on things which will actually improve the coin will ensue-- such as a way to meaningfully protect our stakes!

[18-Feb-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @Godballz I agree 100%- we shd be clear eyed in understanding the inescapable influences of human psychology whilst also keeping hold of our own scruples and ideals.

[18-Feb-19 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well, there could be a solution to make it more distributed among small miners and much less profitable for mining farms ... and it's similar to PoS:
1) allow only solo mining
2) when a miner finds a block, it will be blocked for 100 blocks (just an example) before it's allowed to find another block
3) new addresses must wait the same number of blocks befor they are allowed to find a block.

[18-Feb-19 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> or, as an alternative, all blocks found in between might as well be distributed to the whole mining and staking community, so all would at least benefit a bit.

[18-Feb-19 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> in this case, even pool mining could work

[18-Feb-19 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> or, another idea, there could be a third way to mine: PoC (like Burstcoin does). 
...
And this gives me some more ideas what could be established by VerusCoin ... got to write them down... will post them when I think they're ready to.

[18-Feb-19 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> a pool could have hundreds of addresses enabled to be mined to

[18-Feb-19 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763

[18-Feb-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> sure, I'm not a dev... but if it's working for PoS, I thought it may also work for PoW

[19-Feb-19 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[19-Feb-19 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> it's pretty crazy, have you tried ethash or something like that?

[19-Feb-19 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> I've made some half ass efforts but honestly everything is written for GPU

[19-Feb-19 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> the other problem is that you can't tune Xeons, the GPU guys can downclock to save a ton of money on power

[19-Feb-19 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> The phis are hungry no matter what, and if you're using the memory a lot it just gets worse

[19-Feb-19 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> there's really just no algos out there that are both computationally intensive AND memory-hard, it wouldn't make much sense to design that way

[19-Feb-19 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> fair enough

[19-Feb-19 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> you can't downclock the core and leave the uncore untouched?

[19-Feb-19 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Xeon Phis are great. The socket based ones are a little limited but the PCI-E Knights Landing cards with MCDRAM are amazing just tricky to work with, in a way they‚Äôre halfway between a GPU and a CPU, but much more GPU like. Definitely some potential but I think Intel is phasing them out now.

[19-Feb-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> @CryptoYeti technically the x200 coprocessors were never officially released

[19-Feb-19 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> doesn't stop me from having a couple dozen üòâ  but they're relatively rare. Intel cut a deal with a community member and they were sold salvage/no-warranty

[19-Feb-19 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> the socketed 200 series are essentially identical however, including the AVX512 instructions and MCDRAM

[19-Feb-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> @Cuttlebit AFAIK they are frequency locked like most Xeons, I didn't see anything in the BIOS that would allow me to change frequency

[19-Feb-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Yeah the 200's hardly ever come available. Ive traded in datacentre and exquisite datacentre stuff (the stuff no one else deals in) for 15 years now, seen considerably more FPGA's than Phi's come though my hands

[19-Feb-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> if you're interested I have 16 passive (7240P) cards I could stand to part with

[19-Feb-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> I look at some crypto value every day, like 10 diffrent coins or so. I¬¥ve seen a similarity that they alwas seem to follw each other with going up and down in value, some days all of them drops and som all get a higher value? what does this depend on, I dont get how they are conncted that way? Like today too, right now all of the 10 coins im intresed in have been geeting up in value. Why is this?

[19-Feb-19 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> if you are looking at USD based price and BTC goes up against USD, most crypto is linked to BTC so they go up too

[19-Feb-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I want to note I disagreed with this. I think equalization will bring hardware to a higher variety of people. I also thing that renewables and efficient homes are better than big farms. Just my 2 cents.

Additionally, the economics that will drive these behaviors are really only things you can assume at scale, which we don't yet have, and which when we do, will have other decentralizing factors in place, and maybe even a differently tuned VerusHash algorithm. For example, when people invest in FPGA mining, which will be more power efficient, the cost of direct Verus mining will go up for all, and CPU farms, as they continue to mine, may start to concentrate in specific geographic regions, which should not be equated to the kind of organizational centralization, which is seen as a potential concern for security. At the same time, there is an interesting other effect -- since FPGAs are actually more power efficient, as professional CPU mining seeks geolocation with the lowest power costs, FPGA miners have an easier time competing from anywhere in the world.
