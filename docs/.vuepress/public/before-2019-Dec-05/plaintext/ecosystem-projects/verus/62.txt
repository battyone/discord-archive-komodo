[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> FPGAs have no impact on price. It has impact on supply only. Prices could actually benefit in Short Run, as fixed costs increase. No worries about that ...

[04-Dec-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> Believe me, I do like that the developer is interested in taking control.  It's strength and really good

[04-Dec-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Not to mention it's fully pow and the proportion of fpga to the network I would imagine is smaller. Right now we have ~500mhs vs 64ghs

[04-Dec-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> The underlying fact here is that this project was laid out, with VerusHash particularly, in mind .. for CPU & GPU

[04-Dec-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> you also can¬¥t compare hashrates of two different algos with another

[04-Dec-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> People can do what they want but I'm taking off all my miners and selling my VRSC. I might get back involved in the project if mike forks the shit out of the FPGAs. Nice seeing you all and thanks for the journey, hopefully see you again sometime on another project.

[04-Dec-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> I also like that Monero forked.  I think Verus is being more proactive than Monero was as far as timeline goes.  Monero slept on it too long.  Let's see how fast Verus devs move

[04-Dec-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Gloryman Ahhh not necessary man

[04-Dec-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Seems silly to sell now, but let me set some buy orders first please

[04-Dec-18 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Patrick ManBearPig Lol

[04-Dec-18 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> @Post  You can compare proportionally

[04-Dec-18 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Did Raven have laid out in it's White Paper that it would run a specific algo, unique to Raven, for CPU & GPU mining?

[04-Dec-18 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> and by scenarios

[04-Dec-18 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Let me ask.. 
What benefit do FPGA's bring to a project?

[04-Dec-18 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> i think so yeah, but they also are more fpga friendly rather than asic friendly as more competition is involved

[04-Dec-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Security üëçüèª

[04-Dec-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> what benefit did ASIC bring to BTC?  The argument has always been more hash = more network security.   You know what zero or minimal hash means?  Failure or glitchy crap no one wants.  Which would you rather have?

[04-Dec-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Shouldn't a project be able to do what it wishes?

[04-Dec-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> hell yea

[04-Dec-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> What does a gpu miner do for the project, what a question üòÑ

[04-Dec-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> What doesn't a gpu miner do?

[04-Dec-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Verus is the only crypto I haven't gotten totally shafted on in 2018 so I just hope good things keep coming

[04-Dec-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> You know what Satoshi is thinking right now about BTC even in its current ASIC mined state?   "Mission Accomplished"

[04-Dec-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Fpga does what a gpu miner does, but better with lower electricity waste

[04-Dec-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Patrick ManBearPig The underlying value continues to increase

[04-Dec-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Yii How much more, does a FPGA do than GPU?

[04-Dec-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> depends on the algorithm

[04-Dec-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Why the need for so much?

[04-Dec-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Dec-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> and adoption

[04-Dec-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> More efficient, maybe...
Not good for community

[04-Dec-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> You guys are upset because your GPU's / CPU's arent getting the mining rewards they were. Dont fight change embrace it. This would happen regardless of FPGA's if the project takes off. Dont be short sighted. Also the price argument is ridiculous. Price has increased since I got involved, most the guys buying FPGA's are experienced GPU miners, GPU / CPU mining is dying, change with the times. Nothing can be done to stop it, maybe delay it but not stop it.

[04-Dec-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> It's an indicator... Your coin is loved "this much"

[04-Dec-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Then give everyone with a cpu or gpu, an FPGA

[04-Dec-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It's a community coin

[04-Dec-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> I have 3 6 card 1080ti rigs which I spent plenty money on so I know the pain of a GPU miner right now.

[04-Dec-18 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Im actually holding verus and dont sell it, i begin to like the project. See, adoption üò¨

[04-Dec-18 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> I just choose to change with the times instead of hoping for "the good old days" to return

[04-Dec-18 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Yii üòÅ

[04-Dec-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @eNOz Change with the times, seems to mean do what is more profitable, or better for few

[04-Dec-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> @eNOz  Yep, and you also know how awesome those rigs will be in 2021 for the next bull run.  But at some point Bitcoin won't cycle down as much and leaving the rigs on 24/7 will be no problem to cover bills

[04-Dec-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Maybe I'm wrong

[04-Dec-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> Nope just adapt to your surroundings @Cruz

[04-Dec-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> How about you lay out your surroundings?

[04-Dec-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> There's no single tech that's going to win.  BTC will cycle prices upwards and other techs will be more valuable

[04-Dec-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Like VerusCoin did, in the Verus Vision Paper lol

[04-Dec-18 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> What's so intriguing about this coin?

[04-Dec-18 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Earnings for gpus will never be like 2017, too mich players are waiting on the sideline to turn everything back an as soon as it its profitable again

[04-Dec-18 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Is it the conquest?

[04-Dec-18 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> Lol @Cruz why did you get into Crypto?

[04-Dec-18 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> and how long you been in it?

[04-Dec-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @eNOz Because I love Satoshi's BTC White Paper

[04-Dec-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> most are here for profit

[04-Dec-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> @Yii I disagree.  There will be some other GPU exclusive hot coin and people will hoard GPUs again.  But my point is that eventually bitcoin will hold prices over say... $10K consistently and then that exchange rate will mean more consistent mining profits for anyone rather they mine FPGA/GPU/CPU/ASIC coins or whatever.  this is the blockchain revolution

[04-Dec-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> everyone loves money üòÇ

[04-Dec-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Lambo Moon

[04-Dec-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @eNOz Well there are a lot of projects to choose from

[04-Dec-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I respect the financial side of crypto

[04-Dec-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> Sure, the sad thing is the "popular" ones are only there because they are profitable

[04-Dec-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> Look at ETH

[04-Dec-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> was major with all the ICO's

[04-Dec-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> then they start cashing out cause ETH cant pay rent

[04-Dec-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Nah, as more bitstreams will get developed, gpus will become more obsolet. What new algo? No problem ill make a bitstream üòÖ

[04-Dec-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Can you FPGA with ETP?

[04-Dec-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> But ICOs are good... get a bad name just like mt gox made a lot of people absolutely hate BTC in 2014

[04-Dec-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> Most ICO's are scams

[04-Dec-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> meh

[04-Dec-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> maybe a handful of "good" ones

[04-Dec-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> Valid and interesting way of raising funds.  I really like it.  Good demonstration of blockchain tech

[04-Dec-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Everything can be valid.
Most are bs lol

[04-Dec-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> I've never been so interested in money before Crypto.  The sheer creative element is completely enthralling

[04-Dec-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Verus isn't..
No ICO
No Premine

[04-Dec-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> Sure the mechanism is great, the problem is the "devs" who just disappear. Then you left with an un editable great blockchain that is essentially useless

[04-Dec-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Not this dev team lol

[04-Dec-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> Not saying they will

[04-Dec-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> just 95% of ICO's

[04-Dec-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> Well, interesting commentary.  Thx all for keeping it civil.  I must get some shut-eye.  good night and take care.

[04-Dec-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> or all the premine rubbish

[04-Dec-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> Later @grendel25 üëç

FPGA ‚â† VerusCoin  üòâ

[04-Dec-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> Enjoyed the chat guys üôå

[04-Dec-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Later, @grendel25  . You started out on my side, but over the course of the night, I watched you drift to the dark side üòÑ

[04-Dec-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Anyways, my initial point when I started the discussion was Verus was built and introduced to the world as being resistant to these types of industrial mining hardware. It's what drew a lot of ppl to the project and at least what a lot of ppl, myself included, found to be extremely attractive about it. At the very least, the fact that we're moving away from that ethos is worth taking serious note of. Whether you take the capitalistic "no investment is bad investment" or more idealistic "this project is by the community,  for the community" approach. And I don't see how some in here can be so glib about the possibility that industrial miners such as fpga's cld actually threaten Verus' very meaning as a project. If you think the widespread use, recognizing and adoption of Verus is an inevitability written into the laws of the universe, you need to think again. This sort of development cld pose a mortal threat to a nascent, inchoate project such as this one. Choked into oblivion before it ever had a real shot by the avarice and nonchalance of the powerful few. Keep in mind- an inordinate advantage on the mining side ALSO leads to an inordinate advantage on the staking side. It's a vicious cycle that this project wd do well be remain vigilant for.

[04-Dec-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Wow. I don't want to be glib, but let's look at it another way.

[04-Dec-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Ok.

[04-Dec-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Verus Coin's vision and white papers say that it provides a holistic solution to ASICs, not that it is an ASIC resistant coin. That isn't the key point. We have FPGAs, but is anyone worried about a 51% attack right now?

[04-Dec-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> That just happened to Vertcoin with the market drop. We have talked about hardware being inevitable. I have said it every time I'm asked, but the question is how do we transition.

[04-Dec-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> üëÜ

[04-Dec-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> My only concern is that not all coins are dealing with this just yet so is right now the time for transitioning? No idea and this seems like a very difficult subject but does this leave us exposed so early on to pump and dumps or centralization?

[04-Dec-18 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We won't get pummeled into oblivion, and we intend to slow FPGAs to reduce their advantage, but if we full on stop them now, we just ratchet the inevitable stakes higher. If instead, we can get an agreement from the FPGA provider that they make the FPGA code open, that the FPGA company will commit to their customers to follow the algorithm change without delaying us, and that the community can get into units with the same economics at a lower price point, this may be a good transition to focusing on what the vision paper is really about, which is PBaaS and the applications that use it. That will be much more of a positive for the future of Verus Coin than repeated forking, IMO. We are asking for a lot, and the foundation is also offering them a large, time locked bounty for their cooperation if they go along with these terms, which are only in the interest of the community. If we can't get an agreement, then I might think it better to take the nuclear option, but if they cooperate with us, it will be a major step in crypto and better for people in the community now than many are expressing or believe IMO.

[04-Dec-18 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> but they used the nuclear option on us by mining in secret

[04-Dec-18 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It is reassuring that you are level-headedly weighing the options and appear to have a plan to say the very least. Let us hope they are at least reasonable and that this all works out for the best

[04-Dec-18 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Gloryman that is kind of a grimy tactic but on the other hand if I were them I wouldn't expect to be welcomed with open arms

[04-Dec-18 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> It's not personal. They want to make a huge profit at our expense. That's the name of the game. So, we either let them do it, cooperate to let them do it or stop them.

[04-Dec-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman they are supporting a lot of coins. Someone implemented our algorithm, and they started selling it. I suspect that however they got introduced to Verus Coin, they were told we'd fork to stop them if we found out. It was certainly our first thought, but because we can, we considered the fact that if they would prefer to cooperate and do better in the process, it could be an opportunity for us to transition. What if we ratchet it up, end up not being able to fork the next ones away, and they prefer to stay uncooperative?

[04-Dec-18 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Then the next uncooperative ones would take over and there is nothing that can be done about it

[04-Dec-18 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> unless we have open FPGAs
