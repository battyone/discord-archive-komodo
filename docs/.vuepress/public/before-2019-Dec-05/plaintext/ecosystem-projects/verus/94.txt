[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Tommygun007 you must have a pre-release of the miner. that was the issue fixed just before the actual release. please update:

[29-Dec-18 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there was an adjustment. we still need more CPU mining, it looks like to get fully on target, but there was a significant adjustment at the fork. difficulty divided by 512

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we can expect it to take a little bit of time to be as smooth again, and it will always have variance. i was actually ready for a bigger change one way or the other.

[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Hey Team! Amazingly smooth transition! Did the network hash rate drop with the fork to about a little over half, is that correct? Is that what you expected? Looks like most miners are actively involved and updated in time.

[29-Dec-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @karero  Network hash still dropping.. i believe its calculated from the difficulty which adjusts over time. I could be wrong on that method, but I do know that the hash is much much lower than currently shown.  it will be in GH/s not TH/s

[29-Dec-18 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Yes @Gmoney I just noticed. Strangely the network hash dropped even further... good point about the calculation. I‚Äôd expect sth in the rage of 5-25% of what it was before, like you said maybe 5+ GH/s

[29-Dec-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> I'm going to make a prediction that the network hash is at 750GH-800GH

[29-Dec-18 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Ups ya I missed some orders of magnitude... @Gmoney ü§ì so 800 GH would be more like 2% of what it was before, right?

[29-Dec-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> ya... ish.. 
and I doubt net hash is any higher than that. maybe lower 
600-800

[29-Dec-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> no shit wait.. my calcs are way off

[29-Dec-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gina Minehart> You gotta remember it's just been dropped back to CPU's as well.

[29-Dec-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gina Minehart> all GPUs are gone.

[29-Dec-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Currently at 5TH, further dropping

[29-Dec-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> wayy off.. spreadsheet error

[29-Dec-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gina Minehart> I'd say around 20GHs.

[29-Dec-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> ya .. based on my current luck.. we are at 28.5GH

[29-Dec-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Very interesting to see how the chain absorbs the ‚Äúshock‚Äù of the fork over some time...

[29-Dec-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> of course.. luck on such a short timeframe is no reliable

[29-Dec-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @Gina Minehart and @Gmoney you seem to be very much in line üòâ

[29-Dec-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the difficulty adjusted immediately, and the hash rate average is catching up

[29-Dec-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> or, almost immediately

[29-Dec-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @miketout is it proportional? Will the same factor for the difficulty adjustments be true for the network hash?

[29-Dec-18 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it should adjust naturally over the next hour or so. it was a factor only put on the prior algorithm's blocks to calculate the difficulty. after they are out of the equation, it should be as normal, just lower hash

[29-Dec-18 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> well, so far, there is a 198% reduction in nethash rate, and yet, there is a 16% increse in difficulty.... lolwut??

[29-Dec-18 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> the calc net average is adjusting quickly now

[29-Dec-18 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> 199% nethash drop

[29-Dec-18 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> wallet mining is roughly 30% slower than nheqminer

[29-Dec-18 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> 6% difficulty increse

[29-Dec-18 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> my figures are also based on the difficulty and nethash at last block before fork

[29-Dec-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> If it‚Äôs proportional to the drop in difficulty I get to 56 GH/s (well bases on my math: current diff 200‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô/ before diff 141‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô (screenshot from 66tbird from community support from 12/20) =0.2/141=0.0014184=0.14%. MuLtiplied with former 20TH/s gets me to 56 GH/s

[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @jbates58 net hash is further dropping. Needs more time to adjust

[29-Dec-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763

[29-Dec-18 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> it has gone UP by  6%... shouldnt it be adjusting down??

[29-Dec-18 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i think we're pretty accurate now

[29-Dec-18 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> on both

[29-Dec-18 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> how do you mean @miketout ?

[29-Dec-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it'll bounce a little, but i think we have double digit GH/s and the diff is going up and down as it should right now. with the PoP algo, we do have relatively high variance, but i think we should grow from here

[29-Dec-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Not going to lie..This is somewhat disappointing .. One week to solo mine on a 6 core.. 12 threat i7. These are the numbers when the hashrate started to get away from us when GPU's were taking over (and thats when rewards were at 96 per block). I was hoping on a little glimpse of the glory days

[29-Dec-18 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gmoney this definitely represents a larger number of people, which is good for the project in the long run. There will be CPU farms, but everyone gets similar economics. Having more participants strengthens security, and value is directly related to the network effect as well.

[29-Dec-18 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout of course I'm speaking selfishly with myself in mind. Higher net hash is good for Verus and the project as long as its all good intentioned hash üòÉ

[29-Dec-18 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> I have a feeling this Net hash will back down to high single digits though.

[29-Dec-18 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
