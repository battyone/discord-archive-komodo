[discord] <englal> @jimboscott When your wallet is created, it has a keypool of 100 or so addresses in it. Any time you request a new address to receive to, need a change address when you send funds, or solve a new block via PoW, it will select an unused address from that keypool, an address already in the wallet, and use it. Once it has been used it will show up in the wallet.

[discord] <englal> @Tom Thomas  What OS are you on, and can you tell me when you downloaded Agama, or what the filename is that you downloaded?

[18-Jun-18 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <englal> @jimboscott If you get a block via staking, it can only ever go to the address that staked it.

[slack] <osta> it's a transaction @moker

[18-Jun-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> current marketcap depends mostly on the value of the locked coins. There is a floor amount of several million dollars of the unlocked coins, but with 20x more locked coins, it could easily end up as tens of millions, before phase 2 is released

[18-Jun-18 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> i think KMD is popular as many are from KMD community for obvious reasons, they found out about VRSC first. also few want to sell VRSC, but getting the undervalued KMD is better than BTC (if you believe KMD will be going up in BTC terms)

[discord] <jl777c> it is 16.5GH now. It would be much easier to find blocks if everybody just stopped mining!

[18-Jun-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> keep in mind there are jumbo sized 384 VRSC blocks, 16x bigger than what will be for 2 years starting in just a few months and I expect the hashrate to keep climbing as more and more people find out they can get anything at all (Even if a week) for CPU mining

Maybe it has a button to enable mining or something. I don't know, i don't use windows.

If that's the case, yes, Agama is the only thing that you need to CPU mine.

I am on my work laptop.   Would I be able to set this up in Linux while running the HiveOS?   
I assume blocks found will show in the transactions?  Or will they show in the CLI response (if anyone uses windows).

use `getwalletinfo` to see immature blocks/coins

I honestly feel like the algorithm verus created due to it cpu only has great merit for the ecosystem possibly replacing equihash on kmd in the future. Also isn't verushash quantum resistant. Granted I plan to hold verus and see where this project grows.

[18-Jun-18 07:26 PM] BlackJesus#6161
When I get back from the meetup I'm going to point my r7 1800x and laptop at it and see if I can find some of these early blocks.

[discord] <Shaun> i have 3 pcs and update all my gui wallet form old wallet backup

[19-Jun-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Shaun> But the data of each wallet are different, including quantity, transaction records.

[19-Jun-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Shaun> how to deal with that?

[19-Jun-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <TexWiller> Your wallet uses a keypool: when it starts, it creates a bunch of keys and, for each transasction, one address is being used. If your wallet generates more key after a backup, they are not included in the old backup. How have you imported the backups?

[19-Jun-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Shaun> i just backup my wallet.dat   
And then replace the new wallet file

[19-Jun-18 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <TexWiller> if you make a backup at 10.00AM and your wallet mines a new block at 11.00AM using a new address (assuming that your previous addresses were all used), this block will not be in your backup. Also, to merge wallets, you can't copy multiple wallet.dat (each one is being overwrited by the other). Have a look in faq section, there's a procedure for merging (z_exportwallet & z_kmportwallet)

[19-Jun-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Shaun> ok thanks for your reply

Normal not to have listtransactions filled if blocks mined are immature after reimporting wallet / reindexing ?

[19-Jun-18 06:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
Rescan needed maybe

[19-Jun-18 06:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
Even after a rescan the tx seems wasn t found / added to wallet

[19-Jun-18 06:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
As the tx is on blockchain not a big deal but would like to be able to query listtransactions from any point of mining

seems I got my own answer for address with locked funds, seems funds are deposited on a "sort" of changeaddress. At least it isn't on main.
One question I have then : are those address derived from main one (the one generated with the priv), or just on the fly generated when mining is succesful : 
Derivative would mean reimporting just the priv could make it, but just on the fly would mean they re just locked in specific wallet.dat, then would have to collect all .dat from multiple mining machines waiting for a possible transfer to T-address. 

How does it really work then : Do we have to make regular backups of wallet.dat or just keeping the priv is enough ?

[19-Jun-18 11:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
speaking with it with blackjok3r : seems it s a b address, waiting for the "contract" of mature comes to reality when the lock is reached, but could you confirm it ? that would mean only the priv is needed, and no need to keep multiple wallet.dat

[19-Jun-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> It is not derived. It is a key pool, and the address listed on listttransactions is the address to save the privkey of. I believe TexWiller‚Äôs solution for dumping and merging wallets listed in faq-chosen is the most convenient way to merge wallets.

[19-Jun-18 12:37 PM] Deleted User#0000

[19-Jun-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Seems if the priv key is never revealed, one could still maintain a secret ballot while the entire process could be completely transparent.  Am I right or wrong on this potential?

[20-Jun-18 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> is there a chart of overall hashrate over time? it feels as if it is gaining 5% every day

[20-Jun-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <TexWiller> @jl777c  I'm working on some analytics dashboards; as now I have only historical data (blocks & transactions); I'm afraid there's no way to retrieve hashrate

[20-Jun-18 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <TexWiller> I have the difficulty for each block; is that approach correct:
```
expected_blocks_in_a_day = 1440
avg_difficulty_for_X_day = XXXX
blocks_found_in_X_day = XXX
hash_rate = (blocks_found/expected_blocks*difficulty * 2**32 / 600)
```

????

[20-Jun-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> there is a way to convert from diff to hashrate, just not sure the exact formula. having a chart of diff will show the comparable to hashrate

[discord] <jl777c> looks great and seems to fit what I remember about the hashrate. It sure looks like a steady organic increase

[20-Jun-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <TexWiller> I've took the ActualDifficulty / ActualNetworkHashrate and derived a coefficient of "2.64199"; the chart formula is:

[discord] <idrtis> lets say I have 100 staking VRSC and I send someone 10 VRSC, would I wait 150 blocks again for the staking for the rest 90 coins?

[20-Jun-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> @idrtis it's possible, but not necessarily so. the reason is that if you have one unspent transaction output (UTXO) that is 10 Verus, the other 90 would be untouched and continue staking. If you have one UTXO that is 100, 10 will go to the receiver, and the other 90 will also be sent to a change address, which will reset its age.
