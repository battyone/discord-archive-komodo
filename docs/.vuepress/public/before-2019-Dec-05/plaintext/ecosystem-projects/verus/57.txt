[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @Godballz I think so. The message/text part of z-z should be just as safe from being decrypted as the rest of the transaction info.

[21-Nov-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> I sent some wallet key info to the team once, and I was told to use the message field in a z to z transaction to do so since that was the safest way to share sensitive info.

[21-Nov-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A z-to-z private messaging system would be huge if it could eventually be made as simple as texting

[21-Nov-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> That's a great idea @Godballz!

[21-Nov-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> like hushlist?

[21-Nov-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I have never looked into hush, very cool.  @Godballz check this out: https://myhush.org/

[21-Nov-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh cool thanks  @John Westbrook

[21-Nov-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> And  @jl777c

[21-Nov-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Really, pirate seems best suited to do it right with strict z-address only protocol

[21-Nov-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I will look more into hush as that seems like a genuinely useful case of crypto doing what crypto was meant for

[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> for those interested in the EU market (and Verus should😁 ) this is an interesting, official article: https://www.eublockchainforum.eu/reports "blockchain and gdpr". Verus already has zero knowledge and enforcing all personal data on z-addr should allow polls inside the EU or outside with EU customers. Do not understimate gdpr as it is being enforced much like US SEC is doing with securities

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well Verus continues to innovate and be as clear and transparent as 
possible with users so that's a check on point 4 and as far as not tying people's personal data to themselves, I believe you're correct in that zk-snarks effectively solves this. Good read @Diabolik thanks, I posted a few links related to business adoption and blockchain technology a few posts up in #off-topic that you might find interesting as well

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> According to this recent article, it costs $6,000-$30,000 for VerusCoin to be listed on a small exchange, perhaps the community could donate that relatively small amount? A second exchange would get VerusCoin listed on CMC. https://www.bitcoinmarketjournal.com/crypto-exchange/

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I personally favor Cryptopia of all the smaller exchanges I've tried, it costs about $30,000 to get listed, though.

@Oliver Westbrook - I use it to spiff authors, contributors and developers.  
Others in the community see this and it may motivate them to contribute as well.

[24-Nov-18 06:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It removes the need to load my wallet every time I want to send an author a spiff or a contributor a few ARRR or KMD .  
It's also a culture creation thing...  Most tips are worth pennies, but it encourages discord use, community and discussion.

[25-Nov-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @tothemoon sorry to hear of your loss.  It's true, as @zpajk said, in crypto you are "your own bank."  There's really nothing anyone can do in situations like this, cryptocurrency is decentralized, so there is no "excluding" or blacklisting of wallets, etc, there is no central party in charge.  The best you can do is learn from the experience, identify how you were hacked, and take measures to be more secure in the future.

[25-Nov-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> A few quick tips:

1 - Never save your passwords.  Come up with a formula for passwords and create a different password for EVERY site you use.
2 - For all crypto logins (exchanges for example) use an encrypted email address you never use in any public forum with association to your name.  So there's no way to associate you with the email address (except by exchanges themselves)
3 - Use a complex and long password for your computer

Personally I would not use Agama from a computer that has any potential security leaks (i.e. is used on public wifi's without vpn, is left unattended without locking/securing, work computer, etc)...and avoiding Windows can up your security experience.  If you want to up the security even further, buy a cheap laptop for dedicated use with Agama and similar wallets and never use it for anything else.  

Anyway, again, sorry to hear of your situation and hope you can move on without feeling too down about it.

[26-Nov-18 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> Any password, even a 256 characters, is useless if your computer has been infected; once someone has access to your keyboard, your're fried. Often same apply to 2fa, there are malwares ables to change the addresses you are copying with ctrl-c ctrl-v. Imho, as John said, a dedicated pc/vps is the greatest/simplest security layer an user can add.

[27-Nov-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Nov-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Nov-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it doesnt affect VRSC

[27-Nov-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> and existing asset chains may switch to VerusHash, like BTCH is planning to do.

[27-Nov-18 05:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I think it does affect VRSC - in the sense that they can now truly be seen as innovators, contributors and collaborators.    

VRSC still has lots of utility over a KMD chain in many ways.    They have detailed proof of power and stake guard still as unique.  

Saying these advancements and sharing them in the ecosystem make less of a case for Verus Over KMD is like saying Eth advancements are not effective for erc20 projects which we all know is far from the truth.   

Verus continues to innovate and their advancements now have a wider adoption platform and foundation.    

If the loss of value of a coin was directly correlated on its open source nature, then BTC should be worth zero right?

[27-Nov-18 05:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Pirate is so very grateful for the hard work put into this by Mike and the Verus team.   We’re working on ways to show that appreciation.   

Thanks again everyone here at Verus!

[27-Nov-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Nov-18 05:33 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I understand you meant that and also not in a negative way @jl777c 

I just wanted to point out to those who just skim and scan , that the intangible effect of all this, is far greater than people seem to think.    This type of ecosystem growth and sharing catapults future projects and their development efforts.    New projects can come in to innovate and integrate their ideas with ease as opposed to setting up months of basis and groundwork.  

This is a fantastic compliment to Moore’s Law, but for developers and brings the possibility of the two growing exponentially in a more concurrent fashion.   (Anecdotal of course).

[dscrdvrsc] <firesofmay> Started digging the white paper today. @John Westbrook (Hi John!) told me about Verus yesterday. Been looking at it since then.

About me: I am a software developer by profession. Did lot of QA/Coding at a startup called Helpshift. I am currently living in India.

Since last year, I've bee involved with various crypto startups, helping them with their community building/management. I've worked with Cofound.it, Musiconomi, Kleros in the past. Currently working with Maecenas and Etherisc as their Community Lead.

Cheers!
