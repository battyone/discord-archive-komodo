[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @miketout#8148 Thank you

[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> havent been able to mine for awhile

[12-Aug-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> just got back from work trip

[12-Aug-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> is there anything i can do to check if im mining correctly?

[12-Aug-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> First thing I suppose is check you are on the most recent update of the wallet, for me its gui 0.3.11.

[12-Aug-18 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I think there is a new update out for the cli version and a pending update for gui

[13-Aug-18 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the new 0.3.12 CLI and GUI are both available on https://veruscoin.io . We'll post an official announcement in a couple hours, but for those who want immediate efficiency improvement, it should help

[dscrdvrsc] <tin1260> @miketout we goin to have stratum pool to mine by GPU ?

[13-Aug-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> @miketout Do you need to delete the old files of the C disk?

[13-Aug-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superslack> can anyone help me with why I can send transactions, Iam getting the message Your wallet.dat is not matching the blockchain. Please restart the wallet with -reindex param.

[13-Aug-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @miketout Looks like I am getting about 4-5% better hashrate with 0.3.12 - does that make sense?

[13-Aug-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> @superslack: I had to do this last weekend due to a similar error that may have happened because I did a transaction with a wallet that was slightly out of sync. 
• Exit the wallet and back up your wallet.dat in case something goes awry. Awry is a bad thing.
• Re-start Agama and on the dark-background screen with the Agama logo, click on the upper "Activate Coin" button. 
• Select Verus in the "select coin" drop down.
• Then in the lower "daemon parameter" drop-down scroll down and select the "Daemon param: reindexing blocks from disk" and let it do its thing which in my case took a few mins. I can't remember what it does to let you know when it's done but it was intuitive—even for a technical moron such as me.

Although the following shows Komodo rather than VRSC this is what you want to do:

[13-Aug-18 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @superslack Find it?

[13-Aug-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superslack> Yes I was looking in agama. Thanks

[13-Aug-18 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @miketout some KMD notary node operators like to use official release tags, so if you could tag a release for 0.3.12 on Github that would be cool 😃 https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases

seeing the nheqminer for Verus, is there a stratum implementation to VRSC already, too?

[13-Aug-18 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> <0x03> not quite, but close. more details in #pools

[13-Aug-18 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dukeleto will do

[13-Aug-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> hmmm, seems to be only getting 4 connections

[13-Aug-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> for me

[13-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it is only getting 4 connections on outgoing, which in this release should be better than 8 was on the last. are you in synch or synching?

[13-Aug-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> in sync

[13-Aug-18 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> mining hash has improved10-20%

[13-Aug-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that's a nice improvement, but this was more about scheduling than a change in the algorithm. the likely reason is simply less overhead and more efficient mining with fewer delays.

[13-Aug-18 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there was no change to the actual mining loop

[13-Aug-18 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> yes, I'll keep you in the loop if anything happens in nexty hour

[13-Aug-18 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> looks to be running real smooth

[13-Aug-18 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> were you having any issues before?

[13-Aug-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> yes, drop out

[13-Aug-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> ok. i'd definitely like to hear about your experience on this version

[13-Aug-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> done.
I'm not using the 16 core threadrippers now, seems that staking is heck of a lot better

[13-Aug-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I've been a recent buyer for staking too 😃

[13-Aug-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but I still mine with a lot less horsepower than some

[13-Aug-18 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> killing it with staking 😋

[13-Aug-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763

[13-Aug-18 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> threadrippers settling at about 715 m/h
...is there a way to determine whether the mining was achieved by cpu or stake ?

[13-Aug-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> yes, staking blocks start with 0s and mining nope

[13-Aug-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Norain You need to forward ports to your machine first, if you have only 4 connections it means your port is not accessible from outside of your lan

[13-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> @house what kind of improvement have you seen with staking? I have seemed to be lacking in my staking returns lately... hoping this update changes things 

maybe you have been lucky due to early-ish upgrade?

[13-Aug-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> @ver_User nno ... nothing extra with the upgrade
Seems that if you divide the verus between say 7 addresses ... minimum 1500 each address ... up to about 3000 ... you get more blocks

[13-Aug-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> least that works for me

[13-Aug-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> ah ok

[13-Aug-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> minimum 1500? I have been reading that maximum 700-1000 is a good strategy for transaction sizes? how large are the transactions in your addresses?

[13-Aug-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> @house

[13-Aug-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> they vary

[13-Aug-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> 6 blocks is not uncommon (per day)

[13-Aug-18 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> ok, yeah I have a range too, just having vagely read some advice about maximum transactions sizes when I move them I try to keep them at 700

[13-Aug-18 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> I'll try different addresses but not sure if that will just add time costs - having to shield from multiple addresses will be a pain (until I set up auto staking)

[13-Aug-18 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> actually, its not so bad

[13-Aug-18 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> All you do to update agama is, first make a backup of your wallet.dat file, located at %appdata% folder on windows, the roaming folder contains the komodo folder, in there you go to vrsc folder and in there you will find your wallet.dat file, just make a backup copy of it, keep it safe,
After that, close the %appdata% folder and go to your agama wallet and stop mining and close the wallet,completely.
Then go to veruscoin.io website and download the newest version of the wallet, for gui its 0,3,12,  when its finished downloading, extract it to a folder called agama 0,3,12 that you can create and place where ever you like, i chose my desktop,once its extracted you go to your antivirus and add an exemption for the new agama 0,3,12 folder you just created ,
Now you should be ok to start the new agama 0,3,12 wallet, no need to click activate coin, just the usual in the native mode box , choose vrsc and it should start to sync back up to the block chain and your block or blocks should show up @Eightynine 👍🏼

[13-Aug-18 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> yeah this bloody exclusion... I had to restart my computer after it was "disinfected"

[13-Aug-18 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> I decided to remove komodo folder too and start fresh as I wasn't sure how much as been changed - waiting for sync is a pain though, ooops

[13-Aug-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> Note: I accidently updated with the new version over the top of the old version (on one computer) and everything went fine

[13-Aug-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> yeah I was being cautious due to previously not updating correctly to 311

[13-Aug-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> To be honest i keep hearing the only file you need to back up is the wallet.dat file, but i also tend to air on the side of caution, i backup both the agama folder and the komodo folder thats in %appdata% folder, i dont move them or change them in any way , and iv had no problems updating before,

[13-Aug-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I do understand backing up the whole 2 folders i mentioned is a little over kill and growing in mb size every week, but it makes me feel better some how 😎

[13-Aug-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Forgot to mention , i also delete the remaining old agama 0,3,11 folder from my desktop so i dont get confused and start that one by mistake , just keep the newest agama 0,3,12 folder on your desktop or place of choice

[13-Aug-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763

50

[13-Aug-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> What file did you add the line to? You should add it to VRSC.conf and actually it is no longer required as the default connection has been increased with 0.3.12 to 384 which seems more than enough to be synced.

[13-Aug-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> ok i will try

[13-Aug-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> yeah my sync after making a new komodo folder has been ridiculously slow (15% in nearly 2 hours), so I've re-launched with the old backup, seems fine

[13-Aug-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @house Depends upon how many coins you have.  So... how many mature and transparent coins do you have staking?  If you get 5 blocks per day from staking I am going with 15-18K

[13-Aug-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @Norain it must be all on one line, no linebreak, i.e. `maxconnections=50`

[13-Aug-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @dukeleto Could I have screwed something up when I started using 0.3.12?   I just copied all the new files over the old files.

[13-Aug-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Everything looks right, but immediately I hit a brick wall.

[13-Aug-18 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> yes @jimboscott  I had about 18k

[14-Aug-18 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> @jimboscott: I spent much of the day upgrading to .12 and seem to be getting blocks about the same as before. I did notice one odd thing: syncing .12 took _much_ longer on my 16-core machines than on my i7s and Ryzen 1700s. The latter synced almost instantly whereas the i9s, etc., took 5-10 minutes.

[14-Aug-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I have gone 30 hours with nothing at all.  Was getting 3-4/day.
