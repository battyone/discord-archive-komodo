[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Not asking for it tomorrow either. Just would like to know where it lies on the scale of possibility

[10-Jan-19 07:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @Patrick ManBearPig you're absolutely right about the @ everyone!  I'm still new to and getting used to the great "power" and responsibility that comes with moderating in Discord...and on that note, I want to post back a really valuable and interesting article @Skillachie found and posted yesterday.  Thank you for pointing to this really on-point and informative piece brother! https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/12/28/saas-in-blockchain/#18e7f06d2e1f

And thanks "everyone" and Patrick for "bearing" with me as I get used to and try to better handle the responsibility of moderating things round here!  I truly love this community and truly value being a part of something so meaningful.  Okay, gonna stop being so sappy.  Cheers!

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I get excited by @ everyone, not bothered, but that’s me. Yet, some could just as well be written in #announcements instead. 😃

[10-Jan-19 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> There are already just so many channels. I like getting the notification for the announcement channel. Mining, marketing, etc though...

[dscrdvrsc] <kryptoshi> @Patrick ManBearPig   cannot encrypt wallet but... run it inside a drive encrypted VM, problem solved.

[10-Jan-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> is there a difference between ARRRRR and VRSC ?

[10-Jan-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @dude you can have R transactions on VRSC, while on ARRRRR you can't

[10-Jan-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> does this mean that ARRRRR is like ultra anonymous?

[10-Jan-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> btw: where are all the miners? its like every pool is dead with 1-20 workers

[10-Jan-19 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @dude people mine solo as well 😃

[10-Jan-19 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> And not sure where you see the 1-20 worker stats?  for example, luckpool has ~118

[10-Jan-19 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> But to get back to your previous question about differences between ARRR and VRSC, great question!  yes, there are a lot of differences. I'll share a few of the more distinct Verus specifics 😃  Verus has a unique and new consensus algorithm called Proof of Power which is a 50% PoW/50% PoS algo that solves theoretical weaknesses in other PoS systems (Nothing at Stake problem for example) and is provably immune to 51% hash attacks.  With this, Verus uses the new hash algo, VerusHash 2.0.  VerusHash 2.0 is designed to better equalize mining across all hardware platforms, while favoring the latest CPUs over older types, which is also one defense against the centralizing potential of botnets. Unlike past efforts to equalize hardware hash-rates across different hardware types, VerusHash 2.0 explicitly enables CPUs to gain even more power relative to GPUs and FPGAs, enabling the most decentralizing hardware, CPUs (due to their virtually complete market penetration), to stay relevant as miners for the indefinite future.  As for anonymity, Verus is not a "forced private", allowing for both transparent and shielded (private) transactions...and private messages as well.

[10-Jan-19 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> isnt it quite scary that coins like ARRRR or Zcash exists? How could I ever see the supply? When I find a bug and could doublespend some coins the whole system is broken but noone could ever detect it

[10-Jan-19 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> imho zcash is also the best scam ever due to the beginning of this coin (genesis) and also the dev fees etc.

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Yeah

[11-Jan-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <greentea> @dude  ARRR is secured by dpow, so double spends aren’t likely an issue

[11-Jan-19 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> mobile wallet can pos that is a good news

[11-Jan-19 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> there also many MN coins,they need a vps at least,when it's under attack,you will lost everything,so MN coins is not popular any more

[11-Jan-19 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @oscar please elaborate on the MN issue.

[11-Jan-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> we didn't got MN with vrsc,so that is a taking

[11-Jan-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Yeah but how are they under attack and what’s the issues with needing a vps for the mn

[11-Jan-19 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Railrain> Because:
- the wallet is not encrypted
-VPS is located on the equipment of third parties
   I think so 🤔

[11-Jan-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> with a MN you dont store coins on the VPS

[11-Jan-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> its all stored locally and the MN on the VPS just has the transaction details to prove you own the coins / they are locked and not re spent to claim the rewards

[11-Jan-19 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> someone can gain access to one of my MNs and they would not have access to any funds

[11-Jan-19 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Railrain> @Ginasis Mining Pools But this does not apply to VRSC staking.

[11-Jan-19 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Lux might have a mobile wallet that'll stake...
But, you have to stake over 2100 Lux, at ¢.62 today, to receive .6 Lux, or 1 stake per day. I think their tech sounds impressive. And I like Lux. But if Verus had this, it'd be big... 
Why? I think people like being able to look, on their phone, and see it. Yeah, lol..

[11-Jan-19 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> People do like that feedback 😃 that's why I have my staking machine email me news of new blocks...although I've been meaning to make it more of a "push" notification scenario...right now it's just a cron job every 2 hours.

[11-Jan-19 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> staking with the cli means I can have cron that runs ./verus commands to check for blocks etc.

[11-Jan-19 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> guess I could even make the emails really pretty and maybe have a really fun alert sound just for those?  like the sound the ebay app would make when you sold something (does it still do that?)

[11-Jan-19 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Railrain there was no mention of VRSC staking, quoting what I was replying to "there also many MN coins,they need a vps at least,when it's under attack,you will lost everything,so MN coins is not popular any more"

[13-Jan-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> @miketout Yeah, people have been saying BTC is dead for years now...

[13-Jan-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @OhGodAGuardian that's not what it says. he makes the case that PoW alone is not sufficient to protect a decentralized cryptocurrency over time. Bitcoin or any other chain could evolve, except people need to recognize that pure PoW, maybe the best decentralized option 10 years ago, has weaknesses that people need to not ignore

[13-Jan-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> @miketout It's also making conclusions based on events which could not have happened if Bitcoin were larger.

[13-Jan-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> If it were so large, say, that Intel and Samsung were selling ASICs, they're far smarter in how they operate. Little shortsighted greedy companies like Bitmain simply would not have the ability to compete.

[13-Jan-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I welcome your comment on the post thread @OhGodAGuardian

[13-Jan-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> If they want to comment on how PoW only is a race to the bottom, then in this, I agree... because it is. That's just the truth.

[13-Jan-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> The original model isn't exactly a weakness - it requires the token to have so much value that you have the best and brightest busting ass on more efficient ways to get at that shit. Since it didn't get big enough to attract the ringleaders - but *did* get big enough to attract the shady-ass bottom feeders like Bitmain? Yeah, this resulted.

[13-Jan-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I actually thing there is a problem if a crypto currency  matures and has mainly pos being the way new coins are distributed because it means that people with high amounts of coin get all the benefit of getting the new coin. It might make the incentive of mining reduced because it would probably be better to buy coins instead of mine them.

[13-Jan-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> @Gloryman Initial distribution. You create an impossibility - to mine coins, you must have them. The first coin to exist must be mined. 😛

[13-Jan-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> ... this dude's comment about improvemnents being done to sha256d...

[13-Jan-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> He doesn't get how the fuckin' system is designed to work...

[13-Jan-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> It's not about making it totally fucking impossible to attack. It's the fact that even if you *could* attack it, you're incentivized to mine it and help secure it - because descroying it means yourimprovement to SHA-256d is now worth exactly dick.

[13-Jan-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> It uses human greed to keep people securing it rather than attempting to subvert it.

[13-Jan-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Thats a really interesting way of looking at it. I often wonder about what happens if a currency has such low incentives to mine it. Does it just fall apart?

[13-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yes I saw it happen to a project that claimed to convert gpu mining power into usful rendering tasks similar to golem

[13-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hash just dropped to nothing. No updates anywhere and links started going bad

[13-Jan-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But what about the ever expanding energy demands of pure PoW?

[13-Jan-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That is a flaw by design

[13-Jan-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well at least a "brush it under the rug until it's too big to cover" solution

[13-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> @Gloryman Things die. It's part of life.

[13-Jan-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> The real problem I see with pure PoW is that hashrate has no loyalty at all. In a hypothetical situation with 3 big coins, not just one, that share compatible hash hardware, the current model can incentivize regular 51% attacks on every chain until their value drops to where it is pointless. The only argument that it can be sustainable, necessarily assumes one big winner, which is not what we see as the natural evolution in crypto, and in any fast moving technology, is unlikely to be a stable status quo. Pure PoS is extremely centralizing over time, and as you point out, if there is mining, the first coin needs to be mined. At least with 50/50 strengths are boosted, there is some loyalty to the system in block validation, and there is always the opportunity to contribute and earn from an outsider with work capacity rather than funds.

[13-Jan-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I like how this dynamic seems to take the strengths from each in order to address the weaknesses in either

[13-Jan-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> also all analysis of effects on 51% attacks just arbitrarily conclude that it will destroy the value of the coin. however, that is not what appears to happen. and if being 51% attacked doesnt kill the value of the coin, then all these "attacker wont destroy the value of his coins" arguments lose weight. Of course, maybe over time, it will reduce the value of coins that are constantly attacked, but now scenarios where a coin can be 51% attacked and retain value long enough for the attacker to cashout his stake exists

[13-Jan-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah exactly, I agree. Tha argument never made sense to me
