[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I know if you look on some of the mining pool sites they have guides. I think Ginasis has a pretty comprehensive one if I'm not mistaken

[09-Mar-19 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh there ya go üëÜ

[09-Mar-19 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> your -i number will be different depending on the GPU

[09-Mar-19 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jskull04> yeah but isnt there more to that then just copy and paste?

[09-Mar-19 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> nope

[09-Mar-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> generally not

[09-Mar-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @Ginasis Mining Pools  Yes I got that one to work as charm as well, but not so well with my quadro 600.. @Jskull04 not much more, just doublecheck your adress

[09-Mar-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> apart from changing to your details üòõ

[09-Mar-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> but feel free to mine to my address... üòâ

[09-Mar-19 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @Ginasis Mining Pools Are there any positive effect for the community to mine at Ginasis pool instead?

[09-Mar-19 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 0.75% fee

[09-Mar-19 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> as far as I know this is the lowest fee and will save you VRSC in the long run @fng77  üòõ

[09-Mar-19 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> ok!

[09-Mar-19 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i don't think theres a public pool taking less fee than the colonists' pool right now üòõ

[09-Mar-19 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Hey all.  I notice verus has a very low value ... how many verus we can mine a day on a Radeon 570 ?

[09-Mar-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> there is no amd miner for the verus2 algorithm (yet)

[09-Mar-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that question gets answered about 10 times per day

[09-Mar-19 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Sometimes even by the same people üòâ

[09-Mar-19 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> on that, a celebratory cup of bovril.

[09-Mar-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> because i can.

[09-Mar-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops> rather you than me

[09-Mar-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops> at this hour

[09-Mar-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> who on earth doesn't wake up to a cup of bovril

[09-Mar-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it was like heaven when i first tried it really. how is this no intl. success?!

[09-Mar-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> (yes, i feel very much that bovril is a `general` topic to discuss  )

[09-Mar-19 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops> well it's not for the _specific_ room

[09-Mar-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Ops sorry.  I can use cpu right? How many coins usually can we get? Thanks !

[09-Mar-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> What kind of cpu? My Ryzen 2600 get avg 18 MHs, my A10-9700e does 4.... together 5-6 VRSC daily

[09-Mar-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Oink  this > 3.8GHz quad-core 7th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, Turbo Boost up to 4.2GHz

[09-Mar-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Check he pinned spreadsheet in the #cpu-hashrate channel

[09-Mar-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôm sure there will be such a cpu, or at least something close to it listed

[09-Mar-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Btw I am so new to crypto.   I don‚Äôt understand.  How does a currency get usage and rise in value. .  Y would one use VRSC vs Vertcoin ..    Does it mean anyone can create a crypto .. so interest new world.

[09-Mar-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Interesting *

[09-Mar-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Verus is now in stage 1 of its development. You should really read the vision paper on the veruscoin.io website. That‚Äôll give you a clear indication of its growth potential

[09-Mar-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Most crypto‚Äôs are deflationary. They loose value over time. Due to the potential VRSC has, I think it will be the opposite for VRSC, since you can actually spend the coin, instead f having to exchange them for BTC or ETH

[09-Mar-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> So we may get early adopters advantage?

[09-Mar-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Similar to bitcoin Pioneers? Hahahaha *dreams

[09-Mar-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Should I mine myself or join a pool?  I am going to be a casual MAC miner.  Only do it while working on light tasks on safari.

[09-Mar-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Tried reading the white paper. I am lost.   Is there a over view or infographics üò¨

[09-Mar-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Let me assure you them that there‚Äôs a lot of potential in Verus and keep it at that üòè! See my answer in #mining, but for casual mining I would definitely go to a PPS pool

[09-Mar-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh god  @0x03 @Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops, I looked that stuff up thinking maybe I'd find a yummy new meal..

[09-Mar-19 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @SmeLLyArMpiTs Some useful articles written on Medium. It's a good start- <https://medium.com/veruscoin>

[09-Mar-19 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Thank u. @Oink how do I find a pps pool

[09-Mar-19 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Godballz  ok thanks.

[09-Mar-19 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ginasis is a good pool

[09-Mar-19 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Oink  do you know of a pool of pool I think they call it proxy pool.  Basically it‚Äôs for e even more casual miners.  Folks at vertcoin recommended me .. I am not sure if it is a common thing.

[09-Mar-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @SmeLLyArMpiTs Also this is a post I made the other day and it vaguely sums up many of Verus' current strengths and upcoming features but even since then Mike T has made an announcement in the announcements channel to some even newer features like Merkle mountain ranges that are big deals in their own right.
This is the post with summary- <https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/awuk55/comment/ehu9y47>

[09-Mar-19 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Don‚Äôt know about proxy pools...

[09-Mar-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Thanks @Godballz I am reading the link now.     I don‚Äôt understand stalking.   I feel like trying out solo mining .. is a few hours a day any good for that?

[09-Mar-19 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Oink   I think we continue the mining discussion here .. am wondering if I have a native wallet, can I still join a pool?

[09-Mar-19 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah I'd say pool would be best bet with one cpu

[09-Mar-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes you can. You need an external miner for the pool, like CCminer or nehq. They‚Äôre pinned in the #mining channel. You can even use your wallet to do some threads of solo mining and the external miner to do some threads of pool mining.

[09-Mar-19 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If you use the exchange and pick some up you can stake. In very simple terms, staking is similar to mining but rather than having hashpower your chances of hitting a block are dependent on the amount you have in your wallet

[09-Mar-19 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not even my dedicated Ryzen is solo mining... it‚Äôs in Ginasis pool

[09-Mar-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Oink  noted ..   I kind of feel having my own wallet is more secure and also helps verus right?       There is a miner on verus website.  So I use that to mine to a pool to my address right

[09-Mar-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Godballz do u have a recommended reading? I don‚Äôt understand cause I tot the idea of crypto is u get rewarded for mining.  Staking is new to me.

[09-Mar-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Right... my wallet is also staking the coins I earn, but they get moved to the staking pool Ginasis has, so usually <100 VRSC in it

[09-Mar-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And it helps the network, yes.

[09-Mar-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Is verus wallet and miner open source ie pple can see and check the code ?

[09-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Oink   Having a native wallet is not demanding on my cpu / bandwidth ya?

[09-Mar-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not at all!

[09-Mar-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> And yes all open source

[09-Mar-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Mar-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Oink    Just to confirm.  I cannot use the wallet miner to mine pool.  I have to install the verus miner. Right?   ( sorry I know I have lots of questions. But that‚Äôs cause I am very involved!!!! )

[09-Mar-19 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Correct

[09-Mar-19 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> I am new to crypto and likely only will have one.  I want to be on the right train.

[09-Mar-19 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @SmeLLyArMpiTs I believe our very own talented and helpful John Westbrook wrote a staking guide and that can be found in one of the articles on the Medium link I posted above.

[09-Mar-19 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> I have looked Monero..  vertcoin.   Etc

[09-Mar-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @SmeLLyArMpiTs I would say that most people would tell you that's very risky but my bias opinion wants to say you picked a hell of a lucky guess haha

[09-Mar-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Godballz I don‚Äôt mean how to do it. As in an easy concept of it .. heehee.   Want to understand it.

[09-Mar-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hop aboard! I think you chose the right train!

[09-Mar-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No shortcuts on understanding it: you‚Äôll need to read the Verus white paper to fully understand...

[09-Mar-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I imagine it's explained in the article but basically the more coins that you hold in your wallet the better chance you have of finding a block so it's similar to mining in that sense but rather than having a hash power you have the size of your wallet competing against other wallets that are staking

[09-Mar-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah really what @Oink said

[09-Mar-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That really is your best bet and it's a good read you may learn a lot

[09-Mar-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Btw.  Which is better for a casual miner? PPS or PPLNS or PPLTS  etc üòÖ

[09-Mar-19 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> also where do they normally display their fee? I am just checking out https://luckpool.net/verus/   But don‚Äôt see any mention of fees.

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> afaict luckpool has the 'best' (in terms of gambling-safety) payout scheme. forgot the name, he mentioned it in #pools a while back

[09-Mar-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Casual: PPS (Pay per share)

[09-Mar-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and thats probably also the question you'll have to ask yourself. it's usually a tradeoff between receiving your payouts earlier and not allowing others to 'fuck with prop'

[09-Mar-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just checked the luckpool page and found `Dedicated Hardware for Servers; NO VPS!`

[09-Mar-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Thank you.    I read the verus notes.  So I understand that since my Radeon 570 cannot mine yet, using the cpu doesn‚Äôt put me at a disadvantage of the Nvidia mates right ?
