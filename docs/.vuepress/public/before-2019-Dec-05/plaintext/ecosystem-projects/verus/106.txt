[dscrdvrsc] <dude> why do you like to get VRSC listed on more exchanges?

[21-Jan-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> my twopence on this would be more broad exposure

[21-Jan-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <GeoAloha> donated! sold my xhv for btc and sent it along -- sadly xhv was taking a beating but had a bit of a bounce this morning so what I sent wasn't nothing

[21-Jan-19 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> although reading in the xhv discord was mad fun before

[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> hahah,me too

[22-Jan-19 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> i really like portfolio tracking in mobile wallet.

[22-Jan-19 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> why portfolio tracking when we have blockfolio?

[22-Jan-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> so you dont need blockfolio anymore.

[22-Jan-19 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the idea is that the wallet knows what you have and can always give you an up to date view of your holdings. it's not tracking portfolios that aren't there or that you enter separately. it's just an automatic function

[22-Jan-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> Does the Portfolio tracking only supports KMD family Coins?

[22-Jan-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lubo> we get it first and thats nice! after if its possible who likes it can get it working evrywere

[dscrdvrsc] <lootz> if you guys havent heard yet cryptobridge androis wallets were hacked . If you use this software change your keys

[22-Jan-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Wow. I'm going to be more careful on github from now on.

[22-Jan-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <lootz> yea just woke up and seen it

[22-Jan-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <lootz> its in cryptobridge discord the ann

[22-Jan-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> that seems to be the main bitshares android wallet

[22-Jan-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <lootz> yup I never used it myself but if people have they should definitly take precautions

[22-Jan-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> What is the total donated so far, toward the CB listing effort?

[22-Jan-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Just doing the calculation now, we have hours left 😃

[23-Jan-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thats a strange one... according to the google 'cache', this page here lists us. the price you see in the cache is fairly recent. but they've either just removed us or are simply broken... `https://www.btc-echo.de/kurs/verus-coin`

[23-Jan-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Banaza> cool

[23-Jan-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Виталий> Hello what miner for verus for AMD ?

[23-Jan-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Виталий no amd miners yet buddy

[23-Jan-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ok... for whatever reason my last msg got kicked

[23-Jan-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> this one works definitely, i've asked somebody who's mining verushash2 using that cpu

[23-Jan-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> with the released binaries you can get from the veruscoin website, maybe it was that url that made a bot go *boom*

[23-Jan-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ...but let me guess i misunderstood it and the original question was about GPUs

[23-Jan-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @Виталий If your AMD rig has a decent CPU you may get a better hash

[23-Jan-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> Noticed KMD is on the Ledger hardware wallets, is there any chance VRSC will be too at some future point?

[24-Jan-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ABK We definitely expect hardware wallet support at some point. Our primary focus right now is PBaaS, which is a broad effort across a number of areas of dev and has started to include business development as well. While we don't want to talk about potential opportunities prematurely, so as to respect confidentiality and also avoid anything resembling hype, we believe there is no single thing we could be focused on that has more potential for value and use of Verus at this time.

[24-Jan-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> Thanks for the reply Mike, makes perfect sense.

[25-Jan-19 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <MMMCCCXXXIII> I have this weird feeling, that CB listing will do bad for VRSC 🙄

[25-Jan-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> listing is always bad for the coin being listed

[25-Jan-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> unless it's a DEX

[25-Jan-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @MMMCCCXXXIII why? @Emmanuel why?

[25-Jan-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> people like to dump

[25-Jan-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> but it will also encourage investment.

[25-Jan-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> on a bear market...

[25-Jan-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> yeah

[25-Jan-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> I'm sure that verus survives the bear market. I think verus is like a lambo in a Beetle chassis. The beauty is still visible.

[25-Jan-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> Verus seems to have a very different community to the usual ICO & Dump crowd, so not sure the DEX listing will be too detrimental

[25-Jan-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I really think this and many listings for the right reasons are only positive, not detrimental. If people wanted to dump Verus, they already have the ability to do so. People sell and there is some volume, but many just don't want to sell at these prices. The closest thing I saw to dumping was when secret mining gave a very small number of people the ability to mine coins much less expensively than everyone else, and we had some people with many coins who had no idea why they should care about the project besides they could snipe it. Right now, a new exchange, especially a DEX with a lot of customers who don't yet know about Verus, will only spread awareness and provide some additional liquidity, that will be more important when PBaaS is released to prevent giant pumps, which are also not healthy, IMO. It should also secure CMC listing, which is another way to spread awareness. In the case of Verus, I see a risk in many small listings, which isn't as much about more selling as it is a distraction from what's important. I think Crypto Bridge listing is only positive, and I'm grateful that we have a community that could pull together as we did to make it happen.

[25-Jan-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout I agree. I have been trading Verus more now recently. There are some big sales of the coin going on but in never pushes the price much below 2900. There is also a lot of big purchasing going on. I for one want to accumulate coins. Hey @miketout , when you develop the PBaas how will you demonstrate it? I'm really curious.

[25-Jan-19 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> btw, with all that said, I hope that people both buying and selling Verus could spread the volume around on the exchanges that do support us. show them all a little love 😉 
@Gloryman the vision paper describes that. there are companies talking about leveraging PBaaS beyond the foundational applications described in the vision paper, which are polls, elections, identity, but nothing I could disclose at this time, since those are companies, not our community project itself. Have you read the vision paper? You might want to take a look, if not: https://veruscoin.io/downloads/papers/VerusVision.pdf

[25-Jan-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout I will spread the volume. I have read the white paper but it can be difficult for a pleb like me to understand. I get the points about polls and creating multiple block chains that can be scaled and rolled into one.  But I thought you might want to test and demonstrate the technology before it gets to being on a business.

[25-Jan-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Like fun polls

[25-Jan-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> or polls on games

[25-Jan-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> or like mock identity

[25-Jan-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the fun polls and polls on games will definitely be part of the follow on work

[25-Jan-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> some were hinted at in the Vision Paper designs

[25-Jan-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> So people can really understand the tech and community members can easily describe it to other interested people.

[25-Jan-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> We could use it to create fantasy soccer game where wallet holders vote for the best players and buy them using assets or something

[25-Jan-19 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> identity is after that. i am extremely confident that once released, it will not be hard to understand. it is all i can do to keep up with both building it and spending time, which I enjoy, with people who would like to discuss using it for some very exciting use cases.

[25-Jan-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Do you mine if I try to create a game that the Verus community could play using the voting polls. I take it we can just create a PBaaS in the wallet and then other wallet users can vote and stuff.

[25-Jan-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there isn't really a way to do that until PBaaS, but I'd be happy to help then. right now, my focus is on building it. also, when I say talking to people, I mean big, corporate use cases that will build revenue generating businesses. I believe that I should at least use a little of my time to encourage those kinds of efforts as I build PBaaS, for the benefit of the project and community. I will not be able to generally help people know how to build on PBaaS until it is working. after that, I'd love to see you and others use it for many things.

[25-Jan-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Sweeeeetttttttt!

[25-Jan-19 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> wowwwww

[26-Jan-19 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <vcoosc> @Gloryman good to see you 😜

[26-Jan-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Still wishing I could get email announcements. I would have donated to the DEX listing fee.

[26-Jan-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey guys, please welcome @vcoosc  to the community. We are both community leaders on RITOCOIN and I have been telling him about the virtues of verus coin. He has a really good cpu and can help add hash and coin holding. 'CPU mining is the future!' , and dont worry, I told him the official slogan line too. 😂  Also, he is very active and helpful to have in the discord channel. We are growing with high quality membership and good people.

[26-Jan-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Welcome @vcoosc 
Always nice to see new members 😎, nice work G man

[26-Jan-19 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Would a few of you maybe join the CPU Miners Club's discord and vote for VERUS (it's in #coin-purgatory). We only need 2 or 3 Votes to keep it in there.

[26-Jan-19 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey guys just my opinion. I think that cpu farms are not good for verus. I think the best thing is to convince people to be interested in the project and then mine if they have a decent cpu.

[26-Jan-19 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> And if someone wants to freelance as a moderator in their VERUS channel, it would be a good idea. I would do it myself, but I may not be online each day, and surely not 24/7.

[26-Jan-19 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Gloryman  Guess we can't choose who will mine Verus, though we might need more miners for distribution and acceptance. The one goes with the other.

[26-Jan-19 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I think that the miner farms just mine and dump in my opinion. Not that there is anything wrong with that. I don't think they care or are interested in the project I think they just want to make quick profit and I don't think it adds to distribution or acceptance. But do what you thin is best buddy.

[26-Jan-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Thoskk wait, how do you vote? I don't think I have yet

[26-Jan-19 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Godballz  In the Verus channel inside the #coin-purgatory, scroll up to the post of Mark [CPUminers.club], there's up and down votes below the post, this is where ^^

[26-Jan-19 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Good news! We made it to the "Minable Coins" channel CPU Miners Club! Thanks to all contributers!

[26-Jan-19 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I temporary took the moderator position for the channel. However, if anybody with more online time wants to take over, let me know! I'm not hellbent to that job 😉

[26-Jan-19 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thank you @Thoskk !

[26-Jan-19 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Thanks @miketout , but it's only a minor contribution compared to what you and @John Westbrook  and all guys from the team do ^^

[26-Jan-19 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> Is there a theoretical max supply for VRSC?

[26-Jan-19 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @ABK  If I'm not mistaken, it's 83'540'184 VRSC. You may also check here: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*GUXCVTqV455RoOQzj9FGSw.jpeg
