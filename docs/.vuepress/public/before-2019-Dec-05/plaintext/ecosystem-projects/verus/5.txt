[slackkmd] <Daemon> AHHH

[23-Jun-18 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[slackkmd] <Daemon> ty sir

[23-Jun-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[slackkmd] <Daemon> Just wanted to confirm back, using my BDEX seed in AGAMA VRSC made my coins visible like @ stated. Very easy!

[23-Jun-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Any liquid it providers for vrsc

[23-Jun-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> I see nothing on orderbook

[23-Jun-18 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[slackkmd] <osta> same I don't see anything

[23-Jun-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[slackkmd] <Daemon> i closed mine... ill put a buy back up

[23-Jun-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[slackkmd] <miketout> @ I am looking into this issue now. @ thanks

[23-Jun-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[slackkmd] <Daemon> I have a buy order up and my swap was fine it is just BDEX not pulling in the info if the address is not fully exposed in AGAMA since Electrum isnt up for VRSC

[23-Jun-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Will we at some point be able to use regular agama for other coins with verus?

[23-Jun-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JoeCrypto> So, I was able to find a block with my slow cpu. 384 VRS, so now I have to wait 2years to unlock the coins? is that correct?

[23-Jun-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @JoeCrypto that could be correct.  How many blocks until your mined coins mature?

[23-Jun-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[slackkmd] <Daemon> There is a number next to the word Immature... that is roughly how many minutes until it is spendable... since 1 minute blocks.

[23-Jun-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> that's about 118 days

[23-Jun-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Most of my blocks are at least a year out.  You got lucky.

[23-Jun-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Unless this really moons about a year from now - in which case I am the lucky one.

[24-Jun-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam - [triforce]> Yeah, that's shorter than any of my blocks...

[24-Jun-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> if I run mining with same `-pubkey` on two machines, which will send mining reward to same address would that affect anything on mining chances?

[24-Jun-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> means can this lower my chances of mining reward somehow?

[24-Jun-18 04:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@grewalsatinder it will send the mining rewards to the same address. It would be the same chance as mining to 2 different wallets

[24-Jun-18 04:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
cool! thanks mate üòÉ

[24-Jun-18 04:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Once there are pools then it will make a difference.

[24-Jun-18 04:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It will even out the luck and get the mining rewards back to ev

[24-Jun-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <elvinsophus> What about staking on two machines with the same wallet.dat? Will chance of getting a staked block double?

[24-Jun-18 07:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No dont think so.

[24-Jun-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @elvinsophus no. you either win or not each time with the same funds, trying more than once won't increase your odds

[24-Jun-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <elvinsophus> Great. That's what I expected.

[dscrdvrsc] <bitcoinB> when willl this be spendable ?:

[24-Jun-18 12:32 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi, I think it is 348340 minutes from the time of mining.

[24-Jun-18 12:33 PM] CrisF#3405
About 242 days?
Not so bad.

[24-Jun-18 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Tommygun007> mine wont be spendable for 331 days lol.  I have not found any blocks for 4 days now lol.  seems like I got shit luck now lol

[24-Jun-18 01:28 PM] CrisF#3405
I haven't been doing well either.

[24-Jun-18 01:29 PM] CrisF#3405
I think I had one over a million minutes.  Somewhere up around the max anyhow.

[24-Jun-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> I'm working on some Verus's blockchain metrics; here's the alpha version http://35.231.87.124/index.html a feedback and some ideas about what metrics are useful is very welcome!!

[24-Jun-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <elvinsophus> I'm in shit luck today again. No block was mined in over 26 consecutive hours with 37 MH/s hash rate, until 5 minutes ago. Never happened before.

[24-Jun-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @TexWiller great stats. üëçüëè

[24-Jun-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> ty, it's just an example; the goal, here, is to crunch as many data as possible to create meaningful views; something, imho, that is not so common in blockchain environment

[24-Jun-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> In the last 100 block stats What happened to the missing blocks (minutes)?

[24-Jun-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> the query returns only mined blocks (where's the hashrate)

[24-Jun-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Can you also get out if the blockchain the transaction volume? Not sure if that‚Äôs really interesting since people move coins between addresses...

[24-Jun-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Ah so if the blick was not mined it‚Äôs minted?

[24-Jun-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Another interesting stat I find is the fluctuation of the network hashrate during the day. It significant. I guess it follows a pattern. Wonder why, people letting their machines run over night?

[24-Jun-18 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> @karero  refresh the page, just added daily total TXs

[24-Jun-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> For the hashrate, I'm collecting detailed datapoint since today; for the historical, I still need help to calculate it from available datas

[24-Jun-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Very cool üôÉ

[24-Jun-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> What‚Äôs included in the tx volume public to public tx for sure. Public to private & private to public as well? Do private to private tx exist? I guess so, those I assume are excluded, aren‚Äôt they?

[24-Jun-18 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <elvinsophus> I think the network hash rate does follow a pattern. During some time of the day I mined more blocks than during the other.

[24-Jun-18 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> it's the count of txid fields

[24-Jun-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Amazing how constant the daily tx volume hovers around 2500 VRSC

[24-Jun-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> as now, the platform has all the fields from block (like getblock X) and transactions

[24-Jun-18 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> I hope to retrieve some community feedback to improve it; haven't found (or haven't be able to üòÉ ) something to compare or to take as inspiration

[24-Jun-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> The txid fields should include private to public, public to private tx, shouldn‚Äôt they?

[24-Jun-18 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> For staking it would be very interesting to know the value of all funds in public addresses. Do people need to have their wallets online - or do you stake offline (the network stakes for you)? Is that something you could retrieve?

[24-Jun-18 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> I should be able to retrieve addresses balance but I need to import all known addresses into the node (as watchonly). It may some take a day or so to import all the datas

[24-Jun-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Wow. Thats great!

[24-Jun-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> here's a more complex example: the today (in this case, Sunday) avg difficulty VS the avg difficulty of all the past same days (always Sunday, as of today)

[dscrdvrsc] <Moker> @TexWiller  nice work!!

[24-Jun-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> Feedbacks or requests are very welcome!

[24-Jun-18 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @TexWiller and you mentioned the difficulty goes hand in hand with the network hash rate, or something like that

[24-Jun-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VirtualSoundNW> The difficulty is a moving average that adjusts to get to a 1 block per minute rate.  If the hash rate increases the block rate goes up, then over several samples the higher rate will cause the difficulty to go up, slowing the rate back down towards 1/minute.  Decreases in network hash slow the rate, triggering a decrease in difficulty over multiple samples to speed it back up towards 1 per minute.

[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> Mining Verus is a lot like fishing...you can go days without catching anything, but man, when you get one... it is a RUSH!üòÄ

[dscrdvrsc] <Cam - [triforce]> truth!

[25-Jun-18 06:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
About staking. It starts after how much confirm ?

[25-Jun-18 06:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
And what s the minimum utxo size ?

[25-Jun-18 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> 150 confirms, no minimum

[25-Jun-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lubo> @TexWiller  nice metrics keep up good work man!

[25-Jun-18 09:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
Sorry for another question but is there a place to buy vrsc ?

[25-Jun-18 09:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
My coins just unlock mostly in 2 years so i d like to be able to stake before that gap

[25-Jun-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> why are there more mined blocks?

[25-Jun-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> compared to pos

[25-Jun-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> an imbalance in the balancer between PoS and PoW

[25-Jun-18 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> Anybody can suggest me the most precise way to calculate network hashrate for historical datas?

[25-Jun-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
iterate through every block and grab the difficulty?

[25-Jun-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> I already have all the blocks and transactions indexed (and all their fields). But which approach works best to calculate the network hashrate? The formula, I mean

[25-Jun-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bitcoinB> just me or is everyone getting 384 coins per block ?

[25-Jun-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bitcoinB> with random unlock times upto 2years LOL

[25-Jun-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> yes thats what the block reward is right now

[25-Jun-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <and1_89> Whats the different to kmd.

[25-Jun-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> i am happy to report that something moved, I found a block

[25-Jun-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> it says "immature"

[25-Jun-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> but it's all good, I am happy I finally got one

[25-Jun-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> i don't know where I can see how many days I have to wait before I can see it in my "transparent balance"m but that doesn't matter... I don't think I will touch this coin for two years...

[25-Jun-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> One small question for the team

[25-Jun-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> don't you think it's more appealing to call the coin just "verus" and give up on the "coin" part of the name? :/

[25-Jun-18 06:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Type komodo-cli listtransactions

[25-Jun-18 06:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
Then you ll have blockmaturity ( i don t remember exactly) that s the amount of blocks needed to wait until it s in your wallet

[25-Jun-18 06:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
If you mined via cli... if that s with agama a call of listtransactions should be possible too but I don t know where to input it

[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Anyone here old enough to remember PCs with turbo button on them?

[25-Jun-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> Yeah, and the Turbo button actually slowed them down.

[25-Jun-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> I guess it varied by company, but on ours, turbo was compatibility mode.
