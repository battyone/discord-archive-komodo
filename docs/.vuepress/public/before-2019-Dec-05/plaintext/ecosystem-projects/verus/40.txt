[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Same thing aswell, always add exemptions in your antivirus for the new miner you have downloaded, even de activate the antivirus before you download the miner first, then when its run ok add your exemptions and then re activate your antivirus

[29-Sep-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @cryptoprofit.zone Are you sure the cpu meet the requirements for mining the verushash?
Try to add "pause" after the standard command in the .bat file, then run. It should stop an show you an error instead of just closing the window.

[29-Sep-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptoprofit.zone> @Cragorn  yes its a i7 8700 CPU

[29-Sep-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptoprofit.zone> ./nheqminer -v -l eu-veruscoin.miningpools.cloud:2082 -u RDERJmfEGNkyeEo4ALoWPzpjczt4hzpKj9.worker -p x -t 12 pause

[29-Sep-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptoprofit.zone> lke so ?

[29-Sep-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptoprofit.zone> ther miner on its own runs but when i try to start with the batch file it crashes

[29-Sep-18 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Yes. Not sure if pause needs to be on next line, but should work. The window closes before you can read any errors? Try with less than 12 threads perhaps.

[29-Sep-18 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptoprofit.zone> yeah i tried with less no go still

Veruscoin mining pool is a dedicated pool for mining Veruscoin (VRSC) with low latency stratum server

[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> If he used ./ at beginning he should be on Linux. Command on Windows is without that.

[29-Sep-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> So it needs $(nproc)

[dscrdvrsc] <wrxys> @stretcher83 Thank you!  The Agama wallet was downloaded from the official homepage and I did check my antivirus software, there was nothing blocked.  This is just so weird...Is it because I generated a .PIN file, which is alternative to wallet.dat? Anyway, looks like I can use the wallet normally like receiving incoming coins and I also backed up the seed and WIF, so I guess I should be safe. Again, thank you!

[29-Sep-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Is it agama lite wallet you are using or agama native mode ?

[29-Sep-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @wrxys

[29-Sep-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I dont think agama native mode uses pins or seeds, not sure about the lite mode wallet iv not used it yet

[29-Sep-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wrxys> @stretcher83 alright, that explains everything! I'm using the lite wallet. So without wallet.dat? Only native mode has it?

[29-Sep-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I think so, iv not tried out the lite mode wallet yet,

[29-Sep-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Defo you get a .bat file using native mode

[29-Sep-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im not sure if the lite mode wallet can mine and stake , maybe some one else can step in and answer that question,

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thought it might be a good chance to bring up Verus. The amazing tech speaks for itself, it's up to us to get the word out there so when people are presented with such an undeniably promising project they can't help but look deeper. Verus is like a technological onion. There are so many layers it can be hard to find the best approach at presenting it as most folks are used to just one technological "hook" per coin where Verus is a cohesive project of many.

[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> yes, we have only one

[01-Oct-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> 120 confirmations is probably a bit extra for Verus, but exchanges want to prevent double spend attacks on all their coins, they are not incentivized to use the least confirmations possible
