[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott Got it now, did not take long

[25-Aug-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I show 3 confirms here now.

[25-Aug-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Exchanges seem to like to play games.  I do not know for sure, but requiring 120 confirmations for a deposit seems completely out of line.   Most I have seen before was 6.

[25-Aug-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott Having a hard time figuring out your sender address, was it RHEMuyCfSBUpwJ5XRrdd3msXUKw6Tp9EJg ?

[25-Aug-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott So, sender's addresses are hidden as part of the privacy coin thingy, I guess. We'll can't send the 1 coin back to you then, hope you won't regret this when it reaches BTC price levels (fingers crossed) üòÇ

[25-Aug-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Will be a funny story to tell people in the future about this guy that sent me $20k to test network transaction times üëå

[25-Aug-18 04:28 PM] bishop#9773
No... if it was sent from a taddr, you can see who sent it. If it was sent from a zaddr, you can't

[25-Aug-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Crupti I had a guy that I did some Ravencoin escrow for DM me and say "I am going to send you some RVN... give me your addy".   I sent him my address and the next day there was 10K more RVN in my wallet.  At the time that was worth about 400 USD.   Less than half of that now, but in three to four years?   Who knows....

[25-Aug-18 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Crupti that address looks right.

[dscrdvrsc] <arton> I know what you did @psittacus  - you were trying to launch Agama.exe from zip archive. You must extract it first and then launch Agama.exe.

[25-Aug-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott Sent you 1.0 coin back now. Thanks.

[25-Aug-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Any information about the upcoming smart contracts? Multi-signature support? Airdrops possible (probably not since it's a security coin)? Stake needed for dApps deploying smart contracts?

[25-Aug-18 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Also, I beg you to implement account names like they have on EOS - those are terrific!

[25-Aug-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> It's so great to send some EOS coins to 'joethetrader' rather than having to use those public keys.

[25-Aug-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> EOS have public keys too, but they are hidden behind the account names.

[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> I need some help from support please?

[25-Aug-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <psittacus> has verus masternode?

[25-Aug-18 10:15 PM] bishop#9773
no

[25-Aug-18 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @psittacus no masternodes.

[26-Aug-18 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Krypto Koning as a community coin, there is community support. there are also devs and others here in the community to help with issues. you can post your issues on #community-support or DM me if you'd like, and someone will try to help. i will when i'm around and not coding

[26-Aug-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Alright> where can I find a non-AES build for staking

[26-Aug-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Alright> preferably would like to build it from source

[26-Aug-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> all builds should be fine without AES now

[26-Aug-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I would not use dev as I'm working in it a little

[26-Aug-18 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Are there any rewards for staking my mined coins?

[26-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> What block will the reward be halving?

[26-Aug-18 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott Found an explaination in the whitepaper I think: "When a staker performs the test for eligibility and discovers a winning UTXO for a block, they can add that UTXO as a no-fee spend to themselves to the end of that block, validate the block in all other respects, and submit that block to the Verus network, along with the coinbase transaction, which pays new coins to the same address of the staking transaction at the end of the block."

[26-Aug-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> What‚Äôs going on here?

[26-Aug-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Z to T tx

[26-Aug-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Nevermind

[26-Aug-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Was error code -3

[26-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> It was listing an amount with decimal places way beyond 8

[26-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Something like that 383.999800000005

[26-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Discord kept deleting the number for some reason when I typed it

[26-Aug-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Reduced tx by .0001 and it went through

[26-Aug-18 02:42 PM] jspook16#3059
Yeah I just cut the number down and it goes through no problem

[26-Aug-18 02:42 PM] jspook16#3059
You're staking too?

[26-Aug-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Yea

[26-Aug-18 02:43 PM] jspook16#3059
Right on

[26-Aug-18 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Hollowman9000 If you have already made the .0001 adjustment for the Tx fee, just lop off everything from the 9th decimal and beyond and I bet it works just fine.

[26-Aug-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> I'm having trouble with deposits: Agama wallet says: "Succesfull transaction", but it doesn't show up in VRSC Explorer?! Plz help

[26-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> I got a reply on twitter about me being on my own fork or something, and to come here for help ‚ù§

[26-Aug-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> How do i fix it, and did i loose the coins i've sent already on the wrong fork? üò¶

[26-Aug-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> That‚Äôs not how forking works

[26-Aug-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> i believe you

[26-Aug-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> i have no clue

[26-Aug-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Worst that would happen is that you‚Äôll see the coins back in your account

[26-Aug-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> that wouldnt be so bad )

[26-Aug-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> When sending from exchanges, that may be a different story

[26-Aug-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> As their private accounting may not reflect the leading chain

[26-Aug-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> i see

[26-Aug-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> so how can i fix it?

[26-Aug-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Explain exactly what you did

[26-Aug-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Did you send from agama?

[26-Aug-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Or exchange

[26-Aug-18 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> from agama to exchange

[26-Aug-18 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> i selected transparent funds wallet, amount and the recieving adress

[26-Aug-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> i get succes as a return with TXiD and everything, but those dont seem to be legit when i check them in veruscoin explorer

[26-Aug-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> should i try to reset the wallet completely? or will that make me loose coins?

[26-Aug-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> nvm if i keep the wallet.dat files i should be fine

[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> point 1 says: "backup your wallet.dat file or move it out of your Komodo directory. Repeat this for all other Komodo coins, including Komodo "
Where is the komodo wallet.dat? I've found the VRSC wallet.dat already, but where's the komodo one?

[27-Aug-18 12:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CrisF> Hi, I have re-installed VRSC (cli ubuntu).  I have copied my wallet.dat into .komodo/VRSC and am now syncing.  Do I need to do anything else, like `importwallet` or `importprivkey`?

[27-Aug-18 12:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Are there any addresses not showing?

[27-Aug-18 12:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Only reason I could think of using importprivkey

[27-Aug-18 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CrisF> @Hollowman9000 , It's still re-syncing.  Is pasting in the wallet.dat usually enough?
