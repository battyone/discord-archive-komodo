[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> And getting exposed to exchanges when nothing but a live blockchain is up - is a bad move I believe. We have noting on top of the ledger at the moment, this is a phase where ledger is getting transaction volume and just getting fully operational. We don't need speculators and investors at this point of developement.

[14-Aug-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> anyone heard of gate.io

[14-Aug-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> free

[14-Aug-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <riesbree> Never heard of this exchange. Is it not possible to use an exchange that is allready known by blockfolio?

[14-Aug-18 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> We have a less known exchange available, if we want exchanges we should aim at big ones and only after anything would be built on top of the ledger, at the moment we have nothing but idea and ledger! Why even bother with listings, we need developments not exchanges.

[14-Aug-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ted> we need both developments and exchanges.

[14-Aug-18 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Explain to me why would we need more exchanges, because I don't get it. We have BarterDEX and DigitalPrice

[14-Aug-18 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ted> more exchanges can take more people to know this project.

[14-Aug-18 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ted> more people join this project.

[14-Aug-18 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> There are better ways for marketing than listings and as long as there is no pool, no one-click miner and no apps using the ledger there is little to promote with exchanges alone, especially if those exchanges would be little known ones.

[14-Aug-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ted> yes,but we can do these at the same time

[14-Aug-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> A pool is getting tested again , looks promising, #pools

[14-Aug-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> I agree. We can't just say we are Verus, a Komodo fork, accept us on the big exchanges

[14-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Can we write articles on Medium?

[14-Aug-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <themobi> There‚Äôs one Medium article yesterday

[14-Aug-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> @themobi Nice.. I need to read it

[14-Aug-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Maybe a faucet or something where people are interacting with the project & installing the app for a very small amount crypto

[14-Aug-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> app--meant wallet

[14-Aug-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> You might remember--3 coins forked in January, I think.. Bitcoin Private, Bitcoin Hush & I think one more.. But Bitcoin Hush, I thought would be very popular.. I'm not sure it's even on CMC.. I'm not saying anything bad about the project, I liked it. BUT--it is important to get on a few exchanges.  CryptoBridge, HyperDEX & try for Cryptopia

[14-Aug-18 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <riesbree> Coinexchange.io  maybe?

[14-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> @riesbree I just don't think we realize what it costs, you and I, because I bet it's outrageous

[14-Aug-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Maybe they could keep the money, hire a Dev & get a DEX together

[14-Aug-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Look at NEO & Aphelion, for example

[14-Aug-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <riesbree> I really have no idea what the costs are.

[14-Aug-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Hundreds of thousands im sure

[14-Aug-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> in coins or Fiat or both

[14-Aug-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> I think it's absolutely crazy

[14-Aug-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Centralized exchanges have absorbed a good portion of money that should've stayed in crypto

[14-Aug-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <riesbree> I do think it helps to grow i you have an exchange which is better know then the one there is now. But the questions is it worth the costs.

[14-Aug-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> I think Dev teams & their contributions deserve something

[14-Aug-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Well it's necessary for exposure and growth.. But we are moving into decentralized exchange era

[14-Aug-18 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Personally, I believe that money could help actually pay professionals, Dev teams, something--maybe nothing crazy... But we can't copy the corporate structure that got us here .. one man on top, with most.. and everyone else, none

[14-Aug-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> I've read about these guys earning near nothing.  And the project leader taking millions of coins

[14-Aug-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @Crypto80 I bet DEX will be adopted when you can use them as a web app connect to a smartphone (like whatsapp). My hipotesis is that people are not used to download trading software on their PC and that they want to have the flexibility that web applications give them, but are really ok with downloading apps on their phones or needing them for access their trading web plataforms (2FA). As it seems, Q1/Q2 2019 seems to be the start of this trend, but maybe paying for listing has a short term benefit. Anyway, I belive the bullet points to discuss on the listing matter are:
1. When DEX model will gain traction?
2. How long the foundation can wait before starting selling their VRSC funds? 
3. How much money will be needed each month?
4. What is the expected impact in volume and price after the listing on the candidates exchanges?
5. How much will the listing cost on each exchange?
6. Is there any alternative for increasing the value and volume? 
7. Is there any alternative for listing instead of paying?

[14-Aug-18 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Looking at the digitalprice exchange - looking pretty bad.

[14-Aug-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Less than 2000 VRSC between us and 130 sats

[14-Aug-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> I will buy @ 150 sats so dont worry, this is a good price

[15-Aug-18 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> a few exchanges anyone has hardly ever heard of... Truly spoken like someone that has no idea of the costs involved, for a project, even a good one--to get off its feet and going

[15-Aug-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> About the exchange  - I would think targeting one major exchange is the way to go, but I too do not know the costs. If we end up spread out over lots of little ones it will hinder price discovery as I think the Verus market would be too spread out and illiquid, and it would be an inefficient use of time/resources to get them set up.

Unless people really want to buy Verus, it's unlikely they will go and sign up to yet another (relatively unproven/untested/unknown) exchange when most traders already have to manage accounts for multiple exchanges already. People in general favour the easy route most of the time, especially nowadays with everything already done/predicted/saved for you online. I think being on digiprice is fine for now as we are so small and anyone who wants in will sign up. The same goes for many others IMO - you might get some of the existing userbase to take a look on different exchanges but to really get market participation you need to be where the market is, not expect it to come to you. Generally the market is still on bigger centralised exchanges. I wish it wasn't but...

I know nothing about how to get listed on an exchange but can't we aim for Binanance or similar? They list loads of coins. Binance CEO recently tipped Komodo as one to watch, I read in Komodo's 5 bullet Friday recently üòâ

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We are waiting for the Howey letter from the lawyers for the Binance app. It shouldn't take much longer, but I would have said that weeks ago. We definitely intend apply to Binance and would like to be voted on if the community could manage that. Based on the community feedback, we declined the bitexbay listing for now.

[15-Aug-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> imho it's better to be patient for higher quality exchanges than spend a lot of funds to get on smaller exchanges

[16-Aug-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KMD55> How about IDEX, Tidex or Cryptobridge, or some other good looking exchange...cryptopia

[16-Aug-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KMD55> I think Verus, by not being listed on big exchanges yet, maintains some key advantages

[16-Aug-18 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> isn't BarterDEX listed as an exchange on CMC?

[16-Aug-18 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Crypto80 I understand it is, but without an active amount of volume on Barterdex, it is not likely to help us get an accurate CMC listing

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Hey Mike...

[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> the richlist amount matches my wallet amount, but https://explorer.veruscoin.io doesn't .

[16-Aug-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> The richtlist on dexstats is directly exported with getsnapshot from the leveldb. Iquidus Explorer is in general not very accurate the data is imported into a DB as I understand. the total supply is normaly off a by few coins. I do expect it will also stop working at around 700k blocks

[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Guys with multiple rigs / wallets...

Do you keep anything mined in separately wallets or combine them in to one?

If so, how?

Thanks

[16-Aug-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @ChrisC30a I spread everything across multiple transparent addresses to get better staking results

[16-Aug-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> @ok88 I heard that this does not matter.

[16-Aug-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @bigtom How so? If an address strikes a stake block it's not staking again for X blocks, spreading into smaller UTXO will lower the downtime of coins in the staking process

[16-Aug-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> That is what I thought, but according to @miketout in #staking , this is not the case. Maybe there was some miscommunication there?

[16-Aug-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ok88 this is true, but once you get down to an amount that takes longer than a few thousand blocks to stake, the difference is minimal and offset by the time it can take to run through more transactions if you split them further. Right now, I am keeping my UTXOs 1000 or under, because it's convenient and I consider them small enough. I was originally recommending no larger than 500.

[16-Aug-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Basically, we should keep em low (under 1000) and dispersed to stake effectively, having all in one wallet seems not right then. The optimum UTXO will increase with the growing supply and lower staking profits, but still having a single wallet is not the best way to stake.

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @brixporter The Z Cash privacy protocol is a bit different than most.

[16-Aug-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Then, after just one confirmation - you can send them from the Z Address -

[16-Aug-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ok88 you can keep them all in one address even. How they are split makes no difference in probability of the total, aside from not being in UTXOs that are too large.

[16-Aug-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jimboscott actually, that is the Zcash protocol, which creates opt-out privacy. KMD has opt-in privacy and has removed the requirement. VRSC has the same requirement as Zcash.

[16-Aug-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @miketout Thanks for the clarification....  I should have realized that it is a Z address for a reason and not a K address...

[16-Aug-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> If you want to STAKE VRSC, then after you send them to the Z Address you send them BACK to a regular transparent address.  After 150 confirmations they will then start taking.
