[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> so many people following  "BSV vision" = crypto is about miners - is the same as computers are about developers

[04-Dec-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> after thinking a bit actualyl I find mining is always "selfish"  (exceptions are neive people who believe otherwise). Miner mines because there exist profit, and as long as it exist profit and this profit is public knowledge it's natural assumptions there will be many miners.

[04-Dec-18 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Searching the fpga discord for algo1 brings up some interesting reads. Example: 

pbiLast Saturday at 2:16 PM
warning: algo1 community has noticed a big drop in net hash
coinciding with this outage
jadefalkeLast Saturday at 2:23 PM
where is the nethash now?
it was supposed to be 18 TH right?
Lord PowerLast Saturday at 2:25 PM
funny thing is not much they can do about it

[04-Dec-18 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <halpi> Does everyone have problems with vrsc transactions?

[04-Dec-18 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> I'm over the naive thinking miners are  about "supporting community". They are for profit, many of them for short term profit.

[04-Dec-18 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> Dont get me wrong - nothing bad in profit, just let's not make miners the center of it.

[04-Dec-18 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I think the fpga freakout is much ado about nothing maybe

"$11.55 revenue for Algo1 minus some for electricity makes it $10.49 at the moment."

3 blocks a day.

[04-Dec-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I wonder if their outage is why I had such some killer staking days recently

[04-Dec-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I think a big part of the issue is that there are several different arguments going on not just a black and white thing. I find it an interesting ride being a part of this community even still and I have my opinions just like everyone else but I also like to keep an open mind and where some people are anti fpga and some people are pro fpga I am not completely sure where I stand just yet but I will say my concern with the fpga thing is how it might affect not only coin distribution but price if people are able to mine them very cheaply then they are competing against each other to sell them very cheaply keeping the price down which isn't necessarily bad for buyers. It is just a lot of variables and the stakes are somewhat high for some

[04-Dec-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Or if their existence is why I have been

[04-Dec-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I think that is where a lot of this friction is coming from

[04-Dec-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> And I will say personally reading the quote from the fpga Discord sort of rubs me the wrong way how about how they have been going about what they are doing

[04-Dec-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Understandable. On the other hand it is a privacy coin, right? So can we really begrudge people for being private about it?

[04-Dec-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> My gut reaction was the same on reading that, and reading the announcement today. "Fuck them!"

[04-Dec-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I feel like that's a little like saying he's a magician he makes things disappear he won't mind that I took his wallet

[04-Dec-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But I get your point and it doesn't bother me so much as what the repercussions might be

[04-Dec-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Now a question becomes- is it worth it to sell off your vrsc in order to buy an fpga considering if things stay the same it would be possible to make them back within the first 6 months?

[04-Dec-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The economics shift a little

[04-Dec-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I have days when I stake that much and I did not spend $2500

[04-Dec-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I mean yes... sell all your VRSC please

[04-Dec-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Everyone buy fpgas and stop staking

[04-Dec-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I didn't say I was going to. I said it becomes a question as a matter of economics

[04-Dec-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> They have another secret coin too

[04-Dec-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> secret algo rather

[04-Dec-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I wonder what that could be

[04-Dec-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> ......come on lol

[04-Dec-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I imagine it wouldn't be that hard to find out the users would have to know

[04-Dec-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> every fpga has "secret" algos

[04-Dec-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Honey how are people selected for the secret algo?

[04-Dec-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Not sure why it's so lol. Just today it was confirmed that they have been mining verus and only referring to it as "algo1"

[04-Dec-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> They also have algo2

[04-Dec-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> its so lol because this has being going on for the last year

[04-Dec-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> this isnt new

[04-Dec-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Along with a handful of named algos

[04-Dec-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> hashaltcoin was the only company to not make their algos secret initially

[04-Dec-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> people arent "selected" you have the gear you get the algo

[04-Dec-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> theres only one dev who limits the amount of fpgas he will allow on certain bitstreams and that to prevent destroying the small coins

[04-Dec-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Honey do you FPGA mine?

[04-Dec-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> I do it all

[04-Dec-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> what is the ROI of the Black F1

[04-Dec-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> ROI isnt a thing

[04-Dec-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> today is one figure a month ago it was another

[04-Dec-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> "allow"... Can you be pulled off an algo?

[04-Dec-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> no once you have it you have it

[04-Dec-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Honey ok how long did it take for you to get your 2.5k back?

[04-Dec-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Yes, please stop using ROI so incorrectly. Use capital recovery if you want, but please stop using ROI. Sorry, pet peeve

[04-Dec-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> I have yet to hit my break even point

[04-Dec-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> estimation in current market is 250-350 days

[04-Dec-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Honey how often does a new FPGA come out that is way more efficient than the previous one?

[04-Dec-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Where is a good place to learn about these newfangled things

[04-Dec-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> xilinx and intel release new gear all the time

[04-Dec-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> they come at 10k a pop tho

[04-Dec-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> and arnt made for crypto

[04-Dec-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> group buys done by other parties will continue to pop up

[04-Dec-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> the future focus isnt crazy expensive fancy fpgas

[04-Dec-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> its 500$ once that have a bep of 250-350days in todays market

[04-Dec-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> good place to start learning if you want to dip your toes in

[04-Dec-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Honey but when will the 2nd gen black miner come out and if it does, will they still support the old blackminer f1 first gen

[04-Dec-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @halpi if you are having trouble with tx ask in the support channel, you’re question will get lost here today!

[04-Dec-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> they have stated they will continue to support the f1 when the f2 comes out, no release date yet. Its rumored to handle larger memory algos tho.

[04-Dec-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> they are selling the f1s to find the f2s and beyond

[04-Dec-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Was there supposed to be a link?

[04-Dec-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> i did post it, but pmed you as well

[04-Dec-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I think i could afford one in Jan or Feb. But wondering if it will be worth it by then or if its better waiting for the next one. What do you think?

[04-Dec-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> Tough to say what jan feb will be like market wise

[04-Dec-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> there are rumoured to be more fpgas coming but again bear market who knows

[04-Dec-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Honey but FPGAs still perform well in bear market right?

[04-Dec-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TJay> @Gloryman because just a few hundreds units was sold.

[04-Dec-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TJay> I guess that within month or so their payback period would be more than 2 years

[04-Dec-18 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TJay> same story like with antminer d3, a3, b3, baikal giant, etc etc

[04-Dec-18 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @TJay yeah, great point

[04-Dec-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> lol @TJay

[04-Dec-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> 5000 bcus were sold

[04-Dec-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> well 4000 with a remianing 1000 left

[04-Dec-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> countless others coming

[04-Dec-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> no where near the same as an antminer

[04-Dec-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> 2 years payback is not any revolution

[04-Dec-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> what is the capital recapture for CPU or GPU?

[04-Dec-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> 1 bitstream atm for bcu on shell @TJay

[04-Dec-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> dont get me wrong id love for you to cause fud

[04-Dec-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> more $$ for me

[04-Dec-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TJay> @Honey dude,i know pretty well this situation. will compare our predictions after 1-2 months.
FUD? this is arguments, not a fud

[04-Dec-18 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> im not disagreeing with you

[04-Dec-18 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TJay> and btw, bcus was advertised with 30 bucks a day profit. now it's about 4 bucks

[04-Dec-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> i know youre everywhere just like me

[04-Dec-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> in terms of risk 100% agree as risky as asic, slightly less due to changing algos but still

[04-Dec-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TJay> lyra2z was destroyed just within month. and this was a very huge algo in terms of $/day pow emission

[04-Dec-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> but its not going to become a paper weight as fast

[04-Dec-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> for sure it was

[04-Dec-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> lyra2z got nuked

[04-Dec-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and that is the danger of "ASIC resistance", it just delays the arrival of ASIC (FPGA) and it seems a bit more controlled if mainstream ASIC are available vs. fpga

[04-Dec-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TJay> hardware manufacturers earn money, 90% of miners lose money. this is how mining works ))

[04-Dec-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @jl777c at current-ish conditions, best case for capital recapture is about 1-1.5yrs for most efficient CPU vrsc mining. I think that is now out the window that FPGAs are on the network. FPGA cost recapture time isn't great, but it seems they will ruin it for all the CPU/GPUs on the network

[04-Dec-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> Please add to blockfolio

[04-Dec-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> then what we need are even more efficient ASIC

[04-Dec-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> FPGA (and thus ASIC) resistance is possible. Just look at monero. We are doing the same on suqa.

[04-Dec-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @Pallas the core protection SUQA has, is that it uses more algos than can currently fit into 1 fpga memory, am I understanding that?

[04-Dec-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> what is the real protection, that somebody who wants to mine SUQA with fpga's, will be stopped?

[04-Dec-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> Yes, and changing the algorithm periodically

[04-Dec-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> I see people combining CPUs/GPUs + FPGAs to mine some coins
