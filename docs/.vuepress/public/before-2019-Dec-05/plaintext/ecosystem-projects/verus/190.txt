[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That is an above and beyond statement from Komodo and really nice to see the appreciation for contributions from both sides that will ultimately be beneficial in the long run for everyone. üçª 
For anyone who's been paying attention and is already familiar with the always consistant, above and beyond hard word and dedication from our very own developers and contributing community members, the recent efforts may come as no surprise and seem par for the course at this point, but this instance was more than just churning out consistent work while pushing forward with a massive PBaaS release, it was an effort made that reached far beyond our own community and for that, accurately qualifies as going above and beyond. It was really nice to read some very kind words directed back to the ones who helped make that happen and see the bigger picture. üåé 
So much hostility in this space at times when we are all after the same things. It's refreshing to be a part of a healthy and supportive environment for once. ü§ò

[dscrdvrsc] <euphoric85> I‚Äôm a total noob with crypto in general, and Verus.. somehow I stumbled upon this awesome community, that far surpasses the handful of others I‚Äôve dabbled in.

[05-Jul-19 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Roki> @Godballz 
I like your take on the community as a whole.
I have always found it difficult to expend energy on the crypto community, as a whole. I have a lot of respect for Bitcoin. But I respect the idea of privacy, just as much, and so I discovered ZEC, then Komodo and then Verus. For me, Komodo is special bc of privacy, creativity and work ethic. A willingness to try to do something different, and solve a problem. It was atomic swaps that really got me interested in KMD.
And, they always seemed to be working on something. Plus, they were accessible, or seeing what was being worked on was.

And now here with Verus, we have those same principles I mentioned I like about Komodo, but we are doing it in our own way--with PBaaS. That's what creates a strong ecosystem--projects that are willing to innovate & stand on what they have built.

[05-Jul-19 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Roki> I never understood why some people dislike Komodo.
I stopped trying to figure that out. Because this ecosystem does contribute to everyone, whether it's dPOW or Atomic Swaps, or Verus w/Nothing @ Stake & soon to be w/PBaaS...

[05-Jul-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thanks @Roki. Yeah me either. After my initial getting into crypto and acquiring the obligatory Bitcoin, after researching lots of projects, KMD was the first "alt" project I ever invested in and I still hold those very coins to this day. Seemed like a no brainer even then and they only continue to drive that point home daily. Never did see why anyone would choose eth over KMD and tbh a part of me sorta thinks there may still be some deep rooted interests who for some reason or another think it wise to hinder any other crypto related project and wrongfully view them as competition when we should all be lifting each other up like a great tide. There is plenty of room. People may be forgetting that what we aim to replace is not just simply any one market or industry, we may very well be on the cusp of a complete technological upheaval for so many things we could never even see coming and with a much farther reaching scope than the shortsighted views of those who seek to hinder progress.

[05-Jul-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz Well you know, BTC & ETH had it out, on many occasions, and it would get nasty.. So Ethereum, it's not choosing Ethereum over Komodo. They are two different projects with different aims. 
There may be a few overlapping similarities in terms of classification, but different nonetheless. 
I think what you're describing is ego and tribalism. 
Some projects are not willing to admit, for example a weakness, and allow another project to help them.

[05-Jul-19 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> But I think you make a good point..
The business world is very savvy, in how they adopt new technology, bc no two businesses are the same.

[05-Jul-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'm sure it's extremely challenging to run a multi million dollar business, year in year out, and keep that up and do it well.

[05-Jul-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'm hoping that PBaaS translates into the business world, that they see value in it.

[05-Jul-19 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It's my opninion that PBaaS will be an attractive option for companies, that want to use blockchain technology. A PBaaS chains comes with a complete infrastructure, autonotarization is basically the only cost for the chain. Once reserve liquidity is implemented too (on which Mike is working to bring to testnet), there's no need to acquire listing on an exchange since Verus is listed on various exchanges. Combine that with the cross chain atomic swap capability Komodo is working on and you don't need to bring your chain to any exchange. As I understood work is being done to automatically (or at least with little effort) add any PBaaS chain to the Verus Mobile Wallet, which makes it a very attractive option for companies.
Of coarse for dApps on PBaaS chains you will still need to have developers to create and connect the dApp to the chain, but that would have been necessary for any chain.

[05-Jul-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> So would Verus have to guarantee to companies, or large users, that PBaaS will be maintained for X amount of years?

[05-Jul-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'd like to learn how to create a Dapp

[dscrdvrsc] <CrisF> Hi @Oink üëã
You've regularly been sending me and others tips for months now.
By way of thanks I'd like to share a short story showing the results of your generosity.
I'm a new KMD Notary op and am just finishing the setup of my node.
One of the things I need for that is some VRSC.  Unfortunately mine is inaccessible at the moment.  I was a bit stuck because I didn't want to ask the other ops for some.  Then I remembered your tips.
Over the last few months the tips that you have been sending have added up to enough to fund Verus notarizations for quite some time :)
I'd like to let you know that your efforts in making this such a cool place are very appreciated.
Thank you!
CrisF

[05-Jul-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jul-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> @Cruz if a corporation chooses to use PBaaS, I imagine it would be similar to a corpration choosing to use Ubuntu, with the "LTS" being handled by an internal team of developers and auditors.

[06-Jul-19 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @gamer278  I like that you think like a professional investor and wan¬¥t to know the future potential of VerusCoin in terms of the amount of Verus that could amount in "life-changing money" should everything work out? No one would know, as it is as complex to launch a blockchain as any dropping any new product into a saturated market place.  In general and current market phase, these factors must be executed correctly and in a timely manner; 

a) correct market orientation(reach early adopters), 
b) competent development team,
c) speedy development(MVP),  
d) great documentation, 
e) clear roadmap (strong team lead direction). 

This is all basic marketing stuff that I¬¥ve mentioned, and even if you get all of these correct the team still need a strong personal network and not least - LUCK. üòÜ

[07-Jul-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @gamer278 But back to your original question and say that all the above was achieved, this is not investment advice but for entertainment. Let¬¥s just use a simple market cap valuation: 

- If Verus would become one of the top 50 coins per market cap, then it would have to 20x it¬¥s current value. If your definition of "life changing money" is $1 million USD, then you would have to invest $50,000 USD in VerusCoin today. 
- If Verus would become one of the top 25 coins per market cap, then it would have to 70x it¬¥s current value and you would have to invest $14,300 USD today. 
- If Verus would become one of the top 10 coins per market cap, then it would have to 240x it¬¥s current value and you would have to invest $4,200 USD today. 
- If Verus would become one of the top 3 coins per market cap, then it would have to 1880x it¬¥s current value and you would have to invest $532 USD today.

These are just guesses based on existing top coin market caps today, and these market caps will also probably change in the years ahead.

[07-Jul-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mrbizzy> and it could be either of these. but starting with top10 would be a tough battle.

[07-Jul-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I kinda assess the same way of potential of a project based on it's current supply, total supply, current bitcoin satoshi value, potential tech it offers now and what is in it's development which will be offered in future, the impact of that technology offering in ecosystem, and the effect of that tech adoption's on it's own token usage which may increase it's value as it grows. The only basic thing to understand is the technology part. In my opinion, a person who understands technology, and who also understand these basics of the economic factors which impacts the price of some unit/shares of some project/company can really take benefit by buying up some good chunk of that project/company shares.

@DigitalPunk If testing goes well it‚Äôs getting submitted to TestFlight today, and should be available tomorrow for iOS (estimating based on how long it takes apple to approve previous versions, technically could take a little longer)
