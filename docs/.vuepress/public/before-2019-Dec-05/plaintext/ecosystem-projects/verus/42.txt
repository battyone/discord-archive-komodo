[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> at the moment I think it's balanced out quite a lot so buying may well be the same as mining

[07-Oct-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> we are talking about it, but changing price and difficulty in measuring the hash to coins makes it hard to conclude

[07-Oct-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> I see, I guess opportunity cost is one factor

[07-Oct-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> just buy and stake, easier decision and less management 😉

[07-Oct-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> use auto shield script from englal

[07-Oct-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> the hard part is deciding what harware to buy, it the price is highish and stable then 1080 ti is good. If the price is dropping or we get less coins then its better to buy amd.

[07-Oct-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> and mine a different coin

[07-Oct-18 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> yeah at this stage I would just wonder what would you get if you just buy at market and stake with the same value you would have put into hardware/electricity, and then some value on the time and mental power you would have spent on the mining setup/maintenance. That's just me though

[07-Oct-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> could go 5050 - match your staking percentage with a an equivalent mining setup, hope for stable returns/hashrate

[07-Oct-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> It's good to have GPUs because you can always switch coins where it's profitable.

[07-Oct-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Staking on coins is risky... because coins can go down.

[07-Oct-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Yeah i agree

[07-Oct-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> I see coins dipped 1000 percent sometime.

[07-Oct-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> And if a coin goes up you can always mine the coin and make a big profit.

[07-Oct-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> But obviously it's not like hitting the lottery

[07-Oct-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Or just sell GPUs when you don't need them anymore.

[07-Oct-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> I bought AMD Vega 64 when it was first came out.

[07-Oct-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> It was sold for $375 on Egghead.

[07-Oct-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> I bought two.

[07-Oct-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Now, I see people still selling it for $500 on Craigslist.

[07-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Everyone is dumping their GPUs here, getting cheaper by the day.

[07-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> people are selling 970 GTXs for $100

[07-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Old and obsolete GPUs maybe.

[07-Oct-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Vega and 1080 TI still expensive.

[07-Oct-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> If I sell my Vega now I still make $100 in profit.

[07-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I have two GTX 970s I bought for $120 and $100 USD, they mine 350 MH/s each at only 290 watts, dirt cheap and getting cheaper by the day because everyone is getting out of the GPU mining over here 😉

[07-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> You're talking about 2-3 years old GPUs hahah.

[07-Oct-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Sophal Why are you laughing at me?

[07-Oct-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> It is all about ROI, not power

[07-Oct-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Vega 64 and 1080 TI  about 1+ years old.

[07-Oct-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> I learned it's good to sell your GPUs after a year or so.

[07-Oct-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Best ROI at the moment is the GTX 970, don't understand why that is so funny.

[07-Oct-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Then invest on newest ones.

[07-Oct-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> I used to do that... I bought 480s when people buying 580s.

[07-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Then I bought 580s and and sold 480s... but when Vega 64 came out selling my old 480s was hard.

[07-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Now, I set one year for old GPUs.

[07-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Get rid of it as fast as new ones come out.

[07-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Sophal The newest are not as profitable, you can buy 3x GTX 970 for $300 now, which will mine at the same MH/s as a single GTX 1080 TI which costs $650 used, that's 2x the price for the same performance...

[07-Oct-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Like I said sold your old ones for the same price or little higher than you bought it is not too bad.

[07-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Sophal What are you talking about "the same price or a little higher" - you pay less than half for the same performance...

[07-Oct-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> I bought Vega 64 for $375, it's sold online for $500 right now.

[07-Oct-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> It had good run for Ethereum and I made profit from it... still can sell higher than I bought them.

[07-Oct-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Right now people with 1080 TI can still sell theirs for great prices... and get XTI cards.

[07-Oct-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz99> @Crupti I had a 970 build, maybe 9 months ago... While everyone was in a panic to ROI, I already had, because I spent $80-$100, for 23-25/mh

[07-Oct-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Cruz99 Yeah. Problem with newer GPU cards is that you get the high performance but the ROI is worse than the low end cards.

[07-Oct-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> For example, the 1050 is selling used for the same price as the 970 at 100 MH/s less when mining Verus. 1060 is 2x the price of the 970 but only has 1.5x the mining performance.

[07-Oct-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> So currently, the 970 has the best ROI for Verus mining and the prices keep dropping - that's at least how I see it.

[07-Oct-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Crupti You are absolutely right if performance per dollar spent would be the single KPI for the mining facility. With business as a whole mindset, reselling value, warranty and performance per wat are important as well and I believe Pascal is way to go and Touring if only prices will drop or next releases will become available.

[07-Oct-18 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <derpelina> Anyone have any idea where a R9 Fury X would clock in mining Verus? I have... a lot of them 😃

Nothing@Stake is a big issue in #blockchain space, and many projects out there are trying to solve this problem. @VerusCoin came with a solution to it using @KomodoPlatform's #CryptoConditions tech. https://t.co/AUW2sfG2SJ

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i believe so. that is the one from the website, correct?

[08-Oct-18 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you can also feel free to donate to the address that was published for the Cryptopia listing. that is convenient, and we have already covered the fee, with the difference made up by the foundation. That address is: RCjW2B3w5okz3mb2uDfJGx8E13VHgg4uTx

Hey guys, I just want to let you know I have had a KMD tipbot made for KMD discord.  
If you have your own discord, it will work there for KMD and you are free to use it.   

DM me for the link and I will get you setup with the creator.

When will Verus be added to Agama?

[12-Oct-18 10:47 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
It’s on the newest update @cryptopeeps ... version 0.2.42c-beta

[12-Oct-18 10:49 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
Is there an OTC for Verus?

I added VRSC to my hyperdex but I think there is a problem with electrum servers because it doesnt load, anyone else experiencing the same?

[14-Oct-18 07:17 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
yes, we have had to create our electrum server cause public one is not working for us

[14-Oct-18 07:18 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275

@Cryptoon at what price are you buying

[17-Oct-18 03:38 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I like Verus project a lot. We are considering VerusHash algorithm for Marmara Chain. We want Marmara Coin to be mineable by normal CPUs. I personally do not want people to invest on expensive mining rigs to mine Marmara. Even It would be great if cheque writers could mine the coin. Then we can use immature balances against non-redemptions. Do we have detailed performance comparison when using pure CPUs and using same CPUs with mining rigs? Thanks!

[17-Oct-18 05:09 AM] jspook16#3059
Anyone test threadripper CPUs? 16 vs 32 core?

[17-Oct-18 06:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@jspook16 at what price are you selling?
