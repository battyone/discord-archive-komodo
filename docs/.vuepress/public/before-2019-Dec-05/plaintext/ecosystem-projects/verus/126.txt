[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> or was it somewhere else

[09-Mar-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> nope, `libs/stats.js` or something 😄

[09-Mar-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> yeah probs that

[09-Mar-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I saw it and wanted to fiddle but thought  i best not xD

[09-Mar-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Will do more harm than good as per usual

[09-Mar-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> or just go for a rough estimate, nethash/your hash, avg. blocktime is 60s, so you can find out how much blocks per hour on avg you should hit

[09-Mar-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the result will be as good as the luck time snomp gives 😄

[09-Mar-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 😛

[09-Mar-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> ```                var _blocktime = 55;
                var _networkHashRate = parseFloat(coinStats.poolStats.networkSols) * 1.2;
                var _myHashRate = (coinStats.hashrate / 1000000) * 2;
                coinStats.luckDays =  ((_networkHashRate / _myHashRate * _blocktime) / (24 * 60 * 60)).toFixed(3);
                coinStats.luckHours = ((_networkHashRate / _myHashRate * _blocktime) / (60 * 60)).toFixed(3);
                coinStats.minerCount = Object.keys(coinStats.miners).length;
                coinStats.workerCount = Object.keys(coinStats.workers).length;
                portalStats.global.workers += coinStats.workerCount;
```

[09-Mar-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> how about diff?

[09-Mar-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> diff is auto managed by the pool

[09-Mar-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> and will constantly fluctuate

[09-Mar-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> no need to worry about that

[09-Mar-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Ginasis Mining Pools  how about Immature ?  whats that.. thanks!

[09-Mar-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> blocks that are freshly mined or staked will have to mature for 100 blocks before you can do anything with them

[09-Mar-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> so if i am  Immature: 0.03872614 .  it means i need to wait till it is 100 before i can use my coin?

[09-Mar-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> not necessarily

[09-Mar-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> we don't know of how many blocks this immature balance is

[09-Mar-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but i think it's probably from one block

[09-Mar-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It means you have 0,038bla VRSC in immature stakes.

[09-Mar-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> As soon as those stakes are mature, they’ll show up as balance

[09-Mar-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Once the balance >= 1, it’ll be paid to your R-address

[09-Mar-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thats a pool specific detail ^

[09-Mar-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> for ginasis it's 1 indeed

[09-Mar-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @SmeLLyArMpiTs
This mining guide will go over pretty much everything but you'll have to scroll half way down to the pool mining section- <https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-to-start-cpu-mining-verus-coin-vrsc-from-your-laptop-in-under-5-minutes-f69c9aae340e>
.
 And here is a YouTube video that explains how to set up a .bat file inside a miner's folder (obviously you'll have to substitute some stuff with the Verus guide on GinasisMining etc.) But sometimes it helps me to have a visual-
<https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WIh0tHxMcOU>
.
Here is a site that gives a zcash mining guide but it goes over basics with things such as difficulty and other things but the first link, John's guide will be the most useful for what you're doing- <https://99bitcoins.com/zcash-mining-guide-beginners-pc/>
I'll look for a better one in the mean time but it wouldn't hurt to go over some basics if you are just jumping into things. Lord knows I had to just like, I'm sure, so many of us.

[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Block: 408160 Sun Mar 10 2019 02:31:15 GMT+1030 (ACDT) 11 of 100
Mined By: RSP2BMFTVFVzJwUph6T2fVMK7xvCb4sCKo.m13cn2levcpu .    so this means this block is  89 short!

[09-Mar-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yes, but thats also only half of the answer

[09-Mar-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> as there is dpow happening, and the pool can make it look like the block isn't mature

[09-Mar-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> when it actually is 😄

[09-Mar-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> so... the short answer: just assume 130, especially when waiting for the red numbers on any pool

[09-Mar-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> can i understand why is there a need to wait?  as in isnt mined coins already real coins?

[09-Mar-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Godballz   thanks

[09-Mar-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> there is so much to learn for crypto !  makes me feel like a caveman haha

[09-Mar-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i never asked myself why blocks need maturation time, i just realized.

[09-Mar-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but it's very probably security/safety related

[09-Mar-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> In case of forking, it needs to mature for 100 blocks, to make sure you’re still on the proper chain

[09-Mar-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> anything after the first notarization after whatever event is very safe.

[09-Mar-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> somebody will surely correct me on this

[09-Mar-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i am literally goggling the terms u all use.. forks ... etc .  haha

[09-Mar-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> so other coins like vertcoin has maturing time too right

[09-Mar-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> probably every coin

[09-Mar-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @SmeLLyArMpiTs I would strongly advise you to read the Verus vision and white paper on the veruscoin.io website. Google the unknown terms in there and in a day you’re up to speed.

[09-Mar-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> to check my understanding .. if i attempt to solo mine by using the wallet..  and i quit 1 hour into it ..  whatever progress i have is lost right>

[09-Mar-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Oink ok..

[09-Mar-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i tried reading earlier .. was confused

[09-Mar-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> hahah

[09-Mar-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> will continue

[09-Mar-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> thanks so much to all here for the kind answers 😃

[09-Mar-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Solo min8ng is like: you stake a block or you don’t. There’s no buildup in funds. All or nothing

[09-Mar-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i think i am starting to understand .. based on my understanding.. my  Immature: 0.05107928 .  will only go up when the next block is found and my shares counted .. right?

[09-Mar-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> and once the 100 block passes for the respective blocks,  it will go into balance!

[09-Mar-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> In solo mining, theres no share crediting. you only earn when you find a block.

[09-Mar-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the 'wasted' shares aren't credited.

[09-Mar-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> when you (hypothetically) quit mining 1sec before you hit a block, that would be very unlucky, but ...thats how it works.

[09-Mar-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> OUCH hahaha

[09-Mar-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @0x03    >> i think i am starting to understand .. based on my understanding.. my  Immature: 0.05107928 .  will only go up when the next block is found and my shares counted .. right?
and once the 100 block passes for the respective blocks,  it will go into balance!

[09-Mar-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> am i right?

[09-Mar-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's not any different for pools tho, they just assume they'll find blocks regularily so they can pay you out 😉

[09-Mar-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but they're depending on finding blocks as well, they just do the maths ahead and tell you how big the fraction of work of that block you committed was, in terms of balance

[09-Mar-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's not like a pool has a magic 1000 verus balance it can pay out from

[09-Mar-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i read about it ... so call the risk of the pool operator right

[09-Mar-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well, it's not "risk" less operating a pool

[09-Mar-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> way before something like that comes into account

[09-Mar-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> first of all you're providing some http service (pool frontend) to the internet.

[09-Mar-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> in cryptospace.

[09-Mar-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that WILL attract fuckwads

[09-Mar-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and they will try and do all sorts of funny stuff to your pool

[09-Mar-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> not even to the website part only, but who guarantees you the users of a pool all use 'legit' miners?

[09-Mar-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i mean, don't get me wrong, you cant just change 2 lines of code in the miner and be better than anybody else

[09-Mar-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but... theres a lot of different ways to piss you off

[09-Mar-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> interesting.. thats the world we live in ..

[09-Mar-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> btw mate.. is my understanding . correct for the immature theory

[09-Mar-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> >> i think i am starting to understand .. based on my understanding.. my  Immature: 0.05107928 .  will only go up when the next block is found and my shares counted .. right?
and once the 100 block passes for the respective blocks,  it will go into balance!

[09-Mar-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> any block after the block you're talking about is taking one off the 100

[09-Mar-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i mean for my immature to go up

[09-Mar-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> now its 0.05107928

[09-Mar-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yes and most pools have a minimum balance before they release funds. Usually it will say on one of the setup pages on the pool

[09-Mar-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> so my immature balance will go up once the next block is found and i am credited right

[09-Mar-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> any found block you mined along on will give you more credit, yes

[09-Mar-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> cool

[dscrdvrsc] <dudezmobi> https://petroslawgroup.com/pdfs/btcp_letter_to_hitbtc.pdf

[10-Mar-19 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dudezmobi> gg hitbtc

[10-Mar-19 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Btw there is no fees using the verus miner right?

[10-Mar-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> correct only pool fees

[10-Mar-19 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @dudezmobi damn, messed up..

[10-Mar-19 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> @dudezmobi  Wow...thats crazy.  Definition of fail

[10-Mar-19 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> Very bad look for HitBTC. Hopefully they get held accountable for this behavior. As for the fork coin, just another scandal on their part.. they have somehow managed to outdo verge on the drama. Lol

[10-Mar-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> hello ! agama is basically a multiple in one wallet right?  and there is no fees to use it ?

[10-Mar-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> be aware of different versions of agama. but yes.

[10-Mar-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> agama can be a 'multicoin native wallet' as well as a "multicoin litemode wallet"

[10-Mar-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> as well as just your veruscoin wallet

[10-Mar-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i downloaded from the verus site..  however i want to add ETH but i cant find it

[10-Mar-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i have jack of an idea wether that would be supported

[10-Mar-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i fear, rather not

[10-Mar-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i read on komodo website there is ETH

[10-Mar-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> hm. did you try this one? 😐

[10-Mar-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thats the part where it sucks to have multiple versions of it online

[10-Mar-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> oh

[10-Mar-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the thing is:

[10-Mar-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the komodo agama probably doesn't have the latest verus daemon inside
