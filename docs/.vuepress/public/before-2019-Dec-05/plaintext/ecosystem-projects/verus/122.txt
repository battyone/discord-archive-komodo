[dscrdvrsc] <dude> Is the 100k fpga bounty still active ?

[07-Mar-19 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <michaeltoutjr> @Hollowman9000 Nothing seems out of the ordinary, but because the PoS blocks and PoW blocks are statistically 50/50, there's a non zero chance that rarely we'll get a few fast PoS blocks in succession, followed by a long PoW block as the difficulty algorithm adjusts.

[07-Mar-19 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Sorry for the false alarm

[07-Mar-19 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> The only reason it seemed odd was the apparent movement of large amounts of vrsc in each of the rapid fire blocks at the time

[07-Mar-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> But like you said, PoS

[07-Mar-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <GeekOPS-101> thanks for the announcement @miketout  - cant wait to  see /hear more about the PBaaS impementations! exciting stuff!

[08-Mar-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah, way to go  @miketout, if anyone hasn't, check out the #announcements channel! Big things ahead!

[08-Mar-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> "because when do we not enhance things?" 😂 💪 
Gotta love it! Way to go team. Looking forward to see PBaaS come to life.

[08-Mar-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm surprised no one is talking about the merged mining too, that's no small feat. Consider how mining profitability has become an issue lately and how some miners jump ship every day in search of something else. Now consider mining Verus and while you're at it, mining several other projects at the same time at no additional cost to the miner. Seems like a no brainer choice and eventually with PBaaS projects growing by choosing to be on the most advanced/secure network and miners having options, Verus can become it's own micro-economy that would offer miners/stakers and project developers an alternative that would be very hard to compete with.

[08-Mar-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Dot get me wrong, but the way I see it is pBaaS  a form of merged mining, since Verus will be the main chain and any pBaaS chain will be an auxiliary chain.... or do I look at it completely wrong?

[08-Mar-19 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well you'd think that, since they go together so well and it's such an elegant answer to many problems for both but look at Ethereum, if you build crypto kitties on them you gunk down everyone else on the network, with this each chain is independent.

[08-Mar-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If you use the asset functionality on RVN you still have to mine RVN and depend on them rather than mine your own project

[08-Mar-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Basically what this means is say you take Bitcoin and how it uses sha256, now if you had another project that runs on sha256 and merged mining was possible, you could mine BTC and the hashes you submit will have a chance to win the reward for btc and have the chance to hit for the other coin at the same time so this is something very different. Picture mining VRSC and hitting a block for them but also earning rewards for other projects just as if you were mining them.

[08-Mar-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> .
This is an excerpt from something I found online:
Merged mining works like this, you have two totally separate block chains, they are not related in any way nor does either contain any data from the other. When you mine you generate hashes that may be the solution to the current block, this is very very improbable per hash, its like a lottery where everyone generates tickets until someone finds the winning one. Normally you make tickets and check them against the Bitcoin block chain to see if they are the solution. With merged mining you create a ticket and check it against both the Bitcoin block chain and the other block chain, Bitcoin and the other chain know nothing about each other, they are two totally different lotteries with different winning numbers, you just sent a copy of your ticket to both. Since you are sending the same ticket to two lotteries you increase your chances of winning one or the other. No Bitcoin data goes into the other and none of the other coin's data goes into Bitcoin they remain totally separate, you simply run both the other coin's and Bitcoin clients on the same machine and submit hashes to both networks, if your hash is the solution to the other coin's block you get it's reward, if you hash is the solution to the Bitcoin block you get Bitcoins, its exactly like if you were mining on just one network, except you submit the same work twice."

[08-Mar-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That in conjunction with PBaaS AND this new merkle mountain range solution that may rival mimblewimble's blockchain shrinking abilities.. Verus is very technically impressive already but it's really shaping up to be something truly special.

[08-Mar-19 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, I had read all that info and compared it (in my head) with the way pBaaS is structured. Instead of continuously making a chance on both chains, the auxilairy pBaaS chain isn’t in continuous contact with the main chain: a far more efficient way to lighten the load on the main chain, which is a huge pro, IMHO.
My main reservation on merged mining is that big mining farms will simultaneously gain more control over several chains. Decentralization is at peril, which is IMHO an unwanted scenario.

[08-Mar-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well fortunately VerusHash 2.0 was designed to help prevent this by spreading the hash and as more and more jump on I'm sure more people with CPUs will become aware and join in

[08-Mar-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> True. On the other hand: Merge mining will decrease the footprint mining has on our global energy consumption. (f*ck*ng autocorrect...)

[08-Mar-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It shouldn't have any more of a centralizing effect than say ethereum and its erc projects

[08-Mar-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That's another huge benefit! On top of the CPU friendly nature of VerusHash 2.0 being energy efficient the 50%PoS is a big deal and now merged mining is another huge step towards reducing that footprint

[08-Mar-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So many angles covered it blows my mind to think how well they all compliment each other

[08-Mar-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don’t agree. Since a miner is simultaneously mining multiple chains, profitability goes up. Incentive for our cheap electricity areas to focus on those merged mining projects, which in turn centralizes mining to those areas.

[08-Mar-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Then again, if Verus would act as the main chain, the present community could aid upcoming chains/coins.

[08-Mar-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That is the idea I believe Verus would be the main chain

[08-Mar-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I can only see it as being an improvement on what we already have

[08-Mar-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> And a much more decentralized one at that

[08-Mar-19 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Since Verus is in my eyes a stable and growing chain, with 50/50 PoW/PoS I feel it would be unnecessary/unwanted to piggy-bag on a bigger chain.... with our CPU oriented algo, we pretty much ensure decentralization!

[08-Mar-19 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No no sorry

[08-Mar-19 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Verus is the main chain

[08-Mar-19 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That's the whole point. That's why it's such a big deal

[08-Mar-19 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I used that excerpt from the internet that used Bitcoin as an example

[08-Mar-19 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Just so you got a better understanding

[08-Mar-19 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Basically you would mine Verus and have the option to support other projects and earn their rewards at the same time

[08-Mar-19 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We may even introduce PiggyBag-Chain as a Service...

[08-Mar-19 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Maybe you can get working on that. Sounds like your cup of tea Oink!

[08-Mar-19 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I’m not really a programming hands-on guy..... ‘Bit’ outdated knowledge here....

[08-Mar-19 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I think these changes are so big and so completely alien to so many people that it's hard to grasp just how big a deal it is just by trying to explain it

[08-Mar-19 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> What would you consider outdated? A television with knobs?

[08-Mar-19 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 25 years since my last programming....

[08-Mar-19 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We had a remote control on our TV: my father just yelled “Oink, switch the channel!!!”

[08-Mar-19 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Let me put it this way: my first compute had  a whopping 1 kB memory, so any descent program had to be written in assembler, in order not to run out of memory!

[08-Mar-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Haha oh man

[08-Mar-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I can remember floppy disks when they were still floppy but I think you've got me beat

[08-Mar-19 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Floppies? I had to hook up my cassette deck!

[08-Mar-19 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763

[08-Mar-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Oink  seems we share some nostalgic memories, I still own one of those Commodore CBM 3032 with datasette ... was my first "PC" ^^

[08-Mar-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That’s a farm using ginasis as pool

[08-Mar-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Thoskk mine was a Sinclair zx-81. I don’t know which of those 2 emerged earlier

[08-Mar-19 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> I started on Didaktik Gama, a ZX Spectrum clone from Czech republic

[08-Mar-19 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> And my first PC I used was IBM PC XT. Programming in assembler, making viruses and funny apps.

[08-Mar-19 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> Can you launch an ICO project as an autochain on Verus? Or are autochains for fair launch projects only with only option being a premine for funding?

[08-Mar-19 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Not 100% but I imagine you'd have as much freedom as can be permitted in the code.  I don't see any reason for this limitation but someone with more knowledge may be able to give you a better answer.

[08-Mar-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Jskull04 that is someone mining with a good handful of different rigs. They have been a decent loyal miner with ginasis for a while now. Whoever it is, thanks for the support!

[08-Mar-19 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jskull04> @That_Guy8 so does it look like that when you have multiple miners under the same wallet/ID?

[08-Mar-19 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Correct that is a whole bunch of seperate miners / devices running to a single address.

[08-Mar-19 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jskull04> Ah okay

[08-Mar-19 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jskull04> So satisfying to look at

[08-Mar-19 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[08-Mar-19 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Haha yeah I wish I had all that power for my farm 😃 @ the owner, kindly mine to my address for a few days please xD

[09-Mar-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jskull04> hmmm so this bounty thing right?! if i do it one how do you prove it? and do you just get sent verus?

[09-Mar-19 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @Jskull04 wow, would like to have all those workers 😁 Are they on luckpool or?

[09-Mar-19 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jskull04> no Ginasis (lowest fees)

[09-Mar-19 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Ok!

[09-Mar-19 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> I´ve been thinking about its for a while. Whats the positive things when you mine on Ginasis? wonder if you support verus coin community more directly or so, but don't know. Been mining on luckpool as I said, think ist exiting with the "luck" bonus if you find a block. Not much luck for me 😄 but any way one of my worker found a block the other day and I think I got 2 VRSC as bonus. Its pretty good for me, that more than day of mining with my gear.

[09-Mar-19 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> What is the bounty thing on Ginasis?

[09-Mar-19 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
