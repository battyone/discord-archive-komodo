[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> but its flat 80 degrees 24/7

[20-Jul-18 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <iO_User> with the nhd15? @Lil komodo 

at what clock speed and voltage?

[20-Jul-18 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <iO_User> and what sort of temperatures are you getting outdoors/in the house?

[20-Jul-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <iO_User> I mean, what's the ambient temps? üòÉ

[20-Jul-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> Ambient not sure but high up apartment in qld

[20-Jul-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> so its not cold thats for sure LOL

[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> not too sure tbh LOL first time ocv

[20-Jul-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <iO_User> that's pretty good

[20-Jul-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <iO_User> I should probably use a fan like  that instead of stock, though I don't think my chip is a good overclocker

[20-Jul-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <iO_User> was getting 4075 on over 1.3V ... temps hitting near 90 with stock fan

[20-Jul-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <iO_User> 1.4 is a rough ceiling for these amds apparently so, still some room and could bring temps down with a cooler

[dscrdvrsc] <lootz> Any instructions on how to use the same wallet on multiple machines ?

[21-Jul-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <lootz> if  thats possible

[21-Jul-18 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> around 26th july will be the start of unlocked block, i think maybe after that, pool will pop up. By then it should be easy to point all the machines there.

[21-Jul-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <lootz> yea I have so many computer with wallet would of been nice if they were all the same but not a big deal

[21-Jul-18 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <lootz> So I used the same wallet.dat in all the computers, I hope their is no issue with doing this and mining on all of them

[21-Jul-18 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <lootz> looks to be working from what I see so far

[21-Jul-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> did you follow the FAQ2

[21-Jul-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> Q: How do I direct all my mined rewards to a single Verus wallet?
A: 
Step 1 - First get your wallet address you want to mine to:
IN AGAMA GUI
Click "Receive", click "Get New Address" and choose "Transparent Address" from the drop down.
IN VERUS-CLI
You can find an address if you already have previous transactions, or you can create a new one.  To find an address from a previous transaction, use the command line verus listtransactions and copy the address found after "address".
To generate a new wallet address, use the command line verus getnewaddress and a new address will be created.

Step 2 - Next, using your new address, enter the command with verus-cli verus validateaddress. From the output find the long string after "pubkey", copy without the quotation marks.

Step 3 - Last, use this pubkey when starting your daemon by adding the following line to the end of your command, just before the "&" sign: -pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED

Your rewards will now be mined to that address.  It would be a good idea to keep notes and associate the wallet address with the pubkey...also to double check that you did validate the correct pubkey for the wallet address, making sure you made no errors.(edited)

[21-Jul-18 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <lootz> no I did not know this

[21-Jul-18 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> 61mh/s 16 days with no rewards, still in the game but looking forward to some pools opening up,  to anyone still finding blocks ,well done üëçüèº

[21-Jul-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Tommygun007> 5 days for me without a block found @145mh/s

[21-Jul-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> 5 blocks today with 480mh üòõ

[21-Jul-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> I wonder, does having multiple computers benefit at all? Or is hash rate the only thing that matters? I do have 2 dusty laptops, 1 old pc and 1 gaming pc mining at the same time

[21-Jul-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> though 3 of those are at around 20-30mh LOL.

[21-Jul-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <lootz> @Lil komodo multiple computer same wallet ? or are they a diff wallets ?

[21-Jul-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im running the agama wallet on 1 pc and getting 29mh/s and im running a different agama wallet on another pc giving me 31mh/s so my total hash rate is 61mh/s   , im working on ways to up my hash rate with new cpu‚Äôs or more likely for now just get as many old pc‚Äôs or laptops i can that give me an ok ish hash rate

[21-Jul-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> @stretcher83  I think the problem is @Lil komodo s new 2700x is sucking up all the blocks üòâ

[22-Jul-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Very much thinking about upgrading to a 2700X as well its 4x faster than the fx8350 I am using now. But I just got a new laptop and almost never use my PC anymore so it might be cheaper to just rent hash power once the 96 versus blocks are go.

[22-Jul-18 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> @blackjok3r I got it knowing there was only 1 week left til halving, just in case hashrate flies haha

[22-Jul-18 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> in 1 day I got 6 blocks (not sure if got lucky or what)

[22-Jul-18 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> but thats 1200 coins for a $600 setup, and itll continue to mine for however long it lives so its pretty worth it üòõ

[23-Jul-18 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Just a heads up hours before I actually post an announcement, we are planning to release an update today that includes major improvements and additional features in Agama:
1. Includes support for the Electrum changes that recently broke SPV (lite mode) for other coins in our version of Agama. 
2. Includes the new Agama core feature of "Hide sensitive data", which obscures amounts and addresses on screen to allow screen shots without exposing sensitive data.
3. We've also added a new capability in our version of Agama only to easily send and receive encrypted memos along with Verus z-transactions, even for a zero amount and just the fee. This allows zero knowledge privacy and strong encryption in sending messages, which we think is pretty cool and useful both now and for applications in the future.
I'm going to announce it as a critical update for both the GUI and command line, which everyone will want to be on by the halving. More details and downloads soon üòÉ

[23-Jul-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superslack> Anyone know If there is gpu mining for versus yet?

[23-Jul-18 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Alright> getting ~200MH all together with a 1080 and 1080ti, and it doesn't scale linearly with more GPUs

[23-Jul-18 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Alright> not quite worth doing

[23-Jul-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Alright> also it limits what your CPU can do. My CPU typically does 80MH by itself, but if I mine with both cards, it does close to 0. So it's only a ~120MH gain with a 1080 and a ti

[23-Jul-18 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> Would running 14 or 15 core instead of 16 help?

[23-Jul-18 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Alright, you are mining with the test miner? does it mine blocks with transactions yet?

[23-Jul-18 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> is this code public yet?

[23-Jul-18 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> or just empty blocks? i haven't heard it was ready to use for processing transactions

[23-Jul-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the code is in a public repo, but i didn't think it was ready to use for anything but testing.

[23-Jul-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i would hope that we don't end up with people mining a lot of empty blocks. we gave a bounty for it to be finished, so it could be used fully functional.

[23-Jul-18 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @superslack the answer, as I understand it, is that the GPU mining is not ready to be used yet, and if someone is using it now, I thought it would only be for testing. the fastest GPUs are not beating CPUs, and I believed we were going to get it finished before announcing it for anyone to use. I don't know if @Alright is using it or testing with @Decker who is writing it. I also hadn't heard it was ready to use and am focused right now on getting the release I described out. I'm waiting for a response from Decker and Alright. If it's not mining transactions yet and people are using it, I hope people stop using it before it's ready or we get transaction processing in, not just testing.

[23-Jul-18 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> looking forward to hear more about `We've also added a new capability in our version of Agama only to easily send and receive encrypted memos along with Verus z-transactions, even for a zero amount and just the fee. `, that sounds like it would require that Verus merged in my recent Zcash bugfix to z_sendmany

[23-Jul-18 06:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dukeleto i believe for a couple reasons related to testing, we are considering a delay in the messaging feature. we will still do the release. that zero amount capability was expected, but we are seeing a requirement to send at least the fee amount caused by the bug you describe.

[23-Jul-18 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @miketout it was just merged to Zcash master, I have not yet sent a PR to Komodo yet.

[23-Jul-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I'm not seeing a bug when we send with zero amount and 0.0001 fee. i may have misunderstood the absurd fee bug

[23-Jul-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Alright @Decker told me that you are helping him test, and it sounds like the data that you guys are getting is quite useful and still very supportive of indefinite CPU mining. He also said that it won't be processing transactions and ready for real use for maybe a month or more. For everyone, if I hear anything about a threatening GPU miner, I will let you know. What I've heard so far on this work, which is supposed to already be perf optimized to some degree, is that when it is ready, it won't beat CPUs, but if you already have a high end card or two, it will be a nice mining option. it also seems to bottleneck pretty hard on systems with multiple cards or risers, as it is very sensitive to data transfer speeds. still work in progress.

[23-Jul-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @gamer278 We are pretty new, and CMC requires an exchange with some volume and an API that they support. Now that we have this release out, I will check with digitalprice on their API progress for CMC. We are also looking at other exchanges, but right now, we have no real barrier to being listed besides being on a supported exchange and getting their acceptance.
