[dscrdvrsc] <Moker> @Gmoney correct, it stays locked

[27-Jun-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> oh is the number after Immature (xxxx) the lock time for that block?

[27-Jun-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Moker> yes, in minutes

[27-Jun-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> right.. block time is a minute

[27-Jun-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @Gmoney If you are using CLI check out  @dukeleto's perl script. Its wonderful. https://github.com/leto/Util/blob/master/bin/block_maturity_dates.pl
(I had to correct one path for the CLI download version )

[27-Jun-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> 30-32 hours (roughly) to find a block with newer i7

[27-Jun-18 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> there were a bug in split pow/pos, corrected. I've also added number of locked coins released each month

[27-Jun-18 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> If anyone is curious.. there is the current phase halving schedule

[27-Jun-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> I was wrong when I predicted 100GH by the start of unlocked 96 VRSC rewards

[27-Jun-18 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> I wonder if this backs off at all after this current halving?

[27-Jun-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> i dont think it will by much

[27-Jun-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> with the new hashing getting 50MH on decent systems, thats 20 nanoseconds per hash!, it is interesting that much older systems are getting close to the same and the fastest at 75MH or so. this update has really leveled the playing field. The ideal mining "rig" would seem to be a dozen old laptops instead of a GPU

[27-Jun-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @jl777c very succint observation ðŸ˜ƒ

[27-Jun-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> I think you can buy a few dozen old laptops for the cost of a fancy GPU? not sure about current prices, but say 25 systems would get almost 1GH and it seems unlikely any GPU can get that sort of speed

[27-Jun-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> i3s to i7s are doing quite well.. but I cant get the pentium and celeron chips to mine at all..

[27-Jun-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> they get stuck on 'activating best chain' and I never get into mining with the pentium and celeron (even though they are newer builds)

[27-Jun-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> with i3/i5/i7 literally everywhere and in many low cost systems, it allows most anyone to get decent hashrate and the ambitiuous can go a bit crazy on eBay to build a farm

[27-Jun-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> That has some real beauty to it, I believe.

[27-Jun-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> if we see the hashrate rising linearly after the current surge, then I think that will be what is happening as people find long abandoned i5 systems to put them in service

[27-Jun-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> is there any way to retrieve node location (bitcoin has getaddr)? Would be nice to look at geo diffusion of Verus

[27-Jun-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> getpeerinfo and do geoip

[27-Jun-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> but configure so you get a large numbe of peers, like the explorer has

[27-Jun-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bitcoinB> has the updatew to increase hashpower been pushed and if so how to inpliment it please as im still getting 7.65m/hs on a i7 8700 12 threads

[27-Jun-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> @bitcoinB Why not read #announcements ? just update to the latest version

[27-Jun-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bitcoinB> yup thanks i did just that but wasnt 100% sure it was pushed ive updated to new walllet and still only getting same hash rate as before any advise ?

[27-Jun-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> are you sure you're using version 0.3.8?

[27-Jun-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> seem unlikely getting same hash rate

[27-Jun-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bitcoinB> yup 100% problem now solved thanks

[27-Jun-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bitcoinB> in terms of staking what are the rewards like i was thinking of stakeing on another wallet

FYI I fell I had scalability issues yesterday with multiple threads on xeon, switching to DEV branch fixed it, it may not be the best solution, as DEV is not obviously intended to be as stable as MASTER, but it made me go from 13M to 226M

[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> we need a poolðŸ˜‚

[28-Jun-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> a month later i think we will have a pool

[28-Jun-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> Once the timelock ends, pools will show up quickly I'm sure.

[28-Jun-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> yes

[28-Jun-18 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> congrats, I am seeing KMD notarizations for VRSC in my logs

[28-Jun-18 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> this new 0.3.9 release has some serious performance gains, wow. One of my rigs went from 55 to 275 MH/s

[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> block reward down to 192

[28-Jun-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> So much hash now for only 192 coins

[28-Jun-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Darn

[28-Jun-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> ya but my hash just went up 4x with the upgrade

[28-Jun-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> so everyting is pretty mush same same once the last people upgrade..

[28-Jun-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> same same except for half the reward that is..

[28-Jun-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> my cinema 4d render farm got put to great use ðŸ˜ƒ

[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> HODL gang

[28-Jun-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Do the staked coins (via the ones that are currently unlocked) generate more locked or unlocked coins?

[28-Jun-18 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> It is same, unlocked coins right now is generating locked coins like POW

[28-Jun-18 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> thnaks

[28-Jun-18 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> the game just did get a little more tilted back to the newer gen cpus though with a more favorable bump

[28-Jun-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Hash doesn't really matter because everyone upgraded

[28-Jun-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> It's comparable once everyone upgrades

[28-Jun-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> mostly.. except fore a slight realighment to favor those with multicore cpus

[28-Jun-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> digging old laptops out of the closet isnt quite as favorable as it was just before the upgrade

[28-Jun-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763

[28-Jun-18 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> the latest upgrade for my newest i7 wasnt a 14x though..  6x on the high side of newer i7.. perhaps some of the 8-12 core processors can achieve a much larger multiple..

[28-Jun-18 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> so this video above I think was before the 038 upgrade right? So its the 038 + 039 upgrades combined which would be a more significant bump

[dscrdvrsc] <block-miner> Yes

[dscrdvrsc] <shaman_ns> Hi, can I mine on the same wallet, using two separate machines?

[28-Jun-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> yes, it works copy the wallet. Make sure to make backups though... I am not sure if you add an address to one wallet â€“ I guess won't be sync'ed to the other, so be careful

[28-Jun-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <shaman_ns> Thanks @karero. What do you mean "copy the wallet"? Do you mean the seed/private key? Sorry, noob here...

[28-Jun-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> The whole wallet.data usually in the .komodo > VRSC folder

[28-Jun-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> @karero for sure! when you backup a wallet.dat  and new keys are added to the keypool they reside only in the wallet that has geenerated them

[28-Jun-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <shaman_ns> Ok, so I basically copy the `wallet.dat` file into the other wallet. Got it!

[28-Jun-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Replace it, but before make a back-up...

[28-Jun-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thank you @TexWiller !
On another topic, based on the significant rise in hash rate, I think we can safely say that if there were any GPU miners active, they have been completely out hashed by this upgrade ðŸ˜ƒ sometime, we will find out if GPUs can keep up with this. if they can, i am doubtful that they'll be competitive at similar power draw. hopefully CPUs will now be useful miners for quite some time

[28-Jun-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> @miketout. Has anyone ever mentioned how coincidental the timing of the upgrade was?

[28-Jun-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Same time as halfing?

[28-Jun-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Was this for marketing purposes?

[28-Jun-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We were forced into the timing. Someone working on a GPU miner first led me to believe that GPUs were going to be a threat to CPUs and then also discovered that this was possible and mined at least one block with the the method. Prior to that, we had left the option to close this method off or use it at some point. We had to decide immediately, and after a lot of calculating, determined that providing it to everyone would be the best chance to keep CPUs viable indefinitely, so we chose that option. Exact timing was coincidental and definitely not the most convenient personally. End result is better than I thought it would be on perf, which I guess is good for those of us in the community who would like to see Verus succeed ðŸ˜ƒ

[28-Jun-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> Just mentioned you guys in an interview I did for Komodo.

I had a dream. And in that dream, people released wallets and with those releases "Linux" wasn't a euphemism for "Ubuntu" but actually meant "Linux".

[28-Jun-18 11:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> That's something we're working towards. I'm hoping we'll soon have something that at least works on new(ish) releases of Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS.
