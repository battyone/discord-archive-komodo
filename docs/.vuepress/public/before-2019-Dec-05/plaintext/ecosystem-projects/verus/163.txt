[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> AMD GPU's do very bad on verus...

[11-May-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> whats an F1 mini?

[11-May-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Nvidia  somewhat better

[11-May-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> F1 mini is an FPGA. it does about 25MHs at about 25 Watts

[11-May-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i like cpu seems like a more even playing field

[11-May-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> oh nice

[11-May-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That's indeed the vision of this project

[11-May-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> should i try 16 cores? im guessing i shouldnt leave it at 16 though right

[11-May-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> maximum decentralization

[11-May-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> even when not using the comp

[11-May-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, you can. The integrated miner is pretty forgiving... But if it affects your GUI, you can always lower it by 1 thread at the time

[11-May-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> nice

[11-May-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i was mining Nerva for a bit. how do u guys compare to them?

[11-May-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don't know Nerva. I commited to this project for its vision. The money isn't my main objective

[11-May-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ya i didnt mean money wise

[11-May-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i left there server and stopped mining becasue there community on discord was horrible

[11-May-19 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> This is a very friendly community. Never seen an argumant here

[11-May-19 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> great

[11-May-19 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> disagreements: yes, but not to the point that it became uncomfortable

[11-May-19 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> it was toxic on there server

[11-May-19 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> and people abusing power there if u disagree with them

[11-May-19 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That would drive me away too

[11-May-19 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> they actually have a channel called #exile that they put u in if u get into an arguement or disagree

[11-May-19 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ts embarrasing

[11-May-19 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> like 12 year olds

[11-May-19 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not a place for me then....

[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> yes lol

[11-May-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> also seen this project backed by some big names which always helps

[11-May-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Our lead dev is kind of big, yes...

[11-May-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But heâ€™s just another human being, working on his vision.

[11-May-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> of course

[11-May-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And the community is strongly development oriented... most of us chip in where we can.

[11-May-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> excellent

[11-May-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763

[11-May-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 2 reasons: we don't believe in paying an exchange to get listed, so they can earn their commisions and we're only a (just) 1-year old chain. being listed on an abundant amount of exchanges does nothing for value or developement

[11-May-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> good reasons.

[11-May-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i dont know much which is why im asking

[11-May-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you don't ask, you stay ignorant, so ask away

[11-May-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> at Nerva we were getting Vtes on Bitmesh  to get List were changing between most and 2nd most

[11-May-19 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> Votes*

[11-May-19 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so Nerva paid to get on the voting list?

BitMesh Exchange

[11-May-19 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> nerva is in 2nd now

[11-May-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don't imagine they paid. Voting basically gets you listed for free...

[11-May-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ah, you just quoted that

[11-May-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> lol

[11-May-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so Verus is not even trying to get voted in since the chain is too young basically?

[11-May-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Too young is not the reason. I think it would be worth a shot to get listed there on votes

[11-May-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i see

[11-May-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> somone from verus should apply then ðŸ˜›

[11-May-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> we would smash the votes

[11-May-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i think u can vote once a day

[11-May-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Digital Price has about 95% of our daily volume, which is roughly 1-2 BTC a day.

[11-May-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ya i seen that site quickly

[11-May-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Anyone from our community can do that... We don't need approval or anything...

[11-May-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i hear u . but would help if it was one of the devs or something so can also put a message asking ppl to vote if they have time etc

[11-May-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> if i did it no oen would care or vote or see any messages asking them to vote lol

[11-May-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you post the link, people will vote.... People will listen to the devs, but it's not that they control it.

[11-May-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> DonÂ´t it cost a lot to get listed? People seem happy with DP, even though it has been down for maintanance quite a lot. Very few are using STEX, will another exchange really matter? Not sure myself.

[11-May-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> no but would prolly get more voted and faster if one of the devs did it i would guess

[11-May-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i dont know either.., just asking and learning

[11-May-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Crupti We could get voted into being listed for free

[11-May-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Then I donÂ´t see why not ðŸ˜ƒ

[11-May-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> we havce more users in this discord then Nerva and they are switching between 1st and 2nd in votes

[11-May-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> we would win in no time im sure lol

[11-May-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just looking at their agreement... This is a bit fuzzy: ` Legal, true and accurate personal data is required;`, no details on what data is required exactly

[11-May-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ya didnt look that deepy into it myself

[11-May-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> thats why im saying someone that knows what there doing should apply.. or not apply lol

[11-May-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If this exchanges requires KYC info, just to exchange between cryptos, a lot of people won't bother.

[11-May-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i see

[11-May-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i guess its illegal still in the rest of netherlands?

[11-May-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We should move to #off-topic for this discussion
