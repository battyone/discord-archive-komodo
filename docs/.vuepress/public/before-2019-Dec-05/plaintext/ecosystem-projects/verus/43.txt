[24-Oct-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz_77> @miketout  They added an ETH pairing on Digital Price

[24-Oct-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Blockfolio needs to get off their asses and add  digitalprice to the current version (apparently it‚Äôs on the beta 2.0 that no one can get into anymore)

[24-Oct-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Inkurious> Stex is great, used it to trade a couple of lowcaps before

[24-Oct-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Inkurious> Is the Cryptopia listing still going to happen or has that been written off?

[24-Oct-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> as far as I know, all is still ok on that

[24-Oct-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> just time, i think

[24-Oct-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763

[24-Oct-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Wonder how much review time stex will need

[24-Oct-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Its their offer so they are probably motivated enough :)

[24-Oct-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz_77> I'm sure it was the daily, When Binance?, crowd that got them motivated

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz_77> @ok88 @Hollowman9000 Here's what I told JohnWestbrook.. We find out where CZ is for the day. Send a plane in the air that says,  List Us? with a Verus logo   ..... instead of marry me lol

[24-Oct-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> bkex seems like a big exchange and they want to list VRSC

[25-Oct-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> I have never used this exchange though , I wonder if anybody has used them before

[25-Oct-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Cryptopia over stex!

[25-Oct-18 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz_77> @jonske1 Why not both?

[25-Oct-18 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Yeah both sounds great.

[25-Oct-18 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Just think cryptopia would be the one to aim for.

[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> (1440x24)/2 POW, (1440x24)/2 POS @thedon

[25-Oct-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Oct-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> 50/50 (more or less)

[25-Oct-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Hey everyone; liking the community ethos thus far. I'm not a tech person, so indulging my ignorance: 1. what benefit I am receiving from staking VRSC on the agama wallet? And 2. On avg, how often can I expect to get a block reward from mining w the agama wallet (approx 83 mega hash/s)? And finally, 3. I'm mining/staking w agama, but also purchase from DP occasionally- do I have to update my staking each time I add more VRSC from DP, or is the TOTAL in my agama wallet automatically staked? Thanks for any answers! Really excited to see where we can go with this project. Miketout and the other devs on this team are amazing! We need more Youtube interviews than just the one with Crypto Rich. üôÇ

[25-Oct-18 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VirtualSoundNW> 1. Staking benefit: you have a small chance to win 24 coins in the current epoch for each staked block if your wallet is staking. Reward declines in later epochs.
2. Take your hashes / network hashes to get a rough estimate of your chance to mine. 
3. If you're staking with a wallet, any public (non-Z address keyed) VerusCoins you've moved in will be staked.

[25-Oct-18 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Better keep that kitten away from our blockchain. I hear they tend to multiply and clog up the network. Let Vitalik have them

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @VirtualSoundNW thanks for the answers üëç

[25-Oct-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <2Faze> @CryptoAlex thx which wallet is recommended to store verus? Any mobile available?

[25-Oct-18 11:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @2Faze You can get the Agama GUI or CLI for desktop on the verus website. There is a mobile version for android that will be released after sapling activation (oct 28). 

miketout (lead dev) wrote about it last monday on software discussion channel:
"there is an Agama mobile wallet available for Android now, which supports Verus, and once we get past the Sapling activation, which includes pool, electrum, and lite mode updates still to happen, we will focus on completing a very nice React Native mobile wallet that is already in the works and will have a number of unique features that we believe will make a difference, can't talk about specifics quite yet or when."

[25-Oct-18 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <2Faze> Thank you man i am married with iphone so have to choose desktop wallet for now and looking forward to a mobile later! What is the differenz between GUI and CLI?

[25-Oct-18 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> GUI - Graphic User Interface
CLI - Command-LIne tool

[26-Oct-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <2Faze> Couldnt bought on exchange bcause when i signed up didnt received the confirmation mail... any ideas whats wrong there

[26-Oct-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @CryptoAlex I know. I was lucky enough to read the whitepaper before launch üòÉ Just felt like making a joke abouth Eth. The scalability and the security was a big part of what caught my attention.

[26-Oct-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Oct-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> There is no asic for verushash

[26-Oct-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> And I can‚Äôt imagine someone diverted manufacturing/technical staff to design and spit one out in 4 months for an otherwise unknown coin

[26-Oct-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Gpu/cpu are the options

[26-Oct-18 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> @Hollowman9000 i agree, but how come above guys can mine with such a high hash power

[26-Oct-18 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> becaz of this greedy fuckers we are not getting rite

[26-Oct-18 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Maybe someone has privately setup an FPGA (I‚Äôll admit my ignorance, I had to go read up on what they were)

[26-Oct-18 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> There‚Äôll always be a top dog, mining has always been an arms race

[26-Oct-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> iam giving up mining ... its no profit....

[26-Oct-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> FYI, opened Blockfolio last night and it had an update, updated to 2.0 and DP is in their system now.  Switched my Verus over to show DP prices üòÉ

[26-Oct-18 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> This was the version for iPhone

[26-Oct-18 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> (Not sure about android, someone want to check if the official update is out?)

[26-Oct-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptoprofit.zone> can some one please confirm if i deleted all my verus files in %appdata% and downloaded thenew wallet from website thats all i need to do to update, everything seems fine and ive made a transaction to shield funds from a block i mined (solomining) just a little concern that i may have it wrong as at the last change i was mining blocks on the wrong chain

[26-Oct-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Oct-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @cryptoprofit.zone check the block number in the wallet and compare with the one in the explorer

[26-Oct-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Oct-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Nice @Hollowman9000 ! Yeah, it's nice having it all organized now üòÉ I was about to develop my own API webapp

[26-Oct-18 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @cryptoprofit.zone I believe that if you have successfully shielded coins and your block height is right, you should be fine üëç

[26-Oct-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @damodar you know little it seems. 400 gh/s is like ... 100 rigs of 6x1070. That means that the top miner is just a 100 rig guy. It's not even a full scale mining facility, it's just a solid mining hub. Nothing suspicious about that

[26-Oct-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> @John Westbrook it made my blockfolio a little less depressing üòÜ

[26-Oct-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Oct-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <2Faze> Whats the ticker for verus in blockfolio?

[26-Oct-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Yes I cant seem to find it either, although yes  @John Westbrook there was quite an overhaul on the UI

[26-Oct-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Ticker is VRSC

[26-Oct-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Oh okay I did find it now. Hopefully they add logo soon!

[26-Oct-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <2Faze> Ok thx but for VRSC the only exchange available is barterDEX... how you found DP?

[26-Oct-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Yeah, I'm writing them to request the logo refresh
