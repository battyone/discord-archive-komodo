[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> >Assuming once it's merged to komodo code, later it'd be possible to add different mining algorithms to chose an option for assetchains, like scrypt, x11, etc. etc. **Not entirely sure how hard or easy it might be, but I'm sure it is possible.**

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Hey - what does a cheat catcher payment look like in the GUI wallet?

[31-Oct-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I think I got one, but not certain.

[31-Oct-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The end result was a 24 VRSC block to a T address that has never been used in my wallet.

[31-Oct-18 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> if you don't have a -pubkey set, all block rewards go to a new taddr

[31-Oct-18 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> But I thought all staking rewards went to the address that holds the staking UTXO?

[31-Oct-18 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I am not mining.  Just staking and set up for cheat catcher blocks.

[31-Oct-18 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> So, this was a cheat catch it would seem...

[31-Oct-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> @jimboscott known bug, check #community-support

[31-Oct-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> Staking reward right now create new t-address

[31-Oct-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> But, the staking reward also involved a Z address as well...

[31-Oct-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Never seen that before

[31-Oct-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I cannot upgrade right now - OK to leave alone for a few hours?

[31-Oct-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Why would a normally staked block get a Z address involved?

[31-Oct-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> A few answers @jimboscott @John Westbrook @grewalsatinder  @dukeleto :
1. We have identified a few small issues while running under Sapling on mainnet. None of them are serious, and we will address all in the next few days. The relevant one here is that currently all stakes are being delegated to a new address that would have been the address when you are mining. Until the next update, POS does not respect -pubkey and will payout to new addresses as if mining without pubkey
2. The code base should allow Equihash + VerusPOS after integration. Someone would have to do some work and understand the new chain power rules to add other POW algorithms, but VerusPOS doesn't really know or care what the specific POW algorithm is.

[31-Oct-18 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Thanks for the update @miketout, really enjoying the incredible performance improvements and great that everything has transitioned so smoothly, I know that's not by accident, very deliberately outstanding and devoted dev work by you and the other devs here.  Kudos.

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Welcome to the community @verz36!

[31-Oct-18 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @miketout What was really different about the block I saw come in was the fact that it had a Z address as part of the chain of transactions.  I have never seen that before.  There were 4 wallet entries.  From the first to last, it was a known T address IN of 300, a Z address in of 0, a T address OUT of 300, then the block reward to a new T address.  All at the same block height.

[31-Oct-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @jimboscott Happened to me today. AFAIK, StakeGuard works is by spending the cheater coins when they mature to your cheat catch S-address, so my conclusion is that the immature coins that go to a T-address can't be the result of cheat catch and are just a regular stake. I have no idea why the Z-transaction is there, though

[31-Oct-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jimboscott right. the issue is that the OP_RETURN of the stake transaction is showing up as a 0 amount transaction and because Agama doesn't know the destination (there is none), it assumes unknown Z. for the point release, I am adding information to the transactions that indicate whether they are stake transactions, mined coinbases, or minted coinbases. getting this information took more API calls before than it will after this change. Verus Agama will use this to collapse all the stake ins and outs into one, obvious "stake" transaction that shows the amount. We also expect to differentiate between mined and minted.

[31-Oct-18 11:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ethacetin> Quick question: is all that weirdness w/digitalprice settled? If I deposit some BTC to DP it should be all good, right?

[31-Oct-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ethacetin Digital price had a couple day delay at the change to 0.4.0 where they needed to update the wallet. They did so, came to the Discord and apologized for the delay, then completed all pending transactions. All has been fine since. I know of no issues with or complaints about their exchange at this time

[01-Nov-18 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ethacetin> Thank you.

[01-Nov-18 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @miketout Blocktype on TxID Info already has the minted or mined information

[01-Nov-18 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but not in listtransactions

[01-Nov-18 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and calling gettransaction on every transaction is expensive

[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> thanks for reminder on the  https://txbit.io/Coin

[01-Nov-18 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> just voted 4 times again

[01-Nov-18 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> it is a good idea to remind us all. maybe twitter

[01-Nov-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> i would vote more but it seems they log the ip and the pc

[01-Nov-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> so swthcing proxy/isp does not help much.

[01-Nov-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> anyone found a work arround other than using VPS?

[01-Nov-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> i tried vpn and other browsers

[01-Nov-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> Atlant (ATL) is at +10K

[01-Nov-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> nearly dubble ours

[01-Nov-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> bots?

[01-Nov-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah VPN and incognito do work. Guess they haven't prevented it properly so if it's an option and others may be doing it then I'd say VPN away. Voted a few good votes as well

[01-Nov-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A few VPN IPs were burnt so someone else was using the same one doing the same thing prob

[01-Nov-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> Atlant (ATL) is at +10K

[01-Nov-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> could be them

[01-Nov-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> small script that burns throught ISP ip's and give you or a team of pl the CAPTCHA  when asked will do the trick

[01-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> cleaver move from txbit  though. just the organic exposure for them would justify this campaign

[01-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That damn captcha was the only thing holding me back from doing more. That thing is a pain in the ass and doesn't seem to be working right. I don't even know if they want me to select the street lights including the poles am I supposed to select the squares that have just a tiny bit of the streetlight protruding into them? Why wouldn't they simply put street lights in one picture and nothing in the next

[01-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> sometimes there is just not a right answer

[01-Nov-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> kind of the idea i would think. slow pl down to a hassle so that it is hit and miss

[01-Nov-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Sounds like a metaphor for life Confucius

[01-Nov-18 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763

[01-Nov-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Matterbridge honestly I'd say a threadripper 1950x or 2950x for price/performance and power use. For gpu 1080 ti is powerful and efficient while Vega 64 may edge out in MH/s but uses more power. For efficiency I've heard 1070ti. In my case I find it best to limit power to 80% or less while giving a decent overclock

[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> @Godballz you are correct, I own both 1080ti and 1070ti and the 1070ti is more efficient. I would argue that it is the most efficient mining card ( not taking into account the rtx cards )

[01-Nov-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> however having less gpus is better and less of a headache, so I would chose the 1080ti's if I had to add more cards

[01-Nov-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Good point. Is there any data yet on rtx cards hashrate and efficiency?
