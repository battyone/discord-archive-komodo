[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i think check logs or use some rpc commands to gather info

[31-Jan-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i.e. `getinfo` from the settings->cli thingy agama has

[31-Jan-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> lol, I'm not technical

[31-Jan-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> no worries

[31-Jan-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> it looks like a GUI bug

[31-Jan-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> but it is working

[31-Jan-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'm verifying it as we speak as well

[31-Jan-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> doesn't matter how much computers you do actually own

[31-Jan-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's usually 1 too little

[31-Jan-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> can anybody on osx verify the 0.5.5 agama is working?

[31-Jan-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> cause it doesn't for me on 2 macbooks sadly

[31-Jan-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm running it on Windows and Linux just fine

[31-Jan-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> mining and staking

[31-Jan-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the released version

[31-Jan-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'm waiting on linux to sync up 😄

[31-Jan-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but it's looking fine.

[31-Jan-19 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> linux 0.5.5 agama works for me as well, staking and mining.

[31-Jan-19 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> debug.log and `getmininginfo` and GUI output match

[31-Jan-19 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> which... is a good sign

[31-Jan-19 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> nothing short of that

[31-Jan-19 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AlexLibertas> Awesome

[31-Jan-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> @AlexLibertas welcome

[31-Jan-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @AlexLibertas welcome ✌

[31-Jan-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @GlorymanRTS over here

[31-Jan-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> ok so with your first analogy. What was unique about it compared to leaving the room and catching up later?

[31-Jan-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> so like I was saying, 1 of the 3 guys leaves the room while the other 2 keep making transactions in their ledgers, the 3rd guy let's say doesn't add anything to his ledger, when he returns he just updates with the entries the other 2 made and is caught up

[31-Jan-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> yeah i understand that. So that is when you turn off you wallet and not change it

[31-Jan-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> What's unique about the other analogy, wherein the 3rd guy "forks" away, that's equivelent to him leaving the room and while he's alone entering transaction entries that the 2 don't know about

[31-Jan-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> So, how does being on a different wallet mean that you are making transactions that the other two dont know about?

[31-Jan-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> then he comes back and wants them to be valid, but in those lines where he entered his own, unbeknownst to the other 2, they have agreed upon transactions already filling it out.

[31-Jan-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So they aren't going to delete theirs in favor of his

[31-Jan-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> if he wants to keep entering valid data with them, he has to delete all the entries he made alone and replace them with thiers

[31-Jan-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> why do old wallets make up their own transactions?

[31-Jan-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> i get that more ledgers wins. I don;t get that an old wallet tries to make transactions that other ledgers don't know about

[31-Jan-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So that's a really simplified, to make the "fork" part more understandable let's say there are 10 people and 3 leave

[31-Jan-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> the 3 sit in another room making entries in their ledgers

[31-Jan-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> go on

[31-Jan-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <papacheal> @John Westbrook Has anyone else mentioned the UI "bug" that seems to have appeared in 5.5 wallet release regarding staking/mining? When I click "Start Staking", the  UI appears to enable both Staking and Mining as "true", as if they are linked. If I "Stop Mining" nothing happens; I have to "Stop Staking" to stop them both.

[31-Jan-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> then 1 of those 3 tries to go back to the other 7 and have his new entries validated and the 7 to replace their entires with his new ones from the group of 3

[31-Jan-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> not going to happen because the 7 already had consensus on their entries made while he was away

[31-Jan-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @papacheal check out gui channel buddy

[31-Jan-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> so if he wants to keep a valid book within that group of 7, he would need to remove the entries the 3 made and update that section of where he was away with entries from the 7

[31-Jan-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <papacheal> @GlorymanRTS My bad...didn't scroll back far enough past your accounting discussion. 😃

[31-Jan-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Now, add one more layer

[31-Jan-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook yeah bro I understand more ledgers with the same entries is a different fork from other ledgers with a different entries.

[31-Jan-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> they aren't just entering data

[31-Jan-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @papacheal np buddy. I hope it solved your problem

[31-Jan-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> back to the 10, they are exchanging money and keeping record

[31-Jan-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> ok i get that

[31-Jan-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> everyone agrees to keep a duplicate ledger of all transactions that occur in the group in order

[31-Jan-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> listening to the extra layer part now

[31-Jan-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> yeah i get that

[31-Jan-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> person 1 gives 5 tokens to person 2 and everyone updates their copy of the ledger with that transaction

[31-Jan-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> this goes on for a while

[31-Jan-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> now the 3 leave the room

[31-Jan-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> 5 plus 5 plus 5 right

[31-Jan-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> in a different room they exchange tokens

[31-Jan-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> who exchanges the tokens?

[31-Jan-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> the 3

[31-Jan-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> the 3

[31-Jan-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> 😃

[31-Jan-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> lol, ok

[31-Jan-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> they make record of it in the same ledgers they took with them from the first room

[31-Jan-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> 3 and the 7?

[31-Jan-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> 10

[31-Jan-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> 😂

[31-Jan-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> yeah i follow

[31-Jan-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> the 7 guys in the first room know nothing of these transactions and in the mean time are also making exchanges and recording them

[31-Jan-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @stretcher83 RIDDLE SOLVED

[31-Jan-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> 👍🏼😎

[31-Jan-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> 😁

[31-Jan-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Sorry

[31-Jan-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> let's say, for simplification, while the 3 are away 3 thransactions are made by them in their little room.  and by luck 3 transactions are made in the group of 7.

[31-Jan-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Just following along , nice explanation john 👍🏼

[31-Jan-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> so they get an eraser and say dont worry you can be on the same group of leaders (JK) 😂

[31-Jan-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> if any one or all of the 3 return to the first room, their copies of ledgers will only match each other (the 3), but not the 7

[31-Jan-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> the 7 say, if you want to stay and enter in your book the rule is that everyone's ledger must match before we move on to the next entry

[31-Jan-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So they either need stay out of the room or erase the 3 transaction entries they made while away and replace them with the 3 made by the 7 during that time, then they can join the group again and keep going

[31-Jan-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> That's why we have words like consensus or rules etc

[31-Jan-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> or even algorithm

[31-Jan-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> So person A 5 to person B, Person B 5 to Person C, in the group of 3. if the 7 show Person B 5 to Person C. It wont count because they didn't have the first transaction person A5 to person B, right?

[31-Jan-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> but they could delete the A5 to person B and they will be let back in

[31-Jan-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> So it all matches?

[31-Jan-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> except that in the room of 7 they won't know about the transaction of Person B to Person C, because it occurred in the other room.

[31-Jan-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So they'd have to delete any and all entries made while away from the room of 7

[31-Jan-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> if no entries were made, (they were offline), then it's a moot point

[31-Jan-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> they just have to add the entries they missed while away

[31-Jan-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> maybe they had to use the restroom

[31-Jan-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> no harm done

[31-Jan-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> hopefully
