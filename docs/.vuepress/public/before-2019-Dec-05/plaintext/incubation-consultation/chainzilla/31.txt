[Cabey#3299] @TLMTroublemaker do you mean the faucet or?

[21-Jul-18 12:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[st3rling0x#1568] Welcome everyone new ðŸ‘‹

[21-Jul-18 12:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] How many members are there now? The channel has grown rapidly

[21-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] i think 471 now

[21-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] Nice!

[21-Jul-18 12:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] That's correct. We also have 1.9 followers in LinkedIn, and another 400 on Twitter

[21-Jul-18 12:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] The goal is to have 10K by the ICO

[21-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Link me the linkedin

[21-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Iâ€™ll give it a follow ðŸ˜ƒ

[21-Jul-18 01:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] https://www.linkedin.com/company/chainzilla

[21-Jul-18 01:19 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] It's only 9 followers (including me). Not 1.9k

[21-Jul-18 01:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] i noticed the same. @PTYX ?

[21-Jul-18 01:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] https://www.linkedin.com/in/blockchainasaservice/

[21-Jul-18 01:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] that's what we are using for posts.

[21-Jul-18 01:32 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] why multiple profiles. just adds unnecessary confusion

[21-Jul-18 01:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Invite request sent ðŸ˜ƒ

[21-Jul-18 01:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] And followed

[21-Jul-18 01:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] But that's your personal profil. I would to post on the official Zilla profil

[21-Jul-18 01:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] The account serves a purpose. Which is to promote ChainZilla. The company account will be built up but I don't see it as a priority given that anything that is published can be disseminated through that account.

[21-Jul-18 01:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It seems pointless to spend another 2 months building up the company account when we can do both things.

[21-Jul-18 01:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] https://www.linkedin.com/in/blockchainasaservice/ is your personal profile. i don't get why not do all stuff from company profile

[21-Jul-18 01:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] like i said. unnecessary layer of possible confusion

[21-Jul-18 01:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] I would post on both then. Should be not much more of an effort. This builts up company account seamlessly meanwhile. I think company account on LinkedIn is important for start of ico

[21-Jul-18 01:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Tbh personal accounts are often bigger than company accounts

[21-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] thanks for the suggestions.

[21-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] https://www.linkedin.com/company/chainzilla looks as the most obvious official ChainZilla profile

[21-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] Ask everyone in here to follow. Maybe for 0.5 Zilla :). It's a good starting point to gain followers

[21-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] not worth it ðŸ˜„

[21-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] we went from 153 followers to 1900 without paying anyone to follow us

[21-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] after we started our marketing campaign.

[21-Jul-18 01:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] Do not underestimate the power of LinkedIn. Reach for crypto n Blockchain related topics and people is big in my opinion

[21-Jul-18 01:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] Well, then just start also posting on comp profile. It will built up itself

[miles#6381] Anyone know of a good independent NEM overview / intro article as  donâ€™t know much about it at the mo?

[crumb#2550] upvoted

[21-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] @st3rling0x in the medium article, second paragraph:
However, most startups are unaware that there are better projects that offer simpler tokenization and rubust infrastructure. 
it should say robust infrastructure

[21-Jul-18 03:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] also later in the article:
There are some advantages of launching a token on NEM. The platform uses a a consensug algorithm known as PoI or proof-of-importance. NEM is environmentally friendly, and very secure. Some of the features included are encrypted messaging
it should say: The platform uses consensus algorithm

[21-Jul-18 03:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @crumb can you post this in the marketing channel?

[Cryptoon#3362] Will try with barter

[21-Jul-18 04:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] to run a MM usually you need command line

[21-Jul-18 04:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] better wait until we have the user friendly MM dashboard

[21-Jul-18 04:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Ah I thought you wanted me to buy from your mm

[21-Jul-18 04:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
