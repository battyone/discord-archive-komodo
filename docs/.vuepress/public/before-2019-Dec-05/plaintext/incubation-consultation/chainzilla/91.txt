[dscrd-cz] <miles> Good stuff - what version of Agama are you using ?

[02-Aug-19 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> Version 0.5.7-4-Tech-Preview-02 (0.5.7-4)

[02-Aug-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <miles> Is that the Verus Agama?

[02-Aug-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> Yes, I downloaded from Verus site

[02-Aug-19 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <miles> Did you use old KMD Agama with that address?

[02-Aug-19 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <miles> As if so you should read up on the back and create a new address in Verus Agama and move your funds there to be sure

[02-Aug-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <miles> Also - make sure all your addresses and seeds are written down in triplicate somewhere for that rainy day!!! üòÄ

[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> Thank you for your advice

[02-Aug-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <miles> Welcome

[02-Aug-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> I will figure that out, creating new wallet address & moving my stuff there

[02-Aug-19 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> you made my day ‚úå

[02-Aug-19 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <miles> Nothing worse than seeing an empty wallet, nothing better than realising it‚Äôs ok!! Have a good one

Chameleon wallet is giving  Error unsupported protocol version: 1.2    It also will not claim rewards,    Error Not enough money to create transaction.   I did update the wallet, but the errors remain.  IOS version 3.0

[12-Aug-19 02:04 AM] PTYX#6840
@NNoperator ok thank you for pointing it out. we'll try to replicate on iOS. i've tested android and it's working.

[12-Aug-19 02:20 AM] FtrSaroth#2069
Hi! This is weird because i been having the same problem but on android

Tried to share a screenshot but no permission

[12-Aug-19 02:22 AM] PTYX#6840
that's strange, are you having issues sending or only claming?

[12-Aug-19 02:23 AM] PTYX#6840
i made this tx a bit ago 10fe31d377ac2d2c9ab8538aa722a300a83a9f4c91572453a06b2f9d2fdd7965

[12-Aug-19 02:50 AM] FtrSaroth#2069
When open the wallet show that message, tried to claim and seems to go normally, but after the claim when return to the first screen show that message again ü§î

[12-Aug-19 02:57 AM] FtrSaroth#2069
When enter to see the details of any tx and then return to the principal screen shows that message

[12-Aug-19 03:00 AM] PTYX#6840
OK, I've made a report and our QA will try to replicate. I'll have an update tomorrow.

Thank you for your assistance and tips on getting Chameleon happy PTYX.  It seems it may have just been my connection.  Switching from wifi to LTE cellular connection seems to make the error message go away.  Will claim reward later today to double check.

[16-Sep-19 04:07 PM] dan.#2473
what is the utility of zilla coin?

[16-Sep-19 04:13 PM] dan.#2473
@PTYX

[16-Sep-19 04:14 PM] PTYX#6840
@dan. we're creating more uses for the zilla coin but currently you can use it to receive lower rates for buying giftcards, the way it works is that if your wallet holds more than 500 zilla you get lower rates.

[16-Sep-19 04:14 PM] PTYX#6840
we are doing the same thing for our otc exchange called Moneyx which is in the process of launching

[16-Sep-19 04:14 PM] dan.#2473
oooh. i have like ~250 somehow, lol. How much of a discount

[16-Sep-19 04:15 PM] PTYX#6840
besides that, we're working on ad revenue paid in zilla

[16-Sep-19 04:15 PM] PTYX#6840
it's small discount, it's a little less than 1% of the cost which is basically our revenue for the purchase of a giftcard.

[16-Sep-19 04:16 PM] dan.#2473
gotcha.

[16-Sep-19 04:16 PM] dan.#2473
kyc?

[16-Sep-19 04:16 PM] PTYX#6840
nope

[16-Sep-19 04:16 PM] PTYX#6840
for the OTC desk there will be, for our in-app purchases there isn't

[16-Sep-19 04:16 PM] dan.#2473
coo. right on

[16-Sep-19 04:17 PM] PTYX#6840
oh, we also implemented a 5% fee for staking using Chameleon which is reduced to 2% for holding 500 or more zilla.

[16-Sep-19 04:17 PM] PTYX#6840
that will be valid for KMD, Dune, and Tezos staking.

[20-Sep-19 10:53 PM] PTYX#6840
@phideas we pushed an update, if you can check on your device and let us know if the crash you reported was fixed. Thank you.

[21-Sep-19 11:21 AM] phideas#8309
@PTYX latest update installed today. I can confirm the back button bug got fixed. Noticed few minor issues. 
- Pop up window shows up pretty often saying "Error failed to connect to electrum server"
- Main buttons haptic feedback is overkill, plz make it like all other buttons. Decent audio pop in normal mode, and silent when phone in silent or dnd mode.

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Which coins do you have activated?
