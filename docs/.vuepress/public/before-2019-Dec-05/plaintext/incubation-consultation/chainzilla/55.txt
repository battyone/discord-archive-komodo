[14-Oct-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Only chrome?

[14-Oct-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Not Firefox?

[14-Oct-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> right now it's availble on chrome.

[14-Oct-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <javadth> is it safe ?

[14-Oct-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Guarda has a good team

[14-Oct-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> have i had someone check the code, not yet

[14-Oct-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> would i trust it with more than 100 KMD, no. I wouldn't trust any online wallet with more than 100KMD.

[14-Oct-18 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> however, i do have less than 100KMD in various online wallets because you do have to spend it every now and then. it's convenient. With the chrome extension you generate a seed so I assume if your browser is not compromised you should be ok.

[14-Oct-18 09:47 PM] SHossain#0007
@PTYX did you find out why their Android wallets been removed from Google Play Store?

[14-Oct-18 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> yes, it was related to another application they developed - a game. it got banned and they subsequently banned all their apps.

[14-Oct-18 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> from what i understand, they were planning on getting rid of the standalone apps anyway and were releasing a multiwallet

[14-Oct-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> which i guess is what they did now with the chrome extension and their new web wallet.

[dscrd-cz] <figgy132> I like the site, so easy on the eyes! One thing I noticed is the message you get once you subscribe to the newsletter - 'Thank you for Subscribing our update.' - might be missing the word 'to' or the words 'our update' are surplus :)

[15-Oct-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Hungry_BullBear are you referring to the dICO app?

[15-Oct-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> yes

[15-Oct-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @twittler It's gonna be in January

[15-Oct-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Thanks @figgy132 There are some changes that we'll be making in these next days üôÇ

[15-Oct-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The dICO app was used by Utrum to carry out an atomic-swap powered decentralized ICO

[15-Oct-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> however, the app needs some improvements along with marketmaker

[15-Oct-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> our plan was to develop an improved version of the dico app to offer an easy to use dICO app for our clients. Not only for KICs but for ETH assets, Nem assets, and any other coin you can trade on BarterDEX protocol

[15-Oct-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The advantages of a dICO is that you are fulfilling the orders atomically. There is no trust involved which is gamechanging for ICOs. Contributors usually have to trust that the ICO issuer will pay the tokens.

[15-Oct-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> sounds really useful

[15-Oct-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> definitely. The more tools we have out our disposal the more things we can offer our clients.

[15-Oct-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> The animations started getting delayed when i scrolled down, about when i got to "developers". Looks great though.

[15-Oct-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> What are the tokens used for? Buying zilla products? I understand the use case, but confused about the purpose of the token it's self

[15-Oct-18 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> the token will server many purposes. one of them is spending them for our services at a discount

[15-Oct-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> however, we plan on activating cryptoconditions next year and we want to implement voting functions, airdrops, and other reward mechanisms

[15-Oct-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> when our apps are finished we might allow advertising through the apps which will pay the users in ZILLA.

[15-Oct-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Projects that launch through ChainZilla might want to reward the Zilla community with direct airdrops. We will try to keep the zilla token as relevant as possible in terms of use-cases

[15-Oct-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <pdtm> a lot of Work but well done so far üëç

[15-Oct-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Oct-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
