[crumb#2550] please only post your address when minidrop has been activated

[16-Jul-18 10:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] it's getting really annoying

[16-Jul-18 10:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Lil komodo#3487] Maybe a dedicated airdrop channel? ðŸ˜®

[16-Jul-18 10:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] naah

[16-Jul-18 10:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] not necessary

[16-Jul-18 10:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] special channel would become a spamfest

[16-Jul-18 10:39 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] once in a while we old timers just need to point this out to new people

[16-Jul-18 10:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] heh, it feels kinda weird to call myself an old timer, but this community has grown fast

[16-Jul-18 10:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Buddz1993#5380] I posted in because I wanted to copy it to have it in my phone

[16-Jul-18 10:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Buddz1993#5380] Itâ€™s done now

[16-Jul-18 10:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] You could use email for that

[16-Jul-18 10:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Buddz1993#5380] Yea but I did it this way thereâ€™s no looking back now ðŸ˜ƒ

[16-Jul-18 10:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] That's true :-)

[16-Jul-18 10:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] and there is also a possibility to delete accidental post. i encourage people to use it ðŸ˜ƒ

[16-Jul-18 11:44 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] @cheeweon  The coin is used for various processes on ChainZilla including paying for it's services. The Zilla chain will serve multiple purposes including
as a second layer of dPoW, KV storage, voting, and as a currency medium to
pay for ChainZilla services.

[PTYX#6840] There is no airdrops today ðŸ˜€ we are testing the bot.

[Cryptoon#3362] What if

[16-Jul-18 12:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] This is reverse psychology

[16-Jul-18 12:20 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] It's the right thing to do!

[16-Jul-18 12:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] You get free aidrops, share it with the people so your airdropped coins are worth more ðŸ˜ƒ

[16-Jul-18 01:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] I am interested in selling 235 Zilla, if someone is interested you can tell me your offer. Thank you

[16-Jul-18 01:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] I'll give you 5KMD, you send first.

[16-Jul-18 01:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] Where did u get 235 zilla is my question

[16-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] @Robert Naus  bot

[16-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] http://explorer.chainzilla.io/address/RFQRQrhMC9XqfQGhfAnzMMLw9wDXF9KF8i

[16-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Ah a bot abusing the faucet ðŸ˜ƒ

[16-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] http://explorer.chainzilla.io/tx/a08aeee21444267a90d047f45f0135077d72f2f52448f24df2cbcd347f2d5af0

[16-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] @PTYX fyi

[16-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Not sure how one can prevent a faucet being abused like that though.

[16-Jul-18 01:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] And this is why real people like myself can't even get 0.1 Zilla from the faucet because it's constantly saying it's down...damn bots. I've tried the faucet every day and it only worked twice!

[16-Jul-18 01:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] It works every day for me

[16-Jul-18 01:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] I have not used any bot, do not accuse me without proof

[16-Jul-18 01:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] You could answer Robert's question then

[16-Jul-18 01:55 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] @castle32 explain this transaction then: http://explorer.chainzilla.io/tx/a08aeee21444267a90d047f45f0135077d72f2f52448f24df2cbcd347f2d5af0

[16-Jul-18 01:55 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] I do not have to give explanations about the exchange of cryptocurrency or the addresses that I have and have used manually.

[16-Jul-18 01:55 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] All these payments were made in one block

[16-Jul-18 01:55 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] so in one transaction

[16-Jul-18 01:55 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Good luck being able to do that manually

[16-Jul-18 01:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] The boy worked for $ 82.25

[16-Jul-18 01:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] 235 zilla x 0.35$ (ico price)  :D:D:D

[16-Jul-18 01:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] If they have been done that way they have been to save commissions the sellers with whom I have negotiated. Those who do use bots and nobody says anything are the ones who put the address in the airdrops.

[16-Jul-18 01:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] ðŸ˜„

[16-Jul-18 01:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] ICO price 0.45$ ...

[16-Jul-18 01:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] i see 35

[16-Jul-18 01:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] I'll pay 5kmd

[16-Jul-18 01:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] komodo over 1dollar

[16-Jul-18 01:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] buhahahaha

[16-Jul-18 01:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] go home boy

[16-Jul-18 01:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] 4kmd

[16-Jul-18 01:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] I'll pay 30KMD for your 200Zilla

[16-Jul-18 02:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] I'll sell you 0 Zilla Cryptoon , get them with your bot, since you're so smart

[16-Jul-18 02:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] I am very smart, thanks

[16-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] and on the developer's site, I would block this address and return funds for the faucet

[16-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] Was there any zilla paid out for chainzilla related services yet? I see no other way to have some beside being on team.

[16-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] As I said

[16-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] greed is a very bad human quality

[16-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] http://explorer.chainzilla.io/tx/a08aeee21444267a90d047f45f0135077d72f2f52448f24df2cbcd347f2d5af0

[16-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] look at this transaction to his address

[16-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] 30KMD for 100Zilla. Deal?

[16-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] It's all transactions of 0,1 zilla

[16-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] So he's just exploiting the faucet

[16-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] yup

[16-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @Unknown greed is fine,it fuels progress and innovation but theft and fraud not.

[16-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Anyway, I wouldn't buy them just so we don't support this kind of behavior

[16-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] block address

[16-Jul-18 02:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Nah dont block address, that would be blockchain censorship, which I also don't like

[16-Jul-18 02:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @Cryptoon are u saying he is able to basically steal fractions of zilla somehow?

[16-Jul-18 02:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] The censors of cryptocurrency, the immutability of transactions and decentralization you leave it at home

[16-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] @Robert Naus just create 100s of adresses, claim 0,1KMD with each of the adresses with the faucet
