[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> OK ... why that business needs its own token ?

[26-Oct-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> It is basically a site  for ratings ?

[26-Oct-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Utrum? If I'm not mistaken they have a revenue/reward system through Oot. I don't know any in depth details though.

[26-Oct-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> They have their own channel and community as well.

[26-Oct-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We want to be added to their rating system when it's live.

[26-Oct-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> They are in the process of creating a new wallet so their users can access those unique features. Here is their discord https://discord.gg/wvN7T8

[dscrd-cz] <st3rling0x> i read Utrum is working on HODL button for their wallet and staking

[26-Oct-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I like how it's looking. Clean and lightweight

[26-Oct-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> The original wallet was designed by Monaize, but it's undergoing a redesign process.

[26-Oct-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> ü§î I haven't heard of Monaize in a while

[26-Oct-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Emmanuel I there any estimation on when the rating platform will go online for testing? I know you're more plugged in over at Utrum.

[26-Oct-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Monaize is on hold, i think, last i heard they were trying to get more funds to resume development.

[26-Oct-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Utrum's platform next year, Q1.

[26-Oct-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> I hope to release some micro-services in the meantime, just like this hodl feature, but no promises.

[26-Oct-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> BTW when are the airdrops paid ?

[26-Oct-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> At the end of the airdrop which is about 28 days. The airdrop could end sooner if spots are filled. We have to do a manual check for all airdrops to make sure we aren't giving away to bots

[28-Oct-18 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> I am not trying to be a dick - sincere question - What is the ground to call Chainzilla 4th gen ?

[28-Oct-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> NXT: 1st Gen, ETH: 2nd, KMD: 3rd, Chainzilla: 4th.

[28-Oct-18 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <BlockTech> So basically 4th gen of blockchain is using  second and third generation and adding services/GUI ? (User friendly).

[28-Oct-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> That's correct. In our opinion it is a combination of all previous technologies with a focus on experience, design, and security. In preparation for the increase in blockchain adoption our consultancy and development services bridge the gap between the open source communities and traditional businesses - allowing them to onboard, build fast, and maintain the system efficiently.

[28-Oct-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Hungry_BullBear ill have an infographic made to explain that. I've heard that question a few times already so it makes sense to explain it.

[28-Oct-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Great -  looking forward to it

[28-Oct-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> It is good if u can quickly lay out in the info graphic what defines 1st gen as first gen , second as second and so on

[28-Oct-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Sure that's possible
