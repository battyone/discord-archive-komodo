[dscrd-cz] <miles> btw @PTYX - did you see the guy who was doing the 51% attack on EMC2 reverted on twitter because he wasn't sure he could pull it off with the KMD DPoW in place?

[12-Oct-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> oh really?

[12-Oct-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763

@unbankd_co Just found out EMC2 uses @KomodoPlatform, still going to attack them later in the stream but it might not work (will be fun to test) so i'm switching the main event to a bigger coin (to be announced).
Twitter

[12-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <miles> didn't say he wasn't gonna try, but wouldn't do as main event !

[12-Oct-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Interesting. Did he give a date for the event?

[12-Oct-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I can't see it in his post

[12-Oct-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I tried to reach out to einstenium to tell them to raise the confirmation limit on any exchange where it can be spent.

[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @Hungry_BullBear What things you don't like about Agama?

[12-Oct-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> it is super slow to sync in - dont like the design as well , dont like the color choice , dont like it is 4 wallets in one separated in a strange "load up" way

[12-Oct-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> @Hungry_BullBear you do understand that when you use native mode you need to download the respective blockchain and that will take time no matter which wallet you'll use

[12-Oct-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> if you want faster experience use SPV (light) mode

[12-Oct-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Yes I get that

[12-Oct-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> with respect to visual side i don't mind the current Agama, but think that Zilla wallet is way cooler

[12-Oct-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Still , I am allowed to think that is slow ... or am I not ?

[12-Oct-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Is there are a zilla wallet out ?

[12-Oct-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> just previews of visual have been out

[12-Oct-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> our wallet is called Chameleon and it will be realeased toward the end of the year.

[12-Oct-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> we started re-desigining agama a few months back

[13-Oct-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> About 10 days ago, Einstenium implemented Komodo's DPoW, let's see what happens üëÄ

[13-Oct-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I am sure Komodo has a line of communication with Einsteinium and asked them to raise the confirmation limit on any exchange where its spend able. If that's the case, then the chance of a double spend is difficult

[13-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I haven't had time to look too deep into it but that would be the best plan of action.

[13-Oct-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Another scenario is that EC2 is prepared and has hashrate just waiting to be activated in case of an attack

[13-Oct-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Which is what I would do. Fight the hashrate with more hashrate.

[13-Oct-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> And a third scenario EMC2 just blows up üòÇ
