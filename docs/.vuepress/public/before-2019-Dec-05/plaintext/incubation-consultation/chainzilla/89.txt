[dscrd-cz] <Cryptoon> Good luck raising capital guys! Having raised capital myself for a couple projects in different rounds I know how hard it can be, but I also know there is a LOT of money waiting to be invested in solid projects!

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Feel free to test and leave us feedback. We're still polishing the interface before we add advanced features.
Feedback can be sent to hello@chainzilla.io

[23-Feb-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <roomba> Just tested the app, awesome! The flowers and animals were funny. I can't imagine any way to make it better other than the news feed images. Good job guys.

[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Do you plan to create a desktop version for Chameleon?

[23-Feb-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Umaru> Chameleon give private key for each coin?

[23-Feb-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @rainbro7 the newsletter is coming, those images are placeholders. We are going to feed directly from our blog into that section. Thank you for the feedback

[23-Feb-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Umaru it gives you a seed that you can use to restore your funds. You va use the seed to export your privkey. We will add privatekey export in the future.

[23-Feb-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @stock999 yes, however, we didn't raise barely any funds. So we scratched all plans of making more apps. The priority is to polish Chameleon, integrate the purchase, Fiat, and exchange features so that we can monetize it.

[23-Feb-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @rainbro7 that's considered an advanced feature which will be available in the next or upcoming release.

[dscrd-cz] <Smedley> Is the chameleon wallet available for ios in the United States?

[24-Feb-19 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Yes, but ios will be available Monday or Tuesday. We had delays with the preview screens. We had to find various devices to screenshot. So Android got approved first as usual

[24-Feb-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> but good for them. I read a little about fetch.ai and I didn't really grasp what they are doing. ```Open Economic Framework

The digital world in which agents live is called the Open Economic Framework (OEF). This world acts as the ultimate value exchange dating agency: each agent sees a space optimised in real-time just for them, where important things are clear and visible and less important things are simply removed. ```

[dscrd-cz] <roomba> PTYX why are there so many wallet companies? Guarda, pungo, agama, magnum. You guys are all part of komodo in some way, is this some type of divide and concur strat?

[27-Feb-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @rainbro7 each service has their own wallet with its own purpose. Guarda and Magnum are third party wallet providers. We created Chameleon because we wanted to offer our clients an easy to use wallet with more functionality than coinomi.

[27-Feb-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Pungo has a whole ecosystem of products including a debit card, exchange, and escrow system. So they created a version of Agama to suite their needs. It might seem like the wallets are competing with one another but they complement the ecosystem.

[dscrd-cz] <RNI> that magnum wallet notification tool is awesome. any chance that this tool will be implemented in chameleon or agama too?

[07-Mar-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Actually, it works with any address üòÑ

[07-Mar-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> so you can use it for a chameleon address. We have talked to magnum about our own bot but it's not a priority as of right now

[07-Mar-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <RNI> yes but you have to use magnum wallet. i didn't try that one out yet.

[07-Mar-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <RNI> i'm using agama desktop and chameleon mobile for now.

[07-Mar-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> you can use the magnum notifier bot with an agama address as far as i know

[07-Mar-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <RNI> ok thanks! i will try it out.

[07-Mar-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We are planning on adding notifications as well but in-app and possibly telegram too. For the next 3 months we are focusing on polishing the graphical interface, adding some of the missing pieces in Chameleon, and add new coins. We are getting requests from several communities and have sealed a few deals already. So we are happy about that üòÑ

[07-Mar-19 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
