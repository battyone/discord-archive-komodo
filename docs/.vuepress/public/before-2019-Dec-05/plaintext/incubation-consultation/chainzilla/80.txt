there is several thousand ZILLA in sprout zaddr, please convert this to taddr or sapling ASAP

[16-Dec-18 10:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] If we hold Zilla in Lite mode do we have to do this ‚òùÔ∏è?

[16-Dec-18 10:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] Sapling effects coins held in native mode only I thought.

[16-Dec-18 10:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If your funds are in Transparent addresses you don't need to worry about it.

[16-Dec-18 10:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] lite mode only supports transparent addresses for now so you should be fine.

If you have KMD on a ledger or in Agama lite, then you do not have a Z address and you don't need to move them.

[Instel7#1416] Thanks @Hungry_BullBear, I was about to tag you as I know you like polls haha üòâ

[17-Dec-18 08:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] I voted. Real Estate is gona be big one - The key is making blockchain super mega easy to use .

[17-Dec-18 08:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] We need massive improvements in the GUI and interaction overall with blockchains

[17-Dec-18 08:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] Wallets need to be super fast - mega easy to use . Intuitive and with maximum functionality

[17-Dec-18 08:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] so regular people have little to non learning curve

[17-Dec-18 08:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] The tech needs to be invisible to the regular user

[17-Dec-18 08:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[17-Dec-18 08:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] i was interested in BERRY a while ago and was even planning on working on something similar

[17-Dec-18 08:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] but Chainzilla took priority. It's still something I'm interested in developing though.

[17-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I think it would be ideal for Chainzilla to partner with real estate projects or even incubate one in the future.

[17-Dec-18 08:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] Yes - there are many industries and businesses where blockchain can and is logical to be used ( not only using it for the sake of being trendy )

[17-Dec-18 08:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] The key is making the adoption ridiculously easy

[17-Dec-18 08:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] Right now it is a nightmare to be in crypto - everything is hard , learning curve is steep and that makes real world use case achievement impossible

[17-Dec-18 08:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] Also vast majority of devs are cocky and intentionally snobbish and not helpful - they dont like to explain and feel "satisfaction in knowing things u dont know "

[17-Dec-18 08:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Yeah, it's a long road ahead

[17-Dec-18 08:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] As long as that attitude is prevalent and teams are not tamed by market and social relation people adoption will be a pipe dream

[17-Dec-18 08:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] we are at least 10 year away from real mass adoption

[17-Dec-18 08:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I would say around 5-10 year to see the landscape change completely

[17-Dec-18 08:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] of course - it will be gradual .. I dont expect day into day super change üòÑ

[PTYX#6840] That's why I'm so adamant about building a solid company now. While everyone is squabbling is the best time to build.

[Hungry_BullBear#1487] I like the crypto puzzle icon üòÑ my brain exploded on the first one  - had not tried since than

[17-Dec-18 08:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] @PTYX U are doing foundational work - if u have the guts and stamina to keep going the pay off will be big

[17-Dec-18 08:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I believe you are correct.

[17-Dec-18 11:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NWhiskeyTango#5590] Equalizer does real estate, which also derived from KMD

[18-Dec-18 12:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[stock999#4818] I think that real estate will face on a very strong resistance . Just imagine a huge army of lawyers, notaries, other  bureaucrates etc. , those will lose a job if real estate operations would be handled by smart contracts. All of them  will fight  against blockchain for survive. So, it is a very far future.

[18-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] The poll is for 2019, cryptocurrency is the best answer for the poll because everything else will take a lot longer for adoption. All fields mentioned will use blockchain in the future no matter how hard people fight it.

[18-Dec-18 01:27 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] it sounds about right - it should coalesce with the next big financial crysis/depression that will facilitate the move to cryptocurrencies .

[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> Check your address here. https://www.dexstats.info/assetviewer.php if the funds are still there you still own them and it's a matter of figuring out your pin

[dscrd-cz] <jony> dude look at me after i cant input my pin i try to recover with my first pashphrase but why my address is different from existing in the first time i make wallet on the pungo app, that why my balance gone

[30-Dec-18 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> Ok I've seen something like this before. It's possible that the first time you didn't copy the entire passphrase. I had to try my passphrase minus a letter and just kept trying with less and less letters until I got it. Might work for you

[30-Dec-18 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> @jspook16 its ok if the address its not changed with the same passphrase , but its another address with same passphrase

[30-Dec-18 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> its really annoying when i use another wallet such as imtoken when i import the passphrase i will found my balance with existing address

[30-Dec-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> with the same address with the same amount but not with pungo

[30-Dec-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> I personally use agama mobile (Android) and agama desktop (linux). If you can get to your balance on imtoken (I'm not familiar with that wallet) then I would send it from imtoken to a new wallet that you know the passphrase for sure.

[30-Dec-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> @jspook16 no dude imtoken is erc20 and eth wallet. i just comparing imtoken and pungo

[30-Dec-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> Oh gotcha. We'll try what I told you earlier. Try all of you passphrase except the last letter and then repeat, each time removing a letter until you get your original address
