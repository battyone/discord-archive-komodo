[13-Mar-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> I found an offer about $80-85 on a local market. Seems it's too low, so i suspect it could be not original(or used). That's why i asked.

[13-Mar-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @stock999 yeah you can buy used ones and you will be able to check if the software is original. If you use a used ledger (which I have) make sure you geneeate a new seed. Don't use a seed given to you

[dscrd-cz] <stock999> @groundhog @PTYX  These guys claim that they are an official Ledger dealer, i.e. the product is original.  But i have not found them in the  retailers list on Ledger site.  And i think that all official dealers should have the price  more or less the same, may be 1%-2% less as a discount, but  a discount 15%-20%  is too much.

[16-Mar-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @stock999 definitely I agree. The ledger Nano is 69$ plus shipping. So it's not that expensive to order directly from ledger

[dscrd-cz] <miles> @lokinindi18  -  are you aware of the  Agama hack in June and the way the team swept the majority of coins to safety?

[02-Aug-19 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <miles> The Komodo server is the place to ask https://discord.gg/AUmb7W

[02-Aug-19 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> Thanks miles, No, I was not aware ... I was away from crypto for extended period

[02-Aug-19 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> I will check on that forum

[02-Aug-19 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <miles> There are a number of pinned messages in the general channel and on the Komodo website - don‚Äôt panic and go slow - most likely your coins are safe

[02-Aug-19 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> Thanks again

[02-Aug-19 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <miles> There is a cool process to follow to reclaim them

[02-Aug-19 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> Thanks buddy, Appreciate your help

[02-Aug-19 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <miles> Most importantly - don‚Äôt rush, take you time and work through it

[02-Aug-19 11:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <miles> You are welcome - I was there too, it‚Äôs amazing what KMD did to protect they community - is it just KMD you are missing?

[02-Aug-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> Yes

[02-Aug-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> I noticed something weird now

[02-Aug-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> when I initially transferred KMD's from binance it was transferred to a different Agama KMD address

[02-Aug-19 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> not when I login it shows me a different KMD address

[02-Aug-19 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> when I looked at https://kmdexplorer.io/address/RF5N5pfAZ6rVahQ1YJ3hLjFEi2FbijEqvM

[02-Aug-19 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> it shows all my transactions

[02-Aug-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> but the wrong id in Agama shows none: https://kmdexplorer.io/address/RGfv6z5XYYKjb5aS72sbYAuc7YVJfU7zgd

[02-Aug-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> donno what I'm missing here

[02-Aug-19 11:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <miles> Have you got the keys to that first address you transferred your KMD to from Binance?

[02-Aug-19 11:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> I have Wallet Seed

[02-Aug-19 11:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <miles> So log into Agama with that seed - you should see what is on the block explorer

[02-Aug-19 11:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> Oh

[02-Aug-19 11:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> you are the man

[02-Aug-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> I'm newbie here

[02-Aug-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> so was trying all the time with my saved password

[02-Aug-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> and all the time it was showing me incorrect balance (tied to incorrect KMD address)

[02-Aug-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> Thank you so much

[02-Aug-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <lokinindi18> I see all my balance now
