[31-Oct-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Their app accepts the traditional Fiat payments and Dash. The drivers get 90% if their fair and will have ability to vote on certain aspects of the company and its operations

[31-Oct-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Abee Foundation is focused on the whole sharing economy so expect also airbnb-style solutions from them in the future. We partnered with them to provide them consulting services and assist with the launch process in Latin American countries.
