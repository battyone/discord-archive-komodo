[djithbit#3171] The shit is ... it is all open source .. all can be copied

[16-Jul-18 09:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] The thing about that is, everything in life is technically open source and can be copied, but we still give much more weight to the things that are done by professionals because they can fix things when they break, know the ins and outs, and have the knowledge to apply the right tools where they belong

[16-Jul-18 09:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] obviously we have copyrights, but i'm talking about services

[16-Jul-18 09:23 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] anyone can copy techniques that consultants use. or copy techniques that carpenters, mechanics, artists, or anything, but having the blue prints isn't enough.

[16-Jul-18 09:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] 1st mover advantage is the key

[16-Jul-18 09:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] Blockchain as a Service is about the people who intimately know the chains, and process, and know the code, providing not just the code as a product, but their expertise as a service. that is valuable

[16-Jul-18 09:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We are looking at protecting our process and some of our tech like the closed source ico website.

[16-Jul-18 09:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Aroc, the IP law firm is helping us with that

[16-Jul-18 09:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] At least in Latam because we do have first movers advantage in the region.

[16-Jul-18 09:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Speaking of which, We have a meeting tomorrow with NEMs Latam division. If we come to terms then we will become their first official provider.

[16-Jul-18 09:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Not_Sure#4240] Latam? as in Latin America?

[16-Jul-18 09:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Yes

[16-Jul-18 10:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[DaveArcher#1032] A pun in Spanish

[16-Jul-18 10:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[DaveArcher#1032] an 'INCA' coin has as it's smallest division the 'Picchu'

[16-Jul-18 10:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[DaveArcher#1032] so an INCA is worth "mucho Picchu"

[16-Jul-18 10:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[DaveArcher#1032] I said it was a pun...)P

[djithbit#3171] Cool to hear that things aren't so straightforward to be copied or stolen ... i fear chinese a lot..

[17-Jul-18 06:16 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] As they basically copied the world and even informed own population about the great chinese inventions.
Almost had to puke..

[17-Jul-18 09:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] It's not the code that has the most value

[17-Jul-18 09:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] It has some value

[17-Jul-18 09:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] But it's mostly the people implementing it that create value

[17-Jul-18 09:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] see for example SAFECOIN which basically just copy pasted KMD

[17-Jul-18 09:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] But in a very poor way

[17-Jul-18 09:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Their chain got attacked several times because they did not understand the code

[17-Jul-18 09:23 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] so even though kmd is open source, you need to know what you are doing

[17-Jul-18 09:23 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Good for them ðŸ˜‚

[17-Jul-18 09:23 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] You would need to study every aspect of the ecosystem for months/years to completely understand it the way @PTYX and team for example understand the ecosystem

[17-Jul-18 09:23 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] True.. i just learned how to operate a linux terminal.. sudo and get etc.. so many new things i learned..

[17-Jul-18 09:24 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] To start coding and be a dev .. i will need some reincarnations

[17-Jul-18 09:25 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] I read in kmd chat that jl777 was looking for an apprentice some time ago, but he required some understanding of C

[17-Jul-18 09:26 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] C++ looks interesting..

[17-Jul-18 09:27 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Im willing to learn it maybe.

Was thinking of doing webservice.. hosting websites on servers.
But surely that domain is far too competitive

[17-Jul-18 09:27 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] There is datacamp, I think they offer courses

[17-Jul-18 09:27 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Belgium located

[17-Jul-18 09:27 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Mostly for data science though, might not have C courses

[17-Jul-18 09:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

Never been there ðŸ˜‚

[17-Jul-18 09:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Zilla ico peice same as kmd? 0.1$

[17-Jul-18 10:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] 0,5 I think

[17-Jul-18 10:30 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] total ZILLA supply is going to be 11 million, so if we take the $0.5 price then initial 5.5 million marketcap would give us a lot of potential upside. compared to projects with hundreds of millions marketcap straight out of the gate

[17-Jul-18 10:30 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[blubbi#0643] 0,45$ in ICO

[17-Jul-18 10:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] so 4.5 million cap. even better ðŸ˜ƒ

[17-Jul-18 10:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[blubbi#0643] 0,35$ in private Pre-ICO

[17-Jul-18 10:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[blubbi#0643] 1MIll there

[17-Jul-18 10:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] 11 mio coins only? At 0.5$ ico? 
Ow man!!...

[17-Jul-18 10:32 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] ICO is going to be only 4 million. 11 is the total with multiple (two) rounds of airdrops
