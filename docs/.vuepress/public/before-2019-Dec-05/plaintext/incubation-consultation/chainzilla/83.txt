[18-Jan-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We know it's empty :D, it won't be filled up until after the ICO. It will remain up until we start the faucet campaigns again.

[18-Jan-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We thought about taking it down but since it's only temporary we just need to put a notice up

[18-Jan-19 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Yes, it would be a good solution to put a notice. Nobody will disturb you about faucet

[18-Jan-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> we will get that done asap

[18-Jan-19 01:51 AM] Gateway#3763

[18-Jan-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> There were some zilla deposited there for testing. It seems some people are trading them but it shouldn't affect the token sale as there is no volume.

[22-Jan-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Once we give the go ahead for trading then the volume should pick up and market prices will take over.

[dscrd-cz] <stock999> @Instel7  I still have a question: do you really need KYC for ICO even for those  want  pay by cryptocurrency, not by fiat?
But it has been discussed here a while ago. So i'm not sure if it's worth to ask again in AMA

[23-Jan-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @stock999 instel is off today. As for the KYC, it is enforced for all users during the contribution period.

[23-Jan-19 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It was a must for us to comply with current and possible future laws.

[23-Jan-19 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> @PTYX  Yes, i understand

[23-Jan-19 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> But probably  others also would be interested in this. Smb thinks that KYC is a right way to legalization, but smb else considers it as problem or an absolute evil. So, may be it would be better to include it in AMA in order to make it clear for all.  Up to you.

[23-Jan-19 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> i don't like kyc, but some people need it

[23-Jan-19 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> both realms must exist and inter-operate

[23-Jan-19 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> kyc and non-kyc

[23-Jan-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> @Emmanuel Agree. KYC has a right of existence only for those prefer to pay via bank,  by fiat money. But cryptocurrency must remain anonymous, i.e. no KYC.

[23-Jan-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Even buying from bank, kyc shouldn't be considered necessary.

[23-Jan-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> You don't send a selfie to amazon each time that you buy a book

[23-Jan-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Same should be for BTC or any other coin. It's a number that you are buying, nothing more.

[23-Jan-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> The sole reason for KYC existence, is governments being afraid of losing power.

[23-Jan-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> And I couldn't care less about that.

[23-Jan-19 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> The most interesting is that the KYC procedure doesn't resolve any problem. It just creates additional troubles for honest people those want a privacy only.

[23-Jan-19 11:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> But it doesn't work against scammers. Everyone can hide a real identity easily enough if he wants this.

[23-Jan-19 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> So it is just a useless action, useless expenses for lawyers.

[24-Jan-19 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> it is useful for governments - you give up your privacy, you give up your freedom

[24-Jan-19 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> door kickers released if you bad behavior

[24-Jan-19 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> a.k.a. "thinking by your own"

[24-Jan-19 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> All businesses do basic KYC when dealing with financial information though. Banks, lawyers, doctors, and even schools.

[24-Jan-19 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We also can't pretend like we shouldn't worry about money laundering or possibly transacting with unsavory individuals that you wouldn't transact in your daily. I do agree that KYC's get breached all the time and we are using the minimum information that we need to comply. However, I think a better approach is to think of better forms of KYC and anti money laundering that doesn't involve handing your information over to someone forever.

[24-Jan-19 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> `All businesses do basic KYC when dealing with financial information though. Banks, lawyers, doctors, and even schools.`
That's what cryptos are intended to fix.

[24-Jan-19 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> This society is completely messed up.

[24-Jan-19 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> what is kyc?

[24-Jan-19 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> basic KYC. it's your name and your address.

[24-Jan-19 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> how are you going to go to school? with a hash number?

[24-Jan-19 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> i mean sure we could, in a crypto or blockchain utopia

[24-Jan-19 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> but that isn't going to happen.

[24-Jan-19 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> and basic AML is making sure you aren't transacting with individuals on certain lists and accounts.

[24-Jan-19 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> back in the day, only your name was enough, not even id

[24-Jan-19 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> things worked fine

[24-Jan-19 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> it still works like that in many places

[24-Jan-19 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> There are pros and cons

[24-Jan-19 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I personally like to know who i'm transacting with.

[24-Jan-19 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> you like, but you don't need to know

[24-Jan-19 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> the reason why you "need" to know is govs.
