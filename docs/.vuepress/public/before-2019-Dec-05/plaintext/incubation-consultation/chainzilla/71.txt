[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> everyone checkout the ABEE app in action. It's a Dash and Fiat powered rideshare application. Drivers receive 90% of the share and have a ranking system that allows them to create a private base of clients and even vote on certain aspects of the application or company conduct. https://youtu.be/EQv7xQzGK-4

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Although most of us already knew that the financial system is just another system of control. But the point is that neutral payment systems are required now given that the US can cripple a country by stopping their bank movements.

Good for them.

[11-Nov-18 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> A cryptocurrency launched by any government could not be called  as a cryptocurrency indeed. Because it is centralized and most probably it would be not anonymous.

[11-Nov-18 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I don't know if that's 100% correct. I think you can have state owned cryptocurrency

[11-Nov-18 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Or state backed

[12-Nov-18 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <ch6ris> Yeah, that doesn't make much sense. Is ripple a cryptocurrency? Maybe ideologically, the term cryptocurrency refers to a requirment of being decentralized. Bitcoin is mostly centralized theses days. I think it's more to do with the math i.e cryptography.

[12-Nov-18 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <ch6ris> Define: Cryptocurrency - a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.

[12-Nov-18 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <ch6ris> Anonymity has nothing to do with the term cryptocurrency either. A state/government could indeed launch a cryptocurrency, controlled, centralized, KYC. Public, Private, doesn't matter.

[12-Nov-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <ch6ris> My 2 cents, and it will happen. Cashless society has been discussed long before bitcoin.

[dscrd-cz] <ch6ris> ^^^ One of the best/thought provoking article's I have ever read and I highly recommended it.

[12-Nov-18 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> State backed is ok if it supports atomic swaps.

[12-Nov-18 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> More fiat gateways is good.

[12-Nov-18 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <ch6ris> Yes more integrated into the current financial system will indeed stir the pot.

[12-Nov-18 01:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> @ch6ris i agree..also, not sure i support the whole state backed term just seems like a loophole word. My thoughts like this, most "backed" projects, companies, ect. have a board or some form of organization where the investors or "backers" have the ability for input and persuation..I prefer state accepted. Just my 2sats

[12-Nov-18 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> Like, "We accept visa, mastercard, america express or crypto."

[12-Nov-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> Most places prefer say visa over amex because of the fees, and over crypto because of the ease of use. Backing any one of these just seems like they have a stake in the company.

[12-Nov-18 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> Correct me if i am wrong, scrolled up and see where this convo originated, but doesn't the state of Iran try and own everything they touch. Sorry didnt read it, but i will

[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> I mean ya all are guilty to some extent, some more then others. People in the US complain about taxes. I feel most don't get the reasons behind taxes (or crypto fees). The abusers of such forced laws, taxes, fees, or monetary systems are the real guilty ones. I'm trying not be political here. I feel goverments should have zero stake in the monetary system. They are for law, order and state progression. Church, government and monetary systems need all be separated but accepted by each other to be as human as possible. They all are on god like pedestals, especially those "basically the world" types.

[12-Nov-18 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763

[12-Nov-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> I've always been a little skeptic about government-ruled cryptos, as this technology was precisely
designed to prevent governments from acting with impunity behind the opacity of the old system.
The beauty of cryptocurrencies is that they allow, through transparency, to avoid all those misunderstandings
that inevitably lead to corruption. I know very closely the case of crypto called "Petro" which was launched
by the Venezuelan government (Yes, that government who took practically the most rich country of the world into
an economic-ruin of almost 1 million percent inflation this year) in an attempt to evade the US economic sanctions.
But it didn't take too long for the fallacies of this project to be exposed: Lack of information about how to
buy it or exchange it, a not clear and totally unprofessional whitepaper, anyone knows how will be the crypto-oil
link as they have said that the coins will be backed in real oil reserves, and even the block explorer is not working
correctly. In a recent announcement of the Venezuela's government they stated that "only the ones who purchases Petro before December 31 can convert it to any other digital currency" as if they were going to regulate who and when
can the coins be exchanged.
