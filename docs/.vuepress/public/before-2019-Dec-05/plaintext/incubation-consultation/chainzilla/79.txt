[12-Dec-18 01:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Chainzilla is a company that focuses on onboarding projects, consulting, app design & development, and incubation of new products.

[12-Dec-18 01:29 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We also offer our services in different platforms. Nem, Komodo, ETH, and Qtum for now.

[12-Dec-18 01:29 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I don't think chainzilla is on the same category as verus

[12-Dec-18 01:29 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Both are pbaas?

[12-Dec-18 01:30 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Verus is much more technological and it revokes around the verus blockchain. I can see chainzilla offering verus services.

[12-Dec-18 01:30 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Like security or custom blockchains with their verus hash

[12-Dec-18 01:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Think of Chainzilla as the bridge that connects the client and a project like verus.

[12-Dec-18 01:34 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Chain zilla is not mineable

[12-Dec-18 01:34 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Correct

[12-Dec-18 01:34 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Pure dpow

[12-Dec-18 01:34 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] I haven‚Äôt been following.  But I missed a lot of airdrops üòâ

[12-Dec-18 01:35 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We did an airdrop for KMD holders (500KMD and more) some time back

[12-Dec-18 01:35 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] I have no where near that amount of kmd

[12-Dec-18 01:35 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Oh OK

[12-Dec-18 01:35 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Yeah it was some time back.

[12-Dec-18 01:35 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[PTYX#6840] üí™

[12-Dec-18 01:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Lol

[12-Dec-18 01:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Is that a lot?

[12-Dec-18 01:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] There will only be 2.5M in circulation. If everything goes as planned, we won't need a second ico sale which will mean the tokens will be locked up.

[12-Dec-18 01:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] How can I get more chuainzilla if I can‚Äôt mine

[12-Dec-18 01:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Participate in the upcoming ICO, get it after the ico on an exchange, or fulfill some bounties

[12-Dec-18 01:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Solve some puzzles

[12-Dec-18 01:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Faucet.chainzilla.io

[12-Dec-18 01:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] There are a few ways

[12-Dec-18 12:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] Is the ICO still gona be priced in USD despite the bear market and devaluation in USD of all crypto  ?

[12-Dec-18 12:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Yes

Hi @Captain_Jack, I'll PM you the details.

[14-Dec-18 10:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] Bosque Guardian is one of the projects in which Chainzilla is working. It surged as an initiative to preserve and protect the Tarapoto Forest (Peru) against deforestation and building a "Green" boutique Hotel.  Rafael Benavides, the enterpreneur behind this initiative provided us the conceptual master plan and some sketches of the hotel.
This is the full article and some of the images of the conceptual plan <https://medium.com/chainzilla/project-update-bosque-guardian-898c5f6e11cd>

[stock999#4818] A very clear reason of delay,  a long xmas-new year holidays. It's a  died season for any business usually. üòÄ üòú

[15-Dec-18 05:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[enfarktus#3901] Hi! I'm curious about the cost of a blockchain project. For example, what is the cost of the system that Chainzilla creates in the Ethereum network to a company?

[15-Dec-18 05:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] @enfarktus Chainzilla doesn'√æ work with Ethereum

[15-Dec-18 05:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[enfarktus#3901] You're wrong!

[15-Dec-18 05:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[enfarktus#3901] ChainZilla is a 4th gen Blockchain as a Service provider for NEM, Komodo, QTum, and Ethereum.

[15-Dec-18 05:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] A simple token is $5,000, with security review

[15-Dec-18 05:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] So no complex smart contracts

[15-Dec-18 05:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] A complex contract ranges from 5-20K

[15-Dec-18 06:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It all depends on the overall scope of work

[15-Dec-18 06:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We have a standard pricing sheet but many of the services we offer are new and we have to establish benchmark prices

[15-Dec-18 06:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[enfarktus#3901] @PTYX Thank you for answer! üëçüèª

[15-Dec-18 06:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Our cost is 60-75% lower than our competitors which are the ico launch platforms

[15-Dec-18 06:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[enfarktus#3901] Exactly!

[15-Dec-18 06:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[enfarktus#3901] It seems that with the support of Chainzilla the number of individual projects will increase.

[15-Dec-18 06:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] sorry, didn't know of that

[15-Dec-18 06:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @enfarktus in time yes, we are usually approached by 1-5 people weekly that want to launch projects but only 10% passes the due diligence process and then 50% of those pass to the closing phase. We are just getting started with our sales marketing. We have been focused on ico marketing and community building

[15-Dec-18 06:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] As we move out of this ICO phase we are going to throw everything we have at sales marketing

[15-Dec-18 06:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We've already closed sales for 2 blockchains, one app, and have 2 partnership with projects in which the chainzilla company has stake.

[15-Dec-18 06:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
