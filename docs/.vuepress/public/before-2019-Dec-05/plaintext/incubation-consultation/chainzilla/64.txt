[03-Nov-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Yeah whoever wins should definitely post their method

[03-Nov-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <regtable> Function a(){} debug(a) works or not guess and guess again

[03-Nov-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Nov-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Nov-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <regtable> Is that just part of decoration or a word.

[03-Nov-18 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <regtable> As it goes through so I guess it's a word and hook hand is just a herring

[03-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <sgt-pot-smoker> no ship is on original pic of map dude

[03-Nov-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <sgt-pot-smoker> i think

[03-Nov-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <regtable> Well

[03-Nov-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <OszyðŸ¤ª> hope zilla will cover the cost of my mental treatment

[03-Nov-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Nov-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Voight> 11 words or one word without space

[03-Nov-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Nov-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Iseki> I have nothing better to do in my life

[03-Nov-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It would be funny if the first map was just a map to the original map

[03-Nov-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <sgt-pot-smoker> u dropping hints there?

[03-Nov-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> No, the hints are in the binary code. I'm just poking fun.

[03-Nov-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <sgt-pot-smoker> lol well you could be that savage lmao we dont know ðŸ˜‰

[03-Nov-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <OszyðŸ¤ª> not funny ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜¢

[03-Nov-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Yeah if the price was like 100K I would make it extra complex. It's actually fairly straightforward.

[03-Nov-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <regtable> When u know

[03-Nov-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It'll make sense when you know

[03-Nov-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> ðŸ™‚

[03-Nov-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <regtable> Same goes for most things crypto. It's voodoo till you understand it then it's just if or and else

[03-Nov-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <SadykovT> is it one sentence or are the words unrelated ?

[03-Nov-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Mike_O.> Theres a lot of little things that make so many variables which is why its difficult and no one has solved it yet. Trying to keep track is crazy when trying everything. haha

[03-Nov-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I think keeping track might be key

[03-Nov-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Mike_O.> Like is it.... kmd, KMD, komodo or even logo ??

[03-Nov-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Because I've seen many people get real close

[03-Nov-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> With what I've seen in PM anyway

[03-Nov-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Mike_O.> haha i wondered if people were trying to squeeze clues in private maessages yet or not.

[03-Nov-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <OszyðŸ¤ª> so we can pm you? ðŸ˜„ wait i'll send what i have i want to know ðŸ˜„

[03-Nov-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Steve10> Any way to crack it on mobile? I have some time just not at my computer anymore

[03-Nov-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <sgt-pot-smoker> ronald or mcdonald or clown

[03-Nov-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <regtable> List out words for each one like moon, deathstar, fake komodo kmd and so on for each image then use a programme to dictionary list all possible combinations

[03-Nov-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <regtable> If I had the energy to do that I would. But macports has sapped me of it

[03-Nov-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <regtable> I don't want to see code again after this compile ðŸ˜‚

[03-Nov-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <OszyðŸ¤ª> i am generating badass addresses tho might keep some XDD

[03-Nov-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <regtable> Haha.

[03-Nov-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <regtable> It's worked anyways it's a. Topic of conversation and b. A conversion tool makes people b1 download a wallet b2. join discord b3. talk

[03-Nov-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <sgt-pot-smoker> thing is have i got the seed to those badass addys ?

[03-Nov-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <sgt-pot-smoker> we will never know lmao i tried so many

[03-Nov-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <sgt-pot-smoker> i honestly cant think of anything new

[03-Nov-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <OszyðŸ¤ª> same

[03-Nov-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <OszyðŸ¤ª> we need the first letter of each word please ðŸ˜„

[03-Nov-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <regtable> Word one.

[03-Nov-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Mike_O.> I thinkk we all can agree... moon is moon

[03-Nov-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Mike_O.> then it gets crazy lol

[03-Nov-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Nov-18 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
