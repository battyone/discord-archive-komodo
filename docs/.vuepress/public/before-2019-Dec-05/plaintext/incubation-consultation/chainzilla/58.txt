[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> True, @Instel7 , it was completely different. Everything. And PTYX was there since the beginning. He's like our grandpa.

[23-Oct-18 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> He can tell you thousands stories about Komodo and its origin.

[23-Oct-18 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Ask him and write a book.

[23-Oct-18 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Actually would be nice to make a documentary

[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> such a good idea!

[23-Oct-18 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> then it's a great idea!

[23-Oct-18 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> We can also make a crypto-crowdfunding

[23-Oct-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> PTYX has a quite unique capability to explain complex things in an easy to understand manner

[23-Oct-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> it would be an awesome project as a documentary. i'm already convinced the movie would be good

[23-Oct-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> good -> great

[23-Oct-18 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Yes, It would be nice if few of the oldest members can give me an interview

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> the number is higher.

[24-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Yes - The number is much higher .. this is why I am asking why use the 6.3

[24-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> lowball is better than exaggeration

Money-laundering watchdog to set first cryptocurrency rules by June
The global watchdog for money laundering will set up its first rules on oversight of cryptocurrencies by June, a major step towards creating international standards for an asset currently subject to patchy regulations.

[25-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Regulation is coming

[25-Oct-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It's going to get difficult for projects that operate in grey areas if we see world coordination. Good or bad?

[25-Oct-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> main problem is, that all the people doing or wanting to do 'regulating' have no clue what they are regulating

[25-Oct-18 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> they don't know the details, but the devil is always in details

[25-Oct-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> guess we'll have to wait until there is more info about what they actually want to do and how they plan to do it

[25-Oct-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> not directly related to crypto, but i watched the social media hearings in US senate and wooooww these guys have no idea how any of that stuff actually works. their ideas of regulating social media were completely out of touch with reality.

[25-Oct-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> Zuckerberg, and Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey were probably having a lot of internal struggles not to tell them, to first learn more and then come to ask questions

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Those were actually created by a Komodo community member. I actually did reach out to them and have a few for chainzilla in the works. Not so much to explain the platform but explain our services per platform

[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> What is Untrum ?

[26-Oct-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @Hungry_BullBear Utrum is a platform that rewards members for Crypto Reviews, Analysis and Market Predictions with $OOT tokens.

[26-Oct-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> They are based on Komodo also, so they are part of Komodo's ecosystem

[26-Oct-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> How is that actually gona work ?

[26-Oct-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I think @Instel7 is confusing some things. Utrum is one of our partners. They are a rating platform that launched using Komodo. Utrum will be similar to other ico rating sites with added features and more transparency.
