[cryptic1#3598] I tried the faucet and it worked last night

[23-Jul-18 08:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] thank you

[23-Jul-18 08:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] What in a name is the faucet?? What does it do?

[23-Jul-18 08:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Buddz1993#5380] https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/faucet/prlpay gives you 0,1 zilla

[23-Jul-18 08:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Buddz1993#5380] change the token to chainzilla

[23-Jul-18 08:14 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] How it gives you 0.1 ?

[23-Jul-18 08:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] it will send it to your kmd address (zilla address) which you paste

[23-Jul-18 08:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] Doesnt work..

[23-Jul-18 08:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[23-Jul-18 08:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] try to click those 3 dots and open the page as desktop (select that option)

[23-Jul-18 08:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] Ok ok :)

[23-Jul-18 08:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] page will reload with a capatcha

[23-Jul-18 08:19 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] Did and the captcha didnt show up.. only after refreshing again.

[23-Jul-18 08:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] maybe try from your computer later

[23-Jul-18 08:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] should work

[23-Jul-18 08:23 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] Yeah.. will try later.. it hangs in processing

[23-Jul-18 08:23 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] I just tried faucet and it froze on "processing"

[23-Jul-18 08:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] you can try with other explorer or use the option "web site for computer"

[23-Jul-18 08:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Buddz1993#5380] it only works on computer so far

[23-Jul-18 08:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] üëç

[23-Jul-18 08:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Buddz1993#5380] at least for iphones the chapta verification doesnt load up .

[23-Jul-18 08:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] I'll give it a try once I'm home.

[23-Jul-18 08:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] That last airdrop is perfect for a dex fee.  üòõ

[23-Jul-18 08:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[traiderqwerty#3252] Hi, I did exchange kmd - zilla for hyperdex, several exchanges passed quickly, others stopped at phases 2 and 3 within 1-2 hours, do I have to wait or take some action myself?

[23-Jul-18 09:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @traiderqwerty make sure you're on the latest version. If it gets stuck, restar the hyperDex

[23-Jul-18 09:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It should return the funds to you.

[23-Jul-18 09:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We have to Kickstart the bobs every now and then

[23-Jul-18 09:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] So if it gets stuck let me know and I'll check

[23-Jul-18 09:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[traiderqwerty#3252] I performed the restart several times, 2 swaps in stages 2/5 & 3/5 remained

[23-Jul-18 09:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Makw sure you're on the latest which has the automatic failed swap claim.

[23-Jul-18 09:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It will take a few minutes but failed swaps will be refunded and your balance will show your full balance

[23-Jul-18 09:23 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[traiderqwerty#3252] latest version hyperdex ?

[23-Jul-18 09:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[traiderqwerty#3252] 0.1.0 - alpha 10

[23-Jul-18 09:25 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[traiderqwerty#3252] sorry my english is very bad i am using a translator

[23-Jul-18 09:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[traiderqwerty#3252] 1 swap done

[23-Jul-18 09:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[24-Jul-18 03:33 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] @blubbi which ones are you referring at?

[24-Jul-18 04:44 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] At the faucet, I'm not seeing captcha's on my linux machine, on windows sometimes. So I have to go to windows to do the faucet.

[24-Jul-18 04:45 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] Not sure if this is OS related, or that it's something else

[24-Jul-18 09:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] I hate to switch from Chrome to Edge to see it, not sure if it was my adblock or similar plugin

[24-Jul-18 09:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] Since captcha is being provided by google you just have to make sure none of google related stuff is getting blocked from loading on page and it will work fine

[24-Jul-18 11:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] Somehow it works in Opera

[24-Jul-18 12:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] Article on CoinDesk about Dex trading platforms not being actually decentralized - Barterdex and Hyperdex omitted from the article.

[24-Jul-18 12:14 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] so far they have been always omitted

[24-Jul-18 12:14 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] go figure...

[24-Jul-18 12:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] Just like how EOS was leading the way in transactions per second - but Komodo has tested way higher before they even launched their platform. There‚Äôs no mention of that anywhere.

[24-Jul-18 12:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Galikazoid#8606] fickle

[24-Jul-18 12:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] many crypto publications ask money for coverage

[24-Jul-18 12:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] and there is too many projects out there for legit crypto outlets to research them all

[24-Jul-18 12:19 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] path of least resistance is to be fed the stories and ask money for publishing them

[24-Jul-18 12:19 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] newssites win, crypto ecosystem loses

[24-Jul-18 12:20 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] there is less than 1% of all people who actually research anything in greater depth

[24-Jul-18 12:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] so here we are

[24-Jul-18 12:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] True, I always forget that a lot of these ‚Äúlegit‚Äù publications basically ask for money to put you on the front page. Same reason why there isn‚Äôt much coverage of ICOs on CoinDesk except for the rare few.

[pbca26#5430] i'm going to switch the faucet to fetch from recapthca.net instead of google.com
figured it could be due to google being blocked for some users
