[dscrd-cz] <nmesis> Hey @PTYX, would love to help test iOS, shout out when it‚Äôs on TestFlight?

[25-Jan-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Yes on testflight

[25-Jan-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I'll add you to the list and ask for your email in PM.

[25-Jan-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <nmesis> Thanks buddy

[25-Jan-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Hungry_BullBear i would never

[25-Jan-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Mcafee is cringe and he seems to me like a conman. Someone who can get masses to follow him without question.

[25-Jan-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I did the poll because I wanted to see what people thought and if the mcafee trolls would come to his rescue.

[25-Jan-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> He is a conman and a proven criminal

[25-Jan-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Also an insane man if you dive into his personal life choices

Chainzilla's token sale is just one week away. Today we'll be posting our Ask Me Anything video response to the questions our community asked regarding our ICO.

[25-Jan-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Tac> @PTYX can we talk kmd dpos service in here

[25-Jan-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Tac> Or is there a more appropriate chanel

[25-Jan-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Tac there is a #komodo  channel but you can ask questions here too

[25-Jan-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Tac> @PTYX so I have seen the price calculations for what it costs to 51% attack a chain for an hour how would I find out that amount for new coins

[25-Jan-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> https://www.crypto51.app/

[25-Jan-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> For new coins it's a bit difficult but you can always reach out to them

[25-Jan-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @Tac As far as I know, the cost would be proportional to the current hashrate the blockchain has

[25-Jan-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> You could take the new coin's hashrate and compare it with a similar coin

[25-Jan-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> if it's the same protocol you can get a ballpark figure of what an attack would cost. Most coins are just forks of major coins

[25-Jan-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> With dpow, the cost changes of course since it's creating checkpoint in the bitcoin blockchain.

[25-Jan-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Tac> The coin Is the same algorithm  an the new dpos that is using kmd gin

[25-Jan-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Tac> I would like to ask them about using kmd dpos but would like to have rough numbers before I do thank you @PTYX

[25-Jan-19 07:57 PM] PTYX#6840
I'll reach out to them

[25-Jan-19 07:58 PM] PTYX#6840
It would be good to be added up there

[25-Jan-19 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-cz] <jellysmash> hi there good people

[25-Jan-19 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jellysmash> what exchange(s) is Chainzilla trading on?

[25-Jan-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Hungry_BullBear in digitalprice there are people trading but we haven't announced it as official yet. the coins in there were mostly deposited during the testing period. After the ICO we will give the go ahead on the exchanges we will be available.

[25-Jan-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The cryptopia hack was a blessing. We were going to be listed there

[25-Jan-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Im glad it happened before the ico.

[25-Jan-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> aa sorry

[25-Jan-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Hungry_BullBear did you want to test chameleon?

[25-Jan-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Dont have time really - I am swarmed on my day job

[25-Jan-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> No problem, just wondering.

[25-Jan-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> would like to test but really dont have the energy and time for it

[25-Jan-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> You'll get to use it soon enough anyway as the official ChainZilla wallet üòÑ

[25-Jan-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Hope so

[25-Jan-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> This iteration implemented Agama seeds. So anyone with an agama wallet can use it. I'm very happy with the progress.

[25-Jan-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Are all tokens on-boarded by you gona be available in Chameleon  ?

[25-Jan-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> This version is much smoother than the last one.

[25-Jan-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Hungry_BullBear yes, it's built into our pricing.

[25-Jan-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Nice

[25-Jan-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The client has a choice of a whitelabel or managed wallet

[25-Jan-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> what protections will the Chameleon wallet have (concerning phone hacks and malicious attacks) ?

[25-Jan-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> once we have the official release, we will begin the security audits as we are applying for PCI DSS

[25-Jan-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We aren't going to get stifled with it at the moment since all the frameworks we are using are open source. However, when the release version is ready, security is number 1 priority. In the coming month we will announce the news about what features will be coming to Chameleon and why we  will pursue the PCI DSS compliance.
