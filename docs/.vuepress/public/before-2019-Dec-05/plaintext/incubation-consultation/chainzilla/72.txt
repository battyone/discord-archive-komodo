[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> The Komodo Platform has also updated their website, but they have specified this is just a transitional website as they are currently doing a complete rebrand and renewed identity design for Komodo. They promised we'll be able to look at the new desings in the upcoming months!

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @enfarktus we haven't been giving Bct much attention. I think I've mentioned it before. Analytics show us it has the worst performance out of all our social media and channels.

What do you think about the $BCH fork? Join the discussion at @Chainzillaio's discord https://t.co/HjG4PwfIad - https://t.co/OLE1RFkVGH

[13-Nov-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> @PTYX  I think that BCH is like a already used condom:  i got it in Aug 2017, i sold it at the maximum price within first days and forgot about.  I considered it as a  died path of evolution at that time.  Roger Ver and Co. just wanted to grab some money easily, so they created BCH, nothing else.   Currently i have no any BCH accounts with more or less reasonable balance,  so nothing to think about it's fork because  of no chance to earn anything.  I'm not going to buy BCH especially for participation  in this fork. I think that  BCH big holders have exactly this target:  to pump the price on the event's rumor and to sell us their BCH bags. Correspondly, it's a way to losses for us, is not worth to buy.

[13-Nov-18 03:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
I actually bought some bch, but I guess times have changed. Fork pump days are over perhaps. Still not at much of a loss yet.

[13-Nov-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> What will the new BCH be called?

[dscrd-cz] <enfarktus> @PTYX "we haven't been giving Bct much attention. I think I've mentioned it before. Analytics show us it has the worst performance out of all our social media and channels." 
                                                                                                         However, it is better to use all channels to ensure brand awareness.

[13-Nov-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Resources are focused where we need them most at the time. We will keep the main thread updated but don't expect much noise on bitcointalk.

[13-Nov-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> our marketing team has been focused on facebook and google in the past 2 weeks. we area actually in the process of launching a google compliant landing page so we can use google ads but facebook already approved us

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I expect to see more growth from the traditional marketing tools like google ads and facebook ads. We also are marketing to bring in clients and subsequently close sales. We need to target our demographic correctly to increase sales.

[13-Nov-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> although we haven't started the paid ads on linkedin yet. in the next day our landing page is ready so we will finish that process.

[13-Nov-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <enfarktus> The last share was made two months ago!

[13-Nov-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> the landing page is nothing more than a version of the ico site without any outside links, or anything else other than the contact form.

[13-Nov-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <enfarktus> As you know, most good projects cannot reach the level they deserve because of wrong publicity campaigns. For example Komodo.  I hope ChainZilla isn't one of them. Good luck! üëçüèª

[13-Nov-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @enfarktus as i mentioned, the linkedin paid advertising hasn't started. We have a secondary account which i use to publish any articles or links that has a larger audience. Until we have the landing page, they won't approve us to push the ads. I appreciate your input but I can assure you we are on it.

[13-Nov-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> https://www.linkedin.com/in/blockchainasaservice/ is where I usually publish any news or links. that will change in the coming week as the landing page is ready and we're just waiting for approval to use the ads feature.

[dscrd-cz] <Cruz_77> Hey guys, I'm Preston & I spend most of my time in the Verus Discord.

Maybe you've been over there & talked with John Westbrook. @JohnWestbrook ...
He has written Medium articles about VerusCoin & Utrum. And I know he has helped tons of people with technical issues, in the Verus discord, too. So maybe you've met him.

Well, his parents' home was burned down in the California Wildfire, this week. And, his dad is a Vietnam Veteran. Needless to say, they are faced with a difficult situation.  And can use any type of help with contributions at the GoFundMe, that he and his siblings set up, for his parents & their medical expenses. If you are unable to do or just don't really know him, and you have a minute or two--maybe just tweet him & let him know that the KMD Ecosystem cares..  His Twitter handle is @EthAdvisor
