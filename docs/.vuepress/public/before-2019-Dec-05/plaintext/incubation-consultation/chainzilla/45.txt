[Cryptoon#3362] And then they just distribute the zilla to those adresses accordingly

[15-Aug-18 04:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] just login with your komodo seed to your zilla wallet

[15-Aug-18 04:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] and presto there are your zilla coins

[15-Aug-18 04:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Kind of with ERC20 where you only have one ETH adress

[15-Aug-18 04:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NedBGQ#8462] Thanks for the clarification

[15-Aug-18 04:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] np!

[15-Aug-18 04:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[SDang#2970] Thx mate

[15-Aug-18 04:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] if you run kmd natively then you must extrect your key to login to zilla

[15-Aug-18 04:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Marv#8481] cheers! So when is the snapshot?

[15-Aug-18 04:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] there is a vid on how to do it somewhere

[15-Aug-18 04:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Snapshot was 4h ago

[15-Aug-18 04:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

hi

[15-Aug-18 07:12 PM] dgoce420#8844
how to claim tokens on 30th ?

[15-Aug-18 07:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] they are automatically credited to your account

[15-Aug-18 08:19 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Cryptoon please send me your address. I'll send you some zilla for helping out :)

[15-Aug-18 08:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Well done @Cryptoon for looking after things whilst the patient recovers !!!

[15-Aug-18 08:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Np glad I can help with my relatively limited knowledge üòÉ

[15-Aug-18 08:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Who are you kidding - You are KMD OG üòÇ

[15-Aug-18 08:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Haha no way, only for little over a year now

[15-Aug-18 08:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] The OG‚Äôs been here since the early supernet days

[15-Aug-18 08:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Maybe even early NXT dats

[15-Aug-18 08:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Days*

[15-Aug-18 08:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] I wish I was around this long already üò≠

[16-Aug-18 12:14 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] everyone if you have funds in digitalprice.io please withdraw them before September 30th.

[16-Aug-18 12:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] They closing already?

[16-Aug-18 12:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] @PTYX

[16-Aug-18 12:39 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] @Hollowman9000  they asking for money to upgrade the  wallet  which is stupid so PTYX denied to pay such thing hence asked to be delisted instead

[16-Aug-18 12:39 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Ah

[16-Aug-18 12:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] They‚Äôre kind of unknown, I only know of them because of verus

[16-Aug-18 12:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Stupid move on their part

[16-Aug-18 12:41 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] greed can only take someone so far

[16-Aug-18 12:41 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Biting the hands that feed them, however little that may be

[16-Aug-18 12:41 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] I won‚Äôt look for them to be relevant in the future

[16-Aug-18 12:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] i never really heard of them until now and not really interested i would have used them only coz of zilla now i wont at all

[16-Aug-18 01:09 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] Their are nice people an accessible. Maybe they are not asking for money for listing to anybody, and that's affecting their finances negatively? And now they need money for manpower? 
Mistakes are frequent from new enterprises, we need to understand.
Remember, they created the first KMD based market.

[16-Aug-18 01:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] @Deleted User didnt knew about KMD market , may be they need to work on their business model a little and be upfront about the fee's they will charge etc. so there isnt any confusion

[16-Aug-18 01:12 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] Totally agreed, @Mastermind

[16-Aug-18 01:32 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] There are very few airdrop rewards.

[16-Aug-18 01:33 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Deleted User they went awol for more than a week. Not acceptable being an exchange

[16-Aug-18 01:34 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Hollowman9000 i requested to delist zilla. We won't be listed on an exchange that can't even complete the simple task of updating daemons. Also, their lack of communication and overall demeanor is not professional. We already have better prospects for exchanges.

[16-Aug-18 01:35 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] Chainzilla       Is the money listed on the DP? Still voted.

[16-Aug-18 01:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Until they prove themselves, I'd stay away from digitalprice.io

[16-Aug-18 01:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± I don't understand the question

[16-Aug-18 01:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] @PTYX I totally agree with the decision, and the given reasons. I just think that we must give them some time to learn about these things (not from ZILLA, though, they already lost that battle).

[16-Aug-18 01:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] True yes, I wish them the best

[16-Aug-18 01:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] digitalprice.io     How is Chainzilla going

[16-Aug-18 01:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] @Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± you mean if the currency is already listed? Yes, but it is de-listing, withdrawing from the exchange. 
Chainzilla's project owner is not happy with the exchange. 
Are you from China?

[16-Aug-18 01:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] ÊòØÁöÑÔºåÊàëÊù•Ëá™‰∏≠ÂõΩ„ÄÇ@Deleted User

[Emmanuel#5426] @Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± Be very welcome. Are you part of Digitalprice.io team? or just bounty hunter?

[16-Aug-18 01:44 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] @Deleted User Not a member of Digitalprice.io, nor a bounty hunter,
Just a KMD supporter.

[16-Aug-18 01:45 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] @Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± Even better! üòÑ
How is the KMD chinese community? Growing?

[16-Aug-18 01:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] @Deleted User  Not good, because KMD does not value wallets and related Chinese translations.

[16-Aug-18 01:48 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] @Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± it is hard, finding chinese translators.

[16-Aug-18 01:48 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] I think that Chainzilla's wallet will have chinese translation.

[16-Aug-18 01:51 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] @Deleted User  The translated text was given last year and they did not pay attention at all.

[16-Aug-18 01:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] @Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± you talking about Komodo? Komodo wallet?

[16-Aug-18 02:00 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] Chinese is really really hard for us, you need to understand. We need more chinese technical people in the community.

[16-Aug-18 02:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] @Deleted User Chinese has the same meaning as Japanese.

[16-Aug-18 02:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] Ideograms? I know, still really hard üòÇ

[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] @Deleted User Using Google Translate can be 80% correct. It doesn't need to translate the code, just translate the word name in the wallet, it should be easy.

[16-Aug-18 02:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] so... in 2 weeks we get the airdrop of the snapshot yesterday .. right?

[16-Aug-18 03:20 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[16-Aug-18 06:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CrytoHunter#3593] so the snapshot for the airdrop was 8/15 and we are waiting until 8/30 for the distribution?

[16-Aug-18 08:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Yep - that‚Äôs right.

[16-Aug-18 08:23 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crypto9999#3411] Can we move coins back to the exchange ?

[16-Aug-18 08:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] ?  Once they are yours you can do what you want. Is your question specific to an exchange?

[16-Aug-18 08:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] @Unknown yes you can move your KMD

[16-Aug-18 09:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[cryptopeeps#2865] @PTYX being that Zilla will be a dICO, does this affect small investors in the US?

[16-Aug-18 09:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[cryptopeeps#2865] Noob question üëÜüèº

[16-Aug-18 09:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] It will be an ICO

[16-Aug-18 09:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] And probably yes

[16-Aug-18 10:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crypto9999#3411] @miles I meant it for kmd @Mastermind you got it! Thanks guys

[16-Aug-18 10:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @cryptopeeps we never said chainzilla would launch a Divo.

[16-Aug-18 10:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's an ICO by definition that will be fully compliant with the jurisdiction we are using.

[16-Aug-18 10:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] when zilla 1000‚Ç¨? ü§ó

[16-Aug-18 10:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @cryptopeeps citizens from the USA, China, Panama, Singapore, Canada, Iran, and North Korea are restricted.

[17-Aug-18 05:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] The US govt has about 6 month to chill out and pass new legislation to allow investing in ICO. üòè

[17-Aug-18 06:50 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NWhiskeyTango#5590] Im guessing it will be pushed to about 3Q 2019
