[AkiraX#8269] Maybe someone can hack ptyx discord and start running the airdrop commands

[14-Jul-18 01:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] .airdrop 21 500

[14-Jul-18 01:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[traiderqwerty#3252] If you post your address out of turn you automatically lose chance to participate in next airdrop

[14-Jul-18 01:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Really?

[14-Jul-18 01:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] What I'd it's just being late to the last one

[14-Jul-18 01:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] That could be a costy trial @AkiraX 😃

[14-Jul-18 01:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Even if you hacked the bot, who would make the payouts?

[14-Jul-18 01:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[14-Jul-18 01:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I don't trust the bot enough to make payouts. There is the human factor.

[14-Jul-18 01:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] I was joking

[14-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[KomodoBo#8264] Hi glc! Good to see you here

[14-Jul-18 02:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[glc#8243] Hi Bo! i had to wait 10 minutes to answer you 😃

[14-Jul-18 02:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] I see, no problem 😃

[14-Jul-18 02:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[glc#8243] Should i have a agama wallet? Or erc20 address is ok?

[14-Jul-18 02:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] Agama

[14-Jul-18 02:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] You need a Komodo address. You can add both KMD and ZILLA in Lite mode to Agama wallet

[14-Jul-18 02:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[glc#8243] Ok thanks

[14-Jul-18 02:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] you're welcome. It's a great wallet

[14-Jul-18 02:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[glc#8243] When will the airdrop is over?

[14-Jul-18 02:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[glc#8243] I will check

[14-Jul-18 02:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] If you have 500KMD you apply for the real airdrop.
Smaller airdrops are done here daily i think at suprise times 😃

[14-Jul-18 02:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Tort#9226] how do you apply?

[14-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Tort#9226] I have well over 500 kmd 8)

[14-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Think if you are commited to those daily airdrops that you can get more than the main airdrop.

[14-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] then you apply. More information will follow here I think

[14-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] Possible

[14-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] @Tort maybe you automatically get ZILLA in August. Or maybe we should register. I think autmatically

[14-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] Best to have coins in Agama

[14-Jul-18 02:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Tort#9226] I do 8)

[14-Jul-18 02:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] Hold your Komodo in an agama wallet minimum 500. Nothing else to do for the first main airdrop

[14-Jul-18 02:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Tort#9226] I'm a little worried about connecting my wallet to the net

[14-Jul-18 02:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Tort#9226] I try to keep it in cold storage

[14-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Tort#9226] holding until 2022 ish

[14-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] How to store kmd in cold storage?
I only have ledger

[14-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] But i think agama is secure

[14-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If you have a ledger with 500 or more KMD you will be included in the snapshot. however, you will need to export the privatekey of that particular address in the future to access your funds in Agama or our standalone wallet when it's released

[14-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] No need to apply, just keep in the Agama wallet

[14-Jul-18 02:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @[TPUX] Djith Wattignies I think it’s as secure as it can be, when u got your keys u good

[14-Jul-18 02:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] I only have the 256 phrase

[14-Jul-18 03:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[Bo#8264] sorry, I misread what you sayd

[14-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] I received it only once a couple days ago

[14-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[j lizard#5827] There's probably a space in front of the address, try to remove the space

[14-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] No spaces...bummer cause it acts like I'm not even hitting 'ok' button

[14-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] How often can I go to faucet

[14-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] once a day

[14-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KLMJ1#2767] have to wait 24 hours

[14-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
