[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> @BOenster that is because u had never used it before ,Neo ...

[03-Nov-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Voight> What this treasury map shows? Agama Wallet?

[03-Nov-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Of course - it is very obvious - top right is the address , right side is the hint , bottom side is the amount .

[03-Nov-18 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Voight> And coins: pizza, arrr, btch, kmd crypto conditions on Agama?

[03-Nov-18 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Nov-18 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Voight> Maybe something with sapling?

[03-Nov-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> I am missing something

[03-Nov-18 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <enfarktus> Hi, Is seed a meaningful phrase or independent words?

[03-Nov-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> both options are possible

[03-Nov-18 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <sgt-pot-smoker> im struggling on this one XD my brain hurts

[03-Nov-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> would be nice to see how many you got right  when you try üòÑ

[03-Nov-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <sgt-pot-smoker> my brain hurts. lmfao i have a notepad open full of random words now üòÇ

[03-Nov-18 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> same. even the right words have many possibilities and then you may not have the right order at all

[03-Nov-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> There are clues hidden in the map

[03-Nov-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> Apart from the words?

[03-Nov-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> I mean i got the clue that says things about the words but still not enough. üòÇ

[03-Nov-18 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <SadykovT> the qr code is involved ?? it's broken.

[03-Nov-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> ü§î I dont want to give too much away. Each image added to the map equals one word.

[03-Nov-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I'm a very literal person so you can assume it's a literal interpretation. The clue in binary code should tell you which word goes first in the seed. Then it's up to you to pickup on the subtle clues as to the order of the final words.

[03-Nov-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> yes but the QR and the binary gives the same clue. i was expecting some more after i had to redraw the QR üòÑ

[03-Nov-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Nice, lol

[03-Nov-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> honestly i was too lazy to type in the binary üòÑ

[03-Nov-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <SadykovT> 11 words

[03-Nov-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <SadykovT> follow the lines. x marks the beginning.

[03-Nov-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> ok now that it's a public secret, i can tell my problem is with those lines that are doesn't really connect all 11 words anyhow üòÑ

[03-Nov-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Oszyü§™ yes there is one word that is not so obvious. The rest are pretty obvious.

[03-Nov-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> i'll give out more clues if i feel it's becoming too hard

[03-Nov-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> i thought it was fairly simple when compared to other ones i've seen

[03-Nov-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> okay, i'll fry my brain meanwhile

[03-Nov-18 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> let it sit. come back to it. the answer will come üòÑ

[03-Nov-18 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> i'm very surprised you rebuild the qr code. i didn't think anyone would do it.
