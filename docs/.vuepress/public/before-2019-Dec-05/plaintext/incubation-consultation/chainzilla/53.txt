[PTYX#6840] @Hagen-von-Coinje if you had a native wallet you might have to use the privatekey that correlates with the address that had the 500 KMD

[01-Oct-18 04:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hagen-von-Coinje#9555] I had a native wallet back then and never moved, so I should be able to see it right? I¬¥m using the 0.2.41d version

[04-Oct-18 10:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] @Instel7 the ZEC Sapling protocol update goes live on 28th october and i've seen that spv support should be available some time in 2019

[04-Oct-18 10:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @wookie our goal is to provide the Goto wallet for the Komodo ecosystem. Like MEW for eth. We are in the process of also adding ETH, XMR, and NEM to our wallet so as to support Erc20 and as many coins as possible. If you launch a chain on Komodo, I think you'll most likely want to be on Chameleon.
