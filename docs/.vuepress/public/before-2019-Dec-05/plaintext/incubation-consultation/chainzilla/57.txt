[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> This is a little long but eye opening article about How the Blockchain may look like in 20 years from now.

What Will Bitcoin Look Like in Twenty Years? – Hacker Noon
Prediction is a tricky business.

[23-Oct-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> These are the predictions the author made and which I think are the most likely to happen, what do you think?

1) When the bubble of hype and speculation pops, prices will drop, the majority
of ICOs will fail and the projects with the most practical, problem-solving *cough*Komodo*cough*
and easy adoption will mature and grow in the long run, becoming the leaders for it's massive adoption.

2) Many governments will not sit by and lose control of the money supply without a vicious fight.
Very strong government (centralized) cryptocurrencies come to power and dominate the flow of money for many
people around the world, they'll impose it and masses will follow them. This is maybe the most dystopian view for us.

3) Cryptocurrencies Will Become a Parallel Economic Operating System for the Planet. For this to happens,
descentralized cryptos need a killer app, one application so indispensable that people can’t imagine their
lives without it. 

4) That Killer App needs to expands and extends the best characteristics of the blockchain while
minimizing its greatest weaknesses. It must be: a) Ubiquitous. b) Easy to use. c) Acts as a platform for everything
from changing money to protecting privacy. d) Open source

5) Blockchain is Just the Beginning of another ruling Decentralized Consensus: Like the ones we have nowadays:
Hashgraph and IOTA's Tangle

6) Crypto Will Get a LOT Easier to Use: As any other tech development, Crypto will find it's own path implementing
solutions from other technologies to reduce it's major flaws and making it much easer to user for the average person.

[23-Oct-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Leave me your opinion, which prediction do you feel is the most likely to present to us in the following years?

[23-Oct-18 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Mixic> 5) Blockchain is Just the Beginning of another ruling Decentralized Consensus: Like the ones we have nowadays:
Hashgraph and IOTA's Tangle

[23-Oct-18 12:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @Mixic That one is a little hard to see but I think that's what history has teached us is more likely to happen

[23-Oct-18 12:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> I believe #2 to be very true. Many people in crypto are in it for personal gains and don't even realize it's potential. If asked, they couldn't even explain what blockchain is. We need to spread awareness. Those that don't know now will be "taught" by these government "blockchain projects" that will be forcefed down the throat of the population.

[23-Oct-18 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Paul> I'd say all 6 points are true!!!  Especially this Killer App is important, that you can use your coins without much effort in everyday life and that you don't have to be afraid of theft by hacker attacks.

[23-Oct-18 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> I think they all play a role, but i see #2 happening if things don't change.

[23-Oct-18 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Paul> But let me ask you something else.  In a crypto event it was told that the development team of Iota left the company and so the tangle can't be expanded any further.  Do you know if that's true?

[23-Oct-18 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> I don't know anything about IOTA but if it means the end of it's project so be it. Doesn't mean others can't come along. No?

[23-Oct-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @NWhiskeyTango That's completely true, may sound a little dystopian but that may actually happens if people is not conscious enough about their own privacy

[23-Oct-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <spencervogel> I see #3 being a necessity for mass adoption. There will need to be popular Dapps where the users don’t even realize they’re interacting with Blockchain. This will lead to trust of the technology

[23-Oct-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <c2k> I read that today and left a comment on Medium.. I actually think all the above predictions are correct to varying degrees and also agree with the author that BTC may not survive. I tweeted about it this year calling it #edisonsfirstlightbulb ...amazing visionary technology but becomming quickly outdated by far superior technology like Komodo.

Probably the one to happen soonest tho is that Governments will create their own cryptos, or put enough hash at some winning projects as to control them. Once they discover that the AI intertwined within blockchain technology gives them lots more power than they already have it will be a very quick and powerful move into this for the most powerful (think G20) governments at first with many others to follow. Orson Wells Big Brother at its finest!

[23-Oct-18 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Paul> there are simply still missing the mass adoption so that one can use crypto in everyday life.  As soon as this occurs more and more, the government becomes more and more involved.  I think currently the government already has an eye on crypto but they are NO realizing the potential does.

[23-Oct-18 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <cantptalblonit> Predictions three and four seem more logical as this is a world of duality and change takes time as the pendulum swings from one side to the other.

[23-Oct-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> #edisonsonsfirstlightbulb...i see what you did there lol I feel maybe not the most high tech crypto, but the most prevalent will overcome all. Unfortunetly i don't see news channels boasting about some "Komodo Platform"

[23-Oct-18 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <MadamLobster> I think that all predictions are logical and true, personally i tend to #6

[23-Oct-18 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> They own the medium, and Marshall Mcluhan said that who own the medium, owns the message

[23-Oct-18 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> 2) partially (strong fight -yes, governments win and centralized crypto -no) and also 3), 6)
 My opinion: people always were going to have money&assets those wouldn't been controlled by governments. Such attempts always took place in past.  Crypto just continues an old historical row of digital money such as Egold, LibertyReserve, etc.  
So cryptocurrency  has been created especially in order to destroy&replace the existing financial system, this is it's main idea and target. But crypto is really decentralized in comparison with all previous and because of this property it can't be killed or kept under government's control so easy as all digital systems before it. So i believe that it is just  the next wave of money evolution.
I don't know if it would be done by BTC, or ETH, or KMD, or else, but it shall happen earlier or later. The evolution can't be stopped by a such shit as governments or similar.

[dscrd-cz] <criptobear> My thought:

of ICOs will fail and the projects with the most practical, problem-solving  #cough Komodo cough# and easy adoption will mature and grow in the long run, becoming the leaders for it's massive adoption.
This is already happening right now!

[23-Oct-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Yes, @criptobear  I like a lot that one too, seems to be the most possible for me, even the internet had a bubble burst and the whole market fell about 85% on those days

[23-Oct-18 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <criptobear> We are attracted to cycles, even when everything goes well we destroy and restart

[23-Oct-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Yep, that's like something that goes in our dna, even the universe itself is cyclical on any way you see it

[23-Oct-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Very interesting!

[23-Oct-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> I agree with the points but I think we also need a centralised place for people to keep their cryptos. Most people do not want to be their own banks.. it's been like that throughout history. Also getting some celebrities on board will be good for mass adoption.. most people ask how high when a celebrities says jump. 😂

[23-Oct-18 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> I think if cryptos get too big governments will jump on board.. once they realise it's not going away they will try to control as much as they can

[23-Oct-18 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> Once number 1 happens and all the shit scam coins and exchanges are gone we can move forward. 👌

[23-Oct-18 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> I Agree 👆

[23-Oct-18 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> Anyone seen the great crypto conspiracy with glen beck and teeka? I seen it the other day on one of cryptozombies youtube videos. Not sure if its true as I have not verifies the information but it seems true. They show how the institutions missed the initial internet bull market so they bad mouthed it during a bear market.. everyone started selling and the institutions who bad mouthed the internet stocks started buying a shit load.  Goes on to show how those same institutions started saying bitcoin is a scam and bubble while buying up bitcoin and spending money on exchanges etc.

[dscrd-cz] <javadth> where is the poll ?

[23-Oct-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Buddz1993> Predictions are always what they are predictions so no one really can guess to what’s gonna happen in the next 10 years in this market but I would say all the 6 points are likely to happen and adoption will come into this market but slowly and steady growth not like 2017 that projects gained valued just based on the hype ..

[23-Oct-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Buddz1993> People are not aware of that and won’t fall for that so easly

[23-Oct-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763

[23-Oct-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Hungry_BullBear the delivery date for the app is 7 weeks and 2 days. We pushed the deadline back due to an unexpected amount of design work. We are going to add an update about the wallet in the next newsletter. I'll add as many details as possible of the advances and where we are at.

[23-Oct-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We also had another setback. We've been working on adding ETH to Agama/chameleon. The developer who was tackling the integration got sick and we are reevaluating other options.

[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> These days I've read a lot trying to understand how Komodo works, read the
technical stuff about notarization, Independent Assetchains, dPoW, etc. But honestly few things
were not totally clear to me. Today I stumbled upon this article that grounded me a lot about what
I was investigating. It presents a historical-context point of view of where all these tech that were
developed in the proto-komodo times comes from. All of these were conceived under other names in
that time by jl777. Assetchains were denominated Runtime Forks and Timestamp Server was like the first dPoW.
Here's the link so you can check it, will surely give nostalgia to our older members here:
