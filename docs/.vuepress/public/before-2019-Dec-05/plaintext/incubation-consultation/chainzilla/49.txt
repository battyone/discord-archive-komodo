[üåüKQweci‚òÑ#6562] First post is super cool

[10-Sep-18 05:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] first one looks better and colour could be navy blue

[10-Sep-18 05:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[wookie25#7663] I vote for 1 also. Can't tell with the skinny bars in the second one.

[10-Sep-18 06:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] First one, but I typically prefer a black background.

[10-Sep-18 07:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AchtSechs#1592] Yep, 1. Colour could be anthrazit.

[10-Sep-18 07:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[sam1023#1882] @PTYX what‚Äôs name of this app?

[12-Sep-18 10:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Mobile Chameleon app I think?

[12-Sep-18 01:14 PM] rainbro7#4735
I'm so excited!

[12-Sep-18 01:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Chameleon yes üêä

[12-Sep-18 01:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We're trying to nail down the colors and layout for mobile. We should be finished by the 25th of September. Then we begin coding the Android and then ios app. We expect to have something to test on mobile by end of October.

[12-Sep-18 01:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[üåüKQweci‚òÑ#6562] Is the wallet out yet for download

[12-Sep-18 01:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Not yet. By the end of October we plan to release the mobile version for public testing

[PTYX#6840] She's getting there

[12-Sep-18 02:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] by the way, at the top where that circle is at, there will be a chameleon that changes colors.

[12-Sep-18 02:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[üåüKQweci‚òÑ#6562] Good. She already looking sexy

[12-Sep-18 05:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Looking cool!! Are there mobile and desktop versions of Chameleon? What coins will be supported? Same as agama or more like Barterdex?

[12-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Same as Agama except less coins that aren't used

[12-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Anything we deem not necessary

[12-Sep-18 05:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We will have a mobile and desktop version. Mobile will be released first at the end of October more or less

[12-Sep-18 09:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Cool! Thanks - so screen shots showing ltc and eth, but these are not in agama?

[12-Sep-18 11:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] LTC will be added. We are waiting on our eth dev who will help us add eth to our wallet.

[12-Sep-18 11:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] LTC is already available in Agama actually

[12-Sep-18 11:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I don't have an estimated date for the inclusion of eth to our wallet but it's coming.

[13-Sep-18 08:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Thanks as always @PTYX  - didn‚Äôt know ltc was available in agama!! üòé

[Emmanuel#5426] Have you researched on that as an option?

[20-Sep-18 07:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] I didn't, just curious.

[20-Sep-18 07:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] Because, I'm thinking, putting an IPFS server behind a Cloudflare gateway, would protect the it from hackers. But what about DDoS from IPFS network itself?
