[03-Nov-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> Thank fuck for that! Never would have got that, I was being far too literal. I thought it was "eye patch" as the red line went through the doge's left eye then the right patch!

[03-Nov-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> Plus I was only using BIP39. I thought Bizonnacci was either twin or brother

[03-Nov-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Amazing work to everyone

[03-Nov-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> BIP39 word list haven't zilla or chainzilla ... after i unerstood that one of words is zilla, or chainzilla - i forget to think about BIP39 ...

[03-Nov-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> Yeah that one stumped me! I thought dinosaur or print or foot. But had so many possibles, it ended up being so many combos

[03-Nov-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> actually i don't remember what words it includes ... but absolutelly clear - that zilla can't be in BIP39 wordlist )

[03-Nov-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> but who knows ... may be zilla will be official word of "nextgen" BIP239 ))))

[03-Nov-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> Only meme words

[dscrd-cz] <jellysmash> @PTYX I saw the tweet but there weren't any instructions with it. Don't know if anyone else missed the plot on this or maybe just me? It just want clear what to do....to me anyway

[04-Nov-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The instructions or clues were in binary code off to the right

[04-Nov-18 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Nov-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @Hungry_BullBear That channel is linked to Komodo's discord #pirate Channel, so everything people talk from Komodo's channel, you can read it here also, and vice versa

[04-Nov-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Yeah that channel is bridged to the pirate community. That's why you see a bot relaying the messages

[04-Nov-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> but in short what is the pirate community

[04-Nov-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> Pirate (ticker ARRR) is a privacy coin with forced z-only transactions and with bitcoin level security through dPoW. seriously can be compared to Monero

[04-Nov-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> all others then Monero have some kind of downsides compared to Pirate

PIRATE (ARRR) is the best of Zcash (ZEC) combined with the best of Monero (XMR) and secured by Komodo's (KMD) Delayed-Proof-of-Work (dPoW) It‚Äôs a forced Shielded-transactions (z-transactions) only blockchain, meant for completely anonymous transactions. PIRATE is mined into...

[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> The Ticker is amazing

[04-Nov-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> cant wait for USD/ARRR trading pair

[04-Nov-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It was an experimental blockchain that took life of its own and I decided to bridge the communities because they have a strong miner community. Since chainzilla isn't mineable I thought it would be of interest to some people.

[04-Nov-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I think the ARRR hashrate is higher than many Zcash forks

[04-Nov-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> I can see that - anything called ARRR most definitely "took life of its own"

[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> China, through its Center for Information Industry Development has published its monthly ranking of cryptocurrencies publishing the latest rankings for October 2018.
Bitcoin falls into 19th position while Komodo remains in the top 10.
What do you think about this? Is it a fairer ranking than the coinmarketcap's?

The lead developer was Microsoft Vice President and CTO. That's cool! Verus Coin with great potential and a great team. Verus Coin has a Good start and this is just the beginning. Further Verus Coin will be in the first places of the rating! üëç

[05-Nov-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Instel7 ethereum has more documentation, more developers, and a larger ecosytem than Komodo. I can see how or why it would be placed above in some scenarios.
