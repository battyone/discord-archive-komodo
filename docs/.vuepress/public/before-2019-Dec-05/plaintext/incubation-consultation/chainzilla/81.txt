[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> Or maybe you have an extra space in there at the beginning or end of your passphrase

[30-Dec-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> @jspook16 i think you are missunderstanding

[30-Dec-18 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> i try to recover with my passphrase but no balance in my wallet also my address is different than before

[30-Dec-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> @PTYX can you help me?

[30-Dec-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> Maybe I am misunderstanding. But if the address is different thats because the passphrase is different.

[30-Dec-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> @jspook16 dude the pass is same but why pungo give me the new adress with no balance rather than my old address

[30-Dec-18 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> ok dude case closed

[30-Dec-18 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <yorklab> In the Agama Lite wallet if you have a different address it was because a different passphrase was used. When creating a new wallet copy the address then please be sure you can log back in using the same passphrase and check that it's the same address before transferring any funds into that wallet.

[30-Dec-18 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <yorklab> This would apply to any wallet used.

[30-Dec-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> If you didn't export your privatekey, or your seed file is encrypted and you can't decrypt it, then there is little we can do. I use Pungo and it works fine. It's based on the Agama seed generation.

[30-Dec-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I'll make a report to the Pungo team and look more into it.

[dscrd-cz] <kimmel (Peer2.group)> hi there @jony

[30-Dec-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <kimmel (Peer2.group)> most probably is related with seed

[30-Dec-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <kimmel (Peer2.group)> will catch you a bit later and try to assist you in the matter

[30-Dec-18 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> @kimmel (Peer2.group) it was solved

[30-Dec-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <kimmel (Peer2.group)> ok cool glad to hear

[30-Dec-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <kimmel (Peer2.group)> yes usually reinstalling works

[dscrd-cz] <NIXfra> Is nixplatform part of the project or not?
I don't understand. In the article does not mention Nixplatform but is tagged on the tweet

[08-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @NIXfra NIX is one of Chainzilla's partners and we tag partner projects in our tweets üôÇ

[08-Jan-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NIXfra> so nixplatform  is not part of the project? "Entre algunas compa√±√≠as que forman parte de esta iniciativa destacan NEM, PundiX, Komodo Platform, Synergy Criptoadviser y ChainZilla"
