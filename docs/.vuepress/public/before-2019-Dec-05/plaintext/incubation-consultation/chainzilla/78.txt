[BTC-BTC-BTC#4223] Does Magnum wallet supports all kmd tokens?

[09-Dec-18 03:52 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Not all KMD tokens yet but yes it has the capacity to do so. Chainzilla is Magnum's preferred onboarding partner. That means if a Komodo asset wants to be added to Magnum they should come to us and we will onboard them.

[09-Dec-18 03:53 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We are preparing the pricing sheets with the Magnum team. They will be ready in a week or so.

[09-Dec-18 05:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[LocoMB#8593] does chainzilla have a bitcointalk thread? 
troll infested and BTC maximalist censored as that place may be, it is still good for following a lot of trends

[09-Dec-18 05:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Bitcointalk has the lowest performance out of all the websites we promote. We are focusing on Facebook, medium, LinkedIn, Twitter, discord, Reddit, and telegram. We do update bct every now and then but it's not our demographic.

[09-Dec-18 05:51 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Since we don't have unlimited resources, low performing things need to be replaced with high performing and low cost solutions.

[09-Dec-18 05:53 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We're now using Google and Facebook ads which have a better reach at a lower cost and with more statistics

[09-Dec-18 05:54 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] The medium page I think is the main source of written content

[09-Dec-18 08:16 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gh√∏st#7639] The main goal of the bounty (including on the BT–°T forum) is the distribution of a small part of the coins among the community.
Real investment goes to the project another way.

[09-Dec-18 01:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Deri Septian Nugroho  UTC+8#7696] I agree with that, advertising on Facebook is indeed cheaper, but the reach on the bitcointalk is right on target that they are genuine krypto fans

[09-Dec-18 02:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Unknown so what you are trying to say is that we should focus our efforts on BCT because it has "genuine crypto fans"?

[09-Dec-18 02:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Have you ever done any marketing campaigns on BCT for extended periods of time and analyzed the traffic data back to your project?

[09-Dec-18 02:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @gh√∏st true, and 2 years ago I would have said BCT was the place to be for true believers. However, now we spend more time filtering out the bots when we run bounties and any sort of distribution campaign. The same goes for most channels but BCT is full of people that make profits off signing up to as many bounties as possible and dumping as early as possible.  Discord has done a better job a trickling bounties than BCT.

[09-Dec-18 02:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] At the end of the day, we try to make decisions based on the numbers. BCT has been put to the side because it wasn't yielding results. Simple as that.

[09-Dec-18 06:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gh√∏st#7639] @PTYX 
"BCT has been put to the side because it wasn't yielding results..."

And what results did you expect from BT–°T?
 (signature campaign)?

[09-Dec-18 06:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We are looking for traffic. When we post across channels, we look at which posts brought more traffic to the website. We also tried the signature campaign. That brought minimal traffic. So no results overall. I'm sure there are projects who make bct work for them, mostly mining projects.

[09-Dec-18 06:25 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gh√∏st#7639] You had an extremely small payment per signature.
And the limit is the senior - minimum.

I can say my opinion, no more:
- Or quantity (from junior)
- Or quality (the best authors)

[09-Dec-18 06:25 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gh√∏st#7639] 7 people of whom only one wrote fine

[09-Dec-18 06:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Everyone has their opinion about the matter.

[09-Dec-18 06:27 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I respect and appreciate your opinion but we have a clear path set. I'm not diverging resources to support forums that don't drive any traffic or generate any business.

[09-Dec-18 06:27 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gh√∏st#7639] $ 25 in a coin for a senior is statistically very small. (week)

[09-Dec-18 06:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We used other bounties as a benchmark. The bitblend bounty to be specific.

[09-Dec-18 06:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gh√∏st#7639] We just talk.
 decide - only you.

[09-Dec-18 06:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gh√∏st#7639] By the way, now the forum is becoming cleaner, it nice to read

[09-Dec-18 06:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] There's some nice conversation there. I don't visit it much anymore unless it's for an update but it used to the hub for all good projects.

[miles#6381] @PTYX thanks for the video on ledger rewards via magnum :zilla3:  - i gave it a try but when i access my nano the the wallet recognises a KMD address that isn't the ones that i have set up and use in Ledger Live. (i have three different KMD addresses in Ledger Live) I tried searching for the a fourth account within Ledger live to add it in but it doesn't find the address that shows in Magnum - anyone seen this or know who where to raise the issue?

[10-Dec-18 01:14 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @miles yes I've faced this and understand your confusion. I gave @Magnum Wallet the suggestion of a sweep function for those who have the kmd spread out in a few addresses across the ledger.

[10-Dec-18 01:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] For now as you mentioned, the solution is finding the correct address path and import then manually into the Mangum dashboard.

[10-Dec-18 01:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] thanks @PTYX, will have a further play around with address paths
