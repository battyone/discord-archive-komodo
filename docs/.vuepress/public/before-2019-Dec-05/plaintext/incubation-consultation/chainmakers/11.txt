Hi. How do I get started ? Need a special one for my games. üòÉ

[12-Feb-19 09:47 PM] fredrik#2289
Looking for a starter kit.

[12-Feb-19 09:48 PM] fredrik#2289
Can I deicide in how many blocks per day I want in my chain as an example!? I m thinking about using it as a full backend for my game time.

[12-Feb-19 09:50 PM] jl777c#5810
latest versions has -ac_blocktime where you can set the number of seconds per block

[12-Feb-19 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> We need to start by evaluating the games you want to integrate

[12-Feb-19 10:05 PM] fredrik#2289
Sweet that sounds great. how do you mean Gateway? Its a work in progress, I am not free to setup and start testing and poking around on my own? Hmm.

[12-Feb-19 10:06 PM] jl777c#5810
why do you say that?

[12-Feb-19 10:06 PM] fredrik#2289
Maybe, hmm I need to think and read some more first.

[12-Feb-19 10:06 PM] fredrik#2289
It‚Äôs not finished and decisions haven‚Äôt been made. Sure I need to think more.

[12-Feb-19 10:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, if its just about lookinf for chain parameters then, what jl777 just linked is correct

[12-Feb-19 10:13 PM] fredrik#2289
Interesting. It‚Äôs quite complex. Maybe I get away with just following the Komodo chain itself through api calls. I need to sit down and have some brain food.

[12-Feb-19 10:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We can always do a managed service for you.

[13-Feb-19 10:47 AM] fredrik#2289
Sick! that would be quite something.

[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> Hi guys, we want to officialize our candidacy for re-election of our North America Region node. Remember that we depend a lot on these nodes to have continuity of our business and dont receive any further investment other than the revenue from our services and these notary nodes. We leave our proposal attached to this message so that you can take a look and share it with your peers. We count with your vote!

Didnt you have 2 nodes? Or is one auto reelected?

[30-Mar-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> One is auto reelected

[30-Mar-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> Second one will need to go to re-election

[30-Mar-19 08:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
