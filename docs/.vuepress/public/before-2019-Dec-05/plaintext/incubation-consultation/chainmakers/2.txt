[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> does the footer logo still doesnt show?

[13-Aug-18 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <barbierir> I can't see a logo in the footer, the links in the footer work normally from the main page, only if I enter a team member profile all links are dead except to the main page

[13-Aug-18 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <barbierir> tested on Chrome too

[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> should show a logo below the test in the contact form

[13-Aug-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <barbierir> ah yes that logo is there

[13-Aug-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <barbierir> it's not clickable

[13-Aug-18 05:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No. Doesnt need to be clickable

[13-Aug-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <Cryptoon> footer logo works

[13-Aug-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <Cryptoon> from the teammember page links still not clickable though, I think it's because they refer to something that is not on that page

[13-Aug-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> The menu looks right though

[13-Aug-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> Will see if i can fix it

[25-Aug-18 12:25 PM] Robert Naus#9564
Anyone from the team have a few minutes for me in private chat?

[dscrd-chnmkrs] <Cryptoon> chain spv server seems down or agama isnt connecting with it fyi

[28-Sep-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> Hmm, thanks

[28-Sep-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <Cryptoon> glx not either, but I think that might be deliberate?

[28-Sep-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> Yes, they took down the servers

[28-Sep-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <Cryptoon> ah k, because ronald is asking for txid's for when I bought some glx on hyperdex, but cant look them up anymore on atomicexplorer

[28-Sep-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <Cryptoon> But at some point I had to remove appdata for hyperdex because of some issues and so cant look it up like that anymore

[28-Sep-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chnmkrs] <Cryptoon> isnt that one the same as the one atomicexplorer is using?

[28-Sep-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> Yeah i fixed the link now

[28-Sep-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <Cryptoon> Ok, now to find out how much kmd I paid

[28-Sep-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> Using the same address in kmd explorer and looking up the transaction around the same date should work

[28-Sep-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <Cryptoon> yeah found it

[28-Sep-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <Cryptoon> Sent to Ronald over glx, thanks for the help with the explorers üòÉ

[28-Sep-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> Cool. Good that you got your refund

[28-Sep-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <Cryptoon> Well didnt get it yet, but they did ask for tx ids etc... Only 30ish kmd worth or so (back when was worth 1,75$ though)

[10-Oct-18 04:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Hey guys, I just want to let you know I have had a KMD tipbot made for KMD discord.  
If you have your own discord, it will work there for KMD and you are free to use it.   

DM me for the link and I will get you setup with the creator.

[17-Oct-18 08:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
everyone Chainmakers has just created a coin named KMDICE

but before we get 'unfair mining' accusations, we want to announce right now

[17-Oct-18 08:55 PM] jorian#4555
it is being notarized as we speak, but until actual notarizations happen, it's not safe to play

[17-Oct-18 08:55 PM] jorian#4555
WTB KMDICE

[17-Oct-18 08:56 PM] manugarc#3097
it‚Äôs ok to mine?

[17-Oct-18 08:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Cpu mineable from agama or whats the best method?

[17-Oct-18 08:56 PM] jorian#4555
it's almost not cpu minable anymore...

[17-Oct-18 08:56 PM] jorian#4555
that era has passed

üò≠üò≠

[17-Oct-18 08:56 PM] jorian#4555
KMDICE has a coin supply of 21 million, of which 10.5 million has been premined

[17-Oct-18 08:57 PM] jorian#4555
this premine has gone into a fund

[17-Oct-18 08:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Some for CHAIN hodlers?

[17-Oct-18 08:57 PM] jorian#4555
we can think about that

[17-Oct-18 08:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Who owns/manages the fund?

[17-Oct-18 08:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Chainmakers/supernet/jl/?

[17-Oct-18 08:58 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499

[17-Oct-18 08:58 PM] jorian#4555
this fund is a dicefund, based on the CryptoConditions that have been tested and developed in the last weeks.

[17-Oct-18 09:00 PM] Raydeon#2053
Is there a website.

[17-Oct-18 09:00 PM] jorian#4555
what this basically means is that when you own KMDICE, you can use that to do some gambling. 
```minimum bet: 0.001
maximum bet: 1000
maximum odds: 1500
```
so, for example, you can bet 10 KMDICE at 5:1. if you win, you get 50 back

[17-Oct-18 09:00 PM] jorian#4555
website is being worked on as we speak

[17-Oct-18 09:01 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
Bet on what?

[17-Oct-18 09:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Betting, that I can do

[17-Oct-18 09:02 PM] crumb#2550
what makes it different from CHIPS? future functionality wise that is

[17-Oct-18 09:02 PM] jorian#4555
DICE, so if you bet 5:1, you have 1/5 chance you win. 6:1: 1/6. 60:1, 1/60

[17-Oct-18 09:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If only I betted Dries Mertens to pwn holland yesterday ü§î

[17-Oct-18 09:02 PM] dolladollaiv#3294
So the premine is essentially the "house"?

[17-Oct-18 09:02 PM] jorian#4555
yes

The degen inside will like this

[17-Oct-18 09:03 PM] crumb#2550
why use KMDICE instead of CHIPS as a gaming/betting token

[17-Oct-18 09:03 PM] jorian#4555
CHIPS is far from done

[17-Oct-18 09:04 PM] jorian#4555
and uses a completely different approach

[17-Oct-18 09:04 PM] jorian#4555
essentially, you will be able to do the same with CHIPS

[17-Oct-18 09:04 PM] jorian#4555
but CHIPS is not done yet. KMDICE is.

[17-Oct-18 09:04 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Kmdice has a ring to it also

[17-Oct-18 09:04 PM] crumb#2550

[17-Oct-18 09:05 PM] crumb#2550
so CHIPS and KMDICE are competitors

[17-Oct-18 09:05 PM] jorian#4555
CHIPS is useful, because it uses lightning channels

Are the bets event driven?

[17-Oct-18 09:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We think that with this coin we can move ahead development on top of Crypto Conditions.

[17-Oct-18 09:06 PM] jorian#4555
which means there are no on-chain transactions of whatever many transactions happen inside these channels

[17-Oct-18 09:06 PM] jorian#4555
this is useful for playing poker
