@grewalsatinder we already did our first notarization of KMDICE

[17-Oct-18 10:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
excellent!

[17-Oct-18 10:59 PM] SHossain#0007
protected by dPoW...more price

[17-Oct-18 10:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
none price

[17-Oct-18 10:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm the only buyer so far I see

[17-Oct-18 10:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
unless someone cuts me and gives you better price

[17-Oct-18 11:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I haven't even calculated how much it might be costing to mine

[17-Oct-18 11:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm away from computer to access server to even start mine

[17-Oct-18 11:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
just speculating and offering you something

[17-Oct-18 11:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄

[17-Oct-18 11:00 PM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 already started his GPU rigs

[17-Oct-18 11:00 PM] SHossain#0007
more miners will join

[17-Oct-18 11:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the price I offered is is obvious overly overly priced

[17-Oct-18 11:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain you must have missed the line where I said I was joking
I'm just now done eating supper and haven't sorted out network issues, but I will throw a few at it eventually

Pinned a message.

[17-Oct-18 11:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh yeah, i must have used an older komodod, blarg

[17-Oct-18 11:14 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
this is one of the reasons I need to buy miners @dukeleto - I dont want to miss the fun!

[17-Oct-18 11:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so  we now have a coin which 50% of the supply is locked in a dice game contract and the only way to get that 50% is by betting the other 50% of the supply against it

[17-Oct-18 11:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or if I mine and play, using the remaining 25% to get 75% out of the contract 😛

[17-Oct-18 11:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
would like to see that 😂

[17-Oct-18 11:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, let's see how my tiny poor linux laptop does with mining kmdice

[17-Oct-18 11:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I lost 80% of the time last dice I tried LOL

[17-Oct-18 11:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
probably just gonna burn itself and get nothin

[17-Oct-18 11:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄

[17-Oct-18 11:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
first notarization for KMDICE just passed through my iguana tv

[17-Oct-18 11:21 PM] SHossain#0007
we already started and had couple of them

[17-Oct-18 11:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, first one from my server

[17-Oct-18 11:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
holy crap! 😂

[17-Oct-18 11:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
expensive coin to mine?

[17-Oct-18 11:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's gonna be

[17-Oct-18 11:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's already shooting to mars in hashrate in such short span of time

[17-Oct-18 11:25 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
1 kmd to 1 KMDICE sound feasable?

{Reactions}
shexy 

[17-Oct-18 11:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and it's clearnet coin

[17-Oct-18 11:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so can be on exchange pretty quick

[17-Oct-18 11:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I won't pay 1 KMD for 1 DICE

[17-Oct-18 11:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
joke - but in all seriousness the difficulty makes it worth more right?

[17-Oct-18 11:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but consider me big buyer if someone wants to negotiate

[17-Oct-18 11:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll just try to mine it instead of buying

what are you offering to pay?

[17-Oct-18 11:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it got stuck 😂

[17-Oct-18 11:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
What sorcery is this?

[17-Oct-18 11:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 1 KMD for 1000 DICE

[17-Oct-18 11:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hehehe gambling and stuff

[17-Oct-18 11:29 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
So how does it work ,  meaning how does mining vs locked coins work

[17-Oct-18 11:30 PM] SHossain#0007
50% premine which is locked to dice game contract. mine the otrher 50% and play to win the first 50%

[17-Oct-18 11:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
who will win? 🤔

[17-Oct-18 11:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain I don't have it running yet, how many and what types of odds did you set up?

[17-Oct-18 11:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
minimum bet is 0.001

[17-Oct-18 11:31 PM] SHossain#0007
i didn't do anythig with the coin or game

[17-Oct-18 11:32 PM] SHossain#0007
it was @siu - Chainmakers @jorian

[17-Oct-18 11:32 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I can imagine with the difficulty it would be like 10 kmd for 100 DICE -- but I have no idea how long it takes to mine either - 10 KMD for 1000 DICE?? I guess the miners win this game
