Hi @jorian, it's me Kean here. Finally I've found you guys from the support room! Is it possible to setup a test dICO first (by creating a test AssetChain that has no value) so we know all the things we need to prepare in advance?

[13-Jul-18 10:22 AM] jorian#4555
@k50 I dm'ed you

Awesome job @siu - Chainmakers ,  will it begin on Sunday?

[13-Jul-18 11:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I can run a flash 48 hour KMD giveaway to buy into the dICO.    
Between the last three I've done, i've been able to garner about 200K views and thousands of interactions and over 100 entrants.
Glad to do it from my own KMD pile, just a few to get someone to buy in.   Maybe 25 of my own and 15 from @Alright (he donated 15 "kmd" to the last raffle right after it ended so I pushed it to this one).

[13-Jul-18 11:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If so I will spam it on twitter and people here can spam it for exposure.   Typically the entry requires a RT with three tags.   If you have any thoughts or ideas, I am all ears üòÉ

[13-Jul-18 11:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[dscrd-chnmkrs] <jorian> what is it

[26-Jul-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <Cryptoon> Or is the price people are offering higher than the price people are asking?

[26-Jul-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <jorian> buy is 0.00000001

Really want to run a raffle for KMD/GLX

I already bought glx? üòÑ

[09-Aug-18 11:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
GLX is developing its own iteration of some tools so they might take some time to go public.

[09-Aug-18 11:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They have not backed down or anything.

[09-Aug-18 11:56 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
On the contrary, they have been working hard to get KMD tech to a better UX.

[09-Aug-18 07:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I chatted with some of the glx guys on their platform

[09-Aug-18 07:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Seem to know what they are doing

[09-Aug-18 07:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Platform needs some tweaking though

[09-Aug-18 07:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But if it takes off should be good

[10-Aug-18 08:18 PM] Ara#8697
Hi! Just wonder how mutch will be the yearly cost for using KOMODO main chain notarization for asset chain? In whitepaper it says 333KMD yearly. Is it still true, or price was changed?

[10-Aug-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> Hello! The price we charge for annual notarization is 300KMD and 800 of the coin being notarized

[10-Aug-18 08:43 PM] Ara#8697
Also can we use JUMBLR in asset chain?

[10-Aug-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> Yes... JUMBLR is integrated in every komodo blockchain

[10-Aug-18 08:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
is it really siu? I thought JUMBLR was just for KMD

[10-Aug-18 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, KMD only

[10-Aug-18 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the more jumblr in one chain the better

[10-Aug-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> That is weird since i see the jumblr rpc calls undrr the assetchains

[10-Aug-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> Im sorry. I verified. Even though the rpc calls are there for all assetchains. Its not reliable to jumblr funds on chains with low tx volume so its not activated on assetchains
