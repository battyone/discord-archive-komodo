maybe the people putting huge rigs to mine this might want to do a faucet or something :p

[17-Oct-18 11:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
GUI? when the community gets pumped and builds one

[17-Oct-18 11:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im sure one will be out in no time.

wish I had my rigs - Traded them on BarterDEX for PIZZA and BEER

one would think at $0.00129, someone would be willing to faucet 游땥

Just got another surprise from @KomodoPlatform community. There is a "Dice CC [Crypto Conditions]" smart contract made by jl777 in initial smart contracts. It's a Betting game. I just found a project has started around this smart contract. About 725+ minutes ago. @kmdchain...

@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 maybe can help with a pool? 游뱂

[17-Oct-18 11:51 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
Maybe, I have been working on a C++ pool (although it's a ways off from completion), but I might be putting up a nomp fork assetchain pool on friday

[17-Oct-18 11:54 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  can make a pool for assets very quickly

[17-Oct-18 11:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@siu - Chainmakers @jorian any money raised for this project ?

[17-Oct-18 11:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or funds put aside for it ?

[17-Oct-18 11:57 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@kmdkrazy making one and making it secure for your users aren't always things that can be done at the same speed 游땔

[17-Oct-18 11:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no, not at all. We thought about it, did it and got out of our hands

let me know if I could be of any help

[17-Oct-18 11:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but our guess is that miners themselves would like to fund any projects since adoption gets them more value

[17-Oct-18 11:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
anyway i can make a gui in jquery if you like

[17-Oct-18 11:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we are looking on ways to do a GUI

[17-Oct-18 11:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

@kmdkrazy I have 3 "easy" ways to add them (one written by STAKED clan), but I've debated on *all* because of the lack of value of most of the 0.0001 chains

[18-Oct-18 12:03 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
right

[18-Oct-18 12:03 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
STAKED is smk762

[18-Oct-18 12:04 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[18-Oct-18 12:04 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`STAKED is smk762`
huh?

[18-Oct-18 12:04 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I thought he wrote the pool scripts

[18-Oct-18 12:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Any pools yet

[18-Oct-18 12:04 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
maybe I am mistaken as always

[18-Oct-18 12:05 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@kmdkrazy I'm almost certain that joker wrote the multi-add scripts that is in the knomp fork

[18-Oct-18 12:06 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
tbh, I forget, that was 6 months ago

[18-Oct-18 12:06 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
then smk set up the server or something - anyway -- I know he can add value here

[18-Oct-18 12:07 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
he may have, I've been quite absent for the last month or so, and yes he likely would be

@siu - Chainmakers

[18-Oct-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We spent like what a week on dice on staked for Smk to make a GUI... We found there was no way to withdraw coins James told us to leave it as it had an attack vector and couldn't be used in production... BTW if lots of ppl play your going to need more than one chain, it doesn't like being tx flooded with bets.
