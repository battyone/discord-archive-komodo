or do we just need the last

[11-Jan-19 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No let me fix that

[11-Jan-19 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hes copied all of them... I was kind of thinking and making it at the same time... but nobody else was heer to give input at the time.

[11-Jan-19 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`{"src_chain":"CFEK", "dest_chain":"CFEKED", :src_sum":10, "export_txid": <txid>, "timeofexport":1546341430, "hex": <export tx full hex>, "payouts":<payouts hash> } `
` {"dest_chain":"CFEKED", "dest_sum":10, "import_txid": <txid>, "timeofimport":1546341430}`

[11-Jan-19 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that one... but we dont really need to log the import

[11-Jan-19 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The export needs to be saved somewhere it cna easily be retreived.

[11-Jan-19 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So if the script or a daemon dies, which is likely when trying to push through as many as possible.... you can go back ot the export and finish the import off.

[11-Jan-19 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think thats now right

[11-Jan-19 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can probably even remove amounts... its not like thats much extra data though.

[11-Jan-19 05:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Thanks @Alright when I get home I'll submit some scripts that someone else has already rendered obsolete once I submit the PR 💀

[11-Jan-19 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator plan is to still use the oracles for real time scores just to stress oracles

[11-Jan-19 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
but the script I wrote will pull the data directly from the chain

[11-Jan-19 05:28 AM] Alright#0419
script I wrote is going to be *slow* once there are a lot of people migrating, so it's really just for verification that oracles data is correct

[11-Jan-19 05:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so to clarify...
we're stress testing migrations, with the scoreboard showing participant rankings.
Migrations are summarised as a json object, and stored in an oracle because why not test that too?
the data stored in the oracles will be validated by @Alright 's script which asks the chain directly.
json data in oracles will be faster for near real-time visualisation purposes

[11-Jan-19 05:43 AM] Alright#0419
Yep, that's the idea

[11-Jan-19 05:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
coupla questions...
correct to assume a script to put data into oracle is pending? anyone assigned or am I the guy?
correct to assume there is an aggregation layer, such as a summary oracle? If not, is there a strategy in place to avoid slowdown from oracle bloat (query returning large number of records)?

[11-Jan-19 05:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
correct to assume an RPC is being created to generate the an array of json for each block? i.e. block summary can be aggregated before placement in oracle

[11-Jan-19 05:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and when's all this go down? I got a bit on the plate this weekend with dragonhound tweaks for @axo777 in prep for a presentation next week for alternative 3rd party use case

[11-Jan-19 05:49 AM] Alright#0419
weekend after this weekend should work, but it's not up to me

[11-Jan-19 05:49 AM] Alright#0419
I'd like to start promoting the tests at least a week before they will happen

[11-Jan-19 05:58 AM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator I can do the migrates oracles script if you like

[11-Jan-19 05:59 AM] Alright#0419
if you already have some idea of how you'll do it, please do it though

[11-Jan-19 06:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if there's an RPC, too easy. If not, I'll have a think about it over the next few days

[11-Jan-19 06:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
basically just be a tweak of exisitng code to pull the migrate data instead of GPS

[11-Jan-19 06:16 AM] Alright#0419
there is no rpc to see all oraclesdata for a given block if that's what you're saying

[11-Jan-19 06:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
i thought we were pulling migrate data?

[11-Jan-19 06:17 AM] Alright#0419
Oh misunderstood, joker made the `getimports` rpc which takes block height as first argument and shows all imports for that given block

[11-Jan-19 06:18 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cool, thought I remembered somehthing being said about that.

[11-Jan-19 06:18 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
will look at it over the weekend, sounds simple enough tho

[11-Jan-19 07:22 AM] Alright#0419
Added a shite readme to that repo, just needed to write out my thoughts while they were fresh. Still needs a lot of work

[11-Jan-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The idea, is that each person participating will have a registered pubkey/Raddress (I think its Radd thats used) 
This Raddress can be tallied with Alrights script. BUt this is for verification that cheating didnt happen after the fact. Not to track in real time, or use oracle.

[11-Jan-19 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The way it should work, is the migrate script itself should submit the JSON data to an oracle created by participant. Each participant should have his/her own oracle.
The oracle will serve as a log for completed exports and imports. The list of import txid's can be use to do GetRawTransaction which will have info about the export transaction(added  for explorer) if you need to do this... However as long as you dont cheat by placing fake data into your oracle doubt its needed. The verify script bty Alright will verify ppl didnt cheat. It will be easy to seem by looking at totals. 
The export tx should log enough data so that you can take this oracle entry and resume you migrate in case something goes wrong.

[11-Jan-19 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

[11-Jan-19 07:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cheers. btw, got an update for crosschains.cpp, but cant find it to test the "fix"

[11-Jan-19 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I also propose only to log the data once the transaction has been notarised to avoid reorgs messing the data up.

[11-Jan-19 07:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
```            + HelpExampleCli("getmigrates", "\"00000000febc373a1da2bd9f887b105ad79ddc26ac26c2b28652d64e5207c5b5\"")

[11-Jan-19 07:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`getmigrates` should be `getimports`

[11-Jan-19 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I already fixed one of those, m,aybe not all . fixing now. About to push new version anyway.

👍 

[11-Jan-19 07:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
my plan so far is to call getimports on `getinfo.blocks-10`, and aggregate per block for vis

{Reactions}
👌 

[11-Jan-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok... cool as

[11-Jan-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  smk is going to do vis

[11-Jan-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this doesnt have anything to do with oracles... you can do the oracle log in the migrate sctipt yeah?

[11-Jan-19 07:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
` komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKX getimports $(echo $(komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKX getinfo | jq '.blocks')-10 | bc)`

[11-Jan-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah that should work fine... the RPC itself is very fast

[11-Jan-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but processign the data that comes in may not be... only 10 blocks might be ok

[11-Jan-19 07:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
10 blocks back enough to assume its notarised?

[11-Jan-19 07:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
easy enoough to go back further for safety

[11-Jan-19 07:59 AM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator you can use dpowconfs, the "confirmations" field will remain at 1 until the tx is notarized

[11-Jan-19 08:00 AM] Alright#0419
once notarized it will show the actual confirmation count

[11-Jan-19 08:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
confirmations > 1 is all you need to use.

[11-Jan-19 08:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I chaged waitforconfirm in my bash migrate script to that and it helped a LOT

[11-Jan-19 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also slowed down polls.... seems to get very large numbers of paralell migrates you need to almost never poll... do each step the random sleep for 5-10 mins so it has a very high chance of sucess when it does the RPC, otherwise the daemon starts failing to respoind.

[11-Jan-19 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is with like 4000-6000 migrate scripts going at once... lol

[11-Jan-19 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hjoping to get that up to 20,000 or so per node 😄

[11-Jan-19 08:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm familiar with the waitfor confirmation   bit in the migration script, will look closer and tap in

[11-Jan-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah just make it greater than 1, it wont proceed past 1 until the tx is notarised. I think Alright is going to have a go at that part though, you can focus on vis stuff if you like. I promise we wont do that before you finish it.

Pushed new version... help output is fixed... getlastsegidstakes is now much better. Shows PoW block total, and PoS %, so you can now get PoS % over an entire chain, rather than just a running average. MGNX looks pretty close, if not perfect. So algo is good.

{Reactions}
🔥 

[11-Jan-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
found a few weird things ... Not sure really but I got the segid working on all RPC calls and it returns the right value... Seems it cant persist after restart So I cahnged it so it can be set where it used to be, along with the new place I added to "make it work" before. 35000 blocks takes a few seconds, though this is on nvme drive.

[11-Jan-19 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Staking script is working perfectly for staking now. 😃

[11-Jan-19 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
trying to figure out PoW ...

[11-Jan-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
new staking script pushed.... As alwyas once I started making it the idea changed slightly... I think this version is pretty decent. Need a controlled test with script vs, mining without -pubkey.

[11-Jan-19 02:35 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
that sounds pretty damn fast 🏎

[11-Jan-19 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181

If I could be assed... Id sync MGNX on my VM in  HDD on 8yr old hardware ..

[11-Jan-19 08:52 PM] Alright#0419
I made this scoreboard script work in real time. Not sure we need people submitting redundant unverified data to oracles other than to stress test oracles.

[11-Jan-19 08:53 PM] Alright#0419
it's still quite sloppy, will clean it up and push it when I'm available again

[12-Jan-19 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There needs to be a way to resume failed migrates guess I'll do it

[12-Jan-19 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
😅

[12-Jan-19 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am going to just keep working on staker for now. You guys will need to all work together to get this migrate stress test working... So far good progress has been made. Please try to communicate so things are not being done by more than one person at the same time, unless you are working together. 😃
