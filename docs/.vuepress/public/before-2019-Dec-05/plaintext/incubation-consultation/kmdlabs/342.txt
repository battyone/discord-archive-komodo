Is the`getmininginfo`usually inaccurate like that?

[22-Mar-19 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from what I saw, the chain didn't move for many hours, so it's not really "inaccurate" to say that the hashrate is 0

[22-Mar-19 02:04 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, I'll keep mining and see how it changes 😃

[22-Mar-19 02:10 PM] CrisF#3405
Interesting to see on http://oracle.earth/ntx_graph/

[23-Mar-19 12:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah DIMXY4 is either forked or deaded

[23-Mar-19 12:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There are some node who never notified me they are updated so this is a waiting game unless I re ping eveyone .

[23-Mar-19 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The new version is killing it on mainnet atm. But ifg any one single node is on the version that corrupts memory, then we willa all get -26 error.

[23-Mar-19 01:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Short of pinging everyone and changing port we cant do a lot. I expect there to be some updates for teoken migrate so While I work on payments CC we can jsut keep waiting for ppl to update. If I dont have a list of everyone by the end of today I will change the port.

`Yeah DIMXY4 is either forked or deaded`
would have to be the former

[23-Mar-19 01:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
can you mine a block at all?

[23-Mar-19 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Is it just Alright seed node, or has something actualy broken it

[23-Mar-19 01:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm only running NN for anything besides KMD, so I'm not sure

[23-Mar-19 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the change was a hard fork, so its no issue to just remove that cluster. I was just going to use them to work out burn tx size limits... but I think I need to redo that whole thing later on after tokens are finished off.

[23-Mar-19 01:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Something Im going to have to come back to. For now just dont worry about anything thats happening. Like I said, iguana ha d possible memory corruption issues, and if 100% of nodes are not updated, then we cant know if the fix fixed it.

[23-Mar-19 01:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
however the 3 nodes on mainnet using this iguana, are working very very welll now with the latest build. So I do think its fine.

Hi, fyi I'm mining on NN and getting some blocks.  Not notorized since running out of UTXOs, surprise surprise.  Will just play around with it but not worry.

[23-Mar-19 01:53 AM] CrisF#3405
There are a couple of testimonials up on the website now that can be seen here: `https://kmdlabs.com/how-kmdlabs-works`.

[23-Mar-19 01:53 AM] CrisF#3405
Another should be coming in soon.

[23-Mar-19 01:54 AM] CrisF#3405
If anyone has any suggestions on others who would be interested in writing a sentence or 3 please let me know.

[23-Mar-19 01:54 AM] CrisF#3405
Also on `https://kmdlabs.com/how-kmdlabs-works` is a diagram that is in the early stages of creation (very bottom of page).

[23-Mar-19 01:56 AM] CrisF#3405
It's got a lot to go but feedback would be appreaciated.  That kind of thing is far from my strong suit.

[23-Mar-19 01:57 AM] CrisF#3405
Will add info to diagram as I figure out to do it.

[23-Mar-19 02:04 AM] CrisF#3405
`DIMXY4` notarized here.  UTXOs seem to help :abusedsmily:

[23-Mar-19 02:12 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @27aume 👋 
Alright mentioned that you might have created `https://www.draw.io/`.  If that's the case, thanks!  It's an amazing piece of work!!

[23-Mar-19 03:03 AM] Mylo#8306
can i get my keys notarizing this weekend?

[23-Mar-19 03:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
car keys or house keys?

[23-Mar-19 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Mylo  I think so yes. We need to force an update and change of port I think anyway to make sure the mem corruption issue is fixed

[23-Mar-19 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am busy atm please DM pubkey and I will chuck it int he code. Will come back to era change later on. I'm pretty sure it all works without restarting anything, unless the port is changed.

[23-Mar-19 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So maybe we cant change the port to test that.

[23-Mar-19 05:56 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah no rush, will DM you in few moments

[23-Mar-19 06:16 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, maybe it's  because I'm mining `DIMXY4` on NN it's not splitting notarization UTXOs.  There were quite a few UTXOs, but none notarization sized it seems.

[23-Mar-19 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wasnt able to split 4 for a failyt long time. I just ignored it.. we hard forked those chains anything could have happened to them

[23-Mar-19 06:53 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, happy to have a bit more of a clue what's going on.  Nice to finally figure something out by myself, haha.

[23-Mar-19 06:55 AM] CrisF#3405
See that `DIMXY5` now has the `top stack` error now. 
Will the port change today?

[23-Mar-19 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No I doubt it.

[23-Mar-19 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is nothing we can do about that error until everyone is on the latest iguana

[23-Mar-19 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems to be working perfectly on mainnet...

[23-Mar-19 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but only 3 nodes are using it... No idea who is and isnt using ti here. I would say we need new chains sometime soon so Im just leaving it until then.

[23-Mar-19 08:43 AM] CrisF#3405
👍  That sounds good.

[23-Mar-19 12:54 PM] 27aume#8635
@CrisF No sorry I havent created this website, what I've created is the Mindmap Jl777 posted in Ask_jl777 channel. 
Its need to be updated still. Thanks for asking

```Hi everyone``` Could you please have look at the diagrams here: `https://kmdlabs.com/how-kmdlabs-works`.  I need some help with them, the information they contain in particular which can also be found and edited here: `https://kmdlabs.cc/p/KMDLabs_-_How_it_work`.

[23-Mar-19 01:22 PM] CrisF#3405
The diagrams need a lot more work also so please don't think of them as anything like a finished product.

[23-Mar-19 01:23 PM] CrisF#3405

anyone got recommendations for server providers to be used as a KMD NN?

[24-Mar-19 06:02 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
The latest komodod build is screwing with my VPS control-panel - the damn thing eats up 100% of available memory and then keeps it in cache.
note - komodod only, the assets don't do this.
I've tried 8G/8G (mem/swp) and 12G/8G - same result - all mem used then it stops eating more (doesn't touch the swap).
I know it's not actually using 100% of the mem - just the way it's tying cache is annoying.

[24-Mar-19 06:59 PM] MyName#0491
@Bar_F1sh_Rel if you sort out why, let us know
in everything I've ever done I've never seen KMD komodod go much over 3G much less hit 12

[25-Mar-19 06:49 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@TonyL yes - I know this behavior in Linux - but this is new for komodo. I know that komodod settles at 3G actually in use but Reserving so much might be a sign of something more - or not.

[25-Mar-19 07:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah it could be, I have noticed that LABS komodod does reserve more ram than normal. May have a leak or something.

[25-Mar-19 07:19 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
It has changed between versions - this is something new.
I have two LABS versions running on standard nodes - older one doesn't put enough pressure on the memory balloon to release more than 4G (of 8G).

[25-Mar-19 07:24 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I did wonder if this was linked to the changes made to release memory in cached chain memory blocks - as each cache memory block would be released by komodod, but not by Linux.

[25-Mar-19 07:25 AM] MyName#0491
@Bar_F1sh_Rel What OS are you running?

[25-Mar-19 07:25 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834

maybe something OS related then?

[25-Mar-19 07:31 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
could be - I'll try updating the older node to the same os release later

[25-Mar-19 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will check mine out aswell.. We have pulled down upstream things and I also changed a fair bit of stuff in our build.

[25-Mar-19 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
definatly possible a bug was added

[25-Mar-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm doesnt seem to ahve any mem problems here on my notary.

[25-Mar-19 10:16 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
It's not a mem problem - usage (actual) is quite low. Its how it is caching during load.

[25-Mar-19 10:18 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
It will only affect VPS hosts using ballooning.

We still have people who haven't updated. This is causing problems on the iguana network. Essentially, someone is poisoning notarizations. If you are up to date, please leave 👌 on this post. We'll give it a day or so then we're going to fork these bad nodes off the network. We'll be adding Mylo back and removing anyone who is poisoning the network with an era change. @LabsAssistant

[27-Mar-19 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pushed preliminary update, merged jl777 branch down and changed `build.sh` to use customCClib. Mylos key is already in the code, just waiting on merge for tokens updates from dimxy, then we can do a port change and launch new chains. 
I am starting on CC today for chain creation. Seems extremly easy to get done, although I would rather use a normal CC for it, will do it in customCC for now as its going to be a lot faster to get working that way.

[27-Mar-19 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This current merge gets us payments CC btw @Alright. 
Also I think the ac_nk params (at least when not being used) seem to cause no problems so far. So maybe we can try some params out on the new chains once the tokens merge gets here.

Ok I finally got there after starting agin 3 times 😅  
I ahve it creating the OP_RETURN and decoding it, but so far havent made a chain and actualy burnt the coins, but its printing all the required infoa nd all the functions work. Was surprisingly easy usign teh customCC template, but its not exactly useful as it stands...

[27-Mar-19 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
most of the battle was with cJSON lol.

…how to add it as an actaul CC, rather than custom lib. Works for testing though.

[27-Mar-19 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe we can make a `labs.so` and ahve that mandatory for all labs chains... It seems we can have lots of CCs in each lib.

[27-Mar-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
to make a new CC address for built in:
getnewaddress
validateaddress <newaddr>
change if ( 0 ) -> if ( 1 ) in CCutils.cpp Myprivkey
launch with -pubkey=<pubkey>
do anything to use Myprivkey and this will print the privkey array
add all the #define in CCcustom.cpp and make sure to set the cp-> vars in CCinit
of course add EVAL_newcode in eval.h

{Reactions}
💯 

[27-Mar-19 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thanks... I already thaught of improvements to this. So will work on adding that as a built in CC tomorrow I think. The ahrd part is done. I think once I get a bit more used to the cJSON stuff this will become a lot easier.

[27-Mar-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
use the jxxx functions for easy using of cJSON

[27-Mar-19 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I found the incliude file and just reading through them to see what ones I need

[27-Mar-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
just remember that cJSON_Parse allocates memory and free_json() is needed to free recursively

{Reactions}
👍 

[27-Mar-19 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I got that part from iguana. I guess you need to make sure all the `free_json` are inside ifs to make sure the ponter was allocated first. 😃

[27-Mar-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
yes that would be cool

[27-Mar-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
RLABS or RLabs or something would be fine, shouldnt take him long

[27-Mar-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
not RBurn?

[27-Mar-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
or it will become a multifunction CC

[27-Mar-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess the CC is really jsut a CC to burn coins

[27-Mar-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The RPCs are currently only for taking a JSON as input for chain params... but the CC itself can be used to just burn coins I guess

[27-Mar-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
also, nothing prevents having more than one global address per CC (other than whatever code that assumes that)

[27-Mar-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes i just used the unspendable... but because the validation will not allow any spends to occur I guess it can be anywhere

[27-Mar-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
you can just set the privkey to all 0 and make up whatever Raddress

[27-Mar-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
that is base58

[27-Mar-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
so valid checksum

[27-Mar-19 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sweet, may do that then.
