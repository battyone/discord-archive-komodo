I want to test that, but for sure wont be doing it ont he TROLL chain iteslf... i'll start another one just for a day or 2 and blast the crap out of it for a while

[11-Oct-18 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
2MB per minute isnt that bad but at a 2-3s block time ..

[11-Oct-18 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats going to add up so fast

[11-Oct-18 03:25 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
The minimally more decentralized that a chain would be over torrents isn't worth bringing more undue criticism, imo
"See, we told you only criminals use it"

[11-Oct-18 03:25 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
could you explain this to me please?

In most 1st world countries, it's a crime to share copyrighted tv material; you share the chain that contains the material, you commit a crime; you commit a crime; you are a criminal
Politicians and bankers don't need to know who you are to get on TV, radio, etc. and demonize what all the crypto space is
We're already on an uphill struggle, no sense to giving them another SilkRoad example

i still get left out of the notice @kmdkrazy  is a noob

[11-Oct-18 03:32 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
im just joking

[11-Oct-18 03:33 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
if you have an ANON chain - then what?

[11-Oct-18 03:34 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
do these countried have claim?

[11-Oct-18 03:35 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
can you not use Z addresses

[11-Oct-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the existence of such a chain is all the firepower they need; who individually uses it is irrelevant to pushing the narrative of "banks good, crypto thing bad"

[11-Oct-18 03:37 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
dude - you talk like jl777

[11-Oct-18 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol I take that as an extreme compliment

[11-Oct-18 03:38 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i would too

[11-Oct-18 03:39 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
do you speak english? or are you s troll bot?

[11-Oct-18 03:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
English is the only spoken language I know 😣

[11-Oct-18 03:44 PM] CMaurice#1685
@blackjok3r  done, thanks to tmux in termux

[11-Oct-18 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have an issue with one of mine, where it will only start with a rexync... starting fresh seems ok though.

[11-Oct-18 03:45 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
im ok..i know im am not the smartest banana in the bunch

[11-Oct-18 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks for updating so fast 😄

[11-Oct-18 03:45 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
git pull

[11-Oct-18 03:45 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
rebuild

[11-Oct-18 03:46 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
or just git pull

[11-Oct-18 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```[blackjok3r] : first message
: Corrupted block database detected.

error in HDD data, might just need to update to latest, if that doesnt work, then you need to resync
``` 😦

[11-Oct-18 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you don't build after pull, then the pull does nothing

[11-Oct-18 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
every time you start it

[11-Oct-18 03:46 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
fak

[11-Oct-18 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
these repos don't need any git pulling and shit

[11-Oct-18 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it does all that for you

[11-Oct-18 03:47 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
dude ....see you in an hour

[11-Oct-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just git pull

[11-Oct-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[11-Oct-18 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Starting it with -reindex is working for now

[11-Oct-18 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will need to track that one down, must be writing some invalid data, or not stopping correctly some how

[11-Oct-18 03:50 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
im going to wait

[11-Oct-18 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its ready for testring out of the `staked` repo

[11-Oct-18 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it worked for me at least

[11-Oct-18 03:52 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
last time i tried to keep up with your updates......it was futile

[11-Oct-18 03:52 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
slow your roll

[11-Oct-18 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha I cant see there being many updates for a while... I am cheating for now, and adding -reindex to the default start parameter 😂

[11-Oct-18 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unless genie has issues that are simple to fix

[11-Oct-18 03:55 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
do I have to rebuild?

[11-Oct-18 03:56 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
or does it  plug in?

[11-Oct-18 03:57 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
errase and restart?

`./start.sh STKDTROLL`

[11-Oct-18 03:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats it... there is pretty clear instaructions on how to use it... but you sent messages on the old chain, so it cant be that hard to figure out hwo to do the same thing 😉

[11-Oct-18 04:03 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
is it the only komodod that you built that works?

[11-Oct-18 04:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
use `git stash` to dump edits before pull

[11-Oct-18 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes ... the TROLL chain version of komodod ... is toally butchered..

[11-Oct-18 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it wouldnt run anything

[11-Oct-18 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nor will this chain load on anything else... hell it wont even load on its own daemon without a reindex every time at the moment 😂

[11-Oct-18 04:06 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
a noob made it work

{Reactions}
😂 

[11-Oct-18 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
initial sync is ok ... just if you stop it, you have to reindex it

[11-Oct-18 04:06 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
keep  going

[11-Oct-18 04:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I know whats wrong with it ...

[11-Oct-18 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its era realeted ...

[11-Oct-18 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not really importnat, if reindex fixes it its fine... we can just launch it with reindex everytime... I will make a new chain later. seems its got what it thinks is an invlaid notarisation. didnt mine enough blocks before dpow... need in increase minium asserchain length to more then 128 blocks.

[11-Oct-18 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
reindex is instant so meh ... we just use that for now

[11-Oct-18 05:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I fixed it

[11-Oct-18 05:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well technically I didnt.... I need to make a new chain at some point and see if that fails in the same way. but I removed hte failing chain verify check so it can load, and everything still seems to work 😄

[11-Oct-18 05:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It passes chainverify at level 1, but not level 2, 3 or 4. So I made it load with level 1, then once you call getinfo it loads everything else without crashing.

[11-Oct-18 05:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  you can test it now

[11-Oct-18 05:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I found another bug though aloong the way which is now fixed .

[11-Oct-18 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in a new chain, timestamp some how cna go into the past, and the chain got stuck on era 1. I added a reset in era 1 to set all other didera=1 to 0.

[11-Oct-18 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so on the next block, when the timestamp is right, it doesnt skip the era it should be in.

[11-Oct-18 05:16 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill stop testing and @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  can talk to himself

[11-Oct-18 05:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol i thuahg tyou were at work u said...

[11-Oct-18 05:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can test as well.. .i need to get some sleep

[11-Oct-18 05:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the chain loads

[11-Oct-18 05:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
everyhting works

[11-Oct-18 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its being notarised

[11-Oct-18 05:17 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill look at the break

lol sorry... I ran into 🐛

[11-Oct-18 05:18 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
do i have to rebuild or just pull

[11-Oct-18 05:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
