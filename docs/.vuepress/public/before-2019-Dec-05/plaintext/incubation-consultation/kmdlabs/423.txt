not so great tbh 游땍

[09-Jun-19 09:47 PM] AkiraX#8269
trying to learn about kmdlabs....thanks to genie here

[09-Jun-19 09:47 PM] AkiraX#8269
so helpful 游땏

[09-Jun-19 09:48 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 we need to redo a few days of work if we don't keep the CFEKBET1 running, so if you can, please live with it for now

[09-Jun-19 09:48 PM] Alright#0419
if it's a huge problem, we can remove it

[09-Jun-19 09:48 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
well, my problem is no one wants to be my friend, seems the only 15 peers I have are non-productive

[09-Jun-19 09:48 PM] AkiraX#8269
one thing is strange is the difficulty doesnt match on labs.explorer.dexstats.info with mininglabs.rocks

[09-Jun-19 09:49 PM] AkiraX#8269
help me out

[09-Jun-19 09:49 PM] AkiraX#8269
and i guess i can be a peer

[09-Jun-19 09:49 PM] AkiraX#8269
walk me through it

[09-Jun-19 09:49 PM] Alright#0419
difficulty changes based on POS %, so it's not a good number to look at unless you understand how pos64 works

[09-Jun-19 09:50 PM] AkiraX#8269
ok.  let me know how i can help test things

[09-Jun-19 09:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Strange these nodes bans hmm

[09-Jun-19 09:50 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
mininglabs.rocks overpays you to mine, that's all you need to know 游땴

[09-Jun-19 09:50 PM] Alright#0419
@AkiraX he's talking about a test chain, don't really need additional people on that network atm

[09-Jun-19 09:50 PM] TonyL#3577
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 Can you try to start with reindex manually with latest `pricescomp` branch daemon?

[09-Jun-19 09:50 PM] AkiraX#8269
oh in that case letme switch back to mining it

[09-Jun-19 09:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe something feking on params parsing from json

[09-Jun-19 09:51 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@TonyL yeah, I'll play with it in a few hrs, just needed to know if it was me or borked atm

[09-Jun-19 09:51 PM] TonyL#3577
I've tried to start manually 2 nodes - had no problems

[09-Jun-19 09:52 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
well, I wanted to be sure before I did anything other than reset wallet, it's been running for days with 0 KMD

[09-Jun-19 09:52 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
:ashamed:

[09-Jun-19 09:53 PM] TonyL#3577
I have an idea that something went wrong with one of the latest fixes, and lets say not everybody updated

[09-Jun-19 09:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Because if nodes banning other nodes it's most probable reason

[09-Jun-19 09:54 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 make sure your system clock is ntp'd

[09-Jun-19 09:55 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
my last pricescomp update was Tuesday

[09-Jun-19 09:55 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`make sure your system clock is ntp'd`
at some point you're going to stop telling me that

[09-Jun-19 09:55 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it's always right

[09-Jun-19 09:57 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it's been one of the 1st things I do ever since off times started screwing up my stakes on the original tests (predating MGNX even)

[09-Jun-19 10:09 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 CFEKBET1 seems fine to me, the problem I was talking about involves bootstrapping peers for it

[09-Jun-19 10:09 PM] Alright#0419
if you can get past the initial sync, and it makes a proper peers.dat, should be fine

[09-Jun-19 10:09 PM] Alright#0419
the problem is that on a fresh sync(no data dir), it's not trying to open connections with all the addnodes

[09-Jun-19 10:10 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
k

[09-Jun-19 10:10 PM] Alright#0419
it tries to open a connection with 1, and if it fails, it won't sync at all

[09-Jun-19 10:12 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@TonyL rebuild is working

[09-Jun-19 10:14 PM] TonyL#3577
So it seems that outdated daemon was the problem?

[09-Jun-19 10:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Btw is start.sh checking versions for both master and pricescomp?

[09-Jun-19 10:14 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[09-Jun-19 10:15 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
yes and yes

[09-Jun-19 10:16 PM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary/blob/master/start.sh#L129 hmm I can see updates checking only for master

https://github.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary/blob/master/assetchains.json#L52 might be addnodes declaration as a list the problem?

[09-Jun-19 10:21 PM] Alright#0419
@TonyL if you're talking about the problem I described, it's not

[09-Jun-19 10:21 PM] Alright#0419
I was doing it via cli without the json

[09-Jun-19 10:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, ok

[09-Jun-19 10:21 PM] Alright#0419
and start.sh has an exception for addnode list

[09-Jun-19 10:21 PM] Alright#0419
or rather one of the bash scripts that start.sh calls does 游땍

[09-Jun-19 10:22 PM] Alright#0419
has anyone tried OceanQT on LABS?

[09-Jun-19 10:22 PM] Alright#0419
never used it before, but we're going to need a wallet....

[09-Jun-19 10:23 PM] Alright#0419
oh I guess LABS stuff needs to be merged into QT repo or vice versa

[09-Jun-19 10:26 PM] Alright#0419
`2019-06-09 22:23:41 socket recv error Connection reset by peer (104)` the prices chains errors seem to boil down to lots of these

[09-Jun-19 10:27 PM] Alright#0419
not sure how to debug why this is happening, guess I need  to see it from both sides

[09-Jun-19 10:27 PM] Alright#0419
@AkiraX that was a joke 游땍

[09-Jun-19 10:28 PM] AkiraX#8269

going to try to stake kmdlabs with this machine

[09-Jun-19 10:29 PM] Alright#0419
this is easily the best channel to ask for help

[09-Jun-19 10:30 PM] Alright#0419
that is you staking

[09-Jun-19 10:30 PM] Alright#0419
you should use pos64staker though, just saying

[09-Jun-19 10:30 PM] AkiraX#8269
i just build the komodo cli from github from jl777

[09-Jun-19 10:30 PM] AkiraX#8269

[09-Jun-19 10:31 PM] Alright#0419
what is it you're trying to do?

[09-Jun-19 10:32 PM] AkiraX#8269
import my key into a komodo and stake it

[09-Jun-19 10:33 PM] AkiraX#8269
theres no wallet right?

[09-Jun-19 10:33 PM] AkiraX#8269
how do i stake?

[09-Jun-19 10:33 PM] AkiraX#8269
just use pos staker 64?

[09-Jun-19 10:33 PM] AkiraX#8269
no need for komodod running?

[09-Jun-19 10:33 PM] Alright#0419
do you have komodod built already?

[09-Jun-19 10:33 PM] Alright#0419
if so, what branch did you use?

[09-Jun-19 10:34 PM] AkiraX#8269
i think i used the master branch

[09-Jun-19 10:34 PM] AkiraX#8269
how do i change to dev branch?

[09-Jun-19 10:34 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[09-Jun-19 10:34 PM] Alright#0419
or beta

[09-Jun-19 10:34 PM] Alright#0419
then rebuild it

[09-Jun-19 10:35 PM] Alright#0419
you used our repo or jl's repo?

[09-Jun-19 10:35 PM] AkiraX#8269
jl

[09-Jun-19 10:35 PM] Alright#0419
yea, so use beta or dev and rebuild it

not really sure where to start on the CFEKBET1 chain, I just synced it from scratch and it worked, but it was quite slow and rejected some blocks for a while, then accepted them again and managed to sync while printing lots of these:
`error komodo_pricecorrelated for ht.3275 ind.126
height.3275`

[10-Jun-19 10:06 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I want to create and sell a stable coin..
I think I'm ready to hird a dev and pay.
AMD probably a lawyer

[10-Jun-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
BET1 forked from the changes I made to get itsync. Seems it haad unintended concequences. I will return to it after hard fork or if I run out of things to do this week.

[10-Jun-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Please dont worry about anything that is wrong with it. And its best if youleave nodes in the state they are in, it will be easier to debug it I think.

[10-Jun-19 10:15 AM] gcharang#6833
@kmdkrazy 
you can do it with a KMD assetchain right now
there is something called "selfimport" can be used to create new coins whenever you wish
the major obstacle is connection with fiat world
if you can solve that, the tech side is "easy"

[10-Jun-19 10:17 AM] gcharang#6833
all the problems tether is facing is because people have been attacking this connection, i.e., their bank accounts

[10-Jun-19 10:25 AM] gcharang#6833
And if you can solve the bank account problem, you can compete with Visa and Mastercard
not in a roudabout way by increasing crypto adoption, but directly by  attracting businesses that just want to deal with dollars(no valatility like other crypto payment systems)
these businesses will be able to give their services 5% cheaper as they won't need to pay the transaction fees VISA etc demand
there will only be 1 significant fee, i.e., converting between your stable coin and the actual dollar
the rest is all on blockchain

[10-Jun-19 12:35 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I think I have the answer .....I'm going to sell the consumers products and allow them to recieve the product or Barter for Crypto...

[10-Jun-19 12:41 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
The buy in would or could use Western Union I believe with zero fees....I wonder if they have a shopping cart....let me look around and perfect this idea

[10-Jun-19 12:52 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Wrong about those fees
