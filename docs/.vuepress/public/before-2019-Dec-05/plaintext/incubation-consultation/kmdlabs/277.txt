it was staked4 airdropped to labst

[06-Feb-19 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Whoever was in the first notaristaion got paid 390 coins each üòÇ

[06-Feb-19 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the block reward was 0.27 coins

[06-Feb-19 10:57 AM] gt#2812
390 here

[06-Feb-19 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Do people think its a problem that notaris are getting paid in the first week, when there is slow block reward ramp up or should I change it so that it activates after the first week?

[06-Feb-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oops man not thinkging straight atm. Does that make sense? 
Notaries are getting paid the full amount but the block reward is not the full amount until block 10800 ?

[06-Feb-19 11:00 AM] Alright#0419
notaries getting paid full amount in the first week reintroduces the problem slow start solved

[06-Feb-19 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So should ntoaries get paid before block 10800 is what I'm asking?

[06-Feb-19 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they cna just start getting paid at block 10800 I dont see that as hard to change

[06-Feb-19 11:00 AM] jorian#4555
after a restart my LABST2 magically appeared

[06-Feb-19 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you did it on notary, it might have hit the wallet filter

[06-Feb-19 11:00 AM] Alright#0419
I'll pay them some KMD and we start at 10800? What's a fair amount of KMD for a week's notarizations

[06-Feb-19 11:00 AM] jorian#4555
then that's it

[06-Feb-19 11:02 AM] Alright#0419
notaries need at least a small stash of KMD for now, so that solves 2 problems

[06-Feb-19 11:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I guess we each need like 20 KMD at the start ? thats only 400 for everyone.. We still need that last pubkey @Mylo  or @jusoaresf  ? How do we decide who gets that spot? Min sigs 4 is too small for my likeing... if neither want it, we can add a dummy key... but i dont really like that either...

[06-Feb-19 11:04 AM] CrisF#3405
I'd like to change my IP for the final chain if that's possible.

[06-Feb-19 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes changing IP is fine, we can also accept new keys, as likely these ones were used on unsecure servers and things... I know I will def need to change mine.

[06-Feb-19 11:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool, that's great üëç

[06-Feb-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can pretty much change IP at any time, if things dont work properly, you just need to get it added to the repos IP list

{Reactions}
abusedsmily 

[06-Feb-19 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also I will need to get 8 ppls IPs that know it wont change any time soon for seeds btw... Those IPs will be in the komodod code and in the repo so only give it out if your sure of your VPS security.

[06-Feb-19 11:08 AM] jorian#4555
mine won't change

[06-Feb-19 11:09 AM] Alright#0419
NN IPs are public info anyway

[06-Feb-19 11:09 AM] jorian#4555
185.62.57.32

[06-Feb-19 11:09 AM] Alright#0419
your node should be secure regardless

[06-Feb-19 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah these are just more public than normal... yes... but itsbetter to have the MOST secure ones as seeds

[06-Feb-19 11:09 AM] Alright#0419
lose your key, lose your spot?

[06-Feb-19 11:09 AM] Alright#0419
do we have to have that stipulation? üòÇ

[06-Feb-19 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
right now it pretty much relies on my node... and if thats down things could just fail to work thats very bad

[06-Feb-19 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not sure... its pretty important... and chaging key on era change will be a PITA

[06-Feb-19 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
changing it before.. is impossile

[06-Feb-19 11:11 AM] Alright#0419
@Mylo I do believe you were the 21st to notarize LAMEDUCKS

[06-Feb-19 11:11 AM] Alright#0419
20th spot is your's as far as I know

[06-Feb-19 11:12 AM] CHMEX#0686
I tought I was the last

[06-Feb-19 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
one person dropped out

[06-Feb-19 11:12 AM] Alright#0419
you were 20

[06-Feb-19 11:12 AM] Alright#0419
mylo 21

[06-Feb-19 11:12 AM] CrisF#3405
You were CHMEX.

[06-Feb-19 11:12 AM] CHMEX#0686
Ok

[06-Feb-19 11:12 AM] Alright#0419
kmdkrazy gave up his spot

[06-Feb-19 11:12 AM] jorian#4555
can we reach all 20 now?

[06-Feb-19 11:13 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Lol tried to mine t2 - think I broke it

[06-Feb-19 11:13 AM] Alright#0419
with a stratum or daemon?

[06-Feb-19 11:13 AM] Alright#0419
stratum may break right now

[06-Feb-19 11:13 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Daemon

[06-Feb-19 11:13 AM] Alright#0419
and what happened?

[06-Feb-19 11:14 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Node is now not replying to rpc

[06-Feb-19 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm... there is apossibility that if the notarisation that you see doesnt match the chain your are currently on, you wont be able to mine that block... I can fix it but ti also means the block you do mine is likely on the wrong chain anywya

[06-Feb-19 11:14 AM] Alright#0419
can you check stdout?

[06-Feb-19 11:14 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Spamming notarization fail

[06-Feb-19 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yep

[06-Feb-19 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
restart it

[06-Feb-19 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will fix it... I have to do something about that for sure. Thanks for reporting.. its  ahard thing to catch... We tried to mine 300 blocks in 10 minutes to force it to happen and that didnt work... its just random..

[06-Feb-19 11:15 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Will try. Hard on phone.

[06-Feb-19 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All it needs to do is after the first time it tried to create the block, and the notarisation check comes back false... it needs to set a flag and then next block not add any notariations at all.

[06-Feb-19 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this should mean any actual invalid notarisation, will just live in mempool forever, and hopefully expire ü§û

[06-Feb-19 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The notarisaions are not actually invalid though... its just your daemon is on the wrong chain ( or it chose the notarisation out of order)

[06-Feb-19 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its very tricky thing to get working... as it was never designed to do this at all...

[06-Feb-19 11:19 AM] CrisF#3405
Can I kill the CFEKX & Y seed nodes now?

[06-Feb-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[06-Feb-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
likly one of those was on afork on Y btw

[06-Feb-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure what caused it...

[06-Feb-19 11:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, is there anything I need to keep from there?

[06-Feb-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no I dont think so

[06-Feb-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looks liek LABST2 has already stopped ... üòÖ

[06-Feb-19 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is notarisation in mempool stopping blcok bein created

[06-Feb-19 11:22 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, that's probably what happened when I was importing wallet..

[06-Feb-19 11:23 AM] CrisF#3405
KMD just requested  human help on restart.

[06-Feb-19 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... shit I got LABST2 moving again... but once there is a nnotarisation confirmed out of order it stuffs it up

[06-Feb-19 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ü§î

[06-Feb-19 11:33 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, same as @jorian , restart

[06-Feb-19 11:33 AM] CrisF#3405
had coins show up.  Not before.

[06-Feb-19 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if your doing this on ntoary its the walelt filter im pretty sure

[06-Feb-19 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have asked a few times if you guys wanted a flag/RPC to disable it?

[06-Feb-19 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also reproduiced miner lock up... easy fix to stop locking up..

[06-Feb-19 11:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, I don't understand.

[06-Feb-19 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
üòÖ  Sorry man.. The notary node has a wallet filter, StakedNotary README.md describes its functions

[06-Feb-19 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can add an RPC so you can disable/enable uit

[06-Feb-19 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think

[06-Feb-19 11:40 AM] CMaurice#1685
`[LABST2] Synced to 557, but no longest chain is found. Starting anyway.`

[06-Feb-19 11:40 AM] CMaurice#1685
and g'day

[06-Feb-19 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes the chain is stalled

[06-Feb-19 11:40 AM] CrisF#3405
The filter, yes, I read about that.  It's not a problem, just reporting.  The `importwallet` had no trouble.  Just needed the restart this time.  (Don't think it did before, but don't remember well)
