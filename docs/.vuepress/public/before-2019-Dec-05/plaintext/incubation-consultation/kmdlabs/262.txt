Then run it... Then do again

[01-Feb-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem is if we don't have some way of merging this dust we get paid... The wallet will slow down and notarizations become unreliable.

Currently only working on notary test branch

[01-Feb-19 12:08 PM] CMaurice#1685
now 15 heh

[01-Feb-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Mine was like 100 so seems it has worked

[01-Feb-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It skips the utxos u use for notarizations and merges all coinbase ( your pay) and any other utxo u have to one... Because all these tx happen to the notary address, wallet filter let's them all in

[01-Feb-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It will be a balancing act for each node to work out how often they need to merge... But at least it works.

rebooted and started fine

[01-Feb-19 12:48 PM] CrisF#3405
Update went very smoothly.
`NOTARYTEST` went from 199 to 14 for me.

`komodod: chain.cpp:162: CBlockIndex* CBlockIndex::GetAncestor(int): Assertion `pindexWalk->pprev' failed.`

[01-Feb-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Man that bug lol...it won't die!

[01-Feb-19 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`not sure what the problem is... I came in half way thourgh..`
@blackjok3r The "problem" is that alright would like to devise a "ranking" system where notaries can opt out of notarizing chains and they are still able to "rank" the same way as others that choose to notarize chains.
In other words if we have 10 chains and you notarize all 10 and I only notarize 3, I wouldn't rank below you just for ignoring 7 chains.

[01-Feb-19 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That doesnt after so much as u would get paid less

[01-Feb-19 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Which I think is his poi t

[01-Feb-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem with letting notaries choose which chain... Is it opens up attack vectors... If u read my commit comment u hopefully will understand

[01-Feb-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll be home soon for discussion I hope he rocks up... This needs to be sorted...

[01-Feb-19 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We can pay per notarization until whateverin SIG's of notaries decide to notarize more than freq... Nothing stopping them... There is some thing we can do with the code to mitigate this... But in the end all it does is slow things down... If every notary is forced to notarize... Then its more consensus .... Which solves all problems I think...

[01-Feb-19 01:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`notaries decide to notarize more than freq... Nothing stopping them... `
those are 2 separate topics 😛

[01-Feb-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not really...

[01-Feb-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If there is min SIG's of 6 with 20 notaries... Only 6 need to choose to notatise a chain... And can do basically what they like to the coin supply... If all of them are forced then those 6 would fork the chain by doing so

[01-Feb-19 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This has been the issue with this system from the start and seems to have almost no solution

[01-Feb-19 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Right, but code/consensus issues and concerns with how we get paid is separate from the conversation of how we keep our jobs

[01-Feb-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Only kind of...  Determining the "best notaries" is very hard... I this k we can throw it away entirely... If I can get eras to activate like sapling did

[01-Feb-19 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Pay per notarization model is brilliant... It solves a lot of issues... But not the best notaries one

[01-Feb-19 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
have all the notaries vote on who they think the best notaries are

{Reactions}
🤔 

[01-Feb-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If u can't vote for yourself.. Maybe that works

[01-Feb-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it will take into account the subjective factors that are hard to quantify

[01-Feb-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe just have a few categories to vote for each of the other notaries

[01-Feb-19 01:29 PM] CrisF#3405
`best Notary` is probably not the key.  `best Notarty network` is more what would create the best benefit.
Same as a team.  Team needs various skills / roles.

[01-Feb-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
excellent, good, average, bad, horrible

[01-Feb-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
with 5 categories, pentagrams can be created

[01-Feb-19 01:29 PM] CrisF#3405
And maybe best in different catagories...

[01-Feb-19 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[01-Feb-19 01:30 PM] CrisF#3405
Most total notarizations over all chains, most notarizations in time they've been notarizing...

[01-Feb-19 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it must take into account more than one metric... That is required

[01-Feb-19 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, since I seem to be the "odd man out" in this, can someone explain to me what is "wrong" with basing it on pure merit?

[01-Feb-19 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
How do u define merit?

[01-Feb-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
By basing it only on counts u introduce problems

[01-Feb-19 01:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`How do u define merit?`
Notaries notarize

[01-Feb-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If the code was "fair" then counts is fine

[01-Feb-19 01:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you don't notarize, you get no merit

[01-Feb-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But its not and we can't change it

[01-Feb-19 01:32 PM] gt#2812
i think one merit can lead to a race to one conclusion usually rather than maybe taking into other “merits”

💯 (2) 

[01-Feb-19 01:32 PM] CrisF#3405
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I agree with you.  Also with Alright.  You are both correct.

[01-Feb-19 01:33 PM] CrisF#3405
Which is best for this situation, well, that I'm still thinking on...

[01-Feb-19 01:33 PM] CrisF#3405
```What are effects of each on: 
1. network security
2. network performance
3. network dispersion

What are effects on NN:
(fairness, $ resources, including time, etc)
```

[01-Feb-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
With this system the "trust" in notaries is x1000 to what kmd has... It cannot just be about counts

[01-Feb-19 01:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`If the code was "fair" then counts is fine
But its not and we can't change it`
That's why I said percentages
if you willfully notarize 10% of that which you *could* notarize, then you measurably have less merit than someone that willfully notarized 20% of what they could

[01-Feb-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not really... I mean I'm not sure a-team is 3 today.. Is that just because everyone else is broken? Or did I do a better job?

[01-Feb-19 01:36 PM] CrisF#3405
I agree with that a lot.  Also feel there is a place for some 'hot shots' on a few chains.  What balance to make the best total mix... @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[01-Feb-19 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Nothing changed a lot on my end except that o realised that komodo_broadcast was giving me a disadvantage by having ports closed... So I took away the main Security mechanisim my node used... And opened all ports and stopped running 2 full nodes for every coin...

[01-Feb-19 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` I mean I'm not sure a-team is 3 today.. Is that just because everyone else is broken? Or did I do a better job?`
I think that might be a possible issue between 15th and 16th, but I think that in the long run there will be a noticeable gap and it's not going to be something that needs to be this overthought

[01-Feb-19 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
True... To a point....

[01-Feb-19 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My decision to place my node where I live and use my own hardware so I can upgrade what ever is needed at any time without issues.... Hurt me for most of the year... Now.. When this g start needing upgrades where u have control... I may pull ahead

[01-Feb-19 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Counts is a decent metric but its not the only 1 that should be taken into account

[01-Feb-19 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it takes 17 minutes to migrate to a new server, if a year's difference is close enough that 17 minutes matters then revisit the issue then

[01-Feb-19 01:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't see it ever being that close to be that big of an issue

[01-Feb-19 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we need so.e kind of vote as well... Counts is 50% vote 50% but how to do it?

[01-Feb-19 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Counts cannot be the only metric... And having notaries choose what to notarise isn't a great plan in the long term... Having multiple entire networks that choose what to notarize very well is fine... But not within a set of keya

[01-Feb-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if indeed only the total matters, then everyone can vote based on notarization counts
if however, extenuating circumstances arise that make it so deviations from that is needed, the votes can deviate

[01-Feb-19 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The best thing, and why I think it's a lot of overthought atm, is that we can get it all going and see what we see and down the line use factual data to determine what to do rather than trying to foresee every crystal ball outcome now

[01-Feb-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I agree the rules should be simple... What if we say 20 notaries are set for longer then 2 months and it depends how it goes when the next lot are chosen?

[01-Feb-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We really have no idea what we are doing here

[01-Feb-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And setting rules that we can't change at all.... Seems a bad idea and could ruin the project

[01-Feb-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If it fails it fails

[01-Feb-19 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`And setting rules that we can't change at all.... Seems a bad idea and could ruin the project`
That's what I was getting at with the last comment
We're at a point where we're creating a mental stumbling block over some *could be*s that might not even apply a year from now because live action got us to see a different way

[01-Feb-19 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Exactly...

[01-Feb-19 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we just need to get on with it and do it

[01-Feb-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Say first 20 notaries is 6 month's see how it goes? We can lower their pay of coin distribution to prevent us all becoming whales... But this introducees a whole new debate... I mean I changed it fro. 10% to 22% and none said anything 😂

[01-Feb-19 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, until there's actual value 10% of 0 = 20% of 0, so that bit is mostly just guess talk anyway

[01-Feb-19 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
setting all that aside....

[01-Feb-19 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Things to test/discuss:

    Create a block with 2 notarization transactions inside it...`
how many of us know *how* to do that?

[01-Feb-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its like impossible

[01-Feb-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like ... because its not... but its close to

[01-Feb-19 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And I don't mean that in a condescending way, but do we have enough folks that *can* manipulate tx order to get a meaningful sample size?

[01-Feb-19 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no... I outlined the possible attacks I see with the code I wrote

[01-Feb-19 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There may be things im not seeing btw

[01-Feb-19 02:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
k

[01-Feb-19 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I doubt very much that most people here can carry out those attacks....

[01-Feb-19 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Which is why I described how to do them... at least in a broad sense

[01-Feb-19 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Most require modifying iguana ... and collusion between min sigs

[01-Feb-19 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
some require mining a block at the correct time on top of that

[01-Feb-19 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Most require modifying iguana ...`
so, that means that 2 of you can 😛

[01-Feb-19 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I doubt even I could do the 2 notarisations in one block with the conesnsus as it is

[01-Feb-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its extremly unlikely

[01-Feb-19 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
will notaries attempt a 2nd notarization if a 1st attempt is never put into a block?

[01-Feb-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we cannot notarise unless KMD had 3 blocks for one... so thats a metric none of us can control

[01-Feb-19 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[01-Feb-19 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if 5 blocks passed

[01-Feb-19 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and the previous MoM is still what it was last round they just do it again including the new blocks

[01-Feb-19 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, then that's easyish to test

[01-Feb-19 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im most concerned about

[01-Feb-19 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
number 2

[01-Feb-19 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
When and if notarties produce an invalid notarisation

[01-Feb-19 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and it fails at connect block when the notarisation is deemed invalid... becasue the miner cannot really know that the notarisation is valid when he creates the block

[01-Feb-19 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and that tx will ping around the mempool invalidating any block its in

[01-Feb-19 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught maybe.... using saplingtx expiry time... but that cant work because it would amke any miner who accepts it to mempool mine invlaid block and the cahin would simply stop
