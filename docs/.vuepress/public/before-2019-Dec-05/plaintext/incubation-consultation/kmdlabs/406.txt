yea Tony, did you put a poll up on LABS?

[27-May-19 12:32 PM] Alright#0419
just waking up, didn't look at it @TonyL

[27-May-19 12:36 PM] Alright#0419
switched it over to LABS

[27-May-19 12:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Not yet, was not sure if poll a correct way. Oh and I'm getting ready to sleep - totally out of sync  üòÇ

[27-May-19 12:36 PM] Alright#0419
should just work, don't think anything changed

[27-May-19 12:37 PM] Alright#0419
yea that's what that dapp is for

[27-May-19 12:37 PM] Alright#0419
well not just for that, but designed with bounties in mind

[27-May-19 12:38 PM] Alright#0419
if you can tell me what to put, I'll make it

[27-May-19 12:38 PM] Alright#0419
you need 12 NNs to vote yes, so probably want to do it sooner than later

[27-May-19 12:40 PM] Alright#0419
1 "week" = 10080 blocks

[27-May-19 12:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Could you please create poll like a: "Allocate 1% of emission for next 10080 blocks from closest to 23:59 May 28 block for pricesCC testing" yes/no

[27-May-19 12:41 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm in bed with phone already - can do when wake up

[27-May-19 12:42 PM] Alright#0419
think we need to keep a schedule of sorts so like 10080-10080*2

[27-May-19 12:42 PM] TonyL#3577
It can take many weeks maybe this CC testing

[27-May-19 12:43 PM] TonyL#3577
So first week will be like a pilot one üòÄ

[27-May-19 12:43 PM] Alright#0419
yea well as I said before the only condition for a bounty is that it's not more than 1%(1008/week 1% on top actually) and >50% of notaries sign off on it

[27-May-19 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
typically(how I imagined it at least) you would be claiming this *after* a bug is found, but since you're running a comp of sorts, you should claim it as "give me the 1008 to allocate for this comp"

[27-May-19 12:45 PM] TonyL#3577
1 week iterations looks good - Notaries can decide if funds spending fine and is it have sense to continue this campaign funding

[27-May-19 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
Any word on what happened to Cris?

[27-May-19 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
@KMDLabs ??

[27-May-19 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_thinks any names that are project names and not associated with a project team member should get an insta-ban_

[27-May-19 12:54 PM] Alright#0419
I think that's Cris?

[27-May-19 12:55 PM] Alright#0419
yea wasn't a fan of it being named "KMDLabs" either

[27-May-19 12:55 PM] Alright#0419
it sent me this `HwlD0uOt61Cq42A61Z/U0LZrfatmz8MOf7P5AKcGnOg7JJjir5dFT1PFmj3j69DCSsxF+vIkdOb0PB/aeW4QTk4="I'm not an impersonator"`

[27-May-19 12:55 PM] Alright#0419
need to check it

[27-May-19 12:58 PM] Alright#0419
is signed from his NN key

[27-May-19 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
I do know what his voice sounds like, so I can confirm that as well when he's back

thanks for that @jorian

who is @KMDLabs btw

[27-May-19 01:03 PM] jorian#4555
i also saw a node-9 user a while back

[27-May-19 01:03 PM] jorian#4555
that was Cris's official notary node handle

[27-May-19 01:03 PM] Alright#0419
It's someone claiming to be Cris. Most likely is as it was able to produce a signed message from his NN key.

[27-May-19 01:04 PM] Alright#0419
I will hop on a voice call with him though to be 100%

[27-May-19 01:04 PM] Alright#0419
says he's locked out of @CrisF

[27-May-19 01:04 PM] Alright#0419
oh that account is showing as online O.o

or 0.5 LABS, but I'm not selling

[27-May-19 01:37 PM] Don King#8901
Is staking kmdlabs on Windows likely, is it worth mining without Linux skills?

[27-May-19 01:38 PM] Don King#8901
I mean like one click verus staking in agama

[27-May-19 01:40 PM] Alright#0419
We don't have a windows build right now. Should be available in Agama within a day or two. The POS mechanism is entirely different from Verus. There is quite a bit more strategy involved.

[27-May-19 01:40 PM] Alright#0419
we have a "set and forget" staker, but it's CLI based. @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ mentioned he could make a simple windows GUI for it possibly

[27-May-19 01:40 PM] Alright#0419
simple answer, not at the moment

[27-May-19 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
If someone is willing to maintain a windows release of the daemon, building a windows-only staking UI is simple
I don't currently, however, have a win dev box that I can compile the daemon with

[27-May-19 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
I have to believe that POS utxo management on Verus would help as well tbh, just don't understand it's quirks enough to know what optimal strategy would be

[27-May-19 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
we made an app that makes staking optimal, so now it seems it's required to compete üòÖ

[27-May-19 01:43 PM] Don King#8901
Ok, thanks, I am mining on NH, but would need to stake eventually I guess, to make it worthwhile.

[27-May-19 01:43 PM] Don King#8901
Love the project, maybe I am better off mining verus though myself

[27-May-19 01:44 PM] Alright#0419
If you give us a bit of time, we'll have windows support, but I can say it would probably pay to just rent a VPS and start staking

[27-May-19 01:45 PM] KMDLabs#3916
Hi,CrisF here.  Having trouble with discord.  My node-9 account was blocked too, @jorian.  This is my last account here, made when we decided the name for whoever to use.

[27-May-19 01:45 PM] Don King#8901
Is there a guide for vps setup with staking available?

[27-May-19 01:46 PM] KMDLabs#3916
Maybe you can confirm me by using the mail address in my proposal?

[27-May-19 01:47 PM] KMDLabs#3916
Still waiting for discord support to get back to me after their 1st message.

Pretty frustrating and really bad timing.
