make its multiple steps to remove it  and it 100% recoverable

[18-Feb-19 05:51 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`and it will litterally takwe 15mins to add it... why not addd it?`
because the last thing you said would take 15 minutes broke 9 chains and took 3 weeks :troll:

[18-Feb-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
miket said the code to do this was already there internally

[18-Feb-19 05:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Never said it would take only 15mins... I was surprised that the firs t chain was up in 24H üòÇ

[18-Feb-19 05:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
jl I already have code that does this, I just ned to change what it uses to skip removing tx's

[18-Feb-19 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it currently only skips on txid ...

[18-Feb-19 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very easy to change it

[18-Feb-19 06:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
watchonly wont be able to remove with wif tho...
`komodo-cli purgewatchonly <R-addr>`

[18-Feb-19 06:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... maybe this is harder than oit first looks lol ... has to be a reason its not there

[18-Feb-19 06:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  I think just do what I said... remove the walelt.dat and impor the notary key with no rescan. This isnt a 15minute job, all I was going to do would remove the tx related to that address, but not actaully remove it. Seems like its not worth the amount of tim it will take, when an existing solution exists.

[18-Feb-19 06:24 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, that's fine.  `zapwallets` just finished and the KMD balance has changed, so maybe that will be enough to get things moving.  Will try ‚òù .

[18-Feb-19 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that whould be all you need, but to remvoe the address, you wuld need to send balance to self. ie. preform traditionla lwallet reset

`make new wallet, import all other than the addresses you want removed` This seems like a vg idea  so many options left:)

[18-Feb-19 06:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you just run that script for KMD, all the entire balnce will just be in your ntoary address

[18-Feb-19 06:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
adn the wallet wuill contain just 1 utxo

[18-Feb-19 06:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Use that when thigns get out of hand, or you ahve had to rescan

[18-Feb-19 06:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then cleanwalelttransciions will work again to keep wallet size small.

There have been no bugs reported that I can see. I am going to sync some chains with notarypay_new branch and make sure its still compatible. I think also the speical miner will need to be skipped for non notarypay chains.  Then I will merge latest upstream from FSM down.

[18-Feb-19 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It looks like I can pretty easily define a new wallet just for staking, but it will definatly break the staking script lol... So I need to start a new branch to work out of for that. It seems much easier to just stake with a seperate wallet than try and use a sperate wallet for notary node address. 
Also we will finally be able to PoW daemon mine and stake at the same time. If I can get this working, I think it solves securing 0BR chains in a reliable way. As all notary nodes can mine and stake them without affecting notary node preformance. Makes little sense to need to run multiple copies of the entie blockchain if we don't have to.

[18-Feb-19 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Now this does mean that notaries will have to be trusted to mine the chains, as they will only get paid for notarizations and transaction fees. So they can simply not mine them. Hopefully this doesnt happen, and there is enough miners on each chain to keep them moving  along.

Just got the wallet sorted.  Thanks @blackjok3r , the steps involving the z_address did the trick.```"total_transactons": 36234,

Will try and collect some basic info on how notarization performance is effected.

[18-Feb-19 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Great now your node isnt borken, we will need a few days to see coin emission over all the nodes. Does anyone know how many nodes we actually have online?

[18-Feb-19 09:26 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, that would be useful info to have wouldn't it.

[18-Feb-19 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ther is an RPC in iguana for it

using stats.py

[18-Feb-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
great. Thats not too bad. Might need another day for CrisF to see how his node fares with a fixed wallet then increse min sigs a bit. a couple of things can happen, it will definatly make coin emission more fairly distributed to alll nodes, but also could make notarizations happen less often.  Which is not likely a great thing. Getting the number right could be a bit of trial and error, but its not a hardforking chang to blockchain code to increase the number over minimum so we can try a few thigns out.

[18-Feb-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
man the amount of chain params we have added that we are not suing any more üòÇ

[18-Feb-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
making ac_script work with notarypay is likely something I will need to look at sometime, as we cut off a lot of CC contracts that are possible by not being able to use it. But that can come later on.

[18-Feb-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont think it will be impossible.

ok was a problem with magic stuff, which is now fixed and its syncing dixmy's chains. Going to merge to master and also merge FSM to master. There will be an update soon. Hopefully there isnt a billion merge conflicts.

[18-Feb-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181

really shouldnt happen... on master branch at least....

Removed every branch except master branch. We are equal with FSM and everything but the streamer is included. Not required to update, but if you can please do. Need to make sure things still work as they should.

[18-Feb-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
All chains in assetchains.json sync from scratch and KMD was able to sync the last 2% to get to tip. So it seems everything is working.

[18-Feb-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Need to test migrates. I remeber one thing that changed that maybe broke them, will check it soon.

[18-Feb-19 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Once that is working will launch a second ntoary pay chain to test migrates on notary pay and without notarypay using DIMXY cluster.

[18-Feb-19 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@dimxy  I have merged FSM to master, it looks like there are a few RPC calls in that branch you might need.

pushed update to version 2 migrate script to stop it bailing out before the import was confirmed... 60 tries is for 60s, but it was reduced to 15s at some point by someone and it simply doesn't have time to finish.. Done a single migrate. Will start a massive loop before I go to sleep to make sure.

@Alright  @TonyL  
Is it normal for the slickRPC thing for python scripts to be spamming `ThreadRPCServer incorrect password attempt from 127.0.0.1:53892` 
On KMD? its like ti still works for assetchains, but every RPC call on AC is bing sent to KMD aswell?

If anyone does any migrates can they please let me know if they see this problem? 
`ThreadRPCServer incorrect password attempt from 127.0.0.1:53892 ` in KMD debug.log while using migrate script creating transactions. Maybe try before updating to newest master and then again after update. @LabsAssistant 
Update requires `build.sh` first time building as usual from upstream merge. All chains working for me, on latest master. Its a massive update so be on the lookout for weirdness.
