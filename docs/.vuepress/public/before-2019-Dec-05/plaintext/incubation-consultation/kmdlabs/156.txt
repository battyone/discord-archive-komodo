it's easy as hell to get PoS to 100% and harder to get PoW even down to 80 until it starts rolling at a good pace

[12-Dec-18 12:30 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
granted it's just CPU hash I'm looking at, but at 100% PoS, the PoW diff should be pretty much moot, no?

[12-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Alright#0419
would likely be 0f0f0f00000.... long before it got to 100%

[12-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Alright#0419
ie lowest possible pow target

[12-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Alright#0419
so even a single CPU wouldn't let it get there

[12-Dec-18 12:34 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`ie lowest possible pow target`
right, so at 100%, it should be a cakewalk for this beast to rock out a block and sometimes it takes up to 30 mins
meanwhile PoS can still rock 40 blocks in 4 minutes at that 100%

[12-Dec-18 12:35 AM] Alright#0419
yea the limiting factor of POS is POW

[12-Dec-18 12:35 AM] Alright#0419
not the other way around

[12-Dec-18 12:35 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I thought it was supposed to be mutually limiting

[12-Dec-18 12:36 AM] Alright#0419
think about how it works

[12-Dec-18 12:36 AM] Alright#0419
can work with only POS

[12-Dec-18 12:36 AM] Alright#0419
but cannot work with only POW

[12-Dec-18 12:36 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

游땥

[12-Dec-18 12:37 AM] Alright#0419
when there is only POW, diff will rise exponentially to compensate for lack of POS

[12-Dec-18 12:38 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
in theory, yes
but what I'm saying is that when it's only PoS, there's an odd disparity at 100% PoS that makes it more difficult for PoW to even get started than it seems it should be

[12-Dec-18 12:38 AM] Alright#0419
Could be a problem with built in miner

[12-Dec-18 12:39 AM] Alright#0419
would need to do some tests on that

[12-Dec-18 12:39 AM] Alright#0419
0f0f0f000... should hash basically instantly on any CPU

[12-Dec-18 12:39 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
especially this one 游땥

[12-Dec-18 12:39 AM] Alright#0419
you're saying it doesn't?

[12-Dec-18 12:40 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I'm saying that I've driven PoSperc to 100% and had trouble hitting a PoW block with 12 threads at that 100%

[12-Dec-18 12:40 AM] Alright#0419
if you can do that again, please take note of target value in stdout or getblocktemplate

[12-Dec-18 12:41 AM] Alright#0419
if it's 0f0f0f0.... or close to it, there's a problem with miner

[12-Dec-18 12:41 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
and I mean measurable trouble, not just me being a fanboy of this CPU

[12-Dec-18 12:41 AM] Alright#0419
otherwise, diff just hasn't lowered yet

[12-Dec-18 12:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the PoS target (via that script we made in postest) is like 0.00001 all the time

[12-Dec-18 12:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the PoW CPU miner never finds blocks

[12-Dec-18 12:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in the daemon at least

[12-Dec-18 12:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not that it makes any diffrence

[12-Dec-18 12:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the exact same function is used for CreateBlock

[12-Dec-18 12:42 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
at a literal 100% (ie the last 100 blocks were PoS)
`"target": "0011caa6d8493a2b1c0cfdeedfd0c1b2a39485766758493a2b1c0cfdeedaf9c0"`
I'm too lazy to do the math 游땥

[12-Dec-18 12:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to check the exact number but its very very low

you aren't mining?

[12-Dec-18 12:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had a shit load of trouble getting setgenerate to work reliably after hte verus merge... I think its right... but maybe its ot atually starting any mining threads.

[12-Dec-18 12:45 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
there seems to be no limiter on PoS, so blocks can come way too fast and drive the overall diff up (stifling PoW)

[12-Dec-18 12:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I have been saying this since postest

[12-Dec-18 12:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
PoS just shit blocks

[12-Dec-18 12:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until the chain stalls

James said it wasnt a bug

[12-Dec-18 12:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that script was written for the sole purpouse of proving the block times were crazy ... but the data was ingored.

[12-Dec-18 12:47 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
bug or not, 110k isn't in CPU range 游땥

[12-Dec-18 12:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think that hte PoW diff can be lowered

[12-Dec-18 12:47 AM] Alright#0419
that isn't a true representation of hashrate

[12-Dec-18 12:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That doesnt seem posible at all

[12-Dec-18 12:47 AM] Alright#0419
110k sol is not 0011....

[12-Dec-18 12:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can increase it, but not lower it

[12-Dec-18 12:47 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`that isn't a true representation of hashrate`
I'm saying the diff is 110k, not the hashrate

[12-Dec-18 12:48 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
124k now

[12-Dec-18 12:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And on CFEK... do a coinsupply RPC call

[12-Dec-18 12:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
see how much stakign weight that chain has

[12-Dec-18 12:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its imense

[12-Dec-18 12:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to say the least... not a normal situiation at all

[12-Dec-18 12:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going to be hard for a CPU or even a few thousand cpus to compete with that

`to say the least... not a normal situiation at all`
That's why I started with asking if the weight made a difference in what I'm seeing

[12-Dec-18 12:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have been reading thorugh the staking code heavilty trying to work out how it works, but its still a lit over my head

[12-Dec-18 12:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that having a crazy supply definatly means you need MORE PoW to maintain the % ratio

[12-Dec-18 12:51 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I had it all sorted out, then he rearranged it and changed 1/4 of it 游땥

[12-Dec-18 12:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
more like removed most of it 游땍

[12-Dec-18 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
I don't think overall supply has any effect

[12-Dec-18 12:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
are you sure ?

[12-Dec-18 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
nope

[12-Dec-18 12:52 AM] Alright#0419
that doesn't make sense if it does though

[12-Dec-18 12:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it calculates it chance of winning, by utxo value and age

[12-Dec-18 12:52 AM] Alright#0419
we can always use veruspos

[12-Dec-18 12:52 AM] Alright#0419
but I'd really rather use pos64

[12-Dec-18 12:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so the more massive utxos there are the higher chance it has to stake

[12-Dec-18 12:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
after the time we put into this I could as well

[12-Dec-18 12:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we can always hard fork and airdrop to verus PoS later if this really doest work out.

[12-Dec-18 12:53 AM] Alright#0419
would rather develop pos64 to it's fullest

[12-Dec-18 12:53 AM] Alright#0419
really think it's clever pos implementation

[12-Dec-18 12:53 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
```computergenie@debian:~/skomodo/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEK getbalance

[12-Dec-18 12:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
me too... hence why ive been reading its code in depth.

[12-Dec-18 12:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its main limitation I can see, is that a staking utxo isnt anything special .. like verus PoS mike added an actual extra flag(?) to the utxo object

[12-Dec-18 12:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with pos64

[12-Dec-18 12:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its just retroactivly calcualting shit

[12-Dec-18 12:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
over and over again,

[12-Dec-18 12:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to determine a PoS block and then sayign the last vin0 of that block is the staking utxo

[12-Dec-18 12:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and because of this, there are many issues

[12-Dec-18 12:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe we can use the stuff mike added to flag a winning utxo

[12-Dec-18 12:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
游뱡

[12-Dec-18 12:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but then your basically taking verusPoS and adding segids to it

[12-Dec-18 12:56 AM] Alright#0419
what's the problem with that?

[12-Dec-18 12:56 AM] Alright#0419
that's why I want pos64

[12-Dec-18 12:56 AM] Alright#0419
segids

[12-Dec-18 12:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not sure its algo that determines winners would work with segids though

[12-Dec-18 12:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and maybe aswell thats an issue here too... that algo has some flaw ...

[12-Dec-18 12:57 AM] Alright#0419
I really have very little understanding of either

[12-Dec-18 12:57 AM] Alright#0419
I still can't wrap my head around what jl did on postest64C

[12-Dec-18 12:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because too many utxo are elegible winners ... so blocks just shit way too fast

[12-Dec-18 12:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have very large amounts on my staker node atm...

[12-Dec-18 12:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and its not uncomon to see 1000-2000 utxo elegible winners at once

[12-Dec-18 12:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that seems a bit high... like each block should have a few winners.

[12-Dec-18 12:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not thousands

[12-Dec-18 12:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but maybe i dont understand it properly either

[12-Dec-18 12:59 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
"winners" just means eligible to stake in the next x seconds (I think x is 90, but I forget)
