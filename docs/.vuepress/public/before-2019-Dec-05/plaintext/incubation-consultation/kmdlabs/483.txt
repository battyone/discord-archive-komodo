lol I only deposit 740 labs today

[11-Oct-19 05:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is willing to sell LABS at 30k sats each..._

[11-Oct-19 05:06 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
Well I guess Im not really asking anyone to leave but why does labs reduce payment 30% when a large miner joins

{Reactions}
labs (2) smh (3) 

[11-Oct-19 05:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LABS doesn't "reduce payments" ever

[11-Oct-19 05:08 PM] CHMEX#0686
>>you're willing to sell 100k labs for 30 sats ea?
I would buy 100k for 475 KMD yes

[11-Oct-19 05:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
per person: 5760/6 people >  5760/10 people

[11-Oct-19 05:08 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
apologies I thought you were offering to sell

[11-Oct-19 05:09 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
Well please explain , if I average 1200 labs a day why suddenly today do I only have 740 ?

[11-Oct-19 05:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
stop blocking me and I'll explain whatever you like

[11-Oct-19 05:10 PM] CHMEX#0686
>>Well please explain , if I average 1200 labs a day why suddenly today do I only have 740 ?
Because network hashrate went up and /or your hashrate went down

[11-Oct-19 05:10 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
My hashrate is stable at 49KSOL average

[11-Oct-19 05:11 PM] CHMEX#0686
ok so networkhashrate went up

[11-Oct-19 05:12 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
So when does the network compensate every time a miner joins all payments are reduced drastically?

[11-Oct-19 05:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it doesn't

[11-Oct-19 05:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you have 10% of the hash you get 10% of the rewards
if you have 1% of the hash you get 1% of the rewards

[11-Oct-19 05:12 PM] CHMEX#0686
you get proportial amount of your hasrate compared to the network hashrate

[11-Oct-19 05:13 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes like CG says

[11-Oct-19 05:13 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
So you did this litterally out of spite?

[11-Oct-19 05:13 PM] CHMEX#0686
maybe somebody else

[11-Oct-19 05:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, math was invented 1000 years ago just to spite you now

[11-Oct-19 05:14 PM] CHMEX#0686
and everybody needs to pay bills so if he can make a profit by mining LABS and not XYZ thats his right no?

[11-Oct-19 05:15 PM] CHMEX#0686
in a week maybe he goes of mining something else and you get 2200 with your Z11

[11-Oct-19 05:15 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
I was super happy with 1200 labs a day but 740 not so lucrative.

[11-Oct-19 05:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
buy more hashrate

[11-Oct-19 05:16 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
That defeats the purpose

{Reactions}

[11-Oct-19 05:16 PM] CHMEX#0686
go mine something  which is more profitable and come back when it's profitable for you. there is someting called profitswitching

[11-Oct-19 05:16 PM] CHMEX#0686
so miners switch between coins whatever is most profitable

[11-Oct-19 05:16 PM] CHMEX#0686
some do that in a 5 mins interval

[11-Oct-19 05:17 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
Strangley I was mining Marks at mining dutch and they gave me nothing perhaps profitable for them ha ha

[11-Oct-19 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If your "purpose" is to mine the same amount of coins as someone that invested way more than you, then you'll be disappointed with ever coin you try to mine
Because, reality doesn't work that way

[11-Oct-19 05:18 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
hmmm ok its like your trying to use my own words against me dude I just want to make the .0044 bitcoin a day I dont care what I mine

[11-Oct-19 05:18 PM] CHMEX#0686
you could mine HUSH3 with a cpu at the begining but now anymore....is that fair? I think so yes because the network got stronger

[11-Oct-19 05:19 PM] CHMEX#0686
whattomine.com

[11-Oct-19 05:19 PM] CHMEX#0686
maybe that's a good website for you

[11-Oct-19 05:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$10 a day per mini? You're sadly confused about how this mining thing works

[11-Oct-19 05:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd be feken rich if that were a thing

[11-Oct-19 05:20 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
It would of been right 2 years ago its why I was willing to pay 1400 CND for a z9 mini 2 years ago and now I been picking them up under $200

[11-Oct-19 05:21 PM] CHMEX#0686

HUSH is most profitable for your Z11

[11-Oct-19 05:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`It would of been right 2 years ago`
'cept now ain't then

[11-Oct-19 05:22 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
A criminal stole my bitcoin at asian-miner.com about 1400 cnd

[11-Oct-19 05:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
comparative pricing way back, most of us paid like $20k+ for batch 1 S9s

[11-Oct-19 05:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`A criminal stole my bitcoin`
no, you gave it to a scammer; there's a difference

[11-Oct-19 05:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_isn't having this conversation again, though_

[11-Oct-19 05:26 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
Dude. its a felony not a " Scammer " sounds like your trying to say it wasn't a felony you could get over a year in prison for theft over 1000

[11-Oct-19 05:27 PM] gt#2812

This became collosolly dumb 500 Ksols?

[11-Oct-19 06:30 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
hang on? Is a bloke who is applying consistent sell pressure complaining because someone else started mining more and now he cant depress the price more? Then saying it's in everyone elses best interest to increase the BR so he can get more to sell? This is why I dont like miners who dont dev. All about fiat returns, no contribution to the tech.

yes 🤦🏽

[11-Oct-19 06:31 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
So he wants to make 50% less than pirate?

[11-Oct-19 06:31 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
LABS is fundamentally about tech innovation, not about fiat for lamebos

[11-Oct-19 06:31 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
labs never pays more than 4000 labs a day what would be the point of fighting over that

[11-Oct-19 06:32 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
Does he understand math?

[11-Oct-19 06:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
meanwhile the guy with "unethical vibes" hasn't mined or staked in **months** so that others could catch gains....

[11-Oct-19 06:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Does he understand math?`
I understand math enough to know that I can get more LABS per day than you can per week

[11-Oct-19 06:33 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
look mate, if you're not happy with the fiat you harvest competing with the network hash and dumping on graviex, there's about 5000 other alts you can contribute nothing to

[11-Oct-19 06:35 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
The network only pays 5000 labs a day  regardless of hash so why would you use 500 KSOL do you have brain damage?

[11-Oct-19 06:35 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
next HF, I propose we allocate some of the dev fund towards mining resources, then used the mining rewards to offer some community contribution bounties.

💯 

[11-Oct-19 06:35 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
even if you got all 5000 that wouldn't be worth it

[11-Oct-19 06:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`labs never pays more than 4000 labs a day`
~5644 per day to miners , but sure, lets round down

[11-Oct-19 06:36 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if its not worth it, move along.

[11-Oct-19 06:37 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
If you think coinsquare is going to steal that perhaps send your rep to my door and let me explain how retarded he is

[11-Oct-19 06:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so why would you use 500 KSOL do you have brain damage?`
because I can and it has the added bonus of making you complain more

if youd been an active participant in testing tech etc here, I might have time for your point of view, but since I've only even seen you compain about your passive gainz, I really dont.

[11-Oct-19 06:38 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
How is accumulating as much of the daily output a bad thing, the reason you cannot get your 1200 labs a day is because there are others out there with better hardware than you hitting the blocks you'd probably hit had they not turned their rigs on

[11-Oct-19 06:38 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I only stake, and im happy with my 500ish a day considering the amt I'm staking

[11-Oct-19 06:38 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
fuck off idiot your foolish

[11-Oct-19 06:39 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
go mine something else

@Community Moderator pls issue warning to @kevinkatovic  for abusive language

[11-Oct-19 06:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just think of it this way:
I'm mining in the pool and you still get a portion of those blocks
Keep complaining and I'll drop my hash into a solo stratum....

[11-Oct-19 06:39 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
your saying your going to be 5x the network on something that will not increase paying freq1uencey yuour very stupid

[11-Oct-19 06:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`How about not insulting the community mod`
Then what fun would I have all day? 😕

[11-Oct-19 06:40 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
unless you increase the value of labs but I know thats never the case
