I am not 100% sure of the relevent people are all in the staker role to do a ping... guess I just do it lol

[29-Nov-18 07:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[29-Nov-18 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no its just an update to min sigs

[29-Nov-18 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[29-Nov-18 07:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
oh so just iguana restart

[29-Nov-18 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
instead of 5... there is also an update to the mining code that fixes random freexes

[29-Nov-18 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
updating komodod and restarting should handle everything required

[29-Nov-18 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
minsigs is set in komodod for us

[29-Nov-18 07:37 AM] Deleted User#0000

for those using the standard control scripts just `./start.sh`

[29-Nov-18 07:39 AM] gcharang#6833
@blackjok3r have you seen my message in #dev-general , ./komodo-cli minerids 123456 gives wrong notary pubkeys because some of them are uninitialized for komodod through stakednotary. Don't know if it will cause problems elsewhere

[29-Nov-18 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS notaariesa dont mine ... I could disable that RPC call for staked chains ... but is that really required ?

[29-Nov-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems like a lot of extra code for no reason to me...

[29-Nov-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you wanted a list of notaries, just use `getiguanajson` RPC call.

[29-Nov-18 07:42 AM] gcharang#6833
I wasn't asking to disable it, I was thinking it might cause problems with other useful rpc calls we haven't used.

[29-Nov-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
appreciated testing these things though.

[29-Nov-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think so ..

[29-Nov-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it returns garbled output its because its looking for soething that does not exist

I just checked it ... dont think its anything to worry about. if you do it on komodo its correct and thats all that matters.

[29-Nov-18 07:46 AM] gcharang#6833
Great!

[29-Nov-18 08:28 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r  Just had a look and `getinfo` and `getbalance` are working fine on CFEKLAMEDUCKS now.

[29-Nov-18 08:29 AM] CrisF#3405
No hanging like yesterday.

[29-Nov-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I think I fixed that. Good we found it.

[29-Nov-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That fix needs to be pushed to KMD ... but I am not 100% sure what branch.

[29-Nov-18 08:37 AM] jorian#4555
it's so good to restart your node with just `./stop.sh` and `./start.sh` üòÑ

[29-Nov-18 08:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can just use ./start.sh

[29-Nov-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it will move the iguana output to the terminal you run it in. if there is an update to iguana.

[29-Nov-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in this case we have an update to iguana

[29-Nov-18 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
getinfo doesnt hang with latest FSM branch

[29-Nov-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I still cant bring that in ...

[29-Nov-18 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
i did fix some deadlock issues a few weeks back, so depending on when you last rebased to FSM, it could be something that was already fixed

[29-Nov-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was the commit before verus

[29-Nov-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant merge anythign after that, without a full rebase of our code

[29-Nov-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a few days work

[29-Nov-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There was another fix that fixed our deadlocks ...

[29-Nov-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a call to `IsInitalBlockDownlaod` in the mempool fix, that needs to be removed, and change to just `true`

[29-Nov-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and a `LOCK(cs.mempool)` needs to be added to the second part of the mempool fix.

[29-Nov-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Which branch is this meant to be PRd too, as the mempool fix was propagated to all of them no?

[29-Nov-18 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure about the mempool fix. verus code made some changes to it and it is running stable in our tests

[29-Nov-18 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok I will look at the code in FSM

[29-Nov-18 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe it was a totally diffrent issue that we have ... I dont know ... there is too many merge conflits for me to merge that in... I just cant do it.

[29-Nov-18 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its 1000x eaier to start at your branch and manually port LABS code into that

[29-Nov-18 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as everything is in 2 files with just calls to those.

[29-Nov-18 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  
https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/FSM/src/main.cpp#L4681
you have it still in FSM ... this should just be:
`tmpmempool.addUnchecked(hash,e,true);`

there is no reason at all, for it to call that and it only causes problems.

[29-Nov-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was a mistake on my part as I didnt know why it was even there.

[29-Nov-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or what it did

[29-Nov-18 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, yes no sense to have isinitialblockdownload there! i will remove it

https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/FSM/src/main.cpp#L4758
I am not 100% sure but there should be a `LOCK(cs.mempool)` at this line

That one I dont know for 100% sure, but I think it needs to be there.

[29-Nov-18 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it seems a good idea. added

[29-Nov-18 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
any other surgical fixes?

[29-Nov-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that was all that applies on your end ... my other fix was in the miner... we have an exeption that makes notarisations have the same priority as Z-TX so that under spam conditions notariations are confirmed first. That code was sloppy...

I improved it yesterday.

[29-Nov-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And it still needs further fixes to speed it up, even more.

[29-Nov-18 08:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once we have enough nodes updated to mine sigs 6 we need to test migrates heavily again... I have a problem, becasue my migrate testing VM is now being used to stake all t the CFEK chains.

[29-Nov-18 08:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So if anyone has a node they can test on, please test them and report any failed imports.

[29-Nov-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Heads up, both reported fails were on CFEKLF ... importing to this chain from CFEK.

[29-Nov-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although it should really make 0 diffrence as all chains are the same  branch.

[29-Nov-18 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And rember LAMEDUCKS cannot do migrates ... its a seperate cluster ID. üòÉ

[29-Nov-18 09:14 AM] CMaurice#1685

It has changes to make it much easier .. should be all in readme

[29-Nov-18 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ALthough you do need KMD synced for migrates.

[29-Nov-18 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can/have to use the master version of komodod to load KMD. Stating any chain ten manually starting `./komodod` is all you need.

[29-Nov-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have been thinkign about that, and we can definatly have a centralised service for the KMD signing part.

[29-Nov-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as the export tx is funded and signed early in the process... so after that it doenst matter if you make it avalible to some other person.

[29-Nov-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The coins can only be sent to the address you sent them too, during the export.

[29-Nov-18 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That seems like a great use for the AWS partnetrship ... Might speak to marketing about it. Ties in with the scaletest well.

[29-Nov-18 09:44 AM] CMaurice#1685
`./update_komodo.sh` isn't doing anything for me

[29-Nov-18 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry

[29-Nov-18 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[29-Nov-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CMaurice  I need more context ?

[29-Nov-18 09:52 AM] CMaurice#1685
yeah, must be an issue with me, it literally seems to exit straight to cmd line without any output, quite tsrange

[29-Nov-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What did you do ? You need to run `buildkomodo.sh` first

[29-Nov-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise it doesnt have the git repo to build out of

[29-Nov-18 09:53 AM] CMaurice#1685
oh yeah, just downgraded this old laptop to Stretch, does seem to build fine now

[29-Nov-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have used another komodo directory say `~/komodo` and symlinked it like so
`ln -s /home/<user>/komodo /home/<user>/staked/StakedModo`

[29-Nov-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I dont quite reccomend doing such thigns unless you kow what your doing.

[29-Nov-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also that repo, if someone can make it so that it doesnt require any hard coded paths at all .... I woukd be very happy about it.

[29-Nov-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
currently it seperates everything, so that you can have normal komodo on the same system... but its till hard codes to `~/staked`

[29-Nov-18 10:47 AM] CMaurice#1685
hrm won't build for me gcc 5 & 6, did build jl777 FSM gcc5

How to know Nodes are  updated ? seems `stop` and `start` script pulls nothing annd says it is on latest build already @blackjok3r

[29-Nov-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when you run start you can also run htop in another terminal and see if it builds... generally it will say `updated to latest` if it built

[29-Nov-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then start

[29-Nov-18 11:24 AM] Nabob#5004

Does anyone want to test the streamer in a new build? I am making a PR for FSM. If anyone wants to give it a go, this is a good oppertunity to try it out doing something helpful.

[29-Nov-18 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You would need to use a clean VPS most likely. I use 2 VMs on my PC to test it early on, each with 8GB of ram, but you could use far less.

[29-Nov-18 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Should be as simple as following the instructionsm to stream and then extract a file once it has sent.
