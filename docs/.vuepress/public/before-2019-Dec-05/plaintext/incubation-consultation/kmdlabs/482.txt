Ok thanks @mrlynch  - don’t know if you are existing or running for next election notary.

[07-Oct-19 06:24 AM] Alright#0419
back at it guys, let me know if anything needs doing

[07-Oct-19 07:10 AM] CHMEX#0686

[07-Oct-19 07:10 AM] CHMEX#0686
And1_89 wants new ( his own keys)

[07-Oct-19 07:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes there are also a few ppl that want to join, there is a hard fork upcoming when we can do that, didn't tie in with the 2 month rotation but it's just worked out that way.

[07-Oct-19 08:23 AM] jorian#4555
nice to see you back! made any nice LABS plans you'd like to share while you were travelling? 😄

[07-Oct-19 08:57 AM] phm87#7395
It is good to see both of you came back. I hope you had pleasant holidays

[07-Oct-19 06:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Mylo i'm planning on running next election, but i think it would be best to partner up with someone.. trying to do too many things at once rarely goes well

Hi, I was looking into the private mining, to prevent the possibility of no-fee transactions.  Am I correct in thinking that since a `Zero-Knowledge Vote` would require voters to run in native I wouldn't be able to keep the chain params secret?

[10-Oct-19 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can make it so that only 1 or a few pubkeys can mine, the code already exists for this in the streamer.

[10-Oct-19 08:42 PM] CrisF#3405
That's great!
With that it should be enough to do a Zero-Knowledge Vote.

I've added a table to track LABS global SegID staking at https://oracle.earth/labs_segid/ to help stakers with choosing a spread for staking LABS

nice job @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator would it be informative to add getlastsegidstakes 1440 to see how each performed on avg?

Can you guys remove the big machine http://mininglabs.rocks/workers/RQttoKcBABNuYPjNNT56xmLjkRMGLQVxuF its reduced all our payouts by about 30% because kmdlabs isn't balanced correctly.  And if I mine as well with a Z11 there will be no benifit to anyone.  All of us have about 50K and that worked out nicely but 130-180 miner is only benefiting him/her now.  Now we might as well mine hush or pirate because of that.  I don't think thats fair can you increase the block reward 30% as much to make up for the difference?  Its easy math for me the hashrate is increasing but you dont reward and more blocks with kmd labs to comepensate and I doubt bitcoin works the same way.

[11-Oct-19 04:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

_adds 200k just to piss off @kevinkatovic_

[11-Oct-19 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@kevinkatovic I'll literally die before I boot a miner out of the pool for no other reason than you don't like the amount of hashrate they paid to own

To make it unprofitable

[11-Oct-19 04:41 PM] kevinkatovic#1278

[11-Oct-19 04:45 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
but im selling not buying

[11-Oct-19 04:47 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
Can't we either pump the price up 30% or increase the block reward 30% more often?

[11-Oct-19 04:47 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
I want the old deal back...

[11-Oct-19 04:47 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
Now its 30% less

[11-Oct-19 04:53 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
Notorys?  Maybe they have a better deal?

[11-Oct-19 04:54 PM] PHBA2061#2530
what deal ? the more miners the better for the network isn't it ?

[11-Oct-19 04:55 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
not in this case apparently the market is fickel its a great deal for the Z11 but not the rest of us sadly now I went from making 1200 labs a day to about 700 or so and we are all pretty much the same I thought

[11-Oct-19 04:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Stop joking around`
That's not a joke and the only thing stopping me from doubling the pool's hashrate just out of spite is that I don't feel like getting dressed and turning my miners on

[11-Oct-19 04:56 PM] CHMEX#0686
How many are you selling Kevin?

[11-Oct-19 04:57 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
Im selling 3 z9 minis

[11-Oct-19 04:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You don't get the network hashrate you want just because you want it, otherwise I'd make 800 BTC per day with 1 S9

you can't just ask other miners to leave because you earn less ...
