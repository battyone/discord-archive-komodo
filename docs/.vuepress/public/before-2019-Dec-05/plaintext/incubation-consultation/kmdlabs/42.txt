yes c++ seems a lot harder to me aswell.

altough as with anyhting its all practice

any one up on blockchain chat  ?

The video stream authenticity validation is critical to balance against the rise of deepfake tech. Used to be you could never trust what a politician was saying. Nowadays you cant even trust that it's the politician saying it.
Do notarys back up the stream for tampering analysis later?

I am not sure its feasable to have notaries keep it

[16-Oct-18 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But once the raw data is notarised any copy can be verified

[16-Oct-18 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It doesnt make sense to have all notaries keepng a copy of everything ...

[16-Oct-18 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You never know what the data might be... dont want the service to be dissapeared because someone used it for somehting bad.

[16-Oct-18 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just notarise the data against KMD for a fee then remove it

[16-Oct-18 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
why keep the raw data?

[16-Oct-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
anybody with the rawdata can verify the hashes

[16-Oct-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
all the authentication is built in

[16-Oct-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
but a single miner chain should also prevent anybody other than notaries from doing tx to keep it pure

[16-Oct-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
this is really an edge case as usually blockchains have multiple writers, but it does solve a usecase on the broadcast receivers side

[16-Oct-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
very cool

[16-Oct-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
and it is often that some unusual things are found at the edges

[16-Oct-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
like PIRATE without taddr, this one with a single miner/tx creator

[16-Oct-18 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I have a few issues at the moment ... Trying to figure out the notary node miner, that needs to spend 0.0001 utxo to create the TX  atm.  
Might take another day yet. However I am taking it slow and thinking it through trying to make the least amount of changes as I can. Right now I have it so that the coinbase TX can only be mined by the ac_pubkey as a conesnsus rule, but anyone who mines also mines to that pubkey. So I need to add the notary miner to that, so they also need the private key. 
what I have so far is:
1. every block generated under 128 makes 2 p2pk utxo's and every block over  128 makes 1.
2. both these p2pk are to ac_pubkey as a consesnus rule, unless the ac_pubkey owner gives anyone coins, no body else can make transactions. 

This I assume will be launched similar to how Alright designed the oracles and assetchains.json. The dAPP user pays the notaries and funds them, and there is some kind of setting for when the chain is to be stopped being notarised, and then it can be removed from al notaries.

[16-Oct-18 10:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
good point re: the liability of storing unknown censorship resistant data

[16-Oct-18 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... the chain is owned by the chain creator, notaries just provide a service to make it immutable.

[16-Oct-18 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Really any data at all can be used here... not just video.

[16-Oct-18 10:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the use cases will be unknown until people can use it.

[16-Oct-18 10:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just wondering how to counter potential tampering pre/on stream. as long as a copy exists, it can be analysed. Tampering after stream is exposed well by notary hash. Catching tampering ealier is probably beyond scope though.

[16-Oct-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
welll the chain creator is sending into the mempool and minging the chain, all they need to do is put enough hash at it so mine the blocks as fast as the data is being generated.

[16-Oct-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess I have enough f it done to see what that limit is before it breaks ü§î

[16-Oct-18 10:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
any data... like a GPS sensor stream...? This would expand well into scientific survey data. Plenty of sensors out there collecting

[16-Oct-18 10:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if you have chain of custody validated from source, no-one can fudge the numbers without spoofing them to begin with

[16-Oct-18 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well yes ... I guess so... as the chain iteself is trusted, but once the blockchain is notarised and more people have a copy, then its locked in. Unless KMD and BTC dissapear.

[16-Oct-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for things like sensors and stuff... depends how much data, likely if its not huge bandwidth required a normal chain can be used.

[16-Oct-18 10:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Sensor data without imagery band components are pretty low kb, even if collecting in realtime. Most sensors only poll periodically to conserve power  or because rate of change isn't rapid enough to warrant continuous capture.

[16-Oct-18 10:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
lightweight json strings for temperature, windspeed, acidity etc etc

[16-Oct-18 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Likely those kind of things would just use a notarised chain with oracles I guess... This kind of chain, is for big data...

[16-Oct-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and on off usecases .. say a video interview of a wistleblower... or whatever anyone can think of.

[16-Oct-18 10:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
alongside txscl, you could have an army of sensors so cover large tracts in parallel

[16-Oct-18 10:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is a lot of work, before the code reaches a point where large scale notarisations can be done easily though üò¶ I have an idea on how to "fix" the pubkey problem as per advice form james a while ago, but my skills are too low to try it yet, not an issue for at least another year I think though so plenty of time.

[16-Oct-18 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ideally storing the array of pubkeys onchain somwhere would be the go.

[16-Oct-18 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Rather than hardcoded into the deamon, this stops endless hardforks ...

[16-Oct-18 11:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
The asset tracker kit I"m using for GPS has a bunch of cpp libs I might stare at for a while and then poke with a blunt stick

[16-Oct-18 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cpp is probably no so bad if starting from scratch code ... but trying to follow it in komodod is difficult.

[16-Oct-18 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it makes no logical sense how it actaully gets any information. things like a variable.somehting.getstring and things like that ... and how to get those things and where they are avalible. ... at least with C if there is a pointer, you know that data is avalible in that funcitona nd you can use it.

[16-Oct-18 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I found a good trick, if you dont know what type some data is, is to just printf a string, then compile and the compiler will tell you what type it actually is. üòÇ  
its slow going, but it works

yep. even in nodejs, `console.log` and `typeof` are handy tools

[16-Oct-18 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
learning how to hack C with iguana was good, becaues james already had debug printf's everywhere ... and it was juts a matter of finding a printf with the data you wanted to check and copy pasting it somwhere else. seem to be getting past that now though as I have more experiance.

[16-Oct-18 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and atom text editor helps with syntax a fair bit too.

I used notepadd++ for years, switched to sublime last year and it's heaps better on the eyes

[16-Oct-18 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Until I got this P50 a lot of the software I use was unuseable on windows and even my old laptop with linux ... this wasnt easy to get used to one bit, but i3 the way have it setup is so freeking productive.

[16-Oct-18 11:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
how setup?

Started with that ... but as I have a P50 thinkpad with 16GB of ram and not an old core2 thinkpad like him, I was able to use some newere/more bloated software. 
Learning basic vim has been helpful, as I use servers/vps/VM to do all compiling etc, because internet here is shite (even with nbn 50mbit building KMD from scratch takes forever)

but kept most of his key shortcuts and stuff... I still dont find myself always using hte key shortcuts unless in a real rush... mostly use the track pad still.

didnt think a singel screnn latop could be this much better than a multi screen setup... although with this multi screen it would likely be even better, just havent been bothered to amke it work.

`Capslock is a useless key in high quality space.`
This guy knows what he's on about!

[16-Oct-18 11:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
all caps lock ever does is ruin things when you over reach IMING FOR `A`

[16-Oct-18 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant use a computer without capslock as esc now

[16-Oct-18 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hes a very smart guy, has some really noce podcasts on youtube now aswell.

somethings are worth unlearning. I dont think I'll miss capslock. shift does the trick anyway

[16-Oct-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just kept reading `cfi` whenever I had nothing else to do and then playing with shortcuts ... as with any custom OS, you need to change it a lot before it does exaly what you want to.

and super +A has a R calculator, still am yet to master perfectly but its way better than anything else ive used.

nothig beats i3 for using heaps of terminals, that first scale test would heva been impossible without it.

[16-Oct-18 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But its only a code thing ... someone can modify the daeomon code and remove the need for a payment then mine. Still thinking but getting closer here.

[16-Oct-18 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So far everything is just a -ac_stream=1 command line arg, need to load another chain to double check though.

[16-Oct-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  what is the KMD burn pubkey ?

[16-Oct-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Or should i just flood CRYTPO777 address with unspents of value = 0 ?

[16-Oct-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sending them back to the chain creator is going to break the wallet long term under load.

[16-Oct-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe dont need any vout at all

[16-Oct-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
just have opreturn

[16-Oct-18 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe change is assumed though...

[16-Oct-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to have notary tx still able to happen, and with staked, I canot referance the hardcoded array, so I need to do it another way ...

[16-Oct-18 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to check, but maybe you know,
the notary spend TX is always last in a block, even if the block is full this TX will always be there ?

[16-Oct-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the notarization tx is just a normal tx

[16-Oct-18 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If so, I can just burn the streamer spend TX and check it was sent by the override pubkey

[16-Oct-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
can be anywhre in the block other than coinbase

[16-Oct-18 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[16-Oct-18 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[16-Oct-18 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[16-Oct-18 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181

the proof of notary utxo

[16-Oct-18 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have the assetchains_override pubkey using that

[16-Oct-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
yes that is the last

[16-Oct-18 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
even if the block is full

[16-Oct-18 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so I can just check that the last TX came from assetchains_override_pubkey

[16-Oct-18 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and reject any blocks without that ?

[16-Oct-18 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this stops anyone else mining no matter what they try.

[16-Oct-18 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise someone determined cna change the code, and mine blocks without proving they have a utxo from assetchains_override_pubkey (chain creator)

[16-Oct-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
yes seems would work

[16-Oct-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will try it. thanks
