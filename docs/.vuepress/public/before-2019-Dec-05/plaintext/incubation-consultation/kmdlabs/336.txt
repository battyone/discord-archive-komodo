if we can't find an absolute method for calculating this, we could set an arbitrary limit to hex data for non-fungible tokens

[19-Mar-19 02:43 AM] Alright#0419
yes my point is that if you use 10kb of hex in the tokencreate command, OP_RETURN will be >10001

[19-Mar-19 02:43 AM] Alright#0419
it will try to make it >10001 and fail that is

[19-Mar-19 02:43 AM] dimxy#2587
and you just would receive an error when the tx is validated

[19-Mar-19 02:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when testing import migrateions. I had very strang errors occur when there were around 50+ vins

[19-Mar-19 02:44 AM] Alright#0419
the migrate adds extra data as well

[19-Mar-19 02:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I assumed it was because of size... buut it could be another issue

[19-Mar-19 02:44 AM] Alright#0419
so you may be able to create an 9kb non-fungible token, but unable to migrate it

[19-Mar-19 02:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Migrate adds data AFTER the burn has been sent... this is the problem

[19-Mar-19 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we need to work out what this is

[19-Mar-19 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to limit the burn tx size to account for this

[19-Mar-19 02:46 AM] Alright#0419
yea that seems a good solution if you think that will work

[19-Mar-19 02:47 AM] Alright#0419
just check burn tx prior to burning

[19-Mar-19 02:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well as long as that is what caused the error on import that is

[19-Mar-19 02:47 AM] Alright#0419
see if the import would be >10001

[19-Mar-19 02:47 AM] Alright#0419
and fail it

[19-Mar-19 02:47 AM] Alright#0419
don't burn them

[19-Mar-19 02:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was weird, as I would expect it to say "tx too alrge" but instead it said "vins -ve"

[19-Mar-19 02:47 AM] Alright#0419
the hell is "vins -ve"

[19-Mar-19 02:47 AM] Alright#0419
that's not a typo?

[19-Mar-19 02:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
vins are negative

[19-Mar-19 02:48 AM] dimxy#2587
I think we may issue a recomendation to limit non-fungible data if you want to migrate your tokens

[19-Mar-19 02:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the MoM hash and MoMoM hash are an exact defined size so we can calculate what data is added after the burn. Im just not exactly sure how to do that

[19-Mar-19 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sorry the exact error the large txn gave was this: `if (txout.nValue < 0)
            return state.DoS(100, error("CheckTransaction(): txout.nValue negative"),
                             REJECT_INVALID, "bad-txns-vout-negative");`

[19-Mar-19 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
decoderawtransaction though showed that it was indeed positive

[19-Mar-19 02:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
could have also been this:
```if ( txout.scriptPubKey.size() > IGUANA_MAXSCRIPTSIZE )
            return state.DoS(100, error("CheckTransaction(): txout.scriptPubKey.size() too big"),REJECT_INVALID, "bad-txns-vout-negative");```

[19-Mar-19 02:58 AM] Alright#0419
seems an overflow

[19-Mar-19 02:58 AM] Alright#0419
if changing non-fungible data is affecting the amounts in a vout, something is wrong

[19-Mar-19 02:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no, this was in particilar, adding too many vins to a burn tx making ius very large... I assumed it was the tx size that caused it

[19-Mar-19 02:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but maybe its not? 
what is: `IGUANA_MAXSCRIPTSIZE`

[19-Mar-19 02:59 AM] Alright#0419
op_return size limit

[19-Mar-19 02:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and how does a script pubkey end up too big?

[19-Mar-19 02:59 AM] Alright#0419
with a funny name

[19-Mar-19 03:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ah ha.... so OP_RETURN limit has beeen breached, but the error doesnt say that

[19-Mar-19 03:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
😃

[19-Mar-19 03:00 AM] Alright#0419
it's the script size limit to be specific

[19-Mar-19 03:00 AM] Alright#0419
any script, not just OP_RETURNs

[19-Mar-19 03:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so my theory is correct. Yes I get that, btu I doubt any other script would breach that limit apart from OP_RETURN...

[19-Mar-19 03:01 AM] Alright#0419
it seems to me that an oversized OP_RETURN is overflowing into changing the vout values

[19-Mar-19 03:01 AM] dimxy#2587
we may limit vins number for burn tx's

[19-Mar-19 03:01 AM] Alright#0419
and this is checked first

[19-Mar-19 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so a burn tx needs to be limited in total size, iun such a way that:
`burntx + nonfungibledata < IGUANA_MAXSCRIPTSIZE-MoMoM-MoM signing`

[19-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
yep

[19-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
script < IGUANA_MAXSCRIPTSIZE to simplify it :troll:

[19-Mar-19 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[19-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
OH

[19-Mar-19 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because MoM and MoMoM are added

[19-Mar-19 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
later on

[19-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
yes I understand

[19-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
on source chain, it needs to be smaller

[19-Mar-19 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[19-Mar-19 03:03 AM] Alright#0419
so it can be <10000 on target

[19-Mar-19 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Would that be something you can do? you  need to work out a constant sizew that is iadded to every import

[19-Mar-19 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would assume tis the exact same size for every one

[19-Mar-19 03:03 AM] Alright#0419
sure

[19-Mar-19 03:03 AM] Alright#0419
should be pretty easy

[19-Mar-19 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
coins or token should make 0 diffrence

[19-Mar-19 03:03 AM] Alright#0419
look for  E_MARSHALL

[19-Mar-19 03:03 AM] Alright#0419
and see what it's putting in there

[19-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Alright#0419
see max size for each

[19-Mar-19 03:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as its only createimport on source chain, and complete import on KMD that adds any data...

[19-Mar-19 03:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once we know how much maximum data those steps can add, the limit is easily defined

[19-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Alright#0419
ok, I'll check it out

[19-Mar-19 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cheers thanks. btw I think we can do these chains. Maybe we can keep the 3/4 for now

[19-Mar-19 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just dont do any migrates ont ehm until everyon is updated

[19-Mar-19 03:05 AM] dimxy#2587
👌

[19-Mar-19 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that at least allows testing of the backwards compatability

[19-Mar-19 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
add 2 more chains that we can test on, once notarizations start

[19-Mar-19 03:07 AM] CrisF#3405
Any (approx) idea when new chains?  On battery for a while.  Will check in around expected time, if any.

[19-Mar-19 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just testing the build of master right now. seems fine. Going to merge FSM down though aswell along with new equihash params, maybe a few hours?

[19-Mar-19 03:09 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, will check back in a few.  Maybe have an adapter by then.

@blackjok3r where am I looking for where it builds burn txs

[19-Mar-19 03:13 AM] Alright#0419
what is the rpc command for a burn tx?

[19-Mar-19 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
migrate_createburntransaction

[19-Mar-19 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is the new RPC

[19-Mar-19 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to create a brun

[19-Mar-19 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
guess that gives you the size of the burn, and you can just compare it to the size of a compelte import tx... do that a few times and see if its always the same

[19-Mar-19 03:15 AM] Alright#0419
can I do burns on CFEKDIMXY right now with latest without forking them?

[19-Mar-19 03:15 AM] Alright#0419
don't actually need to do the imports, just the burns

[19-Mar-19 03:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just use an old burn

[19-Mar-19 03:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[19-Mar-19 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats a burn tx

[19-Mar-19 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can then do createimport, on the source

[19-Mar-19 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then complete import on KMD

[19-Mar-19 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and compare the sizes

[19-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Alright#0419
this is the script exactly? `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`

[19-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Alright#0419
this is shown as `"hex"` field if you do getrawtx?

[19-Mar-19 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes thats the send burn hex

[19-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Alright#0419
oh this is the full tx hex?

that will give you the exact hex I just posted, its the 2 steps after that we need to know

[19-Mar-19 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but maybe it changed  now

[19-Mar-19 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with the new burn format?
