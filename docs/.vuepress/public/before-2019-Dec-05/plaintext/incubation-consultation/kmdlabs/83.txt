I don't think air drop suits STAKED. For dice it is perfect.  If people rcv even a SML amnt they can play/use it.  Not so with STAKED. There are better ways to get the name out for STAKED.

[11-Nov-18 08:51 PM] CrisF#3405
I don't think there'll be much trouble getting people involved with STAKED when it's all set up.

[11-Nov-18 08:51 PM] Alright#0419
Should be able to start new chains with relatively low amount of coins

[11-Nov-18 08:51 PM] Alright#0419
unless notaries collectively decide to be greedy and up the minimum amount of STAKED they'll accept for notarizing a chain

[11-Nov-18 08:52 PM] Alright#0419
which isn't a bad thing as it will increase demand

[11-Nov-18 08:52 PM] Alright#0419
notaries just need to find a balance

[11-Nov-18 08:52 PM] jorian#4555
free market. but if you dont notarize too often, do you get punished?

[11-Nov-18 08:52 PM] Alright#0419
you just punish yourself

[11-Nov-18 08:52 PM] CrisF#3405
That will be a big part of STAKED's value @jorian . Along with the service and easy of use STAKED provides.

[11-Nov-18 08:53 PM] Alright#0419
you need to lock coins after the first two months

[11-Nov-18 08:53 PM] Alright#0419
and you get paid per notarization made

[11-Nov-18 08:53 PM] Alright#0419
so feel free to lock coins and do no notarizations ü§∑

[11-Nov-18 08:54 PM] CrisF#3405
To steal from jl777's idea, ```Lizard Works```

[11-Nov-18 08:55 PM] Alright#0419
the amount needed of locked coins could be a fair bit of STAKED

[11-Nov-18 08:55 PM] Alright#0419
as we need to limit the amount of notaries

[11-Nov-18 08:55 PM] Alright#0419
idea is to limit the amount based on % of supply

[11-Nov-18 08:56 PM] Alright#0419
so new notary would need to lock % of supply for 2 months to be a notary for 2 months

[11-Nov-18 08:57 PM] Alright#0419
there's a problem there as well we still need to figure out

[11-Nov-18 08:58 PM] Alright#0419
if we say you need to lock x% for this period

[11-Nov-18 08:58 PM] Alright#0419
but then we have many more people willing to lock that % in the next period, we'd need to up the %

[11-Nov-18 08:58 PM] Alright#0419
or determine who can stay and who has to get the boot

[11-Nov-18 09:00 PM] jorian#4555
if you need a test notary, i'd be happy to be one

[11-Nov-18 09:01 PM] Alright#0419
maybe top notaries can ensure their position by locking coins previous to public locking which would just be a free for all of who can lock them first

[11-Nov-18 09:01 PM] Alright#0419
so like top 75% can always remain if they choose

[11-Nov-18 09:01 PM] Alright#0419
bottom 25% would have to race newcomers to lock coins if they wish to remain

[11-Nov-18 09:05 PM] Alright#0419
@jorian make a PR to add your pubkey

[11-Nov-18 09:06 PM] Alright#0419
if you notarize in testnet cluster before launch, you get a spot for the first 2 months with no requirement of locking coins

[11-Nov-18 09:06 PM] CrisF#3405
```Dragon Works```

[11-Nov-18 09:07 PM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant that reminds me, if you currently have a pubkey in the code and you don't notarize CFEK chains at least once before launch, we will remove your pubkey and you will no longer be a notary

[11-Nov-18 09:07 PM] Alright#0419
no exceptions

ah great, the address is there

[11-Nov-18 09:15 PM] jorian#4555
gonna check if i still have keys to that

[11-Nov-18 09:16 PM] Alright#0419
can change it if you need to, just have to wait until we test changing them next

[11-Nov-18 09:16 PM] Alright#0419
Likely going to require new address from all notaries for mainnet anyway

[11-Nov-18 09:17 PM] jorian#4555
ok

[11-Nov-18 09:21 PM] Alright#0419 (pinned)
Anyone that needs a pubkey added, send address and pubkey to stakedchain@protonmail.com

[11-Nov-18 09:21 PM] Alright#0419
going to use that as the definitive way to gather new notaries

Pinned a message.

[12-Nov-18 12:27 AM] Mylo#8306
time to read those pins and get CFEK going then!!!! üòÑ

[12-Nov-18 12:45 AM] Mylo#8306
`[KMD] : Checking your address and importing it if required.` hope i'm not being too impatient in saying that it seems to have stopped there and there is no `~/.komodo/debug.log` to check after `[KMD] : Starting KMD`

[12-Nov-18 12:50 AM] Mylo#8306
dw, re-installing.

[12-Nov-18 01:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah that steps message is pretty ambiguous and non decriptive ... what its actually doing it waiting for KMD to start, and if it doesnt start it will wait for it litterally forever... it really the only "bug" left with the start and build script I know of... but it seems at least one thing to make sure a notary op can do at least theminimum required to run a notary. When things go wrong with this system, they are not easy to fix, as you have no info or prints anywhere lol.

[12-Nov-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also the best thing to do always is get a clean VPS and run buidkomodo.sh

[12-Nov-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will work 100% of the time in that case.

[12-Nov-18 01:19 AM] Mylo#8306
i got rid of old installs....SuperNET komodo.  just synced stakednotary and install/build scripts went ok.

[12-Nov-18 01:21 AM] Mylo#8306
syncing kmd from scratch.  then i'll run start.sh script again.  CF* chains are synced

[12-Nov-18 01:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEK* chains were not notarising yesterday for wuite some time... CFEK was ok.. I have a feeling its got something to do with my atest merges... There is a lot of stuff needed to be tested ...

[12-Nov-18 01:24 AM] Mylo#8306
well tomorrow morning i should have an Rkmdlabs address üòõ

[12-Nov-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nice üòÉ

[12-Nov-18 01:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going to spend today fiishing my pool... Your good at java script? I got stuck on somehting maybe you can help me with? üôè

[12-Nov-18 01:32 AM] Mylo#8306
my weakest lang, maybe i can.

[12-Nov-18 01:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems trivial, but really threw me off.

[12-Nov-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I post a command to the daemon

[12-Nov-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it returns a json

[12-Nov-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which I can do `console.log(resultjson)`

[12-Nov-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it prints the thing to console

[12-Nov-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but doing `result.json.response`

[12-Nov-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it says its undefined ü§∑

[12-Nov-18 01:33 AM] Mylo#8306
resultjson.response?

[12-Nov-18 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes sorry

[12-Nov-18 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on sec will get actual code

[12-Nov-18 01:34 AM] Mylo#8306
c+p `resultjson`  response is probably not an attribute of the object.

[12-Nov-18 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```                  _this.daemon.cmd('setpubkey', [pubkey], function (results) {
                      console.log(results);
                  }```

[12-Nov-18 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this works perfectly

[12-Nov-18 01:36 AM] Mylo#8306
what is `results`?

[12-Nov-18 01:36 AM] Mylo#8306
c+p that console output line

[12-Nov-18 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and prints this out:
```[ { error: null,
    response:
     { error:
        'Can only set pubkey once, to change it you need to restart your daemon.' },
    instance:

       index: 0 } } ]
```

[12-Nov-18 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wait thats not it

[12-Nov-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[12-Nov-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to get the address part there

[12-Nov-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
basically, I want to check the pooladdress == -pubkeys address ... as the pool can no longer define where its block rewards are paid

[12-Nov-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its controlled by the -pubkey in the daemon.

[12-Nov-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it someone setsthe 2 as diffrent things, the pool is going to get angry, as it wot be able to see its payments

[12-Nov-18 01:39 AM] Mylo#8306
response[0].response it's an array

[12-Nov-18 01:39 AM] Mylo#8306
?

[12-Nov-18 01:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok I tried something like that and it stopped crashing.

[12-Nov-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but still didnt return what I was looking for... guess I need to keep trial and erroring it... might be eaier now I slept.

[12-Nov-18 01:40 AM] Mylo#8306
result[0].response.pubkey should return '02191494........106e'

[12-Nov-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried a for loop, to loop over the array but it refused to start fucked around for 3h with it complaiing about a )

[12-Nov-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks.. I had a feeling it was somehting like that.... hopefully it works

[12-Nov-18 01:41 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah that's javascript for ya

[12-Nov-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
PITA

[12-Nov-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
C++ is easier

[12-Nov-18 01:44 AM] Mylo#8306
yep. lmk how you go.
if that doesn't return pubkey, try result[0] to get rid of the bracket at least, then try target either response or instance next.  but should be ok

[12-Nov-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks man

[12-Nov-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Id like to get this change to the pool pished up to webs repo asap... as it doesnt actuivate at all unless you add "disablecb" to the coin.json I think going forward if someone else cna work out the payment processor to use this method instead, most KMD AC will and up using this method...

[12-Nov-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There seems no rason to have the pool screw around making transactions... the daemon makes a block template the pool should just freekig use it ü§∑

[12-Nov-18 01:58 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah not sure i follow, but dw it's 2am here üòÉ

[12-Nov-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hah i know the feeling lol

[12-Nov-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think anyone is understanding what im trying to do here tbh

[12-Nov-18 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
