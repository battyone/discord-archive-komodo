I remember when orphans were a rare thing and 3 orphans out of 8 blocks wasn't something to be excited about ☹

hm, no, that was  libsodium-1.0.15.tar.gz in Jan

[25-Nov-19 05:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
likely they kept the file info to keep the sigs matching

If anyone wants to try this out, plese do. I havent had time to fully test it, utxosplitter and stats script now count utxos exactly the same way. 
Also stats.py in py_scripts folder will extract notarization counts from any chain. Thanks to @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  and @Alright  for example scrpts to work from. 
Anything else you may like fixed pls DM to me, and I will get to it.

[26-Nov-19 03:44 AM] daemonfox#6136
Prob regret this but... pulling now...

[26-Nov-19 03:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.

havent had to do that before when swapping to your branch...

I think many_iguana branch was removed. Checkout master probably.

I have tried to simplify things a bit and keep all scripts the same, a PR from anyone to fix anything would be nice 😅

Someone mind helping out a knob? For staking LABS should I be using the KMD Ocean Qt wallet, or is that part of the purpose of the StakedNotary I see on Github?  Also, if some really nice person has put together a little "how to" for staking and you have a link to share it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!
