looks easier than i thaught it would be, might bre ready in a few minutes

[13-Mar-19 06:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ON YOUR NOTRY!
```shell
komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKDIMXY3 migrate_checkburntransactionsource e8da42411b9d01e555b185559a3176ed44ceea7277a8a2ae1a6460e7f8b85743
```
take the TXOutProof hex from that( its pretty big) then use like this:
```shell
komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKDIMXY4  migrate_createnotaryapprovaltransaction e8da42411b9d01e555b185559a3176ed44ceea7277a8a2ae1a6460e7f8b85743 TxOutProof(from last step)```
then use `komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKDIMXY4  sendrawtransaction ` to send the returned hex value. 
Please post your txids to me here and I will test the import, I need 4 more apart from this one I made:

[13-Mar-19 07:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that works as expected... process is a bit ammoying ... but hey with the new migrate logic, we shouldnt ever need to use it.

[13-Mar-19 07:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It onyl needs 5 atm

[13-Mar-19 07:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Likely we could increase that if we were worried... but the way it works seems liek it would be extremly hard for notaries to create coins

[13-Mar-19 07:20 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Output from the RPC's could be cleaned a bit - hard to tell where the command ends and the return begins!

[13-Mar-19 07:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah it just retunrs a flat hex

[13-Mar-19 07:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think if we need to use this often ... a script or an oracle to automate the process would need to be built

[13-Mar-19 07:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Lets see how the MoMoM validation goes before wasting any more time on the backup solution

OK I will loop migrate for as long as my computer decideds to not freeze for, really need to try and fix that lol.... 
If anyone else can also do this, that would be good. üòÉ Just 1 coin every 30s with the version 4 script is good here. The more we can do, the more chance of a fail. Dont worry about chain bloat, we will start new chains ina  few days should this prove stable.

just hit backup tx's now

[13-Mar-19 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not sure how viable it is to see which backup tx it was that got accepted .. I dont think it currently logs this, it might be useful information ... but im not 100% sure how to get a log for that. 
As it logs exports then just feeds the export to a thread that processes it ... Kind fo turned out as a server script that can process all migrates for all users üòÇ

[13-Mar-19 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the first backup starts after 10mins of imports ... then ti will attempt to make a new one each minutes...it can only make a backup if another notarization has happened on KMD for the target chain.

[13-Mar-19 07:29 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
tbh - the script is mostly useless as a single larger migrate is the most common use case

[13-Mar-19 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes .. lol ...

[13-Mar-19 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just needed a way to test them without my script crashign out as te bash ones used to scweing results.. .and a way to resume them

[13-Mar-19 07:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But this one can now be deployed on a server,a dn ppl can send the export txns to it for processing to save runnigna  full KMD node

[13-Mar-19 07:31 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
If you can write in a payment process - you have a nice pay-per-use service

[13-Mar-19 07:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It would be centralised but that cant be that hard to do

[13-Mar-19 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is no chance of this service stealing coins. you submit export informationa dn pay a few sats or whatever. wait for funds to arrive in address.

[13-Mar-19 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pass the expor_*.txt as arg 1

[13-Mar-19 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
can also pass it failed_* files ... but I dont think those would pass

[13-Mar-19 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
make sure to keep the failed files if any are generated so we can investigate the why it failed...

Hi, been thinking about the donation address for the website ‚òù. And about to look g for a vanity address generator. Wondered how that would work with multisig. Any ideas?

[13-Mar-19 10:54 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, there's Decker's.

[13-Mar-19 11:03 AM] Alright#0419
@CrisF I've been asking some people if they're willing to be a singer for the multisig

[13-Mar-19 11:03 AM] Alright#0419
have 5 so far I believe, if anyone else would like to add a pubkey to it, please message me

[13-Mar-19 11:04 AM] Alright#0419
we'll have to get together about every other week and pass around transaction hexes until we get enough signers

[13-Mar-19 11:04 AM] Alright#0419
we have joker, me, smk, CHMEX and you?

[13-Mar-19 11:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Sure, I'll do it.

[13-Mar-19 12:11 PM] gt#2812
how many signers are you looking for?

[13-Mar-19 12:12 PM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant we're looking for another signer or two for the multisig which will hold KMD that will fund a stipend for notary tx fees. We will need to get together every other week or so and pass around a transaction until we have enough signatures. Please if you say you're willing to do it, understand what the responsibility of being a signer means.

[13-Mar-19 12:12 PM] Alright#0419
right now we have joker, me , smk, CHMEX and Cris

[13-Mar-19 12:12 PM] jorian#4555
i've been multisigning for over a year now

[13-Mar-19 12:18 PM] zatJUM#9924
```responsibility of being a signer means``` Could you explain?

[13-Mar-19 12:20 PM] Alright#0419
basically every other week, we'll have a list of notaries that say "I need some KMD for the next 2 weeks, please give me some.". Someone then needs to create raw transactions that will pay these notaries enough to cover tx fees for the next 2 weeks. These raw transactions will need to be passed from signer to signer until we reach the min sigs required. The last person will broadcast them

[13-Mar-19 12:20 PM] Alright#0419
Also requires looking at the actual raw txs and verifying that they are correct

[13-Mar-19 12:22 PM] Alright#0419
probably a very messy process at first, but I imagine we'll figure it out after doing it a couple times

[13-Mar-19 12:22 PM] zatJUM#9924
I have to learn how to verify a raw tx, but I can be the 8th one! üòâ

[13-Mar-19 12:26 PM] jorian#4555
it's not that hard. basic CLI knowledge is needed, someone will provide the string to sign

[13-Mar-19 12:27 PM] jorian#4555
copy pase, insert WIF and hit enter

[13-Mar-19 12:27 PM] Alright#0419
can just use `signrawtransaction` on a wallet that owns the pubkey

[13-Mar-19 12:27 PM] Alright#0419
not sure what you mean by insert WIF

[13-Mar-19 12:28 PM] Alright#0419
fek, @jorian hadn't thought about this

[13-Mar-19 12:28 PM] Alright#0419
how do you create txs that will claim the proper reward amount?

[13-Mar-19 12:28 PM] jorian#4555
with chainmakers we used a multisig too as input

[13-Mar-19 12:29 PM] jorian#4555
not that hard, it's just that you need to specify the inputs specifically

[13-Mar-19 12:29 PM] jorian#4555
claim KMD rewards?

[13-Mar-19 12:29 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[13-Mar-19 12:29 PM] jorian#4555
manually

[13-Mar-19 12:29 PM] jorian#4555

[13-Mar-19 12:30 PM] Alright#0419
I'd like to eventually have 2 multisigs. One hot, one cold. Setup some kind of faucet on the hot wallet

[13-Mar-19 12:30 PM] Alright#0419
then only thing needed would be the occasional transfer from cold to hot

[13-Mar-19 12:31 PM] Alright#0419
I don't trust an automated faucet system to hold large amounts of coins basically

[13-Mar-19 12:31 PM] Alright#0419
so hot wallet would only ever have what we're willing to lose if it's owned

[13-Mar-19 12:32 PM] Alright#0419
I'd say design a CC for it on KMDCC, but then we'll lose out on rewards

[13-Mar-19 02:22 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
```12 Signatories. 4 Dev, 8 top non-dev performing notary nodes. Community outnumbers devs 2:1, performace as top NN = demonstrated involement/reliability. This group has most to lose if SHTF, so least likely to cause a ruckus. 

Spread funds into 6/8 Mulitsig addresses: potential loss if 3 people absent or colluding for ransom. 

9 multisig addresses total. Mitigates loss to 11% of overall funds if 3 disappear/collude. 30% if 4 or 5 do. 6 unlocks 11%, and risks/ransom loss of extra 44%.
