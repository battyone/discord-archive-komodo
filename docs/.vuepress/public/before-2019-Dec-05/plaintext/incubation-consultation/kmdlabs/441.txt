i think learning linux, aaaaannnd its fast, helps

[02-Jul-19 12:17 AM] daemonfox#6136
It's where is started for staked

[02-Jul-19 12:30 AM] daemonfox#6136
Right

[02-Jul-19 12:30 AM] daemonfox#6136
A much better version too.

[02-Jul-19 12:34 AM] daemonfox#6136
LABS in AGAMA with an Iguana.exe prebuilt and a few buttons added to tools would open this to many more users.

How many pos64 coins exist now?

[02-Jul-19 12:42 AM] daemonfox#6136
ZEXO, K64, LABS, ???

[02-Jul-19 12:56 AM] Exile13#4458

@daemonfox OUR as well

[02-Jul-19 01:17 AM] Alright#0419
looks like DP is migrating to a pos64 chain as well

[02-Jul-19 01:17 AM] daemonfox#6136
Exactly.

pos64staker *should* work in windows, but I don't have a machine to figure out the dependencies needed

[02-Jul-19 01:18 AM] Alright#0419

The basics are fine and can be done in the CLI in current AGAMA

[02-Jul-19 01:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
But the address generation to get 64 unique segi priv keys needs to be a function in AGAMA.

[02-Jul-19 01:23 AM] Alright#0419
I need to launch THC, and will have much more time to focus on what we'll do for wallets(and LABS in general)

Joker is leading the KMD hard fork efforts, so he hasn't much time as well

[02-Jul-19 01:27 AM] Alright#0419
Anyway, I think the simplest option for now will be Verus Agama. Have plans for an electrum desktop app fork for a lite wallet as well

[02-Jul-19 01:27 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't look like KomodoOceanQT will ever support LABS, so we just need a wrapper for the daemon similar to how Agama functions

[02-Jul-19 02:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
You should be able to use versus a game for labs

[02-Jul-19 02:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Then stake by going into settings > cli

[02-Jul-19 02:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
And using `setgenerate true 0`

[02-Jul-19 02:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

Always stuck block 540

[02-Jul-19 03:01 AM] daemonfox#6136
And I've been doing that for ZEXO but on one address... The issue would be an avg user getting proper 64 segid addresses and then sending the funds with current AGAMA.

[02-Jul-19 03:02 AM] daemonfox#6136
It's possible... It's also very very manual and annoying. And unproven until someone shows they staked in AGAMA.

[02-Jul-19 03:04 AM] daemonfox#6136
For LABS anyways.

@PHBA2061  
This is my plan yes. But actually implementing it properly is not going to be so easy. 
Basically you can use the seed to generate a game, and all lelvels and items that are possible in this game. This doesnt stop someone not actually playing to game to get the item though. You could just generate games and dump the item stats until you get a game you want with good items then just take the items. Not a fan of having to handle all keystrokes liek rogue did, but it may be the only way to do it.

Anyone know why (in LABS - staked setup not notary, generating with pos64) why getbalance and z_gettotalbalance result in different amounts?? (z-gettotalbalance is significantly higher).

[02-Jul-19 07:28 AM] CrisF#3405
I can look into that.

[02-Jul-19 07:29 AM] CrisF#3405
Can you tell me a bit more about it? (I'm checking out their site)

[02-Jul-19 07:45 AM] CMaurice#1685
@Bar_F1sh_Rel  blackjok3r did say why getbalance and getbalance64 could be different, you may be able to restart with -rescan and have 'missing' 'found'

[02-Jul-19 07:48 AM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Just have to provide the ticker and links to where it can be traded on Graviex, from there the community can vote to give it a higher priority than other coin listing requests @CrisF

[02-Jul-19 07:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, looking into it now.

[02-Jul-19 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Managed to get Diablo1 built with RPC support, actaully adding game logic backing into komodod will be exteremely hard, but I think we can get somethign with no validation working quite easily. At least it allows players to buy/sell/trade players and items, althouth there is no way to enforce that they were not duped, but this has always been a problem for D1.

[02-Jul-19 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The open source D1 code is very very messy, having been built from a decompiler lol

This has taken a while. Finally works lol. 
I made a new way of tracking batontxid, well I think thats what it does. Its for putting large amounts of data spread over many tx's abnd being able to extract them back off chain very quickly. 
Seems I got the PoC to work. Now need to run some tests on how much faster it is.

[02-Jul-19 06:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems liek it will be useful for streamer things, aswell as the keystrokes stuff for games.

[02-Jul-19 06:20 PM] Alright#0419
keystrokes must be much quicker than ROGUE was for a game to be practical

[02-Jul-19 06:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Got one last part to get working tomorrow to make sure that it actually works. Right now someone could spoof the counter and fuck the data iuntegrity

[02-Jul-19 06:20 PM] Alright#0419
does that help?

[02-Jul-19 06:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes IO read most of rogue and gamescc today, and decided to stgart again üòÖ

[02-Jul-19 06:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its not the replay opf the game that seems to be the issue, but the tracking of the baton an dthe crazy IO being used tolookup transactions everywhere... 
When the scriptpbukey has data int eh Addressindex that is just instantly there, why not use it? üòÑ

That's dope

[02-Jul-19 06:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should be ok on that front, you need to BUY D1 to get the .dat file to actually play it.

[02-Jul-19 06:24 PM] Exile13#4458
Ya

[02-Jul-19 06:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The idea is to have items and players as tokens that can be traded. 
Each game has a create txid which makes an ujspentable address to where and random data can be dumped and sorted using address index. 
I think I can also make spendable utxos on these game address's that a player can sign locally, which is not possible using exising CC stuff, I need to get it working in komodod first.

[02-Jul-19 06:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Problem is ppl blasting the address's... Hopefully I can get a decent filter that prevents that being an issue.

[02-Jul-19 06:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Mostly messing with this to get new CC stuff working. Not sure if I have the skills to finish a full blockchain Diablo1 lol.

[02-Jul-19 06:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Trying to make RPC calls that create tx mor costly to do than the validation, that prevents spam attacks and such quite well.

@CrisF and @CHMEX you two have very consistent earnings on your LABS notary... Would you share your setup details and maintenance you do? Mine will almost match you at 100 every 1440 blocks but if I leave it to run after a day it drops to half that.

[02-Jul-19 08:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
Only after reboot and walletreset.sh will it run prime but quickly deteriorates.

[02-Jul-19 09:01 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @daemonfox , I'm not doing anything special with mine. I reset the wallet when it slows down too much and keep the node up as much as possi le.
I'll be changing the node around a bit soon, maybe later today, so will be interesting to see how that effects things.

[02-Jul-19 09:02 PM] CrisF#3405
Many people have said that uptime is very important and I found that true also.

[02-Jul-19 11:31 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Since so many folks piled their nodes into a small geographic area, location matters a lot

[02-Jul-19 11:32 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
since moving mine, my notarizations has tripled; so, we can all live in the EU or we need some diversity

[02-Jul-19 11:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
Damn lol... I was hoping the answer wasn't boiling down to latency.

[02-Jul-19 11:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
I can't do anymore to make that better I'm Max speed fiber direct to modem already with this machine.

[02-Jul-19 11:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
So then my question would be is it notary labs nodes or all labs nodes that would affect the latency

[02-Jul-19 11:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
Example if I had a few labs nodes just up and running near me would that help to create less latency?

[02-Jul-19 11:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
And can we say whether or not the location of staking labs nodes affects notarization latency?

[03-Jul-19 12:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I'm in Europe and CHMEX might be too. Not sure about the other nodes though.

[03-Jul-19 12:45 AM] CrisF#3405
I though Labs might be a bit more diversified that the KMD NN Test
Net but maybe not.

[03-Jul-19 12:50 AM] CrisF#3405
If anyone knows how to set up the latency stats vis smk762 and Mr. Lynch made on testnet might be useful to get it going in Labs.

[03-Jul-19 01:42 AM] daemonfox#6136
What is the context of that data splat

[03-Jul-19 01:42 AM] daemonfox#6136
Latency times of notarizations to come in until filled

[03-Jul-19 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its the latency from your node to all the other nodes. Its defiantly the largest factor, look at my node it hardly works being in Perth Australia, pings to EU are terrible 350-500ms lol

[03-Jul-19 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems that with all nodes clustered in EU we are having a huge problem with fairness, I'm earning nothing lol, but my node is free using extra VM on my main notary. I had some ideas about this, but we need the log stuff setup, need to wait until some ppl have free time and get cfek network up maybe to test some iguana changes. We are lucky with labs being a 2 month fork, if we can make an iguana that is less dependent on pings we can switch to it quite fast. Not possible on mainnet as any change would need to be hard forking to prevent cheating.

[03-Jul-19 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I know exactly what problem is, but its no easy fix. Seems baked into the design tbh.

[03-Jul-19 03:43 AM] CHMEX#0686
@daemonfox I reset the wallet after it has about 200 transactions in it. I don't restart unless it really does not notarize anymore. 8GB RAM and yes the node is in a well connected DC in germany.
I might move it and see how it performs. Before I run it in Switzerland and had slightly less notarization's but better hardware. So the internet connection is the difference in my case.

[03-Jul-19 05:37 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Mine is in Europe - but not a datacentre. I'm guessing my pings are down based on my performance, but I also run on older hardware so that could factor.

[03-Jul-19 06:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
old hardware makes a diffrence only to a point.

[03-Jul-19 06:15 AM] PHBA2061#2530
that's true, I'm running my node on an old laptop (located in France), still have a decent notarization performance ... at least until everyone decides to move their nodes to EU üòÇ

Hi @Bernz - Selling LABS,
I've applied for a listing on `Delta Portfolio tracker`.  Will let you know how it turns out.

[03-Jul-19 08:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Regarding ```I'd pay a small bounty for someone to put together a doc detailing how to start staking labs```, I wonder if @CMaurice  would be interested in that??

[03-Jul-19 08:53 AM] CrisF#3405
Pos64 is the origin of KMDLabs.  Quite a few of the guys here were involved in the original testing of that and in the follow on testing.
