but like it should reject byt all nodes...

[12-Feb-19 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not jsut nodes on a fresh sync

[12-Feb-19 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181

I need it to try and work out exactly how best to fix it

[12-Feb-19 04:31 AM] zatJUM#9924
@Alright why am I doing what ? o_O I was sleeping!

[12-Feb-19 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Your node was sp[amming like 500+ txs at once to mempool

[12-Feb-19 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Do I have to take an action?

[12-Feb-19 04:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[12-Feb-19 04:33 AM] Alright#0419
lol you don't know why that happened?

[12-Feb-19 04:33 AM] zatJUM#9924
no I was sleeping!

[12-Feb-19 04:34 AM] Alright#0419
your node sent about 1000 txs

[12-Feb-19 04:34 AM] Alright#0419
you have no idea why?

[12-Feb-19 04:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just check it out when your not sleeping man. Sorry for pinging you, ut it was indeed a very strange thing to happen

[12-Feb-19 04:36 AM] Alright#0419

That doesn't seem like an iguana bug, but ....maybe?

[12-Feb-19 09:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
will launching a coin with -ac_cc=762 (allowing fungibility) require notaries? or will it run without, but just not allow migrations?

[12-Feb-19 09:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and can notaries be added later?

[12-Feb-19 09:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm tryna setup an oracle capable chain. wouldnt mind fungability later, but not essential for now

[12-Feb-19 10:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can add a chain on your won cluster and we can notarize it yes... I am mofving development of notary pay to a new branch/chain... 
Unfortuantly Alrights DOS attack on dPoW can fork the chain still.. I have a solution... Trying to work out how best to implement it right now.. The LABSTRE chain no longer syncs... But it would be really good if you guys acan gblast migrates on CFEKTN and LABSST5 which is still working just fine  (because Alright cant really DOS it right now, due to PoS %)

[12-Feb-19 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When we launch the next test chgain for notarypay to test the dos again, we can add your chain to the notary nodes. You dont need it notarized unless you add a second chain, but I see no reason we cant use this infrustucture to notarize your oracle chain.

I will not be updating master branch until notarypay can take this DOS without forking... I know exactlyt what the issue is and and half way though a fix, but it totally hard forks it. 
So use master branch to launch your chain. üòÉ We wont break it.

[12-Feb-19 10:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cheers. So i just setup two nodes with my params following https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/installations/creating-asset-chains.html#part-i-creating-a-new-komodo-asset-chain , then let you know the details?

Yes, Cris should be able to help you. My advice is to use VerusHash11 algo unless you want Alright (or aanyone else for that matter) to go stalling it out on you. If its to be a apermenant chain, you can just use PoS ... on either equihash or verus shouldnt  matter which you choose. Verushash is CPU only, no GPU miners. 
I think 100% PoS chain works best on equihash if you go that way also.

[12-Feb-19 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would make a test chain for a few days and see how it fares... before launching anything permenant lol üòâ

[12-Feb-19 10:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
for now it's for test purposes, but  leaning towards PoS. Not intending for tokens to have public tradeable value, just want it to tick along so oracle stuff can happen

[12-Feb-19 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Try out a 100% PoS chain, no promises they actually work, you can test it for me üòÇ 
Its possible I broke them when fixing the staker, can easily be fixed if thats the case.

[12-Feb-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
100% PoS is the most secure for what you use it for. Depends though... because PoS with just 1 staker... if that node goes down the chain stops. lol

[12-Feb-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as we are seeing daily with my computer here freezing

[12-Feb-19 11:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll have 2 nodes staking hopefully that'll give it a better chance....

[12-Feb-19 11:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
no change of reviving if both go down at the same time?

[12-Feb-19 11:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
was gonna ac_staked=99

[12-Feb-19 11:34 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, I'm not sure.  I've never done a 100% staked.  It would be to test.

[12-Feb-19 11:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll try ac_staked=100 if that protects me from Alright's shenanigans

[12-Feb-19 11:35 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha

[12-Feb-19 11:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
99 will aswell.. the higher the % the less chance he has of doing it... Unless you give in staking weight or he buys enough of it...

[12-Feb-19 11:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its really the most annoying attack ever...

[12-Feb-19 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And it only applies to chains that have like 0 hashrate

[12-Feb-19 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but we cannot launch with this DOS being possible apparenbtly üòÇ  
I have a solution anyway... wil be launching a chain in a while... I wish I had the script he was using to do it, so I could do it... lol to test the thing...

[12-Feb-19 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
He may be a while till hes back

[12-Feb-19 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
With PoS % you can set it at anything and if there are no miners, the PoS will just mine 100% of blocks. Like on CFEKTN üòÉ

[12-Feb-19 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The higher the % obviously the more control you have over the chain from bad miners Trying to break your chain for lolz.

[12-Feb-19 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The solution is a little unfair... but unless under attack the notaries would still get paid the average they are owed. 
What I had to do was, calcualte the amount they are paid from 2 notarizations ago, so that the amount owed is from a state of chain that is itself notarized. That way a continious reorging of the chain, will simply stop notarisations all together until the attack stops, and once it stops normal operations will resume without forking the chain, creating the situation in LABSTRE where the chain contains an invalid block on sync. 

It was still possible for miners to include 2 notarizations in a block under a very very special case. I think that is now fixed. But this does mean that 3 notarizations have to happen BEFORE anyone can be paid. This will remove the "bonus for notarizing first" üò¶

To Komodo community! In MARMARA CHAIN, We are testing the settlements in Marmara credit loops to see if redemption is made according to top-to-bottom approach or not. If pubkey-1 has not enough with Marmara, it should be redeemed from pubkey-2 and so on to the last holder in the credit loop. We need to test with 3 or more nodes in credit loops. Please make a report for each test.

made progress though... I have a solution...

[12-Feb-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Use notarized data to calculate how much notaries get paid.... then it doesnt matter what freeking block they get paid, if its reorged 1000 times or 1.

[12-Feb-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
All the stupid DOS attack will do is stoop notarisations happening all together.

[12-Feb-19 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well.. I finally worked it out... It took a long time... But this is how it shoudl ahve worked fromt the beginning.. The only problem, is that the notaries who get paid, are paid for the notarisation that happened previous... Over tiem though it will average out just fine. I would assume.

[12-Feb-19 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
As long as notarizations happen every 5 blocks msot of the time...

[12-Feb-19 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The payment will alwyas be the same.. average pay over time is linear...

[12-Feb-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I'm sure NN ops will not die if they are 20 minutes "behind" in getting paid üòõ

[12-Feb-19 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I agree... only iof there is a long gap, the nodes who actually make the first notarisation will not be the ones who get the big payment lol... its the next lot... averages will take care of it though.

[12-Feb-19 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

[12-Feb-19 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This was the plan all along... so notarizing becomes like a form of mining.

[12-Feb-19 03:03 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
What notarization data are you using?

[12-Feb-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I modified the Komodo State structure then spent about 3H getting it to update on deamon load and when adding a checkpoint to insert a new integer with the previous notarized height, and the one previous to that again. 
This way, to calcualte how much to pay out, its using not the current notarisation, which can be reorged outof the chain, but the previous one which has been notarized itself (or at least it should have been, in any real world application)

[12-Feb-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The issue only comes, when syncing the chain, there can be an invalid block , becase a node that isnt onlone to see the reorg cant see the previous notarization in the chain as usually its confirmed 1 tx later... I also made this so it cannot under any circumstance have more than one notarisation in a block... which in and of itself will stop the DOS 99% of the time anyway.

[12-Feb-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
When not under attack, the chain will never fork or fail ... when under attack notarizations wont really happen... and ntoaries wont really get paid...

[12-Feb-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But who is going to 100% attack a PoS/PoW chain just to make notaries not get paid? Seems unlikely.
