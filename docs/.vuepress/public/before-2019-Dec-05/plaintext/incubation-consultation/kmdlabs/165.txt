i noticed some issues when staking earlier, so now I tend not to do it unless I;m not doing anything else

[17-Dec-18 04:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
staking tends to be touchy.. or broken 😂

[17-Dec-18 04:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that this has finally sorted it though.

[17-Dec-18 04:14 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it was a good earner while I was working on the front end 😄

[17-Dec-18 04:14 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but seemed to mess with pool and oraclerpcs

[17-Dec-18 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not like other staking algos tho ... its needs  dedicated core and daemon ... kind of a large draw back I guess... cant stake on a Pi or something.

[17-Dec-18 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that said... I doubt theres any other stakers out there that can deal woth 100,000 utxos in a single wallet 😄

[17-Dec-18 04:16 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
market it as an antiwhale feature lol

[17-Dec-18 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its like the exact opposite of that

[17-Dec-18 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[17-Dec-18 04:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Having a very fast CPU and shit loads of coins gives you a huge advantage

[17-Dec-18 04:17 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
umm... then market it as a prowhale feature? 😂

The 2700X here on full boost 4.3Ghz singel core is miing every block atm ...

[17-Dec-18 04:18 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I shut off my gfx cards

[17-Dec-18 04:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yep O doubt they could get any blocks lol ... the diff in insane ...

[17-Dec-18 04:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
way too many coins ..

[17-Dec-18 04:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this definatly breaks the difficulty algo

[17-Dec-18 04:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I only noticed the loop fail cos user account funds were draining way too fast

[17-Dec-18 04:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha ...

[17-Dec-18 04:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess next I need to actually move all these coins to segids and see if Alrights sctipt can handle 50,000 utxos

[17-Dec-18 07:05 PM] CMaurice#1685

@blackjok3r any idea why it's sucking up so much? or why the "2 hrs"?

[17-Dec-18 07:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to do the wallet reset

[17-Dec-18 07:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Iguana has a bug

[17-Dec-18 07:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Obviously I'm going to have to port my fix down here

[17-Dec-18 07:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Will dontomrrow and make ping tonstaker group

[17-Dec-18 07:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its pretty simply but with these chains stalling all the time I didn't want to do it

[17-Dec-18 07:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
As it involves sending the valance to your self on a crown tab

[17-Dec-18 07:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ram use seems about normal

[17-Dec-18 07:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
These chains are too long for 4gb vps now

Its not actually using that

[17-Dec-18 07:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181

it's only "meaningless" when you don't own the hw 😛

[17-Dec-18 07:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure what u mean, I have nonswap file on my notary node VMS and iguana is like 170gb there

[17-Dec-18 07:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a measure of how much it could use but not how much its using

[17-Dec-18 07:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181

`207.148.4.183` too, but it's rebooting atm

[17-Dec-18 08:01 PM] zatJUM#9924
How do you restart only one chain without using ./start.sh?

[17-Dec-18 08:01 PM] zatJUM#9924
On a notary node, I mean 😉

[17-Dec-18 08:02 PM] zatJUM#9924
like this: ```komodod -ac_name=CFEK -stakednotary -pubkey=x```?

@LabsAssistant  utxosplitter.sh is updated in latest StakedNotary 
This has a work around for iguanas bug where it fails to split ... I think regardless if that ever gets fixed or not this is a good change anyway as you no longer need to manully send balance to self in case it gets stuck for some reason.

[18-Dec-18 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Having that config.ini is pretty awesome lol ... doesnt even require you guys to change anything. It just works.

```this node has an outrageous wallet ... no wallet should ever be in this state```
Yeah but you find immature coins from wallet rotation scripts 😜 
Wallet size ballooned to 580MB, but I found 90 coins on the pioneers notary!

[18-Dec-18 06:39 AM] Mylo#8306
I’ve scrolled pretty far up looking for info on what is “ram staker “.  Is it a farming method from regional Australia?

[18-Dec-18 06:40 AM] Mylo#8306
Sounds like some cool PoS testing going on

[18-Dec-18 06:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
“ram staker “ is the name james gave to the PoS staking mechanism in komodo 
iirc, it's because it does most of the processing "in ram" in advance of actual block time

[18-Dec-18 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not exactly

[18-Dec-18 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What it does is load the walelts unspents and everything it needs to stake with them into an array

[18-Dec-18 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it will re use that array

[18-Dec-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until it finds a block, or 10 minutes expires

[18-Dec-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it clears it and reloads the wallet

[18-Dec-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It stops someone dwy attacking the wallet with dust to prevent you staking blocks.

[18-Dec-18 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and also with vast amounts of utxos its just loads faster.

[18-Dec-18 08:20 AM] Mylo#8306
great thanks @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 & @blackjok3r  - is dwy what csw calls "satoshi shotgun"?

[18-Dec-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess so .... labs is basically totally immune to such things

[18-Dec-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notary nodes have a lock down mode, when once funded cna be set to never accept transactions

[18-Dec-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the staker uses the ram staker

[18-Dec-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I will change the notary wallet filter to just do that, rather than its first iteration we use now, where it automatically filters anything unbder 1 coin.

[18-Dec-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a bit complicated

[18-Dec-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
althoug it works just fine

[18-Dec-18 08:24 AM] Mylo#8306
cool man, sounds good.

[18-Dec-18 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`chain tip changed during staking loop t.1545136006 counter.0`

[18-Dec-18 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This is a new one ... likely always should have been there but due to a deadlock in the deamon was never able to actually work

[18-Dec-18 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think possibly iof this "fix" is safe... PoS64 will now actaulyl work peoperly all the time

[18-Dec-18 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ie.. not inconsistent blocks

@blackjok3r if your new staker fixes "shitting out blocks", short of making it a hf what's to stop someone from rolling back the changes and getting an unfair advantage over "fixed"

[18-Dec-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What I meant by that is .. that the difficulty will now adjust peoperly

[18-Dec-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if they did that ..

[18-Dec-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they would just end up witht a broken daemon

[18-Dec-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am finding MORE blocks with this version

[18-Dec-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
becasuse no body else has it

[18-Dec-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it actually pulls out of the loop

[18-Dec-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and resets itself on a block arriving

[18-Dec-18 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the difficulty will now adjust peoperly`
which would need a hf else forkfest

[18-Dec-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem to be the case

[18-Dec-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what happens is

[18-Dec-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the stakign nodes all start stkingt and just keep on staking... regardless of weather a block has been received in that time

[18-Dec-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cant say fort sure this will be good or bad...maybe it will amke difficulty rise even more
