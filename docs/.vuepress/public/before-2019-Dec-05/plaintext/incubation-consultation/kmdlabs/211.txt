Yes, there was/were fork/s out there.

[09-Jan-19 01:17 AM] CrisF#3405
I believe that one of them may have been notarized (?!)
Could be wrong there.

[09-Jan-19 01:18 AM] Alright#0419
yes there was a fork of Y that was notarized. That's why it was so much trouble

[09-Jan-19 01:19 AM] CrisF#3405
`X` was also a bit of a pain

I might try and add something similar for migrations before the test

[09-Jan-19 01:57 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, congrats! Already #6 😃

[09-Jan-19 02:28 AM] daemonfox#6136
So what is being tested nnow?

[09-Jan-19 02:29 AM] daemonfox#6136
my node was shot after I moved so i need to rebuild one anyways so new IP is updated

[09-Jan-19 02:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Migrations!
@daemonfox

There will be bounties.

@Alright @blackjok3r Re: bounties
This is a good (the first) chance to test out the KMDLabs bounty payment system.  Might be nice to work out any bugs (in the system).  What do you think?

@blackjok3r Seems migrations are smooth now after yesterdays fixes ```Total migrations amount: 1000

mining node still has some problems

[09-Jan-19 06:27 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm over 6 hours without a notarization on `X`

[09-Jan-19 06:29 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The block explorer may not be on the same block as you CrisF

[09-Jan-19 06:30 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
x that is, it is 6hrs since the last block

Poor wording, sorry. Do I need to have the komodo repo on my machine as well as the /staked/ repo for it to work?

[09-Jan-19 06:33 AM] CrisF#3405
Staked repo.

Yeah i've built that, but I have no .komodo, wasn't sure if I needed that

[09-Jan-19 06:35 AM] CrisF#3405
You can find komodo in staked/master

[09-Jan-19 06:35 AM] CrisF#3405
komodod and cli in there.

[09-Jan-19 06:46 AM] CrisF#3405
When you start the CFEKX/Y for the first time you might get something about config.ini

[09-Jan-19 06:47 AM] CrisF#3405
If so give a shout.

[09-Jan-19 06:47 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Just working through the .komodo stuff now. Looks like it was taken out of the buildkomodo.sh script

[09-Jan-19 06:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
`KeyError: 'ADDRESS'
 ABORTING!!! pubkey invalid: Please check your config.ini
`

[09-Jan-19 06:49 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I tried the `./komodo-cli getnewaddress` as per the direction but it says the chain isn't running, to get the address, to then start the other chains

[09-Jan-19 06:50 AM] CrisF#3405
In `staked` ```cp config_example.ini config.ini
nano config.ini```

[09-Jan-19 06:51 AM] CrisF#3405
I used wallet info I got from a new one I made on another setup.

[09-Jan-19 06:51 AM] CrisF#3405
(just regular komodo to make the address)

[09-Jan-19 06:58 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
```Radd=$(komodo-cli getnewaddress)
pubkey=$(komodo-cli validateaddress $Radd | jq -r '.pubkey')
privkey=$(komodo-cli dumpprivkey $Radd)

configtemplate="$PATH_TO/example_config.ini"
cat "$configtemplate" | sed "s/btcpubkey =/btcpubkey = ${pubkey}/" | sed "s/wifkey = /wifkey = ${privkey}/"  | sed "s/Radd  =/Radd  = ${Radd}/" > $PATH_TO/config.ini
```

[09-Jan-19 06:59 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
so the komodo directory inside staked repo still holds all the files to run komodo, and is needed

[09-Jan-19 07:02 AM] CrisF#3405
.komodo is still in the home folder and hasn't changed I believe.

{Reactions}
💯 👌 

[09-Jan-19 07:05 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Count this as the idiot test for your readme file in the /staked/ repo 😉

[09-Jan-19 07:08 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Is running a komodo node a requirement for a Labs node, or is it just for the notaries?

[09-Jan-19 07:08 AM] CrisF#3405
haha, that was me.

[09-Jan-19 07:08 AM] CrisF#3405
No kmd node needed.

[09-Jan-19 07:08 AM] CrisF#3405
]It will be for migrations though.

[09-Jan-19 07:09 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
May as well d/l the chain then hey

[09-Jan-19 07:09 AM] CrisF#3405
I think Blackjok3r was looking at changing that, but not yet.

[09-Jan-19 07:10 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
KMD just had a required update for pools, do you know if that's been incorporated, not sure how it's all setup sorry

[09-Jan-19 07:10 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah. My original vps didn't have enough memory without a swap.

[09-Jan-19 07:11 AM] CrisF#3405
There is also a bootstrap that saves time and nullifies the memory troubles I had.

[09-Jan-19 07:12 AM] CrisF#3405
There hasn't been any notification here, but it might be coming .

[09-Jan-19 07:16 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I have a decent enough VPS, so should be fine. Have to let it sync for now. Will continue in the morning 😃

[09-Jan-19 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can use ./start.sh CFEKX noconfig`

[09-Jan-19 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to avoid using config.ini

[09-Jan-19 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but then change will go to change address and all kinds of unwanted things lol

[09-Jan-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I went to sleep leaving migrate blkasters on., and all the minng nodes on CFEKY ? is it locked up

[09-Jan-19 07:38 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm getting this again ```************************

``` on a mining node I restarted this morning.

[09-Jan-19 07:38 AM] CrisF#3405
CFEKX

[09-Jan-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah there is a node still mining and seeding a fork

[09-Jan-19 07:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Y is working for me.

[09-Jan-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe it was X

[09-Jan-19 07:39 AM] CrisF#3405
X has been messed up for hours.

[09-Jan-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
explorer says alst block 6H ago

[09-Jan-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im testing a fix now... tbh just wildly guessing at this

[09-Jan-19 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nfi at all what causes miner to lock up

[09-Jan-19 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we might need to start a PoS chain, like CFEK was or soemthing.,... made some changes to the miner and need to test that it works for PoS chains.

[09-Jan-19 08:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Used that bootstrap I made for CMaurice and greentea.  It go me passed the ferked block on X.

[09-Jan-19 08:29 AM] Alright#0419
we'll likely experience a similar problem on mainnet at some point, so it would be worthwhile to figure out how to sync it without a bootstrap

[09-Jan-19 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a fork

[09-Jan-19 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is all

[09-Jan-19 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
A notarised fork I think at athat

[09-Jan-19 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we can avoid this happening by moving to a new protocol version at launch

[09-Jan-19 08:30 AM] CrisF#3405
The first time I was stuck on 906 stop/start worked.

[09-Jan-19 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just need to use connect= /.... I have not been able to reproduce this sync issue once despite syuncing them like 30 times

[09-Jan-19 08:31 AM] CrisF#3405
I believe smk got by that by deleting and a few tries.

[09-Jan-19 08:32 AM] Alright#0419
my point is that if there is ever a fork like this on mainnet, we should figure out how to fix it without the need for a bootstrap to sync

Was this the same trouble that CMaurice got a backtrace on ?  Or was that a different problem?

[09-Jan-19 08:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
diffrent

[09-Jan-19 08:35 AM] gt#2812
mine was fixed once the lib fix was pushed

[09-Jan-19 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah yours was just on wrong version some how...

[09-Jan-19 09:03 AM] Mylo#8306
for your migration load test competition and seeing as you're working on visibility (via explorers), how about making some logos for your chains and getting those coins into agama as another form of visibility?

[09-Jan-19 09:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, we have them ready.

[09-Jan-19 09:12 AM] CrisF#3405
What's the best way to get them on there though, haha.

there si a folder called overly .... I kept the BTN one... someone who know websites needs to edit that

[09-Jan-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then I think you copy it over or something not 100% sure though

[09-Jan-19 09:18 AM] CrisF#3405
re: Agama, do you mean just getting the coin logo in there?  Without having an actual coin yet? @Mylo

[09-Jan-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Me and Alright discussed this, the simplest way is to add the main chain to Agama with SPV only... that way agama doesnt need to bundle our daemons
