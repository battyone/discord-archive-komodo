I was considering hybrid pos/pow so users can hodl and stake to cover oracle read/write

[03-Jan-19 01:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Not sure of best ratio tho

The stats are for launch.  It's more of a dream list atm.  There are some basics that would be good for launch.  Others can (hopefully) be added after.

[03-Jan-19 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the chain has low value the staking % will just be near 100% anyway.

[03-Jan-19 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which isnt a bad thing... but making the PoS% liek 50% and then it sitting at 90% may make it look bad...

[03-Jan-19 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just pushed possible fix for the error I was having last night... this may possily be a hardforking change... Not sure what will happen tpo CFEKING it might go liek FEKED soon.

can someone pin this plz ^

[03-Jan-19 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Fix worked... But I have a feeling that now all your guys nodes wont be able to decode the new burn transactions... so this is now a hard forking change... We need to destroy all chains. and Make new. ASAP @Alright

[03-Jan-19 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even if its just 2 chains

[03-Jan-19 02:18 AM] Alright#0419
Pinned a message.

[03-Jan-19 02:19 AM] Alright#0419
can do it now, master branch?

[03-Jan-19 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes weems to be ok... just 2 chains in a new cluster

[03-Jan-19 02:19 AM] Alright#0419
need anything in particular?

[03-Jan-19 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
PoW only

[03-Jan-19 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
keep it simple

[03-Jan-19 02:19 AM] Alright#0419
why?

[03-Jan-19 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we need to test migrates

[03-Jan-19 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can make then whatever you like

[03-Jan-19 02:19 AM] Alright#0419
gotcha, couple minutes

[03-Jan-19 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just need it to test migrates

[03-Jan-19 02:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe keep CFEK

[03-Jan-19 02:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but remove all the chains in his cluster

[03-Jan-19 02:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That chain was bein heabily used... might be worth keeping a little longer

[03-Jan-19 02:22 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, might be good to have a larger chain for testing too.

[03-Jan-19 02:23 AM] CrisF#3405
To add more variables later on?

[03-Jan-19 02:24 AM] Alright#0419
what do you mean larger chain?

[03-Jan-19 02:24 AM] Mylo#8306
do oracles migrate?

[03-Jan-19 02:25 AM] Mylo#8306
the data and all configs (e.g. data providers and subscribers)?

[03-Jan-19 02:26 AM] CrisF#3405
A lot of data stored in them.  (Not sure if that makes a difference, but might look like a more realistic simulation later on.)

[03-Jan-19 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Oracles cannot migrate no

[03-Jan-19 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The burn tx, is a very simple tx... It is a coins sent to OP_RETURN (which means they are burnt) and in that OP_RETURN is the tx itself... So that the import chain can deocde it for needed information. You can only migrate coins at this stage ... I would say its posible to migrate small amounts of data with modification, but it would be a hard fork... In fact thats exactly what we just did... We added more data to the migrate burn tx so that it contains the name of the chain the burn happened on, as previously that was un knowable.

[03-Jan-19 02:32 AM] Alright#0419
@Mylo best you can do is validate that an oracles tx happened on a different chain

[03-Jan-19 02:32 AM] Alright#0419
but you need the full transaction to begin with to test if it's on a different chain

[03-Jan-19 02:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Really starting to get my head around this cross chains stuff... It has a lot of limitations, but is still very powerful. Trick seems to be in really having an exact plan of how the contract works before starting to make it.

[03-Jan-19 02:34 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah ok. was just a Q that popped into my head.   as alright says, just republish.....trust or use a cross chain tx verification.

@CrisF @blackjok3r so you want to know total supply of a given chain in a cluster.   i'll take this as a sample to create a stats web service.

how long does `coinsupply` take to return on kmd main chain?  i've been waiting a few minutes.     doing it on main chain with 5 blocks or 50 blocks is instant.  50000 blockheight takes a few fractions of a second...

[03-Jan-19 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So knowing the ins and outs of everything before you ttry to make anything is kind of required... its not a great idea to trial and error these things.

[03-Jan-19 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just use `gettxoutsetinfo`

[03-Jan-19 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I worte all that on the pad already

[03-Jan-19 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how to do that

[03-Jan-19 02:35 AM] Alright#0419
@Mylo it will take literally forever unless you do it in chunks

[03-Jan-19 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It ignores z-txs though

[03-Jan-19 02:35 AM] Mylo#8306
yep.   james wrote a response to a Q i had similarly about limitations.  about discovery

[03-Jan-19 02:35 AM] Alright#0419
so do like `coinsupply 50000` then once that is finished `coinsupply 100000` then `coinsupply 150000` ....

[03-Jan-19 02:35 AM] Mylo#8306
oh well, lets see if it affects notarizations!

[03-Jan-19 02:35 AM] Alright#0419
or try larger numbers if you want

[03-Jan-19 02:36 AM] Alright#0419
but if you just do `coinsupply` on a fresh KMD node, it'll take literally forever

[03-Jan-19 02:36 AM] Alright#0419
the rpc call will time out before it ever finishes

[03-Jan-19 02:36 AM] Mylo#8306
ok.  thanks. i'll kill it

[03-Jan-19 02:38 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r -ac_cc=?

[03-Jan-19 02:39 AM] Alright#0419
105 it is....

[03-Jan-19 02:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry was making coffee... anything new 105 is fine.

[03-Jan-19 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK so, what we will do here. We should keep CFEK... It will no longer be a cluster, it can be oracles chain. Its already full of oracles so we may as well leave it as that.. It will be a good test to try and speed those up some more, they can still be slow on validation. 
There will be 2 new chains cluster 105, just and only for testing migrates. To make sure this new hardforking change is stable, and the new `getimport` rpc works. These two can also be used to create the stats gathering scripts for the oracle project of @CrisF 's . I will need to leave here for a fair while soon, so hopefully we get it started, and enough people have updated by the time I get home and we cna get testing. üòÉ

[03-Jan-19 03:07 AM] Mylo#8306
so with your coinsupply across different chains, that's going to be handy to put into an oracle, and have multi-sig signing ??  otherwise, you trust one node to write the coinsupply data?

[03-Jan-19 03:07 AM] Mylo#8306
e.g. multi-sig sign coinsupply amount every 10 blocks into opreturn, then oracalize this opreturn data?

[03-Jan-19 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont really know how it will turn out ... its more to teach everyone how to use the stuff...

[03-Jan-19 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oracles are centralised

[03-Jan-19 03:25 AM] Alright#0419
@Mylo the idea so far has been we'll provide the scripts to verify it yourself or you can check an oracle of someone you trust that is using the same script

[03-Jan-19 03:25 AM] Alright#0419
maybe not the best solution, but it'll work for now I believe. I do like your idea

[03-Jan-19 03:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the main idea of cris idea, is so we can visualise the coin movements...

[03-Jan-19 03:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and log errors into oracles on chain... to teach ppl how to use it

[03-Jan-19 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
putting that data in the oracle is more of an excersise IMO... rather than some end game solution

[03-Jan-19 03:29 AM] Alright#0419
the only data we need to push into oracles is data from a different chain IMO

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[03-Jan-19 03:30 AM] Alright#0419
error logs can just go into something like debug.log

[03-Jan-19 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
exactly ... thats why I added my feature request.. I want every notarisation logged on the main chain...

[03-Jan-19 03:30 AM] Alright#0419
is smk doing it?

[03-Jan-19 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
He said yes... but hes a busy man

[03-Jan-19 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we should look at using D isntead of S ? can fit 2x the data in there then?

[03-Jan-19 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator I'd refrain from posting an oraclesdata tx for every single notarization if possible

[03-Jan-19 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
shoudl work much the same

[03-Jan-19 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
yep, didn't realize that until earlier today

[03-Jan-19 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I read it earlier too... didnt know you could use D lol ...

[03-Jan-19 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
S allows you to see the data as human readable in oraclessamples though

[03-Jan-19 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
D needs a dapp to convert it

{Reactions}
ü§î 

[03-Jan-19 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats how I did it in streamer ... it takes hex string in, then converts it to actual binary data... so it cna fit 2x more data in.

[03-Jan-19 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ihave C code and C++ that does it all... mostly stolen from james, that should be able to be proted to any language.

[03-Jan-19 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
I think D is the way to go as it would be rare to be using oracles without a dapp

[03-Jan-19 03:34 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r   @Mylo Yes, that is what I was thinking.
And also to have an easy way (plug in a script) for noobs like me to collect stats on their tests and output to visualize.
Also easy to drop the logging script into any test script (ie. migration script) so test organizer can easily see the results of everyone testing and collect more data.
That could also be useful for anyone to verify the data.

Sorry BlackRhino üòÉ

[03-Jan-19 03:37 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r give it hex and it gives back hex

[03-Jan-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah ... so you need to pass it an array of numbers, much liek the streamer works... I think.. At least I have some understanding of all that from my work there, was a while ago tho.

[03-Jan-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181

building this komodod is PITA again ...

[03-Jan-19 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we inherited some build bug from upstream... either that or me disabling komodo-tx has broken it... it does build.
``` ./stop.sh
cd ~/komodo
git pull
./zctuil/build.sh -j8
git clean -f
make -j8
(might need git clean and make again)
cd ~/StakedNotary
git pull
