I heard about some software (could be lies) that lives at the kernal layer on linux and can spread single thread loads over multiple threads... taht would help a lot 游땏

[20-Apr-19 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
on a non-labs related note, @blackjok3r, do you know what causes
`block hash 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 does not exist!`
in stdout on my pool wallets?

`can spread single thread loads over multiple threads...`

I managed to forget I was halfway through a wallet reset on testnet when I started making LABs chains. 
sent funds away, killed chains, replaced wallets, imported privkeys... forgot to send funds back

we are almsot exactly equal with FSM, huge changes pushed upstream, its omportant we test this before this code is merged to main net.

[20-Apr-19 02:59 PM] CrisF#3405
Showing same mask

[20-Apr-19 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I made some very small changes for LABS 0BR chains, that shouldnt affect anything. But all our fixes for MoMoM are pushed, and when merged to mainnet will probably cause havok lol

[20-Apr-19 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
most of it was manual patches, by memory of what was required and what wasnt. So we need to really test this well

I know man. I dont either but for this... unless that server is used from something else. Sorry man, but we had to reindex KMD before, and that code for obvious reasons cant be pushed upstream so I had to fix it so that we can use a normal KMD chain

if you do not thrust public bootstraps, why not using custom bootstraps that you create yourself ? (just to avoid to resync the whole chain)
