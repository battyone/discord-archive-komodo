[10-Oct-18 12:20 PM] Mylo#8306
even crap gui, there will be mistakes, you'll want to re-do it.  so just do it.

[10-Oct-18 12:20 PM] CrisF#3405

If I recall correct, eqMigrate parallel failed due to attempting to migrate to same address at same time. Is this still an issue?

[10-Oct-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the only issue was that there is a MoMoM mismatch

[10-Oct-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
from KMD and the STAKED chains at times

[10-Oct-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so the import TX simply cannoy validate

[10-Oct-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it needs a longer delay to be fixed, but the only person who nows how to code that is libscott

[10-Oct-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[10-Oct-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[10-Oct-18 12:44 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Bike trips not much downtime. Camping along the way?

[10-Oct-18 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure he didnt say much else apart from he be about a month in gernamy riding bikes

[10-Oct-18 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and he said he would be able to be contacted, but has only responded to me once... so I just left it

[10-Oct-18 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and moved on to other things

[10-Oct-18 12:46 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
push or motor?

[10-Oct-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pretty sure he said cycle

[10-Oct-18 12:48 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[10-Oct-18 01:08 PM] Mylo#8306

[10-Oct-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no way

[10-Oct-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the only chains we have still alinve are in this file: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StakedChain/StakedNotary/master/assetchains.json

[10-Oct-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ctrl +a/b m

[10-Oct-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then right click to make the margins wider and left click and drag

[10-Oct-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ctrl a/b  shift + "   to split down and shift + % to split across

[10-Oct-18 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ctrl +a/b c to make a new window

[10-Oct-18 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
some on the vms on my server have like 10 windows each ful of panes

[10-Oct-18 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[10-Oct-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
right now i just using tmux and a bash script to amke the TROLL box... because its the fastest for me to do

[10-Oct-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and I think everyone here will be able to use it

[10-Oct-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am nearly finished TROLL box btw if anyone is still around.

[10-Oct-18 01:44 PM] Mylo#8306
yes stick to bash, my makefile suggestion is good for some things, not all i've discovered today getting cc_gui stuff going for conventions for others to use.

[10-Oct-18 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I wanted to make somethig like Tonyx TUI ... but the more I looked at it, I figured it was just better with a tmux, start.sh STAKEDTROLL on one side and a couple of scripts.

[10-Oct-18 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
one to get faucet ...

[10-Oct-18 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
whcih tbh is hell annoying...

[10-Oct-18 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I should have made faucet 1000 instead of 100.

[10-Oct-18 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you somehow manyage to spend 100 coins .... you need to make a new config.ini to get more coins

[10-Oct-18 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but you can claim 3 times on first load

[10-Oct-18 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think at some point I might need to make a script to create a config.ini... getnewaddress, validate it get pubkey and dumppriv

[10-Oct-18 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
good thing seems to be you can use the same username and password from dirrent wallets.. so its not really an issue

[10-Oct-18 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I mena 100 coins is like millions of messages though I think

[10-Oct-18 01:51 PM] Mylo#8306

mad

[10-Oct-18 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that will come in handy, although 1 faucet get is 100,000 messages

[10-Oct-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
currently the user needs an address already, it would be good to gen one then restart the daemon automatically

[10-Oct-18 02:12 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
someehow the space in assetchains.json fro TROLL genproclimit broke my jq. Too fuzzy to fix it now tho

[10-Oct-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont want to go too far on a bash implemntation though... but I guess if people want to chat from terminal they can use this

[10-Oct-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah it might do that...

[10-Oct-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I assumed it was using listparams

[10-Oct-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to change listparams.py quite a lot with the new changes

[10-Oct-18 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
your jq script ight not work any more üò¶

[10-Oct-18 02:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I was planning to nodejs some stuff, though might use something else.

[10-Oct-18 02:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
bash is good for concept, but has its limit

[10-Oct-18 02:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll mod to listparams, keeps thinks standard

[10-Oct-18 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah ... currently the whoe thing is a mix of python and bash, becasue noth have advantages ... I just use both for diff jobs... its not pretty but it works good

[10-Oct-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like there are a lot of files...

[10-Oct-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
trying to work out how to get the ./send to worj without quotes atm ... I think I have an idea.

[10-Oct-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
man its being a prick

[10-Oct-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it has quotes when i echo it, but trying to send to cli call its not working.

[10-Oct-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe I need to send with curl

[10-Oct-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[10-Oct-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
