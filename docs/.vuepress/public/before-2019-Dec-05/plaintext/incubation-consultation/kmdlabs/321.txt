CPU wassnt enough however

[04-Mar-19 04:23 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I got `Block 142970 : PoS 50% vs target 50% `

[04-Mar-19 04:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah its 50% now

[04-Mar-19 04:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems its just not bing mined/staked to me

50559 utxos on chain

[04-Mar-19 04:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so it cant be utxo not elegibe stall

[04-Mar-19 04:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just isnt bein mined or staked.

it's almost certainly stalled because there are no eligible utxos to stake

while *his* might not be eligible, it's impossible for there to be 50k UTXOs on the chain and 0 elegable is what joker was getting at

playing around with oracles yet?

aren't you storing patent info on chain?

Yes that is what were are building.  We havent started using the chain that way yet.

[04-Mar-19 05:29 PM] Alright#0419
oracles CC makes it dead simple to store arbitrary data on chain

[04-Mar-19 05:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
op_return itself isnt bad... just need some other way to lcoate the data

[04-Mar-19 05:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
oracles makes that very easy and fast

[04-Mar-19 05:30 PM] Alright#0419
and index it

[04-Mar-19 05:30 PM] Alright#0419
oracles > OP_RETURN simply because it's indexed very easily

[04-Mar-19 05:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
depends what you want it for...

[04-Mar-19 05:30 PM] Alright#0419
yep

[04-Mar-19 05:31 PM] Alright#0419
combination of the two would be good

[04-Mar-19 05:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pushed fix for  bad-txns-vout-negative error. Limited vins to 25, likely to be able to go higher, the actual limit would be around 50 I think, but it depends on the size of the transaction. 25 vins seems reasonable. And with the single RPC being made the artificail limit likely wont be needed as it can check its over size before sending the export transaction.

[04-Mar-19 05:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
imports seems going smoothly here with the changes to iguana. Just need to amke the entire process use notarized data now so that Alright cant break it. :troll_thuglife:

the diff wasnt that hight when I first checked it. ONly goes like that once PoW gets over the target %.

BTW... 1566 completed imports, no fails 游땏

[05-Mar-19 05:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm found some code in iguana wher it used to fetch the notaries from the daemon. Might reenable it as it simply fixes our restart  to change era problem I think. Might have a play with it while waiting for tests on migrates. It would really help if you guys can also migrate on the LAB cluster, if anyone needs coins I have plenty on my staking node can send.

[05-Mar-19 06:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1962 completed export/import, one export every 30s. Seems fixed. Merging FSM to master and will update all chains to use master branch  as FSM merge down syncs them all fine. No doubt there are more improvemnts to be made here, but we need many days of migrates to test it is 100% working. Will try to setup something  tonight to just loop them for a week on both cluters. 
We also need to add a chain and make sure my hack to make sure chains can start notarizing actaully works, it all seems ok. Defiantly needs to be tested though.

[05-Mar-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
great progress!

[05-Mar-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks. As usual I was over thinking the solution, but there could still be possible issues due to heavy reorgs. So we will need to test that and make sure the chain wont fork. I think maybe to fix the problem of transactions getting lost due to constant reorgs, when the blocks transactions are put back into the mempool it should force broadcast them all, like when you send the transaction. This technically would prevent notartizations being lost, which will really mess with it.

[05-Mar-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as they get reconfirmed I dont see any problem with it, unless the attack continues for many hours.

[05-Mar-19 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The new RPC calls should also wait for notarizations rather than a single confirm like the current script is using, I think that will make it a fair bit safer, but as soon as an export happens and a notarization is lost, then there is a chance for lost coins.

[05-Mar-19 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant Please `./start.sh` to update all deamons back to master branch so the non LAB cluster chains get the latest fixes.

[05-Mar-19 08:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
had a thought last night about oraclisation of migrates on fungible clusters. Let me know if this sounds useful -
-periodically, get RPC data for coin supply, block height and ntxheight for each chain in cluster.  
-coinsupply - (change in block height * mining reward) = migrated/burnt coins (foreach chain in cluster).
-test(sum of migrated/burnt coins from each cluster == 0)
-align the above with ntxheights so lag doesn't affect the equivalence.

[05-Mar-19 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sounds useful for sure.

[05-Mar-19 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
getimports RPC is still there. As are the fixes to use explorer, which could also be used to fetch the data.

[05-Mar-19 08:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
from that, could graph the change in coinsupply over time between the chains in cluster

[05-Mar-19 08:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that would be really nice for sure. I think with the latest master imports are safe... but maybe it needs to be a bit more agressive in its overlap. Cant really tell without a very long test, and somehting like that will enable tracking of the supply better than my bash script... which of itself makes issues for very olong loops, as if a daemon crashes or somehting it just locks the VM and any export in progress the coins are lost 游땭

[05-Mar-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i think to wait until a height is notarized twice will remove most all the edge cases

[05-Mar-19 08:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. Its not possible to do this for the nootarizations them selvs, but the migrate process itselg should definatly be doing this.
