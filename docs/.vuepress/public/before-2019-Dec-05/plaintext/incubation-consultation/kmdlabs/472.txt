@LabsAssistant please do `./start.sh`. Added a chain to test some things with adaptive pow. If you get ` Starting CFEKAPOW Failed: help human!` just run it again

`failed to update please build manually using ~/komodo/zcutil/build.sh to see what problem is!`
so, what's the problem it shows when you run`~/komodo/zcutil/build.sh`?

[23-Aug-19 12:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
and reading that i think ill git pull and manually build each  after caffeine

[23-Aug-19 12:47 PM] jorian#4555
yeah i guess it's one of those errors where you have to run build.sh like 5 times before it actually builds

[23-Aug-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[23-Aug-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
