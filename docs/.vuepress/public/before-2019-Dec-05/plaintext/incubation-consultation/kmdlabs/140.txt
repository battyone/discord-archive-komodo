Yeah, end goal is direct communication between device and chain without particle console

[03-Dec-18 03:05 AM] CrisF#3405
@@axo777  Looks like an interesting project.

[03-Dec-18 03:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
At the moment it curls it

[03-Dec-18 03:06 AM] axo777#1232
GPS Signals probably arriving in API's, cell network signals, RFID readers in warehouses, hospitals, retail stores, libraries, etc, etc are the targets here.  If we can build a working group to start testing we hopefully can have one or 2 working samples to show people.  I really like the DragonHound work you did @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

[03-Dec-18 03:07 AM] axo777#1232
What kind of signal is coming in from particle.io?

[03-Dec-18 03:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Basically, aim is data visualization of iot via oracle. Still lots to do tho. Its a big landscape.

[03-Dec-18 03:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I set firmware to report lon/lat and battery. Small json string. Curls to oracle, with aes encryption. Front end queries and decrypts for display.

[03-Dec-18 03:10 AM] axo777#1232
I have one user who I have talking about our features, tx/sec, etc. who just attended a blockchain conference.  He said that all of the presenters there were hesitant about their capabilities regarding speed, scalability and privacy.  All issues we have met.  This user has nice API's for the data source and many end users ready to sign up after a successful test(s).

:treasure:

[03-Dec-18 03:13 AM] axo777#1232
yes indeed if we make it come true.

[03-Dec-18 03:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Gps data rate is long interval to conserve power, but continuous streams are doable. Once Dragonhound done, Ill work on something over wifi instead of 3g to test that side of it.

[03-Dec-18 03:15 AM] axo777#1232
What you describe is a lot more work than an API feed that can come with its own map

[03-Dec-18 03:17 AM] axo777#1232
The data feed I have to work with is a burst every 5 or 10 minutes, but with more data than you are mentioning.  Too expensive to do continuous.

[03-Dec-18 03:20 AM] axo777#1232
How can i twist your arm to do this API project next.  It really is low hanging fruit.

[03-Dec-18 03:22 AM] axo777#1232
Seems like this will be our first real big commercial project

[03-Dec-18 03:23 AM] axo777#1232
All of the built in capabilities that Komodo gives AXO are incredible.

[03-Dec-18 03:25 AM] axo777#1232
lol

[03-Dec-18 03:26 AM] CrisF#3405
What would be Involved in the real-world test..

[03-Dec-18 03:27 AM] axo777#1232
Set up a small network, maybe with AWS or Oracle

[03-Dec-18 03:30 AM] axo777#1232
Have GUI's where the user can create his own asset chain and make his own CC to track his product from origin to destination.  Then when the goods have reached the buyer, the CC would pay the seller or make an account payable in favor of the seller.

[03-Dec-18 03:30 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r could probably sort that out through KMDLabs fairly easily.

[03-Dec-18 03:31 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r could probably sort that out through KMDLabs fairly easily.

[03-Dec-18 03:33 AM] CrisF#3405
I think he may ha e a solution to your 'more data' problem.

[03-Dec-18 03:34 AM] axo777#1232
I think we should make webform templates so all that needs to be saved to the blockchain is the key data.  Legal boiler plate, for example, can be stored clientside.

[03-Dec-18 03:34 AM] CrisF#3405
Be good to hear what @Alright  say too.

[03-Dec-18 03:35 AM] axo777#1232
I think jl777 said that we will have double the storage with the next upgrade.

[03-Dec-18 03:36 AM] axo777#1232
Look forwad to @Alright's comments and @blackjok3r  as well

[03-Dec-18 03:42 AM] CrisF#3405
What are the key difficulties here?

[03-Dec-18 03:47 AM] axo777#1232
I suppose getting the CC to function the way we want it too and be manipulated by the GUI's.  The webforms are pretty straight forward, but tedious.

[03-Dec-18 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c you pushed a fix for download bandwidth, it was still using excessive upload during sync,this was days ago, will merge latest and test again today.

[03-Dec-18 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@axo777 I will read all that shortly.

[03-Dec-18 03:55 AM] Alright#0419
@axo777 `We need to design a smart phone app that will register and pay the fee and upload its edge signals to the Oracle CC` That's where I would start. You need some way to create transactions, signing them and broadcasting them without the actual chain

[03-Dec-18 03:55 AM] Alright#0419
or just crypto conditions SPV

[03-Dec-18 03:56 AM] Alright#0419
You could use trusted explorer to at least broadcast them. Creating them and signing them might not be so easy

[03-Dec-18 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not really... You could have a private RPC on some server runningthe full chains... like how smk's works

[03-Dec-18 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
disable all/mosyt wallet functions and SSL it

[03-Dec-18 03:57 AM] Alright#0419
smart phone app tethered to a remote daemon would make that easy

[03-Dec-18 03:58 AM] Alright#0419
but impractical for end users I imagine

[03-Dec-18 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats how smks works yeah ...

[03-Dec-18 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ideally someone wirtes a lib that can build CC txns

[03-Dec-18 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like bitcoin-js that the stratums use.

[03-Dec-18 04:00 AM] axo777#1232
When I said user friendly, i meant user friendly.  I have thousands of end users.  They all have desktop computers and can handle web pages and no more.  We have to make the blockchain invisible for them.

[03-Dec-18 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
so either create crypto conditions SPV(or something similar) or each user needs a fully synced daemon

[03-Dec-18 04:02 AM] Alright#0419
you could host the daemons yourself in docker containers for example if you're looking to be more of a service provider

[03-Dec-18 04:02 AM] Alright#0419
but that's a container for each and every user

[03-Dec-18 04:03 AM] axo777#1232
We will provide the node for the users but they interact with them via GUI.  Nothing more.

[03-Dec-18 04:03 AM] Alright#0419
well then it's like developing any GUI

[03-Dec-18 04:03 AM] axo777#1232
yes

[03-Dec-18 04:04 AM] Alright#0419
Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm confused what you're asking from us

[03-Dec-18 04:04 AM] Alright#0419
just advice? you looking to hire devs? test contracts?

[03-Dec-18 04:05 AM] axo777#1232
I would like to learn how to code, but there is no time so I need devs to do it plus testing

[03-Dec-18 04:07 AM] Alright#0419
I can walk your through how to best utilize oracles for your purpose, but i have 0 experience building GUIs

[03-Dec-18 04:07 AM] Alright#0419
I think there is a severe lack of GUI devs around the ecosystem in general

[03-Dec-18 04:08 AM] Alright#0419
only a handful, and they're all busy 24/7

[03-Dec-18 04:08 AM] axo777#1232
Let's build a work group and assign tasks to the specialists in their area.

[03-Dec-18 04:09 AM] Alright#0419
If you find a GUI willing to work on it, I can walk them through the lower level things

[03-Dec-18 04:09 AM] Alright#0419
once you wrap your head around oracles, it "just makes sense"

[03-Dec-18 04:10 AM] Alright#0419
unlocks a ridiculous amount of potential IMO

[03-Dec-18 04:10 AM] axo777#1232
Will this work for a non-blockchain GUI guy?

[03-Dec-18 04:10 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[03-Dec-18 04:10 AM] Alright#0419
They really don't need to understand blockchain much at all

[03-Dec-18 04:11 AM] axo777#1232
Then maybe I can do it myself.  I used to code PHP websites

[03-Dec-18 04:11 AM] Alright#0419
have you played around with oracles yet?

[03-Dec-18 04:11 AM] Alright#0419
do you know if it'll suite your needs or will you need additional contracts

[03-Dec-18 04:12 AM] axo777#1232
only read the code and it is still sinking in

[03-Dec-18 04:12 AM] Alright#0419
best way to learn it is just doing it

[03-Dec-18 04:12 AM] axo777#1232
time is my enemy on this right now

[03-Dec-18 04:13 AM] axo777#1232
my users want a demo in January

[03-Dec-18 04:13 AM] Alright#0419
I read the comments in oracles contract about 30x before I just gave up and started coding something for it

[03-Dec-18 04:13 AM] axo777#1232
not to 30x yet

[03-Dec-18 04:14 AM] Alright#0419
don't bother is what I mean

[03-Dec-18 04:14 AM] axo777#1232
whew, that was close

[03-Dec-18 04:14 AM] Alright#0419
are you familiar with python at all? I can show you a few examples

[03-Dec-18 04:15 AM] Alright#0419
or even bash

[03-Dec-18 04:15 AM] axo777#1232
I am just finishing the python introductory course so I have a ways to go

[03-Dec-18 04:16 AM] Alright#0419
I can give you quick and dirty intro course if you're willing to learn

[03-Dec-18 04:16 AM] Alright#0419
maybe just show you how to use it to interact with the daemon

[03-Dec-18 04:16 AM] axo777#1232
for sure I am willing to learn

[03-Dec-18 04:17 AM] Alright#0419
you have a dev machine ready right now?

[03-Dec-18 04:17 AM] axo777#1232
learning is one  of life's fun thigs to do

[03-Dec-18 04:17 AM] axo777#1232
MacBook Pro

[03-Dec-18 04:17 AM] Alright#0419
just build komodo from jl777/dev branch

[03-Dec-18 04:17 AM] Alright#0419
I'll create a chain you can sync, and we'll work from there

[03-Dec-18 04:18 AM] axo777#1232
how much HD do I need?

[03-Dec-18 04:18 AM] Alright#0419
the python may not help with GUI development, but I hope we can use it to at least teach you how oracles works

[03-Dec-18 04:18 AM] Alright#0419
not much at all

[03-Dec-18 04:19 AM] axo777#1232
Golang?

[03-Dec-18 04:19 AM] Alright#0419
No experience with it

[03-Dec-18 04:19 AM] Alright#0419
lol I can show you examples in bash or python

[03-Dec-18 04:19 AM] Alright#0419
or just try to explain it

[03-Dec-18 04:19 AM] Alright#0419
but I think examples will help you understand it much quicker

[03-Dec-18 04:20 AM] axo777#1232
that swagger API template is sort  of similar to what is needed

[03-Dec-18 04:21 AM] Alright#0419
just figure out how to send rpc commands to a daemon with it

[03-Dec-18 04:21 AM] axo777#1232
GUI-wise

[03-Dec-18 04:21 AM] Alright#0419
and we'll both learn it lol

[03-Dec-18 04:21 AM] Alright#0419
what I want to teach you is how oracles itself works and how you might use it

[03-Dec-18 04:21 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't matter how we go about doing that

[03-Dec-18 04:22 AM] axo777#1232
ok

[03-Dec-18 04:22 AM] axo777#1232
thanks
