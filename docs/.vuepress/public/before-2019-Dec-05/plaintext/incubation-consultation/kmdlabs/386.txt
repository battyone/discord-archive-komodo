@LabsAssistant validate that you get the same results please

[20-May-19 03:15 AM] Alright#0419
Over the next couple days we'll be kicking this into high gear. We'll be launching Wednesday rain or shine. If you want to change your pubkey(highly recommend for anyone that has leaked their key *cough* @CrisF @blackjok3r @Alright *cough*), please PR a new key to KMDLabs/komodo ASAP

[20-May-19 03:16 AM] Alright#0419
highly recommended to change your key anyway

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator what are test comps?

[20-May-19 08:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
like the payments game comp we did a couple weeks ago

[20-May-19 08:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
basically when we have a new bit of tech that needs testing, we try and make a comp out of it to make sure things work or find bugs and vunerabilities

[20-May-19 08:06 AM] bit_chipper#6010
comp as in competition?

[20-May-19 08:06 AM] bit_chipper#6010
bug bounty type thing?

I don't find same results. What block should I use? Tried with 3 different hashes and never got same results

[20-May-19 08:27 AM] zatJUM#9924
And if I use block 576868 (the one right after), I get ```['Alright_example',
 'strob',
 'mrlynch'```

[20-May-19 08:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @bit_chipper ,
Yes, usually bug bounties and a type of competition.

[20-May-19 08:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Last one was a game/competition with with prizes and some bug bounties were put up separately.

[20-May-19 08:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @zatJUM 👋
 The formula is this: ```the hashes shown there are sha256(blockhash + handle/name + message)
they're sorted by closest to 0```
@Alright  and @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator can confirm.

use NNvote.py script with blockhash https://insight.bitpay.com/block/00000000000000000023324a2e8a2c5fff1bdf84651a9a0c38bee310e0ee7e6f

can I get a refresher on how to submit a new pubkey?

[20-May-19 03:10 PM] CMaurice#1685
`Radd=$(komodo-cli getnewaddress)
pubkey=$(komodo-cli validateaddress $Radd | jq -r '.pubkey')
privkey=$(komodo-cli dumpprivkey $Radd)`

[20-May-19 03:10 PM] CMaurice#1685
sub $Radd with the address

[20-May-19 03:11 PM] Exile13#4458
A PR too?

[20-May-19 04:30 PM] phm87#7395
Explanation of Alright;
Start it with ./komodod -ac_algo=verushash11 -addnode=195.201.20.230 -addnode=195.201.137.5 -ac_ccenable=226,236 -ac_supply=1000000 -ac_name=CFEKORC -ac_reward=1000000000000 -ac_blocktime=1800 -ac_sapling=1 -ac_cc=102

then komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKORC validateaddress $(komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKORC getnewaddress)

Going to have a smoother process next round. I'll be redoing the lottery TUI, so it's not just hard coded to that single oracle

[20-May-19 05:36 PM] Alright#0419
@zatJUM were you able to validate the results?

[20-May-19 05:37 PM] Alright#0419
need to be careful when you paste that blockhash, no line breaks, spaces, extra characters, etc

that is an explorer thing. also happens with txids

No change for me - keeping same pubkey for production.

[20-May-19 07:42 PM] zatJUM#9924
Is it possible to keep same pubkey for production?

[20-May-19 07:43 PM] zatJUM#9924
Alright told we would have to change

[20-May-19 07:43 PM] wookie#7663
@Alright are you familiar with the pos64staker instructions that is setup for OUR?

[20-May-19 07:45 PM] wookie#7663
I followed @Crabby Paddy 's pos64staker setup and got to staking. I set RNDsendmany at 65, then 10% variance as he recommended. 
Immediately after that I checked getinfo, the chain is sync'd, but my balance is 0....??? Is that correct??

[20-May-19 07:45 PM] Alright#0419
you don't need to change it @zatJUM

[20-May-19 07:45 PM] Alright#0419

So I keep mine, no problem!

[20-May-19 07:46 PM] Alright#0419
@wookie I made it, not sure what you mean though

[20-May-19 07:46 PM] wookie#7663
which part are you not sure?

[20-May-19 07:46 PM] Alright#0419
ok walk me through what you did

[20-May-19 07:46 PM] Alright#0419
did you use genaddresses or importlist

[20-May-19 07:46 PM] wookie#7663
genaddresses

[20-May-19 07:47 PM] Alright#0419
ok, so you have OUR.json in that same directory?

[20-May-19 07:48 PM] wookie#7663
yes

[20-May-19 07:48 PM] wookie#7663
yes. then I imported my wallet and .conf from my desktop wallet onto the vps

[20-May-19 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
can you take one of those addresses from that json and do `komodo-cli -ac_name=OUR validateaddress <address>`

[20-May-19 07:49 PM] Alright#0419
yea if you replaced the wallet, those keys aren't imported to the daemon

[20-May-19 07:49 PM] Alright#0419
use `importlist` option

[20-May-19 07:49 PM] Alright#0419
then type `OUR.json`

[20-May-19 07:52 PM] jorian#4555
for official notary node, i have my own komodo fork already on github. how can i also fork KMDLabs/komodo repo, change my pubkey and PR it back?

[20-May-19 07:53 PM] Alright#0419
update FSM branch on your fork, edit that file and PR it to master branch of KMDLabs

[20-May-19 07:53 PM] Alright#0419
I think? 😅
