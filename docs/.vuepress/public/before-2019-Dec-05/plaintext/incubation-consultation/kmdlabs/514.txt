someone mining with 34.82 KSol/s?

[11-Nov-19 11:23 AM] CrisF#3405
It might be good to see have an autopsy on `CFEKMYLO`?  Could be useful to know the cause.  Then a new chain or 2 added?  What do you thinks @Alright @blackjok3r ?

for CFEKMYLO, my NN and the pool seem to match in all states

I merged a lot of upstream code.

If chains broke... that is not good.. Will investigate when I am able, no time

ive got 8 connections on both MYLO chains...

[11-Nov-19 02:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
unless we have non NN on those chains...

[11-Nov-19 02:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
there should be enough to nota both chains...

[11-Nov-19 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`unless we have non NN on those chains...`
there's at least 3 nodes that I know of that aren't NN, but beyond that I have 30 cons for mylo and 24 for mylo6

[11-Nov-19 02:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
everyone got 5 coins as well unless they filtered it out

[11-Nov-19 03:48 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
if you mean network, true-ish as can be, it's a backwards look at blocks to estimate what it would have taken to create them

[11-Nov-19 03:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
^

[11-Nov-19 03:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
so we need to match that to help move this along... and then wind it down

[11-Nov-19 03:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
that under 2 sols is 2 threads on the 2700X thats underpowered

[11-Nov-19 03:49 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
each block you find will gradually lower the diff

[11-Nov-19 03:49 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
but if you add too much hash it will go back up

[11-Nov-19 03:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
right... looks like someone put a small GPU on it and then let it hang

[11-Nov-19 03:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
just finding this block is going to drop it a good amount... wasnt there a lower bound of how far diff can drop?

[11-Nov-19 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
no, there was something bigger before that and the GPU brought it down a bit

[11-Nov-19 03:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
gotcha some z9ed it lol

[11-Nov-19 03:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
is that on one of the pools with asset chains?

[11-Nov-19 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`wasnt there a lower bound of how far diff can drop?`
yes, I forget how much, but it will only drop x amount per block max

[11-Nov-19 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`is that on one of the pools with asset chains?`
mininglabs.rocks has all the chains we notarize

[11-Nov-19 03:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
k... i may point the GPU rig at it to see if we can force a block and then cut it off

[11-Nov-19 04:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
there it went

[11-Nov-19 04:17 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
part of the "problem" is that it's designed to assume that miners never leave

[11-Nov-19 04:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
yuck... PoW weakness in a NN network

[11-Nov-19 04:18 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it's not really a weakness that test chains stop, it's part of the process

[11-Nov-19 04:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
this is one of those scenarios where i think they On Demand block production feature would be useful

[11-Nov-19 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it's only an issue if we don't do our part when it *does* move

[11-Nov-19 04:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
So this is good....

[11-Nov-19 04:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
this presents a use case that needs to be addressed for enterprise data entry

[11-Nov-19 04:20 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I'm pretty sure mylo *is* "on-demand"

[11-Nov-19 04:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
On Demand would be something like this...

[11-Nov-19 04:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
Until there is data in the mem cache for a TX (data entry or just a tx to move coin) none of the nodes will allow a block.

[11-Nov-19 04:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
They would still hash till they got an answer but hold it... till data came in to work on

look down that list at how many on-demand chains are regularly mined
`Until there is data in the mem cache for a TX (data entry or just a tx to move coin)`
so miners make a 0fee tx and do the same as already

gross...

[11-Nov-19 04:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
i saw you guys talking through that

[11-Nov-19 04:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
what advantage do you get on a chain that has no rewards?

[11-Nov-19 04:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
as in...

[11-Nov-19 04:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
a set of pure data entry chains

[11-Nov-19 04:25 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
me personally, my NN has better stats the more chains that constantly move

[11-Nov-19 04:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok... not sure how to qualify that...

[11-Nov-19 04:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
in this perspective, I am looking at the NN network as being owned nodes geographically spread within owned physical infrastructure of a company... no one needs to be paid... the chains just need to do their work without real miner rewards

`not sure how to qualify that...`
As I'm a dick willing to make a point, even if no one but me cares about my point?

[11-Nov-19 04:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
lmao point taken

[11-Nov-19 04:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
in that instance, every empty block is wasted money

[11-Nov-19 04:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
sigh... i didnt take my mini off the pool fast enough... it blew through 6 blocks and bumped the diff to 152

[11-Nov-19 04:32 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`every empty block is wasted money`
but gained opportunity to make @Alright complain about block storage 游땓

[11-Nov-19 04:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
evil

[11-Nov-19 04:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
but those are the exact minutia we want to dig intoi and squash

[11-Nov-19 04:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
maybe make a new param to add to the launch strings...

[11-Nov-19 04:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
that allows for a check that denies blocks that have no data and no fees

[11-Nov-19 04:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
that way the option is there

[11-Nov-19 04:34 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
you really can't squash chain movers without penalizing "actual" users

[11-Nov-19 04:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
and can be put to the test

[11-Nov-19 04:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
"actual" meeans what... what qualifies that? a fee paid... or just anyone that can spawn a daemon should be given free transactions for life?

[11-Nov-19 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`that allows for a check that denies blocks that have no data and no fees`
so you're forcing people to pay fees for a block that they wouldn't have to otherwise

[11-Nov-19 04:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
pay a fee for the block you put data into...

[11-Nov-19 04:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
yea

[11-Nov-19 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`"actual" meeans what... what qualifies that?`
I dunno, this is your theory, not mine

[11-Nov-19 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
游땥

[11-Nov-19 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`pay a fee for the block you put data into...`
Why should they be forced to pay a fee if I'm willing to mine it without one?

[11-Nov-19 04:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
because one miner does nbot make the NN network

[11-Nov-19 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
(me being the miner, not necessarily me personally)

[11-Nov-19 04:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
and the fee isnt a fee

[11-Nov-19 04:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
not really... because there is no payout

[11-Nov-19 04:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
there are no earnings

[11-Nov-19 04:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
there are NO MINERS

[11-Nov-19 04:38 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`because one miner does nbot make the NN network`
NNs should be there to notarize, not impose random rules that bypass consensus

[11-Nov-19 04:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
personally

[11-Nov-19 04:38 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`there are NO MINERS`
then there are NO BLOCKS, ever

[11-Nov-19 04:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
in this deployment, you and I are not participants

[11-Nov-19 04:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
the miner is not a person

[11-Nov-19 04:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
there is no one to pay
