I highly doubt that to be possible

[22-Jan-19 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Unless they have a ccvout attached to them always that tracks where they came fr

[22-Jan-19 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
why do the chains have to die at any given time?

[22-Jan-19 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
keep it running

[22-Jan-19 03:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So notaires don't need a super computer to keep the all

[22-Jan-19 03:18 PM] Alright#0419
our notaries are 4core cheapo VPSs

[22-Jan-19 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
if nobody runs it,then cant complain your coins are lost

[22-Jan-19 03:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There are no coins on them anyway and a backup will be saved to the meta chain

[22-Jan-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so import all the coins off the chain when it is not active used.

[22-Jan-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
are these on demand chains?

[22-Jan-19 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No

[22-Jan-19 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`our notaries are 4core cheapo VPSs`
because the worry is that some rando will ds a dead chain?

[22-Jan-19 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But making them need stake weight kind of males them that

[22-Jan-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
a chain not being used wont use much resources, especially if nobody is mining it

[22-Jan-19 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Exactly.... But if there are no blocks for x time and it's not possible to make one... Notaries can sadly remove them as long as a copy exists... Which the meta chain provides... So all notaries have them anyway.. Just not running using ram

[22-Jan-19 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Meta chain coils use HDD... As its on demand blocks and is only used when uploaded to or downloaded from

[22-Jan-19 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`and it's not possible to make one`
What is the imagined scenario that you guys see this as ever being a thing?

[22-Jan-19 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
U need to create enoufht blocks to do enough notarizations

[22-Jan-19 03:22 PM] Alright#0419
2% under target % @ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉

[22-Jan-19 03:23 PM] Alright#0419
and no UTXOs to stake

[22-Jan-19 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
With new staked rules, if they work it would be more like 99% of remaining %... With a couple of utxo over 1.

[22-Jan-19 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`2% under target %`
That's why we have these things called "CPUs" and "GPUs" and this thing called "PoW"

[22-Jan-19 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Staking exponentially rises in staking power against pow now... If it works

[22-Jan-19 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Again once the chain has stopped for some time, its stopped... If its dropped with supply... Then it can't be considered dead ever

[22-Jan-19 03:25 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
and if the fear is we don't have the ChainX coins to do PoS, I ask for the quadrillionth time:
Why don't we have CoinX coins?

[22-Jan-19 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Or to be more to the point, once notaries change over

[22-Jan-19 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Genie, using a cluster means the chains are fungible... My tired system make sure chains in main cluster, are the one that will get used... The ppl who launch them at least expect that.

[22-Jan-19 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Because it cost them money

[22-Jan-19 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
To make it they get help along the way for cheap

[22-Jan-19 03:27 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
If the chain is fungible it would be mined or staked, if everyone stops then whoever is left can stake easily?? Easy way to make money?

[22-Jan-19 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no block reward apart from tx fees so doubt u would get money on dead chain

[22-Jan-19 03:29 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`Genie, using a cluster means the chains are fungible...`
Yes, I get that
CoinY might be on ChainX
I get that
I *don't* get what would happen to were *no one* that is active in the LABS ecosystem wouldn't have > 0 ChainX

[22-Jan-19 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Exactly what I'm saying... I think..

[22-Jan-19 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If all coins are gone then its dead

[22-Jan-19 03:31 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Ahhh, but if the reward is zero - it costs more than the pegged cpu can earn back - unless staking is super efficient (<1% cpu)

[22-Jan-19 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I can't see a scenario where none of us have CoinX or hash-power __and__ something of value is still on ChainX

[22-Jan-19 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
游뱡游낗

[22-Jan-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
likely there will be some coinX stranded, but if it is 10 or so coins, really it seems not any big deal

[22-Jan-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
just a cost of burning a chain

[22-Jan-19 03:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Exactly...

[22-Jan-19 03:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It wouldn't need much utxo left by the time the chain stops

[22-Jan-19 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`but if it is 10 or so coins, really it seems not any big deal`
That was my point if value coins are off the dead chain and all that is left on the dead chain is dead chain coins, then why would it matter

[22-Jan-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
it might be dead chain coins, but they represent LABS

[22-Jan-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so 10 coinX being stranded is like 10 LABS being stranded

[22-Jan-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
but still it seems not the end of the world

[22-Jan-19 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
just the end of 10 LABS

[22-Jan-19 03:35 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
PoW with cb value of 0?

[22-Jan-19 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Exactly thanks for getting me @jl777c

[22-Jan-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
unless something a lot more than 10 coinX (LABS) will be stranded, it seems this is a non-issue and just the way it works. after it is decided that coinX wont be notarized anymore then people have time to burn/import them back to LABS mainchain

[22-Jan-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
in the event some notaries decide to start notarizing again, all that can be gained are the 10 coinX that were stranded, which is not wrong by any means if they do

[22-Jan-19 03:38 PM] Alright#0419
I think it'll be fine. I was more worried about unintentionally stalled chains that we'd struggle to unstall

[22-Jan-19 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Don't think it can happen... Unless my new staked is fatally flawed

[22-Jan-19 03:39 PM] Alright#0419
Maybe the last staker assumes there are other people stakingand move coins off

[22-Jan-19 03:39 PM] Alright#0419
then no eligible utxos exist to start it back up

[22-Jan-19 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Even then... E ough was can do enough blocks to move a chain with 0 diff to 50 blocks

[22-Jan-19 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`I was more worried about unintentionally stalled chains that we'd struggle to unstall`
I'm still not seeing how that's an issue 游땟

[22-Jan-19 03:40 PM] Alright#0419
fuck it, wasting time talking about it

[22-Jan-19 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
stalled chain would mean a bug with PoS that needs to be fixed

[22-Jan-19 03:40 PM] Alright#0419
just need to see it in action and figure out what is practical

[22-Jan-19 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah going from 0 diff to 128 cores of aws will get any migrate thru I think without iasue

[22-Jan-19 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Like even 20/cores slowly introduces

[22-Jan-19 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
that's what I'm saying, any super-hash needed would be a short term thing

[22-Jan-19 03:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah.. For sure. Even with no changes to staker diff

timestmp - timestamp

[22-Jan-19 06:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just started 2 chains....

[22-Jan-19 06:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
same as taht one but with the right diff adjustment, that one was squared .. bit much

[22-Jan-19 06:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and then the same again but with 1 million coins, instead of 10,000

[22-Jan-19 06:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
same distribution/number of utxo

[22-Jan-19 06:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
at same block

-ac_staked=90 -ac_algo=verushash11 chains I started yesterday moving just fine

[22-Jan-19 06:33 PM] Alright#0419
did one with 10000 coins, another with 200 and they are both within 10 blocks of each other

[22-Jan-19 06:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nice

[22-Jan-19 06:34 PM] Alright#0419
200 coins though?

[22-Jan-19 06:34 PM] Alright#0419
weren't you aiming for like 20k?

[22-Jan-19 06:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is an exception in that code taht might be dangerous

[22-Jan-19 06:35 PM] Alright#0419
what?

[22-Jan-19 06:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it just limits the max blocktimew to 200s

[22-Jan-19 06:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you look at the actaul blocktimes, the PoW wil be like a second of 2

[22-Jan-19 06:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and terh PoS will be 200s

[22-Jan-19 06:46 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r weren't you trying to calibrate this so it would require ~20k coins staking to keep a chain moving?

[22-Jan-19 06:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[22-Jan-19 06:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You gfuys said that was too much

[22-Jan-19 06:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So i tried 10k

[22-Jan-19 06:47 PM] Alright#0419
200 works fine with VHT branch

[22-Jan-19 06:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its working I think.... U can withdraw way more off it than that I think.. but limiting blocktime means that it could fork.. multiple utxo elegible to stat at once

[22-Jan-19 06:48 PM] Alright#0419
200 coins is enough to keep a ac_staked=90 -ac_algo=verushash11 chain moving

[22-Jan-19 06:48 PM] Alright#0419
just to clarify

[22-Jan-19 06:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on VHT branch ? It should do

[22-Jan-19 06:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it has a max blocktime

[22-Jan-19 06:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
may work with 1 coin

[22-Jan-19 06:50 PM] Alright#0419
pretty confused

[22-Jan-19 06:50 PM] Alright#0419
what is this branch for

[22-Jan-19 06:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was an experiment ?
