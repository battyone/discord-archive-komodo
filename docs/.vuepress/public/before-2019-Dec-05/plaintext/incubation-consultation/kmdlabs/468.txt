That is ok. Did you make a diffrrent dpolistunspent from the one I just committed?

No I used codd of yesterday bug I have 4 params in btc while you have 2 in kmd

[21-Aug-19 07:46 AM] phm87#7395
I can align both but ig will need testing

[21-Aug-19 07:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The issue is making sure that it clears, when the node sends a tx that is not a notarization. I acheived it here:
`https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/pull/139/files#diff-b2bb174788c7409b671c46ccc86034bdR4079`

[21-Aug-19 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
simply adding the uxtos to the cache is a very easy mod... But it will break everyting if the wallet is cleaned or utxos merged.

[21-Aug-19 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Look at LABS rn...

[21-Aug-19 07:52 AM] CMaurice#1685
./checkmasks puts me nowhere

[21-Aug-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To be clear, the LABS netowkr should not be using any utxo cache `chosen = 70 out of 75 loop.(0)` 
and the CFEK netwoirk should be. `0 out of 1 loop.(0)`
@CMaurice  has a dpow round started yet, you must seletc utxo before anyting will happen.

[21-Aug-19 07:53 AM] CMaurice#1685
looks like ./checkmasks killed some daemons

its unstable and crashes the iguanas

[21-Aug-19 07:54 AM] CrisF#3405
@CMaurice, I used this and sometimes use a few variations of it ...

I will try to fix it at some later time

Yes that is the one to use

[21-Aug-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That one should at lest give an error, isntead of just crashing things if you call it too early

[21-Aug-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you just wait for a `chosen = 70 out of 75 loop.(0) ` 
Print to happen, it will not crash anything

[21-Aug-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant retreive data that does not exist... expeically if its a NULL pointer

maybe its possible for you to pull out of recv at the last second to give someone else a nota... not sure waht that acheives though.

You can use that to try and predict who will ntoarize... I think uinless 100% of nodes are up, it would not be perfectly accurate though.

[21-Aug-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That may be the only possible problem... If the nodes rotate perfectly, then evryone knows who will notarize what block.

[21-Aug-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If it is... we can just introduce more randomness.

[21-Aug-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181

@blackjok3r 
Is there anything specific you need us to test atm, or just let it run?

[21-Aug-19 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Make sure you are in recvmask. That is all

[21-Aug-19 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We need to let it run...

[21-Aug-19 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
UNtil we have all nodes in revcvmask, its not really telling us anyting useful

he currently is in his own recvmask already it seems ,his notaryid is 10, so if he is in his mask, the 3rd bit in the 3rd hex digit will be set, which is the case here
unless my math was wrong 游땐

[21-Aug-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems its changed. If it hasn't fixed itself by tomorrow any chance you can let me SSH to that node to check it? @CMaurice

[21-Aug-19 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Because this could be a problem, not that on the 50 node network I saw this happen, but need to be sure
