and then it just dies? ü§î

[20-Aug-19 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like is it getting killed from some other process?

[20-Aug-19 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or just SCREEN is gettin killed and leavint komodod running.. 
I didnt change any of the master branch stuff... but I did add screen, because not having a stdout... on a patform built for testing... is welll stupid to say the least

[20-Aug-19 03:55 PM] CMaurice#1685
don't think so, processes seem to be running fine if I ./start.sh

[20-Aug-19 03:55 PM] CMaurice#1685
SCREEN is gettin killed and leavint komodod running looks like

[20-Aug-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
man... Do you want me to make a branch without SCREEN ? until you work it out?

[20-Aug-19 03:55 PM] CMaurice#1685
all others screen -r fine

[20-Aug-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im lost as hell...

[20-Aug-19 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
screen -S KMD -m $HOME/StakedNotary/komodo/master/komodod

[20-Aug-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
from terminal home directory

[20-Aug-19 03:57 PM] CMaurice#1685
yep in a few, ./start'd again

[20-Aug-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
.. it seems to me that its still running \

[20-Aug-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
which means it cannot start it agin.

[20-Aug-19 03:58 PM] CMaurice#1685
nope, I check htop every time now

[20-Aug-19 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know.. if its just komodod for KMD... just start it normally and forget the screen

[20-Aug-19 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its only there so we can see the stdout...

[20-Aug-19 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am tying to work out a better way to do it...

[20-Aug-19 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but this should work...

[20-Aug-19 04:06 PM] CMaurice#1685
fine by me, but srtange the others working, and when I do it manually per starting.sh it just exits

[20-Aug-19 04:06 PM] CMaurice#1685
but I'll keep bashing at it

[20-Aug-19 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont understand tbh... if you work it out let me know...

[20-Aug-19 04:06 PM] CMaurice#1685
ayeaye

[20-Aug-19 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as the iguanas start in their screens... I think it shjould be fine

[20-Aug-19 04:16 PM] zatJUM#9924
I have quit (by mistake) screen and LABS stopped at the same time (same for CFEKMYLO).
When you quit screen it stops what is running inside.
It's normal behaviour, but people perhaps are not used to that.
Perhaps you could start daemons in background, as output is still displayed normally in stdin? This way, even if an operator closes screen, daemon would still be running, even with no stdin output?

[20-Aug-19 04:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If someone knows how to do it better please tell me or make PR... 
I know closeing the screen ends the process...

[20-Aug-19 04:27 PM] zatJUM#9924
Untill now I was used to ```./start.sh > ~/iguana.log 2>&1 &```So you can start a screen with ```tail -f ~/iguana.log``` and nothing is lost! (don't know for the colours, though)

[20-Aug-19 05:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, I know about that... maybe it is the way to go. thanks üôÇ

[20-Aug-19 07:46 PM] SHossain#0007
seems notarizations are happening normally on the new chain

[20-Aug-19 07:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they are perfect so far... Like so perfect... Im a little worried... There isnt enough nodes though I dont think yet.

[20-Aug-19 07:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS has some -26 problems, quite sure due to broken utxo cache..

[20-Aug-19 09:22 PM] Mylo#8306
i'm in transit @blackjok3r  can't do much about these extra chains.

[20-Aug-19 09:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just need to know what you want? Im not clear..

[20-Aug-19 09:23 PM] Mylo#8306
3 chain cluster

[20-Aug-19 09:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We can launch X iguanas and Y chains on each

[20-Aug-19 09:23 PM] Mylo#8306
fungibility between chains, and able to scale it to 3x the tx/hr (or second) for demo of how it works

[20-Aug-19 09:25 PM] Mylo#8306
so need some timed blasting as well.  like 2 hours off, 1 hour on or something.   and reset the chains every month from fresh to save space.

[20-Aug-19 09:25 PM] Mylo#8306
how does that sound?

[20-Aug-19 09:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ok I think i got ya... We need to crank out the MoMoM blaster ? I did make one... Took bad I havent got to MoMoM nSPV yet... that would be perfect possibly.... 
Pull down a full utxo cache on a hundred nodes then spam

[20-Aug-19 09:31 PM] Mylo#8306
haha.   cool, for starters, we don't need blasting.  just basic setup.   that gives us a lot of runway to crank things up thru sept/oct/nov by then atomicdex will be in full swing, nSPV will be released, chips will be flowing better, and a cpl other integration examples

[20-Aug-19 09:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well with the latest changes to StakedNotary in the last few weeks, bootstraping an entier notary network is trivial... But I need to clean it up a bit

I found the bug with utxo cache. 
Its the reset for sentoaddress i added in haste weeks ago. üôÇ

[21-Aug-19 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Fixed and making proper RPC, almost finished.

[21-Aug-19 02:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think also I will add gettxout detection to iguana. Then force bad utxo. See if 9-110 nodes can stay inconsensus with it.

[21-Aug-19 02:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That graph is directly correlated with node uptime from what I can see... But there is not enough nodes yet.

[21-Aug-19 02:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@daemonfox  
I think maybe this new iguana is what you were looking for üòõ Sorry it took so long üòÖ

[21-Aug-19 03:02 AM] daemonfox#6136
ive been lurking

[21-Aug-19 03:02 AM] daemonfox#6136
so we good to ull this one and rebuild now... should prob git -reset?

[21-Aug-19 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS itself is still running the old iguian, but hte delay is removed. 
There is another iguana `blackjok3r` branch. I made it so that we cna run as many iguanas as we like on LABS NN

[21-Aug-19 03:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Node names added

[21-Aug-19 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thanks üíØ

[21-Aug-19 03:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
107 - 96 ... But really this is just not enough ndoes... Its basically at min sigs every round... so all the nodes MUST notarize anyway. Need to wait for the rest of the nodes that are now up to catch up.

[21-Aug-19 03:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But maybe I need more node again üòÖ

[21-Aug-19 03:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My node is second üòÑ 
Quite an improvement from last

Cris and your node were not inrecvmask for whatever reason most of the night

[21-Aug-19 04:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe you missed an update?

[21-Aug-19 04:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im about to update it again.. so wait a few mins

utxo cache for komodods is working good. Not too sure if it breaks compatibility with other daemons though.

[21-Aug-19 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For LABS its fine...

Your nodes recvmask is not matching the rest of the nodes. Not sure why, maybe you need to update now I have fixed that. :abusedsmily:  
CrisF Your node seems to be down all together. 
@LabsAssistant 
Please do `./start.sh` 
This should rebuild all branches komodod and both iguanas and restart.

[21-Aug-19 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  
You need to set,:
```
set -gu prefix2
unbind C-a
unbind C-b
set -g prefix C-b
bind C-b send-prefix
:source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```
in tmux.conf.local
This disables ctrk+a for tmux so that you can do ctrl+a to activate the screens and pressing esc allows you to pgup/pgdown to scroll the screen inside the tmux pane.

Hi, sorry, bit crazy here atm.  Must have missed one.  Just back and updated before the tag.  will restart when it's done.

[21-Aug-19 07:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its fine. Its not really working so good while Im breaking it... üôÇ

[21-Aug-19 07:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I fixzed it all now though

[21-Aug-19 07:15 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, I should be good in a few minutes.

[21-Aug-19 07:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181

CMaurice, Bar_F1sh and smk762 seem also on that version.

Be a bit better tomorrow if all goes well.  Maybe crazy on Friday though.

Only just had a skim to try and catch up.  A lot of reading to do!

[21-Aug-19 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It should work with start... but it may need a stop not too sure

[21-Aug-19 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ive been updating a lot last few hours getting utxocache working

Yes, things are a bit diffrent... and there are no docs or readme yet...

[21-Aug-19 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We will see how this goes for 24H or something... . After that might add some more chains to both clusters if its working well.

[21-Aug-19 07:40 AM] CMaurice#1685
ok, re ./start.sh'd

[21-Aug-19 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
start may be enough. I will let you know if your node fixes itself

[21-Aug-19 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
recvmask is super importatnt with this iguana... If you dont enter it to all nodes... You are not going to do anything. All that means though is that you submit utxos

[21-Aug-19 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So with an instant cache, all nodes should be entering within a few seconds

[21-Aug-19 07:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
worth repeating 
```cd ~/StakedNotary
./stop.sh
git checkout many_iguana

Good news: I had btc notas during the night so my iguana patch15 works find with bitcoin patch5 on mainet NN. Ping @zatJUM who tested dpowlistunspent on kmd while I did on btc. I can adapt my patch15 for kmd

I will update my kmdlabs nn when I will have more disk space
