`/usr/local/bin/komodo-cli: Argument list too long
Export TX not sucessfully created`

[31-Dec-18 10:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so too many utxos?

[31-Dec-18 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats a know issue I think too, as the process proceds, ad adds the rest of the data the tx ends up too large.

[31-Dec-18 10:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
how decode?

[31-Dec-18 10:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Argument list too long` = fancy way of saying `bash sux`

[31-Dec-18 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to consolidate the inputs, it cant lose you any coins... so isnt a bug

[31-Dec-18 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but yes ... if you do the script in py you can handle longer transacxions

[31-Dec-18 10:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just want to write in an error check etc. reset wallet fix this?

[31-Dec-18 10:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
ah, okie. bash can fk off then

[31-Dec-18 10:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That will help the max tx size is now 200KB ... thats pretty freeking big ... bash has no hope of making you a raw transacion that big.

[31-Dec-18 10:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator are you getting `Argument list too long` on the create or the send?

[31-Dec-18 10:31 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
been meaning to move all to py, this gives me reason... though it'd take me longer to get scripts ready for migration spamming... but we're more interested in oracle spamming yeah?

[31-Dec-18 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It can be gotten around by appending the hex to a file and then adding it that way like in this script:

and 3 other projects vying for attention :abusedsmily:

[31-Dec-18 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oracle and MoMoM

[31-Dec-18 10:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`$(echo -e "$Signed" | ./komodo-cli -ac_name=$AssetChain -stdin sendrawtransaction)` will add length on send, but not on sign ☹

[31-Dec-18 10:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
error is on `sendrawtrasaction`

[31-Dec-18 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think we are in a huge rush, if you could port the migrate to py that would be good, but dont waste heaps of time on it at this stage.

[31-Dec-18 10:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`smk762Today at 4:32 AM
error is on sendrawtrasaction`
try using a stdin like I posted, see if that helps

[31-Dec-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
"@$curdir/createrawtx.curl"
If you pipe the raw hex generated to a file you can use curl to post it to the daemon with that param.

[31-Dec-18 10:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or that

[31-Dec-18 10:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the issue is bash itself

[31-Dec-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

I had to start using stdin on my consolidate because of the added length of sapling txes

[31-Dec-18 10:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm kind of smug being able to make sense of it

[31-Dec-18 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol yeah, it doesnt make a lot of sense, not feeling the best today, invited to 3 parties tonight 😂 Might just stay home haha.
pushed possible fix for daemon lock up... it cant hurt anything so we may as well try it... I thaught locking cs_main here was slowing it down, but I htink now the mempool fix is as fast as it is, it wont matter.

[31-Dec-18 10:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
will stop and check in a bit

[31-Dec-18 10:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[31-Dec-18 10:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah its worth a try... I did a lot of tx spamming in local test chains when doing that mempool fix, and I recall it would lock up wihtout a cs_main there ...

[31-Dec-18 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no idea why... maybe its locking the mempool somwhere else, and locking it that way 🤷

[31-Dec-18 10:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
other than the "timeout" there's nothing I'm seeing in logs or stdout that points to anything

[31-Dec-18 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i think the diffrence between, CFEK and ED and the others is there is more txs on CFEK/ED

[31-Dec-18 10:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
btw, thanks to all who lent wisdom over the last year. 3am Jan 1st 2018 I was livid, and used that to motivate learning all this stuff. looking back, been a bloody productive year and I'm only scratching the surface.

I'm glad this project got started
I haven't learned as much as joker has, but I've learned quite a bit in the last 7 months

[31-Dec-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had unlimited to to sink...

[31-Dec-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its doubtful many ppl in anything learnt this much in a year 😂

[31-Dec-18 10:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I could have learned more (not sure *how much more*), but I took more personal time this year than I think I have in all the last 15 combined

[31-Dec-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah thats always good too. Theres not exactly a lot to do around here, and this was somehting I was intrrested in... havent done much else all year lol.

Happy New Year, @LabsAssistant !
Please come and give a hand with the Logging and Statistics project.  Your input would be really appreciated.
https://kmdlabs.cc/p/logging_stats_project
Goal A:  Logging for upcoming Migration Stress Test
Goal B:  Statisics for KMDLabs
Good chance to work with oracles.cc

[02-Jan-19 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have an idea with this. There is a job long outstanding on trello. To show flow of coins across chains. While being a centralised service, a node running each daemon could pretty easily track all burns and imports to track where the coins are going, and post this data to an oracle. This can then be leveraged by a modified explorer to link cross chain txns in a visual way. Not really sure how best to do it. We should have enough people in here to figure it out though. Should be a good aim for this project to keep this goal in mind when designing the system.

[02-Jan-19 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will be avalible later today after getting some other work finished off. Hopefully a few guys are around and we can try to come up with an outline of what it needs to do.

[02-Jan-19 03:50 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, one of the things for the stats part should be that ☝

[02-Jan-19 03:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Have a few other ideas on the pad too.  
Everyone, please add ideas 😃

[02-Jan-19 03:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its possible to extract the OP_RETURN data on an import tx and decode it to get the burns txid ... So you can link to the burn on explorer quite easily I think. Not familiar with the explorers code base though, so not sure how to implement that, and also the burn cant link to the import using this method, so an external source of data is needed ot go in this direction.

[02-Jan-19 04:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
might be worth using similar templates for MoMoM visualisation to animate not only burns, but also notarisations.

[02-Jan-19 04:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'd be interested in looking into it, but time is limited and projects are many

[02-Jan-19 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... I think we need to get others on some of this, with your guidance and experaince from dragonhound I think other people will be able to get some thins done. This will be a good test run for delagating jobs etc... getting the team working together.

[02-Jan-19 04:36 AM] Mylo#8306
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator i'll start a sailsjs project to help get it up and running.   sailsjs is like feathersjs.   will use samples posted in kmdlabs.cc link provided above.   anyone will be able to pick it up and run with it.

if required for scaling, can build serverless functions from the kmdlabs work much easier ✅

[02-Jan-19 04:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cheers, as before the main challenges will be aggregating at scale without adding too much delay to account for slow arrivals

[02-Jan-19 04:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it's a good chance to review my earlier work too. Been 6 months and it's a monolithic bunch of code with many moving parts :abusedsmily:

[02-Jan-19 04:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I have oracles covered, and stats vis will just need to be modded to conform to new data structures.

[02-Jan-19 04:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doing this with too many chains will be hard. I will ask marketing (unless mylo can do this) if we can use the AWS account, the data agregation stuff was very easy using their endpoints to receive the data. Depends on what is decided and how to go about it ... using that migt not really be an option with oracle...

[02-Jan-19 04:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
something new will be needed for cross chain burns

[02-Jan-19 04:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The notarised chains for scaletest are only 64 in number aswell...

[02-Jan-19 04:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so its not like we need to do this for all 8192 chains 😄

{Reactions}
😅 

[02-Jan-19 04:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'd go with 8s, so we can use the vertices of the KMD icon.

[02-Jan-19 04:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
8 clusters of 8 = 64

[02-Jan-19 04:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
vertices can animate on edges for cross chain flow

[02-Jan-19 04:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and inwards to donut hole for notratisation

@CMaurice @gt  Work on Logging & Stats has begun ☝ Please join in 😉

[02-Jan-19 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wonder how many can be in a cluster ? Its mostly limited I think by the resources of the notary nodes... we would need pretty huge VPS to do more than 64 chains.

[02-Jan-19 04:43 AM] Mylo#8306
"using the extrude tool...."  re: vertices & donut.    reminds me or blender tutorial vids

[02-Jan-19 04:44 AM] Mylo#8306
noted @blackjok3r re: scaling stuff.    we can make it scale no probs after some impl done 😃

[02-Jan-19 04:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Cool.. It seems like a good idea to tie this in with previous work on that stuff... also doing that gets us some resources to use (if marketking allows it)

[02-Jan-19 04:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
might be a bit heavy to oraclize all tx, but it'd hold the aggregated data ok

Most of these guys are self funding their VPS's and at larger scales this wont be feasable.

I'm about ready to do somthing like what you got @blackjok3r  just get one beast of a server and virt as req

[02-Jan-19 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah, for blockchain stuff, you just need heaps of ram... This one I am using isnt bad ... if doing ti again though I would get next gen chips for AVX/AES instructions at least.

[02-Jan-19 04:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
well... if you're selling the old one... :p

[02-Jan-19 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My DC hosting fees are pretty high with these old mosnter CPUs power cost is like $130 a month ... really blew out the budget ... power cost alone in a year almost warrented getting newer gen stuff.

[02-Jan-19 04:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I might run for notary this year, though I'll probably need some guidance to cover the next level. My VPS bill at the moment is about $140/mth

[02-Jan-19 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you have a KMD notary though, you can afford pretty large fees .. I htink mine is $450 a month.

[02-Jan-19 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Can be done for far less no doubt... my DC is expensive ... just went with the first place that replied to me, and they were super helpful and the internet connection there is just about as good as you can get in Perth.

[02-Jan-19 04:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
that includes dragonhound / mail server / flir2qr / txscl / pool

I could combine some stuff, but kept it segregated so dev of one thing doesnt hurt dev of other things
