I will fix it tomorrow, it's just checking that all the addresses paid in ac_notarypay are in getnotarysendmnay

[31-Oct-19 03:14 PM] Alright#0419

if we didn't just hard fork, seeing that error means something very very bad

jokes aside, if I see it outside of now I will let you know

[31-Oct-19 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r 
is the `freq` in assetchains.json how often it's supposed to look to notarized (every freq blocks)?

[31-Oct-19 03:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, but its not exactly that

[31-Oct-19 03:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there are other factors

[31-Oct-19 04:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
k, mylo chain took 40+; just wanted to check and make sure no unanticipated problems happening

[31-Oct-19 04:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
those chains are not working for my notary no... something seems a little odd. Being CFEK though  i have too much else on my mind to look into it atm

[31-Oct-19 04:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as long as you're aware what I see, my job is done
when you do something about it is on you 😝

[31-Oct-19 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
have a theory on what it is.

[31-Oct-19 05:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
seems the issue with stats.py is that getnotarysendmany is designed to only return for the current era only, so the old keys/addys are not in that list and therefore error

[31-Oct-19 05:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_had a chance to look at it a little bit while waiting for 🛀🏽 to fill_

[31-Oct-19 05:38 PM] zatJUM#9924
Yes CG. I've customized a copy of stats.py to display only for current era like this:```block_range = height - 218757```

[31-Oct-19 05:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
seems the CFEK chains dont want to nota for me anymore... almost 4 days and none but blocks in sync

[31-Oct-19 06:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@zatJUM that only sorta works, because you cannot go any farther back 😛

[31-Oct-19 06:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Mine doesn't go farther back either, but I worked around it by making it do:

[31-Oct-19 06:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```genie@StakedNotary:~/StakedNotary$ ./stats.py

synced from scratch on  updated master for staking node... and first is:
`pindexOldTip->GetHeight().218763 > notarizedht 218790 && pindexFork->GetHeight().218797 is < notarizedht 218790, so ignore it`

checked date of binaries, can't think of anything else

[31-Oct-19 06:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CMaurice that just lets you know that a shorter fork is known, but since it is shorter your node is ignoring the possibility of it mattering

[31-Oct-19 06:26 PM] CMaurice#1685
oh, ok

[31-Oct-19 06:28 PM] CMaurice#1685
less than sign appears incorrect, generating too many so must be on a fork. going out ofr a bit actuallt

[31-Oct-19 06:28 PM] CMaurice#1685
y

[31-Oct-19 06:30 PM] CMaurice#1685
well, less than sign becomes incorrect later: `pindexOldTip->GetHeight().218763 > notarizedht 218790 && pindexFork->GetHeight().218801 is < notarizedht 218790, so ignore it
`

[31-Oct-19 06:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the key thing to look at is your `getinfo` reply

[31-Oct-19 06:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that will let you see where you are in comparison to others and/or the explorer

[31-Oct-19 06:34 PM] CMaurice#1685

Was trying to understand better staking, and read several times I had to think about pos64 game, but```https://lite.qwant.com/?q=%22pos64+game%22&client=opensearch```doesn't return many results (google not many more relevant). Does someone know an URL with informations on this game?

[01-Nov-19 05:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
CFEKMYLO6 has been added to the pool, but be aware that payments are, and will remain, sparse because of the 0.00007777 block reward (only 77% of a full tx fee)

well, it's not a "game" in the traditional sense, but rather an application of game theory

[01-Nov-19 05:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the "rules" for the "game" are the consensus code (the bits that determine what can be staked and when)
the "players" are the miners/stakers
etc.

I've found the rpc call `geterablockheights`, but it returns an empty json.

[01-Nov-19 10:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@zatJUM there's other ways to do it, but the getnotarysendmany has to either be removed from stats.py or changed internally (it doesn't accept any era param because generally there's no real need to send funds to all past notaries as a group)
