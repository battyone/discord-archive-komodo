Blaster now works with previous TXID as first 64 chars of OP_RETURN and next 8 chars as sequence number. Just need to add a queue to get data in, still uses random at the moment.

[17-Oct-18 05:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thinking sequence number could be usless, thauhgt about it but decided to leave it there for now.

[17-Oct-18 05:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
RPC to add data to queue... with first TXID is all 0, rest point to the last txid, so the txids will order the data anyway it seems, as long as the queue never gets mixed up.

[17-Oct-18 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
good decision to keep the seqid, it allows for error check

[18-Oct-18 05:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  any pointers on a queue? I was thinking it can just be a pointer to a char of X size and when its over X size returns an error, the seqid will be set after this function as each chunck is pulled by the TxBlaster. 
Whats the best way to do that? Do I need to grab the start of the hexstring then copy the rest of the hexstring into a temp char array, then copy it back? Or can you remove things from the start of the arrray and have it do that automatically some how?

[18-Oct-18 05:52 AM] Mylo#8306
over a serial port i used to use array of bytes/chars (large enough to not fill) and read to another larger buffer on interupt 1 char at a time, and reset the receiving buffer.

@blackjok3r not sure how it's done with your stuff

[18-Oct-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not done at this stage .. I am just filling with randomly generate data üòÇ

[18-Oct-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There has to be a standard way to do this, wihtout reinventing the wheel

[18-Oct-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Reading now ... will take quite some thaught before I even try to start writing this.

[18-Oct-18 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will even be keeping the randomly generated data... that will feed  inothe queue keeping it full at all times, then expand on that. Doing more than 1 thing at a time will only frustrate me.

[18-Oct-18 06:00 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah he did mention "queue", which i take to mean FIFO buffer.  i'm pretty certain he'd have implemented this elsewhere üòÉ

[18-Oct-18 06:02 AM] Mylo#8306

uthash.h

[18-Oct-18 07:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it has hashing and even simple queue stuff

[18-Oct-18 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i use DL_APPEND to add to a queue and then you can iterate through the queue

[18-Oct-18 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
read all the uthash docs, it will make you a much more efficient coder

utlist is the queue, start with that

[18-Oct-18 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
you can grep my code for the actual usages

[18-Oct-18 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
i cant remember how many places i used it

[18-Oct-18 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
basically when a new item comes in, malloc a structure, set the fields, DL_APPEND

[18-Oct-18 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
now its in the list

[18-Oct-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
where you need to query the list, just do that and if it returns something at the head of the list, you get a FIFO

[18-Oct-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
if you get something from the tail of the list it is LIFO

[18-Oct-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
really you MUST understand fully about how to use lists and hashtables. with utlist/uthash you dont have to learn to write the internals (though that in itself is very good learning when time is available)

[18-Oct-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810

I just got the RPC's working ... that turned  out much harder than it should have been. Marketmaker locks everything and only accepts 1 RPC call at once, so I had to make it run 2 RPC threads and also force activate "fastflag" for the streamerqadd RPC.
