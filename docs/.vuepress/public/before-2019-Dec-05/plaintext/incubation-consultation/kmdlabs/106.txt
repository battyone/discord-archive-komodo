[23-Nov-18 02:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
wiping everything and retrying here

[23-Nov-18 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I made it do the config.ini and auto import, so we could just blow away the data dir withoutneeding to worry about wallet.dat ...

[23-Nov-18 02:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
yup

[23-Nov-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but its still better to manually clear blocks and stuff, incase you want iguana to stay runnign

[23-Nov-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you wipe conf then it needs restart

[23-Nov-18 02:57 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
notarisations picking up now - but nothing for 'ING' or 'LF' yet

[23-Nov-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the rule directly from komodod is `numnotaries/5` interget divite truncated.

[23-Nov-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but in iguana,, it always rounds up

[23-Nov-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so its 1 higher

[23-Nov-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LF isnt really working for me either

[23-Nov-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Nov-18 03:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r dumb question:
does start.sh start everything in a separate space or will it all die when I Ctrl+C and/or close this terminal?

[23-Nov-18 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I generalyl tell people to start it in a tmux or screen...

[23-Nov-18 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but it should stay working

[23-Nov-18 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_hasn't been assed to learn either of those yet_

[23-Nov-18 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
right now... its just piple all std out of all coin daemons to /dev/null and gives you iguana TV

[23-Nov-18 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I want to change that so each process is in a tmux or a screen

[23-Nov-18 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Nov-18 03:14 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 `screen -S <name_of_screen>` will open a screen

[23-Nov-18 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
then `crtl + a` will let you control it

[23-Nov-18 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
ctrl + a then d will detach
