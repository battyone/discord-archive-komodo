[12-Oct-18 01:21 PM] Alright#0419
what did you set the fee to when you registered?

[12-Oct-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I wat do you mean ... i put pubkey into the <PUBKEY> and ran the command

[12-Oct-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
10 times

[12-Oct-18 01:22 PM] Alright#0419
when you did `oraclesregister`

[12-Oct-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dint do that

[12-Oct-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just funded it

[12-Oct-18 01:22 PM] Alright#0419
Ah there's your problem

[12-Oct-18 01:22 PM] Alright#0419
ok so do

[12-Oct-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and tred to send

[12-Oct-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
whats that command ?

[12-Oct-18 01:22 PM] Alright#0419
`komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDB1 oraclesregister 742d2317a734fce4f6f99862dd878ed58538434dc855cd76879ad68be3f1bff4 1000000`

[12-Oct-18 01:23 PM] Alright#0419
the last arg is data fee

[12-Oct-18 01:23 PM] Alright#0419
which you'll pay to yourself, so it doesn't matter

[12-Oct-18 01:23 PM] Alright#0419
has to be >10k sats

[12-Oct-18 01:23 PM] Alright#0419
other than that, doesn't really matter

[12-Oct-18 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but you cant get it back ? like dice ?

[12-Oct-18 01:23 PM] Alright#0419
no

[12-Oct-18 01:23 PM] Alright#0419
so

[12-Oct-18 01:23 PM] Alright#0419
an oracle can get paid for posting data

[12-Oct-18 01:23 PM] Alright#0419
instead, you'll pay yourself each time you post data

[12-Oct-18 01:24 PM] Alright#0419
if you wanted to drain it, just spam messages

[12-Oct-18 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
back to the utxo that you started with right ? so you fund it and then it works, but you cant unfund it ?

[12-Oct-18 01:25 PM] Alright#0419
if you wanted to "unfund it" you can spam messages

[12-Oct-18 01:25 PM] Alright#0419
and it'll pay you the data fee each time

[12-Oct-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
any progress testing channels?

[12-Oct-18 01:25 PM] Alright#0419
haven't played with them myself

[12-Oct-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok got basic scripts done for all steps üòÑ

[12-Oct-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
without notarisations ... we leave testing that to @TonyL

[12-Oct-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when notirisations are needed we tets channels :trollface:

[12-Oct-18 01:29 PM] Alright#0419
the way the receive script matches publisher with batontxid is sloppy

[12-Oct-18 01:29 PM] Alright#0419
that's probably what went wrong above

did you open it in the same window you started the chain in?

[12-Oct-18 01:32 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes

[12-Oct-18 01:33 PM] CrisF#3405
It's going mad. Very occasionally something else flashed by.

@blackjok3r If multiply people test with fresh view it would be better I think

[12-Oct-18 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
always but there are only so many hours in a day .. as it is im on here 15H +

[12-Oct-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know testing the new things are important ... but if we dont make somthing people can USE with the previous ones .. .what is the point ?

[12-Oct-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
oracls is soooo cool ...

[12-Oct-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once MoMoM is fixed we can start sending our recources to testing CC's

[12-Oct-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
until then we can keep making improvemtns to our platform and genrally doing cool things

[12-Oct-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, oracles is very cool

[12-Oct-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
but channels is better than LN, I thought LN was the magic stuff

[12-Oct-18 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
channels without notarisations is transactions

[12-Oct-18 01:41 PM] Alright#0419
you can write dapps for oracles with shitty bash scripts soooo easily

[12-Oct-18 01:41 PM] Alright#0419
started testing it, and I couldn't stop thinking of ideas on how to use it

[12-Oct-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and didnt sleep for more than a day :trollface:

[12-Oct-18 01:42 PM] CrisF#3405
haha

[12-Oct-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when alright puts his mind to something ... .things happen
