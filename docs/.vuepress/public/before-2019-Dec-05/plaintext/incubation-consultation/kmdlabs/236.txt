Had PoS 100% working just about prefectly

[22-Jan-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess with N*N coinage it will find blocks pretty fast, the problem will be with a lot of stakers, many potential forks will be

[22-Jan-19 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes trying to make it so that that exemption isnt even required at all, has been the goal...

[22-Jan-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i think with an easier mindiff (without overflow/underflow error) will allow small number of coins to stake, and if too many, a few hundred fast blocks and the diff adjustment should take care of it

[22-Jan-19 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I see where I went wrong now. Thanks for the help.

[22-Jan-19 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The only place I needed to use VerusHash MINDIFF was in POW_target

[22-Jan-19 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not the staker

[22-Jan-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is what I was trying to say

[22-Jan-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats ok, thanmks again... its been a long day 游땐

[22-Jan-19 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ok... got some data here to work from maybe you can help me understand why it is working backwards.

[22-Jan-19 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
RATIO: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000

[22-Jan-19 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mindiff.SetCompact(KOMODO_MINDIFF_NBITS,&fNegative,&fOverflow);

[22-Jan-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No UTXO are elegible using this

[22-Jan-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mindiff.SetCompact(STAKING_MIN_DIFF,&fNegative,&fOverflow); <--- Staking MINDIF is the VerusHash mindiff bBits. (fetched fby printing int output of GetNextWorkRequired.

[22-Jan-19 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
RATIO: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001

[22-Jan-19 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
UTXO are elegible with this.

[22-Jan-19 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c

[22-Jan-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
ratio is basically 0? seems the denominator is bigger than numerator

[22-Jan-19 10:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or it is equal

[22-Jan-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
probably some sanity check is needed and setting to reasonable values in case the calcs are over/under flowing

[22-Jan-19 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So I need to like +1 to the mindiff or something to make it divide?

[22-Jan-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont undserstand whats going on tbh, fgrom what you explained the MINDIFF should be lower to make an easier ratio, but tios working the exact opposite to that.

[22-Jan-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
diff works backwards

[22-Jan-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
higher number is easier

[22-Jan-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
the mining diff compare is if ( hash < diff )

[22-Jan-19 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, the VerusMin diff = 487526159
equihash = 537857807

[22-Jan-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
you know, more leading 0s is harder

[22-Jan-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems no need to do ratios if it is already at the mindiff

[22-Jan-19 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so if bnTarget = Verus MINDIFF then Ratio is calculated from Verus MINDIFF, then if it is lower than MINDIFF ratio uses komodo MINDIFF?

[22-Jan-19 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt really make a lot of sense... But I know that once the DIFF goes over MINDIFF for Block Target, that it basically stops staking.

[22-Jan-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the staking diff?

[22-Jan-19 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... 
I have to use VerusMin diff for mindiff in the staker or it wont stake any blocks. The block target for the first 50 blocks is MINDIFF... it does not rise at all..

[22-Jan-19 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when using mindiff / target it can stake,

[22-Jan-19 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when using Komodo MINDIFF / target it cant

[22-Jan-19 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So I guess something like:
if bnTarget != verusMindiff
    mindiff =komodo mindiff

[22-Jan-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe just set staking diff to mindiff for first 100 blocks?

[22-Jan-19 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Usin komodo MIN DIFF and setting `diff` to 60 for blocks under 100 does not work either

[22-Jan-19 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the only thing that works is using VerusMindiff to calc the ratio

[22-Jan-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, whatever works is more important

[22-Jan-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the problem is it stops working

[22-Jan-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will try to switch them over or something 游뱡

[22-Jan-19 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That didnt work. Just worked out a lot more about how this works. I think I can fix it... But it will break all existing chains totally.. they may need an exception... OR we just dont merge the fixed, working staker into KMD.

[22-Jan-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
can you implement it using timestamp activation?

[22-Jan-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
or just a flag to choose PoS methods

[22-Jan-19 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
possibly... what is komodo_elegible... I commented out the entire function and everything works fine?

[22-Jan-19 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems to just do the same exact thign as `komodo_stake`

[22-Jan-19 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No wonder the staking loop is slow

[22-Jan-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the mining loop has a cached version that the validation doesnt have to have

[22-Jan-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure you can just comment it out...

[22-Jan-19 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did and it works fine

[22-Jan-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
that would seem to allow ineligible utxo into the loop

[22-Jan-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Both are inside the loop... It does elegible, then validat flag 0, then validate flag 1

[22-Jan-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it checks to make sure that a utxo is eligible give maxiters

[22-Jan-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but yes, it does seem a bit redundant

[22-Jan-19 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the maxiters is set in komodo_stake anyway... doesnt seem to be hurting it... The onyl way to check it, is to make a chain with many many nodes and see if it forks... Which is the main problem I see possibly happening here.

[22-Jan-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just used to continue to next utxo

[22-Jan-19 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
multiple utxo elegible at the same time

[22-Jan-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt affecting consensus as long as it doesnt make an eligible utxo inelegible or an ineligible one eligible

[22-Jan-19 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I think removing that elegible check is fine... I mean how I "fixed" the staking loop for smaller coin supplies

[22-Jan-19 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```        if ( ASSETCHAINS_ALGO == ASSETCHAINS_VERUSHASH || ASSETCHAINS_ALGO == ASSETCHAINS_VERUSHASHV2 )
        {
            if ( PoSperc < ASSETCHAINS_STAKED )
            {
                // Under PoS % target and we need to increase diff.
                //fprintf(stderr, "PoS too low diff.%i changed to.",diff);
                diff = diff * ( (ASSETCHAINS_STAKED - PoSperc + 1) * (ASSETCHAINS_STAKED - PoSperc + 1) );
                //fprintf(stderr, "%i \n",diff);
            }
            else if ( PoSperc > ASSETCHAINS_STAKED )
            {
                // Over PoS target need to lower diff.
                //fprintf(stderr, "PoS too high diff.%i changed to.",diff);
                diff = diff / ( (PoSperc - ASSETCHAINS_STAKED + 1) * (PoSperc - ASSETCHAINS_STAKED + 1) );
                //fprintf(stderr, "%i \n",diff);
            }
        }```

[22-Jan-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
that will definitely break all existing chains

[22-Jan-19 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its contained inside VerusHash... need to check it works with equihash aswell

[22-Jan-19 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe can use is_STAKED function to limit it to staked chains

[22-Jan-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
aha, missed that part. as long as that is the only change, it should be fine then

[22-Jan-19 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah, I want to check it on equihash... maybe it stops the random 382s blocks

[22-Jan-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you can get the PoS staking solid using verushash that would solve the backward compatibility issue

[22-Jan-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
blocktimes looking quite good now... But I'm not sure if this could cause either forks or reorgs... we will need to test it, with many nodes

[22-Jan-19 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 
I think I solved the difficulty problem.... Now staking difficulty can be adjusted, not just PoW. Seems to work. May need some help to test it out though some time soon. I'm not sure 2 nodes, with 1 staker is enough to tell if it causes more problems than it solves.

[22-Jan-19 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
sweet

[22-Jan-19 12:47 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
Since you've been working on it, I didn't mention the issue I've found where restarting a node lets PoS kick ass where previously "stalled" (which I think is related to the way diff looks back over time)

[22-Jan-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I have fixed that already by fixing another issue

[22-Jan-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem was that segid isnt set in block index properly

[22-Jan-19 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
yeah, that's why I didn't mention it, I figured I'd wait and see if it still applied after you do what you're doing

[22-Jan-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
When you restart the entire blockindex cache is wiped clean as its not saved to disk. But as soon as segid is called, it sets the flag in block index again. It means that its not their for the entire chain, after a restart, but it *should* now populate teh blockindex flag the firs time it checks that block.

[22-Jan-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the `getlastsegidstakes` RPC will set the entire index if you call it for the whole chain once... then the next tiem you call it its instant response.

[22-Jan-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So I beleive its working fine.

[22-Jan-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We should test these things though, to make sure before launch. I think we can contain these changes to VerusHash and LABS chains.

[22-Jan-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so it does not fork MGNX or DION. Even though both of those seem dead lol

[22-Jan-19 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
MGNX isn't dead, I mine and stake it :trollface:

游땍 

[22-Jan-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We might need @webworker01  To do the 300 Google Cloud nodes again, and see if he can fork it. Because maybe having PoW and PoS dificulty adjustments could mean 2 utxo on chain become elegible at once.

[22-Jan-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
with diff * diff, dozens of utxo could become eligible at once

[22-Jan-19 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
likley that calcualtion is wrong... It was a guess to see if it works... I tried diff *2 but that wasnt large enough to do anything at all

[22-Jan-19 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What I am using now for example, if PoS target is 60% and its at 59%
its using: `diff =  diff * ( 2 * 2 )`
Maybe it onl;y needs to be: `diff = diff * (2 + 2)`

[22-Jan-19 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`( 2 * 2 )` = `( 2 + 2 )` = `4`

[22-Jan-19 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes but if it was at 58% 
it would be:  `diff =  diff * ( 3 * 3  = 9)`
vs.  `diff =  diff * ( 3 + 3  = 6)`

[22-Jan-19 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont see it every really having more than 1% variance due to the massive diff wall on PoW ...

[22-Jan-19 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But this will solve Alrights worries of ppl removing too many utxo off chain, as it should be able to stake with just a single utxo if PoW gets to 100%

[22-Jan-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a LOT of PoW required to get it there though... so Maybe not..

[22-Jan-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to go. we can come back to this later. I'm not really qualified for this, pretty much guessing at it lol.

[22-Jan-19 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I'm still of the mind that that is really a moot point because any needed movement of an abandoned chain can be dealt with and the numbers don't matter because moving it to drain is only a short-term thing

He just keeps going on about it 游뱎

[22-Jan-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm really only concerned with having a stable chain, that makes consistent blocks at very little cost. As there is no incentive to mine the things.

[22-Jan-19 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
That I can has always been incentive enough for me 游땥

@Alright I'm not sure I get what you mean

[22-Jan-19 02:17 PM] Alright#0419
you're talking about being able to move all coins off of a fungible chain that is meant to die, yes?
