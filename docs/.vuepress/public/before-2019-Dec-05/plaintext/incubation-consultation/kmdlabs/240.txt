That doesn't seem too clever or coat effective in the long term

[24-Jan-19 01:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure it's cost effective in the *short* term either 😛

[24-Jan-19 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They have cable laying machines its not even expensive to bury it.. Or that's how they do it here

[24-Jan-19 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Dig a hole and then make a tunnel and pull it thru

[24-Jan-19 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, that's how they run newer phone lines here too

[24-Jan-19 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it trenches, drops the line, and mostly fills it back in all at once

[24-Jan-19 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The government spent millions of dollars training people on unemployment to terminate the fiber, then the party changed and they decided to terminate it all with copper and get contractors in mostly from overseas

[24-Jan-19 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽

[24-Jan-19 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that sounds like some dumb shit we'd do here

[24-Jan-19 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think they said it would cost 45 billion and ended up over 50 and only half assed finished

[24-Jan-19 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And the government owns the whole thing so it will fall into disrepair then they will sell it...

[24-Jan-19 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just like they did with the telephone system it replaces

[24-Jan-19 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a govt fail to complete a project? surely not! :trollface:

[24-Jan-19 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They completed it... It achieved 60% of its goal and was only slightly over budget they did OK IMO 😂

I used to think that voters in the US couldn't pass grade 3 math when it came to the shit they vote in favor of, then I got internet and found out that we live in an entire world of stupid people 😛

Rudd: Here's proof Murdoch ruined me to sink NBN
Kevin Rudd believes he has "key evidence" media mogul Ruper Murdoch was determined to kill off Labor's National Broadband Network (NBN).

I got a text today from NBN asking me for feedback.

[24-Jan-19 02:54 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
responded with "Murdoch should be burnt at the stake, and anything less than FTTP is a waste of taxpayer $$"

@CrisF @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator slow start of a week sound good?

[25-Jan-19 03:04 AM] Alright#0419
going to start testing it, need a rough estimate of how many blocks it would take to get to full block reward

I fine with whatever you feel is best.

[25-Jan-19 03:13 AM] CrisF#3405
If I'm understanding correctly, a slow start would be to minimize possible complaints from people who didn't find out about LABS fast enough.

[25-Jan-19 03:15 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright I also have some time.  Please let me know if there's anything I can do.

[25-Jan-19 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
What are you looking to do?

[25-Jan-19 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
don't want to just dump things on you that I don't feel like doing 😂

[25-Jan-19 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
but....

[25-Jan-19 03:22 AM] Alright#0419
if you could try to organize all the thoughts in that issue or posted anywhere else, I think that'd be helpful

[25-Jan-19 03:22 AM] Alright#0419
like if you can make a clear set of objective rules based on that

[25-Jan-19 03:22 AM] Alright#0419
see what rules are undecided still

[25-Jan-19 03:23 AM] CrisF#3405
On the slow start issue?

[25-Jan-19 03:23 AM] Alright#0419
on everything 😅

[25-Jan-19 03:24 AM] Alright#0419
I know that's a very general task, but we need to mash all the proposals into one and see where they differ

[25-Jan-19 03:24 AM] Alright#0419
then where they do differ, decide how we will do it

[25-Jan-19 03:25 AM] Alright#0419
couple things we need to determine

[25-Jan-19 03:25 AM] Alright#0419
bounty limit

[25-Jan-19 03:25 AM] Alright#0419
who is signers of multisig address

[25-Jan-19 03:25 AM] Alright#0419
if we have separate multisig for notary payouts and bounties or the same

[25-Jan-19 03:26 AM] Alright#0419
limit is 15 signers

[25-Jan-19 03:26 AM] Alright#0419
also the m of n of the multisig or multisigs

[25-Jan-19 03:26 AM] Alright#0419
as in how many out of the 15 people are required to sign a tx

[25-Jan-19 03:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, ok, I'll give it a shot.

[25-Jan-19 03:28 AM] Alright#0419
who did the spreadsheet of block reward distribution?

[25-Jan-19 03:28 AM] CrisF#3405
Blackjok3r

[25-Jan-19 03:29 AM] Alright#0419
think someone did it and gave it to him

[25-Jan-19 03:29 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, not sure then.

[25-Jan-19 03:29 AM] Alright#0419
that would probably be the best way to visualize what different bounty limits look like

[25-Jan-19 03:31 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, so I'll collect info on `how KMDLabs works` and put it together for everyone to check and decide upon.

Regnar made spreadsheet I'll look at it today and make any needed changes to make it do what it actually needa

[25-Jan-19 04:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems useful for coin distribution

[25-Jan-19 04:09 AM] Alright#0419
adding option to change bounty limit % would be useful

[25-Jan-19 04:09 AM] Alright#0419
so we can change it and see the effect over time

[25-Jan-19 04:10 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r what's the deal with requiring X amount of LABS to keep a 0BR chain moving?

[25-Jan-19 04:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We should defiantly have that.

[25-Jan-19 04:11 AM] Alright#0419
what if chain creator pays for block reward for duration of the chain

[25-Jan-19 04:11 AM] Alright#0419
could get a small amount of hashrate on each if we did that

[25-Jan-19 04:11 AM] Alright#0419
even if it's 0.001 per block or something

[25-Jan-19 04:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Look having a chain need pos to move makes it easy to know when a chan is dead without subjective rules and relying on notaries

[25-Jan-19 04:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181

komodod -ac_name=LABS -ac_supply=350690 -ac_reward=0,0,770000000 -ac_decay=0,0,100000000 -ac_halving=1 -ac_staked=51 -ac_eras=3 -ac_end=128,10208,0 -ac_cc=101
no block reward until block 129
then linear growth from 129-10208
10209 - forever is 7.7(or whatever it should be)
10208 is 128+(1440*7) ~7 days
```

`ac_ccenable=226,236` is we want to limit CC on main chain to import/export and oracles

[25-Jan-19 04:42 AM] Alright#0419
rough draft of what main chain params will be

[25-Jan-19 04:44 AM] Alright#0419
anyone have a clever name for the notary payout chain?

[25-Jan-19 04:44 AM] Alright#0419
start with LAB or LABS

[25-Jan-19 04:53 AM] Alright#0419
should we limit main chain eval codes to import/export only?

[25-Jan-19 04:53 AM] Alright#0419
and maybe oracles?

[25-Jan-19 04:54 AM] Alright#0419
might save us the hassle of hardforking it in the future

[25-Jan-19 04:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Keep it simple and "not clever", maybe? like LABSNC?

[25-Jan-19 04:56 AM] Alright#0419
maybe not LAB/LABS at all, and add an exception for the name

[25-Jan-19 04:56 AM] Alright#0419
that way it's much much harder to change in the future

[25-Jan-19 04:57 AM] Alright#0419
ie all notaries colluding to increases their share

[25-Jan-19 04:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
NC4LABS?

[25-Jan-19 05:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, don't what the name "too far out there"; if we need to talk about it, it has to be something that isn't "confusing"
