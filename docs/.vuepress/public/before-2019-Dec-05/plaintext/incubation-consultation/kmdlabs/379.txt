you won't be able to register/join with the same pubkey

[12-May-19 11:33 PM] Alright#0419
so start daemon with new -pubkey, register, join

can test verify by just putting in random shit for the blockhash

[13-May-19 12:37 AM] Alright#0419

[13-May-19 12:38 AM] Alright#0419
the signed message it just a way to verify that the person submitting it is the same person on discord/github

[13-May-19 12:38 AM] Alright#0419
you don't have to pr anything, it's for people actually entering the lottery

[13-May-19 12:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool.  So that's I just need to enter a blockhash now?

[13-May-19 12:39 AM] Alright#0419
yea so once we have that blockhash, we can use that verify option to get the results

[13-May-19 12:44 AM] CrisF#3405
It worked smoothly for me.  Now need to wait intill 1558320334!

[13-May-19 01:12 AM] Alright#0419
I'll switch over the oracle to the real oracle and touch up that instructions print later tonight

[13-May-19 01:12 AM] Alright#0419
then we can announce it's ready

[13-May-19 01:24 AM] CrisF#3405
Do we need to test the adding the blockhash part, and then seeing the results?

[13-May-19 01:50 AM] Alright#0419
whatever you input when it asks you for blockhash is the "entropy", it'll randomize the order of the participants based on it

[13-May-19 01:36 PM] CrisF#3405
🍀 Good luck to all the Stakers and KMDLabs supporters running for KMD NN operator.  It's going to be an exciting few hours to cap off a month in the testnet.  Hope it goes well for you! 🤞  :labs:

ok just changed the oracle over to the real lottery

@mrlynch @Exile13 @phm87 @Strob You can now join the lottery for the 2 spots if you're still interested. In the KMDLabs/StakedNotary repo, there is a script called `NNvote.py`. Run this(after starting the CFEKORC chain) and select `NN lottery`. There are instructions in the TUI itself, hope that's enough, but if you have any trouble let me know.

If you guys have any trouble with it, ask in here. I should be around for the next few days to help if Alright is not, hes going on a trip for a few days. I think CrisF helped test it so may be of more help unlesss it has bugs that need fixing.

Yeah, the instructions in the TUI are very easy to follow.  Please ask  if you have any question.

before May 20th 2am45, also keep in mind that CFEKORC has 1800s block time approx, so you should register as soon as possible

About the lottery and NNvote.py, I'm trying to sync CFEKORC but I'm getting 0 connections, I'll wait a little bit
```komodod -ac_name=CFEKORC -ac_supply=1000000 -ac_reward=1000000000000 -ac_cc=102 -ac_ccenable=226,236 -ac_blocktime=1800 -ac_algo=verushash11 -ac_sapling=1 -addnode=195.201.20.230 -addnode=195.201.137.5 -server -daemon &```

[14-May-19 10:22 PM] phm87#7395
I'm also having an issue when stop and start Kmd (there was an error (x) in getinto before I stopped it):
```: Error opening block database.

error in HDD data, might just need to update to latest, if that doesnt work, then you need to resync```
(x) ``"errors": "EXCEPTION: 15dbwrapper_error       \nDatabase I/O error       \nKom                              odo in ProcessMessages()       \n",``

What Komodo repo and branch do you recommend ?

[14-May-19 10:48 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I use KMDLabs komodo daemon, master branch

[14-May-19 10:49 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`getinfo` returns 0 connections ?

[14-May-19 11:03 PM] phm87#7395
yes

[14-May-19 11:07 PM] phm87#7395
do you think that the line I used to launch CFEKORC is correct ? especially synthax of ac_ccenable

[14-May-19 11:16 PM] PHBA2061#2530
seems correct to me , this is what I used : 
```
komodod -pubkey=03... -ac_name=CFEKORC -ac_supply=1000000 -ac_reward=1000000000000 -ac_cc=102 -ac_ccenable=226,236 -ac_blocktime=1800 -ac_algo=verushash11 -ac_sapling=1  &
```
and then I add those 2 nodes manually with `komodo-cli  -ac_name=CFEKORC addnode 195.201.20.230 onetry`

[14-May-19 11:18 PM] PHBA2061#2530
actually there is a script `start.sh` to launch any chain with their corresponding parameters, but I don't use that and launched CFEKORC the classic way

[14-May-19 11:50 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @phm87, KMDLabs komodo (master) works fine.

[14-May-19 11:51 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @PHBA2061 , why did you choose to add the nodes separately? (just curious)

[14-May-19 11:59 PM] PHBA2061#2530
just because I want to test if it could automatically discover other peers or not 😆

{Reactions}
👍 

[15-May-19 05:42 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I think you need addnode add, just to make sure an initial connection is made. Normal discovery should take place as long as an initial connection is accepted - unless you use connect.

[15-May-19 06:29 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I also think you might need to specify the explicit port in the addnode.

[15-May-19 08:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no need to add port. Yes KMDLabs/master. 
Pretty sure jl777 KMD will also sync labs chains atm, but you cant use it to load a chain synced with LABS komodod. This will change before launch, but it will break LABS notary nodes if I fix it now, so waiting until we end the current chains.

[15-May-19 11:55 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
can i get some help with segids

[15-May-19 11:56 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
440 stakes a day, 43,000 a month.
/64 = 675 stakes per segid per month (roughly)

If one were to presume theyd stake half of all blocks, in a perfect world, 
675/2, so 337.5 Utxo per segid

[15-May-19 11:57 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
is that logic sort of correct 😮

[15-May-19 11:57 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
if someone were to expect 10% of all stakes, 67.5 utxos in each

[15-May-19 12:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
440 stakes a day? Do you not want other folks to join it?

[15-May-19 12:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Crabby Paddy There is no exact optimal number of UTXOs per seg that will give a specific % of stakes
Staking probability involves size, time since last transferred, and overall supply.
The exact same strategy (splits, size, and segs) that gives me great results on MGNX, yields 1-2 blocks per day on OUR because of the total supply differences (as well as the number of active stakers)

[15-May-19 10:44 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
nah im just making a number up

[15-May-19 10:44 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
if i were to pretend half blocks were mine

[15-May-19 10:44 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
same as how I said 67.5 pretending someone expected 10%.

[15-May-19 10:45 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Somehow, ive "lost" 400 coins over night

[15-May-19 10:45 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
unsure how that happened 😂 any ideas?

[15-May-19 10:47 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I’m looking at fair staking for the our community, hence posting up a guide for everyone. Just need to figure out what everyone should use as a rough formula on utxo splitting

[15-May-19 10:48 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I did getbalance before I went to sleep and getbalance now and the amounts dropped

[16-May-19 12:00 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Would I be staking to someone else’s address by accident and the utxo which staked the block are being sent out as well as reward? Can’t think how else it would cause this

[16-May-19 02:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[16-May-19 10:47 AM] gcharang#6833
Correct me if I'm wrong:

For labs notaries, with respect to dPoW:
```
central chain - data store chain 
KMD - BTC
LABS - KMD
```
other labs chains in the cluster are notarised to LABS chain but not KMD
only LABS chain is notarised to KMD

[16-May-19 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No all chains are directly notarized to kmd itself

[16-May-19 01:10 PM] gcharang#6833
Is there a particular reason for doing that? I mean we could save KMD tx fee if the other labs chains are notarised to the LABS main chain

[16-May-19 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What would you save? $2 a year?

[16-May-19 01:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd have to double check to be 100% positive, but at a glance I haven't spent a whole KMD since we began

[16-May-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats why we ran for KMD notaries.

[16-May-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And its not worth the 1000H of work to get MoMoM to wrok with a chain other than KMD.

[16-May-19 01:45 PM] gcharang#6833
> And its not worth the 1000H of work to get MoMoM to wrok with a chain other than KMD.

Thats a good reason

> What would you save? $2 a year?

Didn't calculate the fees exactly, but if they are this low, then it is indeed not worth the effort

[16-May-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah its really not easy to do... KMD has plenty of block space atill left... so just using it seemed the safest and easierst option. We should get enough KMD donations to alst for many many years to KMD just this one season comming up

[16-May-19 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Obviously the costs will grow as LABS grows, but I can't see a point were it grows to be "expensive" on balance
