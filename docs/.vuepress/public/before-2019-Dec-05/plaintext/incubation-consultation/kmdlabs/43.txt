Technically its unlimited chains ... single use throw away ... unless the creator/a receiver wants to keep it to prove it existed at that exact point in time.

advantage of thinking things through, instead of randomly flailing about

[16-Oct-18 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
sometimes the latter is the only option though

[16-Oct-18 03:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I still need to try and break it... but it seems that it is picking up the last TX, then using `Gettransaction` to fetch the correct vout's scriptpubkey. Wasnt anywhere near as simple as I thaught it would be.. But its been a very productive day. There was plenty of random flailing about dont worry 😂

[16-Oct-18 03:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
being only on my thrid test chain depspite making conesnsus changes, is unexpected aswell. 😄

What did u build?  I haven’t tried hard to find screen sharing options, but cross platform desktop electron is similar to browser, same function, getUserMedia, just an extra step about selecting desktop/window required - https://github.com/hokein/electron-sample-apps/tree/master/desktop-capture

Even chunks of 200kB, at tx blast level, can chunkify the binary in api

[16-Oct-18 10:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Mylo I have the chain and the tool to place the data onto the chain, I would not worry too much about breaking the file up, you want yo do like what ffmpeg does when it encodes and stream the video directly to a file in disk. From there I will use c code to fread the the file into 8kb chunks of hex ( its actually a bit less than that) add a seq number then scan forward to the next chuck read it and send. I can probably get bandwidth though this chain of 400-500kb a second. Depending on CPU power, something like my ryzen 2700x might be even faster then that and I will test it don't worry ;)

The problem I have it getting that data out of the chain and putting it back together

[16-Oct-18 10:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But it might even be some reverse C code of the input, in the deamon itself that extracts the op return from every tx in a block as the block is received, we need to never use the wallet for this for obvious reasons.

[16-Oct-18 10:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So your dapp will likely just be reading a file I think vlc can do this or at least it works for partial DL torrent files

[16-Oct-18 10:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The api to send will be a combo of RPC calls from market maker and komodod btw

[17-Oct-18 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I could try to port all the TxBlast API into komodod itself ... but hat seems very dangerous thing to do 🤔

[17-Oct-18 04:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, better not include a "nuke" in komodod

[17-Oct-18 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
you can do what oracle does, but in reverse, put the previous txid in the opreturn also

[17-Oct-18 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
then given any 8000 bytes data, you can just get the prior transactions until you get to the start

[17-Oct-18 04:33 AM] jl777c#5810
you will need to buffer things anyway, so using the algo like:
set maxseqid by scanning the opreturn, save the 8kb in its spot fseek(fp,seqid * 8000,SEEK_SET), fwrite(...)
then when you have the first N chunks, start playback
you can validate the entire linked list by starting from maxseqid and iterating backward

Finally got my 32GB ram in the RYZEN 2700X and reading a random message here yesterday found about microsoft Hyper-V ... sadly it needs to run win10 because of O/C and driver issues with linux... like you cant get the temp of the CPU and a few other things. Will be testing out hyper-v and see if it matches linux native preformance this afternoon. Should help a LOT with my dev stuff, rather than having 2 entire screens here not being used, and doing all compilation etc on remote VPS.(edited)
Should really be able to push the STREAMER chain now, over 1Gbit local lan network, and very powerful CPU to see how much it can push through under optimal conditions.

[17-Oct-18 06:37 AM] TonyL#3577
@blackjok3r If you'll stream HLS data sequence shouldn't be a problem if you'll also generate manifest file (.m3u8) in which chunks playback sequence declared.
So for a life streaming it should be a mediaserver on one side  which generating HLS output from input (stream on input or screen capture) - let's say 10 chunks (1.ts, 2.ts and so on, each chunk is 10 seconds by HLS standart recommendations) + manifest where declared playback sequency:
```
1.ts
2.ts
...
10.ts```
Then you have to continue publish chunks to oracle and refreshed manifest (with same name) depends of time elapsed. Let's say on next publishing it will be 
```
5.ts
6.ts
....
15.ts```
This manifest should be available by link/path for VLC like a http://sever/manifest.m3u8 
You can adjust video bitrate to match needed blockchain capacity

[17-Oct-18 06:39 AM] TonyL#3577
So you even shouldn't care about sequence downloading if you'll encode chunk file name

[17-Oct-18 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think we can even use oracle to send the data... I have a tool based on TxBlaster API, which will read a file and seek though it taking 8KB at a time then sending. For the very first test I was using a huge hex string hardcoded inot marketmaker, and just sending the same data every time, I tried to randomly generate it but ran into pointer issues with C strings and gave up. 

We will then need a function or RPC in komodod for ac_streamer=1 chains that gathers this data and writes it out to a file i the same order it was sent, as it wont always arrive in order exactly, james suggeston of having the sequence number, then the previous txid, then fill the rest of the op_return with what fits, seems like a good ideo.

[17-Oct-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we cannot use the starndard wallet at all ...

[17-Oct-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ie you cannot send utxo from the local wallet... and you cannot receive utxo to local walelt.

[17-Oct-18 06:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I see, just saw you want to broadcast some video and since worked few years in ott/iptv solution provider company and saw buzz words (for me) video streaming put my 5 cents 😃

[17-Oct-18 06:44 AM] TonyL#3577
I've tested with data like a `ff` as well

[17-Oct-18 06:44 AM] TonyL#3577

I wont kow how to make it or what will happen until i start experimenting with it, and likely there will as always be more than one way to skin a cat .

[17-Oct-18 06:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Btw possible to make some "cheating" streaming for starting test if broadcast not chunks itself but just manifest with links to chunks inside

[17-Oct-18 06:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm just wondered that such blockchain streaming may be the darkest streaming in the world. Child porn, terrorists content and so on

[17-Oct-18 06:49 AM] TonyL#3577
No way to stop or block

[17-Oct-18 06:49 AM] TonyL#3577
🙀

[17-Oct-18 06:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will probably not even start with video, and just try to take raw files and get them into and out of the blockchain so they are the same, hopefully as close to real time as possible.

[17-Oct-18 06:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Depends who knows about it ... the source is only from 1 single place ... so if this IP is known it can still be blocked or tuned off.

[17-Oct-18 06:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh thats what I tested but just files with text inside. Posted it line by line to oracle - then read from oracle and compare with original

[17-Oct-18 06:51 AM] TonyL#3577
But video possible to post as raw file as well, and pictures

[17-Oct-18 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, oracle is really good, but to move this much data might not be suitable ... never know though maybe it could be... but sending enough TX fast enough is the likley limitaion with powerful enough CPU mining and serving the chain.

[17-Oct-18 06:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Sounds scary, af. I hope people will post only kittens, puppies and unicorns

[17-Oct-18 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I found that with such large TX sizes, sending the TX to a miner in a diffrent country was totally broken, so had to send the TX and mined all the blocks on the same machine.

[17-Oct-18 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I really hope its not used only for bad things ... I think mostly I thaugt about the implications, of being able to send any data to a blockchain, have it dPoW to KMD, then a verification of that data is always possible, to know if it was tampered with. Its a short lived chain.

[17-Oct-18 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but anyone with a copy can always know that it is orgiional source.

[17-Oct-18 06:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As storing it on an actual KMD AC or any chain on a KMD notary node, could get the notaries in legal trouble ... simply run for a few days until data fee runs out, and then remove it

[17-Oct-18 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
you could used oracles CC binary data mode, that would take care of the ordering of chunks

[17-Oct-18 07:20 AM] Mylo#8306
@blackjok3r sure!  I’d still want some non-file access (rpc), browsers don’t have access to filesystem (sandbox) so need to chunkify anyway.  Unless streamed into rpc.  Chunkify is done but time-based in streaming, and playback already handled.  So as long as say (500kB) can be sent to an rpc, it’ll work from browser too.  Limitations are sandboxed environment.  PWAs (progressive web apps) have access to camera/contacts/cache so this rpc method required for mobile streaming.

[17-Oct-18 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we cna make it to take a giant hex in RPC, as long as it can be enough at once to keep the blaster saturated.

[17-Oct-18 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
blaster works on mempool size and keeps it within a range. but I guess thats not really required in this case, that is only to keep the chain at capacity

[17-Oct-18 07:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as the mempool isnt hundreds of MBs

[17-Oct-18 07:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then eveyrhting will break

[17-Oct-18 07:26 AM] Mylo#8306
That’s cool.  We can solve those issues when they happen by caching to disk on blaster.  Public-blasters-as-a-service style thing.

[17-Oct-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the txblaster has one place in the code where it looks for the hex string to add to the opreturn.

[17-Oct-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
right now it is hardcoded

[17-Oct-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
by changing it to a function call

[17-Oct-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
you can make that function provide the hex string

[17-Oct-18 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
and the function can be whatever that function can do

[17-Oct-18 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
a ram based queue that was fed in via rpc

[17-Oct-18 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
a file that is growing on disk that it is scanning and automatically grabbing the latest and putting it into the ram based queue

[17-Oct-18 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so I would implement a ram based queue of blaster hexstrings

[17-Oct-18 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
then the function just dequeues the next packet from the queue, of course if queue is empty, then the blaster just sleeps for a bit or returns error or whatever

[17-Oct-18 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
then you can have an rpc call that adds to the blaster queue

[17-Oct-18 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
this allows an app level to monitor a file, and call rpc to add to the blaster queue

[17-Oct-18 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
or just sampling a webcam directly and sending hex strings to the blaster queue

[17-Oct-18 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
that is my advice on how to do this to make it reliable and flexible

If OP_RETURN can be pruned and a node continue to function as normal, can it be changed/faked and a node continue to function as normal?

[17-Oct-18 07:46 AM] Alright#0419
answer is no, yes?

[17-Oct-18 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
you mean prune opreturn from the blockchain data?

[17-Oct-18 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
txindex=0 would do that

[17-Oct-18 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
a pruned node

[17-Oct-18 07:46 AM] Alright#0419
Yes, I see that's it's possible to run a BTC node that prunes OP_RETURN data to save space

[17-Oct-18 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it prunes all tx data

[17-Oct-18 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
though not for tx in your wallet...

[17-Oct-18 07:48 AM] Alright#0419
so OP_RETURN is hashed along with the rest of data in tx?

[17-Oct-18 07:48 AM] Alright#0419
changing it would effect the hash?

[17-Oct-18 07:49 AM] Alright#0419
my question is that if you can run a node that simple ignores OP_RETURNs, can you run a node that replaces OP_RETURNs with arbitrary data, broadcast these faked OP_RETURNs and have other node accept them as valid?

[17-Oct-18 07:50 AM] Alright#0419
I'm assuming the answer is no, but I'm just curious as to how you can ignore/delete OP_RETURNs locally and have a node continue to function as normal

[17-Oct-18 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
txid is double sha256 of the serialized transaction

[17-Oct-18 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
which includes all vouts, including opreturn vouts

{Reactions}
👌 

[17-Oct-18 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you get a hash collision, your fake opreturn is rejected as invalid txid, or just treated as a different transaction and double spending the same inputs

[17-Oct-18 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
opreturns dont get into the utxo DB

[17-Oct-18 08:09 AM] Alright#0419
