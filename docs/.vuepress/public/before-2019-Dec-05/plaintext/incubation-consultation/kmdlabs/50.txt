I can try to make it be able to handle multiple streams at once its not impossible

[26-Oct-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as each chunk has the first txid at the start, you can identify the stream you want by that txid, and ignore any txs in the block that are not OP_RETURN starting with that

[26-Oct-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I didnt think it would need to handle more than 1 stream at a time

[26-Oct-18 01:44 AM] daemonfox#6136
It could work that way

[26-Oct-18 01:44 AM] daemonfox#6136
Queue up the stream requests of the data hex supplied for each stream

[26-Oct-18 01:44 AM] daemonfox#6136
submit in order

[26-Oct-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[26-Oct-18 01:44 AM] daemonfox#6136
its slower but works fine for concept

[26-Oct-18 01:45 AM] daemonfox#6136
multi would still be desireable

[26-Oct-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is the current process:
1) send TxBlast RPC to marketmaker to activate stream (time out, name ext included in this call)
2) send hexstring with another RPC on a diffrent RPC port
3) when the TxBlast loop sees data it sends it

[26-Oct-18 01:46 AM] daemonfox#6136
so is this concept 1 stream per chain or would each chainhave child streams?

[26-Oct-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Each chain can have multiple streams one after the other

[26-Oct-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but not at the same time

[26-Oct-18 01:46 AM] daemonfox#6136
ok

[26-Oct-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But it doesnt need to be like that... however

[26-Oct-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you could just use an oracle

[26-Oct-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on the streamer chain

[26-Oct-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for other data

[26-Oct-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that would handle all kinds of shit that this limitation does not have

[26-Oct-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is for very large data

[26-Oct-18 01:47 AM] daemonfox#6136
what is an Oracle in the KMD sense?

[26-Oct-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It allows putting off chain data on chain.

[26-Oct-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Combined with the single miner ondemand blocks of -ac_stream=1 chain I think it would do what you want

[26-Oct-18 01:48 AM] daemonfox#6136
that solves another issue id have to contend with in my idea... historical data being imported first then transactional live going forward

[26-Oct-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
How much data are you talking about?

[26-Oct-18 01:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
i cant describe it all in chat text lol

[26-Oct-18 01:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
baseline though

[26-Oct-18 01:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
Its basic customer info in one stream

[26-Oct-18 01:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
basic sales header data in another

[26-Oct-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think oracle would be what your looking for

[26-Oct-18 01:50 AM] daemonfox#6136
then the item dtails of the sale, purchase order details, account receivables... all unique streams

[26-Oct-18 01:50 AM] daemonfox#6136
it sounds like it

[26-Oct-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright and smk762 have been working with it, chatt app and a dog gps tracker

[26-Oct-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I havent got a lot of experance with it... but its very powerful

[26-Oct-18 01:50 AM] daemonfox#6136
some of our largest DBs have grown to 50+ GBs for markets turning $250M or more in annual sales

[26-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm thats a lot of data lol

[26-Oct-18 01:51 AM] Alright#0419
how much data at a time?

[26-Oct-18 01:51 AM] daemonfox#6136
it is old DB structure redundant

[26-Oct-18 01:51 AM] daemonfox#6136
I intend to dedupe it for this scope

[26-Oct-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
streamer has a bout a 10% overhead over the raw hex data tself

[26-Oct-18 01:52 AM] Alright#0419
You can probably just make a dapp with oracles if it's not much data at once

[26-Oct-18 01:52 AM] daemonfox#6136
min 12 SQL record sets in 12 tables each sale written but its single lines written except the sales item details

[26-Oct-18 01:52 AM] daemonfox#6136
it would be small sets of single transactions

[26-Oct-18 01:52 AM] Alright#0419
you can verify who sent data via pubkey

[26-Oct-18 01:53 AM] daemonfox#6136
but the sheer bulk of how many it holds live for our systems is shocking

[26-Oct-18 01:53 AM] Alright#0419
You can do it with oracles pretty easily I think

[26-Oct-18 01:53 AM] daemonfox#6136
and thats what id like to figure out is to structure some Dapps and CCs to make that a reality

[26-Oct-18 01:53 AM] daemonfox#6136
Thats an ERP powerhouse

[26-Oct-18 01:53 AM] Alright#0419
Want to test my chat dapp?

[26-Oct-18 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wonder if oracles has any limitations on how much data a single chain/oracle can handle?

[26-Oct-18 01:54 AM] Alright#0419
2mb a minute?

[26-Oct-18 01:54 AM] Alright#0419
in reality a bit less

[26-Oct-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean like to fetch it  and stuff... with 50Gbs of data in chain, would it still return fast and all that ?

[26-Oct-18 01:54 AM] daemonfox#6136
hey I can extract some data to make some real world hex examples of what I want

[26-Oct-18 01:54 AM] daemonfox#6136
Ill just need some time to read upon the KMD wiki

[26-Oct-18 01:55 AM] daemonfox#6136
and yes id love to test the chat dapp

[26-Oct-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah Im down

[26-Oct-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
STAKEDED ?

[26-Oct-18 01:55 AM] Alright#0419
sure

[26-Oct-18 01:55 AM] daemonfox#6136
i was just playing with the tipbots and wondered if they were dapps?

[26-Oct-18 01:55 AM] daemonfox#6136
STAKEDED lol

[26-Oct-18 01:55 AM] Alright#0419
I can add tips to the chat dapp very easily

[26-Oct-18 01:56 AM] Alright#0419
just send a tx to the pubkey of the person you're talking to

[26-Oct-18 01:56 AM] Alright#0419
literally just a normal transaction

[26-Oct-18 01:56 AM] daemonfox#6136
is chat in the latest Agama or CLI only?

[26-Oct-18 01:57 AM] Alright#0419
nope

[26-Oct-18 01:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
thought i saw something on your trello board about that

really need to write a readme, still cleaning up scripts

[26-Oct-18 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
clone that on a machine you're running a STAKED chain on

[26-Oct-18 01:58 AM] daemonfox#6136
Did STAKED go live... i need to import my keys lol

[26-Oct-18 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
do `pip3 install requests`

that's an example of grabbing a json from the chain

[26-Oct-18 02:05 AM] daemonfox#6136
what distro you guys use?

[26-Oct-18 02:05 AM] daemonfox#6136
tired or these random Ubuntu issues I keep having that break komodod

[26-Oct-18 02:06 AM] Alright#0419
I use ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04

[26-Oct-18 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
16.04 on all mine atm

[26-Oct-18 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have some on debian9

[26-Oct-18 02:06 AM] Alright#0419
yep same

[26-Oct-18 02:06 AM] daemonfox#6136
Ever use ClearLinux?

[26-Oct-18 02:06 AM] Alright#0419
no idea what that is

[26-Oct-18 02:06 AM] daemonfox#6136
Intel optimized build

[26-Oct-18 02:07 AM] Alright#0419
debian based?

[26-Oct-18 02:07 AM] daemonfox#6136
saw some benchmarking done across many distros on the new 9900K and Clear Linux was beating everyone in things like PHP and pyhtn performance

dunno that any cloud providers have it in templates though

[26-Oct-18 02:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
They do have a GCE ibuild

[26-Oct-18 06:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have verified the data in == data out ðŸ˜„

[26-Oct-18 06:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Now to push a file thorugh and reassemble it

[26-Oct-18 06:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
instead of random data
