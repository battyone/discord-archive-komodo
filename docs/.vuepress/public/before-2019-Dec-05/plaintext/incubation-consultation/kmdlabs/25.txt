[12-Oct-18 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the pangea code is in the LN side

[12-Oct-18 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it might work but would be a lot of work

[12-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Alright#0419
we can use this real time on chain chat for contracts I believe

[12-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Alright#0419
have something similar to an IRC bot

[12-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Alright#0419
or discord bot

[12-Oct-18 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[12-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Alright#0419
that can pay/receive STAKED

[12-Oct-18 02:35 PM] c2k#4915
this could be interseting. i see a lot of lightbulbs going on here üå©

[12-Oct-18 02:36 PM] CrisF#3405
Figure the good thing is that it's easy to test this stuff out on the STAKED cluster.

[12-Oct-18 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
