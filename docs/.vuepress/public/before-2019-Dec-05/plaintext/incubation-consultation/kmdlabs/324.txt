There are phat bugs.... once those are fixed, there wont be any problem with it.

[06-Mar-19 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I worked out how to make sure notarizations made are all in the chain too btw, in iguana. I much prefer a simpler solution rather than making complex workaround that could introduce more bugs.

[06-Mar-19 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its as simple as checking for confirms > 2, and if it ever goes to -1 do sendrawrtransaction.

[06-Mar-19 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Can be added on to the end of the dpowstatemachine start function. and just poll `getrawtransaction <txid> 1 ` until the notarization is notarized, then it can end the statemachine.

[06-Mar-19 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Should be very easy to implement. Even I can write it.

[06-Mar-19 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The only required thing we need, is that all notarizations are in the chain and notarized by tghe next notarizatinon, combined with a longer scan range, so that no MoM hash are lost.

[06-Mar-19 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
combined with the RPCs/script that do impirt only using notarized data, nothing can fail.

@Mylo I'm using multiple oracles for dragonhound - one per user. Appends (encrypted) gps/time for each ping. user oracle txid stored in pgsql db when created  to reference for read/write ops

[06-Mar-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Half way thrrough a fix here guys. 😃

[06-Mar-19 09:17 AM] Mylo#8306
Cool @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator - what I was more interested in was the data structure of the business level logic.
You have shopping cart oracle, you have order oracle.  You have inventory oracle.
The dragon hound is the same data structure, so no need to interface oracle data from one to the other.

Furthering it into different suppliers, they would only want to subscribe to the inventory oracle of their customers (the shop).

[06-Mar-19 09:19 AM] Mylo#8306
So dragon hound is like the line item oracle.  Many line items, many dogs on the loose!

[06-Mar-19 09:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not sure oracle as efficient as legacy db for everything. I'm using a hybrid approach. Things that change over time (like location) are on oracle. Things that stay the same mostly are in db.
I've been working on supply chain too in a *secret* project

[06-Mar-19 09:25 AM] Mylo#8306
Yeah BC doesn’t fit everywhere:)

[06-Mar-19 09:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
main issue is query time for huge number of samples which need to be filtered. much faster from traditional db

[06-Mar-19 09:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and if that info isnt essential for provenance, using oracle is pointless except for "marketing hype"

[06-Mar-19 09:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I am looking into caching oracle samples in db tho, best of both worlds 😉

[06-Mar-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK I have something pretty decent in iguana, only works on KMD side atm, but its just a matter of copy pasting the code to make it work for the source chain aswell. 
Basically what it does is:
1) checks confirms, if over 2 (dpowconfs) or 100 (rawconfirms) then it exits the loop
2) if its not notarized it fetches the raw hex from getrawtransaction and saves it
3) if the transaction is lost from mempool it rebroadcasts it
4) if the transaction is reorged and thus goes from a confirm back to none, it rebraoadcasts it. 
5) once its confirmed it unlocks the KMD utxo, source doesnt need a lock as the utxo is spent, and thus is not in listunspent to be chosen again.

[06-Mar-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This wil force all notarizations to be confirmed eventally. No matter what tricks alright plays on the chain.

[06-Mar-19 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think maybe if import transaction keeps being unable to be sent due to missing MoMoM hash, we will need a way to increase the range of blocks it scans, as if this codein iguana is triggered notarization could be confirmed very very much out of order.

[06-Mar-19 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I already fixed NULL MoMoM this mornign but i reverted it for now, to dev this solution. LABSTH is still working thank god

[06-Mar-19 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  Please update and DM! me when updated. Do not post in here as i gets lost. I am pretty sure most of the problems were becasue if the network being cut in half due to some nodes updating and some not. Hoever this conditon is now accounted for. 😃

[06-Mar-19 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think Im going to change it though ... so that i uses a random sleep between like 30s and 240s... then all node will be constantly checking but not all at the same time

well that shouldnt be happening, but its possible there is bugs

[06-Mar-19 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I got it close... but I cant test every situation

[06-Mar-19 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know why that error happened in testing

[06-Mar-19 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its because the tx hex wasnt copied properly... I think maybe I need to make it check that its not empty before copying 🤣

[06-Mar-19 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` not empty before copying`
yes, that's usually helpful :troll:

[06-Mar-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats why I used memcpy instead of strcopy ... so that it doesnt crash when its empty 😉

[06-Mar-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana is pure C ... you cant use any C++ which makes life a lot easier in komodod

[06-Mar-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I really didnt want to have to touch it, but after a good rest and sleep the solution just came to me, and coded it in a day while looking after a 2 yearold all day who was just trying to drive me nuts at ever possible moment... lucky she slept for 4H in the afternoon 😂

better you than me; there's a reason we stopped at 2 of them 20+ years ago 😛

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  
I just started the other chains on dpow on my node and I dont see any of those errors? do you have any more context of when it does it?

[06-Mar-19 04:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`if ( srctx[0] == 0 && rettx[0] != 0 )` its already checking if the return is empty

[06-Mar-19 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not really, because the problem with stdout is it's a jumble unless it's the rare occurrence of sequential

[06-Mar-19 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes to test this I limited dpow call to LABSTH so it had context

fwiw, another stop/start has it no longer showing

[06-Mar-19 04:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think that makes much diff.. the problem is when it flags a resend... and the tx isnt there (or the memory its in/came from was corrupted )

[06-Mar-19 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
spoke too soon

[06-Mar-19 04:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there was a simpler way to do it...

[06-Mar-19 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I figured that if the tx wasnt in the mempool or confirmed and we saw it before, we can resend it

[06-Mar-19 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so just save it and resend whenever its lost

[06-Mar-19 04:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as long as it's a non-event, I guess it doesn't really matter; it's not like there's too many people like me that have a monitor dedicated to viewing it 😛

[06-Mar-19 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
true... I think it does matter a little bit... iguana has functions to prevent this that will be easy to leverage

[06-Mar-19 04:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, by "non-event" I mean that it doesn't negatively impact the whole

[06-Mar-19 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, a print that doesn't matter in the scope of overall functionality is just ignorable output

Updated too

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  
Pushed update to iguana that fixes all those errors, was a memory coruption issue, not zeroing out the strings the tx was saved in on initialize. 
Also pushed possible fix for memleak. Dont want to @ staker for this one, but a few people who know what to look for will be able to tell us if the iguana mem use is any better. It will still increase but should now cap ou, rather than just constantly go up.

Is looking at the mem usage in `htop` enough?
