@Steve Lee what do you think üëÜ

[07-Nov-18 12:03 PM] PTYX#6840
I think that's a great idea.

[07-Nov-18 12:50 PM] emma#2653
asset chains are great tech .. we need to actively find product market fit for it... Don't believe in "If you build they will come" ... need to talk to businesses/ enterprise and help them to utilise asset chains to bring efficiency in their business.. which either create new markets or help in cost saving .. In my view many cost saving use cases / proposals can help in market penetration .. as this will help in grow komodo ecosystem.. more use for the platform and more developers attracted to learn and build on komodo blockchain .. many platforms such as stellar and waves are partnering with enterprises .. komodo with current tech (some additional java script libraries to use like komodo.js to interact with asset chains)   is enough for business use case ..

[07-Nov-18 12:52 PM] emma#2653
In my view, we should put efforts on making komodo more robust and stable (1st priority for business which create trust) .. and increase adaptability..this will also help in deciding what kind of features we should prioritises on platform ...

[07-Nov-18 12:57 PM] emma#2653
these were my views, again back to same question.. what is a minimalist app i can build ....are there any explorer library which  I can plug into my asset chain?

[07-Nov-18 12:59 PM] emma#2653

build in explorer like bcoin library has one ..

[07-Nov-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
there are insight explorer install scripts that works with unmodified komodod, not sure where the repo is

[07-Nov-18 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain we should have the repo of the insight explorers in the page with the list of all our repos

[07-Nov-18 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
insight explorer requires some specific extensions, which most coins dont have

Do I understand correctly @emma, you would like to build a demo, or possible production model, of this?

[07-Nov-18 01:15 PM] emma#2653
a side project for learning purpose

[07-Nov-18 01:16 PM] CrisF#3405
What do you need to do that?

[07-Nov-18 01:19 PM] emma#2653
A asset chain usecase

[07-Nov-18 01:19 PM] jorian#4555
i think there are plenty

[07-Nov-18 01:19 PM] jorian#4555
but no-one has made one yet

[07-Nov-18 01:19 PM] jorian#4555
because most of it is still unclear / unknown to the creative minds

[07-Nov-18 01:20 PM] emma#2653
meanwhile I didn't understand this point "Run your daemon start script (credentials used by insight are defined here): ./oot-start-daemon.sh (we made this one for OOT.)"  in https://github.com/Utrum/ac-insight-docker

maybe docker is a step too far? if you don't know docker, this might be of help too: https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo-explorers-install and https://github.com/SuperNETorg/komodo-block-explorer

although docker makes it a lot simpler

[07-Nov-18 01:27 PM] jorian#4555
yes but if you dont know what you're doing, it might be better to first understand how the explorer works from the inside

[07-Nov-18 01:27 PM] jorian#4555
d?

[07-Nov-18 01:28 PM] jorian#4555
true

[07-Nov-18 01:28 PM] jorian#4555
but the shell scripts give a good inside of what it takes to set up an explorer

[08-Nov-18 10:31 AM] CMaurice#1685
Soooo. I'd like to see blockchain enabling a mesh of collateral, facilitating trade finance, a bit like a representation of the Turkish post-dated cheques system.

I'm not sure yet what it would look like in a practical sense, but I have several ideas informed by a long interest in the subject.

This seems possible to me in the light of the extraordinary changes in distribution over the last ten years, at least here where fully half the economy seems to be delivering very small boxes to small boxes in the sky.

Where we'll eventually get to: barter, crowd funding, import/export, eBay, Amazon.

So need to choose a small and achievable use-case, like a vanilla farmer exporting to a London ice cream makers, a Macedonian hand-huller providing sun dried apricot kernels to me, a small-run FPGA designer in Cambridge wanting funding for a new device. I'd also like some un-roasted coffee beans (import tax and duty free here) and organic cashew supplies, please.

Something that uses several techniques like escrow (obviously for crowd supply, but also export), multi-sig (perhaps a release of a proportion of funds on OK from agreed 3rd party quality control in importing country). These are just example ideas.

in a way, it's sort of how I got here, looking for the tools.  I wasn't satisfied with where ETH was going, I came across Paul Sztorc's 'bit assets' and kept going  until I found the CC stuff here

[08-Nov-18 11:05 AM] CrisF#3405
That is a great use of the tech, @CMaurice .  World-changing potential.

[08-Nov-18 11:09 AM] CrisF#3405
That is what I've found so attractive here.  The realistic potential to empower people like me, with little knowledge and experience in tech.  And finding the people who can make that happen.

Notary nodes make loads of txs.. .

[08-Nov-18 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
currently the only way to "fix" it is ot send the whole balance ot youself every few weeks and then import he private key with a rescan of only a few blocks

[08-Nov-18 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
needless downtime

[08-Nov-18 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nearly have a new solution working, where once all the utxo are spent, the old txs are removed automatically

[08-Nov-18 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you only need to know whats avalible to be spent, dont need to save te GB's of sent txs, as every time you try to send a tx, it ahs to load all these old ones and sort them, slowing it down to a crawl .

I sometimes think if it's possible to use `iguana` native ramchains for notarizing.... ü§î

[08-Nov-18 04:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it just gets over with all such issues.... the only thing is the stability of the `iguana` ramchains.

[08-Nov-18 04:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Got very close tonight to a working implemntation, just need to get a few issues sorted where it sometimes tricks iteslf and imports spent utxo (out of 1700 utxo I have 4 that are wrong) and I have found the condition that does it... need sleep to sort it out though, no use runnign in circles anymore tonight.

[08-Nov-18 04:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The bitcoin wallet isnt so bad, as long as you dont aske it to run a bank ... it wasnt designed for that... it designed ot be a wallet ... imagin runniga bank out of your poocket üòâ

[08-Nov-18 04:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c just to play with, does `iguana` has the API calls for Bitcoin which are used for notarising?
 like replacing `bitcoind` with `iguana`

[08-Nov-18 04:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
_not gonna play with my active notarise_ just curious to ask about this.

@blackjok3r so you mean if I try to sync `iguana` BTC with the network downloading blocks from network it will not do after certain height ?

Thanks @Cryptoon!

[09-Nov-18 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I sorted the issues I was facing... I think that if someone uses the notary wallet to make a lot of normal transactions, it could run into issues... and in that case they would need to carry out a normal wallet reset ... to fix things, before  the walelt auto clean would be able to work... There is also another option I may add to it, where you smply give it a txid and have it remove all TX's that are not that.

[09-Nov-18 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This allows you to preform a normal wallet reset, ie. send all your funds to yourself... then just call the funciton to remove every tx that is not this transaction.

[09-Nov-18 03:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The normal mode is quite complicated in the end, but a call of it will:
1) scan the wallet for transactions where all the vouts that are yours are spent
2) scan the wallet for all transactions to the CRYPTO address (notarisations) 
3) cross check all notarisations to transactions that are totally spent
4) remove all notarisations that came from the totally spent transations
5) remove the totally spent transactions

[09-Nov-18 03:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think a call of this funciton every 500 blocks, would keep the wallet a very small size.

@Alright  MGNX is also now on 100% PoS like CFEK is.... not really sure how to check why this is the case ... my guess is that the PoS has driven the difficulty higher than very low hash can mine the chains?

[09-Nov-18 10:31 AM] CrisF#3405
Been a while since I've had a notarization on MLT.  Over 2 days.
