lol - you are smart enough @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[26-Jan-19 04:11 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
thats my 2 cents of the week

[26-Jan-19 04:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my wife says that if you're "staking" one of those, then you're doing it wrong....

[26-Jan-19 04:11 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
you got what you paid for

[26-Jan-19 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just stupidly tried to split my utxos

[26-Jan-19 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤦

[26-Jan-19 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now need to rent a few mega sol to unstick the chain

[26-Jan-19 04:13 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
if your wifes name is Cindy........get a new one

[26-Jan-19 04:15 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
we have scripts to split  UTXOs - get on with the real shit

[26-Jan-19 04:18 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
UTXOs are old school anyway

[26-Jan-19 04:20 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

KISS = keep it simple dumbass -- i just read back 1 day

[26-Jan-19 04:57 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
if i read back 2 days ------ I will be sorry for my comentary

[26-Jan-19 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pushed fix for usign Stratum to PoW mine while staking. this solves the staking/mining on a single node. As equihash  isnt really able to be daemon mined and actually find any coins. 😃

[26-Jan-19 04:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Had to ring my ISp to get a real IP address, they put me behind NAT.... while on hold they had some massive speech about being called Aussie Broadband doesnt mean that people who work there all have an Australkian Accent and racial abuse would not be tolerated. 😂

[26-Jan-19 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very much so

[26-Jan-19 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ive got 150K/sol on it and found like 1 block

[26-Jan-19 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Itr needs stakers... I fucked up... split utxos

[26-Jan-19 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dont think I can fix it... wasted $10 on hash

[26-Jan-19 06:09 AM] gt#2812
why does splitting cause a problem? not enough weight?

[26-Jan-19 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they need to be 100 blocks old... however that said., I seems to have unstuck it

[26-Jan-19 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it hitting the 382s block time exception every time... but its staking

[26-Jan-19 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and I have it mining with stratum onm the same daemon

[26-Jan-19 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that took a while 😅

[26-Jan-19 08:05 AM] CrisF#3405

[26-Jan-19 08:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Wonder how long that was spamming for...

[26-Jan-19 08:06 AM] CrisF#3405
`pkill -15` managed to to stop komodod.

[26-Jan-19 08:07 AM] CrisF#3405
Hopefully can restart from there.

[26-Jan-19 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That is meaningless

[26-Jan-19 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ppl just got to my ghouse for a party... great timing

[26-Jan-19 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pushed as new version to master... dont upgrade unless you need to.. it may have build issues from upstream... Not sure wqhats going on there.

[26-Jan-19 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IT built for after a few goes

💯 👍 🇦🇺 (5) 

[26-Jan-19 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It wouldn't be Australia if ppl didn't fight on Australia day 😂

[26-Jan-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This has to be the shortest party I've ever been to

[26-Jan-19 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤣

[26-Jan-19 10:21 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Aha, should I ask what happened

[26-Jan-19 10:25 AM] zatJUM#9924
Still no LABST nota 😦

[26-Jan-19 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I unstuck the chain but there needs to be more nodes on that chain

[26-Jan-19 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  can u check the curl for best mask

[26-Jan-19 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also check your kmd isn't stuck... If it's not matching explorer for highest block, do reconsiderblock RPC 100 blocks before the block you are on. After updating and restarting

[26-Jan-19 10:39 AM] zatJUM#9924
1200929 now, seems ok

[26-Jan-19 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@NutellaLicka  you know when really deubk ppl demand to drive?

[26-Jan-19 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In their work car 😂

[26-Jan-19 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Had to just let him in the end... Hope he's OK lol

[26-Jan-19 10:57 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Dang, thats shitty

[26-Jan-19 10:57 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Damn drunk people

[26-Jan-19 11:26 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
That has just taken me 24h to get my notary back t a semblance of working.
that's what you get for running an untested jok3r build before other people tell you what's wrong with it!

[26-Jan-19 11:29 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r ```curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}" | jq -c .[]```

[26-Jan-19 11:29 AM] CrisF#3405
Still re-syncing here.

[26-Jan-19 11:30 AM] CrisF#3405
I've been wondering how accurate that's been lately.

[26-Jan-19 11:35 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I gave up on re-sync and did scp from another of my nodes instead.

[26-Jan-19 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Resync took an intense anoimt of time here almost 18h

[26-Jan-19 11:38 AM] CrisF#3405
That's a good idea, @Bar_F1sh_Rel.  Just over 2/3 done now but very slow.

[26-Jan-19 11:39 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
and it gets slower as the percentage increases

[26-Jan-19 11:39 AM] gt#2812
try bootstrap ?

[26-Jan-19 11:40 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
scp = bootstrap

{Reactions}
👌 🔥 

[26-Jan-19 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes

[26-Jan-19 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its slowest at 90% +

[26-Jan-19 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like by miles

[26-Jan-19 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I found what the problem was.... But its zcash sapling code and we can't disable it

[26-Jan-19 11:42 AM] CrisF#3405
@gt Unfortunately, NN doesn't have disk space for the blocks and bootstrap :/

[26-Jan-19 11:43 AM] gt#2812
ah ha

[26-Jan-19 11:47 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@CrisF - you have two VM running komodo (NN + other)?

[26-Jan-19 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can do like 4 VM for labs for $5 a month

[26-Jan-19 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I rhi k on the same server will be even faster than the same data centre

[26-Jan-19 11:58 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, NN + others

[26-Jan-19 12:00 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
With scp - you can just delete ``/blocks`` and ``/chainstate`` folders on the target and then scp those folders from the source (as long as komodo is stopped on both) - shouldn't take that much overhead?

[26-Jan-19 12:06 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
as there is no uncompress step.

[26-Jan-19 12:16 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks!

[26-Jan-19 12:20 PM] Alright#0419
is listunspent broken?

[26-Jan-19 12:20 PM] Alright#0419
I have a balance on my NN, but listunspent is empty

[26-Jan-19 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
iirc balance includes 0 conf and listunspent doesn't

[26-Jan-19 12:23 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
returns utxo's on my recently re-compiled Labs NN

[26-Jan-19 12:23 PM] Alright#0419

[26-Jan-19 12:28 PM] CrisF#3405
Have there been any LABST notarizations?

[26-Jan-19 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[26-Jan-19 12:29 PM] Alright#0419
yep

[26-Jan-19 12:29 PM] CrisF#3405
Great 🔥

[26-Jan-19 12:32 PM] Alright#0419
I'll be putting on PAYME shortly

[26-Jan-19 12:32 PM] Alright#0419
then explorers for both LABST and PAYME

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you going to make airdrop verification scripts?

[26-Jan-19 12:35 PM] Alright#0419
Tony claimed the 200, but I'll give another 50 KMD for another set of them
