for the stakednotary - is the config.ini containing (my)own KMD keys or a specific set?

[28-Oct-18 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can use what every you want .. the pubkeys are set in the source code before launch, notaries must supply the ones they want to use

[28-Oct-18 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and protect the private key

[28-Oct-18 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
very imprtant

note these are just test coins though, so don't rack up too big a power bill!

[28-Oct-18 11:11 PM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator is that based on StakedNotary assetchains.json or StakedChain/komodo assetchains.json

[29-Oct-18 12:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm pretty sure all his script pull stakednoraty

Pool was getting json data from your oracle now it has `cd ~/StakedNotary;  git pull; ac_json=$(cat assetchains.json)`

[29-Oct-18 07:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
If I gat a chance this evening I'll get up to speed on trollbox, looked at the code while playing with oracles over the weekend but yet to use it.

[29-Oct-18 07:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Kept getting -25 errors on sendrawtransaction at the oralclesdata stage üòë

Hi, when STAKED goes live with the testnet still be available for testing?

[29-Oct-18 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We think so yes, it depends, I dont want to keep paying for 3 VPS, its adds up, if some new notaries take a few spots to spread the load out should be good.

I'd like to maintain a test environment. It's been fun burning valueless coins. I just emptied 5 of my chain wallets testing a script lol.

[29-Oct-18 12:35 PM] CrisF#3405
DOH!

[29-Oct-18 12:35 PM] CrisF#3405
I've lost a few myself, haha.

[29-Oct-18 12:36 PM] CrisF#3405
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Let me know if you need some coins.

[29-Oct-18 12:39 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
should be ok now pool is up. mined 5k ARB which didnt burn. Saw a new error message -

[29-Oct-18 12:40 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`
error code: -4
error message:

`

[29-Oct-18 12:41 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
script was to generate new address/pubkey into config.ini and send all funds to it. Somewhere along the lines they got sent somewhere else...

[29-Oct-18 12:42 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
running a migrate loop now to split ARB equally across other chains.

[29-Oct-18 12:42 PM] CrisF#3405
Cool!

[29-Oct-18 12:42 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
loaded up trollbox without error. how long until messages appear?

[29-Oct-18 12:43 PM] CrisF#3405
It should be almost instantly I think.

[29-Oct-18 12:43 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
mm not working for me then

[29-Oct-18 12:44 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
might reboot, daemon pubkey doesnt match config ini right now.

[29-Oct-18 12:44 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm just heading off now so won't be able to give it a try.

[29-Oct-18 12:45 PM] CrisF#3405
My to do list is getting out of hand!

[29-Oct-18 12:46 PM] CrisF#3405
On the very first trollbox my pubkeys didn't match but it still worked.  A lot has changed since then though.

[29-Oct-18 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I havent even had time to do the new troll box, but I am pretty sure it needs the right pubkey set, as I added the pubkey to get info espeically for the new chat app

[29-Oct-18 03:35 PM] Alright#0419

I'll have to dig deeper again after work. Managed to get through it without erros last night, but recieve wasnt recieving what I sent perhaps due to pubkey

[29-Oct-18 10:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Do you have any balance on this pubkey?

yea thats fine, im home all day its still early here, kid at school, youngest is here, but she shoudl be sleeping by then

[30-Oct-18 02:02 AM] Alright#0419
so with chat dapp, it's recommended to use a brand new pubkey as someone else will be able to set a username for any pubkey

[30-Oct-18 02:02 AM] Alright#0419
but by using signmessage/verifymessage we can at least show that the person who set it definitely owns it

[30-Oct-18 02:02 AM] Alright#0419
maybe print some big read text if it's set by another pubkey

[30-Oct-18 02:02 AM] Alright#0419
We will also need a definitive chain for storing display names

[30-Oct-18 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we should use hte main STAKED chain to store all the data ? or should be have a seperate chain for that? the main chain is always going to be there and will likey have the most nodes.

[30-Oct-18 02:03 AM] Alright#0419
yea sounds good

[30-Oct-18 02:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean as long as we cont use t to store streamer data lol.. it should be ok... that KMDICE chain is heavily used and still isnt that big in the scheme of thigs

[30-Oct-18 02:05 AM] Alright#0419
proposing STKDMETA where we store bootstraps of all chains that were ever in the cluster

[30-Oct-18 02:05 AM] Alright#0419
outside of the cluster

[30-Oct-18 02:05 AM] Alright#0419
it'll get *huge*, but we only need a handful(two even) of people to run it

[30-Oct-18 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
WE need a dedicated server with heaps of HDD space... HDDs are hell cheap

[30-Oct-18 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that should be able to run a seed node... and that chan

[30-Oct-18 02:06 AM] Alright#0419
how is fetching stored streams?

[30-Oct-18 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at the end of each chain, start a streamer of the compressed bootstrap and uplooad it into the META chain

[30-Oct-18 02:06 AM] Alright#0419
do you need to know their location or would you be able to find all of them easily

[30-Oct-18 02:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the ptoblem is if you want it to be notarised, notaries maybe will need to run a pruned node without the data, as they only need the blockhashes to work

[30-Oct-18 02:07 AM] Alright#0419
lower min sigs on it?
