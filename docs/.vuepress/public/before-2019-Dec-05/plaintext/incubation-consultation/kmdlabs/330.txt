import tombestone exists

[11-Mar-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant import the burn txid more than once

[11-Mar-19 01:17 PM] Alright#0419
so the baggage claim is actually forcing the proper import txid?

[11-Mar-19 01:17 PM] Alright#0419
and not just recreating coins to compensate for it?

[11-Mar-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know this we havent tried it...

[11-Mar-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[11-Mar-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
from what I can see

[11-Mar-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if the import failes with MoMoM validation

[11-Mar-19 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then the min sigs of ntoaries post the MoM hash that allows the burn txid directly to the import tx itself to allow it to validate

[11-Mar-19 01:18 PM] Alright#0419
to be frank, I doubt we'll ever use it üòÇ

[11-Mar-19 01:18 PM] Alright#0419
when doing imports for actual general use, I've never had a single fail

[11-Mar-19 01:18 PM] Alright#0419
only if I'm searching for a fail do i get a fail

[11-Mar-19 01:18 PM] Alright#0419
ie thousands and thousands looped

[11-Mar-19 01:18 PM] Alright#0419
and I'll get a fail or two

[11-Mar-19 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I fixed it, and I also think, that any situation can be covered with a larger range of MoMoM hash

[11-Mar-19 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the bash script sent an export every 30s

[11-Mar-19 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then logged when import failed 90 times, each checking every 60s

[11-Mar-19 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that gives a pretty good coverage... but I fixed that error with a giant hammer

[11-Mar-19 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you jsut include so much data in each notarization that it cant not line up

[11-Mar-19 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ther simpley has to be a notarization that ibncludes the correct MoM hash if you scan back 10 or 1000 blocks on KMD and include every MoM hash

[11-Mar-19 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
at some point, maybe you get so many MoM hash that a false positive could occure so you cant go too silly

[11-Mar-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`sendrawtransaction: transaction already in block chain (code -27)`

[11-Mar-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
somethign wrong with CrisF computer or script is bugged

[11-Mar-19 01:29 PM] Alright#0419
can take a look at the script later today

[11-Mar-19 01:29 PM] Alright#0419
just has to handle different errors differently it seems

[11-Mar-19 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the problem is  it returns -1 as the error code

[11-Mar-19 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so to know what error was what , Iu prointed the exception, and copy pasted that into the python script

[11-Mar-19 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think thats how its meant to work... each error should return a diffrent number.,... not all suppsed to be -1

[11-Mar-19 01:32 PM] Alright#0419
I think pos64staker needs another menu üòÇ

[11-Mar-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this script want easy to make ... but I really hope the logic can be applied properly

[11-Mar-19 01:32 PM] Alright#0419
"Alright's general purpose TUI" is what it really is at this point

[11-Mar-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
likely we need @dukeleto  help on the daemon side

[11-Mar-19 01:33 PM] Alright#0419
we'll pay with hugs and kisses @dukeleto

[11-Mar-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the error handling on C++ I dont quite get... in BTC code the diffrent errors return a diff code... but all the CC stuff si all -1

[11-Mar-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that makes things much ahrder

[11-Mar-19 01:33 PM] Alright#0419
dude it's a dead simple fix

[11-Mar-19 01:33 PM] Alright#0419
if result['error'] == "transactions already in blockchain":

[11-Mar-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I already did that

[11-Mar-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but probably a stupidway

[11-Mar-19 01:34 PM] Alright#0419
needs a try above it because result['error'] doesn't always exist

[11-Mar-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
was only concerned with getting my idea into code to test it...

[11-Mar-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems I worked out how to do that, but the solution to me seems inelegant

[11-Mar-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@libscott

[11-Mar-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[11-Mar-19 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
inelegant > non-working :troll:

[11-Mar-19 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is true

[11-Mar-19 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to be fair his solution was very elegant... it jst forgot reorgs exist

[11-Mar-19 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not even reorgs... I had times in testing today that a notarisation was confirmed before the previous one.... The miner use to orginise them into a lsit that made oldest first.. but you cant know which miner has which notarization in its mempool so I remvoed that

[11-Mar-19 01:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
uh oh, i see i was mentioned

[11-Mar-19 01:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
such backscroll, much wow

[11-Mar-19 01:51 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, one of the migrations must have gone through.  destchain has balance .

[11-Mar-19 01:54 PM] CrisF#3405
I suppose it's the one that Blackjok3r broadcast.

[11-Mar-19 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah cris ... both of the lastr ones said alrady in blockchain

[11-Mar-19 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so its a bug with cript

[11-Mar-19 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you found a bug btw

its not 10k but loll

[11-Mar-19 02:02 PM] CrisF#3405
Haha, I'd better get to finding more bugs then.

[11-Mar-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@dukeleto  tldr.... why does CC errors return error code -1 for al errors? can we easily make it return diffrent error code?

@jeezy  will be super happy if we can fix this

[11-Mar-19 05:55 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Man that migrate sledgehammer is strange.
Not sure why you would get the error
```sendrawtransaction: Expected type string, got number (code -3)
Tried to broadcast x times```
but it does seem to mend after the ``Created backup import tx``

Ayyyy you guys got a logo yet/

[11-Mar-19 09:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Did that ever get cleared up?  I want to add it to our next Notary Campaign poster.

Don't think we all came to a definitive decision

I like the last one.

[12-Mar-19 02:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
coz this one looks to be the most easiest one I can draw by hand, in simplest form.

the the second last one as second choice.

Hi @blackjok3r 
Would you like any help testing migrations/new migration script?
