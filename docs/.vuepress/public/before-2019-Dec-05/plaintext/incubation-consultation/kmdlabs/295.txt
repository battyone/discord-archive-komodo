when I first start it, there is a huge gap in notarizations from what I can only assume is them never being able to agree

[16-Feb-19 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Iguana bails out if it detects a reorg

[16-Feb-19 05:53 AM] Alright#0419
then about an hour or two go by and they suddenly start making notarizations in a timely matter again

[16-Feb-19 05:54 AM] Alright#0419
yes, but it's still reorging

[16-Feb-19 05:54 AM] Alright#0419
huge gap then timely notarization

[16-Feb-19 05:54 AM] Alright#0419
reorgs never stopping

[16-Feb-19 05:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe it is becoming sentient

`do we need ULTRADEAD unstuck or just new chains`
add a few CPUs besides mine and it'll move naturally

[16-Feb-19 05:55 AM] Alright#0419
first jl becomes sentient then his code?

[16-Feb-19 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol

[16-Feb-19 05:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ULTRADEAD diff is 1/3 what it was this after noon, so it's headed in the right direction

[16-Feb-19 05:56 AM] Alright#0419
not sure we need it though @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[16-Feb-19 05:57 AM] Alright#0419
sorry, I'll be back in ~1 hour

[16-Feb-19 05:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm just saying:
don't refek it with a mini 😛

[16-Feb-19 05:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We don't need it... I have a couple of things to check out with the notarypay branch and we can launch a test of the real main chain and a couple of 0br in cluster.

[16-Feb-19 05:58 AM] Alright#0419
if we're doing a main chain test, try to get params that make sense

[16-Feb-19 05:58 AM] Alright#0419
shouldn't be much different from the previous ones

[16-Feb-19 05:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm also not home ATM but must be there in 1h. I have something close to what it should be but need to run some numbers

[16-Feb-19 05:59 AM] Alright#0419
run dem numbers

[16-Feb-19 05:59 AM] Alright#0419
I'll be back

[16-Feb-19 05:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Notary pay not being linear emission makes it a little harder

[16-Feb-19 05:59 AM] Alright#0419
it's near linear if notaries aren't cunts

[16-Feb-19 06:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, after 9000000000000000 ways of how **not** to edit a make file, I'm going to bed and taking most of the next 2 days off
I'll check in on stuff every so often, but for the most part I'm bowling and laying my fat ass in bed with wife

old man told me cunts were useful

[16-Feb-19 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not exactly.... Notarizations don't always happen every 5 blocks especially on pos chains

[16-Feb-19 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Enjoy genie lol

[16-Feb-19 06:00 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 enjoy the time

don't forget your 🛀

[16-Feb-19 06:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in the end I "cheated" and just used cp and rm 🤣

[16-Feb-19 06:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Make files are the worst things in the world lol

[16-Feb-19 06:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only because they are a virus and pull info out of their ass 😛

[16-Feb-19 06:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to mess with komodods one to make labs possible early on... Once I worke d out what the problem actually was in the code and fixed it, it made all kinds of cool things possible with ease

[16-Feb-19 06:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, anything that self-replicates against the user's will and does something other than what it's told is pure evil

[16-Feb-19 06:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181

@LabsAssistant 
Test of the main chain is live. Please do `./stop.sh` `./start.sh` to remove CFEKULTRADEAD and start notarizing LABSTH and start getting paid. 😃 
The airdrop was done, please check it was valid. Treat this chain as you would the real launch, ie, please mine and stake it like it has value. It will only last a few daysor a week to make 100% sure coin emission is correct.  For now there are no chains in its cluster. We will add those later, once this is confirmed to be working.

[16-Feb-19 10:36 AM] CHMEX#0686
staked4 was airdroped to this chain?

[16-Feb-19 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[16-Feb-19 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
At least I have mine, so it should be there for eveyone else, unless hte airdrop was wrong

[16-Feb-19 10:37 AM] CHMEX#0686
ok I have 0 but will check again

yes also the notary address does not have funds...

[16-Feb-19 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181

` 576c53082d8d09762d214991d38ff9d5c8fdb9e77e67fbfe2844db3a407253db` 
is the funding tx that my node received... it looks like all notaries were paid

[16-Feb-19 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wait.... wallet filter lol its wasnt 1 coin

[16-Feb-19 10:43 AM] Alright#0419
I think there is a bug in listunspent

[16-Feb-19 10:43 AM] Alright#0419
ahhhh didn't read what you said joker

[16-Feb-19 10:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`-mintxvalue=<amount in sats>` you can start the daemon with this to set it lower than 1 coin

[16-Feb-19 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need to make sure that coinbase is paid with that filter too... or maybe make it optional to activate rather then mandatory .... if we are getting attacked then just restart with it on full lock down mode

[16-Feb-19 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its more there just to stop people bothering to tx flood notary nodes because it would no longer do anything... don't actually need to use it I dont think.

[16-Feb-19 10:50 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I am sure there is a bug in listunspent
I imported my privkey - balance shows, but can't list it to split it.

[16-Feb-19 10:51 AM] CrisF#3405
I also had `listunspent` trouble.

[16-Feb-19 10:51 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r if you have coins, please just do another sendmany >1 coin

[16-Feb-19 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[16-Feb-19 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
@Bar_F1sh_Rel it's not a bug

[16-Feb-19 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
just a feature we forgot about 😛

[16-Feb-19 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
notary addresses don't add utxos to the wallet if they're <1 coin

[16-Feb-19 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its alittle more complicated than that... but something along those lines ...

[16-Feb-19 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sent another 2 coins from my staking node

[16-Feb-19 10:55 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
is LABSTH 0br - or will mining work?

[16-Feb-19 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its the params the main chain will use... so it has an increaseingf block reward to block 1000 (main will be 10800)

[16-Feb-19 10:56 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
OK - 'cause mining is either netting zero dust at the mo - or my daemon is borked

[16-Feb-19 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its mining dust...

[16-Feb-19 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its about 1.6 coins per block atm ...

[16-Feb-19 10:59 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Mine is mining zero - litteraly

[16-Feb-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that doesnt seem right lol is this on notary node?

[16-Feb-19 10:59 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
no - staked repo

[16-Feb-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok getting another node up to check this... I am staking and its working.

[16-Feb-19 11:00 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I had notifications for blocks 298, 305, 306, 323, 327

[16-Feb-19 11:00 AM] Alright#0419
it should be mining dust

[16-Feb-19 11:01 AM] Alright#0419
do `getrawtransaction <txid> 1` on the coinbases you mined

[16-Feb-19 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its about 1.5 coins atm on my staking node

[16-Feb-19 11:01 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
plus some invalids

[16-Feb-19 11:01 AM] Alright#0419
shouldn't be 0 if they were after block 128

[16-Feb-19 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
are you sure its on latest update ? If it doens thave the last commit then the block reward will be zero

[16-Feb-19 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
becasue its a LABSxx... chain

[16-Feb-19 11:01 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
did start about an hour ago

[16-Feb-19 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah please make sure to check for updates and then resync it

[16-Feb-19 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think if your mining less than you can it does anything bad, you just wont get any coins

[16-Feb-19 11:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it notarized 😄

listunspent bug man

[16-Feb-19 11:09 AM] Alright#0419
when ./start.sh starts a chain for the first time, listunspent is empty until restarted

[16-Feb-19 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What is this listunspent bug ? nobpody has told me aout it.... they only show if they are confirmed

[16-Feb-19 11:09 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I will try a shutdown, delete dirs and resync - but later - kidsd have a dentist appointment now

[16-Feb-19 11:09 AM] Alright#0419
or possibly until reindex

[16-Feb-19 11:10 AM] CHMEX#0686
ok I try

[16-Feb-19 11:10 AM] Alright#0419
ty

[16-Feb-19 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wait .... mine is using the staker script so its combining the utxos from the block ... not suign the wallet... maybe thats why I cant see this issue.. Will try ot PoW mine in a minute
