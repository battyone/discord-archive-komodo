for example, ann's keep it simple

`this node <my Radd> is not official notary numnotaries.20`

[24-May-19 06:14 AM] Exile13#4458
does that Radd need a balance to operate correctly?

Hi @Exile13, as smk762 says 👆 
Funds are generally sent to your addresses when chains are added.  You can also fund yourself or mine a little.  `tipbot` can provide a good source of KMD.  Notarizations don't require much in the way of funding.  Even 1 KMD will last a long time.

dafuq is a gitlab and why do I need to signup to see anything?

[24-May-19 10:27 AM] gcharang#6833
haha, it's an alternative to github and provided priv repos for free even before github did it 😜

@LabsAssistant  @dimxy @Exile13  @PHBA2061  @anyone else interested on being included

Hi,
I believe I have received everyone's permission to have your names listed as participants in KMDLabs on the website `https://kmdlabs.com/who/`.
 I would like to put your names on the KMDLabs ANN.  
This announcement will be put on Bitcointalk and possibly used in other social media etc.
Could you please write a short comment (eg, My name on ANN is ok) if I can add your name.
Sorry for the hassle.
Thanks!!

Ok joker's around, going to get started in about an hour and a half

[24-May-19 01:19 PM] Alright#0419
Not starting the chain then, good amount of prep to do

[24-May-19 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ok on my end, I need to know who has new keys and who doesnt. I assume all ppl with new keys have submit PR? If this is the case its NP.... The only thing Im worried about is that LABS/komodo is no longer up to date with KMD, and Im still trying to get thigns in a stable state before the hard fork...

[24-May-19 01:20 PM] Alright#0419
Look at PRs

[24-May-19 01:20 PM] Alright#0419
I'll change mine myself

[24-May-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-May-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know whats happened, but all your PRs are saying a heap of shit changed... may need to manaylly change some keys... conflicts everywhere

[24-May-19 01:29 PM] jorian#4555
whut

[24-May-19 01:29 PM] jorian#4555
they are literally 1 line code changes

[24-May-19 01:30 PM] jorian#4555
@Alright said to change only in the first section, maybe that messed stuff up?

[24-May-19 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I reverted some coimmits the other day that fucked with things...

[24-May-19 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure why but every PR says 9 files changed

[24-May-19 01:32 PM] jorian#4555
i'm not a git guru, but that sounds like something's wrong

[24-May-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[24-May-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
too many branches of KMD atm, im geting very confused what goes where...

[24-May-19 01:32 PM] jorian#4555
maybe that's the problem

[24-May-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ideally everything was ready before all this happened... but I keep gettin asked to do more stuff...

Please each confirm this is correct, until I have  DM from each person in this list confirming the key we cannot launch.

Also we need some seed IP's at the top there... Mine should stay the same. So it will work without any others, but mroe than 1 is much better.

[24-May-19 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
changing mine

[24-May-19 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r mine is good
Are we still on a 2 month update schedule? if so, you can add 149.28.246.230 as a seed; if longer then adding mine as seed would have to wait because I'll be upgrading in July

[24-May-19 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i'll stick as seed not sure it matters if they work or not, but a variation ratehr than mine 4 times has to be safer. 😃

@blackjok3r are all 8 ips in notaries_staked.h current?

[24-May-19 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
most are. I just replaced mine with ones posted here... not sure if they are even used for anything, but they will need to be in the start.sh stuff aswell, so seems a good place to keep them.

[24-May-19 03:09 PM] Alright#0419

[24-May-19 03:09 PM] Alright#0419

[24-May-19 03:10 PM] Alright#0419
just realized RCTEST is ac_cc=100

[24-May-19 03:10 PM] Alright#0419

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator we're going to stop notarizing CFEK chains, not sure if that affects you or not

[24-May-19 03:24 PM] Alright#0419
we can start notarizing them again with separate CFEK cluster next week

[24-May-19 03:25 PM] Alright#0419
just so everyone is on the same page, CFEK is being separated so we can add/remove people without affecting real cluster

[24-May-19 03:25 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I can migrate oracle data if needed.
