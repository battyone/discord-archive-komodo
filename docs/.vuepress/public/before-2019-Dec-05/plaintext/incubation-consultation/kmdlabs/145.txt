[05-Dec-18 11:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Will do.

[05-Dec-18 12:00 PM] CMaurice#1685
lotsa `Connection refused (111)` and `No route to host (113)` s

[05-Dec-18 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats noraml ... I dont know how to fix it ... likely think removing the print is the go at this point

[05-Dec-18 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the daeoon is pulling all the seed nodes for KMD and tyring to connect to the  on ALL chains

[05-Dec-18 12:01 PM] Alright#0419
those are from KMD DNS seeder

[05-Dec-18 12:01 PM] Alright#0419
please don't comment that out

[05-Dec-18 12:01 PM] Alright#0419
it's a useful print otherwise

[05-Dec-18 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when it should NOT do that ... seed are meant ot activate if htere are no peers .. but someone has disabled that on KMD for some reason

[05-Dec-18 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and I cant find where... even removig all the peers fromt he source code completely still didnt stop it

[05-Dec-18 12:02 PM] Alright#0419
remove the DNS seeders

[05-Dec-18 12:02 PM] Alright#0419
delete peers.dat

[05-Dec-18 12:02 PM] Alright#0419
it stops it

[05-Dec-18 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
are you sure ?

[05-Dec-18 12:03 PM] Alright#0419
Pretty sure

[05-Dec-18 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will do that right now...

[05-Dec-18 12:03 PM] Alright#0419
there are DNS seeds

[05-Dec-18 12:03 PM] Alright#0419
like normal URLs somewhere

[05-Dec-18 12:03 PM] Alright#0419
you can comment out the whole line

[05-Dec-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I remeber testing this on notary node a-team a while back trying to selectively choose nodes I was connected too to make some kind of "collsuion" but no matter what Shossains node was connected to mine 100% of the time, even with the port closed, DNS disabled, and peers.dat removed.

[05-Dec-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in the end I had to firewall my whole node to stop it

[05-Dec-18 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```void ThreadDNSAddressSeed()
{
    return;```

[05-Dec-18 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that should do it

[05-Dec-18 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I bet it doesnt though

[05-Dec-18 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its called somehere else thats not called DNS

[05-Dec-18 12:20 PM] zatJUM#9924
update done!

[05-Dec-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Great ... seems to be going better than I amagined so far... I think a lot has to do with the invlaid migrate txs expiring from the mempool

Seems to be a problem mostly effecting the miner ...

[05-Dec-18 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am still getting crashes

[05-Dec-18 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181

what error

[05-Dec-18 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
15 mins found possible fix

[05-Dec-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  I am reaslly sorry but you all need to update again... if you already updated
`./start.sh`should be fine but maybe do stop first to be safer

[05-Dec-18 01:16 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Lol. Mine is still building.

[05-Dec-18 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its a tiny change to the code

[05-Dec-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
some fool commented out the Coin Import validation functions at some stage

just a `start.sh` worked on notary node

[05-Dec-18 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
resyncing mining nodes... we might be back in business soon.

I should have seen it before .. but IU didnt expect it to be such a stupid bug such as code being commented out ... I am used to james code, which is full of debug prints comented out I guess lol

having to syc a wallet with 20,000 txs takes a LONG time

[05-Dec-18 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
there's a cure for that:
don't carry 20k UTXOs :trollface:

[05-Dec-18 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I need it to try and find out why the wallets corrupt... with that many it happens very fast

[05-Dec-18 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
startgint to tink its just a wallet problem at a low level

[05-Dec-18 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and ti was just never supposed to have that many txs in it

[05-Dec-18 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in which case ... I need to rethink my entire staking strategy now

[05-Dec-18 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to make it reliable

the chains are syncing from somwher ehere

[05-Dec-18 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
longestchain cannot populate until it sees a block

[05-Dec-18 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and there are no miners atm

[05-Dec-18 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so it will always be 0

novel thought: build a migrator and get away from a 95 year old version of bdb for the wallet?

[05-Dec-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am thinking about it ...

[05-Dec-18 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We should be pretty safe to build komodod with no wallet

[05-Dec-18 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but that disables staking totally

[05-Dec-18 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in the current implementation

[05-Dec-18 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and get rid of BDB all thgether

[05-Dec-18 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
why does the wallet use it ...

[05-Dec-18 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
levelDB is used everywhere else and seems very fast

[05-Dec-18 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with addressindex and all that ...

[05-Dec-18 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can grab an address with 100k utxo in no time

[05-Dec-18 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
all the cc contracts use that ... bypass wallet all together

[05-Dec-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`and get rid of BDB all thgether`
Well, as much shit as I give Core abount never having done it in 8 years, I don't think that's a "short order" task

[05-Dec-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not

[05-Dec-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its close to impossible

[05-Dec-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh

[05-Dec-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
which is why no body has done it ...

[05-Dec-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
however

[05-Dec-18 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you could make a new wallet hacked out of addressindex pretty fast ... creating txs becomes a but harder ... but he CCutils have  most fo the required code
