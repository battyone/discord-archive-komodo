thh code has 
LABS  as the chain that is allowed to make coins
chains starting with LABS cannot create any coins, (exept notary pay, and maybe some contract liek bounties) 
CFEK, no special rules

[21-Mar-19 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and TEST

[21-Mar-19 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to test params, becasue the debug.log floods million of conncction refused prints wihtout you declaring a chain a staked chain

[21-Mar-19 07:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, to confirm, there is no LAB, and Labs (the platform) and projects and test chains will all share the LABS coin prefix.

[21-Mar-19 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, all the chain are in the cluster as far as I was aware. And CFEK is for testing before adding to the cluster

[21-Mar-19 07:46 AM] CrisF#3405
(Apart from TEST and CFEK)

[21-Mar-19 07:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
TEST is just to test params work

[21-Mar-19 07:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We can change stuff... but it seems my tired solution was abandoned

[21-Mar-19 07:47 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok thanks!

[21-Mar-19 07:47 AM] CrisF#3405
Will TEST be also used by projects or only by Labs to test params?

[21-Mar-19 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no its just for conveniance, I got sick of trying to reead debug.log that spammed constantly connection refused

[21-Mar-19 07:49 AM] CrisF#3405
Should I write it in then?

[21-Mar-19 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
could even leave it out, its just there to test things without getting spammed with prints, not rerally important

[21-Mar-19 07:50 AM] CrisF#3405
OK, yeah that sounds the best.  Not write it up.

[21-Mar-19 07:50 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks!

[21-Mar-19 07:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Alright, If you haven't already done this, could you please look into it when you have a chance?
```d) burn that amount on LABS main chain - I can write a guide on how to do this with oraclesdata when need be(Alright)```

[21-Mar-19 07:53 AM] CrisF#3405
Or is that an RPC now?

[21-Mar-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think he did it by making a custom daemon for each chain, so its been also abandonded

[21-Mar-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we can easily just use a burntx though ...

[21-Mar-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but need to think about it. we can even have a CC address you can send to that is never spendable

[21-Mar-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all that matters is that the supply is burnt

[21-Mar-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how that is done, we dont really know until we try and do it

[21-Mar-19 07:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, that might be useful for documentation (the burn CC address)

[21-Mar-19 07:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, I'll get it down as it stood at last checking and then it can be revised.

[21-Mar-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah there are a few ways to do it. I still haevnt had time to try making any CCs so I dont really know how to do it.

[21-Mar-19 07:57 AM] CrisF#3405
This is about basics of using Labs, so no rush yet.

[21-Mar-19 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  Please update and DM me when you ahev done so. 
I disabled the sledgehammer, I dont think it needs it, and im 99% sure tis cauysing the -26. I cant work out why, maybe some nodes are on some buggy build. But 100% what is happening is its mixing up utxos and inserting spent utxos from previous rounds into current rounds. There doesnt appear to be a way for me to add acheck that the block hash is the same, so really all we can do, is remove the slegdehammer so each round ends before a new one starts.

[21-Mar-19 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its either this or the fetching of pubkeys from the daemon. Becasue mainnet isnt having any problems.

with the ridiuclous range of MoMoM komodod is now using, the iguana sledgehammer isnt required any mroe. Its only making more issues

and there is the baggage claim as a backup in case of extremely rare failure

[21-Mar-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
at some point we need to verify that the baggage claim process does work, so we probably need to attack the migrations and cause lost luggage

[21-Mar-19 08:27 AM] ca333#0118
@blackjok3r do you by any chance have a script to fund all notaries?

[21-Mar-19 08:27 AM] ca333#0118
(KMD NNs)

[21-Mar-19 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not exactly. For LABS notries I created `komodo-cli getnotarysendmany` but it only works for labs era and pubkeys

{Reactions}
💯 

[21-Mar-19 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
shouldnt be hard to extend it to KMD

[21-Mar-19 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just needs to ppoint to another array of pubkeys

luckily I hadn't wandered off for 🍽 yet

[21-Mar-19 08:33 AM] ca333#0118
thanks @blackjok3r - will merge this feature to KMD

[21-Mar-19 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its already there, its just uses LABS keys ....

[21-Mar-19 08:34 AM] ca333#0118
ok i see - basically just using kmd NN net pubkeys array instead. awesome!

`notaries_STAKED[era]` -> `Notaries_elected1`

[21-Mar-19 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the notaries elected could be made a 3 dimensional array liek the staked ones are aswell.. But thats not really something I wanted to try and change.

[21-Mar-19 08:37 AM] CrisF#3405
btw, we need a few 2~3 line testimonials for the KMDLabs website.  Anyone interested?

[21-Mar-19 08:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Something like this ```"They have extended their hands to help other community projects without conditions. Like KMDICE, they helped us get KMDICE to a very efficient state when we first started the chain. KMDLabs has a lot of future for sure."``` but shorter is ok too.🙏

[21-Mar-19 08:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator , but I don't think we can write the testimonials.  Need someone from outside who can comment on the project.

@CrisF I use a dirty hack to burn coins in an `oraclesdata` transaction

[21-Mar-19 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
problem with the hack is that it's truly truly a hack, you can't make custom OP_RETURN amounts with CC transactions as they all use the same function

{Reactions}
👌 

[21-Mar-19 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Might be able to now, as the new RPC is using it I think

[21-Mar-19 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for burn tx... but im not 100% sure on that

[21-Mar-19 08:57 AM] Alright#0419
does it spend a CC utxo?

[21-Mar-19 08:57 AM] Alright#0419
any tx that does uses FinalizeCCTx and it has a hardcoded 0 for OP_RETURN amount

[21-Mar-19 08:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure I just saw it used somehwer for token migrate

[21-Mar-19 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe that doesnt burn any coins though ... just the token

[21-Mar-19 09:00 AM] Alright#0419
only reason I was using oracles was because it was easy

[21-Mar-19 09:00 AM] Alright#0419
no reason we have to

[21-Mar-19 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my idea was some kind of CC address we can submit data to, like oracles that contains the chain params and send hte coins there

[21-Mar-19 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if they match then chain can start... seems notary pay isnt going to be able to be included in anything though lol.

[21-Mar-19 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
becasue its random

[21-Mar-19 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
serialize params, put them in OP_RETURN with block 1 amount

[21-Mar-19 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
is really simple, i was just hoping we could use oracles

[21-Mar-19 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
not easy to use oracles though

[21-Mar-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems like an extremely easy CC to make. Even mayvbe easier than fauct, because you never  have to spend anything

[21-Mar-19 09:18 AM] Alright#0419
Oh right

[21-Mar-19 09:18 AM] Alright#0419
just burn in a CC vout

[21-Mar-19 09:18 AM] Alright#0419
that is unspendable

[21-Mar-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[21-Mar-19 09:18 AM] Alright#0419
that is dead simple

[21-Mar-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and an RPC that fetches them all

[21-Mar-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
asume thats just like any list RPC that exists already

[21-Mar-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it ever got too full... we can change the address or something

[21-Mar-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
have some minimum burn amount to prevent ppl spamming it

[21-Mar-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pushed update for migratv4 script so it works with the new RPC returns

[21-Mar-19 10:25 AM] gt#2812
