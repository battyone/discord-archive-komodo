[24-Nov-18 10:35 AM] Alright#0419
🤔

[24-Nov-18 10:35 AM] CMaurice#1685
you shouldn't mine and notarise on same machine, right?

[24-Nov-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[24-Nov-18 10:35 AM] Alright#0419
do not

[24-Nov-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dont

[24-Nov-18 10:35 AM] CMaurice#1685
heh, kk

[24-Nov-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not a great idea... you need special scripts to celan up the mined funds

[24-Nov-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its far easier to just not do it ...

[24-Nov-18 10:35 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, thanks 😃

[24-Nov-18 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and staking should use its own node ..

[24-Nov-18 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a working pool

[24-Nov-18 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
smk siad his is up

[24-Nov-18 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if hes using the mod I gave him it will work just without pool fee

[24-Nov-18 10:36 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i think i should sleep now

[24-Nov-18 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
I'll put a GPU on it in a moment

[24-Nov-18 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181

@Alright i have CFEKLAMEDUCKS notarization

[24-Nov-18 10:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you should remove pool fee, byt maybe it will work with it there, I never tested it and hthe changes to take a fee that way, are in the merge that I couldnt do

[24-Nov-18 10:38 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
10 print "computergenie is a cranky old man";

[24-Nov-18 10:39 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[24-Nov-18 10:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so empty "reward_recipients" in pool config?

[24-Nov-18 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You may have to .. but maybe it doesnt matter at all, as its just ignored totally by hte startum...

[24-Nov-18 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it needs to be removed, the pool wouldnt even start is my guess

[24-Nov-18 10:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
disaclecb: true is in coin config 👌

[24-Nov-18 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean you just cannot use it at all in that version

[24-Nov-18 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cool should send some hash and see it its paying .. im only cou mine on my pool and its working with 1% fee too atm just fine.

[24-Nov-18 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  can you put mini on smks pool to test it ?

[24-Nov-18 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  you need to force update of node_modules

[24-Nov-18 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wipe it and npm install again

[24-Nov-18 10:59 AM] zatJUM#9924
@blackjok3r Why did you use ```printf "%12.8f"``` in stats line 70, that's were the error is coming from I think, but still wondering why it isn't broken on another device

[24-Nov-18 10:59 AM] Alright#0419
