um, wondering if there are some ports I should be forwarding as my server is behind NAT

[26-Oct-18 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
17775 is the only port needed to be open dude

[26-Oct-18 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Basic multiple blocks code to extract is done... no error checks yet, but I was able to send `marketmaker` into a blockchain, and then extract it and run it. üòÑ

[26-Oct-18 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doing `diff marketmaker marketmaker2` returned nothing.... so files are identical.

[26-Oct-18 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am getting close where other people can start testing this btw... because I know exactly what to do I assume there will be bugs if things are not done exactly correctly.

[26-Oct-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will be having 2 days off from tomorrow... might get a few hours to work on it tomorrow. Will try and get a readme up for others to test tonight before bed.

@0x03 you said you were keen to test this.

[26-Oct-18 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Moving from adding files to a stream seems trivial aswell. just requires diffrent input scripts.

[26-Oct-18 02:42 PM] 0x03#8822
thanks for the info, lets see if i can get to test it tonight

@blackjok3r can you let me know when you have pushing and retrieving arbitrary files working

[26-Oct-18 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
I wanted to try pushing and retrieving a STAKED4 bootstrap

[26-Oct-18 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its already working but I have a bug ... the RPC should be returnig the blockheight for the first TXID so you cna seek directly to the first block and retreive the file

Just about have the chat dapp ready for user testing

[26-Oct-18 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It was working, I am thinking maybe to just return the block hash,

[26-Oct-18 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and then the dapp can just get the heght from getblock

[26-Oct-18 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems a lot more reliable

[26-Oct-18 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181

When code gets complicated with long if else staments... its easy to make something that works intermittantly

[26-Oct-18 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
at least its working... Guess I should do the readme so @Alright  can test it.

The only script not on git is the TxBlaster activation script ... but I will remove the txblaster parts so its just for this and push it. üòÉ

oh wait.... the script that sends data does not itterate in chuncks yet ... thats not going to work for what you want to do üò¶

various scripts we have developed on STAKED so far, none of these are perfect and some might not even work. use them as examples of what you can do. - StakedChain/PoS_scripts

There is no error check in the sending script that the data your about to send is in the right order, but for testing this wont matter at all

[26-Oct-18 05:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if something fails it should just stop sending

[26-Oct-18 05:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This is not suituable for live streaming at this stage, but it lays the foundations to do that. Will be interesting to see how fast you can push a very large file through it. Also there is no mempool checks, likely that should be added into the send script, to wait adding to queue if mempool is over X size.

[26-Oct-18 05:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
readme is poor, but Im sure @Alright  can work it out.

I am starting up a clean install of the sender stuff on a VPS in Sydney and will take a screen capture video of sending a reasonably large file to my house in WA.

First go at STAKED streamer over real internet!
Seems there might have been a small chunk of the file missing off the end, I need to investigate, however all the data in the TGZ extracted and was received ...

[27-Oct-18 04:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Worked for the most part, file either had some extra data at the end, or was missing a little bit, I am 99% sure thats just the python script I used to extract the data as sending smaller files didnt have that issue.

[27-Oct-18 01:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
@blackjok3r That was awesome! Watching it on the explorer was crazy! So other than ensuring the EoF is not lost of corrupted... is there a significant performance hit on the end users node to display the incoming txes as the original file type, like a video stream?

[27-Oct-18 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No its just the script I used needs all the stream to be there so it can find the end. Its designed to an app can use block notify to call the get data function

Tried a fresh server, pool open - no more crocs. http://pool.cryptocartography.io/

[27-Oct-18 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Once it sees one block with data it knows the first block and tx.. And can pull all data to assemble the file

[27-Oct-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The RPCs are very low level, I left most of it up to the app using the calls... All it takes is hex string

[27-Oct-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its up to the app to give it what it wants and then use it on the other end

[27-Oct-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Wouldn't mind trying a stream of a few GB later on with more nodes

@blackjok3r  `once I can figure out how to remove the pubkeys from the source code` <-- i got something for you relevant to that

[27-Oct-18 03:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r i have factored out notary node addresses to their own header file

[27-Oct-18 03:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
that allows external coins to seemlessly hardfork upgrade to new NN's each year, buy simply copying a file from komodo.git into their repo

[27-Oct-18 03:34 PM] dukeleto#7326

[27-Oct-18 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
but each years pubkeys need to be there so it can sync KMD

[27-Oct-18 03:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
`src/komodo_notaries.h` is the new file

[27-Oct-18 03:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c it contains all years addresses, the header file

[27-Oct-18 03:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
and actually, only pubkeys and addrs on KMD, addrs on that chain are dynamically generated now

[27-Oct-18 03:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
so yes, the coin updating KMD notaries must change the name of 1 variable in their code, in addition to copying the new file

[27-Oct-18 03:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
I hope that is not too much

[27-Oct-18 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, with a timestamp range check for each set of pubkeys

[27-Oct-18 03:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
the goal is to avoid having people manually changing NN pubkeys in a file, when they could just copy a known-good + trusted file from KMD

[27-Oct-18 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, good to do that

[27-Oct-18 03:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, your code uses timestamps to choose which set of notary pubkeys to use

[27-Oct-18 03:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
if sha256(komodo_notaries.h) is the same value in latest KMD (i will have to send a PR to kmd) and an external coin, that is a good indication that all NN pubkeys are correct, nothing has been tampered with or accidentally broken. If they are not, something is wrong. It feels like a nice kind of sanity check to have.

[27-Oct-18 04:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I already made functions that separate timestamps there is a definable gap between each era and it was tested working. What I need to do is be able to fetch the arrays these functions use from an oracle and load them into the deamon, guess it would fetch it then restart before syncing. This allows adding an extra timestamp, or just a whole new set of keys for a new chain or chains, without having to recompile the code..

[27-Oct-18 04:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe I'm over over thinking it, as usual and I'm sure a simple solution will become apparent when required

[28-Oct-18 08:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
50% staked means 50% of the notary nodes mined KMD goes to staked... and the operator gets the other half... likey this wont be exact and something like what a-team used, where server costs are taken out first so the node pay for itself is the way to go.

[28-Oct-18 08:40 AM] CMaurice#1685

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  welcome aboard ... there are many ways to run a notary... if you dont want to ahve to do anything, you need to talk to @Deleted User  about his lazynode...
