if not, it's them?

[21-Mar-19 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but because of sapling... iguana cannot acrtualyl detect bad sigs inside of itself. I weas told to work with @Decker  if we were going to ry and make the  "bad sig banner"

[21-Mar-19 03:40 AM] Alright#0419
I'm not sure if my nodes crashed or were never started properly

[21-Mar-19 03:40 AM] Alright#0419
have a feeling they crashed though

[21-Mar-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine are not crashed, if anyone notices that they did crash I really need a backtrace

[21-Mar-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was honestly surprised that the ac_nk stuff didnt cause more issues... It chagned hwo the equihash hashing algo works but with just one exception it was backwards compatible... Didnt think that it would nbe perfect

[21-Mar-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant sorry for the tag, but could you please check to see if your nodes crashed?

too late

[21-Mar-19 03:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
already stopped

[21-Mar-19 03:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
wait for restart?

[21-Mar-19 03:44 AM] Alright#0419
no crash though?

[21-Mar-19 03:44 AM] Alright#0419
it's fine smk, we'll know that you're the bad signer if it stops right now

[21-Mar-19 03:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
getinfo returned json fro KMD and ORKL

[21-Mar-19 03:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so assume was fine

[21-Mar-19 03:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
lemme know when to restart

[21-Mar-19 03:46 AM] Alright#0419
basically someone has a corrupted wallet on CFEKDIMXY4, this is causing notarizations to fail. We need to keep the network in this state to be able to detect bad signers in the future

[21-Mar-19 03:46 AM] Alright#0419
smk you can restart it, no worries

[21-Mar-19 03:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just got a replacement keyboard, last one wasn't letting shift key back up. forgot how nice responsive keys were 😄

[21-Mar-19 03:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
last one was shit on unboxing. keys unaligned or something, sometimes had to use brute force to press. Then they stopped coming back up

[21-Mar-19 03:49 AM] gt#2812
i had stopped mine because i hasn’t been getting notes for a few days

[21-Mar-19 03:49 AM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator buy a nice mechanical keyboard

[21-Mar-19 03:49 AM] Alright#0419
should last for years

[21-Mar-19 03:49 AM] Alright#0419
I've had mine for more than a decade

[21-Mar-19 03:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
had a nice mech before that but it was heavy AF, and I abused it by dropping too often

[21-Mar-19 03:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
feels like im tping 2x faster now 😄

[21-Mar-19 03:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just wanted responsive, backlit, lightweight. So I can type in dark and it doesnt break under its own weight when sliding off lap.

[21-Mar-19 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ok well we have 3 problems. Migrate script needs updating to work with RPC changes. Seems this si easy to fix, so I will do this first. 
2) iguana is having bad sig problems -25/26 errors, seems only on LABS so points to a deamon isssue rather than iguana itself/
3) the tokens need a size limit to prevent an import tx that cannot be spent being made.

[21-Mar-19 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ALL of the -26/25 are on KMD. So I thbink this is related to @gt's issue

[21-Mar-19 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Do you have any mor information that can help me?

[21-Mar-19 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
normally these errors come from a node trying to spend spent utxos

[21-Mar-19 04:19 AM] gt#2812
yes i believe that’s what likely happened

[21-Mar-19 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
have you tried a -rescan on KMD

[21-Mar-19 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[21-Mar-19 04:20 AM] gt#2812
i’m doing a reindex atm

[21-Mar-19 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems like maybe a wallet corruption issue to m... but its clearly happening to someone else too

[21-Mar-19 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or morethan 1 person. I have a way to find who is doing it .. but I need to remeber how to use it, its been a very long time since these errors have been happening

[21-Mar-19 04:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok I still ahve all my scripts so setting up a log of whos nodes are submitting spent sigs. At least we can find out who is doing it and direct them to try and fix it... still dont know what coud have caused this though :/

[21-Mar-19 04:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
A way to detect and ban nodes doing this would be the optimal solution, but because of sapling this might be hard.

aren t those linked to the asks of a restart ? I mean everyone won t restart the node and iguana at same time so wouldn t that be linked with successive restarts ?

`DIMXY4` is notarizing for me again.

Seeing the occasional ```>>>>>>>>>>> KMD dpow_sendrawtransaction ({"result":null,"error":{"code":-26,"message":"16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element)"},"id":"jl777"}

I started the logger

[21-Mar-19 04:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is only a few things it can be .. I added code that feteches `getiguanajson` at the start of every round for the minsigs and pubkeys

[21-Mar-19 04:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That is the 1 diffrence we have copared to mainnet

[21-Mar-19 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe its not updating the pubkeys correctly... But I think rouldns would fail at an earlier stage if the keys were wrong

[21-Mar-19 04:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All the errors are on KMD, and there were a LOT of them earlier ... All my script is doing is seeing a few seconds after the attmepted notarization which node has a spent utxo inside this transaction. Technically there shouldnt be any pent utxo, but there could be, if the wallet is corrupted, or the lock and unlock utxo isnt working correctly. 
Or nothing will show up spent, in which case the error is somehting else.

[21-Mar-19 04:59 AM] CrisF#3405
Is there anything we need to do for this, or is the logging all being done on your end?

[21-Mar-19 04:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my node logs it all

[21-Mar-19 04:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181

While you're sorting out that I'll be working on the `How Labs Works` page when I have a chance.
Done a little there, but needs a lot.

[21-Mar-19 05:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll just leave this loggin away, hopefully a reindex fixed gt's problems and its all ok.. Not sure what could have caused this though, its a little concerning that it happened at all.

[21-Mar-19 05:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going to fix migrate script next. dimxy will test token migrates. Once they are confirmed working, I will add tokens to the migrate script

[21-Mar-19 05:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then we need some kind of limit on burn tx size, that wont be that easy 😦

Won't that make it more difficult to track down the source though?

What was it?

[21-Mar-19 06:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its starting multiple dpows for the same block height

[21-Mar-19 06:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then mixing them up

[21-Mar-19 06:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sending the wrong sigs to the wrong place

[21-Mar-19 06:31 AM] CrisF#3405
How is it determined who will initiate a dpow?

it doesnt really work like that

[21-Mar-19 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
definatly seems like thats what its doing though, as I get some nota with every singl input spoent

[21-Mar-19 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
indicating that a finished round 's utxos are being inserted to a round thats in progress

[21-Mar-19 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The easy fix is to disable the sledgehammer ...

[21-Mar-19 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Which doesnt seem to really be doing a lot, its protecting a 1 in a million edge case

[21-Mar-19 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and if it causes nota to fail, then its not needed.

Hi, I'd like to confirm that this has been decided regarding ```The chain name must begins with 'LABS' or 'LAB'?. eg. LABSXXXX```with ```LAB for Labs 'official' work chains (ie, LABMETA), and LABS for cluster, project chains```

[21-Mar-19 07:41 AM] CrisF#3405
meaning a Labs oracle chain might be `LABORKL` and an oracle chain made by a project would be `LABSORKL`
