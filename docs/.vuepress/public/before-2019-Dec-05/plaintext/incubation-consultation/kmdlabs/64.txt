[02-Nov-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can try the curl command from inside that scrip before if applies jq filters

[02-Nov-18 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[02-Nov-18 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181

but I will check it out i the morenig anyway

[02-Nov-18 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe its not respecting branches

[02-Nov-18 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cant remember

[02-Nov-18 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181

mine was just crahsing out constantly

[02-Nov-18 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess is just mine though

[02-Nov-18 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt follow the advice and didnt use a clean server

[02-Nov-18 01:03 PM] CrisF#3405
Clean server?  Ooops...

[02-Nov-18 01:03 PM] CrisF#3405
Mine is still firing up.

[02-Nov-18 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Mine is a VM with like 5 users

[02-Nov-18 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its not happy about running there atm

[02-Nov-18 01:05 PM] CrisF#3405
Mine must have many on it too.  Worked well before.  I should have cleaned it up a bit.

[02-Nov-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Mine is broken because I am not folloing my onw instrauctions, I dont think there is any issue with StakedNoary its on my end

[02-Nov-18 01:15 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I didnt do fresh and go tit up ok. Trying to migrate is crashing CFEK (source) with an EOF error. Is this because of the different ac_supply value?

[02-Nov-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Soe chains are on diffrent versios ...

[02-Nov-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it shouldnt have to do with ac_supply value

[02-Nov-18 01:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
that makes sense...

[02-Nov-18 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is 2 chains on a diffrent branch

[02-Nov-18 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is a also a "fix" I pushed to master that might be making it crash

[02-Nov-18 01:20 PM] gcharang#6833
How do I know I am notarizing properly? -- any commands to run?

[02-Nov-18 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried to force it to look for more than 1 notarisaion in a block.... that might not be a good idea

[02-Nov-18 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not really

[02-Nov-18 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just llok at iguana prints'

[02-Nov-18 01:21 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah I was tryna send to diff versions

[02-Nov-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that should be ok

[02-Nov-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We are testing that for a reason

[02-Nov-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no reason they shouldnt migrate to each other

[02-Nov-18 01:21 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[02-Nov-18 01:21 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[02-Nov-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[02-Nov-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[02-Nov-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[02-Nov-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[02-Nov-18 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We may need to merge in more commits from higher up

[02-Nov-18 01:30 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
