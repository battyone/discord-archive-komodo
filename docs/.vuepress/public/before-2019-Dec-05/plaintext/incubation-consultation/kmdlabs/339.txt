@Alright @daemonfox yes you can indeed run Komodo on arm processors, so long as it is an arm v8/aarch64!! I'm doing it right now!

[19-Mar-19 03:38 PM] radix42#3743
see my personal site at https://janemercer.us for link to latest binary build and source

[19-Mar-19 03:39 PM] radix42#3743
and no, I don't care what the latest raspberry pi 3B+ says, it doesn't have all the crypto extensions licensed for arm v8 so get that thought out of your head right now 😃

[19-Mar-19 03:40 PM] radix42#3743
but anything that runs armbian and has enough ram should run my build

[19-Mar-19 03:40 PM] radix42#3743
I'm running it on a Debian Jessie instance in the cloud (where it got built!) and on my https://nodl.it that has a Rock64 processor

[19-Mar-19 03:42 PM] radix42#3743
I'd one of these rather than a pi: https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=7147
$45 for the 4 gig ram version, can run komodo unlike the latest Pi, and is compatible with all the pi cases and shields and accessories, @daemonfox !!!!

🆒

slap Armbian linux on that sucker and off to the races

[19-Mar-19 03:43 PM] radix42#3743
I'm running KMD and $ARRR on my arm v8 node right now

[19-Mar-19 03:44 PM] radix42#3743
AND bitcoin core and monero all at the same time, but that's on a nodl.it which is a very burly ARM64 box

`throwing his raspberry pi 3B+ to window`

[19-Mar-19 03:53 PM] radix42#3743
yeah, 'oh its got a Cortex A53, its 64 bit' and you fools didn't pay extra to ARM to license all the crypto shit in HW and your OS is still 32 bit and never activates what 64 bit features the processor DOES have

[19-Mar-19 03:54 PM] radix42#3743
just....just go and buy the best Rasp Pi form factor board from Pine64 you can afford is my advice to anyone wanting to build their own Komodo/z-anything nodes

[19-Mar-19 03:55 PM] radix42#3743
they'll never run on Raspberry Pi's unless/until some future one has a REAL 64 bit processor and OS, and competing boards that do are like 10 bucks more so *shrug emoji*

[19-Mar-19 03:55 PM] radix42#3743
I feel you @TonyL I only use my Pi's for hooking up to other HW shit

[19-Mar-19 03:56 PM] radix42#3743
if you have a few hundred bucks to drop on a pre-built one, go get a node from https://nodl.it omg the hardware is so sweet

[19-Mar-19 03:57 PM] Alright#0419
@radix42 do you know what KMDLabs is?

That sounds good

[19-Mar-19 03:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
yup... main thing is the M.2 NvMe

[19-Mar-19 03:59 PM] radix42#3743
Does it run armbian?

[19-Mar-19 03:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
It was demod running a Debian distro in a vid

[19-Mar-19 04:06 PM] radix42#3743
@daemonfox if you get one run Armbian on it, which is the only one of those OSes it supports that is guaranteed to bring it up in full 64 bit mode and run komodo

[19-Mar-19 04:06 PM] daemonfox#6136

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator can you check your ORKL nodes. It's stalled. Don't have any coins to stake

[19-Mar-19 04:09 PM] radix42#3743
armbian rules, it is a full 64 bit debian derivative for arm v8 chips

[19-Mar-19 04:11 PM] radix42#3743
if you have any questions for me trying to run on one you can always hit me up here via DM or on my message board at https://pirate.guru to share the knowledge 😃

what do i see: just the delta or all supply?

[19-Mar-19 05:36 PM] jorian#4555
i guess the delta

[19-Mar-19 05:36 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just the delta for the hour

Very nice @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator!

[20-Mar-19 08:50 AM] CrisF#3405
Any idea how I would get those to display on the website?

[20-Mar-19 08:54 AM] CrisF#3405
How difficult is it for you to create a new graph now?

[20-Mar-19 09:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
main issue is parsing the json, so it all depends on how it is formatted.

[20-Mar-19 09:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
though it can be formated in a friendly way when being writte to oracle unless you like making things a challenge

[20-Mar-19 09:19 AM] CrisF#3405
I seem to create a few challenges for myself, haha.

[20-Mar-19 09:35 AM] gt#2812

Hmm, what's happening with it?

[20-Mar-19 09:44 AM] gt#2812
have not enough people updated?

[20-Mar-19 09:46 AM] CrisF#3405
I've been notarizing. Just CFEKDIMXY4 seems stalled. Almost 11 hours now.

@blackjok3r Hi, the `false/empty top stack` error has shown up again.

[20-Mar-19 11:00 AM] CrisF#3405
@gt Have you not had a notarization on `any` chain?

[20-Mar-19 11:01 AM] CrisF#3405
Surprised if there aren't enough updated nodes after 4 days.

[20-Mar-19 11:05 AM] gt#2812
yeah, none. there’s something wrong with kmd on my end

[20-Mar-19 11:05 AM] gt#2812

[20-Mar-19 11:16 AM] CrisF#3405
hmm, what happened when you installed manually?

[20-Mar-19 11:17 AM] gt#2812
what do you mean? update?

[20-Mar-19 11:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, update.

[20-Mar-19 11:19 AM] gt#2812
no errors

[20-Mar-19 11:22 AM] CrisF#3405
I have tried to update (staked) komodo before manually before to.  (didn't help in that case).

mine are working but yes I see -25 and -26 werrors on LABS iguana tv ... not happening oon masin net same iguana build ... so its daemon side

[21-Mar-19 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This might giver us the oppertunity to write the bad sig detector and ban

[21-Mar-19 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
basically a single bad node can suubmit bad sigs (eitehr through wallet corruption) or on prupose

[21-Mar-19 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it slows down notarizations a LOT

[21-Mar-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had things made to log and detect who was doing this btw

[21-Mar-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it could take me a fair while to get it up and runing on LABS to find out the bad node in this case

[21-Mar-19 03:39 AM] Alright#0419
I'll just figure out how to make bad sigs and you detect me?

[21-Mar-19 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that doesnt really help me, there are already bad sigs

[21-Mar-19 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and I have a way to detect if they are spent

[21-Mar-19 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
using external bash script and a file log in iguana

[21-Mar-19 03:40 AM] Alright#0419
might be able to figure out who it is with firewall

[21-Mar-19 03:40 AM] Alright#0419
block someone, see if it continues
