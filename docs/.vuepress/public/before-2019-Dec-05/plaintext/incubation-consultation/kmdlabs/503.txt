left in mining and it still hit 90.... but it never crashed and is still on this morning

[29-Oct-19 12:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, are `master` and `utxocache` the only current non-dev branches we're running?

~~GPU mining was too dead for me to buy any of the 20s~~

i wouldnt waste the $400 premium of an RTX card on mining

[29-Oct-19 12:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
the RTX chip is just worthless to us

[29-Oct-19 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ASICs made that true, otherwise I likely would have replaced all of my 10s with 20s

updating the pool server and sorting out some test-keep vs junk and needed to know what stands where

[29-Oct-19 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Do we have any "standard deployment" of our AC explorers like for Komodo ACs (i.e., chainName.explorer.dexstats.info)?

[29-Oct-19 01:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
hmmm... id solo but the last few PoS64 coins i tried with your solo pool gave me trouble... RFOX worked though...

[29-Oct-19 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`solo pool gave me trouble`
let me know in #talk-mining what coins and I'll see what I can do (I know the DP pool works as expected)

[29-Oct-19 01:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
havent tried DP yet... ill give it another go oday for LAPS, DP and COMMOD see what I run into

I think it was ZEXO I tried with the older solo pool code...

I had LABS working

and KMD at one point

[29-Oct-19 01:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure if everything in there is pushed to the KMD-solo-mining repo (it's been a while)

[29-Oct-19 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and KMD at one point`
nearly everything I do works for KMD, itself, by default 😛

some things don't work for some chains (it just depends on when I wrote it) because I refuse to use joker's easy way (disablecb) 🤣

I'll be more spectator than on field likely, seems there's an atomicDEX stress test soon which I'm pretty involved with

[29-Oct-19 11:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
ohhh that looks fun too!

[29-Oct-19 11:21 PM] bishop#9773
Oh, I'm already planning on the atomicdex testing, just want to make sure that if the date is still the EOM that I'm on top of that as well.

who was using mylo's key?

[30-Oct-19 04:45 AM] Alright#0419
thought it was @And1_89 , no?

[30-Oct-19 04:50 AM] Alright#0419
ok, so @And1_89, you submitted a PR to replace dwy's old key, which is being dropped. You can submit a PR to change mylo's key(if you have it), but the dwy position is going to someone from the lottery because the dwy key was below the notarization count threshold

this seems to be the final set of keys for era 2

[30-Oct-19 05:13 AM] Alright#0419
I moved anyone who changed keys down in the list. If we keep doing this each time, we can see who has the oldest keys and remind them to change every so often

joker didn't like my idea for changing order of keys to show who hasn't changed their's lately 😅 is convinced the order needs to remain the same

No, no chage this time. I changed it previously so this one is good.

their key is in there.. once enough notaries restart iguana after the timestampo has past,  they can notarize

[30-Oct-19 09:49 AM] CrisF#3405
Great. Approx eta?

[30-Oct-19 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The way I set it, it should still notarize just fine if nobody restarts iguana... it just wont accep tthe new guys until everyone restarts with the new json

that assumes no keys that were changed continue to try to notarize....
