_can't build a daemon presently, but generally knows how to use one_ :troll_lol:

[04-Dec-19 04:22 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I think  I will send all funds out and delete wallet.dat file

[04-Dec-19 04:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
or is there a way to delete the 1000 addrsses with zero balance

[04-Dec-19 04:24 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
there's no selective "delete" function for key pairs that I'm aware of

[04-Dec-19 04:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
thanks

[04-Dec-19 04:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that has been a requested feature by a lot of people, but the general consensus was that it was a waste of time and could lead ot loss of funds if someone accidentlally deleted the wrong adddress, 
It doesnt reall matter if the wallet.dat is massive, just need to use it better 游땔

[04-Dec-19 04:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yesa is slow.... but there are ways around that

[04-Dec-19 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`if someone accidentlally deleted the wrong adddress`
agreed, I'd rather walk someone through a dump/copy/edit/import than breaking it to them that they cannot "undelete" a key pair that they didn't back up

[04-Dec-19 05:02 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Not actually sure how much keypairs (empty) impact (especially after a zap) considering that most bitcoin wallets have 100+ premade pairs hidden on first creation.

[04-Dec-19 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
a zap doesn't remove the pairs, just the txes and data associated to/with them

[04-Dec-19 05:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have wallets on LABS notary with well over 100k txns and 80,000 dust utxos, thigns work just fine. a rescan or zap on those chains takes many hours though 游땐

[04-Dec-19 05:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the rescan from height was the best thign I added I think, saved so many hours

[04-Dec-19 05:07 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I suppose I meant creating an address (mostly) doesn't actually make an address - just sets a flag on a premade hidden address. Unless you are creating specific addresses (mining specific characters or segid)

[04-Dec-19 05:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes thats how it works. When the wallet is created ther is X address added to it opn daemon load, uses them and refills as required. 
If you copy a wallet.dat from one node to another they will return the same addresses from `getnewaddress`

[04-Dec-19 05:24 PM] CMaurice#1685
fir the competition, perhaps it should be made clear where komodod should be built from, KMDLabs/komodo master branch? Nearer the time also fine

[04-Dec-19 05:24 PM] Alright#0419
anywhere

[04-Dec-19 05:24 PM] Alright#0419
it just runs it for a moment to generate keys then stops it

[04-Dec-19 05:25 PM] CMaurice#1685
oic, the daemon for staking will be another build documented at time of comp?

[04-Dec-19 05:26 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[04-Dec-19 05:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will have some updates that I need to test. Building without errors is pretty important, and some VMs work and others do not atm, tryign to nail it down.

[04-Dec-19 05:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems that it is the changes to the depends that do it. 
`git clean -fdx` 
and build.sh did the trick.

I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate. And I can picture us attacking that world because they'd never expect it.

Down to  65 addresses and 641 UTXOs - I feel naked

[04-Dec-19 05:50 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
got it all lined up ---thanks boys

[04-Dec-19 05:59 PM] CHMEX#0686
At 1000 LABS an UTXO not much naked at all

[04-Dec-19 06:00 PM] Alright#0419
1k coins per utxo is quite a bit

[04-Dec-19 06:01 PM] Alright#0419
will have much better results with 10x utxos and patience

[04-Dec-19 06:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
massive utxos and submit block faster than is allowed ... 游뱎

[04-Dec-19 06:03 PM] Alright#0419
many tiny utxos > a few large utxos

[04-Dec-19 06:03 PM] Alright#0419
tiny large obviously subjective there

[04-Dec-19 06:03 PM] Alright#0419
general rule is make as many utxos as possible that will mine within 1 month

[04-Dec-19 06:04 PM] Alright#0419
so make a shit load, check back a month later to see if any didn't stake. If any didn't, they're too small

[04-Dec-19 06:06 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
make 640 and if they don't stake in 3 days, buy more

[04-Dec-19 06:07 PM] Alright#0419
shouldn't really be getting any stakes the first couple days

[04-Dec-19 06:07 PM] Alright#0419
after an initial split I mean

[04-Dec-19 06:07 PM] CHMEX#0686
I was about to say they day you distrubte your 84k my share will go down

[04-Dec-19 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
other than cheat

[04-Dec-19 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
that's obvious

[04-Dec-19 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
find ways to cheat, win

[04-Dec-19 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
excluding someone just sending you coins from their stack

well I'll try, but not going to take any prizes if I do well

[04-Dec-19 06:31 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
my average  UTXO size is 100 LABS spread over 50,000 coins

[04-Dec-19 06:34 PM] Alright#0419
not bad

[04-Dec-19 06:34 PM] Alright#0419
I'll need up to a couple days to verify results at the end of this test

[04-Dec-19 06:34 PM] Alright#0419
need to verify no one cheated

[04-Dec-19 06:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if the code allows ppl to cheat then its a bug :troll_cool:

[04-Dec-19 06:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The new staker, post HF, should not be able to be cheated, except 2 plp teamin up and sending each other coins... unless I broke it, which is totally possible... happened before

[04-Dec-19 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
only way you can "cheat" in this comp is sending/receiving coins from another participant

[04-Dec-19 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
anything else is open game, break it as much as you can

[04-Dec-19 06:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hopefully I break it before comp starts 游땏

going to put a CFEK chain up on the cluster in a bit if I don't hear back from you

[04-Dec-19 07:32 PM] Markus#5464
what exactly is kmdlabs about?

[04-Dec-19 07:33 PM] Alright#0419
incentivising testing new features prior to deploying them

[04-Dec-19 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
also means it should always be cutting edge of the ecosystem

[04-Dec-19 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
we have a fungible cluster of chains. Can launch many chains that use LABS as the base coin

[04-Dec-19 07:34 PM] Markus#5464
Possible to be part of it or learn more about it?

[04-Dec-19 07:35 PM] Alright#0419
Sure you can be part of it, join this comp and stick around

[04-Dec-19 07:35 PM] Alright#0419
you can get a notary position in about a month via lottery

[04-Dec-19 07:35 PM] Markus#5464
Any specific requirements needed?

[04-Dec-19 07:37 PM] Alright#0419
willingness to learn

[04-Dec-19 07:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not really. Linux is kind of needed  unless you know lots about windows.

[04-Dec-19 07:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181

I started learning linux a few days ago, more cause i find it interesting and want to learn more and reminded myself that im sure kmdlabs use linux alot so it might fasten up things
