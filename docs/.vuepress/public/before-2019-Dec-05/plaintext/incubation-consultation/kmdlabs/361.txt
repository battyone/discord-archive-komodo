migrates seem good

[29-Apr-19 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sweet. Yeah I managed 2000 of them. Will try to make some updates to script today, hopefully add tokens. But I need to work out how to make the tokens first. I need to dig into tokens RPC for another job anyway, so this will be a good starting point.

[29-Apr-19 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
testing first token migrate, seems to be working, although creating the token is a bit strange, still not quite sure whats going on there. It seems all you need to do is add anything as "data" to tokencreate and it will create a token that you can export, regardless of its supply.

[29-Apr-19 05:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Example to create a token: 
This seems to create a token with `100000000` supply, but you can still send it. It will only send 1sat though, not up to speed on how tokens work. Maybe someone can check the docs on this if they have time? 
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKDRAGON tokencreate token 1 "a test token" "some non fungible data stuff"
./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKDRAGON sendrawtransaction 0400008085202f89015........... etc. Send the "hex" created from above step
```
To send the token, get the txid returned from sending the raw hex. Then run the migrate v4 script. 
Choose the source chain as the chain you created the token on. 
Choose a target chain.
Enter the txid of the token you created above. Called its tokenid.
Enter the destination pubkey, NOTE: pubkey not address!
Wait......

It all works, except getrawtransaction cannot decode the tx so it gets stuck waiting for confirm. Added exception for token migrate to skip this step, may or may not work...

@dimxy seems there needs to be a check for NFT, or make a parameter to handle fungible tokens. latter is preferred if it is secure

I've done a little token stuff, will try and slot in some time this week to add some docs/scripts for testing & understanding this.
Are we trying to create tokens that are created on chain 1 on cluster X that can migrate and be cashed out on chain 2 on cluster X?

[29-Apr-19 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
right now, its supports only non fungible tokens, ie. supply of 1, with some extra data attached. 
But there is a massive bug, that allows you to create a token with data without a supply of 1... So migrating the token to another chin is in effect duplicating it.

[29-Apr-19 06:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was able to migrate a NFT twice to the same chain, and it created 2 NFT with the same exact data on the other chain.

[29-Apr-19 06:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can it be redeemed on the external chain?

[29-Apr-19 06:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure sending it back to the source chain to see if it goes back into the origional tokens supply or creates a new token.

[29-Apr-19 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Leaving this with dimxy. You guys can mess around with it if you want, but sure something is messed up somwhere, or at least it seems to be to me.. You can create basically unlimited tokens with this method, with nothing that defines them apart from their name. Which I dont think is a unique identifier.

[29-Apr-19 07:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Why are you making tokens instead of real chains? ...did I miss chapter 12 again?.....I'll go back to 9 and catch up

[29-Apr-19 07:49 AM] dimxy#2587
First I implemented NFT token migration and I tested it.
Recently the migration of fungible tokens has been added too but has not been tested yet (as nodes were not upgraded). There might be errors surely for fungible tokens migration as this is not that straightforward as NFT case. Need to test this yet.

[29-Apr-19 11:20 AM] dimxy#2587
@blackjok3r  actually this call ./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKDRAGON tokencreate token 1 "a test token" "some non fungible data stuff" creates not a NFT token, but a fungible token.
This is because "some non fungible data stuff" was not parsed (as it should be in hex format like "ED0102030405..." with 1st byte is the eval code of cc responsble for NFT validation) and tokencreate switched to fungible token (with no such param)
So it was actually a fungible token. For it there is no amount=1 sat limit and it was actually 10000000 sat token created (as amount param is in coins, not satoshis). So for such a token we could indeed import 1 or 10 sat or any amount of  it. For every such import a new import token would be created in the destination chain with a new tokenid and a reference to the source token. But we cannot import more than the initial total amount and before the each import of some token amount the same amount is burned in the source chain.

To prevent this issue with the param I added a check to tokencreate which would output an error if NFT data hex param was not parsed successfully.
