battery optimzation might take some effort. @Alright did you ever have issues with oracles not recieving data, or recieving a nullstring instead of what was intended?

[03-Nov-18 12:56 PM] Alright#0419
you aren't setting the first byte or two bytes properly

[03-Nov-18 12:56 PM] Alright#0419
what data type are you using?

[03-Nov-18 12:58 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
256 string

I'm using this script to test sending - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smk762/kmd_pulp/master/Staked/oracles/send_GPS.py

[03-Nov-18 01:04 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
tried a few variations with and without quotes etc. to no effect

[03-Nov-18 01:07 PM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator is it s or S?

[03-Nov-18 01:07 PM] Alright#0419
that script will work with S *I think*

[03-Nov-18 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
won't work with s

[03-Nov-18 01:08 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
'format': 's'

[03-Nov-18 01:08 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cool, I'll try it on an `S`

[03-Nov-18 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
yea so you can either change it to S or make only the first byte the length in little endian

[03-Nov-18 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
try `fullhex = str(hexlen) + rawhex`

[03-Nov-18 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
get rid of those ifs

[03-Nov-18 01:10 PM] Alright#0419
or just make it error if it's >256

[03-Nov-18 01:11 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what 0 prefix for lt 16 and lt256?

[03-Nov-18 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
it's because hexlen will only be a single character if <16

[03-Nov-18 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
that make sense?

[03-Nov-18 01:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, so first 4 indicate length -  is that for all data types?

[03-Nov-18 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
all other data types other than S, only first byte is length

[03-Nov-18 01:14 PM] Alright#0419
S is the only one that takes the first 2 bytes as length

[03-Nov-18 01:14 PM] Alright#0419
I think?

[03-Nov-18 01:17 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
```python
if bytelen < 16:
    bigend = "0" + str(hexlen)
elif bytelen < 256:
    bigend = str(hexlen)
else:
    print("message too large, must be less than 256 characters")
```

that work @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator ?

[03-Nov-18 01:20 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
error here  `   lilend = bigend[2] + bigend[3] + bigend[0] + bigend[1]` 
2 and 3 dont exist, so trying 0 / 1

[03-Nov-18 01:21 PM] Alright#0419
no no

[03-Nov-18 01:21 PM] Alright#0419
just get rid of it

[03-Nov-18 01:21 PM] Alright#0419
lilend = bigend

[03-Nov-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Same bug is in dwy branch lol ... I was like oh fuck ... Ie written so much code in it today, but its all good, just gettransactio segfault.

[03-Nov-18 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Need to start testing this dwy branch... then txblast one of the chains that dont matter on one of my notaries... 🤣

🚀 💥 

[03-Nov-18 01:23 PM] Alright#0419
put off the explorers yesterday, sorry

[03-Nov-18 01:23 PM] Alright#0419
working on it now

[03-Nov-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats ok ... I made a small script that tells us how long each chain hasnt had a block for

[03-Nov-18 01:26 PM] Alright#0419
need to figure out how to automate branch management on explorers

[03-Nov-18 01:26 PM] Alright#0419
was doing it all manually before, and it's a bitch

[03-Nov-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think just use staked notary ... I am thinking to add an option to start.sh, so yo can start it without config.ini and have iguana start as a n option

[03-Nov-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then everythig can just use that...

[03-Nov-18 01:28 PM] Alright#0419
so scrap the staked repo?

[03-Nov-18 01:28 PM] Alright#0419
just merge all functionality of staked and stakednotary into a single repo?

[03-Nov-18 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes maybe ... it might be easier

[03-Nov-18 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wont do it yet ... as im using the staked repo for my testing atm... dont want to have to redo all that

[03-Nov-18 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Or can the pool already do it?

[03-Nov-18 01:31 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Alright I had a tough time automating the pool before cloning stakedNotary

[03-Nov-18 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That branch code is crazy

[03-Nov-18 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im still not sure how I figured it out lol

👷 🃏 🏋 

[03-Nov-18 01:41 PM] Alright#0419
you're talking about staked repo?

[03-Nov-18 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
long term we need to think about windows :/

[03-Nov-18 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
so that staked repo is likely to be scraped for something much more complex

[03-Nov-18 01:43 PM] Alright#0419
Although, maybe we can make a PR to jl777/komodo with exceptions for the main chain

[03-Nov-18 01:43 PM] Alright#0419
then add it to agama like any other coin

[03-Nov-18 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think so far, ther evreything can be merged into komodo

[03-Nov-18 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and it would still work, but it needs many tests...

[03-Nov-18 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the branch I am working on now though... probably not ... however its only for notaries so that doenst really matter

[03-Nov-18 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
Hmm, that's kind of a burden on KMD if we try to do that

[03-Nov-18 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
will likely need to maintain our own agama or some kind of UI for users

[03-Nov-18 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
For the main chain, it would probably be ok, but a for evey 2 months, is pushing ti for Agama... SPV servers would help for ppls wallets though

[03-Nov-18 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they are easy to do

[03-Nov-18 01:57 PM] Alright#0419
it's a huge chunk of code to PR though

[03-Nov-18 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I wouldnt like to sor tit out

[03-Nov-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Can always add it to agama, but make the user download a binary from somwhere else ... or just use SPV .. then the hard forks done matter

[03-Nov-18 02:04 PM] Alright#0419
this is on CFEKLF `PoW for staked coin PoS 34% vs target 1%`

[03-Nov-18 02:04 PM] Alright#0419
that doesn't matter at all, right?

[03-Nov-18 02:04 PM] Alright#0419
no BR, so just as long as the chain keeps moving, it's fine?

[03-Nov-18 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah as long as its moveing... I think because hte supply is high, the CPU miners cant keep up with it

[03-Nov-18 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
staked weitght is too high maybe ?

[03-Nov-18 02:10 PM] Alright#0419
as long as the main chain levels out with more hash, it's fine

[03-Nov-18 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah... I need to have a look at that, is the diff adjustting properly ?

[03-Nov-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
msot of the PoW blocks this morning were invlaid

[03-Nov-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Found a bug with start.sh

[03-Nov-18 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
When it stops CFEK for update it cant see that its stopped, as the grep also matches with all chains after it

[03-Nov-18 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[03-Nov-18 02:53 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Need to include the whitespace after CFEK - "CFEK "

[03-Nov-18 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thanks 😄

[03-Nov-18 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Succesful migrate from CFEK to every chain.

[03-Nov-18 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No branch is broken... Going to start 3 day loop now

[03-Nov-18 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Every 30s it will export 10 CFEK's

[03-Nov-18 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to all chains

[03-Nov-18 04:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Really need some hash rate on CFEK ... I have a few cores on it but its not doing much 3000s plus betwwwn blocks

To start testing:
1) git clone https://github.com/tonymorony/trollbox_gui
2) sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip libssl-dev
     pip3 install requests
     pip3 install wheel
     pip3 install kivy 
     pip3 install python-bitcoinlib
     pip3 install python-bitcoinrpc
3) Hardcode your RPC credentials here for chain on which you want to test (I'm using CCNG now - can share the details if needed): 
https://github.com/tonymorony/trollbox_gui/blob/master/main.py#L154
And run as `python3 main.py`
Then logic as in trollbox scripts - create nickname/oracle/subscribe if needed. 
There will nothing happen in gui on this actions in menu but you should see output in console

I put a couple of cores on CFEK mining - but where is the reported 63202 networkhasps coming from? (Is this a leftover from the premine?)

[03-Nov-18 05:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its from Alright staking

[03-Nov-18 05:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The block reward is MASSIVE

[03-Nov-18 05:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and I bet hes staking to a straight wallet, each BR to a new address ... Difficulty has goe mental he needs to stop staking the block reward

[03-Nov-18 05:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Premine is instant all firt coins are minted in the first block.

[03-Nov-18 05:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And the other chains, dont have enough coins on them, I managed to migrate 10 to each then the chain stopped, and they are not mature so I cant stake them.

[03-Nov-18 07:32 PM] CMaurice#1685
@TonyL  my machine has a problem compiling kivy. Not your problem, just a reason why I'm not testing trollbox_gui

[03-Nov-18 07:38 PM] TonyL#3577
@CMaurice I've tested on mac so far, at the moment @Alright testing it on Ubuntu - if you have Ubuntu as well I'll prepare instruction for it asap

[03-Nov-18 07:40 PM] CMaurice#1685
I am on Ubuntu 16.04, but hey, it's Saturday night. Also looks like I've properly mucked up my Python  install now

[03-Nov-18 07:40 PM] CMaurice#1685
trying to fix stuff

[03-Nov-18 07:47 PM] CMaurice#1685
ah from kivy docs looks like sdl2 requirements, hope to try tomorrow

[03-Nov-18 08:37 PM] TonyL#3577
I'll try to install it on fresh Ubuntu (but 18 not 16 I think) and publish step-by-step dependencies guide for it asap

[03-Nov-18 08:46 PM] Alright#0419
Chains are moving again, sorry about that, got caught up doing some chat dapp stuff

[03-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Alright#0419
please migrate coins to 0 BR chains and stake if you can
