@LabsAssistant if you're changing your pubkey, please submit a PR within the next ~6 hours or so

[24-May-19 01:48 AM] Alright#0419
Does anyone have a list of who is pledging funding from an NN?

[24-May-19 01:48 AM] Alright#0419
want to start organizing how we'll handle this multisig

[24-May-19 02:18 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r I want to get these oracles changes into master prior to launch

[24-May-19 02:18 AM] Alright#0419
just start the chain post-activation

[24-May-19 02:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Alright,
I'll pr before the deadline.  Will have a chance to check this afternoon/evening for who pledged. If it's not too urgent Ill do it then.

[24-May-19 02:19 AM] Alright#0419
not so urgent, just had someone messaging me asking where to send donations

[24-May-19 02:19 AM] Alright#0419
don't want to leave them waiting too long üòÖ

[24-May-19 02:20 AM] CrisF#3405
OK, will check in a bit.

[24-May-19 02:24 AM] Alright#0419
@CrisF you think we should get the ANN up now?

[24-May-19 02:25 AM] Alright#0419
realize it's still not 100%, but would be nice to make the post *before* launch

[24-May-19 02:25 AM] Alright#0419
I can put it up if there isn't anything else we need to change

[24-May-19 02:26 AM] Exile13#4458
Need graphics?

[24-May-19 02:26 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, that would be good I'd say.  Apparently there are a few reccomended  techniques/timing strategies for posting.

[24-May-19 02:26 AM] Alright#0419
like?

[24-May-19 02:27 AM] Alright#0419
not sure @Exile13

[24-May-19 02:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Haven't checked the state of the ANN. Will look soon.

[24-May-19 02:27 AM] Alright#0419
`reccomended techniques/timing strategies for posting`?

[24-May-19 02:28 AM] Exile13#4458
I would post to blockfolio, then tweet that

[24-May-19 02:28 AM] CrisF#3405
Will you be around in a few hours, @Exile13?

[24-May-19 02:28 AM] Exile13#4458
Yes @CrisF

[24-May-19 02:29 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool, I'll give you shout when I get back. Thanks!

[24-May-19 02:30 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright yes, apparently doing the timing right will help in the future for adding modifying. (for BITCOINTALK)

[24-May-19 02:32 AM] Alright#0419
figure we get it up then do 3-4 `[reserved]` posts right away

[24-May-19 02:32 AM] Alright#0419
can use them for updates and such

[24-May-19 02:32 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, that's the one.

[24-May-19 02:32 AM] Alright#0419
ok I'll hold off, still not sure what optimal timing is

[24-May-19 02:33 AM] Exile13#4458

[24-May-19 02:38 AM] CrisF#3405

"this is who it's for and why"

[24-May-19 03:50 AM] Alright#0419
