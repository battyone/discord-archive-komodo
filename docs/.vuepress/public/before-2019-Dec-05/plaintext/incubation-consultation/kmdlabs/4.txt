I've filtered them out on the pool

[07-Oct-18 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I think htat ac_perc as it sits can never work with a pool

[07-Oct-18 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it needs to be changed, we have discusses it with james, but obviously he hasnt had time yet

[07-Oct-18 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wonder if ac_perc works with a BR of 0.

[07-Oct-18 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No idea how to use KV though... it just keeps saying `couldnt find ("key")`

[07-Oct-18 03:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Got an idea of this so far... looks like I might be able to make it print from mempool anyway, making this low diff thing pointless

[07-Oct-18 04:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Is it all good to update, then run `update_komodo.sh`?

[07-Oct-18 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm very close here... one thing left to do.
I need to take the length of `ptr->key` and only print the value of : `keyvalue` from the length of that value

[07-Oct-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF just run ./stop.sh

[07-Oct-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then ./start.sh

[07-Oct-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
currently you will need to stop it the first time I think

[07-Oct-18 04:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks!

[07-Oct-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it shouldnt have to do that, but there is a bug

[07-Oct-18 04:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nope KV is bugged out...

[07-Oct-18 04:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cannot use the password value 😦

[07-Oct-18 04:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
give up for now

[07-Oct-18 04:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bye all

likely yes, it never printed from mempool, it just seemed that way with low diff on-demand

[07-Oct-18 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
to print from mempool:
1. getrawmempool -> txids[]
2. iterate the txids[] and find ones with opreturn
3. parse the opreturn and display ones in the right format

[07-Oct-18 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
THAT is the way to display mempool

[07-Oct-18 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not looking to print mempool

[07-Oct-18 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will let u know what I found tomorrow @jl777c

[07-Oct-18 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
does anyone know what @blackjok3r meant by you can't use password?

[07-Oct-18 03:16 PM] jspook16#3059
FYI I was able to parse opreturn transactions to display key values in the right format. Will work on getting the tx IDs from mempool today

[07-Oct-18 03:16 PM] jspook16#3059
You can't use the password feature for a kvupdate I think @Alright

[07-Oct-18 03:16 PM] Alright#0419
why?

[07-Oct-18 03:17 PM] Alright#0419
doubt anything broke it since I tested last

[07-Oct-18 03:18 PM] jspook16#3059
Haven't really checked it, so not sure

[07-Oct-18 03:18 PM] Alright#0419
you just need to make sure you set password properly

[07-Oct-18 03:18 PM] Alright#0419
there's been some confusion over that before

[07-Oct-18 03:19 PM] Alright#0419
`kvupdate <key> <value> <amount of days> <password>`

[07-Oct-18 03:19 PM] Alright#0419
*must* set amount of days if you want to use password

[07-Oct-18 03:21 PM] Alright#0419
can anyone think of a usecase for a chain that's on-demand blockss and diff never raises?

[07-Oct-18 03:22 PM] Alright#0419
we made it, but not sure it's actually useful now if we're just going to pull OP_RETURNs from mempool

[07-Oct-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
a chain with very high tx/min

[07-Oct-18 03:24 PM] Alright#0419
no block reward though

[07-Oct-18 03:24 PM] Alright#0419
it's a cool concept, but I doubt anyone will actually use it

[07-Oct-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it would reduce the CPU time needed for scaling

[07-Oct-18 03:25 PM] Alright#0419
💡

[07-Oct-18 03:25 PM] Alright#0419
yea scale test could use it 🤔

[07-Oct-18 03:25 PM] Alright#0419

@blackjok3r script for pushing assetchains.json to oracle is done

[07-Oct-18 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
a chain on one node is more like a database

[07-Oct-18 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just one if statement in miner.cpp that needs to be changed for that

[07-Oct-18 07:15 PM] Alright#0419
```
#!/bin/bash
txid=$2
(cat $1 | tr -d '\n' | tr -d ' ') > assets.hex
xxd -p assets.hex | tr -d '\n' > rawhex
hexraw=$(cat rawhex) 
declen=$(($(cat rawhex | wc -c) / 2 ))
echo $declen
if [ $declen -le 4096 ]
then 
        hexlen=$(echo "0$(printf '%x\n' $declen)")
else
        hexlen=$(printf '%x\n' $declen)
fi
len=$(echo ${hexlen:2:2}${hexlen:0:2})
echo $txid $len$hexraw
```
Can be used to push arbitrary json files to an S data type oracle
