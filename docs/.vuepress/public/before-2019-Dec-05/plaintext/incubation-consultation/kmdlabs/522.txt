[21-Nov-19 02:41 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
did want to ask dumb questions - ended up looking more dumb

[21-Nov-19 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I ask dumb questions all the time

[21-Nov-19 02:41 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
deal

[21-Nov-19 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
even ones I should already know the answers to 😦

[21-Nov-19 02:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
never be afraid to ask anything, especially here; one of the main things we need to do is be able to help people from all levels of knowledge

[21-Nov-19 02:44 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
the  last  time  I used the repo  was probably in April - testing  ducks or something  like that

[21-Nov-19 02:44 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[21-Nov-19 02:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[21-Nov-19 02:47 PM] Oszy#5734
just realized our channel was moved up 😄

[21-Nov-19 02:47 PM] Oszy#5734
nice

[21-Nov-19 02:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
?

[21-Nov-19 02:49 PM] Oszy#5734
moved from ecosystem to incubation & consultation

[21-Nov-19 02:49 PM] Oszy#5734
+ 4 new channels

[21-Nov-19 02:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because the 40000000000000000 we had wasn't enough?

[21-Nov-19 02:52 PM] Oszy#5734
when we grow it's better to keep things separate. you know it's a chaos in this channel when there's something going on

[21-Nov-19 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and the 1st post is spam 😛

did you see that site? i thought my eyes went half blind

[21-Nov-19 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`when we grow it's better to keep things separate. `
until it's not because people don't want to keep switching back and forth through 4 channels to have 2 conversations about one project 🤷🏽

[21-Nov-19 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i thought my eyes went half blind`
s-nomp, iirc

[21-Nov-19 02:53 PM] Oszy#5734
the blurring is s-nomp feature?

[21-Nov-19 02:54 PM] SHossain#0007
css

[21-Nov-19 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
blurring?

[21-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Oszy#5734
i know it's css, but what's the purpose of that idk

[21-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Oszy#5734
hover over anything CG

[21-Nov-19 02:54 PM] SHossain#0007
the purpose is to amuse you or the users 😛

[21-Nov-19 02:55 PM] Oszy#5734
not amused 😄

[21-Nov-19 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
oh, you mean on the portal page, I thought you meant the actual pool

[21-Nov-19 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
on the plus side, it'll take him days to add LABS to his pool (if he even can), so he will not spam here soon 😈

I can't see LABS

[21-Nov-19 04:18 PM] Oszy#5734
so don't spam here please

[21-Nov-19 04:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I can't see LABS`
because it will not work on a stock pool stratum 🤣

[21-Nov-19 04:41 PM] CHMEX#0686
added if that is what he means

[21-Nov-19 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CHMEX he doesn't even have a working LABS pool 😣

[21-Nov-19 04:42 PM] Oszy#5734

{Reactions}
🤦🏽 

[21-Nov-19 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
he's only sorta got KMDICE and RFOX pools working

[21-Nov-19 04:43 PM] CHMEX#0686

[21-Nov-19 04:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[21-Nov-19 04:47 PM] CHMEX#0686
ok there is 7.29 USD to be made

[21-Nov-19 04:47 PM] CHMEX#0686

[21-Nov-19 04:50 PM] Alright#0419
blows my mind that this coin still exists

[21-Nov-19 04:50 PM] CHMEX#0686
136KMD¨ I guess

[21-Nov-19 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`blows my mind that this coin still exists`
being abandoned has privileges 🤷🏽

[21-Nov-19 04:53 PM] Alright#0419
@siu - Chainmakers @jorian can I kill it? :troll:

[21-Nov-19 04:54 PM] Alright#0419
that 571 KMD would do well in the LABS dev fund 😅

[21-Nov-19 04:54 PM] jorian#4555
Blows my mind that people mine it and trade it 😛

[21-Nov-19 04:54 PM] Alright#0419
probably because you told them to?

[21-Nov-19 04:54 PM] CHMEX#0686
you have 72m?

Since when do people have to listen to someone to mine and trade something

[21-Nov-19 04:55 PM] Alright#0419
Ah no, hadn't looked at volume

[21-Nov-19 04:55 PM] Alright#0419
no one does

[21-Nov-19 04:55 PM] jorian#4555
Well then

[21-Nov-19 04:55 PM] Alright#0419
well it went from "this is a real coin" to "this is a test coin" with no notice

[21-Nov-19 04:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_blames DP (or whatever new name TripleX gave it)_

[21-Nov-19 04:56 PM] Alright#0419
also, it's a "test coin" with a CEX market 😫

[21-Nov-19 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's a CEX market for many coins that have been abandoned (some as long as 5 years back) 🤷🏽

[21-Nov-19 05:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, if there's a market for a test coin, does that mean it passed the test? 🤔

[21-Nov-19 05:58 PM] PHBA2061#2530
didn't notice that we just have 3-4 more channels for LABS 😅

[21-Nov-19 06:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, we do ☹

[21-Nov-19 06:06 PM] PHBA2061#2530
let's hope they will be put into use 😅

[21-Nov-19 07:24 PM] jorian#4555
what branch is labs on lately?

[21-Nov-19 07:24 PM] jorian#4555
i still have many_iguana

[21-Nov-19 07:25 PM] jorian#4555
or should this go in #labs-dev 😛

[21-Nov-19 07:44 PM] PHBA2061#2530
should rather be in #labs-support probably :abusedsmily: 
I'm on master though

[21-Nov-19 08:03 PM] CHMEX#0686
just heads up most of my explorers are down atm incl LABS because of some hardware failure

[21-Nov-19 08:11 PM] CHMEX#0686
and back

[21-Nov-19 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_hates whomever split LABS into 897000 different channels_

[21-Nov-19 08:21 PM] jorian#4555
probably because @Alright wanted it

[21-Nov-19 08:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, then, fek him too :troll_lol:

[21-Nov-19 08:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
LMAO wtf is happening here?!?

[21-Nov-19 08:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
i go away for a day and wow

[21-Nov-19 08:52 PM] phm87#7395
maybe this channel will be deleted/archived in a near future and only the 4 #labs-* channels will remain ... our future is very vague and unknown

[21-Nov-19 08:52 PM] phm87#7395
Do we still have access to the private channel of KMDLabs notaries ? I'll check ... edit: yes, it still exists and we still have access ^^

[21-Nov-19 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`LMAO wtf is happening here?!?`
*someone* decided we needed 1 channel for every active person 🙄
