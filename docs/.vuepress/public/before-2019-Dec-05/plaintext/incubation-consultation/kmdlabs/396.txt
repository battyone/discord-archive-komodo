Lol - can't get the pos64 staker to find the list.json using the staked (not stakednotary) repo

[24-May-19 08:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it needs to be where komodod is.

[24-May-19 08:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so komodo/master/ or komodo/src

[24-May-19 08:40 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
it's in ``/home/me/staked/komodo/master`` with komodod

[24-May-19 08:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
did you start the daemon manually from that folder?

[24-May-19 08:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you need to do that, but im still using a hell old version

[24-May-19 08:41 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
ahh - no I adjusted the LABS.conf for the blocknotify option and just used start

[24-May-19 08:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe stick it in staked folder? that may work... its whereever it starts from I think

@blackjok3r - when you get a chance - I have screens full of Invalid block messages on a staker. Sure it can't be correct.

[24-May-19 09:05 PM] CMaurice#1685
@Bar_F1sh_Rel sure you're not mining rather than staking? I saw those messages while cli mining earlier. Might not be relevant tho

[24-May-19 09:06 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Yeah - staking not mining

[24-May-19 09:06 PM] jorian#4555
hmm

[24-May-19 09:06 PM] jorian#4555
i barely have any invalid blocks

[24-May-19 09:06 PM] jorian#4555

@CMaurice - shouldn't need more daemons?

[24-May-19 09:11 PM] jorian#4555
your daemon is already running, maurice

[24-May-19 09:11 PM] jorian#4555
if you want multiple of the same daemons

[24-May-19 09:11 PM] jorian#4555
you should add `-datadir` and change p2p and rpc port

[24-May-19 09:12 PM] jorian#4555
datadir should be different from the original one

[24-May-19 09:13 PM] jorian#4555
`./komodod -ac_name=LABS ... etc ... -datadir=/home/CMaurice/.komodo/LABSstake port=12345 rpcport=12346`

[24-May-19 09:13 PM] jorian#4555

I must be missing something about staking on NN then

[24-May-19 09:17 PM] jorian#4555
it's possible but not advisable
