your making it complicated by doing that... eveyrhting should be on chain

[12-Oct-18 08:19 AM] Alright#0419
the password is the privkey

[12-Oct-18 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how do you get this mystery alias file? is that also an oracle?

[12-Oct-18 08:19 AM] Alright#0419
set it

[12-Oct-18 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
who sets it?

[12-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
so let's say you see a pubkey, and you go "hmmm, who's that?"

[12-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
you ask them who they are or ask someone else

[12-Oct-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no thats too ahrd to use ..

[12-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
you open an alias file and set it

[12-Oct-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it has to have a name set by the person who owns the pubkey

[12-Oct-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
automagically

[12-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
oh we can do that actually

[12-Oct-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
im not editing files

[12-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
just have an oracle for only that

[12-Oct-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes...

[12-Oct-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there should be an oracle (or KV or something) with the alias: pubkey

[12-Oct-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but somehoe you cannot allow names to be added that already exist

[12-Oct-18 08:21 AM] Alright#0419
just need to send the name

[12-Oct-18 08:21 AM] Alright#0419
yea I don't get why we don't leave it to the user to recognize who is who

[12-Oct-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they just wont do it

[12-Oct-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
man

[12-Oct-18 08:22 AM] Alright#0419
dude we can make it super freaking simple

[12-Oct-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not being a dick, im just saying if i am a user im not going to do that...

[12-Oct-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it ahs to just work

[12-Oct-18 08:22 AM] Alright#0419
see a pubkey you don't recognize? copy it, do `./<script> <pubkey> <alias>`

[12-Oct-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no body will do that

[12-Oct-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they will see the pubkey go WTF is that and leave

[12-Oct-18 08:23 AM] Alright#0419
ok man, idk

[12-Oct-18 08:23 AM] Alright#0419
I'm going to do it

[12-Oct-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant have something like the chat alias a manual process.. kv would be better in that case even if its slow

[12-Oct-18 08:23 AM] Alright#0419
I don't see any way KV is better

[12-Oct-18 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cant we use KV to set the alias, using a password?

[12-Oct-18 08:24 AM] Alright#0419
has no benefits

[12-Oct-18 08:24 AM] Alright#0419
oh yes, that'd work

[12-Oct-18 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it has an alias that noone can steal ?

[12-Oct-18 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so use it for that and only that

[12-Oct-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the key/value would be backwards ... to the pubkey is the key, and the alias is the value

[12-Oct-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when the chat program sees a pubkey it

[12-Oct-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
fetches the alias from KV

[12-Oct-18 08:25 AM] Alright#0419
ok, I can do that

[12-Oct-18 08:26 AM] Alright#0419
we need a separate oracle still to register the kv txid

{Reactions}
💯 👏 

[12-Oct-18 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
I fixed the dupe

[12-Oct-18 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
I was just echoing it twice >.<

[12-Oct-18 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[12-Oct-18 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok so what do I need to do now ?

[12-Oct-18 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you have got the chat working good ?

[12-Oct-18 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should I focus on making some way of removing chain from iguana?

[12-Oct-18 08:29 AM] Alright#0419
That would be productive, yes

[12-Oct-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or automating the assetchains.json and making some way to make the assetchains.json on chain avalible from a URL ?

[12-Oct-18 08:30 AM] Alright#0419
thinking `-spotat` would be the simplest way

[12-Oct-18 08:30 AM] Alright#0419
although we'd need each chain to stop at a specific height

[12-Oct-18 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can probaly change stopat to be a timestamp ? just an idea, maybe I cant do that ... not sure depends what data is avalibe where it triggers it

[12-Oct-18 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I thik just making iguana stop dPoW after a timestamp is simpler

[12-Oct-18 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
who cares if the chain still exists ...

[12-Oct-18 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as its not notarized...

[12-Oct-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then nonoen can tansfer coins to or from it ... although they can still export to a dead chain.

[12-Oct-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dont seen anything we can do about that ... you can send to a non eistnat chain as it is

[12-Oct-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems up to the user not be be stupid in that case

[12-Oct-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or to check assetchains.json before export TX to amke sure the chain is there and is being notarised

[12-Oct-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i think a URL to replace the github assetchans.json is probably the first thing we need .

This will at least show the pubkey. Stops impersonation for now, but I'll work on adding the ability to set aliases for known pubkeys

[12-Oct-18 08:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that should be fairly easy to do usig KV tbh ...

[12-Oct-18 08:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can give it a go if you like ?

[12-Oct-18 08:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi,
Did the `git pull` oraclesfetch` start`.
Saw a few errors at the start but let it go to see what would happen.
came back a minute later and they were off screen due to 1500+
```<<<<<<<<<<< bitcoind_RPC: KMD post_process_bitcoind_RPC (getbestblockhash) error.{"result":null,"error":{"code":-28,"message":"Loading block index..."},"id":"jl777"}
``` Now has changed. Occasional normal std readout and many of the errors below.```[STAKEDED] : chosen = 4  out of 25 loop.(1)

[12-Oct-18 08:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or you want to do all this ?

[12-Oct-18 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
no please try it

[12-Oct-18 08:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok will do

[12-Oct-18 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
ah shit

[12-Oct-18 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
I didn't push the latest assetchains.json

[12-Oct-18 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
we changed the format

[12-Oct-18 08:56 AM] Alright#0419
latest on oracle isn't update, sorry joker got sidetracked

[12-Oct-18 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  there is an update in master branch so all chains will restart

{Reactions}
👍 

[12-Oct-18 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and yesy you might need to do it again ... or just do gitpull

[12-Oct-18 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and start to use the json in git

[12-Oct-18 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tats updated

[12-Oct-18 08:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok

[12-Oct-18 08:57 AM] CrisF#3405
Git pulled ~10 mins ago. Will redo and restart.

[12-Oct-18 08:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you did oraclefetch.sh

[12-Oct-18 08:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it ahs the wrong assetchains.json

[12-Oct-18 08:57 AM] Alright#0419
I just updated oracle

[12-Oct-18 08:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and listassetchains.py will fail

[12-Oct-18 08:57 AM] CrisF#3405
I did.

[12-Oct-18 08:57 AM] Alright#0419
do another oraclefetch

{Reactions}
👍 

[12-Oct-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the most important thing is to get a URL that loads the oraclefetch so we only habe the 1 copy of assetchains.json

[12-Oct-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for notaries its no problem just to use oraclefetch.... but

[12-Oct-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the chain isnt running... there needs to be a backup it cna grab it from

[12-Oct-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that we dont have to manually do

[12-Oct-18 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
something like an AWS lambda seems like a good idea... and every single notary can just push the assetchains.json when it detects an update

[12-Oct-18 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is like 0 point of fail there

[12-Oct-18 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just need to work out how to stop non notaries pushign to it 🤔

[12-Oct-18 09:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
those are free btw .. 😄

[12-Oct-18 09:02 AM] Alright#0419
could just have a bootstrap script

[12-Oct-18 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
that is ran before you do anything else

[12-Oct-18 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
that just syncs the chain, grabs latest assetchains.json

[12-Oct-18 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its for staked repo and the pool and all that ... they currently pull assetchains.json from git with curl THEN start the chains ...

[12-Oct-18 09:03 AM] CrisF#3405
coredump

[12-Oct-18 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they cannot start the chains without first having the assetchains.json
