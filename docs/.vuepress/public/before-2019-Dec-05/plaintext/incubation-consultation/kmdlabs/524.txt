duplicated key in json

[28-Nov-19 08:27 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
from getrawtransaction

[28-Nov-19 09:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's not duplicated

[28-Nov-19 09:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
1 vin is used for vout

[28-Nov-19 09:29 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but also this addr is later in vout, and inside vin structire is it proper json?

[28-Nov-19 09:29 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
for exampel dict cannot have 2 same keys, but maybe json can ?

[28-Nov-19 09:30 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
anyway it's not an issue

[28-Nov-19 09:30 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I spent lot of time debugging some strange addr kind of default addr

[28-Nov-19 09:30 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
taddr that is not always visible

[28-Nov-19 09:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
first time I did t-tx without using whole utxo a new t-addr to take the reminder was created

[28-Nov-19 09:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and that new addr is hell to debug

[28-Nov-19 09:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I could not display it other way the using listunspent

[28-Nov-19 09:32 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but when spending part of it - the addr was not visible in listreceivedbyaddress, so I could not list it in any way

[28-Nov-19 09:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`is it proper json?`

how to distribute new utxos without disrupting old ones --- ive done reset my utxos 3 times this week

[29-Nov-19 03:59 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
bought 10k worth of LABS from one of you - now show me how to distribute them through my 64 addresses

[29-Nov-19 04:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you would need to create a raw transaction using the new inputs

[29-Nov-19 04:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS help createrawtransaction`

[29-Nov-19 04:07 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
looks like a tomorrow thing

[29-Nov-19 08:31 AM] Oszy#5734
see you found sendmany.py 😛

[29-Nov-19 02:20 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
yup

[29-Nov-19 02:20 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i dont  know how important old utxos are

[29-Nov-19 02:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
after 30 days you are losing potential

[29-Nov-19 02:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
up to 30 days a utxo is growing in age

[29-Nov-19 02:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
after 30 it has stopped any meanigful time value growth and just needs to stake

[29-Nov-19 02:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
so any utxos not staking within 30 days are not primed

[29-Nov-19 02:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
how  do  i ook up my utxos

[29-Nov-19 02:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ive been looking up commands

[29-Nov-19 02:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
listunspent

[29-Nov-19 02:25 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
that  will show all addresses

[29-Nov-19 02:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
there is also a script that shows you your utxo count per segid

[29-Nov-19 02:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
where is that

[29-Nov-19 02:27 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ive been F'n them up for the last 5 days

[29-Nov-19 02:28 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
googled  sendrawtransaction

[29-Nov-19 02:28 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
but  I have 64 address'  wait dont I have  65?

[29-Nov-19 02:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```
listunspent 6 9999999 "[\"your_addy_here\"]"
```

[29-Nov-19 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for the stuff in the "new" addy

[29-Nov-19 02:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
if you havent been pubkey mining... you have HUNDREDs

[29-Nov-19 02:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
but yes you have 64 segid addresses

[29-Nov-19 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you have jq installed (which you should)
`komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS listaddressgroupings|jq -r '.[][][1]|select((.|tonumber) > 0)'|jq -s '.|length'`
will tell you how many addresses you have that hold a balance

[29-Nov-19 02:36 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
so  create listunspent.sh

[29-Nov-19 02:36 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
./komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS listunspent 6 9999999 "[\"RNbRVEVMNc9Yqf6ECKgEz51vsRTPkEb5Zo\"]"
./komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS listunspent 6 9999999 "[\"REPYX4oDTnHa3FDKtkXBXvrBpvVAK3jfN2\"]"

[29-Nov-19 02:37 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
copy and paste my addresses -  or  is there a json way that makes the output look better

[29-Nov-19 02:37 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i can google

[29-Nov-19 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, lets start over

[29-Nov-19 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what is it that you want to accomplish?

[29-Nov-19 02:38 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
everything - lol

[29-Nov-19 02:39 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
see  my UTXOs - uhhhhh manage them

[29-Nov-19 02:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_lacks the time to teach you everything we've learned in the last year and the things we've yet to discover_

[29-Nov-19 02:39 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
understand

[29-Nov-19 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`see my UTXOs`
what UTXOs? and for what purpose?

[29-Nov-19 02:41 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i guess I need to see my unspent -- I will  work  on  my question  -- - I ned  coffee

[29-Nov-19 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at least one of us can tell you how to do whatever you want to do (as long as it can be done)
but, only if we know what it is that you want to do 😛

[29-Nov-19 02:42 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
if I buy more LABS for the fun  of  it - I want to get that distribute PY thing working - I just want to  see more of the action

[29-Nov-19 02:43 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i want more commands

[29-Nov-19 02:43 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
damn it

[29-Nov-19 02:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
> I just want to see more of the action
`tail -f ~/.komodo/LABS/debug.log`
and you'll see all of the action

[29-Nov-19 02:43 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I dont  even care what they do

{Reactions}
😕 

[29-Nov-19 02:44 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
already got tail going

[29-Nov-19 02:44 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i was kidding

[29-Nov-19 02:45 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i  got to get coffee

[29-Nov-19 02:47 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
coin  management commands --- Ill keep looking at these unfinished PY scripts

[29-Nov-19 02:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`coin management commands`
how would you like them managed?

[29-Nov-19 02:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
Coin Control

[29-Nov-19 02:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
built into KomodoOcean

[29-Nov-19 02:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
But i cant guarantee its updated to this post fork repo

[29-Nov-19 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a lot of LABS specific bits are coming down the pike in the experimental branch of KO

[29-Nov-19 02:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
nice

[29-Nov-19 02:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
then thats gong to make this a bit easier

[29-Nov-19 02:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
I used it to help clena up DP and ZEXO stakes

[29-Nov-19 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I used it to help clena up DP and ZEXO stakes`
I have a script for that 
<https://github.com/TheComputerGenie/Misc_Stuff/blob/master/Wallet%20stuff/Consolidate.sh>
`DO NOT use it on OOT or ZILLA`

[29-Nov-19 02:57 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
like I bought 10000 LABS and wanted to distribute them with a script - sendrawtransaction script - I was working on that before Igot tired and hit  RNDsendmany script in TUIstaker.py

[29-Nov-19 03:00 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
now  I believe all my UTXOs  ar  brand  new

[29-Nov-19 03:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
thats nice... but the Coin Control UI has so much more

[29-Nov-19 03:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but the Coin Control UI has so much more`
it's literally nothing more than a GUI version of create/sign/sendrawtransaction and listunspent

[29-Nov-19 03:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
much prettier, but still the same thing

[29-Nov-19 03:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
debatable... what commands do you have to run to gather the info before using your script? How much do you need to know to only select a set of utxos?

[29-Nov-19 03:10 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
yeah -- those are the commands I  was  googling

[29-Nov-19 03:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
Coin Control does all that up front to create the check box UI

[29-Nov-19 03:11 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I  would  like to see the script at the same time

2 hours have passed since you updated to the new release that only happened 42 minutes ago?

[29-Nov-19 03:15 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
LMAO

[29-Nov-19 03:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
but again... we were told to chill on other non LABS provided binaries until they all took the upstream changes... as CG said test branch is underway of KOcean

[29-Nov-19 03:15 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
cool  --- I  can use my windows machine and mine with 2 machines!!
