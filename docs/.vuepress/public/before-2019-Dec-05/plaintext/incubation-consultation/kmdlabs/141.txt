Sorry at work so mossed the convo

[03-Dec-18 04:24 AM] axo777#1232
I think we need 2 CC's.  The oracle for locating and another to make payments when the oracle says so, or can the oracle do it all?

[03-Dec-18 04:24 AM] Alright#0419
who is sending, who is receiving and when

[03-Dec-18 04:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
My app at the moment runs on a vps with a node. The app can create, fund and query the user oracle. Each user or data stream has its own oracle

[03-Dec-18 04:25 AM] Alright#0419
each user has rpc creds of the daemon, right?

[03-Dec-18 04:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Yeah i have a db table with each users raddress etc

[03-Dec-18 04:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Each address is given an account name to make this easier

[03-Dec-18 04:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Once i get django sorted I'll link and run you thru it

[03-Dec-18 04:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Started with cherrypy, just started moving to django yesterday

[03-Dec-18 04:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Cherry py version works but auth better via django

[03-Dec-18 04:28 AM] axo777#1232
Lets take the transportation supply chain.  We have a seller, a transportation company and the buyer.  Also we can have customs officers, customs brokers, quality inspectors and other government inspectors.  A normal cargo move local or international generates a lot of paperwork with its accompanying administration.  So in the normal transportation supply chain we could have maybe 15 players.  Some would be active players and others would be observers.

[03-Dec-18 04:29 AM] Alright#0419
I need you to break that down to who is getting paid from where when

[03-Dec-18 04:30 AM] Alright#0419
and I can tell you whether or not you need an additional contract

[03-Dec-18 04:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Should be able to setup auth groups with different acess levels

[03-Dec-18 04:30 AM] axo777#1232
I was talking with jl777 and he seemed to think that we could dispense with the db if we load the boilerplate on the clientside

[03-Dec-18 04:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what I'm working on shouldnt need end user to understand blockchain or get hands dirty at all. just fill in a form, send funds, and watch the output.

[03-Dec-18 04:33 AM] axo777#1232
pay breakdown in most cases 1 seller and 1 buyer.  The buyer pays like 30 days after delivery for domestic and on shipment for international.  But there are many variations of  these terms that we would want to have in the system

[03-Dec-18 04:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
current format is gps specific, so would need some work to create another form for user to define data types/names

[03-Dec-18 04:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and other contract constraints

[03-Dec-18 04:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
adding payment escrow will also need to be implemented, but shouldn't be too hard.

[03-Dec-18 04:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
qr codes could be used to update status of package in transit

[03-Dec-18 04:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
could also tap into logistics tracking api where available

[03-Dec-18 04:38 AM] axo777#1232
In most cases the user will be the Buyer who will nominate his supplier.  We could issue a stable token against his bank deposit where the supplier would also have a account, in one scenario, then when the goods arrived inside the geofence (GPS) the CC would transfer funds , either crypto or fiat.

[03-Dec-18 04:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
unless each delivery has it's own GPS device, that could be a problem if people spoof coords. and adding a GPS to each package could be expensive unless you are talking about large shipments (e.g. sea container).

[03-Dec-18 04:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
there's also recipient needing to sign of on state of goods on arrival to consider. damages etc.

[03-Dec-18 04:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and I'm thinking some kind of multisig might need to come into play so all parties agree on dispersal of funds

[03-Dec-18 04:42 AM] axo777#1232
most goods will be palletized with boxes of barcoded or QR'd stuff riding on the pallets.  The pallets would have an RFID that is an edge device oracle to advise the blockchain.  The QR's on the pallet would be associated with the pallet RFID number and would be logged on delivery.

[03-Dec-18 04:44 AM] axo777#1232
Spoofing of signals has been discussed and so far not been experienced.  But I expect it to begin if crooks can figure out how to get to the money.  probably they can't.

[03-Dec-18 04:46 AM] axo777#1232
There will be 2 types of shipments. palletized trudkloads and LTL (less that truckload) sometimes individual packages in a van or container

[03-Dec-18 04:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if device reporting travels with cargo, it shouldnt be a problem

[03-Dec-18 04:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if we're relying on QR scans, it's much easier to fake.

[03-Dec-18 04:46 AM] axo777#1232
right

[03-Dec-18 04:49 AM] axo777#1232
for most shipments we have trailer/container loads that at this time do not have the cargo inside associated with the the shipping unit.  This turns the transportation inside out with very granular visibility of all packages from origin to destination.

[03-Dec-18 04:52 AM] axo777#1232
every small package goes into a larger shipping unit which can be associated with the large shipping unit

[03-Dec-18 04:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you could probably knock up a qr scanner which validates the location with some inbuild anti spoofing stuff.

[03-Dec-18 04:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but i wouldnt rely on 3rd party smartphone apps...

[03-Dec-18 04:55 AM] axo777#1232
There are probably 200+ readers world-wide that send a signal to a nearby computer, but some of those will not know where they are, like readers in a warehouse system

[03-Dec-18 04:57 AM] axo777#1232
the smart phone app would be for the retail consumer to signal they have the "bread" at home and it was fresh.  We will bribe them with a few AXO's for that report

[03-Dec-18 04:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
end user scan not an issue, as by then it's arrived 😃

[03-Dec-18 04:58 AM] axo777#1232
correct

[03-Dec-18 04:59 AM] axo777#1232
where the spoofing comes in is where the criminals steal a complete truck and signal that all is fine

[03-Dec-18 05:00 AM] axo777#1232
dishonest suppliers may be tempted to spoof with bad goods, but that is short lived and a problem for the buyers, not us

[03-Dec-18 05:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll add it to my subconscious while finishing up dragonhound, and see what surfaces.

[03-Dec-18 05:02 AM] axo777#1232
sounds like a plan!

[03-Dec-18 05:05 AM] axo777#1232
I read on Medium that ZKP can make IoT signals invisible with our tech, but James pointed that the code for that is yet to be written.  It is, however, something my users will want when we have it ready for them.

Very big.  Are you interested in this after DragonHound, @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator ?

[04-Dec-18 08:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, always good to build on from where you start... scope is a bit wide for a wageslave to tackle solo though, unless patient enough to get left behind...

[04-Dec-18 08:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
be nice to have my experience as a young fella being a forklift jockey actually end up meaning something too.

[04-Dec-18 08:14 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, this is a big on.  Haha, mine on the other end of the forklift.

[04-Dec-18 08:15 AM] CrisF#3405
I was speaking with someone over here on Saturday about this.

[04-Dec-18 08:15 AM] CrisF#3405
Even full time on this would require a decent support team I figure.

[04-Dec-18 08:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
may as well look ahead to autonomous vehicles etc for delivery. Supply chain wont have much of a human component soon enough

[04-Dec-18 08:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, in forestry in many places now a human hand doesn't touch a tree.  Thi kind of thing applies to much more than just supply chain.

Haha, not yet anyhow.

[04-Dec-18 09:33 AM] CMaurice#1685
yes, interesting, best use of blockchain to my mind, but needs to be many to many to be decentralised. I think most of the corporate supply chain efforts will be interledger-type permissioned chains, but if axo777 has a use case that's awesome

[04-Dec-18 09:34 AM] CMaurice#1685
more than awesome, but those are ambitious specs

[04-Dec-18 09:36 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, that's one of the things I liked about you idea @CMaurice .  You had a specific, attainable use-case as a starting point (cashew farmer).

[04-Dec-18 09:37 AM] CMaurice#1685
right, and I thought that was ambitious

[04-Dec-18 09:37 AM] CrisF#3405
haha

[04-Dec-18 09:37 AM] actionslacks#4072
All it takes is adoption. The consensus is that fiat has value. If that consensus changes, so does the world.

[04-Dec-18 09:39 AM] CrisF#3405
That's what SMK's DragonHound is also.  I've heard of it refered to as a guy tracking his dog.  It's just the first use-case and a good example for marketting. What it really is is the doorway to something very big!

[04-Dec-18 09:40 AM] CrisF#3405
It would be good to hear more from @axo777 about his plan.  There is certainly interest in it here.

[04-Dec-18 09:41 AM] CrisF#3405
@CMaurice Did you have a chance to talk with @gt about the logs/stats chain?

[04-Dec-18 09:41 AM] CMaurice#1685
nope, I like the idea, no idea where to start

[04-Dec-18 09:41 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm wondering if there is anything you need in terms of info?

[04-Dec-18 09:42 AM] CrisF#3405
Sorry, I've been stuck on this website thing.

[04-Dec-18 09:43 AM] CMaurice#1685
Like Alright said, I've read Mastering CC several times and there's somethingI'm just not getting. I thought I should get a domain model then I'd know where to start, but it isn't happening, so should probably jump into testing to start understanding

[04-Dec-18 09:44 AM] CMaurice#1685
didn't even know about that website until the other day, looks great

[04-Dec-18 09:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Testing is what most of the guys have suggested to me.

[04-Dec-18 09:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Let's find out what the requirements for data to be logged from @blackjok3r .  He might have finished by himself already, haha, but it would be a good place to start.

[04-Dec-18 09:47 AM] CrisF#3405
We need a place to work.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  A pad? Google?

[04-Dec-18 09:51 AM] CrisF#3405
@CMaurice This might help.  Tabs down below.

[04-Dec-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sorry what is it your trying to do ? I'm really not sure what even I am supposed to be doinga t the moment. I guess I should start on staking scripts and trying to hunt down exactly why staking with loads of utxos keep corrupting my wallets. I think also we can try to upgrade everythign to the sapling branch. Its not hard forking.
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  you will need a minor update to the pool, alhtough we should try to figure out whats wrong there and get the pool fee code merged in aswell. I can just go ahead and amke the PR and we can try sort it out via DM and git if you like? Seems to be 90% website... maybe just backing up the website folder then merging it and restoring yours is the go, not 100% sure.

[04-Dec-18 11:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I"ve only made minimal mods to weebsite

[04-Dec-18 11:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
whats the problem?

[04-Dec-18 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the merge I oulled in  from webworkers repo made HUGE amount of changes

[04-Dec-18 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you dont mind that then we probably have no issue at all

[04-Dec-18 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the sapling code was in teh stratum... but getting your repo and the stakek repo all ready for launch needs to happen.

[04-Dec-18 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
do cross chain burns work 100% of the time now?

[04-Dec-18 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if not, getting that 100% reliable would be highest priority

[04-Dec-18 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no body had reported any fails

[04-Dec-18 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but tbh I dont know if enough of them ahve been done

[04-Dec-18 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont have my VM to test them atm, as I am mining and staking all the chains

[04-Dec-18 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can set something up to run a few days of migrates tonight I guess.

[04-Dec-18 12:07 PM] CrisF#3405
There are a few people here who said that they would help with that.

[04-Dec-18 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I figured it was workin, and left peopl;e here to test it

[04-Dec-18 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
havent heard anything was broken

[04-Dec-18 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I guess I should confirm myself before making a PR for james

[04-Dec-18 12:09 PM] CrisF#3405
The last I heard were @Bar_F1sh_Rel reports that you saw.  Not sure if he has had any more.

[04-Dec-18 12:10 PM] CrisF#3405
I haven't been migrating on the new chains.
