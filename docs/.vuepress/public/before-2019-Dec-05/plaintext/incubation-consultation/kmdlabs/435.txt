Notary can do this while running - but it will mess with the wallet a bit

[21-Jun-19 08:43 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
- unless it is the notary address you are withdrawing from?

@Exile13 
easiest way is import your wif key on a 2nd node, but if your LABS NN is the only node that run LABS, then here's what I  would do:
- import your WIF with importprivkey.
- send out the necessary LABS amount from your imported address (at this point your wallet has 2 Raddies, 1 is your nota addy and the other is your newly imported, if you use `sendtoaddress` the inputs will be automatically chosen based on your amounts, so to make sure your tx uses the 2nd addy's utxo as input, you have to use `createrawtransaction` , `signrawtransaction` then `sendrawtransaction`) .
- now if you want to remove the 2nd wif key you just imported, stop LABS daemon, delete LABS wallet.dat (back it up first just in case), then relaunch with `./start.sh`

ok, i stopped `StakedNotary`, then installed `staked` imported priv key and sent with success, now i went back to `StakedNotary` to `./start.sh` and the master errors.

[21-Jun-19 10:12 PM] Exile13#4458
i remembered that i had to build zcutil about 2 weeks ago, so i went to `/komodo` and ran `make clean` then `./zcutil/build.sh` and got another error in the `libbitcoin_server_a-miner.o` makefile

need help i broke it

[22-Jun-19 04:57 AM] Exile13#4458
is it because i imported a priv key to `staked`?

[22-Jun-19 05:00 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Exile13 , 
are you on your NN server?

[22-Jun-19 05:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
sometimes you need to  ./start a couple of times. If after 3 attempts, no joy - delete komodo folder to allow fresh rebuild

[22-Jun-19 05:43 AM] Exile13#4458
@CrisF  yes

[22-Jun-19 05:43 AM] Exile13#4458
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator run something like `rm komodo`?

[22-Jun-19 05:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool, did you ./start.sh a few times like smk762 suggested?

[22-Jun-19 05:44 AM] Exile13#4458
`./start.sh` like 4 times now

[22-Jun-19 05:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Are you trying torun `staked` or `StakedNotary`?

[22-Jun-19 05:45 AM] Exile13#4458
`StakedNotary`

[22-Jun-19 05:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool, wasn't sure what you meant here ```stopped StakedNotary, then installed staked imported priv key```

[22-Jun-19 05:47 AM] Exile13#4458
i didnt know if importing a priv key to my NN would mess anything up, so i stopped the NN, installed `staked`, and then imported the priv key there

[22-Jun-19 06:00 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
privkey etc should be in config.ini, and imported auto

[22-Jun-19 06:00 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

`I'm thinking of the environment`
If that's true, then you should be advocating the banning of all SHA256 mining

Cool @Exile13 !  
I've found a couple boards while rearranging things here, so hardware is good.
Figure I'll get them going over the summer, or pick up a non-arm.  Expecting to get some more bandwidth to put to use soon.

how to get the wallet?

[23-Jun-19 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no wallet, need CLI.

[23-Jun-19 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In any case if u have coins why not staking them? You can't do that with a wallet It requires cli

[23-Jun-19 04:50 AM] zaza68#4573
What you mean by CLI ?

[23-Jun-19 05:20 AM] PHBA2061#2530
command line interface or komodo-cli

[23-Jun-19 06:56 AM] PHBA2061#2530

[23-Jun-19 07:17 AM] zaza68#4573

[23-Jun-19 07:21 AM] zaza68#4573

The older Agama it was in had some trouble. The new one was only reacently released. We've been pretty busy with NN season change etc, so a bit behind here. Also, not everyone is awake 24hrs a day.

While I understand that most people never see most things the way I do, here's my unofficial random 2 cents:
I understand that there are investors, markets, and all of that; however,........
LABS is a technical testing ground and if you need a point and click wallet for it, maybe it's not for you ü§∑üèΩ

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[23-Jun-19 08:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
same thing across crypto. Investors resist the tech, just want the `gainz`. LABs is here for those that want to learn, but nothing to stop wallet holders and traders.

[23-Jun-19 08:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you'll get better gainz learning how to stake in CLI and compete in challenges tho

[23-Jun-19 08:13 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
for my other 3 cents, to round it off to a nickle:
If you want to invest in LABS __and__ feel that a GUI wallet is needed, feel free to hire a GUI dev üôÇ

[23-Jun-19 08:15 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
that investment would be greatly appreciated!

[23-Jun-19 08:53 AM] zaza68#4573
smk762 you can stake on agama wallet 2 but did get your piont
ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  feel free to hire a dev team for build a wallet you ar missin a lot there !?!  LABS have a wallet you can download it its calld agama wallet. btw i will never donate to a crypto founder you can better donate the puur people !

[23-Jun-19 08:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
invest != donate
maybe some puur ppl can earn by doing dev ;)
btw, LABs doesnt stake like the KMD 5% rewards. you need to pass the `setgenerate true 0` RPC command

[23-Jun-19 08:56 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`LABS have a wallet you can download it its calld agama wallet.`
