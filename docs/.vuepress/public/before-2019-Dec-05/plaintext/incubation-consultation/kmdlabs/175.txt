nope ... surprised no body reporeted this yet... but anyway hopefully this fixes it.. not sure wat komodo-tx is used for, so am leaving it disabled for now as I dont want to merge everything down at this stage.

[29-Dec-18 01:03 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I haven't been updating pool as often as notary, so wanted to make sure it wasnt just my setup before reporting

[29-Dec-18 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
have massivly corrupted wallets again... goign to try another fix doubtful its going to do anything but worth a try... it will be hours before my nodes have finished fulll rescan... this VM is ona  single HDD very very slow.

[29-Dec-18 01:06 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
does doing sendrawtx work if run on a node different to the one that generated the hex?

[29-Dec-18 01:06 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not sharing pks

[29-Dec-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it will work anywhere

[29-Dec-18 01:06 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
awse, thought so

[29-Dec-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can even use insight explorer to send it

[29-Dec-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
via API

[29-Dec-18 01:07 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
tx already signed

[29-Dec-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... I think that all we need it to create and sign the burn tx

[29-Dec-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the rest of the process can be centrralised on a single set of nodes.

[29-Dec-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just not sure how many parallet pollings a node can take before it just dies on you though

[29-Dec-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
those loops in the script are a bad way of doing it...

[29-Dec-18 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we can use confirmations instead, as confirms = 2 means a notarisation has been made. Not sure if thats any less computation or more for the daemon though

[29-Dec-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
master branch is now in test version, please dont update anything if anyone is around.

found another place with txversion 1, changed it to 4 (the tombstones) not sure if it matters. if it does, then the fix is there

[29-Dec-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I saw. I changed that already aswell

[29-Dec-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It might cause sync issues, will test it shortly

[29-Dec-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tomestone prevents the burn tx being used twice.

[29-Dec-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem to affect anything really.

[29-Dec-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i think they are just imaginary tx, so never actually used for anything other than a marker

[29-Dec-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
all its checking for is if the hash exists

[29-Dec-18 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[29-Dec-18 03:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
@jl777c ever since you traded me that VRSC on BarterDex, since I was using Native and not SPV, I have your VRSC address stuck in my wallet as watch only... and its flodding my tx history lol

[29-Dec-18 03:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
How can I remove that????

[29-Dec-18 03:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
Cant just abandon the wallet there are still coinbases in it

[29-Dec-18 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
i think only way is to make fresh wallet and import just your privkeys

[29-Dec-18 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe good time to consolidate funds

[29-Dec-18 03:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
I figured that but... you cant move coinbase txes that havent matured yet

[29-Dec-18 03:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
and I have several that mature in like 2 years lol

[29-Dec-18 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but you can import the privkey for those coinbase

[29-Dec-18 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
VRSC will then figure out which coinbases are yours

[29-Dec-18 04:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok ill play with that ty

[29-Dec-18 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You can use dumpwallet

[29-Dec-18 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
his private key wont be in it.... make sure its not importing the puklic key again, dump wallet drops a text file only.

[29-Dec-18 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
import it again

[29-Dec-18 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i think only way is to make fresh wallet and import just your privkeys`
yes, that.
You can add watch-only at will, but for whatever reason there's no mechanism to "unwatch", so remake is only option
When I was doing heavy trading on bdex, I did like joker suggested, used dumpwallet (mostly because I kept 3 addys in the same wallet)

[29-Dec-18 05:05 PM] Alright#0419
wasn't that fixed several months ago?

[29-Dec-18 05:06 PM] Alright#0419
didn't think it added watch only addresses to the wallet anymore

[29-Dec-18 05:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Looks like migrates and staking nodes can now be the same nodes... I think with the latest staker that nearly any node that isnt a notary could stake without any real issues... Although controlling the wallet effectivly wouldnt be easy... If it just had butt loads of utxos using it for normal txs would not have too much bad effects on utxo distribution.

[29-Dec-18 05:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Will leave these nodes staking a few days again to see if the latest "fix' for wallet corruption helps. If anything I worked out how to make it print the txids from the wallet on daemon load. if 100% of the time these txs are just not existant, as a work around we can remove those txs on start instead of rescanning.

[29-Dec-18 05:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the default rescan thats triggered does not even fix the wallet.dat. It just wastes many hours.

[29-Dec-18 05:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```error code: -25

Ok well I know that yes. @jl777c  was right. Its allowing you to burn more than you spend. Coins are created it seems, as fees to the miner.

[29-Dec-18 05:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The import tx is still not going to be valid I think... maybe I should try and remove this accepttomemporyt pool check and try and foce it though later validations?

[29-Dec-18 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
for the new selfimport chains, I removed the check for absurd fees already, but only in jl777 branch

[29-Dec-18 11:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
After sleeping on this, I will test with a fixed utxo, trying to import more coins than exported, don't think that will work, making this problem really not a bog deal

[29-Dec-18 11:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just need another check so that this can't be done by the user unless they go modifying source code

[29-Dec-18 11:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
As the coins are exported just not imported at the other end and go to the miner, doesn't appear they are created, and the validation code for import does check the export vins

[30-Dec-18 01:14 AM] CrisF#3405
`coins are exported just not imported at the other end and go to the miner` This brings me bad memories of a certain z_transaction I made...:abusedsmily:

[30-Dec-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Haha

[30-Dec-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That wasn't a fee tho

[30-Dec-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Apparently, didn't check it myself

[30-Dec-18 02:15 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm still wondering about that.  It doesn't show as a fee on explorer :/  ```Fee: 0.0001 KMD ```:5684_Peepo_Goteem:

[30-Dec-18 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well at least the transacion isnt valid.

[30-Dec-18 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just need to work out how exactly to make the export tx invlaid aswell...

[30-Dec-18 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as OP error can easily destroy coins here.

[30-Dec-18 03:59 AM] CrisF#3405
Is there a way I can check ```"txid": "80e8abfb2f01538b3ca824598b76cec25e6400770e9db8e5705a5f4e62ec7f1e"```?

[30-Dec-18 03:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That TX is on CFEK

[30-Dec-18 03:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the top one there is the vout of that tx

[30-Dec-18 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The import tx is totally invalid and fails everything....

[30-Dec-18 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no way you cand invent coins.

[30-Dec-18 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but you can burn them....

[30-Dec-18 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and not recover them.

[30-Dec-18 04:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Is this a new problem?  Or was it there all along?

[30-Dec-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was aleays there... I just never saw it

[30-Dec-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as we used the script.... I never tested things like tryong to burn more than you sepnt... I assumed that it was just adding up vouts

[30-Dec-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but that is not the case

[30-Dec-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as it actually makes the tx and then funds it afterwards...

[30-Dec-18 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
strange way of doing it... but I guess it works.... So juts just need to work out what check has to be there isntead of the stupid one that is there now, that doesnt do anything or work.

[30-Dec-18 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[30-Dec-18 04:11 AM] CrisF#3405
So basically what is happening is coins get burned, import fails, sender sol?

[30-Dec-18 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[30-Dec-18 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know why, but there is a parameteron on convertoexport

[30-Dec-18 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for burn amount... but you already specified this amaount when you created the raw transacion earlier on

[30-Dec-18 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So I just made that parameter ignored

[30-Dec-18 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and added all the vouts up.

[30-Dec-18 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Leaving the parameter there so it doesnt break out existing scripts, but it just does not use  it at all.

[30-Dec-18 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
going to test it now, but from my test just then, needed and burnAmount are always equal exactly using our script... so I will just use the value from the tx, as it should ahve always been doing... Why it was like that has me totally stumped

If anyone wants to test migrates, they should now be working on latest master.

[30-Dec-18 04:41 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm in the process of rearranging nodes and setting up a new system so things are in a serious mess.  Will  give it a shot soon as that's sorted.  Be a while though :/

[30-Dec-18 04:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats cool... sounds like a lot of us have had that problem lately

[30-Dec-18 04:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Mine is pretty decent, but it still needs some work... Have to say tho, having the right system for the job makes a hell of a diffrence to the amount of work you can get done.

[30-Dec-18 04:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And I just restarted my staking nodes on latest... seems so far no walet corruption! 😮

[30-Dec-18 04:48 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, slow process for me, but figure it will pay off.  Trial and error, but learning a lot from it.

[30-Dec-18 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Best way to learn

[30-Dec-18 04:49 AM] CrisF#3405
My main staking node was good while I was away.  Working on getting CFEK back up after reboot.

[30-Dec-18 04:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Still finding my general knowledge base very lacking (better though).  Making it hard to figure what a good setup should look like.  Not sure what I should be really shooting for.

[30-Dec-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would like to do an oracles stress test aswell on CFEK at some point. get 3-4 nodes flooding smk's script.

[30-Dec-18 04:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
which script are you most interested in? I only have the single migrate tui setup right now, not much for flooding, but once it's working for me I'll make it loopy
