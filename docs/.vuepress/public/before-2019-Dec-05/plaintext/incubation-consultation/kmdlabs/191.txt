ComputerGenie, do you know what this is? ```yeah, nothing working though, back to the old PruneBlockIndexCandidates error
Debian Stretch or GCC -v probably the issue```

[04-Jan-19 01:36 PM] gt#2812
cfekx was giving me issues as well earlier

CMaurice is having trouble.

[04-Jan-19 01:38 PM] CMaurice#1685
I should move to Ubuntu

[04-Jan-19 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
OK just set up a pool and its working for me

[04-Jan-19 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```
PruneBlockIndexCandidates
Delete all entries in setBlockIndexCandidates that are worse than the current tip. ```
not sure how that could be OS or gcc isues unless we're talking about building, I'm not seeing the context of error

[04-Jan-19 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah the .pid file is a known problem, I changed it to use that becaue grep for CFEK retunred all CFEK chains, when grepping `ps aux` to see if the daemon had closed... I have a work around to add. doing that next

kk cool thanks @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  gives me something to look for at least

[04-Jan-19 01:40 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
there was a whole bunch of the non canonicals

[04-Jan-19 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that means it created the import tx and it didnt match

[04-Jan-19 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
checking it out... that was an old bug I fixed maybe someone s KMD node is on an old version

[04-Jan-19 01:41 PM] TonyL#3577

[04-Jan-19 01:41 PM] CrisF#3405
@CMaurice Could you please give ComputerGenie some more context.

[04-Jan-19 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fresh sync or you already have chain?

[04-Jan-19 01:45 PM] CMaurice#1685
might have some chain...

[04-Jan-19 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dump it and try with `-zapwallettxes`

[04-Jan-19 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is trying to start just KMD .. .the problem can be fixed with a reindex... download the bootstrap agin... I have no idea what this bug is and I cant rerporduue it

can you run it in `gdb`

[04-Jan-19 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[04-Jan-19 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and do a back trace>?

[04-Jan-19 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if this is on latest pull I miught ahve broken something

[04-Jan-19 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
'reindex'? did you dump data files or just tell it to reindex?

[04-Jan-19 01:48 PM] CMaurice#1685
this has been going on for weeks other than a couple of builds, one upstream, which did work

[04-Jan-19 01:48 PM] CMaurice#1685
rm -rf'd

[04-Jan-19 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok./.. so your just starting a fresh sync and it segfaults with :
`komodod: main.cpp:4088: void PruneBlockIndexCandidates(): Assertion!setBlockIndexCandidates.empty()' failed.`

[04-Jan-19 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or just segfault

[04-Jan-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just changed somethign on laod... it should not affect anything though

[04-Jan-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and wont cause that error

[04-Jan-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that is an old bug in komodod... been reported a hundred times

[04-Jan-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no body has been able to fix it 😦

[04-Jan-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
normally happnes with too little ram

[04-Jan-19 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how much ram do you have @CMaurice ?

[04-Jan-19 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and what do you get from `cat /etc/debian_version`?

[04-Jan-19 01:50 PM] CMaurice#1685
8gb

[04-Jan-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats all I use here on all vms

[04-Jan-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cant be the issue

[04-Jan-19 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[04-Jan-19 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doe sit do it every single time?

[04-Jan-19 01:51 PM] CMaurice#1685
hrm `buster/sid` despite downgrading 😡

[04-Jan-19 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think this is an OS issue

[04-Jan-19 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
usign 16.04 or debian9 on multiple nodes no problems...

[04-Jan-19 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can't downgrade from 10 to 9

[04-Jan-19 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
VULTR VPS's early on did it many many times

[04-Jan-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doing a reindex fixed it... or a bootstrap of chain... it would be good to get a backtrace though maybe I can fix it?

[04-Jan-19 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
P.S. `buster/sid` = 'DebianUnstable'

[04-Jan-19 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pool is working fine here... I used my Knomp fresh install and gencdfg script. turned off payment processing... seems to be finding close to all the blocks atm on X.

[04-Jan-19 01:56 PM] CrisF#3405
@Bar_F1sh_Rel was also having trouble mining.

[04-Jan-19 01:56 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
deleted blocks and chainstate for CFEKX, and kicked it off using listacparams string. now it's looping this like a mofo
`pindexFork->GetHeight().905 is < notarizedht 1025, so ignore it`

[04-Jan-19 01:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`pool is working fine here` so neither chain is the "can't GPU mine" kind? there goes my plans for today ☹

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  that's what I had at block 905/6 in `X`.  Do you also have an error in `getinfo`?

[04-Jan-19 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
going to try a fresh wsync on both chains right now

[04-Jan-19 01:58 PM] CMaurice#1685
yes, I know @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 but I went through a bunch of editing, updating and pinning to get back to Stretch, and after that I got a build to work so assumed I'd done it right

[04-Jan-19 01:58 PM] CMaurice#1685
may well not have though

[04-Jan-19 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if it builds then its unlikely to be OS issue

[04-Jan-19 01:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at the risk of being a dick, is it worth @blackjok3r's time trying to debug an OS frankenbuild?

[04-Jan-19 01:59 PM] CrisF#3405
Me too @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator stopped `X` and restarted then ok for me.

[04-Jan-19 01:59 PM] CMaurice#1685
yeah, I think I should move OS

[04-Jan-19 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this error isnt OS specific its old

[04-Jan-19 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but using the same OS as the res5t of us is preobably a good diea

`this error isnt OS specific its old`
right, but that's what I'm getting at; could it just be due to a jumbled mish-mash of libraries?

[04-Jan-19 02:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that are solved in "stable"

[04-Jan-19 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it could very well be .. wont take long to look at the abck trach tho... I have had this thign haoppen before, and never got a backtrace

[04-Jan-19 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, back to my me question....
neither chain is the "can't GPU mine" kind? 
or is that still your template using stratum?

[04-Jan-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
these 2 chains are just standard pow with a BR

you can pay it to script with ac_script
