there is a clear advantage to receiving the blocks first

[11-Dec-18 08:02 PM] Alright#0419
doing `-connect=<NN IP>` on a stratum will increase your notarization count

[11-Dec-18 08:04 PM] Alright#0419
Joker and I talked about launch yesterday. Plan is wait for sapling hard fork on KMD, stress test the *fuck* out of momom then launch

[11-Dec-18 08:04 PM] Alright#0419
the only thing we need to do in the mean time is figure out notary change mechanism

[11-Dec-18 08:05 PM] Alright#0419
I like 75% of top performing notaries stay, other 25% of slots are chosen provably randomly based on who signs up

That fits with the single data-centre scenario (depending on the definition of 'top').

[11-Dec-18 08:52 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
But I can't see how to reliably prove geographical diversity

[11-Dec-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
ping time is not the only factor

[11-Dec-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
notarization happens on a 10 second cycle

[11-Dec-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
unless your ping time is measured in seconds, that is not any critical factor

`there is a clear advantage to receiving the blocks first

doing that, literally, does nothing

[11-Dec-18 10:15 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
that's actually what I did, my NN was my only peer, no blocks existed that my NN didn't see before every other node, and I still had 0 notarizations on that chain in over 4 hrs

[11-Dec-18 10:42 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 what I said is based on when joker was doing it to his KMD notary

[11-Dec-18 10:42 PM] Alright#0419
was mining assetchains with GPUs with `-connect` to his notary, and it seemed to increase notarization counts

[11-Dec-18 10:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No, @Alright  it does not make a lot of difference

[11-Dec-18 10:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
As far as I can tell there is some other factor, you need to entre recv mask consistently the fastest, that means ping time, and a very very fast ram bus speed along with a clean wallet. The two limiting things are, clean wallet (and system speed) then ping time.

[11-Dec-18 10:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The slowness from having too many utxo and a bloated wallet full of old txs far out weights ping time quite fast.

[11-Dec-18 10:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 your notary is at your actual house on DSL yes?

[11-Dec-18 10:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That will be the limiting factor

[11-Dec-18 11:42 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@blackjok3r no, my NN in on a vultr hosted vps in texas

[11-Dec-18 11:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
OK, its clear then @SHossain  is cheating :P

[11-Dec-18 11:43 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
lol

[11-Dec-18 11:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Getting all the blocks first without getting those blocks to 6 other nodes before the rest of them it offers no advantage.

[11-Dec-18 11:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You need 6 nodes to sign with you, in fact getting all the blocks first without a hyper connected node is worse for counts than not.

[11-Dec-18 11:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The number 3 factor appears to be being hyper connected. So software optimisations, hardware speed, network ping, connectivity

[11-Dec-18 11:46 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I haven't looked, are NNs defaulting to listen=1?

[11-Dec-18 11:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Some have poets open others dont

[11-Dec-18 11:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried forcing over 50 connection out

[11-Dec-18 11:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Without very very good hardware that's. Bad idea

[11-Dec-18 11:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'd say with 10gbit network and very fast CPUs etc it might work tho

[11-Dec-18 11:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ours are mostly closed ports, mine is open as a seed, you can try that, the idea is to be a centralised network hub, so u can reach consensus the fastest

[11-Dec-18 11:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Or thats how shossain appears to be doing it, unless head just got a cheat lol

[11-Dec-18 11:50 PM] SHossain#0007
@blackjok3r how did you find out?

[11-Dec-18 11:50 PM] SHossain#0007
I'm not even touching the node

[11-Dec-18 11:50 PM] SHossain#0007
once a day i check `./stats`

[11-Dec-18 11:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Your in tooany notariaatios for it to be random

[11-Dec-18 11:51 PM] Alright#0419
was thinking maybe his IP is in KMD DNS seeder

[11-Dec-18 11:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I ahven not checked, but someone said 99%

[11-Dec-18 11:51 PM] SHossain#0007
I'm using a 2 core VPS

[11-Dec-18 11:51 PM] Alright#0419
it's not 99%, but it is statically significant

[11-Dec-18 11:51 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
out of like 50, he missed 1

[11-Dec-18 11:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yep, that doesn't seem rigjt

[11-Dec-18 11:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Or its something g we don't want, no matter who it is... If that was me I'd like to slow it down

[11-Dec-18 11:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But need to work out why, and not cripple it, but bring others up

[11-Dec-18 11:52 PM] SHossain#0007
my ip is not in DNS seeder

[11-Dec-18 11:52 PM] Alright#0419
his node has slowed down a lot recently

Software optimisations is number 1 factor in my experience but they are all basically defeated on in staked notary,

[11-Dec-18 11:55 PM] Alright#0419
can be cheated atm, but I'm assuming people didn't spam RXL from their notary address

[11-Dec-18 11:55 PM] Alright#0419
for now that is

[11-Dec-18 11:55 PM] Alright#0419

But there ate advantages we want to mitigate

[11-Dec-18 11:57 PM] SHossain#0007
not even with mainnet

[11-Dec-18 11:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
To do that we need to work them out

[11-Dec-18 11:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So everyone is on level playing feild

[11-Dec-18 11:57 PM] Alright#0419
SHo, the problem is that everyone will try to replicate exactly what you are doing

[11-Dec-18 11:57 PM] Alright#0419
and we'll end up with every single node in that same DC

so we want to nerf any advantage it might have, but we can't pin point what that advantage is
