is there much difference performance wise with 2 vs 3? @blackjok3r

[12-Feb-19 05:17 PM] Alright#0419
2 being reorg is not impossible, just unlikely

[12-Feb-19 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can make it like 50 with no pref hit, just uses a few more KB of ram

[12-Feb-19 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and make the code look messy as fuck

[12-Feb-19 05:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh there seems to be a state saved for MoMoM with isnt even being used.... if I remove that..... it could go back hundreds of notas... with no ram increase even

Figure ComputerGenie's is the best of the choices. 
For someone seeing the logo or icon for the first time, on an exchange or something, that might give a little better idea of what we do (eg. experiment etc.)

[12-Feb-19 09:06 PM] CrisF#3405
Rocket seems better than astronaut for that purpose but cliche. (human aspect-the window, hardware/practical use-rocket, code dev-brackets, potential-rocket)

[12-Feb-19 09:08 PM] CrisF#3405
Which gives the best idea to someone with no knowledge of KMD / Labs and might get them to want to know more?

I've got it up and staking along, just figured worth sharing. Can fund whoever wants to stake. It's a temporary chain, I burnt half the supply already 😄

Pushed update for ORKL chain to be STAKED=1 😃

[14-Feb-19 04:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
still -ac_staked=99? I'm confused?

[14-Feb-19 04:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
no worries on respawn tho, cos while I was tryna get the nodes to sync I managed to rm -rf half the supply when clearing blocks on a forked node

[14-Feb-19 04:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry that value it internal to the daemon

[14-Feb-19 04:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
probably should change it, but ti rename everything to LABS or something more descriptive is going to take a fairly long time... hasnt been a prority

[14-Feb-19 04:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I think I remember now... thats how we indeicated it was a staked assetchain, not a kmd asset chain or something

[14-Feb-19 04:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
using differnt branch

[14-Feb-19 04:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. we have staked =1 for chains with block reward staked =2 for chains without one, and CFEK and TEST as 3/4

[14-Feb-19 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
255 is banned... no notarizations

Any way to ensure that notarised chains always have the ac_notarypay - or is that something we don't want??

[14-Feb-19 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
umm no I dont think we should force it... Just check manually if its there or not. Just added ac_notary pay to eras. 
Will launch a chain to test this soon. It will die if the new code doesnt stop Alrights attack.... So probably just have 3 eras reasonable close together to verify that it works.

[14-Feb-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant 
I have just updated with 2 new chains, and killed all the rest. Not sure what ones could sync and what couldn't. These two chains are on notarypay_new branch for those of you not using the staked or StakedNotary repos. I wont be merging this code to master until its verified to work. There are 2 chains, one with eras and one without. We need to make sure CFEKDEAD is notarized before block 3000 and the era changes. Once thats verified to work, Alright can attack it. 
If the attack still can cause the chain to fork (not sync) the only other fix I can add is to  add the notarized txid to the checkpoint data. Then the calculation for this can check if the notarization exists in its current chain or not. This will make sure the chain syncs 100% of the time under attack conditions.
Problem we are trying to solve here is the following:
Someone 100% attacks a chain, and mines a block with a notarization, then reorgs it out of their chain, then confirms a later notarization. This has the effect of creating a checkpoint on nodes who are online when the reorg happens (and receive the block) But then when they sync the chain this checkpoint no longer exists as it sees, the later notarization first.

With the bug fixed to only allow 1 notarization per block, and the mining code choosing always the oldest notarization in its mempool, it should now be quite safe from this attack. I also delayed the calcuation for notary pay by a checkpoint. So that the amount paid is now calculated from the previous notarized height and the notarized height previous to that again. Really this attack is a death blow to notarizations, So to prevent this, we need to use PoS% and never let a situation where a chain has only a single miner who controlls what the chain is. 0BR chains, so far have never been attacked in this way. Another "fix" is to remove invalidateblock from the daemon to stop ppl doing it so easilty 😆

`never let a situation where a chain has only a single miner who controlls what the chain is. `

[14-Feb-19 10:16 AM] jorian#4555
at that point you're basically running your own database

[14-Feb-19 10:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol... well r3eally as long as there is people minigna dn staking a chain at all... the attack catn really work

[14-Feb-19 10:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it requires you have 100% of the hash power which is why PoS mitagates it somewhat.

[14-Feb-19 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a ridicuous attack.. expensive on chain with hashrate and it gains no economic benefit to the attacker, just stops the chain working at all until the attack stops... Like no notarizations can happen, if hte only moner wont mine them. this has always been the case.

[14-Feb-19 10:19 AM] jorian#4555
so as long as we have some miners and some stakers. i think anyone wanting a chain should at least be able to get some sort ofm ining going. on their own chain.

[14-Feb-19 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
agreed.

[14-Feb-19 10:20 AM] jorian#4555
i guess we need to update now then?
