Blackjok3r's post just above has some good info üëÜ

[04-Nov-18 07:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Also he posted 2 migration scripts to try out.

[04-Nov-18 07:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Alright would like us to report any failed migrates.

[04-Nov-18 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes migrates are the priotity, we already found one more small bug.

[04-Nov-18 08:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
MLT was crashed for me just then guys, ... im rebuilding it, please report if it crashes for you.

[04-Nov-18 08:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
still up on both of mine. just notice notary still running stakedb1 lol

[04-Nov-18 08:11 AM] CrisF#3405
hah

[04-Nov-18 08:24 AM] CrisF#3405
When I start MLT it stops here and doesn't move ```finished loading blocks CFEKMLT
k mined, try again                                                           ‚îÇRA3nrkHEbJkhR2yK5maX2WhyT1TjbE```

[04-Nov-18 08:26 AM] CrisF#3405
No notarization on that chain for an hour or so either.

[04-Nov-18 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah somethignhappend to it

[04-Nov-18 08:28 AM] CrisF#3405
MLT ```2018-11-04 08:23:52 socket recv error Connection reset by peer (104)```

[04-Nov-18 08:28 AM] CrisF#3405
and many connection refused errors from vorious ips

[04-Nov-18 08:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I just restarted mine and it seems ok.

[04-Nov-18 08:29 AM] CrisF#3405
I have too, but that's after a re-start also

[04-Nov-18 08:29 AM] CrisF#3405
will try again.

[04-Nov-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Heap of imports just clearned for me then

[04-Nov-18 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That branch has the FSM mempool fix for KMDICE

[04-Nov-18 08:31 AM] CrisF#3405
Nice.  I haven't had one yet :/

[04-Nov-18 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I really didnt want to merge it to all of them, so be have sometjing to compare against

[04-Nov-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So far libscotts branch seems the best for me ... The slesgehammer approach is üëå

[04-Nov-18 08:32 AM] CrisF#3405
Mine are all hanging after import transaction success  or signing on kmd.

[04-Nov-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm ... weird mine are good

[04-Nov-18 08:33 AM] CrisF#3405
Wonder what's up.  I removed and re started komodo.

[04-Nov-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I used the `staked` repo to start all chains, then just hit them with loops CFEK -> all

[04-Nov-18 08:33 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm using staked.

[04-Nov-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[04-Nov-18 08:37 AM] CrisF#3405
Is it possible to copy the komodo from NN into `staked`?

[04-Nov-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can i guess but it shoudl just be master branch

[04-Nov-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the staked repo does not start KMD automatically

[04-Nov-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you nede to enter the komodo/master folsder and call it

[04-Nov-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`./komodod`

[04-Nov-18 08:44 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm running komodod from github.  Will do from master folder instead. thx.

[04-Nov-18 09:09 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
So... is shielding from coinbase not required on these chains?

[04-Nov-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No dont need that, and also there is no blcok maturity

[04-Nov-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can send them right away.

[04-Nov-18 09:10 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
migration is sooo slooow on my VM

[04-Nov-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
migtration is always slow

[04-Nov-18 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a very complicated process ..

[04-Nov-18 09:29 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r my staked/komodo doesn't have the `libscottFIX`

[04-Nov-18 09:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Should that be in there?

[04-Nov-18 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEKLF should be using that branch.. its not a consensus change, so other branches wpould peobably work..

[04-Nov-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but to test the diffrent fixes properly, I needed a control and a few other things

[04-Nov-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was hopeing things would be stable, and i caould just leave it migrating for 3 days and look at the data üòÇ

[04-Nov-18 09:31 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, so was I!

[04-Nov-18 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
FSM crashing is a bit of a worry, but it ocould litterally be anything

[04-Nov-18 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we dont need that branch for staked I dont think...

[04-Nov-18 10:06 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
the start.sh scripts created ``libscottFIX`` branch folder for me in staked.

[04-Nov-18 10:23 AM] CMaurice#1685
Managed to mv Komodo and start.sh before had to go out

[04-Nov-18 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you will notice that branch appears to prit way more erros on MoMoM imports ... but its not.. .we just need to change what its saying. 
What happend on the old tests what the MoMoM hash on the target chain couldnt be found, so now it looks for the KMD txid height, then scans 100 block alla round it until it gets a match  .. not very eleagent but at least it appears to work 100% of the time now.

Staked repo seems to be working smoothly for me.

[04-Nov-18 11:05 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Just need a pubkey / pubkey adding for stakednotary

[04-Nov-18 11:28 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Ahh - lol - Apart from my CFEKMLT branch is not syncing @blackjok3r

[04-Nov-18 11:37 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I have a bunch of "Connection refused" (x6) in the logfile.

[04-Nov-18 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That branch has issues... just started it in GDB here ... hope it helps

[04-Nov-18 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems to get into a dead lock ... its not crashing asd such.

[04-Nov-18 12:25 PM] CrisF#3405
Is that the FSM chain?

[04-Nov-18 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes

[04-Nov-18 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont really need to do it doe a crazy amount of time... I might stop that one playing up and slow mine down a little bit and just leave it going util it breaks

[04-Nov-18 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Hope fully it doesnt break.

I have finally figured out how to get komdod staked version to actually work preoperly ...

[04-Nov-18 12:29 PM] CrisF#3405
It would be interesting to see a visualization of the cluster in action.

[04-Nov-18 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah we need to get someone to make an explorer for multi chains

[04-Nov-18 12:29 PM] CrisF#3405
What was wrong with it?

[04-Nov-18 12:30 PM] CrisF#3405
(komodod)

[04-Nov-18 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It ws just a horroble hack, where the pubkeys were copied into a part of the memory that tricked it into ntarising

[04-Nov-18 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Now it actualyl identifies your -pubkey

[04-Nov-18 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wether your KMD or a staked chain

[04-Nov-18 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and when the eras change, your node wil autromatically know its not a ntoary any more

[04-Nov-18 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Should allow us to make CC contracts for NN, such aspay per notaisation,as ther eis alwaays an array with all the ntoary R address avalible now

[04-Nov-18 12:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I couldnt use the original pubkeymethod in KMD, as we need tohat to work for KMD

[04-Nov-18 12:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or KMD wouldnt have dpow

[04-Nov-18 12:32 PM] CrisF#3405
Cool üíØ

[04-Nov-18 01:01 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
MLT still can't get any connections on a restart - might have to leave that one for a bit.

Great im getting som well needed sleep ..

[04-Nov-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hve fun guys.. I will levae my migrate scitps going

[04-Nov-18 05:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r i am interested in creating valid notarization data in regtest mode, so that automated tests for dpowconfs can be written. I am interested in solving this for KMD+AC's and external coins as well. Currently I am trying to test that dpowconfs work correctly in Hush, but KMD itself could also use dpowconf tests, as well as any coin that adds DPoW

[04-Nov-18 05:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r it seems like you may already have a solution to this, so I wanted to ask your opinion. If not, it seems that the list of notary pubkeys must take into account NetworkID, and if it's not mainnet, we list at least 13 pubkeys with known private keys, that can be imported in regtest mode

[05-Nov-18 12:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@dukeleto  
Had to have a nice long sleep. back today for a while, I think what I have might be useful for that, but also maybe its not. On the weekend I finally managed to get my staked notary keys working 100x better than before. They now change with era, and hte notary can identify itself, this will be helpful for many things, and the PIRATE exception for ntoary vouts, cna now be used over eras, or pubkey changes without issue. Before this was hard coded into the current elected keys. I will be testing today and publishing this code later on, maybe it will help you. I will add some more coments to it, so others can see how I managed to get it working. 

For regtest... all you should have to do its look where its doing (is_STAKED) funtion in komodo_notary.h and add another IF statment after that for regtest and its keys.

[05-Nov-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thoe other problem your going to face is how to get notarisations into regtest mode...

[05-Nov-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe add a notarisation tx to every mined block ?

[05-Nov-18 02:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r i am thinking about saving the raw transactions, and then broadcasting them in regtest + mining them, when the test runs

{Reactions}
üëç 

[05-Nov-18 02:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's OK to have the same exact notarization data each test run

[05-Nov-18 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Report on my migrates so far is GOOD NEWS!
CFEKED : 2985 confirmed import, with 0 fails
CFEKING: 2939 confirmed import, with 1 fail reported, but this was a false positive, checking the tx only rports its already in blockchain.
CFEKLF:  3009 confimed import with 0 fails.
CFEKMLT:  2216 confirmed import, with 159 reported fails... but this daemon crashed/locked up so its not really accuurate.

All you need is that, add a check for regtest and use a diffrent array of keys.

[05-Nov-18 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To get notarisations to be valid, that was the only change I needed to make to staked KMD

[05-Nov-18 02:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So from this data so far, we can conclude that libscotts fix isnt required... but I think we need more data to know for sure. Also we know that FSM equal branch has problems, this mught help KMDICE tracking down the issue they have there.

[05-Nov-18 08:41 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r Hi, I'm using the migrations scripts you posted above.  Many have gone through and I have the `log_seq`.  Randomly opening a few hasn't found any failures.
I was wondering how you check for failed transactions?

[05-Nov-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
any thing it has that failed is printed in the folder you called it from

[05-Nov-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in a file called FAILED
