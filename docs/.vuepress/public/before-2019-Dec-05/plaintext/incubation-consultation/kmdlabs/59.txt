I have some space and compute spare for a node or three, or a notary when you are ready - what git repo are you using?

[01-Nov-18 06:27 AM] CMaurice#1685
rubs eyes, tries to catch up

[01-Nov-18 06:27 AM] Alright#0419
just look at github.com/StakedChain

[01-Nov-18 06:27 AM] Alright#0419
there are a few repos for different things

[01-Nov-18 06:27 AM] Alright#0419
StakedChain/staked for normal end user

[01-Nov-18 06:27 AM] Alright#0419
StakedChain/StakedNotary for notary

[01-Nov-18 06:27 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
OK - That was the one I have been running STAKEDED from

[01-Nov-18 06:28 AM] Alright#0419
StakedChain/staked needs some TLC

[01-Nov-18 06:28 AM] Alright#0419
but it kind of works üòÖ

[01-Nov-18 06:28 AM] Alright#0419
we'll have it touched up by launch

[01-Nov-18 06:29 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I'll take a look for updates when I get back from work later

[01-Nov-18 06:29 AM] Alright#0419
note to self: let joker do most git things

[01-Nov-18 06:29 AM] Alright#0419
üò´

[01-Nov-18 06:30 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Was about to look at the notary stuff now I am happy with single asset chains

[01-Nov-18 06:30 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
but work calls - so laters

[01-Nov-18 06:33 AM] gt#2812
so you're going to launch new chains in assetchains via stakednotary?

[01-Nov-18 06:35 AM] gcharang#6833
@Alright  is a notary spot free now?

[01-Nov-18 06:35 AM] Alright#0419
Yes, pretty sure we're going to have to cap it though

[01-Nov-18 06:35 AM] Alright#0419
20 seems a reasonable max

[01-Nov-18 06:36 AM] gcharang#6833
Can you add me: 024ce12f3423345350d8535e402803da30abee3c2941840b5002bf05e88b7f6e2d
And give me links for what to run

[01-Nov-18 06:36 AM] Alright#0419
that would mean average notary gets 2000 STAKED/month + whatever minimum of STAKED they set to notarize chains

[01-Nov-18 06:36 AM] Alright#0419
with 20

[01-Nov-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not rushing this, even if it takes all day to do it right

[01-Nov-18 06:36 AM] gt#2812
let me know if u need a pubkey

[01-Nov-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright can make the chains, but we wont start notarising until everything is ready

[01-Nov-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so we can add pubkeys to testnet i a few hours time

[01-Nov-18 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is TONNES of git commits and branches to be sorted ... and git is playing up since microsoft took it over :trollface:

{Reactions}
üëç 

[01-Nov-18 06:38 AM] Alright#0419
just utterly fucked one of our branches

[01-Nov-18 06:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its ok, it was just my branch... tbh it was already pretty fucked

[01-Nov-18 06:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will just make a new one, and we can clean out all the unused brnaches next week once we have things working good on testnet

[01-Nov-18 06:38 AM] Alright#0419
I'm starting chains on master

[01-Nov-18 06:38 AM] Alright#0419
let me know when bj branch is ready for a chain

[01-Nov-18 06:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes master is good as long as we dont notariese we can change publeys

[01-Nov-18 06:39 AM] Alright#0419
did you flip it back to era 1?

[01-Nov-18 06:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no acutally havent do that yet

[01-Nov-18 06:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and era 4 cant have that long left

[01-Nov-18 06:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will do that now

[01-Nov-18 06:41 AM] Alright#0419
can you make era 1 relatively short

[01-Nov-18 06:41 AM] Alright#0419
like 1-2 days

[01-Nov-18 06:42 AM] Alright#0419
then era 2 a week or so

[01-Nov-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just set them all for 2 years

[01-Nov-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can... but we cna change them when we chage pubkeys

[01-Nov-18 06:43 AM] Alright#0419
I have people giving me pubkeys right now that I'd like to add

[01-Nov-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or we cna define them now and change the pubkeys alter

[01-Nov-18 06:43 AM] Alright#0419
but not immediately

[01-Nov-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
era 1 = 2 days

[01-Nov-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
era 2 = 2 weeks

[01-Nov-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
3 + 4 = 1 year apart

[01-Nov-18 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[01-Nov-18 06:44 AM] Alright#0419
and era 2 can be changed while we're still in era 1, yes?

[01-Nov-18 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they can be changed, you just need to change the staked protocol version when you do it

[01-Nov-18 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[01-Nov-18 06:44 AM] Alright#0419
so we can launch this with current pubkeys then add whoever within the next 2 days

[01-Nov-18 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, and once they are all added, you change the timestamp

[01-Nov-18 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and protocol verison

[01-Nov-18 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and any node what didnt update just get cut of from netowkr

[01-Nov-18 06:45 AM] Alright#0419
great

[01-Nov-18 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
needs to be tested... Iwill just leave them all for 2 years.

[01-Nov-18 06:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as we canot know exactly when they will occur... the point is to just add the pubeys and then change activation time at the same time

[01-Nov-18 06:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the onyl reason 4 is there, was because its a shittly way to code it and adding one manually each time, was a PITA so i just added 4 as default. util i can change how it works to somehting better

[01-Nov-18 06:47 AM] Alright#0419
I have a feeling first pubkey change on mainnet will be a true clusterfuck üòÖ

[01-Nov-18 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah preobbly ... hopefully I can get the new era changes working before then... makig the streamer taught me half of the needed cpode

[01-Nov-18 06:47 AM] CrisF#3405

[01-Nov-18 07:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No

[01-Nov-18 07:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oe of the freq should be 5 and 1 10

[01-Nov-18 07:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the one thats 5 should be FSM_mempooltest

[01-Nov-18 07:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not blackjok3r

[01-Nov-18 07:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Yea :/ sorry

[01-Nov-18 07:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and so it this one, atm ... merge conflift fucked it lol

[01-Nov-18 07:08 AM] Alright#0419

[01-Nov-18 07:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
royally

[01-Nov-18 07:08 AM] Alright#0419
or how that freaking happened

[01-Nov-18 07:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no it did something again to me just then

[01-Nov-18 07:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I used atom to choose fix conflicts

[01-Nov-18 07:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it removed a whole bunch of lines n shit

[01-Nov-18 07:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wont compile lol

[01-Nov-18 07:08 AM] Alright#0419
atom is god awful

[01-Nov-18 07:09 AM] Alright#0419
holy shit do I hate atom

[01-Nov-18 07:09 AM] Alright#0419
"open this single file please"

[01-Nov-18 07:09 AM] Alright#0419
ok wait while I scan your entire HDD please

[01-Nov-18 07:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol...

[01-Nov-18 07:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I probably will stop using it soon, only was using because it does code syntax for you.. tyope if and get the whole stament and fill in what you want for example ...

[01-Nov-18 07:20 AM] CMaurice#1685
so, what'll be a good strategy for restart: fresh machine, move all STAKED* from .komodo, or rm StakedNotary and reclone

[01-Nov-18 07:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its just a normal update, as the onyl thinc changed is assetchains.json

[01-Nov-18 07:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
best is to `stop.sh`

[01-Nov-18 07:22 AM] CMaurice#1685
oh, heh

[01-Nov-18 07:22 AM] CMaurice#1685
thanks

[01-Nov-18 07:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then get the assetchains.json

[01-Nov-18 07:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then start again

[01-Nov-18 07:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that should be it

[01-Nov-18 07:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless the start script has bugs

[01-Nov-18 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you want to save space you can clear old chains from .komodo

[01-Nov-18 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but no need to, they have new names

[01-Nov-18 07:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Ill be bk in home in 45. Need to refresh pubkey before launch, but happy to use current for testnet
