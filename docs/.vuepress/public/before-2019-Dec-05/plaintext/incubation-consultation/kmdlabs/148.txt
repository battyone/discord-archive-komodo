that notarisaion is no longer valid *

[06-Dec-18 01:22 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I'm not chainging it, I'm going back to the same block

[06-Dec-18 01:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont understant what your trying to do

[06-Dec-18 01:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can make a PoW only chain

[06-Dec-18 01:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for yo uto do this on

[06-Dec-18 01:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[06-Dec-18 01:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Please if you can break dPoW do so

[06-Dec-18 01:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright has been trying for like a year

[06-Dec-18 01:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and cannot do it

[06-Dec-18 01:24 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I'll have a PoC by Moday, my next 3 days are overpacked

a notrisaion is a check point.. once its validated  then the chain cannot reorg back past that point as far as I am aware what this means, is the you wait for a notarision before a tx is confirmed

`a notrisaion is a check point.. once its validated then the chain cannot reorg back past that point as far as I am aware what this means, is the you wait for a notarision before a tx in confirmed`
in "normal mode"
block 1
block 2
block 3 with tx
block 4
block 5
block 6
block 7
block  8 with tx
block 9
block 10
block 11
block 12
block 13 with tx

[06-Dec-18 01:26 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
yes?

[06-Dec-18 01:30 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
What stops me from:
block 1
block 2
block 3 without tx
block 4
block 5
block 6
block 7
block 8 spend
block 9
block 10
block 11
block 12-150
rewind
block 3 with tx
block 4
block 5 ds

[06-Dec-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I know what your trying to say but its a little more complicated that that the top one is more like this:
in "normal mode"
block 1
block 2
block 3 with tx - check point at block 1
block 4
block 5
block 6
block 7
block  8 with tx - checkpoint at block 6
block 9
block 10
block 11
block 12
block 13 with tx - checkpoint at block 11
Also if a notarisaion is confirmed out of order, the one which is older block hash is ignored ... in this case I  am not sure that matters exactly as your proposing a 100% attack and i dont think there is really anyhting that cna be done if someone has 100% of the hash power of a chain.

[06-Dec-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
However with just 1% of the hash power

[06-Dec-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will eventually mine one of those notarisiaons and create a check point.

[06-Dec-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The chain that is not notrised is not notarised .. and if the chain has very low hash power.... then anyone not waiting for a notrisation for a large amount of funds is quite foolish.

[06-Dec-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In your second example ... all you did was double spend on an un notrised chain

[06-Dec-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If youchanged the block 1, then the notrisation tx included in block 3 is now invlaid.

[06-Dec-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
At worst with this attack is your making the chain totally unusable until you stop doing it

[06-Dec-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and at best, someone mines 1 notarisation tx and creates a checkpoint... also constantly reorginf hte chain will probably stop the notary nodes reeaching consesnus until you stop doing it... so while your trying to do this, there will be no new notarisations happening.

[06-Dec-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
While this attack is possible, I dont really see it a that large of a problem as its a lot of effort for not a lot of gain other then being a dick and pissing people off.

[06-Dec-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
One thing I did discuss with Alright once, was that your could constantly force 1-3 bock reorgs ... over and over

[06-Dec-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that would stop the notary nodes every making any notarisions at all.

[06-Dec-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But he said hte logistics of that are all but impossible and it doesnt really achive anything.

[06-Dec-18 02:23 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`In your second example ... all you did was double spend on an un notrised chain`
exactly my point and why I don't understand why NNs preform 0 blocking and how they are effective in any way, shape, or form in real-world cases if all they do is chuck a tx into the mempool that can be completely ignored

[06-Dec-18 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You wait for a notarisation

[06-Dec-18 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[06-Dec-18 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ON KMD ... they do mine blocks, and then would include them

[06-Dec-18 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but on any ohter chain ...

[06-Dec-18 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[06-Dec-18 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You would need ALL miners to collude to stop this attack though

[06-Dec-18 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The standard mining code in the daemon (on staked version of komodo) forces every notarisaion to be maximum priority

[06-Dec-18 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it only requires a single miner

[06-Dec-18 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
using theis code ...

[06-Dec-18 02:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even of somene spams the mempool FULL of txs with a ridiculous fee

[06-Dec-18 02:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they notrisation is maximum priority

[06-Dec-18 02:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe james might eb able to explain it better... but in my experiance dPoW works just fine

[06-Dec-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to do a doubele spend ... you would need 100% of the hash power

[06-Dec-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
of the real chain

[06-Dec-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
AND more than that to mine a longer chain

[06-Dec-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not reeally practical

[06-Dec-18 02:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the notary nodes ... mined a block to create a checkpoint then your removing the consensus between them... that doesnt make a lot of sense

[06-Dec-18 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
may as well have some GOD node ... that just mines a block every 5 blocks and determines hte real chain... that doesnt seem very decentralised at all .

[06-Dec-18 04:44 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`to do a doubele spend ... you would need 100% of the hash power`
You really don't, you just need 4-6x whatever the network is and a fast enough pool with enough connections to lag anyone else
100% in theory, but more like 80-90% in practice

[06-Dec-18 04:49 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
side note: the explorer seems broken

[06-Dec-18 04:55 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 how can you get something of value for coins on your own private fork?

[06-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Alright#0419
`block 12-150
 rewind`

[06-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Alright#0419
nothing

[06-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Alright#0419
but if that chain is private the entire time, you can't get anything of value for the coins on it

[06-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Alright#0419
if that chain is not private, it will be notarized

[06-Dec-18 05:08 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
It's not "private" when peers follow it
it's not "notarized" if the block-maker refuses to add the notarization tx
ergo, it's neither private or notarized

[06-Dec-18 05:16 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
in an ideal world, everyone follows the rules
I'm simply pointing out that if one chooses not to follow the rule and NN don't actually produce blocks, then it's an easily broken system because there's no forced enforcement of the rules
If CHAINX only has 1 pool and I can outblock that pool then I'm free to make as many blocks as I wish and at any point I can roll back the chain to the point where I refused to add the notarization and add it and they are forced to accept it because tx=notarized

[06-Dec-18 05:16 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
at that point anything spent after the ignored tx block and before the rollback is voided

[06-Dec-18 05:21 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`if that chain is not private, it will be notarized`
Only if someone else blocks the tx I ignored, as I said, it doesn't actually take 100% of the hash to make 100% of the blocks in a given timeframe

[06-Dec-18 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
Ah right, I see what you're saying

[06-Dec-18 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
this was discussed before

[06-Dec-18 05:25 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
at least 16 peers are like 14 blocks ahead of the explorer

[06-Dec-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the explorer can be ignored

[06-Dec-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[06-Dec-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have been blocking a bunch of blocks with a NULL script pubkey

[06-Dec-18 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not sure if thats a consensus breaking thing

[06-Dec-18 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or what .. but until i fugure it out ... the chain should be considered dead 游땍

[06-Dec-18 05:27 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
ok, now that at least one of you understands what I was saying, I'm off to 游눣

[06-Dec-18 05:45 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 I don't think that could ever be used in a practical attack

[06-Dec-18 05:45 AM] Alright#0419
only takes a single honest miner to thwart the whole thing

[06-Dec-18 05:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
definatly another easter egg by mike here

[06-Dec-18 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the block template is fetched with stake mode active it retunrs a null pubkey

[06-Dec-18 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which means you MUST stake with -pubkey set

[06-Dec-18 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which amkes no sense at all

[06-Dec-18 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
fixing btw ... very easy fix

[06-Dec-18 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  You might want to change this upstream ... merging such a simple change from our branch is hard ...

[06-Dec-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you want to fix this line: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/FSM/src/miner.cpp#L1444
I think fixing this means that weird thing at the end here should just be a `0`

There are also things broken elsewhere to do with staking I have slowly been fixing but I lost track of it ... mostly CLI calls not doing whats expected

I always thought that adding a tx later on world change the block, and you'd have to rework the chain from that point

[06-Dec-18 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
How do you mean? The coinbase was bein mined to a null pubkey burning all the minted coins
