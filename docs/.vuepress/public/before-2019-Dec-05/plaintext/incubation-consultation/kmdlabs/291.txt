I willl have new chains up in a while

[15-Feb-19 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sorry... But this got out of hand complicated to gaurd against some theoretical attack. The only way to do this properly is to have undefined coin emission..

[15-Feb-19 02:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Notaries will be paid X coins when they make a notarisation as long as it has the required inputs (a notary cannot sign twice) and is an OP_RETURN containing a valid block height and hash. 
It no longer matters what order notarizations occur. Because if reorgs happen, some notarizations that create a valid checkpoint dont actaully exist in the chain at all. Which is not something I thaught was possible when I started on this.

[15-Feb-19 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Always learning... Its not al bad, there were amny imporvments to the overall code and how it works.. I dint actually ahve to remove a lot. Took about an hour.

[15-Feb-19 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Basically removing the payment's ability to vary with the number of blocks and we now assume that notarization frequncy is always 5. If min sigs of notaries decide to lower freq, they will get paid mroe. We just have to trust them on this. Its still better than having 0 incentive to notarize. 游땎

@LabsAssistant 
CFEKULTRADEAD is live. Past block 61 so you can split utxos. 游똂  this time its going to work. 
I am pretty sure this is going to be good. It would be awesome if CFEKULTRADEAD is the the living chain 游땏

With eras verified to wirk in the last test. And the new validation. It should be no longer possible to reorg notarzations out of the chain to cause damage. 
It limits 1 notarisationper block, valid (in order) or not... Then will create a coinbase to pay notaries who made this notarization. In case of reorg attack it could take some time to clear all the notarizations out of the back log, but there is simply no otherway to let this happen, and have the chain never fork.

[15-Feb-19 03:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Reorg attack stops notarizations from working, there is NOTHING we can do to fix this. If you get 100% attacked your 100% attacked sadly.

so, what branch is CFEKULTRADEAD on?

[15-Feb-19 04:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
same one as yesterday

[15-Feb-19 04:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant know if its going to work or not until I invalidate a few notas and make nit try to mine a few at ocne. So please dont mine it yet

[15-Feb-19 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The idea is, that each block is allowed 1 notarisation in it, which must pay notaries. This means EVERY notarization notaries make they get paid for....

[15-Feb-19 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
99% of the tiem this will be fine,a s there is 5x mroe blocks than notarizations.

yay BRs, so it doesn't die when the 1 person with coinage stops staking 游땎

[15-Feb-19 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hah yeah. That will be solved... I think I worked out how to let a node mine and stake at the same time withthe daemon

[15-Feb-19 05:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so all thats left is to let notary nodes be able to sideload a second wallet to stake with 游땏

[15-Feb-19 05:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem impossible as a walelt si just `pWalletMain` object, should be able to just declare another one with a diffrent file name.

[15-Feb-19 05:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then all notaris can stake and mine all 0BR chains. 游땎

[15-Feb-19 05:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is is notary pay works LOL

@blackjok3r if you cant 100% fully understand all the possible code paths, then 100% guaranteed by Murphys Law that at the worst time whatever part you didnt understand will cause a catastrophic failure. 99% isnt good enough

[15-Feb-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
also, "if it works, dont fix it" is very important advice

[15-Feb-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to weigh the risk of an attack and the worst case outcome of such an attack against the 100% cost of complications. 100% defense is impossible. period. There will always be a way to attack , so the trick is to balance how much complexity is used to defend against the attacks

[15-Feb-19 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
removing validation was the onlyt way forward here

[15-Feb-19 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
for instance, I now see many attempts at defending against 51% that are not dPoW, probably a combination of NIH syndrome. But most all of these "alternatives" have some complex logic with very hard to understand consequences. Some have easy to see exploits.

[15-Feb-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
dPoW is actually very very simple as it just extends the already existing checkpoints checking with a notarization and now it also specifically prevents reorg of the notarized block. That is about as simple of a change as it can be to satoshi consensus, yet it took 2 years! to stabilize it

[15-Feb-19 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ther is no problem with dpow... trhe problem is that a miner can reorg all the chakpoints out of the chain... and if you use those checkpoints for a consesnus thing such as a block reward, they are no longer valid when you sync it

[15-Feb-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its ok... I worked out hwo to get around this issue... dont use a checkpoint for a consensus rule

`who is mining`
the same guy that never stopped
all I did was clear the ban from my NN and it started rolling again
It was hung/banned on a reorg of a notarization

[15-Feb-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
游땩

[15-Feb-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a rule

[15-Feb-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that a miner cannot add more than 1 notarizations to a block

[15-Feb-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and its not workin

[15-Feb-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
by restartign the node

[15-Feb-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you clear the mempool

[15-Feb-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the mine out slowly

[15-Feb-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but thats no fix

[15-Feb-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its suposed to leave the newest notarizations

[15-Feb-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and mine 1 at a time... I had a full mempool to test this and had to get kid from scholl

[15-Feb-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now its empty

[15-Feb-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181

no worries, I'll do it again in a moment

thanks... This time I think I need to just try and snapshot the chain at a block height

[15-Feb-19 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and save the raw ts from mempool

[15-Feb-19 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181

@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉  thats noraml

[15-Feb-19 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its the MoMoM DB not dPoW

[15-Feb-19 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant undo a dPoW notarization

[15-Feb-19 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[15-Feb-19 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure what you mean.. if Alrigh reords a notarization out of teh chain with his magical miner then its no longer in the chain

[15-Feb-19 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the checkpoint for the block height still exists

[15-Feb-19 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the notarisation tx itself is gone

[15-Feb-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
i can see some problems for MoMoM in such cases

[15-Feb-19 07:44 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
OK I'm literally lost and going to bed, because I don't even understand the point of notarizations if we can just reorg them back 3 blocks and delete them
maybe that will make sense to me after sleep

[15-Feb-19 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ther is 2 diffrent notarisation DB's

[15-Feb-19 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
one is for dPoW

[15-Feb-19 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the OTHER ONE WHJICH IS THAT ONE

[15-Feb-19 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is JUST for MoMoM

[15-Feb-19 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
eventually the tx should be confirmed and its always added back in

[15-Feb-19 07:46 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
If I can reorg notaries getting paid and then ignore other notarizations, I can just run off with the chain and stop anyone from getting paid

this attack he is doing is extremly problematic... but its like a 150% attack... its fucking never going to happen in rthe real world... as long as this attack cannot fork our chain that is all I ma aiming for here

[15-Feb-19 07:46 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

[15-Feb-19 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes tahts what hes doing

[15-Feb-19 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but its supposed to delay payment

[15-Feb-19 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to shen he stops doing it

[15-Feb-19 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
by tricking out the notarisation one in each block

[15-Feb-19 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for some reason the miner sint abiding by this rule and gets tuxck trying to mine multipl notar in a single block

[15-Feb-19 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and validation cant let that happen so the chain stops until you restart and clean mepool

[15-Feb-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
non notarized tx are at risk. the notarization for block N cant be in block N, must be in some later block

[15-Feb-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the good news is you should be able to use dpowconfs to detect something is wrong

[15-Feb-19 07:48 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
but, you're missing what I'm saying
if you keep doing that, you can stop NNs from ever getting paid, or at a minimum massively fek them out of 90% of their pay

[15-Feb-19 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem im seeeing (and I could be wrong here, i ahve dug deep enough to the data yet) that the checkpoints exist on online nodes... but whne you resync they are not there.

[15-Feb-19 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
genie you need 150% hash rate to do this

[15-Feb-19 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with PoS they need to buy like all of the supply

[15-Feb-19 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not an issue

[15-Feb-19 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its taken an almost unlimited amount of tie to amke this work AT ALL.... as james said you cannot defend against aall attacks... but you can, make it so the attack wont kill the cahion forever when it happens. That is all we can do... Who is going to 150-% attack a chain forever just tp be a dick...
