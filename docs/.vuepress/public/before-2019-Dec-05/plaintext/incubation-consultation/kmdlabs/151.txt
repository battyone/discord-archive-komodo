Haha, Others were getting notarization.

[08-Dec-18 11:14 PM] Alright#0419
if you *need* to sync LAMEDUCKS in the mean time, roll back to before those ac_period commits

[08-Dec-18 11:15 PM] Alright#0419
yea they aren't updated

[08-Dec-18 11:15 PM] CrisF#3405
Ah.

[08-Dec-18 11:15 PM] CrisF#3405
Hoping the sync works.

[08-Dec-18 11:15 PM] SHossain#0007
last i checked today, my node is working fine

[08-Dec-18 11:16 PM] Alright#0419
don't update

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[08-Dec-18 11:16 PM] Alright#0419
otherwise LAMEDUCKS will change magic value

[08-Dec-18 11:16 PM] Alright#0419
and you won't sync

[08-Dec-18 11:16 PM] Alright#0419
hold on, I'll just move these commits to another branch then undo what he did

[08-Dec-18 11:17 PM] CrisF#3405
It sounded like there was some kind of git trickery that would fix things.

[08-Dec-18 11:17 PM] CrisF#3405
I couldn't figure it out in the time I had.

[08-Dec-18 11:18 PM] Alright#0419
does anyone *need* to use LAMEDUCKS right now?

[08-Dec-18 11:18 PM] Alright#0419
looking at this commit, I have no idea why it affected LAMEDUCKS

[08-Dec-18 11:19 PM] Alright#0419
Last time I touched daemon code, he wasn't happy 😅 so I'm just going to leave it

[08-Dec-18 11:19 PM] Alright#0419
if you need LAMEDUCKS for some reason, let me know

[08-Dec-18 11:23 PM] SHossain#0007
Haven't seen @blackjok3r here today. He didn't seem to have seen my ping in #talk-mining

[08-Dec-18 11:28 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @SHossain, Blackjok3r said he should be around later today.

[08-Dec-18 11:28 PM] SHossain#0007
it's already midnight for me

[08-Dec-18 11:29 PM] SHossain#0007

This is happening on NN and mining node.
I've deleted komodo, deleted and re-installed staked, deleted `lastbuildcommit` and did `git checkout 275f7e24cc4d90df5d2644b5f3d5642362a81dc2` (a commit that worked for me before. Still getting the error.  Other chains running but not notarizing.
 Not sure what to try next.
Maybe you know?

[09-Dec-18 11:04 AM] zatJUM#9924
Maybe you want to sync from my IP? I'm still notarizing all chains

[09-Dec-18 11:06 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll give it a go. Thanks!

[09-Dec-18 11:53 AM] CrisF#3405
Tried `-connect=94.23.1.95` and `addnode` still has the same mempool error.

[09-Dec-18 11:53 AM] CrisF#3405
Hope this reboot helps.

[09-Dec-18 12:06 PM] CrisF#3405

[09-Dec-18 12:25 PM] CrisF#3405
Can I do that on any chain to help DUCKS (I can't start DUCKS)?

[09-Dec-18 12:26 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
managed to get user auth and email confirmation sorted in django today for dragonhound, and added SSL certs. now I just gotta port what I did on cherrypy over to django and it should be ready to unleash

[09-Dec-18 12:26 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
clearbanned? it'll only help banned nodes if a good node does it

[09-Dec-18 12:27 PM] CrisF#3405

@CrisF @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 scroll up, it was already discussed

[09-Dec-18 02:05 PM] Alright#0419
there was a tweak to master branch to make ac_period affect the magic value

[09-Dec-18 02:05 PM] Alright#0419
which inadvertently changed the magic value of LAMEDUCKS

[09-Dec-18 02:06 PM] Alright#0419
thanks

[09-Dec-18 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm aware of that
I'm also aware that I see nothing posted on how to fix or go around ducks

[09-Dec-18 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_removes `CFEKLAMEDUCKS` from `assetchains.json` and goes back to being a NN_

You can replace it with a ac_period chain

I am back avalible today

[10-Dec-18 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure ... I think maybe latest commit on master will fix CFEKLAMEDUCKS. Can someone please check it?

[10-Dec-18 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Looks like a stupid mistake, where it was allocating PERIOD var for the magic value instead of FOUNDERS. 🤷

[10-Dec-18 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I hav no idea if the chain is already broken beyond repair.

[10-Dec-18 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If this is the case, we should just launch a new one. @Alright

Really weird that non of my nodes had an issue.. the code was 100% wrong... and all founders chains would have been incompatible since that commit.

Yeah sounds like most were ok.

[10-Dec-18 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think maybe it only appears when you start a fresh sync.

[10-Dec-18 10:08 AM] CrisF#3405
I did a total re-install and still no luck.

[10-Dec-18 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
On a fresh install, it would have a 0% chance of working.

[10-Dec-18 10:09 AM] CrisF#3405
I got rid of everything except for xxx.conf and wallet.dats.

[10-Dec-18 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sory about this, guess as long as this fixes it we are good.

[10-Dec-18 10:22 AM] CrisF#3405
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  `DUCKS` is working for me now.  Just  a `./start` and the update fixed it.

[10-Dec-18 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cool  and it can complete a sync? I am guessing that my mining nodes are still using the old magic value somehow.... so Everything should be fine.

[10-Dec-18 10:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, just waiting on a notarization on ING and then they have all notarized.

[10-Dec-18 10:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Will check the mining nodes shortly.

[10-Dec-18 10:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Have notarizations on all chains now.

[10-Dec-18 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yep cool.. just checked my node and on the old commit everything is still working and notarising.. So my best guess here is that the magic value is stored in a file after the first start and hten loaded from there, and this only affects new syncs.

[10-Dec-18 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Either that or I forgot to update my nodes before the weekend... and they are all on older verision, before the mistake was pushed. 😄

[10-Dec-18 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ok I think one thing we need to test, is Imports on a sapling activated chain.

[10-Dec-18 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We will need to hardfork CFEK cluster OR launch new chains for this.

[10-Dec-18 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this is the last thing to be crossed off hte list of must haves. That I can think of.

[11-Dec-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pushed some non critical updates... Simplified miner code some more, I think its now just about as efficiant it can be... Found an unused function of james's that checks if a tx is to the crypto address using memcompare ... probably 100x faster than the old method I was using.  Also cleaned up some code and removed some things not needed elsewhere.

[11-Dec-18 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also it appears the code in dissconecct tip to clear orphaned txs has not stopped the wallet getting corrupted. I' lost as to what to do about this problem. I guess as a work around we will just need staking scripts to manage utxo's. Alright is working on those right now... Maybe just limiting it so it doent end up with 70,000 utxos will be enough to stop it corrupting. Disableing the rescan on start when its detected there are corrupt txs, doesn't seem a brilliant plan either, as it can try to mine blocks with corrupt txs or something. Not really sure exactly, but CFEK for me gets stuck in loops where it mines invalid blocks for hours.

[11-Dec-18 03:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  added segid to getsnapshot

[11-Dec-18 04:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not a great solution, but at least you can grab an estimate of how much is being staked from each one now... output is far from easy to use, but I'm not really understanding the getsnapshot code so well.. I think I could copy paste the whole RPC and make a new one that returns just amounts per segid, but you have no idea what is actually being staked, so I dont think its  useful enough for me to spend my time on it. Unless someone wants this specifically.

[11-Dec-18 04:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am going to continue to use my method from POSTEST and count actual stakes per segid from found blocks.

[11-Dec-18 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pushed new RPC to master, that returns total stakes for each segid for defined muber of blocks. 
It counts back from the chaintip the number of blocks you speicfy, checks if the block was PoS, and extracts the segid of that address that staked it. 
This is a much neater and faster way of my staking strategy. Waiting on Alrights python staking scripts, to use as an example to intergrate this in. 
try running it on LAMEDUCKS 🤣 
`komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKLAMEDUCKS getlastsegidstakes`
segid 5 and 7 have 3000-3500 stakes each, the rest ~200... I guess someone is staking to -pubkey on segid 5 and 7.
