no its just in master

[10-Nov-18 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
StakedChain/komodo

[10-Nov-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doing start.sh in either staked, or stakednotary should pull and build the latest master for all chains.

[10-Nov-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
anyway back to the limitation... to send very large amounts

[10-Nov-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you might first have to send that amount to yourself

[10-Nov-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on the source chain, to merge utxos

[10-Nov-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This was somehting crisF found early on.... export txs dont work with large amounts of vins

[10-Nov-18 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as the transaction after all the steps ends up too large to send

[10-Nov-18 02:24 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
This is a common limitation isn't it? most z-type coins I use crash on normal sends with high vin counts
So I suppose the question is - how much smaller is the limitation on a migrate?

[10-Nov-18 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
really not sure... its probaby somthing we need to determine

[10-Nov-18 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so there is a useeful error message

Im not sure but maybe something in here is useful for your battery things ... This was wifi this guy was using, I assume yours is using 3G/4G though might be applicable.

Updated chat dapp's listrooms script. It will now show the latest message from room creator pubkey in place of the description

[10-Nov-18 02:50 PM] Alright#0419
so room creator can post updates and such

[10-Nov-18 02:50 PM] Alright#0419
can't use the pubkey you used to create a room in chat now though

[10-Nov-18 03:16 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I saw that a while ago, before I had the hound. Funny the cat shook it off üòÇ  no wifi on this board tho, just gps/3G

pushed support for -ac_script, which sets the -ac_perc vout[1] to be the specified script, the -ac_pubkey is ignored if -ac_script is set

[10-Nov-18 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
this will allow founders reward or block tx percentage to go to CC vout

{Reactions}
üëç 

[10-Nov-18 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
you would need to get the scriptPubKey of the CC vout by making one on another CC chain first, then use the hex of it

[10-Nov-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
this also allows -ac_perc vout[1] to go to multisig addresses

[10-Nov-18 09:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i just "fixed" nomp

[10-Nov-18 09:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it now just pays the exact block made

[10-Nov-18 09:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I removed all the stupid coinbase shit

[10-Nov-18 09:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It just treats the coinbase as a normal tx,

[10-Nov-18 09:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and pays it... this emans the pool needs to sort it fees another way that modifying the coinbase ... but the daemon cna now build CC transactions in the CreateBlock function in the miner.

[10-Nov-18 09:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Also I think this will make the pool compatible with what james just made. 
Thanks @jl777c  Thats really really useful üòÑ

[10-Nov-18 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
yes ac_perc -> CC vout or multisig for starters

[10-Nov-18 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
actually that really opens up a lot of usecases and using -ac_founder it can create a predictable revenue stream

[10-Nov-18 09:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes its going to allow heaps of really cool things

[10-Nov-18 09:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to make my pool hack work as a parameter to `getblocktemplate` rater than the hardcoded change, with everythig commented out... and we have a stratum that is compatible with all these options aswell.

[10-Nov-18 10:27 PM] Mylo#8306

@blackjok3r  can you pls link me to nomp changes to update the  Stomp pool?

[10-Nov-18 11:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It needs a special daemon parameter not sure you can do that easily

[10-Nov-18 11:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The changes I made are in mining room

hey @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator made some notes from your scripts.   will try to get a gui together before tech tuesday.   was nice to have your `dice_table.sh` script to see setting up a table

[10-Nov-18 11:51 PM] Mylo#8306
looks like a fair few days of bash scripting/tuning...

[11-Nov-18 12:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
awse, glad it's useful! what are you using for front end? I'm ready to sort that out for dog GPS. Looking at Kivy, but probably start with leaflet-js in browser.

vuetifyjs 
if you are going to try from browser you'll have to put a CORS proxy in front of RPC because browsers have that rule.    i'm using https://github.com/imylomylo/cors-anywhere

next week i'll be able to give you some instructions.  maaaaaaybe able to use a vue plugin to use leafletjs just found one on github which looks pretty well supported in case you wanted to fork komodo-cakeshop and just add to it for now.   i'm want to test out cordova to make it a mobile app at some stage

check vuetifyjs . com docs.  nice and easy and they have codepen links for testing

I"m still trying to work out how to demo it properly without giving up my location security, so for now only authenticated user can decrypt the data within the oracle into coordinates. Once front end works, I'll setup something to spoof coords with public view access.

there are sections where a fresh sync skips notarisations

[11-Nov-18 04:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then the imports cannot be verified.

[11-Nov-18 04:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[11-Nov-18 05:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181

My migrates went south too ... if a chain stalls, my VM loses it shit and starts to get very angry... had to kill everything üò¶ Only one chain got stuck... it just keeps spammig migrates and the daemon ends up locked... have a feeling thats all that happned to  MLT aswell.

[11-Nov-18 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So going to merge FSM into mastertest branch and start some new migrates there, so we cna test the new founders reward, and then I will ge the pool working with it.

Not sure if it's the same, after previous failed ING -> LF run of 1300+ migrates and ^Cing out of migrate script and stop.sh / start.sh htop showed many migrates still running.  Wasn't able to figure out how to stop them.  @blackjok3r

[11-Nov-18 08:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pkill migratecoin.sh

[11-Nov-18 08:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that works for me, if the thing get stuck ...
