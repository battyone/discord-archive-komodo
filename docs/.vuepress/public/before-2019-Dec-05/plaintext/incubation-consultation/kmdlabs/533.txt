maybe. I think the KMDHFtest branch is working ok, need to tesk KMD still if you can  wait.. .

[04-Dec-19 07:41 PM] Markus#5464
I assume with kmdlabs u want stuff to keep running? So a server with linux would be the best option?

[04-Dec-19 07:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes.

[04-Dec-19 07:42 PM] Markus#5464
Any minimum requirement of hardware?

[04-Dec-19 07:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
VPS or a server at your house. The iguana is running a delay so even isolated nodes preform quite well

[04-Dec-19 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
rent a cheapo VPS

[04-Dec-19 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
4gb 4core with swap space will work

[04-Dec-19 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
should do 8gb if you can

[04-Dec-19 07:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[04-Dec-19 07:44 PM] Markus#5464
Any specific linux recommended?

[04-Dec-19 07:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I use Debian9, others here Ubuntu 16.04/18.04

[04-Dec-19 07:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[04-Dec-19 07:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I synced LABS just before in less than 10mins... need to try again so will time it 😄

[04-Dec-19 07:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
your down is only 10x mine, but 80x up is a ton

[04-Dec-19 07:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
40 up is quite crazy, was surprised that I could get it tbh.

I can weed out POW'd coins and any coins staked with them, should do it so people can test stratums for bug bounties

supply and reward don't matter as long as there is something

[04-Dec-19 10:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not exactly... If the reward and supply are too high the PoW doesnt stand a chance lol...
