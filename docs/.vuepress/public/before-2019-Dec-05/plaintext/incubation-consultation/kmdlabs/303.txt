Seems it basically creates another layer of randomness... Rather than the closest nodes controlling recvmask, its a random recvmask, which is then random bestmask ... seems far more like how tis supposed to work... but we are relying on another 3rd party network.

lol I seem to be in every notarization now ü§£

[21-Feb-19 06:26 AM] jorian#4555
I'd say this is the solution then üòõ

[21-Feb-19 07:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it looks like it might be. But we really need every node using it to know for sure.

[21-Feb-19 07:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
web didnt want to use tor so took his node down. Its just a matter of time until the rest are around and update or do the same thing.

[21-Feb-19 07:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then we need to check that it doesnt negativly impoact notarizations counts over all, but early results seem like they will be pretty much fine to me.

[21-Feb-19 07:34 AM] CHMEX#0686
so CFEK are notarizing on my node the LABSTH not yet

What I will do is modify the script to count notarizations after each node is updated to use tor. Then see hwo it averages out compared to the last 24H before we started using it.

[21-Feb-19 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until all nodes are using it, measuring anything wil be pointless.

[21-Feb-19 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean the alternative to this is to just get everyone to use a VPS in the same stae in the USA üòÇ

why not use tor? @webworker01 care to explain?

[21-Feb-19 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
he did, his server is multi use

[21-Feb-19 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its no problem, he said dedicated VPS if we decide to use it

[21-Feb-19 08:43 AM] jorian#4555
ah ok

[21-Feb-19 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not realy 100% sure tor is the solution, but the results of this test will definatly tell us what the solution needs to be. For short term, those of us whos nodes just generatlly suck, can just rent a cheap VPS near the nodes that are good, unlless that is tor proves to be realiable enough to use.

[21-Feb-19 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh, I figured we are not ussing it for its privacy aspects at all, as the IP it totally exposed for incomming connections... simpelyt leverging existing infrustructure to increase the minimum hops required to send a packet.

[21-Feb-19 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We can probalyu acheive the same thing without using tor, but tor was very easy to get working

[21-Feb-19 08:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah thats totally fine, this is just a test. it shouldnt make a hug ediffrence to have a few nodes dropped out

[21-Feb-19 08:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if its too many of you, I will just reduce minsigs to 3

[21-Feb-19 08:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should simulate similar results

[21-Feb-19 08:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
although tbh if your country is that bad you cant use tor, I would leave .. My country is probablyt exactly the same but I just use it lots anway just for general normal stuff üòÑ

[21-Feb-19 08:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
:troll_cool:

[21-Feb-19 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha, maybe everyone should juyst start using tor all at the same time...

[21-Feb-19 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like everyone

[21-Feb-19 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what are they goign to do then

[21-Feb-19 08:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats the solution, to all the issues, jsut make everyone do it somehow t hey cannot imprison or fully spy on every person

I wonder if it could be blocked or something for some people ?

[21-Feb-19 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
did the check for tor is working return congratulations the browser can use tor?

[21-Feb-19 09:00 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, it was working.

[21-Feb-19 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm... Need to somehow check if itactualyl working... its helped my node a lot

[21-Feb-19 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`sudo iptables -t nat -L`

[21-Feb-19 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what does that say @CrisF ?

[21-Feb-19 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`netstat -ntl | grep 9050`

[21-Feb-19 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
aswell

[21-Feb-19 09:06 AM] gt#2812
i haven't had any in hours

[21-Feb-19 09:07 AM] CrisF#3405
I checked the curl and it returned the connected to tor browser message.

[21-Feb-19 09:07 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm rebooting now and will check when it's back up.

[21-Feb-19 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well until all nodes are using it we cant know what it does really... I think maybe it helped my ndoe because its the seed and node 0... likely the nodes not usign it are connecting to me and im being included with them. Let me check some notarizations and see who im notarizing with

[21-Feb-19 09:09 AM] gt#2812
```target     prot opt source               destination
REDIRECT   tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:9997 redir                                                                                         ports 9050

Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)

```

[21-Feb-19 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah Im pretty sure yours is working, as you had notarizations. The problem is that some nodes havent done it yet, and they have a HUGE advatnage atm

[21-Feb-19 09:10 AM] gt#2812
```tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:9050          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
```

[21-Feb-19 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats what its supposed to be, at least thats what mine is doing.

[21-Feb-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, there are Shossain, Nabob, TonyL and Genie still not updated and they are getting basically every notarization and for some reason my node is also being included.

[21-Feb-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its just a waitong game until they update or turn their node off

[21-Feb-19 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not much we can do until they show up

[21-Feb-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
give it a few mor hours, and we can change port, but it seems like starting all over again waiting for eveyone to update doing that

[21-Feb-19 09:28 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r did you talk to each of them?

[21-Feb-19 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I pinged hthem all ages ago only those 4 are left

[21-Feb-19 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dont want to annoy them... they will do it eventually

[21-Feb-19 09:29 AM] Alright#0419
@SHossain @Nabob @TonyL @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢

[21-Feb-19 09:29 AM] Alright#0419
is CHMEX using tor?

[21-Feb-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[21-Feb-19 09:30 AM] Alright#0419
how are you seeing who is and isn't?

[21-Feb-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its only those 4 I get messages about on my node, seems using tor makes those messages go away, not sure why

[21-Feb-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the nodes still notarize

[21-Feb-19 09:31 AM] Alright#0419
@Deleted User @daemonfox @metaphilibert are you guys still interested in a running a notary? No worries if not, would just like to find replacements if you won't be

[21-Feb-19 09:31 AM] Alright#0419
I think dwy had a replacement, but not sure what happened to the dude

[21-Feb-19 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r so what's on the agenda?

[21-Feb-19 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
I was going to check that emissions on LABSTH look about right

[21-Feb-19 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
not sure there is anything else critical to do

[21-Feb-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they seem fine, but they are totally unevenly distributed, liek horribly so

[21-Feb-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nut yes, scripting how many notarizations

[21-Feb-19 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
it's the weather

[21-Feb-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
actaully happened, before we started this might be a good idea

[21-Feb-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we will need that data to comparte to

[21-Feb-19 09:34 AM] Alright#0419
I'll get stats since you pinged everyone

[21-Feb-19 09:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
I m interested but bit short of time for now so it s up2you

[21-Feb-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
atm, we dont need more ppl, just the ppl atm to update or switch off to see if tor works or not

[21-Feb-19 09:35 AM] Alright#0419
dwy it's fine as long as you intend to actually notarize after launch

[21-Feb-19 09:35 AM] Alright#0419
again no worries if you don't have time now

[21-Feb-19 09:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
After launch it will be okay. Btw my current key is not mine anymore. All depends on your launch time. Nearly finished lazynode in py version so i ll migrate all my servs next week

[21-Feb-19 09:37 AM] Alright#0419
so joker

[21-Feb-19 09:37 AM] Alright#0419
some time to analyze the effects of tor

[21-Feb-19 09:37 AM] Alright#0419
then what?

[21-Feb-19 09:37 AM] Alright#0419
looking good for launch?

[21-Feb-19 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant see why the main chain cant be launched, as long as all the announcments are in order to do so. If tor isnt viable, we can all just buy VPS in same DC üòÇ

[21-Feb-19 09:38 AM] Alright#0419
tor has no effect at all or what?

[21-Feb-19 09:39 AM] Alright#0419
you just made all outgoing connections route through tor?

[21-Feb-19 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its has signirficalt slowed down notarizations for all nodes using it except mine, which is some how being included with the nodezs nto using it who are dominating

[21-Feb-19 09:39 AM] Alright#0419
didn't touch incoming?

[21-Feb-19 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the iguana listens on tis IP and port as normal, but each packet has to hop 3 times over tor network to get to the otehr nodes

[21-Feb-19 09:39 AM] Alright#0419
do we have a LABSTH explorer?

[21-Feb-19 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe... not sure tbh, I miught have done them

[21-Feb-19 09:40 AM] Alright#0419
ok can we shift our focus to launch prep? website, BCT ANN, marketing ü§¢

[21-Feb-19 09:40 AM] Alright#0419
I will validate that emissions on TH look fine

[21-Feb-19 09:41 AM] Alright#0419
I will check out how tor has affected the network

[21-Feb-19 09:41 AM] Alright#0419
not sure what else there is for me to do atm

[21-Feb-19 09:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pretty much yes. Yeah do that, we need a script that can get total notarizations and coin emission.. then we can just run it before and after tor was started. say 24H in either dir3ection to see what effect it has.. .There is no point evening up notarizations, if the total number drops by a significant amount.

[21-Feb-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
please keep TH alive no matter what btw

[21-Feb-19 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant see what tor does until eveyone is using it.. there are 4 nodes making just abotu 100% of nortarizations atm

[21-Feb-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
it's a good test for emissions

üëç 

[21-Feb-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
there's no way to enforce it?

[21-Feb-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
I guess we would need to enforce the incoming connections

[21-Feb-19 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
but that could be changed

[21-Feb-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It can be enforced, but some nodes stated it could get into legal trouble using it... so I think its better to use this test as a viabiilty of doing something simialr but not actualyl suig tor, not sure we would need to ak everyone.

[21-Feb-19 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
legal trouble?

[21-Feb-19 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
it's not like they're running a freaking exit node

[21-Feb-19 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
few people said they didnt want to use it incase of lositn servers or geting red flagged stc
