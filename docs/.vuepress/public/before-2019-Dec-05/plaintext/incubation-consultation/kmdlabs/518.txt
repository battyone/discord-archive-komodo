I'm staking with 35,000 LABS, using master branch, still regularly generating blocks, but on a bad day I could have none

> do you have blocks from staking?
yes

[18-Nov-19 05:15 PM] PHBA2061#2530
may be kevin finally decides to stake his LABS instead of dumping on exchanges :abusedsmily:

@TonyL if you created new UTXOs prior to doing that, they will need time to mature

[18-Nov-19 05:46 PM] Alright#0419

if anyone is seeing high rates of orphans, please log them and send me to them

[18-Nov-19 05:47 PM] Alright#0419
I need you to log `getblock <block> 2` on both the orphan and the block that replaced it

[18-Nov-19 06:02 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
most of the orphans I've seen are caused by a short fork (1-3 blocks) and a notarization

[18-Nov-19 06:03 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
including deleting of notarizations

[18-Nov-19 06:05 PM] jorian#4555
no blocks with 35k? i must be doing something better than you then @PHBA2061

[18-Nov-19 06:09 PM] PHBA2061#2530
on bad days, & among those 35K there are 14K that sitting in a single address, I'm too lazy to spread it out 游땍

absolutely no chance of it

I can try to teleport bread from Europe to Australia but it never worked... maybe we should use KMD to exchange value instead of teleporting bread

How about 10 LABS for those 1000 WLC21

[18-Nov-19 07:37 PM] PHBA2061#2530
once the time machine is ready, 1 WLC21 will worth as much as 1 BTC :abusedsmily:

WTF is WLC21?

[19-Nov-19 12:53 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
a money grab revamp of WLC

[19-Nov-19 01:08 AM] daemonfox#6136
ok...

[19-Nov-19 01:20 AM] daemonfox#6136
@LabsAssistant  I made a thing! Anyone running LABS on Windows mind testing it out a little?

Someone point my in the right direction to stake my LABS please

[19-Nov-19 01:55 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Very noob to staking

[19-Nov-19 01:56 AM] daemonfox#6136
Win or linux?

[19-Nov-19 01:56 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
What kind of power do I need...

[19-Nov-19 01:56 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
GPU, CPU?

[19-Nov-19 01:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
staking is single core

[19-Nov-19 01:57 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I have a linux machine sitting here but not that powerful

[19-Nov-19 01:57 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Ok....let me try -

[19-Nov-19 01:58 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Is there an instruction page?

[19-Nov-19 01:58 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Is it just running staked with all my coins transferred to that address

[19-Nov-19 01:59 AM] daemonfox#6136
check pins in this channel

[19-Nov-19 01:59 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I have never attempted to stake

[19-Nov-19 01:59 AM] daemonfox#6136
there is a github link in there

[19-Nov-19 02:04 AM] daemonfox#6136
In truth... i found it easiest to use the StakedNotary git and let it build KMD that way...

[19-Nov-19 02:09 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Thanks

[19-Nov-19 02:10 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
So send all my LABS to that address

[19-Nov-19 02:15 AM] daemonfox#6136
not exactly

[19-Nov-19 02:15 AM] daemonfox#6136
If you check the KMDLabs git there is a pos64staker repo

[19-Nov-19 02:16 AM] daemonfox#6136
that repo has several commands to split your coins to many addresses and UTXOs.

[19-Nov-19 02:16 AM] daemonfox#6136
Its a balance game... how much coin in each utxo, how many utcos per address compared to the rest of the stakers

[19-Nov-19 02:17 AM] daemonfox#6136
All dictates your performance

[19-Nov-19 02:17 AM] daemonfox#6136
The idea is... there are 64 SEGIDs, 0-63

[19-Nov-19 02:17 AM] daemonfox#6136
Every address is tied to a single SEGID

[19-Nov-19 02:18 AM] daemonfox#6136
the staker checks the next SEGID in order for a valid block solution, then moves to the next until someone has a valid utxo that meets age and a solution, then it stakes a block.

[19-Nov-19 02:18 AM] daemonfox#6136
So, idea is, get a good amount of coin, and if you have enough, divide it among the SEGIDs into several UTXOs per SEGID

[19-Nov-19 02:18 AM] daemonfox#6136
the repo explains how

[19-Nov-19 02:20 AM] daemonfox#6136
if you dont have a good amount... its likely better to make a larger UTXO on a single address

[19-Nov-19 02:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
you can evaluate the last staked SEGIDs totals per SEGID in the last X blocks by passing the daemon CLI the getlastsegidstakes X

[19-Nov-19 02:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
So, the last ~24 hours would be...

[19-Nov-19 02:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS getlastsegidstakes 1440

[19-Nov-19 02:22 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
25000 labs a good start?

[19-Nov-19 02:22 AM] daemonfox#6136
yeah

[19-Nov-19 02:23 AM] daemonfox#6136
youll be fine

[19-Nov-19 02:23 AM] daemonfox#6136
send your LABS to the address you got from the new daemon... then run the pos64staker TUI

[19-Nov-19 02:24 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Ohh ok

[19-Nov-19 02:24 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Ok ok

[19-Nov-19 02:31 AM] daemonfox#6136
GL

[19-Nov-19 02:33 AM] daemonfox#6136
ok real question is... do we still need to run CFEKMYLO chains now?

[19-Nov-19 02:42 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
imo, if it's in the repo then we run it
