[19-Feb-19 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
would a node rebroadcast an expired tx?

[19-Feb-19 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
or is it dropped from mempool as soon as it expires?

[19-Feb-19 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are doing that... IO just got one from LABS ntoary node sent here that rejected

[19-Feb-19 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ü§û  its still in its mempool

[19-Feb-19 05:24 AM] Alright#0419
have you noticed this on assetchains or is it only affecting KMD?

[19-Feb-19 05:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is on KMD... Dont think ive been working with chains with enough tx to notice it on them

[19-Feb-19 05:26 AM] Alright#0419
I think I know a way to easily reproduce propagation issue

[19-Feb-19 05:26 AM] Alright#0419
or well

[19-Feb-19 05:26 AM] Alright#0419
a propagation issue

[19-Feb-19 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you do sendrawtransaction on them ... they instantly propagate

[19-Feb-19 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
have you tested txblast scripts since sapling upgrade?

[19-Feb-19 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it seems to me that they are expiring before the normal propagation can send them around... its no longer on my notary node KMD node btw...

[19-Feb-19 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
simply spending unconfirmed utxos seems to have a propagation issue

[19-Feb-19 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no not sure toi works with saplling at all ... the tx would be wrong I think

[19-Feb-19 05:28 AM] Alright#0419
```
While true; do
sendtoaddress <address this node owns> <just below full balance of wallet>
done
```

[19-Feb-19 05:28 AM] Alright#0419
then watch a peer's debug.log

[19-Feb-19 05:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats expected behaviour they dont proapgate in order

[19-Feb-19 05:29 AM] Alright#0419
it will get spammed to hell with "input not found"

[19-Feb-19 05:29 AM] Alright#0419
this changed at the sapling hard fork?

[19-Feb-19 05:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Likely some limitation has been removed that allows you to spend them too many times

[19-Feb-19 05:29 AM] Alright#0419
I don't recall this happening before hard fork

[19-Feb-19 05:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You couldnt send that many tx spent in mempool

[19-Feb-19 05:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it would stop

[19-Feb-19 05:30 AM] Alright#0419
test migration v2 script before and after FSM merge

[19-Feb-19 05:30 AM] Alright#0419
both worked fine

[19-Feb-19 05:30 AM] Alright#0419
tested*

[19-Feb-19 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they work fine

[19-Feb-19 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just that error kept spamming for me

[19-Feb-19 05:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you didnt see it?

[19-Feb-19 05:31 AM] Alright#0419
likely from another script

[19-Feb-19 05:31 AM] Alright#0419
or someone trying to hax you

[19-Feb-19 05:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it wasnt... I onyl ahd 1

[19-Feb-19 05:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
anyway if its only my system propable some mis config in python

[19-Feb-19 05:31 AM] Alright#0419
I stared at this script for like 20 minutes

[19-Feb-19 05:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might be time to make a new VM

[19-Feb-19 05:31 AM] Alright#0419
I can't see how it would mix up rpc creds

[19-Feb-19 05:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it wasnt mixing them up

[19-Feb-19 05:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I amde it print the creds out

[19-Feb-19 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it definatly was not the script doing it

[19-Feb-19 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the debug.log would print that error as soon as I started the script

[19-Feb-19 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
every time

[19-Feb-19 05:32 AM] Alright#0419
do you have the rpc port open to the internet?

[19-Feb-19 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dont think so ...

[19-Feb-19 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its behind NAT

[19-Feb-19 05:32 AM] Alright#0419
is it reproducible on that machine?

[19-Feb-19 05:33 AM] Alright#0419
if you really want me to, could log into it and figure out what's going on

[19-Feb-19 05:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sure i'll do another on e right now it did it every time 100% of the time alst night

[19-Feb-19 05:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not really important if its not happening on other mahcines. I just need to make new VMs some config si fucked up.

[19-Feb-19 05:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ive been using them for a while now

[19-Feb-19 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LOL

[19-Feb-19 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its nto doing ti anymore

[19-Feb-19 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
üòÇ

[19-Feb-19 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wtf

[19-Feb-19 06:07 AM] Alright#0419
likely because it was never that script to begin with

[19-Feb-19 07:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I tried a single migrate on my updated notary, no RPC errors

[19-Feb-19 07:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I dont have funds on other nodes though

[19-Feb-19 07:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so cant check, but at least one is probably out of date

[19-Feb-19 07:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
```
Import transaction not created yet, waiting for 10 seconds more
Seems tx created
All import transactions created!
(6, 'Could not resolve host: user-RPCUSERNAME')
Import transaction on KMD not created yet, waiting for 10 seconds more```

[19-Feb-19 07:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just noticed this in the script screen tho

[19-Feb-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah mine started as connection refused... Then I reset the conf files and restarted all nodes... Must have been some random os issue.very strange... Anyway the thing is working. And likely script will need to be re written with the new simplified rpc calls when those are done anyway.

[19-Feb-19 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
U can mine dimxy with a single core @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  I mine enough in 20 Mina to burn over 6000 coins üòÇ

[19-Feb-19 10:40 AM] dimxy#2587
hi,
can I connect as komodo-cli to some running KMD node to get migrate_completeimporttransaction?

[19-Feb-19 10:43 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r ‚òù

[19-Feb-19 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Can someone please link him to the bash script that has comments?

[19-Feb-19 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm on phone

[19-Feb-19 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
U need a full kmd node that has been receiving blocks since u sent the export, so it has the relavent mom hashes stored in it's db

[19-Feb-19 10:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cheers, will try in a bit. Got a call for fire maps as soon as I got home, one west of bridgetown looking nasty, old trees and steep terrain = rapid spread üò¶

[19-Feb-19 10:51 AM] dimxy#2587
So, it gets data indirectly from the db and I need a full KMD node, yes?

[19-Feb-19 10:58 AM] CrisF#3405
```To use these scripts you need a few things in place. First you must be using the komodo verison from the KMDLabs
(StakedChain) repo on MASTER branch. To build and install this, use the buildkomdod.sh script in the install folder.

You need to sync KMD, not just the STAKED chains. You can use a KMD snapshot: https://bootstrap.0x03.services/komodo/KMD.html

Komodo will not be able to see notarizations back past the block you started it at, so it is best to start everything and wait for a while before starting any coin migrates.```

[19-Feb-19 11:24 AM] dimxy#2587
great! Thanks again

[19-Feb-19 11:24 AM] CrisF#3405
No problem üòÉ

I'm trying to mine `CFEKDIMXY1` to get some funds for migrations.

[19-Feb-19 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need a kmd full node that is synced to the latest tip with the staked/labs komodo. Then do the export. Otherwise the notarization db won't have the correct notarizations in it

[19-Feb-19 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I hope that makes sense

[19-Feb-19 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As cris said a bootstrap is fine as long as u preform the exports with it running after you start it

[19-Feb-19 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No need to sync from scratch, as long as it can see the relavent notarization s

[19-Feb-19 11:30 AM] dimxy#2587
Yes, i'm going to like this, thanks!

[19-Feb-19 11:31 AM] CrisF#3405
Bootstrap: `https://bootstrap.0x03.services/komodo/KMD.html`

[19-Feb-19 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Cool man. If we could not need a kmd node that would be optimal, but its possible to provide a service for that step, as its not important regarding ownership of coins/signing tx

[19-Feb-19 05:34 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
is `stats.py` output meaningful to any extent?

[19-Feb-19 08:28 PM] CrisF#3405
No `stats` for CFEK chains here.

[19-Feb-19 08:29 PM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r No time to check details, but ```Total migrations amount: 1000

`CFEKDIMXY1` to `CFEKDIMXY2`

[20-Feb-19 12:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEK doenst have notary pay

[20-Feb-19 12:10 AM] CrisF#3405
I've done a couple of migration loops using  `migration_script_v2.py` and it has really smooth.

[20-Feb-19 12:10 AM] CrisF#3405
Starting another now.

[20-Feb-19 12:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
üòÑ great

[20-Feb-19 12:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Thinking of how to implement your üèì idea, or a loop between more than 2 nodes.

[20-Feb-19 12:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pretty sue there is no problem... but yeah CFEK cluster doenst have notary pay, so later today I will launch something with notary py inncluster for us to test that, just incase it makes any diff... doubt it will tho unless its attacked by the ceneorship atttack, not sure it can work wth that

Spoke too soon, looks like a script thing though. Will check it out. ```Sending 5.0 coins from CFEKDIMXY1 chain to CFEKDIMXY2 chain

The migrations are getting faster each of the 3 sets I did.```Total migrations amount: 4999
