Merging all tis stuff into `mastertest` branch ... going to amek sure it builds, take some notes on how to activate and use everything and then merge it to master ... it could break everything but we are just about ready to start a new testnet. MLT is mostl likely deaded dude... wouldnt worry about it.

[09-Nov-18 10:32 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeh, figured.

Libscott fix, and CFEKED are both working perfectly for momom  so we will take libscotts sledgehammer fix

That some how ended up in the dwy_mitigaton branch, due to some git funkyness .. so I will just merge it into master... its ot causing any problems, apart  from some, false possitive error messages on migrates or chain sync.

[09-Nov-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
he said that can ebe fixed mostly, by maing it look for the first momom that its normally looking for without the fix then if that fails, scanning aorund... I

LOL ... jst ran the filter on blackjok3r3 staked notary on KMD.... took about 30mins to import the private key, 46,000 txs in the wallet ... 3mins at only 10% cpu one core, to run the filter over it.... just hung for an eternity.... But at the end, left it with 170 txs in the wallet. Seems stable, even if slow ... I think that remvoing the LOCK(cs_walelt) from the erase function might speed it up a heap, but it also seems super unsafe... so not going to. Staked chains do use the erasefromwallet function at times, so removing the lock seems dangerous.

[09-Nov-18 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In any casethe first time you run it, you should just send entire balance and run `clearwalletnotarisations <txid>` of the send balance to self... and it will start with a single tx in the wallet, just as if you used hte old reset methods.

I am comipliing mastertest on blackjok3r notary 0 right now... if it loads all chains and runs ok and notarises... I will push it all to master. There are a few changes to the start scripts needed.. kmd needs to run with `-stakednotary=1` instead of `-notary`

[09-Nov-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The hardest issue to solve, was that on start up, the R address's cannot be calculated... so I had to devise an entrily new way for staked notareies to activate and work. üòÆ

Seems to be working prety welll ...

[09-Nov-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I found a pretty bad flaw with the 0BR chains though

[09-Nov-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I mined them all on my notary early on, and my wallet is full of 0.00000 value UTXO, cant send them, cant do anything.

[09-Nov-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe I need a raw transaction ü§î

[09-Nov-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
On the streamer chain I solved this, by sending all the 0BR's to the CRYPTO777 address üòÑ

[09-Nov-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
might be somethign we need to look at... A random address we cna direct all 0 BR utxo's at.

@LabsAssistant 
Update to StakedNotary and StakedChain/komodo 
Please do `git pull` in `~/StakedNotary ` 
And then `start.sh`
I think I fixed the start.sh getting stuck on CFEK also.  Please report if this si not the case... I had one node fail to start CFEKING, but upon a second `start.sh` it worked.

[09-Nov-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This is a huge update ... there has to be bugs, please checkout the new getinofo on KMD and CFEK chains... MLT is likely deaded .. I didnt remove it as of yet, if its not working for you dont worry about it.

[09-Nov-18 02:07 PM] CMaurice#1685
Ok, done, won't be able to check functioning until later though

[09-Nov-18 02:09 PM] gt#2812
working well

[09-Nov-18 02:12 PM] CMaurice#1685
5 chains up with FSM_mempooltest/komodod for MLT

[09-Nov-18 02:15 PM] CMaurice#1685
Yeah, now just connections refused for MLT after start. Back later

[09-Nov-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
MLT is fooked dw about it ... probably should have removed it

[09-Nov-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
infact will do that now

[09-Nov-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Pushed assetchains.json without MLT ... no nede tp update if you already have, unliey its working anyway.

you can do it on `komodo-cli` aswell ... I will write a script to replac ethe wallet resetters at a later date.

[09-Nov-18 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess once we know its stable and definatly causing no isues, it can be automatically called inside the daemon perodically if a node is a staked notary (which they now identify them selvs automatically, do a `getinfo` call üòâ )

[09-Nov-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This was pretty much the last remaining thing a notary node needed for maintenance... pretty much self runnig now I think.

[09-Nov-18 03:05 PM] gt#2812
oh yeah nice update on the getinfo

[09-Nov-18 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That was the hardest thing I had to work out ... the getinfo display was trivial ... its the code that makes it possible that was hard ...

Still  want to try running a notary - can I send a pubkey in?

[10-Nov-18 03:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure at this stage. I think I need to make new chains in a day or 2, you can send pubkey to me and I'll put it into the code if you like

[10-Nov-18 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Started new migrate loops ... From CFEK->LF->ING->ED->CFEK

[10-Nov-18 05:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
10 coins per, 5000 migrates from each chain.

[10-Nov-18 05:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If thesea re all confirmed working in about a day or 2, we can move on from testing MoMoM, and consider it fixed.

[10-Nov-18 05:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if anyne else can do some loops as well that wil be helpful, dont do what I am doing, make sure thate all chains are on latest master, including KMD.

[10-Nov-18 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Had an idea for the 0 BR problem too, we cna just make the wallet ignore utxo with 0 value...

[10-Nov-18 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They exist on chain, as a coninbase, but the wallet will just ignore their existance, seems it cannot spend them anyway.

[10-Nov-18 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Found one possible problem with the cleannwalletnotarisations RPC ... it may require that the wallet is reset to a single utxoo before using it more than once. ... a-team just ended up with a utxo (one that is split) that someehow got left behind after 2 calls of the RPC... I will monitor it, I dont think its an issue if the wallet starts from a single utxo... 

There was some logic I added to stop this from happening, but I can see how it cant work, if there are transacitons more than 3 txs deep saved in the wallet. 
Problem is, is that it deletes the txs that came after this tx, so then the wallet sees this tx as unspent. I didnt add logic to iterate back further than 3 txs deep for preformance reasons, but if starting from 1 utxo then splitting, notarising and running the wallet filter, it will always delete the tx it started with on each run, and should not happen.

[10-Nov-18 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just to amke sure, please dont run the filter more than once on staked notaries, until I have workied this out, you will end up unabe to split utxo and you will stop notarising.

cool üëå

[10-Nov-18 05:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This latest "feature" is hella dangerous... but if I can get it working with no problems, then notary nodes run themselvs, no mainetenace required. Much the same as running any normal master node. üòÑ

[10-Nov-18 05:57 AM] ph03nix#3115
interesting

[10-Nov-18 05:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I want the notary operators to focus on their real job here, and thats decideing what to notarise, and who deservs bug bounties, if they are spending time on maintenace and keepingthe node in an operational state their time might not be focued where it needs to be.

[10-Nov-18 05:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We dont want a situation, where me and Alright, choose which chains everyone should notarise, and blindly follow our orders, the notaries have the power, not us.

[10-Nov-18 06:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
With a heavliy stake based approach, its in notaries best interst financially to do what is best for the network... Effectivly there can even be multiple notary networks playing off against each other competing for chains to notarise, will be very interesting to see hwo it all pans out.

{Reactions}
coolpirate 

[10-Nov-18 06:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although each network of notaries needs a KMD notary node to fund the notarisations to KMD .... otherwise they need to purchase it at mrket value.

[10-Nov-18 06:09 AM] ph03nix#3115
so, is the idea here a bunch of chains all notarizing to each other?

[10-Nov-18 06:11 AM] ph03nix#3115
i've been following but i don't quite get the concept of staked

[10-Nov-18 06:12 AM] ph03nix#3115
i just see a bunch of crazy innovation

[10-Nov-18 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no all chains notariise to KMD

[10-Nov-18 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is one chain called STAKED

[10-Nov-18 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is 51% PoS 49% PoW

[10-Nov-18 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that chain has currency STAKED coin

[10-Nov-18 06:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
A person/entity cna create their own chain, with their own smart contracts... and have staked notaries notarise that chain, it *can* and is most cases should, share the currecny STAKED

[10-Nov-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So you purchase/mine/stake STAKED then burn some of it to create your own chain in the cluster... You cna choose not to burn any STAKED

[10-Nov-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and just create a chain, with 0 supply, then migrate STAKED from anohter chain in the cluster to your chain and do whatever with it.

[10-Nov-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its to allow people to dev/test CC contracts without forcing all other chains in the cluster to have the same contracts

[10-Nov-18 06:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and without having to create new currency for every contract ... as that is unsustaiable

[10-Nov-18 06:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haveing millions of diffrent currenies for each contract seems a bit stupid, when we have the tech to share currency over chains with diffrent consesnus rules.

[10-Nov-18 06:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh we dont even know what STAKED will end up being, our goal is to attract as many devs and smart people as possible, and create thigns people can actually use with KMD tech.
