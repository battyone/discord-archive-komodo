what a joke you want me to fix problems that not my problems

[23-Jun-19 09:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@zaza68 welcome to LABs. We build things.

[23-Jun-19 09:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The joke is that you want us to fix someone else's shitpile of spaghetti that they have for years refused to document or give a rats ass when master doesn't even build 🤷🏽 
I can go on about how and why agama gets no assistance with code and fixes, but I've been told that I've already pissed off too many people this week

[23-Jun-19 09:03 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
If you want to buy and stake, feel free, but we encourage people to experiment and contribute.

[23-Jun-19 09:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Maybe you earn some LABs for doing so. It's called open source, and dev bounty. LABs is not kindergarden.

[23-Jun-19 09:04 AM] zaza68#4573
men you always lika that taking the discusion to shomting els every time i aim only talking about that there was nog info about the wallet

[23-Jun-19 09:04 AM] zaza68#4573
on the website

[23-Jun-19 09:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There's no info about 3rd party wallets because LABS isn't those 3rd parties

[23-Jun-19 09:06 AM] zaza68#4573
smk762 send me the link agama wallet can be useded

[23-Jun-19 09:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
The point of LABs is to learn, test, build. We dont have a big premine dev fund to buy Lambos with. We just build cool shit

Verus Agama may or may not work with a given coin other than VRSC at any given moment and if it breaks for any of those coins you'll likely get no support

[23-Jun-19 09:08 AM] zaza68#4573
yes now your ar talking

[23-Jun-19 09:09 AM] zaza68#4573

[23-Jun-19 09:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If it doesn't work, be sure to tell them and not us

pretty simple PR....

[23-Jun-19 09:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mike does his own thing at his own pace and I'm not even getting involved in the mess of all that

[23-Jun-19 09:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Wallet not a priority right now.

[23-Jun-19 09:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
We have one that works weel enough for GUI users

[23-Jun-19 09:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
everyone really doing anything is on CLI

[23-Jun-19 09:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
PR something that directly effects VRSC and he'll likely fix it asap, anything else: meh

[23-Jun-19 09:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Once NN season 3 starts and all that business is done, maybe can consider alternatives etc.

[23-Jun-19 09:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
On Graviex already, Zaddex soon enough, so those not building can store and trade with that and Verus Agama until then

[23-Jun-19 09:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The problem is that there's nothing simple about making a "simple" GUI wallet

[23-Jun-19 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe if I ever run out of things to do, I can port LABS to Ocean, doesnt seem that hard to just add consensus code to it so it can sync. Doesnt need any other features.

[23-Jun-19 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright said he was close to getting electrum with trezor and nano support working, but who knows if we will ever see him again after this last week 😂

[23-Jun-19 09:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Verus did well to release 5.7.1 with wider coin support so soon after KMD Agama problems.

If you can get it to build with the current core base, I'd be willing to do the rest; I just don't know enough about makefiles to get it there

[23-Jun-19 10:50 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @zaza68,
The GUI wallet was days from being up, when outside events raise their ugly head.

[23-Jun-19 10:54 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll add info on wallets to the site.

[23-Jun-19 10:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks for pointing that out.

[23-Jun-19 12:39 PM] CrisF#3405
Wallet info can be found on the website here: `https://kmdlabs.com/main-cluster/#wallet`.
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator , could you please check and let me know if there are any corrections?
BTW, you have a clone, `smk762#7826`. 
```
Wallets

CLI wallet – As the CLI (Command Line Interface) wallet is an integral part of most tests conducted in KMDLabs it is recommended that one become familiar with it.

The KMDLabs Notary Node CLI wallet is one of the areas that has undergone a fair amount of development work.  Methods of wallet ‘cleaning’ and DWY attack prevention, resistance and recovery have been a particular area of research and development.

The CLI wallet is currently the only method for staking the LABS coin. Staking is simple as setgenerate true 0. For more advanced staking strategies scripts that work in conjunction with the CLI wallet are available in the KMDLabs Github repo.

3rd party GUI wallets – For those that prefer a GUI wallet LABS can be used with the VERUS Agama GUI wallet.  Further 3rd party wallet partnerships are being sought and and any inquiries regarding adding LABS are welcome.

Exchange wallets – It is NOT recommended to keep LABS in exchange wallets for anything more than immediate trading.  Currently this is possible on Graviex and shortly on the ZADDEX exchange.

GUI / Wallet Development – KMDLabs will be developing a GUI wallet in the future, although this is not a priority.  GUI devs / devs who are interested in building and testing in this area are very welcome to get in touch.
```

Actually, everyone please check :abusedsmily:

[23-Jun-19 12:52 PM] CrisF#3405
I wasn't able to find my hi-res image of the coin icon.  If anyone has one could you please send it to me?

[23-Jun-19 12:54 PM] zatJUM#9924
There was a high res PNG posted above, but I haven't seen a SVG or AI one. Who drawn it?

[23-Jun-19 12:55 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I didn't find it with search.  Will look again.  Thanks @zatJUM 😃

[23-Jun-19 12:56 PM] CrisF#3405
The image came from KMD marketing relating to the re-brand.

[23-Jun-19 01:01 PM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, I found it (embed not link).  Think it might be same resolution as I had but will try.
We have to get back to this after things get going...

[24-Jun-19 07:01 AM] zatJUM#9924
Just ```pkill -15 iguana``` then ```./start_iguana.sh``` could be ok

[24-Jun-19 07:01 AM] Exile13#4458
Ok

[24-Jun-19 07:05 AM] CHMEX#0686
Maybe add some ram
I had to upgrade to 8gb and now it works again

[24-Jun-19 07:05 AM] Exile13#4458

[24-Jun-19 07:28 AM] Exile13#4458
launch iguana then labs?

[24-Jun-19 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it should be running it all automatically man

[24-Jun-19 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you should not have to do anything but start.sh

[24-Jun-19 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
something is very wrong

[24-Jun-19 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But I dont have time to debug this atm

[24-Jun-19 07:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
restart your server

[24-Jun-19 07:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
