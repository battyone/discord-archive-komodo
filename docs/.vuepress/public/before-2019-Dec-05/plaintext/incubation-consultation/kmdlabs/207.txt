I'm thinking more for normal transactions that people might use them for in the future.

[08-Jan-19 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure thats the best idea...

[08-Jan-19 03:46 PM] TonyL#3577
By my observations it allows to win few mins

[08-Jan-19 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when waiting for notarisation... 60 is block time.. doens tmake a lot of sense going faster...

[08-Jan-19 03:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe loop started on half of time left for the net block

[08-Jan-19 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe 30-90 wouild be better not sure

[08-Jan-19 03:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Or on 80% elapsed time lets say

[08-Jan-19 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
trick is to try and spread them out

[08-Jan-19 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
however you acheive that

[08-Jan-19 03:47 PM] CrisF#3405
Not seeing anythong on the explorer yet.

[08-Jan-19 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
starting 1 each second and using fixed value... as soon as notarisation happens a heap of them end up syncronised

[08-Jan-19 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems I made invalid txs

[08-Jan-19 03:48 PM] TonyL#3577
My 500 export transactions were confirmed

[08-Jan-19 03:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Waiting for import txs creating

import fails... took fee from wrong place

[08-Jan-19 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pushed fix

[08-Jan-19 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that didnt work

[08-Jan-19 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
btw

[08-Jan-19 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cant take fee that way...

[08-Jan-19 03:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Is it means that fix will not work as well?

[08-Jan-19 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
rebuild

👌 

[08-Jan-19 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the way I took fee is not possible

[08-Jan-19 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its back to 0

[08-Jan-19 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with a default max priority for all imports

[08-Jan-19 03:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔  I think maybe I did -ve instead of +ve for fee

{Reactions}
🤔 

[08-Jan-19 03:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
even so.... the amount in funded tx is wrong...

[08-Jan-19 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no it wont work in any case... Im stupid... what it used to do was only check if you burnt too small amount .. if you burnt too much then it would refuse to import.

[08-Jan-19 04:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what I just did was make it burn 0.0001 less than the amount... which is the only check it used to have... of course it wasnt going to work

[08-Jan-19 04:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
need to change the code back how it was and add new check to not let too much...  this will allow user to set txfee as they wish under existing rules.

[08-Jan-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i changed the code to check for txfee

{Reactions}
👍 

[08-Jan-19 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
added random sleeps... one every 0.5s no problem with load here..

[08-Jan-19 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1000 migrate at once

[08-Jan-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems that code got lost in some merge

[08-Jan-19 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure... I changed it to be a static value equal to sum of vouts

[08-Jan-19 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe it was a conflict and I just skipped it

[08-Jan-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
its there:

[08-Jan-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
if (totalOut > burnAmount || totalOut < burnAmount-txfee )
            return Invalid("payout-too-high-or-too-low");

[08-Jan-19 04:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is fine... weird though because the priority means the more you send, the less fee you need

[08-Jan-19 04:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no.. I'll grab your code and copy it over

[08-Jan-19 04:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
payout-too-high-or-too-low happens yes

[08-Jan-19 04:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on import

[08-Jan-19 04:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but not export creation

[08-Jan-19 04:10 PM] TonyL#3577
For me only imports stuck - exports always smooth

[08-Jan-19 04:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
exports a standard burn

[08-Jan-19 04:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there isnt anything really stopping you destoying coins there apart form checks in the code at RPC level

[08-Jan-19 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
import is consensus rules

[08-Jan-19 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its always failed on import

[08-Jan-19 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if something is wrong

[08-Jan-19 04:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Is it have sense to test now or more fixes needed?

[08-Jan-19 04:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I already did 192 imports

[08-Jan-19 04:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just then

[08-Jan-19 04:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sending 2 coins... you should try with small amoutn and see if works ? I set mining priority to max for import txzns

[08-Jan-19 04:13 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm trying with 0.001 as before yep

[08-Jan-19 04:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I added a modified version of Alrights's getconf function to your `migrate.py` to get rpc info from conf files

Waiting tooo long for complete txs broadcasting to destination chain

[08-Jan-19 04:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
merged but tony wanted to keep it to use remot server

[08-Jan-19 04:15 PM] TonyL#3577
I'll use my own repo so 😃

[08-Jan-19 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the small amout may still be fucking with it hey

[08-Jan-19 04:15 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
ah. can rename thatt o something else

[08-Jan-19 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
IM getting liek accept faliure.7 in stdout

[08-Jan-19 04:17 PM] TonyL#3577
It's not a big deal - if everybody wants to use configs parsing I'm in minority here so will just use code from my fork of this scripts repo

[08-Jan-19 04:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Same same

[08-Jan-19 04:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Sometimes it's stackoverflow ctrl +c ctrl +v

[08-Jan-19 04:21 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
then ctl-z, search again :abusedsmily:

☝ 

[08-Jan-19 04:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
most of my code is copy paste...

[08-Jan-19 04:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Usually then ctrl-z - go to https://docs.python.org

[08-Jan-19 04:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
writing from scratch is still far away here

```./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKY getrawmempool | jq length

[08-Jan-19 04:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Mempool behaviour seems the same on my side @blackjok3r

[08-Jan-19 04:27 PM] TonyL#3577
But I'm not mine

[08-Jan-19 04:27 PM] TonyL#3577
let me try to enable it

[08-Jan-19 04:31 PM] TonyL#3577
And again mempool cleaning only for 1-2 tx per block

[08-Jan-19 04:33 PM] TonyL#3577
@blackjok3r just to be sure: are we on same komodod commit atm?

[08-Jan-19 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[08-Jan-19 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems to be the nValue is too small

[08-Jan-19 04:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im using 2 coins and already 500 cleared of 1000

[08-Jan-19 04:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
either that or not rebroadcasting constantly the import tx

[08-Jan-19 04:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Seems it's stucked just dead now

[08-Jan-19 04:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Even not 1-2 per block

[08-Jan-19 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
even 1000 loops of bash script is not much load with random sleeps.... I think can increase to 3000 even maybe 5000

[08-Jan-19 04:37 PM] TonyL#3577
How to get many coins on CFEKY?

[08-Jan-19 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mine

[08-Jan-19 04:37 PM] TonyL#3577
I can try with 2 coins too

[08-Jan-19 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
10000 BR

[08-Jan-19 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or I can send
