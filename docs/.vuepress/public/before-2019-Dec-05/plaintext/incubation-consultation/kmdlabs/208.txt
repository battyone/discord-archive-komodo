if ( tx.IsCoinBase() && tx.vout[0].nValue == 0 )
            return false;

[08-Jan-19 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for all nodes

[08-Jan-19 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if there is a tx fee it should show

[08-Jan-19 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that might actaully have some errors in some cases maybe?

[08-Jan-19 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
shoudl possibly be whole tx value == 0

[08-Jan-19 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure that applies to these chains in any case though

[08-Jan-19 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as there is a block reward on both

[08-Jan-19 04:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEKX mining node here locked

[08-Jan-19 05:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Nothing helps me to see the balance with migrations

[08-Jan-19 05:04 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm even tried to delete whole folder with wallet.dat

[08-Jan-19 05:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
send addres i just mined a heap of coins

[08-Jan-19 05:04 PM] TonyL#3577
https://cfeky.kmdlabs.io/address/RHq3JsvLxU45Z8ufYS6RsDpSG4wi6ucDev I should have `10.8553 KMD`

[08-Jan-19 05:04 PM] TonyL#3577
But getting `./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKY getbalance
9.93630000
`

[08-Jan-19 05:05 PM] TonyL#3577
9.9 it's how many I should have without successful migrations

[08-Jan-19 05:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
explorer could be wrong

[08-Jan-19 05:05 PM] TonyL#3577
`RHq3JsvLxU45Z8ufYS6RsDpSG4wi6ucDev` try to send some here please

[08-Jan-19 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```$ ./assets-cli sendtoaddress RHq3JsvLxU45Z8ufYS6RsDpSG4wi6ucDev
 30000

[08-Jan-19 05:06 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKY getbalance

```

[08-Jan-19 05:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Your tx displayed fine

[08-Jan-19 05:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Technically... the notary filter should accept any tx sent to itself (change) maybe bug? or explorer is wrong

[08-Jan-19 05:07 PM] TonyL#3577
I had only 10 coins on both of the chains

[08-Jan-19 05:08 PM] TonyL#3577
So was easy to track balances

dude u need to start with more utxos.... trying to spend tooi many mempool inputs

[08-Jan-19 05:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
too many dependant txs breaks everything

[08-Jan-19 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I swear that used to be a hard limit.... must have been removed at some point......

[08-Jan-19 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my nodes are all flooding `inputs not found`

[08-Jan-19 05:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm never get this error

[08-Jan-19 05:18 PM] TonyL#3577
But I'm trying only 500

[08-Jan-19 05:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on your own node no....

[08-Jan-19 05:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mine arte both behind firewall

[08-Jan-19 05:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so are relayed from other nodes.... I cant accept a tx from a node unles the dependant arrives first... which isnt how the mempool works

[08-Jan-19 05:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it randomly chooses

[08-Jan-19 05:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so your nodes getting errors that I don't have enough inputs?

[08-Jan-19 05:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for the scale test... I had to do some silly things.... there can only be 2 nodes... it loops the change back to itself... if u have more than 2 nodes... then mempool breaks

[08-Jan-19 05:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... What happens is, your node is spending coins from mempool.... and the tx arrive out of order

[08-Jan-19 05:21 PM] TonyL#3577
I  see

[08-Jan-19 05:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think half odf KMDICE issues were of similar origin

[08-Jan-19 05:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Can make check in migration script

[08-Jan-19 05:22 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a if UTXOs amount < than desired amount of migrations

[08-Jan-19 05:22 PM] TonyL#3577
It's preparing it first

[08-Jan-19 05:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Really ideally.... the migrate script should not use `fundrawtransaction`... but actually take a utxo and use createrawtransaction properly

[08-Jan-19 05:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then this cant happen

[08-Jan-19 05:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this was my idea for ping=pong blaster

[08-Jan-19 05:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont flood dependant txs... unless u have most of the hash power on that node

[08-Jan-19 05:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or u can use wallet with huge amount of utxo to crate export

[08-Jan-19 05:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, I'll add such check and UTXOs preparation to script so

[08-Jan-19 05:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... I'm not sure why but the daemon didt used to let u make this many dependants

[08-Jan-19 05:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its an extreme edgecase in any case

[08-Jan-19 05:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you really have to try to break it

[08-Jan-19 05:29 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKY getrawmempool | jq length
500
```

[08-Jan-19 05:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
187

[08-Jan-19 05:31 PM] TonyL#3577
I didn't prepare UTXOs for this bunch - genie was already outside of bottle when you said about it üòÉ

üòã 

[08-Jan-19 05:31 PM] TonyL#3577
So all 500 get straight to the mempool

[08-Jan-19 05:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my node stopped sending mempool aswell

[08-Jan-19 05:32 PM] TonyL#3577
``` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKY getrawmempool | jq length
501```

[08-Jan-19 05:33 PM] TonyL#3577
So my mempool broke yours mempool?

[08-Jan-19 05:33 PM] TonyL#3577
