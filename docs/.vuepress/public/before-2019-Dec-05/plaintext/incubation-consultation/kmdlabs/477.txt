only really posted it to let folks know why the pool was down for an hr

[06-Sep-19 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
huh?

[06-Sep-19 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
anywho, since I've got the pool terminal open, is there any of the CFEK chains anyone wants added to it

[06-Sep-19 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or not

```Ticket HQK-92VJC has been updated by Breanne Crawford [staff].

Hello,

We are in the process of performing infrastructure upgrades, and this process will require us to migrate your instance to another hardware host node as these upgrades are performed.

Due to the size of the referenced instance, an offline migration will be necessary.

Please update this ticket to let us know when would be best to proceed. If we are able to perform this migration at any time, please also let us know

If we do not hear from you within 48 hours, the process will be automatically performed, and the instance will be powered down until the task is complete.

Instances of this size typically take 1 to 3 hours to complete migration.

We appreciate you choosing Vultr!```

@LabsAssistant 
Please `./stop.sh` and `./start.sh` 
To replace CFEMMYLO9 with CFEKOD which is an ondemand chain that should notarize the same as a KMD on demand chain like SUPERNET etc.  
There are also consensus updates to iguana, to remove ban for detecting bad/spent utxos being sent.  I need to work out how to trigger the detection in a controlled way at some point to test it. For now though we are interested in the frequency of notarizations. I have changed it so that it does not abort a notarization if the next block height arrives before the previous finishes. It now waits until a notarization has been been sucessful, then aborts any rounds still running that were for a block before this. 
To test we need to alternate fast and slow block times, so cycle hash rate on and off.

finally righted itself now that I said something 😛

lol

[07-Sep-19 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
129 here... I guess need some tx gen.. or something to keep it moving..

[07-Sep-19 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
idea is to stal it, trhewn shit blocks. and make sure it still able to notarize

[07-Sep-19 11:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can make it move if you want 😛

[07-Sep-19 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
before at freq 2 it would reset constantly... but having the kmd height the way it was made nodes disagree

[07-Sep-19 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it now, waits 10 kmd blocks since last sucessful nota. adn wi start a dpow round every 2 blocks until one is sucessful then end the rest

[07-Sep-19 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my brain is shot so I'm going to ask a dumb question that I'm just too lazy to check myself....
LABS chains uses the same tx comfs = 1 until notarized as KMD chains, yes?

[07-Sep-19 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`To test we need to alternate fast and slow block times, so cycle hash rate on and off.`
5 minutes on 10 minutes off sound good?

[07-Sep-19 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sorry, @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  was busy. 
No, The amount of requried KMD blocks varies atm. LABS is 3, CFEK is 2, and the CFEKOD chain is 10, same as KMD mainnet.

[07-Sep-19 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by 'tx comfs = 1 until notarized', I meant rawconfirmations vs confirmations

[07-Sep-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LOL sorry, yes thats is the same.

[07-Sep-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Has anyone else been getting utxos running out? or is uit just because my node was mining and had 30,000 tx in wallet ?

[07-Sep-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEKAPOW in particular  just keeps breaking

[07-Sep-19 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
utxos in listunspent but do not show in dpowlistunspent

[07-Sep-19 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
weird, because the exact same code works on other chains

[07-Sep-19 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
other than the hiccup I had with mylo6, I haven't had any issues but I've only had like up to 5500 txes in history

The bestk rotates.. it will notarize each chain a while then sto phten start agin. if its broken restart everything

[07-Sep-19 05:40 PM] Nabob#5004
relauching start script again, let me check if have updates

as a non-operator, what is the best way i can start syncing any of hte mylo cluster?

[09-Sep-19 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
use StakedNotary, and just run the ./assetchains

[09-Sep-19 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it should launc all chains in a screen

[09-Sep-19 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going to depreciate the staked repo, and have just the one for notary and non-notary but ahvent had time. Needs a lot of code clean up and branchs fixed etc..

[09-Sep-19 06:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think i am also going to merge down all the code from nSPV2 and from jls repo upstream, there are fixes we need, and the nSPV  stuff does not appear to break anything.

[09-Sep-19 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@SHossain  You need to remove wallet.dat and restart CFEKMYLO. I had the same thing keep happening on a bunch of chains, pretty sure its now fixed. 
If this happens again please DM me directly, goes for anyone else aswell.

[09-Sep-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[09-Sep-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it may... I think maybe start.sh has a bug where it wont stop all daemons on utxo cache branch.. if you see that tell me

[09-Sep-19 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
octetstring too... may have to do start a few times

its a rare bug...

[09-Sep-19 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181

dfo it again

other wise it needs a stop first I guess.. its taken me all day to get it working. I updated lots

[09-Sep-19 02:18 PM] SHossain#0007
i issued `./start.sh` 5 times

[09-Sep-19 02:18 PM] SHossain#0007

[09-Sep-19 02:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[09-Sep-19 02:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
can you do ./komodod from master dir? /StakedNotary/komodo/master

[09-Sep-19 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what does it say ?

[09-Sep-19 02:26 PM] SHossain#0007
it starts fine

Thanks, @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢.
I got this on `pkill -15 komodod` ```/include/boost/thread/pthread/recursive_mutex.hpp:113: void boost::recursive_mutex::lock(): Assertion `!pthread_mutex_lock(&m)' failed. ```
Seems it means unable to lock mutex(thread?) when it shutdown...

[13-Sep-19 11:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you'll get that every now and then on a forced shutdown (or crash) in the middle of a loop

[13-Sep-19 11:48 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, that makes sense.  It was on THC which was running a staking loop.  Don't recall seeing that before.
