so dont worry about it

[10-Mar-19 05:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
that exaplins it lol

[10-Mar-19 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure what would cause coinsupply to break..

[10-Mar-19 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well not yet its not, but we need to kill it shortly

[10-Mar-19 05:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I thought maybe wallet needed reindex. 🤷

[10-Mar-19 05:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
coinsupply is a variable stroed int eh block index, butits not saved to disk

[10-Mar-19 05:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and as such needs to be recaculated froms cratch in the even of a restart

[10-Mar-19 05:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
could be cos old/wrong version of daemon too

[10-Mar-19 05:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doubt ful

[10-Mar-19 05:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I havent  changed anything to do with that...

[10-Mar-19 05:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or anything consensus realted on daemon side in weeks

[10-Mar-19 05:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe you will ahve better results with `gettxoutset` ?

[10-Mar-19 05:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
coinsupply measures Z address funds and stuff its a LOT slower

[10-Mar-19 05:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
``` komodo-cli -ac_name=LABSTH0 coinsupply
{
  "error": "couldnt calculate supply"
}
```

[10-Mar-19 05:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats descriptive

[10-Mar-19 05:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[10-Mar-19 05:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine is the same 😂

[10-Mar-19 05:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
haven't looked at rpc source to dig deeper. but if yours is same at least I know its not just my setup

[10-Mar-19 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems it cant see a heap of transactions any more... strange

[10-Mar-19 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe the tempfile fix purged a bunch of orphans 🤔

[10-Mar-19 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There wil no doubt some issues with that thing I would say... As the txindex doesn't update to remove the deleted blocks.... so anything thats looking for orphans will  no longer be able to find them.

[10-Mar-19 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I never finished that part of it... I would say a reindex will fix the problem.. if its that. testing now

[10-Mar-19 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nope lol

[10-Mar-19 05:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

that works, but it ignores Z funds

ummm LOL

[10-Mar-19 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think coinsupply knows what to do with import txns man...

[10-Mar-19 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LABSTH is the same, spamming errors wheile runnign for not found txn

[10-Mar-19 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
importtombstone most likely

[10-Mar-19 05:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what about notarypay?  I've had a whole lot of fuckabout trying to calc that correct, but seems coinsupply was ignoring it

[10-Mar-19 05:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
could be cos I was assuming ntx every 5 blocks, but last test with that taken into account alos seemed not included

[10-Mar-19 05:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
still testing tho

[10-Mar-19 05:58 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and if you were losing migrates that could explain it

[10-Mar-19 05:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notarypay is just a normal coinbase ... what you would need to do is ignore the coinbase ....

[10-Mar-19 05:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I lost a shit toonne of migrates, only 1 coin

[10-Mar-19 05:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but hundreds of them... its too ahrd to manaylly go through and get them back usign the altest fix for a test chain...

[10-Mar-19 05:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
picked a few out of the list from random times, and adding a block to  kmd height until a diffrent MoMoM was returned, allwod it to import evey time

[10-Mar-19 05:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll need to look at the same time as you migrate when it seems to be working to see if the graph returns true

[10-Mar-19 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the getimports isnt useful for this?

[10-Mar-19 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess maybe not

[10-Mar-19 06:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe, havent looked at it yet

[10-Mar-19 06:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would say that would be the easiest way to track migrates... just call if for a range of blocks and add all the totals up for those blocks ... That tracks the supply arriving to a chain ... gettxoutsetinfo will give you the current unspents total

[10-Mar-19 06:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Either that or I need to fix coinsupply to track imports properly

[10-Mar-19 06:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its clearly just getting prev vout .... whcih imports dont have any ....

[10-Mar-19 06:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so its just errors

[10-Mar-19 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have removed all chains from assetchains.json apart from CFEKORKL

[10-Mar-19 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When Alright shows up he can make new ones for DIMXY cluster.

[10-Mar-19 06:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing speical needed for the next round of testing. Just his cluster will be fine. CFEKORKL stays as is, we can add a 0 BR chain to its cluster later on if we need to.

[10-Mar-19 07:25 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r 😫 what happened?

[10-Mar-19 07:26 AM] Alright#0419
`  "sprout": -3136730201.12831329,` someone using the sprout bug? 😅

[10-Mar-19 08:38 AM] Alright#0419
@dimxy are you around? trying to figure out what is needed for these 2 new chains

[10-Mar-19 08:38 AM] Alright#0419
same as before basically? just with that code you PR'd?

[10-Mar-19 08:39 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, same like CFEKDIMXY, fungible chains

[10-Mar-19 08:39 AM] Alright#0419
ok, give me about an hour and I'll start them up

[10-Mar-19 08:40 AM] Alright#0419
What exactly was PR'd? Consensus changes or just rpc stuff?

[10-Mar-19 08:40 AM] dimxy#2587
great, thanks!

[10-Mar-19 08:40 AM] Alright#0419
consensus, yes? if so, what changed?

[10-Mar-19 08:40 AM] dimxy#2587
import tx changed

[10-Mar-19 08:40 AM] dimxy#2587
yes consensus

[10-Mar-19 08:40 AM] Alright#0419
changed how?

[10-Mar-19 08:41 AM] dimxy#2587
I extended proof object in the import tx opret

[10-Mar-19 08:41 AM] dimxy#2587
to store new notary approval txids

[10-Mar-19 08:42 AM] Alright#0419
Not sure I understand. Is this a mechanism for recovering failed imports?

[10-Mar-19 08:44 AM] dimxy#2587
that is,  there is a TxProof object for momom migrateion proof in the opret.
I needed to store a vector of notary approval txids
So I did a container object ImportProof to be able to store either TxProof or txid vector.

[10-Mar-19 08:45 AM] dimxy#2587
what do you mean by 'recovering failed imports'? to maintain compatibility with the previous import txes?

[10-Mar-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
baggage claim

[10-Mar-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
that is what this was called

[10-Mar-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
the backup mechanism to recover burned coins on failed MoMoM

[10-Mar-19 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
so if we can get normal MoMoM to 99.9% success, then this method is needed in 0.1% of cases

{Reactions}
labs 

[10-Mar-19 09:05 AM] dimxy#2587
The workflow for this backup solution:
* On the source chain user calls migrate_createburntransaction, sends the burn tx to the chain and sends its txid and the source chain name to the notary operators (off-chain)
* the notary operators call migrate_checkburntransactionsource on the source chain
* on the destination chain the notary operators call migrate_createnotaryapprovaltransaction and pass the burn txid and txoutproof received from the previous call, 
* the notary operators send the approval transactions to the dest chain and send their txids back to the user (off-chain)
* on the source chain the user calls migrate_createimporttransaction and passes to it notary txids as additional parameters (the rpc adds them to the import tx opret as proof object)
* then the user sends the import transaction to the destination chain (where the notary approvals will be validated by the eval::ImportCoin validation code)

[10-Mar-19 10:01 AM] Alright#0419
@dimxy can you take a look at this branch https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/commits/migratetest
does it have everything you need or should I be using master branch for these new chains?

joker has 2 commits not in migratetest branch

[10-Mar-19 10:04 AM] Alright#0419
just doing master for now, shouldn't be a problem to create a branch for it specifically if something in master changes

[10-Mar-19 10:28 AM] dimxy#2587
seems all is okay.
There is one question about how many those notary approvals are enough for import tx proof.
There is a 'minsig' variable == (number of pubkeys / 5 +1) but now it is set to 5.
Maybe for initial testing it is better to fix it to just 1 or set it to 'minsig'?

[10-Mar-19 10:30 AM] Alright#0419
you need a lower minsig count for these chains? is that what you're saying?

[10-Mar-19 10:31 AM] Alright#0419
just started them with default min sig count which is either 5 or 6 as of right now

[10-Mar-19 10:32 AM] Alright#0419
will restart them with a lower count if you want

[10-Mar-19 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
ready to push the new chains if min sigs 5 is fine

[10-Mar-19 10:35 AM] Alright#0419
if not, I just need to know what exactly to edit. I know it must be changed in more than one place, just not exactly sure where

[10-Mar-19 10:36 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, I thought maybe it is good to set minsig count to low value to test this update engaging  only 1-2 notary operators

[10-Mar-19 10:36 AM] dimxy#2587
if it is not needed then no

[10-Mar-19 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
ok I know it requires editing at least 1 thing in komodod and 1 thing in iguana

[10-Mar-19 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
I know where it is in komodod, not sure about iguana side of it

[10-Mar-19 10:37 AM] Alright#0419
I don't think getting 5 NN to coordinate should be a problem honestly

[10-Mar-19 10:37 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
It's harder to get all notaries to aggree on minsigs than just leave it at 5 - you would need to change port as Joker did I think to ensure

[10-Mar-19 10:38 AM] Alright#0419
@dimxy ok, I can start these now with min sigs 5 or we can wait for joker

[10-Mar-19 10:38 AM] Alright#0419
I'm not sure anyone understands the changes needed to iguana besides him

[10-Mar-19 10:39 AM] Alright#0419
I can try to do it, but I have a feeling it requires a separate branch of iguana

[10-Mar-19 10:39 AM] Alright#0419
which means it's not an automated install from notaries

[10-Mar-19 10:39 AM] Alright#0419
these chains are ready to go right now if min sigs 5 is fine

[10-Mar-19 10:40 AM] Alright#0419
I think I'll launch them. don't think it'll be much trouble to launch another pair with lower min sigs if need be
