what is it doing right before:

[02-Dec-19 05:36 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
341 seconds until elegible, waiting.

[02-Dec-19 05:45 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
it seems like its mining

[02-Dec-19 06:18 AM] Alright#0419
it's waiting :troll:

[02-Dec-19 06:19 AM] Alright#0419
no really, though, it's just waiting

[02-Dec-19 06:26 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
waiting for what?

[02-Dec-19 06:26 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
my cpu seem to be humming pretty good right around those times

[02-Dec-19 06:28 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
right before the waiting time

`waiting for what?`
341 seconds until elegible

[02-Dec-19 06:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
lol

[02-Dec-19 06:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok

[02-Dec-19 06:30 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`341 seconds until eligible`
means that it's 341 seconds until your "earliest" eligible UTXO __can__ be attempted to be staked

[02-Dec-19 06:31 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
any CPU cycles you see being used before then are the process by which it keeps checking if you have anything else available to stake sooner

>time went by, can I go now?
>>no
.....
>OK, more time went by, can I go now?
>>no

[02-Dec-19 06:33 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
dude

[02-Dec-19 06:33 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
brah

[02-Dec-19 06:33 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
python suck

[02-Dec-19 06:33 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[02-Dec-19 06:34 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
well ya,bro

:troll_lol:

[02-Dec-19 06:34 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i think - ill study bash tomorrow

[02-Dec-19 06:35 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
each has its purpose and pros/cons

[02-Dec-19 06:35 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i couldnt get a simple  timer to work - all because staker.py ends after function is used

[02-Dec-19 06:35 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
simple ass timer

[02-Dec-19 06:36 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
for a vast many things py > shell scripts

[02-Dec-19 06:36 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i could plobably sleep on it and write a cpu consuming timer

[02-Dec-19 06:36 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
or learn how to mark timestamps

[02-Dec-19 06:37 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
bash blows goats at repeating non-linear loops (goto for us old guys)

[02-Dec-19 06:38 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i just wanted to add a simple block timer with::

[02-Dec-19 06:38 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
height = getblock_result['height']
    print('[' + str(height) + ']<<--is NOT your block HOMIE!')
    timestamp2 = datetime.datetime.now()
    #sinceLBtime = timestamp2 - timestamp1
    print('its been' + str(end - start) + ' minutes since last mined block')
    subprocess.call(["aplay" , "-q" , "/home/kmdkrazy/pos64staker/fart2.wav"])

[02-Dec-19 06:38 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
look Greek to me

[02-Dec-19 06:39 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
probably

[02-Dec-19 06:39 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_doesn't speak py_

[02-Dec-19 06:39 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
yeah well -- me either

[02-Dec-19 06:40 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_wanders off back to bed_

[02-Dec-19 06:45 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
will learn how to gosub to either sh or py tomorrow

[02-Dec-19 07:52 AM] Alright#0419
you just want a timer from when you last staked/mined a block?

[02-Dec-19 07:52 AM] Alright#0419
btw that waiting thing.... we tried to tweak it in testsyncfix branch. Occasionally, it is waiting when it shouldn't be atm

[02-Dec-19 10:05 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
it really sounds like it is mining right before it starts waiting

[02-Dec-19 10:06 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
trying to make a timer show lenght of time since last block

[02-Dec-19 10:06 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
using csv file atm -  im sure I could querry something you know of easier

[02-Dec-19 10:07 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
parsing is fundimental  - so I am learning - but would love a quick fix

[02-Dec-19 10:08 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
with open('time.csv') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=',')
    f = open("time.csv","r")
    if f.mode == "r":
        LBTtime  =  f.read
    nowtime = (time.time())    
    sincetime = (nowtime - LBTtime)

[02-Dec-19 10:08 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'float' and 'builtin_function_or_method'

[02-Dec-19 10:08 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
thats where I am at

[02-Dec-19 10:09 AM] Alright#0419
do you use -pubkey=?

[02-Dec-19 10:11 AM] Alright#0419
@kmdkrazy

[02-Dec-19 10:12 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
oh --- im toatlly just messing with the py scripts so I can learn py

[02-Dec-19 10:12 AM] Alright#0419
iterate over listunspent output

[02-Dec-19 10:12 AM] Alright#0419
look for smallest amount of confs with "generated", true

[02-Dec-19 10:13 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
it has a time stamp?

[02-Dec-19 10:14 AM] Alright#0419
no, but it has txid

[02-Dec-19 10:15 AM] Alright#0419
do getrawtransaction(<TXID>, 2) on that to get blocktime

[02-Dec-19 10:17 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
yeah - I saw that earlier - didnt know how to use  it

[02-Dec-19 10:21 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i was  close  with the  csv method  and will probably need  to  learn both  anyway...

[02-Dec-19 10:21 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
was going to look into bash later today

[02-Dec-19 10:21 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
uniq '/home/kmdkrazy/.komodo/LABS/debug.log' | grep 'generated'|uniq -c|wc -l

[02-Dec-19 10:22 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
figure out how to find the last ones timestamp

[02-Dec-19 10:22 AM] Alright#0419
I can show you how to do it in python

[02-Dec-19 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
probably best you try it yourself first though

[02-Dec-19 10:23 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i saw the code

[02-Dec-19 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
what code?

[02-Dec-19 10:23 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i will try to make a def

[02-Dec-19 10:23 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
hold up

[02-Dec-19 10:25 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
segid = extract_segid(i, listunspent_result)
 segids.append(segid)

[02-Dec-19 10:25 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
listunspent_result = rpc_connection.listunspent()

[02-Dec-19 10:26 AM] Alright#0419
?

[02-Dec-19 10:27 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
calling the - iterate over listunspent output

[02-Dec-19 10:27 AM] Alright#0419
don't know what those first two lines are, but the 3rd is what you would want to start with

[02-Dec-19 10:27 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
right

[02-Dec-19 10:28 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
the first 2 line is what I saw

[02-Dec-19 10:28 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
that  I need to change

[02-Dec-19 10:28 AM] Alright#0419
saw where? not sure what you're talking about

[02-Dec-19 10:28 AM] Alright#0419
I'll make you a script to do it if you want, but I think you should try it yourself first

[02-Dec-19 10:28 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
stakerlib.py

[02-Dec-19 10:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
it has you  listed as an author

[02-Dec-19 10:29 AM] Alright#0419
nice to see you coding man 游땏

[02-Dec-19 10:29 AM] Alright#0419
because I am?

[02-Dec-19 10:29 AM] Alright#0419
for the most part at least

[02-Dec-19 10:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i would hope so

[02-Dec-19 10:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill work on defs tomorrow

[02-Dec-19 10:30 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
its all just like back in the day BASIC

[02-Dec-19 10:30 AM] Alright#0419
defs?

[02-Dec-19 10:30 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
def sendmanyloop(rpc_connection, amount, utxos):

[02-Dec-19 10:30 AM] Alright#0419
lol what are you trying to do

[02-Dec-19 10:30 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
going to make the TUI smarter

[02-Dec-19 10:31 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
more  intuitive

[02-Dec-19 10:31 AM] Alright#0419
lol please

[02-Dec-19 10:31 AM] Alright#0419
what branch are you using?

[02-Dec-19 10:31 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
[262473]<<--is NOT your block HOMIE!

[02-Dec-19 10:31 AM] Alright#0419
lol

[02-Dec-19 10:32 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i was  using  master

[02-Dec-19 10:32 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i think  they  are  the same

[02-Dec-19 10:32 AM] Alright#0419
is definitely not the same

[02-Dec-19 10:32 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i  didnt link or  fork

[02-Dec-19 10:32 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
or whatever

[02-Dec-19 10:32 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
just copied   and paste

[02-Dec-19 10:33 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
they all said January  -- I think - havent been there  for hours

[02-Dec-19 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
would use restart branch

[02-Dec-19 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
or macwintest if you have time to debug things
