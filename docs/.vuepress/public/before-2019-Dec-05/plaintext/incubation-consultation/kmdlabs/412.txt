mining plenty of CFEKFEK blocks here with 8 cores on 2700X. If anything its too much hash.... Guess I need to leave ti fora  while or run less cores.

Hi @TonyL ,  do we need pubkeys for the  prices test?

Hi @CrisF ! Pubkeys?

[29-May-19 07:58 AM] TonyL#3577
CFEKBET0 will mature for playing around 2 days

[29-May-19 07:58 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, do we need to prepare anything for the test?

@CrisF Nothing special is needed at the moment, for now just read the decription to prepare a little:

So no split for now and `set generate true` for CFEKFEK only?

[29-May-19 08:02 AM] TonyL#3577
in ~48 hours will be possible to open positions on CFEKBET0 (prices have to accumulate first)

Description above might have a lot of unclear moments - feel free to left comments in google doc if clarifications needed

@LabsAssistant if you didn't do ./start.sh already, hold off. One of the chains needs to be restarted

[29-May-19 08:16 AM] Alright#0419
if you did, `komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKBET0 stop`

I used staked.  Didn't set up BET0.conf

[29-May-19 08:20 AM] CrisF#3405
NN worked fine (re:conf)

[29-May-19 08:21 AM] metaphilibert#0926
i guess LABS and KMD may also be launched under the pricescomp branch?

[29-May-19 08:24 AM] Alright#0419
@metaphilibert what do you mean?

[29-May-19 08:24 AM] Alright#0419
LABS and KMD should always be ran on master unless you're doing some kind of specific testing

[29-May-19 08:25 AM] Alright#0419
we'll typically have a separate branch for each fungible chain

[29-May-19 08:26 AM] metaphilibert#0926
maybe use separate dirs for each, as komodod is used for all

[29-May-19 08:26 AM] metaphilibert#0926
i mean i just build the komodod of pricescomp branch, if i restart komodod (gor KMD or LABS) for any reason, they will run with the pricecomp branch build and not on master

[29-May-19 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
are you talking about your notary?

[29-May-19 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
or staked repo?

[29-May-19 08:27 AM] metaphilibert#0926
staked

[29-May-19 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
they both have branch management, no?

[29-May-19 08:27 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834

[29-May-19 08:29 AM] Alright#0419
you can

aaah yes true branch management in stakednotary, i forgot
advanced project üòâ

[29-May-19 08:30 AM] Alright#0419
it'll be called something else

[29-May-19 08:30 AM] Alright#0419
staked has branch management as well, you just need to use the scripts

[29-May-19 08:30 AM] metaphilibert#0926
on NN no such management yet (you have to do it manually if needed to run different builds of komodod)

[29-May-19 08:32 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r can I rename StakedNotary repo "KMDLabs" then we can use this as both staked and stakednotary?

[29-May-19 08:33 AM] Alright#0419
I realize I need to change some things if I do that

[29-May-19 08:33 AM] Alright#0419
I've really be putting off rewriting it as it as the bash spaghetti does work exceptionally well

[29-May-19 08:33 AM] Alright#0419
just hard to debug when it doesn't ü§£

[29-May-19 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah, Ive been thinking about that, maybe we can move all the notary managemnt scripts to a "notary" folder and just call the whole thing KMDLAbs

[29-May-19 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Other thing to do is just leave it as is, fork StakedNotary, and start rewriting it, eventually making `staked` no longer required.

Inside and outside of KMD.

[29-May-19 09:03 AM] CrisF#3405
@TonyL @Alright is it ok to share the spreadsheets outside?  Or better to hold off until any major bugs worked out?
