[24-Nov-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to notarise CFEKLAMEDUCKS you dont need CFEKING

[24-Nov-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181

tmux allows panes

[24-Nov-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so you can have one ssh session with heaps and heaps of terminals

[24-Nov-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then just attach it

[24-Nov-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on login

[24-Nov-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
saves endless time

[24-Nov-18 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`tmux allows panes`
that much I've know for years, this still doesn't make me know how to use it 😛

[24-Nov-18 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
