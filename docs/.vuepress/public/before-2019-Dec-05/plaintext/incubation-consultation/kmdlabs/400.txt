getting settled and I'll be throwing up a dilithium side chain

[25-May-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll be merging a heap of verus code üòÑ and making new CCs üòÑ

[25-May-19 11:22 AM] phm87#7395
I won t lie : I am running an iguana with these things since one week (since I misunderstood the lottery). I can share my IP if you encounter pbs

[25-May-19 11:22 AM] Alright#0419
wen lotto

[25-May-19 11:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
will we have a standard chain for each CC?

[25-May-19 11:22 AM] CrisF#3405
Finally a nota.  Can't say I know why.

[25-May-19 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I know how to make lotto

[25-May-19 11:22 AM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator you can make a chain with them all if you want üòõ

@CrisF üî•

[25-May-19 11:23 AM] Alright#0419
you'd be responsible for maintaining it though, wouldn't recommend doing a tonne of CCs on a single chain because of hard forks

[25-May-19 11:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I like the idea of an anarchic /sandbox chain just for general mayhem

[25-May-19 11:24 AM] Alright#0419

no value beyond fun and learning, nuke and phoenix as required

[25-May-19 11:30 AM] Mylo#8306
Thanks reading now.  Can give keys no probs to 87 if need be....or set up nota mon

[25-May-19 11:30 AM] Alright#0419
totally up to you man

[25-May-19 11:30 AM] Alright#0419
your key, do what you want with it

[25-May-19 11:37 AM] Mylo#8306
Step 5 & 6 are a little hard to comprehend

[25-May-19 11:37 AM] Mylo#8306
I‚Äôm making a CC.

[25-May-19 11:37 AM] Mylo#8306
I PR to labs repo

[25-May-19 11:38 AM] Mylo#8306
You guys say you‚Äôll notarize it and run on 22 full nodes

[25-May-19 11:39 AM] Mylo#8306
Or am I just saying here‚Äôs my code, it runs on my X number of nodes, I need minsigs number of labnotaries to run it?

[25-May-19 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
basically....

[25-May-19 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
you prove that the CC isn't *entirely* fucked on CFEK chain

[25-May-19 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
you put a "bid" in for ac_notarypay via the voting dapp

[25-May-19 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
so like you might say, "I'll pay 0.1 LABS per notarization. Will you notarize it?"

[25-May-19 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
Notaries signal if they will, once it's clear that enough NNs(7 atm) will, you create the LABS chain with CC enabled

[25-May-19 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
then they can start notarizing

[25-May-19 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
that make sense? really appreciate the feedback

@Alright 
```
  "notarizedtxid_height": "mempool",
  "KMDnotarized_height": 0,
  "notarized_confirms": 0,
```
from getinfo call
are they labs specific?
what do they mean?

[25-May-19 11:53 AM] Alright#0419
that will only populate if you have a KMD node running and synced

[25-May-19 11:53 AM] Alright#0419
it's not LABS specific

[25-May-19 11:53 AM] Alright#0419
it's info about where the latest notarization is on KMD

[25-May-19 11:54 AM] gcharang#6833
will the assetchain daemon read KMD blockchain data to calculate these things?

[25-May-19 11:56 AM] Alright#0419
not entirely sure how it works

[25-May-19 11:56 AM] Alright#0419
rpc probably

[25-May-19 11:56 AM] gcharang#6833
@Alright 
another question: for an assetchain that is not notarized, 
```
"notarized": 0,
```
from getinfo call
it always stays at zero correct?

[25-May-19 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
yes

can you set some electrums for LABS?

[25-May-19 01:52 PM] jorian#4555
maybe ask @cipi too?

[25-May-19 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
for what mm2?

[25-May-19 01:53 PM] jorian#4555
yes, and probably agama too

[25-May-19 01:53 PM] jorian#4555
we can add it to Chainswap

[25-May-19 01:54 PM] Alright#0419
well I'll be working on the Agama integration soon, will figure out how to run an SPV server as well

[25-May-19 01:54 PM] Alright#0419
@cipi if you have the resources/time to do it, would be much appreciated, but I'll try to maintain one myself as well as redundancy

[25-May-19 01:54 PM] Alright#0419

pool update:
I've almost got a working solution that incorporates all cb types
Yes, I know that disablecb works awesome and I appreciate @blackjok3r for having done that in the 1st place
No, I will not be using it. With the current projects that I'm working on, it's just a better idea to properly utilize getblocktemplate and decoderawtransaction than the current getsubsidy model that I've never liked. The secondary reason is that I'm already chopping the code in order to bring sha256 back as an option (and, by extention, other algos).
The beta should be fully running in 12-36 hrs

@Alright please tell me the komodod parameters for LABS
if i run LABS on the main electrums, there is no need for additional servers, we then have 9 of them

[25-May-19 04:16 PM] cipi#4502
do you know the rpcport for LABS?

[25-May-19 04:17 PM] gcharang#6833
you would need labs komodod I think
"rpcport": 40265

[25-May-19 04:17 PM] cipi#4502
thanks

[25-May-19 04:17 PM] cipi#4502
labs komodod? does not work with beta branch of komodod?

[25-May-19 04:19 PM] gcharang#6833
I don't think so, there are some new consensus changes in labs
https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo
even if it will work with jl777/komodo, the changes might be in jl777 branch or FSM, @blackjok3r will know for sure

makes it more complicated, need to have 2 different daemons on the same server, but ok... when will this be merged to the main repo?

[25-May-19 04:21 PM] gcharang#6833
I don't know, blackjok3r and alright will know

[25-May-19 04:21 PM] gcharang#6833
@Alright ^

[25-May-19 04:24 PM] cipi#4502
ok, will simply name the binary `komodod.labs` for now

[25-May-19 04:24 PM] daemonfox#6136

I believe the plan is to merge everything up to beta/master by the end of the month

[25-May-19 04:26 PM] Alright#0419
the LABS stuff is in jl's FSM branch as of right now, but it requires a PR. Need to wait for joker to take a look at there is something in it I don't quite understand

[25-May-19 04:27 PM] Alright#0419
I'll let you know when it's in beta

[25-May-19 04:28 PM] cipi#4502
no problem, i am about to compile from https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo and simply move the binary to `/usr/local/bin/komodod.labs`

Need to talk to ca about Agama integration, not sure what branch they base it on. Probably can't get an Agama build(the only thing we'd really be using SPV for) until at least the end of the month

[25-May-19 04:29 PM] Alright#0419
so SPV server would likely go entirely unused until then

Question for you... i wasnt moving coins from STAKED after the first test... are there still coins in my addresses in LABS or are those coins gone?

[25-May-19 04:33 PM] Alright#0419
if they were on STAKED(1) and didn't move since, they're on LABS
