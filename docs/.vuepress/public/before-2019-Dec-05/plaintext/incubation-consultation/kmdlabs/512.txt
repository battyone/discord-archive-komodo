`i need to stake with native?`
yes, always; for all coins

[07-Nov-19 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wouldnt bootstrap it tbh... It doesnt take long to sync, if the sync is indeed broken, I will push a fix for it soon.

[07-Nov-19 01:59 PM] AkiraX#8269
Thanks all

[07-Nov-19 02:08 PM] Alright#0419
you cannot use Agama as is, will need to replace the komodod binary with the ones in the pinned messages here @AkiraX

[07-Nov-19 02:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
^ confirmed works though

[07-Nov-19 02:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
you would be better off staking in the CLI

[07-Nov-19 02:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ive been working on adding to those scripts one of the DP users made for staking... basic bat cmdlet

`you would be better off staking in the CLI`
If you're comparing to Agama, beyond setup and maintenance (both of which require external scripts that could still be used), it's the exact same thing

[07-Nov-19 04:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
Except, when you are a multi KMD asset staker in AGAMA, and stake and mine VRSC in AGAMA. The AGAMA UI wont spawn a second instance and you cant replace the needed files while other assets are live, nor launch those assets while LABS files are in place because that was advised against... staking or mining other coins on the LABS binaries.

[07-Nov-19 04:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
This for now lets me do all of that but leave LABS in a non AGAMA UI

[07-Nov-19 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I'm by no means in favor of Agama (for 100 different reasons), was just pointing out that it is running the daemon and using cli üòõ

[07-Nov-19 04:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
Yup! no difference there!

Verus has separate in Agama binaries

[07-Nov-19 04:37 PM] Alright#0419
they include their own binary for VRSC and a binary from komodoplatform repo for asset chains

[07-Nov-19 04:38 PM] Alright#0419
need to replace the komodo binary and it'll be fine, shouldn't mess with VRSC at all

"infinitely scalable" is a bit exaggerating though imo

[07-Nov-19 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
not really, for the right price NNs can just keep adding more servers

[07-Nov-19 05:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
Diminishing returns

[07-Nov-19 05:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
Net bandwidth load is a finite function of available resources, which are themselves finite

[07-Nov-19 05:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
The terminology should be more in line with Enterprise level scalability

[07-Nov-19 05:08 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`finite function of available resources` true, there are only about 300 million unused server boards still in existence

`testsyncfix` branch has a staking optimization in it if anyone wants to test

[07-Nov-19 07:36 PM] Alright#0419
does seem to help quite a bit, will go into master soon enough

[07-Nov-19 07:36 PM] Alright#0419

[07-Nov-19 07:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its not working quite right still trying to get build relliable..

[07-Nov-19 07:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
can confirm that I am staking a LOT more blocks on very old CPU thatn before though

[07-Nov-19 07:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It will help mostly with old/slow hardware

[07-Nov-19 07:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is also a massive fix for sync times.

[07-Nov-19 07:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you reindex, or resync, it will actiuvat.e... if you dont it will stay on the old method

[07-Nov-19 07:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ALL of the RPCs @phm87  and dwy asked me to make are also merged. I assume they all work... but edont have time to test them all myself

[07-Nov-19 07:41 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you for the rpc. I received emails. I tested the rpc related to walletfilter from your fsm branch and it worked

[07-Nov-19 07:41 PM] phm87#7395
Which rpc calls did Dwy asked ?

[07-Nov-19 07:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I found a bug with the `txnotify` thread also... but not sure my fix is safe yet

[07-Nov-19 07:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There are wallet filter things, I think it was dwy who wanted that

[07-Nov-19 07:42 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you to have merged my PR about help of rpc

[07-Nov-19 07:42 PM] phm87#7395
Ok. Goodgood

[07-Nov-19 07:42 PM] Alright#0419
just to be clear, staking optimization doesn't require reindex/resync, yes?

[07-Nov-19 07:42 PM] Alright#0419
only timestamp fix?

[07-Nov-19 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
could I have a list of new rpcs please

[07-Nov-19 07:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
np. it had a small error, you need 2 strings. like so:
`+ HelpExampleCli("getwalletfilterstatus","")`

few mins

[07-Nov-19 07:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the staking CPU fix, works without reindex... the blockindex optimization only helps initial sync, so only activates when you sync block 1

[07-Nov-19 07:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I needed that for the new staker anyway...

[07-Nov-19 07:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not consensus... so can emrge it all after fork, after tested on LABS

[07-Nov-19 07:47 PM] Alright#0419
hint: if you're brave enough to test it, staking optimization will be well worth it üòâ

[07-Nov-19 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
more people using it, less increased staking performance, so probably want to be one of the first

[07-Nov-19 07:50 PM] CHMEX#0686
which branch? testsyncfix ?

[07-Nov-19 07:50 PM] phm87#7395

[07-Nov-19 07:53 PM] phm87#7395
@blackjok3r about your ü§î I mean, can we test it on LABS, LUMBER or any smartchain with some pos ? Or is it mandatory to test on the special testchain of Alright (I forgot its ac_name) ?

[07-Nov-19 07:54 PM] Alright#0419
works with any pos64 chain
