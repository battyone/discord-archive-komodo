it should be yes. Im not sure we will get a definative answer on labs but if a few of us use this version, we will at least know if it creates more bugs/problems.

[07-Mar-19 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then I can test it on a-team in a few days

[07-Mar-19 11:53 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, I'm on 1.2% om mem in iguana before update.  Will update now.

[07-Mar-19 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it usually takes many days to start using stupid amounts of ram...

[07-Mar-19 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this will be easier to test on mainnet, but I need to make sure its not going to crash it or something first

`Is looking at the mem usage in htop enough?`
yes, but like joker pointed out, only if you look at it the right way
I tend to drop caches right after load up and then look at each process individually as time progresses

[07-Mar-19 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is why I asked you to test it, even I am not suite sure what to look for lol. All I know is on main net the problem is sucking up over a GB of ram each day and after a certain time, the array of dpows fills and that coin will stop notarizing.

[07-Mar-19 11:59 AM] CrisF#3405
How do you track that, @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ?

[07-Mar-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
forcing an iguana restart, wich then fuxks your connectivity and sends you back half way down the chart for a day or 2.

with copious amounts of RAM it seems to be less of an issue
the creep that I had on local server wasn't ever much more than KMD chain was last year; however, on the 4GB set up, it would eventually eat up all ram __and__ swap

I have a physical screen dedicated to it about 90% of the time and my south wall is loaded with sticky notes 😛

we are only guessing what the problem may be... this may not do anything, but it shouldnt hurt it at least. The thing that frees the mem up after a round, only did so when state was set to 0xffffffff which is when it actualy finishes, if the function did a return because of an error, that round would not be released, so I added a finished flag, which is set before every return, and chaged it to free when finished is set.

[07-Mar-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
also there was a chance that a round could cancel due to a new round starting, and that would leave the utxo on KMD locked forever until a restart of iguana.

[07-Mar-19 12:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
async programs suck when it comes to finding leaks and the more code the worse it gets  to find 😛

[07-Mar-19 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so I used a goto,... I hope that was safe, ive tried ot use them before in C programs and it usually results in crashing something.

lol

[07-Mar-19 12:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because of KMD chain, I think we need to encourage 6GB as a RAM floor minimum after launch

[07-Mar-19 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
4 "works", but I think it'll need upgrade too quickly with any real adoption

[07-Mar-19 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have said 8GB from the start, but some ppl used 4gb and it "worked"... for testnet it doesnt seem important to waste money if cheaper does actually work.

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[07-Mar-19 12:49 PM] Mylo#8306
4GB will be enough for anyone

[07-Mar-19 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
4G with 1G swap is barely enough for what a NN needs *now* @Mylo

[07-Mar-19 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
much less after adding chains and larger clusters

[07-Mar-19 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm either -5  KMD height doesn't work or we dont have all nodes on the latest yet.
@LabsAssistant  
Please update if  you have an update avalible. I will restest migrate tomorrow.

[07-Mar-19 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Is there a method to complete a migrate if you halted a loop days ago and have no info? 😜

[07-Mar-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no not really... all you need is to save export trasnaction hex and payouts and you can restart the process, but we never automated that

[07-Mar-19 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did a mirgate LABSTH->LABSTH0 easriler and it couldnt finish.. but just did another and it worked... so really we need all noaties on latest to know 100% if using -5 KMD height works or not. I dont see any issue with it, but maybe it throws some alingment off that I dont understand.

[07-Mar-19 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, in my case it was a "I don't care, it's just a test chain", but I'm thinking forward to someone mid transfer having a catastrophic failure

[07-Mar-19 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there were new RPC calls being made to simplify the process

[07-Mar-19 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so work on the migrate scripts isnt a priority

[07-Mar-19 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[07-Mar-19 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i mean to dev rpc calls, you dont need migraate to work 100% of the time, but any other time... you kind of do, so getting ti to work reliably is the number 1 thing... I know it was working very well, without the -5 KMD height thing.... all thats doing is making sure a temporary reorg on KMD wont affect the process... as iguana is using the very tip of KMD height, and if the order notarizations changes due to a reorg, the MoMoM hash calcualted could be diffrent, when you call it during the import process.

[07-Mar-19 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
meaning that import will fail, because the specific hash its looking for is missing.

[07-Mar-19 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but if some ndoes are using it and other are not, all kinds of undefined things happen

[07-Mar-19 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I didn't do many, but the ones I did do all worked except the one I Ctrl+C too soon

[07-Mar-19 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes its about 99% reliable most of the time... We saw a huge failuire when KMD went 29mins without a block... but I fixed that bug.

[07-Mar-19 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know exactly how to make it not run into that bug, but its only covering it up, you just make it wait liek 10 KMD blocks between notarizations on all chains in the cluster.

_is slowly creeping back up to 5th place on LABSTH, but still pretty much last on LABSTH0_

[07-Mar-19 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think chains with very low amounts of block producers will have issues with the latest code in that regard. seems Alright never made a working PoS attack, I think it miight be time to disable that test.

[07-Mar-19 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
limits how many blocks in a row, a single ndoe can send you, so that you are forced to receive blocks from other nodes, but it slows down block propagation if the chain has like 2 or 3 miners.

[07-Mar-19 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I saw that warning, but didn't realize it had a physical halt 😕

[07-Mar-19 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol good thing for me I wasn't using that build for RKT testing 😛

[07-Mar-19 02:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it jsut ignores the next 5 blocks it sends you and requests them from another peer

[07-Mar-19 02:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not good when the chain is only 2 peers :troll:

[07-Mar-19 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think under the attack it would actually work quite well, but it could do bad things.. I think if someone hit a chain with large hash, and made heaps of blocks in a few seconds.... it would simply fork the network

[07-Mar-19 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sounds goodish, in theory, but not sure how well the practice works on a minable chain when a "main pool" has a good luck day

[07-Mar-19 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
kinda punishing them for doing what they do

[07-Mar-19 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well if the block times are normal ... I dont think that would ahve too much of an issue

[07-Mar-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as there are plenty of nodes...

[07-Mar-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but if that one node was connected to all other nodes.... then taht would be very bad.

[07-Mar-19 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as for 5 blocks none of the blocks it mines are propagated until nodes request them

[07-Mar-19 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for staking chains with lots of stakers... its a perfect solution I think... but only if it was 100% PoS

[07-Mar-19 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
stakers could/should be less effected because of less broadcast

[07-Mar-19 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
until staking pool 😛

[07-Mar-19 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, unless they were doing that fake headers attack .... then they would jsut get temp banned and force the node being pushed the fake chain top look at another chain, and thus invaldiate their attack

[08-Mar-19 06:14 AM] Mylo#8306
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 oh for notary - apologies...my big nose wasn't in the discussion for long enough - that voice from the deep, or that nosey neighbour on some tv show of the 90s..., yeah not sure 4GB will be enough.  for running chains 4GB is plenty.   also re: swap - i think from years ago it was good to match your swap with your RAM, so 4G/4G or 1:2 ratio when RAM was less abundant.

[08-Mar-19 06:14 AM] Mylo#8306
8GB prob for notaries required.  i'll up my machine on next reboot

[08-Mar-19 06:15 AM] Mylo#8306
if i'm still in notary file 😬

[08-Mar-19 06:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont hink you are in the cirrent era, but I might change it over the weekend and change port again, so I know 100% if nodes are all on the same iguana... Cant test migrates at all until everyone is updates using -5 KMD height. theoretically I dont see any issue with using -5 height, but I need to test it.

[08-Mar-19 08:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm getting this error from a local CFEKORKL node using jl777/FSM branch - `2019-03-08 08:31:07 socket recv error Connection reset by peer (104)`
got `connect=` linking it to one of my VPS. Seemed to be working for a while last night.... something in labs version of deamon blocking?

[08-Mar-19 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe, they are not exactly the same at this point in time

[08-Mar-19 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What I need is a list of veryone who is on latest.... So I can continue my testing. Until this time I cant really do anything and am stuck.

Hi @blackjok3r @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ,  FYI, iguana mem usage is up a  lot according to htop.
Before yesterday update: 1.2% mem usage
After update (+25.5hrs): 5.4% mem usage
Sysetm: 15.7G memory

[08-Mar-19 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mine's actually running higher than that, just a tad under 1G

[08-Mar-19 01:27 PM] CrisF#3405
Quite a lot of cpu load also.  Haven't been looking recently, but much more that I remember from before.

[08-Mar-19 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
CPU usage for mine is fairly nominal with 4 cores

[08-Mar-19 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
2-7% of 1 core is about the max when it's "doing something"

[08-Mar-19 01:35 PM] CrisF#3405
hmm, I'll have to see what's going on here.  Seems the tmux.conf is using a lot of cpu...

Thanks 😃 
I'll try and code in notary pay to take that out of the equation this weekend, so it'll be migrations only.
a bit more effort needed cos has to check against block height for what is in effect
