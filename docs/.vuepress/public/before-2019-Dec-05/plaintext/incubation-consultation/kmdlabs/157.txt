Also most of my utxos are int he same segid

[12-Dec-18 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I never distributed them

[12-Dec-18 01:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it mines to -pubkey (not thaat that matters on anything but CFEK)

[12-Dec-18 01:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
limiting to 1 address, the 1% chains are sitting on about 20%.

[12-Dec-18 01:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe I should distribute them

[12-Dec-18 01:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and see if it goes to 100%

[12-Dec-18 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean we dont really have a choice to change this much at this point... we just use it and if its no good... we will need to hard fork away to something else 游땭

` we just use it and if its no good... we will need to hard fork away to something else`
Well, that's why I brought up my observations now, especially since everything I did "way back" was kinda skewed by all being GPU

[12-Dec-18 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well the main chain will be ASIC mined ... at least for a while ... so it should be ok.

[12-Dec-18 01:04 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`well the main chain will be ASIC mined`
If it has value, that's pretty much a given :trollface:

[12-Dec-18 01:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It doesnt really matter if the PoS % slowly goes up over time, due to less hash rate as anyone cna just poitn hash at it to mine a bunc of coins to stake lol

[12-Dec-18 01:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the chain cannot stall as long as it gets staked.

[12-Dec-18 01:06 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I should have my staker rigs up and running by friday 游땎

[12-Dec-18 01:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
still never got to mine lol

[12-Dec-18 01:07 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
the 6700 is finally in a box, I just need to archive the win stuff and do a reinstall and looks like friday when I'll get to the 8700

[12-Dec-18 01:07 AM] Alright#0419
Can one of you explain your logic behind combining utxos for a staker

[12-Dec-18 01:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Been playing around with Hypervisors and GPU pass thrugh on my PC to try and set something up there... not having a lot of fun... Vega64 video cards have a bios bug, tha requires hard reset of host to reboot VM

[12-Dec-18 01:07 AM] Alright#0419
so far I have this working

[12-Dec-18 01:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont combine

[12-Dec-18 01:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine was only trying to make as many as possible

[12-Dec-18 01:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but once a chain gets over a certain size .. thats a bad plan

[12-Dec-18 01:07 AM] Alright#0419
check to see if we mined latest block
combine coinbase of that block + coins that staked it to segid that staked it

[12-Dec-18 01:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as thew wallet breaks

[12-Dec-18 01:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats how webworkers worked

[12-Dec-18 01:08 AM] Alright#0419
but that's limiting in that it won't create new utxos

[12-Dec-18 01:08 AM] Alright#0419
yes it's based on web's bash scripts

[12-Dec-18 01:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
his is the simplest implementation and will hold a steady amount of utxo

[12-Dec-18 01:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine will be crazy.. but I will way for yours first

[12-Dec-18 01:09 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@Alright My combine is only for redistribute purposes 
for splitting I just pull a number out of my ass and do `UTXOoffset=$(echo "scale=4; (($Bal - 0.001) ) / $UTXOsper" | bc);`

[12-Dec-18 01:09 AM] Alright#0419
so just start with say 20 in each segid and keep it at 20/segid?

[12-Dec-18 01:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and build it on that ... I can even read m bash staker any more it ahs 0 comemtns

[12-Dec-18 01:09 AM] Alright#0419
yea my brain doesn't work in bash anymore

[12-Dec-18 01:09 AM] Alright#0419
had a really hard time deciphering his bash scripts

[12-Dec-18 01:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I found districuting random sizes works very well... but over time, the smaller utxos stop staking and you need to combine tham eith larger ones.

[12-Dec-18 01:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the over all strategy for this I imagein will be actualyl quite compelx... maybe 2-3x more steps than my first attempt

[12-Dec-18 01:11 AM] Alright#0419
I don't care about strategy, plan is to make these the reference staking scripts for noobs

[12-Dec-18 01:11 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`yea my brain doesn't work in bash anymore`
I evenly distribute
(balance/64) - txfee

[12-Dec-18 01:11 AM] Alright#0419
so reliability > efficiency

[12-Dec-18 01:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... not having to play with it every single day to keep it running will win out

[12-Dec-18 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[12-Dec-18 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats using marketmaker

[12-Dec-18 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but if thats right

[12-Dec-18 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there are iterative loops to generate random distribution there

[12-Dec-18 01:12 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_hasn't ran mm since POSTESTB_

[12-Dec-18 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i think mine will use something like that

[12-Dec-18 01:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
was too hard to re do it without mm so I used it on every initial distribution

[12-Dec-18 01:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then the bash scripts took over

[12-Dec-18 01:13 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
that's why I just did even distribute

[12-Dec-18 01:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but with the komodod py lib now... it should be mighty easy

[12-Dec-18 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
isn't really a "library"

[12-Dec-18 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
just a module with a dick load of functions

[12-Dec-18 01:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
really looking forward to learning more about it.

[12-Dec-18 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
@Deleted User will teach you it :trollface:

[12-Dec-18 01:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems like cna make some sweet things... combined with some simple custom RPCs

[12-Dec-18 01:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the actual code part isnt that hard.... just not 100$% sure on how it all goes together

[12-Dec-18 01:15 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`just a module with a dick load of functions`
That's kinda the definition of a library 游땟

[12-Dec-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once I have some exampel scripts to work from i'll be fine ... same as any other language ive messed with.

[12-Dec-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
work out what somehting is doing... then tak it apart and mix it with somethign else until it works by trial and error 游땥

[12-Dec-18 01:16 AM] Alright#0419
trollbox has good simple examples

游녨 

[12-Dec-18 01:16 AM] Alright#0419
maybe not the best format

[12-Dec-18 01:16 AM] Alright#0419
like everything should be function-ized

[12-Dec-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Wasnt sure where everything was kept yesterday so just focused on other things

[12-Dec-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now I need to fix my computer again lol...

[12-Dec-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I made another dual boot win10 booted it once ... then thaught fuck this, im making a pass thru VM this is too annoying ... then lost half a day getting it to boot.

[12-Dec-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
still cant use it for anything

[12-Dec-18 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
starting to think about just using vmware exsi like on notary node 游뱎

[12-Dec-18 01:19 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`made another dual boot win10`
why? 游뱑游낗

[12-Dec-18 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because some things refuse to work in linux nativly under wine very well

[12-Dec-18 01:20 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`because some things refuse to work in linux nativly under wine very well`
So you pick the only OS that M$ft created that's worse than win98v1?

[12-Dec-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least at this point in time ... if I just had a 1080ti to use as my win10 VM GPU everything be fine ...vega on host, 1080 on VM ... atm usign a 280x and vega and its buggy as fuck.

[12-Dec-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hardware support for win7 isnt there

[12-Dec-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sadly

[12-Dec-18 01:22 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
if your GPU can't run on the most stable thing Ms ever made, it's time for a new GPU :trollface:

[12-Dec-18 01:24 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
if you didn't live on some random island in the middle of the feken ocean, I'd bring you a real GPU

[12-Dec-18 01:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its more the VM shit you nede win10 for ... having to dual boot is just fucked... I have everything running off this one PC .. media servers and work VMs amoungother thigns...

[12-Dec-18 01:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to get the VM's working properly ...

[12-Dec-18 01:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
getting close .. but having to use too many diffrent softwares is starting to get anoying.. Need to think about hwo to best go about it.

[12-Dec-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no point building a compter like this if not going to use it for anything... cna ewasily play games and run a heap of full nodes in VMs etc at the same time

[12-Dec-18 01:34 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I've chopped everything down to debian 9.6 host and 1 win7 vm

[12-Dec-18 01:39 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 what are you mining with GPUs lately

[12-Dec-18 01:40 AM] Alright#0419
haven't bothered to turn mine on for anything but testing in probably 2 months

[12-Dec-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So send me a freeking 1080ti :trollface:

[12-Dec-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or 2... my mate needs one ...

[12-Dec-18 01:44 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I, literally, haven't mined anything personally in over a month that wasn't CPU or just a test

[12-Dec-18 01:44 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
at all

[12-Dec-18 01:45 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
when I took the network down to do the VLANs, I never turned the miner room back on

[12-Dec-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah ive been robbing parts from mine last few days too ... shame 游땭

[12-Dec-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no idea what to do with it all

[12-Dec-18 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 you have any broken GPUs I could have?

[12-Dec-18 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
just pulled my BGA rework station out of storage, looking for stuff to play with

[12-Dec-18 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a bunch of them lol ...

[12-Dec-18 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181

what sort of cpu mining you doing

[12-Dec-18 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was minig verus, but stopped a while ago now.

[12-Dec-18 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not mining anything but KMD and ZEX (I have a ZEX pool, no hash pointed at it personally)

[12-Dec-18 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
POS64 will take a couple thousand blocks to stabilize diff at first

[12-Dec-18 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
it has no idea how much stake or hashrate is active and it needs to work for all combinations
