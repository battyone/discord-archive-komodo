i want one

[27-Nov-18 02:58 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
fiber?

[27-Nov-18 02:59 AM] Alright#0419
I have 89 LAMEDUCKS notarizations if that gives you some perspective

[27-Nov-18 02:59 AM] Alright#0419
and I know how it works and how to optimize it

[27-Nov-18 02:59 AM] Alright#0419
it's ping

[27-Nov-18 02:59 AM] Alright#0419
ping or hax

[27-Nov-18 02:59 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
and I was dead for 12 hours because of UTXO dumbness / gen=1

[27-Nov-18 02:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im on 1Gbit fiber in the most isolated city in the world, with a direct undersea cable to Singapore ... and it fucking sucks for notarisations .. I really want to chuck my nodes on some modern CPUs though and see how they go.

[27-Nov-18 03:00 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
so upgrading my i3 to a monster isnt going to do much

[27-Nov-18 03:00 AM] Alright#0419
nope

[27-Nov-18 03:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my guess is it will make 0 diffrence ... as from 0.005s to 0.025s in CPU response has nothign pon 50ms-400ms  of pping

[27-Nov-18 03:01 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
you just saved me a day

[27-Nov-18 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`time komodo-cli listunspent > /dev/null`

[27-Nov-18 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you nede to make that as fast as possible, after network ping thats the slowest part of the process.

[27-Nov-18 03:02 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
@SHossain  needs to spread his wealth

[27-Nov-18 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
meh ...

[27-Nov-18 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if everyone spent that much it wouldnt help the network work better

[27-Nov-18 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it would just take his advantage

[27-Nov-18 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its pointelss waste of money

[27-Nov-18 03:03 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
time komodo-cli listunspent > /dev/null

[27-Nov-18 03:03 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
explain that in fewest words possible

[27-Nov-18 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just do the command

[27-Nov-18 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and see what time it returns

[27-Nov-18 03:03 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
./

[27-Nov-18 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then you can do `komodo-cli cleanwallettransactions`

[27-Nov-18 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and do it again

[27-Nov-18 03:03 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
from where

[27-Nov-18 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to see how much faster it is

[27-Nov-18 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your node

[27-Nov-18 03:04 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
real    0m0.015s
user    0m0.005s
sys    0m0.000s

[27-Nov-18 03:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
0.015 is good

[27-Nov-18 03:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
0.060 is bad

[27-Nov-18 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
0.1

[27-Nov-18 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is very bad, and liekly at that, your node wouldnt work at all

[27-Nov-18 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but that takes a wallet.dat of pretty alrge size like 100MB... LABs notary would take months to get that big I think

[27-Nov-18 03:05 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
real    0m0.013s
user    0m0.006s
sys    0m0.000s
kmdkrazy@kmdkrazy-

[27-Nov-18 03:06 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
im cruizing now

[27-Nov-18 03:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
didnt amke much diffrence ... the faster system you have the less diff a clean walelt amkes, up to a point

[27-Nov-18 03:06 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
how fast is Sho?

[27-Nov-18 03:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think its exactly CPU speed either

[27-Nov-18 03:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a strong theory its RAM bandwidth that makes the diffrence

[27-Nov-18 03:07 AM] Alright#0419
CPU speed has nothing to do with it from my observations

[27-Nov-18 03:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tested it on my ryzen at variying DDR clocks, and at 3.2GHz DDR4 it was almost non exisant time for listunspent return.

[27-Nov-18 03:07 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i just want to copy Shos setup

[27-Nov-18 03:07 AM] Alright#0419
obviously a garbage CPU will not do well, but a shit VPS does fine

[27-Nov-18 03:07 AM] Alright#0419
so I can't see CPU being much of a factor

[27-Nov-18 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If I wasnt located where I am, I would run the notary node from here on my ryzen, but adding another 16ms if ping, to gain 10ms in listunspent return speed, doesnt seem like ti would work.

[27-Nov-18 03:09 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
so ping time to where ? where or what am I pinging?

[27-Nov-18 03:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its ONLY about getting into recvmask as fast as possible, ther only 2 things that determine that are:
1) ping to all other nodes, lower ping to higher % of nodes does better
2) listunspent call time

[27-Nov-18 03:10 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
wow - so i have to be in the center of the earth

[27-Nov-18 03:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on LABS the listunspent call is really a non factor, as we have a special wallet, that optimizes it out of the box to go as fast as possible... at least sftware wise it cant really be increased ... so the only other thign to do is get the IPs of all notaries from iguana (there is a RPC for this) then ping them all and see how fast it is

[27-Nov-18 03:10 AM] Alright#0419
The problem with current iguana is that *everyone* will want to be in the same DC as SHo's LABS notary

[27-Nov-18 03:10 AM] Alright#0419
so ping difference needs to be nerfed

[27-Nov-18 03:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rent various VPS and do the ping test to get one with the highest numbers, this works until everyone starts doign it and they all start moving around.

[27-Nov-18 03:11 AM] Alright#0419
even if it means slower notarizations IMO

[27-Nov-18 03:11 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
got it

[27-Nov-18 03:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notarisatios still need the block to be confirmed .. .so slowing them down a little bit si a non issue

[27-Nov-18 03:11 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i will try to have my son look at this --   he might get interested in the competition factor

[27-Nov-18 03:12 AM] Alright#0419
game theory is a bitch

[27-Nov-18 03:12 AM] Alright#0419
ü§£

[27-Nov-18 03:12 AM] Alright#0419
please get him interested though

[27-Nov-18 03:12 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
have several nodes all around the world ping fighting

[27-Nov-18 03:12 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
but cant IP spoof

[27-Nov-18 03:12 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
theres the problem

[27-Nov-18 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
TBH I just am going to push for a fe long term elected spots, like what KMD has with the dev nodes, but these are elected positions... rather than some automatic inclusion. Then üôè  people elect me.

[27-Nov-18 03:13 AM] Alright#0419
figure out how to nerf ping advantage and there is no need for regions or elections

[27-Nov-18 03:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a really really ahrd thing to solve

[27-Nov-18 03:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like almsot impossibly hard .

[27-Nov-18 03:15 AM] Alright#0419
I realize that üò∞

[27-Nov-18 03:15 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
you could pay a average to all notas

[27-Nov-18 03:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because any change you make to do it ... must be a consensus thing, other wise nodes cna just change the code to give them an advantage again

[27-Nov-18 03:15 AM] Alright#0419
obfuscate it for now :trollface:

[27-Nov-18 03:16 AM] Alright#0419
and work on real math-based solution in mean time

[27-Nov-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh I don thtink its somehting in my skill set, but I know just about enough of how the iguana works to help someone who does have the correct skills make it ...

[27-Nov-18 03:17 AM] Alright#0419
maybe iguana isn't the best solution then

[27-Nov-18 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana has just about 0 bugs as far as notarisations go ...

[27-Nov-18 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it has this hige issue

[27-Nov-18 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
üò¶

[27-Nov-18 03:18 AM] Alright#0419
We understand the concept. If the software implementing the concept is limiting. Remake the software

[27-Nov-18 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I was going to see if libscotts notariser would help this, but dunno what happened to it

[27-Nov-18 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we started testing it to notarise ETH to KMD... then nothign happened .. for long long time now

[27-Nov-18 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats diffrent because it doesnt send both the txs at the same time .

[27-Nov-18 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it acutally waits for the notarisaion to KMD before sending the back notarisaion to the chain.

[27-Nov-18 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it might not have this stupid ping advantage

[27-Nov-18 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
ping advantage can still exist

[27-Nov-18 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
just not to the extent to what it is now

[27-Nov-18 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also they can never confirm out of order then either ... so the sledgehammer approach to MoMOM scannign doenst need to happen/

[27-Nov-18 03:21 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill stop stressing about SHos  ping advantage - and my son can keep using my monster for vidoe games

[27-Nov-18 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if there is one single node that somehow dominates counts, thats fine, as long as its not a group of whatever min sigs is ...

[27-Nov-18 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as notarisaitons are actually random an upredictable .. its ok ... I think hat increasing min sigs will help a lot btw

[27-Nov-18 03:22 AM] Alright#0419
it depends on how they dominate

[27-Nov-18 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we should try it

[27-Nov-18 03:22 AM] Alright#0419
we should increase min sigs regardless

[27-Nov-18 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just having more nodes needed to sign will help as recvmask will NEED to ait for mode nodes to be included .. goign too high will make notarisaiotn sunrelaiable though, if some nodes go down.

[27-Nov-18 03:23 AM] Alright#0419
We don't have as nearly as large of a network as KMD, so min sigs matter much much more

[27-Nov-18 03:23 AM] Alright#0419
much much much*

[27-Nov-18 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we should try 7 instead of 5 ... but without a stats site deployed its impossible to know what the diffrences are

[27-Nov-18 03:24 AM] Alright#0419
MUCH in our situation

[27-Nov-18 03:24 AM] Alright#0419
the momom situation if you know what I mean

[27-Nov-18 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as far as I know the entire stats site is open source, if @webworker01  could help me, I can set one up for us.
