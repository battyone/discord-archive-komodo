[26-Oct-19 12:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
i helped him all the way to staking and even that didnt seem to be enough to keep him civil

[26-Oct-19 12:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
So I bloccked him outright... looks like he must have lost it after that

[26-Oct-19 01:01 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
Well, he's still mining, so that's good (I guess)

[26-Oct-19 01:12 PM] Oszy#5734
good

`preaching to myself`
At least you know someone will be listening.  Didn't seem kevin was capable of that during the conversation, haha

About to 游눣
Been having problems with `tokencreate` on MYLO6.
```-ac_name=CFEKMYLO6 tokencreate PHMAT1 0.00001 "Testing MYLO6 tokentransfer to confirm PHMAs results, or not."
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "some inputs signed not with -pubkey=pk"
}
```
It is running with pubkey set, and `getinfo` shows the key.
`tokenlist` and `tokeninfo` work.

[26-Oct-19 02:04 PM] CrisF#3405
PHBA2061 also had trouble on MYLO6 with `tokentransfer` and `tokenbalance`.

If anyone has any ideas I'll test them out in the morning.

[26-Oct-19 03:01 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I'll continue the work on MORTY, propably there is some difference between LABS's komodod & the official komodod

`propably there is some difference between LABS's komodod & the official komodod`
That mostly depends on the branch you look at

[26-Oct-19 03:15 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I used the default branch for CFEKMYLO6

[26-Oct-19 03:17 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
yes, iirc, utxocache is a bunch different

[26-Oct-19 05:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
Could use some help with the NNvote.py script... Im trying to get a partners node registered but it keeps failing and kicking me out of the app, but still send the tx...

that needs a format fix

[26-Oct-19 05:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
its a paste issue

[26-Oct-19 05:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
not an input issue

thats the command pasted instead of me copying it from the output screen

at which step do you get this error? 2,3,4?

[26-Oct-19 05:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
3 registering

[26-Oct-19 05:58 PM] Oszy#5734

[26-Oct-19 05:58 PM] Oszy#5734
and you get error at step 4?

[26-Oct-19 05:58 PM] Oszy#5734
or you don't even get the oraclesfunds?

@Oszy  error upon hitting step 3 and pressing enter

[26-Oct-19 06:02 PM] Oszy#5734
that tx id you have doesn't look like when oracle is funding you

[26-Oct-19 06:02 PM] Oszy#5734
you should get 3 tx to the address

[26-Oct-19 06:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
it dumps that error and exots the script

[26-Oct-19 06:02 PM] Oszy#5734
did you change branch? oracle ID correct now?

restarted LABS with cleaned up command from Genie just to be sure

[26-Oct-19 06:03 PM] Oszy#5734
and the address you are trying to register matches the address for the pubkey right?

[26-Oct-19 06:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
Pubkey is confirmed... balance is confirmed in wallet for that address

I'd wait for @Alright or @blackjok3r I can't see where the issue is according this info.

For the sake of being thorough...

[26-Oct-19 06:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
I deleted wallets and other files, and let the start script perform its imports off the config.

[26-Oct-19 06:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
trying again now

[26-Oct-19 06:19 PM] Oszy#5734
right

[26-Oct-19 06:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
failed... but didnt delete conf files...

[26-Oct-19 06:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
so trying all that again with new generated conf files too

[26-Oct-19 06:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
nope

[26-Oct-19 06:34 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@Oszy did you change the startup pubkey to one of your own?

[26-Oct-19 06:36 PM] Oszy#5734
@daemonfox config.ini filled out?

[26-Oct-19 06:36 PM] Oszy#5734
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉  if i recall correctly I did cli setpubkey after generating the address

[26-Oct-19 06:37 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
setpubkey *should't* work if you set pubkey as a startup param

[26-Oct-19 06:38 PM] Oszy#5734
I know, because i didn't 游땏

[26-Oct-19 06:38 PM] Oszy#5734
it tells you it's already set otherwise

[26-Oct-19 06:39 PM] Oszy#5734
I started the chain without pubkey, synced it, new addy, setpubkey, dumpprivkey, put all into config.ini then ran NNVote.py

[26-Oct-19 06:39 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
basically what I am getting at is that if you don't have the priv key for whatever addy corresponds to `02a4d685f668374db9ff7542f4b5611dc886ee536ce573a7ecddd04b22bd494c4e`, then it __should__ moof if you set `02a4d685f668374db9ff7542f4b5611dc886ee536ce573a7ecddd04b22bd494c4e` as pubkey

[26-Oct-19 06:39 PM] Oszy#5734
