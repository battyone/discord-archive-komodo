the way I set it( :troll: ) forced everyone to restart to prevent problems due to that

[30-Oct-19 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if they do happen

[30-Oct-19 09:56 AM] Alright#0419
iguana will still make them though

[30-Oct-19 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so?

[30-Oct-19 09:56 AM] Alright#0419
so it breaks dpow(possibly) until everyone restarts anyway?

[30-Oct-19 09:56 AM] Alright#0419
so I was just going to force everyone to restart

[30-Oct-19 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant do that...

[30-Oct-19 09:56 AM] Alright#0419
ok, no worries

[30-Oct-19 10:32 AM] CHMEX#0686
any idea on this? 
./komodod: error while loading shared libraries: libidn2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

[30-Oct-19 10:32 AM] CHMEX#0686
newst master

[30-Oct-19 10:32 AM] CHMEX#0686
standalone binary

[30-Oct-19 10:32 AM] CHMEX#0686
16.04.6 LTS

[30-Oct-19 10:37 AM] Oszy#5734
libidn missing probably

[30-Oct-19 10:37 AM] Oszy#5734
is it in usr/lib?

[30-Oct-19 10:50 AM] Oszy#5734
if it's standalone and you never compiled on the machine you may have missing deps

[30-Oct-19 10:50 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes strange worked before now I get
./komodod: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.11' not found (required by ./komodod)
./komodod: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.22' not found (required by ./komodod)
./komodod: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.25' not found (required by ./komodod)

[30-Oct-19 10:52 AM] Oszy#5734
just run the install for all the deps like you'd about to compile

[30-Oct-19 10:53 AM] Oszy#5734
`sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq zlib1g-dev wget libcurl4-gnutls-dev bsdmainutils automake curl`

you may leave python, git, and make out

[30-Oct-19 10:53 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes I did that https://github.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary/blob/master/install/buildkomodo.sh#L3

[30-Oct-19 10:54 AM] CHMEX#0686
weird weird

[30-Oct-19 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
does it work for jl777/dev branch

[30-Oct-19 10:54 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes

[30-Oct-19 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The git diff back to that branch doesnt show anything relevent... hmmm

[30-Oct-19 10:58 AM] Oszy#5734
can you fin the file `libstdc++.so` on the drive but different location?

[30-Oct-19 10:58 AM] Oszy#5734
might just be sitting in/usr/lib

[30-Oct-19 11:01 AM] Oszy#5734
on mine it's in `/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7`

[30-Oct-19 11:02 AM] Oszy#5734
maybe if you change lib-path or just copy it to the other folder it would work

[30-Oct-19 11:07 AM] CHMEX#0686
https://github.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary/blob/master/install/installnanomsg.sh#L3

`libc6-dev` ^^

`check that your key is in the same position as before`
Why not just add numbers to the comments every 5 or so spaces, @Alright? Then you will not confuse yourself

[30-Oct-19 11:08 AM] Alright#0419
nou

[30-Oct-19 11:08 AM] Oszy#5734
`sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libc6`

[30-Oct-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
./komodod: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.25' not found (required by ./komodod) - it means that binary was compiled on newer Ubuntu than one on what you’re starting it

[30-Oct-19 11:10 AM] Oszy#5734
damn these old binaries

[30-Oct-19 11:11 AM] Alright#0419
genie, just doing it so people actually check, if we hard fork *then* someone says "there's a mistake" it'll be a headache

[30-Oct-19 11:11 AM] CHMEX#0686
aha thanks Tony!

👍 

[30-Oct-19 11:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I understand that
I'm just saying that you can do both and make it easier on everyone to check, just like:
<https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/blob/master/src/komodo_defs.h#L65>

[30-Oct-19 12:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
anywho....
as long as the old keys aren't moofed, the mining pool should be OK if I update now, no?

[30-Oct-19 12:04 PM] CHMEX#0686
I updated the explorer and that worked

[30-Oct-19 12:04 PM] CHMEX#0686
not that this is the same as a pool but somehow it works

[30-Oct-19 12:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's been a long couple days and I couldn't/can't recall if any consensus code was changed

[30-Oct-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing changes until the timestamp tomorrow...

[30-Oct-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
best to update the daemon now if you can

[30-Oct-19 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
good, because I'm clear headed now and may have to up my meds by tomorrow

shit makes me light-headed and sleepy when I change dosage

[30-Oct-19 12:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
apologies for the delay.. ml777 pubkey is correct

[30-Oct-19 12:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
ml777 is mylo & lynch team, yes, although Mylo seems to be offline for a bit due to health issues

[30-Oct-19 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_hopes mylo has a speedy recovery and is contemplating doing the same_

[30-Oct-19 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mininglabs.rocks will experience a large amount of restarts today as I finalize updates, clean shit up, and add chains

[30-Oct-19 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw: on the pool, aPoW chains will use standard scrape timings and no "fast polling"

[30-Oct-19 02:57 PM] gt#2812
mine is correct

[30-Oct-19 03:40 PM] phm87#7395
I warned zpool about labs HF. Do we have another pool to warn ? (Outside of kmd ecosystem I mean)

[30-Oct-19 03:44 PM] Alright#0419
here if you have a LABS node, you must update it latest master branch before 12:00 UTC tomorrow or you will go onto a fork. Would recommend not using AtomicDex tomorrow. Notaries, you can `./start.sh` now to update komodod, but you'll have to restart iguana after the activation.

Pinned a message.

[30-Oct-19 04:04 PM] PHBA2061#2530
don't forget to modify your `config.ini` file & fund your new address too I suppose

[30-Oct-19 04:10 PM] Oszy#5734
how much do need to fund until the next time?

[30-Oct-19 04:14 PM] CHMEX#0686
5 KMD will do for a looong time

[30-Oct-19 04:15 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yup, each nota tx only takes 0.0001 KMD input from each notary

[30-Oct-19 04:17 PM] PHBA2061#2530
as for the rest (LABS, MYLO, MYLO6), I think blackjok3r will airdrop some them to the new NN

[30-Oct-19 04:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS is earnt with each notarization you make, so you should only need a tiny amount, as for teh CFEK chains, they will be removed soon anyway

[30-Oct-19 04:18 PM] Oszy#5734
I am good on LABS ty, will send 5 KMD then.

[30-Oct-19 04:18 PM] Oszy#5734
will only need mylo funds

[30-Oct-19 04:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
np

[30-Oct-19 04:20 PM] CHMEX#0686
mylo you can mine

[30-Oct-19 04:20 PM] CHMEX#0686
or post the address

[30-Oct-19 04:20 PM] CHMEX#0686
and i send

[30-Oct-19 04:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`as for teh CFEK chains, they will be removed soon anyway`
he says right after I add them to the mining pool 😦

[30-Oct-19 04:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we can keep them I guess

[30-Oct-19 04:29 PM] CHMEX#0686
I really like how it works well
on the current mainnet iguana it would not perform so well

Hi admin, what do i have to with my Labs? I am using wallet Agama VRS. Thanks

[30-Oct-19 04:30 PM] CHMEX#0686
do you want to stake it?

[30-Oct-19 04:31 PM] Alright#0419
@bamby what operating system?

[30-Oct-19 04:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`we can keep them I guess`
I was joking
I needed to add those scripts so that the pool compliments the project anyway
The pool is to serve the project not the other way around 😛

[30-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Alright#0419
You'll be able to just replace the komodod file in the Agama installation, but it depends on which OS. Will have prebuilt binaries shortly after the hard fork. If you're on mac or linux, you can build the binaries yourself now

[30-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Alright#0419
cg so selfless

[30-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Alright#0419
:shexy:

[30-Oct-19 04:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
At a 2% fee, I wouldn't say "selfless" :troll: 
 but "supportive"

[30-Oct-19 04:34 PM] Alright#0419
ya play the tough guy, we all know the truth

[30-Oct-19 04:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_seems to recall someone using a password to tell me what to do with the fee 🤔_

[30-Oct-19 04:42 PM] bamby#5307
@Alright
I use window sys

[30-Oct-19 04:43 PM] Alright#0419
if you are staking, you should stop the node prior to the hard fork. You'll need to wait until there are precompiled binaries or build it yourself on linux

[30-Oct-19 04:44 PM] bamby#5307
@Alright
I dont use linux os

[30-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
will just need to wait for precompiled binaries. After that it's as simple as downloading a file and replacing another with it. Should have them within a couple days. Remember, if you're staking, stop before 12:00 UTC tomorrow or you will have trouble fixing it.

[30-Oct-19 04:54 PM] bamby#5307
@Alright
Thanks

[30-Oct-19 05:06 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
OK - so why would staking over the fork be bad if mining can continue??

[30-Oct-19 05:07 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@Alright

[30-Oct-19 05:08 PM] Oszy#5734
cuz you'll be on a fork and messing up you chain data

[30-Oct-19 05:08 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
A consensus block is a consensus block

[30-Oct-19 05:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because manual invalidation of a forked chain sucks for "normal" users
`A consensus block is a consensus block`
and 2 of them on 2 different forks is still 2 of them

[30-Oct-19 05:09 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
A hard fork has to be minable - the daemon should decide

[30-Oct-19 05:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
**if** the chain forks and both forks get notarized separately it makes shit ugly

[30-Oct-19 05:10 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Staked and mined should be the same rules

[30-Oct-19 05:10 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
They are both mined
