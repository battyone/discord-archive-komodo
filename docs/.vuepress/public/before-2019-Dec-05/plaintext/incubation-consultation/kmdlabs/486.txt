I think we have forks... @webworker01  @CMaurice  @Bar_F1sh_Rel  
Are all submitting utxos that are simply not in any chain... Im totally lost on this one, can I get remote access to one of these nodes to check please?

[18-Oct-19 06:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Things still work perfectly under these conditions, but the nodes submitting utxos that do not exist cannot notarize and as such are screwing up my data collection. If we dont fix this, I will need to deploy an entire network again to test this myself.

[18-Oct-19 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess I will need to do that anyway at some point, but I would really like to know why this is happening... I'm pretty sure this is not a bug in my code at this point, i've tried various things and nothing is fixing it... Only explination is that these nodes are being malicious or they have forked.

[18-Oct-19 06:09 AM] webworker01#3884
i just stop and start as you requested

[18-Oct-19 06:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once sec, I'll post block hash of the chain that is broken for you to check.

[18-Oct-19 06:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its totally possible things have forked... there were fixes to KMD code base we may not have yet, or some of us got and others did not...

[18-Oct-19 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wtf lol... ok... ummm is there any chance I can access that node?

[18-Oct-19 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
somehting is very wrong here

[18-Oct-19 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
almost impossible tbh

[18-Oct-19 06:13 AM] webworker01#3884
there's some other stuff on here i'd prefer not but can try to get you whatever info you want

[18-Oct-19 06:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm maybe one of the other 2, will be able to help. Have to pick up my kid from school in 45mins... Wil have a think about this and see if I can work it out... My node has never submit spent/non existant utxos, so i cant really debug this.

[18-Oct-19 06:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need one of the nodes in broken state.

[18-Oct-19 06:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess next move is to make my own network so I can remove possibility of human error... but this doesnt seem possible to be human error.

[18-Oct-19 06:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just dont understand how it can do listunspent and get a txid that does not exist ü§∑

[18-Oct-19 06:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And it cannot be a race condition.... because its the same nodes doing the exact same thing every time. Same txid.

[18-Oct-19 06:16 AM] webworker01#3884
debug.log for cfekmylo looks normal, just receiving new blocks

[18-Oct-19 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also the new daemon code, is doing gettxout check on each utxo it chooses until it gets one that passes

[18-Oct-19 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So if the getrawtransaction is returning invalid txid, then every utxo it chooses would fail that check and no utxo would be submit..

[18-Oct-19 06:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean its only hurting your nodes... everyone else just ignores you././. but if its a genuine bug... Then i need to fix it.

I can give access later - but I will need to get to firewall for remote ports and add an ssh key for you.

@webworker01 
Try this one?

[18-Oct-19 06:22 AM] webworker01#3884
yes i see that one

[18-Oct-19 06:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh great... I think i gave you CMaurice txid. Does it show confirmed?

[18-Oct-19 06:23 AM] webworker01#3884
no, 0's

[18-Oct-19 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not showing in my chain.... So you must be forked or I messed up the filter, and its picking unconfirmed txns...

[18-Oct-19 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Leave it with me for now. I'll get back to it. Might be able to force my node into this state.

[18-Oct-19 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems I need to make a tx  but not let it get mined...

[18-Oct-19 06:25 AM] webworker01#3884
np i'll check back tomorrow

yesterdays update seemed fine here

[18-Oct-19 10:32 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi guys üëã

While taking a few minutes to recover from a rough week at work I'd like to tell you a story that relates to you.

It shows some of the character of the people here and makes me even more proud of what we've got and what we are doing.

For the last 6 weeks I've been out and about, meeting many other projects and people involved with blockchain and crypto.  The amount of lame 'tech' and blatant scams I've seen is quite eye opening. 

Certainly some naivety on my part.  That's what working with people like you, who are busting their asses to create real and valuable things, has done to me.  I was thinking that what we are doing here is normal.  It's not.

This experience has had me thinking a lot.

There is great demand in big-business for what we already have, not to mention what is well along in development. Some very smart people find it hard to believe that what we are doing could be possible.  They only dream of having things that we have already had in production for months and months.

Komodo, and what we work on here in KMDLabs, is building towards something big.  And it's thanks to people like you that it will get there.

Very glad to be here.

Hi @CMaurice üëã
Blackjok3r may have something, but if not I was wondering if you have any use for `Gateways` in your project (I dream of Sri Lankan cashews!)?

[18-Oct-19 10:42 AM] CrisF#3405
I want to learn more about that module but other things keep coming up.

[18-Oct-19 10:43 AM] CMaurice#1685
well, possibly, it's a specific example of a general class of projects that many are working on

[18-Oct-19 10:43 AM] CrisF#3405
I've almost finished the things I wanted to do on `Assets`.  The next is `Gateways`

[18-Oct-19 10:43 AM] CMaurice#1685
agreed, most of them should be starting with kmd wares

[18-Oct-19 10:44 AM] CrisF#3405
I'd be interested in following along and doing what I can to help.

[18-Oct-19 10:45 AM] CrisF#3405
It has been hard to get enough time to do it by myself.

[18-Oct-19 10:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Maybe we could end up with an example usecase, or even better, something you could use.

[18-Oct-19 10:48 AM] CMaurice#1685
I've sort of changed my mind recently about what are the best ideas going forward, have something that I should write up in the next week or so: again, nothing astoundingly imaginative and something many others are working on in the blockchain world

[18-Oct-19 10:50 AM] CMaurice#1685
but it's shoehorning something into blockchain that doesn't quite fit and I want to ruminate  a bit about whether problems can be surmounted

[18-Oct-19 10:54 AM] CrisF#3405
üÜí Would be interesting to hear your thoughts when your ready!

[18-Oct-19 11:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
@CrisF I have several business use cases to apply to Komodo and would love to put together an ERP system built on LABS. Especially with an nSPV based API for data entry.

[18-Oct-19 11:52 AM] daemonfox#6136
I have the data structure for the entire system burned into my brain at this point... from base configurations, to item, package, pricing and inventory management to sales entry, payment capture, order management, customer management and scheduling to billing, balancing, accounting subledger management and General Ledger financial reporting.

[18-Oct-19 11:53 AM] daemonfox#6136
and then all the KPI metrics anyone has ever thought of to sum it all up.

[18-Oct-19 11:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Well, we have the place and some tools already made for working on it.
Do you have a plan for attacking it, @daemonfox ?

[18-Oct-19 12:00 PM] CrisF#3405
Or is that something to cook up next?

[18-Oct-19 12:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
that is next step...

[18-Oct-19 12:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ive poked questions here before

[18-Oct-19 12:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
I need to learn how to use oracles to push data into txes

[18-Oct-19 12:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
and I need to create a data structure scheme but in a blockchain tx based format

[18-Oct-19 12:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
and then map where all the data needs to live, how to fetch it properly and link all the needed static data

[18-Oct-19 12:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
then how do I maintain changes... thats as far as I got

[18-Oct-19 12:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
i believe on my own.... i could parse and lift an entire existing ERP data set into a set of assets that would be able to be queried

[18-Oct-19 12:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
but then making it functional...

[18-Oct-19 12:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
im not a UI person...

[18-Oct-19 12:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
a known shortage here

[18-Oct-19 12:04 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I been doin dat

[18-Oct-19 12:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
Do you know what the biggest gripe in retail biz is?

[18-Oct-19 12:05 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
UI isnt my strong suit, but I got json data structures in orcale all over the place

[18-Oct-19 12:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
its the customer experience

[18-Oct-19 12:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
and Amazon figured out it begins with speed of process

[18-Oct-19 12:05 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, UI is really lacking.
I've been looking for and met a few people doing that recently.

[18-Oct-19 12:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
businesses are SCREAMING for real checkout solutions but only big box solutions like what Target does are hardy and stout

[18-Oct-19 12:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
small biz CRIES and i see it daily in what i do for work

[18-Oct-19 12:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
smk thats what I need...

[18-Oct-19 12:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
to parse these DBs out to JSON format and then store them on chain with idexes

[18-Oct-19 12:06 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
small example - https://oracle.earth/oracle_samples/?chain=ORACLEARTH&oracletxid=a6a987247adcdb71bd308e8704075c3d796cef1e0e338ac1fcec7de820c1a6fd&batonaddr=RMDEsL5UR3V7usuYzyPmgHKwtCrWxH6Jxe&num=20
this data feeds to make this graph (or one like it) - https://oracle.earth/labs_ntx_graph/?chain=cfekmylo6

Most of the guys I've met are on projects atm, but can start pushing that more seriously (rather than generally)

[18-Oct-19 12:07 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
defining what is better in DB vs oracle is a fine art tho. wholesale migration to pure oracles is less than ideal.

[18-Oct-19 12:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
all of that is awesome!

[18-Oct-19 12:08 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
basically, oracles are best for static data in chronological order. if values need to change, use a db, else you just spam up the chain

[18-Oct-19 12:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
So for transactional data, that wont be changed and eventually parsed out to historical chains, oracles work.

[18-Oct-19 12:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
What about config values that need to live and breathe?

[18-Oct-19 12:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
contracts?

[18-Oct-19 12:10 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you can get around the chronological a bit with an index, and I've made a migration tool for archiving oracles/data to feed into a fresh chain if bloat becomes an issue

[18-Oct-19 12:12 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
immutable ledger means storing variable data can lead to a lot of stale info. Unless you need it for historical purposes to show how and when it changed, DB is still probably better.

[18-Oct-19 12:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
i suppose if the system had a module that easily migrated the chains to a new fresh chain, and then applied the newest configuration values, and did it easily, that would work

[18-Oct-19 12:12 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
oracle can work hand in hand with db tho

[18-Oct-19 12:12 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
provides redundancy and validation

[18-Oct-19 12:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
Chains with oracles dont need to change so no time there.... just the config based changes get replaced... mini hard forks

[18-Oct-19 12:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you could even get fancy with elastic clusters

[18-Oct-19 12:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
oooooo now we talking fancy lol... scalability
