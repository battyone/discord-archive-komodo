Got 2 nodes to stake with so should be ok

[24-May-19 03:25 PM] Alright#0419
the chains aren't going to be affected

[24-May-19 03:25 PM] Alright#0419
just notarizations on them

[24-May-19 03:26 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

seed ips for main chain, will use like the first 3 posted üòÖ

[24-May-19 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
could be an advantage notarization wise, just saying....

[24-May-19 03:30 PM] Alright#0419
ehhhhhh maybe we shouldn't use NN IPs as seeds

[24-May-19 03:30 PM] Alright#0419
I have at least 2 I can run that aren't NN server

[24-May-19 03:30 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've supplied a non NN IP

[24-May-19 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should probabgly add quite a few over time,. seems we have no DNS seeds in t4eh daemon its turned off

[24-May-19 03:31 PM] gcharang#6833
68.183.226.124 - my NN IP

[24-May-19 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
NN as seeds is fine, but some others should also be included... 5-6 ips should be plenty as long as you find one. most labs cahins for me usually ahve 20+ connections

If NN ips are good, here's mine: 195.201.165.7

[24-May-19 03:35 PM] Alright#0419
not going to use NN ips, a bit unfair if you're hoarding peers

[24-May-19 03:35 PM] Alright#0419
I'll try to figure out how to addnode= all NN IPs in default .conf

[24-May-19 04:35 PM] Exile13#4458
or things that should be accomplished

[24-May-19 04:36 PM] CrisF#3405
Goal is join as many notarizations as possible.  Apart from that keep an eye out for updates.

[24-May-19 04:37 PM] Exile13#4458
is there a command i enter manually to join in on these notarizations, or is it done by being online

[24-May-19 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You get paid LABS for each notarization you make. Make as many as you can. That is your only job. üòÑ

[24-May-19 04:37 PM] Exile13#4458
ok

[24-May-19 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for the first week the block reward is very small... plenty of time for everyone to get started

[24-May-19 04:39 PM] Exile13#4458
by being online the node is notarizing?

[24-May-19 04:39 PM] Exile13#4458
or is there info i must verify

[24-May-19 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
With 1000 coins, I wouldnt use the pos64staker.... split to like 10 address each in a seperate segid...
