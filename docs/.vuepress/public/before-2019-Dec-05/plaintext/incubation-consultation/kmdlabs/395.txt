you need to setup -whitelist or -walletfilter manually to activate notarizations?

[24-May-19 07:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no.

[24-May-19 07:24 PM] Alright#0419

started and stopped mining LABS, because, after starting that, no call works

[24-May-19 07:27 PM] SHossain#0007
getinfo gets stuck, same with listunspent

[24-May-19 07:27 PM] Alright#0419
you're on latest master branch?

[24-May-19 07:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@SHossain  may need fresh clone

[24-May-19 07:28 PM] SHossain#0007
`./start.sh` did the build

[24-May-19 07:28 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. will try fresh build

[24-May-19 07:28 PM] jorian#4555
so do we get 0.14 LABS on each notarization participation?

[24-May-19 07:28 PM] Alright#0419
it's tiny until slow start ends

[24-May-19 07:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems that we are .... I thaught it should be less than than that

[24-May-19 07:29 PM] Alright#0419
it's 1 coin until 10080

[24-May-19 07:29 PM] gcharang#6833

[24-May-19 07:30 PM] TonyL#3577
My LABS balance increased on 0.4283 coins after 3 notas

[24-May-19 07:30 PM] Alright#0419
1 coin every notarization split between each of the notaries that did it

[24-May-19 07:30 PM] Alright#0419
then 10 after block 10080

[24-May-19 07:30 PM] TonyL#3577
So looks correct

[24-May-19 07:30 PM] TonyL#3577
~0.14 * 7 ~  1

[24-May-19 07:31 PM] Alright#0419
have to consider that fungible chains are another source of income for notaries

[24-May-19 07:31 PM] Alright#0419
if 80/20 is miserably fucked and unsustainable, we can consider changing it

[24-May-19 07:31 PM] Alright#0419
80 POS/POW, 20 notaries

[24-May-19 07:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Hard choice we have now

[24-May-19 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
seems so

[24-May-19 07:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
same here

[24-May-19 07:35 PM] Alright#0419
I don't think we actually forked, seems to be people running the wrong builds

[24-May-19 07:36 PM] Alright#0419
Ayyyy remember, you can claim bug bounties for *anything*, just need to convince >50% of notaries that the amount you're claiming is fair for that bug

[24-May-19 07:36 PM] Alright#0419
limit is 1% of weekly emissions, not carrying over each week

[24-May-19 07:37 PM] Alright#0419

[24-May-19 07:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what if 51% of notaries collude to take bounties for themselves?
