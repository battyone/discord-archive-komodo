[02-Nov-18 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[02-Nov-18 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[02-Nov-18 03:12 PM] Alright#0419

whoops üòÖ

[02-Nov-18 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
might need a new chain if I can't unstall this

[02-Nov-18 03:15 PM] CrisF#3405
haha

[02-Nov-18 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
if I split the coins I have now, it will stall forever I think

[02-Nov-18 03:16 PM] Alright#0419
I sent out way too many coins to notaries

[02-Nov-18 03:16 PM] Alright#0419
ok definitely not recommended

[02-Nov-18 03:17 PM] Alright#0419
but can you stake MLT on your notaries please?

[02-Nov-18 03:17 PM] Alright#0419
I'll split what I have now, but I will need some way to confirm that tx

[02-Nov-18 03:17 PM] CrisF#3405
Really? Most I got was 50!

[02-Nov-18 03:18 PM] Alright#0419
there's only ~1000

[02-Nov-18 03:18 PM] CrisF#3405
I wasn't able to split 50.  The possplitter didn't work on it.

[02-Nov-18 03:19 PM] Alright#0419
meant to send 5 to each, sent 50 >.<

[02-Nov-18 03:19 PM] CrisF#3405
Sent out 15 by hand on one chain.

[02-Nov-18 03:19 PM] Alright#0419
not a big deal to just start another though

[02-Nov-18 03:19 PM] CrisF#3405
Blast it üòâ

[02-Nov-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Master has update for gettransaction fix

[02-Nov-18 03:22 PM] Alright#0419
ok, wait a few minutes before you restart your notaries

[02-Nov-18 03:22 PM] Alright#0419
I'll start new chain, get rid of MLT and push new assetchains.json

[02-Nov-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mine is off üòÇ

[02-Nov-18 03:23 PM] Alright#0419
no worries

[02-Nov-18 03:32 PM] Alright#0419
Ah, CFEKMLT should start moving along

[02-Nov-18 03:32 PM] Alright#0419

[02-Nov-18 03:53 PM] Alright#0419

[02-Nov-18 03:53 PM] Alright#0419

I would say your betst bet is to kill the whole node

[02-Nov-18 04:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and resync it

[02-Nov-18 04:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
make sure you have latest master

[02-Nov-18 04:31 PM] CrisF#3405
They are on 2 diferent nodes.

[02-Nov-18 04:31 PM] CrisF#3405
Ok.

[02-Nov-18 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well that one isnt syncing, so I would try and resync it

[02-Nov-18 04:32 PM] Alright#0419
can you check debug if it was rejecting blocks @CrisF

[02-Nov-18 04:32 PM] CrisF#3405

[02-Nov-18 11:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
I know its not the right room for the subject, but is the kmdtipbot repo somewhere public?

[02-Nov-18 11:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
I cant find it anywhere just older versions for other coins

[02-Nov-18 11:51 PM] CrisF#3405
CFEK and CFEKLF haven't notarized for me recently also.

[02-Nov-18 11:52 PM] CrisF#3405
Not sure about the tipbot, @daemonfox .

[03-Nov-18 12:17 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
still no backnotarisation, and I dont think its coming. will let it run for a bit more while I do some outdoor work tho

[03-Nov-18 12:30 AM] CrisF#3405
I haven't had a notarization on any chain for the last 45~60 mins.
