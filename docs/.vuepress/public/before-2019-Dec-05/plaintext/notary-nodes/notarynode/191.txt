> `-j$(nproc)` uses all available processor threads while compiling. If you don't want to use all threads, you can use `-j8` which will use only 8 threads.
here you go. added that

[04-May-19 09:12 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you

[04-May-19 09:13 PM] phm87#7395
I made a mistake one time with ``-j$(nproc)`` and it used all threads ... I had to Ctrl-C to stop it (my mistake was to leave the $ and parenthesis I think)

[04-May-19 09:13 PM] zatJUM#9924
Thaught 400 was a good practice ```I don't know if it is normal but there is no chmod 600 on komodo.conf in the guide, I guessed that we can do it```

[04-May-19 09:15 PM] SHossain#0007
added chmod 600 komodo.conf

Komodo 👌 

[04-May-19 09:15 PM] SHossain#0007
if you copy paste the commands i listed, you shouldn't have to leave out `$`

[04-May-19 09:17 PM] phm87#7395
Your explanation explains clearly why I had a problem ``> -j$(nproc) uses all available processor threads while compiling`` as I made the compilation on a server with other stuff that were running (and were not happy with all threads used)

[04-May-19 09:17 PM] phm87#7395
about the 600 and 400, I have no clues, I used sth else but I don't remember exactly

[04-May-19 09:18 PM] SHossain#0007
you are not using anything else on that server. the guide is for setting up Notary Node on a fresh server

[04-May-19 09:18 PM] phm87#7395
yes

[04-May-19 09:18 PM] SHossain#0007
if you continue to follow the guide from beginning, there is nothing else running which would be a problem

[04-May-19 09:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
you re not supposed to build a NN on a mining pool server with 80% threads used lol

[04-May-19 09:18 PM] SHossain#0007
almost all threads will be empty

[04-May-19 09:18 PM] phm87#7395
dwy : I did it for the testnet NN, I won't do it for mainet of course ^^

[04-May-19 09:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
so noneed to change something for something that can t happen on real conditions :)

[04-May-19 09:19 PM] SHossain#0007
`as I made the compilation on a server with other stuff that were running (and were not happy with all threads used)`
so, on mainnet, this is not an issue

[04-May-19 09:19 PM] phm87#7395
I agree

[05-May-19 10:28 PM] PHBA2061#2530
wow if the number is accurate then that's a lot, I'm surprised, that's about 1/3 the full nodes number of Bitcoin or Ethereum

[05-May-19 10:29 PM] Alright#0419
3324 unique ips?

[05-May-19 10:29 PM] Alright#0419
😮

[05-May-19 10:30 PM] Alright#0419
ok so one ip with say DEX KMD SUPERNET running counts as 3?

[05-May-19 10:31 PM] Alright#0419

[05-May-19 10:31 PM] phm87#7395
with only unique ip, how much is it ?

[05-May-19 10:33 PM] phm87#7395
thank you

[05-May-19 10:56 PM] phm87#7395
@PHBA2061  about the comparison with bitcoin full nodes, I don't know if we are comparing the same things when counting. Maybe we should ask @webworker01

PSA: a lot of people believe there are about 10,000 Bitcoin nodes. This is incorrect, this number is the amount of *listening* nodes.

The total number of Bitcoin full nodes now exceeds 100,000.

Hello everyone, sorry for the big noob question, but is there a reward for having a notary node or is it just to support komodo?

Notary Node operators receive the reward on 'easy mining' on the KMD chain, @elisia .  I believe that NN ops account for 75% of all mining.

[06-May-19 11:24 AM] PHBA2061#2530
but if the candidate use VOTE2019 token for notarization activities, it is allowed right ?

[06-May-19 11:51 AM] Mylo#8306
unlikely.   i think the procedure is to test that the transactions have only "one hop" from their original airdrop address.  any more and it's ignored.

[06-May-19 11:52 AM] Mylo#8306
what that means, is the explorers may see that candidateX has +1M votes, but when the official count is taken, they'll see that those +1M votes were not "1 hop from airdrop"

[06-May-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
change addresses make that logic not work

[06-May-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
easier is to make sure no funds are moved from candidate addresses

[06-May-19 11:56 AM] Mylo#8306
there's an example of someone who knows blockchain like the back of their hand, and applies simple rational logic to solve the problem.

at least one notary use the same address for an active node and also as voting address

[06-May-19 12:05 PM] CHMEX#0686
which results in sending votes....

[06-May-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
active node would just be doing splitfunds and notarizations though, not sending to a different address

[06-May-19 12:10 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah that's the specific address in question, I noticed it was splitting funds & notarizing, thanks for clarifying

Not sure what is the worst
-reaching to be elected, passing through all colors of the rainbow emotionally during the last week when your ranking is doing yoyo around the crucial position between being elected or not
-being auto-reelected, watching and waiting to send your votes because you know last days may be critical and some potentially good candidate may need your help at last moment

For this time I am living the elections without being candidate
Seriously not easy

Searched a long time for the best criteria for voting
Finally came to:
-the best potential new blood (Darwinian and logical)
-the candidates I would find very unfair to not be elected (needed more thoughts, can be discussed and certainly more subjective)

Anyway the SH situation is very tight
Too much good potential op’s for spots, wish we could have 9 winners 😄

[07-May-19 12:46 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I wonder if there would be any merit conducting the elections on a private chain for the next election. Airdrop funds to all the transparent addresses and deny R to R transactions. This way ensuring people cant send/sell funds to others(as they cant R to R transaction) and also having the election results private. This would rely on candidates providing a viewing key or priv key to the election master at the end to prove votes.

[07-May-19 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
That makes it easier to send votes to another candidate

No need to stop as long as you dont send it to another address thats fine. Maybe next year we all use a non notary adress....

@Alright what is the purpose of dropping min sigs every couple of days?   what does it test?

[07-May-19 11:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Remember that not only purely tech specialists are needed in the dpow network. Coordination and service providers are a very important part of the network too since new coins need a way to make contact and formalize payments and such. Chainmakers has handled most of the new comers to dpow service. We have coordinated integrations, deployments and payments handling for many of the coins being notarized right now.

For people who has not voted yet and are looking to keep the worthy candidates in, please take Chainmakers into account as the business front that dpow needs.
