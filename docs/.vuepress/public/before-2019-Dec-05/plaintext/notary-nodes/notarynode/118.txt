I will try and get the rescan from height merged down in time. It will really really help with things like that. U can kill -9 komodod btw

[12-Apr-19 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Started again with out rescan with key imported

[12-Apr-19 01:20 AM] Greer#0666
I figured I'd let it go, good practice for me to fix it again after.

Has anyone notarised in the last 45 mins?

[12-Apr-19 03:18 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I think dexstats is down

[12-Apr-19 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm yeah the website seems stuck

[12-Apr-19 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I loaded up my notary will let u know if I see any notarizations happen

[12-Apr-19 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
PIZZA just went here... not mine but a nota happened

[12-Apr-19 03:19 AM] PHBA2061#2530
there actually are some nota  https://beer.kmdexplorer.io/address/RXL3YXG2ceaB6C5hfJcN4fvmLH2C34knhA

did you try my method?

[12-Apr-19 03:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, I was too busy making this one what it should have been a yr ago

[12-Apr-19 03:52 AM] Alright#0419
you could do it in a single block

[12-Apr-19 03:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I understand the concept, but I don't see how you can pack that much data

[12-Apr-19 03:59 AM] Alright#0419
I could be mistaken, haven't looked at the numbers in depth

[12-Apr-19 03:59 AM] Alright#0419
it's kind of useless unless you're actually trying to recover the coins

[12-Apr-19 03:59 AM] Alright#0419
just send the first round of combines to some random address

[12-Apr-19 03:59 AM] Alright#0419
same result

[12-Apr-19 04:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, atm, it's more about maximizing this specific script

[12-Apr-19 04:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

what's the divergence point where a node realizes it's on its own fork and re-corrects?

[12-Apr-19 04:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

seeing xrobesx in the NA list.. doubt he is running this year

[12-Apr-19 06:13 AM] jorian#4555
doubt he is physically still running as well..

[12-Apr-19 06:14 AM] jorian#4555
so with that list we still need to go through them one by one to first check if they're running and second what their proposal is

[12-Apr-19 06:14 AM] jorian#4555
a good way to force people to read proposals 😄

[12-Apr-19 06:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
read? who does that?

[12-Apr-19 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
did we just import last years proposals? I think if there isnt a new proposal, there is no candidacy

[12-Apr-19 06:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[12-Apr-19 06:15 AM] jorian#4555
well that's the thing james

[12-Apr-19 06:15 AM] jorian#4555
there is no such thing as a proposal this year

[12-Apr-19 06:16 AM] jorian#4555
it's only the general info page

[12-Apr-19 06:16 AM] jorian#4555
and there are a lot of old info pages

[12-Apr-19 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
did we just import last years "general info page"? I think if there isnt a new "general info page", there is no candidacy

[12-Apr-19 06:17 AM] jorian#4555
talking about Deckers list, he could set a filter indeed

[12-Apr-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
if someone cant be bothered to change "2018" to "2019" then it seems they are not serious candidate

for this year, this is all we can manage - the election process began with no meta-data to help with the advertisements.  this is something for next year, unless every NN proposal wants to update with some meta data info

If you are going to contribute to list making, plz use 
```
for i in  `git log --pretty=format: --name-only --since="43 days ago" | grep notarynodes | grep -i "README.md"  | sort | uniq`
```
or some equivalent to get at least a recent list of updates.

[12-Apr-19 06:31 AM] Mylo#8306
from the notarynodes repo once you've cloned it.

I cleaned out the ones without proposal update and created a richtlist.
It can be found here https://dexstats.info/votelist.php like last year.
I know some people don't like it - than simply don't use it.
No decision will be made based on that list. The list might be faulty or not work at times. DYOR use different data sources.
Kolo is the election master. Kolo will announce the winners. Now happy election and good luck to everybody.

"notarynodes" is folder for everyone, not just for candidates and proposals of this season

[12-Apr-19 11:07 AM] kolo#1111
Do not assume all folders there are/can be candidates. It's also current nodes and wanna be nodes, but not eligble

[12-Apr-19 11:11 AM] newvulcan#4719
I take it seeing "Invalid Block Mined" for TXS is nothing to be concerned about, just I missed out on mining that block because someone beat me to it ?

[12-Apr-19 11:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
@newvulcan that error can happen normally sometimes, but sometimes it indicated something deeper that is wrong

@newvulcan for which chain? which commit?

[12-Apr-19 11:19 AM] newvulcan#4719
Its for TXSCLCC

[12-Apr-19 11:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am actually dealing with that exact same error in mining a new HUSH chain, but it's because I am doing something wrong

[12-Apr-19 11:19 AM] CHMEX#0686
we are at 194716

[12-Apr-19 11:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
my guess would be that @blackjok3r broke it or knows the fix :abusedsmily:

[12-Apr-19 11:20 AM] CHMEX#0686
194691 was 25 mins ago. Is that your current height?

[12-Apr-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its normal lol

[12-Apr-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Launch a new assetchain with 8 threads minining from block0 and see how much it does it ;)

[12-Apr-19 11:20 AM] newvulcan#4719
I think I'm up to date - last block notarized in the log was 194704

[12-Apr-19 11:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
but it's also possible the error means something really bad is broken, if you can't mine a new block

[12-Apr-19 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The only change made to mining code is for ac_nk and its not merged to kmd... Only in labs

I broke stuff such that a genesis block can be mined, but all future blocks fail to connect, lulz

[12-Apr-19 11:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
it might be from a int32 vs int64, testing

[12-Apr-19 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Haja the nk params did the same thing... I had to skip the pow check for genisis block for those.

[12-Apr-19 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But again I have not merged such radical change to kmd until many months of testing on labs proves that it is stable

@newvulcan you'll get that error 1-8% of the time
