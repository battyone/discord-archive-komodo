we just need to spread the word about KMD little bit more ... for example, here some people didn't hear anything about KMD, and this is sadly. if we look on most popular crypto-related local forums - there is tons of messages in every shitcoin threads, but nothing in KMD thread. some proof - https://forum.bits.media/index.php?/forum/146-equihash/ (just an equihash section of altcoins forum). ZCL - 147 messages, ZEC - 6079 messages, BTG - 432 messages, even VOT - 313 messages ... and finally ... KMD lowest record - **27 messages** ... (

and this is one of the most popular crypto-related forum.

[31-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Decker#3767
will do something with it next days ... seems need to write a big post about out tech, available wallets, roadmap and other things.

[31-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Decker#3767
why i started to talk about this - it seems to me we have a great tech, wonderful team ... but have some mistakes in "advertising". i can bet 500 KMD or more, that nobody here hear about assets, BaaS features, even BarterDEX and HyperDEX.

[31-Jul-18 01:11 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah we are not good shillers.  never heard of that forum üòõ

[31-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Decker#3767
because it's not international ...

[31-Jul-18 01:15 PM] Decker#3767
but it's one of the most popular here. people too lazy to read english forums (if english is not their home lang), they always prefer local language.

do the peer2cloud (NN) debit cards loaded with komodo work there?

[31-Jul-18 01:36 PM] Mylo#8306
do we have a russian ambassador?

one question, we are seeing a lot of 
{"notary":"badass_EU","bestk":-1,"recvmask":"               0","bestmask":"               0"}

[31-Jul-18 02:42 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
in our SH node. From different nodes, of course not only from badass_EU, however that doesn't happen in our AR node

[31-Jul-18 02:42 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
any idea why that might be happening?

[31-Jul-18 02:46 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
should we track all nodes that get this on SH node and contact node operators for some kind of IP whitelabelling or something???

[31-Jul-18 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think thats a problem with your node, check UTXO's and make sure all process are running.

[31-Jul-18 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I get those, when I reset wallet.dat and komodod isn't runnign while iguana is still up.

[31-Jul-18 03:24 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
mmm will check, however we still notarize, just this appears a lot on SH node thats why I asked, with all services up and running

[31-Jul-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
strange...

[31-Jul-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[01-Aug-18 06:17 AM] smellycouch#3071
Sorry for the dumb question  ,

[01-Aug-18 06:18 AM] smellycouch#3071
How many notaries would need to collude to create a problem?

[01-Aug-18 06:18 AM] smellycouch#3071
51?

[01-Aug-18 06:19 AM] smellycouch#3071
Or is 51 the maximum number that can be turned off?

[01-Aug-18 06:19 AM] smellycouch#3071
I read conflicting collusion values in different places...  51, and 30 something

[01-Aug-18 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
51 would need to go "on strike" to prevent notarizations from happening

[01-Aug-18 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries cant just make up random data to notarize as it is validated by all nodes, so their power is limited to witholding of notarization

[01-Aug-18 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
however, independent of notarization power, notaries also get to easy mine 75% of the blocks, so 2/3rds of notaries colluding could do a 51%, that would be 42 notaries needed

[01-Aug-18 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@kimmel (Pungo.io) 
I did some checks for you, you are not in `recvmask` of these nodes:
`
"artik_EU"ca333_EU","chainmakers_NA","etszombi_EU","indenodes_EU","komodoninja_SH","libscott_SH","popcornbag_AR","popcornbag_NA","titomane_SH"]`

I have filtered out the nodes that are not in my recvmask or dwy's recvmask. This is a small sample size of just one BTC rotation. But clearly the issue is in some kind of network route, like Decker was having before. Sorry for pointing you in the wrong direction yesterday, it should not be an issue with your UTXO's or deamon's being down.

[01-Aug-18 07:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have experianced the odd round where I am also just not recognised in `recvmask` seems to be a network issue, due to where our nodes are. Both are quite the distance from most other nodes.

[01-Aug-18 07:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Checked a few more rounds, and the list is not changing. Maybe contact your Data Centre. You might need to contact those operators and get the IP address of their nodes to check better. Hope this helps.

[01-Aug-18 09:15 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
hey @blackjok3r thanks for your help, will keep checking recvmask to see how this changes

[01-Aug-18 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to modify webworkers `checkmasks` script so the `seed` was 38 for p2c_SH and also had to add a line to print my `not`

Is it still possible to become a notary node operator other than replacement ?  Any plans for expansion?

[01-Aug-18 09:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
@SHossain @Decker I'm not sure how well that benchmark actually represents real word performance

[01-Aug-18 09:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
I think for a lot of those SIMD style instruction sets you need to be doing constant computation to get the benefits

[01-Aug-18 09:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
lighting all cores up 100% doing SHA256 will give you a big perf boost

[01-Aug-18 09:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
just doing one hash every now and then like with iguana may not give much of a boost

[01-Aug-18 09:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
could even decrease perf

[01-Aug-18 09:43 PM] lukechilds#2707
due to potential throttling when using advanced instruction sets

[01-Aug-18 09:43 PM] SHossain#0007
i like your idea about the option to integrate `./m_notary -sha256=AVX`. that would give operators to test the difference and choose the one that works best for them

[01-Aug-18 09:43 PM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, it would definitely be interesting to test

I've sent a bit more BTC to those who low. Please, stop worrying and crying. Unlike last year - having 0.15 BTC is totally ok and allows you to wait another 12-36 hours (actually week or two) for funds.

[01-Aug-18 11:30 PM] kolo#1111
Prev year 0.10 (and up to 0.4) BTC happened to be unusable dust so 0.15 was the reason to put funds urgently. Not this year

I have fixed the m_notary scripts if some one wants to get my changes and have a look and make a pr that would be great, I don't want to merge everything in my fork, I have no idea how to pick some changes to merge lol.

[02-Aug-18 12:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I grabbed 20 game off shapeshift too, 4 kmd should not have to worry about this for some time. Thanks for btc refils I think I was starting to get a bit low, I will need to send btc balance to self now, so there is only 1 utxo, this stops iguana being able to split twice in case of mempool being stuck for more than 6h. :)

I don't have any notarizations on GLXT nor GAME for quite some time. None of my chains are forked, dpowassets reports a success when dpow'ing GLXT and GAME.
GAME is out of funds, which solves that mystery, but GLXT has a lot of spendable UTXO's and should be working. Does anyone know what might be wrong so I can fix it?

[05-Aug-18 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Did you change it to the new supply?

[05-Aug-18 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181

I would mine it, but even USB ASIC's are too low, if you keep the chain moving even just a litle bit, the profit switcher just comes back on when its under X diff and destroys the chain again.
