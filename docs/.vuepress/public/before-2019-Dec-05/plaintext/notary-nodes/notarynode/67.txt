for you!

[01-Apr-19 07:24 AM] Strob#3417
On my part I just finally got a TXSCLCC! I was doing only beer for a while...

[01-Apr-19 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It is a random process guys.. You need litteral days of data to know how your node is working. Some times youc an go weeks without a nota on one chain even though your overall stats are qutie good.

[01-Apr-19 07:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm gonna disagree its random until I start having problems notarising. :troll:

Dead in the water here.  Will leave it for a few more hours.

[01-Apr-19 09:23 AM] SHossain#0007
the long gap in testnet is normal

[01-Apr-19 09:23 AM] SHossain#0007
restart your node and try again.

[01-Apr-19 09:23 AM] CrisF#3405
I did 2 hours ago.

[01-Apr-19 09:24 AM] SHossain#0007
after we added TXSCLCC chain, my node was only notarizing that. i rebooted my node and started everything again and it started working better

[01-Apr-19 09:24 AM] SHossain#0007
the network is running fine

[01-Apr-19 09:24 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, will give that a go.

[01-Apr-19 09:24 AM] CrisF#3405
That's why I've been worried, haha.

[01-Apr-19 09:26 AM] SHossain#0007
the last taks was to mimic a little bit of mainnet. after each restart of iguana it may take few hours before getting any notarization. last year's testnet was the same. please guys do not panic.

and, make sure you are using a decent setup for this testnet. using a 2-core VPS with 4GB RAM may not be enough (i'm sure you guys all have a  good setup 游땎 )

my node ran out of kmd  utxo when I was sleeping and has not notarized ever since, just did the split and now wait and hope 游땟

[01-Apr-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will use the smallest crappiest VPS I can get my hands on that works :troll:

[01-Apr-19 09:34 AM] SHossain#0007
true it works on low-end setup

[01-Apr-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not very well... but it works

[01-Apr-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its onyl testnet why waste $$$

[01-Apr-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as it works 游땏

[01-Apr-19 09:36 AM] SHossain#0007
2-core with 8GB RAM is a good setup

[01-Apr-19 09:39 AM] PHBA2061#2530
If only I could learn that sooner. I used a VPS with the exact spec requirement for the mainnet 游땍

[01-Apr-19 09:40 AM] zatJUM#9924
My VPS for testnet is too crappy, sorry 游땭

[01-Apr-19 09:41 AM] SHossain#0007
@PHBA2061 i did the same last year. and, this year also. current testnet node is better than the min rec spec

[01-Apr-19 09:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I wanted to testdrive what I'd be using for mainnet, so mine's not bad.

I'll just try to find why iguana doesn't work with pizza and beer, but won't be able to run TXSCLCC

[01-Apr-19 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just add 4GB swap

[01-Apr-19 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine is fine with that... if iguana is using too much ram, use my build

[01-Apr-19 09:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
took a while to get it verified, but so far I'm pretty happy with it

[01-Apr-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looks like tis doing well

[01-Apr-19 09:43 AM] SHossain#0007
Test driving your hw for mainnet is the best idea

[01-Apr-19 09:43 AM] SHossain#0007
you would already know if that works fine or not

[01-Apr-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Agreed if you need to do that sure

[01-Apr-19 09:44 AM] SHossain#0007
no need to panic when mainnet starts

[01-Apr-19 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did that last year

[01-Apr-19 09:44 AM] SHossain#0007
we want ops to be ready when mainnet launches

Given the last 4 notarizations of TXSCLCC, I'm going to say that either alright's theory of "first come, first served" is busted or my node is

[01-Apr-19 11:12 AM] mrlynch#5735

[01-Apr-19 11:14 AM] mrlynch#5735
am thinking of giving @blackjok3r's iguana a go.. @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator is pulling away from me faster than i like

[01-Apr-19 11:14 AM] mrlynch#5735
would that work on mainnet as well?

[01-Apr-19 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it works for everything that I can tell... LABS has a slightly modified verison for MoMoM stuff... but I think that needs to come to mainnet at teh hard fork.

[01-Apr-19 11:15 AM] mrlynch#5735
will it be integrated at the hard fork?

[01-Apr-19 11:15 AM] mrlynch#5735
the LABS iguana?

[01-Apr-19 11:16 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

Yes My iguana neds much testing... as Its propelled my node to clear no1 SH  ... and show no suign of slowing down, I assume ppl will just move over to it... if it doesnt break things I will merge it to jls repo

pretty sure it has no bugs apart from a small ~8mb per hour memory leak that I couldnt seem to fix.

The trick is the loop that calls the dpow threads to start... teh more coins added the longe r and longer between each call... so I wrote a new loop wthat calls them faster... very simple
