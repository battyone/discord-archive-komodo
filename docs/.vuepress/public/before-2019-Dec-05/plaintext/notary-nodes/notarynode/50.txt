defsomething wrong witht he testnet iguana ...

[26-Mar-19 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I realy don think it should be on master branch

[26-Mar-19 09:18 AM] jorian#4555
why?

[26-Mar-19 09:18 AM] Alright#0419
it's not master branch

[26-Mar-19 09:18 AM] Alright#0419
it's dev branch of jl777's Supernet branch

[26-Mar-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well its not

[26-Mar-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because im using the same iguana as mainnet and its struggling to speak with you guys

[26-Mar-19 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not like it really matters... but its clearly not dev branch iguana

[26-Mar-19 09:24 AM] Alright#0419
I forked jl's repo, merge dev to master. Probably wasn't a clean merge, I skimmed through it, didn't see anything terrible

[26-Mar-19 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
let me make `testnet` branch from dev and we'll use that

[26-Mar-19 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
it seems to be working for everyone else though üòõ

[26-Mar-19 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its working for all of you using it... but its not the same as the iguana on mainnet... I dont know how important that is.. but I think we shoulda t least be using the same software

[26-Mar-19 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
@jorian @SHossain @CHMEX @PHBA2061 
Please do 
```
cd ~/2019NNtest/iguana
git checkout 2019testnet
git pull
pkill -15 iguana
./m_notary_testnet
```

[26-Mar-19 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r really don't think it's going to make a difference

[26-Mar-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah maybe blocks are just very slow I just ahd a nota

[26-Mar-19 09:35 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r so we can use master then?

[26-Mar-19 09:35 AM] Alright#0419
I'll undo this so it's simpler

[26-Mar-19 09:35 AM] SHossain#0007
master is good

[26-Mar-19 09:35 AM] Alright#0419
scroll up and read what he said

[26-Mar-19 09:36 AM] SHossain#0007
my testnode on master branch did notarization

[26-Mar-19 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we use dev branch... not sure youc an just merge dev to master and its going to be the same... but I guess it doesnt really amtter as long as It works the same way

[26-Mar-19 09:37 AM] Alright#0419
it is the same, this is why I said look at the git diff

[26-Mar-19 09:37 AM] Alright#0419
look at git diff between master and 2019testnet branch

[26-Mar-19 09:37 AM] Alright#0419
2019testnet branch was created using dev branch

[26-Mar-19 09:38 AM] Alright#0419
No worries, just use master

[26-Mar-19 09:38 AM] Alright#0419
Sorry for the ping everyone

[26-Mar-19 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe blocks are just very slow I dont know

[26-Mar-19 09:40 AM] SHossain#0007
blocks are 2 mins

[26-Mar-19 09:41 AM] SHossain#0007
used to be 5 mins before. alright wanted them 2

[26-Mar-19 09:42 AM] SHossain#0007
if you want any changes in block gen, let me know

[26-Mar-19 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can force blocks easy enough. It all seems to be working. Not sure why it stopped before... Maybe ppl were restarting and there wasnt enough nodes online

[26-Mar-19 02:07 PM] Strob#3417
Hi! For p2p which port should I open for those 3 coins?

[26-Mar-19 02:08 PM] Alright#0419
@Strob it's in the `getinfo` output

[26-Mar-19 02:08 PM] Strob#3417
ha ok tx!

[26-Mar-19 02:09 PM] Strob#3417
I read someone saying the p2p was not necessary  to notarize. Is that true?

[26-Mar-19 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its not nesseary but it works better the more connections you have

Thanks for the BEER and PIZZA! I started my node but I forgot to fund my KMD address before. I just sent 5 kmd is it enough?

[26-Mar-19 03:28 PM] Strob#3417
Seems to be working now!

[26-Mar-19 03:47 PM] jorian#4555
5 is plenty

[26-Mar-19 03:48 PM] jorian#4555
if you see a message in the output starting with ```bestk.4 13 PIZZA height.62990 mod.6 VINI.2 myind.4 MINE.``` then you did a notarization

[26-Mar-19 03:48 PM] jorian#4555
unless an error happens

[26-Mar-19 04:34 PM] Strob#3417
Ok Yes I see those!!!! I'm notarizing for the first time! Great day!!! üéÜ

[26-Mar-19 05:17 PM] Strob#3417
Do I need to split the fund (with this: https://github.com/jl777/SuperNET/blob/master/iguana/acsplit)?

[26-Mar-19 05:17 PM] Strob#3417
And in the mean time is what would be the command to see how much I notarize?

[26-Mar-19 05:18 PM] Mylo#8306
`./acsplit PIZZA 30` will split it 30x  10000 assetoshis

[26-Mar-19 05:19 PM] Mylo#8306
#kmdlabs have some sort of stats script, i'm sure it will make it's way to testnet eventually

[26-Mar-19 05:19 PM] Mylo#8306
there is one, but i don't know where it is (or use it)

[26-Mar-19 05:21 PM] Mylo#8306
based off what blackjok3r wrote earlier today as a lol comment, there is a rough point form list on installing notary node https://komodoplatform.com/tt2019-13-blockchain-payment-dividend-disbursement/

it just links to existing docs in specific places.

[26-Mar-19 05:22 PM] Mylo#8306
maybe a testnet notary can make a guide up üòõ

[26-Mar-19 05:22 PM] Strob#3417
But about the fund spliting, I don't understand what it is, is there any explanation about this process anywhere?

[26-Mar-19 05:24 PM] Mylo#8306
the tl;dr; version is iguana does a multi-sig (ms) tx with XX number of signers, and the template ms tx uses 10k sataoshi as the amount.

[26-Mar-19 05:25 PM] Mylo#8306
if everyone uses the 10k ms tx template, it saves a whole round of negotiating UTXO sizes for the tx.   so by pre-splitting, and agreeing to the template of 10k sataoshi....basically "heaps easier"

[26-Mar-19 05:28 PM] Strob#3417
Ok so do I just need to run that lukechilds command 1 time?

[26-Mar-19 05:28 PM] jorian#4555
if you get elected, you'll soon learn that wallet / utxo management is an art

[26-Mar-19 05:29 PM] jorian#4555
every notarization uses one 10,000 sats utxo

[26-Mar-19 05:29 PM] jorian#4555
so when you did a bunch, youll need to do a splitfund again

[26-Mar-19 05:29 PM] jorian#4555
you can do a zillion of them initially, but that only slows down your node a lot, so the trick is to keep the wallet 'as light as possible'

[26-Mar-19 05:30 PM] Strob#3417
Ok so is it just a matter of creating a cron job with that command then?

i have been using a version of this script

[26-Mar-19 05:31 PM] jorian#4555
as a cronjob

[26-Mar-19 05:31 PM] jorian#4555
it basically checks how many utxo each coin has

[26-Mar-19 05:31 PM] jorian#4555
and does a 'refill' to a certain threshold

[26-Mar-19 05:32 PM] jorian#4555
that komodo_scripts repo is a goldmine, if you ask me

[26-Mar-19 05:36 PM] Strob#3417
And I just need to uncomment the #declare -a kmd_coins=(BEER PIZZA DEX) line and remove DEX and comment the line before for the testnet I guess

[26-Mar-19 05:37 PM] jorian#4555
i'm not sure.. doesn't testnet do autosplit itself? don't know if you know it, but iguana can be supplied with a `nosplit` parameter, because at default, iguana will just split any coin to a certain number.

[26-Mar-19 05:39 PM] jorian#4555
as far as i know, it autosplits, but it doesn't hurt to set it up

[26-Mar-19 05:39 PM] Strob#3417
Ok...

[26-Mar-19 05:42 PM] jorian#4555
if you want to disable autosplit, you have to edit the `m_notary_testnet` file, and add `notary_nosplit` as a parameter to `../agents/iguana`

[26-Mar-19 05:43 PM] jorian#4555
but, `testnet` is already a parameter to that binary, so i don't know if nosplit needs to go before or after `testnet`
