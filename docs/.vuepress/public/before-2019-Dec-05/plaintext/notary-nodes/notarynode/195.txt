If anyone was interested in trying to get a spot as a LABS NN, you can now enter the lottery for the 2 additional spots we have. Details in #kmdlabs

[13-May-19 03:27 PM] Alright#0419
launching in about a week

[13-May-19 03:40 PM] Strob#3417
@SHossain ```last year test was mostly distributed``` Ok so this year concentration in EU because of price is maybe not the real reason üòâ

[13-May-19 03:41 PM] SHossain#0007
in real life on mainnet, AR has the highest amount of notarization

EU is 2nd and NA is 3rd

[13-May-19 03:46 PM] SHossain#0007
Testnet regions doesn't matter much and it wasn't enforced. candidates were free to choose any location to show that they can operate.

[13-May-19 03:47 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
OIC.. I chose / hosted entire time in NA thinking that was important if campaigning for NA spot

[13-May-19 03:48 PM] SHossain#0007
testnet is a playground where you learn how to operate a NN and show you are competent.
if you have selected your own region and the server you will use for mainnet if you win, you have done the best thing as you already know how your hardware may perform.

[13-May-19 03:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
true

[13-May-19 03:49 PM] SHossain#0007
when mainnet is live, you dont' have to worry about finding the best sevice provider

[13-May-19 03:49 PM] SHossain#0007
you already have

[13-May-19 03:49 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
testnet specs much lower than actual nn specs though

[13-May-19 03:50 PM] SHossain#0007
that is up to the candidate on which server to choose testnet, either high-end or low-end. i always suggested to use or go for the server you will use if you win

[13-May-19 03:50 PM] SHossain#0007
some candidates found that expensive

if you want to experience with different regions on testnet, try Google cloud or Azure, they'll give you free credits for opening an account

[13-May-19 03:52 PM] SHossain#0007
since there is no entry fee or other related fee, i guess confident candidates could use better hw üòÉ

[13-May-19 03:52 PM] SHossain#0007
i always advocate for üëΩ hw
free certification for all üòÇ

[13-May-19 03:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lo... When notary nodes have a use for 128 Cores, I will buy a server with 128 cores....  maybe next election? ü§£

[13-May-19 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Right now, best money drop is on fast I/O and lots of ram. üòÉ

[13-May-19 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
DDR3 even, as its many times cheaper

[13-May-19 04:02 PM] mrlynch#5735
nvme + ddr4 ecc ftw üòé

[13-May-19 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh optimal would be a consumer CPU with ridiculous clock speeds and some of that 4Ghz RAM ü§£

[13-May-19 04:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with nvme on PCI-E cards in RAID0.... if you wanted to be stupid.

EU always gets the most candidates.... cheap servers and all.... üôÑ

[13-May-19 04:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Nothing beats a good connection though, get that and your ndoe will be fine.

[13-May-19 04:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
not sure about cheap, i guess it depends where u get it

[13-May-19 04:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
i just discovered hetzner ü§¶

@TonyL if you are going with AWS as your servers, I wish you luck

[13-May-19 04:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I had AWS servers this whole second season

[13-May-19 04:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
fast servers doesn't mean assure of quality notarisations

I am paying ~$320 USD just for rack space and power/ unlimited bandwidth in Perth..... Had to purchase server on top of that lol... Here is expensive as hell.

[13-May-19 04:05 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
expensive in US for sure..

[13-May-19 04:05 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
for me anyways

[13-May-19 04:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
that is a lot

[13-May-19 04:06 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
KYC also pain in ass

[13-May-19 04:06 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
tough to get one to give you some privacy

[13-May-19 04:06 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I fought hard for that and actually won

[13-May-19 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Cant say I had to KYC, but I had to physically go there a few times, so they know who I am.

[13-May-19 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
DC wouldnt take KMD either üò¶

[13-May-19 04:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackjok3r You can still do fine, much fine as compare to hosted servers I guess

[13-May-19 04:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah, I fear though that this node will be very bad once SH is full of better nodes... Hopefully its imporves when I rebuild it in next few weeks.

[13-May-19 04:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
hardware might need update wherever possibly you can. you can still be fine with network and all

[13-May-19 04:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
plus your own updates/mods etc, which you are good at

[13-May-19 04:10 PM] Mylo#8306
SH will be tough.   already top 5 nodes were good.   3 auto-elected from other regions getting in by the looks of it.  blackjok3r also now knows iguana/nota process v.well.... tough region.

[13-May-19 04:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know there is any more imporvemnts to make tbh lol... I think once there are lots more coins, things will be very diffrent.

[13-May-19 04:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
this 3rd season will be different I think.
more management tools and improvements to do as more coins to notarization required

[13-May-19 04:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
improvements regarding scaling

[13-May-19 04:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
more coins, better management tools, more security

[13-May-19 04:14 PM] Strob#3417
And since KMD will moon to 100$ in 2019 all NN op will need navy seal body guards, dogs and machine guns √† la McAfee so get ready!

does anyone know what the color of the cables means on that map?

[13-May-19 04:33 PM] phm87#7395
About how to enhance pings in the SH region, I wrote one idea (to discuss) inside my proposal : in addition to the NN server, have 1 node in SH with all assetchains, similar setup in AR and a private high speed connection between the 2 (vRack of ovh). I already used this technique to support some coin networks. The aim is to have a very tiny ping between AR and SH in order to enhance whole SH region connectivity. I have other ideas. (I won't do anything without community approval)

[13-May-19 04:37 PM] phm87#7395
I discussed this idea with @metaphilibert . Idea can be good if it helps everybody. Idea is not good if it helps only my (possible future) NN. The aim is to help whole SH region to enhance connectivity of whole network

[13-May-19 04:38 PM] Mylo#8306
dwy also is interested in vrack - but if all SH is competing with SH, everyone is equally disadvantaged in SH

[13-May-19 04:39 PM] Mylo#8306
added a lot of cost :abusedsmily:

[13-May-19 04:39 PM] jeezy#3408
@webworker01   can you link that map?

[13-May-19 04:39 PM] CHMEX#0686

[13-May-19 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not nessarily... But if say all nodes are in Sydney like this year,  and one of them has a faster link to other major clusters of nodes if helps only nodes closer to those nodes.

[13-May-19 04:43 PM] SHossain#0007

but 100ms vs 10 ms, wont make a difference
notarizations have a few second "clock" cycle
```

[13-May-19 04:44 PM] phm87#7395
I know vRack prices as I am using it since a year

[13-May-19 04:44 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you for your comments and ideas. I will discuss with dwy

[13-May-19 04:44 PM] phm87#7395
I heard that pings from Sydney to Europe can be 300 ms

[13-May-19 04:45 PM] phm87#7395
NA to EU : I had sth about 150 ms without vrack but about 20 ms with vrack (I don t remember exact numbers)

[13-May-19 04:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its pings to other nodes... an average of your pings to actual nodes youa re conencted to would be the best metric. Its not that ping affects it directly.. its just that some nodes decide on their recvmask too fast.

[13-May-19 04:46 PM] phm87#7395
About prices there is the 10Mbps vrack that is cheaper

[13-May-19 04:46 PM] SHossain#0007
Singapore to EU has about 180ms

[13-May-19 04:46 PM] phm87#7395
I found an elected NN who is interested about this (he may help about costs)

[13-May-19 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my node in Perth is between 50ms and over 550ms to some nodes... Unless it had a totally clean wallet, it never competed last season. Now other nodes can do that... who knows what will happen.

[13-May-19 04:47 PM] phm87#7395
I am happy that this idea is not that bad

[13-May-19 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there will be a solution in software if indeed its a problem... Maybe someone can make a script that calcualtes average pings  to the IPs listed in iguana?

[13-May-19 04:48 PM] phm87#7395
@blackjok3r  an excel sheet was shared above

[13-May-19 04:48 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you @Strob

[13-May-19 04:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, be I guess he used the IPs in github.

[13-May-19 04:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Mine is not on it.

[13-May-19 04:49 PM] phm87#7395
Yeah I understand what you mean

[13-May-19 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana has an RPC, so a script that can calcualte average pings tot he nodes who repond from that list, would be ideal

[13-May-19 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
each node can run this... and we have a definitate answer to weather ping corrleates to counts.

[13-May-19 04:51 PM] phm87#7395
So by any means, if I am able to have a very tiny ping between Sydney and AR (and EU maybe with a third server), I think it can enhance whole network. Is it correct ? (When we did this vRack thing, we had to do other tricks, I will share details about coin config later)

[13-May-19 04:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should help. but without something to compare with its a lot of money to spend. 
Thats it. Take the IPs and ping each one after checking the iguana port is open.

[13-May-19 04:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then average them. I think that will give enough info if we get half the ndoes to run it for a week or something.

[13-May-19 04:53 PM] Mylo#8306
i'm blocking icmp packets from NNs this week coincidentally to see if my notaz go up :troll_compadre:

[13-May-19 04:54 PM] Mylo#8306
why are we trying to solve SH connectivity?

[13-May-19 04:55 PM] Mylo#8306
within SH nodes, the field is level

[13-May-19 04:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not exactly Mylo

[13-May-19 04:55 PM] phm87#7395
@Deleted User I don't have all answers but I think that intelligence of community can lead to good solutions

[13-May-19 04:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
only because they were all in sydney

[13-May-19 04:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If someone doesnt make that script I will try to make it this week.

[13-May-19 04:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if ping times correlate to counts, then we can go from there. So far there is no actual proof just anecdotal evidence

[13-May-19 04:56 PM] phm87#7395
Emmanuel : nice remarks, I will write them down somewhere. Thank you

[13-May-19 04:56 PM] Mylo#8306
fullmoon was in colombia.  1st in SH.

[13-May-19 04:56 PM] Mylo#8306
closer to NA & arguably EU

[13-May-19 04:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
patchkez was in Brazil also

[13-May-19 04:57 PM] phm87#7395
Mylo as you said "closer to NA & arguably EU"

[13-May-19 04:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just going around in circles until we actually measure it though :troll:

[13-May-19 04:57 PM] Mylo#8306
SH is a huge region geographically

[13-May-19 04:58 PM] phm87#7395
Yes

nice that would ahve taken me hours ü§£ ... 
Although saving and averaging them is likely the hardest.
