only BEER chain has that 0 output if I'm not mistaken

[13-Apr-19 08:50 PM] PHBA2061#2530
it seems the last BEER block was 1 hour ago (because they are on-demand chain)

{Reactions}
😦 

[13-Apr-19 08:50 PM] PHBA2061#2530
so there was no notarization

[13-Apr-19 08:50 PM] phm87#7395
yes I don't have this pb on PIZZA and others

[13-Apr-19 08:51 PM] kolo#1111
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 
> if a "notary node team" is 2 people, can they each control one notary node per region and the "team" have one, giving them 3?
Answer is no. Each personality should have access to at max 1 node per region. Having access to more nodes affects general stability and safety - resons why there are 64 nodes and not 3, and why 4 different regions.

[13-Apr-19 08:52 PM] kolo#1111
Obviously in anonymous nature of KMD it's not fully controllable thing, but we try

[13-Apr-19 08:52 PM] phm87#7395
I discussed the question of how many nodes per operator in private with metaphilibert and as many NN op are anonymous, we don't know if several nicknames are not the same guy

[13-Apr-19 08:53 PM] phm87#7395
few ppl are not hidden behind a nickname so it is nearly impossible to be sure (no KYC when we submit a proposal)

[13-Apr-19 08:53 PM] phm87#7395
@kolo  I agree with you

[13-Apr-19 08:54 PM] kolo#1111
It's same with all other edge cases rules. We only try to monitor those to be fair.

[13-Apr-19 08:54 PM] phm87#7395
@kolo  do you know what is happening on BEER ? We liked to notarize it ... Can we push the chain a little bit to continue the testnet game ?

[13-Apr-19 08:54 PM] PHBA2061#2530
they're on demand chain

[13-Apr-19 08:54 PM] phm87#7395
beer on demand ? Cool ^^

[13-Apr-19 08:54 PM] PHBA2061#2530
which means no transactions = no blocks

[13-Apr-19 08:56 PM] PHBA2061#2530
so someone has to send a transaction in order for blocks to be produced

[13-Apr-19 08:56 PM] phm87#7395
ok thank you

[13-Apr-19 08:56 PM] phm87#7395
I though that someone was running a script for it but maybe I am confused with sth else

[13-Apr-19 08:58 PM] phm87#7395
I created a new addy then I sent some to it:
``./komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER sendtoaddress RFrBzHNmVBifnaVjapu5BibuhsCMSvpVoa 0.1
8b1960b37bb03b6f07eaba0b9e40896f2475412fc74324c1827a8040fd7a048e``

[13-Apr-19 08:58 PM] phm87#7395
I should set up another node and run a script to send beer to myself

[13-Apr-19 08:58 PM] phm87#7395
thank you for the explanations

[13-Apr-19 08:59 PM] PHBA2061#2530
... and we just had a new block

[13-Apr-19 08:59 PM] PHBA2061#2530
you're welcome 😃

[13-Apr-19 09:07 PM] SHossain#0007
my BEER tx gen node ran out of funds. sending more to get it started again

[13-Apr-19 09:10 PM] zatJUM#9924
I think I have a problem similar to @newvulcan  ```./m_notary_testnet: xmalloc: .././braces.c:802: cannot allocate 1090 bytes (12044419072 bytes allocated)```

[13-Apr-19 09:10 PM] zatJUM#9924

[13-Apr-19 09:12 PM] zatJUM#9924
iguana dies, that's why I have no nota for hours

[13-Apr-19 09:13 PM] phm87#7395
@SHossain  thank you

[13-Apr-19 09:13 PM] SHossain#0007
now i see the funds are there. something else may have happened

[13-Apr-19 09:15 PM] SHossain#0007
BEER daemon was showing `"balance": 0.00000000,`
after sending 10 BEER, now it shows `"balance": 22.34075000,`

[13-Apr-19 09:16 PM] zatJUM#9924
I had this problem too after having imported privkey without rescan

[13-Apr-19 09:16 PM] phm87#7395
same for me

[13-Apr-19 09:17 PM] phm87#7395
but I made a tx to myself from another node on the same wallet and it was fine

[13-Apr-19 09:18 PM] SHossain#0007
that system has been running tx gen for some time now

[13-Apr-19 09:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has said 10 times how to not have that be a thing and wonders why no one has done what he said 🤔_

Bedtime with my little ones is give me pause for thought, so I'm going to ponder if I have done something daft somewhere, and while I'm doing that, I going to run a memory check, just to discount the possibility I might have a hardware issue, 'cause if it is, I can pass that to my DC to fix.

[13-Apr-19 09:39 PM] newvulcan#4719
Oh and yes, I am using the repo from Alrighttt

[13-Apr-19 09:39 PM] phm87#7395
@newvulcan  did you check the other points ? Tu be synced ? To see a balance in the getinfo of kmd and each AC ?

[13-Apr-19 09:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
that's to do with iguana

[13-Apr-19 09:42 PM] zatJUM#9924
iguana dies just after adding ```NN_CONNECT to (tcp://151.236.216.101:17711)
{"result":"notary node added","tag":"15631962035417622044"}```

[13-Apr-19 09:42 PM] newvulcan#4719
Yep, everything sync'd up properly - no errors in any of the daemon logs. Even checked my partition spaces to make sure I haven't run out of space. It's going to be something in plain sight, I know it is.

[13-Apr-19 09:44 PM] phm87#7395
what is your OS and OS version ?

[13-Apr-19 09:44 PM] zatJUM#9924
Debian 9 for me

[13-Apr-19 09:44 PM] phm87#7395
ubuntu server 16.04 for me

[13-Apr-19 09:45 PM] newvulcan#4719
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

[13-Apr-19 09:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
can one of you do `grep -Rn "braces.c" 2019NNtestnet/`

[13-Apr-19 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has a node perma-mining BEER PIZZA & TXSCLCC for the remainder of the testnet_

[13-Apr-19 09:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
i wonder if alright or shossain broke it on purpose 🤔

[13-Apr-19 09:48 PM] zatJUM#9924
`grep -Rn "braces.c" 2019NNtestnet/` returns nothing

[13-Apr-19 09:48 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
That won't do anything if there are no transactions on BEER Genie

[13-Apr-19 09:48 PM] newvulcan#4719
Did that from my top directory and returned nothing too

[13-Apr-19 09:48 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
That has been the problem, the tx generator stopped and there were no blocks going through

[13-Apr-19 09:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not "on purpose", there's "rules" and then there's "**rules**"

[13-Apr-19 09:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@NutellaLicka 👆🏽 you're correct and wrong at the same time

[13-Apr-19 09:49 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Classic

[13-Apr-19 09:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
`find 2019NNtestnet -name "braces.c"`

[13-Apr-19 09:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
needless to say u need to be in the folder where 2019NNtestnet is

[13-Apr-19 09:50 PM] zatJUM#9924
I looked for it with `find` but nothing

[13-Apr-19 09:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
has anyone looked in m_notary_testner

[13-Apr-19 09:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
make sure there's no mem guzzling loop?

[13-Apr-19 09:51 PM] phm87#7395
@SHossain  can you share your tx gen for Beer to keep the chain moving ?

[13-Apr-19 09:52 PM] SHossain#0007
`*/2 * * * * /home/user/komodo/src/komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER sendtoaddress RBffb7xN4xnqwCCSYbtNw6gmVvzw9Dxaf7 0.0001 "" "" true >/dev/null 2>&1`

[13-Apr-19 09:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_saves 0.0001 every 2 minutes and does not that_

[13-Apr-19 09:53 PM] newvulcan#4719
I've just installed and set up locate on my server, should help in locating files.

[13-Apr-19 09:53 PM] phm87#7395
Thanks. I already use such a rpc call. I imagined sth else

[13-Apr-19 09:53 PM] newvulcan#4719
Not finding a braces.c file unfortunately

[13-Apr-19 09:54 PM] SHossain#0007
on demand chains needs txs in mempool for miners to mine a block.

Just out of curiosity, can I ask you guys why almost no one put a picture of himself in their proposal? lol! Only me, Lukechilds and Jackson.

@SHossain I see only your cpu and yes a very little thumbnail for your github account

[13-Apr-19 10:02 PM] zatJUM#9924
Edit m_notary_testnet and look at all the lines that look like this:```curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"iguana\",\"method\":\"addnotary\",\"ipaddr\":\"51.83.3.85\"}"```
You'll see some of them lack an "\\"  at the end, right after the IP
