yes. it looks alright

[18-Jul-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> yes, i get it, it's just taking to long to start.

[18-Jul-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> *too

[18-Jul-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> Thanks, I'll wait and see if it loads.

[18-Jul-18 09:29 PM] SHossain#0007
it already started. `READY for  RPC calls`

[18-Jul-18 09:29 PM] SHossain#0007
check your debug.log

[18-Jul-18 09:29 PM] SHossain#0007
`tail -f ~/.komodo/debug.log`

[18-Jul-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> Thanks, SHossain, true, it's syncing now.

[18-Jul-18 11:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The start/load time recently increased because it checking the txids of each notarization against the btc deamon, assetchains are now checking theirs against kmd deamon if your running with a notary pubkey

[19-Jul-18 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <mylo5ha5:matrix.org> Have any notaries here connected iguana to btc in regtest mode?

For what reason?

[19-Jul-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <mylo5ha5:matrix.org> new feature testing of kmd stuff, and to simulate nn network in general (if it's possible)

[19-Jul-18 01:15 AM] Mylo#8306
man my btc ntz suck compared to AC.  i have the exact opposite problem to you blackjok3r

[19-Jul-18 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well before the AC/BTC ratio was changed on the stats website... it was rated only on BTC, so I kept optimizing by trial and error to get more BTC.

[19-Jul-18 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am almost 100% sure now, that AC is because of MoM stuff.... but I have an idea to increase AC counts...

[19-Jul-18 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Without needing to upgrade my hardware

[19-Jul-18 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Need to mine all the AC blocks, so I get all the blocks first. ðŸ˜„

[19-Jul-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... BTC was always stated to be counted higher

[19-Jul-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so seemed to be best idea to aim for that anyway... and it turns out, KMD->BTC and GAME->KMD are the best places for old hardware to go looking for higher counts, as they cant leverage hardware SHA256 instructions like others are using to calculate MoM data.

[19-Jul-18 01:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although MoM is calculated from the KMD deamon  so maybe this has no effect at all ðŸ¤”

I cant see why it wouldnt be, just change the BTC_7776 file to point at the regtest RPC port.

[19-Jul-18 01:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless the BTC regtest mode has a diffrent magic value and other things.

[21-Jul-18 07:29 AM] CHMEX#0686
looks like CHAIN did not notarize on the 20th is that ok? @jorian  @siu - Chainmakers

[21-Jul-18 07:29 AM] CHMEX#0686
chain.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RXL3YXG2ceaB6C5hfJcN4fvmLH2C34knhA     last notarization

[21-Jul-18 07:32 AM] CHMEX#0686
ok I see must be because that last trx on the chain was a notarization.  So nothing changed since than.

Added SEC here, not sure if it needs the latest DEV, which I cant compile, so I used the last commit with CC in it, that I can from DEV branch. Its synced just fine. I also noticed that in assetchains.old its has ac_cc=333 in it, but there is not anything for that in standard assetchains. 
I think in the next few days I will test out @lukechilds  JSON, as that will remove such issues from happening.

[25-Jul-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> SEC or DSEC?

[25-Jul-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
SEC\

[25-Jul-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> is it new?

[25-Jul-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> I missed the announcement.

[25-Jul-18 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no announcemtn

[25-Jul-18 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was just aded to the code... I am just testing if we need newest dev for it or not

[25-Jul-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because half of us cant compile it on debian9it needs GCC5.

[25-Jul-18 03:47 AM] cipi#4502
then you have all compilers and can switch between them with the last command -> problem solved

[25-Jul-18 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks ðŸ˜„

[25-Jul-18 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that helps a lot

[25-Jul-18 03:56 AM] Mylo#8306
Pinned a message.

[25-Jul-18 03:56 AM] cipi#4502
hmmm, just saw that gcc-5 is not in debian stable repo any more... only in sid... looks like they started to remove ancient stuff

[25-Jul-18 04:01 AM] cipi#4502
the above will work though, if you have the compilers installed, regardless of their source... but best is to fix this... gcc > 5 is much stricter when dealing with warnings, many things where gcc-5 was showing a warning are now treated as errors... if you know how, you can alter the behavior, but that would need you to pass some additional compiler settings

[25-Jul-18 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
damn...  well I will stay on the comit I am on, and mine SEC and see if it forks I guess.

[25-Jul-18 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have CC in this commit, so it should be ok.

[25-Jul-18 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
is anybody seeing checkqueue.h:189 error with the latest dev branch?

[25-Jul-18 09:48 AM] SHossain#0007
I'm using @cipi's solution. compiled the latest dev branch in both of my mining node. will keep an eye on it.

[25-Jul-18 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That doesn't work on debian9 sadly ðŸ˜¦ GCC5 was removed from that.

[25-Jul-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
notary mining was indeed broken, but I fixed it

[25-Jul-18 12:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
Do we need to update `komodod` to keep mining running smoothly?

[25-Jul-18 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
no, there was one version updated to dev branch with a bug

[25-Jul-18 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
since been fixed

[25-Jul-18 12:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
cool, I haven't rebuilt KMD in a while so should be good ðŸ‘Œ

[25-Jul-18 02:14 PM] libscott#8867
Hi all, is anyone unable to compile dev branch using a later gcc?

[25-Jul-18 02:14 PM] libscott#8867
@blackjok3r

[25-Jul-18 02:14 PM] libscott#8867
im trying to reproduce

[25-Jul-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can test it for you if you want yes

[25-Jul-18 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@libscott

[25-Jul-18 02:18 PM] libscott#8867
@blackjok3r what gcc version are you using thats failing?

[25-Jul-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
6.3 I think it is, on debian 9. I also tried 7.3 on my local computer and that failed with the same errors.

[25-Jul-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to use 5.3 on Ubuntu 16.04 then copy the compiled komodod to my debian9 system, which is working without errors

[25-Jul-18 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
gcc version 6.3.0 20170516 (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1)

[25-Jul-18 03:14 PM] libscott#8867
hi @blackjok3r Can you try building from dev? PR just merged to fix

[25-Jul-18 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sure

[25-Jul-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@libscott Built just fine. Thanks

[25-Jul-18 03:20 PM] libscott#8867

[25-Jul-18 03:20 PM] libscott#8867

no worries.

48 years and 218 days since last notarization!  Looks like SEC is stuck.

Could we use this as a testing ground for the JSON PR?

[26-Jul-18 07:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
I can fix the merge conflicts and add SEC

[26-Jul-18 07:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
and then people could _carefully_ and _slowly_ update and make sure everything is ok

[26-Jul-18 07:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm sure it is

[26-Jul-18 07:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
I've done lots of testing

[26-Jul-18 07:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
but would feel better with everyone knowing there are changes

[26-Jul-18 07:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
than just merging the PR and YOLOing it on the next update

[26-Jul-18 07:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am keen to move to it. Going to run some scale test stuff soon, then i will merge yours in and start redoing my scripts using the JSON format. Could take a few days to get through it as my folder is hell of a mess with everything I have been messing around with.

[26-Jul-18 07:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
I have my own scripts with an identical JSON file to the PR copy/pasted locally and it's working fine

[26-Jul-18 07:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c merge time? ðŸŽ‰

[26-Jul-18 07:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
(or maybe after @blackjok3r has done his tests)

[26-Jul-18 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
just let me know when to merge

[26-Jul-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will be using the assetchains to launch and have a simple script to extract all coin names, and build a coinlist file so its compatible to all of old scripts at first... so just go ahead and merge it.

[26-Jul-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the replacement scripts you made all work, then it will be fine.
