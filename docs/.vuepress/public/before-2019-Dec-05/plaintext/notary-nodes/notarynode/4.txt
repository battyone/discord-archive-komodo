Hey @webworker01 what‚Äôs up with pioneers ranking?  And libscott to 15?

[25-Jun-18 08:32 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok thanks

[25-Jun-18 08:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
woop woop, I'm now nipping at your heels @hyperDEX

[25-Jun-18 08:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
What's the criteria for automatic re-election?

[25-Jun-18 08:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
top 8?

[25-Jun-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Top 7 I think was said... Gonna be super hard for a-team to make it now. With BTC as the only count we were gaining nicely, but at expense of AC notarizations. Really done all I can to get us where we are, theres nothing else left apart from moving next  door to a top node in the physical world.

[25-Jun-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <lukechilds> Just because you don‚Äôt get automatically re-elected doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt get re-elected by the community.
Lots of people are happy with your work on scaling.

[25-Jun-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am sure we will keep our spot regardless, getting top counts is not the be all and end all, but that is the main job. As I said early on as long as our node is working, if other nodes stop its picking up the slack, thats just much an important job as being a top node.

[25-Jun-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If we were down the bottom because the node was not working, thats a different story.

Are elections annual or bi-annual?

[25-Jun-18 09:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
@webworker01 I think this may have been discussed before but is there a reason 0dev4_decker is listed under AR and not dev?

[25-Jun-18 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ca_333's node got moved to dev

[25-Jun-18 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181

@blackjok3r  last year was 30 with more notarizations combined. I don't know if change this year.

[25-Jun-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its been split to top per region, instead of over all top.

[25-Jun-18 01:26 PM] titomane#3101
Maybe someone can confirm which method will use. @kolo

[25-Jun-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
by region

[25-Jun-18 01:31 PM] titomane#3101
7 per region is 28

[25-Jun-18 01:31 PM] titomane#3101
+2 better 8th?

[25-Jun-18 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
top half of each region

[25-Jun-18 01:34 PM] titomane#3101
If region was 13 = 6 or 7 reflected

[25-Jun-18 01:37 PM] titomane#3101
EU 13 = 6-7
NA 14= 7
AR 14= 7
SH 15= 7-8
Min 27
Max 29

[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> 1btc : 3ac? does it mean that ac now is more important than btc?

[25-Jun-18 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
other way around

[25-Jun-18 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1 btc is worth 3 ac

[25-Jun-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> oh, ok

[25-Jun-18 03:25 PM] lukechilds#2707
@titomane AR has 15

[25-Jun-18 04:18 PM] titomane#3101
15- dev decker 14

[25-Jun-18 04:51 PM] kolo#1111
We cut top 32 performers and than checked which region they are, so we knew how many spots in each region left.

[25-Jun-18 04:51 PM] kolo#1111
And those were from elections

[25-Jun-18 04:52 PM] kolo#1111
Actual half is 30, since my nodes were also there up, I just renamed them to dev, so we ended up with 30 nodes re-elected and 30 on election basis.

[25-Jun-18 04:53 PM] kolo#1111
Next elections will be feb 2019, until than or until something terrible happens you will by my fellow notaries üòÉ

[25-Jun-18 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> ive tried everything i know of to accelerate my notarizations... still no noticeable differences

@Decker made some success

[25-Jun-18 05:08 PM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers ask @Deleted User or @jeezy as well. they are smashing it. at this rate, both of them will take over me in ranking i guess in a month or two

[25-Jun-18 05:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[25-Jun-18 05:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
@SHossain I hope. But at the same time I don t as I see your AR node as an objective ^^

[25-Jun-18 05:15 PM] SHossain#0007
keep up your node like this, and it will take over mine. then, we all have to set your node as an objective üòÑ

[25-Jun-18 05:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what is not notarizing often is btc

[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> so, i got my Insight explorer to work, but it doesn't show the blocks for some reason: http://167.99.209.41:3001/blocks

[26-Jun-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> keeps loading

[26-Jun-18 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
restart the komodod deamon with -reindex witout turning the explorer off.

[26-Jun-18 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or leave the explorer running, and then resync komodo from scratch, thats faster than reindex

[26-Jun-18 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> hummm, thanks, will try

[26-Jun-18 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
