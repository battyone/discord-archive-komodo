speaking of which, are the 2 Dice smart contracts in this document available on TXSCLCC ? I run the command  `komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC dicelist` but don't see any in return https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l0dWEPcrv9zE11_TD-XrX_HIYV0VLpadCJN6hvaZERc/edit#gid=211514340

[25-Apr-19 09:57 PM] NNoperator#3835
I've noticed some testnet splitting transactions that are producing as few as 2 UTXOs, that is really taking it to crazy extremes.   If your node happens to notarize that transaction, you consume half of your splits, not to mention the other 6 (or 12 UTXOs for mainnet) that also go into the notarization.   
 https://beer.kmdexplorer.io/tx/c18452e6ffd5754ed9a9a0e047505f5655d8eca18155975bd2af3c54b552afdf

[25-Apr-19 10:01 PM] NNoperator#3835
maybe it is OK for BEER as it is crazy active, and there will be tons of other transactions going along with the ride.  But if you roll that way with other less active coins, it isn't going to be sustainable.  So make sure you at least get a case of BEER if you are going to do a BEER run!üçª

[25-Apr-19 10:10 PM] NNoperator#3835
We are still doubly notarizing BEER !  Drunk nodes on the sloshy network.

[25-Apr-19 10:24 PM] NNoperator#3835
Here is an example notarization, where one operator consumed 1/2 of his split, and another operator consumed 1/3 of his split.  It may be helpful notarizing your own splits to stay at the top of the testnet stats, but it isn't behavior that is sustainable or good for the network.  https://beer.kmdexplorer.io/block/003077717db0765d6a841be37c969be022dfa6e54b6ab7c4d12e60fd00e56bb8

Why not wait until 1/2 way through the campaign to change your campaign?

[25-Apr-19 10:37 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Are you being facetious? If so, It is a normal process for people to make commitments during campaigns (speaking generally in reference to government type elections)
So I dont see why there is any problem with that?

[25-Apr-19 10:38 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`Here is an example notarization, where one operator consumed 1/2 of his split, and another operator consumed 1/3 of his split.`
@NNoperator I'm not sure what tx you meant to link, because the one you linked there is a block with a notarization and no splits

-------------------------------
`Are you being facetious?`
yes
`So I dont see why there is any problem with that?`
because you're "commitments during campaigns " are held up by a 3rd party and no one knows about them

[25-Apr-19 10:40 PM] NNoperator#3835
I was showing the notarization that consumed the splits that were just a few minutes before said notarization.

[25-Apr-19 10:40 PM] NNoperator#3835
I didn't claim that they would be simultaneous

minimal split of 20 to 50 utxos should be imposed on main NN

`We are still doubly notarizing BEER !`
also, that 2 txes are in the same block isn't really "doubly notarizing"
if you look at the ops, they are different and miner lag could account for that

I don't think being concerned over potential waste is "uppity", and I am not sure how empty blocks being mined costs me coinage ? But feel free to let us know if you did the math correctly to see burning 13 UTXOs can be costly for a 1 UTXO split.

On mainnet is there anything preventing NN from one region to be all in the same data center?

[25-Apr-19 11:47 PM] Strob#3417
Thank you! I don't think it's a good idea to get all in the same DC (and I say that as a Komodo investor). I'm close to Beauharnois by the way but still more than a 100 km away so far enough I think. I'm still surprised that NN in the same datacenter (or same region) don't get much higher in the stats rank if I compare to what I can see on this testnet.
