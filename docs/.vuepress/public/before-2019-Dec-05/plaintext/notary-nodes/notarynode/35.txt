Nvme advised

[18-Feb-19 05:06 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
'2 x L5640'

[18-Feb-19 05:06 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
outbound bandwidth ~ per month needed ?

[18-Feb-19 05:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
100mb is ok

[18-Feb-19 05:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
You need hardcore bw for initial sync

[18-Feb-19 05:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Btw I absolutely didn t want to interrupt @Deleted User

[18-Feb-19 05:08 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
1TB ssd

[18-Feb-19 05:08 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
need for raid?

[18-Feb-19 05:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
A question and consideration that is absolutely not official at all and can t be used as a base but... maybe NN will have to handle multiple servers next year

[18-Feb-19 05:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Don t focus on a specific setup

[18-Feb-19 05:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
That s just a pure hypothetical maybe popping out of my head. But it can happen. In fact they ll have to size things to be able to handle 1 year of operating

[18-Feb-19 05:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
And depending on predictions, and tech status,  even 1tb could not be enough, or technical infrastructure may force NN to operate on multiple servers

[18-Feb-19 05:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Things will be announced, but in any case I think some current NN may push for a different infrastructure

[18-Feb-19 05:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
(And if we have the ability to gather opinions, I ll personnally vote for a multi server setup)

[18-Feb-19 05:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. You can also find some 1.92tb nvme for low prices on some providers

[18-Feb-19 05:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
(About your question : 1tb will be the minimum imo)

[18-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
And preferably on a raid1 (i have some servers running on raid0 to get cheaper prices but it s not advised at all on a production server)

[18-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Raid1 being the strict minimum

[18-Feb-19 05:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[18-Feb-19 05:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Another advantage of some providers is an embedded anti ddos

[18-Feb-19 05:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Compared to a home solution

[18-Feb-19 05:36 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
if anti DDOS not baked in worth adding as extra?

[18-Feb-19 05:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
wouldn t refuse it, but that s just me

[18-Feb-19 05:38 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
no way to handle ddos without monthly fee, perhaps with fail2ban.. somehting like this ?

[18-Feb-19 05:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
yup

[18-Feb-19 05:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
sorry, 'yup' I can handle ddos adequately on my own ? no need to add $50 per month to hosting plan ?

[18-Feb-19 05:43 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[18-Feb-19 05:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
see, different opinions ^^

[18-Feb-19 05:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
think I best just pay for 1 month to start üòÇ

[18-Feb-19 05:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
make sure this thing can cope..

[18-Feb-19 05:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
yup, maybe decker

[18-Feb-19 05:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
start of season

[18-Feb-19 05:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
don t remember clearly

[18-Feb-19 07:35 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
looks like a NN already in / near Dallas

[18-Feb-19 07:35 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
best opportunity I've found so far is to launch one there as well.. this a problem ?

[18-Feb-19 07:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Don't want to back myself into corner here.. I am US resident, if US and close proximity to existing NN in Texas isn't lame / redundant to a fault then I think I'm about to pull the trigger on this hosting plan

[18-Feb-19 07:47 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
of course it looks like there are 11 in Montreal

[18-Feb-19 08:10 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
will this NN dedicated server only need to have a single IP assigned to it ?

[18-Feb-19 08:10 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
any reason there would ever need to be more than 1 IP ?

[18-Feb-19 08:17 PM] ca333#0118
one IP is normally enough

[18-Feb-19 08:18 PM] ca333#0118
you could consider using a floating IP setup if you plan to use more than 1 server for your NN (e.g. one backup node) - but at the current level of dPoW and the global NN cyberthreats its not necessary (yet).

[18-Feb-19 08:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
cool

[18-Feb-19 08:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Will start with just 1 IP

[18-Feb-19 10:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[18-Feb-19 10:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[18-Feb-19 10:18 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[18-Feb-19 10:18 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
NOW they email me

[18-Feb-19 10:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
this has happened to me twice now

[18-Feb-19 10:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
two different hosts

[18-Feb-19 10:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
this sucks

[18-Feb-19 10:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It happened to dwy I think too

[18-Feb-19 10:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean my place met me in person a few times so its not like I'm anoyn but they didn't give any fucks to whatbi was doing with the server there, just wanted my money.

[18-Feb-19 10:36 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
gonna try to talk to these people...

So they just banned me lol

[18-Feb-19 11:24 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
vpsserver.com booted me after a VPN login and I wouldnt give up my ID

[18-Feb-19 11:24 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
like 6 months into 1 year plan.

[18-Feb-19 11:24 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
they still are charging / withdrawing from my deposited funds while my server instances remain frozen

[18-Feb-19 11:25 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
just a couple months worth left in there now. they still send me 'how are we doing' surveys even after i've gone in pretty deep with what a letdown they are

Hi, I am looking for a minimal server install and was wondering what most NNs are using?
I found this one `https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD`.
I'd appreciate any advice on finding something.

[20-Feb-19 11:08 AM] SHossain#0007
using minimal is good idea

[20-Feb-19 11:12 AM] eclips#1570
Agree, especially when using ipmi

[20-Feb-19 11:12 AM] eclips#1570
Get 16.04 for nn

[20-Feb-19 11:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, I'll use the version above.  Thanks for the help üòÉ

[20-Feb-19 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
18.04 works too BTW. And debian9

[20-Feb-19 02:30 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
when 16.04 just as good for NN as 18.04?

[20-Feb-19 02:35 PM] jorian#4555
i think the majority of NN uses 16.04

[20-Feb-19 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
16.04 is unsupported according to Alright ... like for security updates or something, so I use debian9 from beginning anyway. Use 18 on some test vms works fine.

[20-Feb-19 02:43 PM] jorian#4555
why is it unsupported? it's running just fine

[20-Feb-19 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its just what he told me...

[20-Feb-19 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont even use it. ... so I didnt look more into it

[20-Feb-19 03:12 PM] Alright#0419
not sure what you're talking about @blackjok3r

[20-Feb-19 03:13 PM] Alright#0419
it's still supported, but you should start moving to 18.04

[20-Feb-19 03:24 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I'm setting up NN for first time.. skip to 18.04 though latest guide i have specifies 16.04 as being used?

[20-Feb-19 03:49 PM] eclips#1570
last time i tried 18.XX, i was not able to compile komodo/iguana with gcc shipped with it

[20-Feb-19 03:50 PM] SHossain#0007
18.10?

[20-Feb-19 03:50 PM] SHossain#0007
or 18.04?

[20-Feb-19 03:50 PM] eclips#1570
XX, don't remember

[20-Feb-19 03:53 PM] SHossain#0007
it works on both

[20-Feb-19 03:53 PM] SHossain#0007
18.04 LTS better to use

[20-Feb-19 03:53 PM] SHossain#0007
18.10 uses different gcc version for compiling. still should work
