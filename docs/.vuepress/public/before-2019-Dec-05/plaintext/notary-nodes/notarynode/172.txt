my understanding of it was that iguana was slowed down by having to choose which one

[26-Apr-19 09:57 AM] Alright#0419
that's why I made the daemon only give 1

[26-Apr-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
no need to touch wallet except when doing the listunspent call, which can be done in a totally separate process

[26-Apr-19 09:58 AM] Alright#0419
so I guess that was a waste of time üòÇ

[26-Apr-19 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the gains will not be that signigicant over just runing a reasonable amount of utxo , this is only a problem on KMD where many utxos are used.

[26-Apr-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem is listunspent is slow

[26-Apr-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
so speed it up with a sane caching system

[26-Apr-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
doing the same amount of work and filtering it out is not any faster

This was somethig I was going to investigate at a later date, already thought of ot a while ago. But it changes many things. Would need tonnes of feild testing on a few select nodes.

[26-Apr-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless, changing the dPoW algo to "fix" this is like making PoW algo changes to protect GPU miners

[26-Apr-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
listunspent -> fifo, iguana gets utxo from fifo, refill when fifo empty. this solves all issues about marking, unmarking, etc

[26-Apr-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
utxo are not guaranteed to be spent, doesnt matter

visualize a simple solution before starting to code

[26-Apr-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is very important advice

[26-Apr-19 10:02 AM] Alright#0419
I don't agree with the ASIC resistance comparison

‚è´ 

[26-Apr-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
and if you dont fully understand the problem, then how can you visualize a simple solution to something you dont understand

[26-Apr-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
I'm incentivized to gather as many peers as possible and not share them for example

[26-Apr-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
that's another example of it encouraging bad behavior

[26-Apr-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
dPoW is not byzantine tolerant, it assumes NN are not evil

[26-Apr-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
if this assumption cant be made, then we will indeed need to change things

[26-Apr-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
NN network is designed to be a fully connected network

[26-Apr-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
violation of that is a serious violation

[26-Apr-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
but a single honest node will propagate all the ip to all the other nodes

[26-Apr-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
anybody whose ip is not known to all the other nodes, wont participate in notarizations, so not sure why you are incentivized to not propagate ip

[26-Apr-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
the more nodes that know of your ip, the more other nodes will get it propagated to

[26-Apr-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
if people have an incorrect idea of what helps or what doesnt help, maybe they can conclude doing something that wont help would help them

[26-Apr-19 10:08 AM] Alright#0419
I don't quite understand how peer propagation works.  I assume you send a message saying "hey, can you share some peer IPs with me?". If I'm incentivized to have more peers than the next NN OP, I'm incentivized to respond with ü§∑

[26-Apr-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so you dont understand how it works, yet you use your misunderstanding to support your position that it creates the wrong incentive?

[26-Apr-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
EVERY packet has a random peer ip in it

[26-Apr-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so the more nodes that know your ip, the more likely your ip propagates

[26-Apr-19 10:10 AM] Alright#0419
does that change what I said about incentivize though? Is there no way to "hoard peers"?

[26-Apr-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
how?

[26-Apr-19 10:10 AM] Alright#0419
I'm asking you lol

[26-Apr-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
you could refuse to propagate other peers, but only to peers that know about your ip

[26-Apr-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess if everybody ran the version that didnt propagate peers at all, then there wont be any peer propagation and only the addnode peers would exist

[26-Apr-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
but just one honest node would propagate all the peers to all other peers

[26-Apr-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe you are talking about 2 diffrent things hree, jl is reffering to iguana peering protocol not the daemon.

[26-Apr-19 10:12 AM] Alright#0419
Yes, sorry this is deamon peers

[26-Apr-19 10:12 AM] Alright#0419
what I was talking about

[26-Apr-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so what does it matter, you are eclipse attacking all other NN?

[26-Apr-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
they can connect to the rest of the KMD network

[26-Apr-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
without your node

[26-Apr-19 10:13 AM] Alright#0419
if you can position your node as a kind of "central relay" for blocks, ie you're one hop away from all blocks, your counts do increase. I've tested this.

[26-Apr-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
can you do that and prevent any other node from doing the same?

[26-Apr-19 10:14 AM] Alright#0419
It does make it harder for people to do the same thing, yes

[26-Apr-19 10:14 AM] Alright#0419
because peers normally have 16 max outbound

[26-Apr-19 10:15 AM] Alright#0419
if you take up 1, they're less likely to be able to have that peer as well

[26-Apr-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
that does seem like an optimization that helps a bit due to slightly faster

[26-Apr-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
overall network connectivity is increased a bit

[26-Apr-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
timing issue probably less impact that efficient vs inefficient utxo management

[26-Apr-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
so on a node that is already doing the best utxo management, with good connectivity can get an even extra boost by this

[26-Apr-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
the harm seems to be to other NN only, like somebody doing utxo management better than others

[26-Apr-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
what percentage did your counts increase by?

[26-Apr-19 10:19 AM] Alright#0419
look at early testnet compared to now, I shared my optimizations with everyone üòÇ

[26-Apr-19 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
at scale, maybe what this incentivizes is each NN always running many normal nodes so they have max connectivity to the main network. It seems in that case all NN can have this same advantage and the overall network is much better connected

[26-Apr-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
doesnt feel like apocalypse

[26-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
yes restarting your node kills peer counts

[26-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
it is good in that uptime increasing counts

[26-Apr-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
not if you have your own set of always running nodes

[26-Apr-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
do getpeerinfo on those nodes and issue a bunch of addnode calls

[26-Apr-19 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You should have 2-3 KMD full nodes on your server. Just incase one goes down, the rest still ahve very low latency to 100 peers

[26-Apr-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so what about this requires changing how dPoW algo works??

[26-Apr-19 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This works very well for me, msot of the time.

[26-Apr-19 10:21 AM] Alright#0419
I had a script that would addnode IPs from every chain I had running üòÇ

[26-Apr-19 10:21 AM] Alright#0419
maxed out at about 115 KMD peers after a week or so

[26-Apr-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
and what part of this is overall harmful

[26-Apr-19 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the main trick is not forcing oubound peers, but getting as many inbound as possible, and the trade of is massivly increase network bandwidth which is not free.

[26-Apr-19 10:22 AM] Alright#0419
that part isn't necessarily harmful(although some people say it is, I haven't seen negative effect of it yet)

[26-Apr-19 10:22 AM] Alright#0419
I'm saying I could try to prevent others from doing it by not sharing peer ips

[26-Apr-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so i dont understand the big concern about this

[26-Apr-19 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
it's not a *big* concern

[26-Apr-19 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
your one node not sharing peers wont affect others from getting peers from other nodes

[26-Apr-19 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
damn you misunderstand me, I'm not sitting here screaming FIRE!

[26-Apr-19 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
yes my one node

[26-Apr-19 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
but if NNs see my counts increase because of this, they're more likely to do it as well

[26-Apr-19 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
so?

[26-Apr-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
if they have bandwidth to burn for the incremental gains, why not

[26-Apr-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
earlier you said essentially current dPoW was broken, or at least needed to be changed

[26-Apr-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure the exact words now, but it seemed pretty strong words

[26-Apr-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i find testnet has no regions

[26-Apr-19 10:25 AM] Alright#0419
It's not broken right now, but some aspects of it encourage acting against the best interest of the network. This is my entire point

[26-Apr-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
and daemon connectivity tricks

[26-Apr-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
what aspect encourages acting against the best interest of the network?

[26-Apr-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
that is my entire question

[26-Apr-19 10:26 AM] Alright#0419
not sharing peers, positioning your node as a "central relay"

[26-Apr-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
we just analyzed that extra connectivity is not harmful, and if anything beneficial

[26-Apr-19 10:26 AM] Alright#0419
it's not likely a problem in practical terms, I know this

[26-Apr-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so an uneconomic theoretical issue?

[26-Apr-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
that wont really encourage actions against the best interest of network?

[26-Apr-19 10:27 AM] Alright#0419
is economic as it makes you more likely to get auto-reelected

[26-Apr-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
if there is a significant incentivized harmful issue, it would need to be corrected

[26-Apr-19 10:27 AM] Alright#0419
if *everyone* does it, it would be a real problem

[26-Apr-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
did you not read the part about each NN having to run dedicated connectivity nodes?

[26-Apr-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
plz try to read what I write

[26-Apr-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
since there are only 16 outbound connections, if people didnt run connectivity nodes to create more outbound channels, it would indeed create some asymettric performance advantage, that is unclear how much of a notarization advantage it will be, but we can assume better performance could only help

[26-Apr-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
so if this became an issue, then all NN to compete would be running several or many connectivity nodes

[26-Apr-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
if you extrapolate things beyond just the first step, you will see that overall it helps the network

[26-Apr-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
the temporary advantage for better connected nodes will force others to improve their connectivity

[26-Apr-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
if everybody did this to every chain, we would get a lot better connected networks for all the chains, but this would be cost prohibitive

[26-Apr-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i still dont see any real problem here
