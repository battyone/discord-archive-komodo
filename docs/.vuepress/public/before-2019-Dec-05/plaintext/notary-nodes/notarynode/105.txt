who s launching these ? oO

[08-Apr-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright was going yo do it but the blaster doesn't work with sapling... I woke up too late and don't really know what the problem was, so need to wait for him to come back online to fix the blaster

[08-Apr-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Mean time I'm expanding the get block notarzations RPC to return human readable info in a good format to make counting stats easier

[08-Apr-19 07:52 AM] jeezy#3408
@blackjok3r   is there a script in existence to move  all funds  from old pubkey to new?

[08-Apr-19 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
z-mergetoaddress would work fine... but you may need a rescan first to amke sure no old utxos are left over..

[08-Apr-19 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I havent really been focused ont his yet, we still ahev months until the hard fork from my understanding

btw nearly finished upgrade of `getNotarisationsForBlock` RPC.

[08-Apr-19 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It works on KMD, but needs a full reindex... and right now isnt following any rules... about when something starts or ends by timestamp or anything.

[08-Apr-19 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181

minor things to sortout... need to sperate LABS notarizations from KMD ones. But this should be extremly fast. Just adds a set of int8_t's to the notarizations DB tracking which notary made each notarisation. 
Saves fething every transaction off chain and then checking all vins, which is very slow.

[08-Apr-19 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont think it needs any more info than this tbh... A python script can pull the block range of KMD taht is applicable and tally each ntoaries results

[08-Apr-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it should add blocktimestamp to the JSON also as that determines which notaries are 24, 25, ..

[08-Apr-19 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I may be able to do that...

[08-Apr-19 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I know what you mean... I just figuuired the block range on KMd would be known and we can just loop each block making a tally.

[08-Apr-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a theoretical chance of backwards timestamps just as a notarization at the activation time, so it is rare and if just for info purposes can be ignored. if consensus is affected from this data, then it needs to be precise

[08-Apr-19 08:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this is just for peopel to easily verify who was a top notary to avoid any FUD. 😃

[08-Apr-19 08:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It only an output of on chain data,,, when webworker told me his Notarization tracking data base was 12GB... I knew there was a better soluition so I just started making it

[08-Apr-19 08:53 AM] newvulcan#4719
I'm getting Connection Refused failures when I run .dpowassets at startup. Everything else seems to have executed fine, but when I run netstat -lnp | grep 7776 I don't see iguana listed. I've also run netstat to search for an instance of iguana, just in case I've set it to listen on the wrong port, but its not there. I've searched for ./start_iguana.sh but can't find it. It's probably hiding in plain site, but do you know where it should be ? If I can just sort that, I think I'm good to go 😃

[08-Apr-19 08:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which reopo are you using? start_iguana is from LABS and will no work here

[08-Apr-19 08:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need m_notary_testnet

[08-Apr-19 09:21 AM] newvulcan#4719
Oh I'm being daft, yes of course I'm using m_notary to start. What I've just noticed is that it starts ok, and I have agents/igu listed in netstat, but after I get the INIT with 64 notaries, a few mins later I get "This node is not official notary" and iguana stops

[08-Apr-19 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to add your pubkey to the testnet 🤷 Did you do that?

I heard the attack script needed mods because `sapling` why is that?

[08-Apr-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the transaction format isnt compatible

[08-Apr-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It should be trivial to fix Ithink.. the code is already in iguana/marketmaker

[08-Apr-19 11:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
iguana attacks? I thought it was a cli script

[08-Apr-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that also would have killed the streeamer as taht ewas based off the same code.

[08-Apr-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no its a function inisde marketmaker... Its an attackto break the BTC walelt database

[08-Apr-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you cant use the BTC wallet DB to attack the BTC walelt DB 😂

[08-Apr-19 11:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so its not based on the blaster?

[08-Apr-19 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it is yes, but the blaster uses marketmaker. With a tricky bash script to keep reloading it

actually it would go as fast as iguana, not limited by the BTC wallet speed. we were getting an entirely full blockchain with just one or two txblasters going

[08-Apr-19 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So I made a way of having a chain owned by a key pair, that no body elkse could mine. Which means the owner also has all the coins. 
It used the notary spending of 0.0001 sats to mine a block  and the  enforce that all blocks were mined by that miner. 
Then used the txblaster with 2 threads to feed litterally any data source into a queue that was then blasted into the chain. By setting difficulty to 1, all the time 2s blocks were acheivable.
