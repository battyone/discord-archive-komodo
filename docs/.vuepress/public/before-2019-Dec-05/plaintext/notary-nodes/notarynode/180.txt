Congratulations to all bounty winners. I agree with this list @kolo  well done!

@grewalsatinder  project fund was only 2x 10%  not  ALL mining rewards, we have to pay server and actually kinda live off it,  but we try to give back a little and help others

Seems OP_SHA256 bounty is claimed, my congratz to RFcGrDLnWh1cMiQqMKncFJ6b9cnt8fwKCM whoever he was! Excellent work!

p.s. Post plz your solution / comments / impressions here. 
p.p.s. If nobody posts a solution here, i will do this later by myself.

@Decker hi Decker, I was the one who solved your puzzle (the address above is actually my voting address), thank you, I've learnt a lot, sorry for not mentioning about this earlier because I was too tired after staying up to 5 am in order to solve your puzzle  üòÉ

Awesome! Main purpose of this puzzle was to force people learn something new. So, seems idea was good, i'm glad! Btw, there is an additional extra hint exists on blockchain all of these time. If you will see txes on `bTMf2oY21U63oZD6Yfk1igyp4MjcaEfp8m` you will see, that it already has spent tx  b001d94442f3ce5e38ae845ceaee9a9f5de95370f4e3a5314aa7e8fc714eeb71 from this address. So, users initially have 2 possible variants of solution:

1. Look on the picture, trying to hash `vote4decker` secret and construct a reedem script.
2. Or just look on txes, and copy complete redeem script from tx b001d94442f3ce5e38ae845ceaee9a9f5de95370f4e3a5314aa7e8fc714eeb71 without know a secret and without know how to construct it. Like "monkey copy style" )

Solution: https://komodod.com/t/945b6d970204bf414102a4dfadec8615c09ab48c20d835e77f488bcbd78e4599 

Look at the winner tx and it's scriptSig field:
```0b766f7465346465636b6572aa201b549cfc12bd56569b5d1b73fa5cdda12ca5f681c648328b40445db4f41e15f587```
As it P2SH, scriptSig field contains here redeem script:
```766f7465346465636b6572 OP_HASH256 1b549cfc12bd56569b5d1b73fa5cdda12ca5f681c648328b40445db4f41e15f5 OP_EQUAL```
As you see `766f7465346465636b6572` it's a `vote4decker` in ASCII, that gives you 1b549cfc12bd56569b5d1b73fa5cdda12ca5f681c648328b40445db4f41e15f5 after OP_SHA256. So, two steps for solve needed:
1. Found secret `vote4decker`
2. Construct above redeem script.
3. Make a tx with passing this redeem script to claim the reward.

[30-Apr-19 08:18 AM] PHBA2061#2530
to be honest there are still things I don't completely understand yet, but I think I'll get it soon.
The very first thing I do is searching on google, then I found this and tried to understand how this Bitcoin puzzle works https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Transaction_puzzle (if anyone hasn't, try to reproduce the result, it's harder than you thought üòÉ )
Then back to the puzzle, I already tried to OP_HASH256  `vote4decker`  but it doesn't seem to give the correct answer (may be I was doing it wrong, not sure it's the string that has to be hashed or the string has to be converted to binary value first). I was about to give up after this point
Then I realized there are 3 transactions linked with your address (before I redeem the reward),  so I just used `getrawtransaction` on this one `b001d94442f3ce5e38ae845ceaee9a9f5de95370f4e3a5314aa7e8fc714eeb71` then `decoderawtransaction`, it would then give

So, you used hidden extra hint! That's ok too!

[30-Apr-19 08:21 AM] Decker#3767
About hashing ... you can use this PHP script to understand how it works:
```
<?php

echo "---\n";
$data = "0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003ba3edfd7a7b12b27ac72c3e67768f617fc81bc3888a51323a9fb8aa4b1e5e4a29ab5f49ffff001d1dac2b7c";
$data = bin2hex("vote4decker");
var_dump(strlen(pack("H*", $data)));
var_dump(sprintf("%02X",strlen(pack("H*", $data))));

var_dump(bin2hex(pack("H*", $data)));
$h1 = hash("sha256",pack("H*",$data));
$h2 = hash("sha256",pack("H*",$h1));
echo $h1 . PHP_EOL;
echo $h2 . PHP_EOL;

?>```

OP_SHA256 - it's sha256 double ... (!) ...

[30-Apr-19 08:23 AM] Decker#3767
So, for vote4decker there's following hashes:
```

```

[30-Apr-19 08:23 AM] jorian#4555
ah see, i only hashed things once

[30-Apr-19 08:28 AM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah I know OP_SHA256 is sha256 double , so the 1st hash is just sha256(vote4decker), but you have to convert the 2nd hash to binary value before hashing it right, I thought I have to convert `vote4decker` to binary value too üòÇ

[30-Apr-19 08:29 AM] Decker#3767
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Transaction_puzzle page contains a nice example, result of OP_SHA256 and statement that the secret was Genesis Block. So, we can start with this, to be sure that we correctly understood how actually OP_SHA256 works.

I think I understand almost everything now, except for the `OP_HASH160 <scriptHash> OP_EQUAL` part , how do you generate the `scriptHash` ?

[30-Apr-19 08:42 AM] Decker#3767
decode redeem script and you will get p2sh address corresponding to it.

Hi @Dr.Terminus üëã,
I also had trouble with BEER (and others) with no notas for a day or so.  A total reset and scping the chain in from another server seemed to get it moving again.
Just out of curiosity, how does you inbound traffic look?

[30-Apr-19 10:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

I plan to use some of NN rewards to contribute into CHIPS because love poker. But not sure yet if it will be direct donations or some bounties for devs stimulating and etc
