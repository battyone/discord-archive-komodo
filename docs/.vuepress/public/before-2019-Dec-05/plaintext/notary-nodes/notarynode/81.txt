@Alright , I'm trying it.

[04-Apr-19 08:00 AM] CrisF#3405
My node is not doing anything at the moment though.

[04-Apr-19 08:01 AM] CrisF#3405
TXSCLCC notarisations are showing 0.

```MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS @CHMEX
and if you want a shitload find the sleep right before it asks for more peers
set that much lower
and you'll be asking all of your peers for more peers constantly```    I wonder what effect this has on your server bandwidth  ?  Also will some ISPs view this as DDoS attack  if all our nodes start hammering on each other?

they do it every 2 minutes by default

I wonder if the stats should be based on the notary that finds the block, rather than the one that pays the d_pow fee ... 🤔

[04-Apr-19 09:52 AM] CHMEX#0686
finding a block has not much to do with notarizing

[04-Apr-19 09:54 AM] zatJUM#9924
I have no more nota since last update (just reindexed all assets before)

[04-Apr-19 09:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@zatJUM sometimes they come in waves and sometimes they come in waves of not coming 
the reality is that the more participants there are is the more often there will come times without (which is why someone said early on that no stat under 48hrs matters)

[04-Apr-19 10:03 AM] zatJUM#9924
Thanks CG, at last I had 1 on BEER

[04-Apr-19 10:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
rounding numbers for the sake of conversation, with 20 participants and 7 required to sign there's a 66% likelihood on each notarization that you will *not* be one of the signers 😛

[04-Apr-19 10:08 AM] Lumbi#8378
...or perhaps specify that the notary block finder is given priority in such a way that under normal conditions (perhaps a one minute pay window) the finder would also be the notarizer?

[04-Apr-19 10:10 AM] CHMEX#0686
why should miners be notaries?

[04-Apr-19 10:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Lumbi if you're on about testnet, more than 90% of blocks are found by 
e) none of the above

[04-Apr-19 10:14 AM] Lumbi#8378
to be clear I am referring to the notary miner that is given preferred mining conditions. it seems it would be a bit more intuitive and not advantage faster notaries as the emphasis among notaries would be on distributed security and not speed (once a block is found).

[04-Apr-19 10:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in mainnet, PoW is PoW afaik

[04-Apr-19 10:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
one could argue the relative difference of NN(A) using 5GHz and NN(B) using 3.9GHz; however, even at the "low diff" of NNs, there's a nominal speed difference at that high of a degree of precision

[04-Apr-19 10:24 AM] Lumbi#8378
if we assume all the notaries have sufficient fastness, perhaps randomness could be added to the code so that of the 64 notaries they are chosen randomly and over time equality of notarizations would be achieved regardless of  the speed of the hardware ?

[04-Apr-19 10:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
PoW is, in and of itself, exactly what you're asking for 🤷🏽

[04-Apr-19 10:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw, to add code that "randomly" picks one of the 64 would make it *less* random (not to mention that it would really piss off non-NN miners)

[04-Apr-19 10:35 AM] Lumbi#8378
or when one notary finds a block a second random process is initiated that determines finally which notary notarizes (without hardware advantage, more of a PoS random function that should ultimately lead to equality in numbers of notarizations among the 64 over time).

[04-Apr-19 10:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Either way, you're forcing the outcome and making it *less random* and *more centralized*

[04-Apr-19 10:53 AM] Lumbi#8378
libertarian naysaying is a well known *ad infinitum* 😉

[04-Apr-19 11:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[04-Apr-19 11:01 AM] Lumbi#8378
it's a purity spiral

[04-Apr-19 11:02 AM] Lumbi#8378
if taken to the extreme

[04-Apr-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are notarizing using  nintendo system, you deserve to get less notarizations. why would we change the system to help such NN??

[04-Apr-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
there is nothing wrong with unequal outcomes

[04-Apr-19 11:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`there is nothing wrong with unequal outcomes`
if only more people in the US understood that 🤔

[04-Apr-19 11:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
one cannot have both equal opportunity *and* equal outcome

a refurbished nintendo system would be epic ! 😃  nothing wrong with doing more with less, no? the true metric of a notary is uptime and purity of code...

[04-Apr-19 11:09 AM] Lumbi#8378
"true randomness" keeps me up at night ...

[04-Apr-19 11:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then why suggest a system that is even further away?

[04-Apr-19 11:11 AM] Lumbi#8378
why suggest I'm making such a suggestion? :troll_king:

[04-Apr-19 11:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because you are

[04-Apr-19 11:12 AM] PHBA2061#2530
true randomness can only be generated from a hardware random number generator

[04-Apr-19 11:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you go further away from "true random" when you intentionally effect the outcome to a specific extent

[04-Apr-19 11:12 AM] Lumbi#8378
@PHBA2061 but therein lies the rub.... who built the hardware?

[04-Apr-19 11:16 AM] PHBA2061#2530
not me ofc, but what matters is how it generates rng, for example hrng could generate noise by measuring thermal noise ,or any physical noise

Hello Guys, I have another question

[04-Apr-19 11:22 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
I have been following the configuration guide for the notary node. I am now in the final steps, but when I have to import the private key a doubt comes to my head. Where shoud I look for the private key?

[04-Apr-19 11:23 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
I cannot find the BTCDwif key and the BTCwif key

[04-Apr-19 11:24 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Perhaps should I extract them from iguana? Maybe it is not explained in the guide?

[04-Apr-19 11:24 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Thanks in advance

[04-Apr-19 11:24 AM] SHossain#0007
For testnet you can create an Komodo address and get the private key (WIF key)

mainnet is different and needs more secure setup

[04-Apr-19 11:32 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
And in mainnet, how do I should obtain BTCDwif  and BTCwif  keys to be imported?

[04-Apr-19 11:33 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
I mean, shoud I create a BTC and BTCD wallets on the server?

[04-Apr-19 11:38 AM] SHossain#0007
KMD wif = BTCD wif

[04-Apr-19 11:42 AM] SHossain#0007
for mainnet you should write down 24 words seed phrase in a piece of paper and store it somewhere safe. input that phrase into your notary node by typing (when creating the `wp` file). follow the insctructions for mainnet. when you execute the `./wp` file that will display your BTC WIF, KMD WIF, Pubkkey etc. to use. import those WIF keys into coin daemons.

another way to obtain WIF key is to use Decker's script and use the `compressed` address, key and pubkey https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/How-to-Generate-Address-and-Private-Key-(WIF)-for-3rd-Party-Coins-Using-Passphrase

Decker's script is needed for all 3rd party coins that has different format address and private key

[04-Apr-19 12:01 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
It seems that this is not explained in the tutorial or I am not getting it, sorry. Where should I create the ./wp file and what should be the format of the command line to add the 24 words phrase?

[04-Apr-19 12:03 PM] SHossain#0007
```
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7778" --data "{\"agent\":\"bitcoinrpc\",\"method\":\"encryptwallet\",\"passphrase\":\"insert very secure password here\"}"
```

[04-Apr-19 12:04 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
passphrase = 24 words seed phrase?

[04-Apr-19 12:04 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[04-Apr-19 12:04 PM] SHossain#0007
`\"passphrase\":\"insert very secure password here\"`

you need to change `insert very secure password here` with your 24 words

[04-Apr-19 12:08 PM] SHossain#0007
the mainnet guide is slightly outdated and will be updated in due time. please follow the testnet guide from Alright's repo and participate in testnet if you are interested.

[04-Apr-19 12:12 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
ok, the problem is that I created a random password not in the 24 words format. Now I have a right output with the keys

[04-Apr-19 12:12 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559

[04-Apr-19 12:12 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
According your recommendations I am going to continue my tests in the testnet

@SHossain  Just one question regarding server config.  first general config:  i7-700, 64gb ram, 2x500gb nvme...what do you advise? raid 1 or is raid 0 sufficient?

[04-Apr-19 12:14 PM] SHossain#0007
RAID1 is more secure

[04-Apr-19 12:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[04-Apr-19 12:15 PM] almoche#6700

@SHossain what is the point of using encryptwallet if your WIF is sitting in wp_7776 anyway

[04-Apr-19 01:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
500GB is not enough this season

[04-Apr-19 01:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
unless you delete things very aggressively

[04-Apr-19 01:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
with more asset chains and external coins coming, 1TB for next year is probably what is needed

[04-Apr-19 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`500GB is not enough this season`
indeed true, btc is 1/2 that now

[04-Apr-19 01:29 PM] SHossain#0007
wp_7776 file contains `walletpassphrase` call. which to be used if you use encryptwallet. not sure if these calls are active or not. this came from early version of the guide that Kolo created and I never found an issue following the guide. however, there were few modifications in the setup guide by some members and ops and the guide got messed up a bit.

[04-Apr-19 01:30 PM] SHossain#0007
the original guide stated to copy `btc`, `kmd` file and change the port to 7776 and raname `wp` file to `wp_7776` and change port to 7776

[04-Apr-19 01:30 PM] SHossain#0007
someone changed that part of the guide.

[04-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Strob#3417
there is also a file called passphrase.txt in the iguana directory,  do we still need that?
