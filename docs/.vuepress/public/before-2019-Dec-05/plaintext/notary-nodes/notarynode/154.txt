I'm thinking about the 400 blocks reverted/reorged on ETC and about XVG cases

[17-Apr-19 11:23 PM] phm87#7395
exchanges lost BTC durint the 51% atk on ETC so I'm pretty sure that some investigations happened (made by incompetent police or exchange itself)

[17-Apr-19 11:33 PM] Alexfrog#1338
its not actually longest chain right, its chain with the most cumulative work?

[17-Apr-19 11:34 PM] phm87#7395
I though that notarizations matters somehow (but if you sync an AC without KMD you can't check notas)

[17-Apr-19 11:37 PM] Alexfrog#1338
>yes but it is criminal to corrupt mainet NN operators : investors, community and coin dev will be furious and I'll go to jail with everyone here

This is not the right way to think about it.   A blockchain must be secure against attacks, thats the entire point.  No one should trust something if a bad actor could break it without tremendous difficulty

[17-Apr-19 11:41 PM] Alexfrog#1338
>  I'm thinking about the 400 blocks reverted/reorged on ETC and about XVG cases

This is what KMD DPoW is designed to prevent.  You cannot do a deep chain reorg because some of those blocks got notorized.   Alternately, if no notorizations happened, then you cannot trust that a transaction has been confirmed

[17-Apr-19 11:41 PM] phm87#7395
I agree but mainet coins have a value while testnet coins have no value, I prefer tp test on testnet because it is there for this purpose

[17-Apr-19 11:41 PM] Alexfrog#1338
right, its good to try to attack testnet

[17-Apr-19 11:42 PM] Alexfrog#1338
because if someone finds a flaw then devs can try to fix it so that it doesnt happen on mainnet

[17-Apr-19 11:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it can be criminal to test it on mainet`
Then you might as well cuff me, everything I've ever tested was on a live chain

There's no shortage of irony in bitching that there's no wiki and then doing childish shit on it when someone creates one. 😣

votes are heating up

[18-Apr-19 02:19 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
so, am i imagining things or do notarizations on testnet lead to votes ?

[18-Apr-19 02:23 AM] gt#2812
testnet is a way to show voters that you can work as an nn op

[18-Apr-19 02:24 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
for sure, but I have votes, which fora time seems correlated with testnet notarizations.. am i imagingin things ?

[18-Apr-19 02:28 AM] gt#2812
methinks it could be a case of correlation does not mean causation

`i wasn't expecting him taking it seriously`
I can't imagine what about me would lead you to believe that I wouldn't take something like that seriously, emmanuel
You literally spent 16 hrs droning on about there being "barrier to entry" and I did the best I can do to help that situation.
I'm not sure what about my history in this community would lead you to believe that I *wouldn't* take a project like that seriously.
What really pisses me off is more about the childish action, itself, after giving a place to begin what you asked for than it being aimed at me.
Have you ever submitted a PR to james repo like that? Or is it just personal disrespect towards me? Or was all the droning on just a bunch of you stirring shit with that big ass spoon?

[18-Apr-19 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
even though only 13 signatures are needed, a large majority of NN need to be in sync for the 13 to be chosen. we have seen double notarizations in rare cases when a new hardfork version is partially deployed. this is why it is important to update promptly

[18-Apr-19 07:08 AM] Ludom#5832
It's funny how the votes concentrate on EU region

[18-Apr-19 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
most candidates and most hodlers in EU

[18-Apr-19 07:15 AM] Ludom#5832
Possibly

[18-Apr-19 07:15 AM] Ludom#5832
But I think the competition makes much more competition.

[18-Apr-19 07:16 AM] Ludom#5832
The dynamic was very different last year

[18-Apr-19 07:17 AM] Ludom#5832
And I see a lot of EU people candidate in other region

What do you mean with experiment? The voting process?

[18-Apr-19 07:22 AM] Ludom#5832
All what we are doing in crypto is a big experiment for me

[18-Apr-19 07:23 AM] Ludom#5832
Such decentralized technology make possible new way of life and dynamics in P2P exchange

[18-Apr-19 07:25 AM] Ludom#5832
The voting process to make consensus on a cryptoplatform is new

[18-Apr-19 07:25 AM] Ludom#5832

[18-Apr-19 07:25 AM] Ludom#5832

I'm prety sure about a mass exctinction soon

[18-Apr-19 07:29 AM] Ludom#5832
Now it's the best moment to try and experiment new ways to make P2P system

[18-Apr-19 07:31 AM] Ludom#5832
But sooner or later, the non-adapted models will extinct.

[18-Apr-19 07:34 AM] Ludom#5832
It's just my opinion

[18-Apr-19 07:35 AM] CHMEX#0686
Very good comparison with the cambrian explosion!
Thats what I like about KMD its experimenting with all sorts of p2p systems and building proof of concepts. Does not mean everything will be adapted if only a few components make it in 10 years thats already good for the whole eco system.

[18-Apr-19 07:37 AM] Ludom#5832
Some tech will survive but not the token

[18-Apr-19 07:37 AM] Ludom#5832
And few token will survive because it'll change of tech

[18-Apr-19 07:38 AM] Ludom#5832
My opinion right now is that Bitcoin is the most resilient system

[18-Apr-19 07:39 AM] Ludom#5832
And I really like the way of Komodo to use Bitcoin to be stronger

[18-Apr-19 07:40 AM] Ludom#5832
But what I prefer in Komodo, it's his way to develop itself

[18-Apr-19 07:40 AM] Ludom#5832
