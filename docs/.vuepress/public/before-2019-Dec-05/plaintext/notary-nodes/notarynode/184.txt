`ubuntu is the testing stuff of debian, slightly newer. like the jl777 repo vs komodo repo`
There is no part of that sentence that is accurate

in 2015, ubuntu was based off a snapshot of debian testing.   not sure if it still is true :P
yeah, jl777 stuff is bleeding edge and makes it's way into komodoplatform repo !

[02-May-19 04:27 AM] Mylo#8306
i thought it was always the case, waaay back at debian sid or sarge (i've never used deb) the releases were taking years, so shuttleworth took testing and made ubuntu.   so i read ...

[02-May-19 06:53 AM] jeezy#3408
@kolo  @webworker01  @blackjok3r   do all ntz count towards the ranking system?  even "test/temp chains" like pizza/beer/rick/morty/vote?

[02-May-19 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pizza/beer never got notarized on mainnet. My RPC counts everything that is on a min net notary node and was notarized.

[02-May-19 07:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the script that does it all, is in KMD repo. `notarystats.py` anyone can check it themself.

@Mylo Jokes and bagging on Ubuntu aside, you're mostly kind of right.
At the core, Ubuntu comes from the testing branch of Debian.
But that's where the end of comparing it to anything around here comes.
Ubuntu adds their own software and whatever outside packages they choose and have a fixed 6 month release cycle (even if many know issues exist).
Debian tests and tests and tests and releases with no fixed date and only when it's decided to be as stable as humanly possible under as many conditions as possible.

[02-May-19 11:10 AM] Mylo#8306
Interesting.  Thanks for the info @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I’ll start to test with deb a lot more for -in-a-box stuff

[02-May-19 11:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my personal advice is:
If Ubuntu, always the last Ubuntu not the new Ubuntu.

They want to support 18.04 for the next 10 years
Looks like it's better to update directly to 20.04 because 18.04 have "Hardware and maintenance updates" until 20.04 release

```Ubuntu adds their own software and whatever outside packages they choose and have a fixed 6 month release cycle (even if many know issues exist).``` - it's not mandatory to use releases and they update LTS releases in parallesl so actually there is few years between versions to which you need to update

[02-May-19 11:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

True, but for the average user, `There are updates.` reads as `Hey, you NEED to update!`

BTC 18.0 is out, it breaks more stuff

[02-May-19 11:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
```

- - The `rpcallowip` option can no longer be used to automatically listen
  on all network interfaces.  Instead, the `rpcbind` parameter must be
  used to specify the IP addresses to listen on.  Listening for RPC
  commands over a public network connection is insecure and should be
  disabled, so a warning is now printed if a user selects such a
  configuration.  If you need to expose RPC in order to use a tool like
  Docker, ensure you only bind RPC to your localhost, e.g. `docker run
  [...] -p 127.0.0.1:8332:8332` (this is an extra `:8332` over the
  normal Docker port specification).

- - The `rpcpassword` option now causes a startup error if the password
  set in the configuration file contains a hash character (#), as it's
  ambiguous whether the hash character is meant for the password or as a
  comment.
```

[02-May-19 11:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
0.18 is not compatible with notary nodes, so I don't even believe it's an option

[02-May-19 11:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
0.16.3 is the last compatible btc full node, with iguana, iirc

[02-May-19 11:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
is 18 the one with 'wallets' dir separate?

[02-May-19 11:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes, it supports loading/creating/unloading wallets at run-time

[02-May-19 11:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
```
Starting with Bitcoin Core 0.20 (expected about
  a year after 0.18), Bitcoin Core will default to native segwit
  addresses (bech32) that provide additional fee savings and other
  benefits. Currently, many wallets and services already support sending
  to bech32 addresses, and if the Bitcoin Core project sees enough
  additional adoption, it will instead default to bech32 receiving
  addresses in Bitcoin Core 0.19 (approximately November 2019).
```

[02-May-19 11:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
BTC going full segwit soon

@jeezy all chains, that exist on nn mainnet by the stats deadline - count. Why shouldn’t we count rick/morty?

[02-May-19 11:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
@kolo are RICK/MORTY rendered on notary stats websites? I haven't seen them

[02-May-19 11:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
I had no idea those test chains counted towards NN stats

@CHMEX  wait, they removed  signrawtransaction rpc in  0.18?

[02-May-19 02:01 PM] jeezy#3408
but why

[02-May-19 02:02 PM] CHMEX#0686
Thats what they changelogs says yes.... because who needs to sign raw transactions anyway:abusedsmily:

[02-May-19 02:02 PM] jeezy#3408
at this point it feels so random,  remove random rpc calls just to make other peoples lifes harder

When voting, does one have to vote all at once in one transaction?  Or can then send some one time, and then send more later?

[02-May-19 09:08 PM] phm87#7395
you can send some now and more later, as you want but before the 14th May

[02-May-19 09:08 PM] phm87#7395
it is not mandatory to make only one transaction, you can do as you want

Both teams, different kmd outputs.  One is workshopand events DAO, the other community dev.   The pioneers cannot produce software that cakeshop want to make because they don’t want software that can be a tech debt or liability

yes, this is somewhat of a perceived problem.   last year, it was interesting during node elections and early in the cycle.   other operators (from early era) have 3 & 4 nodes.  an envy/greed projection - sure.  i totally understand.  i used to think that 12 months ago.   this is why there's no hiding.   this is why the cakeshop proposal has  outputs proposed and fund distribution as such to community projects.  labs, an d pioneers to pay for more content to support the dex (https://hybriddex.com) & multi chain environment (http://test.shardwatch.com/multi-chain-projects)
