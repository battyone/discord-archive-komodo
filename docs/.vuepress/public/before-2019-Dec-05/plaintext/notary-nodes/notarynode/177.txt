we're debugging network issues right now, could you please not do anything strange. I have in/out to your new IP just fine

[27-Apr-19 09:43 PM] Alright#0419
along with out to that old IP

[27-Apr-19 09:44 PM] SHossain#0007
that change was done many days ago when Decker announced the bounty. how come that is being an issue today?

[27-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Alright#0419
not saying it is an issue

[27-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Alright#0419
but we've been trying to figure out why we're having network issues for like 2 days now

[27-Apr-19 09:45 PM] Alright#0419
eliminating anything strange from the equation helps debug that

I stopped all my nodes and iguana and restarted everything using komodo code of jl777 repo, dev branch (and not only for my beer node), I'll wait and hope that it will help

[27-Apr-19 10:25 PM] phm87#7395
I have other nodes running but I used code from KomodoPlatform repo, does it matter ? (these are simple nodes)

[27-Apr-19 10:27 PM] Alright#0419
shouldn't matter

[28-Apr-19 06:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
the reconsider was basically here to warp us before the "weird" block

[28-Apr-19 06:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
but other nodes had to be healthy

does nothing more than losing memory for blocks newer than x.

Hmm, I don't know if there is a bad block or where it is in this case.
(At the moment I've run out of things to try with BEER. All appears ok on my end, but 12 hours with no notarization and 13 minsigs seems odd.)

Maybe you can look at this script to get an idea hw to rescan from a certain height: https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo_scripts/blob/master/wallet_reset_ac.sh

Ok the decker script uses z_importkey where you can specify rescan true and specify a height: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/komodo-api/wallet.html#z-importkey

There is a note saying this though: The optional parameters are currently not functional with KMD-based blockchains.

[28-Apr-19 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
sometimes code changes, but docs dont update globally across all locations

[28-Apr-19 07:17 AM] Strob#3417
Yes it's always better to try and learn by trial and error.

[28-Apr-19 07:20 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm thinking that the Labs script I use there might work in this case.  Might even be based on Decker's (?).

[28-Apr-19 07:21 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll try moving that over to testnet and see.

[28-Apr-19 07:22 AM] CrisF#3405
The part I want to use from Decker's script is a bit beyond me at the moment :abusedsmily:

[28-Apr-19 07:25 AM] Strob#3417
IT's just like this: komodo_cli -ac_name=BEER z_importkey "$NN_ZKEY" "yes" $height

[28-Apr-19 07:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, and importing z_key will trigger a rescan from the designated height?

[28-Apr-19 07:34 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`The part I want to use from Decker's script is a bit beyond me at the moment`
```Send funds to self (consolidating as 1 UTXO) in an raddy and note the block height
create a random z address
store zaddy key
store raddy key
create a new wallet.dat
import raddy privkey without scanning
import the above zaddy key and scan from above block height```
it creates an unused z addy but the z function has more utility so it's used

游녨游낗 

[28-Apr-19 07:37 AM] Strob#3417
But can it be like z_merge that also works with Raddy?

[28-Apr-19 07:38 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
yes, because since you import the r key 1st the recan will scan for all of your addys in the wallet (which in this case would be 1 raddy and 1 zaddy)

[28-Apr-19 07:39 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
z_merge itself, though, wouldn't be any different than a normal send

[28-Apr-19 07:40 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
the only reason for the z bits is because `z_importkey` has functionality that other commands do not, there's no actual z sending needed

[28-Apr-19 08:11 AM] CrisF#3405
The rescan went well, thanks guys 游땎
