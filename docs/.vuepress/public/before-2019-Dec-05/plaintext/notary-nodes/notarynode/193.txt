[13-May-19 08:25 AM] Strob#3417
@Dr.Terminus If you run this command, what do you get? (you should get something like 0.005 to 0.010s) if much higher than there is a problem
```CSS
time komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER listunspent > /dev/null
```

[13-May-19 08:27 AM] Strob#3417
then this one: it checks for locked utxo, there shouldn't be any for beer, only KMD can have locked utxo I think.
```CSS
komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER listlockunspent | jq -c
```

[13-May-19 08:28 AM] Strob#3417
And this just in case: there shouldn't be any obviously
```CSS
komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER listbanned
```

[13-May-19 08:29 AM] Strob#3417
And also just in case, please give me your whole output for getinfo
```CSS
komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER getinfo
```

[13-May-19 08:34 AM] Strob#3417
Also what are your stats for BEER? UTXO, BAL, CON, SIZE?

[13-May-19 08:45 AM] Strob#3417
Whatever the problem is it should be possible to turn around it by resetting your wallet with decker's script (followed by a splitfund script) and or using the cleanwallettransactions RPC call. If it doesn't work, send your beer somewhere on another addresss you create, delete your beer wallet.dat, delete the beer blockchain data, get the bootstrap (https://bootstrap.dexstats.info/BEER-bootstrap.tar.gz) start beer with your pubkey and import your privkey without rescanning (adding "" false right after your importprivkey command like this:
```CSS
komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER importprivkey YOURPRIVKEYHERE "" false
```
Then you will send back the BEER you sent to your other address to fund your BEER NN address because without the rescan it will be empty. Then split your fund to get utxo. Then run the above command above to see if it fixed something.

[13-May-19 08:46 AM] Strob#3417
About decker's wallet reset script: https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo_scripts/blob/master/wallet_reset_ac.sh
At the bottom just comment ou "reset_wallet PIZZA" leaving only BEER to reset.
Don't forget to set your NN address too on line 37

your node is in NA right ? 1 thing you should take into account is in this testnet, if your node is located in EU, then it will likely have more chance to get into a nota

[13-May-19 10:37 AM] CrisF#3405
It does seem a bit strange that you haven't gotten a single nota for so long though.  It hasbeen over a week, right?

[13-May-19 10:37 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
it is in NA

[13-May-19 10:37 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
yes

[13-May-19 10:37 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
over a week and half now

[13-May-19 10:37 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
was working, stopped after everyone started having some nx issues it seems

[13-May-19 10:37 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
others have continued nx'ing as usual... hard to achieve this actually ! üòÇ

[13-May-19 10:38 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I often wind up with the strange problems.. 'could only happen to you' type stuff

[13-May-19 10:40 AM] Strob#3417
you don't seems to have any problem detected by the commands so I think you should really do thefollowing steps I suggested you, send beer elsewhere, delete everything ans restart from bootstrap, import privkey without rescan.

[13-May-19 10:41 AM] Strob#3417
I am in NA too and I am getting pretty good perf for someone outside EU! üòâ

[13-May-19 10:41 AM] Strob#3417
got up to 59 nota/6 hours last night, which I think is the max you could ever dream of in this testnet for a node outside of EU

[13-May-19 10:41 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
did self send of beer

[13-May-19 10:41 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
whole balance

[13-May-19 10:42 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ran manual split and reset scripts

[13-May-19 10:42 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
no go

[13-May-19 10:42 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
tried those steps a few times.. gitpulls on all repos first

[13-May-19 10:42 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
reboots, restarted chains etc..

[13-May-19 10:42 AM] CrisF#3405
Did you delete the wallet.dat after sending balance elsewhere?

[13-May-19 10:42 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
no

[13-May-19 10:42 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
did not do that

[13-May-19 10:43 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
will try that after a few morning chores

[13-May-19 10:43 AM] Strob#3417
Yes selfsend would fix a utxo problem but I think you may have a block corruption problem which would normally require a reindex of BEER but since beer i s so long to reindex because of the incident we got in the middle of testnet, it's better to send elsewhere delete and recreate everything and import privkey without rescanning.

[13-May-19 10:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Send funds out, then do as Strob suggested and delete wallet.dat before starting it all up.

[13-May-19 10:50 AM] Strob#3417
then once all reseted, you can use this script to try to add more connections, you have 38 but it should be able to go up to 55 (what I have now).
```CSS
#!/bin/bash
file="$HOME/2019NNtestnet/iguana/m_notary_testnet"
while IFS= read -r line
do
    ip=$( echo $line | grep addnotary | sed 's/[{}]//g' | sed 's_\\__g' | sed 's_"__g' | sed 's=curl --url http://127.0.0.1:7776 --data agent:iguana,method:addnotary,ipaddr:==')
    if [ ${#ip} -gt 1 ]; then
    KMD=$(komodo-cli addnode $ip onetry)
    BEER=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER addnode $ip onetry)
    PIZZA=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=PIZZA addnode $ip onetry)
    TXSCLCC=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC addnode $ip onetry)
    fi
done <"$file"
```

If you still don't get a nota after all of this, I really don't understand!

[13-May-19 10:54 AM] CrisF#3405
Hopefully deleting the old wallet.dat will make the difference.  Your steps plus that worked for me.

[13-May-19 11:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
don t forget that the cleanwallettransactions is something *new*, the old fashioned way of resetting  also works like a charm, not "hot", but works ^^

`cleanwallettransactions` is the only command I use to keep transactions history low, doesn't really have to send entire balance out then in imo, unless you really want to consolidate your entire balance into one single utxo

[13-May-19 11:35 AM] mrlynch#5735
i use cleanwallet and sending to self on a regular basis to keep wallet size low

[13-May-19 11:35 AM] mrlynch#5735
