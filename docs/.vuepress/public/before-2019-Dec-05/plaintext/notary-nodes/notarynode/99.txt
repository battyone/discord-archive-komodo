I think your node is in the SET  so all is OK ? :  ``` curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}                                      " | jq -cr '.[] | select(.recvmask != "               0") | .'
{"notary":"Strob","bestk":9,"recvmask":"         1022a38","bestmask":"         1022a18"}
{"notary":"jorian","bestk":9,"recvmask":"         1022a18","bestmask":"         1022a18"}
{"notary":"SHossain","bestk":7,"recvmask":"          4dc4e7","bestmask":"            c0e6"}

It looks like SHossain node is the odd node out at this moment..

It takes me a while to see myself in the statistics. ? https://notarystats.info/testnet.php

[07-Apr-19 06:52 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Is there any documentation I can read to understand the way `recvmask` works?

[07-Apr-19 06:53 PM] SHossain#0007
no

[07-Apr-19 06:54 PM] SHossain#0007
only code and knowledger from few experinced ops

[07-Apr-19 06:55 PM] SHossain#0007
but, if anyone writes one in markup, i am happy to publish it on the wiki üòÉ

[07-Apr-19 06:55 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
From what I understand, if your node has the same `recvmask` as another, you're going to notarise together?

[07-Apr-19 06:57 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Or have a chance of notarising

[07-Apr-19 06:57 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[07-Apr-19 06:59 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It is not guarenteed though,. When does the recvmask change, per block or per notarisation?

[07-Apr-19 07:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
per nota from what i observed

[07-Apr-19 07:05 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
makes sense actually

[07-Apr-19 07:09 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@NutellaLicka  probably you should start by reading this article first https://blog.komodoplatform.com/delayed-proof-of-work-explained-9a74250dbb86
And this is what I found out yesterday 
```
curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}                                      " | jq -cr '.[] | select(.recvmask != "               0") | .'
```
output (if I'm not mistaken, blackjok3r told me that this only show the output for BEER chain)
```
{"notary":"blackjok3r","bestk":12,"recvmask":"         100195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
{"notary":"Strob","bestk":12,"recvmask":"         100195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
{"notary":"jorian","bestk":12,"recvmask":"         100195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
{"notary":"PHBA2061","bestk":12,"recvmask":"         100195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
{"notary":"Lumbi","bestk":12,"recvmask":"         100195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
{"notary":"ComputerGenie","bestk":12,"recvmask":"            195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
{"notary":"mrlynch","bestk":12,"recvmask":"         100195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
{"notary":"karasugoi","bestk":12,"recvmask":"         100195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
```
If you convert `bestmask `into binary value, it gives `0001 1001 0101 1010` , read it from right to left and compare to the NN list in  `testnet.json` file (starting  with  Alright and ending with karasugoi), then the position of the "seven 1 bit" of bestmask correspond to blackjok3r (position 2), Strob (4), jorian (5) , PHBA2061  (7),  Lumbi (9), ComputerGenie (12) & mrlynch (13). And those are the people who signed the multisig tx.
Please correct me if I'm wrong üòÉ

What do I have to do to be added to the list https://notarystats.info/testnet.php?period=all ?

[07-Apr-19 07:12 PM] PHBA2061#2530
you must sign 1 notarization, then the website will add your node

[07-Apr-19 07:36 PM] Alright#0419
If no one PRs any new keys before tomorrow 3pm UTC, I will perform a dwy attack on BEER. Get your mitigation scripts ready üòà

what is a dwy attack ? üòï

[07-Apr-19 07:51 PM] SHossain#0007
very nasty attack

[07-Apr-19 07:59 PM] phm87#7395
Cool

[07-Apr-19 08:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
can t say it s a design

[07-Apr-19 08:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
just using the wallet limitations

[07-Apr-19 08:00 PM] PHBA2061#2530
ok found it by searching the chat history

[07-Apr-19 08:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
to crash nodes

[07-Apr-19 08:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
@blackjok3r developped the cleanwallet

[07-Apr-19 08:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
as a tool to mitigate it

[07-Apr-19 08:01 PM] PHBA2061#2530
so you spam NN wallet with tons of utxo  ?

[07-Apr-19 08:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
during last years s contest for staking

[07-Apr-19 08:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
I coulnd find a way to split, to compete with others, so I decided to win the bounty just by killing opponents

[07-Apr-19 08:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
it worked pretty much

[07-Apr-19 08:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
but people hated me for this, after seeing this, joker found a way to get immune to those attacks

[07-Apr-19 08:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
that is implemented "postmortem" with cleanwallet

[07-Apr-19 08:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
that s where this "dwy attack" comes from

[07-Apr-19 08:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
nothing revolutionnary

[07-Apr-19 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
the basic idea is to find a way to overload any node

[07-Apr-19 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
here what's used is a tx spam filling the wallet that takes more time to process tx than he receives it

[07-Apr-19 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
but there are other ways

[07-Apr-19 08:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I hope this testnet will remain or be re-created

[07-Apr-19 08:06 PM] SHossain#0007
for this to work, you need to know your victim's wallet address

[07-Apr-19 08:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
didn t test the networking stuff

[07-Apr-19 08:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, but apply this with business case

[07-Apr-19 08:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
and here the case was staking nodes

[07-Apr-19 08:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
staking is public

[07-Apr-19 08:07 PM] SHossain#0007
**Don't try that at home** üòÑ

[07-Apr-19 08:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
you know where the guy stakes comes from and goes

[07-Apr-19 08:07 PM] SHossain#0007
take that as educational content

[07-Apr-19 08:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
it s obvious this stuff should be tested very very carefully

[07-Apr-19 08:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
that s exactly the point

[07-Apr-19 08:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
the goal is to find flaws to fix em

[07-Apr-19 08:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
here, I insist, it was the goal of the chain, and those chains : Test, break, anything, but find stuff

Hi

[07-Apr-19 08:11 PM] Ludom#5832
I have some people who ask me what is the rule for candidature

[07-Apr-19 08:12 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
<https://komodoelection.com/4-for-candidates/candidacy-requirements/>

[07-Apr-19 08:12 PM] Ludom#5832
They write me anonymously because they fear about the public reaction

[07-Apr-19 08:12 PM] Ludom#5832
And the question is about the candidature after the 1st April

[07-Apr-19 08:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
the exact rule is "advised before the 1st", needed before 14th iirc

[07-Apr-19 08:13 PM] Ludom#5832
I personnaly don't really care but the question is legit

[07-Apr-19 08:14 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

[07-Apr-19 08:17 PM] Ludom#5832

[07-Apr-19 08:18 PM] Deleted User#0000

[07-Apr-19 08:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
last year if we refused late candidates

[07-Apr-19 08:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
I believe webworker would have been refused

[07-Apr-19 08:18 PM] Ludom#5832
And in 2021, to hard code (or something similar) the rules in the system

[07-Apr-19 08:18 PM] Ludom#5832
I totally agree, we need more candidates

[07-Apr-19 08:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
the airdrop is the 14

[07-Apr-19 08:19 PM] Ludom#5832
But we need more transparency

[07-Apr-19 08:19 PM] Ludom#5832
And we need to make the rule more stable

[07-Apr-19 08:19 PM] Ludom#5832

[07-Apr-19 08:21 PM] Ludom#5832
My question is "could be kolo a point of failure?"

[07-Apr-19 08:21 PM] phm87#7395
So we can change of region as candidate or do changes to the proposal until the 14th but maybe not correct typos after 14th if I understand

[07-Apr-19 08:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
it s too late to ask those questions, it can t be every year at election time
