64gb is OK

2nd notary possible

[17-May-19 11:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
we know we ll have all AC on same serv

[17-May-19 11:58 AM] mrlynch#5735
i can virt a 1 x 256 and probably be more cost effective than 2 x 64

[17-May-19 11:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
and that doesn t consume much resources

[17-May-19 11:58 AM] SHossain#0007
total physical RAM usage is ~45GB on current network

[17-May-19 11:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
dunno ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[17-May-19 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
depending on the splitting

[17-May-19 11:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
yes, but muh 👽 :troll_lol:

[17-May-19 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
if we got AC/KMD /BTC and KMD/External

[17-May-19 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
2 64 will be overkill

[17-May-19 11:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
_goes back to the drawing board_

[17-May-19 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
AND far more easy to find

[17-May-19 12:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
no offense to kolo, I don t want to frustrate, but people asking for my advice

[17-May-19 12:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
don't mean to be weird but things like these should be announced even if they're just a remote possibility

[17-May-19 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
it s not about the ability to virt

[17-May-19 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
we CAN

[17-May-19 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
but people going on a 256

[17-May-19 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
not virtualized

[17-May-19 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
if we need a hard split

[17-May-19 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
will get fucked

[17-May-19 12:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
and the network will suffer

Just listen to alien and dwy, I would have.... 😁

[17-May-19 12:03 PM] Carlos Crypto Economy#7861
@kolo Thanks, I have created a PR to update the readme in order to have the Discord ID as per your request

[17-May-19 12:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
in fact, all depends on the timeframe for the 2nd network

[17-May-19 12:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
a NN going on a 64 today if we add more **external** coins

[17-May-19 12:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
will be fucked

[17-May-19 12:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
if we don t splif **before** adding more external

[17-May-19 12:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
AC are peanuts HW wise

[17-May-19 12:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
ok.. virtualized 👽 it is then :troll_lol:

[17-May-19 12:08 PM] Deleted User#0000

[17-May-19 12:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
thank you all for the infoz

[17-May-19 12:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
new notaries should be added to the priv btw

[17-May-19 12:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
we have plenty of time to figure it out

[17-May-19 12:14 PM] SHossain#0007
If Kolo says to give them @ Notary-Operator role, I'll be happy to add them.

[17-May-19 12:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It's a win win network of nodes

[17-May-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
you can probably run 100+ different iguana networks on a single server

[17-May-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
2 wont cause any troubles

@Deleted User Yes like the olympic games or tour de France!.... :abusedsmily:  For sure as soon as there is a money reward associated to the competition, we risk some people favouring their rank to the smooth operation of the network. I hope every one realized that giving the best image of the KMD Notarization process to the world we need to forget the reward and focus on doing the job as best as we can as a team yes!

[17-May-19 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the main issue with iguana is TIME_WAIT on local host.... but if u put them in VMs or docker, then it doesnt matter at all
the limit per VM would be MAX 128 coins.. and 64 would be much safer, 32 even better. some ppl already had issues starting coin daemons, with RPC port bound to something else. 
for scale test I managed 1024 coins, but had to firewall OS start coins, then iguana.
drop firewall. 
without that things would just fail to start, not being able to bind a port.

[17-May-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
we have 5 external coins now

[17-May-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
seems we are nowhere near the limit

[17-May-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
time to panic is not yet

[17-May-19 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
a 128GB ram server with VMs can easily do 256 coins

[17-May-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
and it wont matter if using 1 iguana or 2

[17-May-19 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it requires multiple iguanas.

[17-May-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
and it wont matter if using 4 iguana or 8

[17-May-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the limit is the number of coins

[17-May-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
granted at 1000 iguanas you will run into iguana based limits

[17-May-19 02:14 PM] cipi#4502
`the main issue with iguana is TIME_WAIT on local host` ... yes, and it is only connections from iguana to the coins RPC port... wonder if iguana could manage this better, to reduce the number of TIME_WAIT connections... normally it is not a big problem, even with 10s of thousands of such connections, but the higher the number, the bigger the chance that you will have trouble starting up the wallets, because the rpcport they try to listen to is already in use by such a TIME_WAIT connection... but if you manage to start your wallets, it doesn't matter any more

[17-May-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
start all the wallets first

[17-May-19 02:18 PM] cipi#4502
the other solution to this problem would be to use rpcports only outside of this range: `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 16001 65530`
normally this setting is 32000 to 65000... i increased it a bit on my node
or start the wallets first 😃

[17-May-19 02:26 PM] cipi#4502
or use more then one local ip... like 127.0.0.2 ... 127.0.0.3 and you have more ports ;-)
but that would need some changes

[17-May-19 02:32 PM] cipi#4502
i suppose 127.0.0.1 is hardcoded somewhere as the IP to the wallets RPC interface... if you changes that to 127.0.0.2 and let the wallets listen to 127.0.0.2, the problem with the wallet startup would be gone

[17-May-19 03:07 PM] Strob#3417
Question here guys... in the COINS_7776 files there is an ip: "seedipaddr" (78.47.196.146) who's ip is that?

[17-May-19 03:07 PM] Strob#3417
It's in the Hetzner datacenter in Germany

[17-May-19 03:08 PM] SHossain#0007
NN ip

[17-May-19 03:08 PM] Strob#3417
which NN you?

[17-May-19 03:08 PM] SHossain#0007
jl777's or kolo i assume

[17-May-19 03:09 PM] Strob#3417
Ok. Maybe that would explain why everyone in that datacenter seems to have very good connectivity

[17-May-19 03:09 PM] SHossain#0007
on testnet?

[17-May-19 03:09 PM] Strob#3417
yes

[17-May-19 03:10 PM] SHossain#0007
possibility is that ip not running TXSCLCC chain

[17-May-19 03:10 PM] SHossain#0007
how many testnet ip is in that DC?

[17-May-19 03:10 PM] Strob#3417
Next testnet next year, I will choose a server in that datacenter!

[17-May-19 03:11 PM] Strob#3417
Or check that ipseed ip and go to it 😉

[17-May-19 03:11 PM] SHossain#0007
my testnet server is not in that DC

[17-May-19 03:11 PM] SHossain#0007
personally i never used Hetzner

[17-May-19 03:11 PM] Strob#3417
No but 6 other NN were

[17-May-19 03:12 PM] SHossain#0007
a lot of NA servers were in ovh-ca...not all of them had high stats or good performance

I think if you have good NN nodes, well setup and well taken car of with a very good connectivity between each of them, then someone farther from them can't get as high count, it's just  theory based on observation from this testnet

[17-May-19 03:15 PM] SHossain#0007
my mainnet nodes are not nearby other nodes, nor in the same DC. how did they become #1 and #2 overall?

[17-May-19 03:16 PM] SHossain#0007
same DC can't give best performance

[17-May-19 03:17 PM] Strob#3417
then why balackjoker was very slow at the begininig in australia and then went up very high as soon as he moved to that DC and then went back very low as soon as he went out?

[17-May-19 03:18 PM] SHossain#0007
moving ip affects performance for a while

[17-May-19 03:18 PM] Strob#3417
his performance was affected positively when moving to EU

[17-May-19 03:19 PM] Strob#3417
I change my server from medium end to very high end without any improvement

[17-May-19 03:19 PM] Strob#3417
So ruled out hardware spec as a factor

[17-May-19 03:19 PM] SHossain#0007
there are many factors involved

[17-May-19 03:20 PM] Strob#3417
@webworker01 You are propably right on that. In fact mainnet is different enough from this testnet to destroy any testnet theory I guess1

[17-May-19 03:21 PM] Strob#3417
Personnaly my location will never change cause I use my own hardware at home.

[17-May-19 03:23 PM] Strob#3417
But I would be curious to rent a server at Hetzner for the following month just to see how it goes.

[17-May-19 03:23 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I think not only ping but also network topo / hop matter ...
so next year testnet may be we should try to spread  location more evenly, if possible
