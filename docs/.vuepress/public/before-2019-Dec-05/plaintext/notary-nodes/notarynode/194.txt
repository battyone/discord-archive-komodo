I downgraded my hardware too and got a boost!

[13-May-19 12:07 PM] SHossain#0007
however, i did use 👽 tech in the beginning and was constantly #1 position

getting the bill for the testnet servers this morning was not fun however 😖

@Strob given the number of days I spent between 9 and 13, I'm going to say that I got no specific advantage to being in EU

[13-May-19 12:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I do think that certain %ages of signers does reward certain maintenance strategies, though

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  Ok interesting to learn that I was starting to think that a cluster of well performing node in EU made in sort that it become impossible to someone out of EU to get something like more than 60 nota/6h. So  do you think a signer with best maintenance strategies could have get 80 nota/6h while being in NA or australia?

[13-May-19 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've not changed server since the beginning and last week was the 1st time I topped 70

[13-May-19 12:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
i went on par with genie for a while, until he decided to go on holiday ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[13-May-19 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1) it was a funeral, not a holiday
2) I had my dev lappy with me the whole time 😛

I think if you look from the point of getting that sorted forward, the rankings come out quite different

i wonder who will make a 1 script installer for the full NN setup guide this year which will cover all aspects of basic/advanced setup

[13-May-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Deleted User  basically did it already I think... But I am planning on making something similar to that for my node this year

[13-May-19 12:26 PM] SHossain#0007
fill up few things, then, execute the script

[13-May-19 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think it should be something that people use, they should all write their own

I don't mind helping anyone, but that's too much like holding their hand and teaching them to do the job I want 😛

[13-May-19 12:27 PM] SHossain#0007
that might be helpful for some ops. i prefer old school manaul for the full setup

[13-May-19 12:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
`1) it was a funeral, not a holiday` sorry for your loss, wasn't aware..

[13-May-19 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its more important to know how it works than anything else IMO. Scripts and automation are good... if it breaks though, you need to know  how to fix it.

`that might be helpful for some ops. `
I have mixed emotions about that
on one hand I don't want a single unprepared NN
on the other hand, do they deserve the job if unprepared by then?

[13-May-19 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's still a month - month & half until live
even if they haven't participated to this point, there's still plenty of time to learn

@mrlynch It was wife's sister, but tnks

the best scripts are the ones you tweak to your needs based on what others have done, learning in the process.

@webworker01 do you mind adding few lines on how to use this for the noobs please

[13-May-19 12:51 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll go throguh the edits you sent for the NN setup guide once i'm done with few other tasks.

[13-May-19 01:29 PM] SHossain#0007
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install git
```

[13-May-19 01:29 PM] SHossain#0007
``git` needs to be installed 😃

[13-May-19 01:30 PM] SHossain#0007
without `git` installed, how users will clone your repo? :abused_smiley:

[13-May-19 01:31 PM] SHossain#0007
but, looks better than before

[13-May-19 01:37 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
so Testnet operations all stop after today or will things be left running for continual testing?

[13-May-19 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
afaik, several of us will continue on for a while

[13-May-19 01:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

@Dr.Terminus Please tell me how it goes, I'm curious to know why your BEER was stuck and to know if my suggested steps can take it back on tracks.

so as long as you respond in that cycle, it wont matter

[13-May-19 02:56 PM] Strob#3417
Ok very good to know.

[13-May-19 02:56 PM] Strob#3417
I did have a ping of 700 with someone in Australia

[13-May-19 02:56 PM] Strob#3417
Then how do you explain Blackjok3r testnet results?

[13-May-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
he achieved very good results with bad ping

[13-May-19 02:57 PM] Strob#3417
When he changed location from australia to EU, his nota skyrocketeed

[13-May-19 02:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Btw are only "bare-metal dedicated" allowed or some virtualisation cloud solution as well?

[13-May-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
what is to explain

[13-May-19 02:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Found nice Asia option on AWS

[13-May-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
connectivity is a different issue

[13-May-19 02:57 PM] Strob#3417
then he went back to tokyo or australia again and went to the bottom

[13-May-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if you cant connect, then that is a problem as notary network requires a fully connected network

[13-May-19 02:58 PM] Mylo#8306
@TonyL double check AWS disk i/o, not so good for notaz imo

[13-May-19 02:58 PM] CHMEX#0686
Tonyl the price per GB you pay will kill your income

[13-May-19 02:58 PM] CHMEX#0686
Traffic

[13-May-19 02:58 PM] Strob#3417
ok so maybe it's not the ping, but geolocation seemed like a huge factor in the testnet anyway.

[13-May-19 02:59 PM] Mylo#8306
yes but this is why there are 4 regions, apart from teh decentralization aspect.  teh points system is split into 4 regions so there is no region favouritism for points.   EU/NA servers do get more notaz though.

[13-May-19 02:59 PM] Mylo#8306
if you are in SH you compete with only SH servers, AR with AR etc.

[13-May-19 03:00 PM] Strob#3417
Then maybe it should have been separated in 4 regions for the testnet too, but I understand it would have been more difficult.

[13-May-19 03:01 PM] TonyL#3577
They made new "all in box" solution - kinda EC2 for noobies. There is a 5TB of prepaid traffic per month.  How much traffic usually needed per month for notary operator?

[13-May-19 03:01 PM] Mylo#8306
3-5TB i think.   more chains more traffic.    my quick response is not accurate thoughh.

meshbits was on AWS this year.

[13-May-19 03:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Should have quite competetive machine in Asia for 160$ + possibility to connect more disks, best what I found in Asia so far

have I done myself a disservice hosting here in na ?

[13-May-19 03:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's possible to use `provisioned IOPS` SSD if contact AWS 😃

[13-May-19 03:06 PM] Strob#3417
Last year, where were most of the NN? in EU too because cheaper?

[13-May-19 03:06 PM] Mylo#8306
for testnet?

[13-May-19 03:06 PM] Mylo#8306
i had a dedicated box with vultr in singapore for testnet.

[13-May-19 03:08 PM] TonyL#3577
`meshbits was on AWS this year.` @Mylo hmm by last year stats it looks like AWS servers are not competetive, or maybe reason of such low notas amount not hardware dkn

[13-May-19 03:08 PM] TonyL#3577
So have to test first anyway 😃 At least I know now that it should be  not forbidden by rules, thanks

[13-May-19 03:15 PM] Strob#3417
yes I was asking about last year's testnet

[13-May-19 03:16 PM] SHossain#0007
last year test was mostly distributed

[13-May-19 03:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
all the people running testnet under NA... not technically hosting in NA 😕

[13-May-19 03:16 PM] SHossain#0007
people wanted to check their server if that notarizes or not.
we didn't have that much expertise or docs available

[13-May-19 03:17 PM] SHossain#0007
this year, you guys got all info needed

[13-May-19 03:17 PM] SHossain#0007

hopefully, next season will make things much better for the next gen
