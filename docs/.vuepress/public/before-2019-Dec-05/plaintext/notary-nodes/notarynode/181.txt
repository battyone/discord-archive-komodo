@Don King  I might start contributing my time working on CHIPS, but it's not guaranteed yet, I need to improve my skills first üòÉ

[01-May-19 10:19 AM] Don King#8901
Thanks guys, CHIPS is one ecosystem project that could really gain viral adoption during next bull market, just needs some funding to finish GUI etc afaik

@phm87 is also planning to support CHIPS

[01-May-19 10:20 AM] TonyL#3577
I've played few games with sg777 @Don King , pretty interesting thing, with GUI should be boomer üòÉ

[01-May-19 10:20 AM] phm87#7395
Yes. Financial support (20%) and other things (see proposal: servers, explorer, docker)

[01-May-19 10:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Just CHIPS coins distribution looks not very healthy

[01-May-19 10:21 AM] TonyL#3577
But since it's opensourced anybody will able to run own chain to make own pokerroom

[01-May-19 10:23 AM] Don King#8901
@phm87 20% funding sounds good, 
@TonyL hopefully CHIPS distro improves when players start buying tokens for actual gameplay

[01-May-19 10:23 AM] Mylo#8306
@patchkez cheers.  Bridge already

[01-May-19 10:24 AM] Don King#8901
No chips premine, so distro ticks all the boxes for 'fairness'

[01-May-19 10:25 AM] Mylo#8306
Seems to be going okay now with 2 NNs on same host.  Maybe it was auto split.  I have disabled it now

[01-May-19 10:26 AM] phm87#7395

@phm87 just a suggestion
rename your gist to a .md files
then with your links, surround them like this so they are clickable links
[link to repo](https://linktorepo.com)

currently trying to sync CHIPS but it wont start syncing, tried recompiling fresh, etc,  maybe  an  addnode list in  config will help, does anyone have such a list? via PM is fine

@phm87  good idea to look there!  will try thanks

[01-May-19 10:53 AM] jeezy#3408

I've decided to back out of this years election process. I know only 8% of the votes have been cast and there is a fortnight to go, but I have to be realistic with being 100,000s behind, it ain't going to happen and my rolling contract with my server ends in a few days, so better I pull out, backup my server and try again next year. I can then focus my attentions on making my mining pool server work, which is close to being finished.

Please can my details be removed from the voting process, and my server will go offfline at the end of the week.

@Don King I will be creating a bounty fund and the initial funds will be put towards CHIPS development. I am indeed excited about blockchain poker!

[01-May-19 02:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
BEER is being damn difficult.. None of the usual reset , resync tricks seem to bring nx's back

[01-May-19 02:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
other chains still looking good

[01-May-19 02:47 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
do I need to clear BEER chain and resync it from scratch? Doesn't seem practical.. If it syncs it syncs right ?

[01-May-19 02:55 PM] Mylo#8306
1.  is it synced
2. is your key imported
3. is there balance
4. is there UTXOs
5. if too many UTXOs, will be slower; then send balance to self and resplit
6. make sure iguana is dpow-ing (output from iguana/log will show BEER heights), run curl command from bottom of m_notary_testnet, either it returns `sucecss`, dpow was not on but now it is, or it retuns `cannot dpow a coin twice` it is already dpowing.

[01-May-19 02:58 PM] Mylo#8306
7. check debug.log for errors

[01-May-19 02:58 PM] Mylo#8306
8. check peers `getpeerinfo` to see you have peers conencted

[01-May-19 03:00 PM] Mylo#8306
9.  check against explorer that you are not on a fork

^ it's TXSCLCC though

[01-May-19 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am going to make a game blockchain based on the new paymentsCC that we can use to test it. Its using a lot of new stuff added recently. I need a list of address for people that would like to join in. 
It will probably require a fair bit of knowledge of utxos and raw transactions to be effecive at winning it. Or just luck. A decent statagey may be just using lots of random balances in hundreds of address. 
The basic idea is, there is a daily "prize" that is paid to a set of address that fall into a range on the rich list. So for example one day it would be the top 50%, and the next day the bottom 50%. But it could be something silly like 51/49 so the 2% between this range would get the entire daily mining reward. The maximum number of address that is used is 3999.  so using a balance that is too low will mean those address will not participate.
