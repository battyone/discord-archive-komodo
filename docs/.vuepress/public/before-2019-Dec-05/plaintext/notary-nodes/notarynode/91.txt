Yeah.  I have always wondered how accurate that is.

[06-Apr-19 06:53 AM] mrlynch#5735
is there any documentation on iguana?

what is recvmask?

all in all my node is ripping it lately üòÅ can't wait to try the new server

[06-Apr-19 06:54 AM] CrisF#3405
```Recvmask is all the nodes that are elegible to participate in a notarisations, and bestmask is the nodes that participated```

[06-Apr-19 06:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks to Blackjok3r for that üòâ

[06-Apr-19 06:55 AM] CrisF#3405
```best.k is a deterministc number based on recvmask
that is used to calcualte the bestmask```

[06-Apr-19 06:56 AM] mrlynch#5735
thank you

[06-Apr-19 06:56 AM] mrlynch#5735
is the recvmask changing or is that set in stone for each node?

[06-Apr-19 06:57 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm moving, but slowly.  Not complaining, I was testing some things out and had some downtime.

part .. .the checkpoint is not set, as there is already a checkpoint at a heigher block height

We cant control when miners mine notarizations (in fact they can 100% attack the chain and refuse to mine them all together)

Yeah it should be usually.. Its just something to check. Pleas guys stop freeking out if 1 chain doesnt notarize... when there is 47 chains... its really no issue.... Somtimes one of them wont ntoarize for days even weeks.

[06-Apr-19 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If one is not ntoarizing at all.. .gaurneteed another one is notarizing c0onstantly making up for it. If nothig is notarizing... then you have problem.

I don't understand why restarting my node kicked it back into high gear

[06-Apr-19 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is defiantly a thing that if you start iguana at the right time it just works better... I was never able to work out how to... It always reights itself after it been up for a day or 2.

[06-Apr-19 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem appears to be the KMD height that it is being used as the prevDESTHEIGHT variable...

[06-Apr-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a stochastic process

[06-Apr-19 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when you first start it its 0...

[06-Apr-19 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it needs to get to the same number as the other nodes on all dpow coins before they reach consesnus at the same time

[06-Apr-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
like tossing a coin, sometimes you get 4 heads in a row and almost never do you get heads and tails alternating for dozens of turns

[06-Apr-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
if you do get perfectly alternating heads and tails, after a while you can prove it is not a randomized process

[06-Apr-19 07:50 AM] Alright#0419
what is the coin toss? when you start iguana?

[06-Apr-19 07:50 AM] Alright#0419
or each notarization?

[06-Apr-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
notarization participation

[06-Apr-19 07:51 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`Somtimes one of them wont ntoarize for days even weeks.`
But those are stagnant, on-demand chains, no?

[06-Apr-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, no block means no notarizations

[06-Apr-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the bestmask selector moves around the 64 bits every 64 notarizations

[06-Apr-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
or i guess with less NN, every N notarizations where N is the number of notaries

[06-Apr-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
minsigs are selected from the starting point based on availability of node and its connectivity

[06-Apr-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so given perfect conditions a node wont notarize for (N-minsigs) number of rounds

[06-Apr-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
and given imperfect conditions of the peerr NN, it would be less than (N-minsigs) gaps

[06-Apr-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if your node is the one not connected to the other nodes, then you can miss out on many, so first thing to check is the recvmasks for the other peers

[06-Apr-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if that is good, and you have utxo, it will notarize your share

[06-Apr-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
but not in any perfect predictable frequency

[06-Apr-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
to understand the iguana is to know the iguana

[06-Apr-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
and the ones that are one with the iguana are few indeed

[06-Apr-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
BODY LANGUAGE OF THE GREEN IGUANA

Various things to notice: 

1) BODY POSTURE and MOVEMENT, 
2) EYES DIRECTION, EYE LID SHAPE and ACTIVITY, 
3) TONGUE ACTIVITY, 

There is a body language that iguanas have and it is of the utmost importance to learn it to properly read and understand what's on the iguana's mind, so you are able to accurately know it's every mood and attitude from moment to moment. You can tell if the iguana is calm and relaxed or scared and ready to run or ready to bite and whip instead or wants to have sex and mate or that he's suddenly taken on a scary change in character and become so serious and angry, and wants to go to war with you exactly as he would act if he sees another male iguana. 

When observing the iguana's body signs and activity, you must learn to distinguish between things that are temporary and changes of the moment as opposed to it's regular moods and behavior in general.

[06-Apr-19 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your port is closed. Or your ISP has blocked it or yuur missing some route

if 1/4 of recvmasks are 0, unless they are all consecutive, you will lose far more than 25% of notarizations

You should have the same recvmask as the rest of the nodes. 
The CURL sommand CrisF psoted, shows the info for the first dpow coin (which is BEER I think) and you want to check it only at the near end of a round so it has all teh required information received.

[06-Apr-19 07:59 AM] CrisF#3405

It helps to see who you see first

[06-Apr-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If reccv mask is bad, you need to start scanning ports on other ndoes, and doing trace backs and tcpdumps and stuff... I thaught we fixed nearlyt all these problems though. 99% of the issue will be some nodes not updating with the new pubkeys.
