`grep "ac_name"`?

[19-Apr-19 12:38 PM] Mylo#8306
still gives me columns of info about the process

[19-Apr-19 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what specific bits do you want?

[19-Apr-19 12:41 PM] Mylo#8306
-ac_name=THISPART

[19-Apr-19 12:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`ps aux | grep "ac_name" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $12}'` ?

[19-Apr-19 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆🏽 will fail for that if name isn't 1st arg, though

[19-Apr-19 12:46 PM] Mylo#8306
ok - yeah leto gave me an alternative, and both rely on knowing which order the args are

[19-Apr-19 12:46 PM] Mylo#8306
thanks genie

[19-Apr-19 12:47 PM] Mylo#8306
doing `[a]c_name` will remove the need for the 2nd grep -v

Hi, Is there any policy on where we can and can't advertise for votes?  If I were to post on a site that doesn't allow that is it only their problem, or will it be a problem here as well?

[19-Apr-19 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
to date, there's been no official "rule" for posing in slack/discord as long as it's non-interuptive to any active conversation

@Alright chances are if you don't call out names, they aren't going to know it's them

Need to figure out which set is updated and which isn't

_figures the set in the top 5 is :P_

[19-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Alright#0419
How do you think we have 20 nodes notarizing constantly?

[19-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Alright#0419
because we have 2 separate networks right now

[19-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Alright#0419
just update, I'll figure out who it is if it continues

[19-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Alright#0419
or feel free to figure out who it is yourself

[19-Apr-19 04:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`How do you think we have 20 nodes notarizing constantly?`
Because someone is mining blocks constantly?

[19-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Mylo#8306
curl the file that gets updated, if it's different to yours, send a telegram bot notice - will share when on testnet - comes in handy to  have the bot talk to you abotu your node irl

[19-Apr-19 04:31 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I sudo apt-update & upgrade then reinitialized all asset chains, started notarizing and cleaned wallet like a day and a half ago

[19-Apr-19 04:31 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
do I need to to more than this ?

[19-Apr-19 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@SHossain I noticed your BEER notarizations keep stopping for long periods. Are you experiencing that same listunspent bug I talked about previously?

[19-Apr-19 04:43 PM] Greer#0666
doh, I dwy-attacked myself at some point over the last couple of days.  tried the nntools/utxosplitter and was splitting into 100000, bash was counting the 10000 utxo's and splitting into more and more 100000 utxo's.  Figuratively smashed a pie into my own face.
Going to try to figure out cleaning up those extra utxo's on my own, will be back asking questions I'm sure.

[19-Apr-19 04:44 PM] phm87#7395
@Greer  if you need any assistance, please feel free to ask (a second node on the same wallet can help to consolidate)

[19-Apr-19 04:45 PM] TonyL#3577
```Send funds somewhere
Delete wallet.dat
./komodo-cli -ac_name=acname importprivkey privkey "" false
Set some funds back
Split utxos```

[19-Apr-19 04:45 PM] Greer#0666
appreciate, yes was going to take a similar approach to the dwy attack, just find the 100000 tx's and send them consolidate them away.

[19-Apr-19 04:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Greer how did u manage to do that?

[19-Apr-19 04:45 PM] TonyL#3577
I wounder actions something like this

[19-Apr-19 04:45 PM] Alright#0419
@TonyL that's a very bad solution to the problem

[19-Apr-19 04:45 PM] Greer#0666
@TonyL on the plus side, they dont seem to have entered the wallet.dat

why tf did u put beer and pizza there?

[19-Apr-19 05:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
u basically told it to split 100k if coin is beer, pizza or txsclcc

[19-Apr-19 05:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
>I don't know why it made 100k UTXOs after edited it and I told it to

[19-Apr-19 05:00 PM] Greer#0666
I didn't not understand, I just missed a zero.  100000 and 10000 looks a lot alike and I've been up too late on occasion doing this and tried many different methods/scripts to accomplish it

[19-Apr-19 05:02 PM] Greer#0666
there are at least half dozen scripts that do this, I've been trying them all, made a cockup and came here in the spirit of weightwatchers to shame myself for doing that.

[19-Apr-19 05:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if it makes you feel any better, I've done stuff like that with scripts I wrote myself
_once burnt 10k of the coin which shall not be named because he ran a sapling script on their sprout chain_

[19-Apr-19 05:02 PM] mrlynch#5735
that's not relevant.. u edited and put beer, pizza & txsclcc in the ifs

[19-Apr-19 05:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
for any other coin it will get the utxos # from $duplicates

[19-Apr-19 05:04 PM] Greer#0666
yes, I see that was the mistake, thats why I pasted it to show what I messed up.

consolidate on a 2nd node

[19-Apr-19 05:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
use merge.sh for that

[19-Apr-19 05:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
or just sendtoaddress

[19-Apr-19 05:05 PM] Greer#0666
I didn't do too bad, only a few hundred extra in each.

there's a relatively quick way to merge dust if you want, requires a bit of hacking though

[19-Apr-19 05:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
make sure after you consolidate you restart your daemons on nn with fresh wallet.dat

[19-Apr-19 05:08 PM] Alright#0419
create raw txs with a single 0 sat vout

[19-Apr-19 05:08 PM] Alright#0419
send them all, all the dust combines to miner

[19-Apr-19 05:08 PM] Greer#0666
