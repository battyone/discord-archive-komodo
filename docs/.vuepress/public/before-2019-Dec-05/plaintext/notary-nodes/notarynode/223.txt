>>> NN Elected Volunteers are elected servants who serve the Group Consensus. They are elected with the understanding that they are trusted to have the best interests of Komodo and its NN operators at heart and to follow the will of the members as shown through Group Consensus.

Best governance model is a hybrid approach. Some new nn, some experienced nn, some selected from management... 1 season term limits. Must pass a written test 😬

In governance, sortition (also known as selection by lot, allotment, or demarchy) is the selection of political officials as a random sample from a larger pool of candidates, a system intended to ensure that all competent and interested parties have an equal chance of holding...

Hi everyone, 
Sorry to be slow in announcing the KIP. 
(Thanks for letting everyone know @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator.)
 The KIP is on Github at the link that was posted above ☝ 
It would be great if we can discuss it in Discord, but for any key points you have please add them to Github so they don't get lost.
Thank you for the comments already posted.

I've just noticed some issues with my third party server, and after contacting the providor it seems a hard drive replacement is required, so my node will be offline for a bit while that happens and I reinstall everything.

I finally published an article that I mostly wrote in December and January about @KomodoPlatform's dPoW algorithm. Ultimately, my overall position remains the same: dPoW comes with tradeoffs that aren't adequately communicated in their marketing.

not sure why normal `komodod` master doesn't have HUSH3 stuff yet, but that is @jl777c 's decision

master is updated only very rarely and it is handy for cases like this, as we can know that it worked as of last master update

my question is, why were those lines needed?

did @Mihailo run into these same problems, and fix it just for pegsCC ?

[12-Oct-19 05:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
those 3 `ifs` skip the code that coredumps in Hush

[12-Oct-19 05:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
it might be that a similar `continue` is needed for this case of zutxo-derived funds that are being spent from mempool

[12-Oct-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
pegs has some very special "inputs" that are actually not utxo

[12-Oct-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
but, yes some sort of special case check is needed

[12-Oct-19 05:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, so for different reasons. But maybe the same check in a few places is needed

[12-Oct-19 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
"if we are spending from the mempool, and the txid we are spending comes from zutxo inputs, skip the `IsAvailable` check in `GetOutputFor`"

[12-Oct-19 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c does something like that sound reasonable?

[12-Oct-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe IsAvailable should allow all zinputs and not require it be a taddr utxo?

[12-Oct-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure, this is code i havent changed

[12-Oct-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems it is just a mempool issue, so maybe a special case in the mempool accept is sufficient

[12-Oct-19 05:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, i am not sure the exact logic of the special condition. I guess we need to make sure the same thing doesn't happen when not spending from the mempool

[12-Oct-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
spending of z->t outputs is working, except in this edge case

`only nodes that saw the tx in the mempool in realtime accepted the block.

that seems to hold as nodes that were live then cannot fresh sync now with 0 code changes

[12-Oct-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
my theory is that only the nodes that saw it in their mempool when the critical block was mined, accepted it

[12-Oct-19 05:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
Hush probably has the highest transaction volume of any KMD smartchain that allows these kinds of transactions, so statistically we were most likely to hit this bug
