and the jamming part is still unsafe to use if you don t want your provider to ban you

[17-Apr-19 09:36 PM] phm87#7395
can we run the script behind a public internet connection ?

[17-Apr-19 09:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
can t explain here why it would just fail on testnet

[17-Apr-19 09:37 PM] SHossain#0007
can some of you gentelman please issue this in your node?
```
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"iguana\",\"method\":\"addnotary\",\"ipaddr\":\"51.38.82.175\"}"

can you say more about it ?

[17-Apr-19 09:39 PM] SHossain#0007
where?

[17-Apr-19 09:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
and just because am bored to clean dust

[17-Apr-19 09:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
there s nothing to say

[17-Apr-19 09:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
you already have all the piece in mind

[17-Apr-19 09:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
all it is is coordination

[17-Apr-19 09:40 PM] phm87#7395
SHossain : here above in this chan but maybe we were confusing ppl. It seems that maybe some double notas happened on BEER

[17-Apr-19 09:41 PM] SHossain#0007
it was on BEER when i noticed it

[17-Apr-19 09:41 PM] phm87#7395
oh sorry I am confused

[17-Apr-19 09:41 PM] SHossain#0007
that's not harmful as i later realised

[17-Apr-19 09:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
cause I believe we saw client attack, like the thing-someone-is-playing-with-even-if-theres-no-reason, but serverside. nothing

[17-Apr-19 09:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
not serverside, but blockchainwize

[17-Apr-19 09:43 PM] phm87#7395
except if groups of NN are not on the same chain for BEER (let's imagine any incentive to test this)

[17-Apr-19 09:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
don t forget the dwy attack was first thought to just fill block like wtf and jam the network while mining separately on another chain

[17-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
the thing is that attacking myself my wallet exploded

[17-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
so noneed to attack the network, just opponentz

[17-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
but the network side is still unproven, at least for me

[17-Apr-19 09:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
and the only scenario to prove an attack being to provoke reorgs, and for that bypass dpow

[17-Apr-19 09:45 PM] phm87#7395
I saw it on mainet for altcoins without dpow

[17-Apr-19 09:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
the nzxt logical step is to try the evil nn scenario and see if it s powerful enough to cause trouble

[17-Apr-19 09:46 PM] Deleted User#0000

How do you add a checkpoint in an AC ?

[17-Apr-19 09:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
notarize

[17-Apr-19 09:47 PM] phm87#7395
I know where for a BTC clone but I'm new to KMD

[17-Apr-19 09:47 PM] phm87#7395
I mean that a checkpoint is inside the code of the wallet, then I guessed that jl777 would have add a parameter

[17-Apr-19 09:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
i guess the wallet being the daemon just assume the chain he s on is safe

and some checkpoints for KMD itself, it is very interesting

[17-Apr-19 10:09 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`How do you add a checkpoint in an AC ?`
the notarizations are akin to live checkpoints

[17-Apr-19 10:10 PM] phm87#7395
Dwy said the same but I was looking for checkpoints for AC without dpow/notas

[17-Apr-19 10:10 PM] phm87#7395
thank you

[17-Apr-19 10:10 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
there aren't any afaik

[17-Apr-19 10:11 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
because of notarizations, it would be kinda pointless to hard code them

[17-Apr-19 10:11 PM] phm87#7395
I'll check for VRSC https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/blob/master/src/chainparams.cpp#L280

VRSC is a unique critter

[17-Apr-19 10:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
the link you pointed seems just to point to a variance on how genesisblock hash is taken

[17-Apr-19 10:25 PM] phm87#7395
I don't agree dwy, look at the comment
```                    (int64_t)1529910234,    // * UNIX timestamp of last checkpoint block
                    (int64_t)63661,         // * total number of transactions between genesis and last checkpoint
                                            //   (the tx=... number in the SetBestChain debug.log lines)
                    (double)2777            // * estimated number of transactions per day after checkpoint
                                            //   total number of tx / (checkpoint block height / (24 * 24))```

[17-Apr-19 10:25 PM] phm87#7395
it talks about checkpoint

[17-Apr-19 10:26 PM] phm87#7395
but I'm not sure, i'm new

[17-Apr-19 10:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
am not expert at all üòâ

[17-Apr-19 10:26 PM] phm87#7395
I already played with checkpoints for some coins that had issues but everything is different in KMD world with the assetchains and so on

[17-Apr-19 10:31 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/commit/6a7ef35d8c53f19bbaddf581fdd9cf44ef4568cf> <- when/why that was added

[17-Apr-19 10:32 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
if I followed back correctly

[17-Apr-19 10:38 PM] phm87#7395
few days ago, on an unrelated coin, they had so many chain issues that they restart chain from genesis block. I heard that exchanges are happy when this happen. On my side, I think it is bad because investors and miners are stolen

[17-Apr-19 10:40 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
also, if I read correctly, `if (strcmp(ASSETCHAINS_SYMBOL,"VRSC") == 0)` = ` if not VRSC`

[17-Apr-19 10:40 PM] phm87#7395
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strcmp/

[17-Apr-19 10:41 PM] phm87#7395
0 means that both content are equal

[17-Apr-19 10:43 PM] phm87#7395
so I think that you're wrong (or maybe it is not c++ or it is a custom strcmp then you may be correct)

[17-Apr-19 10:43 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_can't code C/C++ worth shite, so there's that_

[17-Apr-19 10:45 PM] phm87#7395
sorry guy, I didn't want to hurt you

[17-Apr-19 10:49 PM] phm87#7395
question about assetchain creation : what if 2 computers are inside a network but without internet, create a chain named BEER then mine some blocks ? Then if it doesn't break with the BEER assetchain already on when it connects to the internet, what if they corrupt some testnet NN operators to nota the fake BEER ?

[17-Apr-19 10:50 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
longest chain rule

[17-Apr-19 10:50 PM] phm87#7395
what about notas ?

[17-Apr-19 10:50 PM] Alright#0419
not longest chain rule

{Reactions}
‚òù 

[17-Apr-19 10:50 PM] Alright#0419
it won't allow you to reorg block 1 no matter what

[17-Apr-19 10:50 PM] Alright#0419
it will just error out and do nothing

[17-Apr-19 10:51 PM] phm87#7395
so without internet, with several computers or VM, can I create another BEER (in my local network) ?

[17-Apr-19 10:52 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[17-Apr-19 10:52 PM] Alright#0419
but if you then connect it to the actual BEER network, both networks will just ban each other's nodes

[17-Apr-19 10:54 PM] phm87#7395
what if I have 1000 small VPS and I send many tx on mempool and I mine empty blocks and I corrupts 7 ppl here ?

[17-Apr-19 10:54 PM] phm87#7395
(or I can make a PR with 6 new NN testnet addys)

[17-Apr-19 10:54 PM] Alright#0419
not sure what you mean

[17-Apr-19 10:55 PM] phm87#7395
I did kind of 51% on testnet of BTC clones

[17-Apr-19 10:56 PM] phm87#7395
I'm not sure, I should check but I was using connect= parameter

[17-Apr-19 10:56 PM] phm87#7395
and several nodes

[17-Apr-19 10:57 PM] phm87#7395
nodes and pool deployed on a VM that I put on the rig itself

[17-Apr-19 10:57 PM] phm87#7395
and I know someone who tested it but with NH ^^

[17-Apr-19 10:58 PM] phm87#7395
but I see what you mean when you say that half the network ban the other half

[17-Apr-19 10:59 PM] Alright#0419
I don't know what you're talking about to be frank

[17-Apr-19 10:59 PM] Alright#0419
`what if I have 1000 small VPS and I send many tx on mempool and I mine empty blocks and I corrupts 7 ppl here ?` this

[17-Apr-19 10:59 PM] Alright#0419
what?

[17-Apr-19 11:00 PM] phm87#7395
Just a worst case scenario similar to the XVG Network attack of last year

[17-Apr-19 11:00 PM] phm87#7395
(I'm not comparing XVG to KMD, just attacks comparison)

[17-Apr-19 11:02 PM] phm87#7395
@Alright  I don't know if you read in this chan but it seems that double notas on BEER happened. It is fine if they nota the same chain. If there is a network split and that 2 different chains are notarized, it can be bad or ok ... it happened on mainet for OUR

[17-Apr-19 11:02 PM] Alright#0419
what do you mean you corrupt 7 people??

[17-Apr-19 11:03 PM] phm87#7395
and some NN had to update then it was fine

[17-Apr-19 11:03 PM] phm87#7395
For testing purposes, dwy and myself wanted to test bad things on testnet

[17-Apr-19 11:03 PM] Alright#0419
you convince them to notarize a bad chain or you attack their nodes to somehow "corrupt" them?

[17-Apr-19 11:03 PM] Alright#0419
go for it

[17-Apr-19 11:03 PM] phm87#7395
or break dpow I'm not sure

[17-Apr-19 11:03 PM] Alright#0419
just test on WLC üòõ

[17-Apr-19 11:04 PM] Alright#0419
BEER PIZZA and TXSCLCC are not good test cases

[17-Apr-19 11:04 PM] phm87#7395
I'm talking about testnet : it can be criminal to test it on mainet

[17-Apr-19 11:04 PM] phm87#7395
whatever the price of the AC is zero

[17-Apr-19 11:05 PM] phm87#7395
Can we add WLC on the testnet of NN or is it a bad idea ?

[17-Apr-19 11:08 PM] phm87#7395
yes but it is criminal to corrupt mainet NN operators : investors, community and coin dev will be furious and I'll go to jail with everyone here

[17-Apr-19 11:17 PM] phm87#7395
but I'd be happy to test it on testnet, I don't know why BEER PIZZA and TXSCLCC are not good test cases as Alright said

[17-Apr-19 11:20 PM] PHBA2061#2530
it might be "wrong" but not really "criminal" or "illegal" imo, the crypto legal framework is still uncompleted, and you can't really enforce it on an anonymous community
