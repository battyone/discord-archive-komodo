`looks at the current results of the ping table and concludes that the result will show that pings are relatively meaningless`
Don't understand I see the opposite. I'm going to use this thing to make a testnet of exactly the same nodes setup exactly the same. It defiantly does.

`Don't understand I see the opposite.`
If there were a correlation, then zat wouldn't have the least notarizations of the 4 loweset ping times.

[19-May-19 01:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not to mention the fact that your times are more than double that of smk's and only 2 notarizations difference

[19-May-19 01:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
small sample size so far, but indicates advantage to the spiky nodes. Average ping is a coarse metric, but shape clustering tells the story. I think ideally node ping shape should be as rotund as Jok3r's. The more superimopsed nodes you have on yours the better off you are. Joker's node is an outlier, and seems to bridge the gap between clusters.

[19-May-19 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There are too many variables to say that, the general correlation is there. Needs a controlled test. I've been using breaking and trying to fix this for a year with a very isolated node and making the wallet responds faster 100% definaly helps, when u have bad pings. So pings are a factor.

[19-May-19 01:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I'm going to use this thing to make a testnet of exactly the same nodes setup exactly the same. `
Doing that in LABS is what originally lead me to the same conclusion as you have, but I think pings are only a small indicator of a larger connectivity issue.

[19-May-19 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes 2 nodes blocked mine, I have 2 less connection that's why its so bad... Need a waybto detect what ones do that as well... This tool gives a way to detect that

[19-May-19 01:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
are you using some of the tweaks in your bag of tricks here @blackjok3r ?

[19-May-19 01:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

`nc <ip> <iguana port>`

[19-May-19 01:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pretty sure its using them all, maybe not tho, in any case it was first when in London and last in Tokyo, exactly the same setup... Its a vps image

[19-May-19 01:39 AM] Alright#0419
if it doesn't return anything, they don't have the port open

[19-May-19 01:39 AM] Alright#0419
if it doesn't return anything from one machine, but returns something from another IP, they blocked you

[19-May-19 01:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This gives us IPS other nodes have.

[19-May-19 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181

I suppose that it is possible that my maintenance routine is solely responsible for 30+% gains over zat, but still think it's highly unlikely to be so

[19-May-19 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its about how fast u can respond

[19-May-19 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ping affects that, I will find in the code where it does this and fix it

Of it really did take many cycles of multiple seconds, keeping a wallet.DAT 1mb or 10mb would.make 0 diff but we all know that's not the case

[19-May-19 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its converging recvmask too fast, we just need to slow it down 50%...

[19-May-19 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Doing that without making it something an op can just change back is the issue

[19-May-19 01:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Comparing nodes that are like 10ms diff in avg ping is ridiculous and doesnt answer anything btw

[19-May-19 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
10ms can be down to CPU speed... U need nodes like mine and @NutellaLicka  that are like 2-3x the pings... Then ping is the largest factor

[19-May-19 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In any case recvmask should not be a race... That's not how it should work.

[19-May-19 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If we take recmask being a race out of it, all nodes can easily run large reserves of utxos as well... It solves many many issues

[19-May-19 02:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`U need nodes like mine and @NutellaLicka that are like 2-3x the pings... Then ping is the largest factor`
I still don't see any math that can be applied to this data which that bears that out.

[19-May-19 02:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"generally speaking" nodes farther apart will "generally" connect together more slowly and "generally" transfer data slower
imo, that's an obvious conclusion and all that this really shows
I'm not seeing any way that x ping will result in y difference (outside of the obvious above)

[19-May-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm not sure anyone understands the actual cause of that... The best mask is calculated from the recvmask, but nodes with a higher average ping have a diffrent recvmask, and are thus left out of bestmask calculations. We need adequate time for recvmask so all nodes at least nodes in good condition have time to enter the recvmask. Otherwise they are simply left out of the rotation of 640 blocks.

[19-May-19 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no point spending but loads of money on dedicated high speed links, when this is a software bug

[19-May-19 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just need to find it. And if u guys won't help and just say there is no problem ill fixnit on my own

[19-May-19 04:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`And if u guys won't help and just say there is no problem ill fixnit on my own`
Then give me a way to help beyond telling me something other than what I'm seeing and/or "it's somewhere in the 1.8 million lines of code" 🤷🏽

Hi, I've been trying to run @Decker `address_gen` script and stuck on this error ```qt.qpa.screen: QXcbConnection: Could not connect to display :0.0

I've been searching for and trying many suggested solutions for a few hours with not luck.
Anyone have any hints?

```Follow this guide to generate all required info in your server```

Sorry haven't tried to use it so, can't say for sure. But its trying to use qt, which is a desktop GUI thing.

[19-May-19 05:53 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks.  I'll try that.

[19-May-19 06:14 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Sorry team, my details are finally on the map. They don't look great, to be expected. If ping under 1 second doesn't affect notarisations like jl has said, I'm unsure of what is causing the slow nota count. It seems with similar ping to @blackjok3r I have been getting very similar nota counts for weeks now. Which have been much lower than everyone else. I'm not saying that it proves anything, but could be evidence of what slow ping does.

[19-May-19 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
connectivity issues are far more relevant. granted, all else being equal, a faster ping is better

[19-May-19 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
but the big machine is needed simple to run many coin daemons

[19-May-19 08:59 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah I agree. My testnet machine isn't the most powerful and could be helped by upgrading. I still believe ping has played quite a big role in low nota's on average. 
On that note, unfortunately my provider in Brisbane wasn't able to service my request anymore and I have had to look around for another company. For a few reasons, and contrary to my original plan, I have had to go with a server provider out of Melbourne. As much as I wanted a node in Brisbane, I believe this still fulfills my intent of decentralizing the SH network by having a node outside of Sydney.

if I'm not mistaken `cleanwallettransactions` only removes spent tx, so it can't burn coins on tx fees ?
