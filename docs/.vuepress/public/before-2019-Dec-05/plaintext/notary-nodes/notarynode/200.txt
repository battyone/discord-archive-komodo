Igua Naping, isn't that a Samoan wrestler from the '80s?

[16-May-19 05:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
probably :abusedsmily:

[16-May-19 05:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
still need to make it quicker once i figure out how not to data race

[16-May-19 08:17 PM] phm87#7395
As bitcoin tx fee is raising, I'm wondering if it is possible that iguana uses one 3* bitcoin address instead of an old 1* address. BTC amount used as fee to notarise would be lower. (I don't want to talk about politics but I'd like to discuss how to enhance things.)
I heard that Knots have more options to configure this properly compared to bitcoin core.
Do you know if it is possible ?

[16-May-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it is possible, but I wont be making raw segwit tx in iguana

[16-May-19 08:39 PM] phm87#7395
with Knots, guys told me that bech32 isn't the default and we can personally define, which type of address is used for change address. (I don't use Knots myself.) Does it require to make raw segwit tx in iguana if change address is (forced to) P2SH type ?

[16-May-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
what is knots?

[16-May-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
if you want iguana to use segwit, iguana has to create raw segwit tx

[16-May-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
and not only for change, for the notarization

[16-May-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
oh and the daemon likely would need to rummage around in the witness data, parse it, match it up with the segwit tx

[16-May-19 08:40 PM] phm87#7395
Knots is an alternative implemntation of bitcoin

it doesnt have the abomination in it

[16-May-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
but you say you want to use segwit for notarizations

[16-May-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
which requires using segwit

[16-May-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
which requires changing all the notarization code

[16-May-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
i wont do it

[16-May-19 08:42 PM] phm87#7395
I didn't know that it requires so much work, sorry

[16-May-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
even if it didn require so much work, i wouldnt do it on principle

[16-May-19 08:50 PM] phm87#7395
so if I understand correctly, you won't accept a PR to add it ? (made by someone else as I don't have the competencies)
(in this discussion, I'm aiming to try to reduce costs of BTC tx fee paid, I don't want to bother you, sorry)

[16-May-19 08:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@phm87 do you have figures to support the premise of what it would save?

[16-May-19 08:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1 BTC a year? 2? 10?

[16-May-19 08:54 PM] phm87#7395
I can use google to find some figures. But I don't think that the same premise will be made on notarization. The change was performed on zpool and BTC fees were reduced a lot

[16-May-19 08:54 PM] phm87#7395
I'll dig to find the estimated numbers that they said

[16-May-19 08:55 PM] phm87#7395
(my pool is not paying in bitcoin so I didn't test anything myself)

[16-May-19 08:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
don't forget to factor in the cost of development and testing

[16-May-19 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
it would indeed save a lot of fees

[16-May-19 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
but we then will have codebase that is stuck on BTC and not so easy to change to a non-segwit chain

@kolo I assume that's what you meant by 'and your first node pubkey'?

[16-May-19 11:04 PM] kolo#1111
Why do you remove address of VOTEs?

[16-May-19 11:04 PM] kolo#1111
Your main pubkey, which will be your nodes pubkey

[16-May-19 11:05 PM] kolo#1111
Later will be manual how to get second one from same passphrase

[16-May-19 11:05 PM] kolo#1111
Have you ever run in testnet?

[16-May-19 11:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I didn't remove VOTEs address, just corrected the spelling that I didn't correct last time (plural to singular)
I assume(d) that vote addy wasn't the addy we'll actually be using on mainnet (that's why the election addy reads as it does)
I don't use passphrases
and yes, I've been a little active on testnet

[16-May-19 11:09 PM] kolo#1111

well it works. Hopefulyl a few more people can do it, and we can get a nice graph up. Need to work out some time to do it, maybe every 12H or every 24H, as long as everyone does it at the same or close to the same time.

[17-May-19 05:51 AM] mrlynch#5735
we can setup crons at utc times

[17-May-19 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
due to BTC mempool backlog each split should be for 50 to 100+ BTC utxo
also best to have a lot more than needed to ride out mempool backlogs, might help to split initial funds into several utxo so you can have a few splits pending at the same time

[17-May-19 10:20 AM] Strob#3417
Still no TXSCLCC for me since almost 3 days. After the election ended I restarted many times and had 2 half a day down times because 2 tech came in over 2 days to get rid of some problem with my phone lines. My router was replace for 2 routers (1 for the internet and 1 for the phone line). Anyway it seems the down times killed my TXSCLCC nota. Since I have done everything I could think of to make it restart (wallet reset, cleanwallettransactions, zawalllettxes, reindex). Yesterday I sent balance elsewhere, deleted everything, except my .conf, resynched without pubkey, once synched I set pubkey, imported priv key without rescan to get a tiny wallet and very fast time to list unspent. But I still get those zeros: "END isratify KMD.000000 TXSCLCC.0000000".

I'm tempted to rent a space inthat DC in germany and transfer there just to see what it does. Will the testnet be up enough long for me to try this?

I'll stay on the testnet until at least joining mainnet, if it's up.
