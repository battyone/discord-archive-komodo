OK I will resync

[01-Jun-19 08:02 AM] PHBA2061#2530
wait I meant notarizedhash & notarizedtxid of TXSCLCC, are those the correct ones ?

[01-Jun-19 08:03 AM] PHBA2061#2530

[01-Jun-19 08:50 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I think I'm on the wrong one, this is the latest notarized block #265262 <https://txsclcc.explorer.dexstats.info/block/0069b28f7c4075fb77bdb7ca84f4ea7b054109d55e9a875f341e481a3d92b8a4> , therefore `"notarized":` should be 265262 , is there anyone has `"notarized": 265262` , likely that is the correct one ? My node returns `"notarized": 265234` instead, an orphaned one ...
funny thing is I'm one of the nodes who sign the notarization in block 265262

[01-Jun-19 09:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I had no ntx on TXSCLCC for 12 hrs, debug showed some connections being banned

[01-Jun-19 09:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just cleared banned, stopped, now reindexing

[01-Jun-19 09:50 AM] CHMEX#0686
Did you compile latest?

[01-Jun-19 09:51 AM] CHMEX#0686
After that stop restart and it continues

[01-Jun-19 09:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
probably not if it was last few days... been a busy week!

[01-Jun-19 09:51 AM] CHMEX#0686
I guess we need a few more and than it will notarize again

[01-Jun-19 09:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll check once reindex sync stream stops

[01-Jun-19 10:42 AM] CrisF#3405
Same lack of notas here too.

[01-Jun-19 10:44 AM] CrisF#3405
`pindexOldTip->GetHeight().265229 > notarizedht 265234 && pindexFork->GetHeight().265240 is < notarizedht 265234, so ignore it
`

[01-Jun-19 10:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Also reindexing.

[01-Jun-19 11:37 AM] PHBA2061#2530
what does everyone get with `komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC getinfo | grep notarized` ?

@PHBA2061

[01-Jun-19 11:50 AM] PHBA2061#2530
ok so we both are the same

[01-Jun-19 11:51 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I suspect that we are bifurcating into 2 groups

[01-Jun-19 11:52 AM] CHMEX#0686
if there are less than 7 in each group it will not be notarized

[01-Jun-19 11:53 AM] CHMEX#0686
or thats the minsig now?

[01-Jun-19 11:54 AM] PHBA2061#2530
minsig is 11

[01-Jun-19 11:54 AM] CHMEX#0686
ah right

[01-Jun-19 12:12 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

it's been 1055 minutes since the last nota on TXSCLCC and on else than us noticed the problem ? 😂

how many blocks were created in that 1055 minutes?

[01-Jun-19 03:37 PM] PHBA2061#2530
blocks are created constantly, but no notarization since then, and I suspect that we are bifurcated, but I'm not 100% sure

CCL, KMDICE, COQUI

[01-Jun-19 07:33 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@zatJUM  resyncing probably won't help, if the problem we're facing is bifurcation of the whole network, not just a local data corruption or local fork

[01-Jun-19 07:36 PM] SHossain#0007

[01-Jun-19 07:37 PM] SHossain#0007
if you did resync, and ntrz didn't help, you need to restart iguana

scroll back 6 days ago, it looks really different

[01-Jun-19 07:40 PM] SHossain#0007
you are right. some nodes are not notarizing OUR and other ACs

[01-Jun-19 07:41 PM] NNoperator#3835
I have moved my node, so I thought it was just lack of  incoming peers.  But not so sure now.

[01-Jun-19 07:41 PM] SHossain#0007
i have 68 peers for OUR

[01-Jun-19 07:41 PM] SHossain#0007
other node has 60

[01-Jun-19 07:43 PM] NNoperator#3835
There is a pattern of loss of nodes for those specific ACs over the past 6 days or so.

[01-Jun-19 07:44 PM] SHossain#0007
yeah, i guess the ops have to check their nodes

[01-Jun-19 07:44 PM] SHossain#0007

what is your "notarizedhash" & "notarizedtxid"  & "connections" ?

[01-Jun-19 08:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the notarized bits are right, there's some issue with NNs not correcting the fork and banning everyone

I think yours will likeky return a different result than mine, just want to make sure

[01-Jun-19 08:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
notarized is notarized, they aren't going to return different results

[01-Jun-19 08:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the fork happened after that block and a restart of TXSCLCC should "fix" it

@jeezy   I am out of ideas.  I don't think we are forked or banned.  What is weird is that we are all non-participants in the same group of AC.  I think it is a serious issue, but I don't think their is much alarm being raised.
