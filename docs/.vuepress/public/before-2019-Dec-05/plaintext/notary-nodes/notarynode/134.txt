I see the error too and smk 762 too

[15-Apr-19 01:24 PM] CrisF#3405
Could the -26 have anything to do with an utxo split while a notarization is being setup?

I'm sorta confused.

[15-Apr-19 01:26 PM] gt#2812
i've been seeing them for a few days but it seems less possibly after people have gotten their wallets sorted

[15-Apr-19 01:26 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
pubkey and kmd wallet R address.. same thing ?

[15-Apr-19 01:26 PM] SHossain#0007
@Strob don't panic 😃 that happens from time to time

[15-Apr-19 01:26 PM] gt#2812
@Dr.Terminus  no they're different

[15-Apr-19 01:26 PM] SHossain#0007
@Dr.Terminus pubkey is btcpubkey which starts with 02 or 03

looks like that testnet.json file has all btc pubkeys, thought that btc wasnt needed for testnet..

[15-Apr-19 01:27 PM] CrisF#3405
You can do `validateaddress` to get a pubkey.

[15-Apr-19 01:27 PM] Strob#3417
Yes thanks @SHossain Dwy told me already it was not a concern but I was just answering to @blackjok3r

👍🏽 

[15-Apr-19 01:28 PM] SHossain#0007
use `validateaddress` command with the address you got to get the pubkey displayed
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE validateaddress RPCeZmqW4Aam52DFLmMraWtu5CuXPxqk92
```
This will display the following info from where you get the pubkey.
```
{
  "isvalid": true,
  "address": "RPCeZmqW4Aam52DFLmMraWtu5CuXPxqk92",
  "scriptPubKey": "76a91498b5caa42ffe9868844c51ba6e085e5e7e92fc2588ac",

```

[15-Apr-19 01:28 PM] SHossain#0007

that's the pubkey

that going to cause massive probs? ?

[15-Apr-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
-26 is a problem. we stsmped this out on mainnet just about totally.. I will be adding my logs scripts to iguana and checking who is doing them tomorrrow

[15-Apr-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it could be a bug, or it could be someone using spent utoxs due to a corrupt wallet.

[15-Apr-19 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they can also be caused from people restartingw while a nota is happening

[15-Apr-19 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but not in this number

[15-Apr-19 01:30 PM] gt#2812
@Dr.Terminus  you need to replace pubkey with your pubkey that you submit to testnet

[15-Apr-19 01:30 PM] SHossain#0007
you can start like this `./komodod -pubkey=02f183a71e93dfa7672ce7212187e45eabcf4077fed575348504b20295751ab1a2 -ac_name=BEER -ac_supply=100000000 -addnode=78.47.196.146 &`

[15-Apr-19 01:31 PM] CrisF#3405
Would an utxo split be similar in that regard as a restart, @blackjok3r ?  Causing trouble as the mask is forming?

[15-Apr-19 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no.

[15-Apr-19 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
split doesnt split alreadty split utxo

[15-Apr-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
a sendtoself, if you unlocked all utxos could do it I think. as the utxos would be spent by the time the ntoarisation round finished

[15-Apr-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but you really need to go out of your way to do that

[15-Apr-19 01:33 PM] CrisF#3405
Was asking because I had a couple -26 that seemed to stop a notarization I had going on.

[15-Apr-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
-26 is from any node participating in that round. It doesnt even mean that it was you. just taht someone/something mixed up utxos

[15-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Alright#0419
iguana needs peer bans

[15-Apr-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can log them, with some clever tricks. took weeks to get them working, lucky they still work and I didnt lose the scripts taht make it work.

[15-Apr-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that could work... but its impossible to know inside iguana itself who is doing it...

[15-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Alright#0419
how are you figuring out who it is?

[15-Apr-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
gettxout on each vin, then matching the address with -pubkey/Raddress

[15-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Alright#0419
and seeing if it's spent?

[15-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Alright#0419
that's it?

[15-Apr-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[15-Apr-19 01:35 PM] gt#2812
just got one

[15-Apr-19 01:36 PM] Strob#3417
mee too

[15-Apr-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant do this in iguana because it will slow it down I think, maybe we can check at the end of a round only if it failed... but what will happen is if all of thgem come up as spent all ndoes ban each other and ntoa stops... very bad

[15-Apr-19 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r looking at the raw, it seems the out is what's bad

checking if inputs are spent when it happens

[15-Apr-19 01:43 PM] CrisF#3405
How can I check that?

[15-Apr-19 01:43 PM] Alright#0419
when it happens, it prints raw hex of tx it tried to broadcast

[15-Apr-19 01:43 PM] Alright#0419
decoderawtransaction on that

[15-Apr-19 01:43 PM] Alright#0419
and look at it's inputs

[15-Apr-19 01:43 PM] Alright#0419
not sure those prints are there by default actually

[15-Apr-19 01:44 PM] Alright#0419
have a shit load of extra prints in my iguana, not sure if it's something I added or not

[15-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
so I'm still stuck trying to get pubkey from my new kmd wallet address

[15-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
not really certain how this validateaddress command works

[15-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
what I need filled in for ac=

@Dr.Terminus 
1. Do you know which R address you will use for this testnet? (KMD, BEER...)

[15-Apr-19 01:51 PM] CrisF#3405
That hex might be the wrong thing though. `dpow_sigcheck`

[15-Apr-19 01:51 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ok, I've got KMD R address, and corresponding pubkey now.. I know my KMD R address and pubkey, thats all so far

[15-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
cris you need to script it to check those inputs as it happens

[15-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
otherwise they might be spent by the time you actually check them

[15-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
but yes, that's it

not easy to set up. Also I made  detection for this on LABS igauan when CrisF had this problem there.

[15-Apr-19 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am guessing this problem comes from people over using cleanwalelt RPC

[15-Apr-19 01:57 PM] CrisF#3405
Is this the same thing then?

[15-Apr-19 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181

This will run a gettxout on all utxo in the wallet of every coin on iguana start.

[15-Apr-19 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and force exit if you have spent utxos

[15-Apr-19 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[15-Apr-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  can you make script that does similar thing? just looks gettxout on every thing in listunspent?

[15-Apr-19 02:03 PM] Alright#0419
check if listunspent is showing spent utxos?

[15-Apr-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. I did it in iguana, but id rather not need to send that upstream, its better to track down why this is happening

gettxout uses coincache
