but in same time all gates opened on the seed node

[23-Mar-19 05:24 PM] starfleet#5156
so you run two servers in parallel, one for the chain traffic?

[23-Mar-19 05:24 PM] starfleet#5156
and one for the notary job

[23-Mar-19 05:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
yup first notary and second to share p2p and use it for external tools

[23-Mar-19 05:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
keeping the notary isolated from anything else that what it is supposed to do

[23-Mar-19 05:29 PM] starfleet#5156
Nice approach. I didnt think that far.

@lukechilds is that tmux in a screen?

[24-Mar-19 12:49 AM] lukechilds#2707

@lukechilds last time I did oclvanity - it took 9 days to grab a result and send it to /dev/null beacause I did a mistake in output handling. Dont be like me üòÉ

[24-Mar-19 01:09 AM] kolo#1111
Wanted to make it check both BTC addr header and KMD addr header to find  good NN pubkey. Yet had no time for this.

[24-Mar-19 01:10 AM] kolo#1111
4 symbols match in both should be solvable in a light year

[24-Mar-19 01:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
Lol

[24-Mar-19 01:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah that sounds very hard to find

[24-Mar-19 02:38 AM] Strob#3417
Hi all, I'm almost done but I'm stuck on this one in the gamecredits installation section: gamecredits-cli importprivkey GAMEwif
# replace GAMEwif with the key you received earlier (like: UvCbPGo2B5QHKgMN5KFRz10sMzbTSXunRTLB9utqGhNFUZrJrEWa)

[24-Mar-19 02:39 AM] Strob#3417
Where was I supposed to get a GAMEwif key?

[24-Mar-19 02:39 AM] Strob#3417
I tried with with the BTCDwif but it says Invalid private key encoding.

[24-Mar-19 03:37 AM] NNoperator#3835
Decker created a tool that can show a NN operator the WIFs for all of our different coins (genkomodo.php).  It is in his GIT repository.  https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo_scripts

[24-Mar-19 08:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
@kolo could you remind me (and here) the limit date for updated git repos for candidates plz ? :)

[24-Mar-19 08:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
I thought I read 1st april but maybe I dreamed of it... and I don t want to give bad info

[24-Mar-19 08:58 AM] kolo#1111
1st April is my strongest recommendation

[24-Mar-19 09:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
thanks ^^. was warning future candidates that they should not forget that date to be eligible

[24-Mar-19 09:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
a side question (because it was asked also) does that date match with the region selection or can candidate just wait for airdrop to point at a region ?

[24-Mar-19 09:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
(my first thought was that the git should contain this info : has to be mentionned before 1st april)

[24-Mar-19 09:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
people start talking about strategy and region choice. and as there is no way to use Z this year, and reallocating between final addresses is not allowed... the effective region stopdate should be clear

[24-Mar-19 09:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
(to me it is... the 1st april too)

[24-Mar-19 09:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
that also enforces the display of pairs : region/voteAddress

[24-Mar-19 09:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
and not just voteaddress without regions

[24-Mar-19 09:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
(am trying to guide or at least retranscribe this to french channel)

[24-Mar-19 09:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
making sure noone is left behind

[24-Mar-19 10:17 AM] kolo#1111
Again, only strongest recommendation, but I want to see all wallets/regions/description in github proposal on 1st April and not later than 14th April. Same as airdrop. Winners by notarization announced closer to that date also.

[24-Mar-19 10:19 AM] kolo#1111
Idea this year was to keep maximum distance from elections politics, affecting only technical side - to show elections are as fair as possible.

[24-Mar-19 10:21 AM] kolo#1111
I wanted, and now know how to make VOTE address strictly attached to the proposed notary pubkey, but missed time to make it this year. This will prove each VOTE address is for one exact region, exact node. And address will be unspendable.

[24-Mar-19 10:24 AM] kolo#1111
Sad thing is I don‚Äôt see clear info about nodes/addresses in github proposals. And doubt we will have 32/64 proposals correctly filled before 1st apr

[24-Mar-19 10:26 AM] kolo#1111
Spots per region are equal, 8 spots. But watching competitors is non trivial task now, as there is no central list at all.

[24-Mar-19 04:10 PM] Alright#0419
@kolo using an address like we discussed yesterday makes it unspendable. If the worry about using one of these unspendable addresses is that we can't tie them directly to an identity, we could require signing a message from the real pubkey saying "this is my VOTE address"

[24-Mar-19 06:02 PM] Strob#3417
@Mylo Hi Mylo thanks for your reply but when I enter "git clone git@github.com:DeckerSU/komodo_scripts.git" I get this error: "Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have to correct access rights and the repository exists."

[24-Mar-19 06:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
use https

[24-Mar-19 06:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
browse to the repo and just get the https clone url then git clone it

[24-Mar-19 06:04 PM] Strob#3417
I did that but then the next 2 lines don't work

[24-Mar-19 06:05 PM] Strob#3417
Do I have to add the git repo address for the next 2 lines to work?

[24-Mar-19 06:05 PM] Strob#3417

[24-Mar-19 06:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
just git clone the base directory then theorically instructions are provided

[24-Mar-19 06:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
you need php-cli if I remember correctly

[24-Mar-19 06:07 PM] Strob#3417
yes I installed it but the it requires modules. I don't get how to install those modules

[24-Mar-19 06:07 PM] Strob#3417
submodules

[24-Mar-19 06:09 PM] Strob#3417
Ah ok found it I just need to cd komodo_scripts !

[24-Mar-19 06:10 PM] Strob#3417
thanks dwy!

Man installing a NN is like solving a puzzle! lol!

[24-Mar-19 07:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
the thing is

[24-Mar-19 07:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
this puzzle completes (... but will never be 100% completed lol) after you see the interaction between iguana and rounds of ntrz etc.

[24-Mar-19 07:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
it s really important to get very very angry and spend X hours or minutes on a stupid thing

[24-Mar-19 07:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
cause you ll KNOW you won t be tricked again by that same exact thing.

[24-Mar-19 07:48 PM] Deleted User#0000

[24-Mar-19 07:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
next time you will have an issue launching commands the first thing you will check is pwd :p

[24-Mar-19 07:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
your end goal is to have iguana running and telling you you can t notarize cause your pub is rejected

[24-Mar-19 07:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
that will mean if you get a spot, replace the message saying bad pub by : hey , you made it ^^

At least I learn so many things, it's exciting! I went successfully through 99.99% of the setup, in fact now only the last line seems buggy. "cd ~/komodo/src && ./dpowassets" but there is no dpowassets script in this folder... there is one in the SuperNET/iguana folder, should I run this one instead?

[24-Mar-19 08:28 PM] NNoperator#3835
The dpowassets was moved.  You found it!  the one in SuperNET is what you want @Strob

So I went through all the guide üíØ % now! I get connection refused I guess because I'm not elected, I didn't funded my btc addresss or I didn't send some info to kolo and james. But I guess I was able to set it up all. I will submit my proposal's pull request this week! thanks all for your help!

is the VOTE  coin distribution the same as it was last year ?

[24-Mar-19 09:52 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
1:1 KMD for VOTE?

[25-Mar-19 12:36 AM] NNoperator#3835
Not the tallied results.  I wanted to check specific transactions.  I voted for all the participants in the testnet last year, and I think some of the winners (who offered reward sharing) are sending KMD to some of my VOTE change addresses.

[25-Mar-19 12:48 AM] Mylo#8306
@Strob what happens when you reboot?

[25-Mar-19 12:49 AM] Mylo#8306
does it all come back the way it went down?   üòõ

i just had a machine (test box) reboot a week ago, but daemon didn't come back..... fixed now.

@Dr.Terminus  VOTE2019 is going to  be distributed 1:1 KMD like last year.  Make sure you control your address' privkeys

[25-Mar-19 12:02 PM] Mylo#8306
election site has most of the stuff there including the rules afaik

[25-Mar-19 05:44 PM] Strob#3417
@Mylo Hi Mylo! When I reboot nothing is started automatically yet. I haven't setup it that way yet. I need to type these again:

[25-Mar-19 05:44 PM] Strob#3417
./start
CTRL-C
cd komodo/src
./assetchains
# and wait 15 minutes before you go to the next step
cd ~/SuperNET/iguana
git checkout dev && git pull && ./m_notary &
# wait until you see `INIT with 64 notaries`
./dpowassets

[25-Mar-19 05:45 PM] Mylo#8306
what is your scripting like?

[25-Mar-19 05:48 PM] Strob#3417
What do you mean?

[25-Mar-19 05:55 PM] Mylo#8306
when you start iguana, modify `m_notary_run` so it logs to a file

this is near the top of `m_notary_run`
```
iguana_arg=${2:-notary}
stdbuf -oL $1 ../agents/iguana $iguana_arg  & #> iguana.log 2> error.log  &
```
make it look like this
```
iguana_arg=${2:-notary}
stdbuf -oL $1 ../agents/iguana $iguana_arg  > iguana.log 2> error.log  &
```

when you have an iguana.log file, it's easier to work with.

[25-Mar-19 05:56 PM] Mylo#8306
just remove `& #` before the `>`.

[25-Mar-19 05:57 PM] Mylo#8306
you'll then end up with a log file at `~/SuperNET/iguana/iguana.log` you can read

[25-Mar-19 06:00 PM] Mylo#8306
use `crontab -e` and put
```
@reboot /home/me/bin/start_kmd.sh
```
and then make a file `/home/me/bin/start_kmd.sh` with
```
#!/bin/bash
komodod &
```
to start off with.

Also make sure komodod is in your path
```
ln -sf /home/me/komodo/src/komodod /usr/local/bin/
```
to make a sym-link.

Then reboot, see if komodo comes back up.  (iguana won't we haven't made a script for it)

[25-Mar-19 06:00 PM] Mylo#8306
if it works, tell the next person.

[25-Mar-19 06:01 PM] Mylo#8306
`chmod +x /home/me/bin/start_kmd.sh` to make it executable...sorry i forgot

[25-Mar-19 06:02 PM] Mylo#8306
scripting = bash scripts, simple things like the `start_kmd.sh` one.   there'll be others üòÑ

[25-Mar-19 06:03 PM] Strob#3417
Ok cool tx. I already put komodod in my path. I'll uncomment that log file creation and create a startup script for komodod like you say when I have some time. I have some job to finish today. Maybe tonight.

[25-Mar-19 06:04 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah cool, you've got a week or two.  knock those easy housekeeping things out of the way while you can
