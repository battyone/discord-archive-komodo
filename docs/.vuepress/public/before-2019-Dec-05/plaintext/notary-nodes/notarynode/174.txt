So 14 min sig?

[27-Apr-19 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can do 14, mainnet used it alst year

[27-Apr-19 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or year before

[27-Apr-19 10:18 AM] NNoperator#3835
```does this happen on mainnet?```   with 13 participants not likely.  We have seen it but rarely

[27-Apr-19 10:19 AM] NNoperator#3835
only when nodes were not updating

[27-Apr-19 10:19 AM] Alright#0419
if it does happen on mainnet, this seems not to be a problem

[27-Apr-19 10:19 AM] Alright#0419
just a quirk

[27-Apr-19 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It really doesnt do anything apart form waste a tiny amount of coins.

[27-Apr-19 10:19 AM] Alright#0419
oh "only when nodes were not updating"

[27-Apr-19 10:19 AM] Alright#0419
that's what we're kind of trying to figure out

[27-Apr-19 10:19 AM] SHossain#0007
lazy solution, remove BEER and add another TXSCLx chain

so should we update now?

[27-Apr-19 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can update komodo jl777/dev branch now yes

[27-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Alright#0419

we might be lowering it shortly after though if the network just dies

[27-Apr-19 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you will need at least 2 days to get any decent data at all

changing it back too fast will make thigns far worse

lol... well the only way to test this 100% properly, is to run recvmask for BEER (after dpow added) at the exact same time on all nodes 2s apart at the start of each round and see who cant see who. Very very hard to coordinate if not impossible

basically need a testnet of 20 nodes you own yourself, all connected together with a script doing ssh to all them at once

[27-Apr-19 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for what reason? :troll:

[27-Apr-19 10:25 AM] Alright#0419
it seems it's not a problem overall, but worth investigating

[27-Apr-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well Im telling you my theory, but I cant know that I'm right, its  theory only from my observations and reading the code.

[27-Apr-19 10:28 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Do all test NN's need to update komodo?

[27-Apr-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you should do, but it wont stop it from working if you do not

you can just use stop on the one chain, do make -j8. If that fails, then do build.sh

Decentralized trustless oracles (DTO) by piggybacking on timestamp...
Trustless oracles are quite a difficult problem, at least it was until I came up with a simple method that implements them.

[27-Apr-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
above explains timestamps too

@NNoperator shouldn't matter

[27-Apr-19 11:02 AM] NNoperator#3835
Will there be a change before we get 7 nodes ?

[27-Apr-19 11:06 AM] NNoperator#3835
or just a few nodes putting checkpoints onto BEER will fix it?

[27-Apr-19 11:10 AM] Alright#0419
that likely has nothing to do with the double notarizations as we see it happening on PIZZA as well

[27-Apr-19 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your node will now see chackpoints on BEER and print NOTARIZED that is the only diffrence.

[27-Apr-19 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
before it ignored them and reorgs coul;d happen

[27-Apr-19 11:12 AM] NNoperator#3835
well a notarization just went through,  mrlynch's node participated, as did Cris'

[27-Apr-19 11:13 AM] Alright#0419

[27-Apr-19 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no BEER isnt a ac_cc=2 chain or higher so no MoMoM.

[27-Apr-19 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the 0's indcate a round started and consensus was not reached. That is normal behaviour unless its happening on every single round for hours.

[27-Apr-19 11:18 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I'm not an expert , but I think the double nota has something to do with iguana, rather than komodod

[27-Apr-19 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its iguana yes.
