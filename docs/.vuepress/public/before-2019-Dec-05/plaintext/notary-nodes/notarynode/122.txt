splitfunds wasn't picking up the utxo to split after funding after import false

just acsplit it

[13-Apr-19 04:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
basically you know you want enough utxos and take into account the fact that if you ntrz they just get consumed. splitting on a basic amount and scheduling the estimated nulber of utxos you would need is the way to go. seems utxosplitter does that thing. it may be configureable.
I d recommend at first to stick to basic call and not scripts if you want to understand

[13-Apr-19 04:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
cause honestly, consolidate, acsplit, manage utxos and acsplit is pretty easy to understand, the order matters.

[13-Apr-19 04:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
do it manually with 100 utxos a few days

it remains, but those errors are supposed to be far less often than before

[13-Apr-19 05:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
sometimes I believe it s just a node restarting

[13-Apr-19 05:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
in a full ntrz round, but maybe that s not related, but it would make sense.

[13-Apr-19 05:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just restarted chains, but left iguana running,

[13-Apr-19 05:08 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I had a question about doing that for the more experienced iguana users. Should we pause a chain in iguana before doing anything to the daemon, and restart once the daemon is fully back online? Or will iguana handle that fine automatically?

[13-Apr-19 05:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
seems to handle it fine afaik

[13-Apr-19 05:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
doesnt like being started without chains running tho

How much did voters get per vote on average last year, I wonder...

[13-Apr-19 05:15 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The idea @ch6ris is that there is more benefit to put those funds towards development, marketing, creating projects, etc. As this would in turn make the komodo community more valuable as a whole.

many are putting a portion back to the ecosystem and ensuring that they can provide to the integrity of the network

[13-Apr-19 05:18 AM] ch6ris#5240
Alright, thanks everyone. So unlikely anyone offering pay per vote will win a spot.

[13-Apr-19 05:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Not necessarily, they could quite easily get a spot if they have some backing.

[13-Apr-19 05:20 AM] CHMEX#0686
there are some with rev share one up to 50% imo it does more harm than good. The funds used should be used to make the eco system stronger...

[13-Apr-19 05:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
basic logic is that you're more likely to see increased value from ecosystem growth rising KMD price that the fraction of a token you'd get from NN revshare
