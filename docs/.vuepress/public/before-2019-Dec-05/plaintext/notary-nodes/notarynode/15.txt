hello guys

[30-Jul-18 05:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im getting notice about EQL chain being forked

[30-Jul-18 05:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
./komodo-cli -ac_name=EQL getblockhash 63872

[30-Jul-18 05:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok... notaries seem to be in the same chain

[30-Jul-18 05:53 PM] Mylo#8306
`curl -s  https://komodostats.com/api/notary/summary.json  | jq '.[] | select(.ac_name =="EQL")' `

ooooh `bestblockhash` is handy  thanks

are there new iguana bootup parameters?

[31-Jul-18 07:52 AM] jeezy#3408
iguana_arg=${2:-notary}
stdbuf -oL $1 ../agents/iguana -nosplit $iguana_arg  & #> iguana.log 2> error.log  &

[31-Jul-18 07:52 AM] jeezy#3408
like this?

[31-Jul-18 08:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jeezy I just added it to allow passing nosplit without having to fork the repo or hack the codebase:

Allow passing custom args to iguana by lukechilds · Pull Request ...
This allows people to pass custom arguments to iguana without having to fork and maintain their own repo and keep it up to date with upstream.
This is a backwards compatible change, default behavio...

btw if you're not sure about why code was changed, view the file in github, press the blame button and it will show you the commit for that line with the commit message explaining why it was changes (normally also linked to a PR/issue with further discussion)

[31-Jul-18 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@patchkez  I have subbmitted PR to komodo-tools repo. Updated all of a-teams scripts we are using and fixed my mess. Taken a few days and a lot of node down time, but its finally sorted out. 😅

[31-Jul-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that change to m_notary/_run still needs some work too... I had to manually merge that in for my fork, it was a breaking change to the way i am handling that... I guess I need to create a complete own iguana launcher like dragonriders did.

[31-Jul-18 08:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a few ideas there... Might explore soon, but node needs some time to recover after all those restarts. 😦

[31-Jul-18 09:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
for consolidating mining utxos

[31-Jul-18 09:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm constructing a manual TX

[31-Jul-18 09:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
can I just set the output amount to the sum of all the inputs

[31-Jul-18 09:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
AKA 0 fee

[31-Jul-18 09:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
or will that never confirm?

[31-Jul-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you dont

thats a modification to @Decker  script that we use. It will withdraw to cold storage, whenever the mined balance is over 3 blocks of KMD. I have it on cron every 2H. I will increase that out once f4a is removed.

[31-Jul-18 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its been running without issue for weeks now, not a single failed TX.

[31-Jul-18 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im usless at git, so have no idea how to submit a PR with the right changes but I just created this, which seems to work.
```#!/bin/bash
# We don't add BEER/PIZZA to iguana so skip them, more skips can be added, mauybe this can be pulled as a prarm from assetchains.json
declare -a skip=("BEER" "PIZZA")

# Loop through assetchains.json and build the path to the approptiate coins file and run it.
~/komodo/src/listassetchains | while read chain; do
  if [[ " ${skip[@]} " =~ " ${chain} " ]]; then
    pointless=0
  else
    coin="coins/$(echo $chain | awk '{print tolower($0)}')_7776"
    $coin
  fi
done

#add VRSC manually as its not listed in the assetchains.json
coins/vrsc_7776```

[31-Jul-18 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This will automatically start all coins for iguana from the `assetchains.json` in komodo repo.

[31-Jul-18 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the idea being james doesn't need to manually add coins to `m_notary_run` any more, so its no longer required to constantly change that file, so we can have our own modifications and not have to manually merge them all the time. 😄

[31-Jul-18 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I made a few other changes to its stucture but want to test them first... not restarting my node again today. its on suicide mode as it is.

[31-Jul-18 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it just uses no fee 😕

[31-Jul-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sure

[31-Jul-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think

[31-Jul-18 10:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
I expected it to work tbh

[31-Jul-18 10:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
you will just be low priority

[31-Jul-18 10:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm using a 0.0002 txfee anyway, just to make sure I get my UTXO back quickly if I need to split for iguana

[31-Jul-18 10:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
BTC nodes normally won't relay 0 fee TXs but even that is just a config setting, not a consensus rule

[31-Jul-18 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I found out that KMD sent to your Notary address as change wint be split by iguana... my node was down to 6 UTXO until i sent it to myself.

[31-Jul-18 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
internetingly though, if its change from a splitfund, it will work 😕

[31-Jul-18 11:06 AM] Mylo#8306
i ran out of UTXOs today.  i did a wallet clean out and wallet was locked.  first time i left iguana running, usually i turn it off.  3 hours of no ntz.

[31-Jul-18 11:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
I always leave it running when cleaning out a wallet

[31-Jul-18 11:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think it's normal to take a while to get back to speed

[31-Jul-18 11:08 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah but wallet was locked on kmd restart.  iguana couldn't split funds.

[31-Jul-18 11:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
_I think_ the other nodes blacklist you for a while for not responding, that's just an assumption though

[31-Jul-18 11:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
ohhh, gotcha

[31-Jul-18 11:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
why was your wallet locked?

[31-Jul-18 11:09 AM] Mylo#8306
nah we just blacklist you :trollface:

[31-Jul-18 11:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
:trollface:

[31-Jul-18 11:09 AM] Mylo#8306
dunno why it locked.  i thought maybe cos kmd stopped and restarted?

[31-Jul-18 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you keep shutting down your iguana or stop responding you fefinatly get blacklisted... I dunno how or where in the code, but it happens... Mine was making 80% of BTC notarizations yesterday, restarted and its pretty much cdead now

[31-Jul-18 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
changed nothing

[31-Jul-18 11:11 AM] Decker#3767
what does it mean "locked wallet"? komodod unable to spent every utxo or what?

[31-Jul-18 11:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
My KMD wallet's at 7MB but too scared to clean out cos my node's on fire

[31-Jul-18 11:12 AM] Decker#3767
Usually i clean my wallet after 20-25 Mb ...

[31-Jul-18 11:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
I try and keep it under 10

[31-Jul-18 11:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I think I have a slower server than most people here

[31-Jul-18 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
under 10 seems to be the go to stay boosting along

[31-Jul-18 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but if you take it down too many times, or for too long you lose almost a day

[31-Jul-18 11:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
yep, I was doing it once a week

[31-Jul-18 11:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
but now I've made more perf improvements I'm getting more KMD txs so hitting 10MB way faster

[31-Jul-18 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with @webworker01 mining every single AC without ondemand blocks, wallets going to get super fat really quick.

[31-Jul-18 11:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah I stopped mining cos it was fucking with my UTXOs and wallet.dats

[31-Jul-18 11:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
ACs are super lean now

[31-Jul-18 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine to another pubkey with a seperate node./VM is the only way to mine AC.

[31-Jul-18 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems it wont be required soon, too mnay others starting to mine them externally now

[31-Jul-18 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[31-Jul-18 11:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
what specs?

[31-Jul-18 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dwy and chainmakers NA are same specs...

[31-Jul-18 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
look at diffrence

[31-Jul-18 11:19 AM] Decker#3767
btw, is somebody here who using ramdisk to store wallet.dat or entire blockchain? does it significantly improoves nota count?

[31-Jul-18 11:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
it did for me

[31-Jul-18 11:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I also did a lot of other optimisations around the same time

[31-Jul-18 11:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
so hard to tell

[31-Jul-18 11:20 AM] Decker#3767
@lukechilds only wallet.dat on ramdisk or entire chain?

[31-Jul-18 11:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
entire chain O.O

[31-Jul-18 11:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
entire `~/.komodo` folder

[31-Jul-18 11:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
hehe

[31-Jul-18 11:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
KMD and all ACs

[31-Jul-18 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have the entire `.komodo` folder in ram disk, but compared to reducing UTXO from 700 to less than 150

[31-Jul-18 11:20 AM] Decker#3767
👍

[31-Jul-18 11:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
crazy stuff

[31-Jul-18 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its hardly any diff

[31-Jul-18 11:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, I think UTXOs made a huge difference for me

[31-Jul-18 11:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
and wallet.dat

[31-Jul-18 11:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
I jsut did ramdisk around the same time

[31-Jul-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
UTXO and wallet.dat on slower system is 1000% improvemtn
