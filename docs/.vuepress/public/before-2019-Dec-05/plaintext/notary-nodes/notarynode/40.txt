Honestly, I expect very little use/abuse of this.

[06-Mar-19 11:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You all are awesome and helpful and wonderful people... likely too busy to be gaming the system.

@Alright i already cleared everything with you in DM few months back if i remember correctly.

[06-Mar-19 11:38 PM] Alright#0419
Don't quite remember how that went

[06-Mar-19 11:38 PM] Alright#0419
was it moved to Asia?

[06-Mar-19 11:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Then again, I don't rely on this for income, I am doing it to strengthen the system.
So it's reasonable that I have another view.  I am sure there will be vote buying and those people will be fine with it... all involved because "The code allows for it"  :P

Then again, isn't the notary node system about strengthening the ecosystem and Komodo and not personal gain?

It was interesting last year,  there were several very vocal KMD holders practically demanding that NN candidate buy their votes by allowing them to receive a cut of the mining rewards.  It is all there in Bitcoin talk forum.  P Trump was one whale who displayed inordinate amounts of ownership privilege.

[06-Mar-19 11:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Dang, really?

[06-Mar-19 11:41 PM] Alright#0419
yes, many of the notary's rev share with their voters

[06-Mar-19 11:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I seem to remember that actually... and then again... we sort of are too.  
We plan to give back to active community members...

Yes I see that point, then again, Chain recipients were supporting their efforts to support the ecosystem. That's not exactly vote buying, that'sindirectly rewarding supporters.

[06-Mar-19 11:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That's fine morally I think but some would disagree with that too.

if you can't code your morals, don't expect anyone to follow them

[06-Mar-19 11:45 PM] Alright#0419
someone code kolo into a CC

[06-Mar-19 11:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Noone came in expecting anyone to follow my morals or anyone elses.
Just speaking my mind, like we are all allowed to here.  

Emmanuel is right, I am certain.   While I can't code that myself, I am sure finding someone to code CC into VoteTokens is possible.

[06-Mar-19 11:46 PM] NNoperator#3835
I used a good portion of my voting power to reward the participants of the testnet.  I felt that was fair.

[06-Mar-19 11:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Emm - even then, How To can be setup to teach people to vote.  :troll:

[06-Mar-19 11:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Im just gonna be clear, ANY community or VOTER based rewards post election are fantastic.  They foster Community, long term interest and a reminder that things happen in teh ecosystem.
What I think sucks is "Hey man, you got any Vote2019 tokens to sell me?   Buying X amount for Y KMD."  That just sucks.  Doesn't mean I can do anything about it but I can talk about it.

Are you going to run Emmanuel ?

[06-Mar-19 11:53 PM] Alright#0419
you had a year to make proposals to change how it works, and you waited until the month prior to suggest them

I'm just saying that in the last year, we've received a lot of criticism about dPoW and notary nodes being centralized

[07-Mar-19 12:01 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Yeah I think that's one concern, if team members are running a majority of nodes, it gives critics a lot of ammo against us

[07-Mar-19 12:01 AM] Daniel CP#2020
In the marketing team's minds, the NN should be something we promote far and wide to bring in new devs to the ecosystem, try to grow, try to get new talented people involved

`I'm just saying that in the last year, we've received a lot of criticism about dPoW and notary nodes being centralized, controlled by the Komodo team....`
üëÜ This is my concern mainly and this vote issue is just one giant opening in the armor.

[07-Mar-19 12:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I actually think Team members running on solid platforms can strengthen the ecosystem.

They provide themselves with more funding to work on KMD that much more.

[07-Mar-19 12:03 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I realize that the NN operators are important for the security of the ecosystem so they need to be somewhat trusted but we should also consider this as an opportunity to demonstrate how open the ecosystem is and try to get more people to join our ranks

[07-Mar-19 12:04 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Yeah I agree guys @Deleted User @FishyGuts 

There have been some good examples of new-ish people getting involved and contributing a lot to the KMD ecosystem

[07-Mar-19 12:04 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Would just like to see more of that

[07-Mar-19 12:05 AM] Daniel CP#2020
More free market competition, if you will

[07-Mar-19 12:05 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Not just rent-seeking

[07-Mar-19 12:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
At any rate, we will run for 2 nodes with node rewards distributed to KMD projects and ecosystem contributors. 
Our platform is privacy and legitimate privacy enabled ecommerce.
Only 20% of the rewards are going to go to the operator, and lets hope KMD holds these price levels or that will drop due to server costs üòõ

[07-Mar-19 12:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Even if nothing changes this year, I am glad that you guys acknowledge and talk about it openly.

[07-Mar-19 12:08 AM] Daniel CP#2020

I'm making no secret about voting a few Komodoshis for @Alright and LAbS Notary node.   We're giving 5% of our node earnings each month to them for notarization costs, if we win.  While it won't save them, every little bit helps.
Joker, Alright and the crew were used to get Pirate safe & sound and we are grateful. It's the least we could do.

[07-Mar-19 01:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
How many candidates are ready to publish or start composing/publsh their proposals?

[07-Mar-19 01:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Its pretty simple. "Chainmakers is the forest gump of komodo".

We have been there on every important moment.

[07-Mar-19 01:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I myself from Meshbits team is NOT participating in this election.
And since both our nodes are in bottom, expect us NOT auto-reelected.
But, I wish to support and see this proposal submissions and management as much community managed as possible.

[07-Mar-19 01:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So, trying my efforts/contributions.

[07-Mar-19 01:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

@Deleted User I don't care about Microsoft, if the website is community managed and we can audit any mistakes via git commits

[07-Mar-19 01:43 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I am very honored that you would invite me. 

I'm not sure what it would entail, and am just trying to keep up with my existing tasks at the moment.

But i thought Kolo asked to set it up last year's repo

[07-Mar-19 02:04 AM] PTYX#6840
should notaries make the application to meshbits or kolo's repo?

[07-Mar-19 02:10 AM] PTYX#6840
non-official could be confusing

[07-Mar-19 02:10 AM] PTYX#6840
sticking with one place could be the best

[07-Mar-19 02:15 AM] PTYX#6840
it's important that we start off on the right foot and make sure this round of elections is more organized than last year. that means having one point of entry for the notary applicants, one place for users to see and evaluate the applicants, and one place to vote.

[07-Mar-19 02:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Automatically syncs with the Gitbook
It does not matter if I edit it or someone from the community edits it.
All changes are visible on public Git commits
I don't think if anyone messes with this process, that person can just get away with it without taking their actions responsibility.
Hence my preference of Github websites
