dont do it

[03-May-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
in the first year, we didnt have enough operators, so there were some that ran nodes for others. it was a gray area, but needed for the first year

[03-May-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
now we certainly dont need this, so not sure why we are trying to push then envelope in this area

[03-May-19 04:51 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Fair enough, the first year was the first year. This year is this year. 
If you're not sure what the confusion is, you aren't sure what the situation is then.

[03-May-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
likely it would just confuse voters and you wouldnt get elected in both spots

[03-May-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
the rule is clear enough, cant be in control of 2 nodes in same region

[03-May-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
what is unclear about that?

[03-May-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
if you run a node as an ISP for another node, you arent in control of it

[03-May-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are saying there are candidates looking for loopholes to take advantage of, then this is indeed a surprise to me and I wont support them at all

[03-May-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
are you looking for loopholes to take advantage of?

[03-May-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
do you want to push things close to the edge and risk losing your spot?

[03-May-19 04:53 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
That is not what I am saying at all. You've misinterpreted what my discussion has been about

[03-May-19 04:59 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It's not about losing my spot JL, it's about understanding the intent of running a NN. You've clearly answered my discussion point by saying `the rule is clear enough, cant be in control of 2 nodes in same region` but I find this in contradiction to what @kolo has said `If sysadmin as hired sysadmin - that’s not a problem as long, as you’re not a single person for both nodes.`
Please provide me with a better understanding of the NN candidate rules if I am completely out of the ball park here.

[03-May-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
if you manage a system for someone else, it is ok as long as you dont control it

[03-May-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
imagine the ISP role, done by one NN for another

[03-May-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the exeption

[03-May-19 05:00 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
The specific situation I am referring to is that KomodoPioneers have auto relected into SH and cakeshop are running for a spot in SH. Mylo runs both nodes. Mylo is apart of both teams.

[03-May-19 05:01 PM] SHossain#0007
Mylo is the sysadmin of Pioneers

[03-May-19 05:01 PM] SHossain#0007
he is just operating

[03-May-19 05:01 PM] SHossain#0007
not controlling

[03-May-19 05:02 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
`cant be in control of 2 nodes in same region`??

[03-May-19 05:02 PM] SHossain#0007
`if you run a node as an ISP for another node, you arent in control of it`

I think trying to lock down access to keys would be futile

[03-May-19 05:51 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you give them enough control to be able to do anything useful, they will  likely also be able to get hold of the keys if they try hard enough

[03-May-19 05:51 PM] Alright#0419

you can dump the WIF from iguana, how will you restrict that?

[03-May-19 05:52 PM] SHossain#0007
how will you add and launch new coin for dPoW without importing key?

[03-May-19 05:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you literally just whitelist a couple of scripts then I wouldn't consider that giving them enough control to do anything useful

[03-May-19 05:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
may aswell just be a cron job

[03-May-19 05:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you give them enough control to do anything useful, they can likely abuse that control to get access to keys

yeah force a menu...but exactly, it's not a toy.  needs a mechanic

a restricted shell is okay for team members so they can run a few commands, but for serious stuff - cannot imo

[03-May-19 06:32 PM] phm87#7395
I used TeamCity to run scripts (without being in the same subnetwork of the rest of the pool). I think that it can be useful to operate and monitor from a phone but I agree that debugging and some maintenance operations cannot be performed with scripts. Some good miners had some access to the TeamCity of test-pools (to add coins themselves with a button and a form). Ideas of such scripts exist into yiimp:

So what's happening? Almost 10 hours since last notarization...

[04-May-19 12:10 AM] PHBA2061#2530
not enough bestmatches , we need  2-3 more

[04-May-19 12:19 AM] Strob#3417
Not long ago it seems like we had more than enough but now it's lower.

[04-May-19 12:20 AM] Strob#3417
How do you count bestmatches exaclty maybe I don't use the right command?

[04-May-19 12:21 AM] Strob#3417

we currently have 8 on BEER, 9 on PIZZA, 10 on TXSCLCC at the end of the round, so just need a few more to make 11

[04-May-19 01:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi Testnet OPs,

`TL;dr`  As a team, stop fucking up.

For the past couple of days I've been expecting some of the 'old-timer' NN ops to jump in here and give us all a good blasting.

We've fucked up majorly. Again.

"The flag never touches the ground."

Well, the flag is being trampled in the mud right now.

This is the second time that the network that we are supposed to be securing had had no notarizations for an extended period.  Over 10 hours this time and still counting.

Sure this is a testnet.  And having such a high percentage of ops required to participate in a notarization could be seen as adverse circumstances.

That doesn't matter.

By being here we are asking for the chance to be given the responsibility of securing 100s of millions of dollar of other people's money.  And to show that we are worthy of that, both individually and as a group.

As a team we are failing dismally.

Clearly there are many here who are doing their utmost to improve their performance and support the network and the people who rely on it.

That is not enough.  The results speak for themselves.

[04-May-19 01:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Individual results won't mean anything to the person whose deal falls through because we didn't do our job as a group.  They won't be much comfort to the investor whose investment drop in value because we damaged the reputation of the project that we are tasked with securing. 

Talk of what us candidates will do to 'add value to the ecosystem' or how to improve 'the system' is important and useful.  But clearly this should come secondary to the fundamental role of a NN op.

Ensuring the reliable notarization of the network is the job.  First and foremost.

How about getting that sorted out?
 
There is no blame here.  Just a problem requiring a solution, and a chance to improve.

For me that means: 
- keeping aware of upcoming updates
- making arrangements to be available
- coming up with alternatives if I'm not going to be available
- spreading awareness of upcoming updates
- dealing with NN related problems as a priority
- solicit further advice on what I can do
- take responsibility for my part of the problem
- writing this

I know you'll tell if I'm wrong.  I count on that.

Feedback appreciated.

@CrisF that is fairly aggressive considering what we are trying to test is for bugs/problems. Maybe you're misunderstanding what is going on here?

`We've fucked up majorly. Again.` I don't understand why you'd think this. Or feel the need to post it

[04-May-19 02:09 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright I've seen a socket error now and then.

[04-May-19 02:10 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
`spreading awareness of upcoming  updates`  I agree this would help

[04-May-19 02:14 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @NutellaLicka , I posted it because I feel that someone needed to say it.  I'd appreciate feedback on whether I'm wrong and looking at this incorrectly.  I see it as a problem and would like to get further ideas on what I can do myself to  fix it.  I'd like more of the kind of feedback that you are giving now.

[04-May-19 02:15 AM] Alright#0419
the updates are much more frequent than mainnet, but they're at least about the same time every day

[04-May-19 02:15 AM] Alright#0419
I figured it's not too hard to see if you have a notification around the same time each day

[04-May-19 02:15 AM] Alright#0419
if you'd like to handle updates @NutellaLicka or @CrisF  I'll give you commit access

[04-May-19 02:17 AM] Greer#0666
@Alright checked my logs, never had that error.

[04-May-19 02:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I said that it would help. How about I make a schedule for the planned updates so people know when they should find time to conduct the updates. Any unforseen commits due to bugs etc are free reign though, we still need to be flexible and make rapid changes if required. 
@Alright how low are we planning to go with min sigs?

[04-May-19 02:19 AM] Alright#0419
until we see double notarizations again if ever

[04-May-19 02:20 AM] Alright#0419
the schedule is "check to see if you have a notification in this channel shortly after 3PM UTC each day"

3PM UTC was chosen because it's a reasonable time for most time zones, we can change it +/- a couple hours if you want

[04-May-19 02:21 AM] CrisF#3405
