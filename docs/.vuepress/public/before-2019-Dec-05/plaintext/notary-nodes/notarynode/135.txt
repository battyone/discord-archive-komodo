well. Mr Lynch send vbacktrace (or old bug mind you) and I fixed that aleady. When I cant get these bugs you guys somehow find to happen, its extremly hard to fix them.

[15-Apr-19 02:12 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ok. got my ip added to m_notarynode_testnet and pubkey added to testnet.json.. do I need to push my changes to public repo first or just git request-pull?

[15-Apr-19 02:13 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
github is pretty new to me actually

[15-Apr-19 02:13 PM] SHossain#0007
once you submit the PR, start all daemon with same pubkey. then, import private key if you haven't yet in all daemon. then, fund all addresses and follow the testnet repo guide

chlorophyl absorbes mainly blue (400-500nm) and red (600-700nm) lights, so green light gets refelcted the most

Not sure what might went wrong - maybe you have some typo in your command

[15-Apr-19 02:44 PM] TonyL#3577
I mean actual command which you input to terminal. 
`git config --global user.name "John Doe"` this one looks correct

[15-Apr-19 02:44 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
yeah

[15-Apr-19 02:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
did you copy/paste it or type it?

[15-Apr-19 02:44 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
both

[15-Apr-19 02:45 PM] SHossain#0007
you can use web version to submit PR

[15-Apr-19 02:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Just as an idea maybe you copy-pasted something like a `$git ... `

The workflow is like this: fork the repo (there is a fork button), clone your forked repo on your machine, edit the necessary files locally, commit then push them onto your forked repo, then make a pull request.

Been looking back through the posts and I'm not sure if people are saying that ./m_notary_testnet "" notary_nosplit works or not, or if you have to edit m_notary_testnet to add that command manually or if it's not possible to tell iguana to disable autosplitting. I've got lukechilds notary node utils to keep my UTXO's under control, just wondered if there is anyway to disable autosplitting ?

And start all daemons (KMD,PIZZA, BEER, TXSCLCC) with your pubkey as param

[15-Apr-19 03:56 PM] Alright#0419
@Dr.Terminus do you have a file at `~/2019NNtestnet/iguana/pubkey.txt`?

ok, done.. Still havent imported kmd privkey to each AC.. command for this ?

...showing a 0 balance on my wallet. what are the resync commands & procedures (i.e. sending to myself with a 0 balance)?

[15-Apr-19 04:18 PM] phm87#7395
Are you using the wallet filter ? Did you import the private key without rescan (i.e. with a false at the end) ?

[15-Apr-19 04:19 PM] Lumbi#8378
yes privkey is imported

[15-Apr-19 04:19 PM] phm87#7395
if you import it with false (meaning without rescan), it is normal that you don't see balance

[15-Apr-19 04:20 PM] phm87#7395
at this point, one old NN operator suggested me, beofre recreating new wallet.dat, to move the funds of each wallet to another address/wallet then after I create the new wallet.dat and import private key, to make a tx to put the funds back

[15-Apr-19 04:21 PM] phm87#7395
another solution that I use : I am running 2 nodes per coin (KMD and each AC) that remain on the old wallet, from this old wallet I can do a tx

[15-Apr-19 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you imported with false, you will not see it until you send it to yourself from another node

[15-Apr-19 04:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because "false" = "do not scan to see if I have a balance"

[15-Apr-19 04:22 PM] phm87#7395
yes but if he is using the walletfilter, he should use ``-whitelistaddress``

[15-Apr-19 04:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
agreed, but 2 separate things 😉

[15-Apr-19 04:23 PM] Lumbi#8378
sending 0 to myself = `le error`

[15-Apr-19 04:23 PM] phm87#7395
yes

[15-Apr-19 04:24 PM] phm87#7395
yeah it is normal

[15-Apr-19 04:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  I read that it may be possible to rescan only some blocks (rescan 1000 blocks as example), does it exist ?

[15-Apr-19 04:27 PM] phm87#7395
@Lumbi  if you create another node with the old wallet.dat (or if you import priv key with true but it will be slow, very slow) you'll see your balance

once I've added that pubkey.txt need to push t git again / another pull request ?

[15-Apr-19 04:28 PM] phm87#7395
@Lumbi  very slow meaning few minutes to hours. Please do the importprivkey in a screen (then you'll be able to ctrl A, D the screen without shutting it down and go to shopping while it imports the key with rescan)

[15-Apr-19 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` in komodo/src folder as well as 2019nntestnet/iguana?`
just  in 2019nntestnet/iguana
