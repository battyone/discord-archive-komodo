Added both of you!   But hey what' going on wioth TXSC? Not not since 5 hour for me!!!! If I want to reindex it can I do it without stoping iguana?

yep

@Strob Yeah hopefully that will help.  TXSCLCC was ok for me, but BEER wasn't notarizing.  A `reindex` has started that up again just now.

@Alright  `I don't understand why restarting my node kicked it back into high gear`
Did you restarted the computer or only iguana?

[07-Apr-19 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha moving mine to London seems done the trick its no1 😄

[07-Apr-19 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
btw no reindexes here... A cahin will just not notarize from time to time.. no need to reindex things just wait

@blackjok3r are you at the same datacenter mrlynch just moved too?

[07-Apr-19 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no im just on VULTR VPS  $40 one I htink 8GB 4 threads

[07-Apr-19 05:32 AM] Strob#3417
But  shouldn't there be a rule against everyone moving to the same location to increase their speed in this test?

[07-Apr-19 05:34 AM] Strob#3417
I mean I know if I move also to London my speed will increase but we can'T do that for the mainnet! So I won't do it for the test...

[07-Apr-19 05:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was just curious how much diffrence it would make... I will lbe trying a bunch of locations... But as most node are in EU for testnet its clear being there is the highest advantage.

[07-Apr-19 05:49 AM] Strob#3417
Yes it's good to test it at least we know how much of a factor it can be

[07-Apr-19 05:55 AM] Strob#3417
You should try OVH Beauharnois here in Quebec! Very close to my house! 😃

[07-Apr-19 05:56 AM] Strob#3417
oh boy I just got a TXS after 10 hours of nothing for this coin!

[07-Apr-19 05:57 AM] Strob#3417
in fact I got 2 TXS

[07-Apr-19 05:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe we need to add more coins... So you can alll see that a coin not notarizing for some extended time is no problem lol

And you will have another node in Beauharnois so please test it in this test too! :pirate:

Oyasumi everyone I need to go to sleep 2 AM here!

[07-Apr-19 06:02 AM] mrlynch#5735
i was thinking of putting up a second node, but i'm already down $300 for testing 😄

[07-Apr-19 06:02 AM] mrlynch#5735
and i'm not sure if this is the actual testnet

[07-Apr-19 06:03 AM] Strob#3417
What do you mean not sure?

[07-Apr-19 06:04 AM] mrlynch#5735
i thought we're going to have a testnet after elections with notas to btc... not sure if this is the "official" one or just something put up by the community to help us n00bs learn

[07-Apr-19 06:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know for sure, but I would say there wont be another testnet

[07-Apr-19 06:05 AM] Strob#3417
Ok another practice for those elected, yes that would be helpful

[07-Apr-19 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this one is the only one

im not 100% on that but it seems silly to make another

[07-Apr-19 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notarizing is notzriszing doesnt really matter what coins they are. Process is exactly the same

[07-Apr-19 06:07 AM] Strob#3417
Ok. Well anyway this test will last until may so I guess we have plenty of time to practice before the real mainet for those elected

[07-Apr-19 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As far as scripts and tools go, if you use assetchains.json for everything they will "just work" I think we need a second assetchains.json for the 3rd party coins that would be helpful

[07-Apr-19 06:09 AM] mrlynch#5735
and have a second while do in the scripts? 🤔

[07-Apr-19 06:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was thinking seperate scritps... as I think they will be offloaded to a second pubkey next season.. So just run them on a second VM

[07-Apr-19 06:10 AM] mrlynch#5735
will they? so.. 2 nodes running?

[07-Apr-19 07:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
If you want more experience with being a notary node, hang out in KMD Labs for a few months. It's not exactly the same, but the closest real alternative.

{Reactions}
labs (3) 

[07-Apr-19 07:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the only real diffrenc with LABS is that I did not add the ability to run 3rd party coins... The idea is to migrate all those coins to assetchains lol

[07-Apr-19 07:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was asked about a new 3rd aprty coin, maybe we can add this to the testnet 🤔  solves two problems at once I think... depends when they want it done though I guess

I'm just syncing up BEER, PIZZA and TXSCLCC and I've noticed that all of them have "testnet" : false. Am I right in assuming this should be true ?

[07-Apr-19 10:11 AM] CHMEX#0686
no that is ok. afaik there is not such thing as "testnet" ( like ETH or BTC) we also spin up chains which do not have testnet true

[07-Apr-19 10:11 AM] CHMEX#0686
some chains even envolve in something bigger

Could a mainnet OP shed some light on how they handle mining rewards? Should I be sending them away from the wallet immediately?

[07-Apr-19 12:08 PM] Alright#0419
I've been mining to my testnet pubkey recently, and it seems to have a negative effect on counts compared to when I wasn't

I use this script to withdraw when KMD generated:true utxos balance is over 11.

The other thing to do is  use z_mergetoaddress like the dwy_mitagation.sh in LABS doesn

[07-Apr-19 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if the last aprameter is specifed it will filter all 10ksat p2pk utxos and not merge them

I think this would be easily adapted to work with assetchains.json from mainnet... and would be able to merge all non iguana utxos for all coins every few hours. (say following a split or something?)

if you set pubkey (which NN does) rewards go to pubkey

I think it does.. I am checking for you now

[07-Apr-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Pretty sure it uses the vout[0] pubkey to veroify which notary mined what block
