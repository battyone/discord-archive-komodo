@blackjok3r is there a simple fix for blacktest crashing if active is called too early or is it deep in?

[17-Apr-19 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I added fix for that already in last build?

Its always been like that... It u asked it for something that doesn't exist it quits

Latest build of my iguana it has a check for that and returns error

[17-Apr-19 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As it applies to this specific topic, if you aren't part of the solution, then you are literally being part of the problem.

[17-Apr-19 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you, personally, hold the answers

[17-Apr-19 03:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

`they weren't adopted by most operators because of this fear to change`
I'm not sure how that has anything to do with those coming in.... 🤷🏽 
Your base premise is that those coming in lack tools/documentation that you, personally, have the power to effect change on.
Did I miss someone saying "@Deleted User no one wants your input here, it's perfect the way it is!"?

[17-Apr-19 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`It was a set of bash scripts.`
To use your own words: "scripts aren't documentation"

[17-Apr-19 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, define " lowering entry barrier", so that we can be on the same page about that

I'm not asking this to back you into a corner, I'm being earnest -- perhaps you have a valid point that just needs someone like me or some of the "new blood" to push through...

I gave up on containers after trying in vain to learn how to make one from scratch

[17-Apr-19 03:20 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
a strange thing I just discovered too. TXSCLCC has been slow to ntx for me last 2 days. I made a fresh wallet - not much change. resync'd. was good until I did .`./cleanwallets`. Then I  resynced again, and left all the old tx in. now stats runs slow on it but I get more ntx 🤷

[17-Apr-19 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User feel free to define "things" at any time, we're in no rush....

[17-Apr-19 03:24 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
still useful to read. maybe fully containerised is something I can do later. or maybe I can use some for partial. no problem either way. Containers look really useful once setup, but setting up is a bit of a `barrier to entry` for me so far cos I've not played with it much yet apart from basic aws docs stuff

[17-Apr-19 03:26 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
standard launch param for TXSCLCC has -spentindex=1, maybe this is why it doesnt like `cleanwallettransactions`?

[17-Apr-19 03:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
TXSCLCC has been "finicky", to say the least, I've not seen where clean is a specific issue though

[17-Apr-19 03:29 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
are BEER and PIZZA both initialized with -addnode=78.47.196.146 ?

[17-Apr-19 03:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you only ever actually need addnode 1 time or if you delete peers file

[17-Apr-19 03:30 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
the IP the same for both pizza and beer though ?

probably not. it was based on IPs in testnet.json or m_notary_testnet early on. People have changed IPs since

so, you happen to know what correct node address is to add for BEER?

[17-Apr-19 03:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
u just add them all when running the ac initializations once ?

[17-Apr-19 03:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
and basing on facts, the testnet this year is far more advanced than last year. the reason newcomers keep up is that because we communicate

[17-Apr-19 03:48 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
basically as long as you have one addnode connecting to a running daemon, it will let you know about the other IPs

[17-Apr-19 03:49 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if seednodes are working, you dont even need a single addnode

[17-Apr-19 03:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`u just add them all when running the ac initializations once ?`
you can add them in config or command arg and remove them later, once they are looked at by the daemon, it adds them to the peers db and will always attempt them if in config or args or not

[17-Apr-19 03:51 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
