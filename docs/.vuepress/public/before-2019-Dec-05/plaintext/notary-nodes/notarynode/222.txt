could you make me not worry and tell me you got an autoscript

[06-Sep-19 09:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
please

[06-Sep-19 09:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
and yeah, I panicked, and didn't see it was already removed

[06-Sep-19 09:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
sorry

[08-Sep-19 12:20 AM] kolo#1111
Yes, there is autospend for those

[10-Sep-19 09:16 AM] CrisF#3405
Is CHIPS an ondemand chain?

[10-Sep-19 09:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no

[10-Sep-19 09:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, I haven't seen a block move for over a day.

[10-Sep-19 09:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but it's been reported that it's blocks are not mined recently

[10-Sep-19 09:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh

[10-Sep-19 09:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
me and @SHossain been mining on a pool, but shossain is moving his farm I guess and I'm waiting my vpn issues resolved to check on my miner status.

[10-Sep-19 09:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hoping for some status update on it soon

[10-Sep-19 09:20 AM] CrisF#3405
It seems it's not possible to cpu mine.

[10-Sep-19 09:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess it's late here so I might have to wait till tomorrow for my friend to check on vpn stuff if that becomes the worst case 😦

[10-Sep-19 09:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
without adaptivePoW I don't know

[10-Sep-19 09:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c can answer that part better

[10-Sep-19 09:21 AM] CrisF#3405
No problem, thanks.

[10-Sep-19 09:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no problem mate 👍

[10-Sep-19 09:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Maybe @hyperDEX has a good solution 🤷🏽

[10-Sep-19 11:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We can rent a miner for now to get blocks moving.

[10-Sep-19 11:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or you could avoid telling miners that they are a "cancer" to the project and ecosystem

[10-Sep-19 11:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sometimes you just have to remind someone that the sticky situation that exists is, at least in part, their fault 🤷🏽

[10-Sep-19 11:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586
LOL, how pathetic

[10-Sep-19 11:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Are you saying that you feel no responsibility for me leaving and not mining after you spludged all over the screen about how much you spend on everything, what a piece of shit I am, and that I should just leave? Really? 😕

[10-Sep-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll not get into it any further here (but rather anyone that's interested in the specifics can join the CHIPS discord, scroll back to see what happened, and see the main causal reason I left as a miner 🤷🏽 )

but for temporary testing in containers/etc, I hope the binary release helps some folks

[24-Sep-19 02:00 PM] cipi#4502
this is great... now imagine debian would add HUSH to their official repos 😉

[24-Sep-19 02:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm sure they'll get right on that 👍🏽

[24-Sep-19 02:13 PM] cipi#4502
of course

[24-Sep-19 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@cipi i tried to follow most rules

[24-Sep-19 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
but there are too many rules

[24-Sep-19 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
`lintian` is like a school marm

[24-Sep-19 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
life is too short and i just made stuff work for us, there is a lot of bullshit to fix to send to debian, annoying "paperwork"

[24-Sep-19 06:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
but we have man pages and other basics you would expect

[24-Sep-19 06:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
we just didn't follow every weird debian rule for *.deb's

[24-Sep-19 06:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
i installed and removed it successfully on my 18.04 machine

[24-Sep-19 06:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
BTW, Hush now has the best debian creation scripts of any Zcash fork

[24-Sep-19 06:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
I say this, so somebody can lovingly borrow them and add to KMD

[24-Sep-19 06:30 PM] dukeleto#7326

he is a curse to this project

[26-Sep-19 05:03 PM] webworker01#3884
everything was fine, i blocked him months ago

[26-Sep-19 05:03 PM] phm87#7395
@webworker01  please do not leave, I love you and I am a fan of your work ... we need you

[26-Sep-19 05:03 PM] webworker01#3884
but every time i say something he is there

[26-Sep-19 05:04 PM] webworker01#3884
i love you too (i think).. but there is no repercussions for someone constantly harassing and trolling

[26-Sep-19 05:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Don't you have a pool to go fix or something?

[26-Sep-19 05:07 PM] phm87#7395
I agree that KMD moderators does not apply the charts to some old members (I said it to jl777 in private a while ago) @webworker01

[26-Sep-19 05:08 PM] phm87#7395
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  my pool had issues on CHIPS, it took me a while but I fixed it : https://github.com/jl777/chips3/pull/36 Why are you trying to push webby to rush to fix his pool ? Do you have dividends from webby's pool ?

`Why are you trying to push webby to rush to fix his pool ?`
Because, that's **literally** what started all of this. He broke his pool, got mad at me, and then drug that shit over here (from an entirely different discord).

A decentralized society does not preclude a lack of civility. 
A lack of civility reduces morale and productivity.  
In the crypto space, I think people will coalesce around what works for them best.
I require harmony to work best. What should I do?

[27-Sep-19 05:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Keep walking till the end of the season and finish what you started with. You know the work, and you can do it. Ignore what you don't like.

basics: follow the guide and have skills to maintain a remote linux server

[29-Sep-19 01:03 PM] hastrup#8742
When you say maintain a Linux remote server. Is that SSH keys, certificate, and that type of stuff?

[29-Sep-19 01:05 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
linux skills, commitment to ecosystem contribution and a stoic disposition are recommened

Main OPs are on holiday at the moment, but keep an eye out - we do a bunch of testing new modules etc, and every 2 months or so we rotate notaries based on performance, participation and who is wanting to join.
