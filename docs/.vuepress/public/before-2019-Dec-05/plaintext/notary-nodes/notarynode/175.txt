dont need resync only remove `komodostatefile` but I thaught I fixed this in last commit ? @Mylo

[27-Apr-19 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
your not getting banned by peers but banning them btw 😉

[27-Apr-19 12:02 PM] Mylo#8306
oh 😄

[27-Apr-19 12:02 PM] Mylo#8306
damn, i should have been more patient

[27-Apr-19 12:03 PM] Mylo#8306
i can fire up a bunch of servers and build jl777/dev on them and sync  to test if you need

[27-Apr-19 12:03 PM] Mylo#8306
i think i have 3 that are synced atm for testing, so can rebuild and restart on those with current chain tip

[27-Apr-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no the issue is that the notarization folder is still there, and it cant activate the chain,, becuse it thinks its chain tip is notarised higher than what it is....

[27-Apr-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but Im sure that I fixed this in the last coimmit

[27-Apr-19 12:04 PM] Mylo#8306
once synced i can stop it from both nodes and rsync the notarizations dir if you need a guinea pig

[27-Apr-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
` if ( !fSkipdpow && pindexFork != 0 && pindexOldTip->GetHeight() > notarizedht && pindexFork->GetHeight() < notarizedht )`

@Alright 
Since @NutellaLicka pinged everyone to point at the repo, I was confuzzed if everyone pulled it not despite it or not being time

[27-Apr-19 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
IO tested the crap out of i, I just dont get how this happend to you

[27-Apr-19 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
how is 1 > 391440 >?

[27-Apr-19 12:05 PM] Mylo#8306
❄

[27-Apr-19 12:05 PM] Alright#0419
there was no update

[27-Apr-19 12:05 PM] Alright#0419
only to BEER daemon, but it doesn't really matter right now

[27-Apr-19 12:05 PM] Mylo#8306
i don't htink i had a full sync on that node.  was only up to block 500k or something ??shrug??

[27-Apr-19 12:05 PM] Alright#0419
~3pm UTC we'll change min sigs

[27-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Mylo#8306
one node i updated everything, the other rebuild and only restarted BEER

[27-Apr-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe I need to add an extra print out there

[27-Apr-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
why did you delete that 😫

[27-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Mylo#8306
impatient 😦  sorry

[27-Apr-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
did you update to the very altest dev in jl777 befoire starting KMD there

[27-Apr-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that bug exists if a node was improperly shut down

[27-Apr-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I found it today and fixed right away

[27-Apr-19 12:07 PM] Mylo#8306
yes
kmd wasn't running.   server was just booted after a day or two off.
did not start kmd.
saw message.
recompiled jl777/dev.
started kmd.
error ht.1

[27-Apr-19 12:08 PM] Mylo#8306
30 mins ago

[27-Apr-19 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so it was starting from height of 1

[27-Apr-19 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
makes 0 difffrence

[27-Apr-19 12:14 PM] Mylo#8306
ok - well i just realized that's what happened with this test box restart script 😛

[27-Apr-19 12:15 PM] Mylo#8306
pkill -9 is quite rude, metaphilibert said use -15 to be more polite to the process 😄

[27-Apr-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to kill it liek that to make the bug appear

[27-Apr-19 12:16 PM] Mylo#8306
killed, restarting with pubkey anyway

[27-Apr-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I discovered it when testing stuff and it segfaulted on me

[27-Apr-19 12:16 PM] Mylo#8306
ahhh...i've kill -9 this time, i kill -15 before

[27-Apr-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
testnet node also did it when I did a snapshot and moved it to Toyko

[27-Apr-19 12:17 PM] Mylo#8306
but -9 will likely stuff things up because you're urgently killing it and it might be part-way through something important

[27-Apr-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
exactly

[27-Apr-19 12:17 PM] Mylo#8306
joizus

[27-Apr-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats why I asked you to do it... because ths the cause of the error you posted 😛

[27-Apr-19 12:17 PM] Mylo#8306
ahhhhh then i can tell you i had a hardware error on teh server

[27-Apr-19 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I still dont understand what happened in this case.. like its missing one vairable from the print maybe... going to add it hopefulkly someone encounters it again.

[27-Apr-19 12:19 PM] Mylo#8306
i can make a script to start kmd; when RPC is ready, kill -9 and loop it if you want and if error, can notify you?

[27-Apr-19 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt help

[27-Apr-19 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i already did tha manually abvout 20 times, and couldnt get it to do that

[27-Apr-19 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
after the fix that is

[27-Apr-19 12:20 PM] Mylo#8306
i can push the power button?

[27-Apr-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I still dont know how you did it. Im pushing an extra print to the fix, if it happens to anybvody else I hope they give me the print out.

[27-Apr-19 12:23 PM] Mylo#8306
what is the dfference between `pindexOldTip->GetHeight()` and  `pindexFork->GetHeight()` ?

[27-Apr-19 12:24 PM] Mylo#8306
what is old tip & fork?

[27-Apr-19 12:24 PM] Mylo#8306
(p = pointer, index presumably index of the vector)  for lurkers

[27-Apr-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pindexOldTip->GetHeight()  == the height of the chain you are on
pindexFork->GetHeight()  == the height that is being reorged to

[27-Apr-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in the middle of those is a notarized height

{Reactions}
🙏 

[27-Apr-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with the fix you must be over the notarised height and the for must be under it for it to error

[27-Apr-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
kill -9 is as bad as the automatic windows wallet corruptor

{Reactions}
😛 

[27-Apr-19 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes very bad... but in this case it is a shortcut to reproduce this error

[27-Apr-19 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seem to me that the only way that contition can happen is if you are trying to sync the chain without deleteing the komodostate files

[27-Apr-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo state is part of the blockchain state, it needs to be deleted when resyncing

[27-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Mylo#8306
so when i had the hardware error on this box, i don't know what it was doing unforch.  it may have been midway through a reorg, then boom - killed.  could that set the state into a problem case?

[27-Apr-19 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems to me the entire bock index corrupted and it started a sync... but didnt delete komodostate (it does delete i automaically for a reindex I think)

[27-Apr-19 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe on chain init if block == 0 it should delte the file also ?

[27-Apr-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, maybe it should, block == 1 is probably more sure to be triggered. some parts skip genesis block

[27-Apr-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i'll try to test something for this tomorrow, trying to work on paymetnscc keep getting distracted

[27-Apr-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
need payments for fully autonomous DAO type things

[27-Apr-19 12:43 PM] Mylo#8306
just killed (-9) whilst rewinding, restarted.   no problem, its syncing.

[27-Apr-19 01:31 PM] Strob#3417
So what should we do now? Can we update komodo, rebuild, restart BEER and at 3pm utc do git pull and m_start_notary?

[27-Apr-19 01:34 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi, that's what I did, and am waiting for.

[27-Apr-19 02:15 PM] Strob#3417
I synched komodo, rebuilt it and restarted BEER but when I do getinfo for BEER the notarized hash is still all 0000 is it expected?

[27-Apr-19 02:19 PM] PHBA2061#2530
it is always like that

komodo update is not mandatory, and shouldn't affect anything

[27-Apr-19 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
BEER should show notarized height after update once it sees a notarization

[27-Apr-19 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
has to see one first though.

[27-Apr-19 02:43 PM] Strob#3417
ok get it now:

@deleted-role please do `git pull` `./m_notary_testnet`. We're doing some tests to see if we have network connectivity problems. We increased min sigs to 13. We're going to leave it at 13 for at least 2 or 3 days regardless of performance. 

If you haven't updated your BEER node to latest dev branch, make sure you rebuild and restart. You may end up on a fork in the event of a reorg if you do not. Only your BEER node needs to be restarted.

looks like we still have  a group of 7 nodes that are notarizing BEER.  We will need at least one of them to update.

[27-Apr-19 04:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```$ curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}" | jq '[.[] | select(.bestk > 0)] | . |length'

even if 1 of them updates, he/she will just be replaced by another one who didn't do the update ?

[27-Apr-19 04:31 PM] NNoperator#3835
Don't sweat it,  I am just being impatient cause I want to see the testnet do a full set of 13.   One hour to get updated is very fast (especially on the weekend)

[27-Apr-19 04:32 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm just wondering what it's like on mainnet.  Not worried, haha.

[27-Apr-19 04:32 PM] NNoperator#3835
Some take days. You want to be earlier so you get bonuses and extra counts.

[27-Apr-19 04:32 PM] SHossain#0007
the updates should always be carried out at the earliest opportunity on mainnet. sometimes there are critical updates.

Yeah, I know soon is good. Just curious on what it's like.

Don't be the one to take days...

[27-Apr-19 04:34 PM] CrisF#3405
We've had to wait a while sometimes in Labs, but it is usually very fast there.
