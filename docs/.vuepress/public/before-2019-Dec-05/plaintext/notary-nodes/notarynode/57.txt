so will need to run again.

[30-Mar-19 01:38 PM] Strob#3417
Good luck!

[30-Mar-19 01:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
thanks! good luck to all other people running too. Wish the best to everyone.

Webworker01 #1 in NA says he has modest server specs and got it thanks to daily attention. For sure if your server goes does unoticed for a few hours you can loose dozens of notarizations.

[30-Mar-19 01:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its a little more than just daily attention. Everyone gets their way around making their nodes more efficient with different practices and scripts to help them automate and visualize how things are going.

[30-Mar-19 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I didn't put specs because mine will grow as needed 🤷🏽

[30-Mar-19 01:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You should just post in the repo what you start with and update as you grow

[30-Mar-19 01:46 PM] Strob#3417
This morning I restarted to test something and I lost 3 hours without notarization...

[30-Mar-19 01:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yep, every node restart means at least an hour or so of not notarizing.

[30-Mar-19 01:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
also, every iguana restart also means possible long downtimes

[30-Mar-19 01:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
wallet sizes make an effect too...

[30-Mar-19 01:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
utxo quantities... etc.

[30-Mar-19 01:47 PM] Strob#3417
I'm very happy so far with all the thinggs I have learned!

[30-Mar-19 01:48 PM] Strob#3417
For the testnet do you set the utxo lower than 100 for AC and 700 for KMD?

[30-Mar-19 01:48 PM] Strob#3417
Wallet size? why? As long as you have enough you should be ok.

[30-Mar-19 01:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that is a decent number, yes.

[30-Mar-19 01:49 PM] Strob#3417
The autosplit seems pretty good at keeping my utxo to 700-kmd & 100-B+P

[30-Mar-19 01:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
These are things that you only learn with time hehehe

[30-Mar-19 01:50 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
any repos or resources for nn optimisation?

[30-Mar-19 01:57 PM] Strob#3417
I guess the only nn optimisation ressource is here when someone is drunk from notarizing too much beer and let his secrets leak.

anyone know why I'm getting
`error signing raw KMD utxoduplicates tx`
when testnet attempts for PIZZA?

[30-Mar-19 04:34 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe the last split tx is not confirmed yet

[30-Mar-19 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
29 confs

[30-Mar-19 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
is the minimum

[30-Mar-19 04:36 PM] SHossain#0007
how about KMD?

[30-Mar-19 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
KMD is good and it's hitting on BEER

[30-Mar-19 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
2 BEER notarizations in the last 5 inutes

[30-Mar-19 04:36 PM] SHossain#0007
has low amount

[30-Mar-19 04:36 PM] SHossain#0007
(balance)

[30-Mar-19 04:37 PM] SHossain#0007
it's for KMD `error signing raw KMD utxoduplicates tx
`

[30-Mar-19 04:37 PM] SHossain#0007
send some more KMD there

[30-Mar-19 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's intentional because 2700 UTXOs is slow af

[30-Mar-19 04:37 PM] SHossain#0007
i guess you will be ok

[30-Mar-19 04:37 PM] SHossain#0007
2700 is way tooooooo much

[30-Mar-19 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's the result of the autosplit 😛

[30-Mar-19 04:38 PM] SHossain#0007
have only 1 utxo of balance and then use split

[30-Mar-19 04:38 PM] SHossain#0007
or autosplit

[30-Mar-19 04:38 PM] SHossain#0007
send full balance to self and split again

[30-Mar-19 04:38 PM] NNoperator#3835
must have had a lot of UTXOs for it to work with..

[30-Mar-19 04:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it literally split on its own a ton overnight

[30-Mar-19 04:38 PM] Jax#4739
are you using iguana autosplit

[30-Mar-19 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`are you using iguana autosplit`
yes, I haven't edited src for it to not

[30-Mar-19 04:39 PM] NNoperator#3835
if there is only one UTXO for it to split off it should keep at 700

[30-Mar-19 04:39 PM] Jax#4739
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 You can launch it as `./m_notary "" notary_nosplit` to disable splitting. The best split script on the market is luke's IMO: https://github.com/lukechilds/notary-node-utils/blob/master/utxosplitter.sh

700 is nuts for 2 chains 😛

[30-Mar-19 04:40 PM] SHossain#0007
those are default value for mainnet

[30-Mar-19 04:40 PM] SHossain#0007
700 for KMD
100 for AC

[30-Mar-19 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can cron the splitter we use in LABS
getting them split is easy, getting them *not* split is the issue

{Reactions}
☝ 

[30-Mar-19 04:41 PM] NNoperator#3835
you never know,  maybe someday KMD will have trouble with miners demanding high fees  and the mempool will fill up with too many transactions  !  We'll need those 700 UTXOs to tide us over

[30-Mar-19 04:41 PM] SHossain#0007
you are participating in notarization though

[30-Mar-19 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you are participating in notarization though`
but it's not, that's why I asked about the error

[30-Mar-19 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, those are for BEER

[30-Mar-19 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the error is for PIZZA

[30-Mar-19 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1 works, 1 does not

[30-Mar-19 04:44 PM] SHossain#0007
check validate address for pizza. 
stop pizza daemon and restart
stop iguana and start again

[30-Mar-19 04:44 PM] SHossain#0007
these you can check ^^

[30-Mar-19 04:46 PM] NNoperator#3835
Genie,  do you have PIZZA UTXOs  that show in listunspent ?

[30-Mar-19 04:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

@Jax ./m_notary is a totally different creature than testnet

[30-Mar-19 04:52 PM] Jax#4739
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Didn't realize you guys were talking about testnet. My bad. 😛

[30-Mar-19 04:52 PM] Jax#4739
You are correct

[30-Mar-19 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain tried all of those and same result

[30-Mar-19 05:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright how far off is this repo from LABS? is clean wallet maybe feking it?

[30-Mar-19 06:45 PM] zatJUM#9924
I have a segfault with ./m_notary_testnet: line  1 of passphrase.txt

[30-Mar-19 07:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
did you properly create passphrase.txt?

[30-Mar-19 07:07 PM] zatJUM#9924
In "passphrase.txt", do I have to use " ?

[30-Mar-19 07:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
no

[30-Mar-19 07:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't think so

[30-Mar-19 07:08 PM] zatJUM#9924
and WIF is privkey, right?

[30-Mar-19 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, starts with a 'U'

[30-Mar-19 07:12 PM] zatJUM#9924
suspecting an encoding problem (bom or sthing like that) => no, it's just an ascii text file

[30-Mar-19 07:18 PM] zatJUM#9924
Could it be that I've not opened kmd p2p port? (7770)

[30-Mar-19 07:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that depends on the issue you're having

[30-Mar-19 07:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
i don't have kmd p2p port open and it's working fine

[30-Mar-19 07:39 PM] zatJUM#9924
ok. I'll search again tomorrow for the issue, I have to go now. Thanks!

[30-Mar-19 07:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, the `error signing raw KMD utxoduplicates tx` is definitely **not** related to wallet.dat, cleanwallettransactions, UTXOs, komodod version/build, or anything obviously chain related.
Anyone have any other ideas?

[30-Mar-19 07:51 PM] CHMEX#0686
I had an issue with beer and ended up synching it from scratch. How its working .... maybe resynch KMD?

[30-Mar-19 07:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, if the chain is bad, then it's your fault :troll:

[30-Mar-19 07:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I used your bootstraps

[30-Mar-19 07:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and the same bootstraps work for mining 😕

[30-Mar-19 07:53 PM] CHMEX#0686
Ok so not the chain than... do you use ubuntu or something else I guess not that it matters but just thinking

[30-Mar-19 07:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I had the same issue on both a Ubuntu setup and on the same deb setup I've been using for LABS for the last month

[30-Mar-19 07:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, I think the same issue, not sure if that's why ubuntu setup wasn't notarizing or not, I forget now
