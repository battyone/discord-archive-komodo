@lukechilds   whats the best practice to get a new AC running now as a NN op?

@jeezy, if you're using the normal scripts you don't need to do anything they will work as before

[26-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
is the old assetchains file replaced by now ?

[26-Jul-18 01:13 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you have custom management scripts you'll be able to refactor them to make use of the new `assetchains.json` file which will be much more powerful

[26-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
my script is ready for the json if you didn t change the syntax

[26-Jul-18 01:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
@Deleted User
>is the old assetchains file replaced by now?
Yeah, with one that'a functionally identical but with different sysntax

[26-Jul-18 01:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
are you still parsing `src/assetchains` source by hand or using the JSON?

[26-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok so I must be very careful on automanagement now

[26-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
I still parse the assetchains file, but I prepared the changes for the json file

[26-Jul-18 01:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
Yep, everyone should be careful with this update

[26-Jul-18 01:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
so basically I'll just have to put my updated script when updating

[26-Jul-18 01:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
in fact I will make a post in #notarynode-announce

[26-Jul-18 01:15 PM] Deleted User#0000

[26-Jul-18 01:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
final version... If I manage to finish it with my poor skills XD, will allow any NN to monitor its server / stats / rigs and get notifications

[26-Jul-18 01:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
only requirement will be to have a random webserver hosting jsons, there is a settings section that allow to choose which notary to check for stats and asks for the url of jsons (for node management / rigs management)

[26-Jul-18 01:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
code will obviously be public when everything will be done

[26-Jul-18 01:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
(so real coders will be able to improve it at will, if they find it useful)

[26-Jul-18 01:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think your buffering just fixed what could have been a problem

[26-Jul-18 01:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
basically running tasks gathering in a doinbackground, with huge response time it would have crashed the app

[26-Jul-18 01:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
the only thing I'll have to figure out is how to parse things for non uniformised pages : some waits for a node ID, and some for a operator name

[26-Jul-18 01:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah ^^

[26-Jul-18 01:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
it s already done via try/catch

not very sexy yet, concentrating on getting everything done, next step is rig dashboard, then individual pages. I don't know if people will be interested but at the end it will allow people to monitor node / Specific Operator stats / Personal rigs performance / Temps, and notify on specific events

I hate java, but have no choice here, only prerequisite for node / rigs will be to have a preformatted JSON

nothing more

[26-Jul-18 10:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
thing is at start when I began lazynode it was intended to be used by any notary, and at the end everyone has its own way to handle : esx, containers etc... so hard to get a allinone that is not specific... But if that s just parsing a JSON, I think any notary will be able to get the data and create their own json, if it s formatted as my version is, it will be fully compatible, and any node will be able to be monitored

[26-Jul-18 10:46 PM] Mylo#8306
scripts in priv chan, just values into js array, cp html to other server.  still need to do ACs

[26-Jul-18 10:48 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah - i saw yours but was quicker to hack a html file than read thru your method of doing it üòõ

[26-Jul-18 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
my method is fully embedded into the monitoring and automanagement of node, so it ends at being very specific

[26-Jul-18 10:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
that s why here I try to rely on a fixed json structure, not to force people to be dependent to anything else than the structure to be able to save time for their monitoring

[26-Jul-18 11:15 PM] Mylo#8306
what monitoring do you use? prometheus/netdata?

[26-Jul-18 11:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
nope

[26-Jul-18 11:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
pure handcoded

ok - i found plot.ly somehow by chance

[26-Jul-18 11:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
If I got the time I'll publish when app will be ready the structure of json, then you'll be able to use either webversion that s already public, or app, that will be public too

[26-Jul-18 11:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
In fact, I have not enough time to revamp webversion, but I just love @webworker01 charts. Maybe later this year.

at start the easy way was just to spawn a webview of the already built php version

i've had nativescript (because i do some stuff with vuejs) tutorials playing in the background.  it's either vue-nativescript or i learn dartlang to use flutter.io üòÉ
