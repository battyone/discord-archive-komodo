win time

[31-Mar-19 04:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
and just know how it articulates

[31-Mar-19 04:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
it s just basically curl, the point is : the fastest you know what happen and don t rely on allmade zcripts, the fastest you ll ve able to use those scripts and splitting stuff

[31-Mar-19 04:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
cause you ll know why where and how it should be done

[31-Mar-19 04:53 AM] mrlynch#5735
i'm actually learning from the scripts.. there's a lot of stuff i wasn't aware of

[31-Mar-19 04:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
if you understand... 5 scripts

[31-Mar-19 04:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
you got it

it can seem really really stupid

[31-Mar-19 04:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
but the key, magic, etc is just to look at scripts you have to execute on the guide. read it, deeply then you ll have the "critical line" in view, then you ll start digging without losing time

wish I could fight with you all on testnet :(

[31-Mar-19 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Man I will try login to mine I assume its dead. If anyone has any questions about it let me know. Happy to help any new comers. What dwy has said is just about right read the scripts understand what does what. There are many ways to improve. Comes down to responding the fastest to other nodes. That's exactly how to get better counts. The hard part is finding something that makes you respond faster. Less utxo means less to process. You can also customise the notarizer to make it just respond faster...

some leads gave good optim result on h decryption

[31-Mar-19 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I still have one more thing I'm going to try out this week on testnet, that is replace useing listuspent with a call that simply returns iguana a single eligible utxo so it no longer has to process anything at all

[31-Mar-19 05:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
array is back ?

[31-Mar-19 05:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
that s not what you wanted to do at first ? ^^

[31-Mar-19 05:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
oh, a simple utxo

[31-Mar-19 05:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
but wouldn t that rely on external listunspent ? new rpc to avoid loops ?

[31-Mar-19 05:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah like instead of needing to fetch all utxo it just gets a single one and locksnit directlyninside daemon

[31-Mar-19 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Anything we can do to stop iguana and daemon needing to talk to each other via RPC will speed it up

[31-Mar-19 05:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
interact with wallet.dat :p

[31-Mar-19 05:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pretty much, cut out 90% of the entire operation

[31-Mar-19 05:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
he s been deep on this, or maybe it was decker also

[31-Mar-19 05:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Decker helped with lock utxo code yes. Hut mostly been on my own with iguana, hundreds of hours reading code in the early days, learnt c codenin the process haha

[31-Mar-19 05:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
btw, maybe some sort of real splitting bw wallet and daemon will help

[31-Mar-19 05:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
like the ability to interact with wallet without daemon

[31-Mar-19 05:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
:p

[31-Mar-19 05:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hmmm iguana used to do those things, but I don't think its possible any more

[31-Mar-19 05:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
am not technically able to speak about that but after digging a bit in cpp files to see how you created the cleanwallettx

[31-Mar-19 05:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
I mean it s just a reuse of made functions on core, maybe those functions could give us a way to speed it

[31-Mar-19 05:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
deepest point in code...

[31-Mar-19 05:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes for sure. Cutting out any process any RPC calls and off loading it directly to the database inside komodod is the only thing really left to catch Shossain... I don't know how he does it, but I'll catch him one day :2561_feelsevilman:

[31-Mar-19 05:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
but am just a noob and can t pretend to understand this ^^

[31-Mar-19 05:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
hmmm

[31-Mar-19 05:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
I believe there is a way :D

[31-Mar-19 05:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Damn don't have SSH key for testnet here going yo have to wait until i get home

Lol yes... Actually managed to login haha

[31-Mar-19 05:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
btw... after 1 year of bash scripting and seeing how py improved the stability and error handling of lazynode... I couldn t recomment people smthg else than to go directly on py for their experiments :p

[31-Mar-19 05:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
like a dinausor I didn t want it, but youngsters were right :troll:

[31-Mar-19 05:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah python is good, will probably use either your stuff or write mine in it before next season.. My node is a horrible mess from all my experiments and bug fixing this season

[31-Mar-19 05:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
someday I ll go allin on docker and call patchkez and emmanuel and say sorry, you were right :p

[31-Mar-19 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not so sure on that myself. It depends what using it for hey

[31-Mar-19 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol wow my node wasnt dead at all. It was still notarizing, but I restarted it so it can add everyone... That could be reason for ppls low counts as my node wouldnt recognise their pubeys.

[31-Mar-19 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
7th spot 😄

[31-Mar-19 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Should probably set up a split script and see if I can catch SHossain

Nice proposal

[31-Mar-19 05:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Thanks! TUIposal 😂 (There is a very custom TUI on top picture lol)

[31-Mar-19 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
A TUI to manage NN will be awesome 😉

💯 

[31-Mar-19 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Been thinking of something like that myself, but still yet to make one for anything at all.

[31-Mar-19 05:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Thats one of the main reasons why I want to became NN operator - motivation to create some cool things in this field

[31-Mar-19 05:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Anyway even if people will not for me I can create some TUI 😃 We've discussed with Cris few months ago such interface for kmdlabs

Wanna trade? I'm insanely in last place

[31-Mar-19 06:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When dod you join? If 100% of nodes didnt update with your pubkey (mine is days old version) then your node is kind of out of the race.

[31-Mar-19 06:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im just setting mine up properly now

I had autosplitter issues for some of that; but, with as long as it has been working, dead last is insane

[31-Mar-19 07:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
utxo counts on my node is now 25 KMD max, 10 AC max. 2700 will kill your node dead. My main net one had 1400 for the first few months last season and simply didnt work.

[31-Mar-19 08:55 AM] SHossain#0007

it's weird, the stats on https://notarystats.info/testnet.php keeps jumping down & up

[31-Mar-19 01:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Strob what's the uptime on your node if you don't mind me asking 😄

[31-Mar-19 01:27 PM] Strob#3417
@mrlynch  My first notarization was mined on Mar 26, 2019 12:26:30 PM

[31-Mar-19 01:27 PM] Strob#3417
Why?

[31-Mar-19 01:28 PM] mrlynch#5735

You went to manual split finally?

[31-Mar-19 01:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
i've got my vps on a ssd

[31-Mar-19 01:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes.. manual split in cron

[31-Mar-19 01:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
a lot quicker

[31-Mar-19 01:33 PM] Strob#3417
Sadly I discovered I can't boot on m nvme (pcie softraid)so I will try putting the home and swap on the nvme and the system core on ssd for booting

[31-Mar-19 01:34 PM] Strob#3417
then I will try manual split to see the difference

[31-Mar-19 01:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you mount the nvme in /home make sure you backup your home

[31-Mar-19 01:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
as in if you mount it as /home

[31-Mar-19 01:37 PM] Strob#3417
I will do a fresh install on another server then swap the server I think

[31-Mar-19 01:37 PM] Strob#3417
Then I will try manual splitting

[31-Mar-19 01:37 PM] Strob#3417
with cron

[31-Mar-19 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wouldnt worry about RAID myself... I used RAID1 and regret it a bit, blockchain means you can just resync incase of data lost

[31-Mar-19 01:38 PM] Strob#3417
I will use raid 0

[31-Mar-19 01:38 PM] Strob#3417
for speed

[31-Mar-19 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what does that give you? Does is actually give you more speed ?

[31-Mar-19 01:38 PM] Strob#3417
more speed and more space

[31-Mar-19 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure it does give mroe speed. The random reads are what your after not hella fast sequential reads

[31-Mar-19 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I ran my ndoe 100% in a RAM disk fore quite some time, didnt really help over standard SSD

[31-Mar-19 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
worth testing I guess though. testnet is good 😉

[31-Mar-19 01:41 PM] Strob#3417
Not sure either, yes it'S faster only in sequencial write.

[31-Mar-19 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
read is all that matters, random reads.

[31-Mar-19 01:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
software raid?

[31-Mar-19 01:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
or no raid?

[31-Mar-19 01:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
and regular backups?

[31-Mar-19 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im using RAID1 hardware. BUt I think just a straigh disk would be better really... Though I cant really test that now 😦

[31-Mar-19 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
SHossain is using Optanes I think... That seems to give a pretty good advantage... but man, it would take years to pay them off lol
