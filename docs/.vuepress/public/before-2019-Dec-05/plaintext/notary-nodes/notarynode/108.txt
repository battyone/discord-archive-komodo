same problem http://beer.explorer.dexstats.info/blocks

[09-Apr-19 12:17 AM] PHBA2061#2530
didn't know it sorts blocks by date lol

[09-Apr-19 12:19 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@NNoperator it will take a while to return the result, because it is busy processing blocks I guess

[09-Apr-19 12:21 AM] NNoperator#3835
It timed out on me when I asked it to importprivkey   false

[09-Apr-19 12:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
look at your debug.log and see what it's doing

[09-Apr-19 12:21 AM] Greer#0666
the merging drank all my beer, would somebody send some, preferably not in 20k utxo's please.  RCzqeYMSSA25BnBkA3oSvAtektfcyMGhTS

@Greer   you can give this a try.   I think my keg got dumped.   ```https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/faucet/beer```

[09-Apr-19 12:33 AM] Greer#0666
tried that, it told me I've had my fill already

[09-Apr-19 12:34 AM] Greer#0666
I could try mining some but shielding them is a pita

[09-Apr-19 12:37 AM] NNoperator#3835
are the UTXOs flooding in not usable?

[09-Apr-19 12:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they are usable if you care to be assed to consolidate them

[09-Apr-19 12:39 AM] Greer#0666
I did consolidate them using merge but by the time the merge finished there was nothing left

[09-Apr-19 12:39 AM] Greer#0666
assumed it was fees?

[09-Apr-19 12:40 AM] Greer#0666
I'll just mine some

hmmm...

[09-Apr-19 12:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if the UTXOs still exist, then the tx info for them cannot be cleaned out

[09-Apr-19 01:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
consolidate then clean ^^

[09-Apr-19 01:15 AM] CrisF#3405
I wasn't able to consolidate.

[09-Apr-19 01:15 AM] Lumbi#8378
@CrisF what consolidate command did you use?

[09-Apr-19 01:16 AM] CrisF#3405
z_merge said not enough funds for miners fee

[09-Apr-19 01:16 AM] Strob#3417
You have to use a smaller ammount

[09-Apr-19 01:16 AM] Greer#0666
I had that, just reduce the miners fee

[09-Apr-19 01:16 AM] Strob#3417
use the amount that was sent with 7 zeros

[09-Apr-19 02:21 AM] Greer#0666
I did with TXSCLCC?

[09-Apr-19 02:22 AM] Alright#0419
you didn't have to

[09-Apr-19 02:22 AM] Greer#0666
doh

[09-Apr-19 02:22 AM] Greer#0666
ah well

[09-Apr-19 02:23 AM] Greer#0666
I think I had a problem with the splitting, was likely something else, lots of new information in the past couple of days.

[09-Apr-19 02:24 AM] Alright#0419
for some reason decker's splitter won't use mined coins

[09-Apr-19 02:25 AM] Alright#0419
not sure why it does that

[09-Apr-19 02:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That us expected bahaviour

[09-Apr-19 02:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It stops iguana runaway splitting mined kmd

[09-Apr-19 02:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not the script but iguana itself

[09-Apr-19 04:06 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
What would cause iguana to use 100% of my CPU :S

[09-Apr-19 04:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
too many utxos

[09-Apr-19 04:46 AM] NNoperator#3835
Is this someone trying to double spend?   ```https://komodoblockexplorer.com/block/00000001b0fc9079f60c5da59e79e659a4906011c27f20ae33ad9155b0a0370d```

[09-Apr-19 04:47 AM] NNoperator#3835
this address    RHmnjh4jB5qkxjdoeYgV1Vd1rsXHj19W8t

[09-Apr-19 05:05 AM] NNoperator#3835
Guess not.  Really odd to see dual nearly identical simultaneous transactions.

[09-Apr-19 05:08 AM] CHMEX#0686
I have seen that in that past but not sure why somebody does that.
I can think of a basic jumblr ( not really anom ) but certainly some people will give up tracing back the original address at some point

[09-Apr-19 05:08 AM] CHMEX#0686
on another note it drives up the transaction count

[09-Apr-19 05:12 AM] NNoperator#3835
right now they fixate on 8015.64906847 size UTXO.   Not really obfuscating effectively, maybe it has to do with mm2 ?

[09-Apr-19 07:45 AM] newvulcan#4719
I'm getting this error now and again in the TXSCLCC log - ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: tx inputs not found. Is that anything to be concerned about ?

[09-Apr-19 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no its fine

[09-Apr-19 07:45 AM] newvulcan#4719
Ok, thanks

[09-Apr-19 09:35 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
After running  ./m_notary_testnet, should Iguana daemon remain active?

[09-Apr-19 09:35 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Hello everyone, by the way

[09-Apr-19 09:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes iguana has to be active and is the communication service between the nn nodes

[09-Apr-19 09:44 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
For any reason Iguana is starting but it's not remaining active. After some seconds running it stops working. When I run m_notary_testnet it gives me the following output:

~/2019NNtestnet/iguana$ INIT with 2 notaries

How should I proceed to indentify the cause of the problem? Again, thanks for your support 😉

[09-Apr-19 09:45 AM] CHMEX#0686
INIT with 2 notaries     that looks wrong

[09-Apr-19 09:45 AM] CHMEX#0686
I believe we are at 15+

[09-Apr-19 09:51 AM] mrlynch#5735
24 i think

[09-Apr-19 09:52 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
I don't know why is not getting the whole notaries list

[09-Apr-19 10:01 AM] mrlynch#5735
check testnet.json

[09-Apr-19 10:02 AM] mrlynch#5735
did u clone 2019testnet repo?

[09-Apr-19 10:13 AM] newvulcan#4719
@MadCryptoHead I had the same thing yesterday - it's to do with not having your details  on the 2019NNtestnet. I cloned the repo, made the changes to m_notary_testnet and testnet.json files and then submitted a PR. Just waiting for it to be actioned now, and it should be ok

[09-Apr-19 10:14 AM] newvulcan#4719
Oh, and I think you have to restart iguana to load the new notaries file once actioned

[09-Apr-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes once hte PR is merged you need to restart

[09-Apr-19 10:28 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Hello Newvulcan. I already did it but it seems that there was a problem with the m_notary_testnet file that I downloaded. I re-downloaded it and now seems to get the notaries properly. Now is that it says that I have no funds...😤  not being true. I'm going to investigate further

[09-Apr-19 10:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
send the balance to youself before splitting if you mined blocks

[09-Apr-19 11:10 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
I have sent the funds to myself. Where can I find an explanation abour splitting my UTXOs?

[09-Apr-19 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`./acsplit BEER 50`

[09-Apr-19 11:23 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Ok, splitting now

[09-Apr-19 11:24 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Should I split the other assets after BEER ends (it is taking a while)

[09-Apr-19 11:24 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
?

[09-Apr-19 11:25 AM] PHBA2061#2530
you don't have to wait, because they are independant

[09-Apr-19 11:26 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Should then split PIZZA and TXSCLCC?

[09-Apr-19 11:34 AM] PHBA2061#2530
yes you should, otherwise you won't be able to notarize without 0.0001 utxo

[09-Apr-19 11:35 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Ok, I'm going to. Thanks to all 😉

[09-Apr-19 11:44 AM] MadCryptoHead#3559
What would be the right way to check that all is working properly? By now my notarized_confirms are 0

@MadCryptoHead I use some scripts from: <https://github.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary>
they need editing to work for NNtest, but they work quite well to see what's going on
