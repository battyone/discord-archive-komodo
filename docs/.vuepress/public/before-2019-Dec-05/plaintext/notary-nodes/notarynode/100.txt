we got a full year to discuss this

[07-Apr-19 08:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
why today ?

[07-Apr-19 08:23 PM] Ludom#5832
Our goal is to make a public and successful protocol

[07-Apr-19 08:23 PM] Ludom#5832
Every year, I come with this point

[07-Apr-19 08:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Ludom I'll leave out the context for reasons, but here's what I said the other day:
```ComputerGenie☑Vote4me☑Last Friday at 7:07 AM
it's not about "doing bad things", it's about were supposed to have a "decentralized" node model and the last sentence you wrote now has me even more confused
if the point is to be decentralized, then who tf is kolo to decide?```

[07-Apr-19 08:23 PM] Ludom#5832
Why today? Because somebody asked me with PM

[07-Apr-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
then right after elections, please make the rules for next year clarified

[07-Apr-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
dont wait until a week before

[07-Apr-19 08:24 PM] phm87#7395
I did not read your 1 year of discord discussions : I read the msgs on the website of this year. Leading to confusion sometimes

[07-Apr-19 08:24 PM] Ludom#5832
+1000000

[07-Apr-19 08:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
that s the point

[07-Apr-19 08:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
candidates have to prepare the campain and the election master also have work to do

[07-Apr-19 08:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
how can he work if every year we call him illegitimate

[07-Apr-19 08:25 PM] Ludom#5832
@jl777c Who is legit to make rules clarified?

[07-Apr-19 08:25 PM] Ludom#5832
If I propose rules, I don't think I can be legit

[07-Apr-19 08:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
why not?

[07-Apr-19 08:25 PM] Ludom#5832
Because I'm not neutral

[07-Apr-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
you said you wanted the rules clarified, you didnt say you wanted to mandate the rules yourself

[07-Apr-19 08:26 PM] Ludom#5832
Yes you're right

[07-Apr-19 08:26 PM] Ludom#5832
I don't want to make the rules myself.

[07-Apr-19 08:26 PM] Ludom#5832
I just say it should be done

[07-Apr-19 08:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you propose rules, and the community at large adopts those rules, then imo that's the epitome of decentralized

[07-Apr-19 08:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
neutral or not

[07-Apr-19 08:27 PM] Ludom#5832
But how can the community agree or not?

[07-Apr-19 08:27 PM] Ludom#5832
Show the agreament

[07-Apr-19 08:27 PM] phm87#7395
Vote2019_2 ? A second vote for this

[07-Apr-19 08:27 PM] phm87#7395
Yes / no

[07-Apr-19 08:27 PM] Ludom#5832
Ok, I wait until the end of the election and then I'll propose something

[07-Apr-19 08:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
discuss that after current election and just make sure we got it clarified after 1 month of new NN is possible

[07-Apr-19 08:28 PM] Ludom#5832
But I don't think it sould be the role of any notary node

[07-Apr-19 08:28 PM] Ludom#5832
Because we are not neutral

[07-Apr-19 08:28 PM] phm87#7395
I'm counting on you Ludom

[07-Apr-19 08:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
it won t be

[07-Apr-19 08:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
the role of NN

[07-Apr-19 08:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
but NN new and past have things to say

[07-Apr-19 08:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
and election master too

[07-Apr-19 08:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
and they are busy

[07-Apr-19 08:29 PM] Ludom#5832
Certainly

[07-Apr-19 08:30 PM] Ludom#5832
You know me @Deleted User You know that I present Komodo to much people in cryptocommunities

[07-Apr-19 08:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
yup, I do

[07-Apr-19 08:30 PM] Ludom#5832
But the only point of failure to present Komodo is this shady election

{Reactions}
💯 

[07-Apr-19 08:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Ludom it's a double-edged sword you're wielding there and the opposing side of it is:
How do you expect anything to change if you *don't* propose changes you think are valid?

[07-Apr-19 08:30 PM] Ludom#5832
😄

[07-Apr-19 08:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
those questions just can t come back 1 week before elections, and with the starting point of debate : Hey, is this proposal "officially" eligible beccause after 2nd april

[07-Apr-19 08:31 PM] Ludom#5832
It's not so much "shady" because we make the best we can

[07-Apr-19 08:31 PM] Ludom#5832
But it's not enough decentralized

[07-Apr-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
open to suggestions

[07-Apr-19 08:31 PM] SHossain#0007
no one stopped you suggesting anything in the whole year

{Reactions}
👌 

[07-Apr-19 08:31 PM] Ludom#5832
I don't contest anything

[07-Apr-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
but the election process is pretty much: airdrop and coins get sent to candidates, rich list is the winners

[07-Apr-19 08:31 PM] SHossain#0007
it is not about contest

[07-Apr-19 08:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`no one stopped you suggesting anything in the whole year`
Lord knows I do that on a regular basis 😛

[07-Apr-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure why there is so much angst about the process

[07-Apr-19 08:32 PM] Ludom#5832
I'm just the messenger of people who ask me some distrubing questions

[07-Apr-19 08:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
"rules" are here to help people that make the transition possible easier

[07-Apr-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the details of what needs to be done to run a node is changing, and cant be done a year ahead of time

[07-Apr-19 08:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
you didn t candidate and have a 1M wallet of vote and CLAIM that you are legitimate

[07-Apr-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
ANYBODY who took the time to participate, has been able to participate

[07-Apr-19 08:32 PM] SHossain#0007
as far as i know legitimate requests gets granted in this discord

[07-Apr-19 08:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
I believe you WILL be elected

[07-Apr-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
without cost

[07-Apr-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
without even having to fill out anything more than your candidacy pitch

[07-Apr-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure how much more open this can be

[07-Apr-19 08:35 PM] Ludom#5832
What about to make a workshop about Notary election upgrade during the next Komodo Meetup ?

[07-Apr-19 08:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Notary election upgrade`?

[07-Apr-19 08:35 PM] SHossain#0007
NN is only having it's 3rd election. every year new people are joining as NN ops and making things better. it will get better each year. if you have any suggestions, please do state them rather than waiting till end and saying it is not good.

[07-Apr-19 08:35 PM] Ludom#5832
Making the notary election more transparent

[07-Apr-19 08:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how more transparent can it be that on an open chain?

[07-Apr-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it is only not "transparent" because people dont know the details

{Reactions}
👆🏽 

[07-Apr-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
seems it is a communications issue as they cant find the info

[07-Apr-19 08:36 PM] Ludom#5832
Sorry guys, my goal wasn't to wait the last moment to say if it's good or not

[07-Apr-19 08:37 PM] Ludom#5832
I'm just the messenger of people who asked me in PM and fears to ask the question themself

[07-Apr-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
can they read english?

[07-Apr-19 08:38 PM] Ludom#5832
Yes they can 😃

[07-Apr-19 08:38 PM] Alright#0419
>Candidates are highly encouraged to submit a proposal before April 1st.

[07-Apr-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
dont we have URL we can send them to?

[07-Apr-19 08:38 PM] Alright#0419
highly encouraged

[07-Apr-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is a language issue

That's mean everything and nothing in th same time

[07-Apr-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
and using google translate doesnt mean you can read the language

[07-Apr-19 08:38 PM] Alright#0419
it does not say must

[07-Apr-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
for clarification, there is an open discord

[07-Apr-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
i think in different languages the degree of requirement is an ambiguous thing

[07-Apr-19 08:39 PM] Ludom#5832
Candidates are highly encouraged to submit a proposal before April 1st.

[07-Apr-19 08:40 PM] Ludom#5832
That's ambiguous in English no ?

[07-Apr-19 08:40 PM] Ludom#5832
😄

[07-Apr-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
in japanese I know, if you ask if it would be ok if someday you thought about doing something, it is like demanding that you will do it immediately

[07-Apr-19 08:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
make it legaleese and use "must", "shall", and "may"?

[07-Apr-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
that is not ambiguous in any way, encouraged to submit

[07-Apr-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
does not say disqualified if not submitted

[07-Apr-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
and the reality is that if your address has the most votes, you win

[07-Apr-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the first rule of NN elections:
1. the one with the most VOTE coins wins

[07-Apr-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
2. you need to be able to run an NN node

[07-Apr-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
3. see rule #1

✅ 

[07-Apr-19 08:41 PM] Ludom#5832
But do you need really to candidate ?

[07-Apr-19 08:41 PM] Ludom#5832
😃

[07-Apr-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, if you dont register your pubkeys, you cant be an NN

[07-Apr-19 08:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and the reality is that if your address has the most votes, you win`
I was thinking about that, cannot someone campaign wholly on their own, never submit to the candidate repo, and still get the job?

{Reactions}
👍 😂 

[07-Apr-19 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
as what to put in the source code?
