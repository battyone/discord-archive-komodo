pretty sure that's not a valid way to check if the notary truly mined it, that's why there is that additional tx I believe

[07-Apr-19 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There are 2 qualifiers

[07-Apr-19 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they are tested in two diffrent palces

[07-Apr-19 12:28 PM] SHossain#0007
every notary mined block also send an utxo of 0.0001 to RXL3YXG2ceaB6C5hfJcN4fvmLH2C34knhA for verification

[07-Apr-19 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
im checking it for you now 游땥

You can always edit the daemon to change it

[07-Apr-19 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the spent transaction is only there to make you aheb utxos to easy mine

[07-Apr-19 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it does nto check anythign apart from the pubkey IS a notary pubkey (any  of them) and that the size is corrrect

[07-Apr-19 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`the spent transaction is only there to make you aheb utxos to easy mine`
2 ifs fix that :troll:

No it doesnt genie

[07-Apr-19 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
becaus its a consensus enfored rule

[07-Apr-19 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
afer block 1 million

[07-Apr-19 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You will mine invalid blocks if you dont add the ntoary VIN

take those out and you mine all dam'd day
it's *not* consensus enforced

`int32_t komodo_check_deposit(int32_t height,const CBlock& block,uint32_t prevtime)` 
Its enfoiced in this function\

[07-Apr-19 12:33 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
that you need be NN for ez is; but on-demand is not

[07-Apr-19 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`return(-1 * (komodo_electednotary(&num,script+1,height,0) >= 0) * (height > 1000000));`

[07-Apr-19 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
Look at BEER, PIZZA, and TXSCLCC chains and tell me how many 1 tx (cb only) block there have been since we started this....

[07-Apr-19 12:35 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I bet it's more than 50%

[07-Apr-19 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not sure what you mean, I think your talking abpoiut something totally diffrent

this is oONLY on KMD

[07-Apr-19 12:41 PM] SHossain#0007
any other coin apart from KMD and `-ac_public` i prefer to use `z_shieldcoinbase` which is easy and less complicated

[07-Apr-19 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the changes to z_mergtoaddress in dev branch, do the same as z_sheildcoinbase but will skip iguana utxo.

[07-Apr-19 12:42 PM] Alright#0419
z_shieldcoinbase should work on any chain

[07-Apr-19 12:42 PM] Alright#0419
oh wait thought you meant z_merge

[07-Apr-19 12:42 PM] SHossain#0007
try on OUR 游땥

[07-Apr-19 12:43 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I still don't see where consensus requires a tx, @blackjok3r 游뱡游낗

[07-Apr-19 12:43 PM] SHossain#0007
z functionality is no longer present on KMD and and -ac_public chains has this disabled by default

[07-Apr-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Genie this is for mining KMD

[07-Apr-19 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
notaries must spend an iguana 10ksat utxo

[07-Apr-19 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its a consensus rule they must do this

where? I don't see it

[07-Apr-19 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It makes sure the notary miner actailly has the private key.,.. and stops nad actors just starting a thousand minng nodes and minnig to the ntoary pubkeys constatnly reorging the cahin.

[07-Apr-19 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I poseted the exact line... Its extremly confusing code

[07-Apr-19 12:46 PM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 check the first mined tx and last tx for this NN mined block https://kmdexplorer.io/block/0a8e376c2ae39f28f09559afd785cc38d4a447e9771d89b464e363eb8f3af2f2

[07-Apr-19 12:46 PM] SHossain#0007
every NN mined block has similar structure

[07-Apr-19 12:46 PM] SHossain#0007
if you don't have NN utxos or ran out of them, you will not be able to mine

[07-Apr-19 12:46 PM] SHossain#0007
even though you are eligible

[07-Apr-19 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@SHossain that it *is* done is not the same as it *must be* done

[07-Apr-19 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant comment out the stuff to add the utxo either and try to mine without it the block is rejected

[07-Apr-19 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Try it.. Im telling you it will fail check_deposit

[07-Apr-19 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Some very clever code does infact check it

[07-Apr-19 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I get what you're saying (despite not seeing it yet), I was addressing him posting explorer link

[07-Apr-19 12:48 PM] SHossain#0007
it must be done for NN easy mining

[07-Apr-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I added some prints to the check_deposit function when testing sync speed inprovments

[07-Apr-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe you can uncomemnt those and sync KMD from height 1 million to understand what its doing?

[07-Apr-19 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`else if ( height > 814000 )` 
After this line

[07-Apr-19 12:50 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
all I see is vout[0]

[07-Apr-19 12:50 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
which is cb, not the other

[07-Apr-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the part that woprks out the 0.0005 was spent is heigher up

[07-Apr-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`script = (uint8_t *)&block.vtx[0].vout[i].scriptPubKey[0];`

[07-Apr-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ther is 5000 sat created in the coinbase from "thin air"

[07-Apr-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then the last utxo for every KMD mined block sends 5000 sat to the CRYPTO address

[07-Apr-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and  5000 sat as fees that makes up for this supply.

[07-Apr-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Somehow that check_deposit function detects this 5000 sat

[07-Apr-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then make sure that block was mined by a notary pubkey

[07-Apr-19 12:52 PM] SHossain#0007
this is also my understanding ^^

[07-Apr-19 12:52 PM] SHossain#0007
since i'm no expert on code

[07-Apr-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the actual code is horribly confusing

[07-Apr-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont really understand it... but I do klnow that it works because I tested it

[07-Apr-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think that will work because the pubkey is not an elected notary pubkey

[07-Apr-19 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
actually, it's not *that* confusing, I just didn't see that bit before (which is why I asked you "where?" 游땥 )

[07-Apr-19 12:53 PM] Alright#0419
pubkey of cb vout?

{Reactions}
游녨 

[07-Apr-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the new block will fail the chek and be rejected

[07-Apr-19 12:54 PM] Alright#0419
so cb must have single vout to notary pubkey?

[07-Apr-19 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the pubkey of vout[0] of t vtx[0] MUST go to the notary pubkey that is elegible for the blokc height that is being mined

[07-Apr-19 12:54 PM] Alright#0419
so send a sat in vout 0

[07-Apr-19 12:54 PM] Alright#0419
rest to myself

[07-Apr-19 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guiess it can have mroe, as long as teh 5000 sat is in vout[0] abnd vout[0] is sent to the notary wallet

[07-Apr-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But Im not 100% sure on that... you would ned to try it..

[07-Apr-19 12:55 PM] Alright#0419
I will, give me some signed txes to play with?

[07-Apr-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
IMO just merge 3 KMD utxos.. in any case the wallet will bloat

[07-Apr-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know hwo to do that

[07-Apr-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not creating an elegible block then giving it to you

[07-Apr-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you would ahev like a few minutes to use it

[07-Apr-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
before its would be inelegible again

[07-Apr-19 12:56 PM] Alright#0419
don't need full block, only tx to RXL

[07-Apr-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats not how ti works though

[07-Apr-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it sends 5000 sat to RXL and the other 5000 sat is added as an extra nValue to the CB

[07-Apr-19 12:57 PM] Alright#0419
someone should give me a notary privkey to play with prior to the hard fork....

[07-Apr-19 12:58 PM] Alright#0419
not talking about that anymore

[07-Apr-19 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
In short the spent part and WHO CAN mine the block are diffrent validations...

[07-Apr-19 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the main thing is that the vout[0] is to tan eleigble notary

[07-Apr-19 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
but it can have additional vouts?

[07-Apr-19 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then secondary to that, 10000sat must be spent for any blocks m,ined to any notary pubkey

[07-Apr-19 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
1 sat to pubkey, rest to me

[07-Apr-19 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure.. .we all mine a single cb

[07-Apr-19 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as far as I know

[07-Apr-19 01:04 PM] SHossain#0007

@blackjok3r `when KMD generated:true utxos balance is over 11.`
Isn't sending to self the same as sending to anothere address and then back to our own?

[07-Apr-19 01:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I send everything in utxos over 10 to another address
