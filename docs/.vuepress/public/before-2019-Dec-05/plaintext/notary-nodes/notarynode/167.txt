BTCP up 83% today?

[23-Apr-19 08:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
thanks! Do you use `addnode` or `connect`?

[23-Apr-19 08:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
oh, it also prints the needed curl commands too

[23-Apr-19 08:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I did some tests with `connect` but had poor results

[23-Apr-19 08:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
it `addnotary` via curl

[23-Apr-19 08:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
`curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"iguana\",\"method\":\"addnotary\",\"ipaddr\":\"149.56.28.84\"}"`

[23-Apr-19 08:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
that script prints out the needed curl commands

we used to do it manually, but then I wrote that because I am lazy as fuck

[23-Apr-19 08:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
you don't have to run nn_ips.pl often, that data doesn't change much

[23-Apr-19 08:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm a fan of working harder early so I can be lazy later.

[23-Apr-19 08:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
so run it once, and find all your closest peers, use those IP's. Maybe check once a week or month if stuff changes

[23-Apr-19 08:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
IP's of real NN's won't change in the real season, except rarely

[23-Apr-19 08:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
but sometimes network conditions change, OVH could have a peering outage, etc..

[23-Apr-19 08:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
if there is some weird stuff with BGP going on, the NN network often notices. Connections between 2 NN's which should be fast start going thru rural China and things break

[23-Apr-19 11:40 AM] Alright#0419
likely the effect of every NN adding as many peers as they possibly can

[23-Apr-19 11:40 AM] Alright#0419
Oh it's low NN peer counts, not overall peer counts

[23-Apr-19 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
why is that an indication of a sick network?

[23-Apr-19 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto is there a reason why you wouldn't want to just addnotary every single IP you can find?

[23-Apr-19 11:45 AM] Mylo#8306
i could only guess that if you're not well connected, you get to XXXX00 block in KMD and then start doing your NN gossiping, and if you're not well connected, maybe are connected to fewer nodes that could be laggy themselves.... ?

[23-Apr-19 11:46 AM] Mylo#8306
maybe not network sick, just one node sick in network

[23-Apr-19 11:46 AM] Mylo#8306
lol @ rural china.

[23-Apr-19 12:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright better notarization performance/numbers if you only talk to those that are close, no timeouts, no huge latency waiting for a response, etc... Just like mining benefits from lower latency

[23-Apr-19 12:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
that script was developed, when there was peering issues between some NNs

[23-Apr-19 12:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
some BGP routes were fucked up for OVH/Hetzner or something, and it was trying to route our packets via pigeons in rural china

[23-Apr-19 12:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
so we routed around the damage

[23-Apr-19 12:13 PM] Alright#0419
are you actively blocking IPs of nodes that are not close?

[23-Apr-19 12:14 PM] Alright#0419
maybe not "actively blocking", but are you *only* connecting to a subset of the network?

[23-Apr-19 12:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
we only addnotary the subset of the network that is a reasonable network distance from us, or that don't have issues. we don't block anybody

[23-Apr-19 12:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
and that subset changes as network conditions change

[23-Apr-19 12:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's not a static list

[23-Apr-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
new nodes also propagate with each packet

[23-Apr-19 12:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, this is only the "starting list"

[23-Apr-19 12:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
it may not be needed in a healthy network environment, but we were dealing with weird issues last season

[23-Apr-19 12:41 PM] PHBA2061#2530
could you specify what are those weird issues ? I noticed weird things sometimes happened on testnet too, like double notas.

[23-Apr-19 12:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
there was broken BGP routes between datacenters that NNs were in

[23-Apr-19 12:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
and our packets had crazy high latency, or never arrived

[23-Apr-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
double notarizations should only happen if the notaries are not running the same version

i suggest all NNs subscribe to that to see how scary the inside of the internet can be

[23-Apr-19 12:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
BGP is what tells the internet where do send packets for IP 1.2.3.4

[23-Apr-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's below DNS

[23-Apr-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
and it barely works

[23-Apr-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
when myethwallet.com was hijacked and all that ETH stolen, that was a BGP hijack

[23-Apr-19 12:52 PM] jorian#4555
`there was broken BGP routes between datacenters that NNs were in`

[23-Apr-19 12:52 PM] jorian#4555
this normally happens when noobs are responsible, or it's something done on purpose

[23-Apr-19 12:53 PM] jorian#4555
(technically BGP doesn't have anything to do with DNS.. it's routing at the highest level)

[23-Apr-19 01:19 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
what is best / fast way to restart NN service ?

[23-Apr-19 01:19 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
do i need to run komodo-cli stop or can i just kill running processes ?

[23-Apr-19 01:19 PM] PHBA2061#2530
James, I'm not 100% sure about the version, but I think we're all running the the testnet iguana repo, 1 thing I notice is whenever double nota happens, it seems to me that the NN are split into 2 set, NN from the same set can communicate their mask between themselves, but not with NN from the other set.
For example, these are double nota that just happened recently on BEER
https://beer.kmdexplorer.io/tx/09b17740b67c253848e10dd61f91374ba51019c63b9890c2364a468b78b47229

and these are the mask values on my side (notice that about half of them are 0)

@Dr.Terminus  if you want to restart iguana, just  `./m_notary_testnet`

[23-Apr-19 01:22 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I can simply run that command even if it is already running without conflict?

[23-Apr-19 01:23 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
My node is stable, but here like 2 days later I've dropped from top 10 to bottom 5 lol

[23-Apr-19 01:24 PM] PHBA2061#2530
that is a script, `nano m_notary_testnet` and you'll see what it does, it `pkill -15 iguana` first, then `git pull` , then relaunch everything

[23-Apr-19 01:24 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
