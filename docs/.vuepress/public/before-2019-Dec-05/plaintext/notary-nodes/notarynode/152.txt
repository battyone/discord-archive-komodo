how big are your wallets?

[17-Apr-19 06:37 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah that too, read the most recent pin by blackjok3r, and try running that command for KMD and BEER, to see what is your response time

maybe remove it from the testnet

`time komodo-cli listunspent > /dev/null` only works for komodo

[17-Apr-19 06:47 PM] PHBA2061#2530
for BEER you have to insert a parameter

[17-Apr-19 06:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

I was talking to Luxor today about their current pools and asked about pirate, he said he was contemplating it and said if he added pirate he wanted to add KMD too because he likes KMD and asked if I could get him in touch with ARRR/KMD devs so I started a group chat with @FishyGuts and the 3 Luxor tech team members

Now Nick@ luxor is planning to or already has reached out to @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 because he was the one who created pirate solo, I didn't do this for this "campaign" and I don't care if we lose

However I wanted to share a very real result of basically my goals and potential value of expanding the KMD ecosystem whether its with a lot of small victories or also larger ones down the road. I believe everyone would agree a professional mining pool (which also sports a new payout scheme to the coins PPS) is always a welcome addition, especially for multiple KMD coins -- whats next maybe they'll add a veruscoin pool for @miketout 

The value proposition of my NN campaign could be explained in the example above, so contrary to @Alright criticism I believe I have one of the most unique proposals that aims to add value in a way that is not heavily focused on currently or historically.

[17-Apr-19 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
i expect as KMD price goes up more, we will start seeing more such hybrid candidates and that is all part of the growing process

[17-Apr-19 07:28 PM] VoskCoin#1869
& for the record I didn't do this just because we are running for a NN, this is just the product of working full-time in this and learning about projects that you see true merit in and looking forward to them making progress and helping where you can

even right now pirate is beating ZEC on a recent twitter poll I posted, all the small victories add up and that is how the current giants are toppled 🚀

jokes aside... when your wallet gets old, stained and heavy you replace it with a new one don't ya? 😉

[17-Apr-19 08:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
key is having a 2nd node with funds at the ready and only have enough funds in your nn to notarize successfully and maybe an alert that tells the 2nd node somehow "hey dad, i'm running low, can you send me some money please? promise i won't spend it on booze & hookers"

A few hours ago, someone said on this channel that there are double notas on testnet on BEER and that there is 2 revmasks that don't see each other. Can it happen on mainet of NN ? Can it be a risk ? (in case that some NN are not on the same chain for one AC)

[17-Apr-19 09:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
it can and it did

[17-Apr-19 09:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
iirc it was for OUR

[17-Apr-19 09:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
but as we controlled the nodes notarizing as the switch was during a common effort

[17-Apr-19 09:14 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I was thinking about that and this is my conclusion, please correct me if I'm wrong :
On mainnet there are 64 NN & minsigs is 13, which means only 13 NN are required to sign a nota transaction. So worst case scenario,  if 64 NN are separated into 4 groups  (each group has 13 NN at least and they don't see each other), theoretically we could see quadruple notas. It is not a risk as long as all NN are on the same chain, the only thing is they spend 4 times as much as required.
Please correct me if I'm wrong
