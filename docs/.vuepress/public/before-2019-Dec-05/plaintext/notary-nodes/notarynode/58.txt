I used CHMEX's bootstrap for KMD and it worked fine. I'll check that I don't have the same error

this same server held the #1 spot in LABS until I stopped it to do the test in Sydney 游땟

[30-Mar-19 08:03 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
so, I know it's not ports or nanomsg or anything like that (for the few that it did do here)

[30-Mar-19 08:12 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
hmmmm I think I figured it out

[30-Mar-19 08:12 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I think it's simultaneously trying to split and notarize

[30-Mar-19 08:13 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
and it says to itself "I can't do 2 things with the same UTXO"

[30-Mar-19 08:23 PM] Strob#3417
Maybe just reset all your utxo to zero by sending to yourself and resplit with one of the scripts.

so, the `error signing raw KMD utxoduplicates tx` is 100% related to the autosplitter, once I triple started it and forced it past 700 it went away

wow suddenly my notarization rate just doubled. I don't know why. It seems my pizza and beer are notarizing at the same time every 8 minutes

If you're using a utxo splitter, you need to do activate no split

dirty hack for testnet no split, think you'll have to do it each time you run m_notary_testnet or just make m_notary_testnet not rebuild iguana

I wouldnt recommend anyone use my scripts, Luke's are the best ones. I gave him mine early on and he improved them no end. Lucky for us he put them on git. Mine are outdated on git and bad. In the end in went with modifying iguana and komodod directly in the source code to improve performance. Scripts only get u so far. The number 1 "cheat" is to just disable autosplit and use 10% of the default utxos

[31-Mar-19 01:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Everyone can benifit from my multiple months of performance investigations. I mostly did it so we could scale out with smaller servers rather than my own stats. As you can see I came 9th on SH even tho my node is 2nd or 3rd every day ATM....

[31-Mar-19 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pro tip: 700 kmd utxo was the default before the locking of utxo chosen was added to help with collisions and double spends. With the locking now in iguana you can run very low numbers. Provided you split every 15 mins or so.

[31-Mar-19 01:37 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I drug over the splitter and stats we use in LABS 游땥

[31-Mar-19 01:41 AM] Strob#3417
Hi @Alright ! So for your dirty hack we can run m_notary_tesnet and then uncomment the line, save the file while iguana is running  and it will work?

[31-Mar-19 01:43 AM] Alright#0419
@Strob delete `~/2019NNtestnet/agents/iguana`, uncomment it and run `m_notary_testnet`

[31-Mar-19 01:43 AM] Alright#0419
you'll have to `git stash` before updating to add any new people

[31-Mar-19 01:44 AM] Alright#0419

@SHossain how many peers do you have on each chain?

all I know is there's 3 repos with NN tools I've cloned, but not looked at yet. Rumour is Luke Childs is the best at the moment. Still trying to figure out what the best utxo count target is

[31-Mar-19 04:35 AM] Alright#0419

[31-Mar-19 04:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

the smallest number you can manage basically

[31-Mar-19 04:38 AM] Alright#0419
Hmm just had an idea 游뱂

[31-Mar-19 04:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
best way to set utxo target? use nosplit + cron?

[31-Mar-19 04:38 AM] Alright#0419
the utxos don't need to be confirmed to use them in a notarization tx

[31-Mar-19 04:39 AM] Alright#0419
maybe they do, not sure other notaries would sign the tx if they don't have the previous tx it has created with yet

[31-Mar-19 04:39 AM] mrlynch#5735
nosplit + cron got me back on your tail :troll_hurt:

[31-Mar-19 04:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
how to nosplit without pkill iguana?

[31-Mar-19 04:41 AM] Alright#0419
it's a startup param, not sure you can

[31-Mar-19 04:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and each restart makes you weak for around an  hour?

[31-Mar-19 04:41 AM] mrlynch#5735
