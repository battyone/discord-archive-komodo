let's move away from dogs eating stuff cause mine just downed 2kg of meat and is now in mood for "kisses" and go back to "do we add zcl or not?!"

[22-Apr-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We can

[22-Apr-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[22-Apr-19 04:10 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I'll sync if it helps..

[22-Apr-19 04:11 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
simple as stopping komodo-cli then adding zcl chain specifiy my pubkey like with other AC's ?

[22-Apr-19 04:12 PM] CrisF#3405
I've got BCH syncing and ZCL building.

[22-Apr-19 04:59 PM] mrlynch#5735
make sure you create `~/.zclassic/zclassic.conf`

[22-Apr-19 05:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
after you start `zclassic-cli addnode "198.13.37.95:8033" "add"`

[22-Apr-19 05:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
other nodes are either ded or not accepting new conns

i just run it with default for now

[22-Apr-19 05:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
now, how do we convert the kmd U.. privkey to a zcl L... privkey

[22-Apr-19 05:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
or is that not required?

[22-Apr-19 05:27 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have KMD WIF, it is easy to convert using Agama for ZCL (not recommended for mainnet)

Can we do it with CLI (for testnet) ? Do you know how to do it ?

[22-Apr-19 05:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
gracias senor üòÉ

[22-Apr-19 05:28 PM] SHossain#0007
for new 3rd party coin that will be updated by Decker

[22-Apr-19 05:29 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you

[22-Apr-19 05:30 PM] SHossain#0007
generates WIF, pubkey and address

[22-Apr-19 05:33 PM] SHossain#0007
if the old HUSH and ZCL uses same format, you can use Decker's method even now

[22-Apr-19 05:34 PM] SHossain#0007
actually it is same

[22-Apr-19 07:28 PM] Lumbi#8378
wallet is getting slammed and cleanwallet seems not to work ü§î 
`./komodo-cli cleanwallettransactions

[22-Apr-19 07:30 PM] NNoperator#3835
@Lumbi   Have your tried Decker's wallet_reset_ac script?

[22-Apr-19 07:31 PM] Lumbi#8378
@NNoperator not yet... sounds perfect :abusedsmily:

[22-Apr-19 07:31 PM] Lumbi#8378
got a link?

[22-Apr-19 07:33 PM] eclips#1570
Check githubs of old notaries

I personally use lukechild's scripts

Wondering what to do when I see many of these:   ```2019-04-22 19:07:41 receive version message: /MagicBean:2.0.15rc2/: version 170007, blocks=86377, us=149.56.30.227:8922, peer=62

[22-Apr-19 07:35 PM] Strob#3417
I just tried Staked notary wallet reset but I should try Decker'S one cause it replaces the wallet.dat too!

[22-Apr-19 07:36 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@NNoperator bandwidth issues?

[22-Apr-19 07:37 PM] NNoperator#3835
should have 1 GBit up and down.

[22-Apr-19 07:37 PM] NNoperator#3835
but I do notice that my connection to the node is sluggish

[22-Apr-19 07:39 PM] NNoperator#3835
I'll try restarting the server.

[22-Apr-19 07:54 PM] Strob#3417
Yesterday I had only 6 nots for the last 6 hours, only cleaining I was doing was the cleanwallettransactions once a day but it didn't clean anything except for some tx in TXS. So I did the staked notary wallet reset and now I have 1 not every 15 minutes which is a huge improvement. So maybe not needed to use decker's script for now. Only difference is that decker script also recreate the wallet.dat file.

I'm also installing ZCL now.

[22-Apr-19 07:55 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi, does anyone know what this error is about?```EXCEPTION: 15dbwrapper_error
Database I/O error
Komodo in AppInit()```

[22-Apr-19 07:56 PM] CrisF#3405
Coming up when I start komodo.

[22-Apr-19 07:56 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe restart computer and try again
if that doesn't fix, start wallet with `-reindex`

[22-Apr-19 07:57 PM] CrisF#3405
Ok, I'll try that.  THanks.

[22-Apr-19 07:58 PM] Strob#3417
You can also try -reindex-chainstate first it's faster and may do the job

[22-Apr-19 07:58 PM] CrisF#3405
Cool, Thanks üëç

[22-Apr-19 07:59 PM] Strob#3417
That one is for when you only suspect corruption of the chainstate

[22-Apr-19 08:00 PM] Strob#3417
While reindex is for when the blocks on disk are actually corrupted

[22-Apr-19 08:05 PM] Alright#0419
are we doing a 3rd party coin?

[22-Apr-19 08:05 PM] Alright#0419
for testnet

[22-Apr-19 08:07 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
10 hrs later and the answer is still ü§∑üèΩ

[22-Apr-19 08:08 PM] Alright#0419
We don't need to make changes to the coin's codebase to make notarizations

[22-Apr-19 08:09 PM] Alright#0419
the iguana side will be the same

[22-Apr-19 08:09 PM] Alright#0419
only need daemon changes if we want nodes to recognize our notarizations as real checkpoints

[22-Apr-19 08:10 PM] Alright#0419
Can I suggest CMM? It's a zcash 2.02 fork that was started only a couple months ago. Should have a very tiny chain compared to others

[22-Apr-19 08:10 PM] Alright#0419
have some I can give everyone as well

[22-Apr-19 08:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'm down for any chain.. just finished syncing zcl

[22-Apr-19 08:35 PM] Alright#0419
how long did it take?

[22-Apr-19 08:36 PM] Alright#0419
I'm not sure adding a 3rd party coin is worth the time to be honest. I think anyone who shows they can properly op their node won't have a problem adding them

[22-Apr-19 08:36 PM] Alright#0419
Maybe it's worth it just for learning experience, but really it's not all that different from doing an assetchain

[22-Apr-19 08:36 PM] Alright#0419
some chain have special cases for txfees, maybe we should find a chain like that?

[22-Apr-19 08:37 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
How big is zcl?

Be aware that many many many security issues that get fixed in ZEC and KMD, don't in ZCL. Nobody there to care

[22-Apr-19 09:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
Many many.

Isn't ZCL ded? Last time I checked this project - it was swapped to some other coin

[22-Apr-19 09:29 PM] phm87#7395
ZCL had a community take over (but maybe it was swapped after I don t know). The repo mentionned here above is the last one I know

[22-Apr-19 09:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Last time I checked ~2 years ago so maybe it's alive now üòÉ

[22-Apr-19 09:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, BTCP - I wonder swap was into it

[22-Apr-19 09:31 PM] Alright#0419
there is BTCP and ANON

[22-Apr-19 09:31 PM] Alright#0419
both a chain split fork of ZCL

[22-Apr-19 09:32 PM] Alright#0419
maybe another, not sure

[22-Apr-19 09:32 PM] TonyL#3577
But it had Bitcoin in name so was definetly red flag for me lol

[22-Apr-19 09:32 PM] phm87#7395
it was forked to community takeover repo less than 2 years ago, maybe few months, I didn't check on github

[22-Apr-19 09:32 PM] Alright#0419
the BTCP redflag for me was when I realized noobs thought it was something innovative

[22-Apr-19 09:33 PM] Alright#0419
they thought it was the next ZEC or XMR

[22-Apr-19 09:33 PM] TonyL#3577
