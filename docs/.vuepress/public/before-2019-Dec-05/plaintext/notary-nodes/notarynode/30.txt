So confirmation is only when dpow came. Not the actual confirmation block

[20-Oct-18 08:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Dpow -> it s notarized -> confirmation : 1

[20-Oct-18 08:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
Rawconfirmation:1 ln the same time then at next block : confirmation : 2 ?

[20-Oct-18 08:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
So we won t have a way to calculate the block height it was mined just with confirmation and rawconfirmation, right ?

[20-Oct-18 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
confirmation 2 or bigger means notarized

[20-Oct-18 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
rawconfirmation is exactly what confirmations used to be

[20-Oct-18 08:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ok

[20-Oct-18 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it is only in FSM branch now

[20-Oct-18 08:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Makes sense if confirmation isn t just a notarized boolean

[20-Oct-18 08:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thought it would remain at 1

[20-Oct-18 08:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Didn t read right

[20-Oct-18 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it is stuck at 1 until notarized

[20-Oct-18 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
if notarized, it is normal value

[20-Oct-18 08:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
So basically you can have confirmation 1 rawconfirmation 17

[20-Oct-18 08:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ok

[20-Oct-18 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
0 means unconfirmed

[20-Oct-18 08:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Nice

[20-Oct-18 08:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Super nice :)

[20-Oct-18 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
1 means confirmed but not notarized

[20-Oct-18 08:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah you told me but I didn t realize it worrked that way. It s even better than what I imagined :D

@jl777c   correct VRSC branch is dev?

[21-Oct-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
master is probably better, but dev should work

[21-Oct-18 01:06 PM] BadAss#8800
anyone seen this?

[21-Oct-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
seems a rare error

[21-Oct-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
if it happens all the time, maybe it needs a resync.

We kept getting that on VULTR VPS... prety sure it was a out of ram issue

[21-Oct-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
try restarting the server

[21-Oct-18 01:26 PM] BadAss#8800
i already did

[21-Oct-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and then reindex the chain

[21-Oct-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that fixed it every time

[21-Oct-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
reindex, not sync

[21-Oct-18 01:26 PM] BadAss#8800
ok

Hi guys, in the documentation for setting up a test notary node there is a voice, saing that i have to send my btcpubkey to kolo. Someo e knows him and is thet step necessary for a test envirement? Thanks

[02-Nov-18 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We just started a trest nest net on #kmdlabs  if you are interested

@tony83 it's not for testnet, but for mainnet notaries.

[03-Nov-18 01:26 AM] kolo#1111
Testnet pubkeys list is on github, you can ask @SHossain or @webworker01 to add your pubkey there

[03-Nov-18 03:20 PM] tony83#9481
@kolo thanks for the info :)

[15-Nov-18 08:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
is it @Decker ?

[15-Nov-18 04:00 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes

[15-Nov-18 07:02 PM] Riddlez666#9550
does this support cryptonote coins?

[15-Nov-18 07:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Riddlez666 DPoW can work with any 256bit blockhash, which includes all CN forks that I know, but requires a decent amount of custom code to be written. Various CN coins are interested in DPoW, but nobody has gone "all in"

[15-Nov-18 07:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
this header will need to be rewritten to support a CN/XMR fork: https://github.com/MyHush/hush/blob/dev/src/komodo_validation011.h

@lukechilds @Decker runs kmdexplorer.ru.

[16-Nov-18 06:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
I've noticed both kmdexplorer.io and kmdexplorer.ru insight APIs have a rate limiter, however they don't seem to be using Insight's built in rate limiter, there's an NGINX rate limiter in front of it. The NGINX rate limiter doesn't have a `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header set in it's 503 response so browsers are forbidden from reading the responses and an attempt to make a request will throw an error.

This completely breaks the API. It means once you hit the rate limiter all requests will throw and you have no way of knowing why and no reasonable way to handle the error, you can't even read the status code to see if it's a 503, all you can see is that it's failed.

I will setup my own explorer for the KMD Ledger rewards app because it looks like it's going to be pretty heavy on the APIs but I'd advise anyone who's running NGINX in front of their insight API to configure the rate limiting properly or ideally disable it in favour of Insight's built in rate limiting.

[16-Nov-18 06:58 AM] lukechilds#2707
Ahh, looks like the problematic rate limiting is in here: https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo-explorers-install/blob/master/helper.sh

Thanks @CHMEX I will just spin up my own Insight server, it's got everything I need

[06-Dec-18 10:36 AM] jorian#4555
so we should waive the 2500$ fee on the basis of you buying at a certain price that in hindsight is a little higher than it is now?

[06-Dec-18 10:37 AM] jorian#4555
bro?

[06-Dec-18 10:38 AM] jorian#4555
the whitepaper doesn't promise any network effect in the future

[06-Dec-18 10:39 AM] jorian#4555
and if it did it still wouldn't have any effect on the fee imo. it costs 2500$, that is the price.

[06-Dec-18 10:39 AM] jorian#4555
anyways, just my opinion, the team will have to decide

[06-Dec-18 11:27 AM] Lumbi#8378
@jorian paying for crypto with fiat just seems flawed to me... but if you paid it you paid it, but maybe you didn't?

[06-Dec-18 11:29 AM] jorian#4555
i am no party in this question, which you already deleted, so this discussion becomes kind of useless now

[06-Dec-18 11:29 AM] Lumbi#8378
some countries like italy have tolls, others like germany do not...

[06-Dec-18 11:30 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The thing about the fee is that this is not just technology we provide and let you do whatever yoy want with it.

[06-Dec-18 11:30 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Dpow is a service.

[06-Dec-18 11:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
There is effort, time and money being spent continually to protect the coins that use this service.

[06-Dec-18 11:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So expenses need to be covered.

[06-Dec-18 11:32 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Other than the payments done to the notary nodes, the team that coordinates and keeps up with the maintenance of the network also needs to be paid.

[06-Dec-18 11:32 AM] Lumbi#8378
the price for dPoW is 365KMD.. or $2920 @ 8$... when I bought it. just sayin'

[06-Dec-18 11:33 AM] Lumbi#8378
If ETH charged 2.5k$ + 365ETH how many ERC20s would they have?

[06-Dec-18 11:34 AM] Lumbi#8378
I believe KMD can get there, but gatekeeping ain't helpin' anybody in the long run.

[06-Dec-18 11:42 AM] Lumbi#8378
anyway I don't want to spam the chat with this issue.. whatever the team decides siu will PM me.
