I can stop it and run it

[04-Apr-19 03:33 PM] zatJUM#9924
that's all?

[04-Apr-19 03:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
U never have to restart her unless the coin file changes

[04-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Alright#0419
just don't stop it ever

[04-Apr-19 03:34 PM] Alright#0419
unless the network is changing keys or updating iguana itself

[04-Apr-19 03:34 PM] zatJUM#9924

Finally!!! Decker autosplit really working  on cron this time: here's my cron job log: 
```css

```
My error: I was running cron as root and  as such it couldn't find the komodo.conf file. At one point I switch to root to be able to log to var/log, but now I run as my user and instead I just log to the same folder as the script. üòë

@Strob never run any full daemon as root, nor any cron as root that doesn't need the permission

Usually, I like to create a separate linux user per coin daemon (and sometimes put it alone inside a docker container OR on a VM only for the coin), I don't know if this is possible with iguana (maybe the docker container is possible). In some cases, coin daemon are running on different VM. @metaphilibert  told me that it is possible but some changes should be performed in iguana to run with several servers/VM. Do you have an opinion on this ?

[04-Apr-19 05:08 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Is `-notary` still a param that needs to be used?

[04-Apr-19 05:28 PM] Strob#3417
@dukeleto I was trying to use sudo crontab -e so yes it made the cron run as root I won't  try that anymore. you are right!

[04-Apr-19 07:55 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
depends on how many nodes are in your queue

[04-Apr-19 07:55 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

@mrlynch  the only thing for me that could help boost my performance is an upgrade to a 4x 970 pro nvme in raid 0 (this one has a huge boost in random read compared to 960 pro) . With 2 other servers always ready as backup keeping all chain in sync.

[04-Apr-19 11:46 PM] Strob#3417
That way we eliminate any hard drive bottleneck and also eliminate downtimes by switching to backup servers in case of problems.

About increasing maxconnections: 
```css
Bitcoin by default will not make more than 8 outgoing connections, and -maxconnections only controls how many incoming connections you allow. Feel free to set this higher, but it will take time before others connect to you in large numbers.

Please don't change this, as there is no need. Connectable peers on the network are a scarce resource, and essential to the decentralization. If people go try connect to all of them like some sites do, we'll very quickly run out.

In case you're a merchant or miner, you perhaps want to set up a few fixed connections to trusted others (see the -addnode command line/config option), but having more connections does not mean stronger verification (the reference client always verifies everything) or even faster relaying (as you'll slow down by distributing new blocks and transactions to all your peers). It is mostly a matter of providing a service to the network.

How does one attain 1,000+ connections like blockchain.info?
At this moment, blockchain.info has over 1,900 nodes connected to their bitcoin client.

I have been running an m1.small ubuntu 12.04 server and bitcoind for ~4 days straight now with no reboots. My

And:
```
1.) By changing MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS, the client will go on connecting until it reaches 1000 proactive connections.

2.) By changing the sleep timeout new connections are tried more frequently.

Compile and install bitcoind:

$ sudo make -f makefile.unix
$ sudo mv bitcoind /usr/bin
Don't forget to set the maxconnections in bitcoin.conf:

maxconnections=1000
Start bitcoind and your done. The client will make lots of connections really fast.

Disclaimer: As Pieter Wuille pointed out, it can harm the network to run a modified client like this one. Please use this solution for research purposes only and not as a permanent solution.
