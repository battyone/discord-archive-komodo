and in crontab you can set any job to send alerts to telegram i.e.:
`clean=$(~/nnutils/cleanwallettransactionskmdandacs.sh | tee -a ~/logs/clean_wallet.log 2>&1) && ~/nnutils/telegram/telegram_send.sh "[Clean Wallet Report]\%0A ${clean}"`

[03-May-19 08:57 AM] mrlynch#5735
that's what i've got

i want to setup zabbix for all servers though... have pretty dashboards and wall full of monitors

better visualization than tmux i reckon

[03-May-19 09:03 AM] Mylo#8306
that spits out your UTXO count for assetchains via telegram.  handy sometimes 😃

[03-May-19 09:05 AM] mrlynch#5735
i'm aware of the security risk. but i'm looking at dwy's stats dashboard setup -> have a json scp-ed to a proxy and make a template.. unfortunately i don't know zabbix that well, challenge is making a template out of a json

[03-May-19 09:05 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah - json scp is best

[03-May-19 09:05 AM] Mylo#8306
just scp text files with values,   not even a key=value.  just value.

custom monitoring type

[03-May-19 09:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
thanks for the tip... we had zabbix at one of my previous jobs, but it was all internal

[03-May-19 09:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
getting it to work securely across multiple dc's ... not really keen on it

[03-May-19 09:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
but for ease of monitoring i have to come up with something 😄

[03-May-19 09:06 AM] Mylo#8306
there's a helpful tutorial for zabbix on monitoring if a file exists.   it will report 1, and your graph will be happy.

[03-May-19 09:07 AM] Mylo#8306
follow that tutorial.

[03-May-19 09:07 AM] Mylo#8306
same thing, except for if file exists, read the value out of the file.

[03-May-19 09:07 AM] Mylo#8306
i used to do this for SIP trunk latencies.

[03-May-19 09:07 AM] mrlynch#5735
thanks

[03-May-19 09:08 AM] Mylo#8306
zabbix used to have agents communicate unencrypted.  you can use stunnel to encrypt between agent -> server or agent -> proxy.  but much safer to scp values to a filename on an external box.

[03-May-19 09:09 AM] Mylo#8306
i think they use encryption now 😃

[03-May-19 09:09 AM] mrlynch#5735
they use stunnels now

[03-May-19 09:09 AM] Mylo#8306
lol

[03-May-19 09:09 AM] mrlynch#5735
so maybe that could work, after all it's an outbound connection to a proxy 🤔

[03-May-19 09:10 AM] mrlynch#5735
i just have to trust the agent 😄

[03-May-19 09:11 AM] Mylo#8306
no.  def not :D
unless you audit the code.   you lose your keys to someone it's all over.

[03-May-19 09:15 AM] mrlynch#5735
`Connections in Zabbix can use:

no encryption (default)
RSA certificate-based encryption
PSK-based encryption`

thanks for that... am thinking at 2 centos 7 boxes - server & proxy; nodes -> proxy -> server; silly monkey (me) watches dashboard from server 😄

[03-May-19 09:19 AM] mrlynch#5735
and have them 2 boxes on the same lan

[03-May-19 09:20 AM] mrlynch#5735

[03-May-19 09:39 AM] Mylo#8306
@TonyL has tested centos fyi @mrlynch not sure what you're using atm.
worst case you can compile everything like gentoo 😃

[03-May-19 09:40 AM] mrlynch#5735
using deb 9 atm.. running daemons on centos is more of a "it can be done, here's how" kinda thing

[03-May-19 09:42 AM] TonyL#3577
I've stopped my tests because of no visual demand 😃

[03-May-19 09:52 AM] Mylo#8306
did you have any notes @TonyL ?

[03-May-19 09:53 AM] TonyL#3577
I tested only Agama and it did not work properly

[03-May-19 09:54 AM] Mylo#8306
oh like desktop, not compiling komodo

[03-May-19 09:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, used GUI 😃 Can try to compile Komodo, sounds like an intetesting quest

[03-May-19 09:55 AM] Mylo#8306
i used to compile voip systems on centos 6, i'll get the pre-req list as a starter on a gist

[03-May-19 09:58 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
How does it work if somebody is only "running" a node for a team or somebody else, but also has their own node in the same region? How would that issue be addressed?

[03-May-19 09:58 AM] Mylo#8306

[03-May-19 09:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
well, it seems that there's enough interest in centos/fedora to get this goin.. 3 of us is enough right? 😂

[03-May-19 09:59 AM] Mylo#8306
not for me for prod without testing for ages

[03-May-19 10:00 AM] mrlynch#5735
i only said to get it going 😄

[03-May-19 10:03 AM] Mylo#8306
testing a quick compilation now

[03-May-19 10:09 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
In relation to chats earlier. I personally believe that the more new notaries, the more new and exciting people/teams will be able to devote time to the KMD ecosystem (although as proven by a lot of people in here, not being a NN doesnt proclude you from inputting into to the ecosystem). Having multiple nodes would also aid some people to devoting almost full time work to the ecosystem which I see as the main benefit or reason to vote somebody, or some specific project in for multiple nodes.
My personal opinion for the question I posed just before is that if you're "running" a node for somebody or some team, you are apart of that team, therefor, you shouldnt be able to run for another node, personally or with another team.

[03-May-19 10:14 AM] Mylo#8306
agree on everything but the multiple team rule.    the same region different team is interesting.   i've done it on purpose to see what happens.

[03-May-19 10:24 AM] Mylo#8306
@kolo same sys admin, different team, same region.   what is the rule?

[03-May-19 10:29 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
If you're running a node, you're effectively the one securing komodo and all of the assetchains. If Notary Node "sysadmins" are allowed, it will pave the way of a select few actually knowing how to run NN's who are paid by teams to run the nodes for them. Isnt the whole idea of having 4 regions with different node operators to decentralise the notarisation process. If what you're saying is allowed. You could have a single region where 1 person "sysadmins" every single node in that region. This could actually happen if people didnt know the team they were voting for hired someone to run their node for them.

{Reactions}
👍 

[03-May-19 10:37 AM] Mylo#8306
this is extreme:  `You could have a single region where 1 person "sysadmins" every single node in that region. `
this will probably happen one day: `hired someone to run their node for them`
i'm not arguing against, just pointing out some weakness.  refine it a bit to make a better case.

[03-May-19 10:40 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It may seem "extreme", but it is achieveable within that rule set. Which will in turn make people question "are komodo notary nodes actually decentralised" (more than they already do, justified or not).
Im not trying to call you out @Mylo I am just questioning the system more than anything. I want the notarisation process to be the best it can be, as it was intended to be. 
As you've stated yourself in your cakeshop proposal `"Mylo is the lead tech of the komodo pioneers team"` and komodo pioneers have said you're part of their team in their proposal `"Some of our team are Komodo Platform team members (mylo, "`

[03-May-19 10:41 AM] Mylo#8306
yep i'm on the webpage too 😃

[03-May-19 10:41 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I appreciate the disclosure and openness!

[03-May-19 10:41 AM] Mylo#8306
it's a DAO concept, so anyone is a pioneer 😄

[03-May-19 10:43 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah, i'm interested in getting a somewhat watertight set of rules, like the legal framework, it's something to challenge and fix

[03-May-19 10:43 AM] Mylo#8306
watertight is wrong word.   a loose set of rules that has clear guidelines etc.

[03-May-19 10:44 AM] Mylo#8306
it's a purposely tricky situation.  thanks for raising it

[03-May-19 10:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Notary Node consensus rules perhaps?
No worries, again, I dont doubt your ability, or question your contribution to the community, just questioning whether this is within the rule set or not. Happy to discuss openly.

[03-May-19 11:08 AM] Mylo#8306
ditto 100% & thanks for your kind words :)
no hard feelings, cakeshop SH is there for this reason.

It’s easy, if we find someone running two nodes in a same region - we disqualify both.

[03-May-19 12:10 PM] kolo#1111
If sysadmin as hired sysadmin - that’s not a problem as long, as you’re not a single person for both nodes.

@Mylo

[03-May-19 12:15 PM] kolo#1111
Most of the tricky rules IMO should be not the rules, but decisions made by voters. It’s their work to select better nn. If they see one person running under two names and still vote for him up to “elected” amount for both... uh... they shoot in both legs... 😉

@kolo

[03-May-19 03:33 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I think what he meant here is if the person who managed the nodes is hired, then the teams won't be disqualified if it happens to be the same person

[03-May-19 04:40 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Are there no other NN's/NN candidates/komodo holders/dpow coin holders that have opinions on this? I would be interested to hear them.

[03-May-19 04:47 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Also @kolo you mention that it is "your opinion". But confirm you're the election master? (Feel free to fill me in of these duties if I am misguided)
I apologise if I'm questioning too many controversial topics. I also don't blame other NN candidates for not commenting. I understand how this could negatively impact their candidateship.

[03-May-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as you arent running more than one node in a region, there is no controversy

[03-May-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
if you do, then you need to make sure it is an allowed case, otherwise disqualified
