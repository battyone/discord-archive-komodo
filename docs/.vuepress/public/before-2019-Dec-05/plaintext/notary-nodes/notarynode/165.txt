Can someone do 
ls doge* in iguna/coins? Maybe we already have it?

[22-Apr-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That might be a good idea, see what coins files iguana has already

[22-Apr-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Super easy

[22-Apr-19 01:34 PM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, too big for testnet...

[22-Apr-19 01:35 PM] newvulcan#4719
Doge not in there

[22-Apr-19 01:35 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
35.12 GB üò¶

[22-Apr-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ltc is but that's prolly bigger than doge, last time I saw way over 60gb

[22-Apr-19 01:36 PM] newvulcan#4719
Is ZEX an option ?

[22-Apr-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181

Seems you've missed much of the last 3 weeks of conversations :troll:

[22-Apr-19 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I have been busy working after the first few days here, community got this, everyone doing a great job helping each other out

is there a coin that was recently  successfully 51% attacked?

[22-Apr-19 01:45 PM] CHMEX#0686
maybe use that one and do a bit of marketing after

[22-Apr-19 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Bch may be possible? Who has a server big enough to sync it already?

I do, haha.

[22-Apr-19 01:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
i have enough space as well

[22-Apr-19 01:47 PM] CrisF#3405
It would be cool to do a real coin.

[22-Apr-19 01:47 PM] CrisF#3405
A bigger one I mean.

[22-Apr-19 01:47 PM] CHMEX#0686
DGB they are around long

[22-Apr-19 01:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
ethereum classic was hit by 51% ü§î

[22-Apr-19 01:48 PM] CHMEX#0686
that might be a lot of work it's not a BTC fork

[22-Apr-19 01:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
vertcoin?

[22-Apr-19 01:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
nvm it's on lyra

[22-Apr-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The pow alto isn't important vtc is possible too

[22-Apr-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Etc is impossible

[22-Apr-19 01:51 PM] CHMEX#0686
so VTC it's 5GB

[22-Apr-19 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sounds like a candidate... But all this does is make tx on the chain, they will not be valid notas

[22-Apr-19 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Vtc has said in the past they don't want dpow

[22-Apr-19 01:52 PM] CHMEX#0686
I see

[22-Apr-19 01:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
I also have rvn but don t know the dev, both coins are very similar to their forkbase, zxcept masternodes

[22-Apr-19 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They have a form of 51% attack prevention already tho

[22-Apr-19 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not as good a dpow tho

we picking chain to add to testnet?

[22-Apr-19 01:58 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes

[22-Apr-19 01:59 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
https://www.crypto51.app/coins/ZET.html is free to 51% ?

[22-Apr-19 01:59 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ZCL been thrown out ?

[22-Apr-19 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Zcl can be done too

btw I ll be in contact with little market coin as soon as I ll have it launched, so I can also promote dpow :p

[22-Apr-19 02:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
so if LABS is searching for real coins to secure, maybe this can help

[22-Apr-19 02:05 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I think it would be cool if next years testnet includes a few real coins that  aren't already dPoW'd, maybe selected by twitter vote or something

[22-Apr-19 02:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
not the same side : not securing there but giving a preview of dpow for those coins

[22-Apr-19 02:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
problem is they need to update their code

[22-Apr-19 02:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
so it must be planned

[22-Apr-19 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
99% of the work to make it actually do anything is daemon side and is not the simplest of tasks to add. Making the notarizarions is fairly easy, iguana was designed to work with all btc based coins

[22-Apr-19 02:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
if you want to ntrz IT, not **on** it

[22-Apr-19 02:13 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm pretty keen on BCH.  Like the idea of a bigger coin.
I'll put up 500KMD towards it.

[22-Apr-19 02:14 PM] CrisF#3405
Pain in the ass due to the size I know, but figure it would be good to see how my server handles that.

[22-Apr-19 02:15 PM] CrisF#3405
Might need to give a little time if people need to sort out their servers.

[22-Apr-19 02:17 PM] CrisF#3405
Let's go big.

[22-Apr-19 02:18 PM] mrlynch#5735
can i have that 500 kmd to buy bch? :troll_cool: think we'll only need 10 kmd worth for testing üòÅ

[22-Apr-19 02:19 PM] CrisF#3405
Suppose that leaves me with 490 change, haha.

[22-Apr-19 02:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
well... :realpirate:

[22-Apr-19 02:38 PM] mrlynch#5735
given the fact that z11 farms are powering up (see zec hashrate) would it be a good use case / possible to do zcl or btcp?

[22-Apr-19 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
He's asking to do zcl or btcp on testnet

[22-Apr-19 02:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We need to wait on that. There has been no answer from their team.

[22-Apr-19 02:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, yeah, i guess that if it is for testnet it can be tested, no problems.

[22-Apr-19 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So zcl? That should be pretty easy.. Don't have to be the only one @CrisF

[22-Apr-19 02:53 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm fine to do both. The 500 is there on BCH still.

[22-Apr-19 02:55 PM] CrisF#3405
What ever is decided is good with me.

[22-Apr-19 03:01 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
