I am assuming it wont be hard to make such a text rotator?

[18-Apr-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i understand not all chains have a website or even page, but we could at least link them to some blog post

Nice idea.
Do we have a list of all public assetchains ? I saw a list on dexstats.info but I don't know if it is complete

[18-Apr-19 05:16 PM] phm87#7395
Pools should also display a link to the bitcointalk announcement, discord invite link for each assetchain

[18-Apr-19 05:16 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you webworker

hmmm, walletreset.sh having issues here.. left it in StakedNotary, do I need it elsewhere ?

[18-Apr-19 05:18 PM] phm87#7395
For altcoins, we usually add a link to github but for AC the command line to sync the AC can be interesting

which script you use @phm87 ?

[18-Apr-19 05:20 PM] phm87#7395
Mostly manual scripts and few automated ones

[18-Apr-19 05:21 PM] phm87#7395

[18-Apr-19 05:23 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[18-Apr-19 05:23 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
well, wallets do need cleaning ~ once a day yes ?

[18-Apr-19 05:24 PM] phm87#7395
I have a .sh script that is calling ``/home/wallets/split/utxosplitter.sh`` each 900 seconds

[18-Apr-19 05:25 PM] phm87#7395
and another .sh script that is calling ``/home/wallets/StakedNotary/clean_wallet.sh`` once per 12 hours

[18-Apr-19 05:25 PM] phm87#7395
@webworker01  so do you think that I should run the utxosplitter.sh less often ?

[18-Apr-19 05:25 PM] Alright#0419
run it as often as needed to maintain >1 UTXO

[18-Apr-19 05:26 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I dont have clean_wallet.sh in my StakedNotary folder..

`Do we have a list of all public assetchains ?`
yes
`$ cat komodo/src/assetchains.json | jq  ".[].ac_name"`

[18-Apr-19 05:29 PM] phm87#7395
@webworker01  the /home/wallets/split/utxosplitter.sh script that I'm running each 900 seconds counts the utxo and make the split only if it is needed. But I agree that it can be enhanced (mylynch gave ideas yesterday or the day before)

[18-Apr-19 05:30 PM] Alright#0419

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  as we discussed here above, komodo/src/assetchains.json  doesn't contain all assetchains (but maybe only dpowed AC)

[18-Apr-19 05:30 PM] phm87#7395
why did some AC remove dpow ?

[18-Apr-19 05:31 PM] Alright#0419
dead coins

[18-Apr-19 05:31 PM] phm87#7395
if the last nodes of an AC are the NN themselves (and no exchanges and no users), ok I can imagine that it is dead

[18-Apr-19 05:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` doesn't contain all assetchains`
an example of one not there?

[18-Apr-19 05:32 PM] phm87#7395

about -26 error, I'll check in iguana tv but ... is there any .log file created by default of iguana tv ? Or should we launch iguana with a command that throw the output to a .log file ?

[18-Apr-19 06:27 PM] Alright#0419
`>> iguana.log` should do it

[18-Apr-19 06:27 PM] Alright#0419

Maybe -26 specific to kmdlabs iguana. Just an assumption because Im using default iguana and dont have -26 since first day of participation in testnet but in kmdlabs notas -26 I had quite often

[18-Apr-19 09:34 PM] phm87#7395
equihash stratum of yiimp is not opensource. Crackers owns it and he shared with me because he likes me. I'll try to push crackers to open-source it (or at least a part).
But a part of it is not developed yet (rental) and I'd be interested in this part. I heard that this old implementation is not compatible with rental mode of yiimp. Rental works for most of the algos into yiimp. Rental is a mini nicehash (but we can replace BTC by KMD)

[18-Apr-19 09:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Crackers owns it `
that you got it from him doesn't mean he "owns" it

[18-Apr-19 09:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_can easily find it on github and thinks it would be nice if the NN that has a copy would release it to the rest of the ecosystem_

If I am elected, I won't sell my NN seat and I won't open-source my private key (yeah that's some crazy idea)

CG : To help, I can show you some github repos with nearly everything for the algo part (maybe 10 lines are missing) but the algo part is a copy paste from Zcash of 2016 with some C adaptation (yiimp stratum is mix of C and C++). But the huge part of the work (rpc stuff and block header things), ther are into kmd nomp but I didn't find these for yiimp on github

[18-Apr-19 09:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I know very well ma7555 but the changes he made are only for front end

[18-Apr-19 09:41 PM] phm87#7395
basically, ma7555 is using snomp and kmd nomp as stratum + payments but he is using yiimp for data (price and profit)

[18-Apr-19 09:42 PM] phm87#7395
oddhome repo have some code for the stratum

You miss the point of everything I've ever said on the subject
I have never, do not, and likely will never use yiimp
We are a collaborative community and shouldn't have to comb the planet for shit that would help the community that members of the community alreay have (and have shared freely with people they like)
