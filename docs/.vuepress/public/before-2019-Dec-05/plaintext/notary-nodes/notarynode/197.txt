i'm glad that no one shares GoT info here

[14-May-19 12:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

off topic is anti-safespace I guess

Stop this here, go to #talk-other-topics

[14-May-19 12:49 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
its more entertaining watching the internet flip out over the show than the show itself IMO

[14-May-19 12:50 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
killer visuals though for real

[14-May-19 01:44 AM] Greer#0666
There was some discussion in here about notarizing chains at risk of 51% attack such as BTCP.  BTCZ has been under attack for a couple of days and is looking for help.

[14-May-19 01:44 AM] Greer#0666
I'm not affiliated, just in a server where a discussion is taking place

Congratulations to everyone who participated the election! 🎉 
Thanks to @Alright  and @SHossain  for setting up the testnet. It really provided an amazing place to gain experience and learn.  
And, as Cryptoon said, thanks to @kolo  and those who set up the elections.
To all those who provided support and VOTE2019, I'm very humbled and grateful. Thank you so much!
Certainly an amazing group of people here.  Komodo is in good hands.

A good race this year with a lot of new competitors. Scored higher in overall performance than last year. Glad to see Voskcoin made it, as did many other dedicated candidates !

[14-May-19 02:37 PM] Ondalf#1318
just a random question, will there be some drill days for testnet at some point, or only month before elections?

[14-May-19 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
drill days?

[14-May-19 02:39 PM] Ondalf#1318
i was particulary interested of the dust attack, which was tested in testnet with NNs

[14-May-19 02:39 PM] Ondalf#1318
or well - tx attack

[14-May-19 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's actually more related to a wallet and not necessarily NN related
so, you could test out solutions at any time

[14-May-19 02:41 PM] Ondalf#1318
if those things emerges, i could come to party to try out things, if needed
