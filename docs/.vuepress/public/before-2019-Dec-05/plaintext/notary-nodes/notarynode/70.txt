Haha if u merge it forward with z_mergetoaddress with the minimum size option at the end, u can mine

[01-Apr-19 03:31 PM] Strob#3417
Same both as @jorian @CrisF . I use cleanwallettx command, send to my self resynched pizza beer and tx, keep utxo low noautosplit using cron, restarted everything a few times. still very slow since adding tx I have been notarizing almost only BEER. and now since we added 3 friends not a single notarization...

[01-Apr-19 03:32 PM] Strob#3417
I added more peer too with add node that I still don't understand.

[01-Apr-19 03:32 PM] Strob#3417
In the meantime I'm installing another server and I will swap it when ready

[01-Apr-19 03:32 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I try and restart as little as possible...

[01-Apr-19 03:32 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
havent run cleanwallet yet

[01-Apr-19 03:33 PM] CHMEX#0686
@CrisF I think it got it sorted now

[01-Apr-19 03:33 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
self send every time theres a restart (or send to jok3r)

[01-Apr-19 03:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cronsplit ftw

Thanks @CHMEX.  I was mainly wondering if it would give me some clues as to why my node performed so badly today.

[01-Apr-19 03:36 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
did you change anything? you were kicking ass yesterday

[01-Apr-19 03:37 PM] CrisF#3405
I just did some addnodes.

[01-Apr-19 03:38 PM] CrisF#3405
Apart from that just the restart for the chain.

[01-Apr-19 03:38 PM] Strob#3417
SHossain and smk762 you are doing 1 notrz every 6 minutes!! 🔥

[01-Apr-19 03:38 PM] Strob#3417

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator The node is still crawling.

[01-Apr-19 03:39 PM] CrisF#3405
Quite a dramatic change.

[01-Apr-19 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_thinks someone needs to bootstrap TXSCLCC_

[01-Apr-19 03:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
180k blocks takes a bit to sync 😦

[01-Apr-19 03:48 PM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain Could you please add 2019NN operators tags to todays newcomers? (@Deleted User , @popcornbag, me)

[01-Apr-19 06:28 PM] Strob#3417
One thing I didn't do before now is adding all the NN ip and addnode to failto ban ignore list

[01-Apr-19 06:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 when building LABS iguana is there anything that needs to be modded apart from m_notary_testnet?

[01-Apr-19 06:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
everything mentioned in the 2019 readme needs to be there too

[01-Apr-19 06:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
when building?

[01-Apr-19 06:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it builds itself

[01-Apr-19 06:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all of the `m_` files = 'make'

[01-Apr-19 06:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
iirc

[01-Apr-19 06:32 PM] newvulcan#4719
May I just check something. Is it mandatory for the vote address to be tied to the NN via its pubkey or does it just need to be set up on the NN or simply a new address in Agama ? Just been reading back through the posts and I noticed an entry concerning the vote address being associated with the pubkeyon the NN.

[01-Apr-19 06:33 PM] Strob#3417
Is there any reason why all the ip are not added to the testnet.json file?

[01-Apr-19 06:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
so... copy all `m_` files from 2019testnet to SuperNET/iguana?

[01-Apr-19 06:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
and build?

[01-Apr-19 06:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Is it mandatory for the vote address to be tied to the NN via its pubkey or does it just need to be set up on the NN or simply a new address in Agama ?`
they can be different

[01-Apr-19 06:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Is there any reason why all the ip are not added to the testnet.json file?`
all which IPs?

[01-Apr-19 06:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
or just build in SupeNET/iguana and copy agents/iguana to 2019testnet/agents/.

[01-Apr-19 06:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
?

[01-Apr-19 06:34 PM] Strob#3417
there a only 8 first nn ip

[01-Apr-19 06:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
did u git pull?

[01-Apr-19 06:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@mrlynch go the other way, copy sn/iguana to 2019 /iguana

[01-Apr-19 06:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
ok.. let's try

[01-Apr-19 06:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`there a only 8 first nn ip`
those are seed nodes

[01-Apr-19 06:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there are "only" that many of them

😕 

[01-Apr-19 06:42 PM] Strob#3417
In fail2ban is it better to add other nodes'ip so they can connect?

[01-Apr-19 06:48 PM] Strob#3417
My ip is in there as weel as the ip of the first 8 NNtestnetOp

[01-Apr-19 06:49 PM] PHBA2061#2530
you can check whether if you're connect to other nodes or not with this  for example
`komodo-cli -ac_name=PIZZA getpeerinfo`

[01-Apr-19 06:50 PM] Strob#3417
Yes Idid it but I noticed I have a lots less than SHossain

[01-Apr-19 06:51 PM] Strob#3417
my peerinfo: kmd 16

[01-Apr-19 06:51 PM] Strob#3417
beer 16

[01-Apr-19 06:51 PM] Strob#3417
pizza 16

[01-Apr-19 06:51 PM] Strob#3417
txsclcc 14

[01-Apr-19 06:56 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah, it's weird that you have 5 peers less than me for each.

[01-Apr-19 06:59 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Strob do you have the p2p ports open in the firewall?

[01-Apr-19 06:59 PM] Strob#3417
yes

[01-Apr-19 07:00 PM] Strob#3417
But I just opened them in UFW

[01-Apr-19 07:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
give it a bit of time

[01-Apr-19 07:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
it will take a while for new connections to pop up

[01-Apr-19 07:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
isn't 16 the default set max?

[01-Apr-19 07:01 PM] Strob#3417
Defaults set where?

[01-Apr-19 07:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I could be wrong, but iirc, 16 is the max set by code if you don't set an amount in conf file

[01-Apr-19 07:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`maxconnections=...`
no?

[01-Apr-19 07:03 PM] Strob#3417
Do you have maxconnection in yours?

[01-Apr-19 07:03 PM] Strob#3417
me mnot

[01-Apr-19 07:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think mine's set at 25

[01-Apr-19 07:05 PM] Strob#3417
cool I will try 1000

[01-Apr-19 07:05 PM] Strob#3417
or 125

[01-Apr-19 07:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
too many and you defeat yourself

[01-Apr-19 07:07 PM] Strob#3417
ok... 25 then

[01-Apr-19 07:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_just remembered that's a hard sourcecode limit_

[01-Apr-19 07:28 PM] Strob#3417
isn't the limit 125

[01-Apr-19 07:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
<https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/src/net.cpp#L51>

[01-Apr-19 07:31 PM] Strob#3417
Then that means I have no inbound connections?

[01-Apr-19 07:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
inbound is determined by several factors (including they are dropped if they slow down propagation)

[01-Apr-19 07:41 PM] newvulcan#4719
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Cool, Thanks

[01-Apr-19 07:42 PM] Strob#3417
@CrisF  Seems like you are back on track 🚋 Can I ask what was your solution? I'm still not notarizing anything (1 in the last 6 hours). I can't figure out what's wrong.

[01-Apr-19 07:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@newvulcan for what?

[01-Apr-19 07:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
