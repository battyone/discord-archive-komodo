so  like past years, 32 automatic reelected and 32 possible candidates form 4 regions right ( 8 for regions) ?

[14-Mar-19 11:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
Nope

[14-Mar-19 11:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
4 dev nodes (locked spots)

[14-Mar-19 11:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
So basically bottom nodes of each region will be open to be elected

[14-Mar-19 11:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
But as regions don t have the same number of nodes, it may vary.

divide the number of nodes in each region by 2
that is the number of automatic spots
why such controversy over >>= 1?
jeezy03/06/2019
ok so SH has  7.5  automatic spots
jl777c03/06/2019
in a case of any ambiguity, kolo is election master
no fractions in >>=

[14-Mar-19 03:56 PM] Ludom#5832
After last election, each region was full : 16 per region

Why should people involved in socail and community be paid by mining?

[14-Mar-19 04:21 PM] Ludom#5832
Bounties could be a better solution

[14-Mar-19 04:21 PM] kolo#1111
4 dev nodes, 30 re elected, 30 new, divided by 4 regions

[14-Mar-19 04:22 PM] kolo#1111
7.5 per region, I will see how fairly round that number

[14-Mar-19 04:23 PM] kolo#1111
Maybe 32 re elected, 28 to be elected, than it can be fairly divided by 4

@Ludom 
Well, exposure to the project is a much needed and overlooked aspect. 
"Community and BizDev" is highly needed, despite many peoples claims/feelings to the contrary.
For example, 
I believe @TwilightPunkster K64 , while roped in by Myese ( through community development), was eventually sold on KMD by me.  He and I spent countless hours on the phone last week and ultimately I sent him 1,000 of my personal KMD stack to him as a sign of good faith from the community that we will support him any way we can.   He is an amazing human with an amazing attitude and work ethic. 

He flat out wanted to turn down the 7,777 bounty for an SDK at first.   Flat out.  
To say he hasn't been amazing for the community in his first week is not something anyone would agree with. 
If he disagrees with me, he won't hesitate to say it, I am sure.  There are many others here due to my direct involvement with community growth, mostly KMD. 
https://twitter.com/2ndOldest/status/1104762636292448256

So yes, community building and development has intangibles that are extremely valuable to the ecosystem.
That said, I'm only 1/2 of the team.  @mrlynch is the dev side.  He is working on many things developmentally related to z address functions as well as ecosystem building in addition to my work on Bizdev for adoption.  Please see his proposal for more information.  
In addition to this, 80% of the rewards are supporting the ecosystem including Pirate, LABS, Verus and the community users. 
Only 20% of the mining rewards are going to the operators, 100% of which I am committing to Mr. Lynch.
So no, mining rewards are not directly going to "Support social and community growth".
I hope that bounties as a solution to social and community involvement aren't really thought of as the best way to engage community and integration outlets.

I stay up until 2 AM more than 3 nights a week and wake up at 6-7 AM every day to start work on Pirate and pushing the KMD narrative.   I am sorry if my post seems standoffish.   I work VERY hard spending hours each day on this project, and have been ramping this up for the past 14 Months. to where it's a 2nd fulltime job since October.  
I hope you appreciate the work that people like myself do as much as I know people like me appreciate the work you guys do.  Without you there is no us.  We know this.

[14-Mar-19 05:15 PM] Alright#0419
@FishyGuts your contributions may be "intangible"(i personally don't think so), but I believe the relevant people understand your impact on the ecosystem

[14-Mar-19 05:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I was up until 4 AM last night and the night before preparing for a z commerce launch that will enable us to cover 75% of ecommerce stores with z address transactions.  That's huge and that's going to take a lot of business and community development to achieve adoption.  
Achieving a node or two for Pirate will allow more funds for freelance developers such as @radix42 who is working on a KMD full node port for me to the Nodl and for Satinder to the RISC-V.  To pay @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ for enabling new functionality to old wallet.  To support @webworker01 for his work on all things Pirate related.  To @Deleted User for his work on Tortuga... and so on. 
I am going to enjoy the ride together with all of you no matter what.  That is the truth and I wish the best chances to win for all.  I wish there were infinite nodes to offer to those who work on KMD.

It‚Äôs too early to mention pubkeys needed. Win elections first

[14-Mar-19 09:25 PM] Ludom#5832
@FishyGuts I agree, I don't think that Community and BizDev is a bad thing. But We need notaries with focus on the nodes first because the quality of notarization is a big part of the value of our platform.

[14-Mar-19 09:31 PM] Ludom#5832
But when the 64 notary nodes make a good work, I really hope that the difference in election will be the BizDev projects

[14-Mar-19 09:31 PM] Ludom#5832
But last year, lot of notary nodes didn't made their work seriously

[14-Mar-19 09:36 PM] Ludom#5832

I have some kmd on a coinomi wallet but I think it won t work with coinomi. I recently added KMD to my pool and found some blocks. Should I put everything on the kmd node ? How to get the VOTE ? Using private keys of kmd ?

[14-Mar-19 10:01 PM] Alright#0419
Yes, there will be a time announced at which KMD will be snapshotted. Shortly after this, VOTE2019 will launch, and balances from KMD will be airdropped to it. Notaries will have an address tied to them. When the voting deadline comes, whichever candidates have the highest balance of VOTE2019 will receive a notary position.

[14-Mar-19 10:01 PM] Alright#0419
The private key for the VOTE will be the private key for the KMD

[14-Mar-19 10:02 PM] Alright#0419
ie, import KMD WIF to VOTE2019 daemon

[14-Mar-19 10:02 PM] phm87#7395
It makes sense. Thank you for the explanation

[14-Mar-19 10:05 PM] kolo#1111
Airdropped 14th april

[14-Mar-19 10:06 PM] kolo#1111
You should have privkey from your KMDs by that time if you want to get vote equivalent

[14-Mar-19 10:07 PM] Alright#0419
easiest solution by far would be Agama lite mode I believe

[14-Mar-19 10:07 PM] Alright#0419
will "just work"

[14-Mar-19 10:07 PM] kolo#1111
Since snapshot is not that fast itself - better to be 13th april at last

[14-Mar-19 10:08 PM] Alright#0419
@kolo what method are you using for the snapshot? `getsnapshot` is relatively fast

[14-Mar-19 10:09 PM] kolo#1111

@Ludom - Thank you for your response.  I agree with you and have personal experience with Ghosting node operators.  
To put it Simply, Mr. Lynch is in fact considering taking his job to part time to focus on Node operation, and development for pirate, it's projects and so on.  He reached out about the Python wrapper but it appears @Deleted User is already working on it.   
I assure you, the "bizdev" (hate that phrase by the way :P) is only 1/2 of our users.  
I do also intend to become familiar with all of the requirements to run and maintain a node so that we have people on both sides of the planet able to service nodes üòÉ 

I had a feeling @mrlynch - Thanks for being on top of it.

maybe the 1KMD = 1VOTE model is flawed? l'd say most of the worst NN operators from last election were thanks to plutocracy. I'm not saying my pitch was the best (it wasn't), but the youtuber should have at least got a node (he didn't).

also NN operators should be limited to 1 NN in  max 1 region. NNs for multiple regions is bad for redundancy and decentralization.

[15-Mar-19 09:59 AM] jorian#4555
would the youtuber have stayed if he'd won?

[15-Mar-19 10:00 AM] jorian#4555
him leaving after not winning tells enough

[15-Mar-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
@Lumbi, competition will eventually achieve this

[15-Mar-19 10:02 AM] Lumbi#8378
@jorian I hope he runs again. He will definitely promote KMD more if he wins.

[15-Mar-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
for now, we dont have 64 NN operators so what you hope for is just a dream

[15-Mar-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
in reality we need to operate with annual improvements in NN operators

[15-Mar-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
and anything other than 1KMD = 1VOTE will make it so the one with the most bots wins

[15-Mar-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you have a problem with the people with the most KMD electing the NN, changing it so the one with the most bots wins is a MUCH MUCH WORSE solution

[15-Mar-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
any sort of cap on amount of votes is DOA

[15-Mar-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
technical people will just split funds into addresses with the max allowed amount and non-technical ones will be outvoted N to 1, so that is much much worse

[15-Mar-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
also, any sort of fantasy about 1 person 1 vote, assumes that this is what is actually desired. do we really want all people to have the same amount of influence on the outcome?

[15-Mar-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
since this is politics, there wont be any agreement on even what is desired

[15-Mar-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
and whatever is desired, likely wont be able to be implemented, even if it can be agreed upon

[15-Mar-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
feel free to propose potential improvements,but unless if weighs the voting based on some sort of metric that helps get better results, the weight will be based on KMD

[15-Mar-19 10:19 AM] Ludom#5832
