[29-Mar-19 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
@zatJUM check the params you started each chain with

[29-Mar-19 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
look at ~/komodo/src/assetchains.old file

[29-Mar-19 09:29 PM] Alright#0419
@deleted-role please do `pkill -15 iguana` and `./m_notary_testnet` lowered sigs to 5

Updated too.

[29-Mar-19 09:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
is bitcoin core 0.18 working ok on debian 9 or should i just build 0.16.3 ?

[29-Mar-19 09:46 PM] hyperDEX#6586
0..18 on ubuntu cannot dpow, dont know if it is the same on debian

[29-Mar-19 09:46 PM] SHossain#0007
only use bitcoin 0.16.3

[29-Mar-19 09:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
install through ppa or build from source?

[29-Mar-19 09:46 PM] SHossain#0007
build from source

[29-Mar-19 09:47 PM] mrlynch#5735

Can someone please send 1 KMD to RXjR6LfdqjZxFtF8ifGVABzFLjasjQD2aY

[29-Mar-19 09:49 PM] zatJUM#9924
I'll send back when I have access to my wallet...

@mrlynch for testnet you dont' need BTC

[29-Mar-19 09:52 PM] SHossain#0007
only KMD, BEER & PIZZA for now

[29-Mar-19 09:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
ok

[29-Mar-19 09:52 PM] Strob#3417
So we notarize pizza and beer on kmd and that's all right?

[29-Mar-19 09:53 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

{Reactions}
👍 

[29-Mar-19 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
we can do BTC if you guys want. Not sure how many have proper servers already though

[29-Mar-19 09:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so don't bother building it then?`
even I have to ask, how do you not have bCore client already? :troll:

{Reactions}
😂 

[29-Mar-19 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
and obviously it costs BTC

[29-Mar-19 09:53 PM] PHBA2061#2530
there are 0.16.3 binaries files if you want https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.16.3/

[29-Mar-19 09:53 PM] SHossain#0007
having BTC ready for future is good idea but not needed now

[29-Mar-19 09:54 PM] Strob#3417
I have it ready

[29-Mar-19 09:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's already building so i'm gonna leave it...

[29-Mar-19 09:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@PHBA2061 it's to 0.17.1 😛

{Reactions}
😂 

[29-Mar-19 09:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i don't have bcore client because i'm not a maximalist anymore 😛

[29-Mar-19 09:54 PM] SHossain#0007
best is to compile all daemon locally rather than using pre-compiled binary

[29-Mar-19 09:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't have the chain, but I have the clients 😛

[29-Mar-19 09:55 PM] SHossain#0007
NN is all about security and pre-compiled bins are not recommended to use on NN

{Reactions}
👍 (3) 👌 

[29-Mar-19 09:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw, my "pre-compiled" are built on one PC and copied around

[29-Mar-19 09:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
every qt I have says "This is a pre-release test build - use at your own risk - do not use for mining or merchant applications" 😛

[29-Mar-19 10:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because I can't be assed to edit the make files

[29-Mar-19 10:14 PM] mrlynch#5735

[29-Mar-19 10:14 PM] mrlynch#5735

[29-Mar-19 10:16 PM] SHossain#0007

[29-Mar-19 10:16 PM] SHossain#0007

[29-Mar-19 10:20 PM] Alright#0419
was trying to keep it to max of 1 update per day, but if you think there are enough people around, go for it

[29-Mar-19 10:22 PM] mrlynch#5735

[29-Mar-19 10:22 PM] mrlynch#5735

minsig is still 5. as long as enough notary updates, we should have notarizations

honestly i added my pubkey here to feel the wind and the mood of new potential notarizers
they are pretty good candidates (newcomers and old commmunity members)
totally honestly it was after a conversation with @phm87 , i was thinking to help him by being running on the same NN network
*feeling a bit useless as he is already notarizing and i am still syncing*

[30-Mar-19 02:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[30-Mar-19 02:23 AM] metaphilibert#0926
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i am quite sure you don't need any help to write your proposal ;)
but you can count on me to underline your consistent determination to defend what you feel right, based on objective arguments

[30-Mar-19 02:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

well, the Readme 2019NNtestnet repo of Alright was clear enough but thank you for your help and support. When I had a look on the available KMD repos, I had the feeling that KMD may be smaller than what I imagined

[30-Mar-19 02:29 AM] metaphilibert#0926
not sure to have understood but
now is it bigger than you imaginated?

[30-Mar-19 02:30 AM] metaphilibert#0926
if not, please learn more :troll:

[30-Mar-19 02:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[30-Mar-19 02:34 AM] phm87#7395
I'm still learning a lot, thank you to everyone. I mean that it is not as big and as "corporate" as ethereum, maybe it is not too late to join

[30-Mar-19 02:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the lack of that is why I love it
If you have a good idea it becomes a thing, no matter who you are

Hi guys, I'm making an address for my proposal and had a couple of questions.
First one is, is the address on my proposal only for receiving VOTE?  Or is it the address I'll use for my mainnet NN ( 🤞 )?  Both?

[30-Mar-19 03:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I used one just for vote 🤷🏽
