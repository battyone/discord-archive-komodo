@Alright What is the best/proper way to get back to the correct repo? (I'd just reclone, but don't think that's the correct way.)

[02-May-19 12:31 AM] Alright#0419

the link I posted does not change the repo, just updates your repo

We're depending on you :abusedsmily:

[02-May-19 01:18 AM] popcornbag#4039
i wouldnt fork the repo to your own github , and use directly what we are using , has that is more straight and avoides additional steps  to be updated to the original

[02-May-19 01:20 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
is there a good go-to github guide aside from the basic readme ?

[02-May-19 01:20 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
i've read good bash guides before.. well structured / thought out presentations of the programs capabilities and practical use cases..

[02-May-19 01:20 AM] CrisF#3405
The read me will show you how to add the passphrase and pubkey info mrlynch mentioned.

[02-May-19 01:42 AM] popcornbag#4039
@mrlynch i would try first on testnet with centos , before going to mainnet with a diferent distro

[02-May-19 01:42 AM] popcornbag#4039
just my opinion

[02-May-19 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Should work, just the deps will be named differently and will take a while. Someone already compiled komodo on centos. Deb9.6 is great, cantbsay I've updated my os on a team like the entire year, maybe once or twice.

[02-May-19 01:45 AM] popcornbag#4039
deps will be diferent yes

[02-May-19 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@hypocalese I think maybe it was compiled on centos. That's a start. Iguana required very little in the way of deps I'm pretty sure and should be easy to get working. Provided nanomsg works on centos.

[02-May-19 01:53 AM] popcornbag#4039
what i wanted to say is , don't go to mainnet with a different distro before knowing exactly how to setup properly

[02-May-19 03:35 AM] Mylo#8306
ubuntu is the testing stuff of debian, slightly newer.  like the jl777 repo vs komodo repo

[02-May-19 03:37 AM] Mylo#8306
BEER on one of the testnet nodes hasn't notarized for 1000 minutes nearly.
same physical host, but VPS on it next door, seems to keep going.
v.unusual.  no time to properly investigate - except, where is the recv_mask script for checking recv mask?

[02-May-19 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
` curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}" | jq  -c -r .[]`

[02-May-19 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wouldnt worry about BEER that much man, everyone seems having problems. I can say one thing though. I found a pretty crazy bug, that I dont think we have patched yet on KMD, unles jl did it. 
https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/commit/2a5a86b1ce118e06d742d14c1540237a6d2e0257
This commit fixes many issues with wallets. I found out by accident trying to do something the lazy way, that if a transaction expires before it is mined, the wallet cannot see that, and so thinks unspent coins are spent. This is the "listunspent bug" It can cause all kinds of crazy shit. With this change thigns will be much more stable.

I have a feeling that many many "bugs" with many things we have been trying to fix since sapling all stemmed from this stupid define... 20 blocks really? That is so dangerous.. I wonder who set it to that in the first place?

[02-May-19 03:52 AM] Mylo#8306
what does "transaction expire" mean in this context?

[02-May-19 03:52 AM] Mylo#8306

not tomorrow but the next day

[02-May-19 03:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sapling added an on chan param called `nExpiryHeight` it means, that the tx is simply deleted from mempool after this amount of blocks happens.

[02-May-19 03:54 AM] Mylo#8306
ok cool works for me cheers mate

thx for curl command, i haven't seen that for months 😬

[02-May-19 03:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was only set to 20, dunno who in their right mind set it to that, but it was causing lots of undefined behaviours.

[02-May-19 03:54 AM] Mylo#8306
shyzer....20 blocks!

It will be fixed before the hard fork though. Working very hard on our end to get everything stable 😰

sounds like a reasonable thing to look over if you don't use tx the way iguana does

It will be the stupidest game, because everyone will be sending thir funds in the same block and cant know where others are sending theirs to 😄
