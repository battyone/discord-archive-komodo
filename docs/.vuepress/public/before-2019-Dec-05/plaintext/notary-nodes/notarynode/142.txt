@zatJUM   it's -whitelistaddress I think

[16-Apr-19 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CHMEX he's asking why he's getting an error with it

[16-Apr-19 04:42 PM] phm87#7395
in the branch jl777 of jl777 repo of KMD, there is a help message:
```src/init.cpp:    strUsage += HelpMessageOpt("-whitelistaddress=<Raddress>", _("Add one Raddress in the wallet filter for notary nodes. If -whitelistaddress= is used, then the wallet filter is automatically activated. Several Raddresses can be defined using several -whitelistaddress= (similar to -addnode). The wallet filter will filter the utxo to only ones coming from my own Raddress (derived from pubkey) and each Raddress defined using -whitelistaddress="));```

[16-Apr-19 04:42 PM] CHMEX#0686
ow I see sorry

[16-Apr-19 04:42 PM] zatJUM#9924
Oh 🙆

[16-Apr-19 04:42 PM] phm87#7395
I think that the walletfilter is only into the jl777 branch of jl777 repo

[16-Apr-19 04:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
he's getting an error because it's not the correct param

[16-Apr-19 04:42 PM] phm87#7395
yes

[16-Apr-19 04:43 PM] zatJUM#9924
Thanks @CHMEX

[16-Apr-19 04:43 PM] phm87#7395
but I don't know if the code that he is using contains the -whitelistaddress= code filter

[16-Apr-19 04:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
you need joker's jl777 branch

_can't even remember what repo/branch he's even using for which chain_

[16-Apr-19 04:43 PM] zatJUM#9924
It's in jl777/dev if I'm not mistaken

[16-Apr-19 04:43 PM] phm87#7395
no problem, I didn't work : I copy pasted things that ppl say here into github

Could you develop @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  please?

[16-Apr-19 04:46 PM] phm87#7395
but I tested a bit the jl777 branch to test my tiny easy change for the help message

[16-Apr-19 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I use it regularly, but never when stability is required

there should be a way to pin an image of branch hierarchy in the dev channels that's always visible 😦

so as soon as new folks join they instantly see it

there really is no "good" reason *why* a plutocracy, *shouldn't work* (in theory) -- *except perhaps the rather common pretence to conflate wealth with intellect, character, virtue, merit or competence* -- the proof will be the pudding (i.e. the election results) . 😎

in this case notary task is a bit different but that guy also could pretend to run

and the testnet is also far more advanced, like being delegated to peers that just gives the rythm

trying to figure what other tweaks may be able to be applied

[16-Apr-19 09:32 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know if guys told you but once in a week, you should create new wallet.dat for KMD and each AC, import private key without rescan and move the funds. It helps to keep good perfs

[16-Apr-19 09:33 PM] phm87#7395
one tweak that can help (or not) is to increase nb of connections

[16-Apr-19 09:33 PM] phm87#7395
a limit is hardcoded into komodo code

[16-Apr-19 09:34 PM] phm87#7395
so in few days when you'll stop and start your nodes to make new wallet.dat you can change the MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS in net.cpp

[16-Apr-19 09:35 PM] phm87#7395
I increased it to 40 but some ppl left it as it is at 16

[16-Apr-19 09:35 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know really if it helps to notarize more often

[16-Apr-19 09:36 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ok cool

using `cleanwallettransactions` is plenty good enough, there's no need to add stops and starts
