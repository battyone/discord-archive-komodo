[27-Mar-19 02:06 PM] Alright#0419
@CHMEX do you know how that site last year tracked these?

[27-Mar-19 02:06 PM] Alright#0419
was thinking maybe we should change RXL address for easy tracking?

[27-Mar-19 02:07 PM] Alright#0419
couldn't really think of a simple way to do it otherwise

[27-Mar-19 02:08 PM] CHMEX#0686
I parsed each VIN going to the BEER RXL address

[27-Mar-19 02:09 PM] CHMEX#0686

[27-Mar-19 02:09 PM] Lumbi#8378

[27-Mar-19 02:10 PM] Lumbi#8378
lemme see if I can find some lyin' around here somewhere üòÑ

[27-Mar-19 02:10 PM] CHMEX#0686

[27-Mar-19 02:15 PM] jorian#4555

[27-Mar-19 02:15 PM] jorian#4555

[27-Mar-19 02:15 PM] jorian#4555

[27-Mar-19 02:16 PM] Lumbi#8378
ppl don't tip like they used to

[27-Mar-19 02:17 PM] Lumbi#8378
I'm funded üòâ

[27-Mar-19 02:17 PM] CrisF#3405
Faucet  worked here too @Alright

[27-Mar-19 02:18 PM] CrisF#3405
Slow connection here didn't show the craptcha for a while though.

[27-Mar-19 02:18 PM] Alright#0419
does anyone know if paxmatches includes myself?

[27-Mar-19 02:19 PM] Alright#0419
just waiting for a notarization here to see that it's working then need to focus on some other things

[27-Mar-19 02:19 PM] Alright#0419
paxmatches.3

[27-Mar-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
includes all notaries, including your node

[27-Mar-19 02:19 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, CHMEX üôè  I got 3 of one and .777 of another.  Not sure how long that'll last.

[27-Mar-19 02:21 PM] Alright#0419
@CrisF probably enough for the entire duration of the testnet

[27-Mar-19 02:22 PM] Alright#0419
ok will check back in a bit, if someone noticed a minsig 4 notarization happen, please lmk

[27-Mar-19 02:25 PM] Strob#3417
I get error signing nnpacket

[27-Mar-19 02:25 PM] jorian#4555
any errors while updating?

[27-Mar-19 02:26 PM] Strob#3417
oups sorry I think I know what it is

[27-Mar-19 02:32 PM] Strob#3417
I had made changes to my m_notary_testnet file so the update could overwrite it so I deleted the entire 2019NNtest folder but just forgot to put back my pubkey and passphrase files

[27-Mar-19 02:32 PM] Strob#3417
Now it works!

[27-Mar-19 02:32 PM] jorian#4555
use git stash in the future

[27-Mar-19 02:32 PM] Alright#0419
`git stash` in the future

[27-Mar-19 02:32 PM] Alright#0419
heh

[27-Mar-19 02:32 PM] jorian#4555
lol

[27-Mar-19 02:32 PM] Strob#3417
ok thanks!

[27-Mar-19 02:39 PM] zatJUM#9924

[27-Mar-19 02:42 PM] Alright#0419
@zatJUM need to edit m_notary_testnet file as well

[27-Mar-19 02:42 PM] Alright#0419
add your IP

[27-Mar-19 02:44 PM] zatJUM#9924
it's a script! (`curl -s4 checkip.amazonaws.com`)

[27-Mar-19 02:44 PM] zatJUM#9924
Should I put my IP elsewhere?

[27-Mar-19 02:45 PM] Alright#0419
look at git history of the file

[27-Mar-19 02:47 PM] Strob#3417

[27-Mar-19 02:47 PM] zatJUM#9924
like this one?

[27-Mar-19 02:49 PM] CHMEX#0686
Shall we maybe move this to a testnet channel or so?

[27-Mar-19 02:50 PM] Alright#0419
@zatJUM yes

[27-Mar-19 02:50 PM] Alright#0419
without that our nodes wouldn't add you as a peer

[27-Mar-19 02:50 PM] Alright#0419
might work without it, but you should do it

[27-Mar-19 02:51 PM] zatJUM#9924
Done

[27-Mar-19 02:52 PM] zatJUM#9924
pizza and beer no sync'ing

[27-Mar-19 02:53 PM] Alright#0419
@zatJUM I'll merge it in tomorrow's batch

[27-Mar-19 02:53 PM] Alright#0419
promised 1 update/day

[27-Mar-19 02:53 PM] Alright#0419
each time we add keys, everyone needs to restart

[27-Mar-19 02:53 PM] zatJUM#9924
yes I saw that

[27-Mar-19 02:53 PM] zatJUM#9924
no pb

[27-Mar-19 02:54 PM] zatJUM#9924
an idea for the sync?

[27-Mar-19 02:55 PM] NNoperator#3835
look for clues in debug.log   (it is in your .komodo/BEER directory)

[27-Mar-19 02:57 PM] CrisF#3405
Am I looking for a `ISMINE`?

[27-Mar-19 03:10 PM] CrisF#3405
Ah, just `MINE`

[27-Mar-19 03:11 PM] CrisF#3405
Well, it's working üòÉ

[27-Mar-19 03:17 PM] CHMEX#0686
it's notarizing again

[27-Mar-19 03:22 PM] CrisF#3405
```bestk.0 95 KMD height.63838 mod.2 VINI.3 myind.7 MINE.({"txid":"b7f9732df8733a83b9b0c2ce49030a33c9c5e3ddfa2225eeed8f221014620092","vout":113,"scriptSig":```

Do mine now

[27-Mar-19 04:20 PM] PHBA2061#2530
done mine as well

[27-Mar-19 04:58 PM] NNoperator#3835
Looking over the list of operators for new faces (or names at least)  only see four so far and PTYX returning makes five.  I hope we will get more soon!   One strong suggestion, please don't locate your server in a highly occupied location.  https://komodostats.com/map.php   Montreal OVH is already way too full !

Hi everyone,
`new faces` reminds me I should introduce myself.
CrisF here. 
Happy to see many people here who have helped me out over the last year üòÉ 
After following this channel for a few months after last election, and a bit of a push, I'll be running for NN this year.
I usually hang out in #kmdlabs and a few others channels.
Still quite new at this so happy to get the test node working.
Looking forward seeing you around.

[27-Mar-19 05:31 PM] PHBA2061#2530
why are there 7 nodes in the middle of Atlantic Ocean ? ü§î

[27-Mar-19 05:45 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi webworker01 üëã  Just setting up your stats script : )

[27-Mar-19 06:29 PM] jorian#4555

@taurados fork the repo, make changes, commit and push to your repo then launch a pull request

[27-Mar-19 09:56 PM] kolo#1111
I merged all pull requests I've seen. Except only two until now, where I told authors what was wrong.

[27-Mar-19 09:56 PM] kolo#1111
Have not seen any new PR's from @taurados or @Ludom

[27-Mar-19 09:58 PM] kolo#1111
Only 4 dev nodes this year go off the record. Im very sad we cant provide nodes to all devs constantly working on KMD health. Be it in my powers I'd better give from half to all to actual dev's.

[27-Mar-19 10:22 PM] taurados#4043
Will try again tomorrow

[27-Mar-19 11:45 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks @webworker01 !

@kolo  Should I post new Address for Election 2019 until 1st April on github?

[28-Mar-19 01:44 AM] kolo#1111
@goldenman you can keep old one if you had and sure it‚Äôs safe

[28-Mar-19 01:45 AM] kolo#1111
Address will be tied to actual node pubkey, but next year

[28-Mar-19 01:47 AM] kolo#1111
Whoever asked about 4 dev nodes: those are James, me, Decker and ca333. It will be just not fair to take away spots for devs. And we try to keep everything as fair as possible.

[28-Mar-19 01:49 AM] kolo#1111
Nodes in stats were renamed into ‚Äúdev‚Äù just for easy reading (they had some more freedom in regions and configs). We always had just 4 for that

[28-Mar-19 01:55 AM] Alright#0419
@kolo so if I put "dev" in the tag, I can put the node anywhere? :troll:

[28-Mar-19 02:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
keys for new season not generated here, will wait for further instructions and just generate what s needed in time when we ll have details. I use the same address for vote than last year (sentimentally my first testnet address)

[28-Mar-19 02:23 AM] Strob#3417
@webworker01 Hi Webworker01! thanks for your tools! What's the number next to each coin in your coinlist file? And what should it be for BEER and PIZZA?

[28-Mar-19 02:31 AM] Strob#3417
Ok cool but I meant in the coinlist file. I see 'AXO 200000000' 'BET 000000' etc

[28-Mar-19 02:32 AM] Strob#3417
Geat tx! so generous!
