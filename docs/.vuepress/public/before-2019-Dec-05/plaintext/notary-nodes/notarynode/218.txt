_ doesn't know how @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  knows how many discord DM exists between how many persons ... maybe he is part of CIA or discord or a secret KMD feature ... :troll_cool:_

[26-Jul-19 12:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure I need to join the CIA to learn to count the little red circles on the left side of my screen 🤷🏽

[26-Jul-19 12:32 AM] phm87#7395

Thank you @Greer it is helpful

Sorry @Deleted User I just woke up, was very tired!
As infotech-al, I've just read the convo and prefer to stay out of it.
My english and my technical knoledge aren't good enough to participate to convos like this one, sorry.
From what I've understood, Dwy could have found a weakness in the system, and blackjok3r has already PR'ed something, so that's great!
Dwy and Webworker helped me both in private and are both very useful for KMD ecosystem / Don't wan't to choose.

Positive outcomes are one fix from joker, interesting geolocation discussion and ppl interested in a new nn testnet

[26-Jul-19 10:38 AM] mrlynch#5735
i say again.. a testnet that doesn't reflect the mainnet is not a testnet

[26-Jul-19 10:39 AM] mrlynch#5735
all this talk of having btc testnet with some new random smartchains is useless.. it will be different

look at verus, we didn t even have 13 nodes to notarize it, and chips

[26-Jul-19 10:40 AM] mrlynch#5735
verus didn't hf to ses3 keys yet

[26-Jul-19 10:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
yup

[26-Jul-19 11:09 AM] phm87#7395
I agree with mrlynch: it was discussed yesterday with CG in the priv channel. I still think that a testnet is better than nothing

[26-Jul-19 12:53 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I agree a limited testnet is a better place to test thoeries with potentially unintended consequences to the network and op harmony than the mainnet. Ideally simulations mimic real world conditions as much as possible and within budget, else as close as possible within available resources.

[26-Jul-19 01:05 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Phm wants to break stuff, let him build them 🙂

[26-Jul-19 01:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
👆 if you really want to build a "testnet" to break things you can do it yourself, no need for any other ops.. spin up 13 vps and fire away

[26-Jul-19 01:29 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Lol
Maybe decrease the nb of signers also
Anyway it is always funnier with friends so I'll setup a node, I don't want you feel alone @phm87

[26-Jul-19 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
vms and clones make it nice and quick like

[26-Jul-19 02:52 PM] phm87#7395
I can do it alone indeed. But I prefer to share with ppl and be part of a Team. Other NN are interested in a small testnet with few signers

[26-Jul-19 02:52 PM] phm87#7395
For my pool we have 2 local pools on our PC's but only one reproduce whole infra. It costs

[26-Jul-19 02:53 PM] phm87#7395
Split the testnet cost between nn testnet ops is better for testnet stability

[26-Jul-19 02:54 PM] phm87#7395

thank you to everyone how participated in the discussion.

[27-Jul-19 02:29 AM] Mylo#8306
it looks like a timing thing to fix, and whether this can be improved at the protocol level, not the code level.
round YYY started at XXXXXXXX
responses for YYY will be accepted after XXXXXXXX+Z  time

ps i know little about iguana, so take my last 3 lines with a grain of salt

[27-Jul-19 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That's basically how I will be doing it yes

[27-Jul-19 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Could even make the nota only happen after the next block, that gives all nodes a reference point they agree on, could be a bit slow though.

[27-Jul-19 08:25 AM] phm87#7395
@Mylo I think that questions related to a new (test) nota network should be in the public channel. How to create one should be public.
If these infos should not be public, I can delete my msgs and go to the private channel.

[27-Jul-19 02:23 PM] Decker#3767
btw, guys ... about multiple ips. as we all saw lukechilds added a bunch of additional (floating) ips for his nodes (you can see it in latest m_notary_run file), but this step seems doesn't help him to get a better connectivity and better stats. for example, in current stats his AR node is on second place from the bottom.
