I learned the term stochastic when I used a car paint shader using stochastic noise for the flakes

lol I'm not that old (not even half), but that's a concept that will always stick with me

[17-May-19 03:34 PM] Strob#3417
@jl777c You said you succeeded at making it random, but where is the randomness exactly? I feel like it it deterministic at least in the testnet, favouring those who are closer and who never restart for example

[17-May-19 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
random due to not being able to be deterministic

[17-May-19 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
random due to depending on 64 different nodes running async to each other

[17-May-19 03:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and who never restart for example`
yes, you need to be connected in order to participate 🤷🏽

[17-May-19 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
random due to the internet

[17-May-19 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
you can sabotage your results by any sort of means to get a non-random 0 result

[17-May-19 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
but assuming you arent doing that, then for the most part, the performance will be random over a 640 block period

[17-May-19 03:36 PM] Strob#3417
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I know but it seems like if you are not participating for a few hours, then you become set apart for days

[17-May-19 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
depending on the phase your sample is in relative to your bitposition in the 640 blocks, there are definite non-random outcomes

[17-May-19 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
like 0 notarizations if there are already 13 ahead of your node in bestmask

[17-May-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
the mistake most make is to not understand that each 640 blocks is a SINGLE data sample

[17-May-19 03:37 PM] Strob#3417
```there are definite non-random outcomes```
I knew it!!! 😉

[17-May-19 03:38 PM] Strob#3417
How long is 640 blocks?

[17-May-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
is that a serious question?

[17-May-19 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but it seems like if you are not participating for a few hours, then you become set apart for days`
There are many factors that contribute to that, not the least of which is confirmation bias
fwiw, I've restarted wallets and iguana 3 times since getting back into the top 3 two weeks ago (current uptime is just over 5 days)

[17-May-19 03:40 PM] Strob#3417
I mean how much time does it takes to go through 640 blocks

[17-May-19 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
how long does 640 blocks take?

[17-May-19 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
640 block on what chain?

[17-May-19 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[17-May-19 03:41 PM] Strob#3417
I'm asking this but I only half understand what you said above, I still have so much to learn

[17-May-19 03:42 PM] Strob#3417
On kmd

[17-May-19 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
KMD averages a block per minute

[17-May-19 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the blocktime for KMD?

[17-May-19 03:42 PM] SHossain#0007
63sec

🤔 

[17-May-19 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
640x is the time for 640 blocks

[17-May-19 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
plz tell me this is not news

[17-May-19 03:43 PM] SHossain#0007

[17-May-19 03:43 PM] SHossain#0007
which is ~60 sec

[17-May-19 03:45 PM] Strob#3417
1m 2s!

[17-May-19 03:45 PM] Strob#3417
so 640 blocks takes 11 hours and 2 seconds

[17-May-19 03:47 PM] Strob#3417
so it could take all that time to get back to randomness if I get into problems

[17-May-19 03:48 PM] TonyL#3577
640*62 = 39680 seconds, not sure how you was able to get 2 seconds 
It's 11 hours 80 seconds actually

[17-May-19 03:49 PM] TonyL#3577
But since blocktime fluctuating it's approx number

[17-May-19 03:49 PM] SHossain#0007
math 😄

[17-May-19 03:49 PM] Strob#3417
sorry 11.02 hours

[17-May-19 03:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Thats how spaceships falling 😃

[17-May-19 03:50 PM] Strob#3417
11 hours 1 min 20 sec

[17-May-19 03:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, sorry it should be not 11 hours 2 seconds but 11.02 hours

[17-May-19 03:50 PM] TonyL#3577

[17-May-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it should be 60 seconds, dont believe that page about 1min 2 seconds

[17-May-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
so 640 blocks is one cycle, one data point

[17-May-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
you need many data points to get a statistically valid sample

{Reactions}
👍 

[17-May-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
half the blocks in the 640, maybe you dont get any notarizations, so it is very easy to have a small time sample and conclude you are not getting any notarizations. you change a bunch of things and start getting notarizations, then conclude what you changed must have fixed it, when it more likely was that you became eligible again in the 640 blocks cycle

[17-May-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and this happens for each coin mostly independently

[17-May-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and you need to be cross connected to all the peers in the bestmask

[17-May-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and a ping time less than a second

[17-May-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
run a test for say 2 weeks, change one variable and see the result

[17-May-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
not saying there are not things you can do to improve things, but the most effective is to be running all the time with utxo on a good hardware with good connectivity

speaking of UTXOs    I just got 10 more BTC utxo,  thank you viaBTC!  The mempool is getting me down, hopefully we can get relief this weekend...

[17-May-19 04:19 PM] SHossain#0007
viabtc is not confirming one of my tx. can't re-submit that anymore as their site says it's already in the queue.

[17-May-19 04:20 PM] NNoperator#3835
I have the same issue since yesterday,  it seems they like some transactions more than others.

[17-May-19 04:20 PM] SHossain#0007
since last night

[17-May-19 04:23 PM] NNoperator#3835
I'm going to send in personal funds to get another UTXO to split from.  It pains me to waste so much BTC on fees

[17-May-19 04:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_had a 0 fee BTC tx floating in the internet for 2 weeks and couldn't even get anyone to accept it as a valid tx_

[17-May-19 04:28 PM] NNoperator#3835
I think those days where 0 fee transactions could fly are long gone, mempool is a deep well with plenty of spam occupying the bottom.

[17-May-19 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
beyond not being put in a block, I mean that literally no one would accept it into their mempool and all of the explorer broadcasts returned that it was an invalid tx

[17-May-19 04:37 PM] NNoperator#3835
uppity miners don't let free-riders ride anymore?

[17-May-19 05:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not the miners, Core clients block them by default

[17-May-19 05:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you have to actually use arguments at runtime to even create or accept it

[17-May-19 05:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`-deprecatedrpc=signrawtransaction -minrelaytxfee=0.00000000`

[18-May-19 04:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
got `iguanaping` output reaching oracle.earth
creates oracle if not already made for NN sending
stores pingstats if oracle already created - http://oracle.earth/oracle_samples/?chain=CFEKORKL&oracletxid=a93a3b2fd311290a7f6d2ee551ca121f3d00eae761bfd0430f11b4cdca8f4843&batonutxo=abc1b1aee38b58f6e40525374050696bcf378da126c14e135b4ab8baba5979c3&num=20

[18-May-19 05:28 AM] Mylo#8306
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator does `oracleslist` rpc call return anything?

[18-May-19 05:29 AM] Mylo#8306
i'd expect an array of txids but i get a blank array.

ok thanks....i'll rebuild a bunch of branches and report whatever bugs it's in.

maybe i try and fix myself, the answer is already in the past

[18-May-19 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Labs isn't up to date possibly with latest stuff for oracles.

[18-May-19 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe something is broken.

[18-May-19 06:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Labs and kmd are very close jl777 branch, only some minor changes for labs over jl777 branch

[18-May-19 06:33 AM] Mylo#8306
how many versions of kmd do you usually have installed on a box?

[18-May-19 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
2 on test VMS, labs and my fork. I'm trying to keep them equal before hard fork.

[18-May-19 06:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In the past labs got really far from kmd and it made merging code one way or the other very hard

[18-May-19 06:38 AM] Mylo#8306
good idea with room to spare 😃

[18-May-19 06:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Test VMS are only 50gb... So where near big enough tbh.. Always clearing things, upgraded to 100mbit fibre this month tho lol, constantly syncing chains from my server is getting too slow.

[18-May-19 06:40 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah my test vms are 50GB also

[18-May-19 06:41 AM] Mylo#8306
i've got 1 host with 2TB SATA, so might use that for the multi kmd versions.
can you confirm you don't mix and match data dir, or you do but run one version at a time, or do they run at the same time with different data dir

[18-May-19 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I run both at the same time, same data dir... I have 2 VMs, so when doing things that mess up the block index, I have to seperate them, 1 version on 1 VM, the other on the other one.

[18-May-19 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Really, LABS will likely be equal with some branch of KMD, or it is atm

[18-May-19 08:37 AM] mrlynch#5735
outstanding work @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator
did u have to mod the script in the end to output json as you wanted?

[18-May-19 09:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
nah, just got the json as key and used the key to store as json

[18-May-19 09:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just need to test someone else sending `iguanaping` data to make sure it adds to the nn_oracle_list and loops through ok
