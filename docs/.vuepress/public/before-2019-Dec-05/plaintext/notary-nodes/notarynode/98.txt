to generate rewards

[07-Apr-19 01:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My partner handles this address to pay everyone

[07-Apr-19 01:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If I get my own node, I will just z_mergetoaddress every mined block

[07-Apr-19 01:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on blocknotify

[07-Apr-19 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
last_mined ? I think in getinfo should tell you when you mine a block

[07-Apr-19 01:08 PM] Strob#3417
What rewards are you talking about?

[07-Apr-19 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
KMD

[07-Apr-19 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for KMD a UTXO has to be greater than 10 to earn rewrds

[07-Apr-19 01:09 PM] Strob#3417
ok you mean when are mining KMD

[07-Apr-19 01:11 PM] Strob#3417
Seems like restart helped a bit yesterday I'm back in the top 10 for the last 6 hours.

[07-Apr-19 01:31 PM] Alright#0419
@Strob still trying to wrap my head around that

[07-Apr-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r that code was done in a way to be confusing as it was when the attacker was monitoring the code for changes and attacking any exposure, i didnt want to make it easy to find what was being patched. I think I suceeded, that code confuses me now

@jl777c  I read what you said about bribes and was happy cause I think exactly the same but what do you think about my proposal?
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/notarynodes/strob
No bribes! I'm offering my services with huge rebates, is it something welcomed? Or should add something else? I realize here that it can be a lot of work and stress at times to be a NNop but I'm very happy with all I have learned so far.

I seem to have this reoccurring trend where it I consistently hit 1 chain by a large percentage and get 0 on the other 2 for hours and hours

dwy has changed his ip into 54.36.51.177 I think, but didn't see the change in m_notary_testnet file

[07-Apr-19 02:49 PM] SHossain#0007
did i give tag to wrong id?

[07-Apr-19 02:50 PM] SHossain#0007
and1_89 has the tag now and removed from `and1"ヅblubbi#5646`

[07-Apr-19 03:02 PM] gt#2812
do we need to kill iguana

[07-Apr-19 03:03 PM] SHossain#0007
`./m_notary_testnet` will do that

[07-Apr-19 03:03 PM] SHossain#0007
but, if you want, you can kill iguana manually. no harm

[07-Apr-19 03:04 PM] gt#2812
ah yeah i know that’s part of the that command i guess i meant as part of the protocol

[07-Apr-19 03:05 PM] SHossain#0007
with every update of iguana, you must stop it and start it.

[07-Apr-19 03:05 PM] SHossain#0007
generally the start script does stop it first, compile and run latest.

[07-Apr-19 03:06 PM] SHossain#0007
on mainnet, it is just `./m_notary`

yes sorry i meant does iguana need to be restarted to recognize a new pubkey

[07-Apr-19 03:09 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[07-Apr-19 03:09 PM] gt#2812
i understand the line in m_notary_testnet

[07-Apr-19 03:10 PM] SHossain#0007
the iguana daemon can't detect any changes in other source file until it starts again. think of iguana like komodo or other coin daemon, if you change the coin.conf file, you need to restart the daemon to start using that.

thanks that makes perfect sense

[07-Apr-19 03:29 PM] Greer#0666
My problem with TXSCLCC is that I mined the balance and didn't shield the funds.  Is it the same procedure as with zcash? so,  simply: ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC z_shieldcoinbase "*" <z address>``` nothing more than that?

[07-Apr-19 03:30 PM] SHossain#0007
nope. looks good

[07-Apr-19 03:30 PM] Greer#0666
👍 thanks and you're quick with the reply!

[07-Apr-19 03:30 PM] SHossain#0007
make sure the z_address is not in the same server/computer

[07-Apr-19 03:31 PM] SHossain#0007
you can use same computer, no issues with that

[07-Apr-19 03:31 PM] SHossain#0007
the point is to keep your wallet.dat slim

[07-Apr-19 03:31 PM] Greer#0666
ah, so will have to send it back again after

[07-Apr-19 03:32 PM] SHossain#0007
don't use NN server to receive or send funds. only mined funds you should send out.

[07-Apr-19 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
why use shield?

[07-Apr-19 03:33 PM] SHossain#0007
so, it doesn't mess up your split utxos

[07-Apr-19 03:34 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
and you can shield to another wallet that isn't on your NN server

[07-Apr-19 03:34 PM] SHossain#0007
you can use `sendtoaddress` which may/may not use up your utxos that iguana needs. using Decker's script or your script or by other means you should only send out mined funds

[07-Apr-19 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_mines on a separate node and never has to face such issues_

[07-Apr-19 03:35 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
NN mining?

[07-Apr-19 03:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
talking about mining TXSCLCC

[07-Apr-19 03:36 PM] SHossain#0007
if you use different node to mine any chain, you have nothing to worry 😛

[07-Apr-19 03:36 PM] SHossain#0007
my suggestions are only for NN

[07-Apr-19 03:36 PM] SHossain#0007
and any coin you are mining on NN

[07-Apr-19 03:36 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
we aren't mining aren't on the testnet though with our NN

[07-Apr-19 03:37 PM] SHossain#0007
testnet doesn't have any special provision for mining.

[07-Apr-19 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
some ppl are :p

[07-Apr-19 03:38 PM] SHossain#0007
mining on/for testnet not necessary.

[07-Apr-19 03:38 PM] SHossain#0007
i've dedicated node mining TXSCLCC to keep the blocks flowing. CG is doing the same

[07-Apr-19 03:38 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm more referring to NN on the mainnet mine KMD, so they have to deal with mining UTXO's

[07-Apr-19 03:38 PM] SHossain#0007
i also have BEER & PIZZA tx generator running every 2 minutes

@NutellaLicka for mainnet KMD mined blocks, use this script to send out only mined KMD and this doesn't touch the utxos for iguana https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo_scripts/blob/master/sendawaynn_auto.sh

how do you check connections to other NNs ?

[07-Apr-19 03:50 PM] SHossain#0007
this is a great tool by Decker to generate address and WIF for 3rd party coins from your NN passphrase. also useful for KMD to use first time and will be reflected in the latest Notary Setup guide (WIP) https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/How-to-Generate-Address-and-Private-Key-(WIF)-for-3rd-Party-Coins-Using-Passphrase

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢   I have noticed that the mask connections  drops to a smaller group just before notarizations.  Maybe that is why you observe this trend?

OK if you are observing a persistent trend of lower connections then it may be the network isn't healthy.

[07-Apr-19 04:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that or my intervals are too far apart and I'm just oddly not seeing any upswings 🤷🏽
