plenty of room 😃

[06-Mar-19 10:36 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Anyway, how it all seems to be, VOTE CHAINMAKERS_NA, we need your vote to continue with our onboarding of projects!

[06-Mar-19 10:36 AM] Ludom#5832
Because there is more or less notarynodes on the stats if you take the dev nodes in the count

[06-Mar-19 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there are also nodes who do not notarize 😄

[06-Mar-19 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
do we not count them too :troll:

[06-Mar-19 10:37 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeaj. what about the nodes that are in 0 notas?

[06-Mar-19 10:38 AM] Ludom#5832
vote for badass_EU

[06-Mar-19 10:38 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The fascist in me would ban them from running for re-election

[06-Mar-19 10:38 AM] jorian#4555
badass_ has been consistently int he #notary-node-alarms channel

[06-Mar-19 10:38 AM] Ludom#5832

Automatic reelection ? Who cares ? 😉

[06-Mar-19 10:39 AM] jeezy#3408
at least he got his rigs mining nonstop

[06-Mar-19 10:39 AM] jeezy#3408
thats something

[06-Mar-19 10:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
I believe he implemented cryptoconditions so pretty good contribution

[06-Mar-19 10:39 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What about robes?

[06-Mar-19 10:40 AM] jorian#4555
what if i told you..

[06-Mar-19 10:40 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
People speculate he dissapeared

[06-Mar-19 10:40 AM] jorian#4555
@xRobeSx you there?

[06-Mar-19 10:42 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Seems like he disapeared from real life too

[06-Mar-19 10:45 AM] jorian#4555
just checked his slack, last time he said something was october 20th 2018

[06-Mar-19 10:50 AM] CrisF#3405
Aren't there 2 (3?) extra spots this year? Or will they become dev nodes?

[06-Mar-19 10:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
thanks @kolo for the ann. thanks to all for all the useful info

[06-Mar-19 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there are a bunch of nodes that left/didnt really join in at all... Those I expect will be filled with new willing participants this year.

[06-Mar-19 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
finally it will be an actual competition for top spot ... lol

[06-Mar-19 10:51 AM] mrlynch#5735
👆 hoping to be 1 fur the pirate crew 😁

[06-Mar-19 10:51 AM] Ludom#5832
dev nodes are cheating 🤡

[06-Mar-19 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That depends which nodes they are... I brought this up a heap of times lol

[06-Mar-19 10:52 AM] mrlynch#5735
i'll be up in your github shortly  @blackjok3r 😁

[06-Mar-19 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol...

[06-Mar-19 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nearly eveything I discovered that helps is all merged into KMD now... I didnt keep any advantage a secret

[06-Mar-19 10:53 AM] mrlynch#5735
le-gend

[06-Mar-19 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well yes and no... I see the nodes as a great way to fund ecopsystem projects, but running on at the start of this season was amost a full time job... Now I never touch my node apart form updates. 😄

[06-Mar-19 10:54 AM] mrlynch#5735
specc'ed the server.. hoping to do well in election, but that's gonna be more down to @FishyGuts

[06-Mar-19 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So its more about what OPs bring to the ecosystem, than pure technical skill to run  the node now.

[06-Mar-19 10:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you made running a notary pretty easy on labs 👍

[06-Mar-19 10:55 AM] mrlynch#5735
our main running platform is to assist labs, verus, z development

[06-Mar-19 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats A LOT easier than mainnet.. I hope to get time to port all that to mainnet before election though and make a new setup guide.

[06-Mar-19 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My node is a horrible mess at the moment but it works with basically 0 effort so Im leaving it for now.

[06-Mar-19 10:56 AM] mrlynch#5735
if it works, don't touch it 🤣

[06-Mar-19 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats it

[06-Mar-19 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would like a way to add 3rd party coins as easily as labs adds assetchains ... then 🚀

[06-Mar-19 11:05 AM] ca333#0118
Pinned a message.

[06-Mar-19 12:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@kolo @jl777c regarding the vote bounty for hard working node operators, will supernet/mshark and other funds participate in the vote this year?

[06-Mar-19 12:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
m not sure if I'm a 🍄 🤔 
I wished to contribute better in 2018, couldn't do as much as I wished to do.
Intend to contribute better this year onward with new programming stack.
I don't intend to run for next elections. Can't handle this full time job. Almost whole 2018, it's been @ns408 managing the Meshbits nodes.

[06-Mar-19 12:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and since both our meshbits nodes are bottom, at least count 2 open positions to replace competition 😄

[06-Mar-19 12:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll cheer and support the deserving technically skilled candidates for 2019 🙂

[06-Mar-19 12:54 PM] kolo#1111
That’s why I said I will do another announce very soon with dates and number of spots, not now.

artik_eu is not the only one

[06-Mar-19 03:46 PM] jorian#4555
but it doesn't matter anymore. the top notaries are almost all the most active ones

[06-Mar-19 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will keep my single node here and wont be runing for any more 😃

[06-Mar-19 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Any spots avalible should go to single operators who can use their own infrastructure where ever they may be. Thats the safest for the network.

Good morning all.  
Pirate wants to support the NN network. 
Last year I personally considered running but was hesitant and did not trust my technical ability, so instead I just ran a handful of Giveaways and raffles of my and community donated funds to those who supported the dICOs.  
This year, I have been a proponent of KMD, worked with other projects to bring light and awareness to the people.  I have been changing thought leaders minds on KMD and the whole project.   As you may know, there were many in the community who were not happy about the inception of KMD... but those people are being talked to weekly/monthly by myself when discussing Pirate and KMD ecosystem. 

This year, we are running on a platform of Privacy, z address adoption/usage and ecosystem support.  
Attached is our preliminary distribution ideas for Notary Node income.  
TBH, I probably won't see shit... I hope Lynch is compensated appropriately for his time and management. 

The main purpose is to keep supporting KMD, it's ecosystem, those who helped with the foundation of pirate and to give back to the community as we have been with Plugins, tipbots and so on.

[06-Mar-19 05:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The above are estimates/ideas.  
We will be running for 2 nodes this year.

[06-Mar-19 05:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I am very humble to even be considering this and Pirate is looking forward to continuing the support of the KMD ecosystem and it's projects.
Hopefully you guys don't think I am a Mushroom 😃

Pirate was released unto the wild at 16000 sats.  
It's only 100% logical that all the KMD growth since then is due to Pirate. 

:troll:

[06-Mar-19 05:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Simple.
Nothing to do with CC's or Games or Sapling.  Not at all 

:troll_hardcore:

[06-Mar-19 05:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
There are more platform ideas and announcements to make as we move forward but we hope to show the KMD ecosystem and the crypto world that Pirate means business and supports KMD 100%.

[06-Mar-19 07:10 PM] Audo#5667
Hey guys,

We would like to build a notarynode elections website and have all the election info (like rules, what are notary nodes) on a central place.

Are there any Wordpress devs who would like to work with us and put a site together? You can PM me for more info.

[06-Mar-19 07:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@LooTz Might be able to help but I don't know if he uses Wordpress.  Maybe @mrlynch my Co-Conspirator

[06-Mar-19 07:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
They're both pretty busy lately so I could be rude for even suggesting them 😛  _ They can reach out if it makes sense for them.

[06-Mar-19 07:15 PM] Audo#5667
Alright, hopefully we hear from one of them 😃

[06-Mar-19 07:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Audo can't help with wordpress, but i can probably put up a django (python) cms for you

[06-Mar-19 07:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
how quick/when do u want it?

[06-Mar-19 07:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
i can probably add that to privatebay 😁

[06-Mar-19 07:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
or do u want it on komodplatform.com?

[06-Mar-19 07:30 PM] Audo#5667
Hmm, I haven't heard about that CMS before. Our team is little familiar with WP, so that would be ideal, so we can help too if needed.

[06-Mar-19 07:30 PM] Audo#5667
we would have a different domain

[06-Mar-19 07:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
django is just a web framework for python (like flask but prettier)

[06-Mar-19 07:32 PM] Audo#5667
Ok, thanks. We are gonna review the options tomorrow and make a decision. We want to get this done fairly quickly as the elections are almost here 😃

[06-Mar-19 07:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
i know py and at the moment time is a precious commodity, can't afford to learn wp

[06-Mar-19 07:33 PM] Audo#5667
How quickly can you put things together with Django if we provide content/wireframes?

[06-Mar-19 07:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
i think there is already a cms built in django, all i'd need is the theme / bootstrap you want, content and some form of layout and i can deliver the app code and you can run it on any server u wish

[06-Mar-19 07:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'm not a web dev so won't be able to help much with front end stuff. i can tweak/integrate what u want but can't do it from the ground up

[06-Mar-19 07:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'll be working on this this weekend as i already have to finish our election site

[06-Mar-19 07:37 PM] Audo#5667
Alright, thanks for the info, I'll let you know what is decided. Ideally we would find a wordpress dev to work with.

In general, if anyone here wants to get involved you can, I would like this to be a community ran project to put info together in order to support the elections. We have good resources available for this from the Komodo marketing team side.

[06-Mar-19 07:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
what info do you want on it?

[06-Mar-19 07:45 PM] Audo#5667
that's what we will be brainstorming this week. I don't have good answer yet 😃

[06-Mar-19 08:16 PM] Alright#0419
@kolo are we staying at 4 dev nodes? Are we allowing z VOTE?

[06-Mar-19 08:17 PM] kolo#1111
@Alright yes, 4 dev nodes one per dev. Please wait for stage 2 announce suming up numbers and dates. I need to make just couple of things prior to announcing those.

[06-Mar-19 08:50 PM] jorian#4555
@Audo is this only for this year? since notary nodes + elections are quite inherent to the platform overall, i think it should definitely get a place on the komodoplatform main website

[06-Mar-19 08:51 PM] jorian#4555
that said: is a static webpage generator not better suited than a full blown wordpress site?

[06-Mar-19 09:54 PM] Audo#5667
Yeah, we should build it with future in mind. A lot of the info can be reused in future elections. Perhaps the site could also list all active notaries.

This project is best kept separate from our main domain as for example we got the rebrand coming and a new site.

Regarding static page vs wordpress... honestly I'm not the best persont to judge which route to take. My understanding is that it's easier to update content to a WP site than to a staic one, and we probably have to keep iterating the content on this page especially if we reuse it in 2020.

[06-Mar-19 10:09 PM] jeezy#3408
@Alright   someone said no  Z votes this year  only transparent

[06-Mar-19 10:11 PM] Alright#0419
who?

[06-Mar-19 10:13 PM] Decker#3767
I'm writing my proposal for Season 3 right now and i noticed Z votes address anyway.

[06-Mar-19 10:14 PM] Decker#3767
In case if really no Z votes this year - nothing bad (mean, nothing bad if you notice address for Z votes in your proposals).

[06-Mar-19 10:14 PM] Alright#0419
I was in favor of no z VOTE last year because we still had Jumblr

[06-Mar-19 10:14 PM] Alright#0419
this year, I'd very much like to see z VOTE allowed

[06-Mar-19 10:15 PM] Alright#0419
can't have everyone knowing I am whale bro
