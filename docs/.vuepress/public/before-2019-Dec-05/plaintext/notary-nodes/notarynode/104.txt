Hi, I followed @NNoperators instructions to follow https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo_scripts/blob/master/genkomodo.txt to get the GAMEwif details - Can I just add I had to install PHP-7.2-GMP to get genkomodo.php to run

give it a try, if you don't have it preinstalled then just apt-get install

[08-Apr-19 12:59 AM] Lumbi#8378
who to get rid of this again? 
How did you get rid of :
no ( -> BEER) utxo: need to fund address.(RKB54sZSUWEk6WVGN2Q7TBsjk7csd7Lm2z) or wait for splitfund to confirm
dont have BEER RKB54sZSUWEk6WVGN2Q7TBsjk7csd7Lm2z utxo, please send funds

[08-Apr-19 01:17 AM] Alright#0419
import the privkey

[08-Apr-19 01:17 AM] Alright#0419
or wait for splitfund to confirm 😛

[08-Apr-19 01:40 AM] Lumbi#8378
privkey is in..

[08-Apr-19 01:43 AM] Lumbi#8378
anyway to induce a splitfund?

[08-Apr-19 01:59 AM] NNoperator#3835

Is there a cutoff date for testnet entry? Last few updates have broken my wings just as soon as I've hit cruising altitude.

[08-Apr-19 03:11 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm in the same boat smk 😦

[08-Apr-19 03:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah... doesnt help that updating is the last thing I do before sleep, price of living down under I guess. buy the time I wake up the nosedive is almost at sea level. Pull up in time, but it's taken a few chunks out of the landing gear.

[08-Apr-19 03:15 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
You had time to get the gear out? The bottom of my fuselage has been scraping the treetops for days

[08-Apr-19 04:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
was just about to say that 2nd part

[08-Apr-19 04:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you did the work, it should count

[08-Apr-19 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
komodostats website is pretty accurate. I guess it seems to be up to kolo though what he wants to count :troll:  
IMO I can just make the notarizations leveDB DB fro each chain dump a count. I can make this in a bout 2H. 
This will give and exact stat. That is objective.

[08-Apr-19 04:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@webworker01 off-topic, but since you're here....does pay to pubkey coinbase fully work in the current repo of knomp?

[08-Apr-19 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just saying if someone wants a second count to double check things I know how to make it with the daemon.

[08-Apr-19 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like it it would help with transperancy and such. I think there would be no way for me to pump my count hight enough to get auto election, so I should be trusable to make this stat counter.

[08-Apr-19 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even without ingight

[08-Apr-19 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is a notarizations DB in th3e daemon. that wasnt there last year. Added for MoMoM its extremly fast... You can rip all the notarizations out of KMD wihtin a few minutes

[08-Apr-19 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can make PR if you want. knomp here was based on yours

[08-Apr-19 04:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I have my own way for hush, but one of the pool guys asked specifically today

[08-Apr-19 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe you cna find some improivments to how I did it/.. myt JS is not good.

[08-Apr-19 04:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mostly what you did, but I changed some things and eliminated getsubsidy long ago

[08-Apr-19 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my changd is a config optioon in the couin file.. it acts the same as your pool with it set to false

[08-Apr-19 04:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok will do it soon. Then Im going to have a look at this notarizations DB and see if it counts who notarized what. I think the special exeptions you used are in the stats scripts yeah?> like what timestamp teh official counts started at stc

[08-Apr-19 04:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its important we have some 2nd metric to verisy the results. Even though im sure your site is right, if we are counting from KMD. I will make it pull every stats from KMD only. Inot suing BTC or assetchains. All notarizations have a transaction on KMD, that seems the best place to pull teh data from.

[08-Apr-19 04:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hell I can add nota counts to the blokc index 😂

[08-Apr-19 04:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that way its flat out on chain ... nothing anyone can do to say its wrong then 🤣

[08-Apr-19 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes mostly want to see the diffrence for myself.. the kolo can use whaty evey count he wants to use

[08-Apr-19 04:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that part is still how it is I guess afer reading this chat this morning...

[08-Apr-19 04:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator they are talking about for the year, I think, about countings for auto-reelection

[08-Apr-19 04:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
ahh... a slightly more important metric... 👍

I will make something fast and relaible and accurate today. Im supposed to be doing something else. BUt I could do with some more C++ practive before diving into that.

[08-Apr-19 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think addressindex would help slightly but still wont be that good.. 
The best way is to count each notarization by each node into a tally as they are confirmed (and remvoe when they are reorged)

[08-Apr-19 04:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
practice is for wimps

[08-Apr-19 04:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nice. 12GB for your external DB is pretty wild though... when its already on chain... why not just grab the data from the daemon with a RPC call 😄

[08-Apr-19 04:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha, you made it work thats the importnatt thing

[08-Apr-19 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm yeah nota DB doesnt track who notarized though lol.. only the block hash's etc.

[08-Apr-19 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
shouldnt be that hard to work out though

[08-Apr-19 06:11 AM] mrlynch#5735
damn, i need to change my sleep patterns, missing all the action

[08-Apr-19 06:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[08-Apr-19 06:18 AM] mrlynch#5735
what's with the dwy attack? still happening?

[08-Apr-19 06:22 AM] phm87#7395
Dwy attack may happen from today 3 pm utc

[08-Apr-19 06:22 AM] phm87#7395
Or it may happen later or not happen

[08-Apr-19 06:23 AM] mrlynch#5735
do your own

[08-Apr-19 06:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think k he needs my help. There is actually code in the daemon that filters out transactions not from yourself... But they are disabled in the jl777 repo

[08-Apr-19 06:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This cuts off the dwy attack from the source, but you need a second daemon to consolidate all the dust

[08-Apr-19 06:24 AM] phm87#7395
@blackjok3r  do you mean that komodo from jl777 repo can protect from dwy atks ?

[08-Apr-19 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If u modify and enable the staked notary code yes. Its not straight forward. Ibhavent even done it myself yet

[08-Apr-19 06:24 AM] phm87#7395

[08-Apr-19 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm not sure why he's attacking you guys, as nobody every didn't this to any notary but once by accident he sent 500,000 utxos to a labs notary by accident 😂

labs

yeah.. by accident 😂

Man that made no sense... U hope u get it

[08-Apr-19 06:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was he meant to attack a pool... But sent to wwtong addredd

The following special strings are accepted inside the array:
                             - "ANY_TADDR":   Merge UTXOs from any taddrs belonging to the wallet.
                             - "ANY_SPROUT":  Merge notes from any Sprout zaddrs belonging to the wallet.
                             - "ANY_SAPLING": Merge notes from any Sapling zaddrs belonging to the wallet.
                         If a special string is given, any given addresses of that type will be counted as duplicates and cause an error.

[08-Apr-19 06:30 AM] mrlynch#5735
i knew about the input, was just thinking that it can only go to a shielded address.. good to know

[08-Apr-19 06:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I added an extra field to it, but it has a fatal flaw, if the attacker sends u iguana utxo.... Then it won't merge them

[08-Apr-19 06:31 AM] mrlynch#5735
so best to just sendtoaddress to self?

[08-Apr-19 06:31 AM] phm87#7395
Iguana utxo ? Is it the result of coin splits ?

[08-Apr-19 06:31 AM] NNoperator#3835
It looks like your script isn't standalone @blackjok3r

[08-Apr-19 06:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I know how to fix but will see what happens with this dwy attack before doing something about it. Going to focus on getting accurate notarizations stats off chain efficiently this arvo, pretty sure I already worked it out.

[08-Apr-19 06:34 AM] NNoperator#3835
Is printkey.py still broken ?

[08-Apr-19 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ideally you want to be merging anything that u don't need, print key only works on labs

[08-Apr-19 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It just extracts the notary address pubkey or wif from an ini file.

[08-Apr-19 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
How u merge can be done thousands of ways, I made the z merge thing to recover CMaurices labs notary after the accidental attack. But its not ideal by any means. At least not right now

[08-Apr-19 07:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@NNoperator easiest way to tweak for personal use would be to just set your address / wif etc as a variable at the start of the script and remove the prinkkey bit.
