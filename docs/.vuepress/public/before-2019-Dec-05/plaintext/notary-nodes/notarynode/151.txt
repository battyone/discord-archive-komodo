KMD would be an "on average" of like 16-17 UTXOs per day, where as assetchains can be in the hundreds

you can mine on a second node set to a pubkey in your NN wallet if you wanted

I'm working on a slightly more detailed README.md for 2019NNtestnet, wondering at what point and how the op will get their keys?  Start komodod, create address, get keys, stop komodod, start again with -pubkey?  Then what about creating the iguana wallet and wp file, I saw a comment that encryption on that wallet not needed for testnet but maybe is good practice anyway?

@VoskCoin it surely is a good start, but your NN's performance can fluctuate a lot, especially on the 6h span

[17-Apr-19 05:25 PM] Alright#0419
@Greer the encrypt wallet thing is useless as the WIF must be in wp file anyway

[17-Apr-19 05:26 PM] Alright#0419
if that readme is not enough to get someone started, they likely won't be a competent op

[17-Apr-19 05:26 PM] Alright#0419
also it teaches them to ask questions when they do need help

[17-Apr-19 05:27 PM] Alright#0419
the knowledge needed to run a NN is not easy to quantify. You may be able to give a copy/paste tutorial, but then we have noobs running who won't be able to properly debug their node

[17-Apr-19 05:28 PM] Alright#0419
Yes, not trying to scare away noobs

[17-Apr-19 05:28 PM] Alright#0419
trying to teach them to understand how/when to ask for help

[17-Apr-19 05:28 PM] Alright#0419
because there will be many occasions where there isn't a copy/paste tutorial throughout the year

[17-Apr-19 05:29 PM] Greer#0666
as I said last night, not looking for copy/paste tutorial
`Start PIZZA, BEER, TXSCLCC and KMD daemons with -pubkey=`
How would an experienced sysops know how to start PIZZA, BEER and TXSCLCC without coming here to ask?  What pubkey, at what point did we create any addresses?

{Reactions}
🤦 

[17-Apr-19 05:30 PM] Alright#0419
Sorry, I assumed a person running for an NN would have used komodod before

[17-Apr-19 05:30 PM] Alright#0419
crazy thought

[17-Apr-19 05:31 PM] Alright#0419
but yes, you're getting the point I'm making, learning when/how to ask for help 😛

[17-Apr-19 05:31 PM] Greer#0666
using komodod doesn't require running PIZZA, BEER and TXSCLCC.  What you are actually assuming is that someone running for NN op was previously an NN op

[17-Apr-19 05:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
no offence, but it seems you're the only one that had that problem ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[17-Apr-19 05:31 PM] mrlynch#5735

[17-Apr-19 05:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
but u figured it out instead blaming someone else for .... <- insert reason here

[17-Apr-19 05:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
and speaking of mindsets, isn't a sysops / sysadmin / insert fancy geek title here supposed to be solution oriented?!

[17-Apr-19 05:33 PM] Greer#0666
anyone that was involved in kmdlabs didn't have that problem.  I got over the problem very quickly.  I think it could be better documented without lowering the barrier to entry and it was suggested that if I believe that, I should better document it.  I'm doing that.

[17-Apr-19 05:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
i wasn't involved in kmdlabs either

from this channel.. txsclcc was added at a later date to simulate the addition of a new coin to dpow

[17-Apr-19 05:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
it was part of the test and it was announced in the same way i'm assuming (correct me if i'm wrong) is happening on mainnet

[17-Apr-19 05:35 PM] Greer#0666
nobody things that is something should be on the readme but me?

[17-Apr-19 05:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
nope

everyone running should need to search this discord to find it, thats the barrier to entry, using discord search?

[17-Apr-19 05:37 PM] PHBA2061#2530
sorry I have to disagree there, I'm not a mainnet NN op, but I still have some minimal understanding & knowledge about Komodo asset chains

[17-Apr-19 05:37 PM] Greer#0666
`understanding & knowledge about Komodo asset chains` absolutely yes

[17-Apr-19 05:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`discord skills are a must, sadly`
OK, this is my final comment on the topic
I just dropped a feken grand so you'd stfu about it, but if you can't operate a feken search box, then perhaps a tech job securing people's finances isn't the job for you....

[17-Apr-19 05:38 PM] mrlynch#5735
the announcement ar3 made here for mainnet.. the testnet simulates, guess what mainnet so yes, announcing the addition of a new coin was done in the same manner

[17-Apr-19 05:38 PM] Greer#0666
I dont understand why I keep having to repeat myself.  I'm not a newb, not suggesting this be a one click install for plebs, not in the slightest.

i don't know that, i don't know you, but your attitude points to something else

i did read the whole convo btw

[17-Apr-19 05:39 PM] Greer#0666
CG, you wasted a grand if thats what the domain cost you.  The wiki and all official docs should be on official komodo properties.  Github wiki for example.

@Greer 10 years for the domain and the hosting, surely that should be sufficient time for someone that has the job to stfu about "barrier to entry" and actively reduce that barrier

[17-Apr-19 05:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
i don't give 2 shits about politics... i realize what this job means and from a tech point and operator character/mindset point spoon feeding is bad mkay?!

ok, moving on.  encrypted wallet useless on just testnet or mainnet too?  sounds like mainnet too.

[17-Apr-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it is having to sign tx almost constantly, so wallet needs to be unlocked

[17-Apr-19 05:49 PM] Greer#0666
ok, thats what it sounded like.  I was going by this doc https://docs.komodoplatform.com/notary/setup-Komodo-Notary-Node.html#setting-up-supernet-iguana

if you follow that tut, your WIF is in `~/SuperNET/iguana/wp_7776` anyway

[17-Apr-19 05:51 PM] Alright#0419
so why not just cut out the 2 extra steps for walletpassphrase and encryptwallet

[17-Apr-19 05:52 PM] Greer#0666
yes, this is why I was asking, thought I was missing something.

[17-Apr-19 05:52 PM] Greer#0666
all clear now.

[17-Apr-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
i think originally encryptwallet printed out useful info, but things evolved over last 3 years

i mentioned multiple times that i'll work on updating the mainnet guide which is slightly outdated before the next season starts in this channel

[17-Apr-19 06:30 PM] PHBA2061#2530
it seems like you're experiencing what happened to my node last week, it barely get any nota on BEER chain

[17-Apr-19 06:31 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you manage to get it fixed ?

[17-Apr-19 06:32 PM] PHBA2061#2530
based on the value of recvmask, your node is in there, which mean it has a chance to sign a nota, but for some reasons it barely get into the bestmask

[17-Apr-19 06:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
my utxo target or threshold values to blame ?

[17-Apr-19 06:33 PM] PHBA2061#2530
no, I didn't manage to despite trying different things, it just fixed itself after the last update

[17-Apr-19 06:33 PM] PHBA2061#2530
your utxo target seems correct to me
