`check is the recvmasks for the other peers`
What indicates peers in the recvmasks output?

[06-Apr-19 01:35 PM] gt#2812
if you match others revmasks

[06-Apr-19 04:14 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I just found out something interesting & want to share, in case someone didn't know yet
```
curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}                                      " | jq -cr '.[] | select(.recvmask != "               0") | .'
```
output (if I'm not mistaken, blackjok3r told me that this only show the output for BEER chain)
```
{"notary":"blackjok3r","bestk":12,"recvmask":"         100195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
{"notary":"Strob","bestk":12,"recvmask":"         100195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
{"notary":"jorian","bestk":12,"recvmask":"         100195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
{"notary":"PHBA2061","bestk":12,"recvmask":"         100195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
{"notary":"Lumbi","bestk":12,"recvmask":"         100195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
{"notary":"ComputerGenie","bestk":12,"recvmask":"            195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
{"notary":"mrlynch","bestk":12,"recvmask":"         100195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
{"notary":"karasugoi","bestk":12,"recvmask":"         100195a","bestmask":"            195a"}
```
If you convert `bestmask `into binary value, it gives `0001 1001 0101 1010` , read it from right to left and compare to the NN list in  `testnet.json` file (starting  with  Alright and ending with karasugoi), then the position of the "seven 1 bit" of bestmask correspond to blackjok3r (position 2), Strob (4), jorian (5) , PHBA2061  (7),  Lumbi (9), ComputerGenie (12) & mrlynch (13). And those are the people who signed the multisig tx.
Please correct me if I'm wrong 😃

[06-Apr-19 04:57 PM] NNoperator#3835
It seems Genie had a different recvmask from the group, but still participated.  Maybe this isn't a notarization yet ?

[06-Apr-19 05:03 PM] PHBA2061#2530
If I'm not wrong , the final result is stored in bestmask, I also noticed CG usually has a different recvmask, but I don't know why

[06-Apr-19 05:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you want to log stuff from iguana and add timestamp to the lines:
```removed```
this will also display to console; be careful not to ctrl + c; or you can add a `&` at the end

edit: don't add & .. iguana crashes after some time.. not sure if that's the reason, but seems to be consistent with &
edit2: removed for now as it seems to kill iguana
