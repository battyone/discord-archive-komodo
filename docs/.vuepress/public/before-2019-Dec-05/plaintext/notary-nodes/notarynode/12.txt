[10-Jul-18 10:19 PM] jl777c#5810
unix is written in C

[10-Jul-18 10:19 PM] jl777c#5810
C++ compilers used to written in C, but I think now they are written in C++

[10-Jul-18 10:20 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty cool trick to write a compiler for a language in its own language

[10-Jul-18 10:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
afaik you prefer C for its "clean" way, and avoiding using unneeded things

[10-Jul-18 10:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
libraries / func

[10-Jul-18 10:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
and... speed

[10-Jul-18 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> Compilers written in the language they compile... Mind: blown.

[11-Jul-18 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I need to rewrite my stuff using this new JSON aswell. I think for my scripts, it will be very easy, I can just use the default ./assetchains to launch everything and use a variation of Dwy's code above to parse a coinlist that has only the names. This allows all my scripts to work exactly the way they already do, but saves me manually editing them each time a coin is added.

[11-Jul-18 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
However for now, this is not a priority, my node is workring well. Once is slips down the list again and starts to slow down it will be a good time to get some updates in. Maybe one of the last free for alls lol.

[11-Jul-18 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
I prefer C as I am too lazy to learn any other language, oh, and I can code 100x faster in C than in anything else, so it keeps reinforcing itself

[11-Jul-18 08:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I read your js code a while ago, and it was really good for a simple C dev 😄

How do you become a Notary Node? - Komodo
Komodo Platform's notary nodes are servers that perform critical operations for the ecosystem's security. So how do you become a notary node? Learn here.

[11-Jul-18 03:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Awaiting the election you still can setup a node and play with it. Obviously you won t notarize but if the testnet opens again you ll be able to run your notary on testnet to test stuff and learn how it works

[11-Jul-18 03:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
i believe it s a "when" testnet will open and not "if". Btw if you need any support for setup / understanding things you got the faq or this channel. Feel free to ask any question

[11-Jul-18 03:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
The more you ll be prepared, the more chances you ll have when elections comes to convince people to vote for you.

[11-Jul-18 03:47 PM] klunex#3191
ok thx

[11-Jul-18 03:54 PM] klunex#3191
its allowed to setup the server also on a cloud plattform ?

if you can mange that working, there is no restriction afaik

hi guys; I was following this guide https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/Setup-Komodo-Notary-Node , everything seems  working fine, but the second day, after resetting my computer and restarting komodod, I received this message "NOTARY_PUBKEY.()
initialized  at 1531327962
............komodod: main.cpp:3436: void PruneBlockIndexCandidates(): Assertion `!setBlockIndexCandidates.empty()' failed."                          someone has any idea how to fix this ? or is it because I'm not an official notary node ?

also there is a step mentioning about sending the btcpubkey to @kolo  or James, do I have to do that aswell ?
