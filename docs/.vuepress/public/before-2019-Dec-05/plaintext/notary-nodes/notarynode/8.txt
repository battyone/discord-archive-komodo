How much hash was pointed towards kmd?

[27-Jun-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know... I didnt do it lol... but to mine that many blocks it was thousands of GPU's

[27-Jun-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe a hundred thousand even

[27-Jun-18 12:19 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe z9 Minis?

[27-Jun-18 12:21 PM] Steve666#9642
yes that

[27-Jun-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was an outrageous amount of hash.

[27-Jun-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have never seen that much at once before

[27-Jun-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but once the diff went up, Notaries resumed as normal.

[27-Jun-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so remove f4a and they cant do it

[27-Jun-18 12:23 PM] SHossain#0007
z9 minis being delivered. that could be it

[27-Jun-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if it was those, it was a lot of them.

[27-Jun-18 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Obviously if we can stop them from doing it, we should. So james removed f4a starting at block 1million as there is a Hardfork for interest changing to 1 month then already.

[27-Jun-18 12:26 PM] cipi#4502
hello everybody... tried to read all the discussion, but i am a bit confused... what should i do now? Update komodo and iguana to newest dev-branch?

[27-Jun-18 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
update to newest... you might lose AC until enough update.

BTC /CHIPS/GAME work as normal after update

[27-Jun-18 12:29 PM] cipi#4502
ok, i see... and the thing with RFOX? Do we already notarize that or was that just preparation?

[27-Jun-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
they dont have MoMoM data

[27-Jun-18 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I put RFOX on cant see any reason not to.

[27-Jun-18 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Verus on the other hand, still cant get it working on my server.

[27-Jun-18 12:42 PM] Deleted User#0000

[27-Jun-18 12:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
another thing : about those external coin, am still sticking to jl's gamecredits repo, seems to work, and I updated VRSC to latest. What advice would you give us @jl777c : just update when we re updating everything else ? or wait until a commit is validated by inside team before rebuilding those coins ?

[27-Jun-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
GAME should be ok for foreseable future, we will announce if a must update happens

[27-Jun-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
VRSC can use the verus repo

[27-Jun-18 12:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok, thanks

[27-Jun-18 12:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, all that is is a matter of trust, and as it seems VRSC devs are whitelisted ^^ so I just updated it. That made me test their new improvements for CPU btw.

[27-Jun-18 12:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
so without FFA, how much will % will Notaries mine now?

[27-Jun-18 12:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
probably gonna have to move my z9 to something else, if KMD isn't gonna have FFA eventually

[27-Jun-18 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
GPU percentage is always over 25%, if it falls under that noarties stop mining.

[27-Jun-18 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
talk to genie... he gets more KMD outside of f4a

[27-Jun-18 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
f4a is just 1 more block per 2000

[27-Jun-18 01:04 PM] xRobeSx#5136
i though F4A was 200 blocks, every 2000?

[27-Jun-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
64 blocks every 2000

[27-Jun-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
1 block per notary more by eliminating f4a

[27-Jun-18 01:06 PM] xRobeSx#5136
so about what % will external miners have then?  they'll just get 1 out of every 65 then?

[27-Jun-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
25%

[27-Jun-18 01:07 PM] xRobeSx#5136
sorry, i just don't get how its still 25% when F4A is eliminated.

[27-Jun-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, 24%

[27-Jun-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but we calibrate it to 25% so that is why I say 25%

[27-Jun-18 01:13 PM] popcornbag#4039
hi , if i want start komodo with only notary and not mining i start komodo with only the flag -notary and -pubkey rigth ?

[27-Jun-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
just dont have -gen  or -genproclimit

[27-Jun-18 01:14 PM] popcornbag#4039
ok ty

[27-Jun-18 01:32 PM] titomane#3101
After update yesterday my AR node only notarize BTC Chips & Game

[27-Jun-18 01:32 PM] titomane#3101
Checked getbestblockhash same for kmd

[27-Jun-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
more need to update, then AC notarization will resume

[27-Jun-18 01:59 PM] jorian#4555
do we need jl777 or dev branch?

[27-Jun-18 02:00 PM] SHossain#0007

[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> @lukechilds i just made a comment on the conversation tab.

[27-Jun-18 03:28 PM] kolo#1111
@lukechilds please, use different script name for that, not assetchains file. You're a) missing todays additions there b) missing jq dependancy (not all have jq installed)

[27-Jun-18 03:29 PM] kolo#1111
If your script will go well - we will just remove assetchains file later switching to it

[27-Jun-18 03:31 PM] kolo#1111
I also agree with  emmanux - params should be an arrya of params if do everything clean. Not in one line.

[27-Jun-18 03:31 PM] kolo#1111
> There is a reason for that. You need to keep data structure consistent. Two keys and their two values aren't a string. They are two keys, and two values.

[27-Jun-18 03:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thing with one liner is that it will be a pain to just exclude params

[27-Jun-18 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The non optional params can be in one line, as you CANT remove them.

[27-Jun-18 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats all I am saying... it was easier to parse as a single line

[27-Jun-18 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if its not a big deal to assemble the start command by having them all seperate then I guess it doesnt matter

[27-Jun-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> once you parse the json it's just a normal data object.

[27-Jun-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will leave making a working command using jq to somebody else... I wont even attempt it.

half the nodes will stop working if you force them to somehthine new

[27-Jun-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have no issue, but it will hapen for sure

[27-Jun-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
whatever is chosen needs to work with bash, at least for a reasonable change over time

[27-Jun-18 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe its better to go the other way, and use a plain text file then have a script to generate the JSON.

[27-Jun-18 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once you get enough operators using JSON the plain text can be phased out

Started notarizing AC again here üòÑ

[27-Jun-18 04:57 PM] kolo#1111
everyone Here is time to update your nodes. You will have to do the following:

1. Update codebase of komodo to the latest dev/beta
2. Run assetchains and new asset named RFOX will appear.
3. Import your kmdwif privkey to RFOX chain `./fiat/rfox importprivkey xxxxxx`. You will have 0.999 RFOX.
4. Install veruscoin daemon:
`https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/tree/dev`
dev branch works perfectly for me. Install is 100% straightforward. README has steps (`git pull`, `./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)`), but they are totally equal to komodod, no additional library or reinstalling packages
5. Run veruscoin. It's the only complication, because it should be run using this:
`~/VerusCoin/src/komodod -ac_name=VRSC -ac_algo=verushash -ac_cc=1 -ac_veruspos=50 -ac_supply=0 -ac_eras=3 -ac_reward=0,38400000000,2400000000 -ac_halving=1,43200,1051920 -ac_decay=100000000,0,0 -ac_end=10080,226080,0 -ac_timelockgte=19200000000 -ac_timeunlockfrom=129600 -ac_timeunlockto=1180800 -addnode=185.25.48.236 -addnode=185.64.105.111`
Notice that it's using komodod binary from veruscoin repo, not usual one. Be careful if you have komodod systemwide.
Next operations with  VRCS can be done as usually, by `komodo-cli -ac_name=VRSC` and `./fiat/vrsc`
6.  Import kmdwif to veruscoin - `./fiat/vrsc importprivkey` - you will have 0.999 VRSC.
7. Update iguana and do everything else as usually.
8. Please, monitor your assets and PM me when refill is needed

BTW, if all 64 nodes will work correctly one moment - notary alarm bot will show hidden message with bounty privkey.
