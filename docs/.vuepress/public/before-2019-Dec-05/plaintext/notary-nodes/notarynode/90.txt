we can only speculate. James can confirm when he is here

[05-Apr-19 11:05 PM] SHossain#0007
another speculation can be some ops running modified/custom/different iguana

[05-Apr-19 11:07 PM] PHBA2061#2530
Idk but by observing notarystats  regularly, I also notice that notarizations usually happen with the same group of people

[05-Apr-19 11:10 PM] SHossain#0007
are you guys running iguana from the testnet repo?

Has this only just started happening?

[05-Apr-19 11:12 PM] SHossain#0007
i've noticed this yesterday as well.

[05-Apr-19 11:13 PM] SHossain#0007
but, on same block 2 sets of notarizations, today i have seen first

[05-Apr-19 11:13 PM] SHossain#0007
that made me interested to look into

[05-Apr-19 11:18 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah it did happen yesterday as well, but the 2 groups are slightly different

[05-Apr-19 11:20 PM] PHBA2061#2530
before the update I was "in the same group" with you @SHossain  , after the update I'm in the same group with Alright.

[05-Apr-19 11:21 PM] SHossain#0007
is @Alright using optimized iguana or iguana from a different repo?

[05-Apr-19 11:24 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I think he uses the same as us

you maybe get a notarization (if yes, then you see the 'MINE' print out)
you unlock it

[06-Apr-19 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@SHossain 
When u say two notarizations in the same block are they both for the same or different blocks? Its very possibly just two nota being confirmed in the same block and is actually very normal behaviour. Labs had major issues making. Cross chain stuff work reliably having to deal with this exact situation. 
 It can be for plenty of reasons. Sure my iguana could be doing it, but I don't see how as it is reaching consensus with main net nodes perfectly as is it on testnet. I have noticed the json has not been updated on git instantly, like the curl doesn't always pull it.  Which can also do it. Will check mine shortly. I suggest people pulling that file manually and checking it is actually updated for them before restarting.

@Deleted User your proposal is not rendering on the election site because github/jekyll needs the file in UTF-8 encoding.   for some reason it is ISO-8859-1.   Can you fix the file encoding so it renders in website (& make your images absolute URLs)
e.g.

it's a simple curl command essentially - but you can call this kind of script from anywhere on your system, from one of your "other" scripts to give you a status update.

@mrlynch (I just used curl, but there must be a few good scripts around. `curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}" | jq -c .[]` )

The scripts seem.to break for some reason. Not sure why. Its best to just use the curl and look at it manually

If your recvmask is always different than the rest something is wrong. Can be useful, but it seems with the latest iguana its less of a problem.
