Yeh, its indeed slowed right up now

oh, scratch that number we just added another block...

Kmd was taking 6h for me on last test, I think the jl777 branch has a fix which may significantly speed up blocks after the sapling activation.

How can I check for PIZZA problem?

[05-Apr-19 10:37 AM] CHMEX#0686
if you have enough utxo than it's maybe just bad luck maybe clean the wallet

[05-Apr-19 10:39 AM] Alright#0419
@zatJUM are you using LABS komodod?

[05-Apr-19 10:39 AM] Alright#0419
ping

[05-Apr-19 10:40 AM] Alright#0419
you receive a block, you search for a UTXO, you broadcast to iguana peers

[05-Apr-19 10:40 AM] Alright#0419
if you do that first, you get a notarization

[05-Apr-19 10:41 AM] PHBA2061#2530
why do I feel like notarizations usually hapeens between the same group of people.
Like me and Alright we rarely notarize together, (may be partially because  we're not in the other's peers list)

[05-Apr-19 10:43 AM] zatJUM#9924
@Alright No, I use komodod on jl777 repo (dev branch)

[05-Apr-19 10:48 AM] Alright#0419
@PHBA2061 it's a matter of how quickly you receive the block to be notarized (height % 10) and how quickly you can agree with iguana peers

[05-Apr-19 10:48 AM] Alright#0419
so not just ping between participants but ping between miners as well

[05-Apr-19 10:49 AM] Alright#0419
Along with how quickly iguana can select a UTXO

[05-Apr-19 10:52 AM] PHBA2061#2530
got that, anyway I don't understand why our nodes can't connect, the ping is not even 4ms

troll troll_hmm 😭 

[05-Apr-19 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The slowest part of the process is selecting utxo, this was the first thing I optimised and is still the main thing. You need a good receive mask though otherwise not much happens as other nodes can't see you are there. The goal is to enter receive mask first by responding yo your peers first.

[05-Apr-19 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
How you go about that is up to you lol, I think I may add some comments to iguana for the places I found that seem to affect things and see what others can come up with.

@blackjok3r  Thanks

[05-Apr-19 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My iguana basically just selects a utxo randomly without counting the entire wallet... Also `time komodo-cli listunspent > /dev/null` get that as fast as possible. A wallet with 700+ utxos will take longer than any meaningful ping time, and is usually the cause of a poor preforming node.

[05-Apr-19 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also we can speed up the rate at which iguana is checking the block heights, so it starts a round as quickly as possible after receiving the block.

[05-Apr-19 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But go too fast and u will crash your kmd daemon

[05-Apr-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The other option we may have is to slow down the receive mask so that nodes have longer to respond... But it will hard fork the iguana consensus. This will result in a mor "fair" distribution of notarizations.

[05-Apr-19 11:08 AM] CrisF#3405
I've got 85 KMD connections, but no notarisations since changing :abusedsmily:

[05-Apr-19 11:08 AM] CrisF#3405
(only 23 before changing)

[05-Apr-19 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The most important thing is to not restart iguana... If yournnode is down it will be ignored by the other nodes for a while after restarting. Not sure how that works but its defiantly something that seems to happen, like some kind of banned mode... Doesn't appear to be anything that does that in the code though lol.

[05-Apr-19 11:12 AM] CrisF#3405
I was wondering why I was taking so long to start notarising after updatg, while others get backu right away.

[05-Apr-19 11:12 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@CrisF  can you do me a favor , try this command`komodo-cli getpeerinfo | grep 195.201.137.5` to see if it return anything ?

[05-Apr-19 11:13 AM] CrisF#3405
Nothing.

[05-Apr-19 11:13 AM] CHMEX#0686
also not here.
but I see you on the explorer node

[05-Apr-19 11:14 AM] PHBA2061#2530
ok, how about  `komodo-cli getpeerinfo -ac_name=BEER | grep 195.201.137.5`

[05-Apr-19 11:14 AM] PHBA2061#2530
then try the same with PIZZA and TXSCLCC

[05-Apr-19 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Connection to other notaries on the coin daemons isn't that important... I tried it. What I attempted was to connect my daemons only to nodes close to me to seen if that made a difference of how many notarizations that group of nodes made... In short it didn't make much diff at all.

[05-Apr-19 11:15 AM] CrisF#3405
See you on TXSCLCC

[05-Apr-19 11:15 AM] CrisF#3405
not others

[05-Apr-19 11:15 AM] CHMEX#0686
none for me

[05-Apr-19 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to be starting your dpow state machine thread at the same time as min SIG's of other nodes.

[05-Apr-19 11:16 AM] PHBA2061#2530
no it's not me, it's Alright 's IP 😃

[05-Apr-19 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then entre the receive mask the fastest... Which is pretty much utxo selection.

[05-Apr-19 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So you need the block at the same time as min SIG's of other nodes, then act on that at the same time as them, or even before them, which is how my iguana is able to preform better. Its waiting already for other nodes to join the round.

[05-Apr-19 11:19 AM] Strob#3417

[05-Apr-19 11:20 AM] CrisF#3405
There probably aren't that many TXSCLCC nodes out there.

[05-Apr-19 11:20 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm on 27.

Conn 33 here

[05-Apr-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can only get as many connection as there are open ports out there, the best way to get more is to open the port then never ever restart the daemon.

[05-Apr-19 11:21 AM] Alright#0419
I'm wondering if the first people to update have a significant advantage. I will wait ~1 hour myself before I update my node today

[05-Apr-19 11:21 AM] CrisF#3405
I have died after every update.

[05-Apr-19 11:21 AM] Alright#0419
I've been the first node to update most days, as I test that it starts up properly before pinging you guys

[05-Apr-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Updating first is a disadvantage ;)

[05-Apr-19 11:22 AM] CrisF#3405
A few times I was flying, then update, then dead in the water.

[05-Apr-19 11:22 AM] CHMEX#0686
are there planed changes for today? no PR yet

[05-Apr-19 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That is unless 100% of nodes update at the same time

[05-Apr-19 11:22 AM] Alright#0419
yes, SHo merged one earlier today that I had to remove

[05-Apr-19 11:23 AM] Alright#0419
going to add it back

[05-Apr-19 11:23 AM] CHMEX#0686
ok

[05-Apr-19 11:23 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@Alright  then should we pre-define the person  who will update first today ? so we can track the stats easily ?

[05-Apr-19 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll be home soon and will upgrade my nodes vps see if I can get it to work again... May need to snapshot it and move it overseas, as there are 0 other nodes in aus

[05-Apr-19 11:24 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright Any idea on the time for update?

[05-Apr-19 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
sure, you want to do it? 😛

[05-Apr-19 11:24 AM] PHBA2061#2530
well if noone want to do it, then I will 😃

[05-Apr-19 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
~+3.5 hours @CrisF

[05-Apr-19 11:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks.

[05-Apr-19 11:29 AM] CrisF#3405
To try out a new node I just need to change my ip and wait for an update, right?

[05-Apr-19 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You will add to the IP list in either case when u add all the other nodes

[05-Apr-19 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Your IP is broadcast randomly in each packet

[05-Apr-19 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem mainney had was that more IPS were in the list than would fit, and it was segregating the network, but that has been fixed

[05-Apr-19 11:33 AM] CrisF#3405
I have a lot to figure out here first.  Get this one running better. Then try another closer to what would be used on mainnet.

@blackjok3r I have a node in Brisbane 😛

[05-Apr-19 12:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I had one in Sydney and the ping times sucked so bad I killed it

[05-Apr-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with a larger more spread out network that problem goes away... but its counter productive to place a node far from other nodes... However if 50% of nodes do this the "ping" problem goes away

[05-Apr-19 12:56 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Well I have my node where I plan to have it on the mainnet, so I guess I shouldn't have too bad a ping problem there

[05-Apr-19 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Brisbane should be fine, mines in Perth lol... but Perth does have pretty good pings to singapore and there is lots of nodes there

[05-Apr-19 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
testnet is in sydney atm... just snapshotted it going to try EU and see if I go directly to the top 😄

[05-Apr-19 12:59 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Would `addnode`ing our nodes together help at all

[05-Apr-19 01:00 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Also, do the UTXO's in your KMD wallet matter at all?

[05-Apr-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont beleive so, iguana adds all nodes anyway, and the daemon is not that important. these chains have not many miners. So adding the miners would be the best strategy there I think... 
UTXOs in KMD wallet are the most important. `time komodo-cli listunspent > /dev/null`

[05-Apr-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
try to get that as fast as you can. that is the goal to have a good node
