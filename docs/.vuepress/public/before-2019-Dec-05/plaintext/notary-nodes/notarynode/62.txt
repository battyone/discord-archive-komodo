do we need to update?

[31-Mar-19 06:11 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Nope
My pubkey was added two days ago

only started 4 hours ago
this is what happen when you make the PR when your server is not ready
and it takes you 2 days (because of course in the middle of family times) to realize the VPS was totally crappy 😅

[31-Mar-19 06:17 PM] metaphilibert#0926

crappy VPS is the best way to do it tho 🤣

@metaphilibert glad I’m not alone 🤗

[31-Mar-19 06:50 PM] SHossain#0007
anyone has any changes?  we have new pubkey.  can ping for the update in an hour (1) if you guys are ready or wait for tomorrow (2)

Stressless testnet :troll:

[31-Mar-19 06:59 PM] SHossain#0007
i would like to give some time. besides i guess infotech-al is not home yet to start

[31-Mar-19 07:01 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Maybe at the end we could simulate some situations like changing branches to fix a bug and have to rechange a few hours later, and introduce some bug that need some resync to fix also
Kidding of course

[31-Mar-19 07:02 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Not easy to set a frequency when candidates pop up randomly

[31-Mar-19 07:03 PM] SHossain#0007
we can probably add a new coin, TXSCLCC (easiest without modifying current iguana)

[31-Mar-19 07:04 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm currently notarizing alone this chain on a separate network. stopping that and adding here can be good small practice?

[31-Mar-19 07:06 PM] metaphilibert#0926
I don't know this animal
But why not?

[31-Mar-19 07:06 PM] SHossain#0007
TXSCLCC is a test chain for CC development and other general dev usage for who knows. not being used much.

[31-Mar-19 07:06 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Adding a coin is something to learn

[31-Mar-19 07:07 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. expect an announcement in the next hour with new coin additon

[31-Mar-19 07:07 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Cool 😉

[31-Mar-19 07:08 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Ha it's an AC

[31-Mar-19 07:08 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Good anyway, step by step

[31-Mar-19 07:12 PM] metaphilibert#0926
aah found it
```./komodod -ac_name=TXSCLCC -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=54.36.126.42 -addnode=94.130.224.11 &```
correct?

[31-Mar-19 07:12 PM] SHossain#0007
3rd party is not needed for testnet

[31-Mar-19 07:12 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, correct

[31-Mar-19 07:13 PM] SHossain#0007
for this chain, i'll not send any funds. mine 1 block with CPU and ops have to use that 😄

{Reactions}

[31-Mar-19 07:13 PM] SHossain#0007
mine funds and notarize

[31-Mar-19 07:15 PM] metaphilibert#0926
o7

[31-Mar-19 07:18 PM] metaphilibert#0926
remark it is forbidden to mine with more than a thread
i speak for the kind of guys thinking it could be cool to rent hash power to get all the TXSCLCC and empeaching the others to mine 😇

[31-Mar-19 07:20 PM] SHossain#0007
oh..nooooo.....no point to mine more than one block for funds.

[31-Mar-19 07:20 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll have a separate machine mining all the time. so, blocks will be generated in a regular interval

[31-Mar-19 07:21 PM] SHossain#0007
and 1 CPU thread for 1 block is more than enough

[31-Mar-19 07:21 PM] SHossain#0007
it's not KMD or bitcoin :abusedsmily:

[31-Mar-19 08:12 PM] SHossain#0007
@deleted-role Time for another update. We have added a new chain TXSCLCC.
```
./komodod -pubkey=$pubkey -ac_name=TXSCLCC -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=54.36.126.42 -addnode=94.130.224.11 &
```
Start the chian first, sync fully, mine a block using only 1 CPU thread to use for notarization. Then, stop mining.

Update (`git pull`) and launch iguana just by using `./m_notary_testnet` which will then start notarizing the new chain.

[31-Mar-19 08:15 PM] Strob#3417
To mine we do this: ./komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC setgenerate true ?

[31-Mar-19 08:15 PM] CHMEX#0686
./komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC setgenerate true 1

[31-Mar-19 08:15 PM] CHMEX#0686
once you have a block 
./komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC setgenerate false

[31-Mar-19 08:16 PM] Strob#3417
Ok I just check balance to see if I have mined a block?

[31-Mar-19 08:16 PM] CHMEX#0686
correct

[31-Mar-19 08:16 PM] CHMEX#0686
reward is 100 EDIT it's 25

[31-Mar-19 08:16 PM] SHossain#0007
25

[31-Mar-19 08:17 PM] CHMEX#0686
oups than I mined 4 hehe

[31-Mar-19 08:17 PM] Strob#3417
How long shouold it take I have been mining since 15 minutes I think

[31-Mar-19 08:18 PM] CHMEX#0686
not so long

[31-Mar-19 08:18 PM] SHossain#0007
monitor debug.log to check

[31-Mar-19 08:18 PM] CHMEX#0686
are you synched?

[31-Mar-19 08:18 PM] Strob#3417
yes

let's see how long does it take to get the first TXSCLCC notarization 😃

[31-Mar-19 08:22 PM] SHossain#0007
didn't increase minsig. still 5

that's normal

[31-Mar-19 08:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
@CHMEX can you add TXSCLCC to notarystats? 😁

[31-Mar-19 08:33 PM] Strob#3417
oups got 350 in one shot

[31-Mar-19 08:34 PM] Strob#3417
Maybe because I just imported my wif

[31-Mar-19 08:34 PM] SHossain#0007
no problem if you mined few blocks

[31-Mar-19 08:35 PM] Strob#3417
Ok that's it it wasd mining to the address linked to my pubkey

[31-Mar-19 08:35 PM] SHossain#0007
i mentioned about only 1 block as it will give you 25 coins which are a lot for notarization

[31-Mar-19 08:35 PM] Strob#3417
Ok thanks!

[31-Mar-19 08:37 PM] Strob#3417
I stopped mininig and restarted iguana

[31-Mar-19 08:39 PM] SHossain#0007
if you followed the guide and improted all privkey before launcing `./m_notary_testnet`, you shouldn't get any error

[31-Mar-19 08:40 PM] jorian#4555
`"ismine":false`

[31-Mar-19 08:40 PM] jorian#4555
that should tell you plenty

[31-Mar-19 08:40 PM] jorian#4555

syncing & mining

[31-Mar-19 08:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
wish i had a faster line on this vps... 100mbps ain't cutting it

[31-Mar-19 08:41 PM] SHossain#0007
syncing and mining at the same time is not recommended

[31-Mar-19 08:41 PM] SHossain#0007
sync first fully, then mine

[31-Mar-19 08:41 PM] SHossain#0007
otherwise, you risk going on into your own fork

[31-Mar-19 08:41 PM] jorian#4555
successive steps

[31-Mar-19 08:42 PM] Strob#3417
I don't gett error but I don't see TXSCLCC in the log

[31-Mar-19 08:42 PM] SHossain#0007

warning, the utxo's you mined cannot be splitted
(you will get some things like ```error signing raw TXSCLCC utxoduplicates tx```)

{Reactions}
👌 

[31-Mar-19 09:06 PM] Strob#3417
o yes spliting!

{Reactions}
🎉 

[31-Mar-19 09:06 PM] metaphilibert#0926
you need to send some funds to yourself to have splittable utxo's

[31-Mar-19 09:17 PM] PHBA2061#2530
is it required to restart iguana before we can split TXSCLCC ?

[31-Mar-19 09:17 PM] metaphilibert#0926
if you updated after @SHossain 's announcement no

[31-Mar-19 09:18 PM] Strob#3417
So I synched TXSCLCC chain (started with my pubkey, imported my wif, mined, resend some funds to myself, splitted the utxo, opened the p2p port for this asset, killed iguana, launched m_notary_testnet and still nothing about TXSCLCC in my log. Am I missing something?

[31-Mar-19 09:19 PM] PHBA2061#2530
because I got this error when trying to split manually with acsplit TXSCLCC 40
{"error":"need active coin","tag":"3666969480328939510"}

[31-Mar-19 09:20 PM] SHossain#0007

ah means the first newly added line is not in m_notary_tesnet, you need to git pull

[31-Mar-19 09:21 PM] SHossain#0007
`git pull` is there https://github.com/Alrighttt/2019NNtestnet/blob/master/iguana/m_notary_testnet#L4

but, if that didn't work manually calling `git pull` needed

[31-Mar-19 09:22 PM] Strob#3417
I got 4 files changes 13 insertion 7 deletion

[31-Mar-19 09:24 PM] SHossain#0007
only thinkg i didn't add is `,\"sapling\":1` for TXSCLCC chain. adding now.  but, this shouldn't create any issue

[31-Mar-19 09:25 PM] Alright#0419
just use the one komodod generates

[31-Mar-19 09:25 PM] SHossain#0007
yay...you are back

[31-Mar-19 09:26 PM] SHossain#0007
i added that manually now

[31-Mar-19 09:26 PM] Alright#0419
when you start the chain it will create TXSCLCC_7776 file in same dir as komodod
