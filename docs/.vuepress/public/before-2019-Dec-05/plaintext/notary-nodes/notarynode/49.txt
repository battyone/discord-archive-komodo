way cheaper that way lol

[26-Mar-19 03:39 AM] Alright#0419
testnet participants, for now you can just sync KMD PIZZA and BEER to prep. Going to take a day or two to get this together I imagine

[26-Mar-19 03:40 AM] Alright#0419
Also, the pubkey you're submitting to me should not be the one you plan to use for mainnet

[26-Mar-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah im not even generating it ...

[26-Mar-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just made one for vote... pretty sure mainnet one can be don after election like last year

[26-Mar-19 03:43 AM] Mylo#8306
@Alright do you want to have a testnet ANN published?

[26-Mar-19 03:43 AM] Mylo#8306
to that effect

[26-Mar-19 03:43 AM] Alright#0419
After initial repo is setup please

[26-Mar-19 03:43 AM] Mylo#8306
ok

[26-Mar-19 03:44 AM] PTYX#6840
publish it with a guide 🙂

[26-Mar-19 03:44 AM] Alright#0419
What's the fun in that

[26-Mar-19 03:44 AM] PTYX#6840
we're not all notary savants

[26-Mar-19 03:45 AM] Alright#0419
I've never ran a mainnet notary, and I'm setting up a testnet for them 😐

[26-Mar-19 03:45 AM] Alright#0419
if I can setup a testnet, you can figure out how to setup the notary 😛

something like that

[26-Mar-19 03:47 AM] Alright#0419
Oh definitely not

[26-Mar-19 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that will get you close but the repos are wrong

[26-Mar-19 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
change the git repo to the right one

[26-Mar-19 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then run them and yeah... finished

[26-Mar-19 03:47 AM] Mylo#8306
yep, cool.

[26-Mar-19 03:48 AM] Alright#0419
We could script *all of it* so it's as simple as `./start.sh` or we can teach people what's actually going on

[26-Mar-19 03:48 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah the guide is written in a way to teach

[26-Mar-19 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
start.sh is no good for learning until it breaks

[26-Mar-19 03:48 AM] Mylo#8306
the old guide

[26-Mar-19 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think just reading those scripts  rather than runnign them is litterally ALL the info you need

[26-Mar-19 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
everything else in the guide is wrong outdated or not releavet

[26-Mar-19 03:49 AM] Mylo#8306
lol - like i read validation code.... nah you need to do it a cpl times to know what's going on, the order of things that happens

[26-Mar-19 03:50 AM] Mylo#8306
i can read validation code ok, can't write it yet though

[26-Mar-19 03:50 AM] Mylo#8306
ok = 6/10

[26-Mar-19 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
kind of... 
make sure .conf diles ahve write things
make a pirvate key for KMD
make wp_7776 file with KMD WIF in it 
start KMD
start PIZZA and BEER 
import wif to those
fund chains
start iguana
splitfund 
call dpowassets for BEER/PIZZA

[26-Mar-19 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
litterally all it is

[26-Mar-19 03:52 AM] Mylo#8306
nice.

[26-Mar-19 03:53 AM] kolo#1111
I think it’s there by a marketing team mistake. One can run only for 1 node in each region

[26-Mar-19 03:54 AM] kolo#1111
Please, check that it will be fixed ASAP. Probably I had to doublecheck that texts more carefully

[26-Mar-19 03:54 AM] kolo#1111
Sorry

[26-Mar-19 03:55 AM] Mylo#8306
i will remove and an edit will come later today

testnet good to go it seems, just need to force blocks on BEER and PIZZA and get a readme up

[26-Mar-19 07:26 AM] SHossain#0007

Create a file named passphrease.txt at ~/2019NNtestnet/iguana/pubkey.txt. Contents should be

passphrease.txt   > passphrase.txt  little typo

minsigs 2?

[26-Mar-19 07:54 AM] jorian#4555
i'm not sure, but i think we need to crank that up if many are to participate

[26-Mar-19 07:54 AM] Alright#0419
there are only 5 keys right now

[26-Mar-19 07:55 AM] Alright#0419
we're going to do pubkeys/2

[26-Mar-19 07:55 AM] Alright#0419
when we hit 6 keys, up to to 3

[26-Mar-19 07:55 AM] Alright#0419
8 keys, up to 4

[26-Mar-19 07:55 AM] jorian#4555
and everyone needs to update

[26-Mar-19 07:55 AM] Alright#0419
and so on

[26-Mar-19 07:55 AM] Alright#0419
need to update anyway when we add keys

[26-Mar-19 07:56 AM] SHossain#0007
not ideal to update again and again. set to 5 or 6 for now and then update in a slower frequency i would say

[26-Mar-19 07:56 AM] jorian#4555
yeah but we need to update anyways

[26-Mar-19 07:56 AM] jorian#4555
alright has a point

[26-Mar-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to restart every time a pubkey is added

[26-Mar-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so do it the way he done it

[26-Mar-19 07:57 AM] SHossain#0007
true...forgot that part :abused_smiley:

[26-Mar-19 08:00 AM] Alright#0419
I'll batch the PRs together so it's only like 1 update/day

[26-Mar-19 08:01 AM] SHossain#0007
great

[26-Mar-19 08:20 AM] Mylo#8306
you reckon 8GB RAM will be enough for testnet?

[26-Mar-19 08:20 AM] jorian#4555
my node is doing < 4GB on testnet

[26-Mar-19 08:21 AM] jorian#4555
and that's not even with jok3rs superduper iguana

[26-Mar-19 08:21 AM] Mylo#8306
how do you build kmd on <4GB ram?

[26-Mar-19 08:21 AM] jorian#4555
swap

[26-Mar-19 08:21 AM] jorian#4555
and my node is not < 4GB

[26-Mar-19 08:21 AM] Mylo#8306
even then i struggle

[26-Mar-19 08:21 AM] Mylo#8306
oh....

[26-Mar-19 08:21 AM] jorian#4555
it's running at < 4GB

[26-Mar-19 08:21 AM] Mylo#8306
i'm gonna set up a VPS on KVM with 8GB RAM

[26-Mar-19 08:21 AM] jorian#4555
plenty

[26-Mar-19 08:22 AM] Mylo#8306
6?

[26-Mar-19 08:22 AM] Mylo#8306
i wanna go lean

[26-Mar-19 08:22 AM] Mylo#8306
