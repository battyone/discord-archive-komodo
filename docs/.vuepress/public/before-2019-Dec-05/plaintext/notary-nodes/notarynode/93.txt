so if a newcomer to the ecosystem can convince just a single NN that their idea is worth supporting, it gets supported and a chance to become real

[06-Apr-19 08:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That's what I thought you meant, but just wanted to be sure.

[06-Apr-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the excess NN profits are thus designed to be a decentralization of ecosystem project management

[06-Apr-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
this doesnt work so well at near the 50 cents price

[06-Apr-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
at the $5+ price I think it can start having some real effect and at $50+, then it can be a very powerful 64 stroke engine

[06-Apr-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
yes that is $4 mil per month for the ecosystem at the $50 price

[06-Apr-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and the logic is that any NN that manages to be in the elected position has earned the right to allocate those funds

Could sure use some translations over here.  
Like the idea for a general bounty fund.
I pledged donations to Labs.  A good cause to support KMD and all ecosystem. 
Figure that's a better first step.  Will come up with translation funds another way.

[06-Apr-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you are currently a naughty candidate, I highly suggest you change your allocation of funds

[06-Apr-19 08:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's not as narcissistic as it sounds, but I want to kick a %age for devs so that the next me can be me
I got a lot from the platform and the community, and want the next hungry soul to be able to do the same

@CrisF I'm kicking  a bit towards translations to make up for my inability to speak more than one coherently.

having a fund dedicated to supporting just one dev, that is a very good idea

[06-Apr-19 08:56 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll donate/find some some of my own no doubt, but for the pledge want to keep it simple.

[06-Apr-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
as just one very good dev can make a big difference, so freeing them from their fiat shackles is always a good usage of funds

Yes, that is good 😃

[06-Apr-19 08:59 AM] CrisF#3405
It would work towards seeing projects to completion.

[06-Apr-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
and if that dev happens to be yourself, that is ok too. just disclose it

[06-Apr-19 09:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
pirates will support labs & verus through direct %age and bounties if they have projects that will align with piratechain's & kmd's ecosystem

[06-Apr-19 09:07 AM] mrlynch#5735
and supporting 1 dev so far (me) to further zcommerce adoption - will need it as i'll be working on it full time 😬 :abusedsmily:

[06-Apr-19 09:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_can't imagine labs having a project that doesn't 'align with kmd's ecosystem' :P_

i really cant believe bittrex IEOed a project that is closed source. they used to be much more sane. i guess the bittrex owner having a big giant amount of VBK had something to do with it

[06-Apr-19 09:10 AM] Alright#0419
miners still haven't had their chance to trade yet last time I checked

[06-Apr-19 09:10 AM] Alright#0419

[06-Apr-19 09:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
given their collective backgrounds, I can't see where open/closed would matter to them

[06-Apr-19 09:11 AM] mrlynch#5735
or most likely received a big kickback

[06-Apr-19 09:11 AM] mrlynch#5735
```can't imagine labs having a project that doesn't 'align with kmd's ecosystem' :P```
it's up for the grabs is all i'm saying.. if you need it, we'll have some funds

Damn HempCoin biggest gainer on bittrex atm 😄

[06-Apr-19 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
17% 😮

[06-Apr-19 09:12 AM] mrlynch#5735
we'll retain 20% of rewards and 50% of big blocks, the rest goes back into the ecosystem as that seems the best ROI - long term investment..

[06-Apr-19 09:14 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll give it some thought, @mrlynch  😃

[06-Apr-19 09:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`long term`
So, no 200x tomorrow? 😭

_is the silliest fek you know_

[06-Apr-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
the likelihood of big blocks goes down everyday as now only max of one month worth

[06-Apr-19 09:16 AM] Alright#0419
@mrlynch we won't necessarily be clamoring for funds, but the plan is to just let the warchest grow. We're trying to accomplish what KMD did with it's ICO, fund notarizations for years and years

[06-Apr-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
so the funds sitting long term on exchanges dilutes relative to active users, which is as it should be

[06-Apr-19 09:17 AM] mrlynch#5735
the Pirate dev fund will be open for any project that can contribute to PirateChain.. given that we're part of KMD ecosystem opens up a lot more possibilities

[06-Apr-19 09:17 AM] mrlynch#5735
we still put it in black & white regardless of big block ocurrence %

[06-Apr-19 09:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the likelihood of big blocks goes down everyday as now only max of one month worth`
I'm kinda surprised that there are as many as there are, myself

Iguana broadcasts all IPS, the issue was from an old bug when the array of IPS was only 64 and it would fill up with IPS that can't be reached

[06-Apr-19 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If u change IP and add like 4 g or 5 good nodes it connects to all with open port anyway

I don't totally agree about your opinion about buying, selling votes

[06-Apr-19 09:49 AM] Ludom#5832
@jl777c

[06-Apr-19 09:49 AM] Ludom#5832
I don't use this solution but I can understand why some people propose that

[06-Apr-19 09:49 AM] Ludom#5832
The goal from my opinion is that we need to involve people to participate to the annually vote

[06-Apr-19 09:50 AM] Ludom#5832
And selling vote is a way to participate

[06-Apr-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just my opinion, all KMD holders can make their own decision about what is important

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 what simple if statement?

[06-Apr-19 09:53 AM] Ludom#5832
The professionnalisation of notarisation

[06-Apr-19 09:54 AM] Mylo#8306
`if (./something.img)` replace the URL?    because when that doesn't work, someone will complain - so instead, use absolute urls that you can control and i don't have to mangle.

[06-Apr-19 09:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes that

[06-Apr-19 09:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If it doesn't work, then make kolo undo whatever he moves around 😛

[06-Apr-19 09:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the entire point of having it in that repo is so that it's there

[06-Apr-19 09:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
otherwise, I have a repo for 1 image 😕

[06-Apr-19 09:58 AM] Mylo#8306
yes - but if statement`<img src="./genie.jpg">` and another else if `(./sample.jpg)` for someone using markdown.
you can keep the image in your repo with the proposal.   just needs the absolute url to the image and it works wherever.

[06-Apr-19 09:58 AM] Mylo#8306
then the if statements when someone else does something with their gpg key, or gets clever and makes a subdir for images because they come from webdev background - .... just use absolute urls and wherever the link goes it will work.

[06-Apr-19 09:59 AM] Mylo#8306
then i become a maintainer of an if statement.   when if nn ops just used absolute urls, nothing breaks

[06-Apr-19 10:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you can keep the image in your repo with the proposal. `
you're still missing the point
my repo was purely for the intent of creating a PR to the "main" repo
with what you want to do now with your PR to my PR, I now have to keep an otherwise useless repo for the sole purpose of hosting a single image
`then i become a maintainer of an if statement. `
Why do I need to be the maintainer of your project?

[06-Apr-19 10:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can link it to the dir in KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes, but that's not what your PR asked for
do you see my point?

[06-Apr-19 10:04 AM] Mylo#8306
oh i see.   yes, sorry.   i was just trying to help by doing it.   but you don't have to merge my PR.  just do it yourself?   does that resolve the misunderstanding?

[06-Apr-19 10:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

as long as it works, there shouldn't be any issue unless you have some wild edits that slow it down

Apart from the `net.cpp` hack, no edits.
