what are these "underwear" things you speak of?

[31-Mar-19 11:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, I'm not liking this TXSCLCC thing, 0 notarizations since I split it 😦

[31-Mar-19 11:12 PM] Alright#0419
so `Last BR:7    Last PZ: 2144` seems normal enough?

[31-Mar-19 11:12 PM] Alright#0419
seems really weird that I have consistent BEER notarizations but absolutely no PIZZA

[31-Mar-19 11:15 PM] metaphilibert#0926
in general, it is better to not watch it too closely and let it happen (like waiting for water to boil)

[31-Mar-19 11:15 PM] metaphilibert#0926
but here the difference is clearly not normal @Alright

[31-Mar-19 11:18 PM] Alright#0419
ok and nulled mom data is normal as well? Still getting this. Would like to understand what it means and why it happens

[31-Mar-19 11:19 PM] metaphilibert#0926
be sure your chains are well (enough utxo's)
then restart iguana

[31-Mar-19 11:19 PM] metaphilibert#0926
pkill -15 iguana
and relaunch m_notary_tesnet

[31-Mar-19 11:22 PM] metaphilibert#0926
2144? 35h+ without notarisation

[31-Mar-19 11:23 PM] metaphilibert#0926
seems more related to your PIZZA chain

[31-Mar-19 11:25 PM] metaphilibert#0926
either there is no enough utxo, either iguana is not communicating well with komodod

[31-Mar-19 11:25 PM] Alright#0419
yep, can't figure it out

[31-Mar-19 11:25 PM] Alright#0419
seems the same as BEER

[31-Mar-19 11:27 PM] PHBA2061#2530
my node doesn't seem to like PIZZA neither 😕

[31-Mar-19 11:29 PM] metaphilibert#0926
what does ```komodo-cli -ac_name=PIZZA listunspent | grep 0.00010000 | wc``` returns @Alright ?

[31-Mar-19 11:31 PM] Alright#0419
15 30 390

[31-Mar-19 11:31 PM] Alright#0419
what is piping to wc doing?

[31-Mar-19 11:31 PM] Alright#0419
what is the 390 number?

[31-Mar-19 11:31 PM] PHBA2061#2530
lines | words  | characters, I just google it out 😂

[31-Mar-19 11:32 PM] metaphilibert#0926
first column is the number of lines, here number of utxo's of 0.00010000

[31-Mar-19 11:32 PM] metaphilibert#0926
other columns, don't ask

[31-Mar-19 11:32 PM] metaphilibert#0926
i don't know

[31-Mar-19 11:32 PM] SHossain#0007

[31-Mar-19 11:33 PM] metaphilibert#0926
so you have enough utxo

btw "wc" stands for word count , not the other thing

and copy them on a separate script to launch them after

[31-Mar-19 11:38 PM] metaphilibert#0926
it will delay the launch of dpow

[31-Mar-19 11:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[31-Mar-19 11:39 PM] metaphilibert#0926
and maybe more easy to see in iguanaTV if all the 3 assetchains are well added

[31-Mar-19 11:41 PM] metaphilibert#0926
before launching dpow, iguanaTV is quite still

[31-Mar-19 11:41 PM] metaphilibert#0926

I was waiting that the notarization of the third assetchain works on my side, can you confirm that it works fine ?

if you love it, then why use 3 apps instead of 2? :troll:

technically 6, but we can ignore daemon, bash, and terminal 😛

[31-Mar-19 11:45 PM] metaphilibert#0926
@phm87 this is the destination address of the notarisations, http://txsclcc.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RXL3YXG2ceaB6C5hfJcN4fvmLH2C34knhA
you can check if your address was included there or better with komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC listtransactions

with wallet size

[31-Mar-19 11:51 PM] metaphilibert#0926
because size matters

[31-Mar-19 11:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not really, because clean keeps the same size (iirc, joker said it pads the cleaned)

[31-Mar-19 11:52 PM] SHossain#0007
_size does matter, after all_

[31-Mar-19 11:55 PM] metaphilibert#0926
i don't use walletcleaning (yet), i do it mostly manually
it warned me a few times when i forgot to "clean" some old AC
for KMD not relevant as you need to clean it every 5 days or so

[31-Mar-19 11:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
cleaner has been the best new tool for my pool

[31-Mar-19 11:56 PM] metaphilibert#0926
that i can understand

[31-Mar-19 11:57 PM] SHossain#0007
i have not used that either yet

[31-Mar-19 11:57 PM] SHossain#0007
need to try that sometimes

[31-Mar-19 11:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
takes 60k txes out of my main wallet

[01-Apr-19 12:02 AM] metaphilibert#0926
the only advantage i see is that you don't have to restart the daemon (and it may be a critical advantage, i agree)
the manual method is
-stop iguana
-wait latest tx confirmed on komodod
-unlock eventual locked utxos
-send all your balance elsewhere
-stop komodod
-delete wallet.dat
-restart komodod
-importprivkey Uxxxxx "" false
-restart iguana
-send 10 KMD back to your address
-wait for split to confirm and launch dpow

[01-Apr-19 12:02 AM] metaphilibert#0926
🤔 and yet i prefer to do it manually

{Reactions}

[01-Apr-19 12:03 AM] SHossain#0007
that's a lot of steps

[01-Apr-19 12:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
woke up, updated, restarted, waiting for ntx 💤

[01-Apr-19 12:05 AM] metaphilibert#0926
anyway, not needed here as 3 chains notarizing for 1.5 months

[01-Apr-19 12:05 AM] metaphilibert#0926
not enough to bloat the wallet a lot

[01-Apr-19 12:05 AM] metaphilibert#0926
i think

[01-Apr-19 12:06 AM] metaphilibert#0926
quite tired by the way,wish you a good night mates

[01-Apr-19 12:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or, just don't use the same wallet you use for 60k other things 😛

[01-Apr-19 12:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in some ways, the day you made that for sapling feels like yesterday and in others it feels like 30 years ago

[01-Apr-19 12:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  null MoMoM data is a flatout bug.

[01-Apr-19 12:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We had to fix that with labs. Its the reason for broken migrates

[01-Apr-19 12:31 AM] Alright#0419
wat do

[01-Apr-19 12:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It shouldn't stay like that. If the chain is being notarized with momom and your node is showing 0s then u won't be able to notarize it. I think it happens because there is no chains in it's cluster on the same notaries.

[01-Apr-19 12:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Basically it has no other mom hash to use... Labs we use a range of 7... So its always notarizong a bunch of its own mom hash all the time so its never null

[01-Apr-19 01:33 AM] Strob#3417
Hey what's happening, since I added TXSCLCC I did only one notarization for it and then nothing, no PIZZA nor BEER either since 3 hours...

[01-Apr-19 01:34 AM] Strob#3417
My utxos are ok

[01-Apr-19 01:34 AM] Strob#3417
Maybe not related buy how can I check the peers?

[01-Apr-19 01:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I just noticed PIZZA no ntx for 2hrs due to relaunching with bad params. Fixing with `-reindex`. @Strob  not sure thats your issue, but doesnt take long to launch with reindex on these chains (not KMD)

[01-Apr-19 01:45 AM] Strob#3417
ok thanks @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  I will try that

[01-Apr-19 02:03 AM] Strob#3417
I restarted everything and while pulling it says 1 file changed... so I guess I didn't have latest version
