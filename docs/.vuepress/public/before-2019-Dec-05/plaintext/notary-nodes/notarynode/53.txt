thinking outside the box comes by default that way too lol

[28-Mar-19 03:23 AM] Alright#0419
if you don't know what an error or print means, use grep to find it in the code and look at the condition in which it should be printed

[28-Mar-19 04:20 AM] Strob#3417
O noticed that notarization is not using much cpu, only 1 of my 32 core is used at around 60%. so it's not multithreaded. Isn't there a way to run multiple instances to make it use all the cores?

[28-Mar-19 04:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its is multi threaded

[28-Mar-19 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it just doesnt use CPU at all

[28-Mar-19 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you only need lots of CPU to sync all the chains

[28-Mar-19 12:08 PM] CHMEX#0686
does somebody know in which interval iguana tries to connect to other notaries? Does method addnotary force a connection attempt?

[28-Mar-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not really.

[28-Mar-19 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once it has the addnotary call nanomsg will flood SYN packet to connect every few mili seconds or something

[28-Mar-19 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
even if the other IP isnt reachable it will just keep trying to conenct really fast

[28-Mar-19 12:42 PM] CHMEX#0686
nice thanks

[28-Mar-19 02:53 PM] Strob#3417
I also installed all the assets chains and it gives me 22GB free out of 404GB. I need to upgrade my hard drive.

[28-Mar-19 03:02 PM] Strob#3417
Strange I had to restart iguana 2 times before it could see  the 2 new notaries

[28-Mar-19 03:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
isn't this testnet only notarizing beer & pizza?

[28-Mar-19 03:06 PM] taurados#4043
Added my commit again

[28-Mar-19 03:08 PM] zatJUM#9924
In case anyone asks: beer and pizza still don't sync, and I can't work on it for now... Perhaps in a few hours, on my phone 😒

[28-Mar-19 03:08 PM] CHMEX#0686
But a good idea is to once synch all chains including btc just to get an idea

[28-Mar-19 03:17 PM] Strob#3417
@mrlynch Yes exactly but I installed everything first (before the testnet) just to see how it works.

[28-Mar-19 03:18 PM] Strob#3417
For bitcoin I let it sync cause I couldn't find a trustable bootstrap file but for all the others I used the bootstraps.

[28-Mar-19 03:50 PM] CHMEX#0686
Did all the bootstraps for assetchains work properly?

[28-Mar-19 04:08 PM] Alright#0419
I'll be throwing some random chains at you guys if we have a day with no new participants 😛

[28-Mar-19 04:08 PM] Alright#0419
so don't assume it's just beer and pizza

@Alright can you automate hardforks on testnet, change port number?

[28-Mar-19 06:45 PM] Mylo#8306
etc.

[28-Mar-19 07:02 PM] Alright#0419
@Mylo you just want to hardfork an assetchain?

[28-Mar-19 07:04 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah, no need to do iguana sorry, only AC. say every tues & fri thru april?

[28-Mar-19 07:05 PM] Mylo#8306
with customcc maybe easier.

[28-Mar-19 07:07 PM] Mylo#8306
maybe april 10-30.  i won't have tested a customcc to do it by tuesday.   and existing notaries can have a turn each of changing consensus...?

[28-Mar-19 07:07 PM] Alright#0419
we could make it a cluster and call it CFEK :troll:

[28-Mar-19 07:08 PM] Alright#0419
but yes, we can try something like this, not quite sure what it accomplishes to do it on a regular schedule

[28-Mar-19 07:08 PM] Alright#0419
once you've done it once, you know how to do it

[28-Mar-19 07:09 PM] Mylo#8306
ok maybe only once per week for the 3 weeks.   there'll be late entry testnet candidates

Since we are 11 NN should I try to keep my utxos at 20 or more?

[29-Mar-19 07:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD utxo should be 25-50, if yo have a very fast server you can probably use 50-100, Assetchain I use 5-10 lol but once gain the fster you server the more you can use.

[29-Mar-19 07:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The testnet I just manually split 500 KMD and 200 AC and dont eve have a script to chek them set up 😂

[29-Mar-19 08:02 AM] Mylo#8306
This is a performance tuning exercise.  Some ppl do it, some don't.  Obv YMMV depending on whether you do it, method you do it and there are different variables for different ppl that they need to tune, e.g. location of server, speed of server, number of UTXOs already in wallet etc.

[29-Mar-19 08:03 AM] Mylo#8306
There is no wrong/right way, it's your node.  You're just competing with the other nodes to be included in the sortition.

[29-Mar-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Why not learn how to do it properly the first time, but yes, own experimentation will be the best thing to do in the long run

[29-Mar-19 09:12 AM] Mylo#8306
because i like to sleep 😃  so anything below 50 UTXOs gets a refill!

{Reactions}
💯 

[29-Mar-19 12:11 PM] Strob#3417
Thanks for your advices guys! I set iguana to not split automatically and I setup a cron job to refill my utxo only when needed but my KMD utxo are increasing by themselves... I wonder why. I also tried to consolidate my kmd utxo by sending all to another adress and then back to my notary kmd address but the utxo came back...

[29-Mar-19 12:29 PM] Strob#3417
Is this the correct way to stop iguana from spliting: "../agents/iguana testnet notary_nosplit"

[29-Mar-19 01:20 PM] Strob#3417
It doesn't work in fact. even when adding the notary_nosplit iguana is splitting KMD

[29-Mar-19 01:21 PM] Strob#3417
If I put the notary_nosplit before testnet then it doesn't start the test net, but tries to start the real net.

[29-Mar-19 01:42 PM] Strob#3417
On start iguana is creating 256 utxo, a few minutes later it adds another 256 for a total of 512.... How can I stop that please?

[29-Mar-19 02:13 PM] metaphilibert#0926

```./iguana testnet "" notary_nosplit```

[29-Mar-19 02:16 PM] Strob#3417
Cain I use z_mergetoaddress to consolidate my utxos?

[29-Mar-19 02:23 PM] metaphilibert#0926
You can also ```komodo-cli sendtoaddress Ryouraddress yourfullbalance "" "" true```

[29-Mar-19 02:25 PM] metaphilibert#0926
This will send your entire balance to yourself, and the "" "" true is to substarct the fee from the amount

[29-Mar-19 02:25 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Anyway z_mergetoaddress should also do the trick

[29-Mar-19 02:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
if you want to start back with a very clean wallet : your objective is to reduce those utxos to 1, then adopt a splitting strategy

[29-Mar-19 02:52 PM] Strob#3417
./iguana testnet "" notary_nosplit is not working either, iguana is still splitting...

[29-Mar-19 02:53 PM] SHossain#0007
don't worry about splitting

[29-Mar-19 02:53 PM] SHossain#0007
~700 utxos for KMD is normal in mainnet
