@mrlynch got tad more power here. "to support decentralization" by doing this from home.

[14-May-19 04:41 PM] PHBA2061#2530
np it's no big deal, strange that no one spotted that, James were asking who out of the elected NN pledged for CHIPS so I made a list based on the proposals & that's why I spotted that 😂

`not sure i'm tracking` @mrlynch it was a reply for renting 8gig, 2-core VPS. i'd rather toy and poke it from home

[14-May-19 05:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
aah.. ok .. cool

[14-May-19 05:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
even better 😃 be advised that you need a good line though

you'll find that it's very easy to work with json as well.. Marshal from structs of structs, maps, etc; Unmarshal from json - do magic

[14-May-19 09:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There's another way to do JSON besides jq? 😮

[14-May-19 09:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
yup

[14-May-19 09:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
i've done the ip thing yesterday in go

[14-May-19 09:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
spits out a nice lil json

[15-May-19 11:05 AM] mrlynch#5735
```ping -c 4 ip |tail -1 | awk -F "/" "{print $5}"```

[15-May-19 11:07 AM] mrlynch#5735
and the source is from ```curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776/" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"ipaddrs\"}" | jq -r '.[]'```

[15-May-19 11:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
ya, I did a bit of peek and poke because at first I set it up on oracle.earth server, which wasnt running iguana, and once it was, it wasnt testnet iguana 😄

[15-May-19 11:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
was gettting `null` in console as output

[15-May-19 11:22 AM] mrlynch#5735
i have yet to put meaningful messages or a readme.. was just something to take my mind off the end of the election 😁

may be swapping the 2 axes to make it easier to read ? 😂

[15-May-19 01:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
nice! now match the ip's to the nn name from testnet.json 😁

[15-May-19 01:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
and then on that graph, add my pings as well

[15-May-19 01:36 PM] Strob#3417
I matched each ip to a city but not all the names yet. anyone did it?

[15-May-19 01:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
as soon as @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator moves his server i'll code the post curl so that the json is automagically sent to be collated

[15-May-19 01:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'll add the testnet.json nn names as well so that we have nn_name; ip; avgping

[15-May-19 01:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
soon though as i'm wrapped up in smth else rn

[15-May-19 01:40 PM] Strob#3417
but in the testnet.json each name is just associated to the pubkeys not the ip

[15-May-19 01:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'll extract from m_notary_testnet

[15-May-19 01:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
we need to find out if ping really matters.. @CHMEX where/how do u get the last 24h ntx data from? i'd like to add that to the json as well for each nn

[15-May-19 01:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
although not sure if it REALLY matters as there are so many other factors involved

[15-May-19 01:46 PM] CHMEX#0686
Storing each transaction with a timestamp I can build you a json to consume

[15-May-19 01:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
that would be awesome

[15-May-19 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`we need to find out if ping really matters..`
Yes and no, the ping itself is more like a "symptom" of the larger connectivity "illness"

[15-May-19 01:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
nn_name: 
last24h:

[15-May-19 01:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
the app is pinging ip's from iguana conns

[15-May-19 01:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
if there are no conns the json is null

added origin to json and check to not ping self

[15-May-19 05:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
not sure if i can match nn name to ip

[15-May-19 05:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
shouldnt really need to do that. Alrhough there is a way to get that.

[15-May-19 05:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its not that easy.

[15-May-19 05:16 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'm actually thinking that we don't need the nn names, just the ip.. was looking to add ntx so that would've been a nice touch

[15-May-19 05:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can match the notartizations with nodes by getting address.

[15-May-19 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but IP -> node you need to make a patched iguana that prints the ip of a node. and edit source and rebuild 64 times, one for each node 😂

[15-May-19 05:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
yeah.. how 'bout no

[15-May-19 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we did it alst year, thats how webs map works. I think he automated it.

[15-May-19 05:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for this we dont need it though.

[15-May-19 05:18 PM] mrlynch#5735
nope

[15-May-19 05:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
match name with average ping time, and a notarization count.

[15-May-19 05:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if the higher nota counts correlate with lower average ping, then we have answer

[15-May-19 05:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
really it will take manyweeks to knw for 100% sure. unless its a very obvious advantage rightaway

[15-May-19 05:19 PM] mrlynch#5735
so you mean add average of nodes[avgping] and nota count from each node?

[15-May-19 05:20 PM] mrlynch#5735
that i can do

[15-May-19 05:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this JSON is the pints FROM 1 node to all right?

[15-May-19 05:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what I mean, is average all the pings that respond

[15-May-19 05:20 PM] mrlynch#5735
i get what u say.. i don't think it matters tbf as there are so many factors going into nota counts

[15-May-19 05:20 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes.. 1 node to all - avg ping to each of all

[15-May-19 05:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and that number is for the node who rant he script, than add notarization count to this

[15-May-19 05:20 PM] mrlynch#5735
but i can add an avg of averages 😂

[15-May-19 05:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes, we saying the same thing 🤣

[15-May-19 05:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. that is what i was thinking. yeah sorry man, im tired
