not really critical as the other notaries provide the redundancy

[24-May-19 04:39 PM] phm87#7395
I don t like softraid so I did not plan to use it. Ppl adviced me to have one main NN server and a second with the same nodes to perform some maintenance (I have similar setup for testnet).
Thank you jl777c

[24-May-19 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im usingf ZFS at home... it is indeed great.

[24-May-19 04:43 PM] phm87#7395
We are using zfs also but I don t remember where (We are a team and I don t manage infra things.)

[24-May-19 04:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
you cant use softraid on esxi

[24-May-19 04:46 PM] phm87#7395
About the private high speed connection (vrack at ovh), the option was free on nearly all my ovh servers (100mbps is free) so all NN running on ovh (recent servers) may have this option

[24-May-19 04:46 PM] phm87#7395
@Deleted User we discussed it: some non standard weird tricks need to be done and 99% of tutorials on it are wrong

[24-May-19 04:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
using a bare faking  an esxi encapsuled works but direct esxi check your drive

[24-May-19 04:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
you ll see only 1 is used

[24-May-19 04:48 PM] phm87#7395
We checked it

[24-May-19 04:48 PM] phm87#7395
Then we understood that we were wrong one year ago or more

[24-May-19 04:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I di€ the same error then switched to prox

[24-May-19 04:49 PM] phm87#7395
My friend was so surprised of this that he simulate hard drive crash ...

[24-May-19 04:49 PM] phm87#7395
Because with 99% of tutorials it does not work

[24-May-19 04:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
fzilover is easy either by netplan or interfaces

[24-May-19 04:50 PM] phm87#7395
Then he did some tricks until it works

[24-May-19 04:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
then he can be a millionnaire sharing a tweak

[24-May-19 04:51 PM] phm87#7395
I don t know infra tricks by hearth (as I don t manage most of infra things)

[24-May-19 04:51 PM] phm87#7395
The tweak is public but 99% of tutos are wrong

[24-May-19 04:52 PM] phm87#7395
Maybe I misunderstand but I think that you know the trick (whatever 99% of tutos are wrong)

[24-May-19 04:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes but too risky

[24-May-19 04:52 PM] phm87#7395
Ok

[24-May-19 04:53 PM] phm87#7395
Maybe it is not the same trick. I don t know

[24-May-19 04:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don t play with that as it is not intended to. maybr newer are ok but 6and 6.5 is a pain

[24-May-19 04:53 PM] phm87#7395
We had too much issues with 6 and 6.5 ... I should check but I think we are still using 5.5

[24-May-19 04:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
hehe

[24-May-19 04:54 PM] phm87#7395
What version did you use ?

[24-May-19 04:54 PM] phm87#7395
(Maybe my friend updated all esxi without telling me : I don t say anything when I resync a coin)

[24-May-19 08:38 PM] kolo#1111
@Notary-Operator Dear NEW notaries! Welcome to the amazing world of Iguana TV! It's time to enter this world as a main characters. Please, send me in DM your two final pubkeys for the komodod and iguana.
One pubkey should be generated by iguana ("btcpubkey" field in iguana encryptwallet method output) as written in manual. It will be used for dpowing komodo to BTC and all assets into komodo. It's your main pubkey.
Second pubkey will be used for 3rd party coins notarizing. It should be generated same way as above, but with different passphrase.

You all know the safety rules, but I would like to remind:
1. Keep both passphrases (seeds) SAFE. It's main thing from which all your wallets, keys etc are generated deterministically. Knowing seed/passphrase means knowing all BTC, KMD and other privkeys.
2. Keep it really SAFE. Compromising your passphrase (as well as privkey) means your notary is done once and forever. We can't (100%!) revoke, recover, change or tweak pubkeys in komodod once they are hardforked in.
3. Make sure they are correct. As said above - we can't fix them or change later. It's blockchain. 

We already had notary ops lost everything because accidentally sending privkey to public chat or because evernote hacked. They just lost their spot and network got couple of dead servers.

Deadline is one week.

@NutellaLicka Try installing php7.2-gmp php7.2-cli and php7.2-mbstring

[25-May-19 06:49 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I had to follow the instructions in that tutorial. I needed to add the repo

[25-May-19 06:49 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Worked fine after that

[25-May-19 06:50 AM] zatJUM#9924
```One pubkey should be generated by iguana ("btcpubkey" field in iguana encryptwallet method output) as written in manual```
Is it ok to use method described in https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Documentation/blob/master/docs/notary/generate-privkeys-third-party-coins-from-passphrase.md instead of iguana, as mentionned by kolo?

don't try to install only `php7` or `php7.2`. this may install extra modules like Apache2

@NutellaLicka On Ubuntu 16.04 try to use 7.0 instead of 7.2 ...

[25-May-19 12:17 PM] Decker#3767
Use this instruction https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo_scripts#how-to-install-and-use-genkomodophp , but just change `7.2` -> `7.0` ...

Yeah okay, I should've done that. I installed 7.2 with the instructions above

[25-May-19 01:52 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I misunderstood the requirements, disregard

@NutellaLicka if you have done it differently, please post the steps as detailed as possible, i can add that to the guide.

[25-May-19 03:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_had to do:_
```sudo apt install ca-certificates apt-transport-https
wget -q https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ stretch main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list

I installed 7.2 using the steps in  https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-php-7-2-ubuntu-16-04/

[25-May-19 03:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the main thing is that, whatever flavor you have, if there isn't an "official" package then you need to find a trusted source and add that source to your list before installing

[25-May-19 03:07 PM] SHossain#0007
i agree with @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[25-May-19 03:07 PM] SHossain#0007
there are always version dependent packages

[25-May-19 03:58 PM] Mylo#8306
probably worth compiling your own php.   some dependency dev libraries and php `./configure --with-gmp --with-abc --with-xyz`

[25-May-19 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Not sure why there was a 12 KMD block reward.`
because the 1st tx didn't take their rewards

[25-May-19 08:02 PM] PHBA2061#2530
are these "random rewards" part of Komodo's code ?

[25-May-19 08:05 PM] SHossain#0007
those can be exchange or Ledger users who didn't collect their accrued reward

[25-May-19 08:05 PM] SHossain#0007
non claim rewards end up to miners

[25-May-19 08:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they are only random because people are random
it's part of the code that if you do not collect your reward when you send a transaction then the miner that puts it into a block gets it

[25-May-19 08:12 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I see, interesting, thank you both for the explanation

`fee = sum(inputs) - sum(outputs)` is baked deep into btc protocol

[25-May-19 09:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
true, but it's in the KMD code that allows for interest to be added as a vout that brings the vouts total greater than the vins, no?

[25-May-19 09:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 my equation above is just as valid when fee < 0, and when KMD interest is being given, it's possible to see fee < 0

Hey I just got a TXSCLCC! I tried letting it run for many days but it didn't work. Then I just reinstall the whole node (on another server) and it notarized it right away.

[26-May-19 09:47 AM] PHBA2061#2530
thanks to those who maintain the BEER & PIZZA delivering service, without you = no testnet for testing.

[26-May-19 02:38 PM] Strob#3417
@CrisF  Yes I was pretty sure reinstalling would do it but I tried everything else I could think of before. Only difference in my new reinstall is that I avoided all dead nodes and added just those closest to me (16 closest ones). Before that I was adding all ip in the testnet.json.

[26-May-19 06:43 PM] SHossain#0007
i have to do some maintenance on the BEER & PIZZA tx gen server. took the system offline for that

[27-May-19 07:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Would I be able to assemble a small team that still has testnet nodes? I need to test the kmd hard forking code for assetchains, pirate or a fork or clone of it will b be the best to test with as if the code is broken in any way, the chain will fork or stop being able to be notarized. We don't need a huge number, but I think its important we test this, as I can't test this particular code path with any existing asset chains.

[27-May-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool. I'll work on it tomorow and get something started for testing,. Basically all that will be required is to submit a new pubkey and I will amke a special branch and special chain that hardforks in a few days time. Everyone at that time will need to restart iguana with the new pubkeys active and see if things go smoothly.

[27-May-19 08:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

pubkey will be stored in the software / daemon / github so there your backup for that

[27-May-19 08:18 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
pubkey or privkey?

privkey  either a paperwallet or a couple of USBs in a safe somwhere is prlly a good idea. I've had the privkey for a-team sitting on my desk for this entire year in a USB. 🤣  This year I will be doing that a bit safer lol

[27-May-19 08:28 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Not at all Tony, I think smk was talking about privkey management software?
