did you run it with `./komodod -ac_name=VRSC -ac_algo=verushash -ac_cc=1 -ac_supply=0 -ac_eras=3 -ac_reward=0,38400000000,2400000000 -ac_halving=1,43200,1051920 -ac_decay=100000000,0,0 -ac_end=10080,226080,0 -ac_timelockgte=19200000000 -ac_timeunlockfrom=129600 -ac_timeunlockto=1180800 -ac_veruspos=50 -connect=185.25.48.236 -connect=185.64.105.111 -connect=149.202.84.141 -connect=158.69.118.173 &` ?

[19-Aug-18 02:52 PM] Decker#3767
mean, did you use `-connect` ?

[19-Aug-18 02:52 PM] infotech-al#5583
that is whats in my verusd

[19-Aug-18 02:53 PM] infotech-al#5583
let me stop and start it again

[19-Aug-18 02:53 PM] Decker#3767
check `debug.log` ... may be it contains something that would explain your case ...

[19-Aug-18 02:53 PM] infotech-al#5583
have to run out for an appointment will be baok shortly

[19-Aug-18 02:53 PM] infotech-al#5583
will check on it asap

[19-Aug-18 03:43 PM] lukechilds#2707
>that is whats in my verusd
are you sure?

[19-Aug-18 03:43 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you're using the stock verusd it will have `addnode`, not `connect`

[19-Aug-18 03:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
the command is similar but not the same

[19-Aug-18 03:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
you should resync with the above command decker posted

[19-Aug-18 03:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
then you can restart via verusd

[19-Aug-18 03:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
once you're fully synced

[19-Aug-18 04:52 PM] NNoperator#3835
@infotech-al  did you rm -rf VerusCoin folder before  "refreshing VRSC with latest master"  ?

[19-Aug-18 04:53 PM] infotech-al#5583
Yes

[19-Aug-18 04:53 PM] infotech-al#5583
I did

[19-Aug-18 04:53 PM] NNoperator#3835
great.  So did they fix the trailing slashes on the URLs ?

[19-Aug-18 04:53 PM] NNoperator#3835
it wouldn't build for me

[19-Aug-18 04:54 PM] infotech-al#5583
Yes but I will have to do it all over again once I get home

[19-Aug-18 04:54 PM] infotech-al#5583
Out now

[19-Aug-18 04:54 PM] NNoperator#3835
if it built OK for you then they probably fixed it.

[19-Aug-18 04:54 PM] NNoperator#3835
good luck

I'm curious about the current trend of ultra-low utxo counts and frequent splits from a blockchain spam perspective.
As utxo optimizations exists to minimize the time a `listunspent` call takes, people are working hard to keep their utxo counts very, very low. However, as a side-effect people using this strategy split very often. I personally split funds on average about every 10 minutes.

I have the following questions:
- Is frequent splitting (and then rapid consumption of those UTXOs) actually BETTER for the network's health as it reduces the overall size of the unspent output database?
- OR, would less frequent splitting (resulting in fewer transactions) combined with some `listunspent` notarization optimization (to return early for example once a certain threshold of appropriated sized utxos have been found) be better for the network?

[20-Aug-18 06:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
Personally I parse listunspent every 20 min for every coin. If under 100 or 200 I launch acsplit 100

[20-Aug-18 06:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Exception for game and chips where I split 20 by 20

[20-Aug-18 06:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
But still on a 20 min base

[20-Aug-18 06:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
(Because of fees)

[20-Aug-18 06:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Actually it s btc game and chips

[20-Aug-18 07:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
some people might argue increased TX noise is a good thing as it inceases anonymity for everyone

[20-Aug-18 07:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
although notary pubkeys aren't exactly hard to filter out

[21-Aug-18 02:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```>>- OR, would less frequent splitting (resulting in fewer transactions) combined with some listunspent notarization optimization (to return early for example once a certain threshold of appropriated sized utxos have been found) be better for the network?```

I get what you mean here, and I discussed this with Decker, before he went on holidays. A cache of some kind on the deamon side would be perfect, as the deamons have an event of a spend, or receive of UTXO it can use to update this cache. 

Personally, I have started using the `time` command to test the exact time it takes to `listunspent` and tbh, I'm not finding a *huge* diffrence. Its `ms` at best, which is weird, as network latency for me is 400ms to quite a few nodes. So this tiny amount of time, seems mostly irrelevant. My real world findings suggest heavily the opposite to this though, and I am lost as to why.

The biggest issue we have with using such low utxo on KMD (only KMD, nothing else matters for this) is that iguana selects its utxo's by random, and one dpow loop currently does not have the info required to know if that utxo has already been chosen. By lowering hte counts of utxo, we are increasing the chance for a failed notarization round. This does not seem to effect total counts however, as people using very agressive optimisations like Luke are still doing perfectly fine.

Perhaps the time it takes for iguana to process UTXOs is more important than the time it takes for those UTXOs to be pulled up by komodod.

{Reactions}
👍 

[21-Aug-18 06:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am thinking that it might be that too, which seems to be why having less, and making sure there are no other utxo other than the ones iguana uses at any time helps so much.

[21-Aug-18 09:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
I believe it is more wallet size than no of UTXOs that affects list unspent perf:

```
lukechilds@notarynode-ar:~/notary-node-utils$ ls -lah ~/.komodo/wallet.dat
-rw------- 1 lukechilds lukechilds 1.8M Aug 21 09:11 /home/lukechilds/.komodo/wallet.dat

[21-Aug-18 09:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
I've got mine about as low as they will go

[21-Aug-18 09:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
I plan on in increasing them drastically and monitoring closely to see if it has much affect on listunsent perf aslong as I keep on top of wallet.dat filesize

[21-Aug-18 09:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
also I spoke to James about getting a dev node to test some of these optimisations

[21-Aug-18 09:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
he seemed open to it

[21-Aug-18 09:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
so I can test more aggressive things without worrying about hurting my downtime

[21-Aug-18 09:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
and will of course share my findings here

[21-Aug-18 09:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
and I won't be mining on it so won't get any extra hashrate or mining rewards

[21-Aug-18 09:15 AM] lukechilds#2707

@Mylo what UTXO count?

maybe i'll make a pretty graph next week.  be interesting.

[21-Aug-18 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ran a heap today, wallet size def increases it by more than number of UTXO, but maybe theres more too it than this.

[21-Aug-18 11:23 PM] Mylo#8306
so looks like we need wallet size, list unspent count, cpu gen & freq to do time analysis.

[21-Aug-18 11:24 PM] Mylo#8306
and storage (type or hdparm <- if this works on ssd/nvm drives)

NN datacenter/hosting provider poll out of curiosity:
React to this message:
with an ⭕ if you use OVH or another dedicated server provider
with a 🌳 if you use AWS
with an 🌊 if you use DigitalOcean, Vultr, or any other cloud VPS provider that's not AWS
with a ⚙ if you use a self-built, co-located server
and with a ❓ if you use anything else

{Reactions}
🌊 (3) ⭕ (7) ⚙ (3) ❓ (3) 🛰 🌳 

[22-Aug-18 08:43 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Should not the answer be ⭕ or ⚙ for every NN operator as a dedicated server has to be used?

[22-Aug-18 08:43 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Or maybe AWS or digital Ocean propose dedicated servers and I m not aware of it 😅

[22-Aug-18 11:19 PM] bishop#9773
any chance of an ongoing test NN setup for those of us wanting to validate the viability of running next year? I know there was a test on pizza/beer or something a few weeks prior to elections.

[22-Aug-18 11:24 PM] Mylo#8306
yes there's plenty of intermittent chat.  won't happen before block 1,000,000 because of network upgrade (approx 14-16 days).

[22-Aug-18 11:24 PM] Mylo#8306
*unlikely to happen

[23-Aug-18 08:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
Why does a dedicated server have to be used?

[23-Aug-18 08:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
surely a mix of both is better?

[23-Aug-18 08:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
VPS traditionally have way less down time and easy migrations

[23-Aug-18 08:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
at the cost of losing some control over your hardware

[23-Aug-18 08:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
seems like a diverse collection of providers and instance types as possible would be healthiest for the network

[23-Aug-18 10:37 AM] metaphilibert#0926
I agree with variety is better for network but I think having a dedicated server for NN is mandatory by the rules set before elections

[23-Aug-18 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not so

[23-Aug-18 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My partner enquired about it extensivly, as we planned tro use VMware on out dedicated server and he tried and trried for ages, to get an asnwer as to why virtualisation was not allowed, and there was non given, apart from wasted $$$.

[23-Aug-18 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in the end, we went with a dedicated server and VM's ... and I am SO glad we did, as the quad CPU server I got, was just not being used for ntoary node at all, less than 1% load... so I have been able to use it to spin up VM's for testing all kinds of other KMD stuff, hidden behind a strict firewall on a seperate DC subnet.

[23-Aug-18 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe the reason for using dedicated only was the huge amoutn of TIME_WAIT connections iguana was causing, but I found what was causign that, and it was a bug, that james fixed in the first few weeks.

Dedicated servers with minimum specs (500 GB SSD, 64 GB RAM and a decent CPU to have a good space for BTC, KMD and other chains, and mostly to have room for a growing number of ac's, each one needing more and more space everyday) 
were always publicly known as a rule to run a NN

Now we can argue about the usage of this power that is still not fully used (CPU and RAM)
But it is growing since last year, it nearly doubled in every aspect (CPU RAM Storage space)

Now for dedicated vs vps, question is about responsiveness

So you should prefer to remove a layer and be more responsive, no? 😉
