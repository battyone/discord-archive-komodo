well I def don't want to skimp

[16-Feb-19 06:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I want to give best effort to earn necessary votes

[16-Feb-19 06:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
So you will present ?

[16-Feb-19 06:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean : you ll be a candidate ?

[16-Feb-19 06:34 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I want to. Just decided about a week ago.

[16-Feb-19 06:34 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I;ll do what's necessary

[16-Feb-19 06:34 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
and I have the tech know-how

[16-Feb-19 06:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
So next step is to start learning

[16-Feb-19 06:34 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I'm available to maintain

[16-Feb-19 06:35 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I read first batch of links provided by SHossain

[16-Feb-19 06:35 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
all good reads

[16-Feb-19 06:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
Then choose the region you want to candidate in and prepare investigations and compare datacenters locations//connectivity//prices

[16-Feb-19 06:36 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Want to give myself best opportunity, seems forwrd looking to figure out where a datacenter could be most benefit

[16-Feb-19 06:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
They you ll have a base price then a plan. Adjust it till you got the best ratio : you r ready for hw

[16-Feb-19 06:36 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
what's lacking / most sensible geographical location?

[16-Feb-19 06:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Check stats

[16-Feb-19 06:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
You ll see big differences between regions

[16-Feb-19 06:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
That s all about connectivity.

[16-Feb-19 06:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
You need to have a plan like : ok : there may be like 5 spots in eu but 7 in sh, but sh isn t a stable one and server costs xx% more.

[16-Feb-19 06:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Picking the region is crucial

[16-Feb-19 06:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Some ones are REALLY harder to get in

[16-Feb-19 06:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
Then you have the region you want to present and know where you will base yourself : time to get a little vps and start experimenting things. In the same time Prepare your speech and proposal docs to be ready when election starts

[16-Feb-19 06:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
To go back to your question :All nodes are on DCs , and some have weaker stats by far. In some cases it s just about server optim and good maintenance, but in other cases it s just because connectivity is not so good. There s no secret looking at stats : you can see day by day that there are patterns identified when you focus on regions

[16-Feb-19 06:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hardware and in some case even provider being the same

[16-Feb-19 06:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
What differs ? Connectivity and geoloc.

[16-Feb-19 06:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
It matters

[16-Feb-19 06:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Am sure even if you pop up a monster server on your home connection you won t be able to fight vs top nodes

[16-Feb-19 06:49 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
probably right

[16-Feb-19 06:49 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
starting my hunt.

[16-Feb-19 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
But as everything : that s an advice

[16-Feb-19 06:50 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
have been able to use vultr for many MN's but dont think it can cut it for KMD NN

[16-Feb-19 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
And is not the "truth"

[16-Feb-19 06:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just what we experienced. Ask @blackjok3r . He chose to avoid huge DC s to protect decentralization. His node can t fight. And am sure he s the guy that have a ton of tweaks and optim stuff.

[16-Feb-19 06:53 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
yep

[16-Feb-19 06:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just the fact that his DC is not on a huge "hub" gives direct "penalties"

[16-Feb-19 06:53 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
this is what kept me from charging in

[16-Feb-19 06:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just ask yourself : why will I present for ? Is my goal to be elected and just try, or do I intend to run a node and fight for re election

[16-Feb-19 06:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
From then you need to gather every little info that will make your node / setup / proposal the best chance

[16-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I want to be involved long term

[16-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
So performance matters

[16-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I wish I had started last year

[16-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Never too late man

[16-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
You just need to be sure of it. When you are it s just about preparation

[16-Feb-19 06:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Technical knowledge / finding support / have a plan for region/location

[16-Feb-19 07:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Install a node, go to #kmdlabs or here, ask questions, test stuff and see if you enjoy it first

[16-Feb-19 07:10 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
cool. Thanx a bunch. I'll be around, on the search for best hosting / geolocation

[16-Feb-19 09:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My node is also very old hardware, and in very isolated location , those two things don't go too nicly together. Optimization of software gave my node a chance but I chose to share my results with everyone else and lost the advantage gained, as I felt that was better for the network as a whole. I dont mind running election again next year, my node is able to maintain average performance in my region despite its old hardware and bad location. Still have plenty if resources for expansion as I am using 48 core quad CPU older server for the massive amount of ram available for much less upfront cost, although something faster can be rented elsewhere for less per month than I currently pay.

[16-Feb-19 09:58 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Good info

[16-Feb-19 10:00 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I don't want to come off as opportunistic simply electing to go with hosting provider for geolocation which is more advantageous for the server / me rather than selecting host which could be better for the network

[16-Feb-19 10:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I agree with that. For me I started with very little experience in all this, so purchased a cheap server upfront and built many nodes on it at home until I got it right, at the time that was my cheapest option, renting from a host for testnet wasn't something I could afford to do. Its all depends on what u can do. The best nodes are mostly dedicated servers owned by the operator, such as shossains and deckers. I think if mine was on the opposite aide of Australia, where most of the SH nodes are it would be much much better. Even with old hardware. I found disk speed and vast amounts of ram to be the highest requirement then number of CPU cores. The CPU speed per sore is less important, but affects restart times of daemons and as such gets up notarizing faster after updates, or if bad things happen resyncs of chains.

[16-Feb-19 10:09 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
thing is I have hardware pretty close to being able to handle the load, would just need more RAM. It's my local bandwidth that can't cut it by 50%. Sucks. I'm off that though. Maybe in a few years one of my local providers will step it up

[16-Feb-19 10:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My server is using a gigabit local connection at DC but international bandwidth is about 100Mbit which is plenty really apart from the first sync of all the chains.

[17-Feb-19 12:08 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
how many notary node applicants were there last year ?

is there a way to determine which hosting companies the current NN's are utilizing?

[18-Feb-19 03:44 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Maybe I shouldn't go with DigitalOcean hosting if like 50% of NN's already use the same service..

I've paid other VPS in Bitcoin before and wound up having them ban my account when I loged in from new VPN

was actually goign to ask about best way to go about paying for my NN service

[18-Feb-19 04:05 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
figured with the amount needing to be paid I may go ahead and register openly as myself and pay with credit card.

[18-Feb-19 04:05 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
$300 - $400 BTC per month that could disappear in same fashion makes me nervous

[18-Feb-19 04:05 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Vultr has been fine

[18-Feb-19 04:06 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
but I don't think their service can effectively manage KMD NN..

[18-Feb-19 04:07 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
they have worthwhile geolocation ?

I see VULTR would require me to justify raising my monthly instance cost limit..

[18-Feb-19 04:15 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
tough to tell if their hosting can even toe the line though

[18-Feb-19 04:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
guess I could put ~ $500 monthly limit

[18-Feb-19 04:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
yeah, cant even find a suitable plan on Vultr

[18-Feb-19 04:47 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
