thanks audo!

[13-Apr-19 09:49 AM] Audo#5667
yes, that's not allowed. Each address must be associated with a region

I double checked that from Kolo yesterday and just made a pull reqeust to clarify the rule: https://komodoelection.com/2-election-process/election-rules/

and votes cannot be transfered between regions, i.e. you cannot declere that your EU address is now SH address

@Lumbi  🆙  ☝ ⏫  ⤴ ⚠

[13-Apr-19 09:53 AM] Alright#0419
From that rules page:
`A notary node team can only control one notary node per region`
Are we sure about this?

[13-Apr-19 09:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
_considers running for 8 nodes in NA_

[13-Apr-19 09:55 AM] Alright#0419
*considers running my AR node wherever is most convenient for me*

[13-Apr-19 09:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if a "notary node team" is 2 people, can they each control one notary node per region and the "team" have one, giving them 3?

[13-Apr-19 09:58 AM] Audo#5667
I believe in the previous years the answer has been no

@kolo should confirm all details / edge cases

[13-Apr-19 09:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, I ask, because what if it's the inverse:
individuals later join a "team" that they weren't initially part of....

[13-Apr-19 10:00 AM] Audo#5667
I think we will need a jury and a judge 😃

[13-Apr-19 10:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that rule was easier to define when there were less projects 😛

[13-Apr-19 11:55 AM] newvulcan#4719
Erm, I have 806 utxo's in KMD, 143 in BEER and 99 in PIZZA. I am right in saying that's not great for my server is it ? I probably need to switch off autosplit for a while

[13-Apr-19 11:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
not great no.. switch off autosplit and cron a utxo splitter script

[13-Apr-19 12:07 PM] newvulcan#4719

Just curious about why are they some dust in some candidates addresses

[13-Apr-19 12:20 PM] phm87#7395
Address of entry 88 is coinbase maybe it is a mistake

[13-Apr-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it was a "dust attack" to make them appear on the richlist

[13-Apr-19 12:26 PM] eclips#1570
list is candidates without auto reelected ?

[13-Apr-19 12:26 PM] Decker#3767
@metaphilibert that was me ... i sent some dust on all addresses to make sure labels displayed correctly.

[13-Apr-19 12:28 PM] eclips#1570
don't get why metaphi's nodes aren't present and indenodes' are

[13-Apr-19 12:28 PM] metaphilibert#0926
I was guessing it was a kind of test 😉  thanks

[13-Apr-19 12:29 PM] Decker#3767
@eclips bcz metaphilibert contact me and said that he is not propose himself as a candidate this year.

[13-Apr-19 12:30 PM] Decker#3767
@eclips basically, labels it's just a copy & paste of proposal addresses.

[13-Apr-19 12:30 PM] Decker#3767
Now i'm clearing it from unneeded ...

[13-Apr-19 12:31 PM] Decker#3767
And indenodes updated their proposal 15 days ago ... so, i'm just copied the info.

[13-Apr-19 12:36 PM] eclips#1570
so is it best to just leave the candidate on github and delete those who are auto reelected ?

[13-Apr-19 12:40 PM] Decker#3767
my guess - it will be comfortable for voters, if github proposals will not contain old addresses / auto re-elected and other info, that possible can get confuse. i managed only labels list according to github info.

[13-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Lumbi#8378
my thinking was to go where I was needed most... 😃  NA/EU would be vacations, so that leaves the other regions

[13-Apr-19 12:45 PM] Decker#3767
@Lumbi your proposal contains only one `RSp89iBPWifdtq6d8NmXZ4ZXsg3AyakVtj` vote address, which region it's related?

[13-Apr-19 12:48 PM] Lumbi#8378

@newvulcan what sort of numbers?

[13-Apr-19 02:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
`just run sendtoaddress to redistribute my utxo's` are you trying to split?

[13-Apr-19 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`are broken pipes a concern?`
no, its a disconnection; only of concern when you have several in a short period, then you know you have a serious connectivity issue on your end
`Who's running BEER on an obsolete version?`
likely someone that set a node running long ago and never updated

My guess is, this is just affecting me, as no one else has mentioned it, but I'm suddenly getting the following when trying to start ./m_notary_testnet
xmalloc: cannot allocate 1286 bytes
and iguana stops

[13-Apr-19 06:15 PM] newvulcan#4719
It  started happening after I stopped iguana, did a git pull which updated some files, and then I tried to start it again

[13-Apr-19 06:16 PM] newvulcan#4719
I've got 128GB of memory and a huge swapfile so I'm surprised I'm getting a memory error

[13-Apr-19 06:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
what files did it update?

[13-Apr-19 06:27 PM] Strob#3417
@newvulcan Di you start all daemons (KMD, PIZZA, BEER, TXSCLCC) before?

[13-Apr-19 06:29 PM] newvulcan#4719
I'll be honest I'm not sure. Everything on the server appeared to be running (all deamons).

`ps aux | grep komodod`

[13-Apr-19 06:41 PM] newvulcan#4719
Sorry that message before wasn't very clear. Yes all daemons were running, what I wasn't sure about was what files got update with the git pull

[13-Apr-19 06:42 PM] zatJUM#9924
@SHossain Could you please ping NN to restart, now  the PR is merged?

[13-Apr-19 06:52 PM] PHBA2061#2530
if you only changed your IP, not the pubkey, then a restart is not required

[13-Apr-19 06:56 PM] zatJUM#9924
Yes, but I think only some of you have added me with the new IP

[13-Apr-19 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
IP propagates even if only one node knows yours

[13-Apr-19 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
and as you connect out, other nodes discover yours

[13-Apr-19 07:04 PM] PHBA2061#2530
since the last time we restarted 2-3 days ago,  my node's performance decreased a lot too 😂

[13-Apr-19 07:05 PM] zatJUM#9924
So perhaps my new vps isn't guilty?!

[13-Apr-19 07:06 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I'm not sure

[13-Apr-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
46 seems a good number

{Reactions}
🤷 

[13-Apr-19 07:10 PM] PHBA2061#2530
if I understand correctly, the bit set in recvmask determine the group of NN who are eligible to sign the nota transaction, and the number may be > 7 (the current minsigs). But you can succeed signing it or not depends on a lot of factor, and only 7 nodes can sign it, which are the bit set in bestmask.

Oh dear, I think my server is seriously broken. Tried a complete reboot, restarted everything one at a time successfully until I got to running ./m_notary_testnet and poof - smoke and tears - 128GB of memory and swapspace gone in a couple of seconds 😦

[13-Apr-19 07:35 PM] phm87#7395
@newvulcan  can you check that you have KMD and all AC synced ? Some utxo for all coins and either automatic or manual split ?

[13-Apr-19 07:38 PM] phm87#7395
Here are some ideas:
- check that you have KMD and all AC synced
- check that you have some funds and some utxo
- check and you have manual split properly configured or automatic split
- check if you see any error in 'iguana tv' (the output displayed in the screen where you launched iguana)

[13-Apr-19 07:41 PM] metaphilibert#0926
@zatJUM as I understood your new vps is in SH, which is a region where you may be quite  isolated in testnet due to latency and a small number of nodes in this region

[13-Apr-19 07:42 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Less chance to be in the notarisations rounds

[13-Apr-19 07:42 PM] metaphilibert#0926
So it MAY perform worse than your previous one, even if hw is better

[13-Apr-19 07:43 PM] zatJUM#9924
Yes, could be
