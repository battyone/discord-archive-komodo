@kolo  I haz some commits in VRSC, just use `./verusd -pubkey=...` and you should be fine

[27-Jun-18 06:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
A trick I did for verus is changing the verusd file with path included and symlinked it and the cli with verusd and verus-cli. That allow to launch systemwide from a different user and not mess with which folder you should be

That s the point. Creating verusd and verus-cli as symlinks.

Ok. So call that with your path var from a different user without scripting it. Gl.

[27-Jun-18 06:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
you can t, you just CAN't be wrong calling VRSC with the wrong komodo daemon with that trick. That's not supposed to be revolutionary, just make things easier, and avoid any forgetting to go on the good path / user, plus it allows you to just dedicate a single unpriviledged user from others, in less than 1 minute, and no coding at all

[27-Jun-18 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
only remaining attack vector non system dependent as the user is jailed, and you launch it via a proper sudo is via RPC calls. Sorry if this seems "stupid", but I believe this could just help for people paranoiac as me to run on separate users and allow em to easily control those users without any special script.
sudo -H -u vrsc bash -c '/home/vrsc/VerusCoin/src/verusd &'

[27-Jun-18 06:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
that's my way of handling it, I won't script every single external coin because it's sexy and so cool to use PATH vars, 2 minutes it works, and you're safer than launching on main user.

Why won't vrsc work for me, is a fix planned or do I have to host its deamon on another server and SSH tunnel to it for now? I have one day left before I go on holiday's I really need to sort this out.

No AES-NI or AVX. I am speaking with decker now, hopefully we can find fix.

hello allÔºåhow to apply for notary node? Could you please give me a direction about this?

[28-Jun-18 06:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
when election time start you ll have to present yourself as a candidate.

[28-Jun-18 06:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
then tou ll have to convince people vote for you :)

[28-Jun-18 06:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
there likely will be a testnet to prove that you re able to run a node. that will prove you learned the basic steps of the setup

[28-Jun-18 06:22 AM] dulexbit#5524
Thanks sir. What is about the election time for next election?

[28-Jun-18 06:22 AM] Deleted User#0000

[28-Jun-18 06:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
sry for typing. mobile is not the best

[28-Jun-18 06:23 AM] dulexbit#5524
So it is wise to run a test node firstly.

globally knowing the cli commands and outputs is one key to understand it all. i don t know if gcharangs link have it but there s also a cli howto available on komodoplatform

mainly supernet / komodo ones. in fact the ones that are on the setup guide

after assetchains, do fiat-cli importprivkey

[28-Jun-18 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It works provied you set all the correct variables at the top of the script correctly

[28-Jun-18 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It takes a while to complete as it uses just the single deamon. The code is very well commented so you an see why it does each stage.

[28-Jun-18 07:50 AM] jeezy#3408
how are you handling the bouncing

[28-Jun-18 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I made it to help with the floods of missingsig errors from other nodes always flooding me, but I found it was only a handfull of nodes.

[28-Jun-18 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bouncing... I am fine to make the script public now if you want it

[28-Jun-18 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tested it only on a test node, but it worked fine
