[19-Mar-19 11:37 AM] Mylo#8306

[19-Mar-19 11:38 AM] Mylo#8306
i use screen.  and lots of scripts, and  a telegram bot.   telegram bot is my heart rate monitor

I'm installing the Ubuntu mini installation, so you don't install any graphical interface at all? Not even a minimal one?

[19-Mar-19 02:05 PM] CHMEX#0686
I would not install a GUI console only

[19-Mar-19 02:07 PM] Strob#3417
Ok it's less secure?

[19-Mar-19 02:08 PM] Strob#3417
And I guess we should avoir remote desktop like x2go even if only accessible locally on my own network

[19-Mar-19 02:10 PM] CHMEX#0686
I would say whatever layer you add is an added layer of risk

[19-Mar-19 02:10 PM] CHMEX#0686
I assume most operator run it on console only

[19-Mar-19 02:10 PM] Strob#3417
Ok cool I get it

[19-Mar-19 02:15 PM] Strob#3417
When a notary node start notarizing is its IP publicly published and does it all of the sudden become the target of more attack attempts?

[19-Mar-19 02:17 PM] eclips#1570
never heard of any hacks

[19-Mar-19 02:18 PM] eclips#1570
use ssh with publickey only, fail2ban and ufw

[19-Mar-19 02:19 PM] Strob#3417
I knew about private key ssh and fail2ban but I will look for ufw too I didn't know about that one

[19-Mar-19 02:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
just use purely open source command line software for better results

[19-Mar-19 02:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ssh

[19-Mar-19 02:55 PM] Strob#3417
yes sure thanks guys!

[19-Mar-19 02:55 PM] Strob#3417
and girls!

[19-Mar-19 04:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
ufw is the default firewall in ubuntu, or used to be, fyi

[19-Mar-19 07:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
as a above - console only, ufw, fail2ban, ssh via publickey, monitoring and if possible and if you have the time to fine tune, setup an IDS as well such as snort or suricata <- that is a rabbit hole you might not want to go down; you have been warned

[19-Mar-19 07:54 PM] Strob#3417
Ok thanks @mrlynch I will look into those intrusion detection systems as well.

[19-Mar-19 07:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
text/mail/telegram alerts are also nice to have

[19-Mar-19 07:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
you just need to figure out what alerts you need

[19-Mar-19 07:55 PM] jorian#4555
telegram bots are the bomb

[19-Mar-19 07:56 PM] jorian#4555
and easy to setup

[19-Mar-19 07:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
that's gonna be my rabbit hole if pirate wins in the election üòÅ

[19-Mar-19 07:56 PM] jorian#4555
when pirate wins

[19-Mar-19 07:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
that's good to know... what do you alert on?!

[19-Mar-19 07:56 PM] Strob#3417
yes WHEN! lol

[19-Mar-19 07:57 PM] jorian#4555
whether i'm notarizing or not. need to enhance that for next season, but for now it does the trick

[19-Mar-19 07:57 PM] mrlynch#5735
i hope so üòÑ we are going 100% on this

[19-Mar-19 07:57 PM] jorian#4555
also, every 4 block rewards i send just the coinbase into a 10KMD+ tx

[19-Mar-19 07:57 PM] mrlynch#5735
even with the visuals üòÅ

```also, every 4 block rewards i send just the coinbase into a 10KMD+ tx```
might i ask why?

also.. what do you normally alert for?

[19-Mar-19 08:00 PM] jorian#4555
precious interest / rewards

[19-Mar-19 08:00 PM] jorian#4555
and it keeps my wallet clean

[19-Mar-19 08:01 PM] jorian#4555
well not so much actually, i just alert for a down node. iguana has had some leaks lately, so that's what i'm monitoring mostly, as sometimes iguana just stops notarizing, but is still running

[19-Mar-19 08:01 PM] jorian#4555
other notaries also have monitoring for daemon status, balances

[19-Mar-19 08:02 PM] mrlynch#5735
thank you üòÉ

[19-Mar-19 08:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'm trying to stash as much info as possible üòÅ

[19-Mar-19 08:05 PM] jorian#4555
that's a good thing üëç

[20-Mar-19 03:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
keeping your wallets as small as possible is the magic behind having the best notary stats

[20-Mar-19 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
RPCs I created have been merged for that, which makes wallet maintenance  a trivial task... You do need a utxo managemet solution to use them though.

[20-Mar-19 03:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
merging mining rewards and any very old utxo.

[20-Mar-19 03:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
allowing the wallet to run inside a 1000 block window seems to work pretty well

[20-Mar-19 03:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r oh no, that makes being a NN op too easy!!!!!!

[20-Mar-19 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[20-Mar-19 03:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
manually cleaning up dozens of  300MB wallet.dat's was the "secret sauce" :abusedsmily:

[20-Mar-19 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the more coins we notarize the worse the problem gets, and KMD takes too long to restart

[20-Mar-19 03:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
`cleanwallettransactions` is making it into KMD proper ?

[20-Mar-19 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so a solution to that problem without needing a restart was required. Quite a few nodes have it now. Its in FSM already from LABS merge

[20-Mar-19 03:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Assumeing that it makes it down for the hard fork.

[20-Mar-19 03:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's in jl777 or FSM branch now?

[20-Mar-19 03:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
last i heard it was only in LABS fork, i think

[20-Mar-19 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS was merged to FSM

[20-Mar-19 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then some of its code was disabled

[20-Mar-19 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But since then, I have changed it quite a bit to get MoMoM workign properly... so it needs another merge

[20-Mar-19 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We still ahve testing to carry out first though

Hey, we are preparing to launch a new election site with all the info about notary nodes and the elections.

We want to give an accurate description about the notary node daily routines & duties to not get candidates who come with unrealistic expectations and then drop the ball after they find out how much work it is.

Could you guys help write that content? It doesn't have to be super long, just to give an idea. The content would be written with markdown, and no need to worry about readability or grammar as we got an editor who will finalize the text.

Hi all! Question about the NN setup. In the final steps, when it says to make sure Bitcoind is running, I start the bitcoind deamon and it starts but if I do "bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo" I get his error: error: JSON value is not an integer as expected
Is this a problem?

[21-Mar-19 09:56 PM] Strob#3417
My BTCwif seems to have been imported though. Instead of getting ismine: true I was getting "success" when running  "bitcoin-cli validateaddress mybtcaddress"

[21-Mar-19 09:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
what version are you running ?

[21-Mar-19 10:00 PM] Strob#3417
Bitcoind 0.16.3

[21-Mar-19 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
with getblockchaininfo ?

[21-Mar-19 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
it looks like you send a wrong char with a command requiting an INT

[21-Mar-19 10:01 PM] Strob#3417
I get this error when running getblockchaininfo yes

[21-Mar-19 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
(the error says that)

[21-Mar-19 10:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
bitcoin-cli getmininginfo

[21-Mar-19 10:02 PM] Strob#3417
Yes I know but it's the same command that was working before. I restarted the server and I always get this.

[21-Mar-19 10:02 PM] Strob#3417
same error with bitcoin-cli getmininginfo

[21-Mar-19 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would just reinstall it

[21-Mar-19 10:03 PM] Strob#3417
ok

[21-Mar-19 10:03 PM] Strob#3417
one step I was not sure is this one: Create the wallet passphrase (unlocking) api call at ~/SuperNET/iguana/wp_7776 - this gets called at notary start up

curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"method\":\"walletpassphrase\",\"params\":[\"YOUR VERY SECURE P

[21-Mar-19 10:04 PM] Strob#3417
Does it mean we need to create a file called wp_7776 and put the command inside and save?

[21-Mar-19 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah

[21-Mar-19 10:04 PM] Strob#3417
Because for all other instruction is clearly stated if we need to create a file using nano but this step is less clear

[21-Mar-19 10:04 PM] Strob#3417
ok thanks

[21-Mar-19 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
in the file

[21-Mar-19 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
that iguana will call

[21-Mar-19 10:05 PM] Strob#3417
ok that's what I did

[21-Mar-19 10:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
you ll have the curl command
