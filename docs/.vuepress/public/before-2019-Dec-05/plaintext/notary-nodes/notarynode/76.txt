What is the KMD notarization address?
I would like to use the /stats KMDLABS script for testnet but I need this information.
How/Where can I find it?

Do notaries specifically use Iguana to do the notarisations onto BTC? Is running a BTC full node required?

[02-Apr-19 05:33 PM] CHMEX#0686
they use Iguana  to do all the notarizations and yes you need a BTC full node

[02-Apr-19 05:34 PM] CHMEX#0686
you need a full node of all notarized chains

[02-Apr-19 05:35 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Thanks. From what I understand, the testnet is notarising to KMD, is a BTC full node required for the testnet?

[02-Apr-19 05:37 PM] CHMEX#0686
not required  for testnet

[02-Apr-19 05:38 PM] CHMEX#0686
but I guess doesnt hurt to sync it once

[02-Apr-19 05:39 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I suppose it'd make the transition to mainnet easy

[02-Apr-19 06:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
@blackjok3r is it possible to set a limit on cleanwallettransactions ?

`Remove all txs that are spent. You can clear all txs bar one, by specifiying a txid`

[02-Apr-19 06:18 PM] PHBA2061#2530
seems like a no to me

[02-Apr-19 06:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
if you intend to use testnet server for mainnet yeah @NutellaLicka it can t hurt to sync all, and in case you got sync issues you ll get plznty of time to solve it

[02-Apr-19 06:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
look at the loops used in the rpc file @mrlynch about clearwallet. iirc it uses  a value for block target, don t know if it s possible to set a limit in tx (that would just mean changing how the loop acts)

[02-Apr-19 06:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
but basically if you re able to understand the loop and array created, you can control what remains

[02-Apr-19 06:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
trying to find it in the code

[02-Apr-19 06:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
rpcwallet

[02-Apr-19 06:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
under wallet if I remember right

[02-Apr-19 06:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
all rpc calls are defined in this cpp or .h file

[02-Apr-19 06:25 PM] mrlynch#5735
found it

[02-Apr-19 06:25 PM] mrlynch#5735
silly me.. was looking in the master branch

[02-Apr-19 06:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
it s like some sort of cursor pointing. using a tx as base is easy on loops cause a tx links to a blocknumber

[02-Apr-19 06:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
am absolutely not able to do that myself, or it would take me a lot of time to get it working, but now it s clearly written, adapting seems possible, I just only can point you where the stuff is, @blackjok3r is the guru here

[02-Apr-19 06:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
```if ( out.nDepth > oldestTxDepth )
              oldestTxDepth = out.nDepth;```
is nDepth the number of blocks/confs that have passed?

[02-Apr-19 06:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'm assuming yes, just want to confirm
`oldestTxDepth = oldestTxDepth + 1; // add extra block just for safety.`

@Deleted User  that is because japanese don't use greek alphabet, they use a system called syllabary instead
