There are some people that hosted nodes outside of the designated region. You'll have to ask @kolo about that though.

There is no official list or map of candidates, all are made by contributing members. We were told we should not affect candidates (to be fair) by listing/non listing them, so we rely on what people contribute. Thanks those are really good. The most fair method I assume.

[14-Apr-19 05:18 PM] kolo#1111
Map is tricky thing as there is no loction of node known, all data is actually contact data of hosting company registred anywhere.

My reason for choosing Israel as well. No notaries even remotely close to it and 10Gbit :S

@webworker01 Is Malta part of  SH?

[14-Apr-19 05:51 PM] Lumbi#8378
I wonder how's the Gbit in Panama? I didn't realise how big the AR region is.. Maybe SH is a better bet than AR...

[14-Apr-19 05:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`My main goal with choosing SH as a region is to expand the notary network to an underserved area. `
`My reason for choosing Israel as well.`
I like that and believe it's an important thing for folks to take note of....

CPU mining HUSH3 is very effective right now, notaries!!!! No public pools exist yet

[14-Apr-19 06:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
but one of your lovely NN ops just put a GPU on the network, so maybe it's GPU time

1) where's his proposal
2) let him do his own job

[14-Apr-19 07:34 PM] phm87#7395
his proposal is on the github and it was updated. Ok I'll let him do his job but I'm fair play sorry

[14-Apr-19 07:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
does he not have a keyboard to type here?

[14-Apr-19 07:48 PM] phm87#7395
he is busy I think and it is another guy who told me this

[14-Apr-19 07:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`does he not have a keyboard to type here?`
yes, but it only usually works when he wants to complain in #talk-mining that no one wants to rewrite the code yiimp/yaamp he already has for him

[14-Apr-19 08:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
is that the closed source one?

[14-Apr-19 08:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
`he is busy I think and it is another guy who told me this`
so he had a guy tell you tell us?!

[14-Apr-19 08:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`is that the closed source one?` not really, just the algo solving bits for equihash are a closely guarded "secret" that isn't shared unless someone likes you

[14-Apr-19 08:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
`just the algo solving bits for equihash` <- isn't that like 80% of a pool's point?
