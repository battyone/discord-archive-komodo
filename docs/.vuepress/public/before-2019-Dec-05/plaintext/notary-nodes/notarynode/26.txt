dev branches has notarization for PIRATE active

[23-Sep-18 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
the one glitch is that you need to use marketmaker to do the splitting of funds as the komodod rpc calls block it

[23-Sep-18 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and unless you get lucky, mm will likely not properly sign the transactions

[23-Sep-18 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so you need to extract the unsigned hex from the mm withdraw and then use the komodo-cli signrawtransaction and then send it

[23-Sep-18 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry about this, hopefully someone can make a nice script to combine these actions for splitting the PIRATE utxo

@blackjok3r @Decker @Deleted User @webworker01 ^^ Please help us üòÉ

[23-Sep-18 09:43 PM] SHossain#0007
These are the steps to split PIRATE funds for NN
1. Install marketmaker
2. Edit `passphrase`
3. Edit `userpass`
4. Edit `enable`
5. Edit `splitfund`
6. Run `./client &` then `./setpassphrase; ./enable`
7. Run `./splitfund PIRATE`
8. Use `komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE signrawtransaction <RAWTX>`
9. Use `komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE sendrawtransaction <HEX>`

## enable script
```shell
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"enable\",\"coin\":\"PIRATE\"}"
```

## Split script
address = your NN address
script = 21 + btcpubkey + ac

```shell
#!/bin/bash
source userpass
export address=RBHzJTW73U3nyHyxBwiG92bJckxZowPY87
export script=210348d9b1fc6acf81290405580f525ee49b4749ed4637b51a28b18caa26543b20f0ac
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"withdraw\",\"coin\":\"$1\",\"outputs\":[{\"$address\":0.0001,\"script\":\"$script\"}, {\"$address\":0.0001,\"script\":\"$script\"}, {\"$address\":0.0001,\"script\":\"$script\"}, {\"$address\":0.0001,\"script\":\"$script\"}, {\"$address\":0.0001,\"script\":\"$script\"}, {\"$address\":0.0001,\"script\":\"$script\"}, {\"$address\":0.0001,\"script\":\"$script\"}, {\"$address\":0.0001,\"script\":\"$script\"}, {\"$address\":0.0001,\"script\":\"$script\"}, {\"$address\":0.0001,\"script\":\"$script\"}, {\"$address\":0.0001}]}"

Small example of how to prepare split tx without iguana and marketmaker exists here - https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo_scripts/blob/master/split_nn.sh , i think it can be used for PIRATE also.

i like this script. 0 fee transafer üòõ

[23-Sep-18 09:48 PM] Decker#3767
Btw ... question. For example NN have PIRATES on it's z-address. tx from z -> t not allowed in PIRATE. or we have exceptions now for NN pubkeys? Mean, how NN can get funds on it's t-address if have only z-funds?

[23-Sep-18 09:48 PM] SHossain#0007
NN has exception

[23-Sep-18 09:48 PM] SHossain#0007
they can make t tx

[23-Sep-18 09:48 PM] SHossain#0007
on private chain

[23-Sep-18 09:49 PM] Decker#3767
So, everybody can transfer funds from Z on NN addresses, right ?

[23-Sep-18 09:49 PM] Decker#3767
Or only NN t -> t allowed?

[23-Sep-18 09:49 PM] SHossain#0007
let me double check this using CLI to send to NN quickly

Where does the first t come from then

[23-Sep-18 09:50 PM] SHossain#0007

no other changes for PIRATE was needed

[23-Sep-18 09:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is the normal rpc prevents sending to t-addr, even if it is a notary addr

[23-Sep-18 09:55 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess I can change that if needed

[23-Sep-18 09:55 PM] SHossain#0007
i tried sending from normal daemon to my NN, didn't work

[23-Sep-18 09:56 PM] SHossain#0007
tried from t and z addr

[23-Sep-18 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is the normal rpc prevents sending to t-addr, even if it is a notary addr

[23-Sep-18 09:59 PM] Decker#3767
hm ... in this case seems is not possible to do z_sendmany from z to nn t-addr ... if rpc doesn't allow this.

[23-Sep-18 09:59 PM] Decker#3767
and mm can't help in construct rawtx from z -> nn t-addr too ...

[23-Sep-18 10:00 PM] SHossain#0007
@Decker how about if i send  funds to NN t address for everyone? would it be manageable from that part?

[23-Sep-18 10:01 PM] SHossain#0007
then, chain should allow NN t address tx

[23-Sep-18 10:01 PM] Decker#3767
let's explain you run out of funds on your t address ... and all notaries haven't PIRATE on t ... who will be fund them?

[23-Sep-18 10:01 PM] SHossain#0007
or i may be wrong about this idea

[23-Sep-18 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
the check that prevents the rpc to work needs to allow notary addresses. now I changed the function to be address based it wont be hard at all to allow notary address as destination

[23-Sep-18 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
just add komodo_isnotaryvout(coinaddr) == 0 to the ASSETCHAINS_PRIVATE checks in rpcwallet.cpp

[23-Sep-18 10:04 PM] jl777c#5810
for now we can do it via mm externally and before people run out of funds, the rpc calls can be fixed

Can you just have 1 person split all the notary PIRATTE out to the address, that seems much easier

[24-Sep-18 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Can the notary address send to any T address or just the Crypto Address and themself?

[24-Sep-18 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It really doesnt make a lot of sense to give notaries super powers, so this is how it should work. The only otherway to do it, is mine iguana utxo to notaary address, but so far havent figured out how to do that.

[24-Sep-18 04:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
paying ythe crypto address is already posible, as long as the vouts = 0, so all the notary utxo's would go to miners in this case I assume.

[24-Sep-18 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
the rule change is that transparent tx to notary pubkey is allowed
there are no superpowers

[24-Sep-18 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no constraint on who can send to the notary pubkey

[24-Sep-18 08:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
dev branch both iguana and kmd then ?

[24-Sep-18 08:27 AM] Mylo#8306
is this rule change already live, or do NNs need to update komodod?

[24-Sep-18 08:27 AM] Mylo#8306
_looks in rpcwallet.cpp after reading history_

[24-Sep-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
the code is live, but unless you updated very recently (last 12 hrs), you need to update

[24-Sep-18 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
dev branch and even beta should support the new PIRATE rules

[24-Sep-18 09:01 AM] Mylo#8306

[24-Sep-18 09:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
is z_sendmany allowed for t addr ?

[24-Sep-18 09:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
just read about pubkey

[24-Sep-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
at the rpc level as I said there is a missing exception so it will give an error, even though it is allowed and can be fixed if the if statement is fixed

[24-Sep-18 01:23 PM] Mylo#8306
I might have a chance to look at src later this week if not done by someone else by then.  I‚Äôd like to have a crack at it.  Will be exploring more of the codebase over coming weeks
