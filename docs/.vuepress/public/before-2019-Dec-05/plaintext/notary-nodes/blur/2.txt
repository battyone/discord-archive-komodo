i can help you write stuff regarding this , try to explain it, whatevs

that is a good quote.   if it was submitted anonymously, i would accept it too üòÉ

I started mining BLUR a long time ago, which led to all this

[16-Apr-19 04:42 AM] Mylo#8306
only doing a brief mention, will send you a DM with it later, cheers

[16-Apr-19 04:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
BLUR is very interesting, by itself. Adding DPoW, well it's super interesting

[16-Apr-19 04:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo you don't need to quote me either, was just joking üòÉ I think it's an exciting project

[16-Apr-19 04:43 AM] Mylo#8306
"...it has been said....that blur is interesting...." üòõ

[16-Apr-19 04:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
BLUR = CPU only solo mining only XMR fork

[16-Apr-19 04:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
just that, is suuuuper interesting

[16-Apr-19 04:43 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah when you said cpu mining my ears pricked up the other day

[16-Apr-19 04:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's one of the better coins to CPU mine right now, imho, as a speculative CPU miner goes

[16-Apr-19 04:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
no GPUs, no FPGAs, no ASICs, it's a dream for CPU miners

[16-Apr-19 02:34 PM] Alright#0419
how can they enforce solo mining only?

[16-Apr-19 04:00 PM] phm87#7395
What is the name of the algo ? Does Blur use XMR rpc style or ZEC/BTC ?

[16-Apr-19 04:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@phm87 CryptoNote Dynamic, which evolved from CryptoNote Adaptive, I believe. @Biz invented it, or borrowed from others and improved, not sure

[16-Apr-19 04:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright very interesting algorithms inherited from XNV (Nerva) coin which BLUR source forked from, basically there are things that prevent a pool from ever existing

[16-Apr-19 04:13 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you

[16-Apr-19 04:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
the last few blocks are mixed into what the next block must be, many things are constantly changing

[16-Apr-19 04:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
things in the block header, I don't fully understand but @Biz could

[16-Apr-19 04:14 PM] phm87#7395
Similar to x16r maybe

[16-Apr-19 04:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's not many algos changing

[16-Apr-19 04:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's like many params in an algo constantly changing

[16-Apr-19 04:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
and you must be a full node to constantly know what you do include in your valid block

[16-Apr-19 04:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is how i understand it

[16-Apr-19 04:14 PM] phm87#7395
Yes

[16-Apr-19 04:15 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you. I will have a look for my pool

[16-Apr-19 04:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@phm87 the point of BLUR is to not allow pools üòÉ

[16-Apr-19 04:15 PM] phm87#7395
Ooooh

[16-Apr-19 04:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
but maybe a BLUR solo pool would be possibe

[16-Apr-19 04:16 PM] Alright#0419
connect several miners to a single full node?

[16-Apr-19 04:16 PM] Alright#0419
what prevents that

[16-Apr-19 04:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright there are ways to prevent it, i think you should try to break it

[16-Apr-19 04:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Biz just so you know, @Alright is our resident breaker, and pentested DPoW on our Hush chain. He finds bugs in blockchains with ease

[16-Apr-19 04:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
I would love to see what @Alright can break

[16-Apr-19 04:17 PM] phm87#7395
Few coins tried to make this (hdac as example). I don t see what can forbid pools. I am more interested now

[16-Apr-19 04:17 PM] Alright#0419
not quite ease

[16-Apr-19 04:17 PM] Alright#0419
more like throw shit at the wall and see what sticks

[16-Apr-19 04:17 PM] Alright#0419
try everything no matter how unlikely it is to work

[16-Apr-19 05:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
that explains some stuff

[16-Apr-19 05:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
XNV and BLUR both have different variants of Cryptonote Adaptive, iirc

[16-Apr-19 05:15 PM] dukeleto#7326

Oh wow I missed a lot here. Sorry. Catching up now

[17-Apr-19 07:48 AM] Biz#0842
@dukeleto pretty good synopsis. A couple things slightly off, but over all very good. 

1.) CryptoNote is a protocol. CryptoNight is the hashing algorithm. They are worth being separate, in my opinion. 
2.) Being fully transparent, nothing about our current algorithm *prevents* pooled mining, just as CryptoNight-adaptive did not. In the long run, that may prove an exercise in futility. Rather than trying to remain pool resistant, we‚Äôre going to look to incentivize solo mining and try to make pools illogical. 

Why resist what miners *want* when you can make them *want something else*? I think incentives are what drove us here in terms of spec mining hardware, and pools... and I believe only incentives, with some help from faction-based inclusion of all miners and hardware, can correct the course we‚Äôve been running off toward. 

Our algorithm in CN-Dynamicv2 makes use of the previous blocks hash, a current timestamp from the daemon being hashed on, and the block height to create variation on an both, an inter-block and intra-block basis.  Most notably the the PRNG afforded by the previous block‚Äôs hash contributes the largest portion of this variation. We take the first 6 characters from the hash in hex, interpret that as an integer, and use it as a necessary variable in the calculation for iterations that are used at various points within the CryptoNight algorithm. Using constants in that calculation that aren‚Äôt known at compile time is what makes our algorithm CPU-specific. 

The unique algorithm has the added bonus of making our current implementation non-compatible with current pooled software. That‚Äôs very far from saying it couldn‚Äôt be done. These things will always find a way if incentives are there. This is why we don‚Äôt want to play cat-and-mouse. Our job is to make the mouse faster, and give the cat a new activity as well üòâ

[17-Apr-19 07:50 AM] Biz#0842
@Alright I‚Äôve been dying for a good audit/pen-test kind of thing. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be able to find some fun stuff. I‚Äôve found a ton myself already, but this has been (for me and our community) in large part a case-study of Monero‚Äôs tech, as well as experimentation to see what‚Äôs possible through application-based learning.  I feel strongly that unless the tech is tested, it‚Äôs well... not worth much.

[17-Apr-19 07:51 AM] Biz#0842
Only way we find that out is by seeing what falls apart when things get pushed. I don‚Äôt view attacks on blockchains as much of a problem really. If things get fixed in the end, it‚Äôs a good thing.

[17-Apr-19 07:59 AM] Biz#0842

**An update on the state of DPoW integrations for BLUR (06/04/2019):**

Hey all, just wanted to keep everyone over here in KMD world informed on the changes taking place with regard to DPoW.  

Porting all of the BTC-derived code is taking a while, but things are moving along smoothly... particularly as of late.  Things finally beginning to click between XMR-BTC, mentally speaking.

At the following repo you'll see some recent changes (not all have been pushed yet, as I am trying to keep that repository in a state that actually builds without treating warnings as errors): https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur

[05-Jun-19 07:09 AM] Biz#0842
**Among those changes that have been pushed are:**

- There is now a binary that builds with the set of blur-specific bins that is titled `blur-notary-server-rpc`.  This will become the binary that will create the notarization transactions on BLUR's chain, once  the data has been written to into a raw btc transaction. 
- That raw BTC data is going to be affixed to the 'extra' field of a BLUR transaction.  This subfield in the `tx_extra` will be prefixed by a leading byte of `0x05` which will be unique to notarization transactions.  I am going to attempt to keep that an authenticated field, meaning only NN secret keys will be able to create this type of transaction (ideally).
- Can't promise the authentication, since this field is not verified for content by any node (as far as consensus goes). But since we are making changes to consensus anyway, I figure its worth a shot (really just mitigates performance hit from verification happening too often). 
- If you wish to compile that repo on your own you can also use the JSON-RPC calls for `notarization_data`, `height_MoM`, and `calc_MoM` to make a call to each of those three methods on the daemon.  I'll be adding documentation for these later on. 
- The above RPC calls will eventually be populated with data from the komodo state files, iguana's methods for merkle tree calculations, and all that good stuff.
- The backbone of the RPC calls and the notarization server are built.  So, what's left is a matter of actually plugging these functions into the RPC calls and making sure they work properly once that's complete.

thanks biz.  yeah i'll browse code (as a non-core weekend-coder) to see what how it looks at first step.   the commits for GAME's first dpow will be an interesting comparison.  duke is v.familiar with this kind of stuff.   cool project.

[12-Jun-19 01:04 AM] Biz#0842
@Mylo haha I think you will find things quite different from the GAME integrations.  I am physically plugging all of the functions into our existing interfaces.  So it will be very portable to XMR-based coins, but probably difficult to discern whats going on if you're using the BTC-specific integrations as a comaprison

[12-Jun-19 01:05 AM] Biz#0842
My point with that is -- no worries if it all seems very foreign. BTC seemed that way for me as well, until very recently. And even now it's murky at times

[12-Jun-19 01:06 AM] Biz#0842
If you do have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask! I enjoy helping others learn about our codebase where I am able to do so

Its been a lot of fun learning about BTC/ZEC/KMD & etc so far

[12-Jun-19 01:08 AM] Biz#0842
I think there are only one or two functions (outside of double sha256 and the cryptography stuff) that will be unmodified in their entirety... so it's pretty heavy porting of things

[16-Jul-19 11:26 PM] Biz#0842
**An update on the state of DPoW integrations:** here

**1.) Notary Node  addresses & wallet building is underway. You can see the beginnings of the address work  here: (https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/commit/1d4397c4da4b70eb3a66a911c4e3c78b1c138b53).**

Understanding how this will work with NN pubkeys, requires a little background on XMR addresses.  In monero's ecosystem, each wallet address consists of two separate keypairs (4 keys in total, 2 public, 2 private). These consist of a viewkey pair, and a spendkey pair.  If keys are truly independent (they are deterministic in XMR, but will *not* be for notary nodes), the private viewkey can be used by third parties to transparently view the transactions. This is possible without the viewer having any way to actually compromise the funds of the wallet in question.  

 jl777 and I spoke about about ways to employ the existing BTC pubkeys that notary nodes currently use, and avoid requiring submission of private keys of any kind... What we settled on was repurposing the current btc pubkeys as private viewkeys for  notary nodes on BLUR.  For the other keypair (spendkey), a new crypto library, built on Ed25519 and GIMLI permutations, called `libhydrogen` will be used to generate a high entropy secret spendkey.

This means that NN operators will only have  to provide their pubkey on startup of `blur-notary-server-rpc`, and a unique wallet address will then be generated.

[16-Jul-19 11:27 PM] Biz#0842
**2.) An extra parameter for dpowconfs has been added to the wallet, and notary wallets: (https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/commit/38d8a482302a57479d1b4e174d6b74145171e6d7).**

**3.) All of the types, classes, etc necessary from bitcoin have been consolidated into the directory `external/bitcoin` (which compiles as a static library).**

 I've also added a couple helper functions in `src/common/hex_str.cpp` for conversions between the two codebases. Converting from BTC style `uint256` to cryptonote's `crypto::hash` is pretty simple this way, and we don't have to do any crazy type-punning.

**4.) Unique `ntz_txn` tags & fields in the extra have been added, and have preliminarily been given a buffer of 4kB or so.** (https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/commit/f6deef44d41847c7e8125e40c606379cc325af27 & https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/commit/6ade53a6548c983dae100ef24159548ba188c999)

[16-Jul-19 11:29 PM] Biz#0842
**5.) komodo-related DPoW functions have been built with main lines into `cryptonote::core` via the `komodo_core` class.**  This class has a constructor that initializes `m_core` and `m_p2p` as references to `cryptonote::core` and `node_server`.  These are the two handlers that dictate consensus, effectively.

 - Here, core will allow us to load in state files, checkpoints, etc.  There are already placeholder functions (without bodies) for this.  You'll find all of `komodo_core` located in `src/komodo/komodo_validation.cpp & .h`

In BLUR consensus decisions begin in `core` and `p2p` as far as network communication goes.  These decisions are then finalized in `src/cryptonote_core/blockchain.cpp` where they are added to the blockchain, or rejected based on verification & hard fork rules.

Hello @Biz, I think we already discussed way back in the blur discord channel. I am just expressing my interest in co-developing the dPoW implementation with you in a Cryptonote protocol project. Since my company is starting a new project, and it would really help if I implement dPoW beforehand since we are still new, and we are starting a small chain. Let me know your thoughts. This is buggy super halfway code.

@josephnicholas GMT+8 to be considered real by many people, yes

[02-Aug-19 06:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
do you have a mainnet?

[02-Aug-19 06:52 PM] phm87#7395
@josephnicholas GMT+8  about the BTC ANN, from my personal point of view, please do it ASAP (maybe one day before launch of mainet) : as a pool owner and as a miner, I prefer to see one announcement that a good crypto will be launched today rather than to see a ANN of a coin launched, mined by few then announced. It is not a premine in my eyes but it is close to it. nothing personal here, I'm talking about the profits that we can do when mining a coin and when we read BTC each day (I stopped and I stick to KMD discord to find gems)

[02-Aug-19 06:54 PM] phm87#7395
I was really sad when another pool launch a coin and that I don't find any announcement or repo.
In addition, the BTC ANN will give you some visitors and some SEO/PageRank juice that is free and legit. Later, the same BTC ANN can be edited to show updated websites, links and so on
