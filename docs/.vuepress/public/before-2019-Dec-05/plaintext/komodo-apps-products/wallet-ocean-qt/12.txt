Am I good to go now?  I just wait for sync to complete?  Or do I also need to use the -maxreorg command upon startup to?

[18-Jul-19 02:28 PM] Catalyst#8405
i guess use the -maxreorg .. helped me really quick

[18-Jul-19 03:00 PM] spudboy999#5256
I rebooted with maxreorg command prompt option and I am fully synced now.....WOOOOO HOOOO!

Please I tried to install Komodo Ocean QT but I am having error message as                                                    
Cannot find the Zcash network parameters in the following directory:
"C:\Users\'''''\Appdata|\Roaming\ZcashParams"
Please run 'zcash-fetch-params' or './zcutil/fetch-params.sh' and then restart."

[19-Jul-19 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@9jŒ± NiŒ∑JŒ± use `fetch-params.bat` included in the zip file

[19-Jul-19 12:54 PM] 9jŒ± NiŒ∑JŒ±#1533
and why do I get this fetch-params.bat

[19-Jul-19 12:55 PM] 9jŒ± NiŒ∑JŒ±#1533
I saw it, I run it but nothing happen

[19-Jul-19 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
there are certain "proving keys" needed to make zero knowledge proofs work in equihash
these same keys are used for all zcash based chains

[19-Jul-19 12:57 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`I run it but nothing happen`
run it from cmd (not by clicking it) and you'll see it download the files

[19-Jul-19 01:02 PM] 9jŒ± NiŒ∑JŒ±#1533
yes, I click it to run

Synchronize the wallet, the display is connecting to the node, but there are 15 active connections in the lower right corner of the wallet, which can't be completed synchronously. How can I do this?

@weldon.gull5 @NO_CPU 
please ensure you are using this release specifically. the version number might seem to be similar but USE ONLY THIS ONE and delete your old downloaded one  https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-4
then, check what block you are in. use `getinfo` call from **Help > Debug Window** to find it.
once you found the block number, e.g: for block 1444008 use `getblockhash 1444008`
once you have the hash for the block you are stuck at, use `invalidateblock <BLOCKHASH>` without `<>` like the command below
once that is done, use `reconsiderblock 035ee329fe10944f1b0bf659a8b8d2424322b98532deba0fe225f26eb350fdb2`
wait for the daemon to get on mainchain which might take some time

if you get an error like this https://i.imgur.com/Ba4PLhih.jpg
stop KomodoOceanQT wallet and lauch with `-maxreorg=300`
follow this guide to do that https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000030462-starting-the-komodooceanqt-wallet-with-command-line-parameters-in-windows

[21-Jul-19 12:21 PM] ParliamodiCrypto#6833
Hello. I have the last version of qt wallet (2.0.15), but I have an issue with the sync. Is stopped at 99.73% from 16/07/19  17h53m21s. What i can do to fix? Thanks. @Angelina

[21-Jul-19 12:26 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@ParliamodiCrypto update your g28-3 to g28-**4**

Also, no more linux support?

I follow the instruction, but the answer in "null" when I put "invalidateblock ....

[21-Jul-19 06:16 PM] SHossain#0007
then, issue the next command as i stated in my instructions

[21-Jul-19 06:16 PM] SHossain#0007
@guttermonk can you post more details of the checksum? which file exactly you are trying to verify.

[21-Jul-19 06:17 PM] SHossain#0007
Linux, macOS and Windows is supported

i tried, but is still in the same date of sync

[21-Jul-19 06:51 PM] SHossain#0007
@ParliamodiCrypto the last resort you could try is start the wallet with `-reindex` option. but, i guess before that you can try using bootstrap https://bootstrap.dexstats.info/KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz

[21-Jul-19 06:54 PM] ParliamodiCrypto#6833

how long does it takes to "read" / sync the downloaded blocks from bootstrap for komodo ? waiting now for about 2 hours, is it normal that long ?
the status is "loading block index"

[25-Jul-19 02:46 PM] gcharang#6833
@akaneo it depends on the OS and system specs
windows usually takes longer
