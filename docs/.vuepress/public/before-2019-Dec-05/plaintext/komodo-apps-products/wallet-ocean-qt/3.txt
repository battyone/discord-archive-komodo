@Hermes You'll need to create `komodo.conf` file manually, before start, as shown in README: https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/blob/master/README.md . If you already created `komodo.conf` - show it's content here, possibly it contains some errors.

Important note to all **Komodo-Qt (KomodoOcean)** users according to new features coming on December 15 - https://komodoplatform.com/upgrade-guide-dec-15/ . As we are all know coming update brings a lot of new features, such as sapling, VerusHash algorithm and others. This is a massive update that includes changes to over 500 different source files and adding new dependencies. Komodo-Qt will follow original komodod branch and will updated too as soon as possible, but this hard work unfortunatelly will not be finished to 15 Dec (!), in this way all komodo-qt users should temporarily switch to use original komodo daemon (komodod) or Agama, until update for komodo-qt will be released. All your funds are safe, just backup `wallet.dat` and continue to use your `wallet.dat` from Komodo-Qt with komodod or Agama, or export your privkeys from Komodo-Qt using `z_exportwallet` and import them into komodod with `z_importwallet`. 

We will keep you informed about current state of Komodo-Qt and coming updates, but keep in mind that current version of Komodo-Qt will be incompatible with new changes after sapling is activated, so, you should temporary stop using it and switch to other wallet.

I  am actively mining Komodo; however when I started the first valid wallet I found was in the Coinomi wallet on my phone.  Is there any additional action I should take?  Please advise ... thank you.  I look forward to downloading the new desktop wallet once  the  link is active on Komodo home page.  Very Respectfully, WX2

I plan to download the update for the desktop wallet when it is available  but was trying to be proactive in the even their was something I either needed to do, or not do during the update; ie. like not try to move the coins during that time .. this is what I was trying to find out. thx.

Few words about "copyZSendMany[from/to] template context menu". As you are know the GUI for Z-addresses transactions is under developement now, but we actually need a way to send it right now. To get this process easy without full-featured GUI, wallet now have z_sendmany templates. Here is a small demo video "how it works":

It's a fresh start without wallet.dat or start with already existing wallet.dat ?

[18-Dec-18 01:02 PM] Decker#3767
This can happen if the wallet is encrypted or locked. So try to backup your old wallet.dat (if you use it) and start it fresh.

Small demo video that illustrates how you can use current version of Komodo-Qt (KomodoOcean) with PIRATE assetchain. At this time Komodo-Qt have full support of z-transactions with Sapling and Sprout addresses, but GUI part for work with z-transactions is still in developent. Even so, you can use it for KMD or any assetchain, including PIRATE, and make private transactions.

@Decker  Before updating the wallet.dat, can't I use it?

[19-Dec-18 12:36 PM] 花果山#5224
If you use the pre-update wallet.dat, always report an error and exit automatically.

[19-Dec-18 02:20 PM] Decker#3767
@花果山 wallet encryption thing is highly expiremental, we leave it "as is" for users who wanna to test it. but the main plan is to remove wallet encryption from GUI totally. what about pre-update wallet.dat you can use following way:

1. start previous version of komodo-qt, unlock your wallet and export it using `z_exportwallet`.
2. rename your wallet.dat in wallet.dat.bak
3. start new version of komodo-qt, it will create new wallet.dat file
4. import all your privkeys using export file create on step 1 using `z_importwallet`
5. use it as usually ...

Dark mode looking sexy

@PTYX somehow the QT wallet inherited the macOS Mojave dark theme. generally it looks like normal QT wallet like other ones.

Testing...QT wallet is getting better

What's the difference between using Agama vs QT? Is QT more user friendly?

[13-Jan-19 09:27 AM] Decker#3767
Qt has a well-known Bitcoin Core interface with it's own features, like advanced Coin Control Feautures (you can select specify utxos for sending or combining), it's not an GUI shell on komodod, like Agama in native mode, it has "daemon inside", so, it's "standalone wallet". And it fully written in C/C++ and Agama uses NodeJS, so, it should be little bit faster. 

What to use Agama or Komodo-Qt - it's a matter of personal preferences. For me - Komodo-Qt it's a main wallet, but when i need SPV (Electrum), i'm using Agama.

@Decker thank you for the explanation. how do I claim kmd rewards on the QT wallet? Is there a QT wallet for pirate?

[13-Jan-19 07:21 PM] SHossain#0007
You need to send full balance to self to collect reward.

[13-Jan-19 07:21 PM] SHossain#0007
Yes, you can use all assetchains using this QT wallet

[13-Jan-19 07:22 PM] SHossain#0007
go to `Launch_assets` folder and double click on the Pirate file to launch pirate wallet

[13-Jan-19 08:04 PM] cipi#4502
is it possible to tell the QT-wallet to connect to an already running komodod? under linux... of course 😉
