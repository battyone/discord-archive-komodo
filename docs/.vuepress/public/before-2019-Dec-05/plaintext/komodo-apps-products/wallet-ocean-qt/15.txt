@Dahr the Ocean wallet is a native wallet. It downloads the blockchain and has a wallet.dat
the wallet.dat file has to be backedup after every transaction

[28-Aug-19 05:00 AM] gcharang#6833
@billy2four what dahr said above is correct

[28-Aug-19 02:28 PM] Dahr#7950
@gcharang thanks!

Hi Mac Users! Tried to import private key from Swing Wallet via Console 'importprivkey'. Balance still zero. Any idea?

[31-Aug-19 07:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
after importing privkey, chain needs to rescan. you can check progress in debug.log, balance wont display correctly until complete

[31-Aug-19 07:28 AM] gcharang#6833
he was importing the wrong private key

Hi everyone.  I have a question.  In both my Agama and QT wallets, it gets stuck on a a % when I open it  and it starts downloading the recent blockchain.  What do I do?  I have installed the newer version and tried a different wallet.

@WienerKickstand https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024517-agama-stuck-on-activating-best-chain
make sure to backup the wallet.dat!

Thanks heaps @Oszy

[04-Sep-19 04:20 AM] MetaJames#2985
I still haven't been able to claim rewards. I don't get the reply "because you don't get the reward for spending KMD until you spend KMD" Spend, how? Why should someone have to spend KMD? Spend as in make an outgoing transaction first? Please elaborate.

[04-Sep-19 05:44 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Komodo rewards are a reward for using KMD. That's why you earn more rewards if you use KMD once a month than it you only use KMD once a year.
You can get your reward by sending a transaction. That transaction can be any transaction, even sending your balance to yourself; however, there must be **a** transaction or else there's no way for the new coins to be created.

[04-Sep-19 12:51 PM] gcharang#6833
@MetaJames just send the coins to your own address, that will add your rewards to your balance
check here the rewards your address has accrued: https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/rewards

[04-Sep-19 10:33 PM] MetaJames#2985
Should I just Z-Send all of the funds back to my wallet address in the core wallet?

[05-Sep-19 04:44 AM] CHMEX#0686
KMD does not support z-trx anymore use PIRATE for that.
To claim rewards send the complete balance to yourself and you receive the reward. Simple transparent transaction.

[06-Sep-19 07:06 PM] grapest#9272
Tried to send KMD from a native wallet within the OceanQT desktop wallet a few days ago but it still says 0 confirmations. The native wallet was setup using a backup Wallet.dat from the old non-varus Agama wallet. I'll admit I didn't read in depth about the hack a while back and I'm curious if there was a way to confirm if my wallet funds were effected then or if I'm just having a problem with the OceanQT wallet now.

make sure you are updated to the latest version: https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-5
open a terminal, navigate to the directory where the wallet is unzipped, execute the command
```
./komodo-qt-mac -maxreorg=300
```
or you could use a bootstrap https://bootstrap.dexstats.info/KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz

@hastrup if you are using QT wallet, `./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX getmininginfo` wouldn't work. All you have to do is issue the actual command in Debug Console. Check the DMs on how to get there (you already know). Just use `getmininginfo` there.

it does if you're in the directory that contains the komodo-cli executable

[25-Sep-19 05:25 AM] SHossain#0007
Yes, it would. But, he is inside the extracted dir of qt wallet which doesn't have komodo-cli

Constructive criticism -

Even though I sent myself my entire balance to collect my rewards, I still have the same balance, minus the transaction fee. It really isn't a great system to have to send yourself the entire balance to collect a reward. It sounds a little ridiculous to me. Anyway, it was fun. I'm selling. Maybe I'll become as holder again in the future.

[05-Oct-19 02:30 PM] gcharang#6833
@MetaJames#2985 as to the issue of not receiving the reward, your utxo needs to have lock time set to be eligible
all komodo wallets set it by default
may be you received the coins from an exchange which doesn't do it
check your address here, to see if your coins are accruing rewards

There is a simpler method of importing Agama / AtomicDEX seed in komodo-qt. By calling `convertpassphrase` method you can obtain WIF, which can be imported in komodo-qt via `importprivkey`.
