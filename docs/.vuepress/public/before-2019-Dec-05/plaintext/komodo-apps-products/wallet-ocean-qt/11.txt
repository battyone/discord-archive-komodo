I have tried to sync the komodo wallet...it syncs up but then after i close and reopen the wallet i get this error message 
"Error opening block database.

error in HDD data, might just need to update to latest, if that doesn't work, then you need to resync"

[08-Jul-19 03:38 PM] CombatWombat#0279

having some issues getting the kmd wallet to work on linux

[09-Jul-19 12:25 PM] jon_at_work#4397
i downloaded the tar file and extracted it. ran `./fetch-params.sh` and then `./komodo-qt-linux` and get an error about conf

[09-Jul-19 12:27 PM] jon_at_work#4397
`QStandardPaths: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR not set, defaulting to '/tmp/runtime-root'`

and a popup window with;

`Error: Cannot parse configuration file: Missing komodo.conf. Only use key=value syntax.`

[09-Jul-19 12:29 PM] jon_at_work#4397
any ideas?

[09-Jul-19 12:32 PM] SHossain#0007
are you running with VNC?

[09-Jul-19 12:33 PM] jon_at_work#4397
no

[09-Jul-19 12:34 PM] SHossain#0007
which OS you aree running?

[09-Jul-19 12:34 PM] jon_at_work#4397
linux ubuntu

[09-Jul-19 12:36 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`mkdir ~/.komodo`
then copy the conf file provided there

[09-Jul-19 12:36 PM] SHossain#0007
`QStandardPaths: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR not set, defaulting to '/tmp/runtime-root'`
i've seen this error only when i connected to my Ubuntu 18.04 desktop with tightVNC. the other error could be if you dont' have komodo.conf file in data dir. follow @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢'s instruction above

[09-Jul-19 12:37 PM] jon_at_work#4397

[09-Jul-19 02:50 PM] gcharang#6833
@CombatWombat which OS?

[09-Jul-19 02:58 PM] CombatWombat#0279
windows 10

[09-Jul-19 03:07 PM] gcharang#6833
@CombatWombat 
try starting it with the `-reindex` parameter

to do that,
follow "Step 2: Edit the properties of the shortcut" in
https://www.digitalcitizen.life/pin-shortcuts-parameters-taskbar-or-start-menu

to edit the shortcut of the qt-wallet and add `-reindex` at the end

[09-Jul-19 03:08 PM] gcharang#6833
then start the wallet using the shortcut
after the reindex is done, edit the shortcut and remove that option

[09-Jul-19 03:09 PM] CombatWombat#0279
alright ill give that a go thanks

Hi everyone I can not open my wallet.  I keep getting an error message stating, "A fatal error occured.  Komodo can no longer continue safely and will quit.  EXCEPTION:15dbwrapper_error Database corrupted C:\Users\mwr4mw\Downloads\komodo-qt-win\komodo-qt-win.exe in Runaway exception."  Any ideas how to solve this?  I have tried redownloading but it continues to pop up.

[15-Jul-19 08:17 PM] phm87#7395
maybe your wallet is not synced with network, do you see a blockheight in the WT wallet @ecbuddy  ?

[15-Jul-19 08:17 PM] phm87#7395
To know if a tx is confirmed, it is better to check on an explorer such as komodod.com

[15-Jul-19 08:18 PM] phm87#7395
and about wallet, please make sure to update to a recent release of KMD QT wallet because there were some mandatory updates recently

[15-Jul-19 08:51 PM] ecbuddy#8524
gonna re-open the wallet in a moment

they are "the same"
one way refers to a specific commit and the other refers to a "build number" of sorts

I havent received my last two mining payments from the mining pool so I restarted the Ocean wallet and it was stuck at 99.94% for quite some time.  So I exited that wallet and downloaded the latest version and installed it.  It  also is stuck on 99.94%.  My last block update was July 16th at  12:53:21.  With the recent changes that were  implemented do I need to open a port on my router  to allow block chain updates for this wallet?  Or is there another reason for the failure to update?  Like Windows 10 firewall settings or ?  I haven't made any changes or software updates (other than the Ocean wallet) on my PC.

[17-Jul-19 05:23 PM] spudboy999#5256
Both payments show as valid in the blockchain explorer and have many confirmations on them, so I know they are legit.

[17-Jul-19 05:27 PM] spudboy999#5256
I have the ASUS AC-5300 router.  I did update the firmware on Monday, but my wallet was receiving payments after the update so I am pretty sure that is not the cause.

[17-Jul-19 10:24 PM] Catalyst#8405
Good Evening
Guys i would like to ask that My KomodoOcean - Wallet is stuck at Tue Jul 16 22:53:21 2019

have you solved it?

[17-Jul-19 11:26 PM] spudboy999#5256
Mine is still hung up at the same time stamp too.  I sent an email to Komodo directly but so far no response.

[18-Jul-19 05:28 AM] James Wong#1593
I'm seeing the exact same issue on mac (v2.0.15-rc2-6d31f03-dirty)
Stuck on **Last block time** Tue Jul 16 10:53:21 2019

[18-Jul-19 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain, maybe the invalidateblock/reconsiderblock trick?

[18-Jul-19 06:13 AM] SHossain#0007 (pinned)
@spudboy999 @Catalyst @Andy. @James Wong please ensure you are using this release specifically. the version number might seem to be similar but USE ONLY THIS ONE and delete your old downloaded one  https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-4

[18-Jul-19 06:17 AM] SHossain#0007
then, check what block you are in. use `getinfo` call from **Help > Debug Window** to find it.
once you found the block number, e.g: for block 1444008 use `getblockhash 1444008`
once you have the hash for the block you are stuck at, use `invalidateblock <BLOCKHASH>` without `<>` like the command below
once that is done, use `reconsiderblock 035ee329fe10944f1b0bf659a8b8d2424322b98532deba0fe225f26eb350fdb2`

[18-Jul-19 06:18 AM] SHossain#0007
wait for the daemon to get on mainchain which might take some time

[18-Jul-19 07:30 AM] James Wong#1593
Got this message. Hope that's expected.
>A block chain reorganization has been detected that would roll back 267 blocks! This is larger than the maximum of 99 blocks, and so the node is shutting down for your safety.
