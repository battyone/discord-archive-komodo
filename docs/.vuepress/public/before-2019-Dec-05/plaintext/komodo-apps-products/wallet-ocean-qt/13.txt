[26-Jul-19 05:26 PM] akaneo#3021
just to update

[26-Jul-19 05:27 PM] akaneo#3021
i left it to sync for around 6 hours then closed it

[26-Jul-19 05:27 PM] akaneo#3021
i power off the vm and gave it 4GB ram and 4 core then started to sync again, it did sync in about 20 minutes

[26-Jul-19 05:27 PM] akaneo#3021
the issue was from low resources on the VM

[26-Jul-19 05:28 PM] akaneo#3021
updating this just in case someone may encounter the same issue

[26-Jul-19 05:30 PM] gcharang#6833

komodo ocean qt waleet rescanning to slow..

[27-Jul-19 10:59 AM] adi#0702
why its this happen?

[27-Jul-19 11:00 AM] gcharang#6833
@adi it could be because of low system resources and OS
it is slow in windows

[27-Jul-19 11:01 AM] gcharang#6833
also it should be `-reindex` if you have
```
error opening blockchain database
```

[27-Jul-19 11:02 AM] adi#0702

[27-Jul-19 11:02 AM] adi#0702

What I can do?

[27-Jul-19 11:53 AM] ParliamodiCrypto#6833
I start it with maxreorg=300

[29-Jul-19 04:58 AM] jctomic#3970
Hello I have been syncing the wallet for days and it‚Äôs stuck at 99.32%. Why ? I need to send coins to another wallet and I don‚Äôt know if I can do it while it‚Äôs still synchronizing?

[29-Jul-19 05:10 AM] jctomic#3970
Ok thanks will try that

[31-Jul-19 04:01 AM] MetaJames#2985
I'm trying to download the ocean-qt wallet, and encountering an issue.... It's the first time to install it on my PC. I'm getting the error - *Cannot parse configuration file. Missing komodo.conf. Only use key=value syntax* I'm using Windows 10.

[31-Jul-19 04:02 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
copy the komodo.conf that's in the zip file to %appdata%/komodo

[31-Jul-19 04:15 AM] MetaJames#2985
That worked, but now I am getting the ... *Cannot find ZCash parameters* error

[31-Jul-19 04:18 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
there should be a cmd file to fetch params that was in the zip, as well
open cmd and just drag the file into it and hit enter

[31-Jul-19 04:54 AM] MetaJames#2985
It worked, thanks

[01-Aug-19 12:57 AM] jctomic#3970
Hello. I bootstrapped as explained above (deleted files and folders and extracted as instructed) but the software just started syncing everything again from 0%. Is this what should happen?

[01-Aug-19 07:10 AM] gcharang#6833
@jctomic it must be loading the blocks
did it finish syncing?

[01-Aug-19 12:07 PM] jctomic#3970
Nope. I didn‚Äôt let it. I don‚Äôt want to wait days again. Can I recover my funds using another wallet software ? This one is not for me

[01-Aug-19 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
no matter what GUI you pick, you need to let the sync finish (unless you use a "lite" mode type thing where someone else stores the full chain)
that's how blockchains work

[01-Aug-19 12:20 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
also, if the GUI truly "just started syncing everything again from 0%", then it's possible you placed the files in the wrong location (unless you mean "rescan" and not "syncing")

[01-Aug-19 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
extreme data corruption is the only reason that it would disregard all data and start syncing from block 0

[01-Aug-19 03:19 PM] jctomic#3970
Yup. Probably messed up. No problem. Will figure it out. Someday

[01-Aug-19 03:20 PM] gcharang#6833
@jctomic did you use a native wallet before or your coins currently in a address created using a seed phrase?

[01-Aug-19 03:22 PM] jctomic#3970
Used agama until the problem and moved coins to this wallet. Then the neverending syncing. Bored üòë

[01-Aug-19 03:23 PM] gcharang#6833
which OS are you using?
I can help you use this wallet properly or help you move your coins to agama

[01-Aug-19 03:24 PM] jctomic#3970
Windows 7 old desktop.

[01-Aug-19 03:25 PM] gcharang#6833
@jctomic RAM ?

[01-Aug-19 03:25 PM] jctomic#3970
8

[01-Aug-19 03:25 PM] gcharang#6833
ok, it should work ok
do you want to try once more to correctly setup this native wallet?
or move the coins to agama?

[01-Aug-19 03:28 PM] jctomic#3970
Which is faster? Though I am not at home now so I cannot do it until my evening 6 or more hours from now. Thanks for the help

[01-Aug-19 03:29 PM] gcharang#6833
@jctomic agama is faster
6 more hours from now is past midnight for me how about after 12 hrs or in the weekend ?

[01-Aug-19 03:30 PM] jctomic#3970
Ok üëå will try to be here

[01-Aug-19 03:30 PM] jctomic#3970

Had to do a fresh sync of Ocean Qt and now seem to be stuck at block 1444268.  I am on Win 7 Pro.

[02-Aug-19 04:17 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Well, just gonna do a fresh sync again.  Ugh.

[02-Aug-19 04:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
If you're not running the latest wallet this could be the issue. there was a significant update that happened july 15

[02-Aug-19 08:09 AM] gcharang#6833
@agnewpickens were you able to sync?

[02-Aug-19 08:31 AM] agnewpickens#7393
@gcharang  Doing a fresh sync, my previous sync got interrupted a couple times anyway, I am patient, took me a month once to sync my ETH wallet during the Homestead days, when in doubt, do a fresh sync.

It's not like I was planning to do any selling, I am a long holder.

[02-Aug-19 08:32 AM] gcharang#6833
using a bootstartp is the easiest
if you tell me the OS I can give you the exact instructions

[02-Aug-19 08:33 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Nah, I am good, I can wait, was just wanting to claim my interest, it will be there when the sync is complete.

[02-Aug-19 08:34 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Need to get a stronger computer, the Ocean Qt is pretty resource hungry.

Hey guys, I'm new to Komodo. You can stake in the KomodoOcean wallet right? If so, do you need to keep it running to stake, or log in every so often to collect rewards?

[03-Aug-19 05:13 AM] MetaJames#2985
I'm reading the page on Komodo 5% Active User Reward

[03-Aug-19 08:37 AM] gcharang#6833
@MetaJames KomodoOcean wallet can be used
just open the wallet once a month and send the whole balance to yourself, that will claim your rewards

[03-Aug-19 06:55 PM] athenamoon#9528
hello. im using komodo ocean wallet for windows pc (latest version). redownloaded bootstrap and i'm still stuck at 98%, any suggestions?

[04-Aug-19 10:02 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Deleted everything but wallet.dat and komodo.conf in Roaming and tried a fresh sync, stalled on the exact same block, 1444268
