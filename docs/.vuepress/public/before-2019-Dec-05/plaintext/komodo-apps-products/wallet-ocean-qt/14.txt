I am on Win 7 Pro

[04-Aug-19 11:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@agnewpickens look in pinned messages

[05-Aug-19 12:36 AM] agnewpickens#7393
I got the error, how do I relaunch OceanQt with maxreorg from command line @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ?

[05-Aug-19 12:37 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Going to try to follow the guide, may need assistance

[05-Aug-19 12:38 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Think I got it 🤞🏻

[05-Aug-19 03:40 PM] arkiii#7710
im getting this error and not sure how to resolve. "A block chain reorganization has been detected that would roll back 267 blocks! (Komodo Ocean Linux )This is larger than the maximum of 99 blocks, and so the node is shutting down for your safety." any help would be appreciated..

[05-Aug-19 05:53 PM] phm87#7395
@arkiii look in the pinned msgs of this channel. Default max reorg is 99 blocks but here the coin daemon detected a reorg of 267 blocks

[05-Aug-19 05:54 PM] phm87#7395
You can read the previous msgs on thiz channel, I think that other ppl had a similar error

[05-Aug-19 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
you can start with -maxreorg=300 to sync up to mainchain even with a 267 block reorg

[06-Aug-19 12:57 AM] MetaJames#2985
So does the wallet automatically credit you when you open it? It shows a rewards balance, so is it already claimed just by logging in?

@MetaJames check that link out

[06-Aug-19 01:16 AM] MetaJames#2985
Should I include a fee when sending to myself?

[06-Aug-19 01:49 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yes, you should

[06-Aug-19 06:11 AM] jctomic#3970

[08-Aug-19 07:56 AM] saskboy#5198
That link didn't work for me.
I've a question about the z send option too, is there a manual to explain it?

[08-Aug-19 09:18 AM] Oszy#5734
there is no z-send in KMD anymore

[08-Aug-19 02:49 PM] gcharang#6833
@saskboy are you trying to use Pirate?

[08-Aug-19 07:25 PM] Warkid#2117
Recompiled today, still stuck at block 1444268, no change to see

[08-Aug-19 07:25 PM] Warkid#2117
pleas help!

[08-Aug-19 07:30 PM] phm87#7395
@Warkid  I don't use ocean qt but when I made a search in discord about 1444268 I found several other persons who encountered this problem. Maybe some good tutorial is in the pinned messages. My guess is that you are using an old version of the wallet
Warning: Whatever you do, please do not delete wallet.dat, keep seed and private key secret and backup them

[08-Aug-19 07:30 PM] phm87#7395
Oh ... I discussed myself about the error few days ago : see a few messages above:
https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/459072527323365390/607994559108218883

[08-Aug-19 07:31 PM] Warkid#2117
How can it be old version? I downloaded it today and compiled it!

[08-Aug-19 07:31 PM] Warkid#2117
Thank you anyway, checking the pinned messages

[08-Aug-19 07:31 PM] phm87#7395
Ocean qt should be a recent version and the maxreorg param should be used at launch, some explanations are in the pinned messages

[08-Aug-19 07:31 PM] phm87#7395
sorry for my wrong idea about the old version ... it should be the maxreorg then

[08-Aug-19 07:33 PM] Warkid#2117
Thx, will try the "maxreorg"

[08-Aug-19 07:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Warkid you need to stick to the static branch

[08-Aug-19 07:37 PM] Warkid#2117
git clone https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean --branch static --single-branch

yes, that one

[08-Aug-19 08:04 PM] Warkid#2117
This leads to Komodo Version v2.0.15-rc2-54b2722-dirty

[08-Aug-19 08:18 PM] Warkid#2117
Still stuck even with "maxreorg", checking the version

[08-Aug-19 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
54b2722 is from May, you must have done something wrong

[08-Aug-19 08:56 PM] Warkid#2117
Yes, for sure it's my error. Will wait for consolidation, sorry!

[08-Aug-19 08:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Warkid 
what do you get as a reply for:
`git status|grep 'branch' && git log -1|grep 'commit'`

[08-Aug-19 08:59 PM] Warkid#2117
nothing

[08-Aug-19 09:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then you need to reinstall git or your Linux build or something 🤷🏽

[08-Aug-19 09:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```$ git status|grep 'branch' && git log -1|grep 'commit'
On branch static
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/static'.

[08-Aug-19 09:07 PM] Warkid#2117
No problem, I have time! Will wait till the pre-release will be a normal release.

[08-Aug-19 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or....
just use it like the rest of us....

[08-Aug-19 10:20 PM] saskboy#5198
I've the same version with 2 weeks. Z-send is a button.

[08-Aug-19 11:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@saskboy 
The zsend tab still appears because its *use* is still enabled for __other__ chains (such as PIRATE)
As Oszy said, it is not, however, usable for the KMD chain
<https://komodoplatform.com/z-transaction-functionality-is-moving/>

[09-Aug-19 06:31 AM] saskboy#5198
What happens when it's used with an R address? I didn't remember/realize it wouldn't work, but it was how it appeared to be able to send from a specified wallet address, because it had a drop-down menu listing addresses to send funds from.

[09-Aug-19 08:21 AM] gcharang#6833
@Warkid you could use the latest release

Hello! I am wondering if anyone here knows the Linux command line to install Komodo Ocean QT?

[12-Aug-19 05:38 AM] David Jackson#9229
I've done it before, but can't seem to find the command line details on the Komodo website anymore...

[12-Aug-19 05:38 AM] David Jackson#9229
Think that's where I looked them up originally...

HI!! 😃 Just learned that the OceanQT can be used for THC, by launching to from the command line!! WHOOHOO! 
1st question, will the OceanQT be operated solely by the commandline?
2nd, can users still input `importprivkey` and `rewardlock` into the OceanQT to migrate their coins and initiate the 100kTHC lock function we have?

[13-Aug-19 05:42 PM] Exile13#4458
Handled.  Ty

TECH Support Question - Help! ...I had the KMD Ocean QT installed but it stopped working, so I tried to reinstall, but never could get it to work again. Then I just got a new computer and downloaded the Windows KomodoOceanQT from (komodoOplatform.com) and tried to install and got error msg "Error: Cannot parse configuration file: Missing komodo.conf. Only use key=value syntax."   ...I have spent hours trying to solve this problem. Please help. Thanks  --- UPDATE --- was able to install Zcash parms and update the cong file - now downloading blockchain -- hope to restore old wallet after.

[20-Aug-19 05:26 AM] David Jackson#9229
Just a quick question about uninstalling KomodoOcean (have installed on another computer, now want to remove from my laptop). Is it just a simple matter of dragging all the files to the recycle bin? Or is there more to it than that? (I am on Linux, running Ubuntu). Thanks heaps.

[20-Aug-19 08:02 AM] Oszy#5734
to remove komodo ocean
`rm -rf path_to/ocean_folder`
if you want to completely remove blockchain and other data as well
`rm -rf ~/.komodo` > this will remove every other assetchain data as well not recommended if you only want to delete KMD
to just remove KMD 
`rm -rf ~/.komodo/blocks`
`rm -rf ~/.komodo/chainstate`
`rm -rf ~/.komodo/wallet.dat`
`rm -rf ~/.komodo/notarisations`
`rm -rf ~/.komodo/komodostate`
basically everything from ./komodo folder

[20-Aug-19 08:03 AM] Oszy#5734
as From File explorer yes just delete them from the directories mentioned above

[20-Aug-19 08:03 AM] Oszy#5734
make sure you have a backup of wallet.dat / or private keys / seed

[20-Aug-19 11:26 AM] gcharang#6833
@David Jackson what Oszy said, but make sure to backup the wallet.dat

[26-Aug-19 02:30 AM] MetaJames#2985
When I click 'Use available balance' to collect rewards, it just selects all of my available funds, without including the rewards balance...

[26-Aug-19 10:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because you don't get the reward for spending KMD until you spend KMD

[27-Aug-19 05:39 PM] shak3nbak3#2279
Noob question – I'm trying to dump my private key in Ocean Wallet console, but my wallet is encrypted and it says `Error: Please enter the wallet passphrase with walletpassphrase first. (code -13)` where do I enter the passphrase

[27-Aug-19 08:51 PM] Dahr#7950
I just installed ocean qt on my mac. How come it didn't give me a seed like other crypto wallets?

put the komodo.config file in the komodo folder

[27-Aug-19 10:12 PM] Zach#9973
there was already a config file there but I overwrote it with the one I just downloaded

[27-Aug-19 10:13 PM] Zach#9973
I got the same error again

[27-Aug-19 10:14 PM] Dahr#7950
on windows I think on %appdata% folder. https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000027990-install-komodo-ocean-wallet-on-windows

[27-Aug-19 10:14 PM] Zach#9973
Yeah I looked in the right spot

[27-Aug-19 10:15 PM] Zach#9973
I went ahead and ignored it and I am doing a full resync, hopefully that fixes it. I was just hoping for a quick fix

[27-Aug-19 10:41 PM] Dahr#7950
Is it normal that the  ocean qt doesn't give the seed?

[28-Aug-19 02:04 AM] billy2four#0409
Hi I'm getting error message when I try to open the QT on my mac. Error:Cannot parse configuration file: Missing Komodo.conf. only use key=value syntax.

[28-Aug-19 02:04 AM] billy2four#0409
in the folder there are 3 files. feth-params, komod-wq and komodo.conf

[28-Aug-19 02:34 AM] ShitcoinWhale#7300
move the komodo.conf to a new location or delete it and restart the wallet, should generate a new one

[28-Aug-19 02:50 AM] billy2four#0409
still get the same message

[28-Aug-19 04:47 AM] Dahr#7950
Billy2four I copied the komodo.config in /library/application support/komodo/ folder it worked for me
