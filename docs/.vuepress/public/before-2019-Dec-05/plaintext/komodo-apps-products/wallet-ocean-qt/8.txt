no error on ocean qt wallet is passphrase first

[05-Jun-19 07:54 PM] Helly88#3715
but the wallet can't relax because the button for it is grayed out

[05-Jun-19 07:54 PM] Helly88#3715
the wallet cant entcrypt

[06-Jun-19 01:18 AM] Decker#3767
Windows users of Komodo-Qt probably will like installer (!), bcz it automatically downloads ZCash Params (if needed) and creates `komodo.conf` file.

@Decker That zip file didn't work for me and I kept getting an error no what matter what i tried

[06-Jun-19 02:27 AM] Decker#3767
If we are talking about Windows installer - there is no any zip.

[06-Jun-19 02:27 AM] Decker#3767
`komodo-qt-win.zip` - static binaries of Komodo-Qt for Windows
`komodo-qt-win.exe` - Windows Installer

[06-Jun-19 02:27 AM] Decker#3767
Feel the difference between zip with binaries, and installer.

[06-Jun-19 02:28 AM] Decker#3767
In case of installer it automatically downloads ZCash Params and creates komodo.conf, in case of zip with binaries - you'll need to fetch ZCash params manually and create komodo.conf, also manually.

[06-Jun-19 02:29 AM] Decker#3767
So, if you are not experienced with this, or don't understand what is the ZCash Params or komodo.conf file - read the docs, or just use the installer.

Excuse me, if the wallet is encrypted, how can I export the private key? How to decrypt the wallet first

[06-Jun-19 04:14 AM] Decker#3767
You should unlock wallet first.

[06-Jun-19 04:33 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
@Decker How to unlock? I don't see the unlock wallet option in the menu.

[06-Jun-19 04:45 AM] Decker#3767
Same way as in Bitcoin Core and other wallets.

[06-Jun-19 04:45 AM] Decker#3767
Help -> Debug window -> Console:
```
walletpassphrase "passphrase" timeout
```

[06-Jun-19 04:46 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
thank you

Hi, when i run ./komodo-qt-linux It says Error Cannot parse configuration file: Missing komodo.conf. only use key=value syntax

[06-Jun-19 06:54 AM] CryptAiz#8085
i didnt modify the conf file

[06-Jun-19 06:55 AM] CryptAiz#8085
all the parameter in the conf file are key=value syntax... or atleast they seem to be

[06-Jun-19 07:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@CryptAiz make sure no special chars in your conf file (like /, \, $,!  etc)

[06-Jun-19 07:15 AM] CryptAiz#8085
yup just checked it again.. no specfial chars

[06-Jun-19 10:27 AM] Decker#3767
@CryptAiz show us your `komodo.conf`, just copy it on pastebin.com and put link here.

[06-Jun-19 10:28 AM] Decker#3767
Also, show the full path to it on your system.

[06-Jun-19 11:06 AM] Helly88#3715
@jl777c When will a Trezor connection finally come? You can see what happens if you don't have a hardware wallet. On the Trezor page it says that there is no wallet from KMD yet. When can one count on it

[06-Jun-19 11:36 AM] Decker#3767
Hardware wallets is not 100% safe, bcz you can't be sure what actually you will receive with the next firmware update. It's a question of trust )

[06-Jun-19 11:39 AM] Decker#3767
Let's imagine, just theoretically that somebody hacked Ledger firmware update servers ) And inject a code to change a transactions before sign. You trying to send coins on address X ... Ledger shows you address X and needed amount ... but after you pressed a button, coins will be sent on address Y. Just a theoretical case, but also possible.

I have komodo-qt running , but I have not been able to find any hints on how to start assetchains in komodoqt - can anyone  please post a link to a howto if there is one?
so I have KMD blockchain native, and PirateOcean is a separate PirateWalletQt- but I can't seem to get CHIPS, BET, BOTS& hooked into it

@LocoMB - https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029967-launching-arr-or-redfox-in-komodo-ocean-linux-

[07-Jun-19 06:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Guide is for RFOX / PIRATE on Linux, but same process for other assetchains, and on other operating systems change the `./komodo-qt-linux` bit to the launch file for your operating system

[07-Jun-19 06:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
For CHIPS, use this guide - https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029965-moving-chips-to-a-new-address

[07-Jun-19 06:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
If you dont know the  params for the assetchains let me know and I'll get them for you

[07-Jun-19 06:26 AM] LocoMB#8593

umm.. the signup for the support platform - email won't get sent, but when I try gaina it says 'email already taken' - I tried two email addresses

[07-Jun-19 07:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what you need? I can try and help here or in DM

[07-Jun-19 07:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
otherwise, maybe try password reset?

[07-Jun-19 07:31 AM] LocoMB#8593
@Smk-High  - I'll wait a bit and try again later

[07-Jun-19 07:32 AM] LocoMB#8593
maybe the sendbot has a hangover or so.. but why are the howtos in a member area anyway?

[07-Jun-19 07:32 AM] LocoMB#8593
I'll just need to the cmd line params for launching ocean with different assetchains

[07-Jun-19 07:33 AM] LocoMB#8593
- whereas I have to say, it is possible to enter a convoluted chunk of params, it is not really nice to do so for each of a dozen chains one wants to start- which is why I never did it

Hey Im trying to open the new ocean qt wallet on my computer but Im getting an error

you can run `fetch-params.cmd`, or download manually and put in folder mentioned in guide

[07-Jun-19 07:44 AM] adamanto75#5195
i had a previous version of agama on my computer

[07-Jun-19 07:48 AM] adamanto75#5195
and agama is no more?

[07-Jun-19 07:50 AM] adamanto75#5195
and it looks like my funds were moved out of my agama wallet how do I get them into the qt wallet?

[07-Jun-19 09:18 PM] Decker#3767
@adamanto75 For Windows - use installer instead of binaries zip, it will fetch all needed automatically.
