gen node gets them all at 128

[30-Jun-19 06:32 AM] naezith#9757
then sends them to the provided KMD wallet address

[30-Jun-19 06:32 AM] naezith#9757
then mines one more block for that transaction

[30-Jun-19 06:33 AM] naezith#9757
at 129, I make "withdraw coins" button show up in the chain page

[30-Jun-19 06:33 AM] naezith#9757
which sends whole balance on demand

[30-Jun-19 06:35 AM] jl777c#5810
for chains with big supply (over 10 billion) the coins are generated 1 billion per block. also you cant send more than 10 billion in a single tx

here premined are sent automatically already

[30-Jun-19 06:54 AM] naezith#9757

hmmm I didn't know about that 10 billion stuff

[30-Jun-19 06:56 AM] naezith#9757
makes stuff complicated

[30-Jun-19 06:56 AM] naezith#9757
how should I handle them

[30-Jun-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
limit supply to 10 billion for now

[30-Jun-19 12:06 PM] naezith#9757

nobody really needs more than 10 billion coins, so we can deal with supporting it after the initial release. if we decide that it is important to support

[30-Jun-19 12:08 PM] naezith#9757
max was 2 bil already

[30-Jun-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
then it avoids the issue

[30-Jun-19 12:08 PM] naezith#9757
ah I remember where I saw 2 bil and set

I put limits depending on that docs so

[30-Jun-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
there were some bugs before and after i fixed them i found the exact boundary of 10 billion per tx

[30-Jun-19 12:17 PM] naezith#9757
should I change it to 10 b @jl777c

[30-Jun-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
best to keep it at 2 for now. if there is some big demand for it, we can boost it

[30-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Alright#0419
@naezith what is the significance of the number 128? arbitrary?

[30-Jun-19 02:58 PM] naezith#9757
I don't remember jl or ca told me about it for a long time but I think that's when premining of initial supply completes, no?

[30-Jun-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
ondemand chains stop mining at 128

[30-Jun-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
anything less than 100 is very easy to fork, so best to do at least 100.

[30-Jun-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
128 seems fine

[02-Jul-19 06:26 PM] naezith#9757
```
- CoinPayments button won't react more than once when spammed.
- Delete warning modal for DEX Articles.
- Using CSS em for everything, setting font-size to anything makes it look correct.
- Did a full test, chain creation and deletion works without any flaw. Definitely needs more testing though
- Fixed some img sizes.
- Safari: Fixed Generator Top Bar was breaking after making the window big and then small again.
- Safari: Fixed @media max-width values were not matching with Javascript window width, breaking the layout.
- Safari: Fixed ( - 2 + ) node count button was broken.
- Using - and + characters instead of collapse and expand imgs for node count incremental input.
- Fixed price was too small in order page for extra small screens.
- Added page loading icon to Chain Details page.
- Email field in Password Reset page is being filled automatically.
- Added Recovery code for 2FA.
- Fixed 'Require Fresh Auth' was not working properly if 2FA was enabled.

[02-Jul-19 08:03 PM] ca333#0118
@naezith pick t2.xl for now - we can still scale up if the demand gets out of control.

[02-Jul-19 09:52 PM] naezith#9757
done, new IP needs to be set `34.250.255.60` for `chainlizard.kmd.dev`, kinda urgent @ca333

Since in my `Order history` I can see unique ORDER ID for each - I wonder this one `- CoinPayments button won't react more than once when spammed.

@TonyL @naezith ac_private=1 won't work out of the box unless something is removed from the daemon

jl made it fail and added some message about using PIRATE

[04-Jul-19 12:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Seems I've not cliked "Save" when changed txs to private only and started chain with both txs allowed. Let me try once again with private only.
Btw all params summary review before launch and message like a "Are you sure that you want to start chain with the following params" might be helpful

[04-Jul-19 01:02 AM] TonyL#3577
But from code above it's obv that private only chain will not start, yep

[04-Jul-19 01:06 AM] Alright#0419
it is an arbitrary limitation, could ask jl to remove it

[04-Jul-19 01:07 AM] Alright#0419
doubt anyone will use it, but I don't see why it should be limited for the sake of promoting pirate

[04-Jul-19 06:54 AM] naezith#9757
okay so I am removing `-ac_private` option, right? @ca333

[04-Jul-19 06:59 AM] naezith#9757
@TonyL those TONY1 chain issues are not about CL right? one of them is about komodod, and other one is Explorer.  `komodod -ac_name=TONYL1 -ac_supply=250000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_end=0 -ac_halving=1000000 -ac_decay=50000000 -ac_perc=10000000 -ac_pubkey=02f76e2d7122dd3c731d15b845337826ce636a43d016e0eaf427fa53894ffdd957 -addnode=34.253.224.167 &`

[04-Jul-19 07:04 AM] TonyL#3577
CL as a product combines webinterface, SPV, explorer and komodod so it's global product issues, but not web-interface ones, yep
Not understand why blocks generating so not consistent, would be great to check nodes logs/state

connected my node and generated few blocks without problems -  so probably something is not ok with mining  (-gen) node

[04-Jul-19 07:19 AM] TonyL#3577
when you have time - could you please connect to it and check:
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONYL1 getinfo` 
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONYL1 getmininginfo`
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONYL1 getpeerinfo`

[04-Jul-19 07:20 AM] TonyL#3577
or maybe we just should mine with more threads on it for consistent blocks generation  🤔

[04-Jul-19 07:33 AM] naezith#9757

though this is too long already

[04-Jul-19 07:57 AM] ca333#0118
keep private param @naezith - no params modification unless it leads to critical states.

[04-Jul-19 07:59 AM] TonyL#3577
so it seems daemon on mining node hanged. it generated 321 blocks, then stopped and as I understand daemon not response now on mining node (it's not related to -ac_private issue - usual chain)

[04-Jul-19 07:59 AM] naezith#9757
@ca333 chain does not launch at all

[04-Jul-19 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
@ca333 -ac_private is deprecated

[04-Jul-19 08:00 AM] naezith#9757
kmd version     0.4.0a

[04-Jul-19 08:01 AM] ca333#0118
ouch - @jl777c why -we had private chain feature from the beginning and as a feature requirement.

[04-Jul-19 08:01 AM] naezith#9757
am I removing it or not

[04-Jul-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
it creates a chain that will have a LOT of support issues, also technically its anon set cant be that big and wont have the effect people want

[04-Jul-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
also none of the other features will work. exchange integrations are a nightmare, etc.

[04-Jul-19 08:03 AM] naezith#9757
if I remove it, we will have two options: "Public and Private" which does not put any params to komodod. and "Public only" which adds `-ac_public=1`

[04-Jul-19 08:04 AM] ca333#0118
@naezith in this case remove the mess

{Reactions}
👍 

[04-Jul-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe public only vs private available? just a bit of language to denote taddr only vs taddr/zaddr

[04-Jul-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
the GUI could always restrict to zaddr only, but as it is i dont think the wallets will fully support zaddr?

[04-Jul-19 08:07 AM] TonyL#3577
@ca333 Artem asking you to check DM asap

[04-Jul-19 08:08 AM] ca333#0118
it would have been a good feature to have, specially for R&D or test chains - AS discussed before we developed CL. anyway - we can orientate towards ‘technically non indicated’ deprecation - not a biggie for us.

[04-Jul-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
