Might be helpful to enrich it with totalsupply info.
I can deploy it to all explorers.

[24-Jul-19 05:29 PM] CHMEX#0686
And there is extended info
http://api1.barterdexapi.net/supply.php?coin=KMD&format=json
With I think I can also make accessable via explorer

[24-Jul-19 05:55 PM] Slyris#2880
@CHMEX I'm using dextats explorer so it's should work

[24-Jul-19 05:56 PM] Slyris#2880
Can you open issue with this feature request so i let you know when i implement it

[24-Jul-19 06:01 PM] CHMEX#0686
Ok will do

For the next features you want to see in the `komodo coinmarketcap` like thanks to open issues in the github repository with your ideas so that we can not forget them, it allows to have a discussion follow even if we can also talk about discord.

[24-Jul-19 07:19 PM] Slyris#2880
@CHMEX You're feature is done and in master branch

[24-Jul-19 07:37 PM] Slyris#2880
@Audo Hello

[24-Jul-19 07:37 PM] Slyris#2880
Do you have a link for downloading the core ui pro paid assets ?

[24-Jul-19 07:37 PM] Slyris#2880
So i can start putting it in the repository

[24-Jul-19 07:57 PM] jacman#4756
I‚Äôve never heard of this project before? Is this an open source decentralized version of coinmarketcap?

[24-Jul-19 08:06 PM] Slyris#2880
Not exactly is an open source coinmarketcap of komodo ecosystem related chains, coins, currency, tokens

[24-Jul-19 08:06 PM] Slyris#2880
@jacman

[24-Jul-19 08:07 PM] Slyris#2880
The channel is open since today only, that's why.

[24-Jul-19 09:51 PM] Audo#5667
@Mylo , do you have the core UI assets? Can you forward them to @Slyris ?

[24-Jul-19 09:52 PM] Audo#5667
@jacman the vision of this project is to become a dashboard that showcases Komodo ecosystem.

[25-Jul-19 05:51 AM] Mylo#8306
i have a licensed version of the coreui stuff, cannot be made open source.   what assets are required specifically?

[25-Jul-19 05:52 AM] Mylo#8306

I'm using coinpaprika api

[25-Jul-19 01:08 PM] Slyris#2880
so i will use information from coinpaprika

[25-Jul-19 01:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Slyris groovy, i have used coingecko api before

[25-Jul-19 01:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
coinpaprika seems nice too

[25-Jul-19 01:08 PM] Slyris#2880
i had some problems with coingecko

[25-Jul-19 01:08 PM] Slyris#2880
with their new version

[25-Jul-19 01:08 PM] Slyris#2880
i switched to coinpaprika according to @ca333

[25-Jul-19 01:08 PM] dukeleto#7326

Great, thank's a lot for this information i will add it in the repository

[25-Jul-19 01:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
all commits in that github org can be counted, the `MyHush` org

[25-Jul-19 01:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you can't count for an entire org, i can give you a list of repos

[25-Jul-19 01:09 PM] Slyris#2880
I support only list of public repository

[25-Jul-19 01:09 PM] Slyris#2880
for the moment

[25-Jul-19 01:09 PM] Slyris#2880
for the git stats pull request

[25-Jul-19 01:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, no worries. How many repos is reasonable?

[25-Jul-19 01:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
most of our commits are in maybe 5 repos, but we have a few dozen

[25-Jul-19 01:09 PM] Slyris#2880
Unlimited

[25-Jul-19 01:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, i can get you a list

[25-Jul-19 01:10 PM] Slyris#2880
It's will be stored in a cache anyway

[25-Jul-19 01:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, groovy. It sounds like you know what you are doing, which is nice üòÉ

[25-Jul-19 01:10 PM] Slyris#2880
Neat

[25-Jul-19 01:10 PM] Slyris#2880
Can you open an issue @dukeleto  With all informations and list ?

[25-Jul-19 01:16 PM] Slyris#2880
Thank's

[25-Jul-19 01:16 PM] Slyris#2880
Now that you talk to me about sideschains like `HUSH` I wonder if I'd be better off associating a repo list with an organization

[25-Jul-19 01:17 PM] Slyris#2880
Such has
```json
{
[
   "KomodoPlatform": ["repo1", "repo2"],
   "Hush": ["repo1", "repo2"]
]
}
```

[25-Jul-19 01:19 PM] ca333#0118
for most ecosystem projects the `KomodoPlatform` org will cover it. 
For a few projects like VRSC and HUSH this is necessary - yes.

[25-Jul-19 01:19 PM] Slyris#2880
Because for the moment we have:

```json
"git_repos_list": [
    "https://github.com/pbca26/komodo-omni-explorer.git",
    "https://github.com/jl777/komodo.git",
    "https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API.git",
    "https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/BarterDEX.git",
    "https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex.git",
    "https://github.com/jl777/chips3.git",
    "https://github.com/jl777/chipsln.git",
    "https://github.com/sg777/bet.git",
    "https://github.com/jl777/coins.git",
    "https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Mastering_CryptoConditions.git",
    "https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e.git",
    "https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs.git",
    "https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Documentation.git",
    "https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo-explorers-install.git",
    "https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean.git",
    "https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/marketmaker-cli.git",
    "https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/ScaleTestV2.git",
    "https://github.com/patchkez/scaletest_containers.git",
    "https://github.com/smk762/txscl_vis.git",

    "https://github.com/pbca26/agama-web.git",
    "https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/EasyDEX-GUI.git",
    "https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama.git"
  ]
```

[25-Jul-19 01:20 PM] Slyris#2880
Which are not specified to an specific Organisation

[25-Jul-19 01:20 PM] ca333#0118
however, we can list project-specific git-status for such projects - BUT i want the sum of all commits and stats to be under the "KomodoPlatform" umbrella since its the "mothership".

[25-Jul-19 01:21 PM] Slyris#2880
ok great

[25-Jul-19 01:21 PM] Slyris#2880
is RedFox considered as a part of KomodoPlatform ?

[25-Jul-19 01:21 PM] Slyris#2880
for example

[25-Jul-19 01:21 PM] ca333#0118
its an ecosystem project ("Smart Chain") - yes

[25-Jul-19 01:22 PM] Slyris#2880
```json
"coins": [
    {
      "coin": "kmd",
      "coin_paprika_id": "kmd-komodo",
     "mothership": "KomodoPlatform"
    }
```

so i will change the structure to that for example

[25-Jul-19 01:22 PM] Slyris#2880
so "hush" will be associated to his platform

[25-Jul-19 01:23 PM] ca333#0118
this split wont be really necessary - so you dont have to restructure according to the above struct

In fact KMD is the mothership of all ecosystem projects - even VRSC or HUSH

[25-Jul-19 01:24 PM] Slyris#2880
yes but when someone will click on the komodo page he wont see the github pages of HUSH

[25-Jul-19 01:24 PM] Slyris#2880
it's what i mean

[25-Jul-19 01:24 PM] ca333#0118
yes - we agree on this.

[25-Jul-19 01:24 PM] Slyris#2880
so We need to find a way of association

[25-Jul-19 01:25 PM] Slyris#2880
that fit to everyone

[25-Jul-19 01:27 PM] ca333#0118
so we are likely looking for :

```
"coins": [
    {
      "coin": "kmd",
      "coin_paprika_id": "kmd-komodo",
     "git": []
    }
```

where `git` is an array of github repo URLs.

[25-Jul-19 01:27 PM] Slyris#2880
ok

[25-Jul-19 01:27 PM] Slyris#2880
some coins will have same repository alright ?

[25-Jul-19 01:28 PM] Slyris#2880
anyway i already handle this kind of configuration:

```go
else {
        _ = glg.Infof("Repository %s already cloned", urlRepo)
    }
```

[25-Jul-19 01:29 PM] ca333#0118
for sake of non-redundancy we can flag ecosys projects that reuse the komodo repos and dont have an own git account so we dont have to repeat same config entry.
