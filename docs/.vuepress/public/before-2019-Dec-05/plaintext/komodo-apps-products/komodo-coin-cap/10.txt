Merged @dukeleto .

[13-Oct-19 05:57 PM] Slyris#2880
Now you need to wait for deployment scripts to upgrade to the last commit

[13-Oct-19 05:58 PM] Slyris#2880
@TonyL Should confirm you that would not take more than ~10min

[13-Oct-19 06:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Slyris thanks, i am a patient man. I just didn't realize I sent my PR into the void ðŸ˜…

[13-Oct-19 06:00 PM] Slyris#2880
That's why i telled you immeditaly the same day xD

[13-Oct-19 06:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
sorry I didn't see your message

[13-Oct-19 06:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
i left KMD discord for a few weeks

[13-Oct-19 06:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
so I didn't see

[13-Oct-19 06:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
but most likely, i just didn't see it. ETOOMANYCHANNELS ðŸ™‚

[13-Oct-19 06:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
glad to see this project moving forward

[13-Oct-19 06:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
let me know if y'all need anything else. for instance, it would be cool to render what % of Hush supply is shielded, stuff like that

[13-Oct-19 06:02 PM] Slyris#2880
Yes and there is 2 another project comming soon

[13-Oct-19 06:02 PM] Slyris#2880
gaming sdk and the makerbot

[13-Oct-19 06:02 PM] Slyris#2880
@dukeleto Is the shielded functionnality something special ?

[13-Oct-19 06:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
only some coins have zaddrs

[13-Oct-19 06:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD does not, ARRR and HUSH do

[13-Oct-19 06:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
most Antara coins have zaddrs enabled

[13-Oct-19 06:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
a few have them disabled

[13-Oct-19 06:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
not sure what you mean by "special"

[13-Oct-19 06:04 PM] Slyris#2880
Hmm

[13-Oct-19 06:04 PM] Slyris#2880
Where we get this information about % shielded ?

[13-Oct-19 06:04 PM] Slyris#2880
Let's say for a specific coin.

[13-Oct-19 06:04 PM] Slyris#2880
dexstats api give us this information ?

[13-Oct-19 06:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
nope

[13-Oct-19 06:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
but it could

[13-Oct-19 06:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
insight explorers can give it to you, maybe

[13-Oct-19 06:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
hush has an api endpoint for it, i must look up what it is

[13-Oct-19 06:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is a `coinsupply` RPC

[13-Oct-19 06:06 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but adding specific cases for specific coins is not a good idea

[13-Oct-19 06:06 PM] Slyris#2880
if i can have it through an official RPC call yeah

[13-Oct-19 06:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
i get it

[13-Oct-19 06:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have my own idea to have a site that compares all zcash forks, and that is where this idea comes from

[13-Oct-19 06:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have written lots of code to generate this data for Hush, which is  99% done

[13-Oct-19 06:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a lot of work and not something for antara, most likely

[13-Oct-19 06:08 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah ok i will check wait

Already gives the supply and as far as I know the coincap script grabs it from there so it should work

[13-Oct-19 06:38 PM] Slyris#2880
yeah ok it's should work so.

[13-Oct-19 06:38 PM] Slyris#2880
Thank's @CHMEX

[13-Oct-19 07:11 PM] TonyL#3577

[13-Oct-19 07:12 PM] TonyL#3577

[13-Oct-19 07:17 PM] Slyris#2880

[13-Oct-19 08:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
sorry bout that

[13-Oct-19 09:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Slyris not sure if this is useful, but our insight explorer has an API endpoint that gives our current supply: https://explorer.myhush.org/api/supply

[13-Oct-19 09:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
Coingecko and coinpaprika/etc use that

[13-Oct-19 09:17 PM] Slyris#2880
https://hush.explorer.dexstats.info/api/supply

[13-Oct-19 09:17 PM] Slyris#2880
we use this one

[16-Oct-19 09:58 PM] Slyris#2880
@PHBA2061 there is a problem with your pr according to the ci I cannot check for the moment I will check tomorrow if I have time for it !

[16-Oct-19 10:31 PM] PHBA2061#2530
thank you, take your time, it's not urgent, I saw that message about "The build failed.." too, not sure why

[30-Oct-19 09:43 PM] TS#6934
Hey. Are there Russian speakers here?
I was told to update the wallet to version 0 2 5. deleted, installed a new one, entered the saved SEED. It took 2 times to enter the password and 2 times to enter the PIN code. There are no test coins and transaction history inside. black screen. I donâ€™t remember the name of the old wallet. It was required to give a name.

[30-Oct-19 09:46 PM] Oszy#5734
this is not the channel for this question, please keep it in #atomicdex-beta or #support also no need to post the question in 4 different rooms, thank you.
