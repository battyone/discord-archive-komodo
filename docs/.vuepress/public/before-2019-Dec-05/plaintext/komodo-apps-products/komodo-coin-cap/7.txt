ok

[26-Jul-19 12:42 PM] Slyris#2880
Travis never get this error

[26-Jul-19 12:42 PM] ca333#0118
the repo is public - so it shouldnt.

[26-Jul-19 12:43 PM] Slyris#2880
Probably a miss git configuration

[26-Jul-19 12:43 PM] Slyris#2880
for me

[26-Jul-19 12:44 PM] Slyris#2880
Hmm

There is a private field: https://api.github.com/orgs/KomodoPlatform/repos

I could check it before cloning

[26-Jul-19 12:45 PM] Slyris#2880
If it"s an organisation

any frontend devs who want to tap into the api for dev, I've created an endpoint on the http://dragonhound.info/ domain
you can access via the endpoints in https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-ecosysboard/blob/master/docs/api.md
e.g. http://dragonhound.info/api/v1/tickers

@Ondalf I will check if we can this into yiimp. I hope that we have everything needed in the API. Maybe few non standard changes would be required

[31-Jul-19 10:32 PM] TonyL#3577
My endpoint port changed from 8080 to 80, and CORS enabled now

[07-Aug-19 08:29 AM] Slyris#2880

@Slyris do you know when the other informations will be available? Like website, github, twitter etc and the datas for the chart?

[07-Aug-19 08:40 AM] Slyris#2880
@turinglabs I have no date in mind I will ask @ca333 during my next meeting and let you know !

[07-Aug-19 08:40 AM] TonyL#3577
@Slyris I think I'm updated because output of http://95.217.44.58/api/v1/tickers became bigger üòÉ

[07-Aug-19 08:41 AM] turinglabs#2390
i need just that data to complete the frontend, let me know!

[07-Aug-19 08:42 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah ok @turinglabs  I will add something after my coffee, stay around I will ping ylu

[07-Aug-19 08:42 AM] turinglabs#2390
perfect @Slyris

[07-Aug-19 08:44 AM] Slyris#2880
https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/coins/kmd-komodo

[07-Aug-19 08:44 AM] Slyris#2880
It's will do the job I thinking

[07-Aug-19 08:44 AM] Slyris#2880
@turinglabs

[07-Aug-19 08:44 AM] Slyris#2880
But for coins that are not registered in coinpaprika we need to think about a solution

[07-Aug-19 08:46 AM] turinglabs#2390
coingecko?

[07-Aug-19 08:46 AM] turinglabs#2390
should have everything via api too

[07-Aug-19 08:47 AM] turinglabs#2390
https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/komodo

[07-Aug-19 08:51 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but again there is coin that are not registered

[07-Aug-19 08:51 AM] turinglabs#2390
we should use both

[07-Aug-19 08:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
nice üòÉ Now I just need more coin icons - http://dragonhound.info/

[07-Aug-19 08:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
coingecko is good, I've been using it for pricing data in mm2

[07-Aug-19 08:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
wont have all ecosys coins tho, might need to submit some

[07-Aug-19 08:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can we get mm2 orderbooks data to derive ecosys coins value?

[07-Aug-19 08:59 AM] Slyris#2880
@turinglabs One  api coingecko or coinpaprika is suffisent we just need to choose

[07-Aug-19 08:59 AM] Slyris#2880
between 2 models

[07-Aug-19 09:00 AM] turinglabs#2390
i will fetch directly coingecko or you'll parse the data in any case?

[07-Aug-19 09:00 AM] Slyris#2880
i will parseit

[07-Aug-19 09:00 AM] Slyris#2880
and giveit to you

[07-Aug-19 09:01 AM] turinglabs#2390
perfect, so i just need the final structure

[07-Aug-19 09:01 AM] Slyris#2880
i choose coingecko üòÉ

[07-Aug-19 09:01 AM] Slyris#2880
yeah

[07-Aug-19 09:01 AM] Slyris#2880
im on it

[07-Aug-19 09:01 AM] turinglabs#2390
i used a lot, it's perfect

[07-Aug-19 09:31 AM] Slyris#2880
you have now a field `json:"additional_data"` in the ticker, that contains the whole answer from coingecko, if you want me to filter instead of returning all this information let me know

i removed the github service that i written because i was not satified i will rewrite it latter in a more efficient way @Mylo .

[07-Aug-19 10:05 AM] Mylo#8306
ok - thanks for notice @Slyris i will make sure my bash scripts are maintained.

[07-Aug-19 10:06 AM] Slyris#2880
I will probably use only github API to be honest and additional api such as gitlab/bitbucket if needed

[07-Aug-19 10:06 AM] Slyris#2880
but don't need to clone the repository

[07-Aug-19 10:06 AM] Slyris#2880
We can detect the platform, and then fetch and filter the informations

I've updated, will check new api data fields this weekend and see how to integrate

[08-Aug-19 08:07 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I hope you guys focus on top notch pro reviews of coins and good info that will help people see which coins are good projects, which are scams or money grabs, or urealistic and so on

[08-Aug-19 08:08 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
information is the value added and will attract people

[08-Aug-19 08:10 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
three perspective: technical (blockchain innovation and security) + realistic business + confirmed wise honest team = these measured should allow for easy navigation

[08-Aug-19 08:11 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
btw reserve coinnavi or cryptonavi names if you like, as this is not only about the cap, but actually navigating among coin informations

[08-Aug-19 09:09 PM] Slyris#2880

it's not just axo, all of the asset explorers are down on dexstats now.

Do you have the same problem ?

[09-Aug-19 09:52 AM] Slyris#2880
seem's to timeout)

[09-Aug-19 09:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah noticed that when getting gateway error 405

[09-Aug-19 09:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the `coinsupply` RPC takes quite a while in CLI

[09-Aug-19 09:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
probably one worth doing less often (every 12 hrs or so) and caching, not sure how @CHMEX serves it
