[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #129: Scrolling problem in wallet transactions
@CryptoMark81 Thanks for info.
Will see what we can do with it.

[24-Nov-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
without a homomorphic crypto signing method that is supported by the blockchain, it is hard for me to see a way to do a decentralized 2FA. most likely these other systems use some sort of multisig with a centrally controlled (or decrypted) privkey

[24-Nov-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that if it is on the blockchain, it is on the blockchain and so everybody can extract the privkey

[24-Nov-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
if it isnt on the blockchain, then it requires trusing whomever to produce the key (or signature)

[24-Nov-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
just because someone uses the words "decentralized 2FA" to describe something, it doesnt mean that it is actually a decentralized 2FA

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #127: Impossible to view one's order in the context of other orders
Thanks for feedback.
I believe addition of general orderbook, as mentioned in #87 will fix it.
It is planned for future releases.

Hi, could you reproduce it? I've just reproduced the error once again. Agama version 0.5.9-2, atomicDEX version 0.2.7 on iOS.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #125: QR scan from Agama Invoice not working
After scanning the QR code, the following string is put into the address field:
{"address":"R...","amount":"1","coin":"KMD"}
which is not accepted as a valid address.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #129: Scrolling problem in wallet transactions
I can confirm this problem with 0.2.7 on iOS. It's impossible to view old KMD transactions since after scrolling down to them, after 1-2 seconds, the page "resets" itself and jumps back to the newest transactions.

[24-Nov-19 05:13 PM] wl#4107
When we introduce the desired amount to swap, the input of the asset we are trading for should be auto filled with the the amount based on the latest value. That way we know if the orders available are fair...

Right now I have to access coinmarketcap or another and see how much is kmd (for ex) and how much is rvn (for ex) and do the math to know if the orders in the book are fair or to set my own order...

[24-Nov-19 05:14 PM] wl#4107
That makes a hugeee difference in my humble opinion...

Performs similarly for me.
QR scanner supposed to read QR address to send to. And it's what it does in a way - reads json in Agama QR and pastes it to Address field.
We will consider to add json scans support as feature.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #125: QR scan from Agama Invoice not working
I had another instance with a QR code generated from an older version of the Ledger Live App (the wallet software for the Ledger Nano S hard wallet). After scanning its QR code, a string like 
komodo:R...
was put into the address field which was also not a valid address. Not reproducable with the latest version of Ledger Live app anymore, however. But still maybe something to consider.

anyone else having problems with ios version with latest version? coins keep disappearing from wallet page and whenever trying to create a swap i get error on get tradefee

[25-Nov-19 05:54 AM] Bagg#3100
yes... same happened to me. just came here to try to get to the bottom of it

[25-Nov-19 05:54 AM] Bagg#3100
i cant send from my wallet either. keep getting an error saying it is an invalid address

Have tried 2 addresses. 1 at binance and 1 at huobi. Trying to send TUSD

[25-Nov-19 05:58 AM] Bagg#3100
both give 'not a valid address' error

[25-Nov-19 05:58 AM] Bagg#3100
my ETH wallet disappeared too

[25-Nov-19 06:08 AM] Oszy#5734
@Bagg enter the address on etherscan and copy the Mixed Case format of the address (which has upper and lowercase characters)

[25-Nov-19 08:01 AM] Bagg#3100
@Oszy Thanks. I no longer get that error now. I get a success message when I send however I don't believe it is sending. Hasnt reached the recipient addy for quite a bit. Also... can you explain the fees. I'm getting charged roughly 0.50 usd to send $10... seems very high?

[25-Nov-19 08:33 AM] Oszy#5734
Do you have a tx id we could check?

[25-Nov-19 08:54 AM] Bagg#3100
@Oszy  No... the app hasn't given me one which I find odd. I get a success message but then nothing else

[25-Nov-19 10:12 AM] Oszy#5734
Has it been deducted from your balance? Can you see it in tx history?

[25-Nov-19 10:13 AM] Oszy#5734
Might be a good idea to send your log file to @TonyL so he can have a look at what happened.

[25-Nov-19 10:22 AM] Bagg#3100
yeah nothing taken from my balance

[25-Nov-19 11:08 AM] Oszy#5734
So it wasn't successful after all

[25-Nov-19 11:08 AM] Oszy#5734
Can you please try and use the address format from etherscan I mentioned earlier?

[25-Nov-19 11:09 AM] Oszy#5734
or send the address and I'll send back the mixed case version

@Killascotoe @iamjosephyoung if you need an account and referral codes it's not a 'real' dex. A true dex is wallet to wallet trading where you are in full control of your own keys... Like @AtomicDex for example. $KMD

Anyone understand how their atomic swap process works in practise? On paper it looks a lot like atomicdex, but they dont show the technical side of things...

[27-Nov-19 08:23 PM] steinsg8#0288

[27-Nov-19 08:23 PM] steinsg8#0288
What DeX is safe to use at this moment (as an alternative to escrow)

[27-Nov-19 08:27 PM] Arno#3334
@steinsg8 Yes it's working and it's safe. I don't think there's another DEX supporting KMD yet.

[27-Nov-19 08:28 PM] Arno#3334
Even if a swap fails, your funds will be fetched from the temporary escrow address by the app after a while.

[27-Nov-19 08:39 PM] actionslacks#4072
It seems like decred is planning to have a considerable amount of human administrators oversee the swaps. I don't really understand the advantage of such a system besides complying with regulatory oversight.

```Penalties
The primary penalty for breaches of conduct is a ban, which includes loss of trading privileges, forfeiture of registration fee, and immediate revocation of any unfilled orders.

Less drastic punitive measures such as a cool-down period may be considered for minor, first-time or infrequent conduct violations.```

seems totally unenforceable to random pubkeys on the internet

It's probably just legal mumbo jumbo

[28-Nov-19 02:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

[28-Nov-19 05:42 AM] PTYX#6840
Yeah that would be an option

[28-Nov-19 05:42 AM] PTYX#6840
I see that as viable for a regulated market like derivatives

[28-Nov-19 06:12 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes,  this is why I suggested this functionality awhile back.  If the idea is to get exchanges and professionals involved they need to know who they are trading with  for compliance purposes.

[28-Nov-19 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
who manages the registration and blacklisting?

[28-Nov-19 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i would imagine they become subject to the regulations. maybe somebody wants to setup the registered DEX and make a special mm2 that uses the centralized DB of valid pubkeys. personally, i have no interest in such things, but i do understand maybe this is something that some people would want. nothing prevents this from being done, but it would take mm2 changes to automate the blacklisting

[28-Nov-19 07:07 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@jl777c  if a DEX were to create a modified mm2 would it still be sharing liquidity with the original DEX or is it its own system at that point?

[28-Nov-19 07:10 AM] gcharang#6833
if the only parts changed are related to whitelisting pubkeys, then liquidity will be reduced to only those pubkeys

[28-Nov-19 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
depends on the details of the blacklisting.

[28-Nov-19 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is a blacklisting only, then most of the liquidity would be shared, but if it requires whitelisting to trade at all, it would create a separate liquidity pool

[28-Nov-19 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, if there was just a single whiteliested pubkey that ran something similar to the CEX liquidity bridge, this would effectively pool the two liquidity together
