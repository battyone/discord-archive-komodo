@ca333 Wow, that's really great!

[22-Nov-19 07:06 AM] Mark81#4505
Hmmm... AtomicDex in is really good gor trading. So my idea for feature to add later on road is to make it able to change software keys ie. to gameplatform such as steam, uplay, origin etc for coins.  So trade keys for certain amount of coins or even better for certain amount of usd value for selected coins. User can list their keys description and set ask price for it.

[22-Nov-19 10:40 AM] Privatoshi#9487
How does someone ensure that they aren't buying the same keys, as someone else?  @Mark81

[22-Nov-19 10:43 AM] Oszy#5734
it's data in exchange for coins, i am not sure if atomicdex is the best for that idea. just set up a webshop with kmd / verus payment gateway and sell the keys for crypto

[22-Nov-19 10:44 AM] Oszy#5734
everything is possible but not in the current state of mm2 i believe

[22-Nov-19 10:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
guess you would have to tokenize the keys @Oszy ?

[22-Nov-19 10:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
only benefit to do so is you can prevent people from selling counterfeit keys or whtaever, but not sure how much of a problem that is in reality

[22-Nov-19 10:53 AM] Oszy#5734
even if you get a key that doesn't work, how do you get refund after tx is done?

[22-Nov-19 10:53 AM] phm87#7395
Hi,
I'l trying to test AtomicDEX-API, I was able to build it, thank you Oszy, TonyL, jorian and others. Now, I'm trying to do <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/blob/master/docs/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-tutorials/atomicdex-walkthrough.md> I'm following the document in the order it is written. After executing the command ``~/atomicDEX-API/target/debug$ stdbuf -oL ./mm2 "{\"gui\":\"MM2GUI\",\"netid\":9999, \"userhome\":\"/${HOME#"/"}\", \"passphrase\":\"xxx\", \"rpc_password\":\"yyy\"}" &
[1] 50855`` there is no output and I don't see ``mm2`` in output of ``ps aux | grep mm2`` Did I miss a step ? Should I replace ``HOME`` ?

[22-Nov-19 10:53 AM] Oszy#5734
also would have to include key as memo or something

[22-Nov-19 10:53 AM] phm87#7395
(maybe I should ask the question in #dev-marketmaker I'm not sure if it is the right discord channel)

[22-Nov-19 10:54 AM] Oszy#5734
looks okay to me ü§î

[22-Nov-19 10:55 AM] gcharang#6833
removing `&` at the end should show the output

[22-Nov-19 10:55 AM] Oszy#5734
ah yes

[22-Nov-19 10:56 AM] gcharang#6833
and check htop to see if mm2 is running

[22-Nov-19 10:56 AM] phm87#7395
I tried when removing it but I saw nothing. And no mm2 process in ps aux

[22-Nov-19 10:56 AM] phm87#7395
I can check htop but I think that I will see the same processes that I see in ps aux

[22-Nov-19 10:57 AM] phm87#7395
Nothing related to mm2 in htop

[22-Nov-19 11:02 AM] Oszy#5734
any terminal output at all? do you have to terminate it or it doesn't start at all?

[22-Nov-19 11:04 AM] Mark81#4505
Reputation system for sellers would be of course needed.   Sellers would buy these directly from suppliers and try to make profit in between. Joltfun.com is good site that sells games for btc.

[22-Nov-19 11:04 AM] Oszy#5734
I used g2a before. automatic delivery & everything. reputation / buyer protection

[22-Nov-19 11:05 AM] Oszy#5734
only missing paying with crypto

[22-Nov-19 11:29 AM] gcharang#6833
@phm87 I just built the latest and used the exact command you have posted
it works as expected
there is output and I can see mm2 in `ps aux`
maybe your instance is crashing ?

[22-Nov-19 11:31 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Are there plans for DEX asset to be made compatible to hold on a ledger (and receive the rewards which are going to be in KMD i understand)?

[22-Nov-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
you can just use the same address as your ledger KMD for DEX. you dont need to do anything with the DEX other than to just have it

[22-Nov-19 11:40 AM] phm87#7395
Ok I will try to rebuild it and retest. I had issues with rust, maybe I am not using the right rust version @gcharang thank you

{Reactions}
üëç 

[22-Nov-19 12:34 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@jl777c so i can send them right now to the KMD "app" on the ledger and hold then there? Will they be visible in the ledger live program?

[22-Nov-19 12:38 PM] gcharang#6833
@CoinKing88 say your DEX coins are in Address Raaaaaa in agama
and your KMD address on ledger is Rbbbbbbb

you can send the DEX coins to the Rbbbbbbb address and verify that they reached in an explorer
when the KMD rewards for DEX holdings are sent, they will be received by the Rbbbbbbb address

you won't be able to see the DEX on ledger live
if you want to move the DEX coins in the future, you will have to export privkey of the Rbbbbbbb KMD address from ledger and import it in Agama

[22-Nov-19 12:39 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Oke, thx for the clear explanation

[22-Nov-19 01:28 PM] phm87#7395
it did not start at all : no output at all. I used ``cargo build`` to build it, I'll rebuild it with the other command

[22-Nov-19 01:29 PM] gcharang#6833
@phm87 may be the channel #dev-marketmaker can be used for issues with mm2 cli?
more chance of people with the knowledge helping there than here

[22-Nov-19 01:30 PM] phm87#7395
ok thank you

Would be nice to find something by them or just to have a word in Discord.

@Hember  at least @runpaint  is here discord from COMMOD. So ask him questions what comes to mind.

Hi all, morning

[23-Nov-19 08:31 AM] Cryptakumi#6681
Komodo-team, I have an atomic swap that timed out. I tried to swap LTC to KMD. Now it seems to be ‚Äòreserved‚Äô, so I cannot use my LTC to try again.

[23-Nov-19 08:31 AM] Cryptakumi#6681
Any tips what to do? Btw, my other swaps worked out well, which is great!!

[23-Nov-19 08:33 AM] Cryptakumi#6681
Oh sorry, should have used the support channel. Will ask there.

[23-Nov-19 11:12 AM] runpaint#7773
@Hember actually Komodo team did all the code for COMMOD, and they host the mining pool and explorer, etc.  

My only real contribution is paying thousands of dollars to Komodo team, and continuing to pay them every month if I want the coin to keep working.  It barely works anyway, and AtomicDEX still says it's worth 0 even though it's being traded at Unnamed.  We never got a compiled desktop wallet, or an explorer with an API that CoinGecko can use, so the coin will probably be dead next month if I can't pay the monthly fee for AtomicDEX.

[23-Nov-19 11:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
@runpaint https://commod.explorer.dexstats.info/api/supply
commod.explorer.dexstats.info/
give those things to Coingecko and I'm sure that's all they need

[23-Nov-19 11:40 AM] CHMEX#0686
I'm happy to add some dedicated Text to the explorer if you provide it
The coin itself will not die just because its not on atomic dex there are enough nodes running to keep the coin alive

[23-Nov-19 11:42 AM] CHMEX#0686
unimining.net is a pool that has it listed

[23-Nov-19 11:50 AM] runpaint#7773
Well they want an API showing the coin supply

I see there are Kmdice and Chips on the oracle.earth mm2 orderbook but i couldnt find them on AtomicDex. Have they been added to AtomicDex in the new release?

[24-Nov-19 09:20 AM] Mark81#4505
Hmmm... Not sure but those might be tradeable through chainswap or pungo wallets. Those also utilizes atomicdex technology. And if you are able to dick through linux console and install marketmaker 2.0 then you can trade through linux console environment.

[24-Nov-19 11:02 AM] jkluwu0499#8218
Thanks for explanation. Not so familiar with linux :). Well I hope to see both Chips, Kmdice and other assets on AtomicDex soon.

Hi, is 2fa on the roadmap for atomicDEX?

[24-Nov-19 11:32 AM] taggart#9083
Some eta for the kmd assets on atomic dex, supernet, bet, bot rev and so on

I don¬¥t know how a 2FA can integrated in a decentralized system ? @cyrelb

[24-Nov-19 01:25 PM] Lennart#9331

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #129: Scrolling problem in wallet transactions
When you have a lot of transaction history in atomicdex wallet with certain coin and you go through those transactions by scrolling down them and every time wallet is updating transactions from spv servers wallet reset to most view history to most recent transaction. This makes impossible to check transactions in that time period especially when there are lot of transaction to scroll down and search it in time between checks from SPV.
