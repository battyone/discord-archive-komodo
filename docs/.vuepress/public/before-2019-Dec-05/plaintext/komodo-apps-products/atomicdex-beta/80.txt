seding to legacy ltc address?

[19-Oct-19 11:05 AM] amol#3287
I am not sure... Sending to this address
MWaQMGcptk7L7iVdPE36A6UQdFpVmoJD3P

[19-Oct-19 11:08 AM] ca333#0118
@amol not a "valid" LTC address - we support p2pkh L-address for now

[19-Oct-19 11:08 AM] amol#3287
Ok

[19-Oct-19 11:09 AM] ca333#0118
the M-address is the new p2sh format with 0x32 prefix byte - if not mistaken there is a tool to transform them though

[19-Oct-19 11:10 AM] ca333#0118
We will support more address formats in the near future - sorry for the inconvenience

[19-Oct-19 11:10 AM] amol#3287
Ok thanks for support...

Great work...

[19-Oct-19 01:16 PM] JvdP#8992
Don't know if this is a common issue, but my AtomicDex on Android just showed a black screen when I tried to open it. Had to reinstall and recover the wallet to get it working again. Issue started a couple of weeks ago and I had a lot of stuff on my hands, so I didn't fix it until today, but just in case it helps I'm reporting it here... 🙂

[19-Oct-19 01:20 PM] Oszy#5734
it happens when app updates

[19-Oct-19 01:20 PM] gcharang#6833
@JvdP a recent update caused this issue
it was just a one time occurance, correct?

[19-Oct-19 01:21 PM] JvdP#8992
Well it's been working since I reinstalled, which is about an hour ago. So it's been once so far, but don't have a lot of data to go on 🙂

[19-Oct-19 01:22 PM] gcharang#6833
cool, it should be the issue caused by the last update

No more stress test?

[20-Oct-19 05:11 AM] gcharang#6833
there will be an announcement about the stress test soon

[20-Oct-19 06:58 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
if only dICO were launched after the stress testing of the current version, then we would have made history

[20-Oct-19 08:35 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Gordon Komodo  that’s actually not a bad idea....maybe should wait for full release but a dICO or something DEX using variation could be great for bringing in new folks

[20-Oct-19 09:15 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
maybe called it something else, since 'dICO' didn't do great in the past

[20-Oct-19 09:19 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The media is calling them IDO’s

You mean dICO in atomicdex? It's so cool. I can't wait to see.

[20-Oct-19 09:40 AM] ca333#0118
This is already fully supported @polycryptoblog @Gordon Komodo - you can launch your chain within minutes on Antara Composer and get the atomicDEX mobile listing feature. In the next step you d announce your dICO and put up your initial cap as a market offering on atomicDEX (mobile) - this would basically represent a dICO.

[20-Oct-19 09:41 AM] ca333#0118
We could add a explicit "dICO" option so that Antara Composer even covers the last step: i.e. setting up a atomicDEX (mm2) node as the dICO marketmaker and putting the initial cap on there - with a "dICO config" through a dICO webinterface: initial price, price increments over N days, early adopters bonus, accepted currencies, and so on....

Anyone else having an issue creating an AtomicDEX trade, in which the "amount to receive" field won't accept more than 7 digits?

[20-Oct-19 02:15 PM] runpaint#7773
So far I've only experienced it when I sold Doge and Qtum for COMMOD.  The issue wasn't present when I sold ETH, LTC, USDC, RVN, KMD, BAT, and VRSC for COMMOD.

[20-Oct-19 03:22 PM] allbits#5898
Recently, if I try to take the entire amount on order for a particular coin (actually VRSC) the swap does not match and fails at 0/3.  If I take slightly less than the full amount everything is fine. However this is only true for large amounts.  If there is a small amount on offer (like less than one VRSC) then I am able to take the full amount without problem

[20-Oct-19 03:37 PM] runpaint#7773
I've found a workaround: if your order total is more than 7 digits, just create 10 orders which are each 1-tenth the size.  It worked.

[20-Oct-19 04:12 PM] jspook16#3059

[20-Oct-19 04:13 PM] Oszy#5734

`ive had a swap ongoing (step 2/3) for about 10 minutes, is this normal?` @gigamesh 
Yes, every coin has different blocktimes and minconfs/notarization time. It is normal. A BTC swap can take even an hour depending on network speed.

[21-Oct-19 05:51 AM] miles#6381
New version installed with no glitches  and swaps going thorough on new coins no problem - getting better and smoother all the time! Well done

an explorer to view all orders on atomicDEX at a glace?

yes - orderbooks are on https://oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/

that's a search for HUSH

[21-Oct-19 09:14 AM] gigamesh#3544
and a search for OOT or Utrum returns nothing at all so i suspect it's out of date or OOT isnt integrated for some reason?

[21-Oct-19 09:15 AM] ca333#0118
the last set of newly integrated coins is missing right now - you can expect an update today or tomorrow

[21-Oct-19 09:15 AM] gcharang#6833
it shows the full orderbook with a delay of 15 minutes

[21-Oct-19 09:16 AM] gigamesh#3544
so take HUSH as an example - is it showing me the only 3 orders that exist for HUSH when i search for ``HUSH``?

[21-Oct-19 09:17 AM] gigamesh#3544
additionally there are orders for OOT which are not viewable on that explorer

[21-Oct-19 09:17 AM] gigamesh#3544
( i can see them in-app)

[21-Oct-19 09:19 AM] coingirl87#6489
What does row
Dex/btc  BTC0.0050000000  153.27636485 DEX means? Someone will sell 153 dex for 0.005 btc per dex or someone will buy 153 dex for 0.005 btc per dex?

[21-Oct-19 09:20 AM] coingirl87#6489
Or is 0.005 the price for all 153 dex?

[21-Oct-19 09:20 AM] gigamesh#3544
ok the HUSH info is accurate i think

[21-Oct-19 09:20 AM] gigamesh#3544
checking between app and explorer

[21-Oct-19 09:20 AM] gigamesh#3544
doesnt explain OOT tho

[21-Oct-19 09:20 AM] gcharang#6833
OOT hasn't been added to the  site ` https://oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/` yet, it is a website run by @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator informally
> is it showing me the only 3 orders that exist for HUSH when i search for HUSH?

it is showing the orders that were available 15 minutes before

again, this is not a perfect solution, the orderbooks will come to the mobile app soon

[21-Oct-19 09:22 AM] gigamesh#3544

> can i use that explorer to view completed swaps?
 whether a swap is complete or not is known to only the maker and taker
it can also be found by analysing the involved blockchains

what the website here: `https://oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/` shows is the orderbook
the orderbook is constructed by each marketmaker node locally based on the info they hear on the network
offers are only broadcasted by makers till they are unfulfilled
