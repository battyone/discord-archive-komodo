So need some eth

[29-Jul-19 09:00 PM] ecbuddy#8524
Makes sense

[29-Jul-19 09:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, Ethereum design limitations

[29-Jul-19 09:01 PM] ecbuddy#8524
Another question lol, I did ltc transfer, but now there is dust in there, any plans to be able to sweep the dust and convert to kmd or wtv?

[29-Jul-19 09:02 PM] TonyL#3577
mm2 protocol not support swaps less than 0.00777 from maker or taker side in order for any coin - so technically there is no straightforward way to swap dust

[29-Jul-19 09:03 PM] ecbuddy#8524
plans for the future?

[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] TonyL#3577
There is a `max` button near amount input which should not leave dust

[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] TonyL#3577
If some dust remained after this button usage - it's a bug

[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] ecbuddy#8524
consider it qa bug, cause I use the max button alot

I also stumbled over the ETH erc20 gas requirement. It would be good if the error message made it clear ETH is required for these swaps. Just saying ‚Äúinsufficient balance‚Äù does not really makes sense on its own.

Portfolio balance is zero when it shouldn't be. Has that been temporarily disabled?

[29-Jul-19 11:20 PM] jspook16#3059
Also, how do I remove coins from portfolio?

[29-Jul-19 11:37 PM] allbits#5898
Log out from settings page. Then log back in. You will need to reenable certain coins. This is a work around for both issues. They are aware and working on both.

@TonyL after a few trades, I am running into issues where I can‚Äôt place trades anymore.
My balance goes to max, but doesn‚Äôt reflect my max balance, and it flickers fast and hard.
Seems like it‚Äôs glitching out or something.

My Rick and Morty just vannished from the wallet, is this a bug or it was supposed to happen?

[30-Jul-19 02:55 PM] gcharang#6833 (pinned)
We migrated the RICK & MORTY test-chains to new and more economic smart chains with a hybrid PoW and PoS structure. Faucets have been reset and you have to request new funds for testing. AtomicDEX mobile will automagically use the new chains and thus not contain your old RICK/MORTY balances. We will inform the community once all the infrastructure(block explorers/faucets) is updated to work with the new chains.

Here's the faucet links for RICK/MORTY - 
https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/faucet/rick
https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/faucet/morty
if not working at first, give it a few minutes and try again, there may be a flood of thirsty traders early on.
Opera and Chrome browsers recommended (Firefox fails to load captcha sometimes)

I received this email about testing atomic DEX  but it said that app not available  and this is a notice I received on my email
AtomicDEX Mobile Beta
Congratulations! 

You have been invited to the AtomicDEX beta. To join the beta and download the app go to the following link:

https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex

If the link does not work it means you had subscribed with an email that was not attached to your google play account. In this case contact us through Discord.

About The Test

During the next 24 hours, we will be conducting extensive tests with our AtomicDEX wallet application.

Please note that our tests are primarily focused on testing atomic swaps and network connectivity issues. As a secondary focus, we are also collecting feedback about the overall wallet functionality and user experience.

Let‚Äôs get started!

[30-Jul-19 03:55 PM] tomsmith26#8707
How can I do this test ? Thank you

[30-Jul-19 04:23 PM] gcharang#6833
@Werxadler most likely the swap that timed out for you is because of the chain migration we just did

[30-Jul-19 04:41 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
@gcharang Faucet dont want to give me Rick and Morty, when i put my address of AtomicDEX said "you have enough, go to home" but my balances show 0 ü§î

[30-Jul-19 04:43 PM] gcharang#6833
@FtrSaroth will investigate the problem
if you don't have any other coins in the wallet you are currently using, create a new seed phrase and use it to get coins from the faucet

[30-Jul-19 04:48 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
Thanks @gcharang, i have other coins in the wallet, its possible to have another wallet with different addresses on the app? To create one to receive Rick Morty and then send it to the first one

[30-Jul-19 04:51 PM] gcharang#6833
@FtrSaroth that can be done
logout -> create new wallet -> give it another name

but I just used the faucet to get coins to an address I already received coins with the old chain
may be open the website in a private window
don't use firefox

[30-Jul-19 04:52 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
Ok, thanks @gcharang, tried with brave, gonna try with another üëç
