Not finished trade not possible to cancel on stage where balances changing

[04-Aug-19 01:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Only placed order is possible to cancel but order placing itself not changing balance

[04-Aug-19 01:54 PM] general_grievous#6992
I have canceled the trade and it disappeared from my orders page but some balance has disappeared.

[04-Aug-19 02:42 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
funds from stalled trade should return in 4.5hours. make note of the uuid and let us know if not

[04-Aug-19 02:58 PM] general_grievous#6992
I will do so. Thx.

[04-Aug-19 03:29 PM] Cryptosaurus#2742
When I create an order, after confirmation it changes the amount of receive coin. Anyone else has this issue?

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator is this what is to be expected from the production ready software? 4.5 hours for the funds to return?

[04-Aug-19 04:37 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptosaurus can confirm there is a some not correct behaviour on maker orders creation, thank you for report

@general_grievous such refund time determined by protocol, in these 4.5 hours there is a still a chance to complete swap with this maker. It's very helpful if one of the deal participants have a bad connection lets say

[04-Aug-19 04:38 PM] general_grievous#6992
Ok. That makes sense.

How we can change languages? AtomicDex is in French. I prefer in English.

[04-Aug-19 08:12 PM] 27aume#8635
I had an idea for ethereum based trade and the tx fees.

It would be interesting if a % of eth based trade fees could be directed to a capped pool(c-pool). By c-pool i mean that after for example 10 or 100eth accumulated the fees would stop going in the c-pool.
 The c-pool would pay for taker side of trades or maybe both sides (i personally think mainly taker shouldnt have to pay to buy eth or erc20 because if you are trying to get your first eth or simply go from asset to stablecoin its doesnt make sence to send asset to CEX > get eth > withdraw to atomicDex > get what you need)

Thats pretty much it. Thank you

[04-Aug-19 08:14 PM] allbits#5898
Why should we want to bother fixing a shortcoming that is inherent in eth? Let it suffer from its poor design and be exposed for what it is

Amen

[04-Aug-19 08:32 PM] fat3lvis#6079
It would be wise to address the eth shortcoming because solutions and simplicity attract users. Complexity for the sake of some ‚Äúnot my mess‚Äù attitude is self defeating at best

[04-Aug-19 08:42 PM] allbits#5898
That's not simplicity. You're further taxing eth transactions, and sending the devs.down a side road. Adding complexity.

Attracting users is not going to be a problem

[04-Aug-19 09:27 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
just adding a note informing user about ETH needs gas before trading for first time traders should be sufficient

What i need to do to get back my kmd ?

[04-Aug-19 09:59 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
@D3b0 The success of the swap is unrecoverable. If it fails, KMD is still in your wallet.

[04-Aug-19 10:04 PM] D3b0#9761
I have 2 timeout and i cant see my kmd for this 2 swap

[04-Aug-19 10:46 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
For timeout orders, you can check if KMD has a rollout record. I also timed out several times, but KMD didn't move in the wallet.

@ca333 I think there is something minimum amount to use for putting a trade. I remember it was something around 0.00777 something for BTC/KMD order.

[05-Aug-19 10:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It'd be nice to see such info showing on screen somewhere

[05-Aug-19 10:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

The 4 RFOX per KMD is my sell order... I think it is showing you the current best rate on the books.

@TonyL can i also tell you that i tried to test 'withdrawal' to Coinexchange and the address was not valid so i send some ETH back to my Wallet and from there i sended it to my Coinexchange ETH address. 

A bug you think?

@fat3lvis what version of app on what platrorm are you using? please try to "Log out" from settings and login again

[05-Aug-19 06:41 PM] TonyL#3577
@Sharifa ETH checksum verification used by AtomicDEX, so it is case sensitive (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55)
e.g. for https://etherscan.io/address/0x2a5994b501e6a560e727b6c2de5d856396aadd38 it'll be `0x2a5994b501E6A560e727b6C2DE5D856396aaDd38`

iPhone SE. Software 12.3.1  ‚Äì Wouldn't let me set it up beyond the stage of pasting my Seed Phrase.

[05-Aug-19 08:32 PM] justpip#5610
Some additional feedback:

1. Found the red text on dark grey background (seed phrase) hard to read. This has to be super clear. Not all of us have the eyesight of a 20-year-old üòâ 

2. Was surprised it was such a short seed (expecting 24 words  not 12) so hit the refresh button assuming the second half of the seed phrase was hiding. Realised it wasn't. 

Anyways, that's as far as I got before it froze at that stage.
