What is a legacy address?

[09-Nov-19 06:01 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Ah, my adress is a segwit adress. So that wont work üòÖ

[09-Nov-19 06:07 PM] Oszy#5734
yes. you can use Agama with your seed to send to ledger.

[09-Nov-19 06:07 PM] Oszy#5734
that supports segwit

[09-Nov-19 06:18 PM] CoinKing88#1540
That's too difficult for me, ill just wait till i want to trade to KMD and then withdraw the KMD to the ledger üôÇ

@ca333 - some feedback on AtomicDEX

I have been using the Atomic DEX app for a while now and have made a number of successful trades. It is really easy to use and the UX is generally fantastic. I do have one important piece of feedback on the trading interface, however.

You need to add the balance of each holding to the main trade screen when a sell or buy order is entered on the trading screens. Currently nothing is shown (at least on my version) when you select a particular coin to sell. If you don't want to trade your max balance, then as a user you are forced to go back to the previous screen and try to remember the balance and then enter ho much you want to trade. The balance of each coin account should be shown on the actual trade screen (& not just on the pop up window for coin selection). I have found that when demonstrating the App to others it is really easy to lose track of this information between screens. Other crypto wallet apps provide this information. You also provide it on the App's withdrawal screen. Ideally you should also show the equivalent value in USD.

I have also provided this feedback on the AtomicDEX website. Hopefully you will pick up this minor but important UX change. I can share a graphic of the suggested change if required.

@mercadinaut If you want to trade the maximum amount, you can just press max.

[11-Nov-19 05:54 AM] Jimm B.#9993
Sorry, I read wrong.  Nevertheless, you can find out the maximum by pressing Max.  nothing to remember.

[11-Nov-19 07:14 AM] Oszy#5734
What language  do you have set? IIRC in some languages the max button was out of screen. Post your phone model also, if you can't see max button might be a UI bug on a certain phone.

[11-Nov-19 07:14 AM] Oszy#5734
You can also see balance when selecting the coin, don't have to go back to main page.

@Oszy   OK - will do & will provide specifics on my phone model. The language set is English & yes I can see the "Max" button. I appreciate that the coin balance is on the previous screen and on the pop-up when you select the coin. My suggestion is to improve the UX as I have encountered this problem several times. Every other exchange I have used displays your balance on screen before you make a trade.

If you have your seed you will be able to restore

@Goku even if the coinomi mnemonic is supported, the existing seed phrases will work
they are the same format used in the rest of the Komodo eco-system like Agama and other wallets

right now, you can use Agama or the Ocean qt wallet to convert your AtomicDEX seed phrase to privatekey (wif) that will be accepted by most of the other wallets

I love the idea of AtomicDex and have tested it successfully a few times with real crypto.  However, one frustration as a user is if I'm in the middle of trying to fill out the DEX form, but I look away from my phone, to say check the price of the crypto I want to receive, when I come back to my phone, it's locked and after I put the phone password in, I then have to put the AtomicDEX password in, and THEN the form has reset.  It would be nice if the form didn't reset,  Thank you!

[12-Nov-19 03:47 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
Ah, if I turn off PIN protection, then my screen timing out does NOT reset the form.

I want to know kmd-dex trading history.

[12-Nov-19 08:51 AM] gcharang#6833
other than the makers publishing the details themselves, the only way to find a trading history is to have a mm2 node always online
and observing the orders that are broadcast and checking the involved blockchains if a disappeared order has been fulfilled

such a system is not implemenmted yet and is a huge undertaking (servers+storage and man hours to code), I don't know if the team is interested in implementing it

Improvement proposal to atomicdex coins transaction listings.  If you go through older transactions and always when atomicdex updates transactions from electrum servers it also relists them from beginning and you have to  start scrolling them through all over which is very annoying especially when you need to look some transaction.

Hi everyone!
I would like to know how the conversion of mnemonic (seed / 12 word) is converted to addresses?
When I import my mnemonics, I get completely different addresses through the Trust wallet and iancoleman.io/bip39/ service.

My version of ios 13.2

[12-Nov-19 01:18 PM] Oszy#5734
It may use a different derivation path? 
seed created in atomicdex & agama are 100% compatible with atomicdex
make sure you don't have extra space at the end / type it don't copy/paste see if it works that way

[12-Nov-19 01:24 PM] gcharang#6833
@AndrewVV you need to convert the atomicDEX seed words  to a wif using Agama <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024495-export-private-key-wif-from-a-wallet-seed-or-pin-password>

the wif should be usable in all the other wallets

the way seed words are converted to addresses is different in the Komodo ecosystem compared to other wallets

[12-Nov-19 01:38 PM] Oszy#5734
@gcharang he can't use wif in atomicdex, i think he wants to use a trust wallet seed with atomicdex which might have been created on a different path

[12-Nov-19 01:39 PM] gcharang#6833
I thought he wanted to use atomicDEX's seed in trust wallet

[12-Nov-19 01:39 PM] Oszy#5734
@AndrewVV please clarify üòÑ

[12-Nov-19 01:40 PM] Oszy#5734
if that's the case you're right, also there is `convertpassphrase` in KomodoOcean

@Oszy I want to use my seed phrase in AtomicDex

[12-Nov-19 01:54 PM] AndrewVV#0430
Where could I see relevant derivation path?
When I select "view Seed" my seed phrase is displayed to me.
In your wallet accidentally there is no password overlay on the seed phrase?

[12-Nov-19 02:01 PM] Oszy#5734
I am not sure what is the path used in the other wallet, best if you create a new seed with atomicdex and send the coins over to the new address

[12-Nov-19 02:02 PM] Oszy#5734
copy/pasting, exposing seed that has coins on it, is never a good idea anyway

[12-Nov-19 02:42 PM] AndrewVV#0430
I tried creating a new account. I also tried to open my new seed in the Agama wallet. I see the same addresses. How do I know the relevant  derivation path?

My derivation paths
BTC: m/44'/0'/0'/0/0
ETH: m/44'/60'/0'/0/0

[12-Nov-19 02:50 PM] SHossain#0007
you can't use bip39/bip44 or similar seed phrase in atomicDEX or Agama. 
just create a new seed from atomicDEX or Agama and both of them will be interchangeable

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[12-Nov-19 02:51 PM] SHossain#0007
in Agama and atomicDEX, one seed phrase will always generate one address. no derivation path, no other address

I don‚Äôt like how you have to re-enter your seed. I wrote it down correctly. Stop wasting my time.

Had a BTC/KMD swap, where due to long BTC blocktimes, swap was showing "timeout" after roughly 3 hours just like with other coins, but it eventually went trough shortly after that and changed to successful.
I've been told BTC has 10x locktime than other coins, so this could be a UI discrepancy or false data from mm2? It should not show "timeout" if it's not actually timed out for good.
