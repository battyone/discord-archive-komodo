[22-Jul-19 09:49 PM] Mr. Orange#4717
also...what does the colored bar on the portfolio page represent?  I have some coins that failed atomic swaps and are not available.  I imagine this is the red part of the bar, but I am not sure.

[22-Jul-19 09:53 PM] Oszy#5734
the diversion of your portfolio

[22-Jul-19 09:53 PM] Oszy#5734
different colors are the different coins

[22-Jul-19 09:54 PM] Oszy#5734
red probably RFOX

[22-Jul-19 10:03 PM] Mr. Orange#4717
nope.  I don't have any redfox.  Rick, Morty, KMD, and BAT.  Maybe BAT is the red?  Either way it should be more clear in the UI.

[22-Jul-19 11:05 PM] Markus#5464
new atomic dex website background looking good

[23-Jul-19 01:41 AM] dogracer#3298
Is there some way to see the list of orders without first typing in both a coin and an amount on the trade screen? I'm obsessively compulsively check this for RICK/KMD and MORTY/KMD and all I am succeeding at is wearing down my mobile battery. Would be awesome to have some sort of notifications or at least a refresh button of sorts.

[23-Jul-19 01:54 AM] 27aume#8635
Yes same here xD, ive proposed the refresh button to.
No at the moment unless you run a full node(lp node) theres no way to just query the orderbook.

[23-Jul-19 01:57 AM] 27aume#8635
Also at the moment. The way the order book is displayed and loads isnt super intuitive. Im never sure if it loaded properly or if im having an issue, it leave a lot of uncertainty in the accuracy of what is displayed.

[23-Jul-19 01:58 AM] 27aume#8635
Adding a "last updated at x date" plus a refresh feature would make it more consistent i think.

[23-Jul-19 02:20 AM] 27aume#8635
Here's what i have today
22-07-2019
- created order: rick_kmd 12h30
- created order: morty_kmd 12h30
- canceled by uninstall reinstall at 13h50 (reinstall because doubt of accuracy of orderbook)
- rick_morty timedout
- kmd_rfox success

[23-Jul-19 02:30 AM] 27aume#8635
I think i just found a little UI bug:
The max balance button shows properly when going to the trade tab normaly BUT when going there by swipping to open coin menu then clicking swap button it doesnt show.

3:14 AM] Mr. Orange: Hello.  I have some feed back on the mobile DEX.  Very good so far.  I have done 11 swaps.  6 Timeout failures.  For some reason, the tactile feedback on entering my pin could be more sensitive.  For the 6 number password, it often only registers 5 numbers. Not sure why, but it happens more often than not.  Also, when a atomic swap fails, it would be better to have the error message stay up until you confirm OK.  Many times I am trying to read the error message but it dissapears before I finish reading it.  Overall, the mobile DEX is impressive and I am excited for Komodo's future.  Keep up the great work. :ok_hand:

feedback from another channel @TonyL

[23-Jul-19 06:02 AM] Mewnzter#0237
Perhaps a stupid question, isn't 12 words for a private key seed to low if you want to reach the kind of adoption you're aiming at?

[23-Jul-19 06:03 AM] Mewnzter#0237
Or is it always 12 words + password to recover on a new device?

[23-Jul-19 06:37 AM] Oszy#5734
You are free to use your own seed just import that instead of creating a new one.

[23-Jul-19 06:37 AM] Oszy#5734
Later it could be an option to choose from 12-24 that is a good idea.

[23-Jul-19 07:24 AM] Mewnzter#0237
Ok, will do that when it's out of beta :)

[23-Jul-19 07:31 AM] Oszy#5734
Found a `bug?` so far only happened with DOGE, I have 12.94 DOGE in my wallet, when I am creating an order and pressing the `MAX` button, it fills the input field with only 2.92 DOGE and then i get an error saying you need at least 5 DOGE to swap.

The withdraw transactions are OK, you sent from RUwodWWAabv3h2jSatVDSMT89cLkTMSutA to RKD8NjuLNrnqaFY9KRpU6MAWHeve9byjAA and the rest was returned to RUwodWWAabv3h2jSatVDSMT89cLkTMSutA, that is why the tx has 2 outputs.

I understand, but atomicdex display doesn't show the address where bulk of funds (the address input as destination) went to.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35845239/61710492-5b444580-ad84-11e9-981f-2c93bcf3c6f2.png)

This creates the misconception that all funds were sent to self. User reported this when attempting to send to Binance (I linked them to tx on explorer to confirm it actually went there).

In general it's better to be marketmaker from PC (phone battery draining, signal might be unstable and etc), but I think that working with orders list and custom orders creation will be added in future releases. @ca333 will correct me if I'm thinking wrong 😃

[24-Jul-19 03:02 AM] Vanncoins#3044
Found a bug with the new update that could potentially cause problems, it’s a bit difficult to explain but I’ll give it a shot. First I hit max on the coin I’m trying to sell, then I select the coin I want to buy. There isn’t enough of the coin to buy, so it reduces the amount I’m selling. I noticed the amount I was selling was very small for the amount of the coin I’d be getting. I thought there must be some mistake, why am I getting such a good rate? I almost didn’t think twice and almost hit the swap button thinking I’d hit the lotto, but then I checked again on the selling amount. It displayed 62.347838, but after tapping the amount field, it scrolled over to reveal that the amount was actually 162.347838. This could definitely cause some issues

[24-Jul-19 03:11 AM] Vanncoins#3044
Also, in this screenshot of a transaction, the button in the top right (circled in red), I believe it’s a button to view the transaction in a separate block explorer, but it doesn’t work, it exits the app. It happens on any transaction from any coin
