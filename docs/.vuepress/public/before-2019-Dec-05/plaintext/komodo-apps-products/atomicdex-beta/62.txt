Will there be Fiat on ramps to the DEX?

[11-Sep-19 03:59 PM] TonyL#3577
USDC stable-token already trading in AtomicDEX

Hello ,
I‚Äôm trying AtomicDEX with iOS and I can‚Äôt enter the new created wallet. When I introduce the password I‚Äôm invited to create a 5 number passcode again, and then again to the locked wallet. 

Thanks

[11-Sep-19 06:36 PM] psyfont#8247
Ok, I finally skip it (5 number code creation screen) and able to enter the wallet just sliding with finger to the right on the top bar. I didn‚Äôt touch the red button on the left side, it was sending me to the selection wallet screen...

[11-Sep-19 06:43 PM] psyfont#8247
No. Same again

[11-Sep-19 07:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Hello! Actually pin code have 6 digits. Maybe 6th doesnt fit your screen.  What Iphone model are you using @psyfont ?

[11-Sep-19 07:27 PM] Geert#4612
Hello, the screen is also too small for me.

I used a seed to an address containing kmd when i installed atomicdex on My Phone, but No kmd is showing in the wallet.

[12-Sep-19 06:12 AM] lollipop#1682
Shouldnt it show the balance of the address?

[12-Sep-19 06:13 AM] gcharang#6833
@lollipop search the address in  explorer: kmdexplorer.io

[12-Sep-19 06:15 AM] lollipop#1682
The wallet does not have the same address as the one with the kmd.

[12-Sep-19 06:16 AM] lollipop#1682
Okay

[12-Sep-19 06:16 AM] lollipop#1682
Did I type the seed wrong then?

[12-Sep-19 06:17 AM] gcharang#6833
if you selected "custom seed" then there is a possibility that you have input a wrong seed

[12-Sep-19 06:17 AM] lollipop#1682
I did

[12-Sep-19 06:18 AM] lollipop#1682
So i uninstall and try again right?

[12-Sep-19 06:18 AM] gcharang#6833
no need to uninstall
just select "restore" in the welcome screen and give it a different name

[12-Sep-19 06:18 AM] lollipop#1682
Okay

[12-Sep-19 06:18 AM] lollipop#1682
Thx

[12-Sep-19 06:18 AM] gcharang#6833
you can also delete the wrong wallet from "settings"

[12-Sep-19 06:19 AM] gcharang#6833
if you don't select "custom seed", the wallet will only allow you to proceed if you enter a seed that was created by atomicDEX

[12-Sep-19 06:20 AM] lollipop#1682
Aaah

[12-Sep-19 06:20 AM] lollipop#1682
Its not a wallet created by atomicdex tho

[12-Sep-19 06:22 AM] gcharang#6833
where was the seed created?
agama?

[12-Sep-19 06:22 AM] lollipop#1682
Yew

[12-Sep-19 06:22 AM] lollipop#1682
Yes

[12-Sep-19 06:23 AM] gcharang#6833
then you should select "custom seed" and enter the words properly. click the eye icon to see the words you are entering
and don't add extra spaces

[12-Sep-19 06:24 AM] lollipop#1682
I did. But must have missed something. Ill just try again. Np.

[12-Sep-19 06:43 AM] gcharang#6833
@wanda if you forgot the password, you could use the "restore" option and use the seed words that you have backedup when creating the wallet

[12-Sep-19 06:53 AM] wanda#4668
it worked gcharang and i backedup my password this time

[12-Sep-19 06:53 AM] wanda#4668
thanks

[12-Sep-19 06:53 AM] gcharang#6833

@lollipop https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin/bips/master/bip-0039/english.txt

[12-Sep-19 07:25 AM] lollipop#1682
They are

[12-Sep-19 07:29 AM] gcharang#6833
@lollipop is the seed phrase producing the correct address in agama itself?

[12-Sep-19 07:59 AM] lollipop#1682
Yes

[12-Sep-19 08:00 AM] lollipop#1682
Or wait

[12-Sep-19 08:00 AM] lollipop#1682
I did not try with the New version.

[12-Sep-19 08:00 AM] lollipop#1682
It works in chainswap

[12-Sep-19 08:01 AM] IamTrader#6042
is eth in atomicdex a smart contract or direct transfer?

[12-Sep-19 08:02 AM] gcharang#6833
@IamTrader it uses a smart contract
what do you mean by direct transfer?

[12-Sep-19 08:03 AM] IamTrader#6042
@gcharang ah okay, coz the exchange i use it says it does not support smart contract just direct transfer

[12-Sep-19 08:06 AM] gcharang#6833
@IamTrader the receiving address for ETH in atomicDEX is a normal address
so it is a direct transfer
what I said previously is that, for atomic swap involving ETH, we use smart contracts
so you should be able to withdraw to your atomicDEX ETH address

Really, minimum BTC buy is .00777? Is this a bug?

[12-Sep-19 09:42 AM] dudezmobi#1945
Looks like it

[12-Sep-19 10:02 AM] TonyL#3577
@benzo365 Hi! It's not a bug - minimal swap amount is 0.00777 determined by protocol and the same for all coins. I'm agree that it's quite high amount in USD equialent. But from another side it's better to trade huge amounts of BTC because of tx fees.

[12-Sep-19 10:22 AM] Privatoshi#7913
$80 btc minimum for buys

[12-Sep-19 10:24 AM] phideas#8309
no one should complain, btc is digital gold after all. heavy and expensive. by design.

[12-Sep-19 10:26 AM] Privatoshi#7913
well since you said no one should complain, then u must be right, naturally.

[12-Sep-19 10:28 AM] phideas#8309
üôÇ i don't have to be right, btc is as it is on layer one. not realy suitable for small tx.

[12-Sep-19 10:33 AM] Privatoshi#7913
Which set of layers we referring to?

[12-Sep-19 10:33 AM] Privatoshi#7913
How about the LN?

[12-Sep-19 10:36 AM] phideas#8309
Yes, LN is designed to do micro tx with BTC. But it is different tech, L2 solution. Not suited for komodo atomic swaps afaik,

[12-Sep-19 10:42 AM] benzo365#8202
In my opinion a DEX shouldn't have restrictions like this

{Reactions}
üçÄ 

[12-Sep-19 10:56 AM] phideas#8309
i agree $80 is a bit overkill for a min. amount per swap. btc is currently capable to do it cheaper, but otoh btc fees can change rapidly as "number go up" üôÇ

[12-Sep-19 10:57 AM] Philtr#9415
An important question. Is also planned to support BEP-5 on the AtomicDEX?

I had some rewards to claim, but after sending some kmd to another wallet I have no more rewards to claim, is that how it's supposed to behave or is a bug? If I'm correct, on the agama wallet this was possible (send some and still have my previously accumulated kmd to claim)...

[12-Sep-19 03:39 PM] Oszy#5734
when you send it claims it for you

{Reactions}
‚úÖ 

[12-Sep-19 03:39 PM] ca333#0118
@wl that is a feature - when sending a TX the reward is automagically claimed. You can actually check your transaction on the blockexplorer and will see the reward.

[12-Sep-19 03:41 PM] wl#4107
Thanks for the quick answer, I know it's like that on the agama I didn't know the AtomicDex had it too

{Reactions}
üëç 

[12-Sep-19 03:43 PM] ca333#0118
Thanks for the feedback - i will take it as a feature request (improvement) - we will add a logic that checks potential rewards before sending a transaction and informs the user about the automagic claiming and corresponding amount...

[12-Sep-19 04:19 PM] groundhog#0062
is that  intentional, that when prompting the wrong pw i can not use the touchfuction on my mobile to place the cursor, instead i need to use "del" and go all the way back like in a terminal?
