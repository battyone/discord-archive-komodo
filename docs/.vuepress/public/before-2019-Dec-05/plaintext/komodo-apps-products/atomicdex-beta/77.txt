It is unfortunate that we loose our swap history after this update.  Please warn in future!

[06-Oct-19 06:31 PM] NNoperator#3835
Looks nice so far.  Thank you for all the hard work.

[06-Oct-19 06:36 PM] NNoperator#3835
Will more assetchains be added soon?  I would like to trade for DEX and REVS.

[06-Oct-19 07:13 PM] willofleo#7505

I have an issue with the dex, i cant withdraw my bitcoin to a different address. Is this a known issue?

[06-Oct-19 09:48 PM] jspook16#3059
You can probably move it using the verus agama wallet on desktop. Just login with the same seed. @Liborum - Blockchain Relations

[06-Oct-19 09:50 PM] PTYX#6840
@Liborum - Blockchain Relations you can also use the Atomicdex seed in Chameleon. When you restore the wallet you have to select "Agama compatibility"

[06-Oct-19 09:53 PM] Liborum - Blockchain Relations#2333
I figured it out, thank you guys. I was trying to use a segwit address,the error was just coming up weird. I used a legacy addy and it worked

how many coins/tokens are available in the atomixDex

[06-Oct-19 11:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Any bitcoin based or erc20 can be added

I'm getting blackscreen after update. (galaxy note 9 international version with exynos).

[07-Oct-19 05:13 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
reinstall should fix the issue @NewbieDriver

[07-Oct-19 08:23 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
With the android app, I frequently get a message at the bottom of the screen about not having an internet connection. Only thing I can do to fix it is close the app with the multitask button

[07-Oct-19 08:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
switching between wifi and 3g/4g, changing vpn etc may cause this

[07-Oct-19 08:28 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
It seems to happen when I have not used my device for a while

[07-Oct-19 08:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
could be phone going into a "sleep mode" and turning off connection to reserve battery?

[07-Oct-19 08:29 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
maybe, but it doesn't happen with any other app I use

[07-Oct-19 08:30 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Also, it seems orders that I had on the books have all disappeared from my order list now

[07-Oct-19 08:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
whenplacing orders, there is a message on the confirm screen that advises to keep the app open. orders may be timing out after a period of no connectivity.

[07-Oct-19 08:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you can send logs via DM though so we can confirm and add to github issues. which phone? do you have battery saving apps installed?

[07-Oct-19 08:37 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I just had the same issue as newbiedriver above when updating the app as well

the latest update requires the old version to be uninstalled first

[07-Oct-19 08:39 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
These were orders that were on the books for a few days though. All my orders were there just a few minutes ago, and then all went away

[07-Oct-19 08:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
also doesnt hurt to reboot between uninstall and installing new version

[07-Oct-19 08:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
orderbook might take a while to propagate to device if connectivity has been interupted

[07-Oct-19 08:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can you see them on here ? https://www.oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/

[07-Oct-19 08:45 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
no

[07-Oct-19 08:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
could be the update cleared them from attempting to kickstart from your cache

[07-Oct-19 08:50 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I did the update after my order book cleared

[07-Oct-19 08:51 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
They were there, I went to open a trade, which failed and then when I looked at the orders tab it was empty. Seems a lot of orders disappeared from the book actually, not just mine

[07-Oct-19 08:52 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
There were 8 or so now there are 3

The faucets are also IN the atomicDEX mobile app - just go to the RICK or MORTY detail view and click on "Receive" and afterwards on the "Faucet" button.

@cyrelb backup your seed phrase and a clean install should fix the black screen

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #110 \[Android\] Version 0\.2\.1 Doesn't Open
After updating to version 0.2.1 from 0.2.0 the app only shows a black screen when opened. My device is a Pixel 2 XL running Android 10.

I've tried forcing the app closed and opening it again, as well as restarting the phone with no luck.

@Robert Naus if you want to use the old agama seed, you will have to use the "custom seed" option in the seed input screen

When will pirate chain be added? I would like to purchase some over the Mobil dex rather then trade ogre or Graviex

[09-Oct-19 12:47 AM] LeshAft9#0083
my understanding is you can't have pirate on a mobile/lite wallet because the shielded transactions require the full node

[09-Oct-19 02:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
unsure of mobile dex support for PIRATE, but PIRATE trading on AtomicDEX is in plans already. I have no updates how it's development going.

@TonyL Thx for clarification, this was already explained at Barterdex GitHub page, I just wanted to be sure, as BarterDex never really functioned properly for me, especially when testing it lately, while AtomicDex already looks as very intuitively and simplistically designed to be used without much hassle. Looking forward for more coin added.
