other servers were ok

[31-Oct-19 06:18 PM] TonyL#3577
A lot of users joined today - so it seems it was a stress test for discord as well

[31-Oct-19 06:18 PM] cezo484#5810
Campaign ongoing or finish?

[31-Oct-19 06:18 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031

We'll count all the data tomorrow to get as precise results as we can. So raffle/distribution will be in 1-2 days from now

[31-Oct-19 06:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Any way to kickstart?

[31-Oct-19 06:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or counterparty closed down their node?

[31-Oct-19 06:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe the maker went offline

Couldnt get one to match and tried since it began lol

[31-Oct-19 06:22 PM] Hooftly#1337
just ouch

[31-Oct-19 06:22 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
15 but only shows 7 on the leaderboard

[31-Oct-19 06:22 PM] Jaki#9826
@TonyL  I got 3 times 1/3. Is it enough and what should I do for next step? Thx

[31-Oct-19 06:23 PM] niko_O#3149
Not a single swap went thru after 12pm

[31-Oct-19 06:23 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031
where is the leaderboard?

[31-Oct-19 06:23 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
hopefully my previously scheduled trading will resume after this pre-emption for the wesminster dog show

[31-Oct-19 06:23 PM] TonyL#3577
It should be enough to get the raffle ticket. @Jaki we'll count failed swaps tomorrow and announce the updated list before the raffle

People who couldnt get a match are hosed right?

[31-Oct-19 06:25 PM] Artist#0765
Will you check auto or have to provide log

[31-Oct-19 06:25 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
@TonyL i was going to send my log file but its 108 mb, too big.  should i just skip it.  I have 15 successfull, and probably around 50 failed

[31-Oct-19 06:26 PM] TonyL#3577
@Hooftly you can send the log to @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator as a proof of attempts

[31-Oct-19 06:27 PM] TonyL#3577
@Artist if current dashboard data doesn't match with your data it's better to send the log

[31-Oct-19 06:27 PM] Artist#0765
I see I was 27th according to dashboard

[31-Oct-19 06:27 PM] Artist#0765
Lol

[31-Oct-19 06:27 PM] TonyL#3577
@cryptoclueless you can zip it and use some service like a https://gofile.io/ to upload it and share the link then

kmd blockchain has nothing to do with atomic dex swaps unless swapping kmd

[31-Oct-19 06:39 PM] dogracer#3298
Fyi made about 60 swap attempts with zero success on Android trying periodically over a 5hr span. Was there an issue with Android or just the infrastructure?

[31-Oct-19 06:41 PM] TonyL#3577
It was a global issue @dogracer Later we'll write post with test results and explanation of what actually happened

`One of my kmd node stopped to work during stress test`
KMD chain in independent and 100% unrelated to this stress test

[31-Oct-19 06:45 PM] SHossain#0007
the only components were used for this stress test are:
0. maker nodes using servers which uses MM2 + MORTY + RICK coin daemon
1. AtomicDEX mobile app to connect to the above using Electrum servers and perform swaps

[31-Oct-19 06:46 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031
Is there a reason the app won't open using an Android emulator?

[31-Oct-19 06:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
At first I was trying to swap with funds from faucet that had no confirmations

[31-Oct-19 06:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Then i got sent some new funds and i got several swaps in üòâ

[31-Oct-19 06:49 PM] JaNuS#7325
108 swap attempts for me, 4 swaped üòâ

nice

[31-Oct-19 06:50 PM] AkiraX#8269
I still can't get any

[31-Oct-19 06:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Are your funds confirmed on blockchain?

[31-Oct-19 07:09 PM] AkiraX#8269
Should be.  I faucet last night

[31-Oct-19 07:09 PM] ism(miliy)#4509
over 100attempts only 3failed:)

[31-Oct-19 07:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@AkiraX my faucet funds are still unconfirmed...

[31-Oct-19 07:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Check the blockchain for your address, I have a feeling they might not be confirmed

[31-Oct-19 07:14 PM] ism(miliy)#4509
ithink its not workingüò´

Sent log file to @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  since my 3 successful (and prob 100+ timed-out) swaps don't show on leaderboard

[31-Oct-19 08:28 PM] gigamesh#3544
im having another go

[31-Oct-19 08:29 PM] gigamesh#3544
still struggling to complete a swap - are others still trying?

[31-Oct-19 08:33 PM] Big Dog#1093
I only completed 2 out of 50 I reckon

[31-Oct-19 08:43 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
@gigamesh it's still not working for lol

[31-Oct-19 08:46 PM] gigamesh#3544
@NWhiskeyTango i just... want that swap

[31-Oct-19 09:10 PM] jspook16#3059
Is the team concerned that the first implementation of atomicdex was overloaded with ~2k users?

[31-Oct-19 09:21 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[31-Oct-19 09:22 PM] jl777c#5810
like the first GUI wasnt close to perfect, but has improved, so will the scaling capacity

[31-Oct-19 09:22 PM] jspook16#3059
Copy

[31-Oct-19 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810
also, keep in mind that 2000 users all trading the same orderbook at the same time...

[31-Oct-19 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810
that is actually quite a high volume scenario, even for CEX

[31-Oct-19 09:27 PM] jl777c#5810
and mm1 was able to achieve much higher throughputs, so mm2 just needs to catch up to it and go beyond it

[31-Oct-19 09:27 PM] jspook16#3059
I did. And I understand that its alot but wouldnt an official implementation need to handle many more than 2k users at a time?

[31-Oct-19 09:27 PM] jspook16#3059
Ok

[31-Oct-19 09:27 PM] jl777c#5810
per orderbook?

[31-Oct-19 09:28 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC/USDT pairs on the biggest exchanges would have that level of volumes

[31-Oct-19 09:28 PM] jspook16#3059
Im asking really. I dont know what is expected of each orderbook

[31-Oct-19 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
but not most other scenarios. that being said, we will get to where we can handle far more than this level

{Reactions}
üëç ‚òù 

[31-Oct-19 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if you look at most exchange trade history, you have a few trades per minute on an active orderbook

[31-Oct-19 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
how  many orderbooks have 30 per second of trades?

[31-Oct-19 09:30 PM] ca333#0118
also worth mentioning that the mobile DEX app itself is very stable - i.e. no crashs or other GUI issues you would expect from a beta

[31-Oct-19 09:31 PM] jspook16#3059
Ok with that said, do you forsee malicous spamming targeted at the atomicdex being a problem?
