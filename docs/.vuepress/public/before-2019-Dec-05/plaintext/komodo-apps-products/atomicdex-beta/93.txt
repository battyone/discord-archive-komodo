@RNI I once swaped my mom with a few nuggets

[31-Oct-19 01:00 PM] Strob#3417
Yesterday I got my 2 fisrt swaps really easily but today no. I will try to create utxo in my wallets

[31-Oct-19 01:00 PM] ca333#0118
@Hooftly of course we will honour the users who are helping us to gather all this important data and metrics!

[31-Oct-19 01:00 PM] TonyL#3577
@Malti sent some `4d0a71482dd1d717b9d73e88d887f1dadac7c7ce12b3aa3ef3f266903022b071`

there aint 7 on an address yet

[31-Oct-19 01:00 PM] Mark81#4505
there is no need for utxos!

[31-Oct-19 01:00 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031
do I pick the price in the orderbook at the top?

[31-Oct-19 01:00 PM] ca333#0118
@Strob no need to create UTXOs - the wallet handles this automatically

[31-Oct-19 01:00 PM] Hooftly#1337
that's cool but what about the shot at the grand prize I mean that's why we're all here let's be honest

[31-Oct-19 01:00 PM] ca333#0118
best is to try one by one - and without others pending orders

[31-Oct-19 01:00 PM] farl#9964
@ca333 Only cancel after 10 minutes waiting?

[31-Oct-19 01:00 PM] Strob#3417
ok

[31-Oct-19 01:00 PM] RNI#2666
i'll try again later .. stresstest goes till 18h gmt right?

[31-Oct-19 01:01 PM] ca333#0118
@farl after 10 - 20 seconds

[31-Oct-19 01:01 PM] ca333#0118
or as soon as you see the cancel button

[31-Oct-19 01:01 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
yes @RNI

[31-Oct-19 01:01 PM] farl#9964
Ok

[31-Oct-19 01:01 PM] ca333#0118
yes @RNI - until 6pm UTC/GMT

[31-Oct-19 01:02 PM] RNI#2666

[31-Oct-19 01:02 PM] Booster99x#7054
Some orders go from canceleable to uncancealable and vise versa, I don't get why

[31-Oct-19 01:02 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
ya ^^

[31-Oct-19 01:03 PM] vanity33#9778
and the rick balance changed without being able to complete a single swap yet

[31-Oct-19 01:03 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
both my balances changed too

[31-Oct-19 01:03 PM] [deleted]#2162
rick and morty balances are jumping between full balance and zero..

[31-Oct-19 01:03 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031
so guys u gotta pick the order at the top of the order book right

[31-Oct-19 01:04 PM] Artist#0765
Every order is pending

[31-Oct-19 01:04 PM] Artist#0765
Lol

[31-Oct-19 01:04 PM] duskonaut#1244
üòÇ I don't know how 1 Rick is not matched with 1 morty....Step 0/3 forever

[31-Oct-19 01:05 PM] vanity33#9778
same here

[31-Oct-19 01:05 PM] [deleted]#2162
Rick is more valuable than morty

[31-Oct-19 01:05 PM] danbedford#1068
@ca333 I see the cancel button immediately on every single Taker order I place

[31-Oct-19 01:05 PM] RNI#2666
same for me

[31-Oct-19 01:05 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031
me too

[31-Oct-19 01:06 PM] Hooftly#1337
*sigh*

[31-Oct-19 01:06 PM] ubhillutd#3274
Ditto

[31-Oct-19 01:06 PM] danbedford#1068
Just simply doing 1:1 trades each time, always see cancel immediately

[31-Oct-19 01:07 PM] ubhillutd#3274
Also. Intermittently the dex screen gets stuck at 'loading orderbook'

[31-Oct-19 01:07 PM] 27aume#8635
Same

[31-Oct-19 01:07 PM] Hooftly#1337
üò≠

[31-Oct-19 01:07 PM] benzo365#8202
No orders going through

[31-Oct-19 01:07 PM] Artist#0765
Same xD

[31-Oct-19 01:07 PM] duskonaut#1244
great stats...someone completed 6 trades in 1 hour

[31-Oct-19 01:07 PM] Pwnz#4150
step 0/3 ain't changing üôÇ

[31-Oct-19 01:08 PM] Booster99x#7054
So strange that "cancel" button appear and disappear "randomly"

[31-Oct-19 01:08 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Hooftly, woul;d be nice to win a prize.  I could use the cash.
Even so I'll get more benefit out of the stats that this test collects.  The dex is a valuable tool.

[31-Oct-19 01:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Which are the pairs to trade?

[31-Oct-19 01:08 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Kmd rick

[31-Oct-19 01:09 PM] 27aume#8635
What size the successful trade

[31-Oct-19 01:09 PM] Pwnz#4150
rick/morty

[31-Oct-19 01:09 PM] Artist#0765
Same here xD @CrisF

[31-Oct-19 01:10 PM] Hooftly#1337
yeah but its unfair to offer a prize than only a few users are able to attain.  Just saying 30 trades might not have been the best determining factor for entry considering the beta state of the software @CrisF

@Hooftly  hahaha

[31-Oct-19 01:10 PM] costa2439#3771
the important thing is not to do 30 exchanges, the important thing is to saturate atomicdex so that the devs can check for errors

[31-Oct-19 01:10 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Lol

[31-Oct-19 01:10 PM] duskonaut#1244
for 30 trades I need 30 days

[31-Oct-19 01:11 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031
lol

[31-Oct-19 01:11 PM] Hooftly#1337
doing one at a time

[31-Oct-19 01:11 PM] CryptoBrandon#9277
It keep showing Step 0/3

[31-Oct-19 01:11 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Most of the participants are after the prize of course

[31-Oct-19 01:11 PM] ubhillutd#3274
Loving how everyones first priority is helping the devs collect data... :troll_hurt:

[31-Oct-19 01:11 PM] gigamesh#3544
we can trade any pairs right

[31-Oct-19 01:11 PM] gigamesh#3544
?

[31-Oct-19 01:11 PM] [deleted]#2162
no

[31-Oct-19 01:11 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Shocking that people are complaining. Sorry you are broke!

[31-Oct-19 01:11 PM] dudezmobi#1945
We would not have pqrticiption without that prize

[31-Oct-19 01:12 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
It's a stress test of beta software

[31-Oct-19 01:12 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Lol yeah

[31-Oct-19 01:12 PM] duskonaut#1244
is stress test working?

[31-Oct-19 01:12 PM] duskonaut#1244
or this was by design?

[31-Oct-19 01:12 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
I was keen for the prize but also thought it'd be a bit of fun to see how many transactions i could do! I'm personally not too bothered that its not working as it is a stress test

[31-Oct-19 01:12 PM] ubhillutd#3274
@dudezmobi will have to disagree with u on that mate. Some of us were here for the first stress test. There were no rewards then.

[31-Oct-19 01:12 PM] duskonaut#1244
mission impossible

[31-Oct-19 01:12 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031
stress stress stress

[31-Oct-19 01:12 PM] dudezmobi#1945
But we dont have critical.mass

[31-Oct-19 01:12 PM] CrisF#3405
Seems like some will be able to attain it.  Maybe not me at this rate, but I have the same chance, just not my day @Hooftly.

[31-Oct-19 01:13 PM] coingirl87#6489
People please stop crying...this stress test helps devs to improve dex...so what have you expected??? This is the first ever big stress test for a new technology....its normal that not all work perfect...so stop crying and try to swap again and again so team can collect data to customizing and improve

[31-Oct-19 01:13 PM] vanity33#9778
not even a single swap so far

[31-Oct-19 01:13 PM] duskonaut#1244
We all like stuck transactions.... looks like Bitcoin

[31-Oct-19 01:13 PM] Hooftly#1337
is it the scripters freezing out real users though?

[31-Oct-19 01:13 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
@Mark81 he's a wizard!

@ubhillutd

[31-Oct-19 01:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the aim was to stress the system and get data. just keep trying, 30 is a goal but there are also bonus prizes üòâ

[31-Oct-19 01:13 PM] Mark81#4505
pure luck so far!

[31-Oct-19 01:14 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
5 more hours for you to try and claim your $30 prize if that's so important

[31-Oct-19 01:14 PM] Mark81#4505
now 2/3

[31-Oct-19 01:14 PM] duskonaut#1244
how about prizes for people who get 1 transaction?

[31-Oct-19 01:14 PM] JaNuS#7325
Finally one Swap completed after trying for 1 hour üòâ i am stressed üòâ the swap itself also took quite a few minutes, in my experience that was way faster with kmd and verus

[31-Oct-19 01:14 PM] dudezmobi#1945
It would fail @Mark81

[31-Oct-19 01:14 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Lol

[31-Oct-19 01:14 PM] Hooftly#1337
its about asking for effort from users not about the anount if the prize @Patrick Crypto lmao.

[31-Oct-19 01:14 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
did the swap happen straight after you put the order in with it going to 1/3?

[31-Oct-19 01:14 PM] Mark81#4505
yes straight away

[31-Oct-19 01:15 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
thanks

[31-Oct-19 01:15 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
did you just pick a random order in the order book?

[31-Oct-19 01:15 PM] coingirl87#6489
Are you doing test for prize or for being part of something big?

not trading pair has been this heavily traded in such a short timeframe, it gives us valuable insights about where to fortify etc.

[31-Oct-19 01:15 PM] Mark81#4505
picked random order
