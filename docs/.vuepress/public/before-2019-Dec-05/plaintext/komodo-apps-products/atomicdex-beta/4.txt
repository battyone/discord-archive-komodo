@ca333 I was on the initial test group. I haven't seen an invite

[16-Jul-19 12:14 AM] TonyL#3577
`Can't customize the redemption price?` price with which you can purchase depends of the maker offer, at the moment it possible to "customize" this price from mobile only in case if there is no orders for pair at all what will be changed in future release

I recommend not to swap any real coins. I did two small swaps. Both failed. I'm told there is no way to recover the funds.

[16-Jul-19 12:25 AM] TonyL#3577
@jspook16 Thanks! You should get an invatation tomorrow

[16-Jul-19 12:25 AM] SHossain#0007

Got stuck at the wallet encryption state. Also, it would be nice to have a small explanation on the effect of checking "Fast encryption"

[16-Jul-19 12:31 AM] nymkappa#9440

Are the faucets working? Can't manage to request RICK and MORTY coins from my mobile. I'm in South Korea using mobile data. Network issues for me maybe?
