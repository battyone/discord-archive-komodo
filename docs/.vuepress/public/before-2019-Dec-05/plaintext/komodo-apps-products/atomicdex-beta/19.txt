[17-Jul-19 07:02 PM] Vanncoins#3044
VRSC, already submitted the logs

[17-Jul-19 07:02 PM] Vanncoins#3044
I tried a smaller amount and it worked

[17-Jul-19 07:03 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, VRSC might have some issues with electrum servers

[17-Jul-19 07:03 PM] SHossain#0007
we will try to make that better in the next few days

[17-Jul-19 07:03 PM] Vanncoins#3044
Awesome, because I‚Äôm trying to accumulate some VRSC right now lol

I got the email that I am a beta tester for iOS. Is the app on the appstore or testflight?

[17-Jul-19 07:09 PM] SHossain#0007
testflight. if you received email, you should have also received an email from apple testflight

When using the claim rewards, I don‚Äôt see how much rewards I accumulated. It‚Äôs not a must have, but always a nice moment when you see how much you get

[17-Jul-19 07:28 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Maybe even make the coin symbols smaller or adjustable , but maybe that's just my preference . Would prefer smaller to see all coins without scrolling

[17-Jul-19 07:28 PM] SHossain#0007

"Base coin balance is 0 is to low to cover gas fee, required 0.0002" I am trying to convert 0.9 KMD to USDC, I have 1 KMD in my account. So I will be left with 0,1  enough to pay the fee. Is there any  amount for minimum atomic swap ?

[17-Jul-19 07:40 PM] cipi#4502
no min amount, but you need ETH to pay for the USDC txfee... that is how ERC20 works, you always pay txfees in ETH no matter which token you tranfer

[17-Jul-19 07:41 PM] 27aume#8635
@Gordon Komodo I would write 
10% discount if paying fees using komodo 
(that what I understand from the post)
It is 10% by holding kmd or by paying fees in kmd

[17-Jul-19 07:42 PM] yorklab#7270
@allbits You solved the issue of transactions not loading? Mine all load except Morty, then after trying Morty, none will load

[17-Jul-19 07:43 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
10% discount fee trading with KMD is already accomplished or applied

[17-Jul-19 07:43 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the one that hasn't , is the automatic deduction fee in KMD while trading

[17-Jul-19 07:44 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so that is what I am trying to do a survey on @27aume

[17-Jul-19 07:44 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the concept is by depositing KMD to a lockaddress, and fee will be deducted from that address everytime a trade is completed

[17-Jul-19 07:45 PM] MegaManEXE316#1166
Question. I received the invite for the AtomicDex Beta a couple of days ago. I want to know am I suppose to get another email to download the app?

[17-Jul-19 07:45 PM] 27aume#8635
Yes that what I meant. So a better phrasing could be:
How many of you would like 10% discount dexfee if paying fees in KMD on any pair.
Depositing KMD in a lockaddress for the purpose of fee deduction while doing trade in atomicdex? #dexit #dex-it
