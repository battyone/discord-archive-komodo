I've got an issue with the AtomicDEX android app. Once launched all I get is black screen. Any remedy?

[31-Oct-19 08:11 AM] Oszy#5734
reinstall

[31-Oct-19 08:12 AM] Alright#0419
@P3L3 happens because you recently updated, after reinstalling, shouldn't see it again

[31-Oct-19 08:14 AM] P3L3#1096
So just uninstall, reinstall. Thanks

[31-Oct-19 08:24 AM] ronyi#5719
Just a note: I think we need faster transaction. I very like the atomicdex, but this speed is very slow... we need 1-2sec transaction speed, if possible....

[31-Oct-19 08:25 AM] Aron‚ÄúXuanLeeeeee‚ÄúGoldberg#3393
the coins per swap amount doesn't matter, does it?

[31-Oct-19 08:28 AM] Artist#0765
What is the minimum transaction amount

[31-Oct-19 08:30 AM] Artist#0765
Btw it is really not that fast as I expected

[31-Oct-19 08:34 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@ronyi the speed is depending on the blockchain speed, although if the speed can be reduced to 1-2 sec (maybe somebody can solve the problem, ex: btc is using lightning network ). It would be no need for CEX

[31-Oct-19 08:35 AM] farl#9964
I hate AM and PM times. Just use 12:00 or 24:00 please.

[31-Oct-19 08:38 AM] gigamesh#3544
i had the same reaction at first. important to remember that the trade (i think) is completed quickly, but the settlement depends on the speed of the chain you are swapping with

[31-Oct-19 08:38 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
One thing that this DEX needs is price in usd

{Reactions}
üëç 

[31-Oct-19 08:39 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
And the order book, does it start with cheapest prices?

[31-Oct-19 08:40 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Can be little confusing for people who are not used

[31-Oct-19 08:41 AM] gigamesh#3544
i dont think so (but it should). devs are improving orderbooks iirc

[31-Oct-19 08:41 AM] ronyi#5719
@Gordon Komodo I know,  but this speed is not fast enough. Example: 4dc8ac47-fa7e-438d-8538-e255ca9bc264 this swap id is more than 15min in stage 1.... If we have 1m tx in 1min however imaginable...

[31-Oct-19 08:42 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
When you trade it should say in a small box what those tokens you are trading are worth in usd, so people don‚Äôt accidentally sell a lot of tokens for very little

[31-Oct-19 08:43 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Otherwise I am loving the DEX just made over 20 swaps for fun

[31-Oct-19 08:43 AM] CrisF#3405
To `Everyone working on AtomicDEX`,

Thank you so much for all you efforts.  It's awesome! üöÄ

No doubt you are going to be even busier than usual in the next couple of days and especially over the next few hours. Please know that there are many who are very grateful.

Your hard work will benefit more people than you probably realize, most of whom have not yet heard of AtomicDEX.

Much respect üôá

Have a great stress test!

the problem with 1 to 2 seconds per trade, is that it will quickly saturate any blockchain that is being actively traded that way. remember blockchain space is a finite resource and each swap is doing the equivalent of exchange deposit, trade, exchange withdraw. compare the times on that basis and atomicDEX is very fast

[31-Oct-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
if you want 1 to 2 second trades of imaginary crypto tokens that is on the CEX, then that is ok too. however, if you want to be actually trading the real crypto, you are limited by the blockchain speed and capacity

[31-Oct-19 08:48 AM] Mark81#4505
Also you have to take into account that depositing to CEX takes a lot of time too.

[31-Oct-19 08:48 AM] Mark81#4505
So in that way atomicdex is even faster!

[31-Oct-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why i am advocating the multichain approach to solving scaling, so we can have million tx/sec, but that creates another problem of terabytes of data that needs to be synced. i solve that scenario by the dual-daemon using codaprototol https://medium.com/@jameslee777/dual-daemon-chains-to-integrate-non-bitcoin-protocols-6d5b1b1f221

That is true, I have had to wait up to 3 hours after depositing to Binance. However it took  1 sec to receive coins in my AtomicDEX

[31-Oct-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
fundamentally an atomic swap is a trustless tx on two blockchains, as opposed to a CEX that is a DB entry for funds that have been deposited that has to be withdrawn. Most of the CEX now require burdensome privacy invasion to withdraw your coins. if that is ok, then you can pretend to be trading the coins in 1 to 2 seconds and trust that you will be able to withdraw your coins.

[31-Oct-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
From a maker point of view, trades takes a lot longer than a few seconds, even on CEX as they have to wait for someone to take their offer.

[31-Oct-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe having the trades taking more than a few seconds will lead to less panic based trades and more thoughtful trades? it would be fantastic if we can get the speed with all the other benefits, but without removing the blockchain throughput bottleneck and then the data storage/sync bottleneck, it seems we are stuck with the relatively slow atomic swaps.

[31-Oct-19 08:58 AM] Artist#0765
Anyways dex on mobile is an initiative I am sure with development effort it will improve by time

[31-Oct-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
once there are plenty of offers on the orderbook, the ordermatch should happen in most all cases and with 95%+ completion rate, in most cases, once matched, the trade will complete

@jl777c thank you and i understand how the basic dex working. The human nature (time is more precious) i want more speed, unfortunately i don't know the solution. I'm just trying to brainstorm..., how could be faster? Somebody sooner or later will find a solution.
