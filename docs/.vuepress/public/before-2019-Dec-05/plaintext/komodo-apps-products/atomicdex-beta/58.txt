I have installed Atomic Dex 0.1.7 on Andriod 7.0. Pincode query is disabled. Unfortunately, there is no connection to the Wallet. Just wanted to give a featback.

Hi guys, I just downloaded AtomicDex. I was able to create a seed and name my wallet. When I get to the create pin screen, I can enter a pin, but nothing happens, if I press the red arrow, it takes me back to the home screen. I have Android 9 on a Sony Xperia ZX2 compact

[07-Sep-19 07:41 PM] Philtr#9415
@gcharang I have now pincode query turned on and re-logged. Nothing has changed. I do not get a connection. could it be the Android version?

[07-Sep-19 11:07 PM] BlockTech#6895
We can't trade usdc vs kmd/vrsc on atomic dex right now ?

(can't create an order)

[07-Sep-19 11:31 PM] allbits#5898
Do you have an eth balance? It's required to trade usdc

[07-Sep-19 11:32 PM] BlockTech#6895
Oh right thank you

[08-Sep-19 12:23 AM] TonyL#3577
@Tony Stark Hello! There is no information about swap in logs. Could you please share swap UUID?

[08-Sep-19 12:25 AM] TonyL#3577
@The1earl looks like pin visualisation cut on your device because of low screen dimension, hmm. Actually it contains 6 digits but I can see only 5 boxes on the screenshot. Could you please try to input 6th digit and see if it works?

[08-Sep-19 12:42 AM] The1earl#0991
@TonyLsure

[08-Sep-19 12:46 AM] dudezmobi#1945
@TonyL thats the display problem on smaller screens

[08-Sep-19 12:46 AM] dudezmobi#1945
user wont know the 6 digit input

[08-Sep-19 12:46 AM] dudezmobi#1945
i submitted an issue, somehow it was closed and not fixed

issue #60 in work but it is closed

[08-Sep-19 01:10 AM] The1earl#0991
It worked by typing in six digits  @TonyL

[08-Sep-19 07:46 AM] Acura#2748
Is there an option to change the language inside the App ?

[08-Sep-19 07:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Nope there is no such option atm, app adjusting language to the language setup in phone settings

[08-Sep-19 08:02 AM] t0sma#0368
OK should be nice to have this optionüòÄ

[08-Sep-19 08:21 AM] TonyL#3577
@The1earl As I understand at the moment it caused on your side because of non standart font size. Screen resolution is quite huge on this phone model so shouldn‚Äôt cause such problem. There is just no space on screen to fit everything because of big label on top and numbers. If you can make font size a little bit smaller it should be fine

@tcy is it your first install of AtomicDEX on this device? Do you have pin protection enabled in settings?

[08-Sep-19 04:01 PM] tcy#8221
I am an early tester first version went fine no problem all I get is connecting and all other versions pin is disabled

[08-Sep-19 04:05 PM] jspook16#3059
What is the plan for additional coins on atomicdex? Slowly add more coins during beta testing or wait until the first release to add all coins?

[08-Sep-19 04:15 PM] mobipoi#5774
When can we expect desktop beta?

[08-Sep-19 04:16 PM] PTYX#6840
@jspook16 coins will be added slowly

[08-Sep-19 04:16 PM] PTYX#6840
Some might be added at the same time in batches but it all depends when the listing fee and agreement between the coin being listed and the komodo team is finalized.

[08-Sep-19 04:17 PM] PTYX#6840
We need to leverage not only the community of the coin we're adding, we need to monetize the listing and also levarage the community's marketing reach.

[08-Sep-19 04:44 PM] actionslacks#4072
chainlink has an insane /biz/ thing going on. coinbase listed them. I have personal doubts about the project but they would likely bring a lot of installs.

[08-Sep-19 04:50 PM] Lumbi#8378
don't know if it's been reported, but my android doesn't allow me to scroll down on the seed page to confirm the new wallet....

[08-Sep-19 04:57 PM] Lumbi#8378
@PTYX transaction fees are a better adoption model than prohibitive listing fees...

üíØ 

[08-Sep-19 05:19 PM] PTYX#6840
@Lumbi both are good strategies to create revenue streams

[08-Sep-19 05:31 PM] Lumbi#8378
@PTYX revenue streams or adoption, sometimes it comes down to priorities...

[08-Sep-19 05:33 PM] Acura#2748
It would be cool to see Dex & SuperNet Asset added to AtomicDex.
Actually i only can trade these via HyperDex üò¨

[08-Sep-19 05:36 PM] willofleo#7505
having a listing fees means coins that could bring in volume maybe excluded if they decide not to pay,

[08-Sep-19 05:54 PM] Markus#5464
isnt listing fee like 6500$ which is like nothing for many projects sitting on millions

{Reactions}
üëç 

[08-Sep-19 05:54 PM] PTYX#6840
Anyone is able to work on their own implementation of the DEX on their own app for free. Some coins will be added for free in exchange for marketing and other partnerships. However, $6500 is very accessible.

[08-Sep-19 05:55 PM] PTYX#6840
Think of it as a spam protection.

[08-Sep-19 05:57 PM] actionslacks#4072
google play store has it at 500+ installs so far. how accurate is this?

[08-Sep-19 05:58 PM] PTYX#6840
It should be accurate

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #90 log in with seed phrase stuck at encrypting wallet
Phone: Samsung S10e
To replicate: at enter unlock wallet screen, click on "sign in with seed phrase" beneath the login button. Enter seed on next screen and click confirm. For some reason, it asks for a new password creation, enter that and confirm. Read the TOS, click next. Here is gets stuck.

[08-Sep-19 07:13 PM] willofleo#7505
does the fee apply on an api level ? so all GUIs coin listing  are dependent on the coins allowed to be listed on the atomic api @PTYX

[08-Sep-19 07:15 PM] PTYX#6840
The api is free to use as far as I know.

[08-Sep-19 07:16 PM] willofleo#7505
ok so other GUIs can decide not to apply listing fee , ok got it thanks

Correct,  there is pros and cons to going straight with Atomicdex or making your own.

[08-Sep-19 07:37 PM] Geert#4612
I had identical trouble @Caglio, delete and install the application fresh if you had previously installed, and use a pin code.

[08-Sep-19 07:37 PM] Caglio#3337
I just dled it and I have pin code , ill try again

[08-Sep-19 07:40 PM] Geert#4612
@ team @Admin  i made about ten swaps from Rick and Morty and a handful real swaps, i exchanged to get VRSC and i got KMD, with other tokens, and it worked! Very good job!

[08-Sep-19 07:41 PM] Geert#4612
Add a price change information from 24h, to see my portfolio value go up or down, and it will be perfect for me. Claim reward from my Komodo balance is beautiful.

Is there a time line for when the essential kmd asset will be add, Like jumblr revs bots dex to AtomicDex? I'm not asking for a hard date. Just is it whit in the next three months or so?

[09-Sep-19 04:25 AM] dudezmobi#1945
@Caglio  it will finish just wait it out. Or you could chose not.to encrypt

[09-Sep-19 04:31 AM] dm312#9176
Is there going to be a desktop atomic dex?

[09-Sep-19 04:51 AM] TonyL#3577
@Caglio Try to kill app in this state and start again. Just reproduced issue with similar symphtoms on one of the devices (quite old with Android 6) - app actually crashed on encryption stage and because of this reason dashboard crashed too with endless Connecting. App restart helped in my case.

What Android version/device model are you using? (upd found in backlog thats it's Huawei P20. Try to create wallet with "Fast encryption" enabled. It should help)

[09-Sep-19 04:52 AM] TonyL#3577
@dm312 As far as I know desktop AtomicDEX is in future plans, yep

[09-Sep-19 04:53 AM] TonyL#3577
in general you already can use it on desktop with Android emulator or screen sharing üòÖ

[09-Sep-19 04:56 AM] TonyL#3577
@hastrup It'll be added eventually after app evolution to release version from current beta state

[09-Sep-19 05:06 AM] dm312#9176
What is cheaper, komodo dex or binanance chain?
