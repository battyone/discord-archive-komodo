Rick and Morty producer died at age 54. 

RIP

What did he know?

Are there secret messages in Rick and Morty?

[24-Sep-19 03:03 PM] Mark81#4505
Someone please tell them that rick and morty lives now as in kmd assetchain and freely tradeable with atomicdex!

Does custom fee for BTC withdrawals not work?

[25-Sep-19 07:48 AM] gcharang#6833
@euphoric85 it should work, is the fee you set not being used?

[25-Sep-19 11:39 AM] dudezmobi#1945
Can you checkout my failed transaction?

[25-Sep-19 11:53 AM] gcharang#6833
@dudezmobi is that a failed swap?
can you send us the log through DM?

[25-Sep-19 12:02 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Yeah please wait

[25-Sep-19 12:12 PM] gcharang#6833
@dudezmobi will ping you once I find the issue

[25-Sep-19 12:20 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Thank you

[25-Sep-19 12:56 PM] euphoric85#7759
@gcharang after a put in the address, amount and custom fee, and click withdraw, nothing happens. No error or anything, it just sits there. If I don‚Äôt choose custom fee it works fine

[25-Sep-19 12:56 PM] gcharang#6833
what value did you use for custom fee @euphoric85

[25-Sep-19 12:59 PM] euphoric85#7759
Several different ones, from 0.00000250 to 0.0005, none worked

[25-Sep-19 01:07 PM] Regnar#6164
@euphoric85 does your BTC address start with `1` or something else?

[25-Sep-19 01:11 PM] euphoric85#7759
@Regnar yes starts with a 1

[25-Sep-19 01:12 PM] euphoric85#7759
This is on iOS btw if that matters

Happy to be here.

Any plans of adding Beam? They seem to 'support' atomic swaps with their cli-wallet. "Atomic swap is available at Beam CLI wallet version 2.2.5635 or higher."

[25-Sep-19 02:39 PM] gcharang#6833
@euphoric85 are you using the max amount? make sure the 

"amount being withdrawn + custom fee" = "amount available"
we will make the adjustment automatic or add an error message

[25-Sep-19 02:58 PM] euphoric85#7759
Ahh that must be it, I was figuring it would auto-adjust. I‚Äôll try that

[25-Sep-19 03:07 PM] gcharang#6833
@scubapanda it looks like it is possible
but not straightforward
- their addresses are not on blockchain
- SBBS has to be integrated with MM2
- addresses are valid for 24 hours
- not sure if their demo protocol works on a mobile device (won't have a local node)

our devs are working on perfecting the existing implementation
it is definitely possible to add Beam in the future

I have 3 failed swaps again, 2 x kmd vs rfox, 1 x kmd vs hush

[25-Sep-19 03:33 PM] gcharang#6833
@Werxadler dm me the log please?

[25-Sep-19 03:38 PM] Oszy#5734
i noticed there are some LP's who are keep failing swaps

[25-Sep-19 03:38 PM] Oszy#5734
also fails when you try to swap the full amount they offer, but goes trough if you swap less then what they have

[25-Sep-19 03:40 PM] Oszy#5734
@Werxadler I loggin in now with an RFOX maker if you want to try

[25-Sep-19 03:44 PM] Werxadler#6422
@gcharang ok

[25-Sep-19 03:47 PM] Werxadler#6422
@Oszy thanks, i don't really need rfox right now, for me it is more about testing, but i will try to buy some

[25-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Oszy#5734
I don't wanna sell huge amounts either just said that I logged in now so you can test if you want with 1 rfox or whatever üôÇ

[25-Sep-19 04:16 PM] cipi#4502
@Oszy if you try to swap the entire amount, this happens: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/471
so use a slightly lower amount till it is fixed

@dudezmobi yes, the ETH will be back

@dudezmobi is your app open now? they should come back automatically

@dudezmobi if you don't get the ETH back automatically, don't delete any cache/data

I can tag the appropriate person

@McNipples has advised I speak to a developer about the potential addition of Nano to the Dex

[27-Sep-19 12:39 PM] gcharang#6833
@Andy-UK our dex implementation is based on HTLC in a utxo based blockchain or some smart contracts in ETH
I am not sure if Nano supports these
I have pinged a developer for atomicDEX, will reply once they have answered

@Andy-UK thanks for reaching out. Please open an issue ticket on the public repo https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API with your listing/addition request - fyi, we will work on more protocol integrations after towards end of or after the beta.

Hi guys, is there any way to add a current verus wallet address to atomic dex or does it have to be a newly created wallet?

[27-Sep-19 10:55 PM] AkiraX#8269
Redman

[27-Sep-19 10:55 PM] AkiraX#8269
I did the opposite

[27-Sep-19 10:55 PM] AkiraX#8269
I added my atomic dex to my verus wallet

[27-Sep-19 10:56 PM] AkiraX#8269
And it works great

[27-Sep-19 10:56 PM] AkiraX#8269
Put your mobile seed into agama

[27-Sep-19 10:56 PM] AkiraX#8269
And import the key

[27-Sep-19 10:56 PM] AkiraX#8269
To your wallet

[27-Sep-19 10:59 PM] Redman#2839
Thanks @AkiraX , I already had an address which I use. I have also done what you suggest to make it easier to send and also be able to stake from my dex address. I just wasn't sure if you could do it to save transferring between the two.
