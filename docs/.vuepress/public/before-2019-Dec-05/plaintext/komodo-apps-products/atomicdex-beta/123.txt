But as I understand it. You can calculate it though the fees collected?

[30-Nov-19 07:38 AM] Mark81#4505
That's true.

So if there is 1.5m fees collected a day then the daily volume is 1b

[30-Nov-19 01:42 PM] Acura#2748
Currently with iOS the app must remain open so the screen must not be locked - but there will be a solution how to optimize it soon.

[30-Nov-19 09:57 PM] Flint#6435
How applicable is the model in atomicDEX where the market maker no longer determines at what prices they are ready to buy or sell tokens. Instead, use a mechanism that combines everyone's liquidity and creates markets in accordance with a specific algorithm. This algorithm, known as the automated market maker (AMM), sets prices for the user according to some predefined set of rules. An example of a very simple AMM is a bot strategy, which puts out buy and sell orders exactly one dollar respectively lower and higher than the average market price and constantly reviews order placement as the market moves.

[30-Nov-19 09:58 PM] cipi#4502
it is already done... with prices from coinpaprika.com

[30-Nov-19 10:02 PM] cipi#4502

`bidmargin` and `askmargin` are compared to https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/price-converter?base_currency_id=kmd-komodo&quote_currency_id=ltc-litecoin&amount=1 (for example)

I’m talking about using an option like the “Market Result Maker Model”. (Link in the repository for review: https://github.com/runtimeverification/verified-smart-contracts/blob/uniswap/uniswap/xyk.pdf) This AMM has the feature of being able to always provide liquidity, no matter how the size of the application is large or how small the size of the liquidity pool is. The trick is to asymptotically increase the price of a coin as the desired amount of purchase or sale increases. Despite the fact that large orders are disadvantaged in this system, the system never needs to worry about a lack of liquidity. Liquidity will literally always be.

[30-Nov-19 10:10 PM] cipi#4502
you can implement whatever strategy you like through simply setting new prices for all the pairs and removing the old ones

A common liquidity pool, in combination with the above technology, would provide liquidity on demand and add value to the KMD token as a liquidity pool that is blocked on atomicDEX, which is completely absent. the question is how difficult it is at this stage to import it into the exchange or a separate browser plugin. But for this, the DeFi concept at Komodo

Just give an example, an example using the KMD / KmdUSD trading pair. Let's assume that market makers co-financed a pool of 100,000 KmdUSD and 1,000 KMD. DEX takes these two values and multiplies them (100,000 x 1000 = 100,000,000).
initial conditions: KmdUSD liquidity                    KMD liquidity                          product
                                     100,000                                         1,000                                   100,000,000
                                              x                                                     y                                                 k

[30-Nov-19 10:38 PM] Flint#6435
The purpose of DEX for this particular trading pair is to preserve the result, i.e. multiplying these two values, equal to 100 million, regardless of how many trading operations take place. The key formula to keep in mind is x * y = k, where x and y are the number of coins in the liquidity pool and k is the result. To keep the constant k, x and y must be inversely dependent, i.e. if x goes up, then y goes down, and vice versa. When a trader makes a KMD purchase under this contract, he increases x (since they add KmdUSD to the liquidity pool) and decreases y (when they remove KMDUSD from the liquidity pool). But this scheme does not scale linearly. Trying to buy 100 KMD instead of 10 KMD does not just require 10 times more KmdUSD. In fact, it increases asymptotically.

The price depends on the size of the order the further you move along the curve, the less you get for one unit of currency that you give away

[30-Nov-19 11:00 PM] Flint#6435
This is good food for thought! For example, the Chinese will give us the necessary liquidity if there are collateral DeFi instruments and stablecoin based on KMD support so I leave it here maybe someone can implement this in the form of code all the more there is the opportunity to work with python - go for it guys:KMD:

[01-Dec-19 05:37 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Flint  #cc-pegs

[01-Dec-19 08:07 AM] Flint#6435
@polycryptoblog Yes, this was discussed already, I remember! But the suggestion is to implement, at least as a plug-in in the browser, the concept of solving the liquidity problem that I described using just # cc-pegs! Moreover, the liquidity pool if it is replenished not only with stable coins tied to the dollar but also with assets such as gold and stock exchange shares, then the pool will very quickly attract those who will block their KMDs and thus increase the value of the token and the whole platform as a whole, but the problem is the market makers will be resolved

2 transactions (one from seller to swap addy and one from swap addy to buyer)= 2 fees
in fairness, both buyer and seller should cover 1 fee each

[01-Dec-19 06:24 PM] Oszy#5734
that's the dex fee

[01-Dec-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
to receive what you buy, you need to transfer the ERC20, to do that it requires ETH for the gas

[01-Dec-19 08:38 PM] Regnar#6164
I meant just ETH, not a token or anything. Exchanging KMD to ETH requires the person with KMD to also have ETH. That was what confused me, that you can't buy ETH unless you have ETH and pay the gas fee (makes sense with tokens) I figured the TX fee was paid by seller of ETH

[01-Dec-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it should be possible to spend part of the proceeds for the ETH gas fee. that isnt the case?

[01-Dec-19 08:42 PM] cipi#4502
the taker who buys the ETH also needs to pay gas afaik, because the maker (selling ETH) only pays for the tx from his address to the contract address... but the taker needs to call the contract in order to get the ETH from the contract address to his own address

[01-Dec-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
multiplied balance by 777

[01-Dec-19 08:49 PM] cipi#4502
afaik, the contract should not have any balance... the balance is just ETH/ERC20 that are still stuck from failed swaps

[01-Dec-19 08:49 PM] cipi#4502
or in transit atm

[01-Dec-19 08:50 PM] cipi#4502
to get the swapped ETH, you need to count the transactions to or from the contract

[01-Dec-19 08:54 PM] cipi#4502
a successfull ETH swap should be represented by 2 txs in the contract https://etherscan.io/address/0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871
both are shown as incoming, one has the swapped ETH value in column `Value`, the other one has 0

[01-Dec-19 08:55 PM] cipi#4502
eg
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x303d81e8bf1b514dc8212164d807f21a9d0974e0e4fe9d433c6437ed115e8a7b
and

[01-Dec-19 08:59 PM] cipi#4502
if you look closer at the second transaction, you see that it contains the call to the function `receiverSpend` of the contract
this is what transfers the ETH to the taker (buying the ETH)... and this is what costs gas for the taker... the call to this function of the contract to get the bought ETH

[01-Dec-19 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is due to ETH design that you need ETH even as taker

[01-Dec-19 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
for other coins, it isnt needed

[01-Dec-19 09:01 PM] cipi#4502
yes, or the design of the contract... i have no idea if it is possible to design the contract a bit different, so it takes the needed ETH for the gas from somewhere else (eg, maker sends a bit more ETH then needed)

[01-Dec-19 09:02 PM] cipi#4502
https://etherscan.io/address/0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871#code
this is the code... someone who knows solidity can tell us 😉

[01-Dec-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it would likely require an extra transaction, which costs more gas... and only makes sense for the first one when the taker has no ETH

[01-Dec-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
probably not unreasonable to expect someone doing ETH/ERC20 stuff to have some ETH
