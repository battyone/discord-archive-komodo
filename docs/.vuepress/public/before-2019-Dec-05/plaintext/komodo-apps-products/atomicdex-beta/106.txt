Suggestion: It would be good if the user gets a hint within the app to save trading fees if he keeps more than 10kmd on his address. üòâ :tux_rocknroll:

Are you going to use the "news" section for news? I was expecting the stress test announcement appear there in-app as well, as other things maybe changelogs or  "what's new"

[01-Nov-19 12:25 PM] ca333#0118
Yes we will be using the news tab more often @Oszy

Not a single order of mine reached 1/3 for the test

[01-Nov-19 05:04 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
How are coin fund totals determined, where are prices being pulled?  I noticed DEX has no price, although sold for about 30 kmd

[01-Nov-19 05:04 PM] Bastol#5205
Tooday they're like lol 10sec 3/3

[01-Nov-19 05:05 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Bastol  the Network was being spammed for the test, we needed to see what would break under heavy load

[01-Nov-19 05:08 PM] Bastol#5205
@polycryptoblog hope you got some good data

[01-Nov-19 05:15 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
Hi, something strange, i make a swap, sell Kmd for Dex, i received Dex have 1 confirmation, but on history is showed like "swap failed", "unlock funds"

[01-Nov-19 05:20 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Submit log file seems like a bug.  Does the unlock funds button do anything might just be a visual bug

The @AtomicDex STRESS TEST was CRAZY!
$KMD #KOMODO üí™

Over 2000 ppl trying to crush it
And so we CRUSHED it
And it was GOOD

And even tho at first I was sad I did so badly in the competition

Later I remembered the IMPORTANT THINGS

@cryptoclueless  prices and amounts available are set by the trader offering it

[01-Nov-19 05:25 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
Yes I understand a swap is based off the prices offered by the trader.  I'm looking specifically of the value within my wallet.  If i have 10 kmd, there is a value listed in my wallet.  If I have 1 DEX, there is no value listed.  The wallet value is pulling prices from something, just curious what that is.  It makes sense because I dont think DEX is shown on coinmarketcap or coingecko, etc

[01-Nov-19 05:26 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
@polycryptoblog Just send you the log file and what shows when i click the unlock funds button on dm üëç

[01-Nov-19 06:20 PM] mobipoi#5774
Nice to see the news features is being used,

[01-Nov-19 06:21 PM] mobipoi#5774
Does the app add it own fees on top of dex fees? it seems so

[01-Nov-19 06:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How do you mean?

[01-Nov-19 06:22 PM] mobipoi#5774
What I wrote

[01-Nov-19 06:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
1/777 is the fee. x% of that goes to the creator, the rest to DEX holders

[01-Nov-19 06:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think

[01-Nov-19 06:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The percentage was 15% or so?

[01-Nov-19 06:23 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Also transaction fees

[01-Nov-19 06:23 PM] mobipoi#5774
Ok I'll check again was trying to test stable but looks a bit expensive

[01-Nov-19 06:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah yes tx fees!

[01-Nov-19 06:23 PM] mobipoi#5774
Ok so there are more fees on top of dex

[01-Nov-19 06:23 PM] mobipoi#5774
Fees

[01-Nov-19 06:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Tx fees are usually not that big %wise

[01-Nov-19 06:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And are only a natural side effect of it being atomic swaps depending on on-chain transactions for each pair

[01-Nov-19 06:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd and assetchains are 0.0001kmd regardless of amount

[01-Nov-19 06:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Eth can be expensive depending on gascost

[01-Nov-19 06:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Btc...

[01-Nov-19 06:31 PM] mobipoi#5774
Up to 3% above market

[01-Nov-19 06:34 PM] Mark81#4505
Looks like i maded to the wap list with two swaps on last minute of stress test, Yikes!

[01-Nov-19 06:37 PM] mobipoi#5774
We it be possible to add a search list for coins and a tab for all category such as stable , eth based , btc etc...  @TonyL

[01-Nov-19 06:55 PM] heguli97#5781
lol looking at my stats 7 succeful and over 80 failed swaps

[01-Nov-19 06:55 PM] heguli97#5781
almost 10% success rate

[01-Nov-19 06:58 PM] TonyL#3577
@mobipoi there are such filters on coins activation page + special indicators in the dashboard for ERC and Komodo smart-chains

[01-Nov-19 06:58 PM] Jimm B.#9993
I see 30 successful swaps in my history. the leaderboard shows only 25.
How do I know if I was maker or taker?
Only the takers are counted?

[01-Nov-19 06:59 PM] Mark81#4505
only takers

[01-Nov-19 07:00 PM] TonyL#3577
It was very hard to find out all the data because of the issues dex network experienced during the stress-test. But no worries - all participants are in the same boat (like a approx same probability of some not-counted swaps)

[01-Nov-19 07:00 PM] TonyL#3577
25 it's still much more than most of the participants üôÇ

[01-Nov-19 07:01 PM] TonyL#3577
So you have x25 chances to win over the testers who got 1 swap

[01-Nov-19 07:01 PM] Jimm B.#9993

[01-Nov-19 07:02 PM] TonyL#3577

[01-Nov-19 07:05 PM] Jimm B.#9993
The test was also fun ... even if it was hard.  I would have joined in if there were no prizes.  I did less than 5 swaps on the mm1 stress test and it was still fun to be there.

[01-Nov-19 07:07 PM] Jimm B.#9993
the progress of Komodo is all that matters.

Hey there, I also get a swap going in the last minute. But I couldn't see me on the list.

[01-Nov-19 10:24 PM] ca333#0118
If you can't find yourself on the list although you executed a successful or failed swap (at least reached status 1/3) please send a DM to @TonyL or @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator - our team will pick up the winners from https://oracle.earth/mm2_stresstest_combined_leaderboard/ and publish the information tomorrow as it took much longer to parse and analyse the whole dataset. We will also randomly send bounties to participants that couldn't execute a successful swap.

[01-Nov-19 10:32 PM] Artist#0765
And what about who did like 2 or 3 successful swaps @ca333

[01-Nov-19 10:39 PM] ca333#0118
They qualify for the lottery like raffle and get more tickets assigned = higher chance of winning the big prize.

here Dear participants of the first AtomicDEX stress test, we've updated participants swaps list (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IHBSY7LbEcGCVPXd3FAs8-1QxrXxzlV8/view?usp=sharing) with more found succesful and unsuccesful swaps data. If you can't find your address (but had succesful or failed RICK<->MORTY swaps during the stress-test) in the list please DM me. There is deadline 4 hours from now to send me DM and then the list will be final. Thank you! üëç

Hi @TonyL

[02-Nov-19 07:06 AM] gigamesh#3544
does this still apply?:

[02-Nov-19 07:06 AM] gigamesh#3544
> And we will also randomly honor testers that didn't make it to the leaderboard at all.

[02-Nov-19 07:09 AM] gigamesh#3544
secondly, im 99.9% sure i got a screen saying i had a successful swap, yet can find no evidence of it in explorer, DEX order history etc. Is there any point in me sending logs to confirm whether or not this event occurred or should i assume from the explorers it didnt?

[02-Nov-19 07:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi! Yes, that‚Äôs still apply üôÇ You can check your RICK/MORTY addresses tx history on explorers - if there are transactions to b address that‚Äôs most probably means that swap was performed

[02-Nov-19 07:28 AM] ciumete#3212
for the stress test correct criteria to win the prizes is on total number of swapps!

[02-Nov-19 07:29 AM] ciumete#3212
no mather if is susccessful or not !!!

[02-Nov-19 07:32 AM] TonyL#3577
yep, in case of 0 succesful swaps one matched swap (1/3 stage) granting 1 raffle ticket (up to 1 in total)

[02-Nov-19 07:40 AM] gigamesh#3544
so i shouldnt bother sending logs then @TonyL ?

[02-Nov-19 07:42 AM] TonyL#3577

Hi @TonyL

[02-Nov-19 08:04 AM] Artist#0765
On the list it only says I performed 2

[02-Nov-19 08:04 AM] Artist#0765
But 2 were successful I performed more then 100

[02-Nov-19 08:05 AM] Artist#0765
It says 2 succesful 100 percent

[02-Nov-19 08:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @Artist ! Attempts not granting additional tickets. If attempts not counted as failed swaps (what also not granting tickets) it means that it was failed before the ordermatching and not possible to track/count

[02-Nov-19 08:07 AM] Artist#0765
So what about succesful attempts

[02-Nov-19 08:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Do you have more than 2 succesful swaps?

[02-Nov-19 08:08 AM] Artist#0765
Nop 2 successful
