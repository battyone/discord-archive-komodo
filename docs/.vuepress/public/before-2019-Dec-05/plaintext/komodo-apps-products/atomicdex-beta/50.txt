[09-Aug-19 05:18 PM] 차미숙#8912

[09-Aug-19 05:18 PM] 차미숙#8912

Thank you for report.
What version of the application are you using? @dudezmobi

[10-Aug-19 09:41 AM] Oszy#5734
fully uninstall and reinstall the app if you have poroblems after the update

[10-Aug-19 09:44 AM] Oszy#5734
UI/UX is very laggy / freezing in new version can confirm.

[10-Aug-19 09:44 AM] Oszy#5734
almost unusable

[10-Aug-19 09:52 AM] Oszy#5734
I am taking it back, my phone went crazy, interestingly it only affected Atomicdex 😄

[10-Aug-19 09:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Thats very strange, working without lags even on my very old Xiaomi Redmi S3

[10-Aug-19 09:56 AM] Oszy#5734
for some reason when my phone was  on charger it went laggy 😂

[10-Aug-19 10:06 AM] ca333#0118
@Oszy can you confirm the UI is laggy? @TonyL plz check.

[10-Aug-19 10:09 AM] TonyL#3577

@ca333  it still happens, dont know the reason why, i just restarted the app and it's lagging again

[10-Aug-19 12:26 PM] Oszy#5734
reason of my restart was BCH was stuck on activating

[10-Aug-19 12:27 PM] Oszy#5734

this seems to be a similar issue to Oszy's laggy ui/freezing

on beta test. so far so good.

[10-Aug-19 02:47 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, this channel belongs to the GUI (mobile DEX): https://atomicdex.io
and it is in beta testing

the backend can be used seperately and all the coins I mentioned above are tradeable if two sides of a trade are available

Could you please provide a little bit more details please? In what case order is unfulfilled and where it's not displaing? Are you acting as maker or taker?

[11-Aug-19 07:35 AM] ca333#0118
yes @dudezmobi - for now uninstall/reinstall resolve it. The update process is not fully clean yet. Some "old" app-data persists which is likely leading to this situation. We will improve this for next release.
