@ferjr90 don't know that, i am not using mobile... i think it depends on the OS, how it is handling "background"... if the network is shut down when in background, it will not work

Hey guys not sure if this has been mentioned, but I ended up going in circles when using 4 digit pin instead of 6. Wasn't prompted to use 6 and it stuck on 'encrypting wallet' for ages. When I restarted the app the wallet was there but I couldn't unlock it. Fixed now, but thought I mention it.

Hello. So I have those swaps which failed (timeout) more than 24h ago and my funds did not returned properly. I made some test running the app in power saver mode and I think the app is put to sleep when I switch to another one (not by killing it). Thereofe I guess this makes the swap fails.
The thing is it also happened while running in performance mode.
There is definitely something wrong if  the app is not focused and active.

It's almost nithing, but for the sake of learning, is there anything I can attempt to do in order to recover the failed sawp funds?

Ex: e4e51deb-497f-4b65-b6d0-f689d5763095
Requested 1.7803 KMD for 61.6907 RFOX.
My balance shows 0 KMD.

`Is there an atomic swap explorer that we can review the swap id, maker id and taker id` there is no such explorer at the moment, it's possible to check information about your swap (from your side) in logs (and logs possible to get by `Settings -> Send feedback` feature)

[22-Jul-19 01:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Dear testers, please `do not swap RVN until the next AtomicDEX update`.
RVN electrum servers which using in at the moment in the app very unstable, what causing almost all RVN swaps fails. 
We already prepared own RVN electrums infrastructure and it's under testing at the moment so in next release we'll have stable ones 🤞

Hi - how do i get ver 0.13? I am on iOS and got v0.12 from testflight via the email that came through. Testflight still showing old version. Also - i have a timeout swap from a few days ago that hasn't returned my coin depsite various restarts etc. where is best to send the logs? In general though 95% swap all done without problem so long as i keep the app active and not in the background - pretty awesome!! cant wait to play with next version 😃

[22-Jul-19 07:29 AM] ca333#0118
@miles iOS takes always few days more for the version upgrade as apple requires a application approval process. The 0.1.3-a for iOS likely available in the next 2-3 days.

0.1.3-a

[22-Jul-19 09:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Coins loading process was improved in latest mm2 release which was bundled in 0.1.3a, but at the moment mm2 binary not updating when you using "Update" button in playmarket (it'll be fixed in next releases).
So would be great if you try to uninstall current app first and then install 0.1.3-a again. (at first please ensure that you control seed from your wallet to restore it)

Found a strange UI bug: On the portfolio page, if you swipe up or down to scroll through the active coins, and you tap a coin before the scrolling comes to a complete stop, it doesn’t open the coin’s transaction history, instead it just makes the position of the list jump/skip.

[22-Jul-19 09:46 PM] Mr. Orange#4717
Hello.  I have some feed back on the mobile DEX.  Very good so far.  I have done 11 swaps.  6 Timeout failures.  For some reason, the tactile feedback on entering my pin could be more sensitive.  For the 6 number password, it often only registers 5 numbers. Not sure why, but it happens more often than not.  Also, when a atomic swap fails, it would be better to have the error message stay up until you confirm OK.  Many times I am trying to read the error message but it dissapears before I finish reading it.  Overall, the mobile DEX is impressive and I am excited for Komodo's future.  Keep up the great work. 👌 (I just realized I posted this is the wrong section, earlier...my apologizes)
