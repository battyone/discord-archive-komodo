If not said here.

yep, Malti and me mentioned it above

[17-Jul-19 06:13 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll create an issue for this

[17-Jul-19 06:16 PM] Mark81#4505
And is there possibility to give an estimation of time for swaps to be complete based on like last few blocktimes on swap pairs?

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #17 Notifications Feature Request
Please add notifications for:
1. When coins received
2. Coins successfully sent
3. KMD reward claim successful
4. Swap started
5. Swap completed

[17-Jul-19 06:17 PM] SHossain#0007
@Mark81 different coin has different confirmation time, i dont' think we can predict this as this also has to take on account on connectivity

[17-Jul-19 06:18 PM] SHossain#0007
blocks are not 100% consistent and rely on mining

[17-Jul-19 06:19 PM] SHossain#0007
we will get more complains if the estimated time is not right

[17-Jul-19 06:20 PM] jansako#3330
ETA can change as swap progress hapens

[17-Jul-19 06:21 PM] Mark81#4505
Yes variates but we are talking about only giving like time based on last blocks. It helps to know if we are seeing blocktimes longer than normal.

[17-Jul-19 06:21 PM] SHossain#0007
i understand. you guys will not complain. but, there are plenty other users who will just dislike or complain if the estimated time is not correct and changing

[17-Jul-19 06:22 PM] SHossain#0007
steps are there to give you better understanding of what is happening

[17-Jul-19 06:23 PM] SHossain#0007
that's definately a good suggestion.

[17-Jul-19 06:24 PM] Mark81#4505
Ok, how about deep dive from default view to advanced  info what is really happening on blockchain level?

[17-Jul-19 06:26 PM] Markus#5464
There is a bug in swapping kmd to vrsc, if i select kmd and write 0.1 i can choose any coin i want to recieve and 0.1 will stay but if i choose vrsc it changes 0.1 to something else

[17-Jul-19 06:26 PM] t0sma#0368
I have an issue. There is no historic data. Does it work for you? Same for all coin. Picture above

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #13: Short click on coin \- trade option
I mean when you are ‘in’ the coin. Where you can see your Tx history on e.g. kmd or eth. There you only have the send receive option. Not swap

[17-Jul-19 06:28 PM] Malti#3948
@SHossain flight mode doesn’t seem to be able to push the swap through. Waited 20+ minutes

[17-Jul-19 06:29 PM] SHossain#0007
no internet = no swap

[17-Jul-19 06:29 PM] Malti#3948
Good to have tested tho

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[17-Jul-19 06:29 PM] SHossain#0007
if there is a few second gap in internet connection, the app might resume the swap

[17-Jul-19 06:30 PM] SHossain#0007
but not always 100% guaranteed

[17-Jul-19 06:30 PM] nymkappa#9440
Sell me your rfox people. Cmc rate ahah :D

[17-Jul-19 06:32 PM] nymkappa#9440
Talking about rates, it could be nice to fetch the rate from oracles instead of having to compute your own, when we will be able to always set our own rates. Could also have some laddering like "Sell 5% premium / discount"

[17-Jul-19 06:32 PM] allbits#5898
@t0sma I've been having the same issue for the last half hour or more. Also not seeing any order books. Is this a possible networking issue?

[17-Jul-19 06:34 PM] SHossain#0007
@Hollowman9000 did you test any swaps yet?

[17-Jul-19 06:36 PM] allbits#5898
So he can't

[17-Jul-19 06:36 PM] SHossain#0007
he loves RICK & MORTY :abused_smiley:

[17-Jul-19 06:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Chronobank trading is like desecration of a corpse, you’re not supposed to disturb the dead in their final resting place

[17-Jul-19 06:39 PM] t0sma#0368
@allbits  yeah maybe network issue.

[17-Jul-19 06:40 PM] allbits#5898
Anyone have any ideas about this. It's persisting?

[17-Jul-19 06:40 PM] SHossain#0007
try clearing app cache or restarting phone

[17-Jul-19 06:41 PM] SHossain#0007
hope you are not using a mining address

[17-Jul-19 06:42 PM] allbits#5898
Tried restart already. Not using mining address. Same thing for all coins

[17-Jul-19 06:42 PM] allbits#5898
Also no order books

[17-Jul-19 06:43 PM] SHossain#0007
there might be some issues with VRSC electrum servers

[17-Jul-19 06:44 PM] SHossain#0007
we need nSPV 😃

[17-Jul-19 06:44 PM] allbits#5898
It's every coin

[17-Jul-19 06:44 PM] SHossain#0007
hmmmm....maybe connection issue then? can't be all coins

[17-Jul-19 06:45 PM] Oszy#5734

can't see any coins tx history

[17-Jul-19 06:45 PM] allbits#5898
If its connection issue, it's not my hardware. @t0sma experiencing the same thing

[17-Jul-19 06:45 PM] Oszy#5734
keeps loading forever

[17-Jul-19 06:46 PM] allbits#5898
And @Oszy now too

[17-Jul-19 06:46 PM] Mark81#4505
If swap is ongoing I have run into same issue.

[17-Jul-19 06:46 PM] Oszy#5734
it's like this since I first installed yesterday. Balances are ok, swaps are fine, but tx history never loads, any coin.

[17-Jul-19 06:47 PM] t0sma#0368
same

[17-Jul-19 06:47 PM] 27aume#8635
Little issue with test coin morty, cant load trade history from coin tab

[17-Jul-19 06:47 PM] SHossain#0007
what are the exact steps that i can reproduce this issue?

[17-Jul-19 06:47 PM] SHossain#0007
i started a RICK/MORTY swap and checking all other tx history. all working for me

[17-Jul-19 06:47 PM] allbits#5898
Also not seeing exchange history anymore

[17-Jul-19 06:48 PM] SHossain#0007
ok

[17-Jul-19 06:48 PM] Mark81#4505
Try do swap and go watch balances then of same coin.

[17-Jul-19 06:48 PM] SHossain#0007
never mind

[17-Jul-19 06:48 PM] SHossain#0007
got it

[17-Jul-19 06:48 PM] SHossain#0007
while a swap is running, this happens

[17-Jul-19 06:48 PM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 is this expected behaviour?

[17-Jul-19 06:48 PM] Oszy#5734
I'll restart phone now see if it solves

[17-Jul-19 06:48 PM] SHossain#0007
no no

[17-Jul-19 06:49 PM] SHossain#0007
this happens when you have a swap running

[17-Jul-19 06:49 PM] Oszy#5734
exact steps are > open atomicdex > click on any coin 😄

[17-Jul-19 06:49 PM] ca333#0118
while swapping the balance of coins will change - yes.

[17-Jul-19 06:49 PM] allbits#5898
We don't have swaps running

[17-Jul-19 06:49 PM] Oszy#5734
also, many times i have to fully quit app and restart to refresh balance or get rid of connection lost message

[17-Jul-19 06:50 PM] ca333#0118
@SHossain can you please send me the reproduction steps of this issue.

[17-Jul-19 06:50 PM] SHossain#0007
start a swap, while swaps are running, go back to Portfolio page and click on differet coins, it will show loading animation circle

[17-Jul-19 06:50 PM] SHossain#0007
exact steps

[17-Jul-19 06:50 PM] Oszy#5734
It does that without swap for me as well

[17-Jul-19 06:50 PM] ca333#0118
@Oszy swipe down in the portfolio view (coin list) to update balances manually.

[17-Jul-19 06:50 PM] 27aume#8635
same here

[17-Jul-19 06:52 PM] ca333#0118
I will investigate and trying to reproduce now.

[17-Jul-19 06:52 PM] allbits#5898
Issue is not showing transaction history, not showing swap history, not showing order books

[17-Jul-19 06:52 PM] JonnyBioICX#1730

Hello I am testing the DEX how long should the DEX swap take ?

[17-Jul-19 06:54 PM] SHossain#0007
@allbits @Oszy thanks for reporting this bug/issue

[17-Jul-19 06:55 PM] JonnyBioICX#1730

👍 

[17-Jul-19 06:55 PM] SHossain#0007
we will look further and investigate

[17-Jul-19 06:57 PM] Vanncoins#3044
Anyone wanna sell me some Veruscoin? Currently there’s not enough to make a swap

[17-Jul-19 06:57 PM] SHossain#0007
have you tried RICK and MORTY first?

[17-Jul-19 06:58 PM] SvetJordanov#9163
3 minutes with RICK and MORTY to swap! Great work, will try with Komodo now

[17-Jul-19 06:59 PM] JonnyBioICX#1730
