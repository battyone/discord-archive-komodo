Also, when attempting to create an order (since there were no existing orders in the book), it refuses my order telling me the minimum trade for BTC is .00777 BTC. If this is a rule (and not a  bug) it would be nice to list it in a FAQ section.

Minimum trade amount is 0.00777 for all coins yes, and AtomicDEX automatically reducing txfee and taker fee - thats why you can see amount less than your balance

Can you tell me how to reproduce please, this is a new seed ? I can't reproduce in my side.

@Vanncoins Its true only for iOS. I will make a issue for this.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #41: Withdraw transaction history shows source address as destination if less than whole balance sent\.
To reproduce just send not whole balance of any UTXO based coin not to yourself. Change address (your atomicdex receiving address) will be displayed in detailed tx history in "To" field (recipient)

Its because you don’t have enough RICK. So if you try to put more than your balance the field is clean.

1 DGB price is around 0.01$, 10000 DGB selling is just 100$ order. So it would be great if it'll be possible to input >4 digits into this field.

[24-Jul-19 02:25 PM] Cryptonian#5022
@TonyL Okay. So there is no maker fee, but there is a taker fee of 0.015%, what is the txfee?

[24-Jul-19 02:49 PM] pbcpaintballer#0834
Got the email to download and start testing but the play store still says "coming soon" and I cant actually start the download. Is there something I need to do prior to actually downloading?

@pbcpaintballer Hi! Could you please try this link? https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex

[24-Jul-19 02:54 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptonian txfee for BTC isn't hardcoded calculating dynamically from AtomicDEX protocol side, let me find out how it's calculating 😃

[24-Jul-19 02:57 PM] TonyL#3577
In general you'll see it before broadcasting confirmation, last time I've tried to send BTC fee was around 0.0005

[24-Jul-19 02:59 PM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2/mm2src/coins/utxo.rs#L1681 for BTC it's calculating as "Dynamic" in case of electrum mode usage (which AtomicDEX is using), and this dynamic is taking from electrumx protocol if I understand correct. I think @artem.pikulin or @artemciy_dice can explain precise how this fee calculating

if funds are spent, does it cancel all orders automatically related to that coin?

[24-Jul-19 03:29 PM] Oszy#5734
or does it stay and will get executed when i have that coin again?

[24-Jul-19 03:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a case when you have KMD/RVN KMD/DOGE lets say and somebody sell you some DOGE and you don't have enough KMD to pay for KMD/RVN order?

[24-Jul-19 03:30 PM] Oszy#5734
yes

[24-Jul-19 03:31 PM] Oszy#5734
if  KMD balance goes to 0

[24-Jul-19 03:31 PM] TonyL#3577
I don't think that order will be cancelled automatically in such case - most probably second swap will just fail on maker txfee (in case of balance == 0) or maker payment tx broadcasting stage (in case if balance < maker payment)

[24-Jul-19 03:33 PM] Oszy#5734
should it be removed tho?  is it going to make a difference in bigger scales for the mm2 if it's filled with many active orders that can't be filled because of this?

[24-Jul-19 03:34 PM] Oszy#5734
also to avoid failed swaps

[24-Jul-19 03:36 PM] TonyL#3577
It's better to ask in #dev-marketmaker , I'm not 100% sure on this part of protocol logic

[24-Jul-19 05:40 PM] 27aume#8635

in ios 0.1.3 version if u go to DEX after u select a coin to trade u have "max" button, if u go to portfolio and swipe a coin and press swap then u dont have "max" button

[24-Jul-19 06:32 PM] ca333#0118
yw @Dyeles - you may have to deinstall and reinstall if RVN misbehaves

[24-Jul-19 06:33 PM] Dyeles#8347

[24-Jul-19 06:34 PM] t0sma#0368
I can't uninstall  because TonyL asks me to don't do that. I have blocked 9 KMD locked after a failed swap. He is working on my issue and need to contact mm2.0 devs.  @ca333

[24-Jul-19 06:34 PM] ca333#0118
@t0sma - did you have a RVN issue ?

[24-Jul-19 06:35 PM] ca333#0118
if you are not planning to use RVN for now you can update (without deinstalling!)

[24-Jul-19 06:35 PM] private guy#0631
@SvetJordanov is the iOS 0.1.3 version alpha in store? or beta using TestFlight?

[24-Jul-19 06:35 PM] ca333#0118
@private guy it will take 1-2 days before 0.1.4 is available in testflight

[24-Jul-19 06:36 PM] Markus#5464
then 0.1.5 will be rdy to be tested when ios just got 0.1.4 🤔

@t0sma will re-release a version that also updates the config files during the playstore update process so that your swap data persists. We will notify you upon availability (working on this right now).

[24-Jul-19 06:46 PM] t0sma#0368
