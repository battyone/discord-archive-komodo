[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #103: \[OTH issues\] listing fee issue
Thanks @dudezmobi 

To sum it up.

Cost to a developer to list their cryptocurrency on the atomicDEX GUI = $6,500.00 USD

Funding paid to a developer to develop a real cryptocurrency without an ICO = $0 USD

Cost of setting up and maintaining an SPV electrumx server = Roughly $5-10 USD per month

Cost of setting up integration with atomicGUI with a cryptocurrency already operating on the underlying layer MM2 / jl777/COINS repo = Maybe a few hours if that of "work"

The price just ...

I believe that the app has been translated into Japanese already.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #101: Order persists in orderbook after withdrawing funds
Thank you for the issue.
However, it is not a directly GUI issue and it seems that it's better to resolve it on protocol side (if there is easy solution for sure). From other side it's possible to add handler to GUI if it's hard to implement in API. 
Moving this one to relevant repo for evaluation (sorry in advance if it's duplicate)

@Dochteur Barterdex was a GUI for a previous version of the Komodo DEX protocol. At the moment it‚Äôs a next generation already with new GUIs and barterdex is deprecated

[06-Oct-19 05:25 PM] TonyL#3577
@t0sma  bug fixes in this patch, yep. Some iOS specific bugs fixed, few optimizations were made so the app consumes much less resources (before my iPhone was hot as Arizona desert, but now never ). Also very important modification for troubleshooting and support: app logs larger now and can contain more than one session
