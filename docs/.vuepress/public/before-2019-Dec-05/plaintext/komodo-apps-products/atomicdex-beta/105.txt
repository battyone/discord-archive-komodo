we do def. include this in the refactoring and general spam-countermeasures - so even if it is being targeted we are confident to optimize the DEX system to be able to handle very high load as aforementioned by jl777

[31-Oct-19 09:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if a nationstate does a petabyte/sec Ddos against all the nodes... well nothing can withstand that, but short of some sustained insane level Ddos, with graceful degradation, things would be slower but not stopped. also, when we add filtering by known pubkeys, that will filter out a lot of spam

[31-Oct-19 09:34 PM] jl777c#5810
this was the first atomicDEX stress test, it wasnt able to handle the load that was a lot higher than we expected

[31-Oct-19 09:34 PM] jspook16#3059
I understand, I just want to get an idea of what is expected as it progresses

[31-Oct-19 09:34 PM] jl777c#5810
the key is for the load handling to continuously improve and we certainly have a lot of ideas on how to do this

[31-Oct-19 09:34 PM] jl777c#5810
as things progress, this level of traffic will become easy to handle

[31-Oct-19 09:34 PM] jl777c#5810
then a higher level

[31-Oct-19 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810
after that, it seems it is ready for mass usage

[31-Oct-19 09:36 PM] jspook16#3059
what would you consider mass usage? on par with a typical CEX?

[31-Oct-19 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
what is a typical CEX?

[31-Oct-19 09:36 PM] jspook16#3059
suppose one of the more popular ones...with high usage

[31-Oct-19 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
anything other than the major top CEX level of traffic i dont see any issues with, as the trade volumes are really not that big

[31-Oct-19 09:37 PM] jspook16#3059
Copy

[31-Oct-19 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
we cant have lot of small orders due to blockchain based

[31-Oct-19 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is possible to handle binance level trades, but that is not realistic for the blockchains to support, so it seems a moot point. really the load that needs to be able to handle is whatever load the blockchains can handle

[31-Oct-19 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
and that is much less than the major CEX trade counts

[31-Oct-19 09:39 PM] ca333#0118
`what would you consider mass usage?` - being able to handle loads comparable to any CEX BUT with the big diff. that we will be able to scale this up dynamically - so even if the technical limits are reached (e.g. ~65k ports ) a dynamical scaling would allow us to cover hundreds of thousands if not millions of users once the system is near perfection.

[31-Oct-19 09:39 PM] ca333#0118
yes - blockchains being a limitation too - agree on that.

[31-Oct-19 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
100 swaps per second, per orderbook seems the max the blockchain side can handle

[31-Oct-19 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
that is 6000 users doing a swap per minute (5 to 10 in parallel)

[31-Oct-19 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
which actually might be a level we touched today!

{Reactions}
✅ (4) 

[31-Oct-19 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so when we can handle 6000 users doing 1 swap per minute, that handles the blockchain capacity

[31-Oct-19 09:41 PM] ca333#0118
on the other hand your multichain scalability solution could even bring the tech beyond this swap limit at some point in the future

[31-Oct-19 09:42 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, a cluster of fungible chains can do 100 tx/sec per chain, but we can isolate the trading of each on in a different netid

[31-Oct-19 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
which means the 6000 users doing 1 swap per minute, per fungible chain can be handled across the netids

[31-Oct-19 09:44 PM] fat3lvis#6079
It seems an average trade time, or network traffic indicator would be helpful right now. As it is we are just trading blindly, not know if there is a technical issue with our swap, or if it is just network saturation

[31-Oct-19 09:47 PM] fat3lvis#6079
And is order queueing handled right now? I never waited more than a few minutes today. Would a swap go through eventually or are swaps attempted beyond the network capacity just going nowhere?

[31-Oct-19 09:52 PM] jl777c#5810
once the network got saturated, it is like a door that had too many people trying to use it at once. some made it through, but most were colliding with others trying to get through.

[31-Oct-19 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
we did not expect 2000 simultaneous swap attempts for this first stress test, but that is what allowed to find where things meltdown first

[31-Oct-19 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
round 2, we will do much better, but it is not easy to reproduce such high levels of activity short of doing a public stress test, so until the next one, we wont know for 100% sure if the improvements are enough

[31-Oct-19 09:59 PM] phm87#7395
it is possible to reproduce with neoload but it is a huge work

very high load when the stress test started 😮

[31-Oct-19 10:12 PM] Andersen#8337
someone  spaming  ?

[31-Oct-19 10:12 PM] SHossain#0007
no. that is the stress test load

[31-Oct-19 10:12 PM] SHossain#0007
from 2 seed node servers

[31-Oct-19 10:13 PM] SHossain#0007
at 12pm it peaked as everyone joined the stress testing to get swaps done

[31-Oct-19 10:25 PM] Goku#9007
Hello,
I got a question about a possible collaboration between AtomicDex and Coinomi.
What do dev's think about for being able directly from Coinomi to initiate atomic swaps?

It would bring to the most crypto users access to this awesome technology.

[31-Oct-19 10:32 PM] ca333#0118
Hi @Goku - we are usually very open for all sort of collaborations. Please contact our Chief Strategist @Steve Lee

@ca333 "DEX app itself is very stable - i.e. no crashs" while I haven't had the app outright crash and close itself, I have to basically restart it every time I use it because it seems to be unable to reopen connectivity once I switch away from it. Or even just going back from the order book and trying to open it again. It will go from showing say 7-10 orders to 1 to 'create an order'

[31-Oct-19 11:18 PM] ca333#0118
thank you for the info @Patrick Crypto - can you please send me more infos (operating system version, smartphone device and atomicDEX mobile version) - will investigate this and try to reproduce.

[31-Oct-19 11:25 PM] Stinkfist#7610
Hi, I was unable to make any swaps, tried for hours.. one of my main issues is most of the time, including now is the Rick and Morty coins were not available to even try to make any swaps. Seems quite unfair to have a contest that people that tried to enter could not...there was one time I was able to try to make some swaps and tried about 40 different ones, but not one even really tried to go through...I know a stress test is supposed to fail, but maybe the requirements to be eligible to win the contest should not have been related to active swaps...

[31-Oct-19 11:26 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Stinkfist, do you mean that you didn't get coins from the faucet?

[31-Oct-19 11:30 PM] louchristopher#4954
I had more than 130 attempted swaps but only 2 successful swaps went through. Did we have to have 30 successful swaps for the lottery?

[31-Oct-19 11:34 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @louchristopher, I'm envious :abusedsmily: I had quite a few attempts but no luck.
I believe the final results are still been checked.  Some logs were sent in later.

@louchristopher no - we reduced the reqs so even if no swaps went through but you re listed in the leaderboard you do qualify. And we will also randomly honor testers that didn't make it to the leaderboard at all.

on closer inspection i cannot see any evidence of the successful swap i thought i had... was i dreaming?

@CrisF I was able get the faucet, but most of the time they showed up as unconfirmed, I got them to show up maybe twice, we’ll the morty ones did the rick ones never showed up at any point

[01-Nov-19 12:12 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @benzo365 ,  I was the same.  the most recent trade I started, just after your message, got a match.

[01-Nov-19 12:14 AM] CrisF#3405
@Stinkfist Good that you were able to have a chance to trade then.  What did the explorer say about the RICK?

[01-Nov-19 12:16 AM] gigamesh#3544
played with Chainswap a couple days ago. iirc both parties had to be online to perform a swap. is the same true of atomic?

Just wanted to post something I noticed , last night about 12 hours or so before the test is when I first noticed the slowness of rick and morty swaps, I switched to doing other coin demos for a bit.

[01-Nov-19 06:10 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The main difference between earlier swaps and that period was the orderbook size .
