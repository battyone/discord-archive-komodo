Are there any estimates to the number of orders it takes to bottleneck the network currently @TonyL

[31-Oct-19 02:48 PM] tgrunft#7951
got one completed as failed so thats progress too

[31-Oct-19 02:48 PM] Yaconx#4625
Obviously the 777 reward goes to no one I can‚Äôt get one trade let alone 30. I hope this exercise was worth it for the network because I‚Äôve made a lot of effort for very little made a ton of orders for not one to get past 0 step of 3

[31-Oct-19 02:48 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I think I helped bottle necked it before the test even started..... I had 100+ orders out there.... 1 am eastern time is when hell broke loose

[31-Oct-19 02:48 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031
this is probably providing great info to the team tho

[31-Oct-19 02:48 PM] Sergiobit82#6112
I m only complete one order The rest are lost... Contin√∫es testing

[31-Oct-19 02:49 PM] Jaki#9826
After xx traders there is still 7.777 RICK and 7.777 MORTY. Any comments why?

[31-Oct-19 02:49 PM] ca333#0118
yes it provided a LOT of essential data - we re really very grateful that you re helping us with this!

[31-Oct-19 02:49 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@Jaki I think you had 0 matches.

[31-Oct-19 02:49 PM] [deleted]#2162
@Jaki Because no trade was successfull maybe?

[31-Oct-19 02:51 PM] Booster99x#7054
@ca333 My pleasure too haha. If almost no one's getting 30 swaps done, will you lower the minimum threshold for the contest participation ?

[31-Oct-19 02:51 PM] jspook16#3059
Like a curve?

[31-Oct-19 02:51 PM] vanity33#9778
we can'r even make one

[31-Oct-19 02:51 PM] vanity33#9778
lol

[31-Oct-19 02:52 PM] ronyi#5719
I have 0,1morty and 0,1rick orders vica versa and no match.... how this is possible?

[31-Oct-19 02:53 PM] jspook16#3059
I really thought I'd have 30 trades in pretty quick based on previous trading times..

[31-Oct-19 02:53 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
because halloween

[31-Oct-19 02:53 PM] TonyL#3577
`I have 0,1morty and 0,1rick orders vica versa and no match.... how this is possible?` networking/routing problems because of loading on infra there are

[31-Oct-19 02:53 PM] Jaki#9826
@[deleted] @Sir Seven in order history there are transactions with option cancel. Is there any delay?

[31-Oct-19 02:53 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
So so sorry people ü§¶üèΩ Just noticed that some pubkey transaltion code I was using did not return the expected address. I've change code so it gets address directly without changing from pubkey.
Leaderboards have been updated with fix. Those who could not see their order count earlier please let me know if it is visible now

[31-Oct-19 02:54 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
hey guys your phone is ringing better go answer it lol

[31-Oct-19 02:55 PM] Mark81#4505
With stress test also your geological positioning matters. More closer you are servers that host matchmaking then better you are.

[31-Oct-19 02:55 PM] jspook16#3059
Servers?

[31-Oct-19 02:55 PM] jspook16#3059
Electrum servers?

[31-Oct-19 02:55 PM] BobZilla#8096
Just FYI,, cant get any orders through,, tried wifi,, and phone network

[31-Oct-19 02:56 PM] Mark81#4505
If i am correct serv3rs are hosted on germany that do order matching.

[31-Oct-19 02:57 PM] Mark81#4505
Seed nodes.

[31-Oct-19 02:57 PM] Mark81#4505

[31-Oct-19 02:59 PM] Jaki#9826
@Admin how we can see that the swap between RICK and MORTY is successful? Thx

[31-Oct-19 02:59 PM] Sir Seven#7158
