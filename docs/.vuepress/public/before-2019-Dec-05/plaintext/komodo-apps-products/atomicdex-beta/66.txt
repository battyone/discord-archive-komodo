@ITM Hi! This bug is fixed in 0.1.9

[17-Sep-19 11:47 PM] ITM#7678
@TonyL I tested 0.1.9

[17-Sep-19 11:49 PM] ITM#7678
Let me remove data and reinstall. Its deployed to Android Play store or only in code?

[17-Sep-19 11:50 PM] TonyL#3577
It's uploading as APK. Maybe some cache/data remained, hmm. Checking on my side now and will check on Galaxy S5 shortly

Btc and Kmd available for exchange in the DEX ...any list of coins coming in the future?

[18-Sep-19 12:22 AM] TonyL#3577
@BlockSurfer you can activate more coins if press `+` in the dashboard. There is quite huge list of UTXO coins, Komodo assetchains and ETH/ERC20. More assets will be added eventually

[18-Sep-19 12:23 AM] BlockSurfer#6412

[18-Sep-19 03:08 AM] Regnar#6164
feature suggestion for AtomicDEX: On the screen when you click on a coin in the portfolio view (screen where it brings up the coin balance, fiat value of the balance, receive and send buttons and transaction history) you should be able to tap the balance at the top and cycle the displayed fiat from `balance` to `per coin` values.

[18-Sep-19 03:28 AM] Regnar#6164
Considering many people track the per coin price, it would make sense to offer the ability to see the per coin price here as well instead of just the total balance.

[18-Sep-19 03:43 AM] vichiet#4058
No it's work. Don't need code pin

Good day

I have a question, in my portfolio it only says connecting, why so?

[18-Sep-19 06:17 AM] ITM#7678
I have a quick question.
I see the atomicdex swap happen directly from the wallet.
Let say I Sell LTC for KMD.
The swap is completed but both LTC and KMD transaction broadcasted is unconfirmed.
If a miner decides to create kmd transaction(to his own address), include it in the solved block(nicehash to quickly solve difficulty) but not submit it until the LTC transaction is broadcasted. As soon as that is done he broadcast the solved block. This will allow a double spend to take place?
Am I missing something? I thought is was linked to a cryptocondition or something?

[18-Sep-19 06:20 AM] ITM#7678
fine it was not a quick question

[18-Sep-19 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo ecosystem coins use dpowconfs, so they wait for notarizations. other coins can indeed be double spent if enough resources are used, but the economic cost to double spend a single swap makes it a non-economic attack. just dont swap 100 BTC without setting it to wait for enough BTC confirmations

[18-Sep-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why we say dont swap large amounts during the beta

[18-Sep-19 06:42 AM] ITM#7678
Let say 100KMD, The cost to double spend is less then ~1 KMD.(Since I am solving a block solo with the double spend transaction since the other transaction is not confirmed ). So the dpowconfs don't kick in until 1 confirmation. Now the volumes are low, but when the orderbook is huge, its can slice attack the orderbook in seconds.

[18-Sep-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
the swaps should not be treating the transaction as valid until the dpowconfs shows 2 confirmations

[18-Sep-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
which means it is notarized

[18-Sep-19 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
also there is no way you can mine an LTC block for 1 KMD, let alone double spend attack LTC

[18-Sep-19 06:49 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Also worth to add that only `spending` transactions are left unconfirmed, in more details:
1. Maker sends payment, taker waits for this payment to be confirmed so double spending is prevented here.
2. Taker then sends his payment, maker waits until this payment is confirmed before attempt to spend it.
3. Only then maker is spending taker's payment revealing the secret and taker spends maker's payment.
@ITM Only the `spending` stages are left unconfirmed in this case, the inputs being spent on this stage are hash-timelocked so other side won't be able to spend the transaction until timelock conditions are met (few hours).

[18-Sep-19 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
the one issue would be if one of the coins is a low hashrate coin without double spending protection

[18-Sep-19 06:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems for such coins, we need a way for the user to specify the required confirmations for that coin

[18-Sep-19 06:51 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Yes, the problem can occur if even after some number of confirmations the attacker can still double spend the output that was used for swap payment itself rolling back significant amount of blocks.

[18-Sep-19 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we need to allow the user to specify the required confirmations for each transaction. using default value so it doesnt have to be changed if it is acceptable. that would allow the user to specify larger confirmations for larger amounts. or we can automatically scale the required confirmations based on the amounts being swapped

[18-Sep-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
probably there can be some algorithm that balances a coins hashrate and economic value of the swap to generate the required confirmations

[18-Sep-19 06:53 AM] ITM#7678
@artem.pikulin What if I submit a solved block with double spend transaction before the hash-timelocked transaction is confirm or even properly broadcasted?

[18-Sep-19 06:55 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
The MM2 will then abort the swap since the transaction won't ever be confirmed.

[18-Sep-19 06:56 AM] ITM#7678
@artem.pikulin When I completed a swap, both KMD and Hush transaction stage on the explorer was unconfirmed. The swap was marked as completed

[18-Sep-19 06:56 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
These transactions were spends of swap payments that were confirmed before.

[18-Sep-19 07:01 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
The protocol is as follows:
1. Maker sends payment that protected with hash of secret. We must wait for it to be confirmed.
2. Taker then sends his payment using same hash of secret. We must wait for this to be confirmed.
3. Maker reveals secret to spent the Taker's payment - we don't have to wait for this to be confirmed. The taker won't be able to refund it for long time.
4. Taker uses the secret to spend the payment. Same here, to make a refund attempt Maker needs to wait for long time, but since it passes the transaction will be confirmed.

[18-Sep-19 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
if a chain is under a constant 51% attack for the entire duration of the timelocks and doing a censorship attack, then it is possible to mess things up. so we need to rely on the expense of such an attack being magnitudes more expensive than would be gained by the swaps

[18-Sep-19 07:04 AM] ITM#7678
@artem.pikulin Thanks :). Explained perfectly

[18-Sep-19 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
for BTC the cost of such an attack would be millions of dollars, but for some smaller chain, maybe it isnt such an expensive cost. it is of course safest to be swapping dPoW protected coins, which dont suffer from such attack vectors

[18-Sep-19 07:08 AM] ITM#7678
@jl777c So you say we bulletproof in terms of attacker not making a profit?

[18-Sep-19 07:09 AM] jl777c#5810
practically speaking, yes.

[18-Sep-19 07:09 AM] jl777c#5810
theoretically, if a user swaps 10BTC worth of some low hashrate coin, then maybe it is possible for an economic attack.

[18-Sep-19 07:09 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
```
maybe we need to allow the user to specify the required confirmations for each transaction. using default value so it doesnt have to be changed if it is acceptable. that would allow the user to specify larger confirmations for larger amounts. or we can automatically scale the required confirmations based on the amounts being swapped

```
@jl777c MM2 already has the API to set the required confirmations per coin during runtime (not persistent) - https://github.com/artemii235/developer-docs/blob/mm/docs/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.md#set_required_confirmations. But adding the USD-volume heuristics is also possible, maybe something simple at the start like `if volume > 1000 USD confirmations = confirmations + 1`.

ok, so the GUI can do a market price vs hashrate based calc for setting confirmations

[18-Sep-19 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess a more practical way is to have 2 confirmation values per coin that we know of and we can manually calculate the > $1000 numconfs, so for small amounts not at risk, it will still be fast, but for anything with significant economic value it uses the slower more secure numconfs. this logic should probably be done by the caller

with 2 confirmation, the notarized is completed and not possible to reverse. So it can be set. I think hush coin might not be setup correctly?

[18-Sep-19 07:25 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
I will recheck it, the `required_confirmations` is set in coins config, will validate that GUI uses proper amount.

[18-Sep-19 07:26 AM] ca333#0118
We are not using the increased `required_confirmation` (2) field yet @artem.pikulin - thus requiring only 1 conf.

[18-Sep-19 07:41 AM] ITM#7678
tested again. Doge and KMD, and Hush and Doge

[18-Sep-19 07:41 AM] ITM#7678
Both not confirmed

[18-Sep-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
the final spend wont be confirmed, it is the initial tx that needs to be confirmed

[18-Sep-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
for the beta test the required_confirmations are not being used yet

{Reactions}

[18-Sep-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but it should be waiting for the initial transactions to be confirmed

That will explain it, haha. I read ca333 message now

[18-Sep-19 07:46 AM] ITM#7678
both transaction broadcasted to the blockchain(hush and doge). The application show 2/3 Swap ongoing.
So now I could technical double spend the hush with a solve block that includes double spend transaction . And as for doge I can let it confirm.

[18-Sep-19 07:47 AM] ITM#7678
using the explorer to test if the transaction is broadcasted

[18-Sep-19 07:48 AM] ITM#7678
will have to try again when required_confirmations  is being used

[18-Sep-19 07:49 AM] ITM#7678
but I am happy with the explanation :). Thanks

I have the DEX running with the same seed on my Iphone and the Samsung, On Samsung the order is placed and is not visible on the Iphone in open orders, is there a way to change that?

[18-Sep-19 09:57 AM] ca333#0118
not yet @Aron“XuanLeeeeee“Goldberg - since its a pure DEX (100% decentralized and p2p) the swap data is only being stored locally (filestream layer) on the affected nodes/device and where you actually issued the swap. However - you will find the swap transactions in the transaction history of the affected coins detail view (which is blockchain data thus globally available).

[18-Sep-19 10:01 AM] Aron“XuanLeeeeee“Goldberg#3393
ok, that's what i was thinking. thx

Is there a chance any of the developer can provide some instructions/help on how to run mm2 build on mobile app programatically.
OR is there source code of atomixDex 0.1.8 beta app available on Github or somewhere?

[18-Sep-19 11:21 AM] wl#4107
It would be much more easy to place an order if we know the coins current price...

[18-Sep-19 11:26 AM] TonyL#3577
@CrisF Hi! Can see orders for BCH. Most probably there are no maker orders for ETH atm because of current crazy tx fees

[18-Sep-19 11:30 AM] TonyL#3577
@wl it's possible to check orderbook to compare with another current orders. If there is no orders at all - yeah, atm you'll need to check CMC and make some calculations to place an order with a good price. Agree that it's good feature to display current "market" ratio before maker order creation to help place a good order easily

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #93 Pin code and Biometric protection overlap on phones with on\-screen fingerscan
Reproducable on OnePlus 7 Pro, probably other smartphones with on-screen fingerscan.

1. Enable both protection options
2. Close app
3.  Open app
4. Both fingerprint and pin unlock options are presented
5. User can type pin and use application with fingerprint icon displayed

Expected:
 - pin and fingerprint should not be asked at the same time (and overlap in UI)
