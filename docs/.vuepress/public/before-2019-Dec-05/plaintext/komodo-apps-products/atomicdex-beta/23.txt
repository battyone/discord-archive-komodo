[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #25: tx history not displaying
Same issue, but for KMD and RICK tx history. Other coins are fine with me.
It does not load history. Once clicked one of these coins, every other coin does not load anymore.

Also orderbook does not load anymore after clicking one of these coins portfolio.
Looks like it's hanging in checking tx history.

App restart does fix it, until checking tx history of KMD or RICK again.

these orders are in maker-mode @FtrSaroth - do you still have one up?

i will buy 1 RICK from your for 1 RFOX

[18-Jul-19 05:59 PM] ca333#0118
thats when the network has no orders you can create an order - for the other pairs this was not possible but will change in the coming updates

[18-Jul-19 06:01 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
Yes, maker-mode  @ca333, i tried for example with ETH/RFOX, there is no orders so i tried to create one but not showed on my orders üëå

possible solution  for staying private with google
1. use https://www.torproject.org/download/ to access google.com
2. create a new account
3. if asked for phone verification use this service https://onlinesim.ru/en
4. use your new google account on a phone without inserted sim card (wlan, preferably not your own)
5. install https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android on your phone and make all apps use it

@ca333 I don't know Dart, so can you please update the existing language file with multiple objects which gives me the structure to add this extra language to the file? for now I just made the copy of the existing file and started the hindi translation.

[19-Jul-19 05:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Once there is an extra object to add more languages, I can probably make a readme file with instructions to help others to start contributing.

[19-Jul-19 05:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or may be if you can just start importing the other files in this language file, then that will also work. I think this will be better option than adding the extra objects to existing file.

[19-Jul-19 05:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you can fix code or this file being imported in existing used language file it'd be easier to start contributing.

[19-Jul-19 06:04 AM] Mylo#8306
nice start.  i made a spreadsheet to help with translation but clearly these extended character sets need to be done directly to src code instead of c+p

[19-Jul-19 06:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I just use the google input tools to type in English and that types that in Hindi for me. I just check the spellings are correct and the phrase I wrote makes sense to the context it is being used in the translated  file.

[19-Jul-19 06:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
just using the translate service will do the poor job. has to be typed at many times or at least fixed the errors in translated text.

[19-Jul-19 06:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the ideal way to let other users to add the translations would be just sharing the translated files like I did. If people knows github they can add those files there or they can maybe just share with the existing staff, and they can push those to GitHub.

[19-Jul-19 06:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but the exiting single file even for me is bit confusing. so I just tried to start with a copy of that file.

[19-Jul-19 06:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
which needs to be fixed to be importable to the project.

[19-Jul-19 06:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

I have a question to the lucky ones

[19-Jul-19 07:13 AM] luca_skywalker#0887
Is it possible to send eth to the atomicDEX or do I need to have some kmd?

[19-Jul-19 07:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You can send ETH, fees paid in the trading currency, you are not forced to pay in KMD

[19-Jul-19 07:14 AM] luca_skywalker#0887
Do i have a discount if i use kmd to pay fees?

[19-Jul-19 07:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes

[19-Jul-19 07:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But if you want ETH/BTC you cant pay in KMD to get it cheaper

[19-Jul-19 07:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Would need ETH/KMD

[19-Jul-19 07:16 AM] luca_skywalker#0887
ok cool

[19-Jul-19 07:18 AM] luca_skywalker#0887
Do we have any release date?

[19-Jul-19 07:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think there might be something later that could do something like BNB but for now ???/KMD will give you the discount

[19-Jul-19 07:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am not too sure when the official release would be. It is "live" now. Just be careful about it because i dont think you can set market orders yet. You just take what is available

[19-Jul-19 07:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So if someone lists something for 5% lower than market rate you would get 5% lower than a CEX

[19-Jul-19 07:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think everyone is waiting for the desktop wallets, then we will see a bit more liquidity come in.

I hope it will work as it should. I need a new dex

[19-Jul-19 08:44 AM] Slyris#2880
I have a user experience on the latest version of atomicDex that bothers me. I start creating an order, I start filling the order, I go back to my home screen on my phone, and then go back to the application. And here the order I had begun to fill is completely erased. it would be nice if the data of an order being created is persistent

All simply when we put the application in background, we lose the data we were entering.

May be this is already reported

@hastrup AtomicDEX doesn't substract fees automatically. So you need to trade a lower amount to pay the fees with the remainings.

[19-Jul-19 08:49 AM] ferjr90#9314
@Slyris Try to disable energy saving for AtomicDEX in your Android configuration.

[19-Jul-19 08:51 AM] Slyris#2880
You mean to remove the restriction activity in the background ?

[19-Jul-19 08:51 AM] Oszy#5734
No it's true, on losing focus it does not keep already entered information, power saving has nothing to do with that

[19-Jul-19 08:52 AM] Slyris#2880
It may be a fast fix, but it's not user friendly. I think the customer expects behavior persist by default

[19-Jul-19 08:53 AM] Slyris#2880
Also asking for the fingerprint every time we come back from the background, I think it's a little intrusive. But it's only my opinion.

[19-Jul-19 08:53 AM] Slyris#2880
I mean i put the application in background 20 seconds to answer a message for example

[19-Jul-19 08:53 AM] Oszy#5734

I think it's a fundamental feature, very important. To be able to explain to our different tax entity the transactions that we could do with our cryptocurrencies and traceability. I think that would allow faster adoption.

We can inspire ourselves for this in the same way as coinbase with their statement downloadable at any time by their customers. The banks systematically ask us for traces of our actions.

- The startup logo is just a small square, would be nicer if it fits the whole screen

-app immediately crashes when opening down to up screen on iphone (for instance to change from 4G to internet, or even to get more brightness on the screen)
