I think I saw someone reporting that large numbers were giving issues

[06-Nov-19 09:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But was last week i think, cant remember who reported it, but wzs also for commod

[06-Nov-19 09:56 PM] Oszy#5734
for withdraw yes

[06-Nov-19 09:56 PM] Oszy#5734
max 4 digit

[06-Nov-19 09:59 PM] Oszy#5734
i found a similar bug that had something to do with deleting the decimals, then posting to the orderbook gave stupid numbers,  now this is without decimals, just plain big numbers, there must be an error somewhere

[06-Nov-19 10:02 PM] Oszy#5734
it's not a big deal on a KMD pair but on BTC it's significant difference in price

[06-Nov-19 10:19 PM] ca333#0118
thanks for the report @Oszy - we ll try to reproduce and investigate this.

Maybe a improvment suggestion.
I think it would be more interesting to see on a trade, what currently happens.
For which blockchain we are right now waiting for a confirmation.
Right now the 3 steps don't give much information.

How long atomicdex waits to trying get swaps done? Ie. if in another chain has long time between blocks then how long dex waits to  get tx through?

[07-Nov-19 10:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I would assume the app watches mempools of each chain, as long as the tx is still in the mempool it wont abort mission?

[07-Nov-19 11:15 AM] Oszy#5734
@Mark81 roughly 45 mins for maker payment to clean,  and about 2 hours to complete, according to my logs of a swap that did timeout

[07-Nov-19 11:17 AM] Oszy#5734
not sure actual times are specific to swap or a blockchain or just fixed, devs could confirm

[07-Nov-19 12:08 PM] colonelhoot#6448
I want to try this out but one thing I dont understand is who hosts the blockchains if not me?  Are there other nodes that do this?  Do you guys use Electrum or something like that? Or am I just confused here?

[07-Nov-19 12:16 PM] Oszy#5734
atomicDEX mobile uses SPV electrum servers to load blockchain data.

[07-Nov-19 12:17 PM] Oszy#5734
on PC, you can run marketmaker with native wallets, on mobile that would be a bit complicated and would eat more resources than a phone can handle.

[07-Nov-19 12:21 PM] Lennart#9331
can an open order somehow made into an hyperlink, so I can share my order in social media? If someone clicks on it, AtomicDex opens with all the fields prefilled, could it be done?

[07-Nov-19 12:22 PM] Lennart#9331
also, when you create an order, after submitting the order there could be the typical "share on social media" buttons

[07-Nov-19 12:23 PM] Lennart#9331
maybe that's all not needed with a lot of liquidity on the Dex. But for mor exclusive traiding pairs it could still be useful

[07-Nov-19 12:25 PM] Markus#5464
@Lennart Good idea, i quess there could be a button in the order tab to share trade but i think this would require quite some changes for this to work

[07-Nov-19 12:25 PM] colonelhoot#6448
Ah thanks.

[07-Nov-19 01:21 PM] LeshAft9#0083
What executes the final part of the atomic swap? say I offer KMD for BTC and later somebody fills the offer, so they claim the KMD. What process/machine then broadcasts the transaction to Bitcoin network to spend the BTC to my address and complete the swap?

[07-Nov-19 01:23 PM] gcharang#6833
@LeshAft9
the simple answer is: your atomicDEX app which has marketmaker2 inside it

[07-Nov-19 01:24 PM] gcharang#6833
this is the whole process. It is automated and all the steps are done by the mm2 of each of the participants
```
----------
A has BTC, B has KMD. They agreed on swap price `1 BTC = 100 KMD`
A is the maker, B is the taker.

1) Taker Sends <dexfee>

B pays the dex fee so that A will start the process by locking his coins.

2) Maker Successfully Sends <makerpayment>

A picks randomNumber: `secret_A`

A creates a utxo on the Bitcoin blockchain with 
value: 1 BTC 
encumbrance: the value can be claimed by A after 20 hours or by B if he knows the secret `secret_A`

3)  Taker Successfully Sends <takerpayment>

After seeing the above utxo, B creates the following utxo on the KMD blockchain:
value: 100 KMD
encumbrance: the value can be claimed by B after 10 hours or by A if he knows the secret `secret_A`

4) Maker Spends <takerpayment>

 A uses the `secret_A`  and claims the KMD revealing the secret 

5) Taker Spends <makerpayment>

B now uses the public `secret_A` to claim the BTC

---
The times can be adjusted based on requirements of security and "ease of use"
Normally, A should have a longer locktime so that B can have sufficient time to get his coins back if A doesn't reveal the secret `secret_A`
```

[07-Nov-19 01:26 PM] LeshAft9#0083
so if I place an order then turn off my phone I might not complete my swap and the counter-party could eventually spend those too?

[07-Nov-19 01:28 PM] LeshAft9#0083
OK thanks I think I understand, it's the mm2 app that does the lifting there

[07-Nov-19 01:28 PM] gcharang#6833
just placing an order doesn't make you lose coins
but, if you are the taker and don't claim your coins in the given time, you could lose them

[07-Nov-19 01:29 PM] LeshAft9#0083
Would you have a brief summary of how/where orders are stored / matched?

[07-Nov-19 01:31 PM] gcharang#6833
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/atomicdex.html#the-decentralized-orderbook>
orders are broadcast by each mm2 instance to the p2p network and relay nodes broadcast them to all the other mm2 instances that want to listen
each mm2 instance will create a local orderbook based on the orders they hear on the p2p network

[07-Nov-19 01:32 PM] gcharang#6833
similar to how txns are broadcast to the mempool

[07-Nov-19 01:38 PM] LeshAft9#0083
OK, that all makes sense.  So in terms of the Komodo platform, if you do an atomic swap between BTC and LTC then Komodo network (blockchain) is not involved

[07-Nov-19 01:39 PM] LeshAft9#0083
Interesting to contrast with the design of the Decred DEX. I think all atomic swaps there are with DCR base pair

[07-Nov-19 01:40 PM] LeshAft9#0083
Who provides all of the remote nodes for the supported blockchains on atomic?

[07-Nov-19 01:42 PM] LeshAft9#0083
Does support for swaps have to be implemented pairwise or is one implementation per chain enough? e.g. to add ZEN to the dex would somebody have to implement ZEN/KMD swap, ZEN/BTC swap, etc. or just a one-time implementation and then it can be swapped against all existing assets?

[07-Nov-19 01:42 PM] gcharang#6833
```

true
```

```
these are called electrum servers
some we maintain. some are run by the respective coin communities
most lite mode wallets for most cryptos use these electrum servers

Hi, when I try to send KMD from my AtomicDex wallet, it says "not a valid address", but it is a valid address.

[07-Nov-19 07:09 PM] Arno#3334
Can anyone help?

[07-Nov-19 07:13 PM] Arno#3334
Update: That error occurred after scanning the address from the QR code. After entering it manually, it worked. So why is the QR code scan feature not working?

[07-Nov-19 07:38 PM] Oszy#5734
Where did you scan the QR from? sometimes they include extra stuff at the beginning before the address.

[07-Nov-19 08:26 PM] Arno#3334
Directly from the wallet that provided both the QR code and the text string. I wanted to compare the scanned string with the provided string, but the text field in AtomicDex didn't show the full address, and there does not seem to be a way to put the cursor back to the beginning, is there?

Is atomic swap over lightning feasible?

[08-Nov-19 09:54 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not really ,  figure you have to deposit and withdraw which require confirmations so not any faster

[08-Nov-19 10:22 AM] Mark81#4505
Can someone see why this Morty transaction is still on unconfirmed on stomicdex? It was coming in on last stress test. it might be bug on Atomicdex.  a64cf8df0192742ebe5e3ab412b8028c4c61aba39a5126a76d81af559bb7bc92

[08-Nov-19 10:25 AM] Mark81#4505
Also this transaction from Commod is in unconfirmed status even that chain is now moving. There were stall last night on chain and atomicdex is not cleared it. 877bed86408293d493fe7bbf00df7a7407f3883b40000a1abcadbe89eaedbb2b

[08-Nov-19 10:28 AM] Mark81#4505
It might be that there has been fork on those chains and atomicdex doesn't remove those unconfirmed transactions off.

As I remember there were some deadly stuck transactions from faucet (it's not AtomicDEX but faucet related)

[08-Nov-19 10:41 AM] TonyL#3577
For commod can't see transaction with such txid on blockchain

[08-Nov-19 10:42 AM] TonyL#3577
You can try to re-issue it, probably it's related to chain stall

[08-Nov-19 10:44 AM] Mark81#4505
I cant find it neither from Morty.

[08-Nov-19 10:45 AM] TonyL#3577
If you can see it with 0 confirmations it should be in SPV server mempool

[08-Nov-19 10:45 AM] Mark81#4505
Tx for commod was coming for me from pool so its lost forever.

[08-Nov-19 10:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Is your commod pool balance 0?

[08-Nov-19 10:46 AM] Mark81#4505
Yes it is.

[08-Nov-19 10:46 AM] TonyL#3577
You should contact pool operator - if transaction was not performed but your pool account balance was reduced he/she should restore it

[08-Nov-19 10:46 AM] Mark81#4505
So its wider problem.

[08-Nov-19 10:47 AM] TonyL#3577
It's not related anyhow to AtomicDEX since tx not reached destination (it's not on blockchain as you can see)

[08-Nov-19 10:49 AM] Mark81#4505
Well it is in that sence that atomicdex dont remove those off? Atleast if  they stick there till world ends.

[08-Nov-19 10:50 AM] TonyL#3577
AtomicDEX can't remove transaction from blockchain nodes mempool or from blockchain

[08-Nov-19 10:50 AM] Mark81#4505
And there is bug also in snop pool code.

[08-Nov-19 10:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Most probably tx hanged in a mempool, rebroadcast from pool side might help

[08-Nov-19 10:54 AM] Mark81#4505
@runpaint

[08-Nov-19 10:56 AM] Mark81#4505

@TonyL  now I get not a valid address when I attempts to withdraw usdc

[08-Nov-19 11:28 AM] TonyL#3577
AtomicDEX uses ETH checksum verification: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55. Thus, address input is case-sensitive. You should use mixed case as recepient (https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a0b54d5dc17e0aadc383d2db43b0a0d3e029c4c for example for this address mixed case one is 0x5A0b54D5dc17e0AadC383d2db43B0a0D3E029c4c)
