jfyi - we 've tested 0.1.7 on a real device cloud infrastructure to ensure all is good. (S10 and S10+ included)

[06-Sep-19 08:25 AM] phideas#8309
Very Cool! S10 is a little disappointing after I switched from one plus. They went with snapdragon in US and exynos chipset in EU.

[06-Sep-19 08:29 AM] phideas#8309
Assuming I am one of many ppl here with S10 who was sold on Samsung‚Äôs native crypto wallet we are still waiting for.

Hi @TonyL ,
Just submitted  a "Failed/Stuck Swap" report involving a red screen in 1.7 . Might be a self-inflicted injury.

Hi @dudezmobi Thank you for issue opening. 

Could you please elaborate a little bit: after what actions coins disappears (what are the steps to reproduce the issue)?
Also what do you mean by `ALL platforms`?

Thank you in advance!

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #85: History display wrong
As I can see from logs on the seed node this swap was actually failed with ` "type": "MakerPaymentSpendFailed"` error. (https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/Bjvf7jbZJ4/)

Have you actually received the komodo on some point? that's some kind of AtomicDEX-API bug if yes.

Anyway this issue not AtomicDEX GUI related. If you'll face such problem again please reopen this issue and I'll move it to AtomicDEX-API repo.

@ca333 google is rough with banning apps. ive been through the whole rigamole of copyright infringing on google play, as many others. I would take out the pictures of rick and morty on the listing. if you search for rick and morty in the store they are definitely DMCAing apps using their IPs due to the lack of older rick and morty apps. at the very least i would make sure to not mention in the description where to get rick and morty coins for example.

[06-Sep-19 02:37 PM] ca333#0118
Thanks @dan. - will remove these just to make sure to not run into issues. jfyi - We were told that since we do not sell anything with Rick and Morty (not assigning value to these tokens) nor profit from it in any way (app is free) it wouldn't be a problem due to the fact that fan-projects are allowed. (Apple for instance has also reviewed this application).

[06-Sep-19 02:39 PM] ca333#0118
We do not collect any KYC data - if courts contact us we would have to inform them about the technical architecture of a DEX system. The above paragraph is just a legal requirement in the application itself @Acura - dont worry, DEX doesn't have KYC.

swap speed depends a lot on how fast block times are. KMD to smartchains with 1 min blocktimes will be much quicker than swaping for something with a 10 min blocktime. If blocks are slower than normal, it takes longer still.

[06-Sep-19 05:28 PM] Novo#3073
I just figured it out.

[06-Sep-19 05:29 PM] Novo#3073
This happens when you have PIN disabled.  If you have it disabled and you come back to the app it hangs.

[06-Sep-19 05:34 PM] Novo#3073
Additionally, 'Biometric protection' on it's own does not work.  The user needs to have the PIN toggle activated as well in order for the biometric protection to work.   Yet it is possible to toggle 'biometric' on it's own.  That should also be fixed.

[06-Sep-19 05:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Thank you for report! Yes, this clue with biometric protection is know one and will be improved in the next patch

[06-Sep-19 05:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Will try to reproduce issue with disabled pin + hang on my side

[06-Sep-19 05:37 PM] Novo#3073
Additionally.  When the user selects 'Change Pin', the label should state 'Enter your old PIN code'  and the next screen should state'Enter your new PIN Code'.  Make sure the 'old' and 'new' adjectives are bolded for emphasis.
