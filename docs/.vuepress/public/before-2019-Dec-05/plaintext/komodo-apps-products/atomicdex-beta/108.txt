@TonyL  Each successful swap = 1 ticket, then by rng script will be determined winning tickets for each of the prizes 🤔🤔🤔

[02-Nov-19 11:21 AM] Checking#6355
I hope you will be responsible with your words

I'm never lucky with such things.

[02-Nov-19 11:44 AM] Checking#6355
Is not how lucky u are

[02-Nov-19 11:44 AM] Jimm B.#9993
It is....

[02-Nov-19 11:45 AM] Checking#6355
but how transparent is the draw

[02-Nov-19 11:49 AM] Markus#5464
@Checking I dont think they benefit anything from cheating a lottery draw so why even bother making a big deal out of it, come on

[02-Nov-19 11:51 AM] Checking#6355
Yeah okay, fair enought

[02-Nov-19 11:51 AM] Checking#6355

[02-Nov-19 11:55 AM] ca333#0118

[02-Nov-19 12:02 PM] Artist#0765
Thnks but you have put in more effort

[02-Nov-19 12:02 PM] Artist#0765
Obviously

[02-Nov-19 12:03 PM] coingirl87#6489
We all have won....with metadata team will build a better dex so in long  we all will benefit from it....i also try 4 hours to swap during stress test and only had 1 successful swap....it was not prio to win a price...for me it was more important to help team!! so i dont understand complaining people....

[02-Nov-19 12:07 PM] Checking#6355
@Artist hard to say, but that's the fact I was very unlucky 

@Markus Markus is right

[02-Nov-19 12:08 PM] Jimm B.#9993
@coingirl87 The draw could have been more transparent.  even if I trust the team 100% ... others do not. There is such a saying ... do not trust, verify.  but I think the team will do better next time.  then hopefully nobody will have a reason to complain.

[02-Nov-19 12:09 PM] Checking#6355
there is no benefit to team cheating the lottery

[02-Nov-19 12:09 PM] coingirl87#6489
Yes...so why you complaining?

[02-Nov-19 12:09 PM] Jimm B.#9993
where do I complain?

[02-Nov-19 12:09 PM] Jimm B.#9993

[02-Nov-19 12:09 PM] Checking#6355
Me lol

[02-Nov-19 12:09 PM] coingirl87#6489
I mean checking

[02-Nov-19 12:11 PM] Checking#6355
Because an incorrect information that i've seen on telegram channel

[02-Nov-19 12:12 PM] coingirl87#6489
Ok...the incorrect information was that you will win?

[02-Nov-19 12:14 PM] Checking#6355
I dont want to argue with you, go to telegram and read all the whole messages 🧐🤗

[02-Nov-19 12:15 PM] coingirl87#6489
Talk to me...what was the incorrect message? I dont have telegram

[02-Nov-19 12:16 PM] Jimm B.#9993
@coingirl87 The matter has been done.  Why do you want to start again?

[02-Nov-19 12:16 PM] coingirl87#6489
Only want to understand it

[02-Nov-19 12:17 PM] coingirl87#6489
Maybe i am stupid

@coingirl87 I think he put a lot of work in there and was disappointed that he was not lucky.  and as the rules for the raffle have changed, some confusion has arisen.

[02-Nov-19 12:21 PM] coingirl87#6489
I also put a lot of work into it but who cares?

[02-Nov-19 12:21 PM] peratt#6611
@Jimm B. no bro ..the problem is proff draw make a public ..

[02-Nov-19 12:23 PM] Jimm B.#9993
Next time, the team will make it more transparent.

I can’t wait to see how the test results will lead to a better dex experience

[02-Nov-19 12:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hopefully some updates soon 🥰

[02-Nov-19 02:01 PM] willofleo#7505
it sometimes hard to calculate prices on the dex will it be possible to attach usd (or any chosen value ) value to all the prices

[02-Nov-19 02:42 PM] duskonaut#1244
I am dissapointed

[02-Nov-19 02:42 PM] duskonaut#1244
this is not dex

[02-Nov-19 02:42 PM] duskonaut#1244
if few people can send transactions

[02-Nov-19 02:42 PM] duskonaut#1244
I don't care about 77777777777777 kmd

[02-Nov-19 02:43 PM] yeamanjam#2841
Congrats @ѕℓιм How did you do it?  How many swaps did you have?

[02-Nov-19 02:43 PM] ѕℓιм#1031
@duskonaut it was a stress test dude

[02-Nov-19 02:43 PM] duskonaut#1244
I guess some nodes are better than others

[02-Nov-19 02:43 PM] duskonaut#1244
@ѕℓιм  no need to be a parrot and repeat

[02-Nov-19 02:43 PM] duskonaut#1244

@ Slim Did your swap happen at the begin or the end of the test?

[02-Nov-19 02:45 PM] ѕℓιм#1031
it was after 3 hours of trying

[02-Nov-19 02:46 PM] yeamanjam#2841
Yeah i tried the whole 10 minutes every hour putting in orders but none went thru, except the 6 before the swap officially started 🙂

[02-Nov-19 02:47 PM] yeamanjam#2841
I had 2 clear today too

[02-Nov-19 02:48 PM] ѕℓιм#1031
yea it works fine when its not under intense stress being run on minimum hardware infrastructure

[02-Nov-19 02:59 PM] AkiraX#8269
I wanted 777 kmd

[02-Nov-19 02:59 PM] AkiraX#8269
I didn't get i2

@duskonaut far from a failure, team learned quite a bit. Test was *meant* to break it

{Reactions}
👍 

[02-Nov-19 03:19 PM] duskonaut#1244
If over 1700 people could not send even single transaction.
If you changed the rules in last minute
then it is failed

[02-Nov-19 03:19 PM] duskonaut#1244
you can collect data from failed tests also

[02-Nov-19 03:20 PM] duskonaut#1244
I would just like some honesty

[02-Nov-19 03:20 PM] Alright#0419
Call it what you like, but it served the exact purpose it was meant to serve

{Reactions}
🤷 👍 

[02-Nov-19 03:21 PM] duskonaut#1244
oh so you knew this would happen?

[02-Nov-19 03:22 PM] Alright#0419
Don't understand what you're on about. We tried to break it; we broke it. We got enough data from the test to optimize it.

[02-Nov-19 03:23 PM] Alright#0419
"it is not a dex" is unequivocally untrue

[02-Nov-19 03:23 PM] duskonaut#1244
I think this whole 30 transaction was not realistic in first place

[02-Nov-19 03:23 PM] duskonaut#1244
if some node can send 15 transaction

[02-Nov-19 03:24 PM] duskonaut#1244
and 1700 can't send a single one... I think something is wrong

[02-Nov-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
wait for next test

[02-Nov-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
2000 simultaneous orders for a single orderbook, this could not be handled with last iteration. we will fix it
