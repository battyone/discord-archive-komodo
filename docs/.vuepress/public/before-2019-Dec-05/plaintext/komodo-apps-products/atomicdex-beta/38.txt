I agree. pirate on atomic dex would be epic.

[27-Jul-19 08:39 PM] actionslacks#4072

it is a signifigant engineering challenge but these devs will be the first to pull it off if anyone can.

Fast trades

[27-Jul-19 09:27 PM] allbits#5898
Speed is limited by confirmation times on the blockchain. These are decentralized atomic swaps, not changes in bookkeeping entries by a centralized exchange.

[27-Jul-19 09:29 PM] allbits#5898
By the way, how does the speed compare to changelly or shapeshift. It's way faster, right?

@mazyar_lp for sure, it's much longer compare to a CEX but it's more cheaper and secure.. From my side, I consider that after step 1 "order matched", the trade is done. Step 2 is just the execution of the swap.

[28-Jul-19 06:10 AM] TonyL#3577
@designer could you please user "Settings -> Send report" option and DM me the log?

[28-Jul-19 06:11 AM] TonyL#3577
@t0sma Actually all steps are important to perform succesful swap. On steps 2 and 3 transactions broadcasting so there is much more failure possibility than on step 1

@kartha87 can you try to use mixed case address?
e.g. for https://etherscan.io/address/0xa568641f3032c3d2fd83d69215c9ad5971a4cd55 it'll be 0xA568641f3032c3D2Fd83d69215C9AD5971a4Cd55

@kartha87 atomicDEX mobile uses checksum verification for the ETH address validation. So it is case-sensitive.

@ca333  SO are we supposed to enter eth address in a case sensitive manner or will there be an update where the address can be non case sensitive?  Just want to know what is the best practise here?

[28-Jul-19 09:16 AM] ca333#0118
@kartha87 we actually updated it the other way around. So first we did allow just raw hex (which represents a ETH address) without further validation but noticed that this could cause issues (users sending to a wrong address) - that is why we implemented https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55 - to prevent this risk.

Hello there! Thank you for AtomicDEX and all the work you have done so far in Komodo!
I have done swapping some Ricks and Mortys and wanted to try the real deal - sent LTC from Coinbase to AtomicDEX, which went instantly. Here are some observations:
* after the screen locks while being in DEX tab, all the information (coin, amount) resets to blank - I believe it should keep that information after unlocking screen
* the same happens, if I put information in DEX and then switch to Orders or History sub-tab - after coming back to Trade sub-tab, all the fields are blank again
* I like that fiat equivalent is shown, but I would also like to swap coins based on exchange rate (at least informational calculated values shown), not based only on amount
* is it true - if someone has made a market order, I have only two options - either accept the exchange rate or deny it? Is there no option to make market order myself if someone has already done that? 
* What happens with partial orders - for example I want to swap 0.1 BTC to 800 KMD but in the market there is only 400 KMD available for swap?

@Dzy the mobile app only does market buy/sells. You would need a desktop app to set limit orders.

[28-Jul-19 11:08 AM] Dzy#5475
OK, got it!

[28-Jul-19 11:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If you want to try it out, the hyperDEX nightly builds have that functionality right now but is early days and there are some bugs.

[28-Jul-19 11:10 AM] Dzy#5475
What about partial order matching? Will it execute partially and the remaining half will stay in the market as my market order for the rest to fill and offer liquidity?

[28-Jul-19 11:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Will leave that to atomicDEX support, dont know enough about it to answer with any certainty.

[28-Jul-19 11:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Dzy marketmaking is not currently availble through the mobile. There's some notes on doing it via command line (if that's something you're interested in) - https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-tutorials/how-to-become-a-liquidity-provider.html

I believe @hyperDEX  and the desktop app will also offer this functionality via GUI in due time.

[28-Jul-19 12:07 PM] eduard#6056
hello, I have a suggestion for MobileDex, if it is possible.  And if it is possible to install a button to abort the swap as long as it is not completed, as in a normal exchange the trade cancel.

[28-Jul-19 12:24 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@mo7881 failed timeout transactions should return after a time, but there is a chance they get stuck. Make sure to NOT clear cache, so we have the data to perform a manual return if required. To do so, DM your logs to a team member (green name - Angelina, Gcharang, TonyL) for review.
@eduard cancelling a trade is possible, but no button exists yet. Depending on what stage of the trade it has progressed to, this may forfeit the dexfee, and require waiting for the trade to timeout. Personally, I'd avoid cancelling a swap once it has begun.

[28-Jul-19 12:33 PM] mo7881#6408
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator I have a few that failed unreturned. Its all small amounts so im not bothered about getting it back but it could help your development.

There is example of seed in this field (it with spaces), also you can press on eye to type and see the  seed. Grammar checkers and manipulations with seed input is unsafe practice as far as I know + wif/some custom seed input is possible and separation here will unnecessary complicate things imo

```
Grammar checkers
```
I am not suggesting a Grammar checker. Just validate the word's existence in the bip39 list

I understand there is an example shown. But checking visually if there is 1 space or two between two words is difficult in a mobile phone.

That is why I proposed a solution where spacebar is not needed.

Also, I haven't suggested manipulating the seed

How long does it usually take to add new assets to trade? For insatance Neo or Tezos etc. Is there a priority list for coins to be added as well?

@ohweoh AtomicDEX is a GUI
its backend: Marketmaker(mm2) needs to work with any new coin to be added
all the coins tested to work with mm2 have the key-value `mm2: 1` in the file https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins

 currently BTC forks and ERC20 can be easily added
Tezos and Neo could be added in the future but no ETA

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #52 Error when trying to send Litecoin
When you try to send LTC to a normal M... address, an unspecific red error message is displayed with "try again later". But trying later always leads to the same result.

Will there be a "google play"-free release? APK file or f-droid repo, for example
