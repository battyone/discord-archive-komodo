oh yeah, and a quick btw... excessive spamming via CLI bots is discouraged (and your fail rate will be visible for all to see üòÑ )

what is the minimum swap btw?

hmmm, excessive spamming using CLI-bots sounds like proper stress-testing to me. Maybe for a future test...

[30-Oct-19 07:39 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you can do it if you want, but if it kills your stats it'll be visible. find the fastest swap rate with a good success rate would be commendable. Setting a bot to try and swap every 0.01  seconds is "excessive", just be reasonable. This is trying to test mobile swaps too, and spambots are obviously potentially a bit more viscious.

I'll chip into a prize for an address that has the highest number of swaps and highest success rate that DIDN'T win a prize otherwise. @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

I'd like to give a try on atomicdex-API (the CLI atomicdex without GUI), sorry if it is not the right channel to ask. Do you know if the CLI calls are defined and documented somewhere ? Will they stay as they are or is it planned to change all CLI stuff later ?

[30-Oct-19 08:34 PM] kmd.dex#8716
why u dont send  it via my address ?

Thank you @Regnar  and do you know if the API calls are stable ? I mean that I don't want to be force to do many changes because of changing API calls

[30-Oct-19 08:35 PM] Regnar#6164

I assume they are, but I haven't done any first hand tbh

[30-Oct-19 08:36 PM] Regnar#6164
smk has a site running some of their calls and it seems stable when I use that

[30-Oct-19 08:36 PM] Regnar#6164
if it's anything like the Komodod RPC it's stable too

Hey. Are there Russian speakers here?

[30-Oct-19 09:40 PM] TS#6934
I was told to update the wallet to version 0 2 5. deleted, installed a new one, entered the saved SEED. It took 2 times to enter the password and 2 times to enter the PIN code. There are no test coins and transaction history inside. black screen. I don‚Äôt remember the name of the old wallet. It was required to give a name.

[30-Oct-19 09:44 PM] Oszy#5734
Name of the old wallet doesn't matter, only your `seed` is important. 
with reinstalling the app tx history will be always wiped. 
if you can't see your coins, double check the `seed` for typos, added extra spaces, and see if the R address is the same as before.

[30-Oct-19 09:46 PM] Oszy#5734
if the screen is still black after uninstalling from the phone, and reinstalling the app from the app store, please let us know, so we can investigate further.

[30-Oct-19 09:46 PM] Oszy#5734
android or ios by the way?

[30-Oct-19 09:47 PM] Oszy#5734
@TonyL you might be able to help him in russian?

[30-Oct-19 09:51 PM] TS#6934
android screen is black. There are no test coins on the balance. The SEED has been recorded and verified several times. I turned on the function of visual verification of the phrase at the input, that's right. Also opened the phrase in the wallet, there is no error. I was asked to enter the password twice after entering the phrase, should it be?

[30-Oct-19 09:52 PM] Oszy#5734
yes. twice to confirm they are the same.

[30-Oct-19 09:53 PM] Oszy#5734
cross question, if the screen is black, how can you tell there are no test coins in your wallet

[30-Oct-19 09:58 PM] TS#6934
I also had two unconfirmed orders, they are not there either. only btc and kmd with zero balance

[30-Oct-19 09:59 PM] Oszy#5734
if you reinstall those will be wiped as they are stored locally.

[30-Oct-19 09:59 PM] Oszy#5734
activate the other coins with the + sign

[30-Oct-19 10:01 PM] TS#6934
and get through the tap again? I activated, balance zero

[30-Oct-19 10:03 PM] Oszy#5734
I don't really understand. Is some coin balance missing?  which coin? how much is missing? what was the balance before you reinstalled?

[30-Oct-19 10:05 PM] TS#6934
I made several transactions between test coins. I had about 6.7, equal in quantity. Does the screen remain black? I also want to pay attention, when creating an order, the button for setting the number of coins is very small, you can‚Äôt see the numbers.

Good pitch for listing at DeFiprime:

```‚ÄúWe launched on mainnet three months ago, after two respectable auditors independently audited our smart contracts. Since our launch, we achieved this and that milestones, and XXXX users using our app regularly. We also integrated with a few well known DeFi protocols.‚Äù```

Looks like somebody draining faucet right now (https://morty.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RCFaQdcJUTAegNGprZmTqJWP9jCgWiyfju). 
Please note that such behaviour considering as abusing and this address is disqualified from stress test raffle

as well as any addresses associated with this one

[31-Oct-19 04:18 AM] TonyL#3577

```Getting same response on Morty
Can't broadcast transaction``` faucet is under drainer/abuser "attack" at the moment. Should be fine as soon as @pbca26 set limits back (we thought to remove the claiming limits for RICK/MORTY for 24 hours to help participants but somebody abusing it)
