DEX is on chainswap if you want to trade there

[06-Aug-19 03:47 PM] Acura#2748
ok

[06-Aug-19 05:21 PM] fat3lvis#6079
Still having trouble with BTC “locked in swaps” even though the swaps timed out and are in my history as such

[06-Aug-19 07:20 PM] TonyL#3577
@fat3lvis Could you please use "Settings -> Send feedback" feature and send app log? Maybe backend trying to continue these timeouted swaps thats why BTC counting as locked. 
Also what platform (Android or iOS) and app version are you using?

[06-Aug-19 08:44 PM] 花果山#5224
This order is RFOX0.4 exchanged for 0.009KMD, but when it comes to viewing the commission, it becomes 0.1KMD to 0.4RFOX.

@TonyL   I exchanged it twice with DOGE, and there were 2 transfers at the same time.
For the first time, convert to KMD with 8035DOGE. An additional transfer record for DOGE 14.3 appears.
The second time this morning, the 585 was exchanged for KMD, and another DOGE5.67 additional transfer record was issued.

[06-Aug-19 09:05 PM] 花果山#5224
If the fee is not included in the 1 transfer?

@花果山 I'll check the log files and get back to you on this

[06-Aug-19 09:29 PM] Oszy#5734
New version first swap failed, went to 2/3  then failed, now showing 0/3

@Angelina    drathe956862@gmail.com    When can I download it? It has been 36 hours.

[06-Aug-19 09:37 PM] Angelina#6231
@花果山 how was this address submitted?

[06-Aug-19 09:38 PM] 花果山#5224
It has been submitted for a few days.

[06-Aug-19 09:42 PM] 花果山#5224
@Angelina  I checked the atomic interchange record and saw that the wallet was split into 2 times, 1 time is a normal swap +1 charge, which is too outrageous. If you use BTC swap, you need to pay 2 miners. Fees, increase costs.

[06-Aug-19 09:43 PM] 花果山#5224
Swaps and fees should be placed in the same transfer.

[06-Aug-19 09:50 PM] 花果山#5224
The 1 BTC miner fee is 0.0005*2, which is no advantage.

[06-Aug-19 10:29 PM] 花果山#5224
The DOGE miner fee is 2, and the miner fee is 5 in exchange. Who controls this? I think we should let everyone know the standard of miners' fees in various currencies.

[06-Aug-19 11:36 PM] 花果山#5224
An atomic exchange, today found that it is necessary to pay 2 coins + 2 miners.

[06-Aug-19 11:44 PM] TonyL#3577
@花果山 There is 0.13% taker fee which paying as separate transaction

[06-Aug-19 11:46 PM] 花果山#5224
@TonyL  Then people who exchange with BTC will lose more.

[06-Aug-19 11:46 PM] TonyL#3577
And DOGE has 5 coins as txfee as I remember. Taker sending 2 transactions 1 with fees and second with maker payment so -10 DOGE in fees in total

[06-Aug-19 11:47 PM] TonyL#3577
@花果山 Yes, at the moment it have sense to make trades for big BTC amounts only

[06-Aug-19 11:47 PM] TonyL#3577
because of huge txfees

[06-Aug-19 11:47 PM] 花果山#5224
Then DOGE's miner fee is 2, why is it 5?

[06-Aug-19 11:49 PM] TonyL#3577
As I remember this txfee amount was set because of problems with transactions propagation into DOGE mempool (miners not accepted txs with less fees)
@cipi can correct me if I'm wrong

[06-Aug-19 11:50 PM] 花果山#5224
I think these basic details, miners should be announced on the official website.

[06-Aug-19 11:53 PM] TonyL#3577
On which website DOGE coin miners have announcements?
5 DOGE vs 3 DOGE It's a 0.015$ vs  0.001$ txfee (0.005$ difference)

[06-Aug-19 11:54 PM] 花果山#5224
If the unit price of the coin rises, such a setting is difficult to popularize.

[06-Aug-19 11:54 PM] TonyL#3577
But this way txtransactions faster and reach mempool more guaranteed so it was increased in interests of AtomicDEX users

[06-Aug-19 11:55 PM] TonyL#3577
`If the unit price of the coin rises, such a setting is difficult to popularize.` txfee can be adjusted any moment

[06-Aug-19 11:56 PM] 花果山#5224
All miners in AtomicDEX should have a publicity fee. Not a DOGE.

[06-Aug-19 11:56 PM] TonyL#3577
if DOGE blockchain will  constantly and reliable accept transactions with 3 DOGE txfee without issues 5 can be changed to 3 for sure

[06-Aug-19 11:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I agree that it's good idea to display txfees before swap start

[07-Aug-19 12:00 AM] 花果山#5224
0.13% is a reward paid to market makers?
Did the market maker have already earned the difference?
Everyone can place a single order, and the difference is the income.

[07-Aug-19 12:06 AM] TonyL#3577
0.13% taker trading fees (1/777) collecting on special address and distributing between DEX coins holders. Also there is a 10% discount for swaps with KMD. For maker fee is 0%

[07-Aug-19 12:16 AM] 花果山#5224
Why is DEX coins charging? Is this a development reward? Still DEX maintenance costs?

[07-Aug-19 12:19 AM] 花果山#5224
DEX is the platform share of the atomic exchange dividends?

[07-Aug-19 12:21 AM] 花果山#5224
Maybe I should hold BNB instead of KMD+DEX?

[07-Aug-19 12:35 AM] 花果山#5224
Making a DEX is deliberately hindering the development of KMD? No wonder the price has dropped even lower.

[07-Aug-19 12:40 AM] 花果山#5224
Do not understand whether the atomic exchange technology belongs to KMD or to DEX? If it belongs to KMD, the proceeds should be given to KMD holders. Of course, if it belongs to DEX and KMD does not matter. I have nothing to say.

[07-Aug-19 12:43 AM] 花果山#5224
AtomicDEX is not for KMD, it is actually for DEX. Is it only for 5% rewards for holding KMD?

{Reactions}
👆 

[07-Aug-19 12:53 AM] 花果山#5224
This is to abandon KMD and recreate a DEX.

[07-Aug-19 12:58 AM] allbits#5898
Wrong

[07-Aug-19 01:00 AM] allbits#5898
KMD is under continuous development on multiple fronts. Where do you come up with this "abandon"? Facts please.

[07-Aug-19 01:01 AM] 花果山#5224
More to say no benefit, let the market to verify it.

[07-Aug-19 01:02 AM] 花果山#5224
Why do you want to create DEX??? with KMD?

[07-Aug-19 01:03 AM] 花果山#5224
What is the purpose of DEX?

[07-Aug-19 01:04 AM] 花果山#5224
Develop a technology and create a coin?

[07-Aug-19 01:04 AM] allbits#5898
This DEX is s massive leap forward for crypto currency. Hard to think that you're encouraging people to stop developing it?? Bizarre!

[07-Aug-19 01:05 AM] 花果山#5224
Why can't I apply KMD directly. Need to create another new DEX coin?

[07-Aug-19 01:06 AM] allbits#5898
You are severely under informed

[07-Aug-19 01:06 AM] allbits#5898
DEX predates KMD. It is not a new coin

[07-Aug-19 01:07 AM] 花果山#5224
Then you are happy.

[07-Aug-19 01:08 AM] allbits#5898
Seems that the set up that has been in place for years isn't satisfactory in helping you meet your little personal financial needs. And for that reason you make bizarre complaints and accusations. Got it.

[07-Aug-19 01:09 AM] 花果山#5224
Forget it, don't want to say anything for something. Let's toss with you. I still hold BTC is the best.

[07-Aug-19 01:10 AM] allbits#5898
Meanwhile a great technological leap is taking place right under your nose. Sit back and enjoy it. Help them test and improve. This is such important infrastructure for the entire crypto world.

[07-Aug-19 01:10 AM] allbits#5898
I agree with you the BTC is great. So is Atomicdex.

[07-Aug-19 01:14 AM] 花果山#5224
I am using Google Translate, there may be errors, I mean DEX is unreasonable, I will reduce the number of uses, I will hold BTC, not KMD.

[07-Aug-19 01:17 AM] allbits#5898
You're right. There are errors in your understanding and your communication.  You can't possibly mean what you say.

[07-Aug-19 01:19 AM] allbits#5898
Coming in here and telling people their project is unreasonable! While it's obviously the product of years of hard work by many many people, and is one of the most important achievements in crypto currency since the beginning of bitcoin.

👍 💯 

[07-Aug-19 01:19 AM] allbits#5898

[07-Aug-19 01:30 AM] 花果山#5224
@allbits  If you feel good, you will use it more. If you feel bad, you can use it less. It is a matter of choice.

[07-Aug-19 01:38 AM] allbits#5898
People will use it because it's useful. Very useful.  If you don't see that, no-one can help you.  

I remember using bitcoin for the first time in 2012.  It was useful. Very useful.

[07-Aug-19 01:39 AM] 花果山#5224
They are all personal choices, and there is no right or wrong.

[07-Aug-19 01:40 AM] allbits#5898
Hahahahaha. I was right about bitcoin in 2012!

[07-Aug-19 01:42 AM] allbits#5898
You can go on letting your precious feelings get in the way of seeing the obvious fact that Atomicdex is a huge breakthrough.

[07-Aug-19 01:47 AM] FtrSaroth#2069
@花果山 If i remember correctly what i read, when all the fees accumulated reach 1 million on value, all these fees gonna be converted to kmd and shared betwen who hold the assets dex, supernet, jumblr, etc, so yes, the directly befited gonna be who hold that assets, but indirectly all kmd holder because those fees gonna be used to buy kmd

[07-Aug-19 01:47 AM] FtrSaroth#2069
or im wrong?

[07-Aug-19 01:48 AM] 花果山#5224
People's dissatisfaction with BTC and ETH is that the miners are too expensive and the transfer is slow. If ETH and sharding technology solve the congestion and miners' costs, what are your advantages?

[07-Aug-19 01:49 AM] allbits#5898
Wrong channel for discussion of KMD as a coin. Go to #talk-trading  please

[07-Aug-19 01:49 AM] allbits#5898
This channel is for Atomicdex please

👌 

[07-Aug-19 01:52 AM] 花果山#5224
@FtrSaroth  Paying double miners will only reduce the frequency of use.

[07-Aug-19 01:54 AM] 花果山#5224
Feel good, you can use more, if you are not good, you can use it.

[07-Aug-19 02:05 AM] allbits#5898
You are wrong.

[07-Aug-19 02:06 AM] allbits#5898
People will use it because it is useful. Very useful. You can miss the boat because of your feelings.

[07-Aug-19 02:09 AM] 花果山#5224
If you feel good, you can use it. There is nothing to say.

[07-Aug-19 02:13 AM] allbits#5898
Bye. You will be proven wrong.

[07-Aug-19 03:05 AM] jspook16#3059
For the average trader I see it very useful

[07-Aug-19 03:05 AM] jspook16#3059
But we shall see

[07-Aug-19 04:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi guys, quick questions on the way out the door...
atomicdex has the disclaimer bout using real funds.  Is that only for the DEX function or does it include using the wallet for real funds as well?
I've seached for info on using BCH.  Seems it needs the old format wallet.  Is this still the case, or has that been changed?  Where can I find further info on using BCH on atomicDEX?

[07-Aug-19 04:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks a lot.

[07-Aug-19 07:22 AM] gcharang#6833
@CrisF the disclaimer is for all aspects of the atomicDEX as it is still in beta
but it is mainly for the DEX part
BCH still uses the old address in atomicDEX: starts with "1"
have you been invited?
