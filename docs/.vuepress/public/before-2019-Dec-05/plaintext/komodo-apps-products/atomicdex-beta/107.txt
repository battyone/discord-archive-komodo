58th on the list

[02-Nov-19 08:44 AM] Jimm B.#9993
unsuccessful swaps are worth as much as successful ones?

[02-Nov-19 08:50 AM] TonyL#3577
nope, only succesful swaps counting and the fact of unsuccesful attempts in general as 1 ticket (in case if succesful swaps count = 0)

[02-Nov-19 09:25 AM] Artist#0765
So 2 successful count?

Congratulations winners!! :rum: No luck for me too..

[02-Nov-19 10:00 AM] Jimm B.#9993
Is there an address where I can send my test coins?  faucet?

[02-Nov-19 10:17 AM] ciumete#3212
in future for more transparency for extract winners maybe u will use a service like random.org

[02-Nov-19 10:18 AM] ciumete#3212
or create the own service based on cc-lottery üôÇ

[02-Nov-19 10:24 AM] peratt#6611
Damn why not make live draw for fair and transparency ?

What a bad day for me :(

[02-Nov-19 10:37 AM] Checking#6355
I'm number 6 on list, make 23 succesfull swap and 26 fail then got nothing :(

[02-Nov-19 10:37 AM] Checking#6355
I was wondering how does the raffle work?

[02-Nov-19 10:39 AM] Jimm B.#9993
@Checking You get 0.777 üòâ

[02-Nov-19 10:39 AM] peratt#6611
@Checking see Jim b not winner too ..how team to make fair draw?

[02-Nov-19 10:41 AM] Checking#6355
@Jimm B. hah, not commensurate with what I have done, 23 ticket worth nothing üòì‚òπÔ∏è

[02-Nov-19 10:41 AM] Jimm B.#9993
it was drawn fairly.  I'm sure.

[02-Nov-19 10:42 AM] Checking#6355
I dont think so, they should be tranparancy when make a draw

[02-Nov-19 10:42 AM] peratt#6611
Lmao

[02-Nov-19 10:43 AM] Jimm B.#9993
@Checking I'll send you my 0.777 if it makes you happier.

[02-Nov-19 10:45 AM] Checking#6355
No thank

[02-Nov-19 10:47 AM] Jimm B.#9993
I also think that everyone who made 1 successful swap got 1 ticket.  nobody has more than 1 ticket.

[02-Nov-19 10:48 AM] Checking#6355
Hah?!?!?

[02-Nov-19 10:48 AM] Jimm B.#9993
komodo could have made the raffle more transparent.  but I'm 101% sure that everything is fair.

[02-Nov-19 10:49 AM] Checking#6355
As you that announce yesterday and on telegram channel

[02-Nov-19 10:49 AM] Jimm B.#9993
Due to the extremely high load placed on the network, far fewer swaps went through than what the Komodo team had first anticipated. As such, we adjusted the requirements for entry into the prize pool lottery. Anyone who matched a single swap was entered into the prize pool.

[02-Nov-19 10:50 AM] Checking#6355
@TonyL  said 1 succesfull swap is = 1 ticket

[02-Nov-19 10:50 AM] Checking#6355

[02-Nov-19 10:58 AM] Artist#0765
I made 2 successful

[02-Nov-19 10:58 AM] Artist#0765
Swaps that is 2 tickets

[02-Nov-19 10:58 AM] Jimm B.#9993
I dont think so

[02-Nov-19 10:58 AM] Artist#0765
And checking would get 77 kmd

[02-Nov-19 10:59 AM] Artist#0765
Cause he was 6th on the list

[02-Nov-19 10:59 AM] Artist#0765
20 of the top candidates would get 77kmd

[02-Nov-19 10:59 AM] Jimm B.#9993
they have changed the rules that everyone who makes a swap, gets the entry to the raffle.  after the old conditions (30 swaps) you would not even have gotten the entry.

[02-Nov-19 10:59 AM] Artist#0765
1rst and 2nd will get 777

{Reactions}
‚òï 

[02-Nov-19 10:59 AM] Artist#0765
That was the case but I think only 2 or 3 guys got 30 swaps xD

[02-Nov-19 10:59 AM] Jimm B.#9993
1 swap= 1 Ticket.... 28 swaps=1 ticket

[02-Nov-19 11:00 AM] Jimm B.#9993
I have 28

[02-Nov-19 11:00 AM] Artist#0765

[02-Nov-19 11:02 AM] Jimm B.#9993
he did not say that more swaps give more tickets.

[02-Nov-19 11:02 AM] Aron‚ÄúXuanLeeeeee‚ÄúGoldberg#3393
@Artist per lottery !! not the first and second receives 777 KMD

[02-Nov-19 11:03 AM] Artist#0765
Huh?

[02-Nov-19 11:03 AM] Jimm B.#9993

[02-Nov-19 11:04 AM] Artist#0765
Out of these people?

[02-Nov-19 11:04 AM] Artist#0765
Or will it work swap wise I am confused cause the article said something else

[02-Nov-19 11:04 AM] Aron‚ÄúXuanLeeeeee‚ÄúGoldberg#3393
I landed in second place, I didn't get 777 KMD! Lottery !!

[02-Nov-19 11:05 AM] Checking#6355
One thing, I doubt about the drawn

[02-Nov-19 11:05 AM] Checking#6355
Make it public

[02-Nov-19 11:05 AM] Checking#6355
How does the drawn works

[02-Nov-19 11:06 AM] Artist#0765
So I have 2 successful swaps am I also a part of the draw?

[02-Nov-19 11:06 AM] Jimm B.#9993
Yes

[02-Nov-19 11:07 AM] Jimm B.#9993
come on people .... just accept that you just did not have any luck.

[02-Nov-19 11:07 AM] Artist#0765
It will be totally biased mate? @Checking I doubt about any cheating or stuff..

[02-Nov-19 11:07 AM] Artist#0765
Well still if I am in the draw I still think I am in the game

[02-Nov-19 11:07 AM] Artist#0765
What if the guy who was first in the list dont even appear in the draw.. wont that be unfair

[02-Nov-19 11:09 AM] Jimm B.#9993
anyone who has a successful swap has been admitted to the lottery.  no matter if 1 or 100 swaps.  Everyone had the same Chance.

[02-Nov-19 11:09 AM] Artist#0765
Ooh noice

[02-Nov-19 11:10 AM] Artist#0765
Then best of luck everyone

[02-Nov-19 11:10 AM] ca333#0118
@Checking - the raffle was fair and based on a random number generator - one of the most trustworthy humans managed this process and i can assure you 100% that this was totally fair. Please keep in mind that it was not ranking based but a lottery based raffle. So you d not only need successful swaps but also luck in order to be picked - and notice that we will randomly award others from the list who did not win. 

For the next big stress test we will use a blockchain based raffle method that will be publicly verifiable and provable fair.

[02-Nov-19 11:10 AM] Checking#6355
@Jimm B.  The more swaps you make, the better your chances of winning a prize.¬†

Note that

[02-Nov-19 11:10 AM] Artist#0765

All winners can be seen here.

[02-Nov-19 11:14 AM] ca333#0118
I was thinking on using something that would deliver instant results the next time - what i proposed internally is:

We could actually even do something fully automated so that winners will be automatically picked the second the test is over:
e.g. we decide on a mathematical constant (stored in the blockchain BEFORE the stress-test starts) that gets combined (multiplied or other arithmetic operation) with a specific range of chars from the decimal repesentation of the pubkey/address of the stress-testers - now the final result after combination with the "raffle-constant" will be a decimal number - and then the FIRST mined Komodo block after the stress-test is over will be taken - then the hash of this block will be used to pick a pre-defined range from the HEX - transformed into decimal repr. - and now the closest number from the testers number will win - then the 2nd. and so on.

what do you think about this?
