@farl Wanna to see this page too... >__>

[31-Oct-19 03:56 PM] stefanomarty#9184
I understand it's a test, but zero swaps on more than 20 orders as taker? Should I keep dding more orders?

[31-Oct-19 03:56 PM] farl#9964
Keep on trying and praise to the Komodo God 🦎🙏🏻

[31-Oct-19 03:56 PM] farl#9964
Cancel old orders, wait a minute on the 0/3 screen. try again...

[31-Oct-19 03:57 PM] stefanomarty#9184
ahahhah ok

[31-Oct-19 03:57 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I have 5 successful trades now in this test, but leaderboard show only 1 for my addr.

[31-Oct-19 03:57 PM] optickle#9937
Android, dex indicates no internet connection

[31-Oct-19 03:57 PM] optickle#9937
A few trade timeouts too

[31-Oct-19 03:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Guys, I know what my problem was why the balance was there and sometimes it wasnt. My balances/transactions from faucet had 0 confirmations...

[31-Oct-19 03:59 PM] Strob#3417
reminds me of the days I was trying to play video game on tv with a brand new touch-tone phone. We had to call repeatedly to be the one who will play while thousands of other will be forced to watch and wait

[31-Oct-19 03:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so check your adress in the explorer to see if your balances is confirmed on the blockchain

[31-Oct-19 04:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I was able to enter trades sometimes nonetheless even though balance wasnt really there, so maybe some are trying to connect with people trying to trade with unconfirmed balances. And that should not be possible offcourse!

[31-Oct-19 04:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So only logical your trades dont work in that case

[31-Oct-19 04:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You dont want to end up trading 10 BTC for whatever amount of kmd if one of both balances is not confirmed...

[31-Oct-19 04:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So my new gameplan:
1) check if balances are confirmed
2) try trading, put in order that matches the books
3) if trade not matches within 30 secs, remove trade: you are probably trying to match with someone with unconfirmed balance
4) rince and repeat

If you have swaps that were not on leaderboard counted, please send me your logs

Where is swaps_db ? I want to clear my shit out...android

[31-Oct-19 04:08 PM] TonyL#3577
You can use settings -> applications -> atomicdex -> clean application data. But it'll delete your wallet as well so ensure you saved the seed

[31-Oct-19 04:09 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Ok

[31-Oct-19 04:09 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Let you know if it helps

[31-Oct-19 04:13 PM] Jimm B.#9993
I think the Leaderboard website is not correct.  have some fails and more complete.

@Jimm B. If you have swaps that were not on leaderboard counted, please send your logs to @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

[31-Oct-19 04:15 PM] Jimm B.#9993
I send the logs when the test is over.  is that OK?

[31-Oct-19 04:16 PM] MrV#9757
Yes its wrong for me too, it shows 2 for me but I have 4 complete and 2 failed so far

[31-Oct-19 04:18 PM] TonyL#3577
`I send the logs when the test is over.  is that OK?` logs might be shrinked because of max file size exceed so it's better to at least save it somewhere today

[31-Oct-19 04:22 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
seems 1:1 trades go through better for some reason. Or is it just coincidence?

[31-Oct-19 04:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
You connected with smart people 1:1

[31-Oct-19 04:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Even odds

[31-Oct-19 04:25 PM] Umaru#8531
swap is not working
i try for 3 hours and nothing then how i complete 30 successful trade?

[31-Oct-19 04:26 PM] farl#9964
Nobody really knows. Just keep trying.

[31-Oct-19 04:26 PM] Artist#0765
I also have made 1 successful

[31-Oct-19 04:26 PM] Artist#0765
But doesn't show my records

[31-Oct-19 04:27 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Order books should be stored in KV with many many peers....but...that's probably too slow

[31-Oct-19 04:31 PM] Booster99x#7054
Most of the people must have stopped trying to swap and it's as not working as ealier 😂

[31-Oct-19 04:31 PM] Bico#7646
Hi all... The swap doesn't work 😂 😂  only 2 success and many failed 😂 🖖

[31-Oct-19 04:31 PM] farl#9964
@Patrick Friggens My successful swap was also 1:1

[31-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Umaru#8531
kmd must snd reward for all tester :tux_scream:

[31-Oct-19 04:32 PM] The1earl#0991
I haven't had one go through either. Had one failed at the start. Even when I choose an available swap in the order book. The trades just sit there. On Android.

[31-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Umaru#8531
tester work hard but dex dont wrok and go sleep

[31-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Umaru#8531
😀

[31-Oct-19 04:32 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I guess the order could have spent tx and no other peer could attack that order....it would just take more time to order match

[31-Oct-19 04:33 PM] Goku#9007
I created a order for 0.04ltc against 320dgb
Can someone take my offer?

[31-Oct-19 04:34 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Spamming 1 sell order with 30 buyers isn't working very well

[31-Oct-19 04:34 PM] farl#9964
I created a bunch of new orders 1:1 with 1 MORTY and 1 RICK, go fill them!

[31-Oct-19 04:34 PM] Sharifa#7849
@Umaru too late ... they told me to delete all my failed orders so i deleted all of them 😁

[31-Oct-19 04:37 PM] Artist#0765
Same here XD

@farl still step 0

[31-Oct-19 04:39 PM] farl#9964
I am chosing orders only 1:1

[31-Oct-19 04:40 PM] farl#9964
1.0 RICK with 1.0 MORTY or vs

if you are missing swap counts, you can send me your logs. might take me a while to go through them tho 😅

[31-Oct-19 04:43 PM] gigamesh#3544

[31-Oct-19 04:44 PM] gigamesh#3544

[31-Oct-19 04:45 PM] tese#3502
I cant count my completed swaps because history tab is not showing the first done

[31-Oct-19 04:45 PM] farl#9964
I can’t imagine someone has 30. He or she was not here

ddi u expect it?

[31-Oct-19 04:47 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Besides the backend stuff my general impression is nice and easy to understand UI. Portfolio tab super easy to read balances. Dex tab for trading 6 simple steps to drop a market maker option -although, if there are a ton of maker options already , 1st time user might not realize to scroll all the way.- on Android S9+

[31-Oct-19 04:49 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
anyone missing swap counts, send me logs once test complete. worst case we will review manually, and I will announce once stats site has verified counts

[31-Oct-19 04:49 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
For me the android app has many bugs and issues, the cli is more reliable.

[31-Oct-19 04:49 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
