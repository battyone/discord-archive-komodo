If you are not in Wifi you probably have  a different IP though...

@phm87 I think the value of both the amount you are sending and receiving should be greater than 0.00777

Question : I spent 0.0001 kmd but the fee was 0.0001 without any warning. Is it planned to add a warning when fees represent a big part of the trade (> 10% as example)

[26-Jul-19 04:18 PM] JvdP#8992
This was during a swap. But I don't think it should have been negative in the first place...

When setting up a wallet, I am unable to proceed without creating a password. The description says I can choose not to use a password. There is no button to proceed without a password, and the 'confirm password' does not work without filling out the password fields. What gives?

Not sure if this is a known issue, but my orders or in-progress swaps don't show up under Orders anymore. Yet they're still there, as I'm still getting them executed. They're never showing under orders, not even after just placing them. This didn't use to be the case (hence "anymore"). I'm on Android.

[26-Jul-19 06:03 PM] Vanncoins#3044
I can only load my portfolio if I log back out and back in, because it removes everything other than KMD and BTC. If I add QTUM it gets stuck

@Cryptoraptor that is normal
you get
1 RICK for 2 MORTY
and 
1 MORTY for 2 RICK

you will always be losing them
that is how the orderbooks are setup

I have my funds locked by swaps, how long does it take to unlock them?

[27-Jul-19 06:23 AM] acidbird#7266
The app itself looks really like super early beta, there is still a lot can be done: design, ux/ui, if you are making a swap you still see the whole amount in your wallet, if you have smth locked you don’t understand it is locked until you try to move or trade funds, etc. If the team wants to create one universal place for crypto they will have to drastically upgrade the app, atm from design and ux/ui, content point of view it looks amateur and homemade. I am sure backend part is great but frontend has to be great as well in my opinion..

I’m getting a max swapable BTC of 0.00024653 even though I have more than that available. No matter what I type in, or if I hit “max”. Goes higher, then snaps back. Nothing locked in swaps. I’m on iphone7. This a known thing? A beta restriction?

[27-Jul-19 06:30 AM] JvdP#8992
Ooh come to think of it, now that @acidbird mentions it - it would be really great to get an indication of fees and/or minimum trade amounts upfront. I have to try to make a trade before i can see whether I'm "allowed" to.

You can check out delta, blockfolio, cryptonews, o3 ios apps, maybe others to see what they did and have inside (at least from content, ux/ui point of view), it is always great to widen the vision by checking out what is already available on the market..

[27-Jul-19 07:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@fat3lvis though you may have more BTC available, the trading pair you are wanting to swap may not have the volume you are after (you can only buy as much as there is for sale).

Any chance the beta will include ARRR btw? I think I read that it at least worked on paper. I'd really like to see the proof of concept of swapping to a true privacy coin. If that's brought to life, the dex has got something nobody else has. (since for active trading, the dex's fees and weird order book will hamper adoption, I'm afraid).

[27-Jul-19 05:15 PM] az#1921
hey guys, since the update I'm not able to publish a trade offer. I can reach the "confirm" step but then my order page remains empty. Any idea why ?

@az have you tried rebooting your phone?

I can make a RICK/MORTY but nothing in the order page.

[27-Jul-19 06:27 PM] Angelina#6231
@az You can try clearing app Data and Cache in Settings ->  Apps -> AtomicDEX. 
Please make sure you save you're seed first, you'd need to enter it again
 
Please do not clear data/cache if you have failed swaps with funds stuck

[27-Jul-19 06:34 PM] actionslacks#4072
@JvdP implementing z transactions will probably take some time. the fees are competetive with everything else out there afaik. my favorite feature, which you cannot get anywhere else, is the liquidity multiplier, or being able to place multiple orders and only needing enough crypto to fill one.

[27-Jul-19 06:35 PM] az#1921
@Angelina  Excellent idea. Everything work perfectly now.

[27-Jul-19 06:36 PM] az#1921
but history is now empty. Sad, I loved to watch tens of successful swaps !

[27-Jul-19 06:36 PM] Angelina#6231
Time to swap more ! 😃

[27-Jul-19 08:02 PM] JvdP#8992
@actionslacks good point. The reason I'd like for z transactions to be included isn't the fees though (I see how my previous post would have led you in that direction, my bad), it's the anonimity. Everywhere else, you'd need an account to make your funds go "poof" for anyone who's watching you; on any kmdex, you'll just swap via arrr and off to wherever it was you where going and you're off the grid. So that would be the adoption booster in the arrr case, not so much the fees. And of course, then there the multiple use of funds you mention. 😃
