I registered about 4 hours ago on atomicdex.io as beta Tester (sorry to being late but I wanted to focus on my notary node after hardfork). After how much time should I receive an email ?

[25-Jul-19 09:55 PM] phm87#7395
@Oszy about SSL certificate, as we wanted http and https for www and non www, we used 4 ssl certif (free thing to renew once per 3 month). ^^ Too many ppl used our http url including softwares with hardcoded stuff.

[25-Jul-19 10:06 PM] TonyL#3577
@phm87 please DM me your email connected to playmarket or app store (depends of platform for which you've enrolled)

Hi! Please DM me log from app first (Settings -> Send feedback) then try to restart app/phone

[25-Jul-19 10:22 PM] TonyL#3577
If it'll not help - try to logout/login

[25-Jul-19 11:53 PM] bigpromo16#8101
@TonyL can you help me

[25-Jul-19 11:54 PM] mo7881#6408
@Markus sign out from settings then sign in again

[25-Jul-19 11:55 PM] Markus#5464
Even if that solves it, its still a bug

Hi. I also got an E-Mail but there is no AtomicDex App in my AppStore. 😳

[26-Jul-19 06:56 AM] ca333#0118
send a DM with your app or playstore attached email address to @TonyL or @SHossain if you used a wrong one for the signup.

[26-Jul-19 07:04 AM] Lance#9742
I was in the 1000 beta testers list, then dm'd my email address a few days ago, but I still can't download the app :(

[26-Jul-19 07:28 AM] McNipples#8698
Hello... I received an email, which invited me to test the DEX for iOS with "You can now download the app from the App Store.". But there was no code for testflight, nor a link to download the app included. Any advice, how to download the app?

[26-Jul-19 07:29 AM] ca333#0118
@McNipples get it from TestFlight - ask @SHossain or @TonyL for further details if you cant find it

[26-Jul-19 07:29 AM] McNipples#8698
Thanks. So I have to ask for a testflight code?

[26-Jul-19 07:51 AM] TonyL#3577
@Lance could you please try to clean play market cache?  Also try to access via this link https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex

[26-Jul-19 07:52 AM] TonyL#3577
@McNipples Please DM me your email connected to app store

[26-Jul-19 07:52 AM] Lance#9742
Woah thanks it worked with the link!

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #44 PIN is initialized when device reboots during account creation
I rebooted my phone (Android) while the app was encrypting my initial wallet and didn't seem to finish (both fast and non-fast encryption). After the reboot, the app thought I had a wallet with a PIN and asked me for the PIN, but of course I didn't know the PIN since I never got there. 

I fixed it using recover wallet (I had the seed anyway), and that worked great.

When opening the failed wallet with the passphrase (so I can try to delete it), I get stuck on "decrypting wallet".

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #46 Better Seed input when restoring a seed phrase
Suggestion:

When restoring a seed phrase (not custom), instead of a single blank, it would be better to provide 12 boxes and validate the input into each box to make sure they are valid bip39 words and provide feedback after each word.

To do this, my suggestion will be to provide 12 boxes and a button that says 
 "Next box". When the button is hit, the word in the current box should be validated and if it is valid, move the cursor to the next box. If not turn the box red and say invali...

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #35: \[password\] space in the end
Will try, might be on my side but happened twice. When typing the password a final space was added into the password. 
So basically the password for encryption had a space in the end, usually they do not accept that on passwords but I might be wrong.

[26-Jul-19 03:20 PM] Oszy#5734
can I run same wallet (seed) at the same time on multiple mm2 instances ?

[26-Jul-19 03:22 PM] gcharang#6833
@Oszy I don't think it is recommended
Any use case i can think of that needs same seed on different instances can be done on one instance

You can maybe enable different pairs on different instances with same seed without trouble

[26-Jul-19 03:23 PM] Oszy#5734
oh yes that's what i am doing, there are pairs on ChainSwap that are not on Atomicdex and was wondering if it interferes or not

[26-Jul-19 03:24 PM] gcharang#6833
It shouldn't
Unless there is something I am not thinking of lol

[26-Jul-19 03:25 PM] Oszy#5734
yeah i couldn't think of anything as well, thank you for the quick answer 😃

[26-Jul-19 04:11 PM] jansako#3330
@Oszy running two instances of MM from the same seed on the same IP was a problem with MM1. The swaps would just fail most of the time. As it was explained to me, it was something with the data not knowing which instance of MM it belongs to. if it was resolved in MM2, great but I would check...

i am now running chainswap on pc and atomicdex on phone at the same time, and swaps are working
