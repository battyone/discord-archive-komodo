Yes exactly @Acura - this is the localization file with all app strings that need to be translated in order to provide more language support. 
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish and Russian is being arranged by our team. For all other languages we would be very grateful to get community support.

we need to speedup the init time, do things in the background, do things in parallel, defer waiting for 100% complete

[18-Jul-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
with many coins, if we require all coins to get to 100% initialized, then as we have more coins, the odds of a stuck init gets larger and larger

[18-Jul-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
and maybe the user didnt even care about that coin for that instance

[18-Jul-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #24: Long app startup on Android
@Kiruel It's not normal for user experience. IIRC I was told that GUI should parallelize the enable requests to speed up them. Is it happening in latest version? I'm going to perform a benchmark with same coins activated in parallel and check what time it will take. I will post results here.

@jl777c i will check the init routine again but its launching coins in parallel already - what we could do is removing the "loading screen" and having the coins pop up in the dashboard as they init/connect one by one vs. waiting for all to finish the init/conn. This is likely a UX issue.

[18-Jul-19 10:30 AM] yorklab#7270
Apparently l loose coins every time I trade because Im almost out of Morty and Rick. The faucet will not give me any more, Can someone supply me with more Morty RDsC11qvt4Tm1Koj8UUAjxcXk4rdHFW41H

BTW, this has been resolved already but in case others ran into this issue, and as somebody has already mentioned, if you can't see your transactions of the coins then go into the AtomicDEX apps section in settings then "Clear Data" and "Clear Cache". Make sure you save you're seed first. That worked for me.

[18-Jul-19 10:42 AM] TonyL#3577
Please do not clear data/cache if you have failed swaps with funds stuck

[18-Jul-19 10:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Is there some reliable way to reproduce issue with coins tx history and is it actual for specific coins? Unfortunately on my side txhistory loading after different manipulations

[18-Jul-19 10:44 AM] yorklab#7270
My original issue was that I could see the transaction history of all the coins except for Morty. And once I tried to access the transaction history of Morty then I could no longer see the transaction history of any coins. After clearing data and clearing cache everything works fine now.

[18-Jul-19 10:56 AM] Oszy#5734
I cleared cache as I have same issue as @yorklab now i can't even create an order and original issue still remains

[18-Jul-19 10:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
which issue? tx history?

[18-Jul-19 10:57 AM] yorklab#7270
Clearing cache alone didn't work for me, I also had to clear data. But you'll need your seed to get back in.

[18-Jul-19 10:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[18-Jul-19 02:10 PM] 27aume#8635
Hi, about the fee structure. I think i dont understand it fully.
I made 4 KMD >LTC trades then resold back all at once LTC > KMD.
My initial balance was 7.77KMD and now its 5.9673KMD and 10~ cents of LTC.
This make 22.7799% fee.
Isnt it a bit high?
(Maybe some balances dont update properly)

Also as a feed back, wouldnt it be possible to give the 10%discount on fees when purchasing KMD with Xcoin. In other word 10%disc. for anytrade implying KMD, base or rel.
Thanks in advance.

[18-Jul-19 02:19 PM] ca333#0118
ref. the fee - these are hardcoded. But the price you buy/sell may be very different which in the end isnt the fee - but market/trade loss.

[18-Jul-19 02:20 PM] cipi#4502
Look at the prices your are buying/selling at... my node asks for 5% higher price when you buy LTC and bids 5% lower when you sell. Also beware the time difference between buy and sell, prices change.

[18-Jul-19 02:20 PM] 27aume#8635
Yes i considered that but price did not change much. 
Yes i will send the logs thank you :)

with a 5% profit margin, the bid ask spread is 10%, dexfee of 0.15%

[18-Jul-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
2 trades is 20%

[18-Jul-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not the dexfee

✅ 

[18-Jul-19 02:24 PM] 27aume#8635
Yes, that makes more sence, so on my 22.7799%
10% is lost and 12.7799% would be fees

[18-Jul-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
no fees are 0.15%

[18-Jul-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
i think you maybe did 2 swaps?

[18-Jul-19 02:24 PM] 27aume#8635
Lowr then 15 because most trades were on kmd base

[18-Jul-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD trades get a 10% discount on dexfee

[18-Jul-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
but the bid/ask spread is whatever it is

[18-Jul-19 02:25 PM] 27aume#8635
Yes ok now it all make sence thanks a lot

[18-Jul-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810

`swapSucceful` should be `swapSuccessful` but any changes need correction where it's called.   If it ain't broke.....
