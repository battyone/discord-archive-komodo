No centralized information it's the purpose of the app. @Slyris

[19-Jul-19 01:53 PM] Kiruel#2091
Yeah I agree @jl777c .

[19-Jul-19 01:54 PM] Kiruel#2091
But we can track in the chain the swaps no ?

[19-Jul-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i think exporting per device is fine, if users need a 100% complete record, they just need to export from each phone. seems like not a big issue

[19-Jul-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
when volumes are low, we can, but how to detect swaps that dont complete?

[19-Jul-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
also for zaddr based swaps, the source and destination for half the swap is "invisible"

[19-Jul-19 01:55 PM] Kiruel#2091
Hum.

[19-Jul-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
which means it will be more accurate to get the sum of local history than via blockchain

[19-Jul-19 01:55 PM] Kiruel#2091
I just think of people when they log with there seed to another platform like iOS to Android or in the future Desktop.

[19-Jul-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
sum of all devices -> accurate history

[19-Jul-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
without a centralized reporting i see no other way, especially when zaddr swaps come online

[19-Jul-19 01:57 PM] Kiruel#2091
Because they use centralized application everytime. That can be strange for users.

[19-Jul-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you specifically export the zaddr swap info, there is no way anybody will be able to correlate

[19-Jul-19 01:57 PM] Kiruel#2091
Ok.

[19-Jul-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
welcome to the decentralized world

[19-Jul-19 01:57 PM] Kiruel#2091
haha

[19-Jul-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
some things must be different

[19-Jul-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
else it will be the same centralized world

[19-Jul-19 01:57 PM] Kiruel#2091
Yeah true but we need to teach ppl.

[19-Jul-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if people really need their history, they will find out how to export their history

[19-Jul-19 01:58 PM] Kiruel#2091
Or at-least find sollution to be close to centralized.

[19-Jul-19 01:58 PM] Kiruel#2091
(but still DEX)

[19-Jul-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
decentralized trading with centralized big brother tracking all swaps?

[19-Jul-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i feel allergic to this

[19-Jul-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
if people want to report, let them, but we cant force them. so that means we would need to record all trades from everybody to be able to record it centrally as we wont know if they will want a history in the future

[19-Jul-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
you see where this leads to?

[19-Jul-19 01:59 PM] ca333#0118
atomicDEX wouldnt be as efficient as it is if we did persist all swaps - what we can do in the future is turning it a local app feature with a local persisting DB for swaps. Not much more that can be done for now and until the swaps persist in the network which i see resulting in potential efficiency issues

[19-Jul-19 01:59 PM] Kiruel#2091
Yeah I see exalty.

[19-Jul-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
and with zaddr swaps, it isnt possible to do it from blockchain, not to mention the difficulty in correlating who the other side of the swap was

[19-Jul-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i think a simple log of all swaps as they are complete would be sufficient and also handy for some of the requested features and bugs

[19-Jul-19 02:00 PM] Kiruel#2091
So it's just local first, and it's better like this. We just need to tell the users.

[19-Jul-19 02:00 PM] Kiruel#2091
Inside the app.

[19-Jul-19 02:00 PM] ca333#0118
yes exactly

[19-Jul-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes exactly

[19-Jul-19 02:11 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Doesn't it conflict with statistics capturing that we have to implement? The swap statuses are sent and stored on seednodes now (which also helps to troubleshoot the swaps). How should we deal with this?

[19-Jul-19 02:12 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Anyone can be a seednode actually, but the data is still stored and can be tracked by `big brother` maintaining his own seednode.

[19-Jul-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
when the bugs are all fixed, then we can just get aggregate data from the blockchain

[19-Jul-19 02:14 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Do you mean by scanning the coins blockchains trying to find swap payments?

[19-Jul-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
if we just need to get aggregate swap data, we can just track the amounts in the dexfee address and get a very good estimate

[19-Jul-19 02:23 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
It might require some effort to collect such data and then try to detect what other coin participated in swap. What is the reason to do it if we can simply allow swap status broadcast to network?

[19-Jul-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
for aggregate stats we dont need to correlate the other side

[19-Jul-19 02:24 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Of course we can add an option allowing user to disable this.

{Reactions}
💯 

[19-Jul-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
sum of all dexfees will get sum of all swaps

[19-Jul-19 02:24 PM] artem.pikulin#0794

Hi - just got the testflight invitation today and got started - pretty awesome, have done some rick > morty swaps and then some VRSC > KMD which have gone through in minutes over wireless.

Core swap functionality is amazing compared to where things were at with BarterDex MM1 - amazing effort, this is so cool!

I am on iOS iPhone 7 and found the usability tricky from the point of view of keeping the app in focus on the screen and not in the background. Using the app is fine, but waiting for swaps i ran into problems a few times

First few swaps timed out because the screen would lock, and when i bought the app back and accessed via touch ID it didn’t seem to like it much. (so set screen timeout to longer, which meant i got successful swaps but it set at 5 mins which obviously not ideal)

Assume swaps won’t complete whilst the app is in background mode?

Also seems that the touch ID biometric authentication can get it is in a bit of a mess when returning to the app double clicking to bring up the open apps in the background because the touch id message just keeps coming back even though it accepts my thumb and then app goes back into the background.

Other small thing i noticed when i first set up the wallet and hadn’t closed the app yet was when double clicking to get app into focus the screen that was being shown was the first screen with my seed in it! Now i have closed the app and started again and now the screen shown is the PIN screen as i would expect.

Using the actual app and swap function is so easy and simple, so cool, just need to test it on mobile now when walking to the pub for next use case :)

Thanks you everyone in the KMD that built this - its just phenomenal!!!

[19-Jul-19 02:25 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Current dexstats site contains both coins and their volumes.

[19-Jul-19 02:25 PM] ca333#0118
that gives user some sense of privacy and big brother can just parse the blockchains if he wants to track all swaps.

[19-Jul-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems it is just more work to add this and after debugging, and dexstats will just need to track activity at the dexfee address. it will need to do this to track DEX revshare anyway, so not any extra work

[19-Jul-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
if we are gathering this data, i just forsee it leading to bad things

[19-Jul-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i prefer to optout everybody from this

[19-Jul-19 02:29 PM] Simon#6247

I experienced this aswell.

"Assume swaps won’t complete whilst the app is in background mode?"
Would like to know this aswell, I have a few orders (not swaps, orders) up. Am wondering if they are able to complete if my app is not running in front

[19-Jul-19 02:33 PM] Simon#6247
@FtrSaroth confirmed me this swap failed at his side at 15:51. My app still has this ongoing 2/3 at 16:31

I already tried restaring the app

[19-Jul-19 02:41 PM] miles#6381
@Simon - i managed to get to get one swap through after the the low battery warning popped up in the middle of a swap and sent to the app to the background - i got it back into focus - authenticated and then went to the orders screen as quick as i could and it carried on from step 2 - but had a couple of other timeout / fail when the app was in background for longer.

[19-Jul-19 02:41 PM] Simon#6247
Maybe this has something to do with it? It is syncing since yesterday (started at 8 millions tx or so)

I hope this is not draining my 4G gygabytes

[19-Jul-19 02:49 PM] Simon#6247
Can somebody confirm wether these TX needs to be synced fully, before being able to swap? That would help

[19-Jul-19 02:49 PM] Simon#6247
@miles thanks for info 👌

[19-Jul-19 02:56 PM] miles#6381
4G Swap test just completed - Pub Enabled Swaps....

[19-Jul-19 03:06 PM] Simon#6247
I think 13.3751 went missing from my account, see attached pictures

1 = history of vrsc which shows unconfirmed tx of 13.3751 vrsc
2 = apperently confirmed tx of 13.3751 vrsc
3 = swap history showing the 13.3751 tx had timed out
4 = detail of time out

It is possible though that my account will be credited the 0.0107 eth when all ETH TX are synced? But then again, the swap shows timed out, so this is strange at the least.

Picture 2 shows this TX confirmed, while @FtrSaroth has this swap failed on his part

[19-Jul-19 03:12 PM] 27aume#8635
Some txs show as failed when they actually succed. Some testers reported it already.

[19-Jul-19 03:13 PM] 27aume#8635
If you're able to keep the logs. They might ask for them

[19-Jul-19 03:14 PM] 27aume#8635
I had this error on KMD_LTC

[19-Jul-19 03:15 PM] FtrSaroth#2069

[19-Jul-19 03:17 PM] Simon#6247
Thanks, @FtrSaroth . I'll wait this one out, let's see what happens 😃

[19-Jul-19 03:17 PM] Simon#6247
Is the 0.0107 eth missing from your account?

[19-Jul-19 03:19 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
Apparently no, only the fees every time i try a swap 😅

[19-Jul-19 03:21 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
ETH gas price is high now according to ethgasstation (https://ethgasstation.info/), the atomicDEX-API doesn't check gas price on order creation so it then results into failed swap as you attempt to trade amount close to your entire balance.

[19-Jul-19 03:22 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
So the swap_status contains error from ETH RPC node: `\"Insufficient funds. The account you tried to send transaction from does not have enough funds. Required 13700000000000000 and got: 10745000000000000.\"`

[19-Jul-19 03:22 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
I'd recommend to not trade ETH as of now at least until gas price gets lower.

[19-Jul-19 03:23 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
The stuck VRSC payment should be refunded in few hours, please restart the app periodically.

[19-Jul-19 03:23 PM] Simon#6247
My original order of 25 seems back up, while balance stays at 15.21.

ok thx @artem.pikulin , will do

[19-Jul-19 03:29 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Simon You're welcome! So you initially created 25 VRSC <-> 0.02 ETH order, it matched partially, but amount is still displayed as 25 while your balance is lower than this, correct?

[19-Jul-19 03:31 PM] Simon#6247
@artem.pikulin  correct, except the transactions shows as timed out

[19-Jul-19 03:32 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
Thanks  @artem.pikulin, with ltc tried two times 1 success and 1 failed, with eth tried 5 times and the 5 failed

[19-Jul-19 03:33 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
You may try to trade lower amount but I wouldn't recommend this as fee will be quite high.

[19-Jul-19 03:33 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
You are about to pay 1$ worth in ETH gas fee per trade.

[19-Jul-19 03:35 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
At least 0,5$ each side.

[19-Jul-19 03:35 PM] Simon#6247
I didn’t know about those gasfees. LOLthereum, thats why I’m trying to swap them for KMD 😏

[19-Jul-19 03:36 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
20 is not highest gas price ever been, it was 100 or even more sometimes during spam attacks.

[19-Jul-19 03:37 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
So ETH swap might cost even more and there's not much we can do about it.

[19-Jul-19 03:37 PM] Small Fish#5687
Hi I receive mail that said that I have got into the first batch of tester but I can’t find where on the mail is the TestFlight invitation

[19-Jul-19 03:37 PM] Small Fish#5687
To download the app

[19-Jul-19 03:38 PM] miles#6381
@Simon - head over to an exchange and dump that eth business for some KMD and then come and start loading up on the KMD eco system with some cost effective swaps 😃

[19-Jul-19 03:42 PM] Simon#6247
Yeah, that’s probably best. But i try to stay out of kyc cex’es as much as i can...

[19-Jul-19 03:42 PM] Simon#6247
I do have a binance account though

[19-Jul-19 03:44 PM] Simon#6247
I just wanted to try a eth/vrsc swap because I haven’t seen any of them yet

KMD (3) 

[19-Jul-19 04:34 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
Tried a swap with KMD/RFOX, went to succesful swap in 7 minutes without a problem, then eth is the problem! 😁

[19-Jul-19 04:36 PM] jansako#3330
Placed a couple of maker orders on SUPERNET/KMD and DEX/KMD pairs, my first Bob on MM2 is live!

[19-Jul-19 04:36 PM] jansako#3330
@artem.pikulin  was the issue with Bob dying from MM1 fixed? back then we had to restart MM every so often...
