the point of this test was to identify and isolate bugs. so far so good üòÖ

So did anyone reach 30 swaps?

[31-Oct-19 04:51 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
One point for the android app, is that I can actually take orders(normally, not today) whereas on the cli I can only make, I can never get the cli to match an order

[31-Oct-19 04:51 PM] tese#3502
I still dont know how many Ive achieved but its possible

[31-Oct-19 04:51 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not that I am aware of, but dont think getting 30 in is the only way to win a prize

[31-Oct-19 04:51 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
But I need to constantly close the app with the multitask button to get anything to work

[31-Oct-19 04:52 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@Patrick Crypto Hm. It's not as easy as 2-click in app, yet had no problems matching as taker with cli.

[31-Oct-19 04:52 PM] P3L3#1096
Wasn't asking due to prize.. Was just honestly curious

[31-Oct-19 04:52 PM] gigamesh#3544
no i dont think anybody did

[31-Oct-19 04:52 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
@Sir Seven I've made about 30 swaps with the cli, but any order I place never matches it always just becomes a taker(fine by me)

[31-Oct-19 04:53 PM] gigamesh#3544
whoa

[31-Oct-19 04:53 PM] gigamesh#3544
CLI?

[31-Oct-19 04:53 PM] gigamesh#3544
is that permitted?

[31-Oct-19 04:53 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Not during the test

[31-Oct-19 04:53 PM] farl#9964
So you didn‚Äôt make a swap, just orders?

[31-Oct-19 04:53 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@gigamesh Not right now, in general.

[31-Oct-19 04:53 PM] flequillo1986#5387
What happened?

[31-Oct-19 04:53 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I had about 12 failed swaps during the test and countless that never even made it that far

[31-Oct-19 04:54 PM] joker-h#1785
Did I win?

[31-Oct-19 04:54 PM] farl#9964
I had zero failed swaps, only orders doing nothing

[31-Oct-19 04:54 PM] gigamesh#3544
@joker-h not yet

[31-Oct-19 04:54 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
All my failed swaps were from orders placed prior to the test

[31-Oct-19 04:54 PM] joker-h#1785
I have only "failed swap", all orders.

[31-Oct-19 04:54 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Even on pairs that normally worked fine

[31-Oct-19 04:55 PM] farl#9964
How long till the end? 6 minutes or 66 minutes?

[31-Oct-19 04:55 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@farl 65

[31-Oct-19 04:56 PM] flequillo1986#5387
How do I attach a file here? The log

[31-Oct-19 04:56 PM] flequillo1986#5387
Can anyone help?

Probably better to send to @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator ?

```The Komodo team is extremely grateful for the overwhelming response we've received for the AtomicDEX Beta stress test. Due to this huge amount of participation, we hit bottlenecks in our infrastructure much sooner than we had anticipated. This led to a high percentage of swaps not matching properly. As such, we're adjusting the requirements for entry into the prize pool. All you need to do is match one swap and you're eligible to win prizes. It is not a requirement for the swap to successfully complete- one matched swap (1/3) is enough to make into the prize pool.```

[31-Oct-19 05:02 PM] Sharifa#7849
All electronums are disconnected .
Failed to make a swap today .
See you soon Team üëç

[31-Oct-19 05:02 PM] MrV#9757
My stats on the website look wrong, should I contact anyone?

[31-Oct-19 05:02 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@MrV check pinned messages

[31-Oct-19 05:04 PM] TonyL#3577
We're working on stats improving

[31-Oct-19 05:04 PM] boroghor#4327
ive got logs but i cant send dms to none of the mentioned admins/devs

[31-Oct-19 05:05 PM] Sergiobit82#6112
I m only have one swap ok the rest fail

[31-Oct-19 05:05 PM] tese#3502
you should send your logs to @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

[31-Oct-19 05:05 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@boroghor Recheck your discord privacy settings.

[31-Oct-19 05:06 PM] MrV#9757
Logs 44MB...discord max file size 8MB

[31-Oct-19 05:08 PM] gigamesh#3544
isnt that more MB than Encyclopedia Britannica?

[31-Oct-19 05:09 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@MrV You can send 'em via email or messengers to yourself, archive or post to https://paste.ubuntu.com/ or similair service.

[31-Oct-19 05:09 PM] tese#3502
@jl777c In my opinion, changing the rules between a game.is mot fair but well....Specially for those that has been testing all day with not enought success

[31-Oct-19 05:10 PM] gigamesh#3544
@tese nobody got 30

[31-Oct-19 05:10 PM] tese#3502
Much better to comunicate that after the stress ends

[31-Oct-19 05:10 PM] gigamesh#3544
should there be no winners at all?

[31-Oct-19 05:10 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
Now i have "all electrum disconected"

[31-Oct-19 05:10 PM] tese#3502
Not telling that, I think its much better to wait  the test end

[31-Oct-19 05:10 PM] tese#3502
Just that

[31-Oct-19 05:11 PM] tese#3502
Its obvious they should do that

[31-Oct-19 05:11 PM] gigamesh#3544
maybe everybody giving up? no hope of 30. extra incemtive to continue?

[31-Oct-19 05:11 PM] tese#3502
Ive been from 13.01 till now testing

[31-Oct-19 05:11 PM] gigamesh#3544
actually if everybody gave up id actually be able to sell

[31-Oct-19 05:12 PM] gigamesh#3544
i had to go afk for 2 hours, otherwise always trying

[31-Oct-19 05:12 PM] tese#3502
I know, Ive been active in all channels

[31-Oct-19 05:13 PM] tese#3502
How can we be sure nobody has reached 30 swaps? Maybe logs shows that

[31-Oct-19 05:13 PM] boroghor#4327
just...need...one....

[31-Oct-19 05:14 PM] Flint#6435
not a single swap came out made them more than 10 they hang in orders - sold and bought at any prices but not a single order worked

[31-Oct-19 05:14 PM] gigamesh#3544
10? lol

[31-Oct-19 05:14 PM] gigamesh#3544
try 100

[31-Oct-19 05:14 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Well at least bottlenecks have been identified

[31-Oct-19 05:16 PM] ciumete#3212
better, or retest, or split rewards to all participants based on each numbers of orders done üôÇ

[31-Oct-19 05:18 PM] Hooftly#1337
üò≠

[31-Oct-19 05:19 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I dont think I got a single step 1 üòÇ

[31-Oct-19 05:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I believe we have resolved the missing swap issue. Please check leaderboard and let me know if it looks like expected

@polycryptoblog
Just curious what was the bottleneck?

[31-Oct-19 05:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Have one at 2/3 now for 5 mins, probably a dud?

[31-Oct-19 05:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Can somebody from team please explain in easy words why matching doesnt work? Thank you

[31-Oct-19 05:22 PM] heguli97#5781
I am on the list, but it shows 2 completed where i have at least 6 done and visible in history

[31-Oct-19 05:22 PM] tese#3502
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator I continue not appearing there

[31-Oct-19 05:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I would expect something like this: orderbooks are p2p, network that powers it is overloaded or something like that. So nodes dont know which peer to choose because there are so many?

[31-Oct-19 05:23 PM] MrV#9757
I still see 3 for my account but I had 5 success and 5 failed

[31-Oct-19 05:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Although what do I know, I‚Äôm a noob :p

[31-Oct-19 05:23 PM] OrgiOrg#1001
my failed swap is also missing

[31-Oct-19 05:24 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
ok, some swaps may be maker not taker.... will keep digging

[31-Oct-19 05:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[31-Oct-19 05:26 PM] boroghor#4327
now time to worry about the leaderboard...lol

[31-Oct-19 05:26 PM] tese#3502
Ive been worrying about leaderboard for hours, still not fixed

[31-Oct-19 05:26 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
please dont worry about the leaderboard. it will be updated as the data arrives, but some of it is not possible to recieve just yet

[31-Oct-19 05:27 PM] tese#3502
Its ok sorry

[31-Oct-19 05:27 PM] tese#3502
Hahaha

[31-Oct-19 05:27 PM] tese#3502
Too much stress today

[31-Oct-19 05:29 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, I stressed the last 3 days getting stats pages ready... didnt realise not all seed nodes would report in. Thought I wouldnt have to stress during the test!

[31-Oct-19 05:30 PM] tese#3502
Thank for your efforts! We have a really good base to create and excelent experience
