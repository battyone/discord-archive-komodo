placing an order waiting for 10 seconds and then cancelling still can't get an order to go through. should I send the log somewhere for review?

[31-Oct-19 01:26 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590

[31-Oct-19 01:27 PM] dudezmobi#1945

[31-Oct-19 01:27 PM] jspook16#3059
are orders expected to take longer now?

[31-Oct-19 01:27 PM] TonyL#3577
@Hooftly infra bottlenecks are clear now from devs side so no need logs for now

[31-Oct-19 01:28 PM] benzo365#8202

[31-Oct-19 01:28 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031

[31-Oct-19 01:28 PM] eosgermany#0112
I participated in the RICK/MORTY perf test - during that 1h test no single swap has been executed.

[31-Oct-19 01:28 PM] TonyL#3577
yes, maker orders cancelling might help swaps to work @—ï‚ÑìŒπ–º

[31-Oct-19 01:28 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031

@ca333 if only taker order count,  no body want to be maker so all trade will not match except the one again official makers. hard to find makers in this orderbook of people trying to be takers

[31-Oct-19 01:34 PM] 27aume#8635
because people cancel as soon as they see cancel button meaning they are makers

[31-Oct-19 01:34 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
wtf the order book now

[31-Oct-19 01:34 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
1899 orders

@ca333 thank you... i think i give up... I want to help for this test. Maybe later...

[31-Oct-19 01:34 PM] criptobear#6402

[31-Oct-19 01:35 PM] tese#3502
Youre lucky

[31-Oct-19 01:35 PM] SVET5#3137
What happens if few ppl took the same trade (from the same marketmaker)? The first person will got matched, i suppose?

[31-Oct-19 01:35 PM] wookie#7663
So I cleared my orders. Accepted only 1 Rick well order and only 1 north sell order from the book. Waited for over 30 minutes tapping my screen to make sure it stays connected. And still nothing has gone through. I‚Äôm on iOS.

Issue logged already

[31-Oct-19 01:41 PM] ca333#0118 (pinned)
If an order doesn't match check its status after 20 - 30 seconds and cancel it - try to do one swap at a time. Once matched you can start another one.
