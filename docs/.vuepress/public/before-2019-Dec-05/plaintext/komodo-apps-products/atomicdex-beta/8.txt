In this video we can see two issues
First we can see that the conversion to USD is totally broken
Second, I just can't create an order for LTCRFOX. I've noticed this issues with some others currencies as well.

You tipped @nymkappa **9.9999 ARRR**
A network fee of 0.0001 ARRR was deducted from the amount.
This operation is pending. You will be notified when when it has finished.

I guess when we will have nSPV library made and that utilized in markermaker and with AtomicDEX mobile tor enabled atomic swaps will be even more quickest ü§î just thinking

@TonyL @Mylo is it ready to test a swap with BTC?

[16-Jul-19 06:23 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, swap with BTC should work

[16-Jul-19 06:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[16-Jul-19 06:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Which pairs should I test with BTC?

[16-Jul-19 06:24 AM] TonyL#3577
I've tried USDC and KMD

[16-Jul-19 06:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
BTC/ETH?

[16-Jul-19 06:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[16-Jul-19 06:26 AM] TonyL#3577

It is amazing. Sent tor enabled btc wallet funds to tor enabled atomicdex. And then would be able to trade those funds totally decentralized atomic swaps! Feeling very very :abusedsmily: right now

So do I make an ask by selling btc and buying kmd?

[16-Jul-19 06:32 AM] cipi#4502
selling BTC for KMD... for the above orderbook

[16-Jul-19 06:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Will do that

[16-Jul-19 06:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Don't have KMD access from mobile at all

[16-Jul-19 06:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If I for example make an order of 2000, and the bids says maxvolume 500 or 600 as showing in that JSON will that make the matching utxos and fill my order from seller side?

Alright! M ready for some BTC atomic swaps over tor

[16-Jul-19 06:39 AM] TonyL#3577
ouch, you need some more BTC

[16-Jul-19 06:39 AM] TonyL#3577
minimal amount from both sides is 0.0077 any coin

[16-Jul-19 06:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Hmmm ok

[16-Jul-19 06:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Glad I posted here before starting

[16-Jul-19 06:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Ok sent 0.03 to atomicdex wallet

[16-Jul-19 06:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Will wait for that to confirm

[16-Jul-19 06:41 AM] TonyL#3577
`If I for example make an order of 2000, and the bids says maxvolume 500 or 600 as showing in that JSON will that make the matching utxos and fill my order from seller side?` in general it should create `taker` request first, then if it match existing `maker` request it should partially fill it and part which left convert to `maker` request

[16-Jul-19 06:42 AM] TonyL#3577
```Buy and sell methods always create the taker order first. Therefore, you must pay an additional 1/777 fee of the trade amount during the swap when taking liquidity from the market. If your order is not matched in 30 seconds, the order is automatically converted to a maker request and stays on the orderbook until the request is matched or cancelled. To always act as a maker, please use the setprice method.```

[16-Jul-19 06:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Ok, will resume this test later

[16-Jul-19 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
seems a lot faster than any other tor based atomic swap

[16-Jul-19 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
in fact, it could very well be the first ever atomic swaps over tor, in the world

[16-Jul-19 07:25 AM] cipi#4502
the swap status would indicate exactly how much is needed
