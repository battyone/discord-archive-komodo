Hey there. VRSC disappeared from my list of activated coins.  And if I try to add it, it's not available to add. Did something happen to VRSC?

[10-Sep-19 11:48 PM] PTYX#6840
Hmm, I saw it but when I tried to add it it said not available. Maybe it's an spv issue

[10-Sep-19 11:52 PM] cipi#4502
SPV for VRSC in NA and EU are restarting because of this: https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx/issues/185
normally it takes a minute, but VRSC needs several hours, because of VRSC
one server is doing it since `0d 9h 22m 22s`... no idea how much longer it will take... maybe couple hours more

atomicdex uses his own code to talk to electrum servers

no third-party stuff involved

How do we get shipped with HTC exodus?

[11-Sep-19 10:06 AM] V__C#6587
I'm genuinely confused 👀 no-one seems to talk about this. Wouldn't it be a massive opportunity for marketing to work with them.
I don't know maybe HTC are too narrow minded and want to do it all themselves?!

Hi @TonyL, Is AtomicDEX only available on the US app store? Not showing on the Japanese one.

[11-Sep-19 12:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Hi @CrisF ! Hmm, I think it should be availiable worldwide. We'll check if there some additional filters/restrictions related to the Japan

[11-Sep-19 12:55 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, @TonyL . Android works no prob.  One guy couldn't find on app store. Will see if others have trouble. No other iPhone here atm.
