@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you can still read it if you want! Noone will stop you. I don't see your point

[18-Nov-19 09:34 PM] artik123#2884
And if you don't want noone can force you, not even today

[18-Nov-19 09:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You don't see the point in knowing if an app can take your money?

[18-Nov-19 09:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😕

[18-Nov-19 09:35 PM] artik123#2884
It's quite obvious

[18-Nov-19 09:35 PM] artik123#2884
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 it's a red herring

[18-Nov-19 09:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
non-read EULAs are not "quite obvious" and you'd be amazed at how much money companies could make by suing users that violated the EULA and agreed (by use) to pay for it

[18-Nov-19 09:37 PM] artik123#2884
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 it's anither red herring 😄

[18-Nov-19 09:37 PM] mrlynch#5735
there's no bloody herring if you read it

[18-Nov-19 09:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it's a red herring`
I feel like Indigo Montoya
that doesn't mean what you think it means

[18-Nov-19 09:37 PM] artik123#2884
The logic is quite obvious. Not EULA terms

[18-Nov-19 09:37 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you don't agree with it you either e-mail the company with your ammendments or not use the software

[18-Nov-19 09:39 PM] artik123#2884
I repeat. If the user don't want to read he won't read it in any case. If he does, he could read it in both cases. It's just a matter of default app behavior. For the benefit of 99% of the users

[18-Nov-19 09:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
this is your claim:
> I'm agreeing to certain legal terms by using this software and I think it's annoying to know what I'm legally agreeing to.

[18-Nov-19 09:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
we have now gone past the atomicdex eula scroll issue and entered into the realm of promoting laziness and irresponsibility

[18-Nov-19 09:40 PM] artik123#2884
This discussion is mddness in my opinion

[18-Nov-19 09:41 PM] artik123#2884
Lets agree to disagree

[18-Nov-19 09:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`This discussion is mddness in my opinion`
exactly what I said when I read that your complaint was that you had to scroll though what you were legally agreeing to 🤷🏽

[18-Nov-19 09:42 PM] artik123#2884
👌

[18-Nov-19 09:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
there's also a thing called reasonable effort just in case someone decides to sue atomicdex devs maybe.. if a user loses funds due to his/her own mistake (bad trade) one can argue reasonable measures have been taken to highlight to the user that trading is risky

[18-Nov-19 09:43 PM] artik123#2884
@mrlynch have you read what I wrote?

[18-Nov-19 09:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

yes, more personal insults when logic fails

[18-Nov-19 09:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a diagram showing how you don't want to know what you are legally agreeing to? not sure what that would even look like 🤔

I never agreed with the bitcoiners who wanted to do a kind of ATM/OTC between people to exchange fiat to BTC with unlimited amounts and without KYC. They are serious about this idea. Whatever I disagree with them, I like them and we talk frequently

[18-Nov-19 09:45 PM] artik123#2884

don't use bitcoin then

[18-Nov-19 09:45 PM] artik123#2884
It's very expainatory

[18-Nov-19 09:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
reasonable measures

[18-Nov-19 09:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`between people to exchange fiat to BTC with unlimited amounts and without KYC. `
some people need to just go read the Bitcoin whitepaper...

[18-Nov-19 09:46 PM] artik123#2884
If you're in the business of educating users then it's a different issue, not specifically related to AtomicDex

[18-Nov-19 09:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
why are you such a kyc lover anyway?

[18-Nov-19 09:46 PM] phm87#7395
CG: their original idea was to do everything without fiat ... but after more discussions, they aimed for a combo fiat/BTC (still a project)

[18-Nov-19 09:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fiat = KYC
learn it, accept it, or don't use it

[18-Nov-19 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`their original idea was to do everything without fiat ...`
that is exactly nowhere in the whitepaper (as off-topic as it may be)

[18-Nov-19 09:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
direct transfer of value neither implies or forbids the use of fiat

[18-Nov-19 09:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
also, as my final bit to your off-topic obsession:
BTC is not Bitcoin as described in the whitepaper (the current design cannot handle adoption)

[18-Nov-19 09:51 PM] Alright#0419
We should tell people there are easter eggs in the EULA, so they're more likely to read it 🤣

i'm sorry, but arguing and promoting irresponsibility for the sake of "90% of users don't read it anyway" is a bit more than a disagreement

Hi! Have a swap failed, trying to sell ltc/kmd as a taker, when i click the unlock funds button shows me "taker payment is not found, swap is no recoverable"

[19-Nov-19 06:18 AM] Oszy#5734
it means that you didn't pay the LTC / or it's already refunded,  so there's nothing to recover.

@polycryptoblog "courts favor finding a binding agreement where the user engages in affirmative conduct acknowledging the terms of a TOS. For instance, a genuine clickwrap agreement, in which a service provider places a TOS just adjacent to or below a click-button (or check-box), has been held to be sufficient"
