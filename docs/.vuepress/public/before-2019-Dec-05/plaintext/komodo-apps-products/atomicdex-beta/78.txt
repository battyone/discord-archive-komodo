It seems you can't open atomic dex and another wallet based on atomic dex eg. Rfox, one will be stuck on connecting.... @ca333

Hi - I have some questions about the masdex (mobile atomic swap dex) - How do coins/tokens get listed on the dex?

[10-Oct-19 01:29 PM] Crypto Rich#6241
I know that BTC protocol coins and ERC20 tokens can be exchanged on the masdex but what about NEO, TRX coins and tokens etc?

[10-Oct-19 04:36 PM] Acura#2748
Would be cool if i can add several Wallets/Portfolio to AtomicDex to choose from it

Just wanted to report on Android 9, I open AtomicDex and it goes to a black screen.

[10-Oct-19 11:54 PM] Markus#5464
@The1earl uninstall the app and reinstall it, dont forget to backup your seed before uninstalling if u dont have it saved

[11-Oct-19 12:01 AM] The1earl#0991
Ok

[11-Oct-19 12:17 AM] The1earl#0991

@Crypto Rich 
anybody can test if their coin works and submit a Pull Request to this repo to get added to the backend and the coin will be available for all GUIs <https://github.com/jl777/coins>
how-to:  <https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/README.md>

listing in atomicDEX mobile is a seperate process, one of the service providers like @PTYX or @siu - Chainmakers have to be contacted

@Trusty Do you have your seed phrase recorded somewhere?

[11-Oct-19 07:59 AM] Trusty#8181
Hi, @TonyL No

[11-Oct-19 08:07 AM] dudezmobi#1945
Install/update issue is back?

[11-Oct-19 08:07 AM] dudezmobi#1945
Same problem on my android

[11-Oct-19 08:07 AM] dudezmobi#1945
Black screen

[11-Oct-19 08:07 AM] Trusty#8181
I know I should have it but I can't find it.  I can't remember if I don't write it down or I don't know where it is.  I know it's my fault, I'd just like to know if it's still possible to recover it.

[11-Oct-19 08:09 AM] gcharang#6833
@dudezmobi if you have the seed phrase backed up, re install should fix it

@Trusty did you reinstall already, or the version with black screen still on your phone?

[11-Oct-19 08:15 AM] Trusty#8181
still in my phone, I can't reintall because I have no seed

[11-Oct-19 08:19 AM] gcharang#6833
@Trusty let me find out if it is possible
will ping you once I know something

Is it secure to open AtomicDex with verus seed?

[11-Oct-19 08:59 AM] wl#4107
For convenience sake it's much better to claim rewards on mobile phone

[11-Oct-19 09:06 AM] TonyL#3577

[11-Oct-19 09:08 AM] wl#4107

I downloaded the Exodus wallet for Android and their ux is absolutely simple, functional and beautiful... You could take some guidelines from them (i'd like the power of atomic swaps with some easy to use beautiful design)...

[11-Oct-19 09:56 AM] Oszy#5734
I am sure there will be UI/UX improvements once the backend is fully functional

how is this atomic dex compared to mcafees on a technical level?

[11-Oct-19 07:04 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
firstly, its not constrained by being ERC20

[11-Oct-19 07:04 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it's also built on open source backend so anyone can create a gui/tui or swap supported coins in CLI

Exodus looks good, and is very simple to use. I'm not a fan of their in wallet exchange (somewhat expensive). Also, Exodus has been around for a long time time, AtomicDEX will come around.

[12-Oct-19 07:12 AM] GuilouGuilouOTE#1930
Hi everyone,
How can I show you a screenshot of a display error (in the display of the amount of coin in the DEX/Exchange section)  that I have on my phone since the first versions of AtomicDEX ?
I would like to know if this is something you know of or if you need more informations from me
It seems I have not the rights to add a screenshot here
Thanks

[12-Oct-19 08:27 AM] Oszy#5734
you can upload it to a site like imgur.com and link the uploaded image here

[12-Oct-19 09:31 AM] ca333#0118
@GuilouGuilouOTE can you please share your logs with us and provide additional informations such as app-language, operating system and version, app-version (from settings page), screenshot of the error (uploaded as @Oszy adviced). This will be very helpful - thanks!

Any new projects moving / building on KMD, Or any exchanges / wallet providers integrating the DEX technology ?

@BobZilla Please backup your seed phrase, uninstall the application, and re-install from the app store

[12-Oct-19 09:48 PM] Oszy#5734
this will solve the black screen issue

[12-Oct-19 09:50 PM] BobZilla#8096
Hello I have black screen issue after recent update,, sorry if it has been discussed already I just joined here

[12-Oct-19 09:51 PM] Oszy#5734
see above please üôÇ

[12-Oct-19 09:51 PM] Oszy#5734
a simple re-install should fix your issue, make sure you have your seed backed up, you will need to re-enter it during setup

[12-Oct-19 09:52 PM] BobZilla#8096
I will try an install,, sorry I am trying to find where it is discussed but a lot going on,, asking for logs and such but in my case it's ot running so that would not be possible

[12-Oct-19 09:54 PM] Oszy#5734
the automatic update process creates this "black screen" bug, always do a clean install when you can

[12-Oct-19 09:56 PM] BobZilla#8096
OK I will go install fresh and I'm sure it will fix it since you guys are aware of it,, and I will keep that in mind for next time.. Thanks for your help

[12-Oct-19 09:57 PM] TonyL#3577
App update should work fine without uninstalling on the next update (v. 0.2.2)

[12-Oct-19 09:58 PM] BobZilla#8096
No worries,, I will let it try but if I have a problem I know what to do now. I was going to try a re-instal anyway but I wanted to reach out to this community before I mucked things up further.

@Oszy Thats strange, version from like a 0.1.6 till 0.2.1 updated fine on my side and nobody reported about update problems for a long time (before this black screen issue happened). Feel free to report if you notice any glitches on update

[12-Oct-19 10:20 PM] BobZilla#8096
I never had a problem until this latest update,, I have not been using it from the start but I think it has updated a few times previously.

[13-Oct-19 09:50 AM] criptobear#6402
I have it updated automatically and last two times it did it went black I have Android

[13-Oct-19 09:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
uninstall, reboot, install - should work

[13-Oct-19 09:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
do you have seed saved?

[13-Oct-19 10:21 AM] Markus#5464

Is NIX ghost protocol integrated in this beta?

[13-Oct-19 05:43 PM] PTYX#6840
No, the NIX ghost protocol is something separate and it won't be implemented into the atomicdex directly

How is that possible? First the amount is debited to me, then there is a timeout and the amount remains disappeared.

[15-Oct-19 08:23 AM] gcharang#6833
@Seko can you track the vrsc on an explorer? if they are in an address starting with "b", they should come back to you after 4 hours automatically(app should be active) or you will see a button that says "Recover funds" on the order

[15-Oct-19 08:24 AM] Seko#7408
Yes, the address starting with b...

Some suggestions: 1) push or email when an order is executed / cancelled. 2) Canceled orders in the history 3) possibility to set a threshold to automatically claim KMD reward

[15-Oct-19 08:50 AM] ca333#0118
Thanks for the suggestions - push-notifications are certainly coming in the near future @cyrelb - 3) too - as for 2) not sure if that makes sense since cancelled orders didn't execute any swap/blockchain logic - it might also fill your history with irrelevant data.
