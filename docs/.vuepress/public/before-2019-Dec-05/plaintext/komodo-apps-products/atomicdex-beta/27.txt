As I can see from log you have connectivity issues with ETH nodes hmm

[20-Jul-19 12:30 PM] ca333#0118
there was a tx history loading issue fixed in the new version - rolling out shortly

[20-Jul-19 12:30 PM] TonyL#3577
oh, ok

[20-Jul-19 12:30 PM] ca333#0118
it could be related

[20-Jul-19 12:30 PM] Simon#6247
My guess, this is because I logged out and logged back in, before that, ETH wallet was still syncing TX's

[20-Jul-19 12:30 PM] TonyL#3577
just afraid that on reinstall information about swap will be wiped

[20-Jul-19 12:30 PM] TonyL#3577
so it'll not kick-off

[20-Jul-19 01:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Can you try to connect phone to other network, and then restart app?

[20-Jul-19 01:02 PM] Simon#6247
my phone is on 4G, so connect to internet? Then restart? (internet here is rather bad though)

[20-Jul-19 01:03 PM] TonyL#3577
if it's on 4G - try to connect to home wifi for example

[20-Jul-19 01:03 PM] Simon#6247
Ok I'll try

FYI, Eth still syncing (500k tx's left)

[20-Jul-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
native ETH?

[20-Jul-19 01:11 PM] Slyris#2880
Hello

[20-Jul-19 01:11 PM] Simon#6247
Just the ETH asset on mobile app (iOS, iphone SE)

[20-Jul-19 01:16 PM] jeezy#3408
Link to apk anywhere?

[20-Jul-19 01:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, now mm2 just saying that ETH not activated without connection error to ETH node. Maybe it's really related to this tx loading issue which will be fixed in next release

[20-Jul-19 01:19 PM] TonyL#3577
@jeezy did you register for beta-testing? anyway - please DM me your playmarket email if you want to test on Android or appleid email if on iOS

[20-Jul-19 01:21 PM] Simon#6247
@TonyL Ok, I'll send logs once more when TX's are fully synced. Any ETA on next ios release?

[20-Jul-19 01:24 PM] TonyL#3577
ETA for iOS next release is next week begining (Apple review  taking some time)

[20-Jul-19 01:24 PM] TonyL#3577

@Simon in your latest log last message is that you're sending maker payment (so coins activated fine this time):
```mm2] 20 13:07:21, lp_swap:1064] Sending 'maker-payment@5b263dfe-c541-4df9-ad37-59e772770d9b' (243 bytes, crc 2175127580)```
please wait with connection in same network, maybe it's really will be sent after full tx history loading

Have forwarded devolper Documentation to GuardaWallet about the AtomicDex Wallet.
There reply first was:
We would love to add some dex trading on our wallet, however we don’t see a lot of demand and adoption for that. If there were, we would move into it immediately

[20-Jul-19 02:09 PM] Simon#6247
Ok so ETH fully synced and guess what

@TonyL another thing I noticed is when we hover on the dex tab it goes smoothly between trade orders an history, but when we actually click on the trade orders and history tabs a translucent square shows, it's a minor thing but...
