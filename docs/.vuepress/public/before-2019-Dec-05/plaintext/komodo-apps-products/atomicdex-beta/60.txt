[10-Sep-19 10:38 AM] kmd.dex#8716
i am also an old tester of barterdex:P

[10-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Oszy#5734
it'll get sorted sooner or later, there are so many phones that's why it went public beta now, to catch these problems.

[10-Sep-19 10:43 AM] kmd.dex#8716
I install and reinstall the app..get the seed set the pass but nada

[10-Sep-19 10:43 AM] kmd.dex#8716

[10-Sep-19 10:44 AM] Oszy#5734
are you on wifi or 4g?

[10-Sep-19 10:44 AM] kmd.dex#8716
wifi

[10-Sep-19 10:44 AM] Oszy#5734
can you try 4g?

[10-Sep-19 10:44 AM] Oszy#5734
what did work for me when I had this, as soon as I started the app I tabbed out and back a few times, and it kind of kickstarted it.

[10-Sep-19 10:45 AM] Oszy#5734
had to start a few thimes tho

[10-Sep-19 10:45 AM] kmd.dex#8716

[10-Sep-19 10:46 AM] kmd.dex#8716

[10-Sep-19 10:48 AM] kmd.dex#8716
@Oszy what shappen with komodo priate addresses?    i know in winter 2019 they abandon that..

[10-Sep-19 10:48 AM] kmd.dex#8716
that s why i dont care about kmodo üòõ i was kinda angry

[10-Sep-19 10:49 AM] Oszy#5734
what do you mean? nothing is abandoned, there was a migration  to sapling, and even if you missed that you had time till June 2019 to claim your Pirate from an old address

[10-Sep-19 10:50 AM] Oszy#5734
also it's 2 different chains and coins

[10-Sep-19 10:50 AM] kmd.dex#8716
i cash out all my kmd in winter

[10-Sep-19 10:50 AM] kmd.dex#8716
so how is call  the kmodo private chain ?  coin

[10-Sep-19 10:51 AM] Oszy#5734
There is no such thing, Pirate is not Komodo, it's built on komodo.

[10-Sep-19 10:51 AM] Oszy#5734
but let's keep this channel for AtomicDEX

[10-Sep-19 10:52 AM] kmd.dex#8716
so kmodo dont have  shilled transaction anymore?

[10-Sep-19 10:52 AM] Oszy#5734
no

[10-Sep-19 10:52 AM] vogelfreund88#4534
@Oszy for sure I can import my seed in an other wallet!
That was not the point!
I wanted to tell you guys it isn‚Äôt working for me in the newest version.

[10-Sep-19 10:52 AM] kmd.dex#8716
ok

[10-Sep-19 10:52 AM] Oszy#5734
@vogelfreund88  and you still haven't answered my question so i can't help

[10-Sep-19 10:53 AM] Oszy#5734
you need to tell us more about how what is happening / not happeing, what do you see when you try it, in order to replicate and fix your issue

[10-Sep-19 10:53 AM] Oszy#5734
just by saying it's not working we can't figure out what is wrong

[10-Sep-19 10:57 AM] vogelfreund88#4534
It says error, please try again later!
Calm down...mate!

[10-Sep-19 10:58 AM] vogelfreund88#4534
Was a pleasure to help...

[10-Sep-19 10:58 AM] Oszy#5734
I am calm üòÑ

[10-Sep-19 11:00 AM] Oszy#5734
What is wrong with you man

[10-Sep-19 11:00 AM] vogelfreund88#4534
Nothing I‚Äôm ok, only want to help

[10-Sep-19 11:03 AM] vogelfreund88#4534
Maybe I don‚Äôt like the way you talk with the people that invest time to find bugs and tell it to the community...

hmmm try to reinstall the app. happened to me on my lower end samsung duos

[10-Sep-19 11:12 AM] Oszy#5734
@vogelfreund88  I think you misunderstood me big time, I talked to you politely and you didn't answer my question 3 times, and then you started to take it out on me for no reason.
But it's okay, we don't need to talk, anyone would have ask you the same question that's a 100%.

Previous version registration and new wallet creation is fast. Latest version is relatively and exponentially slower.

[10-Sep-19 01:18 PM] Seko#7408
What is the difference to atomicwallet.io? Use they Komodo's API?

[10-Sep-19 01:19 PM] Seko#7408
Ah, I think they use Shapeshift...

[10-Sep-19 01:41 PM] kmd.dex#8716
no they don't

[10-Sep-19 01:42 PM] kmd.dex#8716
shapeshift is an exchange  atomicdex is a peer2peer  exchange
