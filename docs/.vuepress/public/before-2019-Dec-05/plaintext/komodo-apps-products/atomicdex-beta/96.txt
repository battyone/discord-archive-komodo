network is intentionally being overloaded with this stress test to get information how it acts.

[31-Oct-19 01:44 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590

[31-Oct-19 01:47 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Try disabling morty:

[31-Oct-19 01:47 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Then add it again

[31-Oct-19 01:47 PM] Dirty Moe#2091

[31-Oct-19 01:47 PM] Dirty Moe#2091

@Patrick Friggens it is atomic, after all

[31-Oct-19 01:48 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
my balance is disappearing but no swap success

[31-Oct-19 01:48 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Its in atomica purgatory

[31-Oct-19 01:48 PM] Vanncoins#3044
at this rate if anyone manages to get lucky enough to have a Rick/Morty swap go through, they’ll probably win the entire prize pool lol

[31-Oct-19 01:48 PM] dudezmobi#1945
It will reappear when ita ready lol

[31-Oct-19 01:48 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
disabling and closing the app seemed to work

[31-Oct-19 01:49 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Wohoho yeah

[31-Oct-19 01:49 PM] dudezmobi#1945

[31-Oct-19 01:49 PM] ѕℓιм#1031

[31-Oct-19 01:51 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
More capacity when? How long are we running this with minimum setup? @ca333

[31-Oct-19 01:52 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Jaki you need to uninstall old version before installing

[31-Oct-19 01:52 PM] ŁATOSHI#7990
@Jaki reinstall (uninstall the app and reinstall
