restarted phone, same issue. hit `logout`

[04-Jun-19 01:20 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
opened app again, back to `create / restore` page

[04-Jun-19 01:21 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe issue with custom seed?

[04-Jun-19 01:27 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Same issue with restore with previous 12 word test seed

`feaure request` - add a `fund your wallet first, idiot` message.

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Im working on save in DB restored wallet, and it's already on master coming for next release.

[04-Jun-19 01:41 PM] Kiruel#2091
For now its not stored.

[04-Jun-19 01:42 PM] Kiruel#2091
For the `Sell` popup without coin its becuase you don't have anycoin with balance > 0. I will make a another popup to inform the user.

2 swaps completed flawlessly

[04-Jun-19 04:50 PM] ncjgkr#9875
The exchange rate is hard coded. I guess this is due to the beta.

[04-Jun-19 04:58 PM] Mylo#8306
yes.   try 2 or 3 at a time just for giggles.

[04-Jun-19 04:59 PM] Mylo#8306
"for giggles" is a term of "for fun".  test it out.

[04-Jun-19 05:00 PM] TonyL#3577
`The exchange rate is hard coded. I guess this is due to the beta.` actually it's not hardcoded - just orders with same price placed my maker node

[04-Jun-19 05:01 PM] TonyL#3577
And since there are no any other makers yet it's constant üòÉ

[04-Jun-19 05:14 PM] Alright#0419
so... super nitpicky, but I think it should clear the pin when you type it in wrong instead of having the hit backspace to type it again

[04-Jun-19 05:26 PM] Alright#0419
also it's not immediately obvious what that red button does while entering pin. Could see some frustration there if you accidentally press it while you don't have your seed on hand

[04-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Alright#0419
found a way to reliably create stuck swaps. 
start a swap
turn the phone off
wait a minute, so swap is at 2/3
turn phone back on 
hit red button that clears seed
restore the wallet 
swap will be stuck at 2/3 with seemingly no way to recover the funds sent

Would be great to have a confirmation button to leave the app. Because if we press back button, we can leave the app during a swap. Sometimes it's involuntary.

[05-Jun-19 09:24 AM] Kiruel#2091
@t0sma if you leave the app during a swap and not closing the app the swap will be ok.

[05-Jun-19 10:22 AM] Kiruel#2091
@Alright if you logout your swap will be not successful. I need to inform the user when he try to logout or delete wallet. (If swap is ongoing). Anyway your fund will be restore after few hours if swap did not finish.

[05-Jun-19 12:30 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Can we add option to stop phone from going into standby during swap? (like GPS, screen stays on)

using pin change feature in settings, all works fine, but after change returns user to "unlock wallet" page. After unlocking wallet, I'm back at enter pin, then enter/confirm new pin. so I change pin 2x because I didnt realise unlock screen was going back there. 
Not a bug, just could be confusing. request returning to a different screen (not unlock wallet, maybe main settings screen instead) after pin change.
