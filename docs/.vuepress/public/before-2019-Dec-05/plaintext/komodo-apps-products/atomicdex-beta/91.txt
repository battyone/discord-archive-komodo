Quick, hire more monkeys!

[31-Oct-19 12:24 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
so is it a bad idea to have a significant amount of orders?

[31-Oct-19 12:24 PM] Hooftly#1337
thats the point if a stress test üòÑ

[31-Oct-19 12:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it is possible script spammers are trying to connect to all orders preventing you to connect, it will level out

[31-Oct-19 12:24 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Juat go. Its  stress test afterall

[31-Oct-19 12:24 PM] amol#3287
Dex app not opening.. Black screen appears

[31-Oct-19 12:25 PM] duskonaut#1244
not working here

[31-Oct-19 12:25 PM] farl#9964
I feel so stressed ü§Ø

[31-Oct-19 12:25 PM] Oszy#5734
I am out put up maker for you guys, imposibble to scroll with 700 orders in the book üòÑ

[31-Oct-19 12:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@amol remove app and reinstall

[31-Oct-19 12:25 PM] dudezmobi#1945
@amol  uninstall and install.app

[31-Oct-19 12:25 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Why use it the first time juat now... lol

[31-Oct-19 12:25 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Dirty Moe the number of simultaneous swaps you can do it limiterd by the number of utxcos in your wallet. So creating too many all at once is kind of pointless and will likely lead to some fails

[31-Oct-19 12:26 PM] vanity33#9778
not even one swap so far

[31-Oct-19 12:26 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Like getting to war unprepped

[31-Oct-19 12:26 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Just go with all the patterns

[31-Oct-19 12:26 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Objective is to stress test

[31-Oct-19 12:27 PM] costa2439#3771
atomicdex doesn't seem to work well, but the discord endures

[31-Oct-19 12:27 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
thanks for the reply @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator , how many utxcos are in the wallet?

[31-Oct-19 12:27 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@Dirty Moe If you've just got funds from faucet - single one.

[31-Oct-19 12:27 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if you recieved all your funds in one transaction, one.

[31-Oct-19 12:27 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
oh

[31-Oct-19 12:27 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
well i clicked on the faucet

[31-Oct-19 12:27 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
A LOT

[31-Oct-19 12:28 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you can make more utxos by sending yourself part of your funds

[31-Oct-19 12:28 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
i have 16k of each üôÉ

[31-Oct-19 12:28 PM] farl#9964
16

[31-Oct-19 12:28 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but then your utxos might be too small, and will recombine on next trade

[31-Oct-19 12:28 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
oh thats right! i remember how it works now,

[31-Oct-19 12:29 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
personally I think having more than 3 open orders on a single trade pair is a bit silly

[31-Oct-19 12:29 PM] dudezmobi#1945
In the real.world.you wont use dex like that @Dirty Moe

[31-Oct-19 12:29 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Yeah

[31-Oct-19 12:29 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
but if im making small trades they should be fine right because each utxo is 7.7 right?

[31-Oct-19 12:29 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
i was trading earlier today and it seemed to be working

[31-Oct-19 12:29 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, as long as the person on the other side of your trade has available utxos

[31-Oct-19 12:29 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
sorry if i am painful, im a bit of a noob with this stuff

[31-Oct-19 12:29 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
ok cool

[31-Oct-19 12:30 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
no probs, always a good time to learn

[31-Oct-19 12:30 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
so in theory i could have a big order book as i have a lot of utxos?

[31-Oct-19 12:31 PM] 27aume#8635
Not sure why but nothing pass on my end

[31-Oct-19 12:31 PM] vanity33#9778
mine also

[31-Oct-19 12:32 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
0 successful trade so far

[31-Oct-19 12:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
gonna try some kmd swapsssss

[31-Oct-19 12:32 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
in theory, but reality != theory. I wouldnt make 1 order per utxo. remember there are steps to the swap including fee transaction etc. So better to not spam too hard if you dont want to fail or wait for confirmations to the point it timesout

[31-Oct-19 12:32 PM] 27aume#8635
It not even matching

[31-Oct-19 12:33 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
there is also an upper limit on transactions per block, though I dont think we're quiete there yet

[31-Oct-19 12:33 PM] RNI#2666
not working at all for me.. tried 20+ trades

[31-Oct-19 12:33 PM] 27aume#8635
Ye but atkmicdex does have utxo handler

[31-Oct-19 12:33 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
Not working for me as well, did a bunch yesterday

[31-Oct-19 12:33 PM] coingirl87#6489
After 30 minutes no swap started

[31-Oct-19 12:33 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
thanks @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator üôÇ

[31-Oct-19 12:34 PM] kastmada#2688

[31-Oct-19 12:34 PM] vanity33#9778
order matching 0/3 conctantly

[31-Oct-19 12:34 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Just go on stress testing

[31-Oct-19 12:35 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Succesful and failed swap.should be considered .lol

[31-Oct-19 12:35 PM] farl#9964
Also save feedback in a seperate file and post it after the stresstest to the team.

[31-Oct-19 12:35 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Yeah

[31-Oct-19 12:35 PM] dudezmobi#1945
I have 3 tickets so far

[31-Oct-19 12:35 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've been informed I may be mistaken about utxos ü§î

[31-Oct-19 12:35 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Pending for issuace hehe

[31-Oct-19 12:36 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Thats barterdex days

[31-Oct-19 12:36 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
haha, dont worry im still trying to figure it all out!

[31-Oct-19 12:37 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
barterdex needed a bunch of specifically (or close to) sized utxos

[31-Oct-19 12:37 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
i do remember that and i found it difficult to use when we had the test with pizza

[31-Oct-19 12:37 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
this doesnt, though I still think if you are waiting for unspent to return it will take longer and you may timeout. could be wrong though, the devs are pretty magic.

[31-Oct-19 12:38 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
my faucet deposits from over an hour ago haven't confirmed. Chains backlogged?

[31-Oct-19 12:39 PM] Hooftly#1337

[31-Oct-19 12:39 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590

[31-Oct-19 12:41 PM] dudezmobi#1945
The more errors and frustration we exposed. The better qtomicdex gets

[31-Oct-19 12:41 PM] dudezmobi#1945
So just test and test

[31-Oct-19 12:41 PM] Mark81#4505

Eth, rvn, vrsc, kmd trades not working as well

[31-Oct-19 12:42 PM] Mark81#4505
so leader has only 3 atomic swaps done

[31-Oct-19 12:42 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've been told there is some voodoo with Electrum which allows less wait time for unconfirmed utxos to be made avaible for spend. Might be the electrums are a little warm at the moment with the flood tho üòÑ

[31-Oct-19 12:42 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
i had 38.885 of Rick & Morty each. deleted app, reinstalled. now balance shows 38.885 Morty and only 7.777 Rick

[31-Oct-19 12:43 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
damn my address isnt on there! i had a succesful trade on the hour!
