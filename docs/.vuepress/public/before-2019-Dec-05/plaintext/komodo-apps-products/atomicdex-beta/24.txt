[19-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Slyris#2880
@ca333 There is the possibility inside the app to see the version of the app that we are running ?

[19-Jul-19 09:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I'm tracking this channel all the time when with PC üëç

[19-Jul-19 09:30 AM] Slyris#2880
For example the build number or the version

[19-Jul-19 09:30 AM] TonyL#3577
@Slyris it's possible to see in settings menu on the bottom

[19-Jul-19 09:30 AM] TonyL#3577
In new release will be also possible to see which mm2 version bundled

[19-Jul-19 09:30 AM] Slyris#2880
i dont have this information in my version at the bottom of settings menu

Ouch, so both will be displayed in new release

[19-Jul-19 09:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Have new one on my phone already üòÉ

[19-Jul-19 09:32 AM] Slyris#2880
It's for reporting an issue, so i can specify the version i'm running

[19-Jul-19 09:33 AM] TonyL#3577
For now you can check app version in your phone applications management menu - in next release it will be visible on the bottom of settings menu

[19-Jul-19 09:33 AM] Slyris#2880
0.1.3 i see

@Slyris thats a local issue on your end

[19-Jul-19 09:35 AM] ca333#0118
delete your app (clean)

[19-Jul-19 09:35 AM] ca333#0118
and reinstall the latest versoin

[19-Jul-19 09:35 AM] ca333#0118
afterwards check settings page again

[19-Jul-19 09:35 AM] Slyris#2880
Will do that now.

[19-Jul-19 09:40 AM] Slyris#2880
When you uninstall the application. The history of your transactions disappears logically. That's why I think that the export of data is super important or even the possibility of link a google drive for example to record in pdf format our transactions.

[19-Jul-19 09:41 AM] Slyris#2880
The user could configure his application so that every month the history of his transactions is automatically exported to his drive in a secure way.

[19-Jul-19 09:42 AM] TonyL#3577
@Simon is only password hint place you noticed so far where text doens't fit on IphoneSE?

[19-Jul-19 09:43 AM] ca333#0118
TX export coming soon @Slyris - we have this already noted in the 'future features' - even for specific timeframes, etc.

[19-Jul-19 09:43 AM] ca333#0118
For swaps we will think about a method to persist trades (unless a user wants to delete them) too.

[19-Jul-19 09:43 AM] Slyris#2880
It's super cool, that's really something that customers are looking for. @ca333

it means that if you trade 1 ETH by this rate (1 KMD = 0.005 ETH) you'll get 43000 USD of value for 1 ETH

[19-Jul-19 09:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
rates are set by LP, a 5% diff should be assumed

[19-Jul-19 09:47 AM] TonyL#3577
but unlikely someone will want to trade such volume with such rate

[19-Jul-19 09:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
someone being opportunistic?

[19-Jul-19 09:47 AM] ca333#0118
@Simon thats the specific "trade rate" like Tony pointed out.

[19-Jul-19 09:47 AM] ca333#0118
I would like to sell 1 ETH for that amount of KMD though if you re interested @Simon

[19-Jul-19 09:48 AM] ca333#0118
ok seems no orders up - i will put one up for you for demonstration purposes

[19-Jul-19 09:48 AM] Simon#6247
I have put some orders up, for all these

[19-Jul-19 09:48 AM] ca333#0118
please note that you need ETH balance in order to trade with ETH (sell AND buy side)

[19-Jul-19 09:48 AM] Slyris#2880
It is not yet possible to see all the order books and their contents as a stock market view (binance like) no?

[19-Jul-19 09:49 AM] Simon#6247
I have 0.5 ETH

[19-Jul-19 09:49 AM] ca333#0118
not yet @Slyris - but similar feature coming

[19-Jul-19 09:49 AM] ca333#0118
a) to see all orders and b) to create manual orders regardsless of already existing orders

[19-Jul-19 09:49 AM] Slyris#2880
It is true that without this feature, it is difficult enough to trade and easier to make mistakes @ca333

[19-Jul-19 09:50 AM] Slyris#2880
But hey if it can allow you to have 43000 dollars ... ahah üòÑ

"it means that if you trade 1 ETH by this rate (1 KMD = 0.005 ETH) you'll get 43000 USD of value for 1 ETH" real value should be 200 dollars though

[19-Jul-19 09:57 AM] Simon#6247
Not 43000

[19-Jul-19 09:58 AM] Simon#6247
I mean 200 KMD which is like 240 dollar or something

[19-Jul-19 10:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, yes - thats fair point üòÉ So looks like a visual price displaying bug in cases when there is no orders for market and you create new one. Let me create an issue

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #32 exchange rate in USD displaying not correct when creating maker order
On screenshot: input for trade 0.05 ETH for 10 KMD

What means 1 KMD = 0.005 ETH rate, or 1 ETH = 200 KMD

In USD equivalent should be ~242$ (with KMD by 1.21$). So it seems this USD amount calculating not correct.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #30: \[Feature request\]: Ability to export its history in pdf for the taxation and the justifications of our transactions
For now the history of swaps is only local. So if you change a device etc.. you will not have the swap history. So for now it's not possible to do this.

[19-Jul-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
seems that exporting only local history is sufficient @Kiruel 
most people will just use one phone and if they need to get all their history, they would just need to export from each phone used. we dont want to get into aggregating histories from multiple devices

[19-Jul-19 01:51 PM] Kiruel#2091
Do you think it's possible to get all history swaps from a public key ? (in the future i mean)

[19-Jul-19 01:52 PM] Kiruel#2091
Exporting in local it's simple, but i think something more accurate.

[19-Jul-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be accurate enough as long as people dont delete things

[19-Jul-19 01:52 PM] Slyris#2880
You can propose and export in a JSON format that is linked to a drive and when you restore you use the JSON information

[19-Jul-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe if there is some centralized stats website, it could figure out all the swaps, but that will be very tricky
