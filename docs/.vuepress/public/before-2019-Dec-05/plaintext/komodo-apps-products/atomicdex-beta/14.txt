suggestion on the biometric/PIN, maybe a good idea to confirm an actual trade as well with this security and not only the login ?

[17-Jul-19 01:31 PM] SHossain#0007
nice suggestion. can you add that to our github issues page as suggestion?

How can I remove coin or assets from the list that I added previously?

[17-Jul-19 01:39 PM] Tony Stark#4609
@ca333 upon first run, when I enabled all coins, ETH sync was very slow and eventually died, I had to add all coins one by one ( at first, I marked everything and tried to add all in go)
Actually, I guess ETH sync got somehow stuck, but can't prove this...

[17-Jul-19 01:40 PM] SHossain#0007
@goldenman currently, you need to delete wallet from settings and re-login/setup

@ca333 complementing @Malti earlier comment about autodeleting a wrong PIN it would be a MUST HAVE feature to self destroy the wallet in case the PIN is entered incorrectly X times (say, 10 times).
Also, add a growing time gap each time the PIN is entered incorrectly
(Just like Android and iOS lock screen behavior)

@antropov083 what is your internet speed? 3g/4g/wifi? are you using VPN?

[17-Jul-19 01:44 PM] Tony Stark#4609
@SHossain @ca333 this google play  " clear the cache" stuff seems to be widespread, it might be good to pin a message about it!

[17-Jul-19 01:44 PM] ca333#0118
@Vanncoins on android no. On iOS it wont immeditely fail but it wont execute (finish) the swap if the app isn't kept open. So if you keep it closed too long the swap will eventually timeout (fail).

[17-Jul-19 01:44 PM] antropov083#9529

try restarting your phone completely and if swap fails, DM me the logs

[17-Jul-19 01:47 PM] SHossain#0007
sometimes some IPs are blocked in Russia

[17-Jul-19 01:48 PM] SHossain#0007
also, if you have VPN, you can try with that

got to go out now. see you guys soon

[17-Jul-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but with half the trades expected to be on KMD, and likely majority of trades will have nSPV support

[17-Jul-19 02:07 PM] Tony Stark#4609
@jl777c why do it take so long syncing coins when we open the app or add a new coin to the list?

[17-Jul-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
low bandwidth

[17-Jul-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is better to only start with a few coins active and manually add them, but then people will complain they have to manually add

[17-Jul-19 02:07 PM] Tony Stark#4609
Low bandwidth on my end or yours?

[17-Jul-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810

Can we please add the ability to organize the order in which the coins appear on the portfolio page? Perhaps something like a tap+hold+drag?

[17-Jul-19 02:16 PM] yorklab#7270
Cleared cache and restarted Android phone but Morty transactions still do not come up, I get the spinning circle. While the circle is spinning I can still send and receive but no transactions will show. After trying to access Morty transactions, then the other coin's transactions will not come up. At work now so can't continue playing with it, we'll try again later.
