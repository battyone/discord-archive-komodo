And every swap between KMD and HUSH fails. And sometimes the swap is not even started, instead an order is created.

[01-Oct-19 05:45 AM] Seko#7408
And sometimes HUSH and other coins cannot be activated at all. Since the new version I have this problem.

[01-Oct-19 06:07 AM] Acura#2748
My kmd to Hush trade fails also.
0/3 confirmations - takes too long.

[01-Oct-19 07:33 AM] Oszy#5734
@Seko is it with 0.2.0? I had that connecting and activating issue with 0.1.9 only.

[01-Oct-19 07:38 AM] Oszy#5734
Can confirm HUSH swaps are not starting at all as of now

[01-Oct-19 07:40 AM] Oszy#5734
Hangs at order matching

[01-Oct-19 08:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I just did KMD -> HUSH and HUSH -> VRSC on 2.0 with S10e

[01-Oct-19 08:21 AM] Seko#7408
Yes @Oszy

[01-Oct-19 08:23 AM] Seko#7408
I have the problem only with 0.2.0, not with 0.1.9

[01-Oct-19 08:26 AM] Oszy#5734
@Seko still might be the ISP issues, WiFi or 4G? @gcharang can you see about this?

[01-Oct-19 08:27 AM] Oszy#5734
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator I did one now too, seems like maker issues for the rest.

[01-Oct-19 08:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Cant be certain, but I suspect that there could be situations where makerbots update order prices, but taker's orderbook has not yet been updated resulting in an attempt to match with an order which has since been cancelled by the maker. If so, the more frequently a makerbot updates prices, the more often this could happen.

[01-Oct-19 08:40 AM] Seko#7408
No, I have the problem on two WiFi networks, over LTE too. With VPN and without. @Oszy

[01-Oct-19 09:02 AM] miles#6381
Hi everyone, just got my hands on 0.20 for iOS and looks good for me so far, anyone got any good background on the new AtomicWallet coin?

[01-Oct-19 09:05 AM] Seko#7408
Since a few hours I also can't activate the coins manually anymore. Normally the coins are there automatically, but now I have to add them manually and it doesn't work here either.

[01-Oct-19 09:11 AM] Seko#7408
I'll try a reinstallation.

[01-Oct-19 09:13 AM] Seko#7408
But the same problem. The Coins cannot activated...

[01-Oct-19 09:17 AM] Seko#7408
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And every time I log in again, I have to add the coins manually. Nobody else with this problem?

[01-Oct-19 09:32 AM] ca333#0118
@Seko thank you for the informations - we are investigating your reported issue - please try again with only a few coins active - i.e. launch the app and only activate 2-3 coins and see what happens. We are aware of this issue - seems an iOS limitation on concurrent (network) threads or similar where if you activate all/many coins that it will lead to DEX unresponsiveness. We will isolate and fix this shortly.

[01-Oct-19 09:38 AM] Seko#7408
Yeah, with a few coins, it seems to work. But as soon as it becomes more, it becomes an issue. Maybe a certain coin is also responsible for it?
Here is an overview of the coins I want to add: KMD, BTC, LTC, VRSC, HUSH, Chainzilla, USDC and ETH.

[01-Oct-19 10:19 AM] Acura#2748
@miles i only know that atomicwallet coin have nothing to do with komodo or AtomicDex

[01-Oct-19 10:29 AM] Oszy#5734
@Seko what if you deactivate all coins and add them just one by one?

[01-Oct-19 10:36 AM] TonyL#3577
@Seko Could you please try on your side with all UTXO/Smart-chain coins activated but without any ETH/ERC-20 ?

[01-Oct-19 10:49 AM] Seko#7408
@TonyL I'll watch this now and report back later.

[01-Oct-19 10:50 AM] Seko#7408
It's working right now. I try it several times today. All Utxo Coins are activated now...

there is a minimum confirmation before we can unlock funds but it does not make sense to the user (a display of numeric value and an error message "Too Early to unlock funds, wait until #######") it would be better if it is an estimated date or time

With CoinExchange closing, it's imperative for us to have wallet offerings for BTCH holders, would it be possible to have BTCH added on AtomicDEX before December 1st?

electrum needs to be update if not done already

@QQ It's a beta. And we test it. And there are still improvements. AtomicDEX is not yet widely promoted. We are allowed to test here exclusively. And we still need a little patience. Everyone can speed up the process by getting involved.

[02-Oct-19 08:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Looking forward to the stress test, too. The BartedDEX test was where I first found Komodo.  Spent 40 hours that weekend trying to figure out the most basic things.  Got one trade in the end though!

```Spent 40 hours that weekend trying to figure out the most basic things.  Got one trade in the end though!``` not you have to spend like a 3 minutes to install the app and create wallet to be ready to perform swap by few clicks. Huge step ahead to the mass adoption imo

[02-Oct-19 08:58 AM] TonyL#3577
While ago I've not understood how to use BarterDEX tbh

[02-Oct-19 09:03 AM] CrisF#3405
The changes in that short time are really impressive.
For me BarterDEX was the first time I'd every really used a computer for anything other that the most basic of things.  
It was very eye opening to see what everyone was able to do.
Got me to find a whole new world that was hiding under the surface.

For example for Tesla took not one year to create usable electro car. And some time is also needed to replace all gasoline to electro cars. But I wonder it's obivious that in future will be no gasoline cars like nobody using horses now
