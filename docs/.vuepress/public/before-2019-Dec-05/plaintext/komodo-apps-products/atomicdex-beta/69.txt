For failed swaps reports via form is fine. It's not GUI issues in 99% of cases. For your BAT failed swaps lets say I've added comment to this issue: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/447#issuecomment-533775566

hi guys, why are coins with the KMD logo like hush, redfox etc.?

[21-Sep-19 04:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Hi! It‚Äôs indicator for chains using Komodo smart-chain technology (aka assetchains)

[21-Sep-19 04:28 PM] Trusty#8181
are like erc20 of ETH?

[21-Sep-19 04:32 PM] PTYX#6840
yes

[21-Sep-19 05:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Actually its not - assetchains are totally independent blockchains while erc20 usability/txfees depends of ethereum blockchain

[21-Sep-19 05:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Assetchain can exist without kmd, erc20 will not work without eth

[21-Sep-19 05:05 PM] TonyL#3577
And with assetsCC Antara module activated you can issue infinity amount of tokens on assetchains which will be something like a erc20 on eth blockchain

[21-Sep-19 05:05 PM] TonyL#3577
But better hehe because of embeed tokendex functionality

[21-Sep-19 05:26 PM] PTYX#6840
yes that's the complex version, but i think he was just referring if they are listed with the kmd logo like erc20s are listed under the erc20 logo

[21-Sep-19 05:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, it‚Äôs similar indicator

[21-Sep-19 05:30 PM] Trusty#8181

Is AtomicDEX available on PC or only Android for now?

[21-Sep-19 10:08 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
On mobile @2456145768

[21-Sep-19 10:08 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
As understand it later for PC too

[21-Sep-19 10:48 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @2456145768, ios  and android, like mrtmp3 said.

[21-Sep-19 11:03 PM] 2456145768#5267
Has it ever been available on PC before? I swear I thought I had read something regarding that

[21-Sep-19 11:28 PM] CrisF#3405
Previously BarterDEX, using mm1 (marketmaker1), did over 100,000 atomic swaps.  That was on PC with both BarterDEX GUI and CLI.  
AtomicDEX is the moblie app and based on mm2.  The underlying mm2 software can run on PC (CLI).

[22-Sep-19 12:06 AM] 2456145768#5267
That's what I remembered! BarterDEX. Thank you.
Sorry for the noob questions, but why is there now a marketmaker2? And do we have an ETA for mm2 GUI release on PC ?

[22-Sep-19 12:14 AM] CrisF#3405
mm2 is an updated and improve version based on rust rather than nanomsg(?) among other thing, as I understand it.
A mm2 gui will be released when someone makes one I suppose.

[22-Sep-19 12:15 AM] CrisF#3405
At the moment AtomicDEX is the focus. Not sure if anyone is working on a mm2 gui right now.

[22-Sep-19 12:22 AM] Guinnessstache#3821
So what will be the process to get new ERC-20 assets in the Dex? If for example I wanted TRAC to be listed, would I make a request to the devs or would a community member have to submit it to github and add it themselves ?

[22-Sep-19 12:24 AM] Guinnessstache#3821
Or do you just send it to your eth address in the Dex app and it becomes available to list for sale?

[22-Sep-19 01:38 AM] 2456145768#5267
@CrisF That is very interesting. I appreciate the information.

@2456145768 The desktop version of AtomicDEX will be made available in the future.

[22-Sep-19 01:44 AM] yorklab#7270
This is from a newsletter that was sent out Sep 20th: 
"The Komodo team is also moving forward with integrating nSPV superlight client technology to the Antara Framework and, additionally, working on the desktop versions of AtomicDEX."

@Guinnessstache   Yes, erc20 listing costs ~10k USD in liquid crypto for integrations listing and SPV servers  and 1 year of service,  following years of service are 1k USD a year , prices now are in the exploratory stage and most likely will increase in the future  .  If you are interested send a message to partners@komodoplatform.com

`Not sure if anyone is working on a mm2 gui right now.` @CrisF  #dex-hyperdex and ChainSwap are @2456145768

Good stuff, thanks for the info @Oszy  üëç

[22-Sep-19 07:39 AM] Oszy#5734
I like both, for different coins, Chainswap guys needs funding to develop new features tho it's working and useable as of now, so if anyone likes what they are doing feel free to support them !

@vogelfreund88 this issue is known to occur in iOS in some geo locations
can you confirm you are using iOS?
if you are able to change your device's location using a VPN, please try it
if not, please wait for the next release

[22-Sep-19 10:58 AM] vogelfreund88#4534
Ios yes

So my fund have disapered after a timeout swap, whats the processus to get them back ?

Thanks in advance.

[22-Sep-19 04:22 PM] AkiraX#8269
Swap at 2/3

[22-Sep-19 04:23 PM] AkiraX#8269
Do I have to keep app open

[22-Sep-19 04:23 PM] AkiraX#8269
For swap to go through?

[22-Sep-19 04:31 PM] miles#6381
@AkiraX - yes you do, if iOS it can‚Äôt be in background either

[22-Sep-19 04:32 PM] TonyL#3577
@BlockTech please wait for an automatic refund (app needs to be up and running). If refund will not be executed please DM me tomorrow

[22-Sep-19 04:33 PM] AkiraX#8269
My phone goes to autosleep

[22-Sep-19 04:33 PM] AkiraX#8269
Is there anyway to stake verus from atomicdex?

[22-Sep-19 04:49 PM] actionslacks#4072
you can set it to never sleep in settings.

[22-Sep-19 04:50 PM] actionslacks#4072
and you can only stake verus in  desktop wallet as far as I know

[22-Sep-19 05:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
buy verus via atomicdex, use the same seed used by atomicdex to import that address to Verus Agama Desktop, and stake on the desktop.

[22-Sep-19 06:06 PM] AkiraX#8269
thanks

[22-Sep-19 06:07 PM] AkiraX#8269
must i buy verus?

[22-Sep-19 06:07 PM] AkiraX#8269
i should be able to use same key as hush and kmd key right?

[22-Sep-19 08:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
yes

[23-Sep-19 02:25 AM] digital bullion#8223
How long does a swap need to be on step 2 of 3 to be considered 'stuck' in Atomicdex?

[23-Sep-19 02:28 AM] digital bullion#8223
EDIT: Swap has successfully completed.

[23-Sep-19 03:50 AM] Priva99#5191
Has AtomicDex reached out to projects, CMC 5 to 2000?

[23-Sep-19 03:50 AM] Priva99#5191
Maybe with a standard DM or email.

[23-Sep-19 04:04 AM] PTYX#6840
@Priva99 yes, chainzilla is contacting projects and we've designed brochures as well as a first contact email to onboard projects. We're currently working on interviewing people to expand our sales team to accommodate the atomicdex. I expect the have a new sales agent by the end of the month.

[23-Sep-19 04:05 AM] PTYX#6840
We've already onboarded one project, have 2 in the process of approval for compatability and we've reached out to around 40 projects. The goal isn't to simply list coins. There's a listing fee and we are negotiating that the atomicdex is listed and marketed through the project's website.

[23-Sep-19 04:06 AM] PTYX#6840
Additionally, we have to walk the project through the LP setup. This part is still being polished. It's a crucial part for liquidity.

[23-Sep-19 04:08 AM] Priva99#5191
I tried to get Umbru. 
I think it led to AXE tho

[23-Sep-19 04:09 AM] Priva99#5191
The listing fee is very reasonable

[23-Sep-19 04:10 AM] PTYX#6840
We listed AXE. We have a strong relationship with them since they got added to Chameleon Pay

[23-Sep-19 04:10 AM] Priva99#5191

I know they and Umbru both now share a CEX

[23-Sep-19 04:11 AM] PTYX#6840
There's a few other projects but we haven't gotten clear responses. Most of them don't want to pay so we have to negotiate other things.

[23-Sep-19 04:11 AM] PTYX#6840
I've not heard of Umbru

[23-Sep-19 04:11 AM] PTYX#6840
I'll research them

[23-Sep-19 04:13 AM] Priva99#5191
Yeah

[23-Sep-19 04:13 AM] PTYX#6840
I'd be happy to reach out

[23-Sep-19 04:13 AM] PTYX#6840
If they are a dash fork they should be compatible

[23-Sep-19 04:13 AM] Priva99#5191
It's a DAO

[23-Sep-19 04:13 AM] Priva99#5191
