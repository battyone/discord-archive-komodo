[19-Jul-19 04:57 PM] jansako#3330
yes, I confirmed... :p

[19-Jul-19 04:58 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@jansako MM2 is more reliable, it crashes much less than MM1 and doesn't require to be restarted at all. But it's in beta stage so some bugs might be found (and even crashes), but it's very easy to fix usually.

my node has only KMD/coin orderbooks... just saying... so trying to swap ETH for VRSC will not work, at least not with my node as maker... maybe there are some other makers around, don't know

[19-Jul-19 05:03 PM] mo7881#6408
Is there a list of suggestions for features feedback ? Some of mine may already be listed somewhere

Hello! It is a while since I signed up? When will more testers be added? Open beta, right?

[19-Jul-19 05:08 PM] cipi#4502
and my node removes ERC20-orders from orderbook when https://www.etherchain.org/api/gasPriceOracle (standard > 20)

Looks like someone does have DEX enabled as well. DEX/KMD trade worked but you already know that üòÉ

I inveted to a tester Atomicdex App. I'm try download the APP but I can't do this. The Google Play show me a message 'Register' why this is happened?

[19-Jul-19 09:56 PM] PTYX#6840
Because you must register, be approved, and the chosen ones get to test

[19-Jul-19 09:56 PM] PTYX#6840
Until the public release that is üôÇ

[19-Jul-19 11:28 PM] GuilouGuilouOTE#1930
Hi everyone, I didnt put my Google play mail adress in the registration form and I think thats why I cant already download the app.

The speed of Atomic swap depends of the speed of both blochain. I'm correct?  So if yes, could be nice to have an estimation time of the swap according to the time to have a new block.

[20-Jul-19 04:42 AM] t0sma#0368
Could be also something visual like red, orange, green indicator.

[20-Jul-19 04:43 AM] t0sma#0368
If I swap 2 Komodo smartchain, swap will be fast compare to a swap with BTC.

[20-Jul-19 04:44 AM] t0sma#0368
This is to help people to understand that is it normal that an atomic swap takes time.

[20-Jul-19 04:47 AM] t0sma#0368
There is an issue in TX historic. It's mentioned unconfirmed instead of confirmed.

When I want to sell all amont of a coin. I can't because I can't pay fees.  Could be nice if fees are automatically calculated and deducted from the amount I want to sell.

Thanks for added Ravencoin.  I was able to recover few raven from a old seed when I tried Barterdex.

[20-Jul-19 06:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Thats interesting idea with indicators. Max amount trading should be fixed in next release

`There is an issue in TX historic. It's mentioned unconfirmed instead of confirmed.` what version of the application are you using? Current one 0.1.3 (you can update via PlayMarket) - this issue with tx history was fixed

[20-Jul-19 09:18 AM] Mewnzter#0237
I lost swap history on app update. Expected?

[20-Jul-19 09:19 AM] Slyris#2880

[20-Jul-19 09:25 AM] Simon#6247
So there is still 13.3715 vrsc missing since yesterday. However I have an order up (original order) of 25 vrsc.

Now lets try and see what happens if I cancel the original order

I just updated but can't see a version number now on Android.

[20-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Slyris#2880
You need to correctly uninstall the application before @yorklab

[20-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Slyris#2880
If you update without uninstall

[20-Jul-19 09:30 AM] Slyris#2880
You will not see the number anymore

[20-Jul-19 09:30 AM] Slyris#2880
This is a known bug.

[20-Jul-19 09:30 AM] yorklab#7270
Ah, OK, I updated without uninstall, thanks.

[20-Jul-19 09:31 AM] Slyris#2880
@ca333 will let us know when this bug will be fixed.

[20-Jul-19 09:32 AM] TonyL#3577
@Simon it's not good that you have some funds missed/stuck
Do you have log file with this problem swap or it's uuid?

[20-Jul-19 09:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Also have you tried to restart app after full stop? Probably app will continue swap or at least will try to and we'll see something helpful in log (in case you didn't delete/reinstall app after problem swap)

[20-Jul-19 09:35 AM] Simon#6247
I restarted several times since yesterday, I have not reinstalled the app

[20-Jul-19 09:36 AM] Simon#6247
This is what I have regarding the swap

I guess it's still possible that the Ethereum will be credited to my balance, when the Ethereum wallet is ready syncing

[20-Jul-19 09:38 AM] Simon#6247
Cancelling the order of 25 vrsc did not do anything as of yet

[20-Jul-19 09:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Can you check your Ethereum address in explorer?  (https://etherscan.io/)

[20-Jul-19 09:39 AM] Simon#6247

[20-Jul-19 09:50 AM] TonyL#3577
I see, will need to check your swap status/logs on the seednode

[20-Jul-19 09:51 AM] TonyL#3577
For now please do not uninstall/reinstall app on this phone

[20-Jul-19 09:58 AM] Simon#6247

Is there a way to remove assets from the portfolio list?

[20-Jul-19 10:31 AM] TonyL#3577
There is no such feature at the moment. you can execute "logout" from settings and then on login will have only default coins activated

[20-Jul-19 10:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Before logout please ensure that you remember your wallet password/seed

I uninstalled atomicdex. Then when trying to reinstall through play store I just get the pre register button. I have tried clearing cache and data in play store but nothing changes

[20-Jul-19 11:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Is it the same if use this link: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex ?

[20-Jul-19 11:27 AM] Mewnzter#0237
I don't seem to be able to swap anymore since updating the app. All attempts stay at 0/3

@Mewnzter If you don't have any funds stuck in swaps - it's better to wait for a next release, then uninstall current one and install new one

@Simon If it will not help to send logs via app - could you please dm me when you have a PC, USB cable to connect the phone and a little bit time for `adb` logs collecting?

[20-Jul-19 12:23 PM] Simon#6247
The app just crashed for some reason at the start screen ( I had all my wallets up: btc, kmd, vrsc, doge and dgb). Just I have my phone connected to my macbook right now

[20-Jul-19 12:25 PM] Simon#6247
I will try send feedback once more now

[20-Jul-19 12:25 PM] TonyL#3577
ok, on OSX to install adb:
1) Install Homebrew (in case if it's not installed yet): `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
2) Install android cli tools: `brew cask install android-platform-tools`
3) After it you should be able to use adb `adb devices`

[20-Jul-19 12:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Also you need to enable USB debugging on your phone (it vary of Android version)
