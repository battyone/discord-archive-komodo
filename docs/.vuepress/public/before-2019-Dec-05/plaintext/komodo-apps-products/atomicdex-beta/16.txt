It'd be good to know a max number of concurrent connections so the math can be figured out for number of LP's needed for a dICO. Or maybe an LP can be invisible if currently at the max, to avoid failed swaps due to networking issues

[17-Jul-19 04:15 PM] ca333#0118
over 200 onboarded @vichiet

[17-Jul-19 04:15 PM] vichiet#4058
@ca333 very nice

[17-Jul-19 04:15 PM] Markus#5464
lets say u have 5 orders and one gets matched, can another order get matched meanwhile first swap is on going?

[17-Jul-19 04:15 PM] ca333#0118
yes @Markus

[17-Jul-19 04:16 PM] nymkappa#9440
So the other party will see his coin stuck until the expiration? üòÑ

[17-Jul-19 04:17 PM] ca333#0118
i had atomicDEX nodes i run during the tests matching more than 10 swaps almost simultanously - even the swap process itself takes place concurrently as this is a real multhreading DEX engine.

[17-Jul-19 04:17 PM] Vanncoins#3044
Found another pretty important bug: after logging out and back into atomicDEX (entered password, not just PIN) I had to re-add all of the assets that I possess to the portfolio section. At first I thought I‚Äôd lost them but once I added them back, it displayed the balances. This would be a major pain if you had quite a lot of assets in your DEX wallets

@nymkappa - no, exactly the opposite if you re-read Markus and my posts.

[17-Jul-19 04:17 PM] Markus#5464
Maybe later it could be nice to have a option to tab out of current swap to lets say create another order or browse the orderbook and just get a popup when ur swap is completed?

[17-Jul-19 04:18 PM] dan.#2473
So it marks the UTXO as unavailable if in use right

[17-Jul-19 04:18 PM] nymkappa#9440
Missed it. Will check it out

[17-Jul-19 04:18 PM] ca333#0118
@Vanncoins - ok i see, so basically persisting the coins you had activated even after log-out. Correct?

[17-Jul-19 04:18 PM] nymkappa#9440
That would make sense from an UX perspective

[17-Jul-19 04:19 PM] Vanncoins#3044
@ca333 it removed all the coins other than BTC, KMD and RICK

[17-Jul-19 04:19 PM] Alecandro#1179
I like that suggestion, I can see that as annoying @Vanncoins

ok - adding this feature request to the list.

[17-Jul-19 04:20 PM] dan.#2473
is there a way to have a config for portfolio persisting

[17-Jul-19 04:20 PM] dan.#2473
that would be good

[17-Jul-19 04:21 PM] dan.#2473
we all understand how kmd chains work. but might be a bit unintuitive for some people to log in and having to add their coins again

[17-Jul-19 04:22 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea I would think less experienced people would think they lost their coins

[17-Jul-19 04:23 PM] Vanncoins#3044
At the very least, it could be made to persist the correct total balance

[17-Jul-19 04:24 PM] dan.#2473
there could be a local file that stores balances by address

[17-Jul-19 04:31 PM] jansako#3330
show coins with positive balance by default, then whatever the user activates on top of that

[17-Jul-19 04:32 PM] vichiet#4058
Do I need eth in my wallet ?

[17-Jul-19 04:33 PM] Malti#3948
atomicDEX revshares will be paid out to DEX holders right?

[17-Jul-19 04:34 PM] jansako#3330
yep. I got some for sale @ 40KMD if you want üòÉ

[17-Jul-19 04:34 PM] tolken#2655
why are KMD devs so badass?

[17-Jul-19 04:35 PM] shinsplints#4052
I received an email on the 10th saying I'm one of the lucky ones, clicked on the link but haven't received anything yet. That Playstore link above isn't working either

[17-Jul-19 04:35 PM] shinsplints#4052
Anyone have any ideas?

[17-Jul-19 04:36 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
@jansako is there any other places to buy dex

[17-Jul-19 04:36 PM] tolken#2655
@shinsplints DM ca333

[17-Jul-19 04:37 PM] Regnar#6164
Noticed when I click on a coin I swapped to, it says "unconfirmed" regardless of how many confirmations it has, if I click the swap specifically it shows accurate confirmationa

[17-Jul-19 04:37 PM] jansako#3330

maybe we should add DEX to atomicDEX sooner than later

[17-Jul-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
but we are still in the "test only with funds you are willing to lose stage", so best not to risk the extremely rare DEX coins

[17-Jul-19 04:42 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
how did people end up with DEX

[17-Jul-19 04:43 PM] jansako#3330
there was an ICo a looong time ago in a different universe (NXT)

[17-Jul-19 04:44 PM] jansako#3330
Extremely rare you say? OK, price just went up to 50 KMD

[17-Jul-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
no ICO for DEX

[17-Jul-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
only a couple of private investors and then it started trading on the open market

[17-Jul-19 04:44 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
wish I'd known of kmd back then.  I actually had a lot of nxt back in 2017 pump, and ended up with a bunch of crappy ignis

[17-Jul-19 04:45 PM] cipi#4502
@vichiet you need ETH ro pay for the fees of ERC20 transactions, so yes, so always need ETH to buy ETH... that is how ERC20 tokens work, all txfees are paid in ETH... i know, total crap, but it is what it is...

[17-Jul-19 04:46 PM] jansako#3330
@cryptoclueless we are talking like late 2014 for the start of the DEX...

[17-Jul-19 04:46 PM] jansako#3330
sometime after Supernet ICO

[17-Jul-19 04:46 PM] jansako#3330
maybe 2015...

[17-Jul-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
if i remember right, InstantDEX (precursor to DEX) predates SuperNET

[17-Jul-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
summer of 2014 i think

[17-Jul-19 04:49 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
i bought my first LTC back then on ebay for $2 or $3, sold it at $55 I think on ebay, that was my introduction to crypto

[17-Jul-19 04:50 PM] benzo365#8202
Kmd logo needs updating üòÅ

[17-Jul-19 04:51 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
@cipi so if I trade or withdraw BAT which is an ERC20 token, do I need ETH in the atomicdex wallet?

[17-Jul-19 04:55 PM] SHossain#0007
@benzo365 it will be updated on next version

[17-Jul-19 04:55 PM] cipi#4502
@cryptoclueless yes, you need ETH to transfer any ERC20 token

[17-Jul-19 04:57 PM] benzo365#8202
Also, when you first copy your seed when setting up there is no 'copied to clipboard' message, so you don't know that it's been copied...

[17-Jul-19 04:57 PM] benzo365#8202
...until you go paste, but just a nice to have...

[17-Jul-19 04:58 PM] SHossain#0007
@benzo365 where do you copy your seed from?

[17-Jul-19 04:58 PM] SHossain#0007
you shouldn't copy your seed and keep in any device which is connected to internet

[17-Jul-19 04:59 PM] SHossain#0007
write down in a piece of paper or notebook

[17-Jul-19 04:59 PM] SHossain#0007
or in an 100% offline computer

[17-Jul-19 04:59 PM] allbits#5898
What about in gpg protected file?

[17-Jul-19 05:00 PM] SHossain#0007
might be secure enough. but, hey, you never know what gets hacked next.

[17-Jul-19 05:01 PM] allbits#5898
Piece of paper seems stone age, and carries its own risks

[17-Jul-19 05:01 PM] SHossain#0007
ca333 talks enough about security and we learn a lot from him.

[17-Jul-19 05:01 PM] allbits#5898
Single point of failure seems bad idea too

[17-Jul-19 05:01 PM] SHossain#0007
every method has it's flaws

[17-Jul-19 05:01 PM] SHossain#0007
keep multiple backups

[17-Jul-19 05:03 PM] SHossain#0007
like combination of paper, crypto steel, offline computer, offline USB drives

[17-Jul-19 05:03 PM] SHossain#0007
*encrypted USB drives üòÑ

[17-Jul-19 05:03 PM] benzo365#8202
@SHossain yeah, I know but I'm willing just for testing....so yeah, that's probably right. I was too excited to get home to write down lol

[17-Jul-19 05:04 PM] SHossain#0007
i've an A4 size paper which is filled with seed that used for testing

[17-Jul-19 05:04 PM] SHossain#0007
no funds there, but just helps for testing as well

[17-Jul-19 05:10 PM] Malti#3948
a notification that funds were received on one of your activated coins, is that an option?

[17-Jul-19 05:10 PM] SHossain#0007
@Malti you need a github account mate üòÇ

[17-Jul-19 05:11 PM] Malti#3948

you have good feature requests

[17-Jul-19 05:12 PM] SHossain#0007
this would be good to have. even after each swap, starts and completes

[17-Jul-19 05:12 PM] SHossain#0007

Beware of a scammer posing as SHossain he is messaging me now. Can we get username blocked SHossain#5701

[17-Jul-19 05:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
End of the day check the notifications to see which went through

[17-Jul-19 05:14 PM] SHossain#0007
we dreamt about this, @Cryptoon,  and the result is this beta test and mobile first approach
