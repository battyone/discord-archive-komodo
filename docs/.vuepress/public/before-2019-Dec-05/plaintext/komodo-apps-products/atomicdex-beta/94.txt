@ca333 sure that I should cancel the order as soon as the cancel button appears?  the cancel button will be displayed immediately.

for shits and giggles today i had an autoclicker on the faucet to see how many rick and mortys i could get

[31-Oct-19 01:17 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Bet 1 morty it fails

[31-Oct-19 01:17 PM] Hooftly#1337
it's nice to help great even but if you're going to offer a prize to users to participate all the users should be able to participate just saying it's about principles not about the prize

[31-Oct-19 01:17 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
i got up to 32k rick and 16k morty!

[31-Oct-19 01:17 PM] ѕℓιм#1031

[31-Oct-19 01:17 PM] duskonaut#1244

[31-Oct-19 01:18 PM] ѕℓιм#1031

[31-Oct-19 01:20 PM] Dirty Moe#2091

[31-Oct-19 01:20 PM] dudezmobi#1945
You created trouble for the team

[31-Oct-19 01:20 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
'I'm going to waste everyone's time and resources to get as much of this worthless coin as possible, but it's not malicious'

[31-Oct-19 01:21 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Lol

[31-Oct-19 01:21 PM] Hooftly#1337
wouldn't sending a large transaction help a stress test

[31-Oct-19 01:21 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
i genuinely did not think that it would affect anything

[31-Oct-19 01:21 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Some testers dont have coins

[31-Oct-19 01:21 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
no need to be dicks about it

[31-Oct-19 01:21 PM] Alright#0419
could have just saved yourself the trouble and asked someone for 30k of each 😂

[31-Oct-19 01:21 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I was just being an asshole, but it wasn't malicious

[31-Oct-19 01:21 PM] Hooftly#1337
it's apparent that's your standard

[31-Oct-19 01:21 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Hmmmm

[31-Oct-19 01:22 PM] gigamesh#3544
@Dirty Moe did nothin wrong imo. there was no mention of having more than 7.77 iirc

[31-Oct-19 01:22 PM] ETcrypt#3306
Chips, here comes the teacher

[31-Oct-19 01:22 PM] dudezmobi#1945
Moving on. Make that 30k worth it

[31-Oct-19 01:22 PM] Jimm B.#9993
@Team  Admin sure that I should cancel the order as soon as the cancel button appears?  the cancel button will be displayed immediately.

[31-Oct-19 01:23 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
i think i just got one....1/3

[31-Oct-19 01:23 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
@gigamesh sure. I requested a few times so that I could make orders bigger than 1 each, but setting up an autoclicker when there is a 2/3 minute cooldown period? That's asshole behavior at best.

[31-Oct-19 01:23 PM] dudezmobi#1945
This channel

[31-Oct-19 01:23 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
nope, went to 0/3 lol

[31-Oct-19 01:23 PM] gigamesh#3544

[31-Oct-19 01:24 PM] farl#9964
Tonight I will dream about 0/3’s 😅

[31-Oct-19 01:24 PM] Dirty Moe#2091

[31-Oct-19 01:25 PM] [deleted]#2162
Does anybody else have bunch of unconfirmed transactions from the faucet?
