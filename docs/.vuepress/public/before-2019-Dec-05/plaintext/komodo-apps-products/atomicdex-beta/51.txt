[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #76: Inputting sell value autocompletes to max
@dudezmobi I was not able to reproduce. Please note that transaction and taker fee reducing also so `whole balance = sell field + taker fee + transaction fee`

@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± not yet, we've switched from bi-daily to bi-weekly users adding at the moment

@Spyda96 via faucet it's possible to get RICK/MORTY once for a fresh wallet

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #71: Incoming transactions of LTC and Dash are not shown in the portfolio transaction history page
@gcharang from your screenshots it looks like that only transactions to "self" address not displaying. Could you please confirm that? 
Also can you please send DASH transaction to self from AtomicDEX and from Agama and compare results in AtomicDEX tx history?

Just tried to send few DASH txs to self address in AtomicDEX and it displaying fine. (tx to self displaying as fee consumption) Maybe txs from Agama has some specific.

Btw ios test app still at 0.1.53

[12-Aug-19 02:26 AM] TonyL#3577
App publishing in testflight with delay in comparison with android because of review process, in some time both should be in sync

[12-Aug-19 04:13 AM] dudezmobi#1945
@TonyL  use kmd for your testing of issue #76

[12-Aug-19 04:13 AM] dudezmobi#1945
It wont reproduce in rick and morty

[12-Aug-19 04:15 AM] dudezmobi#1945

Sorry for the probably dumb question, can trades be executed if i am loged out?

[12-Aug-19 08:24 AM] Oszy#5734
not if you logged out

[12-Aug-19 08:24 AM] Oszy#5734
but if you leave the app running in background yes, it can (on android)

@Oszy thanks, i supposed it that way, just wanted confirmation... Not so sure if other nontechies are aware of that though

[12-Aug-19 09:41 AM] Werxadler#6422
Might be also the reason for several failed swaps i guess ü§î

[12-Aug-19 09:51 AM] Oszy#5734
failed swap is other reasons

[12-Aug-19 09:51 AM] Oszy#5734
it would be timeout if you close the app once a swap has already started

[12-Aug-19 09:52 AM] Oszy#5734
but there is a "big" timespan in which if you log back in it kickstarts the trade again and continue

[12-Aug-19 10:25 AM] jansako#3330
Someone was starting RFOX/KMD swaps then shutting down their phone in the last day or so... just guessing by the amount of 'Didn't receive any data since...' messages on my bob node...

[12-Aug-19 10:26 AM] Oszy#5734
maybe it was ios and wasn't  keeping it in focus

[12-Aug-19 10:28 AM] jansako#3330
yeah, that seems a big one on iOS for now, otherwise one has to stare at their phone for 5 mins... then the screen saver times out just before the end üòÉ

[12-Aug-19 12:20 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@jansako Hi! `Didn't receive any data since...` messages are related to Electrum server connections. It means that no data was received from particular Electrum server for 60 seconds so connection is forcefully aborted and reconnected then. It might mean that you have some connectivity issues on your server or maybe there's a problem with Electrum server itself. These messages can appear when no swaps are running as connections are kept active at background continously if coin is activated.

[12-Aug-19 12:22 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
If you see these messages often and have failed swaps please make sure that network connectivity on your node is in good state. If it's good but you still see this please submit an issue with logs to AtomicDEX-API repo: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues

Hello! @don Please DM me your email connected to google play market apple app store depends of platform you want to test on

[12-Aug-19 07:14 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Not sure if it was mentioned but if a swap fails it would be good to show the unrecoverable fees charged and possibly the amount of recoverable funds 'locked' in the swap

[12-Aug-19 07:15 PM] Bitfinger#6245
New version looks much better but could fit more on the portfolio page before needing to scroll

[12-Aug-19 07:20 PM] Bitfinger#6245
would also be great to have a 'Markets' tab where you can see all markets for currently activated coins with current prices and maybe jump to trade by selecting one

[12-Aug-19 08:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Thank you for a feedback! UI/UX enchancement and new features definetly coming in next versions.
If you have time you can elaborate your suggestions and ideas and open issue here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicdex/issues 
Lets say mockup of how this 'Markets' tab should looks like can help a lot to deeply understand your idea (paint is fine üòÉ )

If you have an erc20 selected when making creating order and you dont have eth activated it doesnt let click the trade button,(not greyed out its still green) which is fine but no indication why. Now not every might know you need the eth for the order a message would be nice about it when you try to do the swap.mentioned above.

[13-Aug-19 08:45 AM] antropov083#9529
after the release, the balance will not disappear?

[13-Aug-19 09:10 AM] TonyL#3577
I recommend to consolidate balance (send whole balance to self) time to time if you mine on AtomicDEX address

[13-Aug-19 09:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Otherwise you might have problems in swaps because of too complex transaction construction (too many UTXOs)

[13-Aug-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
best to not atomicDEX the address you mine to. at some point it will exceed electrum size limits for utxos

[13-Aug-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
make a different address for atomicDEX

[13-Aug-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
do not mine to atomicDEX address. this should be a warning, there is no way an electrum based swap will work reliably to a mined address

We're aware of some users encountering this issue (myself included), and have identified a root cause, though additional logs are welcomed in case there is more than one. Strangely, the phone I was having issues with has also had periods of not suffering the problem. I'm curious and investigating why.

accoding to atomicdex I paid 0.1235816 KMD fee on a 19.8764184 KMD tx sending out KMD from atomicdex to another wallet (not swap) 
I actually sent out 20 and received 20 so the indication is wrong
