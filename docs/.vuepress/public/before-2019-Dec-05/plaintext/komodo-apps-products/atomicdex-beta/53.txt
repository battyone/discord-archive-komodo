After a little bit of struggle to create a wallet (slow encryption, freezing ui) I am happy to swap back and forth on mobile. Dozen of swaps, no failure so far. Native Android UX very slick. It's gonna need o lot of tweak and polish to make it production ready, but overall I am impressed.

I think currently the best UX on Android belongs to Exodus Wallet. Definitely recommend to check that out. With a little effort Atomic Dex could get pretty close to that.

Thanks for the feedback @phideas - towards end of beta stage our main focus will be UX/UI enhancement (charts, improved UX,...).

[20-Aug-19 05:59 PM] PTYX#6840
@phideas exodus mobile is a beaut

I don’t know if it’s only on French mode?

[20-Aug-19 07:10 PM] buralux#1776
I’m on iOS

[20-Aug-19 07:21 PM] TonyL#3577
What iphone model do you have @buralux ? Also could you please try to delete the app and install again to see if problem remains? (at first please ensure that you have an access to your seed)

Looks fine on my XR. If you have a time could you please try to re-install @buralux ?

[20-Aug-19 09:47 PM] Philtr#9415
I do not get a connection at atomicDEX even after reinstalling and restarting the phone. Cache was also emptied. No improvement.

[20-Aug-19 10:09 PM] Philtr#9415
Use version 0.1.6

I get that screen the last week.

[21-Aug-19 06:40 AM] Philtr#9415
I have the same problem.

[21-Aug-19 08:30 AM] phideas#8309
Same wallet initialization problem. It happens on cold start of the app. UI hang and freeze for minutes. After a little wait and two app restarts it finally loads up and the UI is quick and responsive again. Android on Samsung S10.

[21-Aug-19 09:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Same, also on s10. Can confirm that it "wakes up" and works ok once it gets past it.

[21-Aug-19 01:10 PM] denio#8067
Hey guys, i love AtomicDex 😍  Would it be possible to add Hush. That would be amazing!

[21-Aug-19 01:11 PM] Oszy#5734
You can swap hush in chainswap (using atomicdex API)

[21-Aug-19 01:11 PM] denio#8067
But there is no way atm to swap direct in the Beta App or?

[21-Aug-19 01:12 PM] Oszy#5734
not in the mobile app yet, but can do on pc

[21-Aug-19 01:13 PM] denio#8067
rly interesting! Is there a "How To" or something? Sorry for the noob question

[21-Aug-19 01:14 PM] Oszy#5734
I'll DM you the discord for Chainswap, don't want to spam here

[21-Aug-19 01:14 PM] denio#8067
not yet? but later?

[21-Aug-19 01:14 PM] denio#8067

Thank you for report! Can confirm this issue (it's created in internal bug tracking system few days ago also)

[21-Aug-19 10:09 PM] Philtr#9415
Logging in and creating a wallet works without any problems. In addition, I can not connect to the portfolio. Neither in the wifi nor in the mobile network. It loads without results. A reboot and an empty cache did not change anything.

[22-Aug-19 06:34 AM] saskboy#5198
Tried leaving the app open for several minutes and it never connected again.

[22-Aug-19 06:55 AM] zephuros#2936
just got this fired up on my iphone ETH deposit was fast testing first trade now for ETH to KMD and this app looks slick nice work

[22-Aug-19 07:11 AM] zephuros#2936
looks like it let me open 2 orders with the same ETH not sure how that will work

[22-Aug-19 07:12 AM] gcharang#6833
@zephuros for two different pairs?
if so the first order that matches will cancel the other order

[22-Aug-19 07:13 AM] zephuros#2936
the first time it did cancel my eth to kmd and then let me do eth to rvn, now i got both going we will see which one goes thru first

[22-Aug-19 07:14 AM] zephuros#2936
how long does a swap take on avgerage?

[22-Aug-19 07:15 AM] gcharang#6833
depends on the block times of the involved coins
faster blocktimes --> faster swaps

[22-Aug-19 07:15 AM] zephuros#2936
got ya

[22-Aug-19 07:16 AM] zephuros#2936
rvn takes forever so kmd trade should go thru first

[22-Aug-19 07:17 AM] zephuros#2936
anything you need me to try on my iphone?

[22-Aug-19 07:18 AM] gcharang#6833
@zephuros did both orders match and swaps started? eth/kmd and eth/rvn ?

[22-Aug-19 07:18 AM] zephuros#2936
both are on 2/3 right now

[22-Aug-19 07:18 AM] gcharang#6833
and both are using the maximum available eth?

[22-Aug-19 07:19 AM] zephuros#2936
looks like the eth is locked now to

[22-Aug-19 07:19 AM] zephuros#2936
yes

[22-Aug-19 07:19 AM] zephuros#2936
ok rvn went thru and now the eth to kmd is still open

[22-Aug-19 07:19 AM] zephuros#2936
i am guessing this one will fail

[22-Aug-19 07:22 AM] gcharang#6833
@zephuros what happened with the eth/kmd swap?

[22-Aug-19 07:22 AM] zephuros#2936
2/3 right now still

[22-Aug-19 07:23 AM] zephuros#2936
still surprised it let me get that far tho

[22-Aug-19 07:23 AM] gcharang#6833
it shouldn't actually
can you verify the amount of eth being swapped in both the trades?

[22-Aug-19 07:23 AM] zephuros#2936
sure

[22-Aug-19 07:24 AM] zephuros#2936
.0879 eth for 482.4852 rvn which went thru and  pending one is .0879 eth for 20.5045 kmd

[22-Aug-19 07:25 AM] zephuros#2936
only put little eth in to test

[22-Aug-19 07:26 AM] gcharang#6833
once the eth/kmd swap fails or times out or god forbid goes throuh, can you send the log thrugh DM?

[22-Aug-19 07:26 AM] zephuros#2936
sure

[22-Aug-19 07:26 AM] zephuros#2936
i hope it fails but ether way got to fix that

[22-Aug-19 07:27 AM] zephuros#2936
if it goes thru i will some extra kmd  millionair lol jk

[22-Aug-19 07:28 AM] zephuros#2936
are you guys doing a bug bounty ?

[22-Aug-19 07:29 AM] zephuros#2936
ether way all good just wondering

[22-Aug-19 07:29 AM] gcharang#6833
not really, but there are plans to reward active testers

[22-Aug-19 07:29 AM] zephuros#2936
kool

[22-Aug-19 07:30 AM] zephuros#2936
it took 20 mins but just failed that order

[22-Aug-19 07:30 AM] zephuros#2936
woot

[22-Aug-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
@gcharang there should be a bug about not finding conflicting transactions sooner. it seems if there is a swap that cannot possibly work (due to the same funds being spent), then we can detect it sooner. then again, it could be tricky as it is balance based

[22-Aug-19 08:20 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, that was my thought as ETH doesn't have utxos

[22-Aug-19 09:52 AM] Small Fish#5687
Will be once possible to exchange iota on AtomicDEX?

[22-Aug-19 09:56 AM] Small Fish#5687
And btw I have most of my Komodo blocked on the dex because some swap didn’t go through and although the transactions timeout coins are still blocked

[22-Aug-19 09:57 AM] Small Fish#5687
And there is no transaction to cancel they are all timeout

[22-Aug-19 10:04 AM] gcharang#6833
@Small Fish the locked amount should be back to you in some time
there are no plans to integrate IOTA currently as it is an entirely different system and it is not a blockchain
it might be possible in the future but further research is needed

[22-Aug-19 10:05 AM] Small Fish#5687
Thank for answer

[22-Aug-19 10:05 AM] Small Fish#5687
The amount is blocked since 3 weeks

[22-Aug-19 10:05 AM] Small Fish#5687
So I don’t think it will come back or did u manually unlock it ?

[22-Aug-19 10:06 AM] gcharang#6833

[22-Aug-19 10:07 AM] Small Fish#5687
The coin are not really important it’s just to avoid further complication with bigger amount

[22-Aug-19 10:08 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, there were problems with unlocking stuck swaps in the previous versions
now it should be better
once you send us the details, we can advise you on how to unlock the coins
