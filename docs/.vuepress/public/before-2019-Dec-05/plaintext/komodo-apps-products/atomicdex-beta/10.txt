@TonyL I already clean app cache . But all history for Rick and Morty doesn't work. Now work again but no more swap in history

[16-Jul-19 09:49 AM] vichiet#4058
No big deal because I don't have money token swap üëå

[16-Jul-19 09:50 AM] TonyL#3577
bug is a bug with any coin

[16-Jul-19 10:00 AM] Kiruel#2091
Can you delete the app and re-install @vichiet ?

[16-Jul-19 10:00 AM] Kiruel#2091
They are a new version with the feedback.

[16-Jul-19 10:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[16-Jul-19 10:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I hope it didn't wipe the old dex data

[16-Jul-19 10:13 AM] wl#4107
Can I send kmd to the dex?

[16-Jul-19 10:13 AM] wl#4107
Or just Rick and Morty for now?

[16-Jul-19 10:14 AM] Kiruel#2091
@grewalsatinder Its really weird.

[16-Jul-19 10:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep. I only left the app running.

Also see this in update notifications

[16-Jul-19 10:16 AM] Kiruel#2091
update its normal

[16-Jul-19 10:16 AM] Kiruel#2091
Tell when you have installed if you still see the redfox please.

[16-Jul-19 10:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I didn't touch the install/uninstall etc waiting for instructions. üòÑ

[16-Jul-19 10:17 AM] Kiruel#2091
Ok i see üòÉ

[16-Jul-19 10:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
don't want to open the app... concerning if it wipes old swap data, I will lose those KMD

[16-Jul-19 10:18 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe playmarket update propagated not worldwide yet

[16-Jul-19 10:19 AM] Kiruel#2091
I don't think you will lose your fund, your fund should be re-fund in the next 24h @artem.pikulin right ? If a swap fail.

[16-Jul-19 10:20 AM] Tony Stark#4609
@Mark81 @TonyL Yeah, I'm running v0.1.2... I'll wait for a fix, thanks!

[16-Jul-19 10:21 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
It depends on what error happened, `satinder` swap is in state when refund is not possible as his payment is spent. The app data should be kept, but we will be able to get the funds back even if app data is lost, however it might be a bit harder.

[16-Jul-19 10:21 AM] TonyL#3577
@Tony Stark fix should be in Play Market already,  please uninstall AtomicDEX app which you have atm on your phone and install actual one from Play Market

[16-Jul-19 10:22 AM] Kiruel#2091
`however it might be a bit harder` We need to do something manualy ?

[16-Jul-19 10:27 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
In some cases yes, I've already found that MM2 aborts swap on 1st errored RPC request attempt when waiting for payment to be spent, but even with the fix we will still have low percentage of swaps that will need manual help with to unlock the funds.

[16-Jul-19 10:28 AM] Kiruel#2091
Ok so he just need to wait how many time you think ? (to a refund)

[16-Jul-19 10:29 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
We need to get `swap_status` and logs first and then we will see what to do next.

[16-Jul-19 10:30 AM] vichiet#4058
@Kiruel a New one ? I have 0.1.2

[16-Jul-19 10:32 AM] Kiruel#2091
For this we need more logs then. And he will need to delete the app for this and lose the swaps infos.

[16-Jul-19 10:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
you think the swap files must be in this directory?

[16-Jul-19 10:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I navigated to the sub-directories.

MarketMakerLib dir is empty too

[16-Jul-19 10:38 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
It's `MovieMaker` dir, @Kiruel where MM2 DB dir should be located?

[16-Jul-19 10:38 AM] Kiruel#2091
It's the `workingDirectory` when call mm2 right ? Lets me print the path

[16-Jul-19 10:42 AM] Kiruel#2091
Should be here `/data/user/0/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex/app_flutter/`

[16-Jul-19 10:43 AM] Kiruel#2091
This is the path i give to mm2.

[16-Jul-19 10:45 AM] ferjr90#9314
Despite being in the first batch of testers, I cannot download AtomicDEX from Google Play, I can only register. I supplied the same mail I used for Google Play

[16-Jul-19 10:45 AM] ferjr90#9314
Is it normal?

@grewalsatinder Is your device rooted?

[16-Jul-19 10:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
nope

[16-Jul-19 11:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I wish it was üòÅ

[16-Jul-19 11:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I didn't wanted to lose installed data so didn't root it

[16-Jul-19 11:00 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
I'm not sure if it's possible to read arbitrary directory content on android without root.

[16-Jul-19 11:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yeh, was expecting that

[16-Jul-19 11:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
with adb?

[16-Jul-19 11:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess that'd be no too.... ü§î

@ca333  should everyone disable powersaving mode for atomicDex from settings. That way app is executing swaps in background also?!

[16-Jul-19 01:57 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Not encrypting still after reinstall

[16-Jul-19 02:00 PM] SHossain#0007
@mrtzmp3 did you try `Fast encryption`?

[16-Jul-19 02:01 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yes

[16-Jul-19 02:03 PM] SHossain#0007
which phone are you using?

[16-Jul-19 02:15 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Clear cache and reboot if this happens to you

[16-Jul-19 02:15 PM] SHossain#0007
glad the trick worked for you

[16-Jul-19 02:16 PM] SHossain#0007
your phone is compatible and from last year. we even tested almost 5 year old phone.
