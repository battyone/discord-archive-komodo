I could not install on my phone. This is the fault of my phone not the app as I have had this problem with my phone and other apps before.

[23-Aug-19 09:07 AM] gcharang#6833
@Crypto Rich any specific error?

[23-Aug-19 09:08 AM] Crypto Rich#6241
I am using Bluestacks on my mac. Have installed the app there....set up the wallet....it is now just connecting

I have a vpn.

[23-Aug-19 09:09 AM] gcharang#6833
try disabling the vpn?

[23-Aug-19 09:09 AM] Crypto Rich#6241
ok

[23-Aug-19 09:11 AM] Crypto Rich#6241
portfolio screen is still as above. But the dex tab seems ok

[23-Aug-19 09:12 AM] gcharang#6833
may be the app isn't able to connect to spv servers when used through an emulator
you could use a screen recording app on a android device?
@Crypto Rich

[23-Aug-19 09:13 AM] Crypto Rich#6241
Ok. I will try to sort my mobile out.

[23-Aug-19 09:13 AM] Crypto Rich#6241
Can you suggest a screen recording app. I did not know there was such a thing

How is the pricing worked out between coins? E.g. I am exchanging BCH for KMD

[23-Aug-19 10:53 AM] gcharang#6833
normally it depends on whatever the maker wants to offer

right now, most of the maker orders are from the team with the approximate market price

[23-Aug-19 10:55 AM] Crypto Rich#6241
ok ty

adex is a little more expensive than changenow

[23-Aug-19 11:07 AM] Crypto Rich#6241
how come? and will this change in the future with greater liquidity

[23-Aug-19 11:13 AM] gcharang#6833
@Crypto Rich any one create a new order with whatever price they'd like
right now the only orders available are by the team
that is the reason the price might be a little different from the market price

Error [DF-AA-33] when downloading my Application
I just uploaded my App to the Google Play Store and when I try to download it I get the following error: Error retrieving information from the server [DF-AA-33]

```2

These are steps:

    Go to Settings -> Apps -> Play Store and then tap Clear Data and Cache
    Go to Settings -> Accounts -> Google and then Remove Account
    Restart your phone
    Log in with your Google Account and open Play Store.

Done
``` maybe such way can help

[23-Aug-19 01:33 PM] TonyL#3577
this error looks like some Play Store issue because since you have `Install` button availiable you have an access to the app

[23-Aug-19 01:38 PM] Oszy#5734
Not sure about Bluestacks but it didn't work for me in Memu, none of them are even close to "stock" android experience. Also please don't use real wallet seed in these bloatware emulators.

[23-Aug-19 01:48 PM] ciumete#3212
now i don't find atomic dex on google magazine!

[23-Aug-19 02:02 PM] ciumete#3212
so ? the server is down ?!

[23-Aug-19 02:04 PM] gcharang#6833
@ciumete 
have you tried
```
Go to Settings -> Apps -> Play Store and then tap Clear Data and Cache
    Go to Settings -> Accounts -> Google and then Remove Account
    Restart your phone
    Log in with your Google Account and open Play Store.
```
?

[23-Aug-19 02:28 PM] ciumete#3212

@RoyalCrypto could you please check if you logined into playstore with same email as you shared for app access? This error means that current account has not enough permissions to download

Confirmed it is the same email in play store.

[24-Aug-19 09:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@ciumete make sure you are logged in on play store (app, and in browser) with the email address  you signed up with,

I am pretty sure atomic dex was visible for non registered accounts before. Now it shows up in play store only for invited account.

is there away to remove a coin from your list?

[24-Aug-19 11:48 PM] zephuros#2936
i don't think i will be trading rick or  morty coin any time soon lol

[25-Aug-19 12:52 AM] TonyL#3577
there is no functionality to remove coin from list right now

[25-Aug-19 07:00 AM] CrisF#3405
Would a reinstall do the trick?

[25-Aug-19 07:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Settings -> Logout and Login can do the trick at the moment (only default coins will load)

atomic dex always said waiting release in play store now cant find it , anyone knowq why

[28-Aug-19 10:25 PM] yorklab#7270
@JonnyBioICX Are you saying you do see the program at all on the play store? Because I see it right now on my computer.

[28-Aug-19 10:37 PM] GuilouGuilouOTE#1930
I don't see it neither on the playstore, it's been like that for 2 or 3 days already (at least on my phone)

[28-Aug-19 10:46 PM] JonnyBioICX#1730
I do not , it said on waiting list or something previous now nothing ??

[28-Aug-19 11:44 PM] yorklab#7270
I see it on both the computer and my phone. Perhaps you need an invite? You'll have to wait for a team member to find out why you can't see it.

[29-Aug-19 07:37 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
There should be a setting to trade through KMD to any coin from any coin.
. Make KMD default LP - most grandmas wont use the order books. - call it "Grandma Mode" or say trade available with a X% DEX fee.... then do the 3 way swap ...

[29-Aug-19 07:43 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Alice swaps DGB for KMD then KMD to Etherium Bob swaps Etherium for KMD then KMD to DGB...
Something like that......private swaps will not be popular with shit coins

[29-Aug-19 07:45 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Or instead of swapping the first step it could just be a purchace transaction from the LP
