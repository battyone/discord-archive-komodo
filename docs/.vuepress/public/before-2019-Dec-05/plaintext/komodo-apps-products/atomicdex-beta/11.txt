but it's actually not doing it? my tx showed up

[16-Jul-19 02:25 PM] Oszy#5734
ETH orderbook not loading, goes back to previous screen

[16-Jul-19 02:27 PM] SHossain#0007
there seems no ETH orders at the moment

[16-Jul-19 02:27 PM] Oszy#5734
but i should be able to create one?

[16-Jul-19 02:27 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[16-Jul-19 02:27 PM] Oszy#5734
well it doesn't let me do that

[16-Jul-19 02:28 PM] SHossain#0007
actually it's not creating new order for ETH

[16-Jul-19 02:28 PM] SHossain#0007
reproduced

[16-Jul-19 02:28 PM] SHossain#0007
@Kiruel we can't create new order for ETH

[16-Jul-19 02:28 PM] Oszy#5734
I select ETH first, then when I want to select 2nd coin, orderbook starts loading, but goes back to trade screen, so i can't create order against my ETH

[16-Jul-19 02:28 PM] SHossain#0007
with latest version

the app shows order created, but, doesn't show on Orders section

[16-Jul-19 02:32 PM] Oszy#5734
hmmm it worked now

[16-Jul-19 02:38 PM] SHossain#0007
it did? what magic?

[16-Jul-19 02:38 PM] SHossain#0007
i have tried couple of times

[16-Jul-19 02:46 PM] Oszy#5734
yeah, first the coin list did not come up at all, but then it did and shows in my orders now

Trading BCH for KMD it says: not enough funds for fees. In the next versions, could fees be deducted automatically? UX will be better.

[16-Jul-19 03:33 PM] ferjr90#9314
In a RICK/MORTY swap, my screen turned off due to waiting and the swap failed. During swap, AtomicDEX must keep the screen on or the swap stops.

[16-Jul-19 03:36 PM] Oszy#5734
no I did not leave it on in fact i locked the phone and it worked

[16-Jul-19 03:37 PM] Oszy#5734
it must be a phone power saving feature that disconnects it when screen is off?

[16-Jul-19 03:38 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Could be that data turns off when phone locks

[16-Jul-19 03:39 PM] Alecandro#1179
That is definitely something that needs to change. you have to be able to close the app and your order still gets filled. noone is going to want to sit there and wait for an order to fill with their phone open haha

[16-Jul-19 03:40 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I guess it would be similar to how emails or messenger update in the background but they are periodic maybe this would need to be on ft

[16-Jul-19 03:40 PM] wl#4107
How to send feedback?

[16-Jul-19 03:46 PM] 27aume#8635
Hows the testing going? I cant wait to start testing. Wish they find a solution to v0.1.2 soon hihi :abusedsmily: no pressure dho :troll_cool:

[16-Jul-19 03:50 PM] ferjr90#9314
I change the energy saving profile of atomicDEX to none. This time I turned off the screen during a MORTY/RICK swap and it worked fine.

[16-Jul-19 04:00 PM] allbits#5898
Not able to send bch. Says not valid address. However when I copy and paste the exact same address into another mobile wallet it works fine.

[16-Jul-19 04:03 PM] ferjr90#9314
Are you trying to send BCH to AtomicDEX? AtomicDEX uses legacy addresses, not the newer cash format. Which wallet are you using?

[16-Jul-19 04:06 PM] allbits#5898
No. I'm trying to send out of atomicdex to another wallet, using new format

[16-Jul-19 04:07 PM] ferjr90#9314
So I guess you need to use legacy addresses in atomicDEX until cash addresses are implemented. Electron cash have a built-in address converter.

[16-Jul-19 04:09 PM] Mcrypt#4468
app is working now after the update, swap worked also

[16-Jul-19 04:09 PM] SHossain#0007
guys, don't use BTC or BCH trading for this testing

[16-Jul-19 04:10 PM] SHossain#0007
too much you will spend on fees

[16-Jul-19 04:11 PM] ferjr90#9314
I did only a small test. Aren't fees for BCH set at 1 sat/B?

[16-Jul-19 04:11 PM] Mcrypt#4468
and the tade will take forever....

[16-Jul-19 04:11 PM] allbits#5898
Ok

[16-Jul-19 04:11 PM] ferjr90#9314
In my case, BCH/KMD went fine in a few minutes. I guess a block was find quickly.

[16-Jul-19 04:12 PM] Mcrypt#4468
rick&morty trade worked for me also first one in about 3min

[16-Jul-19 04:12 PM] cipi#4502
BCH uses fixed fee of 1000 sats per tx: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins#L2172

next trade took more than 5min. can I switch to another app while the swap is in process?

[16-Jul-19 04:17 PM] ferjr90#9314
@cipi thank you for the feedback, I don't know how large the tx in the BCH chain is but 1000 sats isn't very expensive.

[16-Jul-19 04:18 PM] ferjr90#9314
@Mcrypt Go to the energy saving profile of your phone and disable energy saving for atomicDEX. This way seems to work fine in the background.

[16-Jul-19 04:19 PM] Mcrypt#4468
ah ok thx

[16-Jul-19 04:20 PM] cipi#4502
this is a BCH swap: https://github.com/cipig/coins/blob/master/swaps/BCH-KMD.md
fee was `0.00001000 BCH     0.00 USD`

Yes, swaping in background works once AtomicDEX is set off from energysaving districtions on Android.

[16-Jul-19 04:28 PM] Mark81#4505
Ie. you can watch YouTube while waiting swap to complete.

[16-Jul-19 04:35 PM] ca333#0118
@Mark81 i believe the app should be executing swaps in background anyway - which android version are you using? I will test it to ensure this claim is true.

[16-Jul-19 04:39 PM] jorian#4555
is there any ios beta out yet? all i see is android screenshots

[16-Jul-19 04:46 PM] Mark81#4505

I'm using Android 9 (Pocophone F1) and without changing energy saving profiles AtomicDEX doesn't work on the background

[16-Jul-19 05:04 PM] Oszy#5734
works on S10

[16-Jul-19 05:29 PM] Mark81#4505
Ok so, I have tested it with Sony Xperia xz3 and Nokia 8 and later on worked without tweeking settings.

[16-Jul-19 05:38 PM] Mark81#4505
And Xperia also works in background after changing settings back to default. Weird since I felt that it didn't.

[16-Jul-19 06:06 PM] allbits#5898
Sent out of atomicdex a test amount with bch (using legacy address). Everything went fine. Followed up with a larger amount and this transaction did not show up in target wallet. However it does show on explorer but has stayed with zero confirmations for over an hour

[16-Jul-19 06:07 PM] allbits#5898
Not sure if this is a wallet issue or a blockchain issue

[16-Jul-19 06:10 PM] ferjr90#9314
Seems like a blockchain issue. Most wallets show unconfirmed transactions. Did the transaction showed up after the 1st confirmation?

[16-Jul-19 06:11 PM] allbits#5898
There has been no first confirmation. It stays unconfirmed according to the explorer. And the target wallet does not see the transaction.

[16-Jul-19 06:12 PM] ferjr90#9314
Please, can you post the transaction ID?

[16-Jul-19 06:12 PM] allbits#5898
I will dm the transaction id

[16-Jul-19 06:12 PM] ferjr90#9314
ok

@jorian ios started testing cpl days ago between a few of us.  not top priority.  priority is swap protocol testing publicly.   all other things will be tested (including gui bugs/changes) in coming weeks.  but first, atomic swap on mobile across different networks - wifi/3g/4g/vpn etc.

Not sure if this is the info you are looking for or not, but I've tried KMD to VRSC three times, twice it just hangs on step 0/3, one time it hung on step 1/3.  It seems like its a matched order, but not processing.

[16-Jul-19 07:10 PM] Mylo#8306
yes all failures are valuable.   it might be a simple hosting error on the marketmaker where the admin has taken it offline/moved.   hard to know immediately, but plz - if you have errors.
there's a button in settings -> send feedback which i think sends logs of failures.    phone model, network connection is handy, android version etc. if you know any of those.

The send feedback option in settings asks how you want to send feedback, but I'm not sure what app you would use to send feedback (email, text, discord, etc.).  I can add that info and additional items on the github page

[16-Jul-19 07:52 PM] Sharifa#7849
@Mylo how long does an atomic swap needs to take?

[16-Jul-19 07:52 PM] Mylo#8306
depends on block times.  if it's a blockchain where the block time is 1 minute per block. maybe 4-9 mins usually

[16-Jul-19 07:52 PM] Mylo#8306
sometimes 3 mins

@Mylo comparing the transfer of let's say eth from coinbase to kucoin that requires 
 167 confirmations but nothing on kucoin yet or am i comparing apples to peers?

[16-Jul-19 08:04 PM] Mylo#8306
depends what you want to compare, and i'm being facetious here (warning):
1.  you can deposit your coins on a place that has all sorts of data on you, or you can keep it in your own wallet.
2. you can wait for deposits and kyc, or you can keep it in your wallet
3. you can trade eth to btc to buy any other alt coin, or you can find a direct pair in your pocket.
4.  you can leave your coins on a centralized target, and trust in the security and the employees of somewhere (usually in a foreign country) - or you can keep it in your pocket.
5. you can set an order at a centralized exchange and wait for it to hit/move/dance/whatever, or you can reach into your pocket and set an order in one market, and use the same funds to set an order in another market.  first order to bite, and you're trading.

it's unfair to compare it to centralized tech.   p2p atomic swaps are the best form of trading in many respects.
liquidity is better at a cex, but that is the current day.

an instant exchange like shapeshift or coinswitch, they do maybe 50BTC per day volume.
that sort of volume out of your pocket, and a whole new way of exchange can happen - and not only for crypto-traders.  merchants too...

[16-Jul-19 08:07 PM] Mylo#8306
centralized exchanges and atomic swap dex can also integrate & share order books at an api level.   this part is coming in the future.  some testers of marketmaker have scripts to refill their wallets when needed,.

the aim of the game is liquidity.   then crypto becomes useful.
and with the work being one in #dev-nspv , we're trying to scale lite wallets to millions of users, by optimizing the amount of data required by a client to validate their wallet data.

kind of apples to apples, but then apples to a lot of other possibilities.   p2p atomic swap of personal data, i.e. medical info...  it's only the beginning.   bits on a wire....

[16-Jul-19 08:26 PM] allbits#5898
Also, minor issue - on the BCH wallet page, two transactions are showing as unconfirmed even though they are confirmed.  If I click through to the transactions, proper confirmations are displayed.  I tried turning the app on and off but the issue persists. If anyone wants a screen shot let me know.

[16-Jul-19 08:30 PM] allbits#5898
Sorry I misread that - apoarently, all transactions are showing as unconfirmed on the main bch page. Clicking through to each transaction shows proper confirmations

[16-Jul-19 08:31 PM] allbits#5898
Same thing on kmd wallet page

[16-Jul-19 08:34 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
is there gonna be a site listing all the available orders on atomicdex?
