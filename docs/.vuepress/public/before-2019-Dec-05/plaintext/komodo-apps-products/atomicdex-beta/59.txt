just looking into things

[09-Sep-19 05:08 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Two different systems.

[09-Sep-19 05:09 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You can have your own GUI and choose what coins you want to add, or pay for integration into the reference client.

[09-Sep-19 05:13 AM] dm312#9176
interesting

[09-Sep-19 05:14 AM] dm312#9176
I am looking for low fee trades

[09-Sep-19 05:16 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Oh you were asking about trading fees.  Komodo is 0.13%  only on the buyer side,  seller side is no fee

[09-Sep-19 05:18 AM] dm312#9176
Only problem, the dex is not ready

[09-Sep-19 05:18 AM] dm312#9176
Still in beta

[09-Sep-19 05:19 AM] dm312#9176
I want to be able to get the best fees for coins

[09-Sep-19 05:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
It's actually ready to download and try out right now.

[09-Sep-19 05:52 AM] dm312#9176
Is that on iPhone or computer

[09-Sep-19 05:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
android via play store and ios via it's testflight app

[09-Sep-19 05:53 AM] dm312#9176
Ah, I don‚Äôt have TestFlight on iOS

[09-Sep-19 05:53 AM] dm312#9176
But I could use emulator on computer

[09-Sep-19 05:54 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Can get TestFlight easily

[09-Sep-19 05:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
you can dl the testflight app from the app store

[09-Sep-19 05:54 AM] dm312#9176
True no email though

[09-Sep-19 05:55 AM] dm312#9176
Too lazy to do that now

[09-Sep-19 05:55 AM] dm312#9176
Is it fully functional or test net?

[09-Sep-19 05:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
fully functional, large trades are not recommended due to being in beta stage testing however

[09-Sep-19 05:57 AM] dm312#9176
Understandable. I‚Äôm not a big trader though

[09-Sep-19 05:57 AM] dm312#9176
How easy is it to add a coin?

[09-Sep-19 05:59 AM] dm312#9176
Like could Steem be added for instance?

[09-Sep-19 06:07 AM] actionslacks#4072
All coins that are built on the BTC and ETH core software can be added to Atomic Dex

[09-Sep-19 06:10 AM] actionslacks#4072
You can see the currently supported coins here, more will be added on a case by case basis.  https://atomicdex.io/

No withdrawal limits or fees, because there are no withdrawals. And no handing over your name and address to centralized exchanges, who get hacked regularly.

Just download the latest AtomicDEX via Test Flight. Freezes at the Seed page (after you've named the wallet). Can copy seed and generate new seed but there's no button to press to say I've written it down and to move onto the next step.

@justpip Is this green "next" button doesn't reflect on your device?

[09-Sep-19 11:14 AM] TonyL#3577
if no - could you please name your iphone model?

[09-Sep-19 11:15 AM] justpip#5610
@TonyL No. It's definitely not there. The bottom of the screen ends before the button and it's impossible to scroll down. Model is iPhone SE / Software version 12.4.1

[09-Sep-19 11:16 AM] TonyL#3577
I see, thank you for report! Will test on Iphone SE

[09-Sep-19 11:39 AM] TonyL#3577
@mobipoi could you please use "Settings" -> "Send feedback" to DM me the log file? Also are you availiable for a short debug session with adb logs collecting or maybe familiar with this tool? Thanks in advance!

@TonyL I suspected that might be the reason. just confirmed that yes, that's was the case. I was using the segit address from the wallet. now gonna try with p2sh address

Hi, I can't see my orders... I'd like to cancel them.

[09-Sep-19 02:16 PM] richardt#2807
I just tried doing a KMD to BTC swap.  It got to 2/3 steps and did not complete, but the KMD never got returned to me.
Swap ID:  075a067a-9d0c-4239-9175-6606ae1d0a8a

[09-Sep-19 02:20 PM] richardt#2807
Looks like the KMD got sent to another address that does not belong to me
TX ID:  c549ca6046211698b15fba1f5c2544e022cdd03f29fafd33373e86172bc2c923

[09-Sep-19 02:21 PM] richardt#2807
Major bug or did I do something wrong?

[09-Sep-19 02:22 PM] gcharang#6833
@TonyL looks like maker claimed the KMD ( e41c1e8fea2783a66eeb84c03a5924ddedfb03ea0f898d5df0abbbddf6df1e6d 
) but taker didn't receive BTC ?

[09-Sep-19 02:24 PM] TonyL#3577
There might be various reasons of failed swap on different stages, please submit it via form in pinned messages and I‚Äôll check as soon as will be with PC

[09-Sep-19 02:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Funds were sent to swap multisig address in this transaction so they safe

[09-Sep-19 02:24 PM] dudezmobi#1945
@richardt  happened to me before, it will return eventually

[09-Sep-19 02:25 PM] dudezmobi#1945
in about an hour

[09-Sep-19 02:25 PM] dudezmobi#1945
just open your atomicdex

[09-Sep-19 02:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, taker payment will be automatically refunded from b address after timeout if swap will not continue

[09-Sep-19 02:26 PM] TonyL#3577
@wl Hi! On what platform are you? Why do you think that your orders still there?

[09-Sep-19 02:26 PM] richardt#2807
I did the swap over 6 hours ago.  Is the return process done manually or is it automated?

[09-Sep-19 02:27 PM] dudezmobi#1945
that is issue #55

[09-Sep-19 02:27 PM] dudezmobi#1945
open your atomicdex

[09-Sep-19 02:28 PM] richardt#2807
I've opened it multiple times since swap failed.  Don't see any returns

[09-Sep-19 02:28 PM] dudezmobi#1945

maybe the maker got it?

@AkiraX in my understanding it's not easy task to atomicswap arrr because of this chain private nature. In general more coins will be added eventually after app evolution to release version from current beta state.

[10-Sep-19 04:05 AM] TonyL#3577
`Next AtomicDex Beta for iOS will be downloaded via App Store, not Testflight, correct ?` - during the beta - Testflight, after release - App Store. At the moment app is in open beta stage so testflight link availiable to anyone interested in testing.
