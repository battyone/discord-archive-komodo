If you generate a new addrwss for each transaction you would need to move those funds to the new address which costs transaction fees. Therefore not practical.

@BobZilla I'll ask about the form, I haven't used it in a bit.

[30-Oct-19 03:05 AM] BobZilla#8096
I am not the guy who speaks for teh project but the lead dev did ask me to find someone to talk too about it

[30-Oct-19 03:05 AM] Regnar#6164
Form should be up in 24 hours @BobZilla

[30-Oct-19 03:06 AM] BobZilla#8096
OK thanks guys ,, we will use the form and go through normal channels hopefully we can get somethig cooking,, i love the wallet BTW,,

I am going to be playing in teh halloween styres test too üòâ

[30-Oct-19 03:06 AM] dingles#0920
So workflow: Send BTC to AtomicDex wallet, trade, retrieve BTC from AtomicDex. Now you would need to delete the wallet and create a new one?

[30-Oct-19 03:07 AM] dingles#0920
Before sending BTC back to AtomicDex?

[30-Oct-19 03:07 AM] PTYX#6840
If you didn't want to use the same trading address then yes, you create a new "profile"

[30-Oct-19 03:08 AM] PTYX#6840
The purpose of the dex is to facilitate P2P trading. Creating change addresses for each transaction seems irrelevant to that end.

[30-Oct-19 03:08 AM] PTYX#6840
Sure, change addresses improve pseudoanonimity but you can withdraw to an unused btc address and accomplish the same thing since the transactions can be traced back to the origin regardless

[30-Oct-19 03:09 AM] dingles#0920
Fair enough. Seems very clunky. Like there should be a refresh address/wallet button or something.

[30-Oct-19 03:09 AM] PTYX#6840
Possibly it would cater to users like you but that's not the majority

[30-Oct-19 03:10 AM] PTYX#6840
90% is users don't want to pay fees to create new change addresses.

[30-Oct-19 03:11 AM] PTYX#6840
Atomicdex is multi account. So you can have different seeds/addresses if you wish.

[30-Oct-19 03:13 AM] dingles#0920
Yes. I get that. It **is** the difference between being able to use AtomicDex as a wallet and using it as just a quick dip exchange. Since it looks like a wallet and is being promoted as a wallet it seems odd that a key wallet feature (that really should be enabled by default if someone is going to use this as a wallet) would be missing.

[30-Oct-19 03:15 AM] dingles#0920
Still the best exchange out there, but it is concerning to me that new addresses are not implemented when it is pretty obvious that people will use this as their main wallet

[30-Oct-19 03:15 AM] PTYX#6840
Does coinomi and testwallet create change addresses?

[30-Oct-19 03:15 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
The¬†bitcoin¬†blockchain is a public¬†ledger¬†that records¬†bitcoin¬†transactions. - I found that on google - I must be missing something

[30-Oct-19 03:15 AM] PTYX#6840
Do most end-user wallets? Nope. Native wallets do.

[30-Oct-19 03:16 AM] PTYX#6840
Ledger does but again, this seems like something a minority of the users would like and not a requirement to fulfill the purpose of the dex.

[30-Oct-19 03:16 AM] dingles#0920
That could be my disconnect here. I have only used native wallets to date.

[30-Oct-19 03:16 AM] Regnar#6164
Generating a new address when you click receive and implementing change addresses is **not** the same

[30-Oct-19 03:16 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I heard coinomi is really secure - lol

[30-Oct-19 03:17 AM] PTYX#6840
If you've only used native wallets then this seems like a personal preference. Most lite wallets offer one address per seed for ease of use.

[30-Oct-19 03:18 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I suppose you could create multiple seeds

[30-Oct-19 03:18 AM] PTYX#6840
Yes he can create multiple profiles

[30-Oct-19 03:19 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Ohhhh he's talking about multiple ....what you call ems

[30-Oct-19 03:19 AM] PTYX#6840
But atomicdex is in beta phase and right now focus lies on DEX protocol and improving the DEX core layer and multi-protocol support. And towards end of the beta program the team will certainly look into Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet capability with the desired BIP32 key derivation logic.

[30-Oct-19 03:21 AM] dingles#0920
That is good to hear. I was even wondering if it had something to do with atomic trades and not splitting utxos. Like I said, it is not obvious why this was missing or if I was simply not looking in the right spot and there is currently no public documentation to find out.

[30-Oct-19 03:22 AM] PTYX#6840
It's not economic

[30-Oct-19 03:22 AM] PTYX#6840
Think about it, if you have 1 btc and make a trade for 0.1, now you have to move the rest to a change address

[30-Oct-19 03:22 AM] PTYX#6840
That takes more transaction fees unless you trade the full amount and the change lands on the new address.

[30-Oct-19 03:25 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Couldn't the transaction still be traced to the other address?

[30-Oct-19 03:26 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Just tell people it's not your address lol

[30-Oct-19 03:27 AM] PTYX#6840
Yup

[30-Oct-19 03:27 AM] PTYX#6840
Transactions are fully traceable to the change addresses. So in theory there isn't an improvement by adding that function

[30-Oct-19 03:27 AM] PTYX#6840
It's better to withdraw funds to an unrelated address

[30-Oct-19 03:27 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Go see the future @dingles

[30-Oct-19 03:29 AM] dingles#0920
@PTYX So are you saying that the transaction fees are cheaper if you do send to the current unlock hash? I don‚Äôt see how that would make a difference

[30-Oct-19 03:32 AM] dingles#0920
Wouldn‚Äôt you just have a pool of unlock hashes that you could spend from in your wallet and create a multi-tx spend with a targeted unlock hash (to whom you‚Äôre trading with) and then the left overs are sent to your new unlock hash?

[30-Oct-19 03:34 AM] dingles#0920
That should not cost any more than creating a singleton-tx spend with a targeted unlock hast (to whom you‚Äôre trading with) and then sending the leftovers back to your current unlock hash.

[30-Oct-19 03:36 AM] dingles#0920
Maybe you are forgetting that you always need to move the left overs to a specified unlock hash no mater what, even if it is going back to the same unlock hash.

[30-Oct-19 03:38 AM] PTYX#6840
If you have multiple utxos in the address that becomes more difficult. Your explanation seems overly complex compared to the current logic.

[30-Oct-19 03:39 AM] PTYX#6840
I don't think changing the logic of the atomicdex is high priority at the moment.

[30-Oct-19 03:39 AM] PTYX#6840
I'm sure if there's a more efficient way of doing it, the team will look into it.

[30-Oct-19 03:40 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Woah... @dingles got some game tho

[30-Oct-19 03:41 AM] dingles#0920
Maybe there is something with the atomic swap timelocks that do not play nicely with multi-tx transactions though? If so, it would be interesting to know that this is a technical limitation and not a ui limitation.

[30-Oct-19 03:46 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I'm sure the "hand shake" would have to know more information than that already exist taking more time to verify the swap from the p2sh timelock address(es)+(es) - kinda like pole vaulting over mouse turds

[30-Oct-19 03:47 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I've been known to be wrong

[30-Oct-19 03:49 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
It would be better to talk at #dev-marketmaker

[30-Oct-19 03:49 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Not a UI issue

[30-Oct-19 03:52 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
MM2 / iquana handle all that core shit

[30-Oct-19 03:53 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
It would be a new API that would be used by GUI builders -

[30-Oct-19 03:55 AM] dingles#0920
Thanks for the feedback and insight. I‚Äôll read through some atomic swap examples and that GUI builders API first to see if I can understand why multiple unlock hashes would cause an issue.

[30-Oct-19 03:55 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I see the plausibility.... dont know how hard to code that into the swap process

[30-Oct-19 03:57 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
The logic code will be seen in MM2 - I'm sure someone has the github link over at #dev-marketmaker

[30-Oct-19 04:06 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

it is a false sense of privacy, to use different change addresses. the only valid reason is much better resistance against quantum computers. the downside is that it would become UNUSABLE in lite mode due to the overhead of having to query all the addresses. so given the tradeoff off being unusable vs. subject to attack from QC, the choice was obvious. If you want actual privacy, use PIRATE. another benefit of reusing addresses is that over time reputations can be established

Is that possible in Atomic Dex, so putting KMD for sale @ $ 1,50 or something and never have to look back untill i get a message the order went through

[30-Oct-19 09:14 AM] CoinKing88#1540
While keeping it off CEX so it's safe all the time

confirming, anything larger than 9999 gets deleted from the text box

using max amount and deleting off numbers doesn't help either as "X" deletes full amount not just lat digit

any coin

It would be good if a hint appears in the trade window during a swap that says you shouldn't lock the screen and disconnect the internet connection - helpful for iPhone users.

[30-Oct-19 05:23 PM] Mark81#4505
Also one note when picking coins to trade on dex window. If you have set amount for specific base pair and choose another base pair then earlier choosed amount goes to new pair also. I think for safety it would be wise to reset amounts to zero always when changing base pair.

There is the option to register your Discord username to an address. If you'd like to do so, please DM me the details - you'll also need to confirm address ownership via a small RICK Morty transaction to my address (which will be returned with a bonus). 
For the privacy conscious, if you want to register your Discord name, but redact the address, this can also be arranged üïµüèΩ
