it means that you should have already received RICK to `RBvMpFRcPq6mpMsMf5jNX6iCe5VKLYxnoB`if this is your address
90877a9ed6d293ed5957058ee4d1439b4e164da393d3f208f654a7a8a5cd20c5 - god dont make my type in another tx ever again üòÑ

[29-Oct-19 08:48 PM] kmd.dex#8716
ok

[29-Oct-19 08:48 PM] kmd.dex#8716

[29-Oct-19 08:49 PM] Oszy#5734
this was your outgoing MORTY tx: https://morty.kmd.dev/tx/e8ae365a3b0e1530465ea11a652389ef626e850e6d46ff9f4062aa9bb13e7af9

[29-Oct-19 08:49 PM] Oszy#5734
and the incoming RICK: https://rick.kmd.dev/tx/90877a9ed6d293ed5957058ee4d1439b4e164da393d3f208f654a7a8a5cd20c5

[29-Oct-19 08:50 PM] Oszy#5734
I think you might have clicked or touched the `unlock funds` button

[29-Oct-19 08:50 PM] Oszy#5734
and that's why it says payment was already spent

[29-Oct-19 08:50 PM] Oszy#5734

pls put this link om atomicdex website and i to the app

[29-Oct-19 09:25 PM] Oszy#5734
this is unofficial a member made it. there will be visible orderbook in the app

[29-Oct-19 09:25 PM] kmd.dex#8716
nicee

[29-Oct-19 09:27 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@kmd.dex  also take into consideration that there is no deposit wait like there is with proxy dex

[29-Oct-19 09:33 PM] kmd.dex#8716
I dont get why I  got many failed trades. is between  rick and morty

[29-Oct-19 09:34 PM] kmd.dex#8716
but why is failing ?

[29-Oct-19 09:47 PM] coingirl87#6489
The app has to be open during the whole swap process?

@Admin  I would like a notification that signals me that a partner has been found to trade and is waiting for confirmation. That would greatly increase the trading experience, in my opinion.

[29-Oct-19 11:27 PM] richardt#2807
@vogelfreund88 That's a great idea.  Making it into a more social thing to do swaps would add more alure to the app.  Afterall, it is peer to peer.

[29-Oct-19 11:28 PM] richardt#2807
Eventually, having the ability to chat, make offers back and forth, etc. would be pretty cool

[29-Oct-19 11:45 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
is Monero going to be added to the DEX?

[29-Oct-19 11:47 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not anytime soon

[29-Oct-19 11:48 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
is it possilbe?

[29-Oct-19 11:49 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
compatible ?

[29-Oct-19 11:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It‚Äôs possible just a lot of work and not a big priority however if some cryptonight coin wants to do the dev work to make it work I‚Äôm sure we would add it

post your address and I'm sure a generous KMD member will send you some

[30-Oct-19 02:22 AM] dingles#0920
Whenever I open up a wallet in the portfolio and click receive I get the same wallet address. Am I missing something? Because this is insecure. The correct way to do it is to generate a new receive address every time.

@dingles  what coin ?

[30-Oct-19 02:24 AM] dingles#0920
So far I have tested this on the Komodo, Bitcoin, Rick, and Morty wallet addresses.

[30-Oct-19 02:26 AM] dingles#0920
I would assume that either I am not looking in the right spot for the setting, this is an over site on Komodo‚Äôs part, or there is a technical limitation as to why they chose not to correctly implement this.

[30-Oct-19 02:26 AM] kmd.dex#8716
u only got 1 address for those coinz

[30-Oct-19 02:34 AM] dingles#0920
You should get infinite. And you should always throw away an address after you spend from it

[30-Oct-19 02:35 AM] dingles#0920
Ie. it is typically insecure to send coins to an address that you have already spent from

[30-Oct-19 02:47 AM] dingles#0920
Anyhow, in it‚Äôs current implementation it seems very risky to keep more than a token amount of bitcoin in the AtomicDex bitcoin wallet. üò¢

[30-Oct-19 02:51 AM] Regnar#6164
@dingles this is a beta. You shouldn't be storing large amounts in this at the moment anyway

[30-Oct-19 02:52 AM] dingles#0920
Right, but if it leaves beta without this feature then that holds true too. It seems like a security concern such as this should have been addressed in the MVP

[30-Oct-19 02:55 AM] dingles#0920
@kmdkrazy That is one of the issues. It acts to uncloak how much BTC a wallet has

Put all your money in Pirate Coin

[30-Oct-19 02:58 AM] dingles#0920
The other issue is that it leaks a little bit of data that would make that specific unlock hash more susceptible to a quantum attack.

[30-Oct-19 02:59 AM] dingles#0920
And it is seemingly a simple ui issue. Granted there may be underlying issues as to why Komodo did this. If so, that should be explained in the ui

[30-Oct-19 03:00 AM] Regnar#6164
all those addresses, if it generated new one's each time, would be based on the same seed, just a different derivation path. Even a Hardware wallet (like Ledger, or Trezor) does this. It's all the same seed.

[30-Oct-19 03:00 AM] dingles#0920
@Regnar Yes, that is the proper way to do it

[30-Oct-19 03:01 AM] Regnar#6164
No. What I'm saying is there is no security benefit to doing that.

[30-Oct-19 03:01 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[30-Oct-19 03:02 AM] Regnar#6164
Making multiple addresses with the same seed but different derivation path does nothing for security.

Even bitcoin.org recommends this

[30-Oct-19 03:03 AM] PTYX#6840
@dingles a user can simply withdraw their funds to a different btc address after they are done with a swap. It's not a "security risk"

[30-Oct-19 03:04 AM] BobZilla#8096
SO teh form will be back up tomorrow or so ?

@PTYX That is not how it will be used though.
