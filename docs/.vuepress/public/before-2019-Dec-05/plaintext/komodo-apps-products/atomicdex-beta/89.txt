[31-Oct-19 11:30 AM] farl#9964

[31-Oct-19 11:30 AM] gigamesh#3544
1.000.000,00 is dumbass

[31-Oct-19 11:30 AM] alperC#7758
oh no wait

[31-Oct-19 11:31 AM] alperC#7758
The second one is correct üòÑ

[31-Oct-19 11:31 AM] farl#9964
My iPhone can only give me a comma when typing in a number in DEX. So it's makes it even more confusing

[31-Oct-19 11:31 AM] gigamesh#3544
hold on ... when is 12PM?

[31-Oct-19 11:31 AM] gigamesh#3544
LOLOL

[31-Oct-19 11:31 AM] alperC#7758
in 29 minutes

[31-Oct-19 11:31 AM] gigamesh#3544
cant tell the time, cant count. im screwed

[31-Oct-19 11:31 AM] Alright#0419
@Sir Seven are you sure about this? `no matter the role Taker or Maker, swap counts.`

[31-Oct-19 11:31 AM] Alright#0419
believe stats site doesn't work like that...

[31-Oct-19 11:31 AM] gigamesh#3544
@alperC was only kidding

[31-Oct-19 11:32 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@Alright Hm. I doubt there's difference. Not 100% sure tho.

[31-Oct-19 11:32 AM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator ?

[31-Oct-19 11:32 AM] gigamesh#3544
who will place orders when they r all filled?

[31-Oct-19 11:33 AM] gigamesh#3544
if order fills dont count?

[31-Oct-19 11:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm rick and morty shows 0 balance each now,

[31-Oct-19 11:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
think spv problem?

[31-Oct-19 11:35 AM] gigamesh#3544
... and so it begins?

[31-Oct-19 11:36 AM] Yaconx#4625
This is pretty crap. Still can‚Äôt get any Rick to be able to participate in this stress test. Disappointing Komodo üòû

[31-Oct-19 11:37 AM] gigamesh#3544
@Yaconx was ok for me, try it again?

[31-Oct-19 11:38 AM] vanity33#9778
hi there, i followed all he steps and got 7.777 Morty but the Rick didn't come through

[31-Oct-19 11:39 AM] vanity33#9778
though the transaction was completed

[31-Oct-19 11:39 AM] gigamesh#3544
i had to try RICK twice

[31-Oct-19 11:39 AM] Yaconx#4625
I‚Äôve tried multiple times over the last two hours I‚Äôve had enough but I‚Äôll try again although it is extremely frustrating

[31-Oct-19 11:40 AM] alperC#7758
@vanity33 just claimed another Rick, works fine on my end

[31-Oct-19 11:40 AM] Sir Seven#7158

[31-Oct-19 11:40 AM] alperC#7758
You can claim every 5 minutes

[31-Oct-19 11:40 AM] gigamesh#3544

android

[31-Oct-19 11:41 AM] CrisF#3405
HI @Yaconx , frustrating for sure.  Things are getting very busy and that's the purpose of the stress test.
Maybe you can help find a bug.

[31-Oct-19 11:41 AM] vanity33#9778
now it worked

[31-Oct-19 11:41 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@Cryptoon 
Might be spv, please try to restart app.

[31-Oct-19 11:41 AM] gigamesh#3544
19 minutes

[31-Oct-19 11:42 AM] CrisF#3405
If you still have trouble after trying SirSeven's suggestion pls let us know.

[31-Oct-19 11:42 AM] farl#9964
After I restart the app I need to add RICK and MORTY again

[31-Oct-19 11:43 AM] Hooftly#1337
I cant seem to get RICK faucet to send.  it says it send but never shows up and when I go to check the explore there is a cert error that wont let me visit.

[31-Oct-19 11:43 AM] Yaconx#4625
Ok finally I‚Äôve got some Rick although it says unconfirmed so should I wait some more before starting swap

[31-Oct-19 11:44 AM] gigamesh#3544
comp still hasnt started guys

[31-Oct-19 11:44 AM] gigamesh#3544
17 minutes

[31-Oct-19 11:44 AM] Hooftly#1337
ok so im not the only one having issues getting Rick?

[31-Oct-19 11:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok works fine after restarting @Sir Seven, thanks for the suggestion!

[31-Oct-19 11:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Hooftly , there are some messages above about it.

[31-Oct-19 11:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Also using my phone to tether my connection to laptop atm, will stop doing that once the comp starts üòÑ

[31-Oct-19 11:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Same for me, restart of phone after changing settins (vpn) worked. trade going through now @Sir Seven

[31-Oct-19 11:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Another pro-tip, disable auto sleep mode on phone, so your phone doesnt lock up after not touching it for 10 sec or whatever

[31-Oct-19 11:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm counting Taker (alice) side

[31-Oct-19 11:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
last chance to register name for leaderboard

[31-Oct-19 11:47 AM] Hooftly#1337
@CrisF so just keep trying then?  didnt read a solution just people getting lucky

[31-Oct-19 11:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Hooftly it took 10 minutes between using faucet and it arriving in wallet. someone is spamming faucet causing it to have a backlog.

yes normal @RNI

[31-Oct-19 11:56 AM] vanity33#9778
for some reason after i restarted the app the Morty balance went to 0

[31-Oct-19 11:56 AM] vanity33#9778
Morty just dissapeared

[31-Oct-19 11:57 AM] gigamesh#3544
i guess i wont be restarting the app then

[31-Oct-19 11:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I have a weird problem, either Rick or Morty balance shows up

[31-Oct-19 11:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Not both

[31-Oct-19 11:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
When restarting the other one shows

[31-Oct-19 11:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Problem with connection on my side?

[31-Oct-19 11:57 AM] gigamesh#3544
i suspect KMD nodes overloaded

[31-Oct-19 11:57 AM] vanity33#9778
that could be my problem also as i can see the correct Rick balance

[31-Oct-19 11:58 AM] kastmada#2688
it's fillig up only 1:1 orders to me

[31-Oct-19 11:58 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@Cryptoon You mean you need to enable coin? Or you have no balance?

[31-Oct-19 11:58 AM] ca333#0118
sent @Hooftly

[31-Oct-19 11:58 AM] vanity33#9778
it shows 0 Morty

[31-Oct-19 11:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I have everything enabled, but one time I see 0 morty but 7.777 rick, and then I restart and I see 7.777 morty but 0 Rick

[31-Oct-19 11:59 AM] vanity33#9778
when before it was showing 7.777

[31-Oct-19 11:59 AM] vanity33#9778
