I have like 10 orders open. Is it good to keep them or should I cancel them?

[31-Oct-19 02:17 PM] TonyL#3577
It's better to cancel em and try one by one as adviced in second pinned post

[31-Oct-19 02:17 PM] shrk#2280
@ETcrypt what amount?

[31-Oct-19 02:18 PM] Pwnz#4150
@Gordon Freeman cancel after 20-30 seconds each after you've tried

[31-Oct-19 02:19 PM] Mark81#4505
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  are swaps on net id 9999 only accounted?

[31-Oct-19 02:19 PM] ETcrypt#3306
0.5 morty to 0.5 rick

[31-Oct-19 02:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yes

[31-Oct-19 02:19 PM] CryptoBrandon#9277
I tried 0.02 Rick to 0.02 Morty , not going thru

[31-Oct-19 02:21 PM] vanity33#9778

[31-Oct-19 02:21 PM] vanity33#9778

[31-Oct-19 02:21 PM] CryptoBrandon#9277
It's getting frustrating

[31-Oct-19 02:21 PM] shrk#2280
I tried about 50 times with different amonuts ü§ì

[31-Oct-19 02:23 PM] Pwnz#4150

At this rate nobody will hit 30 swap barrierüòä

[31-Oct-19 02:23 PM] 27aume#8635

[31-Oct-19 02:24 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590

Not work

[31-Oct-19 02:25 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@27aume if matched quickly to a selected orderbook entry, probably taker. if taker, address should show up on leaderboard.

[31-Oct-19 02:25 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
someone has 7 now ;/

[31-Oct-19 02:26 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if swapping rick - morty, you;d be a maker on one and a taker on the other so either way you should register a swap

[31-Oct-19 02:26 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you can see in logs too, but its a bit more work

[31-Oct-19 02:27 PM] jspook16#3059
Anyone else see the KMD Morty order?

[31-Oct-19 02:37 PM] V__C#6587
Has anyone had any Rick and Morty confirmed received?
Neither of mine have after 2hrs

[31-Oct-19 02:37 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
No....actually I think the order book is locked up from some user leaving their phone on all night and getting spammed

[31-Oct-19 02:38 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
It's a good test

@JaNuS welcome on board üí©

[31-Oct-19 02:43 PM] jspook16#3059
I dont think it's a bottleneck. I think the orderbook goes in and out too much. I can see it go from like 148 orders available to like 8 and back and forth

[31-Oct-19 02:43 PM] vanity33#9778
swap failed

[31-Oct-19 02:43 PM] kastmada#2688
@jspook16 yeah, I also noticed that

[31-Oct-19 02:43 PM] jspook16#3059
Maybe better luck on wifi

[31-Oct-19 02:43 PM] Jaki#9826
