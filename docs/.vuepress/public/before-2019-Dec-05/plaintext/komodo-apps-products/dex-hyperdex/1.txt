Bug? Requested data should list: Buy: 5 BEER For: 5200 PIZZA Price 10500 PIZZA

[28-May-18 03:43 PM] maegus#0000
Not a bug

[28-May-18 03:45 PM] maegus#0000
That's how the automated matchmaking works. You don't alwasy get your requested size if the UTXO's for it don't exist. But you will get your requested ratio or better.

[28-May-18 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#0000
You exchanged 1 beer... at the top
then on the left part of the table it says  pizza

[28-May-18 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I never got time to make a git hub issue for this.

[28-May-18 03:45 PM] maegus#0000
oh is it?

[28-May-18 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#0000
no I think this is a bug, I found it too

[28-May-18 03:45 PM] maegus#0000
This is what makes it whale resistant.

[28-May-18 03:45 PM] maegus#0000
oh wait yea thats way off 5 pizza for 10k beer did a 1 beer for 10k pizza

[28-May-18 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Figured someone else would lol

when buying (green btn), results are ok. bug shows up only when selling (red btn)

<@U02PH4RHZ> are all tokens on Bartedex available on Hyperdex or do you have to add them to releases?

<@U033SL06X> <@U5Z26MP60> <@U8WFL9AMU> it‚Äôs due to the way `marketmaker` handles sell orders. Basically sell orders don‚Äôt exist, everything is a buy. If we tell mm to place a sell it just flips the values and places a buy on the inverse pair

[28-May-18 11:08 PM] lukechilds123#0000
It is technically correct, we are displaying the correct trade data according to mm

[28-May-18 11:08 PM] lukechilds123#0000
but I agree it is confusing

You can see the discussion there why we chose to display it like we are

[28-May-18 11:12 PM] lukechilds123#0000
TLDR; it would be possible to show these as sell order in the way you expect, but we decided against that because it would literally mean showing incorrect data, just because it‚Äôs more intuitive.

an excerpt from the issue

[28-May-18 11:12 PM] lukechilds123#0000
>We obviously want to hide as much of the complexity as possible from the user, but completely faking the order book value just to make it seem more intuitive is too far IMO. As far as marketmaker is concerned KMD/REVS orders are not REVS/KMD orders.

[28-May-18 11:14 PM] lukechilds123#0000
If you think this is the wrong choice and we should fake the trading pair buy/sell action for usability, feel free to make your case over on the GitHub issue, it will get lost in Slack

[29-May-18 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#0000
<@U7B8VF6TB> I think its fine to leave it like that as the top of the trade shows correct, but it also seems very confusing the first time its encountered. My self, with BarterDEX GUI once I got use to flipping pairs, I always did it that way so I was always buying and the price was always the larger number, so I didnt have to deal with huge decimals. But it took weeks of playing around and making mistakes to get used to it. As far as I am aware you are already flipping pairs to always be Alice anyway in hyperDEX so maybe you should just inverse these numbers. 1/x should work fine, thats  the formula I used to flip pairs and never went wrong using it.

[29-May-18 04:40 AM] lukechilds123#0000
We don‚Äôt flip any pairs and you are always Alice anyway

[29-May-18 04:40 AM] lukechilds123#0000
it was misleading because in the API docs there are buy and sell commands

[29-May-18 04:40 AM] lukechilds123#0000
so we built the exchange with buy/sell functionality

[29-May-18 04:41 AM] lukechilds123#0000
but after testing it a bit more and wondering why we were getting weird responses from sell commands we realised that mm was just inverting the pair and changing them to buys

[29-May-18 04:41 AM] lukechilds123#0000
had we known that from the start we‚Äôd probably of only added buy functionality and required the user to flip the pair to ‚Äúsell‚Äù

[29-May-18 04:42 AM] lukechilds123#0000
but to clarify, we don‚Äôt change any data at all

[29-May-18 04:42 AM] lukechilds123#0000
we send the user input direct to mm

[29-May-18 04:42 AM] lukechilds123#0000
and display the mm output directly in the UI

[29-May-18 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#0000
ok no worries. Better docs were always a must, I tried to make some a few times, but things kept changing so fast I just gave up.

[29-May-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I think @Alright is doing it now though.

[29-May-18 05:21 AM] imylomylo#0000
yep <@U8MLQ662K> is on the case and has plenty of experience with mm.   new kmd team member <@U9LBB4CTG> also working on collating docs.  <@U02QSHX81> has a pretty good idea of what is going on in that regard coming from a testers background and is the QA/Support keeping an eye on progress.

[29-May-18 08:55 AM] jansako#0000
<@U7B8VF6TB> I was on a va(work)cation for a couple of weeks, just lurking mostly. 
I am inclined to think that if the 'Requested' and 'Broadcast' entries are so different, maybe the 'Requested' entry (which shows 'incorrect' ) should not be shown at all? Then all you have is the 'Broadcast' and 'Executed' side, and once it is made clear in help/documentation that the 'broadcast' side will be always a bit different from what the user enters into the trade request boxes and why, the whole issue just goes away. 
Same goes for the 'The executed price was 4% cheaper than requested' line. A nice marketing touch, but kinda defeats the purpose if in 50% of the cases it shows an incorrect value üôÇ. 
The related github issues are closed, but I am happy to add my thoughts if <@U8MLQ662K> is making a new one.
Thanks guys!

[29-May-18 09:42 AM] lukechilds123#0000

[29-May-18 10:59 AM] phideas#0000
Executed trade is correct, so no big issue. But the displayed "requested" info is wrong. It should be simply fixed on UI level. I wouldn't remove it entirely b/c it is very useful.

[29-May-18 03:37 PM] jansako#0000
the 'simply fixed on the UI level' is the real issue here üôÇ. It would require a design decision to start 'interpreting' MM data instead of simply displaying it as is done now. There are very valid arguments for doing it and not doing it as well. 
Like I said above, I tend to go for axing a feature, even if just temporarily, if I can't implement it correctly...

hey guys, quick question: i'm running hyperdex now and i can't submit a resting order i.e. my orders either get completed, unmatched or pending

yes that is normal

Nah we're sticking with the cjdowner pack because it works really well with our UI and the icon styles are consistent

[31-May-18 03:20 AM] lukechilds123#0000
Is the issue that DNR isn't supported?

[31-May-18 03:20 AM] lukechilds123#0000

[31-May-18 03:39 AM] sindresorhus#0000
<@U74LJ2PQX> Yeah, that would be the fastest way to get it included. You can see the guide here: https://github.com/cjdowner/cryptocurrency-icons/wiki We'll pull it into HyperDEX as soon as it's merged into the cryptocurrency-icons project.

[31-May-18 05:36 AM] manfromaus#0000
You know how we keep describing the basics of how bdex/jhyperdex/mm work as an auction

[31-May-18 05:36 AM] manfromaus#0000
might be worth coming up with a tagline for hyperdex that states something like that

[31-May-18 05:36 AM] manfromaus#0000
to begin getting it through people's heads

[31-May-18 05:38 AM] manfromaus#0000
as the vast majority will assume his product works the same way a coinbase or gemini works. Where it works more like minute-by-minute auctioning

[31-May-18 05:38 AM] manfromaus#0000
ebay moreso than NYSE

[31-May-18 05:53 AM] lukechilds123#0000
Knowing what I know now about how mm works, I don‚Äôt think an exchange style UI was the best choice

[31-May-18 05:54 AM] lukechilds123#0000
I think a shapeshift style UI is much better suited to mm functionality

[31-May-18 05:55 AM] lukechilds123#0000
which we will be focusing on once we‚Äôve got the remaining features/bugs done with the exchange UI

[31-May-18 02:18 PM] dan#0000
Yeah maybe abstract away the steps a bit would be simpler. Either it works or it doesn't

[31-May-18 03:01 PM] siddhartha-komodo#0000
<@U7B8VF6TB> earlier, while I was working with <@U2GC2GXTP>, I did some quick mockups of a more shapeshift/exodus UX/UI approach. It wasn't anything finalized, but may be useful to take a look at. Interested?

[31-May-18 03:13 PM] dan#0000
I think it's hard to get away from steps even in gui form because if something goes wrong   it's nice to let the user know visually where they're at in the process. But maybe it can be hidden in advanced view.

[31-May-18 06:23 PM] utrumfoundation#0000
