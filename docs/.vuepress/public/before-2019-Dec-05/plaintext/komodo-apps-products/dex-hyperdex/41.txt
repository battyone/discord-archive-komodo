@hyperDEX   The coin failed, is it necessary to manually set the miner's fee?

[08-Oct-19 04:00 AM] gcharang#6833
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± development of hyperDEX seems to be paused for the moment
are you trying to move coins outside of hyperDEX?
which coin?

[08-Oct-19 04:47 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
@gcharang BCH  kmd

[08-Oct-19 04:49 AM] gcharang#6833
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± you can use the seed words from hyperdex in Agama wallet to move those coins

<https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029966-logging-into-verus-agama-with-an-existing-private-key-or-seed>

[08-Oct-19 05:15 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
@gcharang Because atomicdex updated 2.0, a black screen appeared and the seed was lost after reloading. I can still log in to HyperDEX with a password before I want to use HyperDEX to transfer the currency.

[08-Oct-19 05:21 AM] gcharang#6833
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± can you get private key of KMD and BCH from hyperDEX?

[08-Oct-19 05:27 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
If you can display the mnemonic with a password, it is best.

[08-Oct-19 05:32 AM] gcharang#6833
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± go to settings -> click "View seed phrase" -> enter your password
you can see your mnemonic

please remember to write down your mnemonic from the next time

[08-Oct-19 05:33 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
@gcharang  hyperDEX  Also?

[08-Oct-19 05:35 AM] gcharang#6833
yes in hyperDEX,
go to settings -> click "View seed phrase" -> enter your password

[08-Oct-19 05:57 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Thank you, I finally changed back to the mnemonic.

Where i can download hyperdex? So seed of hyperdex is compatible with atomicdex?

[08-Oct-19 05:43 PM] gcharang#6833
@fazer hyperDEX development seems to be paused for now
> seed of hyperdex is compatible with atomicdex?
yes, usable in both atomicDEX and agama

[08-Oct-19 06:40 PM] fazer#0903
@gcharang thank you

[16-Oct-19 12:29 AM] agnewpickens#7393
I am having an issue trying to launch Hyper DEX v 0.4.0 on Win 7 Pro, market maker keeps crashing, is there a newer release?

[16-Oct-19 12:30 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Oh, I see above, issue with seeds?

[16-Oct-19 01:10 AM] gcharang#6833
@agnewpickens development of hyperDEX seems to be paused for the moment
you could try atomicDEX or chainswap for now

[16-Oct-19 02:26 AM] agnewpickens#7393
@gcharang chainswap ?  Is there a GUI for that?

[16-Oct-19 02:32 AM] agnewpickens#7393
I have KMD and 3 top 50 alt coins in Agama and want to be able to put up some orders.

@peddycb the swap failed
the dex are still in the imtermediate address https://dex.explorer.dexstats.info/address/bUTaYUUb67kgi2UDZ5BGWumExYGtUdyJDj
they should come back to you after 4 hours(keep hyperdex running)

[21-Oct-19 10:28 AM] peddycb#5889
ah ok

[21-Oct-19 10:29 AM] peddycb#5889
What's the mistake ? hyperdex always has to run

[21-Oct-19 11:00 AM] Oszy#5734
of course it has to run until swap is finished

[21-Oct-19 11:05 AM] gcharang#6833
I don't think there is any mistake
some swaps simply timeout
it could be because of network conditions or maker going down etc.
I don't think it is recommended to use hyperDEX currently; its development seems to be paused

[21-Oct-19 11:51 AM] Lennart#9331
kinda funny, there are some yummy DEX orders on mm2, but no GUI software available to take the offer

[21-Oct-19 11:51 AM] Lennart#9331
we need DEX in atomic dex üôÇ

Chainswap works fine for DEX

[21-Oct-19 12:30 PM] Lennart#9331

aye thanks

[21-Oct-19 12:39 PM] Lennart#9331
ah i see... but the yummy offer (24 KMD/1 DEX) from https://oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/ does not appear in Chainswap

[21-Oct-19 12:40 PM] Lennart#9331
too old probably or not active at the moment?

[21-Oct-19 12:40 PM] Oszy#5734
does not appear?

[21-Oct-19 12:40 PM] Oszy#5734
refresh

[21-Oct-19 12:41 PM] Lennart#9331
i am in the "sell" tab, select kmd to send and instanddex to receive

[21-Oct-19 12:41 PM] Oszy#5734
Swap tab

[21-Oct-19 12:41 PM] Oszy#5734
Receive DEX / Deposit KMD

[21-Oct-19 12:42 PM] Lennart#9331
my chainswap not funded atm so i can't see any orders in swap tab

[21-Oct-19 12:42 PM] Oszy#5734
yes you need kmd to see it

[21-Oct-19 12:44 PM] Lennart#9331
thx for the help, but out of interest, shouldn't the order also appear in the sell tab?

[21-Oct-19 12:44 PM] Oszy#5734
if you select Send kmd receive dex on the sell tab yes the list of orders should appear

[21-Oct-19 12:44 PM] Oszy#5734
that is sometimes buggged there

[21-Oct-19 12:44 PM] Oszy#5734
needs refreshing / tab swtiching

[21-Oct-19 01:16 PM] Lennart#9331
well.. somehow doesn't work for me

[21-Oct-19 01:17 PM] Lennart#9331
funded some KMD, but still can't load the orders for DEX

[21-Oct-19 05:36 PM] Oszy#5734
might have to recover swap funds manually

[21-Oct-19 05:37 PM] peddycb#5889
and how should this work at hyperdex

[21-Oct-19 05:39 PM] Oszy#5734
i don't think it's implemented in hyperdex

[21-Oct-19 05:40 PM] Oszy#5734
it is in marketmaker but I am not even sure they are using the latest of that

[21-Oct-19 05:40 PM] Oszy#5734
development was paused as far as i know

[21-Oct-19 05:40 PM] Oszy#5734
try to ask in #dev-marketmaker on of the mm devs maybe able to help you

[21-Oct-19 05:42 PM] peddycb#5889
I prefer not to say what I think üòë

[21-Oct-19 05:44 PM] Oszy#5734
@gcharang can you help him?

[21-Oct-19 05:44 PM] Oszy#5734
the KMD was refunded, his DEX wasn't

[21-Oct-19 05:45 PM] peddycb#5889
I have no time for such a thing and no annoying

[21-Oct-19 05:46 PM] peddycb#5889
Thank you, I will address him

[22-Oct-19 07:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
autorefund should happen within 4 hrs. There is an option to recover stuck sawps faster in atomicDEX or via CLI

[22-Oct-19 08:55 AM] Acura#2748
problem is that the DEX Asset is actually not listed on AtomicDex - i think he better wait for that

[22-Oct-19 09:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
it is listed on chainswap @Acura

it's 'listed' on MM2.0, atomicdex just doesnt show orders yet

anyway, this is a hyperdex thread, let's not hijack it too much üòÑ

[03-Nov-19 11:37 PM] vichiet#4058
Hello I created an order to buy Dex coin for 18kmd . Don't see the order was fulfilled but I see a transaction of 35 kmd  to a temporary address

Can someone help to figure out this issue?

[04-Nov-19 09:52 AM] Oszy#5734

[07-Nov-19 12:19 PM] vichiet#4058
Where can we find log file from hyperdex ?

[07-Nov-19 12:21 PM] Oszy#5734
not sure if there is one

[07-Nov-19 12:21 PM] Oszy#5734
I can't see any in the app folder, and since all data is wiped on restart, i think it's not being logged right now.

[07-Nov-19 12:23 PM] vichiet#4058
I have one swap with my kmd stuck on it .

[07-Nov-19 12:26 PM] vichiet#4058
@lukechilds  is there a way to recover fund stuck ?

[07-Nov-19 12:26 PM] Oszy#5734
right. first of all don't try to fix or delete anything. HyperDEX current version does not yet support recovering funds of stuck swaps. 
You are going to have to wait for a release that does, or get marketmaker CLI working on your PC to do it.

[07-Nov-19 12:29 PM] Oszy#5734
Do you have the `uid` by any chance?

[07-Nov-19 12:33 PM] vichiet#4058
Yes I have

[07-Nov-19 12:38 PM] vichiet#4058

[07-Nov-19 12:38 PM] vichiet#4058
Yes I have

[07-Nov-19 12:38 PM] vichiet#4058
I also see json file of the swap

[07-Nov-19 12:40 PM] vichiet#4058
Do you have link for marketmaker CLI ?
