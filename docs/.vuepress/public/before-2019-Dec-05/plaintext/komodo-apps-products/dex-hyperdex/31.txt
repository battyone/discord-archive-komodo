You should not need to do this manually though. HyperDEX kickstarts all swaps at launch, so just restarting the app should be enough to kickstart.

How does BarterDEX autosplit funds to match available orders without having to create a new transaction?

[15-Dec-18 10:32 PM] crypto999#4866
As theÂ BarterDEXÂ GUI evolves, the handling ofÂ UTXOâ€™s will ultimately be handled seamlessly in the background using automated trade-bots. We already have implemented a process that automatically splits the user balance as necessary, to match the exact value of available orders. Note that these particular trading bots are performing the atomic swaps on your behalf! These are not average tradebots as seen on centralized exchanges, they trade through atomic swaps. Even though this approach more complex than a generic centralized exchange, ultimately it puts more power back into the hands of the users.

[15-Dec-18 10:39 PM] crypto999#4866
Also, i see on the BarterDEX images a Send button. Is that the equivalent then of the usual exchange withdrawal?

[16-Dec-18 02:04 AM] Hermes#6934
By sending you are taking the funds out of the Barterdex Smart address

[17-Dec-18 09:55 PM] crypto999#4866
Can anyone answer the question above. It says about automatically splitting UTXOs - how is that achieved without sending a new transaction and as such incurring transaction fees. Or do they mean splitting? Say I have one BTC UTXO - can the system automatically break that down to the amount I want to buy, the deposit, and the fee? Or does it need splitting up - in which case does there need to be multiple transactions to create useful sized UTXOs?

[17-Dec-18 10:00 PM] jl777c#5810
splitting the utxo incurs txfees

[17-Dec-18 11:21 PM] crypto999#4866
OK. Thanks. For the order book, can you explain how that works? Indeed, and what incentive is there to be a full node broadcasting orders?

[17-Dec-18 11:28 PM] jl777c#5810
nodes broadcast orders to all nodes

[17-Dec-18 11:28 PM] jl777c#5810
each node uses that data to construct what its view of the orderbook is

[17-Dec-18 11:29 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no financial incentive to run a full node

[17-Dec-18 11:29 PM] jl777c#5810

Hello, I tried to use Hyperdex. Sometimes not very clear interface. If you want more people to use it, you have to simplify it.

[22-Dec-18 08:02 PM] SadykovT#2123
Tried to start on two different computers, on windows 7 x64, does not work, there is an error. Works fine on windows 10.

[24-Dec-18 02:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
@SadykovT thanks for your feedback.

I'm aware of the withdrawal issue, it appears to be either a mm or possibly Electrum issue. Other users have reported the same issue using the mm daemon directly. To be clear, HyperDEX is just a GUI layer on top of mm. If mm responds responds saying the withdrawal was successful then the GUI (HyperDEX) will display a notification saying the withdrawal is successful, that is functioning as expected.

We are aware of performance issues with mm and have been reporting them since we started developing HyperDEX. mm and HyperDEX are developed by two separate development teams. We have reported perf issues to the mm team and they are working on mmv2 which will hopefully address these issues.

Regarding the interface not being clear, are you referring to the actual visual design or the way it works? Any feedback you've got here or issues you encounter would definitely be appreciated. Feel free to discuss them in here. However if you have specific issue/suggestion/bug it may be best to create a GitHub issue with the "Feedback" button in the app so we can track it make sure we get the issue resolved.

[24-Dec-18 06:51 AM] tolken#2655
I like the design and think itâ€™s fairly straight forward. Itâ€™s just the underlying mm not performing without a hitch throws off the experience. If trades matched reliably, i doubt thereâ€™d be any confusion over the HyperDex interface. As a new user, without a trade gong though successfully, itâ€™s not surprising to start questioning if the GUI is responsible.

@lukechilds  keep this progress going its just amazing only what im waiting is MM v2 do you have some indicators when that could be when this do trades to be responding quicker then its final party

@lukechilds all assetchains with activated sapling need "txversion=4" in the coins file, else withdraws and swaps will not work
@artem.pikulin#0794  should i add txversion=4 to all assetchains with activated sapling, or is there a plan to manage this directly in mm?

[25-Dec-18 02:35 PM] cipi#4502
@artem.pikulin

[25-Dec-18 03:31 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@cipi Depending on version explicit txversion in config might be not required. The latest release in my repo has hardcoded Sapling activation for KMD and assetchains which was added by jl777.

[25-Dec-18 03:31 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@cipi

[25-Dec-18 04:03 PM] cipi#4502

[26-Dec-18 05:46 AM] crypto999#4866
Can someone explain why the bobdeposit step is necessary? It says in the literature that this is to promote Bob moving forward with the trade, but my understanding was the transaction activity was done automatically once both parties had committed to the trade? Is that not the case? Do individuals have to confirm each of the steps manually? It seems to add an extra layer of complexity as well as risk to the Bob side...

[26-Dec-18 06:21 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@crypto999 Hi, swap protocol design discussions took place at 2015-2016: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1340621.msg13828271#msg13828271, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1364951 when there were just few coins with BIP65 (CLTV) support. The purpose was to allow one side of swap to send standard 2of2 multisig output so at least  Alice can swap the coin without CLTV.
Nowadays most coins have CLTV opcode support so swap protocol will be simplified in MM2, both payments will be hash/time locked outputs, Bob won't need 212% balance to trade anymore.

Ah, fantastic. Think that wo uld make things much more user friendly. Can I ask too about the SpeedMode/Zeroconf? It sounds like this could be expanded to allow instant non-swap transfers for a range of coins - effectively a multi-coin Lightning Network as it seems to work in a similar way with the providing of collateral on a payment channel...

[26-Dec-18 10:29 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@crypto999 We don't have plans about Zeroconf expansion/improvement yet. On current development stage MM2 doesn't even support it. We will think about possible improvements when we start porting the Zeroconf to MM2.

[27-Dec-18 07:40 PM] Hermes#6934
I have seem similar issues in Mac OSx ...it doesn't launch in some occasions

[28-Dec-18 12:11 AM] stock999#4818
@jspook16  Yes, i launched it. But order book is empty for almost all pairs. There are just a few of orders

[28-Dec-18 12:15 AM] stock999#4818
I don't understand what it does mean : 'This swap is worth $.... '. Is it a fee?

[28-Dec-18 12:19 AM] stock999#4818
I don't understand  ' Avg Vol', 'Max Vol', etc.  I newer  used to work with such kind of exchange, atomic swap. That's why i need a detailed guide.

[28-Dec-18 05:15 AM] jspook16#3059
so currently volume is low for most pairs because not enough people are using it. "This swap is worth $.." should be an estimate of what the swap is worth in fiat. So if you trade 10 kmd for X number of Verus (example) it should say this swap is worth ~ $7. Im going off memory. I think avg vol is the avg vol of available utxos. Max vol i think is the largest utxo. Atomic swaps basically swap one utxo size for another of equal value. Hyperdex helps in creating a utxo for the size you are trying to swap for. What pairs are you looking to trade? @stock999

[28-Dec-18 05:16 AM] jspook16#3059
You can read up on barterdex here  https://docs.komodoplatform.com/home-barterDEX.html       Hyperdex is just a gui for barterdex backend. Maybe there is some useful info there for you. @stock999

[28-Dec-18 05:21 AM] jspook16#3059
@stock999 also as an fyi, currently barterdex is running marketmaker 1.0 (think of it as the brains that allow for atomic swaps). There is an upgrade early next year to mm2.0 (marketmaker 2.0) that should make things alot smoother. AND there is a project (coincollect) that is working on a mobile trading app with barterdex backend. The project is also advertising providing liquidity to jump start the app use. tagging @Diesmaster to make sure i captured coincollect project correctly.

[28-Dec-18 11:19 AM] stock999#4818
Thanks for the explanation  @jspook16

[28-Dec-18 11:38 AM] stock999#4818
It is still not clear about utxo.   What happens if i have no a proper size? For example, i have received 100 KMD  as a one single tx,  i.e . utxo is 100, right? But i want to sell only 10 or 20 of them. Will it work?

[28-Dec-18 11:39 AM] stock999#4818
Sorry if the question looks as stupid, but i'm really a newbie in this atomic swap
