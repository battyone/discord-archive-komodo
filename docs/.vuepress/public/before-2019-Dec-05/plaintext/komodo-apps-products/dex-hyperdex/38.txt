Ah OK thanks!

[26-Jul-19 01:29 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Is it in alpha, beta...?

[26-Jul-19 01:29 PM] gcharang#6833
consider all the different GUIs to be in beta
some might be in alpha

[26-Jul-19 01:30 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
OK

I've already added Barterlly and AtomixDEX on my directory
I added (beta) so that people now, but they are the most voted exchanges so far
Maybe I can already add Chainswap and hyperDEX too

[26-Jul-19 01:32 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
or maybe it's too early for hyperDEX?
I think Chainswap is now fully released

[26-Jul-19 01:33 PM] gcharang#6833
Barterlly is a escrow OTC trading service, not a DEX
they have plans to integrate it in the future I think

@D2D privacyalternatives.com maybe another distinction, hyperDEX is the only one with a market view where limit orders are places. atomicDEX and Chainmaker's DEX does market orders like shapeshift.

[27-Jul-19 11:27 AM] Sharifa#7849
@hyperDEX is it possible technically to list $ARRR on #DEX?

[27-Jul-19 11:48 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Sharifa not yet. We dont support native at the moment

[27-Jul-19 01:22 PM] mobipoi#5774
Will it be possible to add  features in which all order pairs of a specific coin can be seen

[27-Jul-19 01:24 PM] mobipoi#5774
Because of the liquidity multiplier , this can help sellers to navigate which actual coin they want

[27-Jul-19 01:25 PM] mobipoi#5774
So e.g Kmd/k64 ,  kmd/btc ,Kmd/bch, kmd/dex etc .....

[27-Jul-19 09:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@mobipoi that is something we will be working on as soon as the core functionality is stable.

[27-Jul-19 09:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That is our focus right now, that we refactor the code to mm2.0 that we make sure all the little bugs and so forth are done so normal users can place simple orders and get them executed. Once that is done we will add on further functionality

[27-Jul-19 09:43 PM] willofleo#7505
ok that is a cool feature but I think it better we focus on the main things first @mobipoi as hyper said

[27-Jul-19 09:51 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It is part of the road map, liquidity multiplier option and market maker bot üòõ

@hyperDEX when Accointing tax optimizer¬†?
You could offer this automized software solution to Premium members who pay it with $KMD/$DEX .

It could be an extra revenue stream, no?

[30-Jul-19 05:03 PM] phm87#7395
Taxes on internationnal lvl are complicated. There are some data on CMC but we may need 150 fiscal experts and with huge risks I guess @Sharifa 
But your idea is good on paper, I like it. I had a similar project called tax load balancing but I never found investors to fund it

[30-Jul-19 06:15 PM] Sharifa#7849
@phm87 oh so it needs to be a Project built on Komodo then?

[30-Jul-19 06:17 PM] phm87#7395
No. I was not talking about kmd sorry

[30-Jul-19 06:17 PM] phm87#7395
But yeah doing it on komodo can be easier because tech is already there. Pb of taxes is complex formulaes and always changing

[30-Jul-19 06:19 PM] phm87#7395
I heard of 1 of the big 4 that have an optimization tax app on international lvl, it did cost more than 100 millions but .... it made them earn way more.

[30-Jul-19 08:18 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@hastrup thanks. We will get a new build out soon that should hopefully addresses these issues.

[30-Jul-19 08:18 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Sharifa not touching tax, too many crazy laws. Will keep it simple, an export option for trades

hi @hyperDEX - just got latest version and tried a KMD > DEX swap - seems stuck ID: f8ce9b0e-9318-46a5-a524-f9a15d21ca12 - anything you can see you end?

[02-Aug-19 02:33 PM] allbits#5898
@miles this looks like a mm2 issue and not a GUI issue.  Check #dev-marketmaker

[02-Aug-19 02:44 PM] miles#6381
thanks @allbits - will do

[12-Aug-19 01:06 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@miles Hi! I've checked your swap status on the seednode and can see that other side swap was completed with refund. Due to the bug of MM2 (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/502) your payment is stuck until MM2 is updated in HyperDEX bundle. But once you update the app with new MM2 it will be refunded. Please ensure that you don't delete the app data since it will be harder to recover if MM2 database is removed.

@hyperDEX i had someone review hyperDEX back in Q1 this year [1], it's probably due for another review but you're probably working working on the marketmaker integration [2] pic in bottom of link of the atomic swap api info.

has hyperdex got some sort of roadmap?   or any other info needing an update post?

haha we will see. Artem and the mm2.0 has done a good job. Just need to get it feature complete. But i think we are all in a good place and KMD is on track to deliver big time.

@lukechilds @hyperDEX latest releaase has a bug (github issues #618)

[17-Aug-19 09:56 AM] phideas#8309
bug solved in latest nightly, exchange works again. thanks @lukechilds 
still not possible to withdraw or swap 'max amount' with automatic fee calc. i'd really like this feature to be implemented.
another idea (killer feature) could be to convert any dust or low value coin into kmd with one click, similar to binance - bnb.

I get an error message when logging in ...

[30-Aug-19 05:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@peddycb which version are you running? The official builds are depreciated, nightly is up to date.

[30-Aug-19 02:47 PM] peddycb#5889
oki doki I'll try the new version

[02-Sep-19 02:55 PM] miles#6381
hi @hyperDEX  - i took the latest nightly build to see if the stuck swap discussed above with @artem.pikulin  would now return the funds, but it hasn't worked. Should it now now resolve in that issue? Do i need to wait for the 4 hrs with the app running?

[02-Sep-19 08:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@miles  from my understanding once the new mm2.0 was pulled into the build it should just work. @artem.pikulin any ideas what else miles needs to do?

[03-Sep-19 04:22 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@miles Hi, did you enable KMD and DEX coins after opening the HyperDEX app? MM2 requires the coins to be activated for swap to automatically kickstart.
If coins are activated but your payment is not refunded I will need MM2 logs to check what's going on. @hyperDEX Can MM2 logs be viewed from HyperDEX app?

[03-Sep-19 06:51 AM] miles#6381
Thanks guys for response, both coins were activated and the swap was still active at step 5/7 but didn‚Äôt refund. I am away for a couple of days but if you let me know how I can grab the logs or some info to debug I can look at it Friday if that helps

Hi @Artist - nodeJS, react, electron stack being used and the app obv. written in JS with some CSS for the styles. It is a GUI built on top of the atomicDEX technology: https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/blob/b44b2990ceb956d3015d046aad0fa22bc840fdd1/README.md#hyperdex-is-just-a-gui

Hello, I am a new user, having just downloaded 0.4.0 for Linux.  I wanted to see if my seed words for AtomicDEX would work in HyperDEX and they mostly didn't.  HyperDEX sees my Bitcoin Cash balance, but not BTC, KMD, or ETH.

[17-Sep-19 04:52 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
When I connect to a HyperDEX account, there is an error that says "Couldn't Connect to ETOMIC Electrum Server", but evenutally the wallet does load.

[17-Sep-19 05:41 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
I have sent both BTC and USDT to my HyperDEX wallet.  The USDT showed up no problem, however the BTC is not showing despite having several confirmations.
