what if i told you someone bought for 22:1

[21-Mar-19 02:14 PM] CHMEX#0686
so you sold him:)
I was offered today to buy at 32 KMD a piece
so that 8 KMD on coinexchange sounds like a bargin

[21-Mar-19 02:15 PM] jorian#4555
seems so

[21-Mar-19 02:15 PM] jorian#4555
market is quite not liquid

[21-Mar-19 02:15 PM] jorian#4555
so we don't know the real price

[21-Mar-19 02:15 PM] CHMEX#0686
most are otc my guess. some on really odd pairs

[21-Mar-19 03:33 PM] Hackelchen#9754
Hmm ðŸ¤” and i thought 8:1 was expensive.

[21-Mar-19 03:34 PM] Hackelchen#9754
By the way, where you got your dex? Was it airdropped or what?

[21-Mar-19 03:35 PM] CHMEX#0686
There was an asset on NXT

[21-Mar-19 03:36 PM] CHMEX#0686
Which got converted to DEX assetchain along with the other assets

[21-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Hackelchen#9754
Is there a rich list/ Block Explorer available?

Sry for alle the questions ðŸ˜…

[21-Mar-19 03:47 PM] CHMEX#0686
On NXT we sent the assets to the Supernet accoubt with a message which indicated to where it should be sent on the DEX chain

[21-Mar-19 03:48 PM] Hackelchen#9754
Oh wow i am in the top 200 with My 17 dex ðŸ˜‚

[21-Mar-19 03:48 PM] CHMEX#0686
Hope that makes sense

[21-Mar-19 03:48 PM] CHMEX#0686

And some 44% are held by james funds

[23-Mar-19 09:58 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Some noob questions: hyperdex = KMD dex? Above you are talking about a DEX coin? Would holding that coin mean i would benefit from TX fees when the DEX is used?

[24-Mar-19 03:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@CoinKing88 For  HyperDEX/BarterDEX or any app using the dex API, the dexfee is held for distribution to DEX asset holders when it reaches a threshold value.

[24-Mar-19 09:36 AM] CoinKing88#1540
How do i get DEX assets? Can i buy them with my KMD?

[24-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Acura#2748
@CoinKing88 ON BarterDEX / HyperDex and Coinexchange.io you can buy the DEX Asset, or you find an OTC Seller here. But the liquidity is low, many of the hodlers wonÂ´t sell

[24-Mar-19 09:47 AM] CoinKing88#1540
@Acura Thanks. If anyone on here wants to sell me a bit (i am not a whale) let me know (i can send first if you are team member/mod or vouched for)

[24-Mar-19 09:49 AM] Acura#2748
prices are high for the asset. I only sell from 50KMD per asset myself

[24-Mar-19 09:55 AM] CoinKing88#1540
What is the total supply?

@Acura Ah i see (https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/71729160/What+is+a+Parallel+Chain+Asset+Chain) Both Supernet and DEX are parallel (asset) chains on KMD. So this is the one i meant right? -> https://www.coinexchange.io/market/DEX/BTC. Which you offer 1 DEX for 50 KMD.

[24-Mar-19 11:42 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes

[24-Mar-19 11:42 AM] CHMEX#0686
Technicly they are independent coins meaning they can survive on their own

[24-Mar-19 11:49 AM] Acura#2748
@CoinKing88 yes, i sell 1 Dex at  50kmd  - can offer up to 1000 DEX

[24-Mar-19 12:09 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@Acura Ok, ill try at coinexchange first. Only looking to buy 1 or 2 DEX, just for the fun (as i said i am not a BTC whale :))

[24-Mar-19 02:25 PM] Markus#5464
Dont know how i feel about DEX it sounds like this coin is pretty centralised

[24-Mar-19 02:25 PM] Markus#5464
with alot of benefits incase kmd trading app will be a huge success

[24-Mar-19 02:54 PM] willofleo#7505
@Markus  The DEX token dose not represent a utility of sort , it more of a representation of shares  of reward to be distributed , so you ment to say a large portion is owned by a few which seems correct however a large share is held by other funds such as supernet token which in turn is held by 100s of  holders , and then the other 50%

[24-Mar-19 02:56 PM] willofleo#7505
of reward  is held by MGW, BOT , jUMBLR, REV etc which is also held by 100s of holders each

[24-Mar-19 03:00 PM] willofleo#7505
so you  dont have to buy DEX to own shares of DEX reward , but very few are willing to sell and why should they when the potential is high , alternatives is you make you own GUI with DEX api  and earn a portion , so it not centralised like say binance coin in terms of concentrated ownership

[24-Mar-19 04:58 PM] west775#4114
Dex isn't well distributed yet because it hasn't had a proper market since nxt days. Also many of the larger hodlers have had their dex since 2014 2015 and have strong hands; waiting for dex to start producing revenue

[24-Mar-19 04:59 PM] west775#4114
It will be very expensive to buy once revs start coming in

[24-Mar-19 05:53 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Will there be a minimum of DEX you need to hold before you get revs? (i read the first million in fees will be withheld and after that you get revs by holding DEX)

[24-Mar-19 05:57 PM] Markus#5464
Well if max supply is 1 million DEX then its probably 1$ per DEX as payout

[24-Mar-19 05:58 PM] Markus#5464
i assume

[24-Mar-19 05:59 PM] CoinKing88#1540
No thats not what i meant. After the DEX is operational, the first 1 million dollars in tx fee will be for the team or whatever, after that DEX holders will earn from the tx fee. My question is if there is a minimum of DEX you need to hold to be able to receive those earnings

[24-Mar-19 05:59 PM] CoinKing88#1540
or is it holdings/1.000.000 ratio

[24-Mar-19 05:59 PM] Markus#5464
Probably no minimum

[24-Mar-19 06:00 PM] Markus#5464
If supply would be bigger then it would make sense with a minimum

[24-Mar-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as the payout isnt a small fraction, it will go out

[26-Mar-19 09:24 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Evening all: a new day, new questions from me. I read in the Cryptoslate interview with CTO Stadelmann about the DEX. Interesting bits: 0 listingfee, every pair has a pair with every other listed coin, 0,15% tx fee. My question is: are those parameters embedded in the code (as well as de 1 million fee cap to be withheld first to cover costs) or are those subjects to change in the future? Further note: @jl777c i saw you only got 12 DEX coins, how i that possible as a lead engineer? I figured you "green" guys would be holding a majority of the coins in this project

[26-Mar-19 09:27 PM] CoinKing88#1540
And other question: you guys told me earlier that the tx fee would be payed in the coin traded, but then you get fractions (for example, if you trade 50 KMD and 0,15% is taken off you end up trading 49,xx). Isnt that unpractical?

[26-Mar-19 09:28 PM] jl777c#5810
the dexfee is in the protocol, the revshare payouts are done outside the consensus rules. nothing will be witheld for costs

[26-Mar-19 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
what happens when you trade on CEX? fees can be added to total or subtracted, not much difference really, unless you have OCD

[26-Mar-19 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
where does it say I have 12 DEX coins?

what mechanism  distributes Dex earnings ?

[27-Mar-19 04:22 AM] CHMEX#0686
Its a human process.
Jl distributes it based on a getsnapshot height once it reaches 1m usd

[27-Mar-19 08:22 AM] mobipoi#5774
Hmm thats very centralised, as the private key to the fee earning addresses is held by one person , so the distribution of earnings is prone to human error, it also dangerous to

[27-Mar-19 08:23 AM] mobipoi#5774
It like CEX but for Dex asset would have thought it was automated

[27-Mar-19 08:25 AM] CHMEX#0686
Maybe in the future that might be a CC I don't know. But for now is sounds like the safest option

[27-Mar-19 08:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
It was never a priority to automate as the distribution wasnt that often. I already read that @jl777c  would automate it once it would be more often. The problem I can imagine would be that you would need to convert all the fees to kmd in order to pay the dividend, dont know if itâ€™s possible to automate that part? Anyway everything is on the blockchain and I can imagine someone like jl has 100x more to lose should he run off with a mere 1m$ in dexfees... its just not worth it to f*ck around with that.

[27-Mar-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
once there is enough DEX liquidity, then the dexfees for each coin can be autoconverted to KMD and with payments CC, it would be possible to automate the payouts. I guess if the DEX allowed to specify an arbitrary scriptPubKey to send the proceeds to, then it can all be automated. However, automating is a lot of work and there is no sense to do this until it becomes a real need. I have already distributed millions in revshares from the dPoW fees (most arrived during the BTC fee market). So yes, currently the DEX asset is a decentralized dexfees arriving, but centralized revshare distribution. Only the dexfees are at risk from jl777 gone bad

[27-Mar-19 08:55 AM] ph03nix#3115
#cc-payments

[27-Mar-19 10:42 AM] mobipoi#5774
Yes payment cc is great was thinking of that too but the problem is jl777 might not  be bad but access to the fee earning  addresses is lost or hacked  what will happen can the fee earning addresses be changed in such events ?  Or it will be like satoshi btc address laying there earning fees but nothing can be done to get access

[27-Mar-19 10:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
What if binance privkeys get comprimised?

[27-Mar-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
if that happens, we can always update the DEX code to use a different address

[27-Mar-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
let us not worry about hypotheticals in unlikely scenarios when there are solutions to them

[27-Mar-19 11:47 AM] mobipoi#5774
Yes I agree , doesn't hurt to be paranoid once in a while but nice to know there are solutions already in place

[27-Mar-19 11:49 AM] mobipoi#5774
@Cryptoon  we should be better than binance

[27-Mar-19 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It was more in the sense of that the likelyhood of binance privkeys being compromised is a very super highly unlikely, just like it would that the DEX address should be compromised. Is it worth the time/effort to be the final 0.00000001% safe instead of just 99.9999999% even if the cost of that final 0.00000001 would be too high compared to the relative risk?

[28-Mar-19 08:29 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Maybe some setup using multisig can make it death proof

[28-Mar-19 08:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
cc-heir I guess?

[28-Mar-19 08:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but DEX not cc enabled yet, this is a hardforking change, right?

[28-Mar-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
the issue is that every coin would need a "sweeper"

[28-Mar-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
so really not practical to make it 100% trustless across all coins

[28-Mar-19 03:45 PM] mobipoi#5774
@siu - Chainmakers  death proof maybe important , if dex become widely used dex existence depends of jl777 which is not bad but can be dangerous

[28-Mar-19 03:49 PM] mobipoi#5774
That all I was trying to say valuation is linked to that however kmd is filled with talented devs including jl777 so solutions will be created

[28-Mar-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
once it becomes a meaningful revenue stream, then we can change to multisig address for most coins
