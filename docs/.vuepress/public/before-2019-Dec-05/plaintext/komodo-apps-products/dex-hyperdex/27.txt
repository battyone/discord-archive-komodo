Hey guys, wondering if anyone knows about a JAVA script error with message : cant find module 'portscanner' when trying to run BarterDEX app on windows

[07-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Hermes#6934
Hello there

[07-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Hermes#6934
Here is a guide that can help with this @skemybits https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000025600-barterdex-javascript-error-/en

[08-Oct-18 12:57 PM] lukechilds#2707
GUSD integration is complete

[08-Oct-18 12:57 PM] lukechilds#2707
basically no liquidity until people get their hands on some GUSD and want to market make it

[08-Oct-18 12:57 PM] lukechilds#2707
but the functionality is added to HyperDEX and working

$GUSD integration into @HyperDEXApp is complete. Just Ààtrustlessly bought $KMD with $GUSD via the power of atomic swaps. No KYC required. Permissionless systems for the win!

This is pretty cool, it means Gemini basically act as our unofficial (and probably unhappy) KYC partner, to allow people to cash in/out with fiat. It also means people can get hold of GUSD through HyperDEX without KYC.

Ich hab vielleicht ein Problem  in HyperDex gefunden. Kann ich das mit jemand aus dem Team in deutsch besprechen???
Ich w√ºrde dann heute Abend alle Infos zusammen tragen.

I read a little bit about GUSD and I will read again because if it's regulated in some way it could make a difference or is just like tether?

Hello Komodo team,

i have a big problem with HyperDEX and
i will try it to cleare the problem in english:


at the 05.10.2018 i make a trade 73,21479399 KMD for 2.000,00293161 CHIPS
because the system dont has this complete amount, it exchange 21,69328229 KMD for 694,7906861 CHIPS   
the transaction was stop with the ErrorCode: -1007.

to this point ia already ok. 
And now comes the problem:

The 21,69328229 KMD has gone out from my wallet. 
But it`s kame no CHIPS back, no KMD back.
Also after 3 days kame no KMD or Chips back.

What can i do. This bug  is not a litle 

now i go to bed and will tomorrow look in discord.
üò©

[08-Oct-18 09:53 PM] gsnew#5366
how can i insert pictures to the chat. I have pictures form the agama wallet ( CHIPS and KMD ) , you see the out and incoming in this timeframe. 
i have a picture from the HyperDEX history in this timeframe.
And i have a picture form HyperDEX, in this you see the canceled transaction.

[08-Oct-18 11:29 PM] jspook16#3059

Adding Triggers (TRIG) could be a good move to get some volume, it will be delisted from binance and has no exchange left atm

[09-Oct-18 08:15 PM] kremer#4440
DAR has a very active dev and few exchange options

[09-Oct-18 09:31 PM] farsider350#7618
Is there a site that shows all current available/open orders?

[09-Oct-18 09:39 PM] Hermes#6934
You can see the graphic volume inside the trade tab in Hyperdex , not sure we have them listed outside of the program

[09-Oct-18 09:42 PM] Jonathan#3687
The only way that I know of is when a swap is complete it will give a link to the block explorer

swap 4/5 for about an hour now, is this normal?

[10-Oct-18 12:53 AM] Hermes#6934
Just in case the swap is still stuck or pending you can use this guide https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024479-my-swap-is-stuck-what-to-do-now- For now you can still wait for about 3 more hours and see if the funds get back to your address before using this guide. @farsider350

[10-Oct-18 02:59 AM] farsider350#7618
so your saying it is normal, and happens often I suppose. Good to know.

[10-Oct-18 03:02 AM] PTYX#6840
@farsider350 yes it happens often with all true dexes at this moment. They depend on connections and it has many moving parts

[11-Oct-18 12:40 AM] cipi#4502
@WhiteWidow TRIG looks like a XCP-token. BarterDEX only supports ERC20-tokens on ETH chain and BTC-like coins.

Hi Guys I loking for atmic swao exchange feature for my app

[11-Oct-18 12:22 PM] yo88#5530
whats best way to build it with hyper dex?

[11-Oct-18 12:23 PM] yo88#5530
does this work with agama wallet ?

[11-Oct-18 02:41 PM] Hermes#6934
Hyperdex is built on top of marketmaker, in relation to this Barterdex is open source so you could technically built a new GUI if you wished to

[12-Oct-18 08:21 PM] Jcharming#2693
I'm curious how the HyperDex/BarterDex project is coming along.  Recently I was commenting on it in a reddit thread basically praising KMD and it's team for their work on this DEX system and someone asked 'What's the latest, when can I use it?  Vaporware?"  so I figured it was time to come back and get an update myself.  
I participated in the soft launch a couple months ago and I see recently there is GUSD integration.  
Is there someone that would be willing to just give me an update as to where it is, and what it's next time line is looking like?   Please and thank you for anyone that does.

[12-Oct-18 08:29 PM] tolken#2655
HyperDex devs have voiced concern over less than optimal order matching and have been trying to fully assess where the problem may be. There‚Äôs been some question about the success rate of order matching lately, so that‚Äôs an outstanding question if it‚Äôs working optimally with respect to the current version of marketmaker, which is the underlying engine behind BarterDex.

[12-Oct-18 08:34 PM] tolken#2655
Markermaker2.0 is apparently in the works, which seeks to improve the order match success rate (amongst other things)  It‚Äôll be completely rewritten in RUST, made more optimal/extendable for more devs to jump on onboard. They‚Äôre aiming to get a beta out Q1 2019 afaik. Don‚Äôt know how far along they are.

[12-Oct-18 08:48 PM] Jcharming#2693
Thanks for a quick update @tolken   I really appreciate it, so atm is it fair to say that Hyper/BarterDex's are not functional until MM2.0 gets finished?

[12-Oct-18 09:03 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Hyper/BarterDex have been working since almost a year

[12-Oct-18 09:04 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
just not noob friendly, there's some learning curve

[12-Oct-18 09:04 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Hyperdex is easier though

[12-Oct-18 09:05 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
mm2.0 should fix the core and also help improving the ux

[12-Oct-18 09:10 PM] Jcharming#2693
So atm would you recommend people that are looking for a real dex to look into and learn how to use BarterDex or to wait out for hyperdex functionality with MM2?

[12-Oct-18 09:14 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
depends on their skill level,  for average users it's probably hard to use, even if tolken is providing volume for the main pairs. Skilled users can even use command line or learn to become marketmakers in anticipation of 2.0

[12-Oct-18 09:15 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it was to be expected for the first iteration, in time it will get better

[12-Oct-18 09:16 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I've read Chainzilla is working on a dashboard to help do marketmakers, the more there are and the easier it will be trading

[12-Oct-18 09:18 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
so if the question is if this can be widely adopted right now, I'd say it's not for the masses (yet) but it's a matter of time

[12-Oct-18 09:21 PM] crumb#2550
like @KomodoWorld said for those people who are willing to learn, it can be used now already

[12-Oct-18 09:21 PM] crumb#2550
granted that there is enough liquidity for things they want to trade

[12-Oct-18 09:22 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
remember the first release of OpenBazaar? And the difference with now?

[12-Oct-18 09:23 PM] crumb#2550
all bleeding edge tech is clumsy/difficult to use at first

[12-Oct-18 09:23 PM] crumb#2550

[12-Oct-18 09:49 PM] Jcharming#2693
All good points definitely, is there a place to be pointed if someone wants to learn how to become a marketmaker in anticipation of 2.0?  Or just get into this but has no previous knowledge?

@Jcharming ultimately mm2 and hyperdex will satisfy the needs of 99% of users out there. I‚Äôve been learning  bdex cli because it‚Äôs necessary to realistically be a market maker at this point.

[13-Oct-18 02:46 AM] tolken#2655
HyperDex is a very elegant solution, I‚Äôd prefer to use it for daily trading.

[14-Oct-18 05:27 PM] javadth#4536
whats the hyperdex ?

[14-Oct-18 05:27 PM] javadth#4536
a in-software exchange ?

[14-Oct-18 05:27 PM] javadth#4536
its a wallet ?

[14-Oct-18 05:28 PM] SHossain#0007
HyperDEX is a very simple exchange app which uses decentralized, atomic swap technology (BarterDEX) and does contain basic wallet features like send and withdraw.

{Reactions}
üëå 

[14-Oct-18 05:31 PM] javadth#4536
so it can be used like a wallet ?

[14-Oct-18 05:31 PM] javadth#4536
its online or offline ?

[14-Oct-18 11:54 PM] tolken#2655
@javadth  Yes, can be used as a wallet. Can trade when you‚Äôre online, not when offline. Same limitations as regular wallet.

[15-Oct-18 01:06 AM] Hermes#6934
The wallet part of the functionality it's similar to Agama , it lets you access a specific address because you have the seed ...but your funds are in the blockchain not in the software The seed that you use gives you access to this specific address the same way as if you had the private keys for an specific address in the blockchain.

[15-Oct-18 02:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Eventually, we would want to build all the agama functionality into HyperDEX so it is a one stop shop.
