@Deleted User I will give that a try. thank you

Issue with HyperDEX. Trade has been stuck at swap 3/5 for over 24 hours.

[16-Jun-18 08:54 PM] aFastHero#2811
Just read the above message with the same issue. I will attempt the same recommendation.

[16-Jun-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <gopye> Just made my first barterdex trade with hyperdex, easy as pie. great job guys

[16-Jun-18 08:58 PM] aFastHero#2811
@Deleted User Where is the location of the .finished files and what is it that needs to be backed up?

[16-Jun-18 08:59 PM] aFastHero#2811
Found it...just one file

[16-Jun-18 08:59 PM] aFastHero#2811
still curious as to what needs to be backed up. The directory in which the .finished file is located?

[16-Jun-18 09:04 PM] vrcninja#5651
@Deleted User I cleaned out the SWAP file in the appdata section but it didn't change anything. I checked on the bitcoin block explorer and see that the alice payment is sitting in a different bitcoin address but removing the files didn't change anything or kick the trade to move forward.

[16-Jun-18 09:05 PM] vrcninja#5651
It seems like both the alice payment and bob payment are sitting there but things are finishing up.

[16-Jun-18 09:05 PM] vrcninja#5651
are not

[16-Jun-18 09:10 PM] aFastHero#2811
I deleted the .finished file and restarted HyperDEX. Trade still shows at 3/5.

[16-Jun-18 09:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
only files finished in ".finished", not other files.

[16-Jun-18 09:26 PM] aFastHero#2811
there was one .finished file in the SWAPS directory for HyperDEX

[16-Jun-18 09:27 PM] aFastHero#2811
I backed up the SWAPS directory and then deleted the .finished file

[16-Jun-18 09:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
@aFastHero  can you post the wallet address and coin?

@Deleted User Buying OOT with KMD

[16-Jun-18 09:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok, let me see

[16-Jun-18 09:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
@aFastHero if you try a new swap it completes?

[16-Jun-18 09:42 PM] aFastHero#2811
I havent tried one after this swap froze

[16-Jun-18 09:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
how much did you pay that time?

[16-Jun-18 09:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
5 KMD?

[16-Jun-18 09:43 PM] aFastHero#2811
just under

[16-Jun-18 09:43 PM] aFastHero#2811
4.9*

[16-Jun-18 09:44 PM] aFastHero#2811
I can attempt another swap. Should I attempt with the same pair?

[16-Jun-18 09:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok, wait a minute, it's OOT bob who's not paying

[16-Jun-18 09:44 PM] aFastHero#2811
correct.

[16-Jun-18 09:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
wait, please

[16-Jun-18 09:44 PM] aFastHero#2811
on standby....

[16-Jun-18 09:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
@aFastHero  can you open the SWAP file in a text editor and past its content here?

[16-Jun-18 09:57 PM] aFastHero#2811
which swap file? There are multiple files in the SWAP directory.

[16-Jun-18 10:01 PM] aFastHero#2811
@Deleted User I have the file that was created at the time the swap began, or 3 minutes after.

[16-Jun-18 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
@aFastHero Well, we need to identify the swap on HyperDEX.

[16-Jun-18 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ok, open it and past the content here, please.

[16-Jun-18 10:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
on HyperDEX you can also see each swap id, clicking on the "View" button.

bob's deposit: `284a07ce9045ac661bf592177e5f3636d061eb19bdcc58f1379a14128526e734`

[16-Jun-18 10:12 PM] aFastHero#2811
The other successful swap on HyperDEX has "BOBPAYMENT" and  "BOBRECLAIM" files associated with it. No such files are listed for the swap in question.

[16-Jun-18 10:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, bob payment means that you received your OOT.

[16-Jun-18 10:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
In this case you won't receive, but we can claim bob's deposit.

[16-Jun-18 10:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
(so you don't lose your KMD)

[16-Jun-18 10:15 PM] aFastHero#2811
That is what I'm wanting to do.

[16-Jun-18 10:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
We need to read more files related to this swap.

[16-Jun-18 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
So, are you on linux?

[16-Jun-18 10:16 PM] aFastHero#2811

[16-Jun-18 10:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
Do you have more files starting with:
```

``` 
?

[16-Jun-18 10:19 PM] aFastHero#2811
yes

[16-Jun-18 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
can you past them here?

[16-Jun-18 10:20 PM] aFastHero#2811
Yes, one minute.

[16-Jun-18 10:22 PM] aFastHero#2811
correction, no other files begin with

[16-Jun-18 10:23 PM] aFastHero#2811
The other files that are associated with this swap are, alicepayment, bobdeposit, bobrefund and myfee

[16-Jun-18 10:25 PM] Deleted User#0000

[16-Jun-18 10:25 PM] aFastHero#2811
are those the ones to which you are referring?

[16-Jun-18 10:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes

[16-Jun-18 10:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
send them to me in private, so we don't spam here

[16-Jun-18 10:26 PM] aFastHero#2811
Alright. Thank you.

[16-Jun-18 10:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Is there any .finished file remaining there?

[16-Jun-18 10:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
You need to delete all the .finished files (making backup first of SWAPS folder is a good idea).

[16-Jun-18 10:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
1 - backup SWAPS folder.
2 - stop HyperDEX.
3 - delete all files which names end in ".finished"
4 - restart HyperDEX.

[16-Jun-18 10:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hum, you say that there is no remaining .finished files?

[16-Jun-18 10:33 PM] aFastHero#2811
correct.

[16-Jun-18 10:34 PM] aFastHero#2811
the only one in the directory was associated with the previous successful swap.

[16-Jun-18 10:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
It shouldn't be related but, delete it too, please.

[16-Jun-18 10:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Then restart HyperDEX.

[16-Jun-18 10:37 PM] aFastHero#2811
that was the one that was deleted.

[16-Jun-18 10:37 PM] aFastHero#2811
it was the only one in the folder

[16-Jun-18 10:39 PM] aFastHero#2811
there are .finished files in my BarterDEX directory and in the HyperDEX Nightly directory, which is separate from the HyperDEX directory (updated, most recent version).

[16-Jun-18 10:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
😕

[16-Jun-18 10:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh, delete those .finished too, please.

[16-Jun-18 10:39 PM] aFastHero#2811
alright

[16-Jun-18 10:46 PM] aFastHero#2811
deleted all .finished files in directories for HyperDEX Nightly, BarterDEX and OOTdapp

[16-Jun-18 10:47 PM] aFastHero#2811
Now start HyperDEX?

[16-Jun-18 10:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
i would restart one by one

[16-Jun-18 10:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
wait

[16-Jun-18 10:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
try BarterDEX

[16-Jun-18 10:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
and see if the swap appears on it

[16-Jun-18 10:48 PM] aFastHero#2811

Dashboard loaded, but Trade History is not loading now. Also no balances are displayed with I go to Exchange.

[16-Jun-18 10:55 PM] aFastHero#2811
There is a blank box where the trading pair and balance would show.

Just attempted to add Utrum in SPV and now no coins are listed.

[16-Jun-18 11:00 PM] aFastHero#2811
Maybe I should log out and restart?

[16-Jun-18 11:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Try restarting HyperDEX. Did you update HyperDEX after that swap?

[16-Jun-18 11:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
(stop BarterDEX first)

[16-Jun-18 11:01 PM] aFastHero#2811
negative. The most recent HyperDEX was used for the swap.

[16-Jun-18 11:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
It should be fixed by restarting HyperDEX, it should issue a call "swapstatus" and that should kickstart the swap. Not sure why it is not happening.

[16-Jun-18 11:03 PM] aFastHero#2811
Well I am logging in to HyperDEX now

[16-Jun-18 11:04 PM] aFastHero#2811
Alright, logged in.

[16-Jun-18 11:04 PM] aFastHero#2811
