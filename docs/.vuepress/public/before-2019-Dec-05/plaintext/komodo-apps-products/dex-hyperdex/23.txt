@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± unfortunalely you can't, we connect to all three community servers

[20-Sep-18 10:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
if your getting an error there may be an issue with the electrum servers

[20-Sep-18 10:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
you can try again later

[20-Sep-18 10:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
we are planning on spinning some of our own servers up too

[20-Sep-18 10:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Regnar You mean you found a GUSD Bob to trade with too?\or you set your own Bob up?

[20-Sep-18 10:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
or you just created an order but there are no Bobs

[20-Sep-18 11:40 AM] Regnar#6164
I created an order to buy GUSD with KMD, there wasn't anyone already selling yet, but it shows as open, just doesn't indicate on the chart that my order is out there (says no data)

[20-Sep-18 11:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
ahh, yeah

[20-Sep-18 11:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
we need GUSD Bobs setup first

[20-Sep-18 11:46 AM] Regnar#6164
Ok so if there aren't GUSD sellers first, then buy requests dont show up?

[20-Sep-18 11:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
do your orders not show in the order book?

[20-Sep-18 11:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
they did before

[20-Sep-18 11:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
but mm seems unrealiable in how it shows the order book

[20-Sep-18 11:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
sometimes your own orders show, sometimes it only seems to be Bob orders

[20-Sep-18 11:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I'm pretty sure they should always display if the order is open

[20-Sep-18 11:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's more of a `marketmaker` question than HyperDEX

[20-Sep-18 11:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
maybe @jl777c or @artem.pikulin can elaborate

[20-Sep-18 11:49 AM] Regnar#6164
Ok thanks. Yes orders, at least this one, aren't showing in the book.

[20-Sep-18 12:17 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Regnar Hi, as Luke said due to `marketmaker` order might not show up. Could you please create an issue (https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/issues/new) and provide more details:  What other coins do you have enabled? What order do you try to place?

sure thing, I'll do that right now. I'm trying other things to see if it's just GUSD

[20-Sep-18 12:58 PM] Regnar#6164
actually just got an error, maybe this has something to do with it?

It's an exception in JS code, @lukechilds, could you please check the above?

[20-Sep-18 01:00 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Should be something different on GUI level.

[20-Sep-18 01:00 PM] Regnar#6164
yea just got the error again

[20-Sep-18 01:01 PM] Regnar#6164
I'll wait for Luke before I create an issue, just in case he's already tracking this error

[20-Sep-18 01:03 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
If you successfully placed an order previously but it didn't show up it should be something with MM back-end. JS error should be different, but it's message is too generic to understand without Luke help.

[20-Sep-18 01:12 PM] Regnar#6164
The order ID that I'm seeing when I open the details of an order, what is that?

[20-Sep-18 01:17 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Unique ID of your order generated by Marketmaker.

[20-Sep-18 01:18 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Like any other important entities orders should be uniquely identified to match each other, etc.

[20-Sep-18 01:21 PM] lukechilds#2707
@Regnar not sure what that error is, could you create an issues with a screenshot and explain the steps you took to generate the error

[20-Sep-18 01:29 PM] Regnar#6164
I can certainly try lol. I closed out the error but it had popped up 4 times (all while I wasn't actively doing anything in the app) so I'm not really sure how to replicate it.

[20-Sep-18 01:29 PM] Regnar#6164
It actually just popped up again, I haven't touched anything in the past 10 minutes. So I'll see how detailed I can make it

Whatever happened to pondsea, still around somewhere?

[20-Sep-18 02:52 PM] Regnar#6164
Also any chance of adding NEO and/or GAS to HyperDEX? I always claim the GAS and have to send to an exchange to sell it for KMD...

[20-Sep-18 05:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@tolken pondsea now goes by the name of @hyperDEX iirc

[20-Sep-18 05:38 PM] Jonathan#3687

[20-Sep-18 10:07 PM] tolken#2655
Hyperdex working well for most people? Just downloaded Linux version last night, didn‚Äôt seem to have much initial luck getting a trade to start.

i haven't been able to make a swap yet unfortunately

[21-Sep-18 12:05 AM] Jonathan#3687
If we encourage more volume I think that will change

[21-Sep-18 12:12 AM] tolken#2655
More volume? What do you mean?

[21-Sep-18 12:15 AM] tolken#2655
Im ready for volume.

Different gui

[21-Sep-18 04:13 PM] lukechilds#2707
@Regnar HyperDEx is just a GUI, we need the marketmaker devs to support new currencies, then we can enable them in HyperDEX

[21-Sep-18 04:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
For anyone having issues getting trades (@tolken) can you try installing this old build:
https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.12

[21-Sep-18 04:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
It was before GTC support was added

[21-Sep-18 04:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
I have a feeling GTC orders in markemaker may be quite buggy and are causing some issues

[21-Sep-18 09:19 PM] tolken#2655
@lukechilds I‚Äôll try this build tonight. üòÉ thanks!

How to retrieve Private key from HyperDEX ?  ETH\ERC20 , which not present in agama ?

[22-Sep-18 06:34 AM] Hermes#6934
This is how it works with Barterdex not sure if Hyperdex has the same command. You can also use the same seed on Barterdex and try to retrieve them https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024470-how-to-retrieve-private-key-from-barterdex

[22-Sep-18 07:13 AM] Andersen#8337
Didn't work.  In output  is different ETH address

[22-Sep-18 07:00 PM] tolken#2655
@lukechilds  Tried older build 0.1.0 alpha 12. Tried kmd/btc and kmd/bch, no cigar so far. I‚Äôm running it via a VM instance of Mint Linux for what it‚Äôs worth. I‚Äôll try and get a non vm attempt going next. Just need to find another machine.

[22-Sep-18 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`0.1.0-alpha.12
...72 commits to master since this release`

@tolken Do you reckon there's a reason there's been 72 commits and 5 releases since the build you're commenting about?

[22-Sep-18 09:19 PM] tolken#2655
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ yes they are constantly working to make Hyperdex feature parity with the underlying marketmaker functionality. More recently in bdex development, jl777 added some fill or gtc, can‚Äôt remember which as added most recently. Anyway, hyperdex has to be adapted to use those new options. It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess if that may have caused issues.

[22-Sep-18 09:54 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@tolken I'm not sure if gtc fits within the vision of HyperDEX or not, but my point was that an outdated version of any program not working is a moot point and I find it confusing why you would randomly try a specific known outdated code and then comment on it

[22-Sep-18 11:53 PM] tolken#2655
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ because the developer of Hyperdex requested (a few lines up) that I try the outdated code and provide feedback. Sometimes this is useful for debugging to know if an older version works for some people.

[23-Sep-18 12:26 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@tolken I apologize, I totally missed that ‚òπ

[23-Sep-18 03:10 AM] tolken#2655
Np, just tryin to get this figured out :/

[23-Sep-18 11:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@tolken will ask Luke to take a look tomorrow.

[23-Sep-18 12:13 PM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah, `0.1.0-alpha.12` was the last version before GTC was implemented, so wanted to see if people having issues getting matches stopped getting issues on versions without GTC

[23-Sep-18 12:20 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Well, I pretty much feel like an idiot for having said that without reading back and seeing the context

[25-Sep-18 12:31 AM] jspook16#3059
so do we need to be using the older version?

[25-Sep-18 04:27 AM] tolken#2655
@jspook16 didn‚Äôt help me.

Everyone should be using the latest version

[27-Sep-18 12:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
we just asked a few people to try an old release to see if it would resolve an issue

[27-Sep-18 12:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
but it didn't

[27-Sep-18 12:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
so the latest release is what's reccomended

[27-Sep-18 12:19 PM] lukechilds#2707
of course feel free to try older builds or nightlies if you want to experiment or help us track down bugs
