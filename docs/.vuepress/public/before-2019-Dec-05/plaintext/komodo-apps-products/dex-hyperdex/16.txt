click on the most recent 127.0.01 request

[10-Aug-18 12:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
you will be able to view the request/response

[10-Aug-18 12:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
if it looks related to your portfolio, view the one after it instead, that should be an order book request

[10-Aug-18 12:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
they alternate

[10-Aug-18 12:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
yep, the order book is empty

[10-Aug-18 12:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
that's coming directly from `marketmaker`

[10-Aug-18 12:51 PM] lukechilds#2707
you can right click a request `copy > copy as cURL` and then paste it into your terminal

[10-Aug-18 12:51 PM] lukechilds#2707
that is essentially using "CLI marketmaker"

[10-Aug-18 12:51 PM] lukechilds#2707
you will get the same response

[10-Aug-18 12:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd/btc also empty

[10-Aug-18 12:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
Can you try pasting this in the console:
```
_api.debug({method: 'getpeers'}).then(p => console.log('peers:', p.length))
```

[10-Aug-18 12:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but the funny thing is that barterdex does show an orderbook

[10-Aug-18 12:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
not open at the same time

[10-Aug-18 12:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
offc

[10-Aug-18 12:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
that is strange

[10-Aug-18 12:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
but it's definitely not a GUI issue

[10-Aug-18 12:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
could be an issue with the version of mm we're including

[10-Aug-18 12:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
ah

[10-Aug-18 12:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
there we go

[10-Aug-18 12:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
you aren't connected to any other peers

[10-Aug-18 12:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
we are planning to add an indicator for this somewhere

[10-Aug-18 12:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
is there any chance anyone else is running an mm instance on the same WAN IP as you?

[10-Aug-18 12:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Nah I'm at work

[10-Aug-18 12:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
have you tested at home and at work and got the same issue?

[10-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes

[10-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Same problem

[10-Aug-18 12:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
same machine or different?

[10-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And barter does work over there as well

[10-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
same machine

[10-Aug-18 12:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
what OS?

[10-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
osx

[10-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
let me check version

[10-Aug-18 12:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
hmmn

[10-Aug-18 12:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
very strange

[10-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
10.13.6

[10-Aug-18 12:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
no one else has reported this

[10-Aug-18 12:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
I'm not saying I don't believe you ðŸ˜œ

[10-Aug-18 12:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
but this is a very odd issue

[10-Aug-18 12:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
are you able to get your hands on another machine to test?

[10-Aug-18 12:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I tried a lot of things, turning off firewall etc

[10-Aug-18 12:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
mobile hotspot

[10-Aug-18 12:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
another machine with the same os? I'm afraid not

[10-Aug-18 12:59 PM] lukechilds#2707
can you run this in a terminal

[10-Aug-18 12:59 PM] lukechilds#2707
```
ps -Af | grep marketmaker | grep -v grep | wc -l
```

[10-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it say 1

[10-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
says*

[10-Aug-18 01:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
interesting

[10-Aug-18 01:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
I have an idea

[10-Aug-18 01:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
gimme a sec

[10-Aug-18 01:03 PM] lukechilds#2707
Are you comfortable with building from source?

[10-Aug-18 01:03 PM] lukechilds#2707
it's pretty simple

[10-Aug-18 01:03 PM] lukechilds#2707
the entire build process is automated

[10-Aug-18 01:03 PM] lukechilds#2707
You need Node.js and yarn installed

[10-Aug-18 01:03 PM] lukechilds#2707
I can talk you through it if you want to give it a go

[10-Aug-18 01:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sure

[10-Aug-18 01:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if it can help you guys

[10-Aug-18 01:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
thanks

[10-Aug-18 01:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
do you already have Node.js?

[10-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
no clue

[10-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I have installed a lot of stuff for verus about a month ago

[10-Aug-18 01:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
run 
```
which node
```
in a terminal

[10-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
homebrew and some libs I didnt have yet

[10-Aug-18 01:05 PM] snowdamn#2414
i would try deleting the HyperDEX folder in .config first, sorry for the trivial ðŸ˜Š

[10-Aug-18 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
just type 'which node' in terminal?

[10-Aug-18 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
does nothing

[10-Aug-18 01:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
yep

[10-Aug-18 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
try @snowdamn solution first?

[10-Aug-18 01:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
it didn't say
```
node not found
```
?

[10-Aug-18 01:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
no, that wont work for you

[10-Aug-18 01:06 PM] snowdamn#2414
killall, delete folder, run

[10-Aug-18 01:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
You can try but I don't think it will resolve the issue

[10-Aug-18 01:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
it appears to be an issue with mm

[10-Aug-18 01:07 PM] lukechilds#2707
the GUI is working as expected, but mm isn't connecting to any peers

[10-Aug-18 01:08 PM] snowdamn#2414
don't mean to beat a dead horse here, but definitely killall mm if you try

[10-Aug-18 01:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
need to shoot off for a sec, back in a min, run `brew install yarn` to get Node.js and yarn

[10-Aug-18 01:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ok doing now

[10-Aug-18 01:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
once that's done can you run
```
node --version && yarn --version
```

[10-Aug-18 01:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
node --version && yarn -- version
v10.8.0
yarn install v1.9.4

[10-Aug-18 01:16 PM] lukechilds#2707
no space in between `--` and `version`

[10-Aug-18 01:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
exactly like this:
```
node --version && yarn --version
```

[10-Aug-18 01:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
node --version && yarn --version
v10.8.0
1.9.4

[10-Aug-18 01:20 PM] lukechilds#2707
perfect

[10-Aug-18 01:20 PM] lukechilds#2707
now this will download the HyperDEX source code

[10-Aug-18 01:20 PM] lukechilds#2707
```
git clone https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex.git
```

[10-Aug-18 01:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
done

[10-Aug-18 01:21 PM] lukechilds#2707
now move into the folder

[10-Aug-18 01:21 PM] lukechilds#2707
```
cd hyperdex
```

[10-Aug-18 01:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
done

[10-Aug-18 01:21 PM] lukechilds#2707
and run
```
yarn start
```

[10-Aug-18 01:21 PM] lukechilds#2707
that will install all dependencies, build everything and then launch the built binary

[10-Aug-18 01:22 PM] lukechilds#2707
might take a few mins

[10-Aug-18 01:22 PM] lukechilds#2707
oh, make sure you close the current HyperDEX instance too if you still have that running

[10-Aug-18 01:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah just tought about that before starting the git clone process

[10-Aug-18 01:22 PM] lukechilds#2707

I'm seeing this before it starts building electron
