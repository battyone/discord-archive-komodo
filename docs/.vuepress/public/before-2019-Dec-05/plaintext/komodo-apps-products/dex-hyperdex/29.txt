yes i try

[27-Oct-18 07:47 PM] vogelfreund#4122
but which endpoint can i use

[27-Oct-18 07:50 PM] vogelfreund#4122
2min

[27-Oct-18 07:50 PM] vogelfreund#4122
same as before

[27-Oct-18 07:51 PM] vogelfreund#4122
cant connect to marketmaker

[27-Oct-18 07:54 PM] Hermes#6934
Can you verify if for some reason your AV or firewall could be blocking marketmaker process?

[27-Oct-18 07:55 PM] vogelfreund#4122
everything off

[27-Oct-18 07:55 PM] Hermes#6934
You can verify maybe in your task manager if marketmaker is launching

[27-Oct-18 07:55 PM] Hermes#6934
Which version of Windows you are using?

[27-Oct-18 07:55 PM] vogelfreund#4122
win7

[27-Oct-18 07:55 PM] Hermes#6934
it shouldn't make a difference but still just to have the information

[27-Oct-18 07:56 PM] Hermes#6934
ok will try to test this on a Win7 machine that I have ....and let you know if see something similar.

[27-Oct-18 07:56 PM] vogelfreund#4122
marketmaker.exe run in task m.

[28-Oct-18 12:49 PM] vogelfreund#4122
any ideas...?

[28-Oct-18 08:04 PM] Hermes#6934
@vogelfreund  I don't see an issue from this side but still ...if you want to make a fresh launch of Hyperdex I will recommend first making sure that you have your seed written down and verify that you don't have any stuck or pending swaps. If you meet these requirements you can go ahead and erase the Hyperdex folder located in  %appdata% /Roaming/ path if usin Windows. After erasing this folder try launching the application again  from the latest version and see if that solves the issue.

@jl777c  will CC dex fees also support DEX asset or new asset will be realeased ?

[29-Oct-18 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
CC dex is totally separate, each action requires a txfee

[29-Oct-18 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not cross chain

[05-Nov-18 11:44 PM] peritonlogon#7708
does hyperdex have the portfolio management stuff that  Barterdex has?

[05-Nov-18 11:48 PM] Hermes#6934
Here is how you enable your coins in Hyperdex @peritonlogon https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024473-how-to-enable-coins-tokens-assets-to-be-available-for-trading

[05-Nov-18 11:52 PM] peritonlogon#7708
Thanks! but that's not what I was asking.  Barterdex hads a portfolio management option where you could set goals for your portfolio and a % above or below coinmarketcap, that would automatically put in orders  at that amount.  Does Hyperdex have something functioning , or in the works like that?

[06-Nov-18 12:01 AM] Jonathan#3687
It doesn't currently @peritonlogon but I like the idea. Will create an enhancement request for it

how‚Äôs Hyperdex / Bdex working for everyone? Any improvement lately, or having difficulties trading? Activity last couple weeks  has been even slower than usual.

[09-Nov-18 10:07 AM] yo88#5530
which is currently better the barter dex or hyper dex that works with out bugs?

[09-Nov-18 10:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
barterdex is a bit more esoteric and technical. hyperdex is sleeker and simpler

[09-Nov-18 10:35 AM] actionslacks#4072
they both work, there is just a dearth of activity at the moment.

Yea that's the tough thing about P2P exchanges, if a person logs off, they take their liquidity with them. It would be cool to integrate the Oracles CC trollbox into HyperDEX. anytime you can keep users with HyperDEX open, the greater chance to have orders left open to provide liquidity, and also to find trading partners and ask about some of the coins on the DEX someone may not know about.

should i be using barterdex or hyperdex?\

Hyperdex is recommended they use the same marketmaker but Hyperdex makes trading a little bit easier for new users.

im used to barterdex

[25-Nov-18 08:53 PM] tolken#2655
People talk about BarterDex a good deal, then when they want to trade, just end up using a cex. Bums me out. :/

[26-Nov-18 05:37 AM] n64#7103
so if I send for example 100K game into my barterdex/hyperdex wallet to put on sale...does that mean it can only be sold if someone is buying 100k worth as well? it won‚Äôt partial fill anyone looking to buy say 5k at a time?

[26-Nov-18 05:38 AM] n64#7103
assume all 100k are for sale at the same price...so 1 utxo vs multiple

[26-Nov-18 06:47 AM] zatJUM#9924
@n64 Yes it can be filled by anyone willing to buy 5k, if your utxo match is

[26-Nov-18 06:48 AM] zatJUM#9924
If you sell 100k at the same price doesn't mean you have only one utxo. You can split your 100k in 20 x 5k at the same price.

does barterDEX or hyperDEX support ledger wallet? I see that early this year it the answer was "no" (https://komodoplatform.com/faq/can-we-use-hardware-wallets-ledger-or-trezor-while-trading-on-barterdex/). I am curious if this is still the case.

Nice! Is that just for KMD, or will this work for all smart addresses?

[27-Nov-18 02:15 PM] Hermes#6934
@luke  If you hold the private keys of KMD address in ledger you could send other KMD assetchains funds to this same KMD address because they KMD assets can share the same public key.

hey everyone

[28-Nov-18 03:10 AM] oyea#4849
i have a quick question

[28-Nov-18 03:11 AM] oyea#4849
is claiming the 5% reward only available in the agama wallet? I have my KMD on a Ledger Nano at the moment

[28-Nov-18 03:14 AM] oyea#4849
I read its possible to get the private key off the ledger with the BIP39 tool but id rather not go that route

[28-Nov-18 04:33 AM] tolken#2655
@oyea claiming not exclusive to Agama, but there is a bug in Ledger that prevents it. There‚Äôs a workaround in the works by lukechilds that will allow us to use Ledger to claim reward. He‚Äôs actively working on it now, but I‚Äôm unclear when it will be ready.

[28-Nov-18 05:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
@cantptalblonit are you still experiencing the issue? It's most likey once of your currencies Electrum server that's gone down, HyperDEX can't really "go down" as it's all local. However it should move on to the next server if one isn't responding.

@sindresorhus are you able to look into this?

[28-Nov-18 08:46 AM] sindresorhus#8187
@cantptalblonit Can you open HyperDEX, go to the Help menu, click "Debug mode". HyperDEX will restart. Then go to the "Debug" menu and click "Show Settings" and then copy-paste the contents and send it to me as a private message. Then try to replace the `enabledCurrencies` entry with `"enabledCoins": ["KMD", "CHIPS"],`, save, restart HyperDEX and then try logging in again.

[28-Nov-18 03:34 PM] cantptalblonit#9346
@sindresorhus I cannot log in all it keeps doing is spinning. Thank you!

[28-Nov-18 03:36 PM] cantptalblonit#9346
@sindresorhus  on the app settings the Custom Marketmaker URL has  Example: http://localhost:7783,  I accessed my funds through Barterdex and took care of it. So it must be I need to add a local host? Thanks
