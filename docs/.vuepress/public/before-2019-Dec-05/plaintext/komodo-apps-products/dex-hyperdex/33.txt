Also, are there any figures on what the BarterDEX system market is - I.e. the value of non-fiat crypto to crypto exchanges which take place a day?

Thanks for the reply. What I meant is the potential market. So, Binance does around $10bn per day. What percentage of that (and other exchanges) is made up of crypto to crypto pair trading (no fiat involved)...

[02-Feb-19 03:10 PM] hastrup#8742
would it be possible to pisck a coin to trade and then see what pairs it have. and then chose that market for trade?

[02-Feb-19 03:10 PM] hastrup#8742
hope it makes sense

[02-Feb-19 04:45 PM] beor#1569
Hi, BarterDEX or HyperDEX works with Trezor or Ledger Nano S?

[05-Feb-19 12:08 PM] tafen#3000
I see an error in barterdex.log file "COQUI LP_transaction_fromdata mismatched txid cf2681e68525066e1fb71d3adb2539ae6eec6a224c0923ed73af32dd54261282 vs 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

[05-Feb-19 07:27 PM] PTYX#6840
The hyperdex team is releasing a claim app for the ledger rewards. That seems like a step closer to integration but trading live with the ledger will probably take some time.

[07-Feb-19 05:22 PM] beor#1569
Ok, thanks!

[22-Feb-19 07:43 PM] supermanblockchain#3870
hey @artem.pikulin#0794! I see this answer from you earlier: 

```
artem.pikulin12/26/2018
@crypto999 Hi, swap protocol design discussions took place at 2015-2016: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1340621.msg13828271#msg13828271, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1364951 when there were just few coins with BIP65 (CLTV) support. The purpose was to allow one side of swap to send standard 2of2 multisig output so at least  Alice can swap the coin without CLTV.
Nowadays most coins have CLTV opcode support so swap protocol will be simplified in MM2, both payments will be hash/time locked outputs, Bob won't need 212% balance to trade anymore.
``` 

I understand about CLTV, but in an attack scenario I don't understand how this mitigates a Bob from "faking it" and accepting a bunch of trades but never filling them. In that scenario, wouldn't there be a bunch of Alice's doing "alicepayments" and locking their funds up when a malicious bob has no intention of actually sending his "bobpayment" (filling the order). This seems like it could cause a lot of trouble on the DEX, especially if a fake bob set a really low exchange rate which beat out other real bobs.

[22-Feb-19 07:44 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@supermanblockchain I think you should ask this in #dev-marketmaker

[22-Feb-19 07:47 PM] supermanblockchain#3870
thanks @KomodoWorld, I'll do that!

[23-Feb-19 11:02 PM] PTYX#6840
@supermanblockchain how could Bob fake it exactly?

[23-Feb-19 11:03 PM] PTYX#6840
If I'm not mistaken the Bob has to fulfill the same requirements as the Alice in terms of funds being available

Hi there. I have questions regarding the dex coin? Am i Right that 50% of the fees, once 1 million $ is reached, will be credited among the dex hodlers? What is the Max. Supply of the dex coin? Any difference to circulating supply? All decentralised Exchanges build uppon barterdex engine will Collect fees for the dex coin?

[21-Mar-19 09:28 AM] Hackelchen#9754
Where do i have to keep My dex in Order to get my chunk of the pile? Agama? What Will Be exactly credited? Kmd?

[21-Mar-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. max supply 1 million + a little for the small mining rewards

[21-Mar-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
the KMD address that has the DEX will get the revshare

[21-Mar-19 09:40 AM] CHMEX#0686
>>will be credited among the dex hodlers
yes
>> Max. Supply of the dex coin
1'000'060   increases 0.0001 / Block
>>All decentralised Exchanges build uppon barterdex engine will Collect fees for the dex coin
yes if they don't change the address, which in case passens breaks the protocol with barterdex by komodo
>>My dex in Order to get my chunk of the pile? Agama?
yes
>>What Will Be exactly credited? Kmd?
yes fees are converted to KMD and than dividend is paid to your KMD address

Ok i did buy some dex today on coinexchange, so i guess it was me pumping the Price this high. In average i paid 8 kmd for 1 dex, just calculated it. So i am Willing to Pay 8:1 kmd/dex ratio. What do you say?

[21-Mar-19 02:07 PM] Hackelchen#9754
And thx for the Link regarding the supernet asset. Could not find it on My own.
