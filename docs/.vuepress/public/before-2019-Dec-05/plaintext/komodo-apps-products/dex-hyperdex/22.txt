we've barely actually changed anything since alpha 13 and the beta

[18-Sep-18 09:23 PM] lukechilds#2707
it was mainly just house cleaning type stuff

[18-Sep-18 09:46 PM] Hermes#6934
yeah this is the same error I saw on Windows

[18-Sep-18 09:46 PM] Hermes#6934
Linux and Mac ok for now

[18-Sep-18 09:48 PM] tolken#2655
So we gunna see an uptick in bdex usage finally? üòÉ

[18-Sep-18 10:17 PM] Jonathan#3687
HyperDEX is the future of a broader adoption - more BarterDEX usage is only a good thing though üòÉ

[18-Sep-18 10:19 PM] jspook16#3059
Time to put up liquidity in barterdex!

[18-Sep-18 10:38 PM] vrcninja#5651
I'm getting the same login issue with the new version as well. Win 10

[18-Sep-18 10:38 PM] vrcninja#5651
Older version .13 and .12 work fine

Tried in a windows server but still having the same result

[18-Sep-18 11:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
Thanks for the feedback guys

[18-Sep-18 11:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
I will spin up a Windows VM and give this a test tomorrow

[18-Sep-18 11:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
it's pretty late here right now

[18-Sep-18 11:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
Any more info regarding the login issues would be helpful being posted here rather than Discord: https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/issues/525

It'll just get lost in Discord but we'll be tracking the issue on GitHub there.

[19-Sep-18 01:35 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Windows 10 Pro

[19-Sep-18 02:10 AM] nii236#2759
Congrats on the beta! Too bad about the Windows issues, hope you get it sorted soon

[19-Sep-18 02:11 AM] nii236#2759
Appending to some sort of error.log and having issue templates in GH might be a good idea

[19-Sep-18 02:15 AM] nii236#2759
I had similar problems in Electron, where just having the Windows environment there means that even tho Electron is cross-platform its never 0% bug free

[19-Sep-18 02:35 AM] nii236#2759
Wait hang on this release came out 5 days ago

[19-Sep-18 02:35 AM] nii236#2759
So I've already got it I think cause I installed it yesterday

[19-Sep-18 02:36 AM] nii236#2759
Any reason why BEER is not listed as a possible coin in HyperDex?

[19-Sep-18 02:43 AM] serf#4313
Same error as @Hollowman9000  Win 10 Pro and Win 7 Ent

[19-Sep-18 03:21 AM] nii236#2759
~~~Is there a punishment if I create an order then cancel it? I did this and now I have zero balance available to create new orders but I still have the balance in my wallet~~~

[19-Sep-18 04:43 AM] nii236#2759
Nevermind, CHIPS was selected intead of COQUI

[19-Sep-18 06:01 AM] Yassin#3685
same error @serf  @Hollowman9000   windows 10

Apologies to everyone experiencing issues on Windows, we've tracked down the error and will push a new release shortly

[19-Sep-18 09:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
For those interested in the reasoning, Windows seems to have a very low limit for the length of command arguments, we added a load of new currencies in this release which pushed the arguments we send to `marketmaker` over the edge, causing this error.

Heads up @grewalsatinder @jl777c, you will likely experience this issue on Windows too soon. We need a dynamic way to add currencies when `marketmaker` is already running to solve the issue.

[19-Sep-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
mm supports using a file for input, at least pretty sure it does, but it has been a long time ago

[19-Sep-18 09:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
ah, haven't seen any documentation on that

[19-Sep-18 09:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
that would likely get around the windows issue

[19-Sep-18 09:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
however is a bit cumbersome

[19-Sep-18 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
windows is a lot cumbersome...

[19-Sep-18 09:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
yep

[19-Sep-18 09:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
but dynamic enable/disable would be a much nicer solution and bring many other benefits to all OSs

[19-Sep-18 09:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
will create an issue for mmv2

[19-Sep-18 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure barterDEX GUI used the file method

[19-Sep-18 09:26 AM] snowdamn#2414
FYI: also happened on linux, goes away by deleting HyperDEX folder in .config

[19-Sep-18 09:28 AM] snowdamn#2414
@lukechilds denoting because you only referred to Windows, scratch if same thing

[19-Sep-18 09:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
I don't think it's the same thing, should work fine on Linux, if it was the same issue deleting the HyperDEX folder wouldn't solve it. You likely experience a different (but similar) issue

[19-Sep-18 09:29 AM] snowdamn#2414
well, it was the same Unhandled exception during login

[19-Sep-18 09:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
with an `ENAMETOOLONG` error?

[19-Sep-18 09:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
do you have a screenshot?

[19-Sep-18 09:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
or copy of the error

[19-Sep-18 09:30 AM] snowdamn#2414
no sorry, i quickly deleted folder

[19-Sep-18 09:30 AM] snowdamn#2414
i will screenhot if it happens again

[19-Sep-18 09:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
thanks

[19-Sep-18 09:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
I really don't think it's the same issue

[19-Sep-18 09:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
probably just a different error logging in, but yeah, if you encounter it again please get us a screen shot and we'll look into it

[19-Sep-18 09:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@lukechilds @jl777c yea Barterdex GUI uses file method in windows and in all other os since coinsdb feature update

[19-Sep-18 09:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
That is why app restart required on adding removing coin in local coins.json file

[19-Sep-18 10:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Windows always used file method

[19-Sep-18 10:07 AM] jusoaresf#3291
same here... will wait for new release

[19-Sep-18 10:38 AM] sindresorhus#8187
We have published a new beta release that fixes the login issue on Windows. Sorry for the inconvenience. https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/releases/latest

loaded just fine, sent beer from faucet. I am not seeing chips price yet

[19-Sep-18 12:16 PM] jusoaresf#3291
if the price input box is empty and I type ".01" couldn't it foresee I was trying a shortcut for 0.01 instead of 1 as it understands now?

[19-Sep-18 12:51 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
hmm, loading endless

[19-Sep-18 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I had that problem, needed to remove appdata iirc

[19-Sep-18 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but with one of the last alfa builds

[19-Sep-18 01:46 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
takes 30 seconds on each login

[19-Sep-18 02:32 PM] nii236#2759
So if I use the same seed across two computers, my wallets should have the same balance right? (They didn't, had to use the COQUI faucet again)

[19-Sep-18 03:34 PM] general_grievous#6992
Just got hyperdex on my mac, but when I try to log in it displays the 'logging in' screen indefinitely. Anything I can do?

[19-Sep-18 03:43 PM] snowdamn#2414
@general_grievous what OS and do you have your seed saved?

[19-Sep-18 03:46 PM] snowdamn#2414
if you have seed, delete HyperDEX folder in .config (linux)/AppData (Windows)

[19-Sep-18 03:47 PM] snowdamn#2414
if you do not have seed, wait until it loads and/or new release

[19-Sep-18 03:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
We have also experienced very slow login times

[19-Sep-18 03:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
this is an issue with the way `marketmaker` handle's enabling ETOMIC for ETH/ERC20 trades

[19-Sep-18 03:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
a fix is in the works

[19-Sep-18 05:07 PM] general_grievous#6992
@snowdamn on osx, and I do have my seed. Will see if I can find that on the Mac version.

[19-Sep-18 05:08 PM] general_grievous#6992
@lukechilds thanks. I'll wait for the next release.

[19-Sep-18 05:08 PM] general_grievous#6992
Any estimates on when it will be production ready?

[19-Sep-18 05:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
There is a partial fix available for mm which should reduce the login time a bit

[19-Sep-18 05:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
we're adding it to our master branch

[19-Sep-18 05:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
and will release when it's stable

[19-Sep-18 05:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
maybe sometime next week

[19-Sep-18 05:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
or you can install the latest nightly if you don't wanna wait for an official release

[19-Sep-18 05:10 PM] general_grievous#6992
That makes sense.. I only want to mess around with the test assets anyway

[19-Sep-18 06:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
latest mm is in master and seems to make a huge difference in login time

[19-Sep-18 06:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
previously enabling ETOMIC was taking about 45 seconds for me, it's now down to 0.5 seconds

"Grandma Friendly Atomic Swaps" is honestly the best marketing ahahaha, considering the 50+ demographic will be the most difficult to support with their general lack of tact with technology.

The top of the window is also off my screen for some reason so I can‚Äôt do that either.
