it will match the 20 and give change

[28-Dec-18 04:37 PM] Hermes#6934
When you are doing an atomic swap , it will match the closest UTXO that you have available...

Strange, I get login errors sometimes but it's usually temporary and I have windows 10 too. Yeah a reinstall is probably best, if that doesn't work open an issue here https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/issues/

Hi, i can't see any orders on hyperdex (yesterday i see some orders for btc, zec, pgt), all is empty (on windows). I have placed an order for buy PGT but nothing works, in addition to this when i close hyperdex my order is cancelled.

[29-Dec-18 12:52 PM] Senda#7983
Is there any guide to use? Thanks

[30-Dec-18 10:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Senda Do you have the same issue with barterDEX GUI?

[30-Dec-18 11:34 AM] Senda#7983
I only have used Hyperdex. @SadykovT  and me have tried to do atomicswaps with kmd and Pungo. But we don't see each other

[30-Dec-18 11:35 AM] Senda#7983
Barterdex is so technical?

[30-Dec-18 11:35 AM] Senda#7983
I'm going to try with it @hyperDEX

[30-Dec-18 11:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Trying barterDEX GUI should help to see if it is a MM related issue or related to HyperDEX or not

[30-Dec-18 11:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
barterDEX should be ok, just got more options and less grandma friendliness

[30-Dec-18 11:39 AM] SadykovT#2123
on barterdex no pungo

[30-Dec-18 11:39 AM] Senda#7983
Oohh no pungo üò¢

[01-Jan-19 04:16 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
will take a look but not sure if barterdex is updating anytime soon

[01-Jan-19 04:17 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I think I saw in they readme the steps to get listed, will pass to the team to take a look someday soon

Possible project to reach out to move onto kmd as well as share liquidity? üòÆ

[02-Jan-19 01:27 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
They charge their own token and share fees

Eg pay once off 100000 tokens and fees are split 50 50
Pay 200000 tokens and fees are 70 30
Pay 400000 tokens and fees are 90 10

 Think their cheapest package is 5500 usd. Not sure how Dex work or if compatible or anything but it could be worth a shot getting into contact. New coin, their first Dex launch in a week and they have a tiny mcap

[02-Jan-19 06:18 PM] crypto999#4866
Just wanted to follow up on the comment about there being no incentive for nodes to broadcast orders. As such, 1) what's in it for nodes to relay orders/manage order books and 2) incentivize them not to be bad actors?

[02-Jan-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
what incentive is there for BTC nodes to relay packets and manage the blockchain?

[02-Jan-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
or for any crypto for that matter?

[02-Jan-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
this requirement that people wont do something if they are not paid to do it, is not always valid

[02-Jan-19 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
there will likely be those that are bad actors, so the important thing is that there is no economic gain, then it is just a nuisance factor. the atomic swap (with enough confirmations) is designed so that either both sides happen, or neither does

[07-Jan-19 11:42 AM] sindresorhus#8187
New HyperDEX release is out. We recommend everyone upgrade as it fixes problems with KMD and many assets chains. https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/releases/latest

@lukechilds  Hi. A new hyperdex has been released, but I still don't see any orders and can't make a swap (KMD-PGT). Maybe you can connect to team wiever and show what's wrong ? if you have free time of course.

[07-Jan-19 02:53 PM] SadykovT#2123
since it is possible to make one exchange per minute, there is a lack of a visible timer.

[08-Jan-19 06:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
@SadykovT If there are no orders showing it's because there are no market makers placing orders on the BarterDEX network. This is unrelated to HyperDEX which is just a GUI interface for the BarterDEX network.

[08-Jan-19 06:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
A lot of people seem confused with the relationship between BarterDEX and HyperDEX

[08-Jan-19 06:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
BarterDEX is a protocol for P2P order matching and atomic swaps

[08-Jan-19 06:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
HyperDEX is a GUI frontend to allow you to view and interact with the BarterDEX network

[08-Jan-19 06:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
As a basic analogy, Imagine the BarterDEX network is BitTorrent, and HyperDEX is your torrent client (say for example Transmission).
If you were trying to download a torrent but you had no seeders, that's an issue with the BitTorrent network, not the Transmission torrent client.
You wouldn't contact the Transmission devs and ask them to screenshare with you to get your torrent to download.

Hi. I am here for the same problem, stuck on swap 4/5.  I followed the https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024479-my-swap-is-stuck-what-to-do-now- instruction 5 hours ago, but still nothing returned. Any suggestion for a next step?

[23-Jan-19 02:06 PM] Jurjen#9294
To be sure, the documentation is speaking about 'UUID' , but Hyperdex is showing 'ID' when I click to the swap. I guess this is the same?

[23-Jan-19 07:01 PM] PTYX#6840
Yes it should be the same

[23-Jan-19 08:25 PM] Jurjen#9294
@PTYX thanks

[23-Jan-19 08:26 PM] Jurjen#9294
Any idea about a next step, do I have to try multiple times? Are there other solutions? If not, will it be lost and if so, should I report it somewhere for research?

[23-Jan-19 08:28 PM] SHossain#0007
wait for 24 hours and then start HyperDEX again. it should be back automatically after starting it. if not use the above guide

[24-Jan-19 05:59 AM] Jurjen#9294
@SHossain Do you mean I have to try it again? I used the above guide yesterday. Still 1 hour to go before 24 hours, but nothing returned yet.

Here is my stupid question of the day: what is the difference between BarterDEX and a wallet? Both hold coins, which you can deposit and withdraw to and from. Is it just the swap element?

Binance Dex boasting a lot now about their tx per second.

[29-Jan-19 04:16 AM] CHMEX#0686
By definition of a DEX the tx limit is the thruput of the slowest chain in the swap no?

[29-Jan-19 08:28 AM] tolken#2655
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre claiming atomic swaps, so may not apply.
