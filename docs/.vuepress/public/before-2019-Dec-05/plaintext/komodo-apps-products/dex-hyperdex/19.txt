ha just realized; i started the client from a different location as the previous version... that could be the issue ^^

what is the expected release that will include Verus on hyperdex?

[19-Aug-18 03:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
As soon as they add support to Electrum for VerusHash we will be able to support them

it's been awhile since I logged into barterdex but what's going on with it?

[30-Aug-18 04:32 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
it's not working for me anymore and all I did was update to the latest barterdex on github

[30-Aug-18 04:32 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
everything is saying undefined

[30-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
You need to remove all coins and add them again in the manage coins sections

[30-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
section

[30-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[30-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
There is a how to for it somewhere

Hi

[31-Aug-18 06:07 AM] Maha#5777
I have one doubt regarding the BarterDEX exchange platform

[31-Aug-18 06:11 AM] Maha#5777
Who will be holding the  transaction fee in DEX platform ?

[31-Aug-18 06:12 AM] coingirl87#6489
Whats going on with barter dex? There is no volume since weeks...is the project dead?

[31-Aug-18 07:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @Maha The fees distributing to holders of the DEX asset chain tokens. An average fee is ~0.15%

[31-Aug-18 07:22 AM] TonyL#3577
@coingirl87 We are currently working on marketmaker 2.0 (MM2.0) which is planned for Q1 2019. There will be new features and it will be more user-friendly ( e.g. 100% ordermatch, regardless of utxo state)
 + Mobile DEX planning on approximately Q2 2019. So it's not dead and actively developing at the moment.

[31-Aug-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems people dont want to use the DEX other than for testing and now the testing is not active,the DEX is not so active

[31-Aug-18 07:25 AM] TonyL#3577
I think more userfriendly software, marketing promotions and some market makers providing liquidity can solve this issue

[31-Aug-18 03:22 PM] PTYX#6840
a user friendly interface is already available. it's hyperdex. the problem is that it's not easy to make sell orders on hyperdex unless there is a counter order in the orderbook already. So noone is using it

[31-Aug-18 03:23 PM] PTYX#6840
the traditional barterdex which allowed you to make a sell and keep it there until the connection died or someone picked it up is to hard to use.

[31-Aug-18 03:25 PM] PTYX#6840
when a user can login, make a sell or buy order, walk away, and come back when it's fulfilled then we will see increased users. until then, we will only see weekend warriors.

[31-Aug-18 05:03 PM] rainbro7#4735
There are no liquidity provider incentive programs? Can barterdex work with smartcontracts? For example, can people join a crypto picking competition (by donating som coins) and the winner be determined by a smart contract? Idk if its possible, just sounded like an interesting free marketing idea. I know there are other problems like liquidity, marketcap, etc... Just throwing things out there..

[31-Aug-18 05:05 PM] rainbro7#4735
It's sad that basic dexs are being used when this has more possibilities :(

[31-Aug-18 05:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
A liquidity provider reaps the spread

[01-Sep-18 02:52 AM] kremer#4440
i could not get hyperdex to work..seems to be more of the issue

[01-Sep-18 02:53 AM] Hermes#6934
Which version and which Os you are using ?

[01-Sep-18 02:54 AM] kremer#4440
it was maybe 2 months ago, so things may have changed since

is anyone having issues swapping on hyperdex?

[01-Sep-18 05:36 PM] PTYX#6840
i've not been able to fulfill a swap in any pair today

[01-Sep-18 05:56 PM] jorian#4555
i have done some swaps successfully today

[01-Sep-18 05:57 PM] jorian#4555

[01-Sep-18 08:00 PM] tolken#2655
I have bobs up with all combinations of kmd, ltc, bch, btc. Not a lot of UTXOs, but enough to trade for those that want to. I‚Äôll add larger UTXOs later this week for btc, probably in 0.1 and 0.5 sizes.

[01-Sep-18 08:01 PM] tolken#2655
It seems quite often I‚Äôm the only bob alive for several pairs.

[01-Sep-18 08:01 PM] tolken#2655
I have seen trades against all pairs, not in every order, but at least once with every pair.

[01-Sep-18 08:02 PM] tolken#2655
So come on hyperdex users, let‚Äôs start trading üòÉ

[01-Sep-18 08:36 PM] jorian#4555
it seems james' nodes are unresponsive, so it's only cipi and you

[01-Sep-18 08:36 PM] jorian#4555
still, liquidity is way too low

[01-Sep-18 08:58 PM] jspook16#3059
im working on setting up a couple of machines so i can add a bit of liquidity as well

[01-Sep-18 08:58 PM] jspook16#3059
trying to get as much done as i can this weekend

[01-Sep-18 11:01 PM] tolken#2655
Liqudity is mostly low due to Alice‚Äôs not buying.

[01-Sep-18 11:01 PM] tolken#2655
More bobs are helpful but you can put all the offers you want out there. If no one wants to accept them, you can‚Äôt really force the issue short of wash trading.

[01-Sep-18 11:02 PM] PTYX#6840
my swaps are getting stuck 2/5

[01-Sep-18 11:02 PM] tolken#2655
What pair are you trying?

[01-Sep-18 11:02 PM] tolken#2655
What address are you swapping with?

[01-Sep-18 11:03 PM] tolken#2655
I see about a trade a day on my bob, sometimes a half dozen or so. Mostly kmd/bch

[01-Sep-18 11:05 PM] PTYX#6840
i'm trying zilla/kmd right now. i see one got to 3/5

[01-Sep-18 11:06 PM] PTYX#6840
but it is stuck again

[01-Sep-18 11:06 PM] PTYX#6840
i'll try another pair

[01-Sep-18 11:08 PM] tolken#2655
Oh yea, I have a little zilla, maybe I‚Äôll open up a bob for that.

[01-Sep-18 11:21 PM] tolken#2655
Isn‚Äôt step 3 Bob payment?

[01-Sep-18 11:24 PM] PTYX#6840
alice payment

[01-Sep-18 11:25 PM] PTYX#6840
i just tried chips and it stays open

[01-Sep-18 11:25 PM] PTYX#6840
so from what i gathered, hyperdex now let's you set an order and it won't stay open until cancelled?

[01-Sep-18 11:25 PM] PTYX#6840

[01-Sep-18 11:27 PM] PTYX#6840

[04-Sep-18 12:38 AM] jspook16#3059
is there a way to choose fill or kill on hyperdex....i know it was updated to leave the orders open but I also like the feature from before

[04-Sep-18 03:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont think we have that option in there. The liquidity is not great either so best to leave it open and hopefully it can fill at least some of it.

[04-Sep-18 03:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Hermes I will get @luke to take a look

[04-Sep-18 03:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Luke can you take a look at what @PTYX posted above (unless that is what we were talking about yesterday) üòÉ

@Regnar we have an even better BTC address that will be included in the beta release: `1HyperDEXfMx459ZFh6Ram5uymS8AiRAQf`

@Hermes have you been able to launch the new version on mac yet?

[04-Sep-18 02:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It just keeps loading forever here

[04-Sep-18 02:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
looking into this today

[04-Sep-18 02:09 PM] Hermes#6934
Yes it did but it had that issue that I showed but after launching again it worked , it could had something to do with my connection , will be testing it shortly again just getting back to the desk

[04-Sep-18 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
some one found something with that the other day I think may be related... there is a file marketmaker creates, called myipaddress or something, if that file is blank the network does not work properly. maybe something to check? @lukechilds

[04-Sep-18 02:25 PM] lukechilds#2707
would be good to ge that reported as a mm bug so it can get fixed upstream but we can definitely look into adding a workaround on our end and nuking the file if it's empty before mm starts

[04-Sep-18 02:25 PM] lukechilds#2707
@blackjok3r do you have any more deets?

[04-Sep-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant remember exactly dude... but someone wrote on some channel somwhere that he had conenction issues and found that removing that file and restarting fixed it

[04-Sep-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on linux it creates that file where I start marketmaker for using cli

[04-Sep-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess witout knowing what its ip is it cant bind the network or something..

[04-Sep-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Cryptoon do you still have that Mac that wont load orderbooks? Might be a good place to start.

[04-Sep-18 02:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No it just stays on loading forever

[04-Sep-18 02:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
One minute will try again and make screengrab

[04-Sep-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so you have new issue now ?

[04-Sep-18 02:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yes
