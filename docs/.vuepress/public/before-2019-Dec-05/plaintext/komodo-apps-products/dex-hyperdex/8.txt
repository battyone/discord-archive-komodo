@7rank No way to view private keys currently, however the seed is compatible with Agama and other Komodo software, so you can import your seed into those tools

[28-Jun-18 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <sindresorhus> We are going to add ability to view the private key very soon.

[28-Jun-18 01:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
*View the seed, not the private keys

[28-Jun-18 02:45 PM] 7rank#9952
@lukechilds thanks, I'll try that.  Btw, XSG is having an electrum server error, so funds sent don't show up. FYI

After running the install and opening the program I entered my password and then was met with this error box.

I'm having issues with barterdex not loading other coins it states there are no electrum servers available

[29-Jun-18 04:05 AM] Bing#9724
uninstalled and reinstalled both agama(0.2.41-beta) and barterdex (1.1.0)

You're probably better off in #dev-tradebots looking for BarterDEX help @Bing 
BarterDEX and HyperDEX are different products

[29-Jun-18 04:08 AM] Bing#9724
thank you

[30-Jun-18 05:47 AM] agnewpickens#7393
I have had the same error with Hyper DEX since rc6, previous release worked fine.

[30-Jun-18 05:55 AM] agnewpickens#7393
2015 MS redistributable - Loaded with latest Agama, will give the Hyper DEX another reload try.

[30-Jun-18 05:57 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Nope

[30-Jun-18 06:06 AM] agnewpickens#7393
You have the link to Barter DEX 1.1.0, I am running 1.0.4 and some of coins showing Electrum server sisues, though most balances showing just fine.

will my offers in barterdex reflect on hyperdex?

[01-Jul-18 10:51 PM] cipi#4502
Sure. BarterDEX and HyperDEX are GUIs for the same backend: marketmaker (https://github.com/jl777/SuperNET)

[01-Jul-18 10:54 PM] dudezmobi#1945
great arigathanks

[02-Jul-18 10:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
If you mean can you view trade history you made in BarterDEX in HyperDEX then no you can't
They use the same `marketmaker` daemon but are completely isolated instances

[03-Jul-18 08:24 AM] gcharang#6833
@dudezmobi  what luke said is true. But if you meant: do the offers you make in BarterDEX be available for other users using  HyperDEX, then that's correct, both of them will hav same orderbooks as their backends are the same

i think the  hyperdex devs like github issues if you've got the evidence already @Deleted User

[04-Jul-18 05:17 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
is it maybe a glitch result of sending it to yourself?

@WhiteWidow I don't think we will consider this beta until `marketmaker` v2 is released for us to build on, which may be a while

[04-Jul-18 07:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Deleted User Are you able to submit a GitHub issue with as much info as possible and we'll take a look into it

[04-Jul-18 09:06 AM] WhiteWidow#8771
@lukechilds K, thx for the update.

[04-Jul-18 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if you do a withdraw to yourself, the change output is merged to the last output value

[04-Jul-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
so it might be that an extra output of 0.0001 would be needed to be the one to be merged into

[04-Jul-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
eg. input 1 output 0.01 -> change 0.99 -> notices it is the same destination and merges to a single output

[04-Jul-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
minimizing utxo explosion is the reason for this

[04-Jul-18 10:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Deleted User 
>I was trying to generate a BCH sell order, for 0.01 BCH.
>HyperDEX generated utxo for 0.1 instead.

Btw, HyperDEX has nothing to do with selecting the UTXOs for the sell orders or withdrawals. We just pass the parameters you set to `marketmaker` it and will place an order as close as it can to what you requested based on the UTXOs available. So this is `marketmaker` behaviour, unrelated to the GUI. The same issue will likely occur with the BarterDEX GUI or using the CLI

[04-Jul-18 10:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
So if you want to open an issue to track this, best to open an issue on the SuperNET repo

Hey guys

[04-Jul-18 02:02 PM] cyrotiv#7483
May I know how do I add coins to hyperdex?

[04-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Jonathan#3687
It's in the Settings view

[04-Jul-18 02:20 PM] cyrotiv#7483
Sorry let me rephrase: how do I add newly created kmd asset chains/coins to the hyperdex?

[04-Jul-18 02:25 PM] sindresorhus#8187
@cyrotiv You need to add the coin info and electrum servers to https://github.com/jl777/coins first. Then we'll pull it into HyperDEX. If your coin has a logo, also open an issue here to get a nice icon for it: https://github.com/hyperdexapp/cryptocurrency-icons

you only get the problem on win 10 and not on mac?

[05-Jul-18 08:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
are you sure you're using the latest build on both OSs?

[05-Jul-18 08:06 AM] yugyug#3152
yup the latest build on from github, i try to use barterdex in win10 and got no problem  only in hyperdex got a problem.

[05-Jul-18 08:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
can you open the app?

[05-Jul-18 08:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
you only get the issue when you try and login?

[05-Jul-18 08:27 AM] yugyug#3152
still stuck at logging in

[05-Jul-18 08:27 AM] yugyug#3152
i can't  open the app

[05-Jul-18 08:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
Can you try going to `Debug > Show App Data` and move that entire folder somewhere
It's very important you don't delete it if you have already been using HyperDEX as it'll contain your encrypted seeds and trade history, just move it somewhere safe, and we can try and move it back later.
If you haven't done any trades or deposited any funds you can just delete it

[05-Jul-18 08:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
then try re-opening the app

[05-Jul-18 10:49 PM] jlbaseball11#9102
What is the payout schedule for the DEX coin?

[05-Jul-18 11:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
I think you need to ask in another channel, I have no idea, this is just for HyperDEX

[06-Jul-18 12:32 AM] jlbaseball11#9102
ok thanks

[06-Jul-18 01:09 AM] 7rank#9952
@yugyug @lukechilds I had the same issue as yugyug.  Exact error stated... I did what you suggested and was able to log in.  What are the next steps to restore original keys?

[06-Jul-18 03:05 AM] lukechilds#2707
do you have swap history?

[06-Jul-18 03:05 AM] lukechilds#2707
or you only need the keys

[06-Jul-18 03:09 AM] 7rank#9952
@lukechilds just wanted to reinstate previous portfolio as I transferred some funds there

[06-Jul-18 03:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
So if you don't care about trade history, only the seed (funds), you can simple copy the portfolio folder from the backup you took into the new app data folder

[06-Jul-18 03:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
restart the app and it will list your previous portfolios and allow you to log in

[06-Jul-18 03:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
you will need to re-enable any non default currencies

[06-Jul-18 03:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
and it won't have your trade history

[06-Jul-18 03:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
but any funds you had will be there

[06-Jul-18 04:46 AM] TomiDCat#6017
Say I want to swap for  some kmd. Which coin should I send to hyperdex out of btc,ltc and bch

Hi all, is HyperDEX a GUI for BarterDEX or is something different?

[06-Jul-18 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they both use the same back end.

@JackLeFou The trade system has been called BarterDEX and the 1st major reference GUI bears the same name; HyperDEX in an alternative GUI

[06-Jul-18 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
One of the main differences between the GUIs is that HyperDEX focuses on lite/SPV mode and "BarterDEX GUI" was designed to be a full reference implementation (meaning that it has "everything but the kitchen sink" in it)
