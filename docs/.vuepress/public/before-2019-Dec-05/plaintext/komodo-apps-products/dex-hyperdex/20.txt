This one

[04-Sep-18 02:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Barterdex works fine

[04-Sep-18 02:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
When I close it with the red button upperleft corner it says something like could not connect to marketmaker

the marketmaker is not starting for sure.

[04-Sep-18 02:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yep

[04-Sep-18 02:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Going to restart my system later and try again, need to get some real life work done first

[04-Sep-18 02:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
if it gets stuck logging in can you open the network tab in dev tools and and see what's going on

[04-Sep-18 02:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
dev tools doesnt even open yet

[04-Sep-18 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Other network and firewall off still the same thing

[04-Sep-18 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What is the best way to remove everything?

[04-Sep-18 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Just delete the folder?

[04-Sep-18 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Going to try fresh reinstall if that helps

[04-Sep-18 03:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, from the menu bar there is an option to delete the app data folder

[04-Sep-18 03:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
that nukes everything

[04-Sep-18 03:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
including mm files

[04-Sep-18 03:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
portfolios, config, seed etc

[04-Sep-18 03:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I got the debug log open while it still gives me this screen

[04-Sep-18 03:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Anything you want me to check before I delete everything?

[04-Sep-18 03:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah, on the network tab

[04-Sep-18 03:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
in dev tools

[04-Sep-18 03:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
what is the most recent request

[04-Sep-18 03:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
before that a lot of request payloads for different coins

[04-Sep-18 03:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
hmmn

[04-Sep-18 03:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
was it pending?

[04-Sep-18 03:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
if not

[04-Sep-18 03:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you scroll up, is there a request that is pending

[04-Sep-18 03:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
the mm requests all block eachother and happen one at a time

[04-Sep-18 03:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
but the coin gecko requests and other API requests can happen in parralel

[04-Sep-18 03:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That is the last one from 12.0.0.1

[04-Sep-18 03:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
after that only coingecko stuff

[04-Sep-18 03:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So maybe it's the lack of glxt electrum servers that is blocking everything?

[04-Sep-18 03:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
it could be

[04-Sep-18 03:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
there was a bug in mm that meant non-existent electrum servers would hang mm for an insane amount of time

[04-Sep-18 03:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
but we reported it to James and it was fixed and we tested it

[04-Sep-18 03:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
so now it should just give an error after ~5 seconds and move on

[04-Sep-18 03:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah it just keeps hanging at the 'logging in' screen

[04-Sep-18 03:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And when I close that screen it just says could not connect to mm

[04-Sep-18 03:21 PM] lukechilds#2707
is this after a full reset?

[04-Sep-18 03:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Only app delete not deleted everything yet

[04-Sep-18 03:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
will proceed now

[04-Sep-18 03:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
After doing a delete app data, the app relaunches and now it launches

[04-Sep-18 03:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Well launches without getting stuck at loading

[04-Sep-18 03:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So it was indeed an issue with GLX

[04-Sep-18 03:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Gracie @lukechilds 👌🏼

[04-Sep-18 03:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And I can see orderbooks, so the issue I had with the previous version is also gone 😊

[04-Sep-18 03:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Will try some trades later on and see if MM still crashes after 15 mins

[04-Sep-18 03:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
awesome, good to hear!

[04-Sep-18 04:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm I am not seeing orderbooks

[04-Sep-18 04:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Only for kmd/btc and only one on each side

[04-Sep-18 04:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[04-Sep-18 04:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Last line I cut off which was the userpass, not sure if that is sensitive info or not

[04-Sep-18 04:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah and now the only kmd/btc order there was is also gone

[04-Sep-18 04:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Tried on different networks/toggling firewall on/off etc

[04-Sep-18 04:33 PM] jorian#4555
on CLI there are 4 bids and 3 asks for DEX/KMD

[04-Sep-18 04:34 PM] jorian#4555
but i doubt you'll get anything from them.. james' nodes are slow af, he probably needs to clean his wallets

[04-Sep-18 04:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Nothing seems to be appearing on barterdex either...

[04-Sep-18 04:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Wait no

[04-Sep-18 04:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm seeing 3 sellers and 2 buyers now

[04-Sep-18 04:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
shutdown barter and restarted hyper, nothing there

[04-Sep-18 04:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Will keep it open for a while to see if it changes in time

[04-Sep-18 05:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Nothing on hyper 😦

[04-Sep-18 05:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
gtg, if someone else has the same problem let me know, but it's probably marketmaker related

[04-Sep-18 05:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to find where the hell that IP file is saved and remove it

[04-Sep-18 05:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you change networks, it will break the network connectivity of marketmaker

[04-Sep-18 05:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Is it different files for barter and hyper?

[04-Sep-18 05:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
In car now will search later

[04-Sep-18 07:12 PM] Hermes#6934
@blackjok3r  I think this is what you were referring to Figured it out. The "myipaddress" file in .Barterdex directory was empty for some reason. Put my ip in there manually, lanuched it and started giving all kinds of errors. I deleted the file and let bdex create it on the next launch and the ip was filled in and my orders are showing up now."

[04-Sep-18 07:13 PM] Hermes#6934
From here using MacOs 10.12.6 Sierra the newest version is launching without an issue for now

[04-Sep-18 08:25 PM] lukechilds#2707
To find the IP file open the app and click `Debug > Show App Data`. The folder that then pops up will contain a folder called `marketmaker`, open that folder. The IP file should be inside called `myipaddr`. That should work on all OSs

[04-Sep-18 08:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Delete that file?

[04-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But I deleted all appdata earlier today

[04-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So that one should also have been deleted?

[04-Sep-18 08:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah, was just putting that info out there

[04-Sep-18 08:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you deleted app data then you deleted the mm IP file too

[07-Sep-18 09:35 AM] Hegelian#0018
Hi, I havent used barterdex in months is it now called hypdex? What do I download? One or both?

@Hegelian

[07-Sep-18 10:18 AM] Hegelian#0018
So I should delete my old barterdex?

[07-Sep-18 10:18 AM] Hegelian#0018
And there is no such thing as barterdex anymore?

[07-Sep-18 10:19 AM] Hegelian#0018
And on CMC they still show barterdex

[07-Sep-18 11:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
barterdex and hyperdex share the same internals

[07-Sep-18 11:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So cmc also counts hyperdex

[07-Sep-18 02:26 PM] lukechilds#2707
BarterDEX is the name of the network

[07-Sep-18 02:26 PM] lukechilds#2707
there are two GUI implementations

[07-Sep-18 02:26 PM] lukechilds#2707
one also called BarterDEX

[07-Sep-18 02:26 PM] lukechilds#2707
and one called HyperDEX

[07-Sep-18 02:27 PM] lukechilds#2707
well, there may be more, but those are the two most popular I'm aware of

[07-Sep-18 02:27 PM] lukechilds#2707
so you have the BarterDEX GUI and the HyperDEX GUI which are both GUI frontends for the BarterDEX network

Trouble getting past the login screen w hyperdex

[07-Sep-18 04:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
which version and operating system?

[07-Sep-18 04:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think removing appdata helped for me

[07-Sep-18 07:03 PM] Hermes#6934
@LQDHVN  still experimenting issues?
