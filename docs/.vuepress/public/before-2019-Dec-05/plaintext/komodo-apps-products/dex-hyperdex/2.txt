Sure, we already have some internal designs done but it would be great to see another perspective

Getting this one when trying to withdraw DEX

[01-Jun-18 09:52 AM] cryptoon#0000
was DEX still having spv issues or is there an other reason?

[01-Jun-18 09:54 AM] cryptoon#0000
Is someone pegging DEX to a fiat value or is there another reason it is up 60% in kmd value in a week? 😛

Seems like latest build has issues. But artem is not going to be availbale in a couple of days

[01-Jun-18 12:03 PM] pondsea#0000
<@U7B8VF6TB> <@U8NFS11R9> could we compile our own for the time being? @siu - Chainmakers we could just use the mm from before the latest if that is the issue

[01-Jun-18 12:04 PM] siu#0000
Seems like the issue has been there for a few releases

[01-Jun-18 12:04 PM] pondsea#0000
What is the main issue?

[01-Jun-18 12:22 PM] siu#0000
It seems to crash and not start a swap

[01-Jun-18 12:22 PM] siu#0000
Thats why many swaps die at start

<@U8NFS11R9> Which MM version are you using for this new alpha. Is it etomic ?

[05-Jun-18 05:08 AM] lukechilds123#0000
but to clarify, we’re using Artem’s build which has supported etomic for a long time

[05-Jun-18 05:08 AM] lukechilds123#0000
we just aren’t making use of it yet

Hi, Is there any HyperDEX presentation materials available.  I'm also after recommended links.

[05-Jun-18 09:44 AM] acura360#0000
On Youtube there are several Videos about HyperDex

[05-Jun-18 09:48 AM] gcharang#0000
<@U93ET4RU4> see if any of these are useful to you: https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/305856581/HyperDEX

[05-Jun-18 10:50 AM] cris20#0000
Thanks, <@U9LBB4CTG>. I've gone through that and tried out HyperDEX this afternoon. If there is anymore info, particularly on its user benefits I'd be grateful!

[05-Jun-18 10:51 AM] gcharang#0000
What do you mean by user benefits? Benefits over other DEXs or barterDEX?

[05-Jun-18 10:57 AM] cris20#0000
Basically its selling points and how it will benefit BarterDEX and Kmd through user experience.  I can come up with some obvious ones and am looking for some that I haven't thought of.

[05-Jun-18 12:51 PM] pondsea#0000
Have you used command line or barterdex gui?

[05-Jun-18 12:52 PM] pondsea#0000
Main thing it does, it tries to hide all the stuff grandma doesnt care or need to know about

[05-Jun-18 12:53 PM] pondsea#0000
It would help onboard people who would otherwise not use the DEX because it is too complicated for them.

[05-Jun-18 12:54 PM] pondsea#0000
Going forward we are looking to add in agama functionality, write our own mm implementation and drive liquidity through it.

Somone is trying to buy equaliser on barterdex without luck and this is what they said: "Everytime I put up an offer it shows up as 0 UTXOs. (though I have a single 100 KMD UTXO) what is the UTXO size?"

[06-Jun-18 07:56 AM] cris20#0000
Hi <@U02PH4RHZ>, 
I used BarterDEX and the command line now.  
HyperDEX certainly looks better and simpler.

What's the procedure for stuck swaps in hyperdex. I have for swaps stuck at various spots ... 1/5, 2/5, etc.  Been that way for 12 hours now.  Hyperdex was hung so I shut down while swaps were pending.

[07-Jun-18 02:54 PM] allbits#0000
Thanks

Can i get my hyperdex seed from within the app?

[07-Jun-18 05:07 PM] daxirre#0000
The hyperdex will generate a 12 word seed when you creat your portfolio

[07-Jun-18 05:07 PM] daxirre#0000
you can also use your barterdex seed if you have it already created

[07-Jun-18 06:29 PM] allbits#0000
Thanks for the response, but I was asking a different question - can I get my hyperdex from within the app after I have signed on?

[07-Jun-18 06:29 PM] allbits#0000
I know one got generated when I created the portfolio but that's not what I'm asking

[07-Jun-18 06:53 PM] daxirre#0000
the seed is encrypted locally , you can ask the hyperdex team in the feedback option to include  a feature to decrypt the passphrase on the dapp

[07-Jun-18 08:18 PM] allbits#0000
thank you

[08-Jun-18 05:37 PM] modus#0000
can we use hyperdex to purchase oot or eql?

[08-Jun-18 05:37 PM] modus#0000
or stick with bdex

<@U02PH4RHZ> around 10m20 he’s talking about dex’s and that he was dabbling around with them but most of them only supported btc or whatever

i'm having trouble getting a sell order to stay in the books, not sure what i am doing wrong. comes back UNMATCHED each time.

[14-Jun-18 03:59 AM] Mylo#8306
@Cloudy hyperdex is the "taker" in a trade.  you need to find a "maker".   So someone on the buy side that is a market "maker" who has their order ready to be matched is the only way you can use hyperdex to sell at this stage. 
if you want to be a market "maker" this will come later i think through the hyperdex line of products.  currently "maker" is a command line or BarterDEX function only.

[14-Jun-18 03:16 PM] Cloudy#1215
@Mylo thanks for the clarification. i had been trying to use hyperdex after failing to make the same trade on barterdex however

[14-Jun-18 07:08 PM] Jonathan#3687
Question - was it by design to log out of the portfolio after you delete swap history?

[15-Jun-18 03:37 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Completely offtopic and having nothing todo with your question. But why delete your swap history @Jonathan It is stored locally not on  any server of any type. This is a key aspect of something being distributed and decentralized.

vrcninja you need to delete the .finished files (after backup), then restart HyperDEX.
