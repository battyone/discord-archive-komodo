So should I stop using barterdex and use hyperdex?

[24-Jun-18 07:29 PM] AkiraX#8269
I think alot of coins aren't supported yet with hyperdex

- Merged #CoinsDB feature to @BarterDex dev branch. After this user's will get updated coins database directly from Github coinsdb.
- Added UI for "Fill" & "Good Till Cancel" feature. This feature added to API earlier today. Much better odds of order-matching now. @KomodoP...

With #CoinsDB feature users will always be able to get latest @BarterDex supported coins list right in their desktop app. No need to download new release just for getting new coins. Also you control which fav coins you want to have in your list; makes your app a lot faster.

Any new coin add request now ONLY has to go to this repository: https://t.co/hPKpIizkff
Take example from existing coins list and **make sure to have your submissions in proper format**.
#CoinsDB feature was big update to app, so it's version series updated to v1.1.x

New method of "Fill" and "Good Till Cancel" (GTC) now gives much better chances to buyers to fill their orders, as the seller's UTXOs gets adjusted as per the big UTXO order requests sent to the sellers. Don't feel confused. Just give trades a try. It's been amazing in my ...

Hi, I wondered if fiat would be added to hyperdex?

[25-Jun-18 07:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, ask your central bank to issue the official tokens, please. Then they'll be added.

[25-Jun-18 07:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Haha 😂 how does waves have fiat or doesn't it?

[25-Jun-18 07:18 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Waves has a registered company, license and all... they can operate a fiat gateway

[25-Jun-18 07:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
all that laws, regulations, and govts up in your business stuff 😣

[25-Jun-18 07:21 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
TrueUsd and Tether are supported in Bdex, so not much different but for buying/redeeming you must move them to Bitfinex or Bittrex

[25-Jun-18 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
So if waves does atomic swaps it could be a problem for this?

[25-Jun-18 07:27 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think the waves atomic swaps refer to swaps on its own blockchain, for OTC trading and the like.  Nxt Asset Exchange did them, not cross-chain like Bdex tech

[25-Jun-18 07:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
OK so waves is centralised is that what your saying?

[25-Jun-18 07:53 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I don't mean it's centralized... using it, trading and creating tokens is permissionless but they also have a registered company for interacting with regulations. Anyway it's foremost an asset exchange platform, very different scope from say Bitcoin or a true cryptocurrency... so this hybrid approach makes sense.

[25-Jun-18 07:53 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

What about creating a blockchain on komodo do you pay with kmd?

[25-Jun-18 08:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
you pay nothing for an assetchain, unless you want to

[25-Jun-18 08:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
no, but you pay for dPoW, a reasonable fee, in KMD

[25-Jun-18 08:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
And that is security of your chain right?

no, there is no cost associated with creating a chain unless you want to do dPoW

Can I pay 1 kmd and make 100000 shitcoin?

[25-Jun-18 08:35 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
no, kmd doesn't support colored coins (yet, maybe in future)

[25-Jun-18 08:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
OK cool, I have been happily consumed by komodo and learning about it all day. It's literally the best project as far as I can tell

[25-Jun-18 08:38 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
if for a case needs a colored coin rather than an independent blockchain, then it should use another platform

[25-Jun-18 08:38 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
But this is a deliberate design decision because with kmd you're not tied to the underlying platform, free to move away, no congestion from other projects and use only the parts you need

[25-Jun-18 08:38 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
colored coins are easier to setup but then you're forever an hostage

But it's Ethereum specific.

[25-Jun-18 08:40 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes for a specific use case

[25-Jun-18 08:40 PM] mv#8810
I have a question about atomic cross-chain swaps.  What happens if the block on which one leg of the transaction was logged, is later orphaned?  Does the "atomic" nature of the swap force the other leg, on a different blockchain, to also  become invalid?

[25-Jun-18 08:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
@mv if there are disagreements there are refunds.

[25-Jun-18 08:41 PM] dan.#2473

[25-Jun-18 08:43 PM] mv#8810
The Komodo whitepaper points out that there is no point at which a logged transaction is immune to being orphaned.  So waiting for 100 confirmations before releasing deposits makes it likely, but not certain, that the transaction will not be orphaned

[25-Jun-18 08:45 PM] dan.#2473
ive been out of the loop for some time, but, in the case of assetchains being swapped, they're at 3-6 confs for each part of the swap protocol.  As that gives time for a few notarizations to occur

[25-Jun-18 08:45 PM] dan.#2473
james is typing he will answer

[25-Jun-18 08:45 PM] dan.#2473
lol

[25-Jun-18 08:45 PM] mv#8810
okay

[25-Jun-18 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is just a normal orphan, then . it will just go into the mempool and get confirmed in the next block

[25-Jun-18 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you are swapping with a 51% attacker who is reorging the chain just to double spend on you, then the orhpaned tx wont be valid anymore. so for large amounts, use more confirms. for assetchains it is set to 3 so usually there is a notarization to protect it

[25-Jun-18 08:54 PM] mv#8810
Yes, notarized chains are relatively protected.  For other chains, the Bobs accepting coins are dependent on the security of those chains, and  are only protected by the confirmations.  What mechanism returns orphaned atomic swap legs to the mempool?  Is that automatic by the underlying protocol, automatic within the Barterdex / Hyperdex protocol, or manual, because the swap failed and the swappers manually retry it?

[25-Jun-18 08:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the underlying protocol

[25-Jun-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
automatically by bitcoin code

[25-Jun-18 09:03 PM] mv#8810
Okay.  I'm thinking of cases like the timewarp attacks on Verge last month... it orphaned many of the Verge blocks, and the newly mined blocks had no transactions in them.  I suppose once the attack ends, the accepted blocks have not removed the transaction from the mempool, so it would finally get processed and later confirmed.

[25-Jun-18 09:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Verge is not a good comparison...

Heh... we are talking about atomic swaps, and what vulnerabilities remain when using atomic swaps with relatively insecure blockchains.
