[10-Aug-18 01:25 PM] lukechilds#2707
did you run it again without the error?

[10-Aug-18 01:26 PM] lukechilds#2707
or it finished ok despite the errors?

[10-Aug-18 01:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Just let it do it's thing and now I am at the login screen of electron app

[10-Aug-18 01:26 PM] lukechilds#2707
ok

[10-Aug-18 01:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
finished installing despite errors

[10-Aug-18 01:26 PM] lukechilds#2707
you can ignore all the Electron errors

[10-Aug-18 01:26 PM] lukechilds#2707
it just spams the terminal with loads of useless stuff

[10-Aug-18 01:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
roger

[10-Aug-18 01:26 PM] lukechilds#2707
can you try logging in with this build

[10-Aug-18 01:26 PM] lukechilds#2707
and see if you have the same order book issue

[10-Aug-18 01:27 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you do, we will try dropping in the BarterDEX GUI mm binary and re-launch

[10-Aug-18 01:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I see a lot of console output now aswell

[10-Aug-18 01:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
some errors in there

[10-Aug-18 01:27 PM] lukechilds#2707
if they are electron errors you can ignore them

[10-Aug-18 01:28 PM] lukechilds#2707
let it sit on the order book view for a few mins

dafuq

[10-Aug-18 01:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
these are not my adresses though

[10-Aug-18 01:29 PM] lukechilds#2707
no, those are the addresses of the bobs

[10-Aug-18 01:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
adress of seller probably

[10-Aug-18 01:29 PM] lukechilds#2707
so you're seeing stuff in the order book right?

[10-Aug-18 01:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah now showing up in gui as well

[10-Aug-18 01:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
only one kmd sell order for now, but it's more than before :p

[10-Aug-18 01:30 PM] lukechilds#2707
that's very strange, we literally haven't made any commits since the v0.1.0-alpha.12 release, so this build should be identical

[10-Aug-18 01:30 PM] lukechilds#2707
can you try closing that

[10-Aug-18 01:30 PM] lukechilds#2707
nuking the downloaded .app

[10-Aug-18 01:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
3 bid/asks

[10-Aug-18 01:30 PM] lukechilds#2707
and redownloading the v0.1.0-alpha.12 release

[10-Aug-18 01:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
kill process or normal close?

[10-Aug-18 01:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
you will probably have to do both in dev mode

[10-Aug-18 01:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
or jsut CTRL+c in the terminal

[10-Aug-18 01:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
and it will kill everything

[10-Aug-18 01:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ok so just redownload from github fresh?

[10-Aug-18 01:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
delete some folders first?

[10-Aug-18 01:35 PM] lukechilds#2707
infact you don't even need to delete anything

[10-Aug-18 01:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
you will overwrite the old .app

[10-Aug-18 01:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you download the dmg and install via that

[10-Aug-18 01:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I have one peer?

[10-Aug-18 01:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
no order book though

[10-Aug-18 01:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the peer could be the cmc peer?

[10-Aug-18 01:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
no that's marketmaker peers

[10-Aug-18 01:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
so you definitely have a peer now which you didn't before

[10-Aug-18 01:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
because it says one peer, but I dont see anything in the orderbooks

[10-Aug-18 01:51 PM] lukechilds#2707
hmmn

[10-Aug-18 01:51 PM] lukechilds#2707
can you run the getpeers command again

[10-Aug-18 01:51 PM] lukechilds#2707
have HyperDEX running?

[10-Aug-18 01:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yes

[10-Aug-18 01:51 PM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, see if you have any more peers

[10-Aug-18 01:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
_api.debug({method: 'getpeers'}).then(p => console.log('peers:', p.length))

[10-Aug-18 01:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
just left it running

[10-Aug-18 01:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it's the peer's ip addr I presume?

[10-Aug-18 01:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
yep

[10-Aug-18 01:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
one peer is not a lot

[10-Aug-18 01:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But in network I dont see any orderbooks

[10-Aug-18 01:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
it normally takes 3+ to get a decent view of the order book

[10-Aug-18 01:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
3+ peers

[10-Aug-18 01:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So why is it connecting to that peer if it doesnt have an orderbook?

[10-Aug-18 01:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
peers and order books are unrelated

[10-Aug-18 01:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah k

[10-Aug-18 01:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
it will try to connect to peers and join the network

[10-Aug-18 01:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
peers will relay order books to eachother

[10-Aug-18 01:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
I believe

[10-Aug-18 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
orderbooks dont actually exist

[10-Aug-18 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
what exists are pubkeys and prices

[10-Aug-18 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
locally this is used to construct an orderbook

[10-Aug-18 01:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
relay orders* I should have said

[10-Aug-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
but it really has nothing to do with anything other than what is displayed locally

[10-Aug-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
as in, you can do a swap without ever having created an orderbook

[10-Aug-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a network

[10-Aug-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
you submit a request to

[10-Aug-18 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if a bob sees it and it is a swap he is configured to do, he will respond back

[10-Aug-18 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
these initial responses include the specific txids being swapped

[10-Aug-18 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
so there is no need to get a compleete list of utxo of all nodes propagated to all other nodes (bad idea to do that)

[10-Aug-18 01:57 PM] lukechilds#2707
so if you have 1 peer

[10-Aug-18 01:57 PM] lukechilds#2707
should you have a good chance of getting matched?

[10-Aug-18 01:58 PM] lukechilds#2707
@Cryptoon Can you try going on CHIPS/KMD and placing a buy order with a price of 0.09 for a total of 0.01 KMD?

[10-Aug-18 01:58 PM] lukechilds#2707
see if you can get a match

[10-Aug-18 01:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
will transfer some kmd into that wallet one moment

[10-Aug-18 02:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
make sure you do 2 transfers so you have enough UTXOs

[10-Aug-18 02:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I dont see an orderbook for chips/kmd though?

[10-Aug-18 02:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
buy one chips for a price of 0.01 I presume

[10-Aug-18 02:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
When I click buy chips the button greys out and nothing happens

[10-Aug-18 02:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
restarting hyper

[10-Aug-18 02:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
restarted

placing an order just greys out the buy chips button and nothing happens

[10-Aug-18 02:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
sounds like mm is hanging

[10-Aug-18 02:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you view the network tab can you see requests going through?

[10-Aug-18 02:19 PM] lukechilds#2707
or does it just say pending?

[10-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I rebooted mm

[10-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it was showing stuff in network

[10-Aug-18 02:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But as it has been from the first release untill now, after 15 minutes I get the feeling my marketmaker dies
