no SHA256SUMS for v0.1.0-a10?

[17-Jul-18 07:47 PM] sindresorhus#8187
@zatJUM Added now. I had some problems with GPG earlier.

@sindresorhus Public key different this time again?

[17-Jul-18 09:28 PM] sindresorhus#8187
@zatJUM Yes, we haven't set up a public key for HyperDEX yet, so we're using our own. @lukechilds will do that soon. You can confirm my key with Keybase: https://keybase.io/sindresorhus

[17-Jul-18 09:33 PM] sindresorhus#8187
@Hermes That's weird. Seems the `getendpoint` call we do to marketmaker succeeds but does not always return an URL as we expected. @lukechilds Seems we need to add some handling here https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/blob/93beff8026ef113b86487d3b8d9470dfa399c06c/app/renderer/api.js#L49 Or find a way to reproduce it and open an issue on marketmaker.

@Hermes Just to confirm, you have not set a "Custom Marketmaker URL" in the Settings, right? Can you reproduce the issue or did you only get it once?

[17-Jul-18 09:37 PM] Hermes#6934
let me see if I can reproduce it

[17-Jul-18 09:40 PM] Hermes#6934

with multiple instances, yes

[17-Jul-18 10:35 PM] Hermes#6934
Still haven't been able to reproduce the errors guys will keep you updated when I see it again

[18-Jul-18 03:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@siu - Chainmakers we have a designer on the books now to go through the backlog. Your logo is the first one to be done. Please keep in mind that we have taken over the repo and we are paying designers to actually standardize the icons, it is another overhead but we will get it done.

[18-Jul-18 07:34 AM] jansako#3330
I have a bob node that has been up for a bit (~24 hours), there are active orders on it.  How do I make that bob to show up in HyperDEX? One cannot make a trade if custoemrs can't find him... I understand it is a matter of connections and who can see who. So how do I make myself seen? (If this is something that can be done, I can see a 'premium bob' service offering in the future...)

[18-Jul-18 08:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Special bobs for everyone @jansako

[18-Jul-18 08:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We dont do anything special, so if it is not showing up in hyper, it probably is not showing up on barterDEX. Maybe speak to @siu - Chainmakers or @cipi they are masters in the craft

[18-Jul-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Check your marketmakers mem use, and try restarting it. Sometimes orderbooks just stop working, and other times orderooks show but trades dont respond. I also advise using the release atrem posted yesterday instead of the marketmaker in jl's SuperNET repo.

[18-Jul-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seemed to help the bob I am looking after.

[18-Jul-18 09:26 AM] jansako#3330
Taking this to #dev-marketmaker . thx!

[18-Jul-18 12:07 PM] lukechilds#2707
@jansako in HyperDEX we strip out orders with 0 UTXOs from the order book

[18-Jul-18 12:07 PM] lukechilds#2707
but it's unlikely that's the issue if your Bob is funded

[18-Jul-18 12:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
you can manually inspect the requests in the network tab of dev tools to view the raw order book response

[18-Jul-18 12:33 PM] jansako#3330
It was not showing in HyperDEX or Dexstats orderbooks, so not your issue. Restarted MM and the orders do. I just need to keep an eye out for when they drop off & restart the bob again...

[18-Jul-18 12:33 PM] jansako#3330

@sindresorhus

[19-Jul-18 09:15 AM] sindresorhus#8187
@Cryptoon What currency? Did you try to send your whole balance or just part of it? After clicking "Withdraw", did you click the "Confirm Network Fee" button? Are you able to click the `X` (or Esc) to close the modal dialog?

[19-Jul-18 09:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
It was KMD, was manually trying to send entire balance to self

[19-Jul-18 09:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
will try again in a bit to see the steps again, will get back to you

Roger!

[19-Jul-18 09:53 AM] jorian#4555
that can actually be done: when you do the withdraw script, you can define the `txfee`. if you make that max button subtract the txfee from it, the withdraw works. standard txfee is 10,000, but i've used lower ones in my withdraw script perfectly fine

[19-Jul-18 09:53 AM] jorian#4555
and since you work with SPV only, no weird issues with native can rise, like stuck cache or sth.

[19-Jul-18 09:58 AM] jorian#4555
```{
    "method": "withdraw",
    "coin": "KMD",
    "txfee":5000,
    "outputs": [
        {
            "Raddress": <MAX> - 5000 sats
        }
    ]
}```

[19-Jul-18 09:59 AM] jorian#4555
it's a shame the api docs don't mention this

shall i comment that on the issue?

[19-Jul-18 09:59 AM] jorian#4555
still, API error response could be more specific indeed

[19-Jul-18 10:03 AM] sindresorhus#8187
@jorian Yes, that would be great.

[19-Jul-18 12:40 PM] ranfoltu#0306
I'm trying to trade some DEX and a little bit of SUPERNET on HyperDEX.  Does anybody want to trade?  I will trade under market value.  I've been trying to trade them for more than a month now on coinexchange, barterdex, and now hyperdex.  I've got multiple UTXO's, but can't ever get a trade to go through.  If you are willing to help, I would much appreciate it!!!  Thanks in advance.

[19-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
how much are you selling dex for?

[19-Jul-18 12:55 PM] jorian#4555
next chance, cryptoon ðŸ˜„

[19-Jul-18 12:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
@sindresorhus re specifying a txfee, that works fine for alts with hardcoded tx values but is totally hit and miss with currencies like BTC/LTC/ETH with agressive fee markets

[19-Jul-18 12:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
there is no single fee size that will guarantee a fast transaction

[19-Jul-18 12:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
and you need to know the size of the transaction to calculate a good fee size

[19-Jul-18 12:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
which depends entirely on the user's UTXO set

[19-Jul-18 01:02 PM] ranfoltu#0306
@Cryptoon I have 58.xxx of them 15 KMD each

[19-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm I think I'll wait for @jorian to fix his node then :p

[19-Jul-18 01:03 PM] ranfoltu#0306
What's that mean?  He's gonna sell cheaper than that?

[19-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yes

[19-Jul-18 01:12 PM] ranfoltu#0306
what price?

[19-Jul-18 01:12 PM] ranfoltu#0306
I will trade them at 14 KMD each then if that works for you..

[19-Jul-18 01:12 PM] ranfoltu#0306
Kinda desperate to move them

[19-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it was 10,11

[19-Jul-18 01:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
why desperate @ranfoltu ?

[19-Jul-18 01:59 PM] ranfoltu#0306
@Cryptoon Need some funds!  Been holding these for a while in hopes they would bring some passive income with interest, but I've become impatient.

[19-Jul-18 02:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They were 24-30kmd a couple weeks ago

[19-Jul-18 02:26 PM] ranfoltu#0306
I've had orders sitting on barterdex, always lower than the lowest sell offer, but can't get a buyer for quite a while.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  I can buy things on barterdex easy enough, but selling them is another story ðŸ˜‚

[19-Jul-18 02:27 PM] ranfoltu#0306
So now I'm trying with Hyperdex

[19-Jul-18 02:27 PM] ranfoltu#0306
Hopefully I'll have more luck

[19-Jul-18 02:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But have you been selling on barterdex or hyperdex?

[19-Jul-18 02:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Best check #dev-tradebots perhaps

[19-Jul-18 02:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
to solve problems

[19-Jul-18 02:30 PM] ranfoltu#0306
I'm trying on hyperdex now

[19-Jul-18 02:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No trades at all seems weird

[19-Jul-18 02:30 PM] ranfoltu#0306
Giving up on barterdex for now, upgrading to hyperdex

[19-Jul-18 02:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hyperdex doesnt leave orders open I think

[19-Jul-18 02:31 PM] ranfoltu#0306
Right, I understood that.. I just keep trying multiple times per day to see if any orders will go through I suppose

[19-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Were you selling for 15kmd exactly?

[19-Jul-18 02:31 PM] ranfoltu#0306
I've tried even cheaper than that

[19-Jul-18 02:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think I bought like .5 DEX at that price earlier today to test it

[19-Jul-18 02:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if the problem was on my side

[19-Jul-18 02:45 PM] jorian#4555
not many buyers in bear market

[19-Jul-18 02:45 PM] jorian#4555

[19-Jul-18 02:48 PM] ranfoltu#0306
well, offer is open if anybody wants some cheap DEX or small amount of SuperNET hit me up and we can do a trade via hyperdex if you like ðŸ˜ƒ

[20-Jul-18 12:34 AM] smellycouch#3071
So are we done with Barterdex then, To Hyperdex and beyond?

[20-Jul-18 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Berterdex will still work, if you want to trade with native wallets, you still need barterdex. Native has not been added to HyperDEX at this stage.

[20-Jul-18 03:07 AM] grim_chiefer#6001
Never used Hyperdex - when I get to choosing Restore Portfolio or Create New Portfolio - do I choose restore and enter my Agama seed or do I make a new one and it gives me a seed specific to Hyperdex? 

Sorry, Iâ€™ve used Barterdex but not Hyper

[20-Jul-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <hermes_t:matrix.org> You can use your Barterdex seed if you like if you already have a trading use with that seed you can use it

[20-Jul-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <hermes_t:matrix.org> Also you can use your Agama seed if you wish to

[20-Jul-18 05:00 AM] grim_chiefer#6001
What happens if you place an order but there isnâ€™t enough of the other token to fill?

Stuck in swap 3/5 and the order book has now gone blank.

Funds have been taken from my end but the coin I want to purchase is still 0

[20-Jul-18 08:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
During the swap the funds are locked

[20-Jul-18 08:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So the swap has to go on

[20-Jul-18 08:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
if the swap is stuk that sometimes means that bob has lost connection or something like that

[20-Jul-18 08:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
funds are returned after x hours (I think 4?)

[20-Jul-18 12:04 PM] grim_chiefer#6001
@Cryptoon k thanks. Iâ€™ll just reopen it when I get home from work and hope nothing gets stuck. Sat there for a couple hours and waited but nothing happened.

[20-Jul-18 11:04 PM] grim_chiefer#6001
Now when I try to sell itâ€™ll post and then say unmatched error 9999

[20-Jul-18 11:58 PM] Hermes#6934
which pair you are using?

[21-Jul-18 12:40 AM] grim_chiefer#6001
Trying to trade Zilla for KMD because I know they frown upon doing it in chat but Hyperdex just refuses to either complete a trade or leave a sell order open more than 10 seconds
