It is not easy because of segids: to make the chain stable we split activated coins on 64 segids. So if we usually create only one loop for test its boosted coins would be staked rarely (as most of staking would be coming on the activated coins that are split on 64 segids). 
I think we might develop some not very complicated rpc which would enumerate PoS generated coins and output some statistics on them, like if this is activated or boosted staking, which address, total amount. Then we probably could see overall staking results.
Probably we would need to create loops for some specified time (to get enough statistic data) and allow to set a period for the getting statistic for the rpc.
I think it might need at least 1000 PoS blocks generated (with boosted utxo in the chain) to see the expected results as all 64 segid utxos will be used for staking and we will need to wait for many blocks to see that the single boosted utxo have been picked for staking at least several times.";"";"👍 (3)";

I have created a new rpc ```marmaraposstat begin-height end-height``` that returns PoS statistics: stake addresses and how much coins were generated for each of them. It is also shown if an address is boosted and how many stake txns were generated for it.
-----
Also I found and fixed a bug with normal coinbase scriptpubkey generation.
------
So I suggest the following way to research boosted coins usage:
- update all nodes with the new version from my repo
- create a long credit loop (for 5000 blocks). The loop amount should be approximately equal to the amount of activated coins on each segid. Do not add any new endorsers to the loop, just wait.
- note the height where this loop was created
Now for boosted coins a stake multiplier of 100x is set in the code.
When enough blocks are passed we can run marmaraposstat  from the height where the loop was created till the chain tip and look into the stat.
If the algo works correct we would see in the marmaraposstat output that for the boosted address there are more stake tx and coins generated than for other non-boosted addresses";"";"👌 (2)";

I recommend starting a new chain to check boosted coins PoS generation.

for a new chain, to see how boosted coins generate blocks, make sure that all the segids have equal utxo values, for example make them with command 'marmaralock64 640 1', this will create 64 segids with one utxo in each of 10 coins.
Then make a loop also for 10 coins and for 5000 blocks till it matures.
Then you might periodically call `marmaraposstat 0 0` to see what address generated most of the blocks.
You may find the lock-in-loop address in marmaraposstat output with 'IsBoosted: true' tag.

(Note that I temporarily disable activated coinbases generation for even block for they do not contaminate PoS staking)";"";"👌 (3)";
