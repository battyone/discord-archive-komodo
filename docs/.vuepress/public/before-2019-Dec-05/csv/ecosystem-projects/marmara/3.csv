on steps 1,2,3  pk1  locks 600 coins and receives goods for 600 coins form pk2
on steps 4,5,6 pk2 locks 300 coins and pk1 receives normal 300 coins from his locked amount.
So now pk1 has 300 normal coins and 300 coins locked and he has goods for 600 coins 
At the end of the table pk1 has already 450 normal coins and he has only 150 coins locked and then settled to the debt (and he still has goods for 600 coins?).
So my impression is that pk1 received goods for 600 coins and payed only 150 coins.

Thank you once more for the explanations.
I also found this your note in the dev-chat transcript:
```At the due-date, all other nodes are responsible to the holder/last node starting from the credit creator first until the node before holder. If credit creator/issuer pays for holder, the credit is destroyed. If not paid, the non-redemption process starts. Either automatic or manual. In automatic, it is easier. The 5% blockage by credit issuer (if there is one) is transferred to holder/last node, then all timelocked coins belonging to credit issuer is used to pay for holder. If there is sufficient amount that is ok. The case is settled. Otherwise, all nodes in credit loop are visited one by one in sequence, and their timelocked coins are used to pay for holder. ```
From this I assume we need 2 rpcs:
1) marmara_settlement which tries to settle the baton with only issuer's funds: blockage + all timelocking funds are used to pay for holder
2) marmara_nonredemption which is executed if the first rpc was unsuccessful or partially successful. It visits all nodes and writes off their timelocked funds in equal fractions to pay to holder the remainder";"";"";

I'd say coins are simply locked on randomized height in 3 month...2 year interval. No correlation with issued amount.
And during the settlement it just draws coins from the lock 1of2 address.
So we need a special account for coins locked in a loop?";"";"üëå (1)";
