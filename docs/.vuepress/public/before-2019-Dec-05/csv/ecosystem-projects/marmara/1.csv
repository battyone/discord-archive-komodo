Bu konuda uygulayıcı kuruluşlardan TEB'deki arkadaşların katkıları oldu. Kendilerine çok teşekkür ediyoruz. 9 projemiz başvurulabilir durumdaydı. Ancak insan kaynakları sıkıntısı nedeniyle sadece 5 proje için Başvuru yapıldı. Bunlar aşağıdadır;
1. ChainHub (Koin Kafe)
2. Güneş Evi Zinciri
3. FarmChain
4. SmartGrid için Enerji Üretimine dayalı Madencilik 
5. Portatif 3D yazıcı

İlgili projelerden ilk dört tanesi blokzinciri bağlantılıdır. Beşincisi için ise sonraki aşamada Blokzinciri kullanılacaktır. Bunlarda Komodo Teknolojileri kullanılacaktır. Projelere katılmak isteyenler Sanal Oba grubuna katılabilirler. Çalışabilecek arkadaşlarınızı da davet edebilirsiniz.

We are building community for #marmara Chain now where we will have chains of post-dated cheques pegged to any currency, which will allow people to create their own money based on credit/debt in their selected currency. Thanks very much to @jl777c as being advisor to us in Discord group. These cheques have more than 200 billion USD market value now in Turkey alone. It is great value when especially considering not only the neighbouring countries but also any other country where post-dated cheques are/may be used in a chain structure. We will decide which technologies to continue with soon within our community. I am personally trying to promote Komodo technologies within our community to base the project on CC by Komodo. And I personally like the #verus mining algorithm which allows people to mine with CPUs. I believe this will help creating a huge community with the mineable coin on Marmara chain. We are currently working on defining the procedures for having a complete decentralization of whole processes which are currently held by banking and insurance institutions according to central laws. I invite all interested community members of Komodo into the Discord group to realize this project together.

Gültekin Çetiner#0626";"02-Oct-18 05:37 AM";"@polycryptoblog this is money creation based on credit/debt without interest/usury in a decentralized way when originally invented. But they end up with banks now. The only thing to do is to remove banks and other central decision making in the process. Banks involve during delivery of cheque books and when paying on due date. It is perhaps the most common instrument in Turkey and neighbouring countries. It enables ordinary people creating their own money based on credit/debt. It works same as banking with the exception of many circulation and no interest/usury fixed to it. When you get a loan from bank, it creates money out of thin air. And that money is destroyed when it is paid back. But since nobody creates the interest the borrower becomes slave to bank with compound interest rate. The bank created money only circulates between bank and borrower. Actually government bonds are same. They borrow money from banks and make us pay (modern slavery).";"";"";

It could well be the largest economic value that is transferred to the blockchain and it happens to require CC to be properly implemented. Also assets CC does the vast majority of the post dated check linked list handling simply via tokencreate and tokentransfer. It is possible to make it so is a tree instead of a linked list, so the entire balance wont need to be signed to the next person. basically utxos and this is already built in. so it would be an improvement over the paper version as there is no practical way to do partials on paper checks";"";"👏 (8),👍 (6),💯 (5),💪 (6),🖕 (1),Equaliser (1),1M (2),Komodo (6)";

"396753788150611968";"B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626";"02-Oct-18 07:34 PM";"I think it works like this: it always happens between two persons who know each other. There is always trust. It is not completely anonymous. It happens during business where buyer and receiver knows each other very well. Suppose @jl777c writes a cheque for me to pay on say 1.1.2019. I know that @jl777c will keep money on his account on specified date not to put me into the trouble. @jl777c also knows that I may be the last person in the link and if no money exists in the account I will be in trouble. Of course, he will not feel well, either if I am the last one in the link. He will always assume that I may be the last one. Therefore,  @jl777c will not probably do something to harm me. Now suppose I have the cheque. I will be able to give this only to one who will have trust on me. He knows me not @jl777c. So trust has been transferred to me. We should remember that these cheques are used in real economy to buy and sell things among always two persons. They do not simply go from one location to another. Even if it goes, it always happens between two persons who trust each other. I think this is one of the main reasons why they work well.";"";"";

We discussed important design criteria  that we decided based on invaluable discussions with @jl777c. I am very happy to announce that we have a consensus in our community to go with Komodo technologies. This decision is very important since we can find Ethereum developers more easily in Turkey. But we believe that the highly challenging problem of individual money creation by people based on credit/debt in completely decentralized manner could only be solved with Komodo technologies in the easiest way. We are planning to write a paper why we have chosen Komodo. The problem is not only having a blockchain version of analog trust chain of post-dated cheques and promissory notes any more. It is very clear to us that we can easily offer together to World a decentralized self-assured way of creating fiat money based on credit/debt in a trustful network. We have already a use-case with 200 billion usd market only with post-dated cheques. We want to expand it to general money creation based on debt as a complete alternative to banking system which creates fiat money based on credit/debt. Our difference is that we will have no slavery with the interest applied in banking credits as well as circulation of credits among many people while bank credit happens only between bank and borrower. We invited officially @jl777c to be advisor to project and we are honoured that he kindly accepted invitation. We invite all good developers and frontiers of Komodo community to our founding team to make this possible.

Many of academics do not carry cash. We just say ""please write it"". Then when we have cash with us we just go and pay then the records are deleted. It was practiced in all small shops until recently. We called them ""veresiye notebooks"". It is a kind of small credit creation. As @jl777c rightly addressed with very simple GUI tools for mass adoption, we could use culture here very well and I am sure it is very similar in cultures such as India, Pakistan, Gulf and Balkans. Trust is essential within the culture of those areas.";"";"👏 (1)";

Marmara is actually based on trust between people. Therefore, we have virtually no need for privacy. Actually even privacy is a problem since nobody would accept a post-dated cheque if the original issuer is unknown. I checked the defaulting rates in Turkey. It is worse in greater cities but in small cities the defaulting rate is almost negligible. Since it is based on credibility/trust, and the reputation/credibility is all lost on default the people in small communities tend to pay it without delays/problems.";"";"";
