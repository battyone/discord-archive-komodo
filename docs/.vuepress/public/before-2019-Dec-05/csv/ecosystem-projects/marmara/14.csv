But as far as I understand it might solve a common problem that are happenning with post-dated cheques use. I think @jl777c will give idea since he knows very well how post-dated cheques work in Turkey. 

The problem is this. Suppose you have a post-dated cheque from someone with a long redemption date say 1.1.2021. I am holder of cheque now. I cannot wait until that date and I cannot sell it for goods. Can I exchange it for KMD, VRSC, BTC etc? What happens at the moment in Turkey? The person goes to a bank and sells it for cheaper price. Actually bank becomes holder. They call it breaking a cheque. But in reality, the cheque, i.e. the credit loop is not broken. A bank becomes holder, i.e. waits until the redemption date. It is simply using another asset/coin instead of GOODS. Can we do that with pegs and gateways? @Paro may share the case as a picture since I cannot upload the picture.";"";"";

in this way, ""Post-dated Cheques"" will be passed to a new endorser.
In order to get the check, the person needs to have a KMD coin.
