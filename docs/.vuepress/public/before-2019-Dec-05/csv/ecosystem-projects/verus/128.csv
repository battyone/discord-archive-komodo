That means they are supporting the community effort to move to FPGAs without secret mining or the centralization that comes with it. We can expect clone boards at some point, and people will be able to use their open bitstream over time. Exactly when they publish their source with confirmation is still open. I believe that as long as they are confirmed, the community should support them as much as is reasonable, as the open approach they have decided on is somewhat unheard of in other projects. While we may and likely will tweak the algorithm in a future PBaaS update if more equalization is needed, we do not intend to move to an algo that blocks FPGAs at this time, and I don‚Äôt see a reason to do so.";"";"";

3. Is there a possibility that versus 2.0 makes their algorithm ""FPGA incompatible"" in future?
4. Are the community onboard with this FPGA miner? I mean do the think its ok?
5. Is there a ""firmware"" in the device that can be upgraded in future, if there are bug and so on?
