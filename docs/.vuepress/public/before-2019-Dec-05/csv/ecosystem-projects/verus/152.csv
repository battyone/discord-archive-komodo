So it's on the explorer, so it's just not only your wallet messing up.
You haven't sent the transaction yourself, which indicates that someone else has access to your address and/or wallet.
And seeing how it's sent to a private address there is no way of tracing it, but even if it was possible there's not much to do about it.";"";"";

So unless you've forgotten about sending it to a service handling private z-addresses (like CryptoBridge) then they're most likely transferred by someone other than you to their own address.
Has anyone had access to your computer handling the wallet? Backups of the wallet.dat? WIF keys?

But it's probably better not to buy a cheap/used machine if you aren't sure how to take care of. You wouldn't buy a used and probably modded car if you wouldn't know more or less exactly that it's ok and compliant to regulations... could also cost you a lot on top.";"";"";
