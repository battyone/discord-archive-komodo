My hipotesis is that people are not used to download trading software on their PC and that they want to have the flexibility that web applications give them, but are really ok with downloading apps on their phones or needing them for access their trading web plataforms (2FA). As it seems, Q1/Q2 2019 seems to be the start of this trend, but maybe paying for listing has a short term benefit. Anyway, I belive the bullet points to discuss on the listing matter are:
1. When DEX model will gain traction?
2. How long the foundation can wait before starting selling their VRSC funds? 
3. How much money will be needed each month?
4. What is the expected impact in volume and price after the listing on the candidates exchanges?
5. How much will the listing cost on each exchange?
6. Is there any alternative for increasing the value and volume? 
7. Is there any alternative for listing instead of paying?";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"15-Aug-18 12:04 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> About the exchange  - I would think targeting one major exchange is the way to go, but I too do not know the costs. If we end up spread out over lots of little ones it will hinder price discovery as I think the Verus market would be too spread out and illiquid, and it would be an inefficient use of time/resources to get them set up.

Unless people really want to buy Verus, it's unlikely they will go and sign up to yet another (relatively unproven/untested/unknown) exchange when most traders already have to manage accounts for multiple exchanges already. People in general favour the easy route most of the time, especially nowadays with everything already done/predicted/saved for you online. I think being on digiprice is fine for now as we are so small and anyone who wants in will sign up. The same goes for many others IMO - you might get some of the existing userbase to take a look on different exchanges but to really get market participation you need to be where the market is, not expect it to come to you. Generally the market is still on bigger centralised exchanges. I wish it wasn't but...

I know nothing about how to get listed on an exchange but can't we aim for Binanance or similar? They list loads of coins. Binance CEO recently tipped Komodo as one to watch, I read in Komodo's 5 bullet Friday recently üòâ";"";"";
