I have like 20 VRSC and been staking for like 2 weeks. What am i really doing? what is the reward and how big is the chance to get reward and does that chance increase wit the amount of coins that you are staking with? Say a worst case senario, i Have 100 VRSC been staking for three months, can it be that you don't get anything, is this just by chance?";"";"";

A community member created this helpful tool, you just need to find the current block height from the explorer and enter it along with your staking amount-

Firstly, I would like to say that with open FPGA bounties and development with the community I believe that if there was secret FPGA mining it would be less significant than the previous sniping. Secondly, we can now have full confidence in mike's ability to manage and code a fork if necessary. Thirdly, as the project moves along and more are interested in buying, this would actually create so opportunities to buy before the PBaaS. So, with all these differences in mind, I will not be dumping my VRSC and you can be rest assured that VRSC has the Gloryman seal of approval. üëç";"";"";

I would have to confirm with @pbca26 that the Komodo version of Agama now supports VerusCoin. If not, the two wallets can at least run side by side, and the Verus enhanced Agama also supports Komodo coins. Until I know that the Komodo release supports the Verus daemon, which I wasn't aware of yet, we recommend the latest Verus Coin version to run VerusCoin. I will look further into this today. Thanks.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"15-Feb-19 09:47 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> About the UKminer FPGA,  just checked the details and performance.  I think the mathematics used in some upper posts are way missleading and don't show the whole larger big picture of what will happen. While i agree that the MH/s per $ calculation is mostly correct and that's on factor there are way more important ones. The MH/s factor is only interesting for initial hardware distribution or fairness, nothing more, nothing less. After that the most imporant factor becomes the MHs per Watt factor which is absolute in favour of the FPGA's with over x 3.25. Or in other words, the FGPS is 3.25 times more competive. Than we come to the difficutly factor. As the FPGA has a really high hashrate compared to the average CPU hashrate. For example mine. I'am mining with my I7-8700k which is still one of the better CPU's all the time while working with around 6-7 MH/s. Means the FPGA will mine at least 10x more than the average joe user is mining right now, mostly even 15-20x more. This is especially of interest when we consider now the without doubt raising difficulty the FPGAs will cause. Higher difficutly => less mining rewards for the CPU's => less profitability for CPU's which anyway are in many regions allready borderline due electricity prices => forcing out CPU miners. Just logical.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"15-Feb-19 09:49 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> I hace done a lot of research the last months on various projects and how given approaches lead to mining centralization. Many devs forget that the electricity price per kw/h is the most important one. The higher hashrate hardware you have on the network the more crucial it gets favouring geographical centralization,  beside hardware centraliazation of course. As an example. A german miner for example has to pay around 35 cents per kw/h compared to mining facilities in the inner mongolia region in China for example which have access to 2 cent per kw/h electricity.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"15-Feb-19 09:53 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> This is important to know when we talk about FPGA's or Asics in general. With high hashrate specialized hardware and i personally consider an FPGA a highhashrate unit small hobby miners get forced out automaticlly for 3 reasons: 1.) Limited access to the hardware. 2.) Limited technical knowledge on how to run specialized hardware. 3.) electricity prices.";"";"";
