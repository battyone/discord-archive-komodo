We are most concerned about the long term success of the project, and the real purpose of the hash algorithm, 50/50 model is maximum decentralization. If we can achieve that AND have FPGA support, we are basically protected from an arms race until ASICs, which would require significant market cap to justify the investment.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"04-Dec-18 04:35 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> our original goal was to use maximum CPU advantage to have a chance of resisting GPUs when they come. we did, and with @Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops joining the community as an incredibly helpful GPU dev who also helped on the CPU side, I'd say we achieved it. at the same time, we did not have a hardware design, and now that we do, we see there are some things we may be able to modify to help equalize FPGA, CPU, and GPU as well. If we can get cooperation from FPGA providers, the most serious miners can invest and make professional returns while still making it reasonable to continue mining on CPUs and GPUs. Most importantly for the long term success is decentralization and continued progress towards the vision, which is what we are working on and would like to stay focused on vs. a hardware arms race. Please look at our vision paper and white paper, we always talked about a holistic approach to ASICs, that includes the hash algo being CPU optimized and 50% POS to prevent the security issues. People kept saying that meant ASIC resistant, but we never claimed it was truly resistant, and we always said in interviews there is no such thing as a truly resistant algo. There really isn't. Our goal now is more equalization.";"";"";
