When they increase the stake they have a higher chance to get a block reward. In the end are miners dumping the price for the stakerholders. 

At some point there will be a turn. It’s harder for miners to sell for a lower price because the cost are increasing. So the price is increasing. Imho staking is the best option.";"";"";
