"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"28-Jul-18 05:47 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We have someone who can program FPGAs, and when @OhGodAPet was talking about his FPGA, we looked into it and concluded that we couldn't make an FPGA program for the community that would provide good perf at any reasonable price. The challenge is that the CPU instructions we leverage are extremely integrated and effectively like ASICs in the CPU, and the only way to make up for that is extreme parallelism, which starts to get quite expensive. We can certainly revisit the question anytime, and if anyone believes there's an FPGA that poses a threat to CPU mining, we'd be happy to look into it and make something competitive available. Right now, it doesn't seem like a worthwhile option.
Regarding GPUs, there is a dev who has been working on that and doing his best to optimize it. They are seeing between 120 and 140 MH/s on the hash algorithm on a 1080ti. Since the CPU is so fast, there's also the issue of simply moving memory to and from the CPU, which has fixed overhead that is actually substantial. That makes using a riser drop the performance immediately into the 20 - 30 MH/s range. While I haven't looked into the code myself, we believe this overhead is why we haven't been able to get linear increase in GPU performance with more cards as well.";"";"";
