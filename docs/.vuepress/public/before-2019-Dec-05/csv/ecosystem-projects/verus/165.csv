OTC stands for *Over The Counter*, which basically means you trade directly with your counterpart that wants to trade with you. The risk involved in this is you have to trust your counterpart to send his coin, after you send yours and vice versa.

Escrow means you hand your funds over to a third party after you agree with your counterpart to a trade. Your trade partner does the same and as soon as the 3rd party receives the agreed funds from both trade partners, the traded funds are released to the traders (after a fee is applied), thus eliminating the risk in being scammed. If no payment is received from either trade partner, your funds will be return after a set period of time";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"12-May-19 10:25 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> In short: your funds donâ€™t sit endlessly on an exchange where your funds are potentially vulnerable, they stay in your own wallet until you make a trade, safely under your own control and youâ€™re secured by escrow once you make the trade.";"";"";

The good news is that since we are not trying to drive speculation, when people do start to understand and use PBaaS, our growth will be driven by use, and lack of significant speculation should be a positive. Iâ€™m personally working to get to that point as soon as we can together. I will take a few hours off for Motherâ€™s Day, but if all goes well today, we expect another PBaaS upgrade to the test network, and I hope weâ€™ll get a lot of people making and trying out their own blockchains this week!

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"12-May-19 04:04 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ok, let's continue here @Godballz  @Oink  .and @allwhomaybeinterested:
Getting back to ```the point on centralization is a good one that may benefit from further consideration. I'd be happy to change channels but hypothetically speaking, if every other coin did suddenly join Verus' PBaaS ecosystem would it really cause centralization? I mean sure it would centralize the work efficiently which is a good thing but that's about it. Maybe it would create a hardware preference too but as far as miner centralization and ownership, I think they'd be more decentralized. Just trying to think, what negatives could come of it?``` (found in #trading )
Well, although I think that Verus and PBaaS might cover many aspects of other blockchains, it probably can't cover *all* of them, including their special features like multi-algo approach and alike. 
And when including all into one blockchain, it would also mean to combine all algos into one, which may be considered as some kind of centralisation, and might add concerns about security aspects. 
Besides that, at least BTC blockchain would still be required when notarisation shall be kept the way it is at the moment.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"12-May-19 04:04 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Iâ€™m still letting the centralization part sink in.
Any chain that chooses to use a different algo and doesnâ€™t want to leave it behind, wonâ€™t be able to go to PBaaS, obviously. Thatâ€™s not a bad thing, because itâ€™s for specialized hardware designers more profitable to design for just 1 algo, than having to divide their attention to multiple algos. All coins as PBaaS autochains would definitely incite that development and result in massive mining centralization.
As soon as any chain has significant value, it will present possible high rewards for those that seek to compromise the chains integrity. The security needs to be perfect for that.
Right now Verus uses dPoW as redundant security, on top of the PoP. I cannot say if we actually need it or not, but it sure feels good to have it in place. Being the top of all chains would make that impossible.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"12-May-19 04:10 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> About centralization: only the Verus chain development would be somewhat centralized, not the control over the network, like with many chains now. Since Verus is a community effort, the development could be more decentralized as we grow and add developers...";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"12-May-19 04:12 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> That's right, just when having the single algo for all that chains, doors would be wide open for FPGAs and alike. Personally, I'd prefer Verus to be an application-based blockchain, not a speculation-driven one.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"12-May-19 04:13 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The entire blockchain ecosystem can be seen as a pyramid, or more accurately, a reversed tree, with lots of branches. I wouldnâ€™t know how to avoid that kind of centralization.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"12-May-19 04:22 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Sure, and as any decentralised, somewhat uncontrolled development implies a sort of natural evolution, only those best adapted to the requirements will sustain in the long run. So I think most of currently existing blockchain projects will be abandoned sooner or later, if those don't get absorbed or assimilate themselves to the more suitable ones, what I consider Verus to be one of. However, I think there will be several major branches in the future, depending on what philosophy they transport - may it be speculation, application, or something completely different nobody thought about yet. And blockchain evolution will enforce it's merciless judgement, regardless of all brilliant ideas ðŸ˜‰";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"12-May-19 04:28 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I prefer multiple chains next to each other. If some of them want to be speculative, thatâ€™ll draw away the speculation from the chains that donâ€™t want to go that route. Itâ€™ll also help securing our chain, since the other chain may be insanely more profitable to hack.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"12-May-19 06:43 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Sorry, just catching back up. Good points on multi-algo projects, I do think there will have to be diversity going forward but I do believe there will be a culling of sorts where scams and lesser projects will fall away or find protection in more established chains with uses like in Verus' PBaaS chains.
The issue  @Oink raises is one I've considered myself but the best example I can think of to explain this would be natural selection. If a project truly has value, it should survive/thrive but if it doesn't then it might not. It could create new dynamics, sure, but I do think a natural equilibrium will arise and I don't think the parent chain would ever be at risk even if there were greater interest in one of the PBaaS chains because in order to merge mine both enough to be able to dump the main, it'd cause an increase in difficulty of the parent chain, meaning more competition mining. 
It's difficult to try to predict this early anyway but it doesn't hurt to think about. The complex elements at play under the current system are impossible enough to predict right now, add to that another layer of complexity in the stand alone self-sufficient full out ecosystem Verus is bringing with it and all bets are off. In any case I think Verus is one of the most forward-thinking projects to date (embracing all hardware for one example) and are at the forefront of cutting edge crypto technology.
 I feel fortunate to be here at this stage. Verus is establishing itself as a key architect in the evolving landscape of this burgeoning crypto world.
