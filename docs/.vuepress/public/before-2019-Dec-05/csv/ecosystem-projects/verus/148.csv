The first RUN command updates the linux distro in the FROM and installs all the compilers etc - the next RUN line does all the downloading and building of the ccminer software on the linux distro specified in the FROM, then I just create a new on the linux distro in the FROM line so that you wonÂ´t have to run as root - and your basically done.
