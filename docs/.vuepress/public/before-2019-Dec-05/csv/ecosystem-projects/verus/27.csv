"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"04-Aug-18 05:34 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <John Doe> Was just noticing a non-avx cpu question from yesterday. I thought non-avx cpus were not supported by the mining wallet ? Info from main website says System requirements: 64bit CPU/OS, CPU with AES-NI and AVX instructions. I have a couple old core 2 duo laptops which I would really like to try with Verus, but I know they are SSE2 cpus which have mined other coins ( at a very low hashrate ). Does SSE2 or any non-avx cpu have the right specifications to mine Verus, or maybe in the future those could be compatible ? My AVX cpu speed increased 250 times with Verus. 300 h/s to 75 mh/s. Those sse2 cpus would probably also get a huge h/s increase. Something like 5 - 10 mh/s rather than 35 h/s.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"04-Aug-18 06:34 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <John Doe> So to activate staking...... I would need to have funds in the wallet that can be moved, and then send to z shield address if its mined. Send back to transparent address so it can be accessed ? Option 2.... send from another wallet or buy. Is that right ? Just reading the wallet guide. Also, how would the staking rewards be calculated ? Like if I had 1000 VerusCoin staking for 1 month. Is there a way of getting a rough estimate ?";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"04-Aug-18 06:35 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that is correct. staking is like mining. a statistical contest of all staking transactions trying to beat a difficulty, weighted by the size of each transaction";"";"";
