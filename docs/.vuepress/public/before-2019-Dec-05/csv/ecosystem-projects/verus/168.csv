At first thought, I likely would have sided against case sensitivity till I read what you wrote. It would be cool if some of the code savvy types had the option to create their own unique wallets to help combat that. Seems there are a lot of ins and outs and that's only what we can see now, I can only imagine the mess of wires and hoses under the hood, most users will never see, that Mike and fellow devs had to sort to get us to here.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"04-Jun-19 10:50 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thanks, and hopefully, it's not a mess of hoses and wires even under the hood ðŸ˜ƒ there are core protocols constructed from relatively simple and sound cryptographic principles and primitives, including the Merkle Mountain Range with the ability to prove any block and commit to its power that is maintained for every chain, including Verus in the PBaaS system. This is combined with enhanced crypto conditions that allow Komodo style custom consensus transactions to include more data that is part of the transaction and can carry parameters and have flexible destinations that include normal blockchain addresses or combinations of programmatic and normal addresses. All function is actually built over relatively simple and primitive protocols and rules, which essentially employ the same original principles of Nakamoto consensus, only applied across a many blockchain ecosystem.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"04-Jun-19 11:02 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Merge mining is achieved with a new, flexible block header format that can carry useful data about each of 15 chains in the same header space otherwise used for an Equihash solution. This also depends on sharing a hash algorithm, which is made easier with a hash algorithm that can be effectively mined on the most available hardware. On that note, @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining, the community's leading miner developer and developer of a VerusHash 2.0 ARM miner, just posted a pull request that @Asher is looking reviewing/testing now (as will I) and when validated. will enable ARM/RPi compilation and use of Verus nodes. Though I don't know if these are optimized yet for mining, it's exciting to think of inexpensive merge mining and staking chains run by a small Raspberry Pi farm working with faster merge mining cores to mine and notarize many simultaneous chains.";"";"";
