I also think, getting listed on CMC would be really helpful, because it's kind of the standard  dictionary and who-is-who in things of cryptos.";"";"";

When i go through coinmarketcap sites and investigate a given coin and see exchanges like livecoin, yobit, mercatox as their main exchanges i just move ahead.

This exchange went from a suspect and shaddy one to a real good one after they made about 1 year ago changes to the people in charge there. It's one of the top exchanges for newbie traders and people new to crypto due the easyness it provides. Just another thought where to begin with ......

I started right away on Binance, which I still think is one of the best, and even better now as they are starting to implement fiat.

Every project needs to start somewhere, so I think people will accept being listed on a handful of lesser known/sketchy exchanges. As @boxalex mentioned though, at some point I think it starts acting against a projects reputation if someone goes on CMC and it is carried on too many of these less reputable exchanges. 

I have pointed out previously that gate.io does not charge for listings. I am sure there are a number of others. That said-- At this point, I would think the next move or two would be aiming to be listed on an upper-level exchange. 

Eventually, DP or AAcoin will likely be listed on CMC as well. Stex already is. So that would seem to meet the CMC requirement once they are.";"";"";

One, CMC is like what the Phone Book or the Yellow Pages used to be, for a person or a business. It gives a sense of legitimacy, for people that want that type of reasurrance.
And two, I'm not sure how long it will be before the Verus Vision is completed, or the base is finished. Because Mike & the dev team, are very very good and they do work fast. So wouldn't it be better to address some of these basic things now, rather than later?";"";"";
