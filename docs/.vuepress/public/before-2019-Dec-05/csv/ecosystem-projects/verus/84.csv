Half of the reward issued is done through the proof of stake system but is that reward the same as the mining reward? 

As far as I can tell it's just about 25 tokens per mineing block but is it the same for proof of stake?

Do you have to have a certain amount in order to participate in the proof of state if so how much? what would be the expected reward? Are there different tiers or does the amount change over time?";"";"";

Perhaps I missed something. I'd delete my statement, but I think it's fair to you to leave it, so it might justify your response a bit. I just feel pretty bad when I see that we ""decided"" to change. We didn't decide to have either GPUs or secret mining FPGAs. The original algorithm stood up well to GPUs, but it was too small in size, had some things that could be optimized significantly on hardware and was simply missing enough barriers to equalize FPGAs. we've learned. I can promise that I never decided to add them, but you could argue that Chris, as a developer, decided to write the GPU miner, and we didn't change the algo for that. Chris did a great job on the GPU miner, and it didn't stop CPU mining altogether. FPGAs were a very different story, and it is time to adjust.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"12-Dec-18 06:18 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the new Algo will likely be CPU only at first, was designed to leverage every strength of CPUs, especially where they are weaknesses of hardware, and is expected to bring GPUs much closer to CPUs, as Chris doesn't think they will yet be slower. We've closed every known hole for algo-specific optimization of hardware. Short of testing on an FPGA, we are optimistic as is reasonable, and rather than take some additional steps to cut them off, which will make things worse, IMO, when they come back, we believe the new algo has a very good chance of making them a non issue and reinvigorating CPU mining. Since we don't yet have GPU or FPGA, we can only go by opinions of experts we know. On FPGA, due to the money involved, only an actual implementation optimized by someone really good will give us the final answer.";"";"";

The new algo, if it ends up being final, is significantly slower on CPUs as well because it's just doing more. We'll get more benchmarks on different CPUs before I put out numbers, as it should advantage the newest CPUs over older ones as well, which is our strategy to defend against bot-nets.";"";"";

They don't seem to be doing that for all projects, which you might expect if they were more of a scam, and they are the first exchange or pool to build automated staking support. We don't know them more than working with them here, but they seem technically capable, and based on their interest, they integrated and listed Verus for free before even asking for the 25K, which was earmarked for promotion. The trading bot was interesting. They acknowledged it, explained it, and they have turned it off in response to the Verus community. I hope they are trustworthy as they seem when communicating, and it would be great if we could have the ability to know. Lifetime 1% staking fee is a reason to at least register, IMO.";"";"";

You have every reason to be careful. I wouldn't go so far to call everything unreliable to be scam though. I'm too cautious and  wouldn't dare to take the risk in my own current situation, but my understanding is that there are gamblers out here/there that would throw themselves at these kind of things. And AACoin are great for making it available either way, just be careful to engage if that's not your thing.";"";"";

I nearly choked when I saw the aacoin announcement, 20% fee after the grace period.... lol, wtf.

At ginasis mining it's a 1%fee if you mine on our pool, or 2% of you don't. So just a casual 20x / 10x lower....

We have been doing g it long enough to get a decent rep aswell, with many members with plenty of verus in the kitty.
