This is an aspect I really dig about this project!  Together Verus exists.  

This is not to, in any way, diminish @miketout‚Äôs contributions as lead developer or visionary in founding along with other cofounders, certainly we wouldn‚Äôt be here without these guys coming together and taking action, and I have a deep regard and appreciation for Mike‚Äôs skills and talents as a developer and inventor. And, ultimately what has been created here is truly unique to any other project in every way, especially that of how everyone can be a part of building this project as a truly decentralized community of co-contributors.
