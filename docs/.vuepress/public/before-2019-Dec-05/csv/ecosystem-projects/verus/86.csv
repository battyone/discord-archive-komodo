Sellers stop selling, buyers trying to get filled quietly, price creeps up a little, then as the move speeds up we can call it a break out and chasing price occurs.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"18-Dec-18 11:53 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> @John Westbrook how much do we actually think FGPA miners have the potential to impact price beyond normal miners? I just see them as miners same as any... anyone who has a lot of hardware, can mine a lot. If someone considers themselves a miner, they will likely sell over hold, whether they have an FGPA or not. 

Why do we think these FGPA miners are supposed to be such a negative influence on price, over and above any other miner? Just because it was secret? Do/did they have the capability to control that much of the coin supply?";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"18-Dec-18 11:57 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> FGPA miners are largely ROI chasers. GPU and CPU miners usually mine in projects they like and are more likely to hold. This is based on what i heard in their discord. Also, price dropped 66% over the course of FPGA miners taking off.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"18-Dec-18 12:10 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> OK, but many altbtc pairs have dropped significantly recently too. KMDBTC from 25th Oct - Nov dropped 40%

If market conditions were such that price was rising, I suspect that FGPA miners would be selling less and we could attribute less significance to their effects on price. Market moves influence behaviour as much as behaviour influences market moves IMO.";"";"";

But what we do know is that they are 1. Dumping the coin based on their discord channel. 2. They stopped new people from mining the coin with gpu and cpu by pricing them out. 3. They had at least 75% of the hash rate. 4. They were discussing the prospects of a pump and dump. To what degree these affect short term price is difficult to tell but i sold my coins at this news and the price went down. Then i bought some again. The price has been steadily increasing since the news of the fork. And the fork gives fpgas miners less influence over pump and dump opportunites going forward.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"18-Dec-18 11:18 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Grenwolde> @Gloryman that is the biggest crock of horsecrap I have read in a while -- most of the FPGA miners also have gpu and cpu rigs -- they tend to be innovators at this stage and go forbid they also have  ASICS.  Their motivations are likely as broad as the rest of the motivations of this group.  However they tend to be willing to experiment with new technology .  I don't mine for altruistic reasons , I would generalise and say that of 90 plus percent of the people who mine this coin.  We support project, we buy and sell and a large number of us stake as well.  The reason that people are likely mining and selling verus is the concern about the direction of the project.  You are concerned about the minig power of the FPGA -- but in no way limit large GPU or even CPU farms -- one guy on her was bragging about the size of their farm.  As size that most of us small to medium sized miners can't comprehend -- hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment -- but not cutting edge.  Guess there is the difference.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"18-Dec-18 11:34 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Grenwolde you have not described our approach accurately. The approach is a goal of equalization, as there was secret mining by a small number of people intended to make a lot of money sniping coins. This is simply not good for the community or project. Why people are selling? Maybe Christmas, but we are still working on the vision, in spite of this detour to more decentralize PoW opportunities. We are soon going to release a new algo, and it will hopefully make it easier and better for many people to mine and coexist in the long run, even if/when FPGA devs can follow. Perhaps you noticed the FPGA and GPU bounties as well. When FPGAs do come again, maybe it won't be as unequally matched and used to provide a small number of secret miners an advantage over everyone else, which is an unsustainable approach anyways, but as a way to serve the entire community of miners who might be interested.";"";"";
