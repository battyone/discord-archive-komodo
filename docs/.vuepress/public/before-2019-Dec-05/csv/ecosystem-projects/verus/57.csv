"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"25-Nov-18 08:45 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> A few quick tips:

1 - Never save your passwords.  Come up with a formula for passwords and create a different password for EVERY site you use.
2 - For all crypto logins (exchanges for example) use an encrypted email address you never use in any public forum with association to your name.  So there's no way to associate you with the email address (except by exchanges themselves)
3 - Use a complex and long password for your computer

Personally I would not use Agama from a computer that has any potential security leaks (i.e. is used on public wifi's without vpn, is left unattended without locking/securing, work computer, etc)...and avoiding Windows can up your security experience.  If you want to up the security even further, buy a cheap laptop for dedicated use with Agama and similar wallets and never use it for anything else.  

Anyway, again, sorry to hear of your situation and hope you can move on without feeling too down about it.";"";"";

I just wanted to point out to those who just skim and scan , that the intangible effect of all this, is far greater than people seem to think.    This type of ecosystem growth and sharing catapults future projects and their development efforts.    New projects can come in to innovate and integrate their ideas with ease as opposed to setting up months of basis and groundwork.  

This is a fantastic compliment to Moore‚Äôs Law, but for developers and brings the possibility of the two growing exponentially in a more concurrent fashion.   (Anecdotal of course).";"";"";
