"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-Dec-18 07:22 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dude personally, I'm not afraid of FPGA miners. I was even arguing to cooperate and work with the FPGA company as we level the playing field, so that FPGAs are still the most professional option, but that CPUs and GPUs are reasonable for casual mining. It might seem surprising, but we really do believe in decentralized mining. We hope that PBaaS will also encourage more decentralized mining and make mining Verus more profitable as well. The more decentralized the network is, the more it will scale, and because of that, there will be a place for even casual miners, if FPGAs don't knock them all out now. We got to a point in discussions where we realized that the sticking point we were trying to secure for the community was that we would have assurance that if we said someone should buy the miners that they would still work after the fork, and it would not be a mistake for the buyer. The company really may not have been trying to be difficult, but they felt they needed to see the full algorithm before release, and we wanted to give them a sense for it with enough information for an FPGA dev to know if they could do it, then get assurance that they would. We realized that if we give them the algo and get no assurance, we would be here, but we would have given the algo that might help the community have a chance to catch up a little while the whole FPGA thing restarts with all of us having the experience of learning from this round. I think for the hardware companies, they need to think about who are their primary customers and how many they will sell.";"";"";

As a loyal and committed GPU miner, I also have FPGA's. The effect on Verus does concern me. That said - not a secret hidden group of ""secret miners"" - it is called innovation and the fact of the matter is FPGA is really efficient. And when people innovate on new tech they don't just ""put it out there to share"". It's brutal and hard fact of POW. All mining is about staying one step ahead, not trying to hurt individual and great projects. But the straight up facts are ... FPGAs are here. Many different companies and devs are in a race to develop efficient algorithms. It's evolution or we would be all mining on our palm pilots in the back of a horse buggy. So yes - it sucks. Fully get that. But you simply have to embrace it and adopt. Fork, modify, whatever. But no secret society out to get you - just folks with fast hardware that smokes GPU on this algorithm. Crypto won't survive if people blame innovation for distributing their calm peaceful world. Everything is disruption right now. I am holding a big chunk of Verus as love the passion and the project. But hating the FPGA folks is just crazy and misguided - it's here, it real, and it's not ""a company"" or ""centralized party"" coming after you.
