What I expect by identity is actually an identity that changes in time, and has time-based properties. Meaning: if someone from the network meet with me in person and confirms my profile photo matches my name and second name with my gov id - it will be differently weight in markin profile as true based on if that happen yesterday or 10 years ago. For example each profile check or even profile check type could have a life time, also specific properties could have a lifetime, and scale linearly to weight 0 at end of life. Also if someone confirms pgoto + name without id it will be differently weight. This way anyone can confirm anyone. Confirmation should send some points based on confirming profile rank. This way in time some institutions or profiles will come up which will charge fees for professional confirmations, and they will have big trust. HEre a penalty must be introduced - if someone cheated/mistaked. So profiles should have many properties regarding confirming profiles itself. This way everyone could be confirmed with his friends on facebook (for example) but much stronger in gov office or in some company doing such service, or even in a bank.";"";"";

The notion that a paperless voting system that is NOT 100% verifiable (as a blockchain would be) would be superior to paper is simply wrongheaded.  With paper there IS a record.  With the current system?  Who really knows.

Was the 2000 election a false flag?  Probably not.  But the result would be the same.  A non-verifiable electronic election is subject to all kinds of deception and frankly, it is just a matter of time before such a system is captured and used to keep one party in power indefinitely.  Just like 'digital books', electronic data can be edited on the fly.  Ie., what Wikipedia said in 2015 might bear little in resemblance to the same entry in 2020.";"";"";

Right now, you'll have to build, but I will post a Linux release when we validate it on pools. You can use it to benchmark your CPU with as well, using:
nhequminer -b -v
(-v turns on VerusHash)
