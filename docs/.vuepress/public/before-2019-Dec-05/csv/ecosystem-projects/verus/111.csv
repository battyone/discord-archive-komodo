But in short, it's a result of an algorithm change to equalize hardware, as FPGAs were ""too efficient"" on verushash 1.0. With the new algorithm GPU miners are still being optimized in aim to gain more hashpower, but as of now CPU is still favored.";"";"";

```... Chris has also helped us validate that the new VerusHash 2.0 does a much more complete job of equalizing non-CPU hardware. For now, the best GPUs will be comparable to a low to moderate speed CPU. Knowing Chris, he will improve performance over time, but even with multiples from where we are now, we have some hard evidence that the new algorithm is working exactly as intended. VerusHash 2.0 retakes its position in the crypto-industry as only algorithm we know of that can be mined competitively on CPUs alongside GPUs through equalization. We will find out soon how it stands up to FPGAs, and though I expect them to be able to mine reasonably, I'm confident it will do much better in that respect than the last algorithm. If we are successful in equalizing FPGAs in the final analysis, this will be the first algorithm ever to achieve that. ...
