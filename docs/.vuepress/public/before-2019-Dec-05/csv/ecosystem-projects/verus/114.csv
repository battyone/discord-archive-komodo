Mining centralization + geographical mining centralization to come with this, mostly located even more in china and some previous soviet republics. 3.) Less community as the average joe hobby miner will get forced out. 4.) Mostly more sell pressure due ROI. 5.) More FPGA producers to come and/or bitstreams for other models/types of FPGAs. 6.) More attack vectors due higher hashrate hardware and mining centralization. 7.) End of the year, chinese mining pool centralization.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"15-Feb-19 12:21 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @Oink , i don't forget this factor in no way. There are mega minor for the average household user so far compared to the whole hashrate. I will try to find a paper that adressed this issue for 2018 and it was way below 1% of the hashrate used from solar and wind energy. At a level at below 1% it isn't worth putting into into whatever calculation so far, even less taking it as an average. But it is of course an interesting point for future researches IF such setup could compare with <2 cents per kw/h mining facilities that use hydro power in the inner mongolia, Yunnan, Sichuan region in china for example. Or the atom power driven facilities in the former Soviet Republics that have acess to 2.5-4 cents kw/h electricity prices. Of course including the initial investment for these. Just adding here that chinese miners in other regions than the above mentioned are quieting mining at 5-6 cents as they can NOT compete with the electricity prices and facilities in the above mentioned regions. Means there is even mining centralization within china itself, quiet interesting by the way.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"15-Feb-19 12:46 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> Interesting points again i have discussed bevor. 1.) There are indeed miners that don't pay the electricity bills for themself, including students, stealing, whatever. Living at their partents does NOT count as the parents pay for it, hence the negative is still in the family no matter the son miner is sponsored. Makes actually sense. There are for sure such mining operation and a wild guess would be it's in the range of less than 1% again due the logical conclusion that more needs more hardware, special electricity setup and so on to get a higher level to have an impact on the whole worldwide hashrates. For sure for young projects like verus coin this percentage could be higher of course.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"15-Feb-19 12:46 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> No doubt again. To sum it up. the higher the hashrate and difficutly gets the less such miners you have in percent. About 2. That's actually a very missleading argument, mostly coming from previous asic-gpu discussions. First of all many bigger mining facilities are located in anyway cooler regions to limit such issues from beginning, see iceland, north china regions, north india regions, soviet republics, all colder regions. Second, compared to the hashrate output you don't produce that much heat. In my previous mining facility where i used about 75 kw/h the ventilation/heat dispersing power usage was around 1.5 kw/h only in the summer months (4 months and 0.0kw/h in the 4 winter months), just as an example. Now of course the larger the facility the more ventilation needed/dispersion needed. Yes and no without going into further details just let's assume there are some expenses needed. Again, at lowest electricity costs it's cheap anyway. Second and most important, these facilties have cheaper access to hardware than we in europe or the guy in the USA has. No shipping, no custom taxes, no nothing. Count here at least 25% less for hardware. Than these mining facilities get way cheaper prices or even worse, produce them their own way cheaper. If you pay now for an Asic 1,000 US$ Bitmain itself mostly produced it for 200 US$. Same goes for gpu minining farms with special Nvidia deals and i could bet the same with a facility that will build their own let's say 100,000 FPGAs. Now as an additionally argument you could add that these facilities have additionally expeneses for workers and so on. Sure, but these are highly efficient again and beat you. I guess your time has a value as well 😃 1 employee is mostly maintaining 1,000-10,000 units of whatever ....";"";"";
