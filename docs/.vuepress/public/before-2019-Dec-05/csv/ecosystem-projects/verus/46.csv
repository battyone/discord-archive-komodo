I am sure we should be able to solve it without an issue. @Hollowman9000, I have confirmed, pending full testing of the fix, that staking transactions are not added to the wallet until rescan, making it look to the wallet that the amount has left addresses under your control, though it hasn't.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"28-Oct-18 01:29 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Maybe I should clarify the announcement. Our Electrum now supports Sapling, and even transparent transactions are different in a number of ways. It doesn't have the full support for z-transactions that I believe is necessary for a good experience. Theoretically, you could send z-transactions through it, but there's more support needed to find them in your wallet, which will extend the API in a non-trivial way. We just didn't find ANY support for Sapling, even transparent txes, in any of the Electrum forks.
BTW, your issue is completely fixed in the coming update, and we're trying to make sure we have everything ready before release, as it includes the much better cheat catcher and a fix for the non-latin user names as well. the foundation is considering running some cheat tests  after activation which when foiled, will allow miners and stakers to make something on the cheats that the foundation tests.
Should I update the announcement?";"";"";

I wouldn't say it is a solution that Ethereum wasn't capable of. They haven't done it yet in production. No one that we know of has, and Ethereum's plans to solve it take a different philosophical approach, which ends up with a more complex implementation plan. Verus has a working, elegant, released solution for solving the POS nothing-at-stake problem, which will activate at block 227520 along with Zcash Sapling support.
Probably the best place now to learn about Verus coin is on the project Medium https://medium.com/veruscoin. @benohanlon wrote a great introduction, including public blockchains as a service (PBaaS) in the Pocket Guide, and @John Westbrook 's articles on the nothing-at-stake solution and Sapling give a great overview of what makes VerusCoin different today.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"28-Oct-18 03:35 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it means that there may be a frequently updated shared memory location that requires bus locking and/or spin locks. on few cores, this may be a very small amount of the total overhead, but as the cores increase, it can't scale, and eventually, synchronization consumes a large part of the overhead. in the wallet and nheqminer, i made sure multiple cores would not have this issue. Chris's ccminer beats my loop by interleaving 4 hashes at once, but if there is a multicore bottleneck, that will takeover at some point and nheqminer would win above a certain number of cores. alternately, you can take advatage of the speed in ccminer and divide your cores among multiple instances that don't share the same synchronization objects";"";"";

can I keep using Komodo Agama wallet or rather the seed and wifkey for my VERUSCOIN exported with Agama?
the reason why I ask is that Ihave not quite yet understood whether VERUS is a full Komodo clone that will at some point diverge from Komodo or whether it will remain in the same scope of keyspaces... ‚ùî üåê";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"29-Oct-18 05:53 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Hi, and welcome to the community! Here was my answer on Bitcointalk:
You can still use the same seed and WIF key for both wallets and all Komodo family coins. Verus is not really a clone as much as a friendly fork with its own technology and features. At the same time, we intend to remain compatible with Komodo as an ecosystem coin, meaning we intend to remain compatible with formats and share technologies. Sapling keys, for example are not supported yet in Komodo, but when they are, they will be compatible, as we will work with Komodo to integrate compatible changes. We have our own work on Verus Enhanced Agama, and though we expect a lot of our changes to be picked up by Komodo's Agama, they are also making changes, so there is not 100% overlap. We do pick up changes from them and vice versa. We will either converge changes more regularly or rebrand our version of the GUI wallet at some point with attribution. Until then, you should consider them generally compatible with feature differences, and you will need the Verus enhanced wallet to run Verus.

We are working on a Verus Branded, React Native mobile wallet as well, which will also be compatible with the same seeds and WIF keys. Until that is released, we recommend using the Agama or Pungo wallet on mobile.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"29-Oct-18 08:11 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm just curious and for all I know it might not even be possible but is there any way for something someday to be integrated into the agama wallet that so many coins share and use something like the crypto conditions so that as long as conditions are met by both parties it would be possible to make trades between two totally different coins without an exchange or third party? Probably very complicated but itd be nice if someday it were that simple for two users to trade different coins easily amongst themselves";"";"";
