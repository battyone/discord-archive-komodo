"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"19-Jun-19 01:24 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it looks like they dropped then added a lot of hash power and had some very poor connectivity at that moment, maybe even a network split. They began mining very fast on their own fork with more than 51% of the rest of the hash it looks like while the network was split. We attempted to connect to them with a couple nodes, but we never did confirm a connection until it was all over and their fork re-merged. It seems that broader network connectivity came back before it was considered irrecoverable and proof of power used the stake on the main chain, even though he had greater hash power to reorganize him to the right chain. It wouldn't have needed the notaries, but if somehow PoP would have failed, that would have been a secondary backup as well. If it had been irrecoverable, they would have had to reset their chain, but it would not have affected the rest of the chain.";"";"";
