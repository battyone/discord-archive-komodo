If the hash rate increases the block rate goes up, then over several samples the higher rate will cause the difficulty to go up, slowing the rate back down towards 1/minute.  Decreases in network hash slow the rate, triggering a decrease in difficulty over multiple samples to speed it back up towards 1 per minute.";"";"";
