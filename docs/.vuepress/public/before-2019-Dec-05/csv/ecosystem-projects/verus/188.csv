We can go big on selling PBaaS now, but as long as it is not implemented on main net, it'll be like selling hot air in the desert. We started to let the world know about PBaaS once it was on testnet, so people could experience it for themselves.
We are now starting to actively market Verus (K64 gaming conference in The Hague withg Micheal Tout jr for example)";"";"";
