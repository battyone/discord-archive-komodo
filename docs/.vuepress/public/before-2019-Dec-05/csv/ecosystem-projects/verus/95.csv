I'm looking forward to GPUs and even seeing what FPGAs can do, but right now, these miners only get a better deal than you due to their own economies of scale. I believe real decentralization happens when an unlimited number of people feel they can compete in mining and staking. At this time, everyone can mine proportionally to the CPUs they control, everyone. It will likely be similar in economics, maybe a little better with GPUs, and we will see what FPGAs do when they come back. Blackminer has said they are working on the algorithm, and there is an interesting other company, who seems to be making a nice offering with the community in mind. I do believe that when FPGAs come back, they will at least come back openly, and everyone will get to make choices with more information. As we saw in the early days of Verus, which also had some large CPU miners, these are likely mostly independent entities, just as the many more miners of smaller hashrate, who now have a chance, collectively make up a much longer tail. i'm just keeping my CPUs pointed at Verus.

Came up with a fast algo that ran well on F1 with Verus, and the individuals that owned them did benefit. But wan't some secret corporation. Blackminer just figured out a great solution to your algo, and it was individuals, not corporations mining it. How level is it with the hashrate chart I just put up? I just think it's like putting speed bumps on the buggy path to slow the cars down. It may work short term, but it just seem like a bad strategy and what I see would seem to demonstrate that. I have nothing but respect for your project, the hard work that has gone into it, and the future potential. I think the race to balance between decentralization and innovation is healthy. It will be a continual battle why we are on POW. But we gotta stop with the ""secret shit"". Yes - people use code names when the get a jump. It's called competing.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"30-Dec-18 10:10 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <its> @GEBucky Right now I have a dozen machines on Verus. I have also mined it with GPUs in the past. All the miners I have used have been open source and this seems to be integral in this community. I do have a couple of FPGAs running on different algorithms so I have nothing against FPGAs. At the end of the day, a successful coin has to distribute itself to the widest number of people and enable useful use cases. There is a lot of room for experimentation how to get there.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"30-Dec-18 10:14 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> There isn't a right or wrong here. This debate is essential to the future of crypto, at least POW crypto. But there are a lot of great closed source miners (zenemy, trex, cryptodredge). I don't begrudge them for keeping their IP private and charging a fee. If you don't like it, don't use it. Kinda my thinking there.";"";"";

Verus has ment to be a good mix between tech, and they have rightfully done so. FPGA folks weren't playing along, so there was a algo change. This time around they might have a change of heart, maybe not. Then we'll see the state of affairs. Right now you're bringing up the same old arguments before the fork, which aren't speaking to this specific project. g2g pack for a trip.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"30-Dec-18 10:18 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> We will see you soon @zpajk";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"30-Dec-18 10:26 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <its> @GEBucky Again, it depends on the coin and its community. I have used both open and closed source miners and usually it is not a prime consideration for me but the Verus folks have a slightly different view. I bet they would react the same if a closed CPU miner gave its users 20x advantage.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"30-Dec-18 10:32 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> My opinion on the fork is that it went perfectly. 100% of people with a decent cpu and decent electricity rates can compete. We always knew that the Chinese with cheap hardware, cheap electricity and cheap overheads would build farms that are better. With the new GPU miners on the horizon there will be a similar situation where big Chinese gpu farms will have a big advantage. The spreading out the hash rate now is much better. It's pretty much as good the project can realistically make it.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"30-Dec-18 10:41 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> Where exactly do you think the folks that have about 60% of the hash on Verus are right now?. Vermont? no. Kansas, no?. Don't get all xenophobic on the Chinese here. Lots of us companies building FPGAs (most are actually US based) and it has very little to do with electricity rates.  Have a look at that hash distribution. There must be 10,000 Threadrippers on Verus right now. they are not super efficient from an electricity perspective.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"30-Dec-18 10:44 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> And I did put 4 very high end CPUs on Verus - and we will see but right now not seeing how you get to the 100% working. I do not want to be  a hater here - but I am a realist. So will see how the hash distribution, and returns work out for CPUs. I will happily report my results.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"30-Dec-18 10:45 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Lumbi> If it was possible to identify where the big miners (PoW inflation) were coming from,  I imagine a distributed system of the future should be able to block them from reaching more than a total percentage of the hash --  like ddos attackers & cloud flare.";"";"";
