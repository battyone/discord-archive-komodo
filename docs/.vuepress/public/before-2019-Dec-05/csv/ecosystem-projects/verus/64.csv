I joined Verus in the beginning because it was enticing from a small miner to actually be able to make some decent coin. I stuck around because of the community and have no regrets, and will continue to mine. I think a lot of smaller/ new users of crypto might have the same mindset as me. ""Oh look something I can make beer money with, neat."" I feel if Verus allows fpgas to continue then that would be the end of any new users being enticed into trying out the coin and thus wouldn't stick around to find out how awesome the community we have built is. I don't feel that would mean Verus would fail, but I think it would slow our growth. Just my 2 cents.";"";"";

Decentralization will never be perfect. It's just enough if it is good enough. Decentralization was ment for double spend protection and abusers - and this is already fine as dPOW works for Verus? Or not? So in my opinion does not matter what algo you use, but if you believe it's most important you will never finish the key features, just be participating in algo-miner race like all the other small coins, that believe they are sth because of the algo. No they are not. The thing is to bring a new tool or new solution, like voting, and focusing on anything else for too much time is just delaying the true features to infinity. First time when I saw Verus project I though - really cool, let's watch it. Then I saw first few months they do not discuss how to make a better democracy - they discuss wallets and mining... same  waste as other projects... Nothing new = miners, wallets problems, hashing algos... nothing about voting.";"";"";

Today, almost every company has shifted to an infrastructure as a service (even Verus wants to be aaS); why Verus ""product"" should be affected by miners? From a ""product"" view, imho, mining is exactly the same as powering on a server, it serves to a purpose (the service) not the other way 😃 @miketout I would focus on delivering the ""product"", shifting the paradigm from mining for profit to mining because it is needed to run a service.
