I think the 2 worst case scenarios would have been a massive increase (so we all get less rewards), or no increase (indicating a lack of interest). 

However it may be that those mining now are just the existing community, but just put more hashpower on. 

But I'm optimistic with time and through spreading the word, people will start to understand the value of this coin and help us grow.";"";"";

If you're using Agama there's an option in the send interface (might only show up after you select private tx, I can't remember as I only really use CLI) to shield coinbases.
