• Exit the wallet and back up your wallet.dat in case something goes awry. Awry is a bad thing.
• Re-start Agama and on the dark-background screen with the Agama logo, click on the upper ""Activate Coin"" button. 
• Select Verus in the ""select coin"" drop down.
• Then in the lower ""daemon parameter"" drop-down scroll down and select the ""Daemon param: reindexing blocks from disk"" and let it do its thing which in my case took a few mins. I can't remember what it does to let you know when it's done but it was intuitive—even for a technical moron such as me.

Although the following shows Komodo rather than VRSC this is what you want to do:

After that, close the %appdata% folder and go to your agama wallet and stop mining and close the wallet,completely.
Then go to veruscoin.io website and download the newest version of the wallet, for gui its 0,3,12,  when its finished downloading, extract it to a folder called agama 0,3,12 that you can create and place where ever you like, i chose my desktop,once its extracted you go to your antivirus and add an exemption for the new agama 0,3,12 folder you just created ,
Now you should be ok to start the new agama 0,3,12 wallet, no need to click activate coin, just the usual in the native mode box , choose vrsc and it should start to sync back up to the block chain and your block or blocks should show up @Eightynine 👍🏼";"";"";
