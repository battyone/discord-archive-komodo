I don't believe that's true, as Josh was clearly involved in election cryptography before we spoke. We talked about that, and he probably said as much as he could without breaking an NDA. I didn't agree with him on everything, but I think his intentions were good. I was trying to be factual in my statement above, but it feels like it might be quoted a little more negative towards them than the disussion starter I meant. If we have Microsoft friendly people or ex-Microsoft friends who would be interested in the project partially due to me being lead dev, they are likely to also believe that this isn't a reaction to us or any kind of slight on PBaaS, and I suspect they'd be put off by a claim that Microsoft is reacting to PBaaS. I believe it is likely they will react to us at some point, but I don't think this is that. Going to sleep. I would feel better if we could find a more positive way to start the discussion, so it isn't cut off early.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-May-19 10:13 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I want to share some thoughts around voting, Microsoft's recent announcement of its importance to them, and perspective on what I understand to be their general approach. Also, as far as Verus is concerned, the voting is part of the vision of PBaaS powered public services, including polls and voting by and for the people. Many contributors in the community, including me, believe that the ""by and for the people"" is .an essential part of the credibility of a process. It is already clear that PBaaS, especially with reserve currency conversion, will enable many applications that can provide opportunity to a great number of people, organizations, and businesses across many sectors. There are people already working towards using PBaaS for some very exciting business opportunities, but we do not waver on the idea that the vision for polls and elections, decentralized ID and eventually machine learning applied to the data on behalf of the public, are central to Verus' future. That it is important enough for Microsoft to invest as well is validation that we are working towards an important vision, more than it is anything to fear as competition. IMO, it's good if they can improve election integrity, even as we disrupt the entire process over time.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-May-19 10:19 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I also want to share some information that I learned from Josh Beneloh when we spoke about blockchain and voting during his review of the Proof of Power paper. First, he stated off the bat that he didn't agree with blockchains being useful for voting, and when we spoke about reasons, I understood the following arguments from his perspective:
1. Proof of work can be 51% attacked, so there is simply a price for getting control of which votes get processed and which don't
2. Blockchains don't provide any significant value to the process, and for that reason, shouldn't be part of the solution. This led to probably the most fundamental issue over which we didn't not agree.
3. Centralization is not a bad thing and prevents coercion from parties that would unduly influence voters in a way that couldn't be policed
We also spoke in detail about confidential, verifiable, and transparent elections, and although I don't know that Microsoft would have done what they did in response to us, it is quite clear that the people involved had in-depth discussion and access to our vision for some time. When we spoke, Josh had already been working on election cryptography for some time, and he described the model that he believed would work to ensure confidentiality, verifiability, and transparence.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-May-19 10:21 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Obviously, with Verus Proof of Power, which was the paper he was reviewing, we were able to set aside #1, since the algorithm ensures that the blockchain is not subject to 51% hash attacks, even before we get to dPoW. #2 was a more fundamental disagreement.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-May-19 10:23 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Crupti I'll continue on this thread first, but as a brief answer, each vote/poll would run on its own PBaaS chain, and voting power would be part of the initial authorization. In actual elections, every participant would have the same voting power, and with notarization, a 51% attack could be argued to be basically winning the election, though that is a little tongue in cheek, it conveys the fact that any attack would be the voters attacking themselves.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-May-19 10:24 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> As stated in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights...";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-May-19 10:26 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We discussed reasons that he believed centralization was better than blockchains and algorithms that enabled decentralization, and from my perspective, it boiled down to trust in a central managing authority vs. the assumption that you can eliminate that trust. I don't believe we would get over that in the near term with any number of hours of conversation.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-May-19 10:29 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> He also felt that if people could vote in private and did not have to go to designated polling places, which of course is not dictated by the ability to vote using Verus, coercion by corrupt parties would be easier. I don't actually agree with that, but it was part of the discussion. Along those lines, he felt that any decentralized approach would not have the oversight needed to ensure that there wasn't coercion. Again, we don't see eye to eye on the potential for institutional coercion and the risk that decentralization may pose vs. mitigation of the total risk.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-May-19 10:33 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> He said that the voting model he believed would be best to preserve the CVT properties that we outlined in the vision paper was the following, in terms of work flow:
1. A person receives their voters information and authorization to vote at a voting center and casts a vote.
2. When they cast a vote, they are given a receipt that shows that they voted and that can be located in some available data of the votes.
3. If they want to verify that their vote was registered correctly, they must invalidate their vote and will then see that it was in fact the vote they cast
4. They can invalidate and revote as many times as they like until the end of voting";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-May-19 10:36 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> There are a lot of reasons this is better than what the public uses for voting today, but it does require trust of the managing authority at all times. Josh would probably disagree and say that the cryptography can always be used to validate that everyone did what they should have. In fact, the managing, tracking, and long term public preservation of all of the data is one of the benefits of blockchain that is actually missing in that model and dependent on the managing authority to accurately provide.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-May-19 10:41 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> For example, many actual elections involved people standing in lines for hours to vote. If that happens, I don't think people will trash their vote to be sure it worked only to get another. At the same time, what about all the votes that come in near the end, when people really don't have the time to trash the vote and try again? What about changes at critical times to the data, or trusting a specific provider as the accurate source of data vs. a public blockchain that everyone shares? I believe that technically, all of these problems are arguably solvable without blockchain, but without a broadly shared, maintained, confirmed, and preserved trustless database, every one of those steps requires trust.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-May-19 10:42 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I suspect that Josh Beneloh is reasoning from a Western Society point of view.
- Not everybody that is entitled to vote has access to the electronic means to vote in private, so the coercion argument flies out the Windows.
- People in (formerly) unstable regions of the world will be suspicious of any form of governmental/commercial involvement. Even governments don't trust big companies, when they originate from a (in their eyes) hostile nation. (e.g. Huawei & 5G networks)
- An invalidate/recast voting system may cause extra stress on the voting system. If done on a large scale, elections could be influenced by crashing the entire system.
- If a vote can be invalidated, that means that is a possible attack vector for parties trying to influence the elections.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-May-19 10:50 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> The idea of vote transparency is a strength with PBaaS, tamper proof elections where no one can afterwards claim they won even though they did not - and the voters ability to * at any point in time * being able to validate their cast vote with the blockchain.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-May-19 11:00 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Excellent point, a vote should always be tied to a digital signature which can not be directly connected to the voterÂ´s true identity - unless you give your permission. If the blockchain is centralized then at least voter IPÂ´s can be tracked as the nodes could potentially all be located inside a datacenters where all network traffic is being logged. With a decentralized blockchain voter IPÂ´s will be untracable since the blockchain nodes are located all over the world.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-May-19 11:03 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> But what I think may be a major issue in the future is: Accepting a decentralised voting system would demand couraged leaders, and as we know, most (political) leaders are anything else but couraged. So they will decide to rather accept a centralised system prone to manipulation, but under their control, than a decentralised one they can't control. Because all they want _is_ control. Which also implies that voting will never be truely anonymous, although it is claimed to be or even stated in many countries' constitutions.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-May-19 11:07 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think the answer to that, @Thoskk is starting with small insignificant elections (clubs electing their president) proving to the administration that the system works and gradually work our way up the chain.

But that's not even the point. Because this kind of election system would break with traditions, it's new, few people understand what it is, most haven't even heard about. And it's a long, long way to go until it may be accepted in a smaller country, but in the bigger ones ... I can't see that right now.

The blockchain technology is a misunderstood and underappreciated tool at the moment. I see however great potential for countries that are struggling with democracy and still working their way into trusting democracy.
Imagine the people walking for a day, to stand in line for hours to cast their vote, to find out afterwards that the election was rigged. Now you can use a larger voting window than usual and visit all the remote places with mobile infrastructure and let people vote in their vicinity. At the same time the people that go to the voting stations have a larger voting window, so the queues will be smaller, if any. Added bonus is that if you want to intimidate people at the voting stations you'll have to keep them for much longer in order to get the effect you intend.";"";"";
