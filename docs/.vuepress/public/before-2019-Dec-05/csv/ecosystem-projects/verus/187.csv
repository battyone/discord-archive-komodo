I'm that slow reader. Just repeatedly read a part until I feel like I understand it's context and meaning. üòÖ";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"28-Jun-19 04:57 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> have few questions now. Please note that this is coming from a blockchain core newbie:
- in MMR the TXO commitments delays play some role in it's security and validity of the txout spends. How long is this delay in Verus' implementation?
- Need also a clarity and confirmation that if Mountain Merkle Ranges are compatible and implementable on the same blockchain which uses Merkle Roots? I feel like sounding a bit silly asking this question, but just asked.
- In that newsgroup post of Peter's it says the MMR TXO commitments can be verified solely by the Full nodes as well, if they wish to, as I understand from the concept of MMR the peaks can be used to generate the path to validate the UTXO/STXO/TXO spends/unspends. With that understanding the Miners doesn't has to do the amount of work for the validation part of these MMR. If I understood this part correct, can you please clear how this validation of peaks and TXO commitments are handled in Verus? If it is validated by the miners, is that implementation applied to the stagers as well?";"";"";

Feel a bit confused on this part. I understand with MoMoM implementation, the Notary Nodes play a role to keep the Merkle Roots data notarised and that helps any network full nodes to validate the proof of some transaction happened on any other cross blockchain.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"28-Jun-19 05:18 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Theoretically you should be able to retrieve that data from the chain you have in store.

- PBaaS is very exclusive to Verus
- Verus Reserve currency will be very exclusive to Verus too
- Thank to Verus reserve currency, the PBaaS ecosystem very much like Komodo's Smartchain ecosystem will make it a centre of not just Verus PBaaS, but also Komodo Smartchains as well. This is also amazing in sense where you don't even worry about Atomic Swaps. It is amazingly cool tech development.";"";"";

- 51% attack resistant even without dPoW, that means Verus is having 3 layers protection:
- Consensus algo 50%: Verushash v2 Proof of Work
- Consensus algo 50%: Verushash v2 Proof of Power/Proof of Stake
- Consensus algo makes it 51% attack being 50/50
- Komodo dPoW notarisation is 2nd' layer of 51% attack.";"";"";

And this currently accounts to 90% of crypto investors..look at Tron. Shitcoin. Even Iost is better but thats wht market relies on nowadays";"";"";
