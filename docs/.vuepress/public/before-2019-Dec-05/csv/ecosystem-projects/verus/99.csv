"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"10-Jan-19 08:43 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> But to get back to your previous question about differences between ARRR and VRSC, great question!  yes, there are a lot of differences. I'll share a few of the more distinct Verus specifics 😃  Verus has a unique and new consensus algorithm called Proof of Power which is a 50% PoW/50% PoS algo that solves theoretical weaknesses in other PoS systems (Nothing at Stake problem for example) and is provably immune to 51% hash attacks.  With this, Verus uses the new hash algo, VerusHash 2.0.  VerusHash 2.0 is designed to better equalize mining across all hardware platforms, while favoring the latest CPUs over older types, which is also one defense against the centralizing potential of botnets. Unlike past efforts to equalize hardware hash-rates across different hardware types, VerusHash 2.0 explicitly enables CPUs to gain even more power relative to GPUs and FPGAs, enabling the most decentralizing hardware, CPUs (due to their virtually complete market penetration), to stay relevant as miners for the indefinite future.  As for anonymity, Verus is not a ""forced private"", allowing for both transparent and shielded (private) transactions...and private messages as well.";"";"";

In a hypothetical situation with 3 big coins, not just one, that share compatible hash hardware, the current model can incentivize regular 51% attacks on every chain until their value drops to where it is pointless. The only argument that it can be sustainable, necessarily assumes one big winner, which is not what we see as the natural evolution in crypto, and in any fast moving technology, is unlikely to be a stable status quo. Pure PoS is extremely centralizing over time, and as you point out, if there is mining, the first coin needs to be mined. At least with 50/50 strengths are boosted, there is some loyalty to the system in block validation, and there is always the opportunity to contribute and earn from an outsider with work capacity rather than funds.";"";"";

Of course, maybe over time, it will reduce the value of coins that are constantly attacked, but now scenarios where a coin can be 51% attacked and retain value long enough for the attacker to cashout his stake exists";"";"";
