Earlier this year, I had 4 or 5 NEO, then $40+ that I sent from Binance to Cryptopia. After I sent it, CT took down their NEO wallet due to maintenance. Long story short, I didn't see those coins, for 5+ weeks... It took Binance & other exchanges, only a few hours to fix their NEO wallet, bc of network issue...

The white paper also states fair distribution as one of its key goals. So, at this stage of the project I think they should be banned and the currency forked.
