If you have, it would be safest to make a new address in Verus Agama, DO NOT import that into Komodo Agama, and send your coins to the new address.

You might be able to add safeguards, but still need addresses and keys in order to do that. Once you give up control to the smart contract, you can limit how much damage you can do with your own keys, and how you might change them using other information, which also could limit what damage someone else might be able to do. In any case, if someone gets your keys, which was the issue with Komodo's Agama, they can do anything you can do. If you use some other form of secure information, like biometrics, then eventually, there is still some authorizing information, which if compromised, will be an issue. We will still leave more communication on this to Komodo before in-depth discussion, but we think there are a few things that can be learned from based on what we've seen so far. I wouldn't limit ourselves to a smart contract wallet, and I think if such a code base was attacked in a similar way, it may provide no additional real protection.";"";"";
