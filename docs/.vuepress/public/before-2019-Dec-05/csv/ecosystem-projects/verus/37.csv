The criteria for a cryptocurrency to be listed is the following:

- Must be a cryptocurrency or a crypto token.  (OK)
- Must be on a public exchange with an API that reports the last traded price and the last 24 hour trading volume. (DP is getting there, it seems)
- Must have a non-zero trading volume on at least one supported exchange so a price can be determined.  (OK)
- For market cap ranking, an accurate circulating supply figure is required. (OK)

If you'd like to have a cryptocurrency listed and it meets all of the criteria, please fill out the request form.";"";"";
