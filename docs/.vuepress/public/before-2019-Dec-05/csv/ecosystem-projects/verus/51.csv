The multi sig was more for a public pooled staking thing we are doing.

A few of the members from the Ginasis Pool, had a private thing going, where we all sent our verus yo a single wallet, therefore increasing its balance, and therefore, the likelihood that we would get more blocks from the POS.

However, we are looking to now take it public due to the fantastic results the 10 of us achieved from out private pool.

We did it to help even out some of the randomness, and to create another stream of income from out combined efforts. I personally was the one responsible for keeping track of the eearnings and the fair and even distribution to the participants, based in their contribution amount into the pool.


We at Ginasis, recognize that there needs to be a MASSIVE level of trust in that you need to sent your verus yo someone, whom you have likley never met, and at the end of the day, there is nothing to stop them stealing it from you. This was an issue for us in our private group aswell, where a few members had met eachother face to face, but as we are all from a few different states in australia, we havent all met. However, we all had a go, and a bit of trust, and it just escalated from there, out first pooled week was about 12k verus. And our highest week was nearly 30k.

The multisig was mentioned as a way of preventing having never met people from been an issue, as it would require 2 or more separate people to sign off on the TX out of the combined pool wallet, so, if you can have that, it can then be used to instill a huge layer of trust, as you could have a few of the high standing members in the verus community as authorized signatories to send anything out of the wallet.

I hope that makes sense. And I hope you see the value in multisig. But i understand it's not needed for most things.

Apparantly, it is supported, and we are looking into it. But we are not 100% certain of this, and we are by no means coders of any sort.";"";"";
