https://github.com/opentimestamps/opentimestamps-server/blob/master/doc/merkle-mountain-range.md
We actually use more advanced MMRs than is written up anywhere, in the sense that we are including proof of work and stake in the MMR tree for the chain. There is a research paper that described using just work in an MMR on a proof of work chain to make an ultra-light client that can validate transactions. Their use of MMRs is closer to Verus: https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/226.pdf
Finally, the implementation is a scalable system that uses chunked memory allocation, templated node types that can include stake, work, power, nothing, or other properties. It also includes a virtual overlay on the active blockchain array (no space used for lowest layer, saving half space with nodes realized when needed). It's quite flexible and could be adapted to other blockchains as well.";"";"";

The real adventure is the other possible solutions offered by the industry researches around.
You can have a look at them, try to understand them, and it is possible that may be one of them could end up in any of your favourite project.

As I understand MMR is a solution to handle blockchain bloating, and keeping the blockchain UTXO size small or manageable, like some level help in scaling as well as to make the light wallet clients better 
and securer as compare to existing protocol and data structures. I'd definitely need correction on this part if anything needs correction on this understanding.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"27-Jun-19 08:10 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> And since UTXO is a part of Transparent public transactions only, this scaling part applies to the 1 part of Veruscoin.";"";"";

Another cool thing about the MMRs if i understand them correctly, along with reducing blockchain bloat, it also uses only those small fractions of each to make up a whole, but in doing this all chains are verifiably connected in the blocks along with being much smaller in size.
