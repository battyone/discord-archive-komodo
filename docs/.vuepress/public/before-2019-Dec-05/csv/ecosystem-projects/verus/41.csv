If we are moving sideways while holders are acquiring more coins with staking, that means that demand is constantly rising, because it meets the constantly increasing supply.

there is so much wrong with using that chart like that without context. 

currently we are basically flatlining around 2, although creeping up a little. If the project demonstrates incremental successes and there is a good reception and uptake on cryptopia, then this should be a price floor. If not, honestly I don't know how low a bearish alt can go apart from 0. I don't want to make any guesses as I'm less familiar with early alt price behaviour, but I am generally thinking it'll take some months before we get readable/tradeable market moves. At the moment it's all about your preference, risk tolerance and personal intepretation of VRSC value. Personally I never like trend following as a starting point, so if one thinks it's bearish, it's time to consider buying IMO";"";"";
