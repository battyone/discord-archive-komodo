Consider how mining profitability has become an issue lately and how some miners jump ship every day in search of something else. Now consider mining Verus and while you're at it, mining several other projects at the same time at no additional cost to the miner. Seems like a no brainer choice and eventually with PBaaS projects growing by choosing to be on the most advanced/secure network and miners having options, Verus can become it's own micro-economy that would offer miners/stakers and project developers an alternative that would be very hard to compete with.";"";"";

Picture mining VRSC and hitting a block for them but also earning rewards for other projects just as if you were mining them.";"";"";

This is an excerpt from something I found online:
Merged mining works like this, you have two totally separate block chains, they are not related in any way nor does either contain any data from the other. When you mine you generate hashes that may be the solution to the current block, this is very very improbable per hash, its like a lottery where everyone generates tickets until someone finds the winning one. Normally you make tickets and check them against the Bitcoin block chain to see if they are the solution. With merged mining you create a ticket and check it against both the Bitcoin block chain and the other block chain, Bitcoin and the other chain know nothing about each other, they are two totally different lotteries with different winning numbers, you just sent a copy of your ticket to both. Since you are sending the same ticket to two lotteries you increase your chances of winning one or the other. No Bitcoin data goes into the other and none of the other coin's data goes into Bitcoin they remain totally separate, you simply run both the other coin's and Bitcoin clients on the same machine and submit hashes to both networks, if your hash is the solution to the other coin's block you get it's reward, if you hash is the solution to the Bitcoin block you get Bitcoins, its exactly like if you were mining on just one network, except you submit the same work twice.""";"";"";

Verus is very technically impressive already but it's really shaping up to be something truly special.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"08-Mar-19 08:20 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, I had read all that info and compared it (in my head) with the way pBaaS is structured. Instead of continuously making a chance on both chains, the auxilairy pBaaS chain isn’t in continuous contact with the main chain: a far more efficient way to lighten the load on the main chain, which is a huge pro, IMHO.
My main reservation on merged mining is that big mining farms will simultaneously gain more control over several chains. Decentralization is at peril, which is IMHO an unwanted scenario.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"08-Mar-19 08:23 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> True. On the other hand: Merge mining will decrease the footprint mining has on our global energy consumption. (f*ck*ng autocorrect...)";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"08-Mar-19 08:26 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don’t agree. Since a miner is simultaneously mining multiple chains, profitability goes up.
