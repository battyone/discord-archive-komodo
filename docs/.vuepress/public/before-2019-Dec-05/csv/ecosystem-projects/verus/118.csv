"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"19-Feb-19 11:24 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> For example, the current PBaaS work will enable a combination of merge mining and stake-based contribution to PBaaS chains that scales and allows PBaaS projects to start up and offer earning to miners and stakers, as long as they are also mining and staking Verus. This means that each miner will be able to both mine Verus, and currently (could change before even early release) up to 8 other PBaaS chains of their choice at the same time, each hash being leveraged across all 9 chains.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"19-Feb-19 11:27 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> every miner or staker could choose to participate in these projects or not, and the combination of projects they choose to mine and stake could be different for every single miner and staker if there are that many live projects running. Most often, miners and stakers will choose projects to support based on profits, but often people will choose projects to mine and stake along with Verus because they believe in the project, bringing new people constantly to the Verus ecosystem and providing more decentralization incentive through that as well.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"19-Feb-19 11:33 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> If we find that there is an issue in imbalance based on VerusHash 2.0, I believe that the work we did there, which was originally targeting a more modest equalization than we have achieved, could be adapted for further equalization. Right now, there are new generations of CPUs coming out, and we have yet to see how FPGA evolves. To the extent I have concerns about the potential impact of FPGAs on decentralization of the network and growth of Verus as a whole, I believe we should consider these factors as data to inform our decisions going forward. I think UKMiner and Cuttlebit have done an incredible job developing their FPGA designs in an open and community friendly way, and Cuttlebit has also expressed interest in helping the community support additional hardware types or possibly even providing feedback or help on algorithmic tuning for the best network health and decentralization over time. Where we are now is a far better position than we were when the first FPGAs came out, and none of this particular round of discussion takes the PoS component, which is 50% of network validation, security, and distribution into account. I have recently heard from people who have been accumulating during the recent drops, and by doing so, they are participating in another form of decentralization that will contribute to health and security of the network as well.";"";"";

Neither the Verus Coin Foundation, nor I have any affiliation with or compensation from UKMiner, and that is just my personal opinion based on how they were first recommended to us and their work and open cooperation all the way through.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"20-Feb-19 12:13 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ukminer17 is right about that CPU being the best price/perf that I've seen recently. It's not the best performance of all choices, and some of the newer CPUs have yet to be fully optimized, but from those easily available, it's best bang for the buck and the example we used to determine that the UKMiner V1 is just over 1.5x price/performance. All of the Ryzen or threadrippers seems to be ahead on price performance over other CPUs right now.";"";"";

And when you consider the kind of community member/investor who's still anywhere within a hundred miles of crypto after the year we've had, honestly, I have to admit I think some ppl- I'll even include myself- might be in a little more need of certain reassurances as they conduct their research and due diligence....I continue to support Verus.
