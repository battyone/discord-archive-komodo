"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"25-Jan-19 06:12 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> Verus seems to have a very different community to the usual ICO & Dump crowd, so not sure the DEX listing will be too detrimental";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"25-Jan-19 06:48 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I really think this and many listings for the right reasons are only positive, not detrimental. If people wanted to dump Verus, they already have the ability to do so. People sell and there is some volume, but many just don't want to sell at these prices. The closest thing I saw to dumping was when secret mining gave a very small number of people the ability to mine coins much less expensively than everyone else, and we had some people with many coins who had no idea why they should care about the project besides they could snipe it. Right now, a new exchange, especially a DEX with a lot of customers who don't yet know about Verus, will only spread awareness and provide some additional liquidity, that will be more important when PBaaS is released to prevent giant pumps, which are also not healthy, IMO. It should also secure CMC listing, which is another way to spread awareness. In the case of Verus, I see a risk in many small listings, which isn't as much about more selling as it is a distraction from what's important. I think Crypto Bridge listing is only positive, and I'm grateful that we have a community that could pull together as we did to make it happen.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"25-Jan-19 06:52 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout I agree. I have been trading Verus more now recently. There are some big sales of the coin going on but in never pushes the price much below 2900. There is also a lot of big purchasing going on. I for one want to accumulate coins. Hey @miketout , when you develop the PBaas how will you demonstrate it? I'm really curious.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"25-Jan-19 06:56 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> btw, with all that said, I hope that people both buying and selling Verus could spread the volume around on the exchanges that do support us. show them all a little love ðŸ˜‰ 
@Gloryman the vision paper describes that. there are companies talking about leveraging PBaaS beyond the foundational applications described in the vision paper, which are polls, elections, identity, but nothing I could disclose at this time, since those are companies, not our community project itself. Have you read the vision paper? You might want to take a look, if not: https://veruscoin.io/downloads/papers/VerusVision.pdf";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"25-Jan-19 06:58 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout I will spread the volume. I have read the white paper but it can be difficult for a pleb like me to understand. I get the points about polls and creating multiple block chains that can be scaled and rolled into one.  But I thought you might want to test and demonstrate the technology before it gets to being on a business.";"";"";

I believe that I should at least use a little of my time to encourage those kinds of efforts as I build PBaaS, for the benefit of the project and community. I will not be able to generally help people know how to build on PBaaS until it is working. after that, I'd love to see you and others use it for many things.";"";"";
