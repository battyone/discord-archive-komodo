I believe this is exactly what the cpu equalization mechanism intrinsic to Verus was meant to address, and I believe it is one such example of an elegant attempt to mitigate the dangers you speak of. Whether it's enough is a question that will have to be continually addressed, as we've already seen with the necessitation of Verushash 2.0 to counter the nebulous fpga's. That response by @miketout and the team, I believe, is emblematic of the kind of approach that will be required to address the big questions we will continue to face- vision, courage, innovation and steadfastness in pursuit of the ultimate goal.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"17-May-19 09:39 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Although the idea was inspired by the massive drop in network has seen last monday, your answer made it clear to me that this system should not be used to arbitrarily block out high end systems. The fact that I am using the word arbitrarily implies that we would centrally decide which hardware is acceptable to use and which are not. A blockchain is a consensus system, if this system is to be used in a chain, the parameters the system uses must be acquired by consensus too (a PBaaS poll could come in handy for this).
The mechanism is not meant to cripple a chains developement, although I see the possibility of doing so if the paramaters are too strict. In fact I gave the example of too strict parameters myself by tuning down the profit model so far that a Pi would have the same profit chances as a FPGA. I fully agree we  are depending on peoples greed to keep the PoW securing the network in place. What I intend to achieve is a more evenly distribution of the hashpower, by limiting the centralized upscaling of hashpower (just like government do with anti-monopoly regulations) and promoting adoption of this blockchain by more people by offering them a fair chance to profit from securing the chain on their own, with *relatively* low spec devices that everybody can afford, or in  already own.
Bear in mind that if and only if the parameters are set correctly, it would only effectively restrict your earning if a desired the network hashrate is large enough to effectively secure the chain. The mechanism is it's own profitability mechanisme: if the hashrate is high, it's not profitable enough for some people to be enticed to mine, but if the hashrate is low the profitability will entice them to hop on. It is basically making use of the profit-switching mining conduct people are displaying today.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"17-May-19 09:39 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The upgrade to Verushash 2.0 is indeed an elegant way to mitigate the dangers of hash power centralization. The effect it has does indeed seem to have the reuired effect. We cannot expect, however, for every chain to adopt this algorithm, nor do I wish to. (If only one algorithm would survive, it would be everybodies focus to find loopholes in it). The mechanism could be implemented on any PoW based algorithm, should the developers wish to do that, because the mechanism is not working on hardware level or algorithm level, but on blockchain level.
It could also provide an extra security for 100% PoW chains, since the needed 51% for a succesful attack would be much harder to achieve. Also it could help in the (idealistic, I admit) goals of global energy preservation. In this context I'll make a comparison to a known practise in the navy:
`On any submarine there's an ongoing hunt to identify and eleminate the loudest noise, in order to make the boat more silent and less detectable. Once the loudest noise is eliminated another existing noise is labeled as the loudest noise.` Society is doing the exact same thing in energy consumption rigt now: from the transition from filament lightbulbs to LED light bulbs to the transition from gas guzzlers to energy efficient cars.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"17-May-19 09:39 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I predict a time where blockchain mining is considered a waist of energy (In fact China already named it as one of their reasons in trying to reduce the national blockchain industry), despite the profits it yields.
Humans insatiable urge to deplete (natural) resources for monetary gain is a big factor that drives our global economy, but at the same time puts that economy at risk, due to depletion of said resources. I'ld hate to see the same happen to the blockchain economy.
Bear in mind that I put up my original piece to start a discussion, so I welcome all feedback, positive and negative.";"";"";

But it could be used to avoid concentration of power, which pools are too. I think it would actually not benefit large players, because they will be economically be restricted more than small solo miners, that don’t find a block within a day anyway.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"17-May-19 10:46 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It actually favors large amounts of small miners, as opposed to a small number of big miners.";"";"";

I have some questions regarding project. I mean no offense by anything I say, as I am misunderstanding a lot of things given my lack of knowledge.

I can't really wrap my head around what VerusCoin is doing. It seems like a hybrid (PoW with unique hash and PoS) coin, with the ability to create individual blockchains.
Doesn't the goal of this project conflict with Komodoplatform, its parent chain? What's the utility of making another platform, when the parent chain is also geared towards accessibility towards new blockchain creators? What is the utility of this coin?";"";"";

They get a provably 51% hash attack resistant Verus proof of power algorithm. They get independence and separability from the Verus ecosystem. They get Komodo interoperability, the same CPU-mineability and field tested FPGA-equalization of VerusHash 2.0, and they will have the ability to be reserve currencies with protocol based, market driven conversion.

It is a decentralized protocol built by blending Komodo, Zcash, and Verus technologies, and similar to the Komodo philosophy can be used by a project without any central entity being paid. Also, as with Komodo, you can certainly get help from people in the ecosystem and easily provision Komodo notarization and interoperability as well.";"";"";

I think this is the answer I was looking for. This is actually an amazing project.

JL777 was talking very highly about you and this project, so I thought I would check it out. I see why now.";"";"";

No middleman taking his cut and since Verus is run by miners and stakers and not a centralized authority, pricing should be more competitive and dictated more so by natural market conditions than any centralized ""gatekeeper"" tasked (or trusted?) with the possession of your sensitive data. I think when Verus is in full swing, companies will soon find that there will be no room left for middlemen to slip their greasy fingers in the jar any longer.🥇";"";"";
