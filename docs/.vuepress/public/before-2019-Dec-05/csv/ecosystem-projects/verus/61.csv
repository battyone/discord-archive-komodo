But centralization is a point of view so who ever is the loser in being decentralized will argue that everyone else is centralized.  In other words, if bitcoin forked tomorrow and was only CPU mineable all the ASIC miners would argue that bitcoin is now centralized to large CPU data centers.

At least with developer agility you would think their interests would represent the community and if that representation were untrue then there wouldn't be much of a community left.  For example, I've witnessed mixed feelings here about how the developer responded.  Of course, it all remains to be seen what will happen next.  My opinion is that it's the coin, use case, adoption, and such factors that actually matter.  Bitcoin is ASIC and successful as hell and there are sorts of examples of popular coins that are either CPU/GPU/ASIC/FPGA POS etc etc... even coins that are 100% premine and doing just fine.  It's bold success that matters.  Everything else is just squabbles of inferiority.";"";"";
