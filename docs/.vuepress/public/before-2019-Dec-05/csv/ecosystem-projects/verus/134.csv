Veruspay currently supports Veruscoin and Pirates payments, but the development continues. The plug-in connects to the coins chain using it‚Äôs own wallets and is therefore independent, just like any full wallet on the coins network.
The liquidity you are referring to is due to the fact that this project was launched without an Initial Coin Offering or pre-mining.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"30-Mar-19 05:36 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Interesting question. They're really not the same thing. though there could be some overlap in larger projects. In fact, each of the PBaaS chains are not exactly children, and are actually started with transactions that make offers to the entire Verus community of miners and Verus owners to participate in, mine, and support their projects and applications through a scalable, decentralized cross-chain protocol. This will enable even transiently created and abandoned blockchains to operate on behalf of applications, or long term projects to start up with easy configuration and a scalable future, without requiring any immediate development or alternate infrastructure provisioning on the part of the person, organization, or application creating the blockchain for its use. PBaaS chains could even be fairly launched, expected to stay coupled to Verus or another Verus chain as part of a project or application, or even launched and separated at a later date. They can also have pre-mines, funding/conversion periods, and will be able to earn their own native rewards, Verus, or a combination of the two. All chains will be automatically merge-mineable, have support for 51% hash attack protection, cross chain transactions, and all basic features of Verus, as well as the ability to develop smart transactions to support applications.";"";"";

The PBaaS upgrade will include a unique (to my knowledge) PoS proof in the header itself that enables a header to be much more trusted than on other PoS enabled chains, and is part of what makes the automated cross-chain system more secure as well. As far as I know, there is not another PoS system with such a header proof of the stake that won the block.";"";"";

I am also a member of another community where I see they run a similar tipbot that we have here. I also just see that the tipbot they use has a staking feature that I would like to have we had the opportunity here too.

I have now mined verus the last 3 months and have mined about 150 coins at that period, which I am very happy with as I only mine on a single pc that mostly only mining for 10 hours a day.

I have staked my coins ever since the start but have not yet received any staking reward, this may be because the pc must have a restart once in a while and i have so few coins still.

Such a function in the tipbot could result in smaller miners such myself being able to place coins in a staking pool to get faster reward.

I thought this might have been a good idea for this community as well?
sorry if i post this in wrong channel, i was trying to find a suitable place to post this.";"";"";
