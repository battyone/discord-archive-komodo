Take all the uber super coins born to solve counterfeit issue...since Verus is a latin word, let me explain my point of view in latin: Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?¬†
They are facing a 2000 years problem: you have an immutable and ethernal proof of....something manually entered by a human. At the end, you still need to trust a third party.";"";"";

With the inclusion of Crypto Conditions, a company can have a very targeted config at the blockchain level, specifically serving their own niche purposes.  The Stake Guard CC, for example, is the first to be activated on Verus, but any org or company could, through PBaaS, stand up their own blockchain and code their own CC that is, essentially, ‚Äúapplication specific‚Äù and the community is rewarded as providers of the blockchain services.  I‚Äôm speaking in very general terms btw.
