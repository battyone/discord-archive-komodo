"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Jun-19 07:39 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> exactly, but I am working on much cooler capabilities than basic Bancor :)
right now, I have the code setup to enable a full solution to liquidity, high volume, friction free, decentralized exchanging of reserve currencies, also with a solution to front running. Miners and stakers will make blocks that can include conversions to and from a reserve currency. The reserve ratio is determined by a starting point, and then can be modified at every block by things like emission and burn transactions. The reserve ratio is then a function of the starting reserve and net emission. In any single block, all transactions, both buy and sell that can be processed, are, whether or not there are sellers when people want to buy or buyers when people want to sell. Market conversions will always get put into a block and processed as long as they can fit. Limit conversion orders will process if they can be added to the block and still meet the target limit price for conversion.
So, how do we solve front-running and eliminate the possibility of flash trading?
All conversions processed in a single block get exactly the same conversion price for both buys and sells (NO SPREAD!)
There will be a small fee that effectively beats all exchanges but will go only to miners and stakers of the PBaaS reserve chains, which is where the conversions take place, providing even more of a network effect for merge mining and profit opportunities for people who mine and stake chains well beyond block emissions.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Jun-19 07:48 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We also expect to make this easy from the wallet across reserve chains, providing full liquidity sharing across the Verus ecosystem, meaning that if any PBaaS fractional reserve currency independently gets on exchanges, it is an option, not a requirement, since full liquidity will be built into the cross-chain protocol.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Jun-19 08:04 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> so is that like VRSC is used to create a reserve currency independent chain?
like putting for example 2 VRSC and defining the supply of 200 XCOIN, and that value to each unit of XCOIN a 0.01 VRSC as on its creation? and then when a part of these 200 XCOIN is converted back to VRSC, the value of the rest of the XCOIN is adjusted ?";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Jun-19 08:04 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> is my understanding correct?";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Jun-19 08:06 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Another question is, can these reserve currencies be only PBaaS chains only or can other independent blockchains from KMD ecosystem or even outside of ecosystem be used in reserve currencies system etc?";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Jun-19 08:07 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> like with bancor they basically supported ETH only tokens, and now they also support EOS tokens extend it outside it's core ecosystem, what it will look like with PBaaS reserve currencies ?";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Jun-19 08:35 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You understand the conversion correct.
Any PBaaS chain will have the Liquid reserve capabilities in addition to all the protocols already implemented in the Komodo ecosystem. So using CC etc, they can interact with any other chain, but not in the sense they interact with Verus, since the protocols Mike described only exist in the Verus Ecosystem.
If this mechanism was implemented in the Komodo ecosystem, basically every chain in the Komodo ecosystem chain could  use it, but for now, it's only the PBaaS chains.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Jun-19 08:49 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> It's kind of like that, but it's also a little more complex. For example, the Bancor equations used for converting from one fractional currency to its reserve, which are simplified forms of our equations look like this:
```
to convert reserve to fractional:
fractionalCurrencyOut = (supply * (pow((reservein / reserve + 1.0), ratio) - 1))
or to convert fractional to reserve:
reserveCurrencyOut = reserve * (pow((fractionalin / supply + 1.0), (1 / ratio)) - 1)```
These equations are solved together for all transactions in a block and all transactions in each block get the same price in either direction. That means that a 1 million Verus reserve could be used in a coin with a 10 million Verus market cap, and if people convert to the coin or use it more than convert from it, it will go up, if it is sold, the price will go down, but all coins, even to the last coin can be sold for Verus through the equations. The depth of the order book is always the entire money supply on the sell side and reserve on the buy side.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Jun-19 08:52 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> When fractional reserve coins are emitted, the reserve ratio goes down. When they are officially burned, the reserve ratio goes up.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Jun-19 08:53 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the closer the reserve ratio is to 1:1, the less volatile the currency can be relative to Verus. the further from it, the more volatile and subject to market forces.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Jun-19 08:59 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you will be able to send Verus to reserve chains and to an address on that chain. As part of that send, you will be able to auto convert it to the native PBaaS currency or leave it as Verus tokens on the PBaaS chain and convert it when you want. You will be able to send Verus tokens without gas, because you can pay fees in Verus, which will convert automatically to the native currency. You can also convert any PBaaS reserve currency to Verus with these formulas and send it back to the Verus chain as well.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Jun-19 09:18 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> at first, we will be able to support Verus as the reserve currency. Eventually, I want to see it go hierarchical in Verus (reserve currencies launching reserves in their ecosystem) and to support external blockchains as well, which would mean Komodo's would be first, since they are our extended ecosystem and closest daemon to us. It will require non-trivial work to be able to do the same for Komodo currencies, but I believe that is possible sooner than any other blockchain system besides Verus. Most of the core concepts are there and the reserve system uses enhaned CCs, which would need to be ported,. The other thing is that all the pieces kind of fit together, and make the whole better with each part. For example, 50% PoS stake and non-equihash proof of power fits right into the model with merge mining support and staking of currency reserves being used to automatically purchase currencies and replenish notarization rewards without external payment. The new merge mining support and PoS security will require either VerusHash 2.0 or similar, or a double-sized block header, since the equihash space is re-purposed. It would be easiest if Komodo also had support for VerusHash 2.0, VerusPoP, but another approach could be just porting the enhanced CCs, adding the consensus changes, then integrating the merkle mountain range to improve/simplify Komodo's notarization and leverage Komodo notarization to create a reserve connector. Basically, there would be a fair bit of work and some consensus rule changes, but it can be done.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Jun-19 10:22 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> you mentioned some usecases like voting, poll, loyalty currency, liquid reserves and bancor style usecases.
I was thinking some possible use case... just trying to make sense if such use case will fit this type of blockchains which are create for specific purpose and retired/expred after use.

- I do understand the first use case of PBaaS is for example is like creating a blockchain for getting votes/polls and get results and once it solves it's purpose it gets delete/expired/archived etc.
- right now the limit is 15, but actually there can be no limit and there can by unlimited PBaaS independent blockchains made
- these PBaaS blockchains are not necessarily be just temporary but can be long term project usage too.

So, if above is correct I was thinking some other usecases.";"";"";

Right now, I'm trying to determine if there is an algebraic way to solve a very difficult equation, which will allow perfect efficiency with partial fills on limit orders that can be included in a block and by being partially filled, still meet their limit requirements. My default approach is a numerical iteration, which will be able to handle partial fills, but not get a perfect answer to fill them all the way up to the maximum satoshi. The formula to solve is exceedingly complex, so if you know of some exceptional algebraic gurus, please send them my way ;). I've even thought about a small, pre-trained neural net in C++, which should be able to get very close. I know how I'd do that, but it wouldn't be my first choice üòÉ";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Jun-19 10:28 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> since the blockchains are proof of some event occurred and authenticity of validity, these can be used for some interesting use cases, also in mix of IoT devices used in homes and small to medium businesses. Whenever I get some raw idea I just write them, no matter how crapy it might be, but could possibly be turn out good if worked out or may be not, so just throw it later.
so the other possible use cases could be like:
- a personal blog blockchain or some official portal for important announcements, like for governments or corporates or for any purposes. From serious or non-serious. Blogs and medium.com etc are all basically text/html, the blockchain has the bytes space to hold that data and ideally it is possible today to make such applications use case on almost any blockchain, but with PBaaS this can be automated and be managed as well.";"";"";

I do believe that some of those scenarios, especially blockchain government scenarios make more and more sense. Especially when you consider that the people staking and notarizing the chains could be citizens and earn money that would otherwise go to non-local companies to run and secure the systems. It also ties nicely into voting and registration, earning money by being involved in that process, etc.";"";"";
