Progress has being extremely good, V2 is quick and stable. Developer solved tons of critical issues. most other coins will just have gave up and move to a new project with the enhancement.
Why price low? Many Reasons. 
1. Main reason, is 51% attack that happen months months ago. Cryptopia never had good monitors in place and they notice it too late. I estimate over 100K+ coins were double spend based on the volume, that time ASIC machine just hit the market. Many coins was targeted, not only at Cryptopia but many exchanges. Lot exchanges disable wallet quickly and corrected the market.  This also happened with Cryptonote coins(example: AEON coin, wallet was offline 3 months at bittrex, now you need to wait 28hours for confirmation, price 1/4). This will not happen again since a lot of measures have been putted in place. Not bulletproof but a step forward. I still recommend we link the proof to a coin as stellar/ripple instead of KMD. 
2. TradeSatoshi is not as trusted as Cryptopia and volume are crappy. They have too many scam coins and there fees are high. Most users will just wait it out instead of moving funds to a this exchange.
3. Most users are getting it cheap and will not drive the price up. Why pay more for no reason.
4. Only one stable exchange, if we have 3 stable exchange, users will be using hush to transfer across exchanges. As soon Cryptopia is up, the volume will increase and price will not go below $0.1 again.

New exchanges: Lot coins stuck at Cryptopia and profit of trades are at the loss. When the market recovers, people will start donating trade profits and new exchanges will bloom.";"";"";
