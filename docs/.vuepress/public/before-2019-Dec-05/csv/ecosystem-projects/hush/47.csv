Snapshot height at BLOCK 500,000 (~April 14th 2019)

Funds from the current Hush chain will be snapshotted at block 500,000 and migrated to our new Sapling-enabled chain, based on Komodo. Shielded funds left in Sprout pool after block 500,000 WILL BE LOCKED on the old chain. We must manage the security of the entire coin supply with the funds of each holder.

""BTCH is not something that has ever existed before, it is not a chain split nor code fork of HUSH, 
nor ZEC, nor BTC, it is a KMD asset chain with imported UTXO dataset. 

BTCH takes the value from four different blockchains (HUSH, SUPERNET, DEX, BTC), and then dumps it onto a host chain Komodo (KMD). 
It does not fork from KMD, nor does it fork from BTC or HUSH. It is technically NOT A FORK, but a merged airdrop. """;"";"";

When the new Hush chain is created, only the address corresponding to ac_pubkey has the funds. The first 128 blocks are ""special"" with KMD asset chains, and somethings don't happen until there are 128 blocks. Everyone can participate in mining these first 128 blocks, but they will have 0 block reward. Consider it a ""bootstrapping"" period, where mining pools and other nodes can migrate, before real block rewards start";"";"";
