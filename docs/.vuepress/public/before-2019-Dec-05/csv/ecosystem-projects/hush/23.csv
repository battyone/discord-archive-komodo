High block rewards are path to (hyper)inflation and even  hybrid POW/POS mechanism can't prevent that. Cheap coins have ruined HUSH's market and they can ruin BTCH's too. Benefiting early miners may accelerate immediate trading, but it's long-term devestating. It's probably better way, a sustainable one, to go with lower block reward and longer halving periods. At some stage inflation shouldn't be higher as few % annualy.";"";"";
