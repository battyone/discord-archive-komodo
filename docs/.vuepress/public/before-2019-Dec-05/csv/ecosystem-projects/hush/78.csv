The 'Status' you mentioned lists:
`checking Zcash Counterfeiting Vulnerability 2/6/2019 MOD Donnie`
HUSH no longer uses that sprout chain.
It seems the ""confusion"" is already on your end.

Hi computergenie,
Regarding with this issue, please wait until our wallet department fix HUSH wallet and removed status message.
Thank you for your patience.
Kind regards,
