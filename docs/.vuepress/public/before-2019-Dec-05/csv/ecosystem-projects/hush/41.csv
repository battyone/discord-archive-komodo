He is doing the current n necessary work (thank you, Duke) regardless of lack of funds. Can he do all in future? No, but devs can build something on top of hush (like a program utilizing hushlist) and get fees that way. If you implement large additional fees on base layer, it's a bad idea. A small increase in transaction fees for all miners is a better idea (hope that trickles down to devs and hope the devs are mining).";"";"";

Sapling makes a simple operation ""send a hello message to Alice"" take a few seconds, when it takes 45 minutes on Sprout. Real-time-ish communication is not possible with Sprout.

lastly is to target bittrex and kraken

Hush got a lot of work needs to be done
- Critical the zcash vulnerability.(I sold out 75% hush until this is fix)
- Explorer
- Sapling
- A lot of upgrades and optimization required

There no road map since no dedicated dev, this is critical
1. Hush need to rebase with zcash code base to fix a lot of vulnerabilities and sapling upgrade. 
2 Hush need to introduce a 10% fee in mining block.
2. Hush needs 2 stable explorer.
3. Hush need to have 3 stable exchanges.
4. Notary needs integration with wallet.
