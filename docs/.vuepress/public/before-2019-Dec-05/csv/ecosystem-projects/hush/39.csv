Reason for Question: I am representing Resistance.io , ResDEX decentralized exchange scheduled for launch in coming months. Short tldr;  ResDEX uses instant atomic swaps (within 30 sec trades) for decentralized trading (using RES as collateral) and zk-Snarks for Privacy. TOR routing is natively supported on ResDEX.

RES coin itself is CPU mineable (uses reward splitting between POW & POR). We have a prototype available on https://respool.io (for our Proof of Research)

I have been following Komodo ecosystem projects and by extension came to know about Hush built using zk-Snarks.

As a privacy and decentralized exchange we would like to list HUSH on ResDEX exchange (free of charge). Our ultimate goal is to be 'One stop Exchange for all privacy coins'.

It would be wonderful if I can discuss it more with community & developers! Happy to answer any questions. 
Would love to know so I can get in touch with our developers and work on integrating HUSH on ResDEX exchange.";"";"";

However, this does not play the main role. The first thing to consider is the miner's psychology. The psychology of Asic miners is close to the psychology of FPGA miners. Thoughts of ASIC miners are such - to quickly get a lot of coins and sell, to recoup the investment in equipment, which in six months is easier to throw into the landfill, because every 3-4 months the market has several times more powerful ASICs than the previous ones. The logical result of the coins that did not change the algorithm is a deep drop in value. All because of the fact that ASIC miners are much less inclined to keep a coin for long-term than miners POS, CPU, GPU. Their task is to quickly recoup the investment, because most often ASIC miners are larger farmer owners. For example, ZElcash has 10 times more coins issued, and the cost is higher, and Votecoin who did not change the algorithm, which is as much as 15 in ZEL 20 times less. Here mentioned SUqa who turned to DUke for the implementation of DPOW. For example, they again announced a change in the algorithm in order to protect themselves from ASIC, because they understand that if they don’t make it, the price will be even lower, because the psychology of the ASIC miners is to sell, sell, sell. It even came to Zcash that it was necessary to do something, change the algorithm, they officially talked about it. Algorithms Progpow, MTP and others do not just appear. Unfortunately, many people disagree with my point of view, but my observations show that most of the coins that do not protect themselves from ASIC fall deeper than others in the price because they are mercilessly sold and lowered in price.";"";"";

But let""s move from theory to practice, because practice reflects reality. Take for example Monero, which is protected from ASIC with circulation of 17 million coins. Monero costs $ 46, take Zcash with circulation of less than 6 million coins. Zcash costs $ 46. For example, in the autumn of 2017, when there were no ASICs on equihash Zcash cost $ 200, reaching $ 400, Monero then cost $ 45. What do we see? Monero returned to its low, and Zcash broke through the bottom and fell deep down. And the main reason for this in my opinion is the large sales of ASIC miners, the fact that they, as well as POS, CPU, GPU, miners, keep their coins in the long run - a big mistake. If I""m in something wrong in comparing Zcash and Monero correct me.";"";"";

Three times! I remind you: Monero with 17 million coins costs the same as Zcash with 6 million. Based on yours logic, ASIC miners lowered the price three times stronger. I think Monero will solve this problem, as Verus does by equalizing the power of the CPU, GPU and FPGA. I want to convey to you one thought, it does not matter to me how the coin is mined - ASIC, FPGA, HDD, POS, Masternodes, GPU, CPU. It doesn""t matter. It is important for me as an investor, as a person who likes projects of the Komodo family, so that the value of coins does not fall rapidly down. If the transition to POS solves the problem of price stabilization, I’m for POS, if HDD mining will solve this problem, I’m for HDD. I am not writing this within the framework of a dispute which method is better or worse for coin mining. I am writing in order to convey to you the idea that ASIC / FPGA mining harms the project, since the psychology of ASIC / FPGA miners is to sell, sell, sell. And now you have shown me with a concrete example that ASIC mining hurts much more than secret FPGA, perhaps because it is impossible to produce as many FPGA miners as ASIC.";"";"";

Why are they not „worthless“? In my conclusion it’s not about the art of mining. It’s about how people use this Coins. Miners can be good and Stick with a Project, or just mine the best Coin (in $/day) and sell them";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-Feb-19 02:29 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> BTC does not have a team that can easily decide to change the algorithm. BTC is the main coin, the basis of everything, the popularity of BTC is so great that the method of mining coins has a secondary value in pricing. That is why BTC has not fallen so deeply in value as other projects. If we consider LTC - in my opinion, the coin has fallen very deeply in value. As for the ASIC miner on LTC L3 + - today this miner does not produce almost anything. Those who did not have time to buy this miner in the first wave of sales, very much regretted it. Spending money, they could not recoup the investment (buyers of the second, third, fourth wave)";"";"";

But I do not believe that the main reason for the value of the coin is the bear market. The main problem in the main holders of the coin - they ruthlessly sell it and deeply reduce the cost";"";"";

I know some People here do the same. And yes, we have also Miners who sell directly anything. They mine a Coin cause of their profit/day";"";"";
