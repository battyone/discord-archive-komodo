As a result, instead of 100 miners, we have 10 miners. Instead of 100 members of the community - 10 members who are much more interested in selling more mined coins than 100 members with fewer each";"";"";

The difference is reduced every week. It seems this is due to the fact that ASICS hashrate is growing much faster than the GPU. It is still necessary to take into account that in many countries, ASIC cannot be purchased from the site and it is necessary to use the services of intermediaries.
If you add the intermediary mark-up, the price / production difference in $ is even smaller.";"";"";
