First off, miners can only influence the sell side and compared to the overall marketcap, daily mining is a small percentage. The buyers are the buyers, do you know that XMR and ZEC has the identical amount of buy support? 

what if XMR had 10x the buy support of ZEC? then ZEC outperformed relative to what it should have.

A most fatal flaw with your coin price ""analysis"" is that it ignores total coins. This is a large error. Right now XMR has 16 million coins with about 2200 coins per day mined. ZEC has over 7000 coins per day. So XMR has less than one third the new coins against 3x the supply. No wonder ZEC price dropped more during a bear market.";"";"";

With a price of only 67 dollars. The coin is mined exclusively by ASIC miners. Then it turns out your theory is attracted to a specific answer and does not apply to many other similar coins. We mention the comparison of Zelcash and Hush. The time of block extraction is similar to Hush, despite the fact that there are 150 coins in the Zel block! and the number exceeds almost 10 times. I can give an infinite number of such examples. I do not claim that ASIC miners are the only reason for the fall in coin value, but I argue that this is the main reason. And such projects as Monero, Zcoin do protection against ASIC not because they are big fans of GPU miners, but because they understand that this is a larger community and less prone to such sales of coins. As I said earlier, I, as an investor and supporter of projects of the Komodo family, are very worried about such a deep drop in the cost of Hush, having sufficient experience in real-world communication with ASIC miners, reading various ASIC miners communities, and I learned this experience from ASIC miners. I don""t care how the ASIC / CPU / GPU coin will be mined.

100% in the world of cryptocurrency can not say anything. Everything is constantly changing, there are new factors and so on. But as I wrote about this above, I have experience in dealing with miners of ASIC and GPU, I read a lot of various forums of miners, listened to their opinions and thoughts. Is it possible to argue that there is no difference in the psychology of behavior of the two types of miners when one of the miners has a service life of 6 months and the other a few years? Can their behavior be similar? Definitely not. James (I hope you do not mind if I call you by name) you are a well-known person in the cryptocurrency world, you have a lot of experience and knowledge in the field of blockchain and cryptocurrency. I am very glad that there are people like you from whom we can learn a lot. But please answer me two questions:
The first question: Such projects as Monero, Zcoin, Bitcoin Gold, Ethereum and many others consistently adhere to the opinion of the protection of the algorithm from ASIC, change the algorithms and defend the point of view of security from ASIC. Question: Why do they do that? Why often declare commitment to GPU mining? Options:

1) They are wrong like me and do not understand the essence?
2) Are they populists and thus want to attract more people?
3) Are they GPU fans?
4) Another reason.

Second question: You know people like Alex Biryukov and Dmitry Khovratovich - the creators of the Equihash algorithm that Komodo runs on. According to Wikipedia: They created this algorithm specifically as protection against ASICs. Now these two people have created a new MTP algorithm, which, as I understand it, equalizes the capabilities of all types of miners, while remaining profitable for the GPU miners.
