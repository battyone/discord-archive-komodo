This compressed public key corresponds to the same private key, meaning it is generated from the same private key. However, it looks different from the uncompressed public key. More importantly, if we convert this compressed public key to a bitcoin address using the double-hash function (RIPEMD160(SHA256(K))) it will produce a different bitcoin address. This can be confusing, because it means that a single private key can produce a public key expressed in two different formats (compressed and uncompressed) that produce two different bitcoin addresses. However, the private key is identical for both bitcoin addresses.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Mar-19 12:04 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> @dukeleto There you have a bit of examplantion of compressed, uncompressed with examples:

private key a8db568957aab4d708fa1cde6b3c19c14674d5ffe283REDACTEDREDACTEDREDA

So from one private key we can obtain 2 public keys (compressed and uncompressed format). Those result in different address.
When a payment is made to an address the public key is not known only the address. Public key is revealed only when an address is used for spending. 
So prior that we do not know if an address is belonging to uncompressed or compressed public key. The assumption that is being used is that it is compressed as of todays standards.

An example of transaction: https://explorer.hush.zelcore.io/tx/4950305a39c74e8a55b1180d849751596692e01f14bdab7c33b614027aef7872
In this transaction an address which comes from uncompressed public key is sending to an address derived from compressed public key. Note that BOTH of these addresse belong to the SAME private key.
But the WIF format of the private key is different. The WIF format is different so wallets/core can distinguish if the public part is compressed or uncompressed and choose a correct signing method.
-> Only 1 private key is needed to unlock and spend utxos from both addresses but a specification of compression has to be used to correctly sign transaction.";"";"";

Here our address coming from compressed public key pays to address belonging to uncompressed public key. Note that the same private key is used for signing.
-> 1 private key rules 2 different addresses

-> the type is always pay to public key hash.  p2pkh

I guess it is kind of a combination of both. If I recall correctly the bitcore extension implementation in hush, zcash, komodo whatever does not count with public keys and only checks if its p2pkh or p2psh. So imo it needs to be corrected in the port of Bitcore to daemon as well";"";"";
