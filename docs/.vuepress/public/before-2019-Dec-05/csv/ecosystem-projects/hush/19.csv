Trade volume on cryptopia doesnt mean anything to me. Have you tried to trade hush? Have you seen the chart? There has been no liquidity on the buy side (except for a 2 day pump) since the top. 

If you're going to refer to the trade volume as a way to say this coin is not dead, might as well look at the chart which shows price as well. And you can see from the chart, we are dead on that front (trading), too. Whoever sold the top hasn't come back in- at all. There is no real trading going on. Once it broke long term support, trading died.";"";"";
