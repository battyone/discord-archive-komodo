It's very nice to see the development you're currently making within Hush (specially against the 51% network attack), however, I'm really curious to know. Why are you so against the ASIC-resistant algo? I seriously think that Hush should get anti-ASIC as it could help its ever-falling price by making it less profitable for miners (right now, whenever hush gets a +10% increase in value, all those robotic-ASICs turn to mining Hush instead of Zen/Zcl/Zec and market dump a whole lot of hush.";"";"";

Can this notarization be used to issue art assets/digital collectibles that can be traded on the DEX? (2)
question 51% can be solved easily if you use not 1 algorithm and several tied to the mining devices so the attack will be not at all scary if the coin analog will be on another algorithm (completely copying the file of the main media), attacking 51% + attack =0 if there is a file restoration which would work as a backup\restoration . make more gcd on more algorithms. I'm from Russia and use Google translator so sorry for the mistakes)
How much hash required to 51 percent attack hush?
Do I have to do anything with HUSH?
What is the advantage of BTCH vs HUSH now that Hush is KMD notarized?
