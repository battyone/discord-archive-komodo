There exist some un-released GPU miners for VerusHash, but they perform worse that CPU miners, and are not compatible with using risers and you cannot CPU+GPU mine at the same time.

The process of buying a z9, the cost, the international customs and taxes, .... , it's not something the masses have access to. CPU mining with VerusHash just seems a lot more ""fair"", in the sense that everybody has to use the same hardware. You can't buy hw that is exponentially better than the average person can.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"31-Aug-18 04:12 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't have any timelines. It's not going to be tomorrow or next week, I can tell you that. The lead dev of Veruscoin is working on submitting a PR to Komodo that adds VerusHash, when that happens, we will be able to create the new chain. We also need to allow some time to tell the community when the hardfork is, i.e. a specific block height, and give our exchanges some notice for them to update";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"31-Aug-18 04:17 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: BTCH will become a CPU-friendly coin (same algo as VRSC), and also ~50% of block reward will go to those staking BTCH in their full node. It will continue to have 51% attack protection from KMD, and the new fork will be able to do cryptoconditions (smart contracts). BTCH will not be profitable to mine on GPUs or ASICs for a long time, if ever";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"31-Aug-18 04:19 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think the reason we see BTCH price climbing is that people rightly realize that BTCH will become something like a bond, where it pays out X% via staking rewards, based on how much you are staking and the total amount being staked on the network at that time. This same thing happened in the VRSC community very early on, but they had almost no circulating supply so the market dynamics won't be exactly the same.";"";"";

For me, it is surprising to this day that Komodo with such technologies is so inexpensive, an excellent investment.
When that ethereum was cheap. Thank you for answers.";"";"";

I‚Äôve been researching crypto for some time now, and am learning Linux. My background is graphics and reiki. I do not think that being ‚ÄòASIC resistant‚Äô supports ‚Äòdecentalization‚Äô because some central company somewhere created a device to do a certain thing. GPUs, cpus, any unit has to be created, therefore materials and labor must be combined to produce a certain outcome. Is nature open source? Perhaps in knowledge or sensory data, yet the physical boundaries are finite. In this respect energy cannot be taken that does not exist. The 50-60 cycle hz that most of our electricity in the cities run, lose power over distance and do not allow effective charge compression. 
I believe that my money really is in jimmies house, and Eric‚Äôs, Rubin is investing with it , and Mira is pay for her college tuition with it. I did not come into this world alone, or have I learned much from only reflection, because we are here together, as a result of everything we have seen heard and experienced. That‚Äôs why I like block chain and crypto.
Much love";"";"";
