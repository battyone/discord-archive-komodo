But the real issue is that we relied on Cryptopia for 95%+ of our liquidity. This single point of failiure from a central exchange has now caused us months of ongoing issues. It is up to Cryptopia to open up Hush Markets again- we can only do so much & hope that they do";"";"";

It is sometimes hard to remember that Hush is a 100% block reward coin. It is a miners coin. There is no founders fee or block reward that pays the team for their work OR exchange listings- @dukeleto has just been kind enough to do it all for free. Its something that 99% of the people in this discord to either forget or dont realize.";"";"";
