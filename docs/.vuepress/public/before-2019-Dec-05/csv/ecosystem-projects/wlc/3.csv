I'm arguing because your comparisons are off. Just because travelling to the space, or deep-sea diving was not doable in the past, it is now doable, doesn't imply that time travelling will be possible in the future (btw this is what people call ""hasty generalization"", or ""over-extension"", a type of informal fallacy).
