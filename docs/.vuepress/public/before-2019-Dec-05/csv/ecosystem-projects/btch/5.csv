As future directions of coin are unclear I consider it as high risk investment. Possible high reward one, but also high risk. I am also buying, but it will be a long way before the final destination. The main argument why team has to do something with the coin? They are holding a big bag (150k coins of dev funds) which should be around 10% (+/- 5%) of realistic circulating supply. At one stage they will have to unload them, so it should motivate a team to do something with that bag.";"";"";

I would imagine they don't follow the progress of unknown forks. People come and go, it's possible they have other people in charge now compared to january/february 2018.
