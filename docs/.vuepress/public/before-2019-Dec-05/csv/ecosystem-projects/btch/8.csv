After numerous random and non-random transactions is balance still in 8-decimals range. However, on a very rare cases problem can be seen at Àùtotal unconfirmedÀù. I assume it happens when trying to send from the  address A to address B at least 2 transactions within a few seconds (before the first transaction is ÀùconfirmedÀù). It at least happen when sending different amounts and different tax fees. We are speaking about very rare cases. When transactions are confirmed, is Àùtotal confirmedÀù in 8 decimals.";"";"";
