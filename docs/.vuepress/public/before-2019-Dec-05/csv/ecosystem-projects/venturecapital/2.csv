Especially in early phases of projects, there is sometime a bit of a chicken and egg problem when it comes to funding. That is where ‚ÄúConditional Automatic Funding‚Äù (CAF) could kick in. Investors put some money on the table and verifiable objectives are set. The project automatically gets the money if it delivers, otherwise investors automatically get their money back.

Investors derisk their investment while scooping project earlier. The project boosts its credibility, feel secure and focus on what‚Äôs matter: delivering. It could be used for ‚Äúclassic‚Äù startup funding (e.g. with SAFE) or for crypto projects.

Seems to me (a non tech guy) a MVP based on Komodo, would be relatively ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to develop, possibly with a centralized oracle at first (like EY or PWC).

This would also get early stage projects and investors to connect with the Komodo ecosystem: that could make a lot of sense on a marketing perspective.";"";"";
