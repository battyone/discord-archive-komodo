Good luck!    Your buyback model is fantastic.   

Do you think this could be adopted for other companies trying to raise funds that eventually want to become self managed and sustained?   

Let's say for example, I want to raise 10 Million in funds to invest in loans.  
As the loans payback, the buyback fund will increase through the interest earnings and investors can withdraw their original investments through the buyback fund allocation.    Hopefully to the point where the company holds all the original assets/funds.  

Is this the goal for Peer2?";"";"";
