For some background of why I'm asking, I'm a contributor on a few servers, a couple of which are sizable.  I run a daily newsletter publish and I've received a lot of questions about KMD tech when I was posting news information about kmdplatform these last 2 quarters (especially as I was covering the dICO releases).  My subjective take away is that there is substantial interest in the project, however the technical density doesn't translate well.

I can only imagine that the size of the system in a project like this only deepens the complexity.  Which also makes sense, as that result is what I have experienced.  It's reflected in both my own understanding coming into this project and starting research on it, and that of many other people that who have asked me questions about it after reading recent news exerts.   

I'd imagine the lack of 'digestibility' is what has even kept me away for a while, as KMD isn't a new name in the space.  It's just well known as 'complicated'. lol";"";"";
