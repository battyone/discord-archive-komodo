I will be doing a short interview with @ùïÉùï†ùï†ùïãùï´ for Crypto Core Media, tomorrow at 0000 UTC time on the 28th of July. (in about 18hours). I'd love your feedback for any important points you think I should discuss. The idea will be to provide a general, not to technical, overview of the project at the current stage. I will plan to talk a bit about the history of the project up until now, what is currently being worked on and what the future looks like for CHIPS. Feel free to DM me with any points, or feedback afterwards. 

You can listen live at https://ccmedia.airtime.pro/ and we will post links of the recording afterwards. :CHIPS:";"";"";

There must be some other folks who migrated their coins to Verus Agama in June and have the same problem. Not sure what to do to free the coins. I never would have sent them in to the Verus Agama if I knew they would be trapped there, but people were saying it was safe at the time.";"";"";

Usually, I convert the seed to a WIF (privatekey) that I import into the coin daemon. To convert the seed to the CHIPS WIF, I use Decker's tool (I note down the address and the WIF):
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/notary/generate-privkeys-third-party-coins-from-passphrase.html#install-dependencies
Then when you have the private key (WIF) you can import it:
```chips-cli importprivkey XXXXX```";"";"";
