I think we might rapidly accelerate to parity, it's the logical value for PIRATE, can't think of a scenario where kmd survives and not PIRATE, or vice versa, so if PIRATE is the ultimate store of value, and we all agree an unofficial peg with kmd is an advantage, then the most likely outcome is parity, and could happen quickly.";"";"";

I can imagine the early comers dumping at a cheaper level and not many people need the anonymity of pirate nor buying it. I’d say 50% of kmd investors don’t even know what kmd does 😂😂";"";"";

"288941564263268353";"Don King#8901";"26-Sep-18 07:50 AM";"Market price is partly psychological,  and a parity peg makes PIRATE an unambiguously good store of value, so if we all start to expect parity it will happen. Goòd news for kmd is same for PIRATE , and so too for bad news , PIRATE and kmd are connected now, so an unofficial peg eventually is logical, and parity would provide a stable store of value.";"";"";

"288941564263268353";"Don King#8901";"26-Sep-18 07:54 AM";"PIRATE definitely adds HUGE ultility to the whole komodo ecosystem, so I think more likely PIRATE rises up to meet kmd at approx current price";"";"";
