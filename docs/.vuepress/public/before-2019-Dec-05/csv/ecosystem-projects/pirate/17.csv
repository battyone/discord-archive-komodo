PIRATE Airdrop
--------------
We will be airdropping 250,000 PIRATE to people who missed out on early mining.
There is now a public pool with working payouts to Z-address, if you want to mine it easily thanks to Webworker01: https://pirate.komodostats.com
To qualify for the air drop all you need to do is supply a Z-address in this BCT ANN.
The airdrop will happen on: 19th of September 2018 cut off for supplying Z address is the day before 18th September at 0 UTC, any Z-address submitted after this time will not be included in the airdrop. The PIRATE will be divided evenly over the address's supplied. If 250,000 people apply you will each get 1.
Any accounts made after 1st September 2018 will not be included in the airdrop!```";"";"";

Pirate took on a life of its own thanks to the hard work and skills of those contributing.

Here's what I saw:

-  @Deleted User  came up with a 'why didn't I think of that' idea (Z-only chain)
-  People want to experiment with the idea and test it
-  This idea move from #private-staked   (open-to-all discord channel)
-  No way, apart from OTC, to out funds
-  Interesting idea shared outside, and to this new, open to anyone, discord ( #pirate  ) channel
-  Suggestion to call it experimental so people don't loose time, money or resources by investing the same with no way out
-  A way to do t-transaction is found (?)
-  People with new asics to play with test them out
-  Satinder and others offer to and buy coins for KMD
-  People start suggesting to promote the chain and make it something more that than an experiment
-  Community is interested
-  People not participating in this open-to-all channel complain (I didn't read any of this so just inference)
-  Mining pool built
-  Satinder offers to give up his PIRATE that he purchased from his own KMD
-  People in this community come up with ideas to rectify bad feelings and find a proper and fair course of action

There are probably things I have forgotten or messed up in the above (feel free to add), but for anyone who cares to, everything is in the üëÜ  channel above and can be found originating in #ask-jl777 .  Check it out.

I've got to say, you guys in this community are pretty fucking awesome.   That will be clear to anyone who bothers to look into this.

For those who don't, well, you are really missing out.

@grewalsatinder  You have had a great idea and acted upon it.  Much respect üí™   Please keep up the great work.  And enjoy your day!!";"";"";
