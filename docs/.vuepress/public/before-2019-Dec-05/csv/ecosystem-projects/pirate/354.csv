We benefit from Komodo in many ways.   Dev costs and times are exponentially reduced in many cases.  Most recently, the Verus coin project implemented Sapling and has given their work to Komodo.   Now Komodo is integrating the activation date for 12/15 and after that, asset chains can adopt the new changes.   So pirate will adopt the initial sapling integration.";"";"";
