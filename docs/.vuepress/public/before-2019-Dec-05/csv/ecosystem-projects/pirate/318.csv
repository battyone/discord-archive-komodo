It's ""functional"" and that's what mattered to start.   I have a web dev who would probably cost an arm and a leg to hire alone, making a very secure site.  We just put a simple page up and it needs a lot of work still yes.   I can't really argue with this and there are no excuses, just reasons.  My challenges are funding and time.   We should be able to buckle down and have it done in the next week or so.  
One of the challenges was art for the site which we received last week.   Will get the rest of the words and explanatory stuff up shortly.  Thank you for bringing attention to it.  

We would need to SEO into the search Piratecoin - but we haven't.   We don't use that term or phrase.   There is already a ""piratecoin"" someone tried to make years ago and it died.

CMC can't be supported without supporting exchanges.   I have tried to facilitate getting Digital Price on to Coin Market Cap to no avail.  I even tried to get it done withthe Onboarding API... no luck.

Team page in the works.   It's a lot more complex than it seems, especially with a truly decentralized project. 

KMD devs absolutely understand what they made.  The fifth message from JL to me when we started talking was *""arguably the most private combined with most secure""* 

""Probably is only about marketing, user friendly and time"" - Yep... pretty much.   There has been no shortage of growth and interest in the project.";"";"üíØ (10)";

I see you have already noticed many of the problems i pointed out. I agree about CMC, we can't get it right now. Lottery is nice , referrals too, but probably i would do it later. Priority, considering that developing is almost completed, is site and seo. First because site and wp are the appearance of the project, you need at least a bit of appeal. I'm sorry to say but if i watch the site now i think is a ponzi mining coin. The seo, cause to find the site i need 5 min, join discord, go to pin message, click and refresh till site opens.... Another consideration, is sad the team doesn't have many funds, this will slow down the process. Any solution? This is the sad side of no premine";"";"";

the term seo is a bit of misleading last couple of years already. sure there are some 'must have' technical things that are seo specific, but we really need to take a more holistic 'big picture' view. 

firstly regarding content. the way to get better discoverability/positions is using to 'long tail' approach. that means having a lot of good content on the actual pirate.black website. otherwise a lot of good links (google link juice) point to other sources. at the moment that is medium. all these comparison articles (xmr vs arrr, xvg vs arrr etc) are pure gold in terms of having good content with just the right search phrases people look for.

of course some 'main' keywords like 'pirate coin', 'privacy crypto' and some others deserve extra attention, but there is no point stopping there.

secondly. as there are no universal google result positions anymore (it depends on user location, language settings, device type, previous search history etc) it is all about 'USER TASK ACCOMPLISHMENT'
of course different users want different things, but it is not too complicated to start with the most obvious ones:
- info about the coin (max and current supply, block time, mining algo, stuff like that)
- info about wallet(s)
- info for potential miners
- info about exchanges
- some people want the comparisons with other privacy coins
-etc

the tricky thing is how to divide this info onto different pages as the popular 'one-pager' solution favoured by so many crypto projects is terrible idea from digital marketing / seo / usability standpoint";"";"üíØ (3),üêô (1),rum (6)";
