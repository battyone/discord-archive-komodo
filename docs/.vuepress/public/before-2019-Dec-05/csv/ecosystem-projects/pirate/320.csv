But understand that the majority of the adoption and value of crypto today doesn't come from actual usage. Its from SPECULATION. You, me, everyone here is speculating on a future price increase. Everyone in crypto is. But why do people speculate? Because they believe in future adoption and future real utility which comes features like SPV, and payment integrations, etc., but ultimately comes down to the tech. These other lower tier privacy shitcoins can have as many exchange listing and merchant support as they want, but noone gives a shit because they have no real utility/privacy edge over Monero or Zcash.
