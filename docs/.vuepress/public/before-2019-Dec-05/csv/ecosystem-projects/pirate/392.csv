You could use the CEX way: deposit onto your local blockchain (available on all local devices), let the customer use that and when he leaves withdraw the remaining balance (or leave it for the next visit).
All you need to do then is create an easy-access system (chipcard, RFID-chip or something similar) for easy use on the premesis.";"";"";
