The more pools there are, the more likely a single pool failing won't cause huge fluctuations in the total net hash and block rate. The  more pools that run different software, teh less likely the network is affected by a single common bug. There is greater security  with fewer pools as large amounts of hash could not be used by a ""bad actor"". As jl777c said, no single mining source over 50%, but the best security would be if getting any large majority of hash power to one instance was increasingly difficult.  Having more solo miners increses the chance that altered software is not being mined to.  As of today, the owner of pirate.komodostats.com could direct the majority of  PIRATES hash rate however they plese";"";"";
