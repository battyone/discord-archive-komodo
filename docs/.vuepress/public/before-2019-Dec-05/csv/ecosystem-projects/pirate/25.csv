I am more of an investor than a miner and I am willing to take a small loss now to maximize the amount of PIRATE in my wallet later.

I already have my GTX 1060 and mostly use it for streaming. Mining part time seems like a good way to get some extra PIRATE.

I am basically only paying for the wear and tear on the card and since I didn't buy it for this purpose, I don't consider it an up front cost.

I am expecting PIRATE to be worth much more a year or two from now and make up for the extra electricity costs. However, some clocking changes may help.";"";"";
