Key Takeaways
‚Ä¢ We estimate the amount of cryptoasset market 
value needed to support economic activities to 
expand from ~$500B next year to $3.6T in 2028
‚Ä¢ 90%+ of cryptoasset value will be derived from 
penetration of offshore deposits in the next decade
‚Ä¢ Currency and Privacy networks will be the largest 
beneficiaries, as most fundamental value will stem 
from store of value use cases
‚Ä¢ Upside (5-yr) In BTC ($96k), XMR ($18k)

PIRATE is better privacy than monero, so it's perfect for offshore alternative market, which as Satis group analysts say, is where much of crypto upside will come from. The whole valuation report is worth reading too
