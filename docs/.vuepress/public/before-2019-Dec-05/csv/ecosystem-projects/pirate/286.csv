But of course in the real use case, you're absolutely correct, i understand it now.
If most of the supply is freezed by every holders/miners and they accord on one price (what i was calling kind of a cartels). Price will inevitably rise, that's the law of market because ""manipulation"" or ""strategy"", and supply/demand are then obsolete to dictate the price. And that's what you're trying to do when you say ""dumpers b' dumping and stupid people selling at 0,1KMD"" you want people to agree on a in your opinion fair price (that's legit -> more benefice). But that wouldn't be what i call a ""fair"" price.
