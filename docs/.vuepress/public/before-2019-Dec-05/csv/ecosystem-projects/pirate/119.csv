As much as Alright wants to complain about his lost coins, the reality is that he missed the launch of the real PIRATE chain with dPoW and on that day, it was still selling for mere fraction of what it is now. This shows the value of dPoW that it can make a chain only good for testing into one that can compete with XMR. Curiously, with the current hashrate, the dPoW protection is likely never going to be invoked as it will cost so much, but it wouldnt have been able to bootstrap itself to this level as it was in a state where Alright could (and did) reorg many blocks to his chain. Also, long before dPoW was added, satinder removed all the ""test chain"" language from BCT, combined with the airdrop that now has a value of about $100,000 I think it is fair to say that all things considered PIRATE was fairly launched";"";"";
