Most people don't worry too much about giving away their personal information online. Neither do they worry about financial privacy.

But money *talks*.

Imagine that someone has access to your financial transactions. Now they know *everything* about you.

They know what you buy, and where you go. They know who you spend your time with. [E.g. visual: two people meeting and paying for coffee]

They know your medical history, your family situation, how much debt you have, maybe your political affiliations, fines and any criminal record.

It's a goldmine for scammers. But it doesn't matter if you don't have any skeletons to hide, or even if they're not hostile. That information can still be used against you.

Perhaps you don't get a new job because you bought too many drinks in the last year, or migraine medication once too often. Or you're passed over for a promotion because your boss sees from the new baby kit that your priorities are about to shift. 

Maybe you're targeted with aggressive advertising for particular goods and services, or a hotel charges more for a reservation, simply because you can afford it.

Or maybe you just realise that knowledge is power, and when all your personal data is routinely monetised anyway, financial data is valuable enough to keep to yourself.

Realizing I havent been clearly sharing thoughts for a bit here. and fishy and I only have talked a bit in private.  So here is all of it. =D
I set up wordpress on my site to work with the KMD plugin, to use for now and start a Pirate Goods Store. (and do the KMD guide)

I can personally produce AND do fulfillment , however sometimes having internationally split merch is a good idea for fulfillment. Only if the end result is to just get merch in hands. I have a bad taste in my mouth for print on demand companies between quality and profit margins. 
I think some team work and my vast industry knowledge here can get a a good fulfillment system going that gives the project a good return. 

POD will get you like $2  total profit on a $24 shirt, where as I have better control  over that by producing things myself and knowing where to 3rd party order from.   As an example I'd like to charge either $20 and send $8-$10 to pirate. I'd also like to have a super budget shirt thats a suggested donation  and not exact amount. 

 Wordpress has affiliate  plugins I believe. 

I wanted to do QR Codes on pinback buttons that were free with and items I can ship, this gives people the option to have the QR code on them OR not.... 
@Syndicate.David#3850  has a really good embroidery guy in vegas we were going to get some quotes off of.  Whatever the best option is for embroidered hats we can go with, I do have 2 other sources but would rather go with a crypto person. 


Here are the items  I wanted to produce, in  intended order of release:
Pirate Shirt 1 - picked by community (printed by me)
Pirate Shirt 2 - Design i come up with (printed by me)
Pinback button set (also made by me)
Pirate Hats - ( Either by Mike D in Vegas OR Very Industrious Dudes)
Enamel Pin for Pirate (I have a GREAT source)
Enamel Pin for KMD (I have a GREAT source)
Stickers (fishy knows a guy but I can also make them)";"";"üëÜ (1)";
"364083722154278923";"Cryptofist#7504";"29-Nov-18 12:42 PM";"other item ideas
Hoodies if enough interest (I can print, can only make a few up front)
**BEANIES** ( undecided, screen printed by me or embroidered, preferred is embroidered usually)
Crypto posters, fine art screen printed ones. =D
Keychain bottle openers with logos or qr codes (thought of making one off personal ones, with wallet qr code for people if time allows)
