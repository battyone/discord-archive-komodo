And that's how the cycle happens each and every day.

Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky!

It's all here because of poo and now I'll tell you why -

Grass is eaten by the cattle

Which is eaten by women and men;

Defuses with their bodies, and becomes poo again.

And that poo goes through the sewer

which is dumped into the sea

and it's eaten by the plankton which becomes the fishes' meal.

And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside;

Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive

By a grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand

So that it can spring to life and become food for the land!

It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe.""
