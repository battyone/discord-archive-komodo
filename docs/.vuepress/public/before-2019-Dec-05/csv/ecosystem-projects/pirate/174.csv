Ease of onboarding is critical for adopting new users.  
Think of trying to board a ship tied to a dock.... vs. catching a swim ladder while the boat is sailing by at 5 knots.
Monero pushed a gui update for all users, which had multiple issues and neccesary workarounds for all of their users to be able to launch.   
We want to be able to capture new Pirate users with our ease of use by having our gangplank down while docked vs. having to take a 4 hour CLI class to send your money and catch that swim ladder as the boat goes sailing by.";"";"";
