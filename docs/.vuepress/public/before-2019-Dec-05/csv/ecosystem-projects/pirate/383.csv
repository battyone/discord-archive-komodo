Because they can.
`Unless you became a fan of KYC and CB suddenly...`
You're confusing my correction of your understanding of banking and ownership with something that it is not.
`I say we kick them out of here like they mistreat anyone who raises a valid concern.`
imo, 3rd party transactions shouldn't be a ""team"" concern
I may be outweighed on this topic, but I feel (and always will) that the project has a duty to ""warn"" of ""known"" things (which I believe has been more than done in the case of CB), but to censure individuals for the practice of the enterprise is above and beyond (otherwise I'd have issue with a ton of Komodo folks over the revenue-centric direction of KomodoPlatform üòõ )";"";"";
