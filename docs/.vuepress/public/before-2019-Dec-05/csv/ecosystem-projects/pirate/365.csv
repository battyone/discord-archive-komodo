Once again, the time has come to call for all hands on deck! We're looking to raise coin for  new exchange listings.  Starting with a * top 100* exchange with just over $6.5 Million daily adjusted USD volume. 

That exchange is Mercatox and is currently #68 on CMC
The listing fee is 3.0 BTC for the BTC trading pair,
3.5 BTC for BTC.+ ETH trading pairs.

There is currently 0.75 in hand to go toward the listing from the previous fund raising for Crex24. Thank you again to those donors, it's giving us a wonderful start towards this goal and opportunity.

We specifically would like to raise BTC and KMD (liquidity) and you can send your donations to the following addresses. 

Mercatox Fee Donation KMD 
 RTGzrgjXtZMgmqfvMYRiDSmn5ZT6XWVjuc 

Mercatox Fee Donation BTC: 
 3KSTg53WurhFUYTKVDstxCUfqzrRQ84i22 


Treasure  Benefits of listing with Mercatox
Liquidity + New Users
A much needed Exchange API for Plugins + Bots
Closer to CMC listing
Another Milestone as a project (maturity), important for the top 20 exchanges to see. 

Treasure Additional Funds
As before any additional funds that are raised will  go to the next exchange listing.  We also have the chance to list with Crypto-bridge for 2.5 BTC after Mercatox.

1. Nope, if you have a sapling (Zs) address, you're fine. If you had a zC address, you'd have to migrate. 
2. There is an otc channel over at the official pirate discord, also on the exchange.
3. It currently is, they were the first exchange to implement z-only transactions, which is a big deal. Many other exchanges refused to do it, or did not have the expertise to.
