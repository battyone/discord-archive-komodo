"202999072519356416";"NutellaLicka#4241";"28-Nov-18 10:46 PM";"No I mean for Pirate. In Pirate you still have the ability to have a transparent address, you're just unable to send funds to anything but a Z address (no T -> T). Pools require a Taddr as coinbase is paid out in it. You can easily use CLI to do it, I am just asking for a friend as they're using windows and require a Taddr. Since Agama has updated, they took the option out for Pirate. I was asking if there were still ways to get one in Agama.";"";"";

The pool software then shields these amounts in order to pay out to members who point their hash at the pool.";"";"";
