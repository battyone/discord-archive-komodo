With our AXOCoin we can expand into many other markets in Mexico in the future.   Next year we will be getting our Mexican FINCEN license where we can issue our own debit card, among  other things.   Until Mexico liberalizes its foreign exchange regulations the exchange and its Peso Gateway has to operate exclusively within Mexico.  Today a Mexican resident can only have a bank account in Mexican Pesos.  That is why we set up AXOBIT SAPI DE CV as the Mexican legal entity to develop the cryptocurrency market in Mexico.   About half of Mexico's population lives without a bank account which makes for a very fertile market.  Also, those people do not trust banks very much.  There is a lot of interest in cryptocurrencies in Mexico, that is why we got about 8,000 followers on Facebook in just a couple of weeks.  AXOBIT SAPI will be able to expand into several Latin American markets with relative ease downstream.  However, since Mexico is a ""silo"" we have also set up AXO LLC, a legal entity in Wyoming to access the US Dollar market.  AXO LLC is currently developing a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) product to track things from origin  to kitchen in the food sector since it is a ""low hanging fruit"".  This will be done  with RFID and CC Smart Contract Oracle technology .  You may have heard about Walmarts experience where they were able to reduce the time it took them track where their avocados were in their supply chain from 6 days to just a few seconds.  This was done with IBM and HyperLedger Fabric which is a private distributed ledger integrated with a private blockchain that is very, very expensive.  AXO LLC is in negotiation with a NASDAQ company to provide location signals to our Oracle that will be orders of magnitude cheaper and better than the IBM product. HyperLedger recently added ETH with a wrapper to allow EC-20 contracts.";"";"üíØ (2),üëç (1),Komodo (1)";

Our solution will be a wrapper that works with HyperLedger so we can have private channels that restrict who can see the information to just those parties that are entitled to see it.  Since ETH has limited scalability we will prevail.  Our NASDAQ partner is very impressed with the 30,000 tx per second capability we have now.üòÄ";"";"";

After looking at Hyperledger Fabric we found that it is a partial clone of Etherium with all of the ETH drawbacks that we completely avoid here in the KMD ecosystem. Concurrently, we found Corda which provides private channels of communication where only those that have a need to know and are certified to know the private information in their own trading or financial group.  Others on the blockchain will be completely oblivious to the private information in other channels.  This capability opens the market to the commerce of the world.üòÄ";"";"";

Naturally we choose our AXO to be the native currency together with the stable coins  we will issue for specific channels backed with 1:1 bank deposits  to transfer value from sellers to buyers.  Integration is supposed to be easy.  The documentation indicates that all we need to do is have the AXO notary and the Corda notary nodes mutually recognize the signatures of the other.  Not sure who can help us with this.  It might be something @jl777c wants to look at since the AXO notaries are also the Komodo notaries.  This will move to our front burner early next year.";"";"";
