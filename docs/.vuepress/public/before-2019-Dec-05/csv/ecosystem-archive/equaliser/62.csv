"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"09-Jul-18 12:07 PM";"[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Anyone can use EQLI to purchase a home to build, we dont discriminate. Just some background info, in Australia, the deposit just to get a mortgage is between 10-20% and house prices vary up to almost $1M depending on hosehold income such as 2 adult incomes that pass the test to be loaned that amount. For a half decent home 2-3 bedroom about 400k to 600k. It is difficult to find one for less than 300k. That being said, i have for the past half decade have been insisting that house prices are becoming extremely inflated and mortgage stress and household debt will become too much for the economy to bear and will have a negative effect for everyone. The banks have also been lending out more in mortgages than people are able to service. Politicians own collectively $370M in investment property and people are allowed to hoard multiple properties using an interest only mortgage and a tax benefit that was brought in during the 80's when interest rates were above 10% The tax benefit was to stimulate housing investment to in turn stimulate building and jobs in construction. Now that many countries and Australia have the lowest rates in history, the tax benefit is out dated and is detrimental to the broader economy. The tax benefit allows property investors to claim losses against an investment property to pay less income tax and also reduces government income to put towards the economy, infrastructure, job incentives schemes, etc and with the ratio of  first home buyers dropping, not just in australia, but developed countries too. And I havent even mentioned the increasing number of people falling below the poverty line. In the 21st century, the middle class is shrinking.";"";"";
