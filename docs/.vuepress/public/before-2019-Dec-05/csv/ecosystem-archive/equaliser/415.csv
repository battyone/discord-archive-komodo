Nor will anyone from here even attempt to simply talk in the chat there to prompt other traders to invest in EQLI. I seriously how anyone can expect the price to go anywhere. I put a crap load of $ in buy support on Exrates and every time I did, the price was dumped right back down. Seriously... this entire scenario boggles my mind. I've been in other investments/communities such as this and have never seen so little effort put into the promotion of ""the price"" of the asset. I debated on coming in here many times, I debated on dumping my 1.2 million EQLI a few times. My end solution came to this, come in here and hope saying something will turn things for the better for all of us. I understand if this post gets deleted.... just make sure the right people see it before it does please. Been raining at my house all day long... so I'm going share some HEAVY rain with the community.";"";"";
