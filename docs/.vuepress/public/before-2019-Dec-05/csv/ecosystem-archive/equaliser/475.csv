when bitcoin breaks $6000 people arent going to sell BTC to buy alts...they will sell BTC and put in cash equivalent.
same for other assets like stocks and bonds. until the dust settles and global economic volatility subsides a bit i think a migration to cash will be the safe haven people have been neglecting for the past decade as they went from investing in one asset to another. thats my opinion.

If you're in australia and NZ, possibly U.K and U.S.A as the g20 all signed in bain-in provisions as opposed to bail-ou provisions they used tax payer money in 2008 to bail out banks. cash deposits cxan be confiscated as happened in cypress. 
Cash will seem enticing especially if interest rates rise to deleverage excessive credit in the system and broad money supply, the trap is depositing fiat into banks and it will be used to bail-in. Australian banks only have to give notice the same day they do it by word of a news paper ad and it could already happen before you know.";"";"";
