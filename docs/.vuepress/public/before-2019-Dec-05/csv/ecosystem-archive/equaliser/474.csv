As we have been concentrating alot on progressing the build which in turn will be fuel for the marketing machine as a wise community member has said. The entire cryptoverse is really quiet and many this year have exited crypto all together however, I believe soon, many will flood back in. There are people in other communities still mining coins with asic's at little to no profit to accumulate like people mined bitcoin back in the day when it was worthless and no one knew about it. Good things take time and what we are building is not just a crypto currency but a movement to give affordable housing and as soon as humanly possible when we have the means is charitable efforts. unfortunately there will still be people that just want to make a quick buck and I have no respect for such people";"";"";

If i wanted EQLI, then trading options are available, in the same day i would have 1,000 times more EQLI mining ANYTHING else.
