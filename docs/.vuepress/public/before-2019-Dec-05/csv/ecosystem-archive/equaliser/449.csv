The places we'll be addressing later don't necessarily have the high structural standards of the UK or the US, so we can work out the process of building them at low cost in high cost areas, and then build comparatively fantastic structures in other areas, using local materials, and have a vastly superior product at low cost. Starting off in those areas would create a temptation to cut corners. I doubt any of this crew would succumb to it, but we are human üòÑ But primarily, if you learn to build cheap on cost and expensive on quality where it DOES cost a lot, you can more readily cut costs without cutting quality in other areas.";"";"";
