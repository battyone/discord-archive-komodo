There are so many that do the right thing and genuinely need hardship assistance so by having that solution which increases allowance especially the extra help for the kids is awesome. I know I would love to get involved and support indigenous programs to get younger generations into building, given that the future job environment is leaning towards automation and A.I.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"29-Oct-18 07:41 AM";"[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @AndronicusBass-Founder actually the new welfare card was developed by the company I work for, for the government. I helped develop it.  It was on a trail basis now for at about 2 years at rural indiginous commununtiites.  After the first trial, other aborginal communities were asking for it in their community becasue they too had the same problems with all the money the family got spent on alcohol and tabacco and gambling, etc, and it was the kids that missed out on getting food on the table. The government announced a couple of weeks ago that it will now roll out the new debit card in the Bundaberg region in Queensland, which should be interesting as it's a more 'mainstream' community, but has a lot of welfare.  My wife has cousins in that area so it'll be interesting to see any differences they may notice.  At work we have a couple of months of work to make changes to the system before the government will roll it out.  I won't be working on it this time, but I'm keen to hear about the changes and how well the system gets accepted in Bundaberg.";"";"";
