If anyone has any exchange relationships that can help us list we would appreciate the help. Also I am willing to pay a lot on some deep discounted pre-sale to kick off marketing if you have any investors?

GLX.com has created Polymath ST20 compliant tokens with the symbol ‚ÄúX‚Äù and ‚ÄúXA‚Äù for our current Series A $2 million raise. We have structured a Reg CF for U.S. citizens that will be listed on the StartEngine.com platform and a Reg S to reach offshore investors.

Following our Series A GLX will be doing a $25 million Tier II Reg A+ token offering as well. With the promotions we have lined up we feel GLX is going to be the hottest STO of the first half of this year.

We are looking for additional exchanges to list our offering and would like to work with you. Please fill out our listing survey here so we can get in touch - https://glx.co/sto
