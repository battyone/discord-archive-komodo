Barterlly is now open on BETA mode, and will provide tools for users and CoinOwners to perform OTC trades in a safe way.
Any KMD assetchain dPowed will be listed, and supported, for free.
Other coins not already listed can submit a listing application at : https://barterlly.typeform.com/to/iqpS1H
During the BETA, Barterlly won't charge any fee other than the transaction ones. after the release we will charge 1% on top of every transaction.
Our goal is to provide premium tools for coins listed on the platform. (Discord swapbot, twitter integration, public orders, wallet integration, API, custom templating, and many more).
Feel free to join us on our Discord.
