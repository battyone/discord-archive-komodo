The backend is based on the token DEX CC, where anyone can create, trade and exchange using the colored token system setup by KMD.  

In regards to the voting system, checks would have to be put in place to prevent clear abuse and multi-voting. Some steps that could be taken: 
1) Take steps to monitor and mitigate multi-voting from the actual platform . We could ban VPNs and detect for any suspicious activity coming from the same IP. 
2) Add voting requirements, which can then be included when signing for an address. For example, we could add a Discord alias, a link to a social media account that must tweet out MGN / MGNX at least once. We could add requirements that the accounts are at least a certain age, before being used as another form of authentication. The message signing  is flexible and not solely limited to verifying a single piece of information.";"";"";

This is an interesting model (if I'm understanding it correctly), is the project going to be running a DEX? But instead of hosting and building one, just have MGNX as the intermediary exchange token that's being atomic-swapped between customer orders on the front end and on the kmd DEX on the backend? If that's so, that is quite clever imho.";"";"";

"368424942645149697";"MagnaDev#7112";"17-Oct-18 06:11 PM";"Yes, it's taking advantage of the DEX already built into the MGNX asset chain with CC.  

See these RPC commands for reference:
```tokenaddress [pubkey]
tokenask numtokens tokenid price
tokenbalance tokenid [pubkey]
tokenbid numtokens tokenid price
tokencancelask tokenid asktxid
tokencancelbid tokenid bidtxid
tokenconvert evalcode tokenid pubkey amount
tokencreate name supply description
tokenfillask tokenid asktxid fillunits
tokenfillbid tokenid bidtxid fillamount
tokeninfo tokenid
tokenlist
tokenorders [tokenid]
tokentransfer tokenid destpubkey amount```

We would create the front end to simplify the token creation process. MGNX would be the currency that each token is pegged to when trading.";"";"";
