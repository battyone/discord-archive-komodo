Some can be handled automatically, but some other, that should... never happen, would need investigation. I'm trying to reduce it to the maximum giving ""exit points"" in case of stuck trade, depending on the status it may involve a specific modal for whatever side needs to ask for a refund (if the trade is stuck). About a way to identify and authorize it, we'll have 2 cases : There was a problem during the sending of any side : It will be handled via cancel module, as nothing has been spent, a refund is one of the way to proceed.";"";"";
