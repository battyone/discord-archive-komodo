Using keywords such as barter / trade /swap etc could help people remember the product. I think Barterlly although a bit mainstreamish is a really good option. Everyone knows Changelly so people can relate to that and even place us as direct alternative/option to them. I guess mainstream is good thing here, but we could also go for something more creative / unique. I will be thinking of alternatives. But i recommend buying  Barterlly as soon as possible.";"";"";

"456226577798135808";"Deleted User#0000";"28-Oct-18 09:17 PM";"About the hidden stuff. As I said to @KomodoWorld i believe that we should try to include in native mode any specific functionnality that could be needed. Just an example : 
Imagine it is run by a company. On its current state I think it s a requirement. The company won t take risks for free. So that means they should be able to ""puncture"" by a specific amount / percentage. All this stuff natively included and modifiable via a specific parameter table / whatever. That could even allow special event like : today swapping is free. Or just for a coin is without fee. 

Including this type of logic seems best done during inception than afterwards.


Another thing I will include is the ability for any side to choose to do only z tx for compatible chains. Basically just a checkbox will make it very easy.

This indeed seems like a good idea but in that case it could make things harder hw side. So including a potential additional fee maybe is useful.

Maybe this stuff will never be used : i mean the fee side... but if it s handled by default... it s better ^^";"";"";

As of today, we'll rely on 4 main components : 

UI 
Payment processor
DB
Coin Server

At this stage PP and Coin server are on the same machine, but tweaking it for any coin to be redirected to the proper server may allow this solution to scale : Imagine server A can't handle more coins : just add a new one (B) with fresh coins to add, and just a param in db allowing the main PP server to point at targetted nodes may be more efficient";"";"";
