1. relation to HL tokenized shares and options -> dividends
2. need for tx fees paid in HEAT on the DEX, for both crypto exchange of existing and new coins, and 3rd party tokenized equity exchange
3. need for tx fees for microservices
4. need for tx fees for 3rd party app usage of the HEAT blockchain
5. need for tx fees for messaging suite
6. requirement for tx fees related to benchmarking gamification platform
7. requirement for tx fees related to various gaming solutions on HEAT chain
8. demand on the markets when the previous mechanisms are understood en masse
9. the possibility for HL Ltd to acquire majority / all of HEAT coins on the market, and the knowledge of this for the public
10. the traditional process of coin demand arising for the Unique Sales Points of the HEAT technology and ecosystem infrastructure currently in progress on several fronts related to parts 1-9.";"";"";

The tokenized shares from the company may receive dividends from yearly profits, which are already planned fairly nice from the past two years for the future shareholders. The shares are planned to be sold not only for BTC and EUR, but carefully considered price level of HEAT also. By all odds balancing the initial discrepancy between BTC, EUR and HEAT price, the tokenized shares' entitlement for the quick dividends and yearly dividends is planned to stabilize HEAT coin's price towards that incepted by the BTC and EUR valuation of the shares.";"";"";

We've been concluding the contract with the partner - licensed EUR e-wallet combined with high profile public blockchain ICO using the HEAT tech. Finally signing the agreement last night, this is a considerable milestone in finally beginning to bring in significant revenue for the company. Although using dynamic pricing based on performance fee, the minimum value of the deal offsets most company expenses for the past years and has the capacity for much more if the ICO and eventual business are successful. This was achieved with the single partnership. As hinted previously we do have several partnerships / customers of similar scale pending, however as seen now finalizing them often may take more than one year from starting the discussions.

Not only that, we managed to bring the benchmarking suite to a functional testing phase inhouse, with UI tuneups now ongoing for the public release later this month. Alexey already demonstrated 1300 tps on a single client without a slightest hickup on the server side. Combined with marketing efforts, our expectations on the effect and implications of releasing this suite are big, unfortunately we still have to wait a little until Theo finishes the current adjustments and Dennis returns from a break to finalize the public release!";"";"";

Getting closer to the August releases becoming public. Dennis also has been back at work for all of this week as indicated earlier. Some fresh winds these days and weeks at HQ pumping up the staff expansion plans for both onsite and remotely in co-op with both of our now two licensed e-money partners. Development on co-ops and the numerous large inhouse projects are forcing us to ramp up more focused personnel resources (exclusive, which is a game we've been avoiding except for the core team)  on both tech and marketing areas.";"";"";

Includes Heatledger 2.5.4

Notable Server Changes

Added signaling server to provide peer-to-peer messaging via WebRTC technology. The basic version of the signaling server supports central signaling host with the following features:

- Off-chain messaging, data transtmitted and stored encrypted on local device (sender & receiver) only
- P2P direct connect from client to client after signaling channel creation
- prevent MITM attacks via encryption signaling data (on client side) by users public/private keys. Server cannot recognize any client WebRTC data after signaling channel creation

- Online trigger with accept / decline confirmation for incoming connect requests
Other updates:
- discard chart and market updates when blockchain is downloading and height is far from peers height;
- fix sql select transactions

Notable Changes in Heatwallet Client

- Added company node data source and failover mechanism for Bitcoin client side wallet
- Added local payment message storage (encrypted)
- Removed trollbox
- Added NXT support for client side wallet

- enabled Ardor client side wallet
- enabled Ignis Chain DEX access. Access you ARDR account first, then DEX screen
- enabled BTC/ARDR market
- prepared BTC withdrawal automation system and NXT / ARDR deposit automation
