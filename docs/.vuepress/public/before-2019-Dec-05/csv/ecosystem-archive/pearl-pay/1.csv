I see this line in the whitepaper: ‚ÄúPRLPAY Coin shall be used as a medium of exchange which will allow our OFW to convert their fiat currency into PRLPAY Coins, Pearl Pay Exchange shall immediately and automatically convert the OFW PRLPAY Coins into the Philippine peso equivalent.‚Äù 

For the case of remittance, it will be all buy token order on the sending side and all sell token order on the receiving side(if i understand it right, converting the coin to peso means someone must buy the coin and sell their peso), how is it possible to keep the token price from collapsing? 

Who will want to buy the token (e.g use ph peso to buy the token) on the receiving side? Does the buyer in ph has any use of the token? Why will someone in ph want to do that if they have no use of the coin?

If it is the Pearl-pay doing it, you will end up with a lot of other countries‚Äô fiat currency hold up overseas and spending a lot of peso in ph?";"";"";
