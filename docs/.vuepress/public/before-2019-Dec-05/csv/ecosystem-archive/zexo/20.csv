This past week:
- Zaddex blockchain launched
- Digital Price exchange lists $ZEX (within 24 hrs)
- Blockexplorer live 
- dPOW notarization deployed
- Blockfolio listed Zaddex $ZEX
- Agama wallet integration - pre release 0.2.44c

Komodo's support has been fantastic and enabled us to achieve many things in a short space of time.  Thank you to Komodo and everyone in this channel for showing an interest and supporting the project. 

Our development team is working diligently behind the scenes on the Zaddex exchange and we look forward to publishing an update on the progress soon. 

This week we will work on getting miners on the network and continue the process of getting listed on exchanges.";"";"👌 (4),🐙 (1)";
