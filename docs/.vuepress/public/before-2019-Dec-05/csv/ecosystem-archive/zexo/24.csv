Barterlly is now open on BETA mode, and will provide tools for users and CoinOwners to perform OTC trades in a safe way.
Any KMD assetchain dPowed will be listed, and supported, for free.
Other coins not already listed can submit a listing application at : https://barterlly.typeform.com/to/iqpS1H
During the BETA, Barterlly won't charge any fee other than the transaction ones. after the release we will charge 1% on top of every transaction.
Our goal is to provide premium tools for coins listed on the platform. (Discord swapbot, twitter integration, public orders, wallet integration, API, custom templating, and many more).
Feel free to join us on our Discord.

On our side we stop our involvement in day to day operation of the Centralized exchange long ago as we don’t see value and future for an xxxxxx other centralize exchange even with good markets and verticals. I know that Redfox been talking about giving part of zaddex to another partner-operator. On our side I think we have been more than clean and respectful of the community, offering a Zexo buy back and a real upgrade with DuneDex. That being said please don’t worry there was less than 2btc deposit and the dev team and Redfox has access to the exchange wallet (we don’t), I strongly believe that fund are safe and please know that worst case of worst case of worst case 2btc should not be much of a problem.
