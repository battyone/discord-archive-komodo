Read Zaddex whitepaper. Have few questions:

1. Will your centralised exchange engine be open soruce code?
2. Since the team decided to be anonymouse, which I respect the decision, what points you have to build trust on your team?
3. How many team members there are in Zaddex project? Can you please share their usernames and their roles?
4. I assume you will use the Assets Crypto-Conditions Smart Contract for decentralised exchange part. Please confirm if that's correct.
5. Which developer will be improving Assets CC?
6. The whitepaper doesn't cover Z address useage with Hybrid Exchange. Please clear how it will use Z tx for DEX.
7. There is not really enough details in the whitepaper for Hybrid Exchange, other than much it clears that it will be a Centralised Exchange. When can you provide more technical details on your project?";"";"üëÜ (5)";

There are the anon devs and two business facing people. Myself and one other who will introduce themselves shortly. We are responsible for strategy, planning and also delivery. 4. Our core team is learning more about the CC smart contracts each and every day and will look for as much assistance as required. 5. Our devs will be doing this. 6. We already have the tech for this to occur in a centralised fashion and are now building this for DEX and will update with a more technical white paper soon. 7. Yes, as stated these will follow.
