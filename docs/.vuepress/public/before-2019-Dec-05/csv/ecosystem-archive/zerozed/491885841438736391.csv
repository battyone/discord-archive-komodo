`What is needed is an alternative to Tether that is built on it‚Äôs own Proof-of-work backbone in order to break away from the ties to the US Dollars out of control inflation. Using the Diffusion of Innovations to base an inflation model, along with an industry supported tried and true mining algorithm and cross-chain transactions such as the Atomic Swap network on the Komodo (KMD) platform, a potential now exists to solve a long time debated issue surrounding not just volatility but how to achieve successful diffusion whilst maintaining the normal distribution and a standard score of 0z. In other words how do we create a stable crypto-currency that is, relatively speaking, evenly dispersed between everyone alive once new coins cease production.`";"";"";
