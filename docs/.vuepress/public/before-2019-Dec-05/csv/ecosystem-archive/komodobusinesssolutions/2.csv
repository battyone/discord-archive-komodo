The problem is we see many blockchain smart contracts donate (or claim to) to charities with smart contract. But the downstream flow of the tokens is quite opaque and not as traceable.

I'm working on TreeLand. A Blockchain foundation which helps donors trace their donation to a specific tree using drones (proof of plant) powered by the blockchain. We want to introduce trust and transparency never seen before to the space. A world where honest tree planters get rewarded manifold to be able to multiply their good work.‚Ä®

The first eco-friendly crypto currency that supports cross-chain carbon offset. We want to connect with as many crypto currencies in current and other chains as possible so they too can become a green crypto-currency. And we can proof that with how many trees they planted and carbon offset";"";"";

Currently they have acquired nearly 100 hectares of land. They are slowly acquiring all of the surrounding land that sits in the buffer zone. I think there are areas that can overlap and there could be some collaboration by both projects.";"";"";
