https://www.iso.org/committee/6266604.html
It is currently being let by Gilbert from Quant Overledger. That means that they are defining the industry standard for their market. A market that they share with KMD and Blocknet and a few other contenders.
Quant operates from the UK office. 
ISO is an international standards organization. That means that most countries have an standards office. If your country has a standards office then you can submit to participate in defining and reviewing a standard.";"";"";

Some Standards offices carry a fee to join. Komodo might classify as NGO? so that would be a low fee.";"";"";

Since Komodo is geographically spread out you might be able to influence the process. From what I've been able to gather each country has a vote, so the more countries you operate in the more influence you have. 
With that being said, I understand that @jl777c seeks to cooperate with Quant rather than compete in this matter";"";"";

Then you talk about who to support, sometimes taking into account if supporting one group will further your countries agenda..

Most people in these groups represent business interest or are scholars. Many of them lack more in-depth technical insight into Blockchain technology. The current proposal for an official Blockchain meta-model is lacking at best. You guys can provide insight from the frontlines of where this technology is actually being developed and you have a huge team to pull technical insight from. The meetings are only a couple a year, and most work is done in writing so you can take it back here for insight.";"";"";

Barterlly is now open on BETA mode, and will provide tools for users and CoinOwners to perform OTC trades in a safe way.
Any KMD assetchain dPowed will be listed, and supported, for free.
Other coins not already listed can submit a listing application at : https://barterlly.typeform.com/to/iqpS1H
During the BETA, Barterlly won't charge any fee other than the transaction ones. after the release we will charge 1% on top of every transaction.
Our goal is to provide premium tools for coins listed on the platform. (Discord swapbot, twitter integration, public orders, wallet integration, API, custom templating, and many more).
Feel free to join us on our Discord.
