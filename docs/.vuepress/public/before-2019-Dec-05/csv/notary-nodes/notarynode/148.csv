as a n00b in kmd and NN i found the NN setup docs to be quite comprehensive, however 'how to run an efficient nn' would be detrimental in my opinion!
as @webworker01 said this is like SF.. kmd knowledge and getting your way around a linux box should be a requirement! running an efficient node is down to commitment, ability & willingness to learn. from the little time i spent here i observed that a NN has tremendous responsibility which should NOT be taken lightly.

if you're not willing to get in everyone's git, go through code, test, break & improve things and dyor one should not be here <- this has nothing to do with current skills btw

@Deleted User - barriers should not be lowered btw, i'd rather we have high standards to which candidates should aspire to.. one should not seek equality of outcome with 0 input.. put some damn hours into it

If I can throw my two cents in there; this time last year I didn't know how to use Linux.... So there's a bit of transparency for any voters considering me as a NN  😛 
A perceived 'lack of docs' didn't stop me learning all I could through trial & error, along with a massive amount of help from multiple members of the community here who put their time and effort into answering my silly questions along with explaining concepts. I wouldn't be able to do a lot, if it wasn't for the patience of people like @Alright @webworker01 @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 @blackjok3r , just to name a few. 
I find it difficult to understand when people come into this community and don't find it easy to integrate into. I believe if you have the right attitude and willingness to learn, test, trial, error, and continue to test, you will struggle . I think that could be translated into anything in life though I suppose.

Our intention was to present a proposal as honest as possible, with minimal compensation for our informative work and maintenance of the node. Of course, 50% is not the only thing we offer, as it can be read in our application.";"";"";
