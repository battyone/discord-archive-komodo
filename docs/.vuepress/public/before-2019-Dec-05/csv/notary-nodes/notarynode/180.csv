Btw, there is an additional extra hint exists on blockchain all of these time. If you will see txes on `bTMf2oY21U63oZD6Yfk1igyp4MjcaEfp8m` you will see, that it already has spent tx  b001d94442f3ce5e38ae845ceaee9a9f5de95370f4e3a5314aa7e8fc714eeb71 from this address. So, users initially have 2 possible variants of solution:

1. Look on the picture, trying to hash `vote4decker` secret and construct a reedem script.
2. Or just look on txes, and copy complete redeem script from tx b001d94442f3ce5e38ae845ceaee9a9f5de95370f4e3a5314aa7e8fc714eeb71 without know a secret and without know how to construct it. Like ""monkey copy style"" )";"";"";

Solution: https://komodod.com/t/945b6d970204bf414102a4dfadec8615c09ab48c20d835e77f488bcbd78e4599 

Look at the winner tx and it's scriptSig field:
```0b766f7465346465636b6572aa201b549cfc12bd56569b5d1b73fa5cdda12ca5f681c648328b40445db4f41e15f587```
As it P2SH, scriptSig field contains here redeem script:
```766f7465346465636b6572 OP_HASH256 1b549cfc12bd56569b5d1b73fa5cdda12ca5f681c648328b40445db4f41e15f5 OP_EQUAL```
As you see `766f7465346465636b6572` it's a `vote4decker` in ASCII, that gives you 1b549cfc12bd56569b5d1b73fa5cdda12ca5f681c648328b40445db4f41e15f5 after OP_SHA256. So, two steps for solve needed:
1. Found secret `vote4decker`
2. Construct above redeem script.
3. Make a tx with passing this redeem script to claim the reward.";"";"";
"249256116150730753";"PHBA2061#2530";"30-Apr-19 08:18 AM";"to be honest there are still things I don't completely understand yet, but I think I'll get it soon.
The very first thing I do is searching on google, then I found this and tried to understand how this Bitcoin puzzle works https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Transaction_puzzle (if anyone hasn't, try to reproduce the result, it's harder than you thought üòÉ )
Then back to the puzzle, I already tried to OP_HASH256  `vote4decker`  but it doesn't seem to give the correct answer (may be I was doing it wrong, not sure it's the string that has to be hashed or the string has to be converted to binary value first). I was about to give up after this point
Then I realized there are 3 transactions linked with your address (before I redeem the reward),  so I just used `getrawtransaction` on this one `b001d94442f3ce5e38ae845ceaee9a9f5de95370f4e3a5314aa7e8fc714eeb71` then `decoderawtransaction`, it would then give";"";"";
