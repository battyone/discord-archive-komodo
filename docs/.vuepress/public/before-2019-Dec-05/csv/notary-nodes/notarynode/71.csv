Graduated college over 12 years ago now and I've been operating as an independent contractor ever since. I've spent this time specializing in selling, planning, installing, configuring, calibrating, networking, securing, servicing and troubleshooting HIPPA compliant systems. I've never had a boss, just a handful of regular trusting and happy clients.

I'm very happy to make myself part of the KMD community efforts by assisting newcomers where and when possible across a full range of potential matters which I might contribute advice towards drawn from years of real world experience. I joined this KMD discord channel within the first day it came online and can be counted on to remain present and involved here throughout NN upkeep. I'm ready and willing to work hard to keep a single node up and running at it's best. I'm a true KMD believer. Currently holding as much as I can afford to but will need help from community to get enough votes to earn a node.""";"";"";
