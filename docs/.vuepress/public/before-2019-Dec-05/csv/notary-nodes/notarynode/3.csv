"456226577798135808";"Deleted User#0000";"21-Jun-18 10:42 AM";"I see it totally differently. As stated during elections notaries job is to ""notarize"" : secure kmd and ecosystem by running programs that devs (and mostly jl777) release.
This can be seen as : buy / rent a node run program and it s done.
To me (at least) that doesn t mean there is nothing to do : process / tech is very young ( I think it s the 2nd election so far ). So it need very special attention : monitoring and be sure to have the best performance is time consuming : you have the choice being a notary to be proactive on it : monitor and check every single change in codebase : refresh and test asap, or just wait and do it when you have time for it.
Linking other activities like ecosystem development is not relevant, at least to me : your job as a notary is to protect the network and be very reactive. Developping side business is not a part of the deal : it helps the entire ecosystem but relation with notaries duty is in my mind a : 0.
What is related is everything and every process that can help refine adapt and make the notarizing system better, period : for example you have 2 huge contributors : @webworker01  that developped a wonderful interface to monitor every notary activity / performance : THIS is a way to optimize the notarization system because it shows publicly strenghts and weakness of any operator and it just hardens the competition to be on top stats : top stats job well done. Another high contributor ir for example @blackjok3r that just coordinate and develop scaling investing time like no other contributor.
A lot of other notary nodes operator participate on this and participate in the process. That s how the system and ecosystem is refined. That s how I see the notary ""todo"" list done.";"";"üëè (4),‚ù§ (4)";
