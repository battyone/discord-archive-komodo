But I don't think I can spend 40 hours a week only on operating the nodes for the full years. I could spend a few week at 100 if needed. But I also need to work on my regular business VFX 3D and 3D animation business. I can decide how many hours I spend on my regular business most of the time but I can't just stop it. So maybe I can't be a NN operator if it takes so many hours. I maintain my own render farm of 16 computers, ftp server, designed and maintained a few externally hosted websites since 1995. I mined on windows and linux many different coins since 2014. So I am mostly an artist but still highly technical in many aspects (mainly fluid sims and all kinds of VFX, with some scripting in maxscript, melscript, houdini VEX, VOP) but I'm not a coder. So I guess I would need to put a lot more time than most others NN op. I would like to try it for 2 or 3 months and see if I can do it for a full year before proposing.
