In a real case scenario, I don't think we should expect any harm from other NN's, we just need to be prepared.
I have no doubt in case something goes wrong / an operator goes rogue he will just have all other NN chasing him. That s exacly what would happen to anyone harming my node, personnally. Am personally very cool with testnet stuff (even now I quitted), but the main NN is another subject, and I believe it s crystal clear for everyone ^^. This situation WILL happen, or MAY happen, the testnet here helped us to get safeguards.";"";"";
