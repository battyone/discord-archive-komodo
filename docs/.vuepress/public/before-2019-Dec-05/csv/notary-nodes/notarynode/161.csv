If I find one of my chains isn't notarizing for a couple of cycles (I base this on the most succesful nodes at that time), then I first consolidate then clean then split. If that doesn't work after another couple of cycles, I kill the daemon for that chain and restart, without reindex (made that mistake once, won't do that again!!). It might decide to verify the chain which can take a while. Once its finished, I found there will be no difference unless I consolidate/clean and split again. Once I've done that it all works..Again it works for me. I managed top stop on the 6hr chart for a short while following that, and up into the top 5 on the 48hr chart.

So even though the current best performing node is And1-89 with 10,11,20, I'm not going to do anything at this point, as I appear to be notarizing fine, albeit not the fastest.
