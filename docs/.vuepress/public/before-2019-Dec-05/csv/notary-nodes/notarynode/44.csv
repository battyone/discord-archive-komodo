To shift KMD NN elections towards a more meritocratic and less simplistic model, the following proposals are made: 

I. Notary Bonus:
All notaries from the previous year get 5,000 Vote2019; provided that:
1. they cannot vote for themselves
2. their votes are public
3. only 50% of their votes can go to notaries from the previous year. The remaining 50% of votes must be cast on new candidates.
4. failure to follow the above rules would nullify a notary's votes   

II. Active KMD community votes
To qualify as an active member, (non-notary) members must navigate to the #Vote2019 channel of the KMD discord and answer a series of questions about KMD. Those that complete the test and provide a valid address get 3,000 vote tokens.

III. KMD Hodler votes
All hodlers of KMD automatically get Vote2019 tokens on the basis of an exchanged rate of 100 KMD = 1 Vote2019

IV. Candidacy  limitations
Ideally there would be 64 separate NN run buy 64 qualified individual notaries. To achieve this goal, notary candidates may only run for one region. Should there not be enough qualified candidates on the first round, a second round of voting should be held. In the second round, existing notaries may run for a second spot. 1 notary should be limited to a max of 2 nodes. Additionally, candidates  should be automatically disqualified if they share personal or family relations to elected notaries.  ""Gifting"" votes to third parties is forbidden and would likewise result in disqualification.```";"";"";

I. notaries should have plenty of VOTE if they didn't dump the KMD earned over the previous year
II. sock puppets.
III. again, you shifted the decimal place, how does this prevent vote buying?
IV. eh, not a bad idea, but an added layer of complexity.
