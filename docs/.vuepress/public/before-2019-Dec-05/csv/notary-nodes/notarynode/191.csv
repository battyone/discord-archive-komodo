-reaching to be elected, passing through all colors of the rainbow emotionally during the last week when your ranking is doing yoyo around the crucial position between being elected or not
-being auto-reelected, watching and waiting to send your votes because you know last days may be critical and some potentially good candidate may need your help at last moment

For this time I am living the elections without being candidate
Seriously not easy

Searched a long time for the best criteria for voting
Finally came to:
-the best potential new blood (Darwinian and logical)
-the candidates I would find very unfair to not be elected (needed more thoughts, can be discussed and certainly more subjective)

Anyway the SH situation is very tight

Airdrop funds to all the transparent addresses and deny R to R transactions.
