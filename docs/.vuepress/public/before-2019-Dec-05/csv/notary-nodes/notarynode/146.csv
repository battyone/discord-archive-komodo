In short this code is terrible and slow and inefficiant. 
`time komodo-cli listunspent > /dev/null`
you will find with a large number of  utxos, the time for this call far out weighs ping time or any other factor. 
The goal is to make this as fast as you can, while never running out of utxos. 
Iguana starts a round of dpow in a thread, each node is connected directly to each other. 
there is recvmask, which is the first round.  To enter this, you must select and utxo and broadcast it to all your peers.
From this mask, the bestk and bestmask is generated randomly which chooses who notarizes. 
 The goal is to respond to enough peers fast enough that you are always in recvmask, and so have the best chance at being in bestmaks.
