Various things to notice: 

1) BODY POSTURE and MOVEMENT, 
2) EYES DIRECTION, EYE LID SHAPE and ACTIVITY, 
3) TONGUE ACTIVITY, 

There is a body language that iguanas have and it is of the utmost importance to learn it to properly read and understand what's on the iguana's mind, so you are able to accurately know it's every mood and attitude from moment to moment. You can tell if the iguana is calm and relaxed or scared and ready to run or ready to bite and whip instead or wants to have sex and mate or that he's suddenly taken on a scary change in character and become so serious and angry, and wants to go to war with you exactly as he would act if he sees another male iguana. 

When observing the iguana's body signs and activity, you must learn to distinguish between things that are temporary and changes of the moment as opposed to it's regular moods and behavior in general.";"";"";
