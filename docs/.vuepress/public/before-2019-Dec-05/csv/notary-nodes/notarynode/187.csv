`TL;dr`  As a team, stop fucking up.

For the past couple of days I've been expecting some of the 'old-timer' NN ops to jump in here and give us all a good blasting.

We've fucked up majorly. Again.

""The flag never touches the ground.""

Well, the flag is being trampled in the mud right now.

This is the second time that the network that we are supposed to be securing had had no notarizations for an extended period.  Over 10 hours this time and still counting.

Sure this is a testnet.  And having such a high percentage of ops required to participate in a notarization could be seen as adverse circumstances.

That doesn't matter.

By being here we are asking for the chance to be given the responsibility of securing 100s of millions of dollar of other people's money.  And to show that we are worthy of that, both individually and as a group.

As a team we are failing dismally.

Clearly there are many here who are doing their utmost to improve their performance and support the network and the people who rely on it.

That is not enough.  The results speak for themselves.";"";"";
"412482228359266328";"CrisF#3405";"04-May-19 01:45 AM";"Individual results won't mean anything to the person whose deal falls through because we didn't do our job as a group.  They won't be much comfort to the investor whose investment drop in value because we damaged the reputation of the project that we are tasked with securing. 

Talk of what us candidates will do to 'add value to the ecosystem' or how to improve 'the system' is important and useful.  But clearly this should come secondary to the fundamental role of a NN op.

Ensuring the reliable notarization of the network is the job.  First and foremost.

How about getting that sorted out?
 
There is no blame here.  Just a problem requiring a solution, and a chance to improve.

For me that means: 
- keeping aware of upcoming updates
- making arrangements to be available
- coming up with alternatives if I'm not going to be available
- spreading awareness of upcoming updates
- dealing with NN related problems as a priority
- solicit further advice on what I can do
- take responsibility for my part of the problem
- writing this

I know you'll tell if I'm wrong.  I count on that.

Feedback appreciated.";"";"labs (1),👍 (1)";
