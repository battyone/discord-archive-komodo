Transaction puzzle
Transaction a4bfa8ab6435ae5f25dae9d89e4eb67dfa94283ca751f393c1ddc5a837bbc31b is an interesting puzzle.

scriptPubKey: OP_HASH256 6fe28c0ab6f1b372c1a6a246ae63f74f931e8365e15a089c68d6190000000000 OP_EQUAL
scriptSig: 
To spend the transaction you need to come up with some data such that hashing the data twice results in the given hash.

Stack    Script    Description
Empty.    <data> OP_HASH256 <given_hash> OP_EQUAL    
<data>    OP_HASH256 <given_hash> OP_EQUAL    scriptSig added to the stack.
<data_hash>    <given_hash> OP_EQUAL    The data is hashed.
<data_hash> <given_hash>    OP_EQUAL    The given hash is pushed to the stack.
true    Empty.    The hashes are compared, leaving true on the stack.
This transaction was successfully spent by 09f691b2263260e71f363d1db51ff3100d285956a40cc0e4f8c8c2c4a80559b1. The required data happened to be the Genesis block, and the given hash in the script was the genesis block header hashed twice with SHA-256. Note that while transactions like this are fun, they are not secure, because they do not contain any signatures and thus any transaction attempting to spend them can be replaced with a different transaction sending the funds somewhere else.

Hey, notaries, remember I promised bounties for those, who put their time in exchange to making Komodo great again? Here it comes.
I will not make any puzzles, quests or tricky questions (when polo?). I decided to just pick those, who actually made things better or worked hard. 
1. @Alright for making our days harder and putting our attention on election weak side. Much disliked but needed thing. 50000 VOTE.
2. @Decker for being *real* election master. Bc almost all election tech side is actually made by him, not by me. 50000 VOTE.
3. @blackjok3r - just scroll this chat up to see who actually spends best years of life here. 50000 VOTE
4. @SHossain is constantly helping dev process (he denies that, but thats true) all the time. 50000 VOTE
5. @MadMaX for komodod.com. It's awesome. 50000 VOTE
6. @CHMEX won by testnet results. 50000 VOTE
7. @CrisF won by testnet results. 50000 VOTE
8. @mrlynch as a pirate can get 1kk ARRR, but I only have VOTE's, so 50000 VOTE.
9. @Mylo - sometimes I underestimated much how hard marketing team and writers work also. Supported election public stuff. 50000 VOTE.
10. @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ for being almost as cool as @Alright (joke). For activity in testnet and general participation. 50000 VOTE

Heroes above - please DM me your VOTE address (one and only). I will send batch when get all addresses.

And sorry to all others. I love you all and your donation to community is always valuable. But if we give VOTE's to everyone - there is no need for elections.
