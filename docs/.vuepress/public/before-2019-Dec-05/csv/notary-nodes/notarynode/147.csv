To my knowledge, no one on the internal team will be spending a lot of time improving Notary Node documentation, for several reasons. I received instructions from management early on to leave them alone. 

Gcharang deals with them the most, and I don't believe he's making changes. 

If a notary node were to get elected on the campaign promise of improving the docs, that would be something to look at.
