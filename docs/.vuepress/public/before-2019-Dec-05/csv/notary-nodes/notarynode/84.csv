```css
Connecting to more nodes will not make you learn about transactions faster, after some point.

Your node will just be busy processing messages - including many uninteresting ones - to maintain connections with all peers, making it slower at processing new things.

Connect to a few fast peers with -addnode, or even run multiple nodes yourself, and interconnect them to each other. That will be faster than connecting directly to everyone.
