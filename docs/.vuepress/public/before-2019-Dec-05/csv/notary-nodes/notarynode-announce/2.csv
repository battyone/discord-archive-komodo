Dear Notary Node operatos. Please update your node with saplig ready code for Komodo and Iguana, both from `dev` branch. We are about 12 hours away from network-wide Sapling activation.

1. New version of VRSC came out. It's a hardforking change and very important that we have all notaries update it's version. I will be monitoring that everyone updated, so to help me do that - please - let me know (in DM!) that you updated or if for whatever reason you cant update. This means I expect all NN ops to msg me success or fail message :)
Update itself should not be a problem, just git pull and build.sh.

2. komodo/iguana now have  new assetchain KSB to honor @metaphilibert
I funded all nodes, you need only impportprivkey to that chain also. Nodes making first notarization of that chain will get special thank you. (THANK YOU :)

3. Please, monitor your notarizing funds in advance, not on the very last moment. If you need more - DM me. Dont go to #safespace searching for me or any other chat - just DM. You can also msg me in telegram ( @kolobus ) if something strange with discord. But not chats where it can be missed easily.

1. Install GIN coin by compiling from their repo or by using ready easy script, which went flawlessly for me:
 https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/456828345871761408/542321009307418634

2. You need to import GIN wif generated from your iguana seed. They have exactly same addresses as GAME, but WIFs are different.
In Decker's repo there is genkomodo.php - you need to edit it to add your iguana very secret passphrase, run it via PHP php genkomodo.php - it will print all WIFs including one for gincoin, and dont forget to remove secret passphrase after that.
Be careful if you're installing PHP first time. you need cli-only PHP, not the one which installs full webserver as a dependency!

'./gincoin-cli importprivkey WIF-from-above'

3. Tomorrow will be GIN coin airdropped to all notaries.

4. Iguana already have PR to start notarizing GIN, will be in beta tomorrow also.

5. All other steps are same as always.

One pubkey should be generated by iguana (""btcpubkey"" field in iguana encryptwallet method output) as written in manual. It will be used for dpowing komodo to BTC and all assets into komodo. It's your main pubkey.
Second pubkey will be used for 3rd party coins notarizing. It should be generated same way as above, but with different passphrase.

You all know the safety rules, but I would like to remind:
1. Keep both passphrases (seeds) SAFE. It's main thing from which all your wallets, keys etc are generated deterministically. Knowing seed/passphrase means knowing all BTC, KMD and other privkeys.
2. Keep it really SAFE. Compromising your passphrase (as well as privkey) means your notary is done once and forever. We can't (100%!) revoke, recover, change or tweak pubkeys in komodod once they are hardforked in.
3. Make sure they are correct. As said above - we can't fix them or change later. It's blockchain.

While we have second chance - I recommend everyone redoing set of keys to be safe. Regardless of using Agama. It's not hard.

Desired way of generating pubkey is using iguana itself, directly on the notary server where it will be used.

According to manual of setting up NN:
1. Put random passphrase in wp_7666 file, replace method with  `encryptwallet` (instead of `walletpassphrase`) 
2. Start iguana TV once, it will print you all coin WIFs (except couple of 3rd party coins)
3. Import that WIFs into their coin daemons
4. Replace back to `walletpassphrase`

Now you can write your passphrase on piece of paper using pencil, put that paper in a safe secure place and thats literally everything you need to restore your wallets anytime later.
Do NOT save your WIFs  in any  app or service. Do not type your passphrase or WIF *anywhere* at all. If passphrase was invented directly when editing wp_7666 file on your NN server ensures your passphrase wont be compromised anywhere outside.

You can use genkomodo.php (on same server!), but I don't see much reasons installing PHP just for that right now.

@Decker notice: I'm aware iguana won't print some coins WIF's, but this will be fixed. You should agree writing passphrase only once in a lifetime statistically more safe than additional script :-p";"";"";

If you need time to switch over (send funds to new pubkey, rescan wallet or whatever) you can stop needed 3rd party coins, but please, try to keep KMD/BTC notarizing up.

3. 3rd party coins on new season NN

All other coins will be separated for the safety. There is a short manual by @blackjok3r on installing updated version of iguana for that. You will have to setup separate (!) server.

3rd party branch is: `git clone https://github.com/jl777/SuperNET.git -b blackjok3r`
Manual is here: https://pastebin.com/qD6zjTwX
(Please, notice iguana branch url is outdated there, use one from above)

Recommended specs are: not less than 16Gb RAM, 256Gb SSD, 8 threads min. On that server you will have Komodo, other version of iguana and all 3rd party coins. There should not be mining so it feels like specs will be ok (but I recommend having more disk space if possible, we can't predict what will be next coin).

This stuff is very experimental. Please, help @blackjok3r and others around you as much as you can. Time to implement this is very limited.

Also you CAN use different user on the same server as a temp solution while second server is in the process. Until the end of summer.
Than you will need to change port in secondary Komodo config into something different or use separate IP (if you know how, danger zone!).

Please, do not import secondary Komodo pubkeys/wifs into coins on primary Komodo and vice versa. It's your safety!

4. 3rd party coins on phasing out notaries: Do not touch them!)

Good luck. Please, ask any questions and don't get mad if not answered by me. Too many stuff in process and we totally lack time.";"";"";
