Are there plans to allow offers to specify a minimum as well as a floating price based on a rate from an exchange?  For instance, I'd like to sell some BTC at 10% over spot and don't want to come back and update the price every hour.  Also, a minimum purchase amount would be nice as the little stuff just isn't worth dealing with.

Thank you for the cool app!";"";"";
