Due to this huge amount of participation, we hit bottlenecks in our infrastructure much sooner than we had anticipated. This led to a high percentage of swaps not matching properly. As such, we're adjusting the requirements for entry into the prize pool. All you need to do is match one swap and you're eligible to win prizes. It is not a requirement for the swap to successfully complete- one matched swap (1/3) is enough to make into the prize pool.```";"";"ü¶é (5),üéÜ (1)";
