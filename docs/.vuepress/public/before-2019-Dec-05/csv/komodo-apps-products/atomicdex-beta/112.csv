```
----------
A has BTC, B has KMD. They agreed on swap price `1 BTC = 100 KMD`
A is the maker, B is the taker.

1) Taker Sends <dexfee>

B pays the dex fee so that A will start the process by locking his coins.

2) Maker Successfully Sends <makerpayment>

A picks randomNumber: `secret_A`

A creates a utxo on the Bitcoin blockchain with 
value: 1 BTC 
encumbrance: the value can be claimed by A after 20 hours or by B if he knows the secret `secret_A`

3)  Taker Successfully Sends <takerpayment>

After seeing the above utxo, B creates the following utxo on the KMD blockchain:
value: 100 KMD
encumbrance: the value can be claimed by B after 10 hours or by A if he knows the secret `secret_A`

4) Maker Spends <takerpayment>

 A uses the `secret_A`  and claims the KMD revealing the secret 

5) Taker Spends <makerpayment>

B now uses the public `secret_A` to claim the BTC

---
The times can be adjusted based on requirements of security and ""ease of use""
Normally, A should have a longer locktime so that B can have sufficient time to get his coins back if A doesn't reveal the secret `secret_A`
