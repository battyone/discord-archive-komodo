It would be interesting if a % of eth based trade fees could be directed to a capped pool(c-pool). By c-pool i mean that after for example 10 or 100eth accumulated the fees would stop going in the c-pool.
 The c-pool would pay for taker side of trades or maybe both sides (i personally think mainly taker shouldnt have to pay to buy eth or erc20 because if you are trying to get your first eth or simply go from asset to stablecoin its doesnt make sence to send asset to CEX > get eth > withdraw to atomicDex > get what you need)

Thats pretty much it. Thank you";"";"";
