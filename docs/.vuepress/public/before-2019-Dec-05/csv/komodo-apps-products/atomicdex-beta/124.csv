```
An app or service that you‚Äôre already logged into is asking for a login.
Permission popups that does not contain an app name.
Permissions asked from an app that shouldn‚Äôt require or need the permissions it asks for. For example, a calculator app asking for GPS permission.
Typos and mistakes in the user interface.
Buttons and links in the user interface that does nothing when clicked on.
Back button does not work like expected.
