I put in 2 different orders.
Once as an example: Dex/KMD and Dex/BTC
If I now switch the mobile phone to standby and then log in to the mobile phone after few seconds/minutes, then I'm back in AtomicDex and want to place another 3rd order for the same asset, the message ""Order book is being loaded"" appears - but then no existing orders from other people are displayed to me anymore. I can only create one myself.

I see as virtually no other available orders anymore. If it is a bug I don't know. But I noticed it.
