<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/> --> repo with the backend called Marketmaker 2.0, you can build it and get a CLI to the dex network
<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX> --> this is the placeholder repo of the AtomicDEX mobile app, a mobile GUI that uses Marketmaker 2.0
<https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex> --> the repo for the HyperDEX GUI, a Desktop app that uses Marketmaker 2.0
<https://github.com/chainmakers/chainmakers-ui-mono-repository/tree/master/packages/atomicdex-app> --> the repo for the Chainswap GUI, a Desktop app that uses Marketmaker 2.0

As all the UI's use the same backend, ""Marketmaker 2.0"", they share the same liquidity pool. i.e., an order created in one of them will be seen in all the others
<https://github.com/jl777/coins> --> all the coins in this repo with `""mm2"": 1,` in the file named ""coins"" have been tested to work with Marketmaker 2.0 and any one of the GUI's is able to list them";"";"üëçüèª (1)";
