You can either import an existing komodo address wallet or create a new address wallet in atomicdex. If you import an existing wallet, your coins (compatible coins ~ 99% of existing coins) should be accessible to send, receive, or trade. If you create a new wallet you will have to send your coins to the new wallet address(es) (BTC will have a unique non kmd type address and so will some other type of coins that are not komodo asset chains). Once they are in your new wallet you can send, receive and trade as you wish. When you trade, BTC to ETH for example, you use the DEX functionality and create your order that you want to trade. When you go to place it, you can select from existing liquidity or create a new order at your desired rate. Once it is matched, the rest is taken care of automatically. It leaves your wallet and the traded assets are sent directly to your wallet. Pure awesome'ness from jl777 and Komodo Team.";"";"";
