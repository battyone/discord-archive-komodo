1.  you can deposit your coins on a place that has all sorts of data on you, or you can keep it in your own wallet.
2. you can wait for deposits and kyc, or you can keep it in your wallet
3. you can trade eth to btc to buy any other alt coin, or you can find a direct pair in your pocket.
4.  you can leave your coins on a centralized target, and trust in the security and the employees of somewhere (usually in a foreign country) - or you can keep it in your pocket.
5. you can set an order at a centralized exchange and wait for it to hit/move/dance/whatever, or you can reach into your pocket and set an order in one market, and use the same funds to set an order in another market.  first order to bite, and you're trading.

it's unfair to compare it to centralized tech.   p2p atomic swaps are the best form of trading in many respects.
liquidity is better at a cex, but that is the current day.

an instant exchange like shapeshift or coinswitch, they do maybe 50BTC per day volume.
that sort of volume out of your pocket, and a whole new way of exchange can happen - and not only for crypto-traders.  merchants too...";"";"";
