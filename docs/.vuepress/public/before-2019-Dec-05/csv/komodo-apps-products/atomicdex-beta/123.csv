The key formula to keep in mind is x * y = k, where x and y are the number of coins in the liquidity pool and k is the result. To keep the constant k, x and y must be inversely dependent, i.e. if x goes up, then y goes down, and vice versa. When a trader makes a KMD purchase under this contract, he increases x (since they add KmdUSD to the liquidity pool) and decreases y (when they remove KMDUSD from the liquidity pool). But this scheme does not scale linearly. Trying to buy 100 KMD instead of 10 KMD does not just require 10 times more KmdUSD. In fact, it increases asymptotically.";"";"";
