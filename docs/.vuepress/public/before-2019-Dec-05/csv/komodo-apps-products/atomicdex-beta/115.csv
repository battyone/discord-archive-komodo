it will definitely have an audit before full public release

>  if the order matching is ""on-chain"" ? 
it is not on-chain, it is better than that: fully p2p
every mm2 instance creates its own local orderbook based on the orders it hears on the network
more info: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/atomicdex.html#the-decentralized-orderbook>

> how can it be on chain if there are 2 different chains?
on-chain happens in proxy token DEXs; it is better than some DEXs that follow a similar protocol as ours but use a centralised orderbook like a website

ours is better than both of the above cases as it is completely p2p and works with home desktops, mobiles with 3g/4g/wifi etc.,
