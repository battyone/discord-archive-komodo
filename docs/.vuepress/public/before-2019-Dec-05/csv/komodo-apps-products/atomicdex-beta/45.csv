Let's say I select that I want to sell my 10 KMD. I used to see how much of each coin I could get for my amount, and now it shows how many bids are out there for each coin instead. I have to click on the order book to see what the best bid actually is. That's okay if I know which coin I want to buy (the ""serious"" use case), but annoying if I just want to play around and maybe see if there's any ""dumb"" orders out there (the ""casual"" use case). Any chance we can have both types of information in the interface? E.g. BTC - 3 - best: 0.001 BTC (where 3 is the number of orders out there; maybe put that in a header or something).";"";"";
