F.A.Q.

Q1. Can't understand the structure of repo and it's branches. I tried to build from master branch, but seems it have old and only Windows version?

A. Yes, you are right. Earlier we have 3 separate branches one per OS, master -> Windows, Linux -> for Linux and MacOS -> MacOS. Since Komodo-Qt (KomodoOcean) have new build subsystem and ability to build static binaries for all 3 OS all of these branches are deprecated. You should use static branch to build latest Komodo-Qt. Static branch is default branch for now.```";"";"";
