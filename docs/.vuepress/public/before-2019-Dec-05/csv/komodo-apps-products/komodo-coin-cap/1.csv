The (codename) ""ecoboard"" project is split into 2 subprojects:

A) the backend layer (above github repo) is a (golang) service that fetches ecosystem project related infos/data from various publicly accessible APIs - this includes blockexplorers [kmdexplorer.io, vrsc.kmdexplorer.io,...], coin market APIs [coinmarketcap, coingecko,...] and other 3rd party APIs. Furthermore this system persists a specific set of data locally (last price, blockchain statistic numbers, etc.) and serves a publicly accessible API so that other 3rd party projects can utilize it. The backend  can also request realtime data from external APIs like current blockchain stats by forwarding a request to external endpoints. 

B) the frontend layer is a mobile ready (responsive) website based on dashboard templates. This website interacts with the backend layer from A) - e.g. users can view data (get) or send specific requests (post) like blockexplorer queries.";"";"";

The rebranded website also has few stat boxes. IBN is asking if we will have these data points ready for the launch (this week). If not, then they will be scoped out from the rebrand release.

- Last Github Commit (would have to check the details, I think it's supposed to say something like ""Last commit by ca333 made 39 minutes ago""
- Total Github Commits (we would have to add commits from multiple repos together)
- Most Commits Placed (who has made the last commits in some given period of time, like 30 days)
- Atomic Swaps in last 24 hours
- 24 Hour swap volume
- Number of Liquid KMD pairs (KMD pairs above some arbitrary treshold trading volume value)

> these data points are supposed to be on the site. the best way to do this is to provide us with an API endpoint that gives us all of this data at once in one call. could you work with someone on this on your end before end of week? otherwise we will need to descope it for the launch

`for the moment i will get the currency exchange price from the dexstat api, or you want me to get it from directly from binance,hitbtc,bittrex etc ?` - it would be very handy if we could fetch the prices from wherever they are available - dexstats, coingecko,... - but if the current solution is fully functional we can stick to one API (dexstats) for now and add others later.
