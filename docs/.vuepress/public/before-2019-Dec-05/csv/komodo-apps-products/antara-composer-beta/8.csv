This is to give me an idea of what is the best fit for you. Generally Antara is the simplest route and the best looking as you can get the wallet, explorers, etc with Antara. 

If your community is heavy developers they may be more interested in the nitty gritty parts of it, and you may want to explore the documentation for command line interface. However this wouldn't be a great route if you prefer everyone to be able to have their coins on mobile wallets.";"";"";

That will give you the coins, the wallets, the explorers, basically everything you need to provide coins as rewards and for your community to interact with them, hodl, send them, trade, check them out on explorers, the user friendly crypto experience.";"";"💯 (1)";

Antara lets you set up your blockchain/token, the entire minimal infrastructure to form a p2p network, blockchain explorer, SPV infrastructure, mining nodes, and much more just with a few clicks - however, it is not a pre-requirement to use Antara in order to build your chain on KMD and to get the mobile DEX wallet. Everything is pretty much very independent of each other on our platform.";"";"👍 (5)";

system is created and setup by the komodo devs.
now it's the system who takes care of all things automatically.
