the actual problem is the number of inputs the total value is in

Ex: 250000 coins available in 1 input vs 1000 inputs that each have 250 coins
the transaction to send 250000 in the first case will be very small (in terms of data size)
the transaction to send 250000 in the second case is very large(in terms of data size) as it needs to include details about 1000 different inputs and sign all of them

as there is a limit on the maximum size a transaction can be, the above difference matters";"";"";

that looks correct

here is an update which might create issues:

```
- Reimplemented ""Antara Modules"" UI.
- Improved ticker input box, space and letters like ≈û √á √ñ are not being typed.
- Tiny UI tweaks.
- Fixed and tested the withdraw issue fully.
- Added Subscription Month Selectors to Cart Page, Cart Sidebar and Tools Page.
- Changed prices.
- Website is served built/statically instead of in development mode.
