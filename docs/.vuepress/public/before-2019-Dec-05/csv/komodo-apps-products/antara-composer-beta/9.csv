`Hey team, it might be a cool idea marketing wise and also to showcase what can be done with Antara, to build an Antara smartchain to put these tweets on a blockchain. We could throw an explorer up that lets people view their deceased friend's and family's twitters and give it over to the Internet Wayback Machine. Make the nodes public so others can contribute to maintaining it, and make the blocks mined on demand (when new people are added)`
