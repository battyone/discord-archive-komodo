I mean that when I go under ""Exchange"" and select BTC on the left and ETH on the right, I don't see any orders in the ""Open Orders"" area; even if I click on the BTC/ETH tab. Doesn't matter which pairs I select I never see any open orders. If I submit an order to exchange BEER/PIZZA I see it in the open orders area. But even after leaving it sit for hours, it does not get filled. Could it be that I'm not actually connected to the Dex?";"";"";

It would be good to also remove DNR from the default coin list, so that the ""Could not connecto to DNR Electrum server"" does not cause confusion for beginners.";"";"";

Just tried it. It made no difference. On the first computer, when I go to the Exchange CHIPS/KMD page I don't see any open orders, but after about 10 minutes I see a few orders. On the second computer, I see the orders right away and more orders are listed there.";"";"";
