"360402743543988225";"lukechilds#2707";"24-Jul-18 04:55 AM";"@tolken Yeah there is, `marketmaker` is single threaded so any RPC command you call blocks the main thread. `swapstatus` is pretty slow so calling it a lot slows down `marketmaker`. Originally we were using it as a single source of truth for our app state and polling it every second and re-rendering on changes. This absolutely destroyed performance and also made `marketmaker` very unstable and prone to crashing.

We now instead subscribe to the socket event messages to read updates on the status of swaps and have some some internal logic to occasionally call `swapstatus`/`kickstart` on specific swaps that we think we maybe out of sync with or that `marketmaker` has forgotten about.

In general you should avoid calling `swapstatus`/`kickstart` alone, you should call it with `requestid`/`quoteid` arguments to only query a specific trade. We've frequently experienced crashes was querying all swaps with `swapstatus` .";"";"👌 (1),🙏 (1)";

**How fast is hyperdex compared to barterdex?**
The HyperDEX GUI and BarterDEX GUI are purely GUI implementations over the `marketmaker` daemon. They both use the same underlying library to interface with the BarterDEX network. So actual real performance should be the same. However HyperDEX communicates in a much more optimised way which should result in updates from `marketmaker` being rendered much quicker (almost realtime) compared to BarterDEX GUI.

**How long does it take to complete a trade with btc?**
Currently, while we're in alpha it's hardcoded to require 1 conf for each tx on each chain. There are 5 steps to the atomic swap protocol from Alices perspective so it's roughly (alicecoin blocktime * 2) + (bobcoin blocktime * 3). So if Alice coin is BTC (10 min blocktime) and Bob coin is KMD (1 min block time) you should expect the entire trade to take around 23 minutes.

Obviously 1 conf for all coins regardless fo hashrate is not very secure, it just makes testing easier while we're in alpha. We will change these to more sensible values and allow users to override them with their own in the future.

We are also looking into implementing secure 0-conf swaps which will allow you to make any trade regardless of blocktime in a matter of seconds. 0-conf is secured by requiring both parties lock up collateral which will be confiscated in the event anything goes wrong.";"";"👍 (1)";

It pretty much is only the lack of a third party, that's a huge benefit. At the cost of everything else. Speed and simplicity suffers so that we can get real trustless exchanges without a third party. I'm not 100% how the multisig ""DEX""s handle disputes, but there is no need for this in HyperDEX as the swap is an atomic operation. Either you get the funds you traded for, or you don't and you still have you original funds. There is no other possible outcome. (assuming the code is bug free :trollface:)";"";"👍 (1)";
