No, I'm placing ""blame"" estimate fee code on Core, because they wrote it. You asked why the fee is ""high"" and I responded specifically as to the difference.
Any wallet tools in DEX are meant for convenience and most coins don't suffer such an issue because their devs didn't code it to economically scale profits for miners.";"";"";
