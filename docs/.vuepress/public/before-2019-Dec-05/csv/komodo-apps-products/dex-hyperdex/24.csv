```

That disclaimer was more to cover our ass. Loss of funds is extremely unlikely, and as mentioned, we just use marketmaker under the hood, so if you're confident using real money with marketmaker via CLI or BarterDEX GUI then you should have just as much confidence (if not more, we fixed a lot of things) in HyperDEX.

However we did discover a very odd edge case a while ago in mm that resulted in a small loss of funds (fixed now). No code is perfect. I personally don't feel confident that marketmaker has been put under enough testing to guarantee 100% that there is no chance of loss of funds, hence the warning, but that's just me being cautious.

Remember that there is a non-negligable chance of loss of funds when using any centralised exchange.";"";"üëå (4)";

There are certain features we need to build a reliable UI that we don't have in mmv1. mmv2 is pretty much a direct rewrite of mmv1 in Rust with better support for concurrency, along with thread/memory safety and a few other things Rust gives us for free.

So it won't automatically fix all of our problems as soon as the first mmv2 version is released, although it should work much better than mmv1. It will likely still have some of the mmv1 warts due to it being a direct port. But it should mean we'll have a much more solid foundation to work with the mm dev team to get bugs fixed and new API methods and stuff added that we need that just aren't feasible with the current mmv1 codebase.

TL;DR mmv2 isn't a silver bullet that will automatically solve all our problems. But it is a required next step before we can go much further with HyperDEX development.";"";"üëç (1)";
