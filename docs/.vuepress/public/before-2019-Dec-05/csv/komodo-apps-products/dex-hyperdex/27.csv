i have a big problem with HyperDEX and
i will try it to cleare the problem in english:


at the 05.10.2018 i make a trade 73,21479399 KMD for 2.000,00293161 CHIPS
because the system dont has this complete amount, it exchange 21,69328229 KMD for 694,7906861 CHIPS   
the transaction was stop with the ErrorCode: -1007.

to this point ia already ok. 
And now comes the problem:

The 21,69328229 KMD has gone out from my wallet. 
But it`s kame no CHIPS back, no KMD back.
Also after 3 days kame no KMD or Chips back.

What can i do. This bug  is not a litle
