Do believe we  should do this slower than 1 new spot/month. Is this throwing the 75 25 lottery out the window?

We don't need this for MIA notaries if we do 75 25 lottery. Bad acting notaries can be blocked by other notaries to put them in bottom 25%

--- This is if nobody deceided to leave, or is lesss than threhold and is voted out. its not fixed at adding 1. 
--- If being a notary isnt profitable, ppl will drop out, if its profitable then the number will increase over time, until we hit 64 nodes

--- if you read what genie said, the vote is not held from stake holders, and then its up to a random. The vote is to stop sybil attack, but is not by staked holders.
