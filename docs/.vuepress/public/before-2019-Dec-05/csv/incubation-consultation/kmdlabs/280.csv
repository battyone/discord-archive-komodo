`LABST5` chain is live and ready to start being notarized.  You `MUST` be on the lastest update from a few hours ago or this chain will not work. It is 100% incompatible with old code bases. `VerusHash v1.1` that uses the equihash difficulty adjustment to make it work with PoS 64 reliably.  I think I finally have it tuned to be useable.  The difficulty on these chains with just 1 CPU core is INSANE! I encorage ppl to mine it with a core, if every notary mines this chain with just 1 core it will really help us test the notary pay is working without forking the chain.
