A visulsation of the migrate stresstest is something more benificial to HYPE and getting people to go WOW! and want to join, its a great idea, and would be nice... but not exactly required... Maybe I will speak to the marketing team, and see if they can put up some KMD for such a thing to compensate you for the time to make it. 😃 
Its really something they can use and point people to at any time. To show that migrates work at scale.";"";"";
