"133773904471785473";"daemonfox#6136";"26-Oct-19 02:32 AM";"@kevinkatovic we canmake it real simple.

1. There is way more hashrate on LABS now than when you started, therefore the 49% of blocks that can be mined with PoW (ASICs) is divided amongst more miners. Your share is diminishing in comparison to total net power. We know the cli hashrate is incorrect... its a calc against difficulty of the current block.

2. When so many PoW blocks have been found the difficulty sky rockets, and the LABS holders staking will mint most of the blocks via PoS. If you dropped a fuck ton of hash onto LABS while diff was high... you will earn shit while the stakers work through their stretch of blocks until PoW diff drops.

3. You chose to sell low before reading and learning what LABS and PoS64 is and how it works. Thats on you alone. If you did really have ~71K you should have been staking instead of dumping because this is a long term project, not a mine and dump like you have been buying into it sounds like.

4. Staking in AGAMA is EZ. Send LABS to a few different addresses in your wallet. Go to the triple lines top right, click and click Settings. Click the CLI section, make sure the pull down says LABS, and in the field below type the following phrase and click the  Execute button... setgenerate true 0

5. In the same field, delete and type getmininginfo and click Execute. The output below should have a line labeled staking:true and that means its going to do its thing. IT WONT BE IMMEDIATE you need a while to let age build before they will mint but THEY WILL MINT.";"";"";
