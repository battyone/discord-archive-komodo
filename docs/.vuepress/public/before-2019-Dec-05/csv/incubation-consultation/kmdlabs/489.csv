`I'm keen to help out wherever I can.  Will keep a closer eye on it.`

Thanks! Can never have too much support from other devs. I’ve got some other exciting stuff that will probably start getting detailed publicly a bit in two weeks or so too :). But sequential and not simultaneous is important haha. Luckily I’ve got some advisement from a good friend and colleague on the non-tech side of things";"";"";

Yeah, this doesn't seem to be a matter of censorship to me.  This just isn't the forum for those discussions.  Take it to DM, or another appropriate place.

This is the 2nd or possibly the 3rd time that the above was brought up in here.

I don't mind swearing in many contexts, but a message that is simply `f off` to someone, isn't something for what we're doing here.
