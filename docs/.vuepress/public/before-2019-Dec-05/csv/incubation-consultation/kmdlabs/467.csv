When you quit screen it stops what is running inside.
It's normal behaviour, but people perhaps are not used to that.
Perhaps you could start daemons in background, as output is still displayed normally in stdin? This way, even if an operator closes screen, daemon would still be running, even with no stdin output?";"";"";
