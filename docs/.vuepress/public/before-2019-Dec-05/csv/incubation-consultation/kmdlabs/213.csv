Sorry about this, but we also have an important update for StakedChain/komodo. This should fix all issues with migrates that were left. I have changed it so that we use the standard komodo transaction fee for imports of 0.0001 coins. This means you pay 2x this amount one for burn tx and one for import. There is nothing stopping you taking the fee out in the code, if you wish to do so, however blocks will only be maximum 2MB if everyone does this during the stress test.

We also bring down all the major bug fixes from the last few days. These are mandatory to update in a day or two or you risk forking chains, including KMD. We need to create a PoS chain and test this... Although I might do this locally first so save wasting everyone's time if my fix is no good. Nothing bad can happen for PoW chains, infact they should work better than before. :)
A simple start.sh was enough to update my notary. Staked repo nodes, will need to stop their daemons manually first. 
Thanks for all of your patience. I think this is finally close to stable. Please report any strange behaviour you find.";"";"👌 (4),Komodo (3),🆙 (2),🇩 (1),🎱 (1)";
