Had to have a nice long sleep. back today for a while, I think what I have might be useful for that, but also maybe its not. On the weekend I finally managed to get my staked notary keys working 100x better than before. They now change with era, and hte notary can identify itself, this will be helpful for many things, and the PIRATE exception for ntoary vouts, cna now be used over eras, or pubkey changes without issue. Before this was hard coded into the current elected keys. I will be testing today and publishing this code later on, maybe it will help you. I will add some more coments to it, so others can see how I managed to get it working. 

For regtest... all you should have to do its look where its doing (is_STAKED) funtion in komodo_notary.h and add another IF statment after that for regtest and its keys.";"";"";
