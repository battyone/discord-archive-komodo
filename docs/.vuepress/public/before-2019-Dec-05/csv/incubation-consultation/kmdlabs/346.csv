-----```----------- Please see https://kmdlabs.cc/p/KMDLabs_operations_proposal for context. -----------

 'If the bureaucracy grows too large the Group Consensus can cull it as needed.`

Basically this mechanism would allow people to get on with Dev work and using LABs. The elected volunteers would be given the responsibility for day-to-day matters to make this possible. The way things would work aren't all that different than now. For example, asking opinions on how to multisig or what logo looks better. The only real changes I see from now are that Labs Elected Volunteer(LEV)s would have some ability to take action through the limited trust granted to them through election by Stakers. The LEV could then make a decision based on what they have learned. LEVs serve the Group Consensus, and if their actions vary too widely from that path, then Group Consensus has the power to bring things back into line. At the moment we are still setting things up and most Dev work is focussed on Labs. That will change and people, including LEVs, will be focussed on using the Labs platform. I think the LEV jobs will loose their glamour fairly quickly when it is realized how much work will be required, while others are out there having fun. This is the nature of volunteer work.

``` 
Need to tally notarypay in connect tip, and dissconnect tip. Each time a notary pay coinbase is paid we add to total, when its been reorged we deduct total. 
Write the total to a file each time this happens.
Load the file on daemon init, and delete it if the daemon has been instructed to reindex. 
There is a burn address that uses a private key of all zeros. 
RPC will be created that checks if the amount paid is greater than the amount burnt. 
Iguana will poll this RPC at the start of a notarization round to ask if it can notarize or not. ```
In the event of a somone forgetting to top up the burn address and notarizations have stopped, we can use the notary backup import to get funds to the chain. 
I can also add the notary pay amounts to the notarizations DB, and there can be a backup that loops over the notarization DB and tallies all the amounts paid, in case of the file being corrupted. Not sure if this is even needed at all, guess feild test will tell us.";"";"🍾 (2)";

Assuming it works, it was extremly easy. I just hope I can still sync one of the notary pay chains to test it. 
All I need is the correct burn address. There is one in the code, but not sure how to check that it is actually that right now. I managed to add notarypay total to the on disk block index, so that covers all connect/dissconnect. Also managed to work out how to save segid to disk so it no longer has to be calculated for all blocks upon chain restart.";"";"";

We are testing N&K params of 77/3 on CFEKNK and notarypay with a ""burn address"" that has been funded with 200 coins. 
What should happen is that CFEKNK should stop notarizing on all notaries after 200 notarizations when the burn address runs out of funds.  When this happens we can send some more coins to the address and it should start to notarize again automagically. 
If this goes well, we have a proof of concept that allows any chain to have a block reward/coin emission that is limited by the amount of  coins burnt to an address. 
If anyone ever spends from this address the chain will no longer be able to create any coins. 
The problem is that whenever we add something to this it changes the blockindex format... so we need to reindex KMD. Hopefully I can think of a solution for this as its pretty darn annoying. Easy one is to revert the change on a special branch just for KMD and update the start scritps to use this branch for KMD...This time around I'm not doing that though, as we will be using this param for every clusterchain so we need the blockindex mod.";"";"3040_kingpeepo (1)";

Please update all repos, and RESYNC all chains  INCLUDING KMD. We have ~24H  until era change. That should be long enough for KMD to resync. Sorry about this, but rather get this over and done with. We can host a few bootstraps after this with the new block index format. I will put on up on my server ASAP, but will be a while away. It will probably be faster to just resync the chain yourself.
