So I need to start a new branch to work out of for that. It seems much easier to just stake with a seperate wallet than try and use a sperate wallet for notary node address. 
Also we will finally be able to PoW daemon mine and stake at the same time. If I can get this working, I think it solves securing 0BR chains in a reliable way. As all notary nodes can mine and stake them without affecting notary node preformance. Makes little sense to need to run multiple copies of the entie blockchain if we don't have to.";"";"";

Might need another day for CrisF to see how his node fares with a fixed wallet then increse min sigs a bit. a couple of things can happen, it will definatly make coin emission more fairly distributed to alll nodes, but also could make notarizations happen less often.
