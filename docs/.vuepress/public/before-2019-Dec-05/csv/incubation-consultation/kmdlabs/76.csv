Don't believe in ""If you build they will come"" ... need to talk to businesses/ enterprise and help them to utilise asset chains to bring efficiency in their business.. which either create new markets or help in cost saving .. In my view many cost saving use cases / proposals can help in market penetration .. as this will help in grow komodo ecosystem.. more use for the platform and more developers attracted to learn and build on komodo blockchain .. many platforms such as stellar and waves are partnering with enterprises .. komodo with current tech (some additional java script libraries to use like komodo.js to interact with asset chains)   is enough for business use case ..";"";"";

I'm not sure yet what it would look like in a practical sense, but I have several ideas informed by a long interest in the subject.

This seems possible to me in the light of the extraordinary changes in distribution over the last ten years, at least here where fully half the economy seems to be delivering very small boxes to small boxes in the sky.

Where we'll eventually get to: barter, crowd funding, import/export, eBay, Amazon.

So need to choose a small and achievable use-case, like a vanilla farmer exporting to a London ice cream makers, a Macedonian hand-huller providing sun dried apricot kernels to me, a small-run FPGA designer in Cambridge wanting funding for a new device. I'd also like some un-roasted coffee beans (import tax and duty free here) and organic cashew supplies, please.

Something that uses several techniques like escrow (obviously for crowd supply, but also export), multi-sig (perhaps a release of a proportion of funds on OK from agreed 3rd party quality control in importing country). These are just example ideas.";"";"";
