What I ended up doing here, was pretty complicated. 
Linux host (manjaro/arch linux, as I needed latest kernels etc so this was easiest.) 
Then I added a windows10 VM ontop of it with a Vega64 video card passedthough, so it cna be a gamin PC. 
Then it has a small utbuntu 16.04 base VM with ust staked and normal komodo installed. And I cna just copy that VM as many times as I like for testing various things. I used RSync to pull the komodod code in from the host, so I dont have to use git. And then SSH into the ubuntu VMs either form laptop or main PC to run the code., depending on what I need there.";"";"";
