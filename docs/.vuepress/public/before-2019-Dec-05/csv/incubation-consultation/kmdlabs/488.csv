What happens, is a split tx is created but is not mined for some reason, this then prevents the local wallet from making another split, because it thinks the utxo used to split is spent in mempool. 
But no other nodes see this tx, and it never gets mined. 
I caused the spam of spent utxo, by forgetting to stop it from checking mempool for unspents. 
The ""fix"" we have, doesnt actually fix the real issue, but it works around it, by making sure that all utxo selected have 5 confirms and are not spent.";"";"";

@blackjok3r  and I had a good chat about BLUR and dPoW . Something I’ll be doing here very soon (probably tomorrow) Is typing up a flow diagram for code comprehension, and of the higher up stuff for the less code-savvy too. It’s been a crap ton of code, but it’s very close to being fully operational. About 90% of the work done, I’d venture.
