Large update pushed to master. I also changed `update_komodo.sh` to use `build.sh` instead of `make` so it technically now should actually build almost every time even with makefile changes. But no promises. :abusedsmily:  This update is mostly for nodes who are mining, but please update if you can, and report any errors you see. I think this went pretty smoothly.  We are now equal with jl777/FSM and upstream has nearly all of our code in it, with some parts deactivated. Congrats all who helped us get here.  üöÄ";"";"üöÄ (4),3040_kingpeepo (2),labs (3)";
