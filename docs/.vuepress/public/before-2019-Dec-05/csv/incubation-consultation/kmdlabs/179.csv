While being a centralised service, a node running each daemon could pretty easily track all burns and imports to track where the coins are going, and post this data to an oracle. This can then be leveraged by a modified explorer to link cross chain txns in a visual way. Not really sure how best to do it. We should have enough people in here to figure it out though. Should be a good aim for this project to keep this goal in mind when designing the system.";"";"";
