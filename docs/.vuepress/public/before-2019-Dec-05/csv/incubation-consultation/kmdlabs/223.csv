@jl777c 
This was the change I ended up with to make it move... I have a feeling it has to do with how VerusHash calculates its nBits for the block, changing that was far too hard, as it would have broken PoW.  So I modified the existing coinage multiplierr you have to cap PoS block times. IF there is a better way to solve this please point me in the right direction.";"";"";
