Then I need to do some special math to make sure that iguana and `migrate_completeimporttransaction` are using some standard heights.
 I think that for iguana it should be asking for KMD height -5, and then the daemon should take that height (in MoMoMdata RPC) , and keep counting down until it gets to the closest height that is an even 5. ( height % 5 == 0 )
Then when we do the `migrate_completeimporttransaction`  it shuold find the KMD height its looking for currently, then do much the same thing, but I think forwards.  It needs to scan forwards tothe closest KMD block that   ( height % 5 == 0 ) 
Once again, the problem is stemming from the timing of the MoMoM calculation. It assumes perfect conditions, and with PoS chains that does not happen. ight be possible to not need this modulo 5 thing, going to try a bruteforce, of completing import transaction with multiple heights, like scan around the height it comes up with, and use heights around that then try sending the tx on the target with all the generated transactions. 

The assumption libscottr made that there wasn;t more than 1 assetchain notarization on KMD in each block, is the entirte reason this has not worked from the beginning. He said making iguana wait for a confirm before sending the next one, would be all it needs, but he forgot about reorgs, and mempool propagation times. So that simply doesnt work. We need another solution, which I am very close to.";"";"";
