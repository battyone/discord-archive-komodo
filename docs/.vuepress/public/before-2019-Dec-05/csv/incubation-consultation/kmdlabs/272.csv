Let notaries be dynamic, set their pay % on the chain, every 2 months notaris can leave or enter as they see fit based on costs just liek miners... If a notary cannot do their job they just drop out... If notaries are killing it, more just join. Dont really need a vote or anything, because we are jsut paid to notarise. The value of the coin will determine how many notaries there are.. 

Make the bounty system seperate with a multisig for that. Notaries job is to notarise. By letting basically anyone be one upto a limit of 64 you solve the collusion problem also. There is only 1 possible thing that can stop this working and I already know how to fix it, and will not be disclosing what it is until it is fixed 😄";"";"";

3) the genral election is run where the 2 spots are given out. Maybe a short list is voted by that is then chosen at random. 

This prevents the thing growing too fast beyond what it can sustain. As is a notary cannot fill their obligation they are replaced by a new voted in node. If it is growing, and it nobody wants to leave we still have the 2 spots. After this stage, when we get to 64 (if we get there) we use a yearly election same as KMD.
