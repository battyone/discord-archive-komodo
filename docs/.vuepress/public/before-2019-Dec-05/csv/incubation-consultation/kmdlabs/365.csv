    - The range of addresses paid is determined by the last notarized block hash before the snapshot height, which is every 1440 blocks. the top and the bottom(3999th) address cannot be paid. 
    - snapshot = 1440, notarised freq = 10. ~ 144 notarizations between snapshots. 
    - The object of the game is to have balance in the range when the payment is released. 
    - Anyone can release half or more of the  the payment, 20 blocks after the snapshot. 
    - The balance of your addresses at the notarized height will deternmine what rank on the rich list you are. 
    - If you move coins after this, you still get paid the same amount. All you can do is release the previous days mined coins to the set range. 
    - You can release half the funds, locking the other half until the next snapshot.
    - I guess you could fund the plan with extra coins but they would be locked there for 1460 blocks, so the next snapshot would have happened by then, changeing the range.
