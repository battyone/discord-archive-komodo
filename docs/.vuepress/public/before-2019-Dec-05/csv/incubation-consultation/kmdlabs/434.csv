Fee only: 1.15% or less
BTC payouts are processed once a day for balances above 0.0025
Payouts for all other currencies are made automatically every 4 hours for balances above 0.05 and balances more than 0.0125 are included in one of the payouts each day.

- Sample configurations -
To mine and get paid in LABS:
```-a equihash -o stratum+tcp://equihash.mine.zpool.ca:2142 -u LABS_ADDRESS -p c=LABS,zap=LABS``` 
Exchange to BTC:
```-a equihash -o stratum+tcp://equihash.mine.zpool.ca:2142 -u BTC_ADDRESS -p c=BTC```
Exchange to BTC but mine only LABS:
```-a equihash -o stratum+tcp://equihash.mine.zpool.ca:2142 -u BTC_ADDRESS -p c=BTC,zap=LABS```
