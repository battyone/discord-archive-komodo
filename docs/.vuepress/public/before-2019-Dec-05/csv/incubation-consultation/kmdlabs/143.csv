Theory is this, When you are the only staker this happens a lot, less so with more nodes.
The ram staker loads every 10 minutes from the wallet, but there is no way for it to clear a tx after its choses that I can see. So it can select one twice. Of course this means that the second time its chosen the block is invalid. 
Then when it disconnects tip, it removes the chosen tx from the wallet by force, with EraseTransaction (the same as I used in my wallet cleaner)
This means that the valid staked utxo now has been removed from the wallet and cannot be an input for the next tx seen.";"";"";

 Could you please give a `yea` or `nay` on the following. 
It's based on the submission that received the most positive feedback with a change of letter coloring, as was suggested.
The below are all the same logo, just set on different backgrounds to give an idea of how it will look.

All we really need is location information on the fishing vessel which is a GPS signal.  The skipper can issue a blanket barcode or QR code for the complete haul.  Sensors will transmit temperature and other data while on the fishing vessel. Then at port the fish will be processed and packed. At port individual package codes are generated at the palleting stage and uploaded to the blockchain.  Tracking continues for onward transportation by associating the smaller package Bar/QR Codes with the pallets (or equal) they are riding on or in until final delivery to the retail store. (This is in the case of fish, similar sequences apply for other products).  We can bribe the retail consumer with a few AXO's to scan and report their purchase or oonsumption of the fish with our smart phone ""Report App"" that signals to the Oracle that the supply chain is complete.  When the retail store receives the shipment payment can be triggered via a number of possible events all of which are reported by the oracle to the blockchain.  One possible event is crossing a ""geofence"" our user would set up on our platform.  (The geofence comes to us via an API from our GPS and cell network signal partner.";"";"";
