"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"15-Oct-18 05:18 AM";"but that is 32 8kb transactions per second, so not crazy";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"15-Oct-18 05:18 AM";"Although we could use something like TxBlaster, as the chat chain has basically unlimited free coins";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"15-Oct-18 05:18 AM";"of course, I assumed you would modify txblaster so it added an 8kb opreturn";"";"";

Need to go do some tohter stuff, when I get back tonight I will try and add 8kb opreturn to txbalster.. .we cn jsut se the TROLL chain.. and if we break it or make it too big, can just delete it and start a new one.";"";"";

"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"15-Oct-18 05:26 AM";"yea so apparently it's possible to mine txs with multiple OP_RETURN outputs in them, but they will be RejectFromMemoryPool'd by vanilla nodes";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"15-Oct-18 05:27 AM";"That really doesnt matter, as this chain breaks consensus rules as it is, just change that?";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"15-Oct-18 05:28 AM";"if using a really massive TX with multiple op_return it will be easier to keep the stream at max badnwidth on the sending side";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"15-Oct-18 05:29 AM";"Ah so apparently 100kb is just the max for a ""standard"" tx";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"15-Oct-18 05:30 AM";"meaning you can mine txs up to the block size, but again they'd be RejectFromMemoryPool'd by vanilla nodes";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"15-Oct-18 05:31 AM";"@jl777c what do you think is best route to take? Many smaller transactions or smaller amount of massive txs?";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"15-Oct-18 05:32 AM";"current oracles wouldn't support many OP_RETURNS in one tx";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"15-Oct-18 05:32 AM";"yes true .... we shoud probably just use it as is ... rather than try and change it ?";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"15-Oct-18 05:32 AM";"maybe we just change the limit on a single OP_RETURN?";"";"";

"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"15-Oct-18 05:35 AM";"so maybe we don't need a new chain for each stream";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"15-Oct-18 05:38 AM";"just use one opreturn";"";"";

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"15-Oct-18 05:39 AM";"if you can slam a bunch of 8kb opreturn and get 256kb/sec bandwidth, we can do decentralized streaming";"";"";

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"15-Oct-18 05:40 AM";"the webcam video will have some logical size per opreturn and it might be a bit more or less than 8kb, that is ok. there is some leeway";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"15-Oct-18 05:40 AM";"and it doesnt really give you more bandwidth to have 8kb single opreturns or 100kb multiple opreturns";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"15-Oct-18 05:40 AM";"what matters is how fast the blocks can confirm (assuming the blocks are full)";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"15-Oct-18 05:41 AM";"because if the block is full of data, how much does it matter if it is in 8kb increments or 80kb or 800kb?";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"15-Oct-18 05:41 AM";"in fact, you should get slightly higher throughput with the smaller one due to more fitting into a block";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"15-Oct-18 05:41 AM";"bandwidth stuff doesnt work exactly like other things";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"15-Oct-18 05:41 AM";"the way it's set up now, it will mine a block as soon as there's a single tx in mempool";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"15-Oct-18 05:41 AM";"fine";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"15-Oct-18 05:41 AM";"lesss transactions = more payment though, or does that not apply to op_rteturn?";"";"";

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"15-Oct-18 05:42 AM";"so there is no issue";"";"";

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"15-Oct-18 05:47 AM";"just where it makes the tx, add an opreturn to it";"";"";
