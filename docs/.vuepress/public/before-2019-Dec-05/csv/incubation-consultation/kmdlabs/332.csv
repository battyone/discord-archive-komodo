```shell
komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKDIMXY3 migrate_checkburntransactionsource e8da42411b9d01e555b185559a3176ed44ceea7277a8a2ae1a6460e7f8b85743
```
take the TXOutProof hex from that( its pretty big) then use like this:
```shell
komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKDIMXY4  migrate_createnotaryapprovaltransaction e8da42411b9d01e555b185559a3176ed44ceea7277a8a2ae1a6460e7f8b85743 TxOutProof(from last step)```
then use `komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKDIMXY4  sendrawtransaction ` to send the returned hex value. 
Please post your txids to me here and I will test the import, I need 4 more apart from this one I made:";"";"👍 (1)";

Community outnumbers devs 2:1, performace as top NN = demonstrated involement/reliability. This group has most to lose if SHTF, so least likely to cause a ruckus. 

Spread funds into 6/8 Mulitsig addresses: potential loss if 3 people absent or colluding for ransom. 

9 multisig addresses total. Mitigates loss to 11% of overall funds if 3 disappear/collude. 30% if 4 or 5 do. 6 unlocks 11%, and risks/ransom loss of extra 44%.
