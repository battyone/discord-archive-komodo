A new social movement in Mexico is willing to create the first Decentralized Political Party (right now its just a citizens organization) willing to implement the blockchain as main platform for all their activities. I am going to help them and this will be made in stages, so the first one will be to create a Social Network using Komodo Platform. I have heard that a chat has been created and James thinks we can improve it and convert it into a social platform, any comments or input on that? Also I would like to know if there are anyone who would be willing to collaborate with this project?

I think that you'll be able to find people who would be interested in helping 😀 
We do have  a blockchain based chat called TROLLBOX.
You can find it here https://github.com/StakedChain/trollbox .
The developer of it is away at the moment but I think he would be very interested in your ideas on expanding it into a social app.
Some of the other should be able to tell you more about it in the meantime.";"";"";
