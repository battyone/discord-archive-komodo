The very basic explanation in three steps is:

* Set up a payment channel with your denominations (10k satoshi in this case)
* Optionally, wait for the payment channel to be notarized by Komodo onto Bitcoin for bitcoin level security
* Send out transactions to those payment channels to be spent like any other type of transaction, one at a time or in multiples, to the destination of your choosing
```
