Just amke sure CCID is same as LABST5/RE and the chain is called `CFEK<something we havent used>` and it will work. Any params are fine on CFEK. To make it fungible it just needs same `ac_cc=` as the current 2 chains.";"";"";

this way we can run a notary and stake on the same node, or even test. Without affecting notarisations. While working with BTC 0.17 code base today it looks perfectly possiblem, but the way they implemented it, breaks many existing RPC calls and things.. I think we can use it just to load the notarisation wallet though and leave everything else as normal... May be harder than it seems. Its not something we will need at launch.";"";"";
