I think your nodes are not yet updated. Can you please update ASAP to use TOR. This is just a test to see what it does and if its a viable very simple solution to make notarization counts distributed more to OP reaction and skill than node location, if it works, we dont need to enforce regions or any make any crazy code changes to iguana. So far it seems that nodes using tor are basically cut off from the network, as the recvmask is decided by your nodes before our packets are received.";"";"👍 (2)";
