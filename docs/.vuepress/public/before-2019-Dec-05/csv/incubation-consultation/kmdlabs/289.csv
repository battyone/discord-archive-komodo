I have just updated with 2 new chains, and killed all the rest. Not sure what ones could sync and what couldn't. These two chains are on notarypay_new branch for those of you not using the staked or StakedNotary repos. I wont be merging this code to master until its verified to work. There are 2 chains, one with eras and one without. We need to make sure CFEKDEAD is notarized before block 3000 and the era changes. Once thats verified to work, Alright can attack it. 
If the attack still can cause the chain to fork (not sync) the only other fix I can add is to  add the notarized txid to the checkpoint data. Then the calculation for this can check if the notarization exists in its current chain or not. This will make sure the chain syncs 100% of the time under attack conditions.
Problem we are trying to solve here is the following:
Someone 100% attacks a chain, and mines a block with a notarization, then reorgs it out of their chain, then confirms a later notarization. This has the effect of creating a checkpoint on nodes who are online when the reorg happens (and receive the block) But then when they sync the chain this checkpoint no longer exists as it sees, the later notarization first.

With the bug fixed to only allow 1 notarization per block, and the mining code choosing always the oldest notarization in its mempool, it should now be quite safe from this attack. I also delayed the calcuation for notary pay by a checkpoint. So that the amount paid is now calculated from the previous notarized height and the notarized height previous to that again. Really this attack is a death blow to notarizations, So to prevent this, we need to use PoS% and never let a situation where a chain has only a single miner who controlls what the chain is. 0BR chains, so far have never been attacked in this way. Another ""fix"" is to remove invalidateblock from the daemon to stop ppl doing it so easilty 😆";"";"👍 (3)";
