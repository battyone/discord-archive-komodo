"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"04-Mar-19 08:21 AM";"I think the problem basically comes down to, if you go too fast with notarizations... then the range between each one, does not contain a MoM hash for the other chains. Thats it. So by making iguana skip a round of MoMoM is null... combined with using older notarizations, and a larger range... it just might work 🤞";"";"🤞 (1)";

The MoM hash that is submitted could under a rare circumstance not actually be correct due to reorgs.. Really the entire thing needs to drop back 1 notarization. I have written some functions that will make this possible, but I will need help to get some others to be able to use that....";"";"";

"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"04-Mar-19 11:46 AM";"Ok, looks like I have something here... Its only working for LAB cluster right now... but its working. 
I have a way for iguana to cancel a round if MoMoM is NULL.
And it now uses a range of 3 notarizations for each MoMoM hash, to stop rare condition of 2 notarization in the same block of KMD meaning there is no MoMoM range.  I dont think this will cause any issues, but we will need to test it.. I don't think that anything consensus related is changed, definatly as long as no notaries resync the chain we should be safe for the time being.  
The trick herre is to use notarized data, but chaging all this at once will be difficult.  So we need to start with simple things like this. If we can have overlapping MoMoM hashes and imports still work, then I think its totally possible to easily fix it. If overlapping MoMoM ahsh do not work, then welll... becomes a LOT harder.";"";"🤞 (2)";

Please `./stop.sh` `./start.sh` You can just do start.sh, but due to iguana being updated, your iguana TV will move the the terminal you run start.sh in.  Migrates may not be working on CFEK cluster with this fix, I'm not really sure. Just need to test overlapping MoMoM hash.";"";"👍 (2)";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"04-Mar-19 11:55 AM";"This fix will allow a chain to start but also never allow NULL MoMoM hash except the first 3 notarizations on the chain. From my testing, whenever an import failed, there was a NULL MoMoM hash on the target. This pevents this happening. So if it is gettin NULL for some exact reason, and it cannot be fixed just just skipping a notarization round. Notarizations will simply stop, hopefully allowing analysis of why its failing.";"";"";
