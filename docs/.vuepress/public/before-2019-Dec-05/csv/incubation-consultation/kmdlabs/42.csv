Might take another day yet. However I am taking it slow and thinking it through trying to make the least amount of changes as I can. Right now I have it so that the coinbase TX can only be mined by the ac_pubkey as a conesnsus rule, but anyone who mines also mines to that pubkey. So I need to add the notary miner to that, so they also need the private key. 
what I have so far is:
1. every block generated under 128 makes 2 p2pk utxo's and every block over  128 makes 1.
2. both these p2pk are to ac_pubkey as a consesnus rule, unless the ac_pubkey owner gives anyone coins, no body else can make transactions. 

This I assume will be launched similar to how Alright designed the oracles and assetchains.json. The dAPP user pays the notaries and funds them, and there is some kind of setting for when the chain is to be stopped being notarised, and then it can be removed from al notaries.";"";"";
