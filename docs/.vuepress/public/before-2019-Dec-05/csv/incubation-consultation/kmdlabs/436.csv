Wallets

CLI wallet – As the CLI (Command Line Interface) wallet is an integral part of most tests conducted in KMDLabs it is recommended that one become familiar with it.

The KMDLabs Notary Node CLI wallet is one of the areas that has undergone a fair amount of development work.  Methods of wallet ‘cleaning’ and DWY attack prevention, resistance and recovery have been a particular area of research and development.

The CLI wallet is currently the only method for staking the LABS coin. Staking is simple as setgenerate true 0. For more advanced staking strategies scripts that work in conjunction with the CLI wallet are available in the KMDLabs Github repo.

3rd party GUI wallets – For those that prefer a GUI wallet LABS can be used with the VERUS Agama GUI wallet.  Further 3rd party wallet partnerships are being sought and and any inquiries regarding adding LABS are welcome.

Exchange wallets – It is NOT recommended to keep LABS in exchange wallets for anything more than immediate trading.  Currently this is possible on Graviex and shortly on the ZADDEX exchange.

GUI / Wallet Development – KMDLabs will be developing a GUI wallet in the future, although this is not a priority.  GUI devs / devs who are interested in building and testing in this area are very welcome to get in touch.
