It seems a simple `gettxoutsetinfo`  will be the easierst way to detect burnt coins, and then usign the new data from james change earlier we can locate the export tx on the source chain. 
So you run the RPC on a block, it returns the blocktime, the total amount imported in that block, and an array of these for each import tx:
```    {
      ""txid"": ""57afa5f7750029709ec224e63528eba997f6865598c7bfc6c5fb7324f3e7b62e"",
