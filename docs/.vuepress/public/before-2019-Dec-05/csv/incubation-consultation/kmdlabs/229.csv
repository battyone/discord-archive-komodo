```
AlrightToday at 10:16 AM
so the way I see it at least
dev makes a contract, PRs to stakedchain/komodo, starts a CFEK chain
we do simple tests on it, like get all the easy bugs out of the way
then they are free to start a LAB/LABS chain with it
people can use it if they like, but should understand that it could be risky for their coins either by malicious code or broken code
people can also submit bug bounty claims if they can show a reproducible issue
I think bug bounty should only be paid once fixed
so the tester would have to work with the dev to fix it before they receive anything
that way if dev abandons it, we aren't making coins for bug fixes in their abandoned contract
also maybe time locks for the bounty
so if it's a significant amount of LABS, it doesn't get dumped immediately
