Well I figured a pool being able to stake would be fine, Although at some point it should stake and mine at once, but its not that useful for most chains... Unless they use a CPU algo of some kind daemon mining isnt really useful at all.";"";"";

Well the staking loop needs to be inside its own thread and it needs a diffrent way to be switched on and off, that way PoW mining can have some threads aswell.. but once I got staking working this good, I really didnt want to touch it again, it was no easy task to get it in a usable state.";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"08-Jul-19 01:14 PM";"And a pool that switches only when diff wall is down, is well... I dont know what that would do to the chain, I think it would effectivly over time reduce PoW difficulty.";"";"";
