    `uint256 MoMoM = CalculateProofRoot(symbol, ccid, kmdheight, moms, destNotarisationTxid);`
     must check that the first notarization it is using is itself notarized on KMD. 
     lastnotarized height function will be safe enough (better still is to use DB and count back 2 nota of KMD, as this makes sure the nota is in the chain on resync)
        notarized height is faster, DB slower, its safe to assume all notaries are online, and as such cannot reorg past the last notarized height. 

need to add a bool falg to notarization class that sets and locks to true after 3 nota happened for an asset chain on the KMD daemon.  
iguana needs an error from MoMoMdata RPC on KMD when MoMoM cannot be detemined from above. this enable nota round to bail out until needed data is there.
    checking for last 2 nota made are confirmed and notarized and so cannot be reorged. we then use these 2 determinate data points to create MoMoM hash.
    the first 3 notarizations must have a null MoMoM returned to iguana, and not the error, to make sure that enough MoM  hash exist to get a determinate MoMoM hash

I think that what I tried didnt work, too agressive the other way,. Pushed fix to use just kmdheight -5 in iguana. 
Due to the sledghammer MoMoM fix, we can delay MoMoM hashes and the target chain can still locate them. This is working currently, but if notarization on KMD are too far apart we are losing MoM hashes. Migrates still work, but the are extremely slow (like 1H each migrate). and I dot have time to wait to test this, seems to not work so we need to try something simpler.
This is a very simple change, that makes some assumptions, but its far safer than what it was doing before.  If this proves stable we can work on making it make less assumptions. 

I am updating my notary now with this fix and have to leave town for the night. It would be really helpful if you guys can update and then loop migrates to test and log import fails.  You are spcifically looking for the `sendrawtransaction` step to on the target chain (last step) to fail with `momom-check-fail` But give it a good hour at least of polling it before giving up and logging it as a fail. The script here is a good example and is what I am using with some small changes.
