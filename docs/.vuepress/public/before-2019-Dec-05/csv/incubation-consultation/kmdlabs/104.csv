jl777 wants a bug tested: Who puts up a bounty? JL or NN? Who pays for the bounty?
Bountysize is communicated by the NN.
Developers see the list of current bounties and then decide which one has the best work/reward ratio.
NN decide whether or not the devwork/testing was enough and grant the bounty to dev.
Dev receives the bounty in LABS (?)
Dev wants to buy ramen noodles for family -> who will give kmd/btc/usd for his LABS so he can pay bills?

My original thought was: In step 1 jl first buys LABS with btc/kmd/usd and gives the LABS to NN which tie it up in a smart contract only to be released when enough notaries sign it. This way because someone always needs to buy LABS to have testing done and it gets value from demand.";"";"";

they create a chain
burn the premine about of this chain on main LABS chain
fund the notaries on their new chain with premine amount(notaries can choose what they want to be paid), 
testers transfer some amount of LABS to the new chain to use in testing
Tester finds a bug. 
Tester posts a bounty claim via oracles on main chain. 
Notaries discuss whether this claim is fair. If it is, they sign off on it. New coins are created and given to tester. The amount of coins that can be created in this process is limited on a weekly basis.";"";"";
