The noyta stats are being thown off for the iguana by testing all these chains that are in non working state... CFEKAPW on y node just does not wotk, iguana cannot seeutxo... but my node is still near top in ranks... As I expected, a rotaing even of 24H isnt enough data I just pulled this with stats.py on LABS:
```Please specify chain: LABS
