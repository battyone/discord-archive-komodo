I will spend probably another 15h on it today now I've had some sleep. I understand things arr not working great with the previous fix, but I have a new one that closes all known attack vectors with iguana and Also forces all nodes to agree to the average of the last 10 revcvmasks. This means that all online and working nodes must wait for all the nodes to respond to them before best mask is decided. If this works without breaking things with large amounts of nodes it will he a matter of days. If u really want u can try going back to an older commit.";"";"游똂 (1),labs (2)";

1) iguana  working with blocknotify for all dpowd coins. which means it no longer has to poll getchaintip constantly hundreds of times a second. (also it will update chaintip as soon as vblock arrives, reducing nodes starting dpow round at diffent times) 
2) revcmask is required to have X nodes matching before they will create bestmask. This has a few issues though as I need some way of tracking the online nodes so it has a target to aim at. 
3) almost have notariesfastverify from nSPV working in iguana, so if a notary is submitting bad sigs and breaking notarizations we cna ban them temporarily.";"";"";
