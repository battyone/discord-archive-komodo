This *should* work. After using sendtoaddress it will reset the cache. Still quite limited fix, but it should at least prevent sendtoaddress crashing the daemon, or making iguana use spent utxos. 
Again with cache wallet reset and merge of mined funds isnt really required untl you have vast numbers of utxos.,";"";"";

This seems reasonable, but most of the time 80% + of nodes are actually working.... I think after one block passes on KMD if 80% of nodes cannot agree it drops back to 50%";"";"";
