My todo list for LABS right now is 
test joker's qt wallet on osx, windows and linux
test out viability of using VRSC's utxo splitter for pos64 staking 
test pos64staker on windows/osx and clean it up in general 
get LABS added to atomicdex mobile and run some bobs
speak with joker on progress of lotto CC, this is likely ""ready enough"" for a LABS chain 

Also, I realize prices CC focus kind of died down. Tony and I had been leading this effort, but atomicdex and nspv testing took precedence. We're likely to boot this up again, but we need to do  quite a bit of prep work to get it ready for a LABS chain. Have a feeling this will have to wait until after nspv testing as jl is focused mostly on nspv for the time being. 

If there is anything else that needs doing, please just let me know. Should have HempCoin fully settled within a few days, and have some more time to devote to LABS.";"";"";
