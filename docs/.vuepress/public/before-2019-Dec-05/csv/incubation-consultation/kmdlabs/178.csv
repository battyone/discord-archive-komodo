renting a server to test out from packet.net hourly for a few days is the cheapest way to test with internal network (NAT) but for a routed network with public addresses, hetzner server bidding have $0 setup.   Sometimes you can find 32GB RAM for <25EU although no SSD.

OneProvider offers 8 core atom servers for $15USD, but i had a lot of trouble with public addresses in their network setup.  Vultr have 20c/hr SSD servers, i think you an provision extra public IPs.

One of the Komodo Pioneers test boxes (maybe 16GB RAM)  might be able to be wiped for a small donation to the public community meet up fund and we'll tweet out the collaboration 😉";"";"";
