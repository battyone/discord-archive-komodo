"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"04-Mar-19 03:43 AM";"To me, the validation of the import transaction is wrong. Instead of sending the MoMoM hash inside the import itself it should just be verifiing the TXID against the MoMoM hashes....The current way its doing ti is stupid... and makes little sense at all. I've thaught about this a lot... and making the MoMoM hash always line up 100% of the time doesnt seem possible.";"";"";

This is how I thaught it was actaully working in the first place, but I know know this to not be the case... Its just looping the notarizations looking for a matchins MoMoM hash... which quite simply it will never always find, because there is 0 chance that they are always exacrly the same.";"";"";

It simply creates the MoMoM hash then compares that its equal ... there is no magical maths invloved really... So we are left with 2 options, using a frequency so large that there is almost 0 chance of something overlapping... like 15 or even 20 blocks...
