It builds out on the new start.sh to also update komodod, and will allow a staked chain to use a seperate branch of komodod, which allows a single chain to take a CC contract without having all chains require it to be activated.
```1) check git for latest commit / commit we are on.
2) if needs update build komodo with this update, and if successful then continue with start.sh.
3) add parameter to assetchains.json and make sure all scripts are backwards compatible, should be able to add to exception for freq.
4) check the new branch for latest commit/commit current staked chain is on, and build if required. Save the commit hash with the compiled binary below.
5) copy each komodod built to StakedNotary/komodo/$chain/komodod and komodo-cli

There is now pretty much every combination of pass/fail I can think of. So adding a new chain should be seemless, there is no chance dPoW will be called or the coin added to iguana if longestchain cannot be found. This seems to be the best way to know if the chain is in a stable condition. From earlier tests we also know adding dPoW to chains  under 128 blocks is a bad idea, so it wont allow chains under that to be added. 
I am assuming that `start.sh` is something that will be rn periodically. so if a chain has an issue, it will just be added on the next round provided that issue has been resolved by some person that noticed the chain add failed and rectified the issue.";"";"";
