Will work the same as commision and ac_pubkey, except pay to an address. (can me multisig, and hopefully a CC contract address also to fund a contract from block reward!)
Founders reward will differ from comission, because it will only be a percentage of the block reward, and will not take into account any txs.
Hopefully I can get this working tomorrow. 🤞";"";"";

I need to try and prove or disprove it., but not entirly sure how to ge the data I need, it appears that a notarisation tx sent to KMD for a chain, can sit in the mempool, and then be included either out of order or have 2 notariations in the same block. Because staked notaries do not have precedence on KMD chain for transacions, like the KMD notaries do, sometimes our txs can sit in mempool for a while, allowing this to happen. 

When doing the validation against KMD to create the import transaciton, it calculates MoMoM hashes until it gets a valid one, signs the tx with that then gives back the transaction, making the assumption, that the valid MoMoM hash it used, will be the same one as the MoMoM hash sent to the target chain.";"";"";

We need to start a new testnet with the break; removed from the above peice of code. I have done a sucessful migrate with it removed and it does not break anything. However if we get a condition where 2 notarisations happen from 1 chain into a single KMD block, it will no longer skip counting one of those. This allows us to revert back to a fast frequency, maybe even faster than 5, to mass test migrates... We need to get this happeing asap, so a few of us can all run mighrate loops for a few days, We should get as close as we can to full blocks of migrates, and also cycle GPU on and off one of the chains, to cause unstable and random block times.";"";"";
