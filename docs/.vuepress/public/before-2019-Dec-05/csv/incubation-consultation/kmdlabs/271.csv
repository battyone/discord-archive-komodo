In reality notarisation dont always happen, so they would still get paid some small amount.But its insignificant in the scheme of things.

If my math is correct this chain would cost ~1200 LABS to last an entire year, with 1000 of that being held by the chains creator to stake on the chain, they can recover this for something else at any time. The other 200 is paid to notary nodes for ntoarisation, mayeb 200 LABS a year is too low, but I think its the minimum viable amount., with 20 notaries.

The staked value only needs to be very small, likely the 1000 LABS to start the chain will not even need to remain on the chain long term, its up to the chain creator to do whatever they like here. Once the chain has no stakers it will simply stop moving and can be removed from the cluster, as per my proposal for handling this. Also we have a way to add a chain to a banned list, if a VOTE decides that a chain should be dropped OR  bug effecting coin emission is found. Notaries can just stop notarising a chain if they see fit to do so I guess as well.. 
If notaries stop notarising then the chain is effectivly no longer fungible... There is not really any way to enforce this this, it will be up to each notary. Hopefully they all keep notarising everything if they can. A vote can be had to remove or add notaries at basically any time (maybe min 2 months since last vote, as to not happen too often and cause problems and waste ppls time)";"";"";

We also need to test ac_notarypay does not break MoMoM so with the main chain test, and he current LABSTPAY chain we need to run migrate loops for a few days while logging fails. It doenst need to be full blocks or anything, just 1 export in each block, like earlier tests. I think I can probably set up a VM to do this on my own, but more ppl testing provides better data.";"";"";

Users designate their vote stake to a notary (or group of notaries), changeable after locktime expiry of 2 months or so. That way no crypto-citizen misses out on sufferage through absence, and voting isnt a constant obligation. set and forget until a notary pisses you off or makes an impression - then reallocate.";"";"";
