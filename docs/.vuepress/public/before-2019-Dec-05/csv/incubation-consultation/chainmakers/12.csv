Barterlly is now open on BETA mode, and will provide tools for users and CoinOwners to perform OTC trades in a safe way.
Any KMD assetchain dPowed will be listed, and supported, for free.
Other coins not already listed can submit a listing application at : https://barterlly.typeform.com/to/iqpS1H
During the BETA, Barterlly won't charge any fee other than the transaction ones. after the release we will charge 1% on top of every transaction.
Our goal is to provide premium tools for coins listed on the platform. (Discord swapbot, twitter integration, public orders, wallet integration, API, custom templating, and many more).
Feel free to join us on our Discord.
https://discord.gg/RHc95zw
The app link is located at : https://app.barterlly.io
We are open to suggestions, and partnerships.

See you soon !

to setup the smartchains by yourself, there is no cost: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/installations/creating-asset-chains.html

to have the process in the above doc done  automatically, along with various services, we have a blockchain builder coming soon (web portal and aws managed vps used to create the chains), will also have spv servers, explorers etc., - yet to launch, prices to be announced
^^^ all the above can be done as DIY by a capable developer

To add dPoW, there are additional costs

atleast 365 KMD + 365 coin to be notarized + integration costs";"";"";

the prices are not public currently
but  its currently several thousand dollars for a smart chain (i.e., a chain created using Komodo)

for an external chain that is  a BTC fork, there are additional costs of adding the dPoW code to their coin and a security audit
prices will be made public with the auto blockchain builder coming soon";"";"";
