The issue was when bobdeposit takes a long time to confirm, bob was immediately waiting for alicepayment, but alice didnt send alicepayment until bobdeposit confirmed. If bobdeposit took longer than 30 minutes (for non-BTC) to confirm, the swap would stop after alicepayment. please update and let me know if it works properly. you should see some waiting for bobdeposit on the bob side now. it is only in jl777 branch until I get confirmation it is working";"";"👍 (1)";
