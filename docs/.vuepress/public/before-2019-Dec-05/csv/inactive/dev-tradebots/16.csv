old version used to copy this coins.json file on every startup to make sure the user's data directory has this coins.json.
I deleted the BarterDEX application's icons images, and it's old coins.json file, and any electrum list .js file managed in that code.
from dev point of view it makes it less confusing where actually a 3rd party dev has to contribute to add a coin. That was my intended reason to delete these old files from the source code.

Since coinsdb feature added, it is set to check by conditions if the coins.json exists or not in data directory. if not, it sets up with default coins list.
if exists it just shows those coins in manage coins screen on left panel.";"";"";
"347922216429813760";"grewalsatinder#9653";"11-Jul-18 08:48 AM";"left panel drop down uses git repo's image path, the http path.
the list under there uses local file system path which uses the images from the local data directory images.

@blackjok3r the coinsdb is ONLY loaded on startup, or in the case if the user pushes the button to fetch the latest database update. it is working as intended. you can take a look to the coinsdb js files to clear on the logic.

continuing on the no images logic... since the source files doesn't has the images, and in case it is using the old coins.json data from previous versions it tries to check on those images, which aren't there since those aren't requested to have in coinsdb. It also helps indicate that the ones which aren't showing the icons, either doesn't have the icons on the coinsdb git repo or they aren't actually set properly in your local coins.json/barterdex localStorage data, and needs fixing.

So, to reset these old version coins.json the simplest way is to reset it. For that I provided the quick reset button to make it lil convenient.

I did not get any help in creating any of the user action flow or code logic etc with this feature so far.
Except some code clean and other things done by @ComputerGenie (which I highly appreciate).
I could only do little much of whatever I could think of and just made it happen. To my opinion, it's good to have something as solution than nothing. and hitting the 256 maximum coins limit was my deadline, we already hit it, and I had to make something. So here is this coded feature.

I encourage the other developers in this community like you and others, to fiddle with the code and please push the improvements.
