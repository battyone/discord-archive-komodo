It's mentioned as `benefit` at wiki that Liquidity provider doesn't need to pay the fee: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki/Be-a-marketmaker-or-bob-using-barterDEX-CLI#benefits-of-being-an-lp-node.";"";"";
"371114647052615681";"Mylo#8306";"16-Dec-18 01:47 AM";"@artem.pikulin let me try. 
Currently Alice pays dexfee in v1.  Bob puts a deposit.  To deter spammy traders.

Reading how you are trying to remove the Alice and bob -ness of a trade, and to remove the need for bob to have extra deposit.  Yes benefit of no fee to LP is there in v1 but requiring extra deposit exists.

Instead, bob puts order with dexfee paid.  When Alice comes to buy bobs order, Alice pays dexfee back to bob from Alice funds during trade.  Bob still has no fee trade, Alice still pays dexfee, bob doesn’t need deposit.

Bob 10xdexfee
Alice trade
Bob trade
Alice dexfee
Bob refund10xdexfee

OR
Bob dexfee
Bob trade
Alice trade+repaydexfee

Or some other combination where one party cannot inconvenience the other by canceling mid trade.

Maybe zeroconf deposits can be used by LP for dexfee in the protocol refactor?";"";"";
"457121878465708043";"artem.pikulin#0794";"17-Dec-18 04:44 AM";"@Mylo Hi, the main purpose of previous protocol was to allow the swap of coins that do not support CLTV opcode as there were just few of them at the moment of discussion. I might be wrong but there is `always` a way for one of the parties to not follow the protocol making other side loosing the fee (or there might be the case that fee is not collected), examples:
Bob 10xdexfee -> Alice trade -> Bob trade -> There is no incentive for Alice to send the dexfee as Bpayment is already done and she can spend it.
Bob dexfee -> Bob trade -> Alice trade + repaydexfee -> Bob doesn't spend the Alice payment, both sides refund the payments after locktime passes, but fee is lost.
`Maybe zeroconf deposits can be used by LP for dexfee in the protocol refactor?` - the goal of protocol refactor is to eliminate the requirement to have much more funds that is really required to trade (212% for bob). We should start to think very different about it, just imagine centralized exchange that forces you to make `2xdeposit` to trade, I guess nobody will use it. Or the exchange where you need run app in CLI-mode on dedicated server to be liquidity provider.
Any additional deposits will confuse the end users (remember that we present HyperDEX as ""grandma"" friendly). Users shouldn't have a questions like ""why do I need to put the additional deposit to start the trade?"", because it's irritating them. If we irritate the user there is more chance that he closes the app and never comes back making the DEX platform using the liquidity.";"";"";

1. Makes users life simpler - they don't need to understand why they need the 212% to trade.
2. Makes programmer life simpler - less steps are easier to code, the less code you have less errors you have in it.
Main motivation was to remove the 212% stuff. One of the MM2 essential goals is `UX similar to centralized exchange`. Did you see any CEX that requires you to deposit 212KMD to trade just 100?";"";"";

I could solve the error by doing this:

```sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libnanomsg-dev

$ whereis nanomsg
nanomsg: /usr/include/nanomsg

$ ls /usr/local/include/nanomsg
No such file or directory

$ sudo ln -s /usr/include/nanomsg /usr/local/include/
$ ls /usr/local/include/nanomsg
> Folder contents. Yay.

$ ./m_unix 
> Succesful update. Yay.```";"";"";
