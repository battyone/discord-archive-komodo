https://minethechains.com/ is looking for a logo and we need your help.
We are reaching out to the members of the Pirate and Komodo community to help us design the MTC logo. A bounty of 100 ARRR will be given to every suitable submission (you need to show some initiative and be within the guidelines). The winning logo, selected by myself, will be given a grand prize of 2500 ARRR and will be used as the minethechains.com logo, with due credit going to the designer. 
If you would like to try your hand, the guidelines are as follows. Please post your submission at the MineTheChains discord! https://discord.gg/syqQ5Yr 
The logo must:
-    be scalable
-    use at least 1 of the colours from the colour scheme below
-    be able to be put on the https://minethechains.com/ home page & used for marketing
-    be SFW
The logo should:
-    represent a multi-currency/chain mining pool
-    not be specific to any chain, or show images from chains
Colour scheme of the site. You can choose to use all of these, or not, up to you!
    colour1: #cdcbb4;
    colour2: #4a8ad0;
    colour3: #d1a446;
    colour4: #29407C;
    colour5: #2a344b;
    colour6: black;

The competition will be run until the end of March ‚Äô19. The winner will then be selected and posted in the MineTheChains/Pirate/KMD discord.
