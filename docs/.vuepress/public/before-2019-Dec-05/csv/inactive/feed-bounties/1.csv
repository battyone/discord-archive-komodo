Sytle and interpretation is open to individual artistic freedom, though I'll elaborate more about the background of the concept etc in the next few days so it's a bit less of a vague brief. The ""hidden dragon"" can be anything across the broad range of lore to the reptiles we all know and love.  Can be a shadow rising, or a trickster spirit on the shoulder whispering escape.
He's a river dog, when he escapes he heads into the bush along it and is a master at evading capture. Had 3 ranger units trying to corner him a couple weeks ago but he gave them the run around for a couple of hours unitl I showed up.  So could be him evading capture attempts.
 He might have a den on the foreshore, guarding a hoard of kmd?  Or maybe his dragon familiar flys up to scout his next destination as he breaks through all baricades to reach it. He's a good geocaching partner, and that kind of ties in with the tracker gps side of things, so it could be a cache he's searching for or protecting.";"";"";
