One layer of concrete is pretty easy to drill into and make a hole for a person to squeeze into.

dPoW adds 2 more concrete layers (KMD & BTC), and an important timing layer.

Try drilling into 3 layers of concrete, of different grades.  You need different drill bits to go through different harder concrete.

The KMD & BTC layers also have steel mesh to re-inforce and strengthen it.
Your drill needs to be good enough to drill through 3 layers of concrete, be wide enough for the  person to climb into.

The drill holes are filled by very quickly drying cement, almost as soon as someone tries drilling into it - because the cement auto-repairs as time moves forwards (blocks are made).";"";"üôè (2),‚ù§ (1)";

It started with 4 hospitals (not sure where it's at now) but they are using the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton to develop a solution. Seems they are using Ethereum but adding privacy features (I believe off-chain)
<https://gcn.com/articles/2018/06/22/fda-blockchain-ehr-sharing.aspx>

Here's Booz Allen Hamilton's white paper in regards to the chain.
<https://blockchainhealthcaretoday.com/index.php/journal/article/view/13/17>

TLDR: Building permissioned blockchain that provides 3 tiers of information access, a descriptor(public), summary (permissioned), and full access (permissioned). They said ""special purpose software designed to work along side the blockchain must be implemented to facilitate additional layers of encryption that enforce the privacy of content embedded within transaction data""
Also that ""the data owner may revoke access to a piece of shared data with a guarantee that even a receiver‚Äôs private key together with the raw blockchain transaction data would not be sufficient to obtain data access""

@Steve Lee and @Bitcoin Benny, thoughts on this for a business opportunity/use case for Komodo? Seems the privacy aspect could be something Komodo could do well.";"";"";

We should reach out to these people just to make a connection, talk with them about the types of things they see their clients needing from blockchain and what is missing from projects like Ethereum. What they have to do to get around the limitations they are seeing on chain, and we can attempt to develop solutions, or might even already have the solutions (zk-snarks for privacy, language agnostic for contracts, etc) in order to make Komodo a more attractive platform. And then we can be on their minds when they look to implement another Blockchain for their clients.";"";"";

Not as expensive either. Basically i‚Äôm focusing on people that need websites to showcase their portfolio, web galleries/blogs (starting up).

However, in my mind being backward compatible and knowing that my funds are safe in the ecosystem  for the years ahead are quite more important. There seems to be a tradeoff here. Isnt this a big decision to remove these addresses? Some people will lose their funds for sure. Or some people might think twice to leave their funds in KMD if they wont be able to check KMD news for a while. Was there any alternative solutions? What was their pro cons?";"";"";
