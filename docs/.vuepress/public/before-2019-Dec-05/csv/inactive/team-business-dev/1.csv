Consulting firms are where businesses turn to rent brain power. When they don‚Äôt know how to approach something, don‚Äôt know if there is a better way to do something, don‚Äôt know if they can truly implement something (like a blockchain) they turn to consultants. They don‚Äôt turn to blockchain companies to ask if it works, because that‚Äôs like asking a car salesman if you need a car. So getting in with some consulting firms would be crucial. 

Consulting firms are looking for cutting edge ways to bring value to their clients, a Komodo official partnership with them could give them the tools to recommend blockchain products to their clients, these firms aren‚Äôt going to recommend building on a platform they don‚Äôt know or trust, because they are in the business of being right, not throwing ideas at a wall. 

Here‚Äôs some blockchain focused contacts at the top consulting firms in the United States and World

^^^I think this guy might be the best bet to go to first. He's young and labels himself cryptocurrency lead at EY on his twitter, and cryptoasset leader on linkedin. This is a big step up for the other roles which are ""blockchain"" and try to avoid the crypto part. He may be more receptive to hearing us out, and he actually has experience with integrating blockchains into businesses.

Booz Allen Hamilton is very big in government contracts and consulting as 1/3rd of their entire work force are military veterans. One strong avenue of approach would be to try and target products to the GSA.

The GSA acts as the primary procurement and distribution branch for most government agencies for supplies. Including the military. It seems Booz Allen Hamilton is probably the go to consulting firm dealing with US gov. Anything with NSN can be procured through GSA, they are the big ones.
Which means they are big in the contracting business and the audit, tracking, and verification of contracts could easily be suited for blockchains. Problem is we'd be going against probably IBM. But that hasn't stopped Factom or other blockchain companies from securing DHS contracts and grants (though Factom has a foundation based in Texas which is similar to how I figured we‚Äôd structure the Komodo entity)

The design of the system enable's it to scale to infinity, as long as the Internet has enough bandwidth and computers to handle the transactions. I think James stated it as ""limited by the capacity of the entire internet"" 
You can make chain clusters, with MoMoM so that a bunch of chains act as one single giant chain, and you can send transactions from one chain to another.  But creating one giant cluster that has all transactions in the world on it, kind of defeats the purpose of designing a system like this.

To answer your question, clusters or even a big cluster allows for partitioning different segments of the network based off of function .   For example ,  with KBS  a cluster of 3 chains, one for debt recording , one for credit recording and one for vouchers.  The first an ac_private=1 chain , to keep private people's debt the 2nd an ac_public=1 chain,  to allow trading among network participants,  and the 3rd utilizing burn protocol with the 2nd so that consumers can participate without joining.

More smart I mean - currently ICOs are more or less "" give us all money right now, so we start the product production"". But another possibility like could be very interesting for investors: money locked in smart contract, and pay while most investors (or bigest holders - options) agree. If no agreement reached for some defined period -> money sent back to investors wallet (+possibility to define different address then incoming address). So that only the first ICO part would be paid to start the business, and investors could agree to pay the rest BTC while the first part is successfully delivered (which is confirmed by investors vote. This requires that New Token XXX and investors BTC are frozen, and only exchanged after voting/agreement using some kind of smart contract. sth like that if it make sense? I believe it requires very big trust to give all money right away. Investing using partial payments seems more reasonable. Ofcourse this could be done without smart contracts, but  ICO owners must have some warrant theere are some BTC waiting frozen and will be paid after doing the job.

I don't have a budget set yet, but I would like to develop to connections early.";"";"";
