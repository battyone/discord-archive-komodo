Purpose of STAKED is to give crypto condition contract devs a place to have their contracts tested. There is a problem in that a coin dev cannot just implement the first iteration of a new contract on a production coin as each bug could mean a hard fork.(think KMDICE the last couple weeks) What STAKED allows a dev to do is spin up a STAKED chain that is fungible with all other STAKED chains. They can have custom consensus rules or contracts. Testers can then be rewarded by finding bugs in these contracts. If there is a bug in the contract, they simply kill the chain, update the contract and start another chain.

STAKED will be the only asset chain with ""opt-in contracts"", meaning contracts are not compulsory consensus rules. In order to implement a contract on a typical assetchain, all nodes must update. On STAKED however, you simply add the contract to a new chain. If a user wants to use the contract, they sync the chain and transfer coins to it. If user isn't interested in the contract, they can simply ignore it.
