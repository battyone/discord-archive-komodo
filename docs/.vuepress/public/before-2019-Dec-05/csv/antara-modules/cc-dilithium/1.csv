Sorry to say that, but there seems to be the other problem now (probably even related to the first one)
After creating the raw transaction with the ""register"" method and broadcasting it with the ""sendrawtransaction"", nothing seems to happen
""handleinfo"" method returns the same response as it used to before and the handle is still available:
{
  ""result"": ""success"",
  ""handle"": ""yan"",
  ""status"": ""available""
}

The mining is on and I'm able to get the transaction mentioned above from the network by txid with the ""getrawtransaction"" method.
It's like cc lib doesn't recognize this transaction as a one of its own.
Mind sharing the details on the ""other thing to change"" as well? Perhaps that's what could help";"";"";

Yep, as I've mentioned above, I am (!) able to get the transaction with the ""getrawtransaction"" method using the txid I got from the ""sendrawtransaction"".
So it seems to be totally valid and broadcasted to all the nodes.

@jl777c 
Not sure how to check the mempool, honestly. Maybe, I'm missing some API?
Anyway, there were no problem with ""sendrawtransaction"", it returned the txid.
And there's a bunch of blocks mined after that.
So one would assume that the transaction have been successfully mined and broadcasted to the entire network.";"";"";

Well, that turned out as an odd behavior
""Rawconfirmations"" was saying 182
And the handleinfo was resulting in an ""available"" status right until I've restarted the node
After that it seems ok and the handleinfo returns an expected result
I might be wrong, but it's slightly different from what you'd expect according to tutorial steps
So you should probably look into it as well";"";"";
