Some notes about heiraddress:
My understanding is that for heir cc contract only following addresses are relevant:
HeirCCAddress        (string)        taking the contract's EVAL code as a modifier, this is the public address that corresponds to the heir contract's privkey. It is used internally for special marker storage
HeirCC1of2Address    (string)        address for storing funds in coins spendable by owner and heir (funds address)
HeirCC1of2TokensAddress    (string)    address for storing funds in tokens spendable by owner and heir (token funds address)
MyAddress                            user normal address to withdraw funds in coins from heir cc funds address    <--- this is for any user who wants to use heir cc (owner or heir) 
MyTokenAddress                        user address to withdraw funds in tokens from heir cc token funds address    <--- not present now, should be added

And I'm not sure if we need to output any balances here. Seems this heiraddress function purpose is to give some info about contracts addresses to use them in other rpc methods";"";"";

I was thinking this could be something Heir CC could do.

`Should the owner fail to interact with the 1of2 Antara address for a specified period of time (inactivitytime), the address automatically unlocks to the second key. This second key is owned by the heir. Once unlocked, both the creator and the heir may freely spend funds from the address.`

In this example the first key would be the person being tipped, and the second key would be the Tipbot itself. We set the date to 1 month (or w.e.) So a tip is made to someone and if they don't interact with the wallet or withdraw the funds, the second key unlocks `the heir` and they bring the tokens back to the tipper.";"";"";
