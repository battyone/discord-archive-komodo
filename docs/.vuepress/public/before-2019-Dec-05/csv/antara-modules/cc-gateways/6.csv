LABS is the coin of KMDLabs, LABS is notarized on KMD and other chains tested at the moment are also notarized. It is possible to ask (and maybe pay a little sth) to add a new coin during a testing period. KMDLabs is for testing, not for long term dpow: there is the official NN network for this";"";"";

Sorry for the slow reply.
Yes, I'm trying this out and have done some basic testing to learn how it works.
My interest in it is to gain knowledge to pass along to a project that has asked me about it.
I'm keen to test further.
Things are extremely busy here atm so I won't be able to get back to it until at least Friday (if I survive, haha)";"";"";

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, or built something cool for Gateways CC, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page. TUIs are good too!";"";"";
