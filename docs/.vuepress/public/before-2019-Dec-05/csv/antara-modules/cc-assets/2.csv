When you're available, I would appreciate your help creating documentation for CC Assets. 

If you're curious to know what CC documentation looks like when finished, so as to get idea of what we need for this module, take a look at any of the modules here:

as far as I observed, the cc related RPC have all args as strings
In the older (btc based  etc.,) ones args that are numbers don't need quotes
