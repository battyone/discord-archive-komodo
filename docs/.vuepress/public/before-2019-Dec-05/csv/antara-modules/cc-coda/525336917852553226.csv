Speaking technically @o1christine - our devs @Mihailo and @Champii have already successfully executed CODA<->KMD cross-chain operations!

Basically you could run Coda chain and a KMD Coda asset chain and move coins between them easily. I think the end result would be that you could use features from both worlds (Coda and KMD) and you can go to KMD Code chain and use any of the Antara modules (crypto conditions) and then go back to Coda and have a small print chain.

This is exactly the kind of thing that is being asked for and dreamed of by big business and so many projects. 

All the devs and fintech people I've been meeting are disappointed with ETH based products.

They all have high hopes for it because they think it is the cutting edge, and they want the dream of workable blockchain solutions.

It is frustrating to see the presentations on the state of their tech and know I got to test that in Labs a year ago.

2 of the presentations I saw last night were projects on their way back from Devcon in Osaka.  Their newest tech and roadmap have been done or possible to do on Komodo for years. 

There were some good questions and discussion about ETH 2.0.  The feeling from all sides was it will be anything from a giant mess to total chaos.";"";"";

Great possibilities using the dual-daemon approach.  Especially considering all the params the chain would have to choose from.
