I need to verify with someone that knows hwo it works that how I fixed it is safe... Had a long chat with libscott today about it and he seemsed to think my solution is fine.

Started the chain:

I think to catch this getwalletburnntransactions problem I'd need all rpc calls you did on this chain or simply your wallet (where those txns should be now).

I have tested crosschain migration on them with CFEKHOUND as source chain, so I have used all the rpc in https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/blob/gcharang/docs/basic-docs/komodo-api/crosschain.md except for `selfimport` in the CFEKHOUND chain

the rest of the rpc I have used are too many to remember as this node has been active a long time and is a Notary in the KMDLabs
