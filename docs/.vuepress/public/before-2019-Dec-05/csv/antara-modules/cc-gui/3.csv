for instance, dumpprivkey using RPC returns a string. 

WIth pter todd's python library, wants to return a bitcoin.base58.CBase58Data or something i don't even want to know is compatible with some library i don't really want to maintain as a dApp developer.  https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib/blob/master/bitcoin/wallet.py#L237
