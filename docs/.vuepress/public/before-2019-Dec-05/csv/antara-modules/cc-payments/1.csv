"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"21-Mar-19 05:27 PM";"just a heads up, after discussing a specific usecase today, I coded the Payments CC with methods: txidopret, create, list, info, fund, release
validation isnt done yet, but that shouldnt take long once the rpc calls are debugged. just a heads up so there are no complaints about being blind sided by a new CC.
payments CC allows to define a fixed allocation of incoming funds. the destination addresses can be however many normal scriptPubKeys and one that needs an opreturn. if more than one opreturn is needed, then a chain of payments CC creates can be created, one per opreturn.
The usecase this was for was a smartchain that wanted to fund X amount to founders reward and the rest to rewards CC. the rewards CC needs an opreturn, so things got a bit more complex than you would expect.
total time so far: 8 hours
all the rpc calls have been tested in the easy cases, all that is left is the validation and to make sure the non-zero param cases and opreturn in the paymentsrelease is working properly";"";"ðŸ”¥ (12)";

The idea is to use token balances to allocate a total amount. You can use getsnapshot code to get a complete list of balances in addresses, then for each one would need to do a CCtoken_balance to filter out the ones with non-zero tokenbalance. Summing all the satoshis for the token gets the denominator to use to allocate the funded amount. I dont think it should be a consensus involved rpc, just a way to issue a dividend of X amount of coins to the token holders. Having an exclude list of addresses would be a practical thing.";"";"";

another utility that would be handy would be to convert a getsnapshot output into a set of paymentstxidopret tx and a paymentscreate for each group of 255 (about the max that will fit). Then it would need to make a ""linked list"" of paymentcreates where the first one is to 255 address + createtxid for the second, the second would have the same with createtxid CC address for the third, etc. until it reaches the end.
```
This linked list to other CC addresses is useful too.
Eg Product -> Component -> SubComponent -> SubComponent^n";"";"";
