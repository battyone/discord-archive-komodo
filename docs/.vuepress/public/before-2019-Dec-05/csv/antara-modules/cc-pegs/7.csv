The purpose is to have one global txid for CCs which will have only one valid lets say create txid, like pegsCC or for sidechains importgatwaysCC, in order for people to trust it is the valid one. Usually CCs will check the earlytxid and if the txid doesn't match the one in earlytxid it will return an error.";"";"";

But you are right, as we intended that there will be only one pegstxid per chain it is useless to have that RPC. Maybe I can turn it into RPC that will return the pegstxid from earlytxid so you can immediately get the pegstxid without looking at earlytxid from command line.";"";"rum (1)";
