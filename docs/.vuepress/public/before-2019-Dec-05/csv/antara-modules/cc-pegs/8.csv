Maybe you can help me understand with this example. There are rumors Deutsche Bank may be insolvent.  I figure it might be a good idea to get the equivalent of one ounce of KGOLD on the Komodo platform. Gold is trading at $1500 USD/oz gold. KMD is trading at $1 USD/KMD. I have 3000 KMD so I convert it to 3000 KMDT. I then deposit that for 1 KGOLD.  I go to sleep, and when I wake up, the rumors about Deutche Bank are going wild.  Gold is up and trading at $2400 USD/oz. I decide these rumors are unfounded and liquidate the position.  I have a gain of $900 USD plus the original deposit of 3000 KMD still trading at $ 1USD, So I get back 3900 KMD.  As this position isn't hedged in the market and there is no counterparty to it, where is the 900 KMD coming from?";"";"";
