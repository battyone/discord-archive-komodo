Reproduced issue which @ronyi had.

Game not started with:
```setplayerdata
findbaton err.-1
invalid gametxid, or already started``` 

And then TUI think that game is finished and trying to do bailout process. (if make bailout - warrior will be instadead because no keystrokes were broadcasted)

I stopped TUI by CTRL+C - gameinfo was like game is not started yet

Manually started game - and it's worked fine. I wonder some re-attempt needed on this stage.
I'll calculate time before and after execution of rogue game - and if game took less than 1 second I'll try to start it again until success instead of bailout.";"";"awthanks (1)";

Hmm seems that keystrokes sending on each level added another headache - played 5 levels game, first and third keystroke failed with ""couldn't find batontxid"" - but it was detected only when game finished and even when rebroadcasted and waited few blocks extract returned error (so game progress/warrior lost).
So I have to monitor logs permanently - not only on game finish and rebroadcast each time I see error to hope that sequence remains the same.";"";"";

It don't have much sense to make bundles now with such problem because progress of many games will be lost.";"";"";

Windows one have two cases of extraction:
 1) It's just error and nothing is extracted at all
2) It's extracting state for `dl1` (but no errors in keystrokes.log for other levels). 
Extracted more that dl1 in 0 games from ~15

Trying to identify now if it's a FSM branch problem or Windows kit especially";"";"";

I will work on adding an automatic extract verification step to the keystrokes submitting, that is too complex for TUI";"";"";
