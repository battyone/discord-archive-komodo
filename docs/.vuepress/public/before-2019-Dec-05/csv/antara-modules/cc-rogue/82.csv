I gotta tie up some other work things today and will be back tomorrow! 
I have some questions in the meantime.

Tony - 1. A couple of news outlets pushed out BTCtalk ANN , so the original windows bundle link you posted is there (they copied/pasted) Can make that a still useful link somehow?  
2. Can you also leave me a list of things to test if need be for tue/wed?  Should I try to pull 1-2 more people in here? Seems we lost some people.

jl777 -1. What is an estimated time frame for when you think we will know if this is or is not a test chain ?  My assumption is that it isn't going to end up just a test chain, but we wont know til you feel it is complete.  I'm looking for some info to help complete the timeline i'm making. 
2.  How do we feel about taking Rogue out to a video game convention in mid-april?  Do think it is possible  to have a version  to run in a booth to demo at that point? There is the East Coast Game Con in NC at that time, not too far from me and sensibly priced booths.  If not there are many more later. 
3. Is there  any documentation on how RogueCC itself works I can take a look at? 

Thanks guys!";"";"";
