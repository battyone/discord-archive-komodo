 But here community opinion is important - it's just my personal one 😀";"";"👆 (1)";
"272003866906722306";"TonyL#3577";"07-Mar-19 11:44 PM";"Hmm idea is pretty straight forward:

1) Add game length param (in blocks amount) to multiplayer games creation 
2) After game_end_length height is reached dont accept more keystrokes from players
3)  After it on game_end_length height  decide winner  from players extracts based on most gold collected and send buyins to winner

It will allow to create blitz games, rapid games, long games and etc so player will be able to decide which game join/create depends of how much free time he have / in which mode he interested in + winner determination  and in-game goal is clear and understandable in such case and strategy when you not start game and waiting for everybody die will not work.

@jl777c How do you think is it worth to be implemented?";"";"";
