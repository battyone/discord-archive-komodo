There has been some debate on developing the game.  This is what I think.
You can add graphics to Rogue, a GUI interface, outside features and even maybe some new ones with some development as long as it  is based on the actual game code of Rogue. 
You cant just turn Rogue into Pixel Dungeon with out serious amounts of development work, it would be better to start with Pixel Dungeon and  make a new chain from there. 

Others think you can just turn Rogue into  a similar Roguelike";"";"";

Yep,  in those discussions i tried to explain that they're inspired in the right way but the game development needs to come from outside of KMD and not to have KMD devs working on games.  I want to make sure that is clear. 

I know the goal is to use this as a showpiece for others to want to use KMD for their games, that is why i'm looking for timelines on the dev tools.  If its unknown, its unknown, I can just leave it all stated as development in progress.  I would like to be able to fully promote the  idea and potential along side the game.";"";"";
