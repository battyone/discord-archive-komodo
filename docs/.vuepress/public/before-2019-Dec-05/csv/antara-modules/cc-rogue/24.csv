1. How can someone mine ROGUE, I only have 1 ROGUE for block reward, no other info. 

2. Does Komodo need to fully be synced before running Rogue to play? 

3. RogueCC is the smart contract that runs on the Rogue Chain, Rogue is the game. Is this all correct? 

4. I saw we will be having a Dev competition, can I have please have some more info @ca333 ? 

5. Can devs can make other versions of the game as long as it's fully based on Rogue (as the engine?)  

6. The in game gold is equal to 0.0001 ROGUE. Is this correct?

7. Is anyone opposed to the logo I made for Rogue Chain (for now) if so, may I please have some input?";"";"";
