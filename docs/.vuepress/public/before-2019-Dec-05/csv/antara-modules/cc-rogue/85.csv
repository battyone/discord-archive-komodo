- if it's > 1 I'm trying to do bailout, if bailout attempt returned error - trying to do highlander (maybe game state changed since gameinfo response let's say)
- if it's 1 - trying to do highlander. Only if room not full ```highlander_info[""error""] == 'numplayers != maxplayers'``` doing bailout instead";"";"";

And tbh current winner decision seems not interesting imo. Games might be super long - somebody can just die on lvl1 and not make bailout for hour";"";"";
