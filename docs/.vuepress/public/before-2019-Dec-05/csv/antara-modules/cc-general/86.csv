Let's say I made a payment CC for some goods delivery. Receiver locked a payment in CC which connected to oracle, and oracle connected to GPS tracker. Let's say it's just one of contract conditions but to simplify I'll think that's the only. GPS tracker sent data that truck is on place (in simplification it means that goods are in it and we have a good arbitrary system). So now payment CC should unlock payment of buyer to goods deliver.
Have I use this payment CC as a subscriber on oracle CC to get some kind of boolean if condition met (received or not)?
Maybe it's good idea to add some logic for conditions creating to oracle CC";"";"";
"272003866906722306";"TonyL#3577";"02-Sep-18 07:05 PM";"And maybe there should be some labels for data providers (e.g. names) and some data structures (like a data-sets). One data provider can provide different types of data, if there will be a data sets he'll not need to proof that he is trustable and that he is he each time when he want to provide different type of data (e.g. gps coordinates except of temperature).  Perhaps this will make the system easier to understand. Not sure about it, it's after midnight already and brains work not crystal.
But most interesting question for me is how to use data from oracle CC in other CCs for sure.";"";"";

 An oracles CC has the purpose of converting offchain data into onchain data
 simplest would just be to have a pubkey(s) that are trusted to provide such data, but this wont need to have a CC involved at all and can just be done by convention
 
 That begs the question, ""what would an oracles CC do?""
 A couple of things come to mind, ie. payments to oracles for future offchain data and maybe some sort of dispute/censoring ability
 
 first step is to define the data that the oracle is providing. A simple name:description tx can be created to define the name and description of the oracle data.
 linked to this txid would be two types of transactions:
    a) oracle providers
    b) oracle data users
 
 In order to be resistant to sybil attacks, the feedback mechanism needs to have a cost. combining with the idea of payments for data, the oracle providers will be ranked by actual payments made to each oracle for each data type.";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"03-Sep-18 02:23 PM";"Implementation notes:
  In order to maintain good performance even under heavy usage, special market utxo are used. Actually a pair of them. When a provider registers to be a data provider, a special unspendable normal output is created to allow for quick scanning. Since the marker is based on the oracletxid, it becomes a single address where all the providers can be found. 
 
  A convention is used so that the datafee can be changed by registering again. it is assumed that there wont be too many of these datafee changes. if more than one from the same provider happens in the same block, the lower price is used.
 
  The other efficiency issue is finding the most recent data point. We want to create a linked list of all data points, going back to the first one. In order to make this efficient, a special and unique per provider/oracletxid baton utxo is used. This should have exactly one utxo, so the search would be a direct lookup and it is passed on from one data point to the next. There is some small chance that the baton utxo is spent in a non-data transaction, so provision is made to allow for recreating a baton utxo in case it isnt found. The baton utxo is a convenience and doesnt affect validation
 
 Required transactions:
 0) create oracle description -> just needs to create txid for oracle data
 1) register as oracle data provider with price -> become a registered oracle data provider
 2) pay provider for N oracle data points -> lock funds for oracle provider
 3) publish oracle data point -> publish data and collect payment";"";"";
