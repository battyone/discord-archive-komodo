"371114647052615681";"Mylo#8306";"24-Jul-18 01:45 PM";"EVAL codes in eval.h are the CC contract types i believe.
""`rewards contract`"" ID is 0xe5, `faucet contract` is 0xe4.

The goal is to have building blocks of smart contracts.
It's important to ignore for 1 moment that assets/tokens exist and can be exchanged.  This is a huge smart contract.

Imagine faucet was the first contract made.
It includes `CCinclude.h` which has all the core komodo stuff (wallet, signing, etc.) and eval.h so that somewhere i can spit out the ID of the contract type it is.

The smart contract ""library"" or ""catalogue"" is available to all of komodo.  You pick what you need to use for your use of blockchain.

That's how i'm reading it.";"";"";

```
a) the specific chain parameters so I can connect to it
b) the EXACT rpc call and parameters you used
c) the most important! the raw tx generated
d) clear description of why you think it is a bug. for now you need to look at the raw tx details to make sure all vins are valid, signed and all vouts are sane.
e) do not post things like ""i tried X and it didnt work"" as that does not help at all at this stage. These are raw transaction level things and until everything works, things wont work at the higher level.
