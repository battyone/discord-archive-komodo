"424224648889106444";"Mihailo#5902";"04-Oct-18 01:03 PM";"I would describe the channel CC like this:
1) sender ""lock"" funds in the channel CC address that is spendable by sender or receiver ONLY!
2) then sender make payments to receiver in new transacitons, and in that payment tx also the secret for that amount is now known 
3) if receiver wants to make a payment (this will usually be done only when the payment from sender some how did not reach receiver - for example chain reorg) he must provide the secret. This implies that receiver was online and saw the tx with payment from sender and noted the secret for that payment
4) if sender wants to withdraw fund from channel (he do not want to have channel to receiver anymore), then he first must do a close tx which will just mark that channel will be closed and receiver can see that, and then after close tx is confirmed he can issue refund tx and take the funds.";"";"👍 (2)";
"424224648889106444";"Mihailo#5902";"04-Oct-18 01:10 PM";"As jl777c mentioned the biggest advantage of channel CC is that it has enabled to secure payments that are in mempool with dPoW. I first did not realised how, but with this explanation it gets a lot clearer:
- when the channel is opened and that open tx is notarised basically it means that the amount locked in channel address is known that it will definitively reach either receiver or back to sender. Now when payments are done, by the time they reach mempool, both sides can see them and the secret which is needed to spend them. So, it is not needed to wait the tx to end up in the chain or to be confirmed, because as soon the receiver has the secret for the payment he knows he will get those funds. In other words, you can say that when a payment is done it is immediately confirmed.";"";"";
"424224648889106444";"Mihailo#5902";"04-Oct-18 01:15 PM";"In the case that sender closes the channel, he still must wait for notarisation to happen before he can withdraw funds. So the receiver will see that channel will be closed and no more funds will get to him.";"";"";

Current version allowed to do all needed flow at least once (create token, create oracle, create UTXOs, convert token, bind gateway, make KMD deposit transaction, initiate gateways deposit, gateways claim, convert tokens, withdraw).
Only manual oraclefeed running and checking if desired height oraclised is needed (but it's possible to make more comfortable in future).
Step by step guide which can help a lot on this stage: http://pad.supernet.org/cc_gateways_guide not working now by some reason, but I hope it'll be resolved";"";"👌 (4)";
