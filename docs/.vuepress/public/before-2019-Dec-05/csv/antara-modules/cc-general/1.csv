So 1 colored coin, even if it is created using 1 sat of the parent chain, doesn't mean its value is 1 sat of the parent chain forever.  As there are other factors that influence its value come into play, it will be worth it to pay the txfee in terms of the parent chain to move even 1 colored coin. (All of the above is similar to using ETH to pay for transacting ERC20 s). A simpler example would be like bitcoins from the genesis block that were mined by satoshi himself. If they were to be sold, they would presumably go for a high premium. Also `untainted` bitcoins that were just mined can go for a premium over bitcoins that were involved with silkroad etc., so you can see a situation in which a colored coin on a ParentChain can have 1/10 th the value of the ParentChain coin if it the market forces decide it.

It is still very new and rough and not much tested, but I have created assets, made and cancelled bids, even filled a bid. To fill an order, requires to have the txid of the bid or ask, but once that works I plan to make a price based buy/sell.

issue tokenaddress to find your address where the tokens will end up. you need to run with -pubkey=02... set to a valid pubkey. using the addressindex functions you can find your asset transactions. anyway, i will be going offline for a bit if you want to connect to a test chain: ./komodod -ac_cc=1 -ac_name=ASSETS -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_supply=1000 -ac_reward=100000000 -pubkey=<put a pubkey to an address inyour wallet> -addnode=5.9.102.210
