"424224648889106444";"Mihailo#5902";"09-Nov-18 04:27 PM";"This is the regular flow of using channel:
```
Channel create: channelsopen destination_public_key number_of_payments payment_amount - this creates a channel between the one creating channel and the destination public key with number of payments defined of certain denomination.
Example: channesopen 025d2c1b95cd6e49ca2159ed58ef748a52c90efb2509d174c091328713388b6e3a 100 10000 - will create a channel with 100 payments of 10k satoshi - in total 0.01 coin.

Channel payment: channelspayment open_tx_id number_of_pyaments_released - this will send the specified amount to receiver
Example channelspayment 636318273631cb3d205bde25bcf0cf3137984e2b866c3aa879040f906fb47c3b 10 - will send 100k satoshi to receiver.

```
Channel close: channelsclose open_tx_id - it will close the channel
