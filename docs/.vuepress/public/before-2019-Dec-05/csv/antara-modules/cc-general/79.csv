Described some basic tested cases for Token CC in this list and reflected it's coverage in auto-tests
Tomorrow I'm going to fill the gaps in autotests and think on more exotic cases.

If anyone from community or team want to contribute - feel free to drop your test cases ideas in comments to doc, I'll check all of them and add to list the result.";"";"💯 (2),👍🏽 (1)";
