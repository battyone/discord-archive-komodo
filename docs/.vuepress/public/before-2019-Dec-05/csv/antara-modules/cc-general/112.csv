I'm misunderstanding something, or not communicating correctly.

I want to find out the address that received the tokens that I sent. 

The address above is the one that I sent the tokens from, not the one that I sent the tokens to.

Does that make sense?

And I think I found a good enough answer for half of the question. It seems that for the amount sent, we look at the `fee` property in the txid. It has something to do with the total number of tokens and the amount sent. That should be good enough for the amount of tokens sent.

Finding the address, however, is still confusing to me. I think what might be confusing is in this unexpected address that's showing up. I don't yet understand where it came from.

If I do a `tokenbalance` request (on the sending node), I get this result:

```
{
  ""result"": ""success"",
  ""CCaddress"": ""RDqhjUdWcqFLsqDxw748AdjvLz9f5MeUTn"",
  ""tokenid"": ""b0a7af14f373fd38d229538f7e1e41ded3baf33ac3194dc5c8a6028972649b08"",
  ""balance"": 10000000000
}
```

Now, that address `RDqhjUdWcqFLsqDxw748AdjvLz9f5MeUTn` is different from the one that I used for my pubkey. The address I used for my pubkey is:  `RSE9SUWrNPB72YDEArMk1XLxWbdaz71oyz`.

The `RDqhjUdWcqFLsqDxw748AdjvLz9f5MeUTn` shows up as one of the details in the `gettransaction` output for the relevant txid (which I can find via `getaddresstxids`, if I ever need to).

```

Question: I notice that on `rewardsunlock`, anyone is able to unlock anyone's funds.

Just out of curiosity, what was our logic for when/why it would be necessary or useful for someone to be able to unlock someone else's funds? For the developer or rewards offerer to end the program, for instance?";"";"";

```One twist that makes it a bit unexpected is that anybody should be able to unlock the funds that were locked, as long as it ends up in the locking address. The reason for this is that SPV servers want to be supported and while locking can be done via normal sendrawtransaction, it requires a native node to do the unlocking. By allowing anybody to be able to unlock, then there can be a special node that unlocks all locked funds when they are ready. This way, from the user's point of view, they lock the funds and after it is matured, it reappears in their wallet.```";"";"";
