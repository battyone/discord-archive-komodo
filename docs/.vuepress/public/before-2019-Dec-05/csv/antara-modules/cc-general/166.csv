But I don't see any problems, with some existing FSM implementations as a base, to develop a json structure for definition of state list, event list and transition map for fsmdefine.
What is more tricky thing is to design state actions and event conditions for flexible internal events, as this involves some kind of expressions on chain values (for example to check if some timeout passed or amount is reached). I think we could develop some simple expression language which is defined on blockchain artefacts, so we need to enumerate such artefacts and assign identifiers for them (like 'ht' as height, 't' as timeout etc). Such expressions might be associated with states and events.
---
Another question is do we really want external dapps for evaluation of FSMs? In this case FSMs are dependent on  that whether the dapp is running and correct. As we have all the states and events inside the chain, wouldn't it be more reliable and self-contained to have the blockchain code (executed by miners) to evaluate FSMs state transitions? (maybe dapps could evaluate some additional conditions on state transitions but this would mean the FSM is not completely defined in the chain)";"";"";

A question that might be to study yet: seems that as many users can deposit or withdraw funds concurrently this means that a new Cashier FSM instance should exist for each user. But if the task is to make FSM for actually a pooled account maybe we need it as an aggregated FSM for several depositing users. Such FSM should wait while all the participants have made deposits, then close accepting deposits and switch to a state of waiting for users cashout events).

It seems this could not implemented by events and states and it is more like fsm parameters. So it might be done with some fsm-instance rpc that allows to additionally change instance parameters after the initialization";"";"";

So if state is 'Deposit Done' it would mean that no more deposits are possible, and 'Cashout Allowed' state would mean that the user can now withdraw coins. 
But what the 'Idle' state would mean if query it? 
(Maybe we can just add such change-attestor event that would simply return back to the current state)";"";"";

"507209916449292303";"dimxy#2587";"31-Oct-19 03:54 PM";"I did not mean that a state is limited by only one event, it could be several different events that cause transition to this event or several events that move from this state to other states.
I just thought for each real-world state we would want its equivalent in a FSM.
For example, for the Cashier FSM how will we differ if a pubkey is allowed to withdraw coins if we do not have a corresponding state? If we have only 'idle' state we would need to analyze the preceding events (like if the 'attested balance' event already happened) but if so why to have states?
So the FSM processes events internally and moves from state to state accordingly. And there is code which queries the FSM state and does some actions based on this. For example, for Cashier there should be an rpc which withdraws coins from the TableAddress. This code would query the FSM state and if it is in the 'Cashout Allowed' state it withdraws coins (or not if state in another). If we do not have such 'Cashout Allowed' state and have 'Idle' state instead this rpc should check for 'attested-balance' event, but the first case seems for me more structured and dividing code responsibilities. 
(So we will need for each application case to draw its own state machine and events, but we could do it with no coding if we have a json config and sufficient set of functions on blockchain artefacts)";"";"";
