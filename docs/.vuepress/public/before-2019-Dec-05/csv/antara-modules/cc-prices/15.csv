So scheme is something like this: ""buffer"" wallet A accumulating fees, then each let's say 6 hours 20% of fees airdropping to holders of (not sure what exactly), another 80% sendning to pricesCC address which covers payouts for bets.

If setup `BET` <- `BETS0` 1:1 gateway I think that I have to set extra low mining rewards on `BETS0` and this chain should be notarised";"";"";
