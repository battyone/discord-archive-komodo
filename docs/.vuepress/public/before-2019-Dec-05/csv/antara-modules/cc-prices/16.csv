For KMD_BTC it's 0 by some reason and also looks like there is a problem in displaying:
```        ""expression"": ""KMD_BTC, 1"",
        ""costbasis"": 18998,
        ""leverage"": 3,
        ""equity"": 86937,
        ""isUpPosition"": 0```

if isUpPosition should display if it long or short - it should be 1 because it is long and for KMD_BTC, ! it should be 0 because it's KMD_BTC short (so vice versa to current displaying for this pair)";"";"";

 I'm a little bit (actually much) confused with current quest of chain creation with fees airdrop to holders. It looks like @blackjok3r implemented mechanism to airdrop some funds from pricesCC - but  I'm not sure if it fees or not, and wasn't able to test it yet because have no luck with new chain starting. We have to airdrop only fees but not rekt funds

Also could you please advice how / in which place of pricesCC code I can change delay in prices forming for testing purposes? (for these airdrops testing I want to make test chain on which second and third price will appear faster than in 24 hours)";"";"";
