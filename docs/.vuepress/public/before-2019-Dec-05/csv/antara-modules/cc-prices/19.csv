"507209916449292303";"dimxy#2587";"16-May-19 02:04 PM";"I have read some more about how betting works. Probably we may improve something in prices.
First, how to find opposite positions which cancel out each other. Now I use very simple algorithm just searching explicit opposites like BTC_USD vs BTC_USD,!
I understand real betting brokers calculate correlation between prices for some period which allows to compare different prices.
(BTW we earlier discussed that XYZ_BTC cancels out BTC_ABC but now I see we could take into account the correlation between those prices)
So we might calculate a correlation matrix between prices for some period and use to better define cancelling positions (like EUR_USD vs USD_GBP). 
I think this would even allow to oppose complex synthetics (what we now do not yet)
 
Second, about risk management. Seems betting companies have several strategies. For instance, there are two kinds of orderbooks, A and B. 
As I understood orders in B book are just opposite positions betting against each other, that involves now risk for the house.
But if there are many positions betting in the same direction the house can go on real markets with these funds taking off risks from itself (with A book orders).
Seems we cannot use such strategy in prices cc? That is all we can do is just stop accepting bets if risks of losses for the house are too high, as in this case the house actually bets against the bettors.";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"16-May-19 02:23 PM";"maybe there can be a special bet that allows anybody to fund the opposite positions";"";"";

Simpliest ""first circle of defense"" - less leverage on more volatile things
Second circle is to try balance things like BTC_USD USD_BTC (in long synthetics can balance most volatile components) - by dynamic maximal allowed leverage (similar to bookmakers float coefficients)
