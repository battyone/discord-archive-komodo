One exchange, a private, centralized company, has wallets disabled, but still allowing trades with the +10 million KMD on their exchange, and you say THAT is disrupting basic crypto functionality?
I forgot about section 13 in Satoshi's white paper: ""speculative trading on centralized services as a core functionality of decentralized, trustless, P2P network"". (re @EPIDEMIC_media: Some may argue that speculative trading from buying and selling on a free market is a major functionality of crypto. Especially at this present time. You guys are great but I really dont need Komodo to buy a giftcard.)";"";"";
