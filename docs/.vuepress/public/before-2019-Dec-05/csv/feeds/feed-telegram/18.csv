"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"18-Jun-18 10:54 AM";"[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo is not a company. It doesn't have revenues in that way. 1$ spent in marketing doesn't translate to 5$ increase in coin price. And the things Komodo does generate ""revenue"" in is for asset holders like REVS and JUMBLR, which are based on systems currently in Beta. So no marketing cost to sales ratios do not translate to crypto, especially non-company crypto.
However this doesn't mean other ratios do not work to track the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. I performed some community led marketing and what took me 15 minutes to do, generated almost 10K new, non Komodo community member impressions. I could say 1:667 is my ratio of minutes to Twitter impressions on my marketing campaign, but that doesn't necessarily translate to price increases or even new users. There is the difficulty and process of establishing a brand that sticks with people later on, even if they never bought a coin just yet, etc. It takes time and isn't easily captured by something like marketing dollars:revenues ratios, especially if we are looking for long term growth and not just a quick pump and dump (re @N21_0: Every $1 spent on marketing campaigns should yield approximately $5 in revenue. This will vary depending on the economics and COGS of your particular business.)";"";"";

We need to leverage our 80K followers on twitter more, and especially need to leverage the 8549 followers here in telegram. However, many people are of the mindset that they bought bags and all they have to do is wait for the moon, but the reality is we are all in this little rocket ship together and everyone needs to carry their weight.";"";"";

Every MLM or scam coin in the world can pay for banner ads, it's difficult to tell the true projects from these scams in a single page banner, which is why they have an insanely low click rate and are often not even worth the cost right now. Just ask Utrum how effective their banners were on websites, it may be easy to track, but they aren't effective marketing anymore. 
Komodo marketing team could release the most beautiful, brilliant, strategic initiative, a partnership with major business or industry, release some new process never done before, and it would mean absolutely nothing for marketing if our community refuses to step up to help spread it. And that is the intangible, incredible difficult thing to create and utilize, but is the quintessence of successful marketing. The community.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"18-Jun-18 11:22 AM";"[telegram] <Regnar> KMD started with a BTCD swap, an established coin with established price already that was swapped to KMD. the ICO only allocated 20% of the circulating supply, or 10% of the total supply to new BTC investors, 70% of circulating supply was allocated to BTCD holders who swapped their coins over to KMD. So comparing ICO prices isn't really the most accurate way to do this. also KMD has only been around since early 2017 officially (post Swap) while NEO (used to be Antshares) and according to their website was founded in 2014. So I'm not sure what you're getting at with comparing ICO price to ATHs of different ICO structures, different ICO dates, different age of project, different team structures, different communities, etc. I don't see this metric being an effective way to measure the success of either project or their marketing capabilities. (re @N21_0: in 2016 
$KMD ICO Price start with $0.38 with ATH of 15$ 
and $NEO start $0.04 with ATH of 168$
you can see the diffrence alone without any genius market analyst üòî)";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"18-Jun-18 11:28 AM";"[telegram] <Regnar> The reality is, our community absolutely needs to step up and help the marketing efforts. Even established businesses don't consider market dollars:sales ratios as effective of measuring their marketing efforts. While some businesses don't prioritize marketing at all and just allocate ""whatever's left"" in their budget to it, others focus heavily on it and attempt to measure these ratios, with varying degrees of success. for instance Apple could release a new product tomorrow, with ZERO marketing the product, and it would sell out so fast because people know the brand, and the community acts as brand ambassadors to spread awareness of the products and brand. The no marketing would work extremely well for some brands because of these ambassadors, but trying to do this same thing as another company without an established brand or ambassadors won't do anything.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"18-Jun-18 11:33 AM";"[telegram] <Regnar> We, as community members, must participate more actively in the marketing efforts put out by the team, and must do what we can to spread Komodo outside of our community and circles. 80K interactions per post means very little if those 80K interactions are already followers of KMD and hodlers, we need unique interactions and new eyes on the project to truly see what it's about. That takes things like retweeting, liking, sharing, and tagging your favorite crypto influencers on the posts. it also takes finding posts where Komodo fits the topic, inserting intelligent and targeted tweets on those posts, and having the community come in and like bomb the post so everyone around that post sees it, and the strong community. So if you see a post where Komodo fits, insert something intelligent (not spam) that shows how KMD can help (ie. a coin page says ""we in discussions on how to become more resilient to 51% attacks"" and you insert a link of Gamecredits using Komodo to do just that) tag Komodoplatform and then post it here and try to get the community to like and retweet your post. That's what I believe we need on the social media front. community involvement.";"";"";
