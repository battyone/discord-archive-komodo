Now they're pushing to 1m tx/s just to prove a point and showcase the partnership with Amazon. Spread the word, we need more organic marketing too (re @David: Do you mean that 90% of the 20k TPS would not be safe?
The idea of having the most powerful car on the market is what cryptoland needs. If you can then scale 1 million TPS, then it's better for everyone.
