That fact that anyone is even responded to or even answered should be enough, time is a commodity and it is precious.
Stop with the FUD. 
Privacy is a right and we are all invested in this project and it is far bigger then many comprehend. 
Obviously many do not nor cannot understand the value, yes value of KMD. Value is a multilayered word.
This is where due diligence of research and investigation of any project is paramount. 
When that happens these fearful questions are a moot point. 
The code speaks for itself, it is the founder and it is brilliant!
No more FUD just do it and stand with Komodo and share it with everyone you meet. Personal one on one communication is very effective and stating the obvious do your own research. 
This is a transcendent project that is manifest in the crypto-verse. 
A multi dimensional entity with the capacity to expand exponentially on the inner and outer. 
As KMD does and will, it will gain strength and speed beyond your wildest dreams. 
This is a transcendent project and it is called Komodo!";"";"";
