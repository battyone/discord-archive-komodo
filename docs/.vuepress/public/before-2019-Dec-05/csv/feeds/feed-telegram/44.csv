"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"08-Jul-18 07:56 PM";"[telegram] <Regnar> I think I need to try and make this clear, marketing can be a lot of different things. It can lead to more Komodo buyers/sellers if we focus on the traders, this can lead to higher coin prices and is generally what people think of when they say they want marketing.
However, the reality is Komodo is trying to create a platform, or building blocks for an ecosystem to exist. The KMD coin is to be used in that ecosystem from Jumblr, BarterDEX, zeroconf swaps, dPoW payments, and more. So any measure of success should be in the increase of projects and companies that build on Komodo. The greater the success there, the higher the KMD price will go.
The results as investors visually looks the same, Higher KMD prices. However, how we get there is dramatically different. One way offers higher prices based on only trading volume and ""new buyers"" which is the greater fool theory. The other is by actually building products, partnering with companies, bringing projects to launch their mainnet on Komodo etc. which will drive KMD price because of its usage in the ecosystem. This second way will last longer and actually grow beyond the ""new users"" who buy KMD on an exchange.
This isn't to say we can't push for both, but the priority of the marketing team I think would be to create content that can bring projects on board, partnerships, and build a Komodo Brand that means something to businesses and investors.";"";"";
