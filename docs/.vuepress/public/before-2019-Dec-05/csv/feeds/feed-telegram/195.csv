"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"13-Dec-18 11:18 AM";"[telegram] <Seko> That is the comment from JL777 himself:
‚Äûwe havent done ERC20 on lightning. years ago i did what I call subatomic swaps, which were incrementally transferring value 1/777th at a time. It was really no big deal, so I didnt make any press release out of it. I didnt like the performance aspect as it required 777*2 small offchain transactions to complete and anything goes wrong during the process and things are left in an inbetween state. with a normal atomic swap, it either happens or unwinds so that it is as if it didnt happen. so any claim of atomicity when using lightning would need to have caveats, like it isnt actually atomic if the channel fails, or is closed, etc.‚Äú";"";"";
