I think you are comparing aspects of the #2 coin against what is currently #50, of course the #2 coin will have some advantages, otherwise it wouldnt be #2. Anyway, the KMD/ETH price is more than doubled over the last year, so even relatively speaking pricewise, KMD is doing better. There is just a lot more upside to KMD than to ETH";"";"";

And many other). (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> PIRATE is the most private coin out there, VRSC is one of the most technically advanced.
