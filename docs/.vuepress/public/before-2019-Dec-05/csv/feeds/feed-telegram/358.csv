1 day left until the long awaited Binance pump.
The active member count is a lot higher than we expected. However, it is still a bit lower than the high times of BPS. With the current member count we can expect a great pump. Inviting more people will result in an even bigger pump. So, post about it on social media, forums etc.
Tomorrow we will explain our strategy.
