Community members are definitely encouraged to reach out to their favorite exchanges to see if they will list KMD or Komodo asset chains, but Komodo won't pay for listings and many exchanges charge fees. Though KMD and Komodo asset chains have a far lower risk profile for exchanges as the asset chains and KMD are dPoW protected, which protects exchanges from 51% attacks. Basically when deposits get 2 confirmations it means the transaction was notarized and can't be reversed.
