Most crypto sites aren't where adopters (not investors) go for information. Individual investors who buy coins on an exchange and hold, or invest in crypto don't appear to be the market. komodo is building tools for people to use to build things. CC creation to target different markets (CC development is skyrocketing) Games with NFTs and their own chains (just got a new Game team), new blockchain projects (new tools are being finished up, plus groups like Chainzilla, Chainmakers, Redfox all have clients for this too). (re @JohDio: That is not necessarily true because more investors and people involved in this business become aware of Komodo as a presence in ‚Äûon the yard‚Äú which brings more investments and adoption possibilities or partners)";"";"";
