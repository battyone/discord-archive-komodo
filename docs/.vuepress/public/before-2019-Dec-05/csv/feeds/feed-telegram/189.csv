Ultimately KMD's selling point is that it allows people & companies to create and develop their own blockchain solutions to fit their needs. People can create their own blockchains on the Komodo platform easily and with freedom, they are not limited by Komodos parent chain and can customise the features to their needs. KMD's platform also provides a secure and simple platform to develop off. 
I am Bullish on KMD because as blockchain continues to become more well known and more widely accepted, we will no doubt see a correlation with an increase of the price of KMD. Komodo is also continuously expanding its operations to support icos and more.
We can expect a steady increase of price in KMD as time continues.";"";"";
