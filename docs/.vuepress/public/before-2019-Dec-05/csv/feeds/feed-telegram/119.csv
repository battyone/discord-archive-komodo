Privatebet (BET komodo assetchain) is implementing a generic decentralized gaming platform and will be using CHIPS for the internal ledger of the in-game betting results. However, specific plans are subject to change until it is all finalized.
Since the casino games will have a relatively short lifetime, as long as the market price of CHIPS does not change very quickly, people can purchase CHIPS to use inside the games and them redeem them via barterDEX at close to the same price. Maybe even some time limited pricelocking can be implemented with CLTV.
This is really more of an internal component for the komodo ecosystem, but I announce in here so that it cannot be claimed that it was done in secret. Of course it is all in my github and fully public even during the development phase.
Oh, there wont be any ICO for CHIPS. Not looking for any funding, we have plenty of that. However, if you want to actively participate in the development or testing, then certainly we need as many people for that as possibl (re @Gudneh: I see)";"";"";

While in here we have a lot of marketing, wallet help, website questions, basic KMD questions, and talk about other KMD stuff, Discord has all our major channels that are dedicated to each function. We have a channel for cryptoconditions, scaling, wallet support, general support, marketing and even have a jl777 channel where you can ask tech/KMD questions directly to the lead dev. Here's the discord link for anyone else who's curious!
