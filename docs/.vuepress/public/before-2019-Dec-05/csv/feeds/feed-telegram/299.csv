here sorry for the long silence people. The last few weeks have been crazy. Really crazy. A lot of secrecy and a lot of work. Some things got behind but great things are coming. Why, what, how, where, who - well, I can't really tell a lot yet. Official press releases and so on. But Komodore64 just entered the rocket to the moon. We were doing already great, but we are going beyond the madness. So since a week we have been in deep negotiations, filed some crazy paperwork. The result is that we got some serious backing. And we are talking about 78M funding for this year. So if you got KMD, RFOX or K64, hodl hodl, because great things are coming. If you have followed our Twitter, you'd know that we had Ben Fairbank as our guest to discuss the future; and the future is here. Blockchain games will go beyond anything you'd ever imagined.";"";"";

Please note that the integration of the new coin requires a lot of efforts, resources and time. 
There are three main conditions that the token has to meet, for us to integrate it:
It should be listed on at least one of the largest exchanges;
Market cap has to be over 5 million USD;
The daily trading volume has to be over 100 000 USD.
Since KMD coin has its own blockchain, the integration would be far more complicated than a standard ERC20 integration to implement and maintain. Therefore, it would carry an integration fee in the range of ‚Ç¨50-100k. If you are open to discussing this, please let me know.

Since KMD coin has its own blockchain, the integration would be far more complicated than a standard ERC20 integration to implement and maintain. Therefore, it would carry an integration fee in the range of ‚Ç¨50-100k. If you are open to discussing this, please let me know.
Please note that the integration of the new coin requires a lot of efforts, resources and time, therefore, it would carry an integration fee. Let us know If you are open to discussing this.

Please note that the integration of the new coin requires a lot of efforts, resources and time. 
There are three main conditions that the token has to meet, for us to integrate it:
It should be listed on at least one of the largest exchanges;
Market cap has to be over 5 million USD;
The daily trading volume has to be over 100 000 USD.
