The idea of putting everything on one chain has a lot of flaws, for example even if a single chain can scale transactions it also suffers from a massively growing blockchain size and needs increasingly faster bandwidth for all full nodes to stay current. You eventually have nodes running TB sized chains with GB/s speeds just to stay updated. Which leads to node centralization and smaller projects having to essentially load EVERYTHING from every other project just to run a node for themselves, they could end up just relying on these central nodes for validation.

They act as one including being fungible (constant supply) but if i remember right, if you wanted you could run a node for a single chain which you use for the bulk of your transactions that could communicate with other chains easily. So you dont have to run a node validating every chain, just the one you operate on most often.

First of all, you're confusing value with PRICE, in a ceteris paribus economic model an increase in supply with constant demand would lower price, but markets price in expected growth of supply, which is WHY predictable inflation of a currency is important, even Bitcoin supply is inflating. 
Secondly, bring your statement which you say isn't hard to understand, to its logical conclusion. IF value increases when Supply goes down, then any coin would be most VALUABLE as supply approaches zero. But value isn't derived this way, because a currency is considered valuable because of other attributes (fungibility, divisibility, store of value, MoE, network effect etc) a single coin (or really small amount of coins) isnt good at pretty much any of this (unless it is hugely divisible, then you are just changing the scale of the supply anyway) (re @David: if the supp increases the value goes down, if the supp goes down the value goes up. How hard it is to understand?)";"";"";
