""getting notarized SPV security at API wallet speeds
basically the best of both worlds
both speed and security can be achieved. essentially nSPV node would be very very close security model as a full node would be""
""you tell me. it applies only to komodo based chains that are dPoW notarized
it wont work with non-dPoW chains""
""yes, 1000 chains wanting dPoW is not so crazy and if each buys 10k KMD so they cover annual notarization costs via the rewards...
it is a big if, but at least in the realm of possible, if we can get a lot of ecosystem projects"")";"";"";
