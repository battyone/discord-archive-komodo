If you look at your wallet and see that some are not set, you can use the claim button to send your whole balance to yourself, which will set the locktime for all the transactions and combine smaller UTXOs into bigger UTXOs so that they earn rewards.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Oct-18 06:36 PM";"[telegram] <Regnar> Technically the rewards aren't staking, as you dont need to keep your wallet open to earn them. They are based on network participation already. They accrue for 1 month, and stop accruing unless you claim them again by sending the balance to yourself (just clicking claim in Agama). I dont think they will increase as they are part of the growth rate of total coins, and will eventually stop in like 13 years roughly. (re @WithConFi: Do KMD plan on increasing their staking rewards? Maybe with some incentives in participating in the ecosystem or network?)";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Oct-18 06:43 PM";"[telegram] <Hermes08> Wallets with no lock time are typically wallets that don’t give you your private keys such as exchanges and some other third party wallets that haven’t done this update (re @Regnar: Yea this can happen if you sent funds to this wallet that were smaller than 10kmd (<10 kmd utxo do not gain rewards, even if the wallet balance is greater than 10) or if the wallet you sent from doesn't include a nlocktime (what is needed to generate rewards) on block explorers it will show a locktime if it's set.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Oct-18 06:44 PM";"[telegram] <Regnar> Sounds to me like you used a seed to access a wallet, then sent funds to that address, and then used the seed to open the wallet again but realized the 2nd time is showing a different wallet address. So there's a few possibilities here. 1. You used a seed to access your first wallet and either wrote it down wrong, or entered it wrong (like putting a space at the end, which happens by default if you copy and paste from a Word document or something), this means the second time when you logged it you didn't make this mistake and therefore shows a different wallet. Or 2. You made the wallet correctly the first time, and now you are entering a seed phrase with an error, like a space at the end, which generates a different wallet address from the ""correct seed"". 
I'd recommend you look closely at how you are inputting your seed. If you are copying from a word doc, use the arrow keys and shift to highlight your seed and make sure there are no spaces after the last letter. If that is generating your 2nd address (without funds) try doing the same but leaving the default space at the end when you highlight and see if that is the right wallet. (re @Youknowwhoz: I doubt that , it’s a huge error in your network , I can’t believe I was about to do some investments here)";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Oct-18 06:45 PM";"[telegram] <Regnar> Yup. Some exchanges like binance(iirc) set locktime, but some of the services like changelly or shapeshift may not. So it's best to check when you get the transaction in. Look on the chain to see if there is a locktime field set, or if its absent. Also can check in the wallet itself. (re @Hermes08: Wallets with no lock time are typically wallets that don’t give you your private keys such as exchanges and some other third party wallets that haven’t done this update)";"";"";
