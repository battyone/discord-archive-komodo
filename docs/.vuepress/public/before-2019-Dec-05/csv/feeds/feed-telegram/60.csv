In traditional cryptocurrencies a trusted third party such as an cryptocurrency exchange is necessary to perform a swap of cryptocurrencies in order to prevent one party from sending a currency without receiving a currency in return.
Atomic swap give the crypto community a safe way to trade across different blockchains.";"";"";

Hey all, make sure you go like and retweet to my responses. If a coin project like GameCredits or Kreds secured enough KMD now they would generate the necessary funds to pay for dPoW in the future, regardless of KMD price is which protects them from having to buy 300 KMD when KMD costs a lot more than it does now. It is NOT about a 6000K KMD investment to generate 5.1% returns as a form of ""investment"" it's about protecting a projects blockchain from 51% attacks which is one of the fastest ways to destroy the value of a project, and also protecting against the potential gains of KMD as the payment method.";"";"";

The stances so far are 1. an altcoin project buying 6K KMD to secure 5.1% gains in KMD which is enough to pay for future dPoW yearly cost is a bad investment because other coins can get higher returns on that $9K investment. 
and 2. (mine) that speculative investing is not something you should risk your project on, that the valuation increase and decrease in the 6K KMD doesn't matter because regardless of the price, 300 KMD is needed to pay for dPoW. So that could be $300 or $300,000. So the investment to secure that yearly 300 KMD regardless of price protects against 51% attacks, and also against the upside cost of buying KMD at market price in the future everytime you need to pay for dPoW.";"";"";
