"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"19-Aug-18 01:04 AM";"[telegram] <Regnar> This is exactly WHY you purchase privacy coins though... Because ALL other currencies leave trails. If they didn't leave trails they would be privacy coins ;) (re @Xap99: Why would I purchase a privacy coin, if I couldn't get to the point of purchase, without revealing who I was?)";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"19-Aug-18 01:06 AM";"[telegram] <Regnar> with a privacy coin you break those trails. If you are trying to go from a visible currency to a privacy currency, it only makes sense that the transactions with the visible currency have trails, up to the point of buying the privacy coin.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"19-Aug-18 01:26 AM";"[telegram] <Regnar> Use a new vpn or IP address you've never used before and create a new one time username to put out KMD buy orders on a Tor based forum in a city on the other side of the country. Buy (with cash) or steal a burner smart phone from a store without cameras. pay a homeless man (with alcohol) to preload (with cash) a debit card from a store, again without cameras. Download an app that can spoof your GPS location on your phone, spoof your location to the major city on the other side of the country (at the location of your meetup to buy KMD) Download an app like Favor, or Fivrr, and use the debit card to link to the app. Generate a new Z address wallet from your computer (running a different VPN/IP address). Log into the app (at spoofed location) and request that a runner meets with your contact, gives them X amount in cash if they send KMD to your Z address. The app will charge your anon debit card, give your contact cash, and you will get KMD via Z address.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"19-Aug-18 01:26 AM";"[telegram] <Regnar> That's a really round about way to do it.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"19-Aug-18 01:26 AM";"[telegram] <Regnar> But I think it proves a point at just how traceable non privacy currency is.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"19-Aug-18 01:29 AM";"[telegram] <Regnar> My point still stands though, if you can buy KMD with visible currencies, the most anyone will be able to get from that is you bought N amount of KMD. use a z transaction to break the link from that point. and you can trade using the DEX, earn more KMD etc and no one will be able to know you have More KMD that the amount you originally purchased.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"19-Aug-18 01:31 AM";"[telegram] <Regnar> So depending on your accepted tolerance of tracing a transaction, I think a reasonably private use of NON privacy currency to buy privacy currency is to pay cash via something like craigslist after making contact with a burner email.";"";"";

It's also difficult because the way digital fiat exists, it exists only if the sender and receiver both agree that it exists... Bank A and Bank B. so if you want to be Bank B, or a party that receives digital fiat, you need Bank A to agree that you can receive it, and then you need any other party you deal with to agree that transactions coming from you came from somewhere else and that you didn't just make it up... there's a lot of ""trust"" and ""control"" in that system (re @Kaichichow: I should start a komodo escrow :') prepaid debit cards for kmd üêß)";"";"";

So make a Z transaction to a Z address. then use that address to trade or do whatever you want, and then just never send back to the original address. So if you started with 100 KMD and now have 1000 KMD, don't send the 1000 KMD back to your original address because then yes, they could see that. just make a new T address and send there to cash out from, or just hodl until you get a KMD debit card and store your funds in a T address to gain rewards, and the ones you want to spend you send to a Z address, then Z to Z, and then to the T address linked to your debit card...

Crypto Zombie in my eyes would be pretty much optimal youtuber for this. Honest and objective enough and not just shilling without basic level tech understanding. Interview could be a real eye-opener for lot of people following his channel (and of course for him too!) (re @Regnar: EVERYONE! Thank you for keeping your ears to the ground and finding opportunities for Komodo to expand it's outreach!
@Keytothegate thanks for the link! you have been heard, jl777 is receptive to another text based interview on discord (interviewers themselves add voice/images for jl) Please like and retweet this tweet to make sure Cryptozombie and his fans see it. We will reach out in more official ways as well, but I always like pushing things on twitter too as it gets public eyes on it. :D
