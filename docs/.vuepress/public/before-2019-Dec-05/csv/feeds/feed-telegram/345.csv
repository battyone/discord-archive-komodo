You can do it on one computer
just create a new seed on Verus Agama: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029948-create-new-address-in-lite-mode-with-verus-agama
you will have wallet-name and pin as you like

then backup the seed and address, logout

üëá
everyone @Asher has just posted a new NON-MANDATORY release of the Verus Enhanced Agama wallet with native and SPV support for more coins, including Verus (of course), KMD, ARRR, a number of popular ERC20 tokens, K64, and ZEXO. We pushed hard to get out this release as a safe GUI alternative for many Komodo family coins.Most Komodo family coins are supported in both native and SPV modes. Please make sure if you're moving to Verus Enhanced Agama from the Komodo Agama wallet that you do not reuse your old keys, and instead create a new wallet with new keys.
This release adds a lot of new coins and although it prepares for PBaaS, does not include the PBaaS features that are running on testnet now. For testing, you should visit the #pbaas-development channel and start with the PBaaS Technology Preview.
Again, Verus Agama was never affected by the recent vulnerability in Komodo Agama, so although we are quite happy with this upgrade is it NOT MANDATORY.
Thanks to @michaeltoutjr and @Asher and everyone who helped for pushing to get this out quickly with more support for our friends across the Komodo ecosystem.

everyone @Asher has just posted a new NON-MANDATORY release of the Verus Enhanced Agama wallet with native and SPV support for more coins, including Verus (of course), KMD, ARRR, a number of popular ERC20 tokens, K64, and ZEXO. We pushed hard to get out this release as a safe GUI alternative for many Komodo family coins.Most Komodo family coins are supported in both native and SPV modes. Please make sure if you're moving to Verus Enhanced Agama from the Komodo Agama wallet that you do not reuse your old keys, and instead create a new wallet with new keys.
This release adds a lot of new coins and although it prepares for PBaaS, does not include the PBaaS features that are running on testnet now. For testing, you should visit the #pbaas-development channel and start with the PBaaS Technology Preview.
Again, Verus Agama was never affected by the recent vulnerability in Komodo Agama, so although we are quite happy with this upgrade is it NOT MANDATORY.
Thanks to @michaeltoutjr and @Asher and everyone who helped for pushing to get this out quickly with more support for our friends across the Komodo ecosystem.
