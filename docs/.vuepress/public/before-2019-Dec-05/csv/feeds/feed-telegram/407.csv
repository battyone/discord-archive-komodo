It may be free to use as an end user, like Hyperdex, Atomicdex, Utrum, Chameleon, Komodod, and countless other software in the Komodo community, but it isn't free to create.
Even volunteer developer time has costs TO THE DEVELOPER! That is time they don't get to spend with their families and friends, or working for pay. But are instead providing their skills and time to ensure people all over the world have access to top software and financial freedom.
With that said it should be understood that the basic model for open source software is that the core functionality is free to use, fork, alter etc. But there are premium versions that are SOLD. This is to help the ecosystem survive by ensuring that those devs and others get some compensation for their work, or at the VERY LEAST, cover the costs of infrastructure for the free software.
