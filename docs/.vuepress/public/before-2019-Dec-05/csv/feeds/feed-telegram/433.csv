If you give a bunch of people coins on an exchange, and they don't want to hold them, they will sell them. They took reward funds Binance was sitting on and gave it back to traders. Literally EVERYONE expected price to drop because of it. And now deposits and withdrawals are disabled in preparation of an update and price goes up, and you think something shady is happening? Both cases are simple supply and demand (re @EPIDEMIC_media: First Binance does a staking airdrop where the price tanks 50% and now the price is up nearly 40% on the week with deposits and withdrawls suspended. Definitely some shady shit. You can play it off as buyer interest all you want.)";"";"";
