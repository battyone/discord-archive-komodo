as long as you have the seed(24 words), you can't lose access even if you forgot pin or anything like that
where did you create the seed phrase if not in the Verus Agama wallet?";"";"";

you must move those funds from that seed to a new seed created using the Verus agama or else you might lose them

1) Download https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview 
2) First, create a new wallet (new seed)
3) Note down the address 
4) Logout then Login at least two times to verify that the seed is giving you the same address everytime
5) Then import the old seed (compromised), in the Verus Agama wallet and activate KMD lite mode. Then send all the funds to the new KMD address created previously
6) If you face ""electrum error"", ""connection error"" or ""get_balance error"", follow this guide: https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers/
7) Uninstall the old version of agama and don't run it again. But please keep a backup of your old(compromised) seed, wif, privkey or anyother way you used to Access your old wallet. See the following article to backup your old access method: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024424-how-to-secure-your-wallet-seed-private-keys-wallet-dat-file";"";"";
