This is important to us as it provides comfort to our users that a qualified attorney has reviewed each token that we offer and is in-line with our obligations under Liechtenstein law.
Until these opinions have been obtained, we cannot open a token market for trading, and it will show on our platform as offline.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"29-Oct-19 11:12 AM";"[telegram] <Acura360> It's not a bug - minimal swap amount is 0.00777 determined by protocol and the same for all coins. I'm agree that it's quite high amount in USD equialent. But from another side it's better to trade huge amounts of BTC because of tx fees. (re @Deadpool1001: Quick question.

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"29-Oct-19 11:15 AM";"so it is the better choice to require higher amount than let people be able to trade where the miner fee eats up most of the value. as it is, if BTC fees go crazy, i think it can easily reach 10%, which is on the very high side";"";"";
