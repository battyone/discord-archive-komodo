I spent much of my life without a mobile so it's not that hard. When I was young I had to knock on my friends and hope they were in.
I hate people getting hold of me.. Which is  why my phone is always on silent, I prefer to call people on my own terms.";"";"";

You go to see a friend you haven't seen for a while and if your both on Facebook lots you already know what eachother have to say.. I went on holiday last month..  yea I saw the pics..
I have no social media anymore, except twitter for crypto.
People are just trying to outdo eachother all the time and desperately hunting for likes to get their dopamine hit.";"";"";
