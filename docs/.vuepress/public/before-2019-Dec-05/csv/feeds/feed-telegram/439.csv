I mean if i loose my computer, will i be able to access my coins on magnum with my ledger and my password on another computer? (re @Regnar: If you can't or don't want to download anything you can use Magnum wallet. It is a 3rd party but they support KMD and rewards, they also have Ledger support and you can claim your rewards from ledger)";"";"";
