Lightning Network only handles 2% of transactions and ONLY Functions in a Non-Hostile Environment.  Also, Lightning relies on TRUSTED Master Nodes who act as a care taker of funds - legally - this would have to  be a trusted 3rd Party and do a KYC for each user.  In addition, Lightning Requires Sender / Receiver to always be online for transactions to go thru - this is very limiting.  Also, enough transactions have been lost in Lightning, to scare anyone who would ever wish to send a large Sum.  Also, Lightning's method of account is essentially a digital fractional reserve banking system . . . we already have fractional reserve banking - this is the main reason peeps went toward crypto)";"";"";
