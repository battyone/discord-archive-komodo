Thanks for your answers!
Next round ...
1) is it possible to convert an existing SPV wallet into native? Or somehow import that address into a native wallet?
2) Komodo derives from Zcash, right? Can I send transactions between Z addresses without passing through a R address? Can I send from Z to R and vice versa?
3) I'm playing around with the QT wallet. Why we don't have binaries for Linux and Mac? Only for Windows? Is it some kind of way to force users to Agama instead of QT?
