FA: KMD is doing very well due to the spotlight the project is in at the moment. Being in the final stage of a rebranding process and having multiple product releases like the Antara framework with their Smart Chains on the 15th of July, Komodo aims to be ready for adoption. Being the top performer of the last couple of days the interest is still rising.
TA: From the technical perspective we can see that KMD performed ahead of our indicators. Target 1 & 2 have been hit with the nail on the head and showed some anticipated resistance. You should have locked-in an average profit of over 20% so far. While writing this we can see Bitcoin is moving upwards which lets the price slip a little bit. However, being ahead of time, you can decide to split the last portion aiming for Target 3 and let the rest ride towards the due date (15/07/19).  Being a very irrational market we might go higher, but expect a bumpy road as we're already in the green.
