Once the initial pump is done (the buys of you guys) and outsiders see the coin going up, we will spread news via various news channels which make outsiders interested and slowly buy in on the coin.

The helpers got hundreds of DM's about if this is going to be a rank pump or not. Like we stated in the Discord. The rank system is close to being ready. This means, that this pump it will still be free-for-all. Like last time everyone will receive the coin signal at the same time!";"";"";

1. a special transaction will be send to your compromised address. it will be for a fraction of a KMD
2. you need to send 0.0001 (or more) from the compromised address to the destination address you specified
3. IF and only IF, your address has no disputes, or contradictory claim info, and the proper destination address receives the special payment, a refund tx will be made. PLEASE do not ask when these refund tx will be made, i am working as fast as i can, so it will happen when it happens.
what do you need to do?
if your claim amount matches the current batches size range check to see if you got the special transaction. Then make sure you only send it to the address you claimed. after that, just wait. i will announce status of each batch.
if you didnt get a special tx, that means your address is under dispute or you filed too many claims or it is the wrong size. PLEASE wait until we process all the problem free cases first. They will be done AFTER the easy cases are done. 
Please dont expect any refund payments until june 15, maybe i can get it done sooner, but step 3 is a LOT of custom code that cannot have any errors)";"";"";
