We will use a three-step process for processing claim:
1. A special transaction will be sent to your compromised address. It will be for a fraction of a KMD.
2. You need to send all the funds from the compromised address to the destination address you specified in the form.
3. IF and only IF, your address has no disputes, or contradictory claim info, and the proper destination address receives the special payment, a refund tx will be made to the destination address specified in the form. This does not happen automatically (we double-check every claim), so we kindly ask you to be patient. At this point, your claim is already under review and you will be refunded as soon as possible.";"";"";
