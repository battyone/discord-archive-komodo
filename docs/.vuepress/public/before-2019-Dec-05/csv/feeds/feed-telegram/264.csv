"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Mar-19 10:43 PM";"[telegram] <yorklab> Been away on a long business travel and now very sick, so I haven't been here much, but I wanted to reply to those who speak of price and marketing. I think some don't follow close enough to see what's about to transpire:
Listen to the interview with Ben very closely.

The new gaming team is moving lightening fast. I thought it may be a while before we here something from them, but I was wrong; we may hear something soon.
Crypto Union is gearing up to launch in West Africa to help small business grow
Ben has stated, and you can read, that parts of the Re-Brand are getting closer to completion.
All this stuff is out there if you go to the Komodoplatform website and Discord.
Now the really cool part is that none of this has actually launched yet, but some (if not all) are getting close.  Komodo has a marketing team and will do their thing when the time is right but as some have said they may not need to do much by then.
On top of all this there is ChainZilla which concentrates in the Latin American region (though they can help anybody launch a blockchain) and Chainmakers which helped to launch the Utrum project.
So while you give it some time and watch as things unfold, you can do some research and find out why many who came here to check things out end up staying while.";"";"";
