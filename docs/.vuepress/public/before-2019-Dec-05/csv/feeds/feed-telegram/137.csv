"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"21-Sep-18 12:02 PM";"[telegram] <Regnar> Agreed that the resulting frequency of claiming will likely be about the same (meaning optimal claim times) and the resulting difference probably won't be substantial to most of us (in single digit thousands or less) though it's a pretty big difference in time accruing rewards lost, between claiming daily and weekly. Daily is I think 0.0365 in fees, and 365 hours of time not gaining rewards, which amounts to about 15 days or 4% of the entire year. As compared to weekly which is 52 hours, or 2ish days, or 0.05% of the year. The fees are the more negligible side of this, the downtime I think will be a bigger effect. I'm not sure what you used to make that chart/formula but I'll see if I can throw something together too. Math :D (re @ca232: No, I just made a compound interest calculator that subtracted claim fees at each claim, and looked up the maximum claim efficiency for kmd held between 1-10000.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"21-Sep-18 01:10 PM";"[telegram] <Regnar> So I made a little worksheet running just basic FV and got it to match the atomic explorer calculator as a base.
So factoring in the down time (admittedly I cheated and built this in excel) instead of calculating for 1 year in the FV which is what atomicexplorer did, I divided yearly hours (after subtracting cooldown) by total hours in a year to get a <1 number for FV calculations. 
Subtracted fees for claims, and turns out of monthly, weekly, daily, claiming monthly is the best option. (re @ca232: Thanks. Tbh it was imprecise on my part not to factor this in.

Not to say dont claim daily, because you may have to if you make transactions or receive some, buy more etc and they aren't over 10kmd utxo or dont have nlocktime set then you should claim them to set the rewards etc. But yea looks like monthly is best, weekly is a close second, daily is lagging.";"";"";
