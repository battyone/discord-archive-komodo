All the exchanges are informed of hard updates to the chain weeks in advance to ensure they are all ready to update their wallets when it comes time. This isn't Komodo saying disable your wallets weeks in advance for ""reasons"" or anything, in fact some exchanges still have wallets open and will likely keep them open until a day or two prior. 
Exchanges manage their own risk in this way. Exchanges like Binance play it safe and will disable deposits and withdrawals likely so they can either prepare to update the tens of thousands of KMD wallets they have, or so they can consolidate funds in cold storage, update all their hot wallets, and so on.

Let me try to phrase a question that's important to me. 
Take IDEX.
You visit the website and there's a funny thing you need to do, ""unlocking your wallet"". A few other funny things later when you want to ""withdraw""
This throws off some people. But people know it's a DEX or something a little weird. So most people push on past the weirdness.
Honestly it's probably because IDEX has interesting coins that aren't listed anywhere else, not because the average user really cares about holding their keys.
 But no worries, they push on.
One big reason is they push on is because there's a list of like 100 tokens, visible on the front page, that gives their daily volume and % change in price. Also there are charts. Basically it looks like an underdesigned version of binance or another CEX.
The user then goes about his business trading with just a few quirks. Also things are slow, the website kinda lags, but it's ok because it's a DEX and a lot of coins are only possible to find there.
So the vision for atomicDEX, is it similar to that? Where a user will have to accept a few minor annoying tradeoffs in order to trade in a way roughly like a centralized exchange? 
Or is using atomicDEX going to be a radically different experience than a centralized exchange?
Another way to put it:
What tradeoffs will atomic dex accept, and what bonuses will it have besides less counterparty risk, no kycaml, your keys your coins?";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"21-Nov-19 03:54 AM";"[telegram] <Craig> Yeah I hate trading but for me it was a very easy call to sell above 1100 and buy back for 10 or 20% more KMD. I can see why that was frustrating if your coins weren't on binance. 
I don't know or care if there was manipulation. A lot of coins have pumped in 2018 or 2019 and only 3 or 4 didnt retrace at least 50% sooner or later. Even if your favorite coin partners with Google its smart to sell the news. And if there's no news in the first place, it's definitely time to sell. (re @EPIDEMIC_media: Lastly its kinda hard to sell when you can't make a deposit on your main go to exchange. So there goes your ASSumptions out the window. Im pissed off I couldnt sell at $1.05)";"";"";

Here i am saying I hate trading and then complaining there aren't enough features. 
It's just, there are other DEXs out there that have, or plan to have, a lot more that OTC style markets. Im not sure I ever expected leverage or derivatives and so on with atomicDEX.
