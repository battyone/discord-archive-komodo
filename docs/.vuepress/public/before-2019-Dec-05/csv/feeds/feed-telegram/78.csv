Do you think it's dPoW and its ability to secure scaling chains, 3rd party chains, KV databases against 51% attacks and secured to the Bitcoin blockchain? 
Is it atomic swap powered decentralized ICOs, Exchanges?
The MoMoM metachain scaling technology that has already handled 45K tx/s and is pushing 1M tx/s? 
or is it the privacy technology like zk-snarks and JUMBLR as well as the 5.1% rewards for hodling?
