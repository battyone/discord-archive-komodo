The main function miners provide are validation(Checking the transactions are valid and making blocks), security based on decentralization(i.e., if one miner is bad(submitting invalid blocks), the rest of the miners won't accept his blocks), redundancy: some miners go offline - others can continue mining making the system resilient and large hash power (to protect from 51% attacks). 51% attacks are mainly double spend attacks - can be ignored for dPOW if the last notarizid block is considered as valid. As resulted from the  above discussion, a miner with large hash power can only attack by censoring transactions. Can the other miners simply block and stop accepting his blocks? For other block-chains this won't be feasible because the large hash rate is required for protection, but with dPOW this is less of an issue? 

Another conclusion was that by splintering into a huge number of chains, we are breaking up POW and POS security both by breakung up hash power and stake/wealth , I don't know about POS, but can't all the asset chains be merge mined so that all of them get the combined hash power?";"";"";

I thought when you set up an assetchain, it is your chain, all mining operations you must provide, or create incentive for others to mine the chain. So in this way it's not sharding Komodo and its mining power, but is simply adding a new chain that notarizes its blocks to Komodo, and in this way isn't like an ERC20 token. The asset chain could have small hash power and susceptible to censorship but the dPoW mitigates this threat by requiring the censoring party to either time their 51% control with notary hashes, or maintain it indefinitely. I'm not too sure on how the inclusion of PoS hybrid to prevent this (though I assume it's to create more mining power to supplement few miners on the chain). but beyond that it's over my head";"";"";
