What are your reasons for believing we are so close? @Deleted User I feel like we should all choose to live forever just by looking at game theory. We are not sure what happens after death. We can somewhat guess that there will be eternal life due to technology tho. It seems more likely than an afterlife. My guess is this, we will live forever and be the masters of our own individual realities. We will then get ""bored"" of being god and having control so we ""die"" by giving up everything we had (infinite power) and going into a decentralized reality. One where there is a consensus on the rules and you don't have full control. Is it possible that we are part of a human/computer- conciousness blockchain of sorts?";"";"";

currently
```
[webpage]<------->[local OR remote proxy server]<------->[KMD RPC]
works
```
however
```
[local webpage]<------>[local KMD daemon] 
does not
```
and the reason is web browser has CORS error when talking to local daemon directly.

`geth` (ethereum client) has a command line argument --rpccorsdomain [1]

Would it be possible to add a similar setting in komodod.conf so  komodod will allow web browsers to connect to kmd rpc directly.

It's the CORS pre-flight check which needs support [2].  Browsers automatically send these HTTP OPTIONS requests, which rely on the server side to respond with the cross-origin ""access-control-allow-origin"" and ""access-control-allow-methods"" and ""access-control-max-age"".  Otherwise current dapp architecture i think would be limited to proxy-requests either by sending requests through to an intermediary on the same host as the daemon (could be same machine, but just adds the ""backend"" to connect to from a web application).

Lots of Info about CORS here [3] in case you're not familiar.

both are equivalent. But `./komodo-cli` is easier to use while a person is accessing the node through a terminal or using shell scripts.
The curl command can be used both locally or remotely(with the appropriate settings and permissions). The rpc interface is mainly for writing other programs(ex:wallets that need GUI) that access komodod";"";"";
