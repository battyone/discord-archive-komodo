As far as I'm aware it's based on the coinage of any UTXO over 10 KMD. The UTXO value is multiplied by coinage which is then mulitpleied by a specific number to result in the 5% apr.

I'm aware there was also a recent change that caps the interest amount once per month.

I'm assuming age is estimated approximately by number of blocks, so in pseudo code it would be something like:

```
const  interestPerBlock = <interest%earned every block>
let interestAmount = UTXOamount * coinage * interestPerBlock;
const interestAmount = Math.min(interestAmount, maxMonthlyInterest);
```

Is that more or less correct? I need to get this exactly correct to not violate network consensus rules. Feel free to point me to any docs if this is aleady documented in detail.

the rewards amount stops after one year

slightly confused by this.
So if I have a 10 KMD UTXO that's 1 year old I get 5% interest.
If I have a 10 KMD that's 2 years old, I still only get 5% interest beacuse it's capped

this logic incorrect.

Every assetchain in a project or every other 3rd party blockchain (hush, verushash, gamecredits, etc) don't need to participate in notary node elections.
But to pay for their assetchain notarisation. even a community member can donate for an yearly notarisation or a community fund can probably do that. aprox of 300 kmd per year I don't think is huge cost to save a blockchain worth multi thousand/million/billion against 51% attack.";"";"";

The problem with the KMD solution is that the FLO community cannot participate in running a notary node because:
1. Voting in a notary node happens once a year and only a few of them are re-elected
```
Yes they can participate.  Get voted in.  This is part of any voting process.
```
2. Voting in a notary node requires voting with KMD
```
Voting in the elections is one part of the KMD ecosystem.  If you want to vote, be a part of it by getting KMD around that time of year.  The Vote coin gets airdroped to holders of KMD.  It is a community process.  How else can a community process be voted on?
```
The FLO community should not be required to also buy and hold KMD to vote on a node to be able to have a small amount of control over the network.
