NN are like any other regular network nodes in any blockchain network.
They don't have the powers to easy mine a blockchain, except KMD.
They can not invalidate a block or reject a block since not being a miner.
Like any other regular network node, NN just accept or rejects the block based on verifying the validity of the block by checking it's local full blockchain data, against the data shared with the network peers.
NN has only 1 main power:
- Participate in Notarizing the block they get from network.
- Or don't participate.

So why not ask the community to pitch hardware through a network?

I've heard kmd can do wonders as long as they have the processing power to do so, and that this is what prevents you guys from showing off a little (like with the 1 million tx/s test). As a kmd hodler I was wonder if you could create a network that all of us can contribute cpu and let the chain(s) show off a little. Would do wonders to have people talking about how many tx/s you did with the help of the loyal community. Maybe I'm missing something, but no-ones talking about kmd speed (my friends don't even know anything about you).

Anyone wanna comment on this I saw on Reddit?
When NEO or other chains talk about scaling to *n* TPS, they mean *n* TPS being processed by that one decentralized chain.

Komodo has very little native scalability, it instead adds a lot of different chains together, with a shared state being created every few minutes. 

E.g, On their scaling presentation, they noted achieving 20k transactions per second with 1024 blockchains. That means each blockchain has a limit of a little under 20 transactions per second. *n* for Komodo is 20, it's just 20x*1024. 

Say NEO hits 100k TPS, then starts 1023 copies. That's 102,400,000 TPS. Apparently. Would those copies be adequately decentralized? Probably not. 

So, it's a neat way around the scalability problem and a good thought experiment, but Komodo's asset chains don't scale and lack of decentralization (and in my eyes, that means lacking any value because I can have a faster and less complicated private server using AWS).
