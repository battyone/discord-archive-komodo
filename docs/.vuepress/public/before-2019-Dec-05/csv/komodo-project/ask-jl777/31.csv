Re:  change consensus of your chain, yes - this is what crypto conditions allows a developer to do.   For instance, say you wanted to send all block rewards to a contract, then once per day you trigger a payout from that contract to “people that play your game in the last 24 hours” - then you need to make this player-data available to the blockchain - you can do this through an oracle and you make your “protocol”/data-structure of the different players from the day.
The daily payout from the smart contract can be triggered by some specific node(s) to enquiry to the oracle data, and pay out proportionately to your players.

That is a hypothetical scenario atm, but do-able as a change of payout method, using off-chain data.

The contracts are written on the blockchain using the programming language and as all nodes know the language, they will evaluate them.

In Komodo's architecture, there is no such thing as solidity. The code for the contracts is already in the daemon. The only data that gets written on the blockchain is a reference to the contract and any other inputs it requires. So theoretically, the code in the daemon can be written in any language. This also gives us the possibility for a modular architecture, where you specify the contracts you want to run on your blockchain when compiling your daemon and only those contracts are usable on the chain created using it. Currently all the contracts get added to the daemon by default when you use it for assetchains but this modular functionality is planned for the future when there are more contracts";"";"";
