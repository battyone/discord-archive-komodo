I might say that it is most useful for a technical guys using it as a hobby, 
other target audience would be companies that develop embedded software or some other linux derivatives. 


I've scattered around the examples you gave, and they were good sources! of komodo potential customers...
1. developers that don't have large dev teams and also wish to save a lot of time (miketout example)
2. developers that care about freedom and don't like to be taxed. (things you also mentioned)
3. ?

(mentioning developers twice might suggest that it is a primary a B2B infrastructure platform? meaning that the primary customers are businesses/developers?
and they will create B2C products?)


the reason that I mentioned the bitcoin generator, is that for some people, a zero cost blockchain generator 
(especially PoS chains. with PoW he still needs komodo's security) with very basic parameters, 
that would probably appear in the future for every major project, will make the cut for some people. 
this and a multi million mature ecosystem that he could take advantage of.

I understand that komodo is on a different level. 
I'm just trying to have a clear view of the trade-offs of someone standing at this critical decision point.
and I think that people here should also have a clear view of that, so they could address it in the best way possible.


Moreover, every project/company should first have their own understanding their own dna.

Based on your own story with Nxt which led to the creation of this project, I think that the branding should be based around the word 'freedom'
freedom to create, freedom to use, freedom from taxes etc...
first thing that has to come in mind when someone thinks about komodo is the word 'freedom'.";"";"";
"403206506171990047";"artik123#2884";"30-Apr-19 10:43 PM";"Secondly, I think that story telling is extremely important. 
people live and die on stories. many people still remember the story of microsoft, apple etc.
you could have a story of how we got here ( the lost of millions... and the breakout from Nxt it makes a good story... also help him to understand why he shouldn't use or be under the policies of others...) tailored by a branding story teller.
(let me give you some examples... the anonymous story of satoshi nakamoto 
(and the media attention it got based on his mysterious anonymity, for every project it worth its weight in gold..., 
silly wow story of dogecoin, silver vs gold story of litecoin etc... last 2 would be worthless without the story)";"";"";

AAA people, good education system and both political and economical inclusive institutions. open and merit based society.
if you have these properties, the chances of success are huge.
in komodo terms the first 2 would primary mean, I think, top developers and good tutorials of everything both for developers and users or even to have an academy.
all in one place. step by step. categorized with video walkthroughs starting from beginners all the way up to creating a new cc module.


But at the end, ~200 countries are like ~200 experiments of competing values...

Why shouldn't komodo have a constitution? 
to be written what komodo's most adhere to, stands for, and what komodo core values are? the things that it will or will never do.
the things that it could guarantee forever to any new blockchain on the platform.

Maybe this could be the analogy:

life - security
liberty - freedom to control his own destiny
property rights - his own native coin

All to make it a more an easy to understand, and more cohesive project.";"";"";

but since you are founder of this project, you have the overall responsibility, oversight and success of the project. even if you're a tech guy!
and thats why this project is biased towards the tech. (if you were a product guy it would be probably biased towards the product etc.). it's doesn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just the way it is. end result, for each type of founder, there would be a different resource allocations.


Regarding the two sides of the debate, I disagree. would someone be convinced/argue that this project is not about freedom?


I think that there is a misunderstanding here...  why do you think that I'm trying to underestimate the project?
I think it has a huge potential. otherwise I wouldn't be here in the first place...
I just think that at the moment it doesn't get its right place and recognition.
