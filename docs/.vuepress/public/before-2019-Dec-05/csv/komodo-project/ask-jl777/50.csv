Of course they did it again in 2015 and then to justify breaking one of the few running services, they used the fact that they posted the breaking changes in some obscure dev channel. And then used the fact that since they posted it someone might be using it so they couldnt change it as it would break backward compatibility!

So they prioritized some theoretical possibility of violating backward compatibility for some mythical project that couldnt have been completed yet (if it even existed) over the running MGW service.

clearly they were mocking me. I had 100% of my tech built on NXT and NXT was betraying me... I said that they needed to honor their commitment for backward compatibility or I would be forced to leave NXT.
