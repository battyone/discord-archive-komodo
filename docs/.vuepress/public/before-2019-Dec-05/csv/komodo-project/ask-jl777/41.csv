BEAM will support around 17 transactions per second. While this number is higher than Bitcoin and existing privacy coins, it is important to emphasize that it is not high enough to use BEAM as means of exchange. In the future, it will be possible to improve transaction throughput by using a second layer out-of-chain solution such as Lightning, Thunderella or similar. Then you should be able to pay for your lattes with BEAM. Until then, BEAM’s primary use case is store of value rather than day-to-day payments.

In BEAM, one block will be created approximately every minute. Each block will contain around 1000 transactions.

Instead of storing the full transaction history as in Bitcoin and other coins, a BEAM node only needs to store the current UTXO state, instead of entire transaction history. Validity of the history that brought us to this state can be confirmed by storing only the headers of the previous blocks which hold the proof of validity of previous states (using a structure called a Merkle tree) and Proof of Work that allows to reach consensus on which of the header chains should be considered the correct one in case of blockchain branching. This is achieved using cut-through, one of the core concepts in Mimblewimble.
We are still experimenting and evaluating, but it is a reasonable estimate that BEAM blockchain will be around 1/3 of Bitcoin’s blockchain or less (assuming the same amount of activity).";"";"";
