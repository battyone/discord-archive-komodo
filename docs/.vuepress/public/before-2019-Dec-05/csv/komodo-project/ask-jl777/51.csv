I think you still haven't completed your read on that article, it all covers these steps, you are asking...

>Oh, so KMD nodes, connects to Notary nodes for verification, then Notary nodes are running BTC nodes.

No. No `komodod` client node need to connect to the Notary Nodes. They only need to connect with the peers, like any other bitcoin based blockchain does.
Each node verifies the validity of the transaction in a satoshi consens way that it's not a double spend with the base Proof of Work or Proof of Stake or any Proof of X algo that blockchain is using.

There are 2 transactions which are related to 1 notarisation, in a quick short exaplantion:
1. The tx which holds the latest block hash of the blockchain. Example: KMD block hash, added to the OP RETURN data in the BTC transaction.
2. As soon as this BTC transaction is created and broadcasted, and iti's availble in the mempool, this BTC tx is taken and added to the OP_RETURN data of a KMD transaction.

Once this notarisation KMD tx is validated by the miners, it is ireversible by the dPoW consens rules coded in the KMD daemon.
All network client KMD nodes follows these rules.

Since this KMD Tx is mined and validated by all the client peers that it is not a double spent, it is valid.
And since this KMD tx holds the notarisation data in it's OP_RETURN, it is valid notarization tx.";"";"";
