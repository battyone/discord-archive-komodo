miketout Yesterday at 5:18 PM
at first, we will be able to support Verus as the reserve currency. Eventually, I want to see it go hierarchical in Verus (reserve currencies launching reserves in their ecosystem) and to support external blockchains as well, which would mean Komodo's would be first, since they are our extended ecosystem and closest daemon to us. It will require non-trivial work to be able to do the same for Komodo currencies, but I believe that is possible sooner than any other blockchain system besides Verus. Most of the core concepts are there and the reserve system uses enhaned CCs, which would need to be ported,. The other thing is that all the pieces kind of fit together, and make the whole better with each part. For example, 50% PoS stake and non-equihash proof of power fits right into the model with merge mining support and staking of currency reserves being used to automatically purchase currencies and replenish notarization rewards without external payment. The new merge mining support and PoS security will require either VerusHash 2.0 or similar, or a double-sized block header, since the equihash space is re-purposed. It would be easiest if Komodo also had support for VerusHash 2.0, VerusPoP, but another approach could be just porting the enhanced CCs, adding the consensus changes, then integrating the merkle mountain range to improve/simplify Komodo's notarization and leverage Komodo notarization to create a reserve connector. Basically, there would be a fair bit of work and some consensus rule changes, but it can be done.";"";"";

For my project i need a governance  platform.In order to govern members have to integrate their smart contract into the platform.The DAO will act in the physical world .The coin is the asset or represents a part of an asset in the physical world.Tangibles like land,water,food,rare earth minerals a.s.o.The smart contract should be the certificate of ownership the coin the representation of the asset.Through the platform the DAO members make proposals and vote on using the ownership mass to create wealth.Benefits from using the ownership mass in the physical world would be paid out 100% to the participants .The platform should include also a DEX where members can swap their benefits ,if they want to ,into other cryptocurrencies. The platform should also include the possibility of staking the coins at a yearly rate.Also it has to be able to offer lending at best rates for the members.To include some fun members should be able to play games.Komodo's documentation shows that all this can be done on a Komodo asset chain.We already have assets in place but in order to implement a first proposal we have to partially crowd fund.I would like to use the Komodo white label crowdfunding  dApp for this purpose.To be able to implement this we need the participation of dev's knowing their way around the Komodo Blockchain.For benefits of course.";"";"";
