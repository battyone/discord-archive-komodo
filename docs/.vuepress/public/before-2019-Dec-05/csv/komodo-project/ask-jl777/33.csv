These protocols have the property that, in order to compromise the final parameters, all of the participants would have to be compromised or dishonest.

To this date, Zcash has created two distinct sets of public parameters. The first ceremony happened in October 2016 just before the launch of Zcash Sprout. The second was generated in 2018 anticipating the Sapling network upgrade later that year.

In the Sprout MPC, all participants needed to commit to their share of the ‚Äútoxic waste‚Äù in advance in order to protect against adaptive attacks. This meant that all of the participants needed to be available for the entire duration of the protocol, and nobody could abort without causing the entire protocol to abort. Participants needed to maintain custody of their hardware throughout the process, so this meant the ceremony could not scale beyond a handful of people.

The Sapling MPC allows participants join to the protocol, do their part and leave immediately. This allows the ceremony to scale to a large number of participants and take place over a longer period of time. It also decreases the surface area of attack for participants and avoids the need for expensive synchronization.""";"";"";

So if you could control all the notaries and have them all submit the same invalid chain-states, would the validating nodes know the difference? Sounds like the validating nodes are just accepting some threshold number of replicated chain-states across the notaries.

""Validating nodes have their version of blockchain too. If one controls all notary nodes they can submit any chain state they wish, but it will only be accepted by the rest of the network if it follows the consensus rules. Once a chain state is submitted to the network, even notaries can't re-org it. So what ever chainstate is submitted, there will only be one valid chain ever. So double spending is not possible.""";"";"";
