 How he imagines the growth of KMD when it works completely independently.

 What advantage does it bring for KMD to create a sidechain for a project.  Do not understand the approach.

 Always thought that there are more sidechains in a project that has a positive effect on the main chain in volume and transactions.

The view that many projects are worth creating for the main chain I haven't heard yet but it makes sense somewhere. 

I can only hope that you the marketing really strongly boosts after the 15.07. 
People and big companies need to know how easy it is to create something on KMD. If big companies should be interested in it it will surely be good for KMD to be switched on.

1.  Build a superior platform
2. Make the cost really cheap to launch a project
3. Make the cost really cheap to use
4. Now you have a thousand companies that need dPOW. Someone earlier had already explained that  a thousand companies using just one aspect of Antara will need to buy well over 1,000,000 KMD.
5. The larger companies will need lots of chains which mean they will need more KMD than the  smaller ones. REDFOX LABS is building unicorn (Large)  companies using Komodo and all those companies will be using dPOW.
6. Many of these companies will incentivize Komodo/KMD in some way. For instance: REDFOX Labs is giving Komodo 10% of their profit for development. Zaddex exchange has KMD as one of the main base trading pairs.
7. All DEX fees will be used to buy KMD.
8. 10% discount when using KMD on AtomicDEX
9. Some of these projects may monotonize KMD; like using KMD to purchase things from a store.
