a)  is this testable in any branch?
b)  is the ""fee"" a set amount, or a ""%"" of the transaction.
c)  this ""fee"" - can it currently be a variable amount?  if not, do you see this as potentially do-able.

The use case is a franchise setup where the franchisor receives a ""fee"".  If the case for (c) can be implemented, the use case would be that the KMD value vs the BTC value vs the $ value  would be calculated by some data-feed (centralised or decentralised).

Failing that, would this be more useful for cryptoconditions looking forward?

"371114647052615681";"Mylo#8306";"10-Jul-18 10:12 AM";"@grewalsatinder from my limited understanding atm, ILP is streams of characters.  CC is defined in ASN.1 notation (similar to SNMP MIBS and HL7 medical devices protocols).

https://interledger.org/rfcs/0027-interledger-protocol-4/

So in that page, you'll see that `amount` and `expiresAt`  are ""fixed length fields"".  Each field has it's identifier and type.

As a telecommunications example, using my CSTA knowledge: in ASN.1
```
0x02 = Integer

Codes:
0x80=Device
0x30=Sequence
```
And the format of a CSTA protocol string is:  Integer + Sequence + Length + Device + Length + DeviceAsString + More protocol functions.

e.g.
```
0x02 0x30 0x0c 0x80 0x0a 0x30 0x34 0x36 0x38 0x34 0x38 0x35 0x33 0x38 0x35 .........
```
In this case the length `0x0b` of characters that follow.  0x80.....
`0x80` + length of 10 chars counted in base16, then my old mobile phone number (0468485385) in hex ascii codes.

So in this example CSTA protocol can be decoded by any language that reads those bytes like that.

I presume, similarly with SNMP and our KMD-CC ILP stuff.

Hope this makes sense, and if you can confirm @libscott @libscott";"";"";
