Running your own notaries as per #private-staked may be an option, it increases delay to btc level security if notarizing to kmd is a step involved as well (which I still recommend).  On one hand running your own notaries could be viewed as “centralized” without a similar voting process etc. but that would be something for FLO ecosystem to work out.  Each app could run some servers, as more apps use FLO, more nodes.  Keep in mind 64 nodes connecting to each other is 4k connections, more would be a new set of problems.

The dPoW has no interference w the apps reward systems on FLO.  If offering the users an opportunity to participate in security, what level of participation?  NNs mark checkpoints in a very expensive system.  FLO users would participate in the NN process, it would be completely insecure for your node to not be operated by a v.small team of trusted ppl.

Further, once engaged in the Komodo community, getting votes from creating ecosystem collaboration would be something the community looks for.  The notary voting is open to anyone, it is a friendly competitive and collaborative effort once elected, but certainly not something that can really be expected to be involved with, with no prior Komodo collaboration or input as there is no history that would appeal to community voters.

Either way, if you’ve got ideas with DEX and the rest of the tech, might see you around more in the future 👍";"";"👌 (2)";

More transactions on the network increase the value of the network -> increase in price and more z transactions increase the privacy.

But I do have a good foundation in computer networking & security--enough to pass a Cisco CCNA cert exam. And, at the moment, I'm spending most of my time in the Verus discord. However I do recognize most all of the Komodo dev team, from researching various cryptocurrencies--or probably just because you are one hell of a talented group of guys--and you tend to value privacy. I am different. I appreciate the developers.
So,  I want to get into programming and, for some odd reason, I want to work with crypto wallets--desktop & mobile. I really enjoy crypto & I was lucky to read the BTC white paper in '11 & I agree with the core argument of the right to individual privacy and the right for financial fair play, at any level. 
Like I mentioned, I'm very happy to be a part of the Verus community & to see what Mike Tout., and the Verus dev team has accomplished, so far. I'm sure that between Komodo and Verus-- you'll probably find the most talented group of developers, in all of cryptocurrency. So for me, to spend time in the Verus discord and Komodo discord, and to read some of the work you guys are doing in Pirate channel in the Komodo channel or Staked, I think it is lol--it made me think what a waste it would be to just not ask, for a piece of advice. Because I want to be involved in cryptocurrency, on the developing side. 

In as short or as long, as you want to answer--what do you think would be the best first step to take? I did jump right into networking & that worked out. But I also understand that a good first step into anything, is so beneficial. I understand that guys ask questions like this, all of the time, and they probably bullshit 99 percent of the time. If you don't have time to answer, it's not a big deal, I don't take it personal.

And you dont bother coding something that cant be tested, saving a lot of wasted time. so many devs have no clue about testing they release code that just cant be debugged";"";"";
