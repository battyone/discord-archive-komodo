Supernet has Agama wallet that covers 95% of all tokens but lacks liquidity. Heatwallet strives to also cover many of the current crypto tokens. Supernet is for anonymity and safety security. Heat is for speed and efficiency. Both are Decentralized exchanges with universal wallets to hold crypto assets. Both offer ICO plans for private use of their tech in private chains. Both Supernet Komodo and Heat Ledger are striving to take over the ICO industry from ETH. Supernet does Decentralized ICOs Dicos... and Heat for Legal security issuances, ICOs, IPOs... The alignment is close to exact in purpose, but in their differences.. Supernet Anonymous, Secure with Dpow, with slow atomic swaps from direct wallet to wallet.... Heat Fast and high speed trading with tokens.
All ICOs on SuperNET and on HeatWallet with their private chains can be exchanged in both heat and agama wallets. Adding liquidity to both platforms.
