```
non-fungible tokens are possible right now with the tokens contract.
We just need to use 1 satoshi of KMD(or whatever base coin) to create the tokens, 
then only one token with an id is created (so it has a unique token id). 
Later, whoever has the token can add op-return data to it.
GUI side can deal with the rules on how the OP-return data is interpreted

creating bundles of assets can be done with another CC that enforces such restrictions
