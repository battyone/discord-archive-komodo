And in case it is too much of work to do what those 3rd party libraries are providing, only the needed bits of those 3rd party libraries must be used with own source code for efficient code writing.
Please correct me on this understanding if it needs correction.

**What I want to ask is what happens if the 3rd party code we enherit has some bugs or vulnerabilities, how you choose the libraries for such situations?**

I observed you coding `iguana` and know from those days how many things you scrapped because those were not as efficient and bulky if just used 3rd party libraries. You had those 3rd party libraries kinda disassmbled and only used the bits which were useful to your code.";"";"";

That meant that the only algorithms you could rely upon having support for would be the least common denominator. Most likely, this would come down to simple SHA256 hash-locks. Less than 20% of the functionality could serve more than 80% of the use cases, and so the Interledger standard parted ways with Crypto Conditions.```";"";"";
