I agree on the point that dPoW is not perfect, but I absolutely disagree with you that any of the marketing that Komodo Platform Team has done is either false or misleading. 

I still encourage you to feel free to ask as many scenario you can make up.

If you could find any legitimate loophole in the dPoW you for sure be even rewarded for your findings.

we in the German Telegram Channel are a little annoyed about Dr. Julian Hosp. You know him? Co-founder Ten-X and THE face in Germany, when it comes to crypto.

We know that a few months ago he was informed about Atomic Swaps via Twitter. He was in direct contact with some developers of Komodo.

He now claims that the Comit network, in which TenX is involved, makes Comit the world elite in atomic swaps. In detail, he speaks of an ERC20 swap about Lightning. No one would have done that before and Comit would be the world's elite. 

Can you say anything about that? Has Komodo ever done ERC20 on Lightning?";"";"";

It was really no big deal, so I didnt make any press release out of it. I didnt like the performance aspect as it required 777*2 small offchain transactions to complete and anything goes wrong during the process and things are left in an inbetween state. with a normal atomic swap, it either happens or unwinds so that it is as if it didnt happen. so any claim of atomicity when using lightning would need to have caveats, like it isnt actually atomic if the channel fails, or is closed, etc.";"";"";
