I have a scenario I'd like some direction on plz:
1.  There are two addresses: Rxyz1 & Rxyz2
2.  The blockchain is currently at block 10,000
3.  I would like to create a rule where Rxyz1 can only send to Rxyz2 when the height is at 10,9XX.
4.  In fact I am happy for Rxyz1 to send to Rxyz2 anytime in the blockchain life it is 100 blocks before the next thousand.  e.g. 11,9XX, 12,9XX, ... ... 505,9XX 

What is the best way?

5.  Instead of 505,9XX can we use a method similar to ""time based sapling activation"" that says 100 blocks after 9am UTC the transaction will be valid.
6.  Can we make transactions valid between set hours, e.g. 9am-5pm
