I assume this is linked with the ac_cluster option, but how does the clustering really work, what is the mechanism that will makes it act like the XXXXX chains are not different than just only one ? 
How transacting from one chain to another is done, via atomic swap ? smart contracts ?

It's for educational purpose, and I have to explain this into an upcoming conference, the jumping from one chain to another is a big point I'm not understanding. I understand the clustering, but how, let's say someone from chain A can transact with someone with chain B without acting on the supply, and so, is the global supply linked to the cluster, or on each independent chain of this cluster ?";"";"";
