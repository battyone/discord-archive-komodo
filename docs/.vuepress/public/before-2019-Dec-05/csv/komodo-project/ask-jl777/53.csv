you may or may not like it, depending on how you like the level of programs you want to code.
explore what type of programs you want to code.
But learn C to make your programming fundamentals strong.
Then C++ if you want to extend to Object Oriented Programming
As you will learn C/C++ and practice it will make clear to you how they fit in the ecosystem of different levels for different purposes.
for web fundamentals HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript fundamentals.
When you understand these, you'll have clarity what kind of programming you want to do. Backend code or frontend Web.
Emphasis more on native code than web, because as the native programming languages now evolving, web is going to be more flexible to adopt the same native languages to web, examples like WebAssembly. Different frameworks will emerge in your fav native language to make web apps or native desktop/mobile apps to make them with ease so you don't have to learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript to much extend.";"";"";
