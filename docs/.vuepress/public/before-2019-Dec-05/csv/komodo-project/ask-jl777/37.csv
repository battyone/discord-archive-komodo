"354332171005329408";"sgp#7572";"08-Dec-18 08:00 PM";"it seems to me that it would depend on how the code was written. if it's written for a node to never reorg past the last notarized block it has in its cache, then it would have to be manual. but if it's written for a node to never reorg past the latest notarized block it can find, then it could be automatic as it finds the latest one on the other chain";"";"";
