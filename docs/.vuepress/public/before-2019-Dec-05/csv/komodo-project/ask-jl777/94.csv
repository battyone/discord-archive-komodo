The main hurdle of a BOINC crypto is the economic structure , Gridcoin and similar coins have gone the route of rewarding users with a coin,  the issue comes with a lack of utility of the coin.  Other than trading it for BTC / ETH there is nothing you can do with it.  The problem is made harder in that pretty much all BOINC projects are volunteer based .    A coin based on BOINC  needs to have a utility , some reason a person will keep on to and use the coin.  I have found a project out of the university of Brno in CZ that is a BOiNC based hashcat distribution ,  this could be an example of a public utility BOINC project.  People use the coin for work prioritization .  Other BOiNC projects can be rewarded as well but one has to be cognizant of the issues ( some people try and game the system to get more credits and in doing so sabotage the research being done )";"";"";
