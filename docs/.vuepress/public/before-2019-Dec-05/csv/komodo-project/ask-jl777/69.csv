And now - even taking for example TOR - they can‚Äôt overcome how they don‚Äôt try! After all, they have to hire specialists to confront from among all the same cryptopanks! supporters of decentralization and privacy among developers are much more than those developers in the service of the government! Yes - we will face difficulties - but they will ALWAYS be in the role of catch-up until they understand that it is necessary not to prohibit but to use technology! The world of cars of the future will not communicate in dollar transactions! Most people do not need cryptocurrency - they will have enough steblecoins - but robots and machines with AI - they only need butt for interaction and cryptocurrency and networks built on the principle of decentralization! Maybe not a blockchain but a DAG or something else not invented! And Bitcoin will be just a convenient means of saving value and not a fee for coffee!

And what is the main offshore of the future. - correctly - anonymous credit currencies! What is more anonymous - the more money will flow into it!

And countries such as Switzerland, Malta, Georgia, Belarus - an excellent example of how to legalize cryptocurrencies at the national government level in a short time - increase both the investment attractiveness of these countries and the efficiency of the blockchain in the current economic trend to become autonomous without the human factor from which millions of dollars are lost every year from the budget! Code is law! Here is the creed of the new digital age! the rest of the states conducting strict regulation will be noncompetitive in the new economy of the Internet of things of the artificial Internet and the blockchain! And no China and others will stop it! People soon realize the advantages of these technologies over the outdated Fintechs of the 20th century! And most of all, countries with cheap renewable energy will win! Iceland is a good example of the introduction of mining built on geothermal energy - and a positive shift is already visible! Central banks will not be needed! An artificial intelligence machine will not trust the intermediary represented by the bank to interact with another machine - this is not effective!
The only thing with which there will be some time to fight is anonymous cryptocurrency! But this will end when the millenial generation takes over the world!";"";"";
