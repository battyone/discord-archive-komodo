The idea would be to make modules of various difficulties such as graphic modules, scripting modules but also more advanced modules as an economic model for a game. I would really like to create a small mmorpg in 2d where the economy would be through mining that would bring money into the wallet of players. Assuming I do not want a maximum amount of tokens at the start. But rather an ecological cycle where each month we can mine up to a maximum amount of token.
