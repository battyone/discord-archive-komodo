I looked at many of the top coins and other lower ones that move up quick, and the common thread is they have partnerships/collaboration with the corporate world. 
Litecoin doesn’t have a big marketing team. Charlie spends his time finding a real use-case for his coin. He teams up with businesses that will use LTC.

When that happens with Komodo I think many of these marketing issues will seem trivial. In the meantime though it is good to keep tweaking the marketing efforts.";"";"";

Crypto twitter gobbles him up which is telling about their bias abilities. He knows it, he takes advantage of it. People blindly think these contests (which many many deluded companies do) are ok. People will never get paid for their time which could be have been used constructively instead. Mcafee gets marketing free or at very little cost.  ""There is no such thing as bad publicity"" is a trope though and untrue. No one can expect to be taken seriously by promoting themselves alongside the literal shitfest mcafee is. Aligning yourself and supporting negative things never turns out positive, at least I cannot think of any, can you?";"";"";
