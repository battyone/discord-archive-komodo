I was paying around 1 cent per view on my ad which was pretty broad, and got around 4000 affiliates who clicked, verified and used  some shitty exchange for $6000 or so.

"395274075985018880";"Regnar#6164";"18-Aug-18 01:52 PM";"I'm iffy on ads. I think we should (and we are currently doing this process) first establish what it is our goals and measure of successes are. This could be increase in price (not a great one imo) user adoption (as currency),  launch more dICOs, launch more ACs (businesses or projects), migrate tokens to KMD AC, etc. but find which segment we are best suited to cater to, is attractive for adoption and the ecosystem, and is an opportunity for growth in both users and developers. 

Only then should we re-position our branding, tech, and focus to cater to these solutions (not excluding the other segments) and then find out the best way to target advertisement and marketing towards actual segments. For example, ad space on an exchange landing page could help traders buy KMD and increase price, but if our target segment is say, AC migration, we would be much better off spending money sending reps to coin meetups where other dev teams will be there in person.";"";"";
"395274075985018880";"Regnar#6164";"18-Aug-18 01:59 PM";"Based on a focused plan and target segment we should be able to actually measure the cost of every increase in our metrics when measuring our success. For example, a $5000 ad on CMC may show us click through and we can try to associate it to a measurable increase in say ""user adoption"" or price, but that would be a reach of an argument. On the other hand $5000 for a table and airfare + hotel at a blockchain conference in which we get a commitment from an erc20 token to migrate to Komodo, or a business that wants to use an AC to build an audit/notary base. Would be measurable to split those costs.

It comes down to what we WANT to accomplish, as in the main goal we want to focus on or problem we are trying to solve, the segment that is having those problems, and how do we get in front of them to show our solutions. The measure of success isn't always shown in price either, but increased network effect and ecosystem breadth can lead to greater prices later.";"";"";
