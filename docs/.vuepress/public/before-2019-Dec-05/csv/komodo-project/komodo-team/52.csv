If he is not up-to-date on the subject that if anyone has solved it, his opinion on it doesn't mean that it's not solved.
I prefer to see the solution working in practice than just listening to his opinion.

He's a great speaker and influencer for Bitcoin community, and I respect his ways of dealing with cryptocurrency crowd.
But I don't like his way of discarding the fact without being assured if he's up to date on the subject and commenting it's not done/solved yet.";"";"";
