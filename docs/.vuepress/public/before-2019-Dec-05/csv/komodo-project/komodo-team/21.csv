> The problem with heavily marketing the swaps is that the pairs have no liquidity. We are going to need few fundamental things in place first.

> 1. Rewamp the UX/UI, which is basically being done now by the HyperDEX team. We will be doing co-marketing with the HyperDEX team once they officially launch. BarterDEX GUI is lacking a clear product brand to attract and maintain a userbase, and the UX/UI is not on the level it should be. As a result many people just try it our out of curiosity and never return.
> 2. We need to formulate a strategy on how we attract liquidity. My thinking is to focus on few pairs and guarantee their liquidity, and the not so liquid pairs are not listed on the dApp itself. Perhaps there should be a requirement to get listed on HyperDEX, e.g. ""if you want your coin on HyperDEX you must commit on running a marketmaker for your coin and to provide sufficient liquidity"".
> 3. We should also look for ways for a normal users to become a liquidity provider very easily. 
> 4. Some of the DEX branding and positioning is still on the drawing table as our marketing team is preparing for the Komodo rebrand together with 'Ideas By Nature'. Once that is clear we can do better marketing. For example, one thing we have been thinking is building a separate website for the DEX (backend) and highlighting the benefits, expalining that anyone can build a GUI, advertising how you can become liquidity provider, and then listing the existing GUI's like HyperDEX.";"";"";
