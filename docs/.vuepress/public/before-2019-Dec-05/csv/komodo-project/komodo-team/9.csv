Which is why I think a Premier Partnership would be a solid plan";"";"";
"395274075985018880";"Regnar#6164";"24-Jun-18 07:45 PM";"Here‚Äôs my thoughts:

We approach either the head of ministry of finance directly (I provided Steve his contact information already) we will either get him or one of the gatekeepers to him (intern, secretary, etc) in order to try and get a meeting with him to present the Komodo capabilities and our proposal of how we can help build their coin.

some of the key points we should touch on:
Being a nation of islands, roughly 400,000 people. With 255,000 living in Nassau and 50,000 living in Freeport, while the rest are spread out farther, they could start with a pilot program as their own independent chain (built on Komodo) and utilizing dPoW (to give it Bitcoin level security) so they don‚Äôt have the restrictions of Ethereum transaction costs and congestions. They can set their own transaction fees (which can be thought of as sales tax or something) in which a small percent of transaction fee transfers to the governments wallet (I believe this is called Override Commission.) They currently have a 7.5% sales tax but they could offer discounts if people use the coin. This will encourage people to use crypto there (as its cheaper than paying the higher tax, assuming they are honest merchants and report). This lower tax if using crypto will actually help their program be more successful (looks good politically) and allows them to account for tax collections much more efficiently (override commission).";"";"";
"395274075985018880";"Regnar#6164";"24-Jun-18 07:45 PM";"The government could simply do the accounting for all the wallet transaction fees and use those funds to sell on the open market and pay for other things if they choose, or they can pay for redistribute it back to the wallet address via airdrop for whatever reason they deem necessary.
And if they are ready to scale, hopefully our scaling solutions will be ready, and show the burn protocol to combat inflation when people move island to island. There also exists the ability for them to provide a measure of QE if they deem its needed in the future (not a huge fan of it, but the option exists).

They could even offer a period of greater tax benefits or discounts to tourists who use the currency.";"";"";
