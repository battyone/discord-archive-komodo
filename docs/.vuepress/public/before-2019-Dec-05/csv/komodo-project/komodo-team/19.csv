KMD offers an DIY-blockchain-ecosystem a la chain(zilla,makers) - where every blockchain is a fork of komodo (same tech)  and inherits all of it.  in the past, komodo has blazed a trail / pioneered the tech (atomic swap DEX, dICO crowdfunding, and now crypto-conditions implementation) and made it work.  all of these tools are available to anyone to build on and create value, to themselves and to the komodo ecosystem.
stuff like notarizations to btc for security, zero-confirmation atomic swaps, jumblr for privacy, scalability - all require KMD to ""make faster or make better or make more secure"".  KMD enhances the tech because it's been engineered for usage - that's how i read it.

It gets really interesting when dApps are built on KMD with these strengths, and the dApps offer interoperability with other ecosystems via crypto-conditions and atomic swaps.  So hopefully that stuff can be prototyped soon.";"";"";

I'm thinking that if you were to open HyperDEX to make a trade and see little volume you might just leave. Trades can happen any time but only when someone is on and leaves the DEX is open. So a chat box might give people a reason to stay on and chat, find traders, or do something while they wait for confirmations. 

Obviously this could be done in here or telegram or something (BlackJoker mentioned Matrix servers for chat which would be really cool, I'm still reading up on how they work exactly) but to be able to access it from the DEX would be cool. A chat might be a way for people to set up direct trades also, just come for ""the hanging out"" and end up finding someone wanting to trade or someone telling you about a coin you didn't know of.

I think for true DEXs, liquidity will always be a problem. CEX can only have a small sample size of the population worth in volume, amounting to no more than the total people on their exchange and coins in their wallets, but CEX are very active because the people there, are there to trade. 

Because a DEX can trade from the same wallets we safely store coins in, we can have true population sized volume (every coin in every wallet), but only if people are on at the right times to find each other (makes it tougher on other sides of the globe) and actively trading. so it would only make sense to give them more reason to be active on the DEX than simply to trade and close the DEX (takes their potential volume with them)";"";"";
