So sort of a planned mass awareness program, cause if your regular joe sees the name ""Komodo"" a few times, I'm sure they'll take notice.
Maybe similar to chainzilla where we do a smaallll bounty for commenting something useful on it, so we can have a couple comments/likes and bring the articles up to the top. Our reddit presence is pretty small and generally gets shut down pretty quickly or removed LOL. 
Would be good to see a few articles flooding reddit and blockfolio news";"";"";

There is much more to it, specifically the level of expertise and intimate knowledge of that code, how to fix issues, what every line means, etc. We all know how Google and Amazon works, we have their full blueprints, business model, structure, everything. Yet it's nearly impossible to replicate. It isn't about just having the bricks and blueprints to build something, it's about knowing how to do it and understanding how to adapt to variables in design, how to modify as it needs, and how to constantly improve. Anyone can copy an open source project and think it's just as good, or change small things like coin supply, block size, add a privacy feature, launch a blockchain from their desktop, but if you have something, anything on the line with the success of that project. It's best to work with those who know what they are doing.";"";"";
