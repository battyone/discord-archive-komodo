I'll setup the ikomodo site on it's own dedicated VPS in the next cpl weeks.  It is a wordpress site for it's simplicity to publish.  Currently need to organise a bunch of kmd work relating to what the team is working on across  dev/marketing/qa-support.

There is a podcast coming out soon where team member Alright and I discuss assetchains, and if you haven't listened to the BBC radio podcast where KMD's siu talks about the potential in Puerto Rico for a brief section - there's that to keep you occupied and excited with what is happening.

You may want to explain this to the author. First is the question about Token Creation, KMD allows to create independent blockchains that can do atomic swaps with each other and they work as the equivalent of colored coins/tokens on other platforms. So answering the question depends if he means specifically colored coins from the technical point of view, then it's a work in progress, or if he means the purpose of token creation, then KMD assetchains can fit both the token and sidechain categories. Then there's a question about transaction costs: the assetchains  are independent and can decide their own tx costs and pay them in their own coins,  they don't pay kmd tx fees";"";"";
