Because it's the end result, it's expected to be longer away in the future, with a lot of time in between of uncertainty and guesses/rumors. Milestones will at least give investors a way to track progress and know things are being done.

The new logo is done. New typeface, new colors, new logo, new everything. IBN was working on the wallet and well into the design process. We've actually paused that temporarily because there may be a change of plans. We might shift to the blockchain generator instead, which would mean IBN would design that for us rather than a new wallet. There are already several good wallets in the ecosystem so we're trying to work out if it makes sense to continue progress with the wallet or shift gears. The blockchain generator would ideally (not a guarantee and I cannot offer timelines) be hosted on AWS, which would allow self-service model for people to launch a customized blockchain with just a few clicks. None of this is certain yet.

We're also working on new messaging (which has been a work in progress for months now, with everything from the 4 pillars of blockchain tech to the new architecture narrative we created). We're working on the wireframes and copy for the new website, which will incorporate all of the new messaging and visual identity.

We're  hoping to launch all of this at the end of Feb or early March. These dates are subject to change.";"";"";

What is the overall goal of this rebrand? Obviously to increase KMD value, but what is the established method of doing that? Wallets cater mostly to crypto users, which could drive value. While blockchain generation can drive value by creating more users (variety of users too) as well as dPoW, MM fees, etc. bring in more devs to create better wallets, exchange UI, etc. 
If we think like a business, we build products like wallets, if we think like a platform, we build a platform that lets others build products. I'm a fan of the latter.
What does Komodo see as the best method of creating value for KMD and the ecosystem, and will this rebrand position us to actual do that?";"";"";
