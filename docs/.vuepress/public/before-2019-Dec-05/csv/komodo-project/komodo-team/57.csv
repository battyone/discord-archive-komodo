Our vision is to build an ecosystem.

To do that we need to empower developers and start-ups to build products using our technology. Thus we must understand what they need and then have all the solutions ready for them.

Here‚Äôs a list of what a developer or start-up might be looking for:

- get a high-level overview of what Komodo is about
- understand what he can build with the technology
- browse actual projects which use our technology
- access Komodo‚Äôs developer documentation & code examples
- learn more about blockchain & coding in general (courses)
- participate in networking opportunities: a forum to talk with other developers
- get capital for development
- have a platform to let the community know about the project he started
- provide updates about his progress
- share his experiences & frustrations through a blog & articles

Question  1: What is a developer or project looking for? What do they need?
Question 2: How do we build a scalable platform (not in a technical sense) that empowers the developer?";"";"";

Komodo is so diverse and goes through so many changes that creating a single GUI  for the entire exco system  will take some time. I think @grewalsatinder  library and education approach to attract new devs is a great idea, but that also will take time. In the meantime perhaps the team can come up with something that is very narrow in scope; start off with something basic. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as it's a GUI that performs a task that the rest of the crypto world says ""Well, the best way to do that is with Komodo's (whatever the app is).  For instance: in parallel with the MM 2.O development someone also develop's a very basic BarterDEX GUI that can only trade BTC-KMD and KMD-BTC and nothing more to start with. If it's really easy to use it could create a lot of demand and of course more attention to Komodo. After writing this I realize this may not answer your specific questions, but it's something I've been thinking about.....A simple GUI that performs a simple task that people will use.";"";"üíØ (6)";

<https://clovyr.io/>
Which I imagine would have simple things like uploading an image, choose a name, and sliding bar for parameters of coin amount and premine. buttons to choose distribution method (dICO, ICO, AirDrop, mining) if you want mining halvings, and how long you want the chain to grow for (say 20 years, and it will auto calculate the block size needed). Tx fees, if you want a founders fee on transactions, privacy functions (zk snarks, starks, ring CT), choose mining algorithm (equihash, verushash, Proof of stake, others, or hybrid with a percent slider. A single click for dPoW protection, auto push updates (KMD updates are auto pushed to your chain), and selecting where you want to start your nodes/mining (have click options for various servers like AWS, other 3rd parties, or local machine), if you want Agama and BarterDEX integration, and whatever else will be modular. 

Then at the end it spits out a summary document showing all the relevant chain related highlights so other people can truly see what your chain is, as well as a hash of the chain document information and date of time, that we notarize to the KMD main chain channel to prove a chain exists in our ecosystem (just for the coolness and legitimacy sake, so someone can see a chain information and KNOW that there was a premine or w.e.)

We need to tell our story how we differ from the general purpose blockchain platforms (which a single chain / shared infrastructure) and the block producer platforms  such as EOS. Doing that so that everyone understand what we talk about is a challange for sure, but one of the goals of the rebrand.";"";"";

Privacy is important pillar, so I would personally still consider adding it and having 5 technology pillars and 5 business pillars. What do you guys think?";"";"";

I like the new 'adaptability' pillar a lot as it covers Komodo's key strength, which is that each blockchain can be fully customized, even their consensus rules can be changed to develop powerful ""smart contracts"". In other words, we can say that with Komodo you can *launch special purpose blockchains versus getting fixed features on a general purpose blockchain platform*.";"";"";

<https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps>
You can break down the search into those that are still in concept phase and reach out to the teams making them to see if building on Komodo would be better suited for their needs. Also what types of resources, libraries, guides they need to make their projects work, or expect from a development platform";"";"üëç (1)";

If KMD is good, it's good enough to move up in this space. Right now it's a popularity contest. The projects can shift ranks at a drop of a hat. Komodo's tech is a great building, increasing blockchain and btc's foundation. The work can be seen as creative, robust, innovative and flat out cool as hell. Other projects focus a huge amount of time on partnerships, business, legalities, economics, and image. Resources get overdone, and freedom to create is hindered. Tensions build in a tight-fitted federation leaving the dev's tired and pressured. Komodo's move towards rebranding is a refreshment of personality. It gives more presence. It will attract those who have given into the hype and not artistry. There are two visions: one many use to make something likable, and the other few use to like something they make. Ok that was too long lol.";"";"üëç (2)";
