My guess there is so many tricks you can do in marketing might be hard to get just few patterns. But maybe am wrong. It could be checked tough - I was suggesting to MA team to make a review of marketing efforts by top 20 coins - what they do legal and not legal actions, and those on the edge - just to see what they do and what brings most impact. Week work for someone understanding tech good enough and marketing/promotional/manipulation methods good enough, including wash trades check, specific exchanges (by location also) with big volumes (where most volume comes?), checking inside forums, coins distribution, ads bought on google, facebook, twitter, how many true and fake followers they got, and so on...";"";"";

Yesterday, I ran into a buddy that does programming in the SF bay area. As an original SN investor I gave him an over-view of the project. He mentioned that he developed some report generating backend software for a crypto tax accounting and law firm.
 
https://cryptofifo.tax

From their website when talking about their formatting..

""The format is exactly what is needed for tax return preparation, and the¬†""Assets Remaining"" ledger is extremely useful for analyzing when to sell cryptocurrencies to maximize returns from a tax perspective.""

So my thought process is that this type of thing could be useful for liquidity providers (maximizing returns from tax perspective). I know I and a few friends have put the breaks on Crypto trading due to uncertainty of tax obligations; was planning on becoming a liquidity provider. Combine this tax reporting software with tradebot technology and marketmaker portfolio management, could be rather useful.

Anyway, is there any use for something like this? What channel/ person would be a good contact for my developer friend.
Thanks guys";"";"Komodo (2)";

the current #1 for their latest 3 month ratings is this repo: https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo  if you then go into the packages directory, you see they load the website into the rankings, changelog.json type of files as well.  Not to be too critical, they do a lot of commits and clearly are busy - they also merge from other repos into a central project repo which is both very organised and clap-worthy and also helpful for this type of statistic.  they may also have external repos that don't get counted like we do.

Komodo has separate repos for the wallets, the dex, notary, marketmaker, scale test, notary node operator's individual scripts etc.

And if we point out and be too critical, then our own development gets put under the microscope - why we commit changes in cpp across different servers for testing smart contracts etc.

ca has his own repos as well.  at the end of the day.  if we were to put daniel and steve's notes about blog posts, all our comments/discussions/edits/opinions in git instead of google docs, then there'd be an extra 1000 commits a month from the marketing department.

If the market prices such activity, then it's about as accurate as the mythical man month, how accurate cost estimations are in relation to LoC (lines of code) output per programmer etc.
