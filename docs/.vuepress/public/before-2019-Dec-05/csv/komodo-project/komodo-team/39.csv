As it totally make sense for all hodlers to make at least any action to increase their holdings value. Can we use that slogan? What I mean by add value (could be deifned by community leaders) is example download app, install it, try it, let us know your experience on reddit and bitcointalk. This way KMD gets testing + small organic marketing (people writing about their tests) AND investors increase value of their holdings.
