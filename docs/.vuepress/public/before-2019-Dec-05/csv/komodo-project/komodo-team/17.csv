I copied the conversation into a file but I can not upload it to this discord channel
Senda 
they have doubts about komodo smart contracts, some say they are not well tested
all this comes from the problems of congestion and high gas prices that the ethereum network is having
They also have doubts about how they could change the cards already created, it seems they see it complicated

So say they have 11 blocks mined and the main chain has 10, and have their double spend transactions already in place throughout the 11 blocks. but when the main chain notarizes the past 10 blocks to BTC. the hacker is no longer able to use the first 10 blocks they mined, and none of the double spends that were mined in there will work because when they broadcast the 11 blocks as the longest chain, the notarization will not match the one on BTC. so the hacker is stuck working on the 11th and on block and must perform their attack in the time period between the last notarization and the next notarization, which depending on how quickly the notary from an asset chain gets on KMD (and then later to BTC) could make it very difficult, and expensive as they would lose money renting mining power for all the no longer effective 10 blocks.";"";"";

I think the best way for mass marketing would be to find a few more other chains, preferably a top 50 coin or one that people have heard of, though I'm sure that will eventually happen in time once the team has solved all the small kinks and made the procedure a lot easier.

Another main thing to focus on would be to emphasize how it is not centralized, and how notaries cannot collude to launch their own attack. From my postings, most people seem to think that notaries are centralized and that coins hand over control to kmd/notaries if they wish to use dPoW which is far from the truth";"";"";
