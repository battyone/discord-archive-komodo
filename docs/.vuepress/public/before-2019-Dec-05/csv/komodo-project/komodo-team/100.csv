We know how quantum computers will solve problems, and can then use problems to create public and private keys that aren't easy for them to solve. NIST accepts QR proposals, but can't claim any are secure for sure until we have a QC to test them against. Dilithium module, if I remember right, requires two signatures to spend, one which is your typical signature like Bitcoin and Komodo, the other is a signature created with a problem that is presumed to be difficult for a QC to solve (I believe Dilithium Crystals is Lattice based). So both signatures are used.";"";"";
