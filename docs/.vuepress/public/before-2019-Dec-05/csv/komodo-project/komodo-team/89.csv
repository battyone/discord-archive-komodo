The JUMBLR asset chain is tied to the fees that are required to use Jumblr. JUMBLR also receives 15% of the dex-fee revenue share. Jumblr‚Äôs zk-SNARK transactions are dramatically larger in data-size than a normal transparent transaction. To create an economic balance for this increased amount of network usage, users are required to pay a 0.3% fee for using Jumblr.

These fees are collected in the following address: Jumblr Fee Holding Address

The chain will go live soon, and besides me there is a couple people working on this project. Until the new chain gets migrated there are no dev rewards, so creating new things with no funds is tough, even listing on exchanges is tough because they want funds for this. 
I believe in this project, because i have seen the value of hemp (in its use) and its close cousins as an integral part of how we can make a change to benefit our global community.
THC plans on building a supply chain mechanism on UTXO tech, this would not be possible without KMD, which is why i am reaching out here today.
