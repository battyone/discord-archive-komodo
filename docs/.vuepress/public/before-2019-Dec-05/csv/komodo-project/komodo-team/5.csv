This could happen tomorrow... it could happen next week... or it might not happen for a couple more months. But rest assured... Amazon Coin is coming out before the end of 2018.

And to tell you the truth, when a major player like Amazon enters the crypto market... it's going to blow Bitcoin, Ethereum... and any other coin... out of the water.

But here's the thing: The way to play this opportunity is not by buying shares in Amazon's stock, although I think it's a great investment. And you shouldn't stock up on their crypto coins either..""
