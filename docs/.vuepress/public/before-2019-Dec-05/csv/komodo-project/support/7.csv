"347922216429813760";"grewalsatinder#9653";"30-Jun-18 02:11 AM";"exchanges have some example shell scripts and come c files. there is an `install` script as will, if you execute that it will copy those example shell scripts to dexscripts.
reason for that is if you update or change any of the scripts in the exchanges dir and later do `git pull` you will get issues updating, as git will complain of either discarding local changes or overwriting from git commits updates. for that reason a blank dir dexscripts is there, which is not pushed with update and any changes user makes there doesn't affect git pull updates.";"";"";

It is still going on. Our project is called FarmChain. It is a decentralized system to establish farms with investors, and connect them in a bazaar (market) where people can buy directly from farmers. A percentage of products will go to investors. It is based on Ethereum smart contracts. Name of token is FarmCoin. It is ERC20. Can we add this to Barterdex today before competition ends?
