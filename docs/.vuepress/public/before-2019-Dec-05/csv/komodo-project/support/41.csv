There are at least three reasons a transaction may be too large (as guy in zcash github writing: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1970):

a large number of transparent outputs - caused by a large number of recipients
a large number of transparent inputs - caused by a large amount of transparent value
many JoinSplits";"";"";
