This new version release changelog:

* Updated asset explorers to point to *.kmdexplorer.io
* ZILLA coin added.
* Fixes the recent SPV connectivity issues

Linux: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-linux-installer.zip
macOS: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-osx-installer.zip

Linux Portable: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-linux-portable.zip

After installing the new version, if you are still facing connectivity issues in lite mode, make sure to delete the local userdata stored by previous versions of Agama before following the SPV connectivity issues guide on confluence.

This can be done by reset settings from settings. If resetting does not work, please remove the `config.json` file manually.

Data to be deleted: 
Please don't delete the whole `Agama` data directory as the dir contains your encrypted seeds
* Ubuntu: Delete `~/.agama/config.json 
* MacOS: Delete `config.json` file from ~/Library/Application\ Support/Agama dir
* Windows: Delete `config.json` file from C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Agama\ dir

When you change an entry in the `Settings` and save it, for it to take effect: 

* Click `Complete Logout` from the Top Menu
* Close Agama
* Open Agama again and login with your required Coins.

Now the previously saved settings will be effective.";"";"";
