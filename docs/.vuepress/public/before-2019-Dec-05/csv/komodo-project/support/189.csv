required changes were merged somewhere in august/september @gcharang no further update is needed
@SHossain reported that kmd claiming is working on the latest trezor firmware
I've added Trezor support to Atomiclabs' web KMD claiming tool https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-reward-claim. If anyone would like to be an early beta tester please follow these instructions https://github.com/pbca26/hw-kmd-reward-claim/wiki/Don't-trust.-Verify. Report any issues you come across.

One question though: In general, is the change address a vulnerability with hardware wallets or is the hardware wallet making sure only an internally known change address can be used? Simple example: Let's say we write a ""malicious"" wallet software for a hardware wallet, and we have a balance of 1000 KMD. Then we send 1 KMD to an external address. Now where do the 999 change go? Would it be possible for the malicious software to hand a return address to the hardware wallet that is different from the hardware wallet's internal addresses? I mean is the change address simply a parameter that can be freely chosen by the (malicious) software wallet, and if so, would the hardware double check it against it's internal addresses and deny such a transaction?

this is how trezor connect operates, have to allow popups
this requirement is mentioned when you select trezor in vendor menu
change address can belong to your seed or can belong to another entity
that's why it's very important to check on your hw device every address that's involved in a transaction
if addresses you see in a wallet software differ from hw wallet then something is wrong and you should stop using the wallet immediately
this could be either an app logic problem or tampered/malicions wallet software
