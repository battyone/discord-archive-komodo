Copy and paste seed into notepad and save notepad. Repaste seed into confirm field. Type a seed encrypt key into notepad and save notepad. Enter encrypt key into agama field and confirm field.  Save QR code. Toggle custom name off. Hit register.  It's very difficult to make a mistake when done like that. The account will open. Copy the address and save in notepad.  This will be the address that seemingly cannot be got at again. Logout. Now login using the PIN and password and I can get a different address. The trouble is this happens only 'sometimes'. The very first account setup seems to be involved. Possibly  'Toggle custom name off'. I have repeated this a number of times now and as I'm trying to recover an account I'm being extremely careful.
