Okay, I see now.

So, it seems that it's the 18.10 aspect that's the issue, and it has less to do with Pop itself.

I believe that have an 18.04 version, and that probably should be listed as the default download on their homepage.

On my own time, I will try to roll back my system to 18.04, and I will send Pop a message letting them know about what happened.

I spoke with the developers for the Pop_OS distro, and told them about what happened. (gcc-7 not being installed by default, and only gcc-8, and that causing issues when compiling from source.)

I also told them that you suggested that I only use 18.04, since it's LTS and 18.10 is not.

They responded that when running Ubuntu on server technology you want to stay with an LTS version, when you are working with desktop users you do not. 

In the past, when distro developers let their users get behind the latest release of Ubuntu, this ends up causing more issues long-term, as they get stuck on previous releases (16.04, 14.04), and they can't upgrade to the latest release in any timely fashion.

It becomes a trap that keeps open-source projects from being able to progress.

So, they're keeping 18.10 as the default download, and they also plan to push everyone to 19.04 (and 19.10) within six months of the release dates.

FYI. I don't make any opinion myself, and I am happy to roll back to 18.04 myself for my komodo-related machines. Will do it whenever I can find the time.
