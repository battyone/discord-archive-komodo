We will use a three-step process for processing claim:


1. A special transaction will be sent to your compromised address. It will be for a fraction of a KMD.

2. You need to send 0.0001 (or more) from the compromised address to the destination address you specified in the form.

... 
f your claim qualifies for early refund, please check to see if you have received the special transaction. Then make sure you send it to the re-claim address you specified on the form.
...
If you didn‚Äôt get a special tx, that means your address is under dispute, you have filed too many claims, or the amount of KMD does not match. Claims with conflicting information will be done after the easy cases are done.
