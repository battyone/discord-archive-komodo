IIRC you have to mine a block and the supply is on the node you don't expect ;)

Other things to note are basic networking troubleshooting like ping, traceroute, telnet to the port from both local and remote machines, check fw rules if any and look at the ~/.komodo/AC_NAME/debug.log for any hints.   <---- this is an often overlooked step, even by experts üòâ";"";"";

Is there something I can do on my local machines to discover how they're connecting through the router? Shouldn't there be some forwarding?

I have each node set to go through a separate router, and each one has a separate IP address. No VPN.
