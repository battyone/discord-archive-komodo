it is just a regular transaction to your self. but, the wallet has to be aware that it can send more than there are available coins and send them. i.e., the fee is negative
komodo daemon(node) and agama wallet, ocean qt wallet, all do it 

 as shown in that blog post, magnum seems to support claiming rewards but I am not 100% sure if magnum with trezor can do it

I've tried again and compared it to magnumwallet's own internal KMD addresses: with those it is possible to claim rewards, but with the addresses linked to Trezor, the claim feature is simply missing from the menu. I've spoken to the magnumwallet support and they've confirmed this. There is still no good reason in my view to have this feature disabled for Trezor-linked wallets since the only requirement is the locktime, which trezor actually supports.

locktime exists in most of the bitcoin forks; but the reward claiming is unique to KMD and as far as I know it is not implemented in trezor hw yet
> It seems to me more like that a developer has simply put a condition like ""if trezor, then remove claim feature"" even though it would perfectly work
this is not true. in a hardware wallet like trezor, transaction signing and validation is done on the hw itself;
to support KMD rewards, the trezor formware itself needs to be updated (to allow sending of ""more"" coins than already exist)
I think it is currently in development
once it gets added to Trezor, any of the third party wallets (like magnum) will be able to enable reward claim with trezor";"";"";
