Recently one of my Japanese buddies I introduced to Komodo back during the ICO returned from Japan and is asking if you guys are in control of this address: RBkXoXwwhBTRvKDqMbzAyKqChGdW1X3kqZ. My KMD's where sent to safety address back then, and all got returned to me thanks to SHossain  and JL but I can't recall this address as safe one. My friend returned, got his funds out of Bittrex and according to him, as SOON as they arrived into his compromised wallet, they were swapped to the mentioned address. Any feedback I can give him on that. Thanks!";"";"";

He just assumed everything was just fine, went to Bittrex, got his funds and then puff. Obviously he is not in discord or twitter and I completely forgot about him ( At that moment I was just worried about my own funds lol). It is what it is, he knew the risk and he will be fine about it, for what I can track it was only under 500KMD. Man, it will hurt when KMD reaches 20$.
