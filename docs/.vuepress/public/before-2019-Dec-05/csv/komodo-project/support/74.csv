Someone using just ledger wallet will have access to KMD chain only...And someone using Agama wallet with ledger will have the choice of the chain. And ledger can well sign.
The other option would be to play with derivation paths.
But the most important is that any new chain hosted on Komodo can well propose easily to users the possibility to store this new asset using ledger.
