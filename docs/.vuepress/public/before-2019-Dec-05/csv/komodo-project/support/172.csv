I have trouble with my Agama wallet 0.3.6 beta getting stuck at block 1444268. I have tried with reindex and rescan functions but it never makes it past that block.

I am unsure whether this is related to the hack event - the reason I want to move my funds - but am pretty stumped as to how I should proceed and afraid to lose my funds. 

What exact procedure should one follow? I read about people installing the verus version, but what exact steps do i need to take to make sure i can trasnfer or find my funds in that wallet?

I have always used native mode.
