**How to Generate new address quickly?**
- Use Verus version of Agama which is not affected - https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview
1. Start VRSC Lite mode
2. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD, all assetchains and 3rd party chains.  **Keed the seed safely backedup** (make a note of that address)

**Alternative method to generate new address**
- Use native mode (best to use CLI) - Safest - Use bootstrap from here if you like https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php
- Use coinbin (may not be most secure as it's web) - https://deckersu.github.io/coinbin/#newAddress

**How to send funds to the new address?**
Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later.
0. Use the same Verus Agama wallet to send your funds to your new address
