I've been trying to track down some KMD I lost in early December while doing a z_transaction (sendmany).
Seems it might have been given to a miner (not a wrong address)??
I'd like to find out what went on so it doesn't happen again.
Can anyone tell me what happened here?

Translated with Google

Just my modest opinion: In over 25 years stock market, I have often put on the best technology. In the end, I still work today.
Most of those with the best marketing have won.
Therefore, I would not necessarily recommend today in the circle of friends to buy kmd.c
We absolutely need aggressive marketing, and very quickly. The technology and the ecosystem is absolutely great, but that does not help us if nobody is interested in investing.
