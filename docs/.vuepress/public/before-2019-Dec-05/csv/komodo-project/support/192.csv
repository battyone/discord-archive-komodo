I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the ""ac_blocktime"" configuration. I do understand that we set the desired average time for a block to be mined and it does not necessarily has to be exactly the value configured.
However, while I have ac_blocktime set to 5 (which is supposed to be 5 seconds, I believe), it actually takes my nodes about a minute or so to create a new block. It's been more then few days already and the network had to stabilize at this point (that is if I understand the term correctly)
So I was wondering if I'm missing something here. Does the nodes count have to do anything with the network ability to keep up with the desired blocktime? As I'm currently testing it with a network that consists of only two nodes.
Appreciate any help, thanks!";"";"";
