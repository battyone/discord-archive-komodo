because you continue spouting inconsistencies 
`the funds come from the 75%, it is then uses as an incentive bonus`
if anything other than 75% is a ""bug""/""flaw"" then 75% cannot be a ""bonus""
either it's a bonus or it's what is due
**This** is my contention, you mince words on this subject regulary to conflate concepts and make them *seem* cohesive, and since people don't read words for what they are (but rather they use interpreted meanings), they tend to not call you out on it";"";"";
