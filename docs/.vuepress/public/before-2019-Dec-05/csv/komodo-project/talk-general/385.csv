There is a good example of how to solve the problem of liquidity. In the Bitmex, every trader using passive limit orders receives a 0.0250% rebate. The fee is paid only by those who use market orders 0.0750% . Thus, every trader using limit orders is interested in becoming a market maker / liquidity provider.

the nSPV fullnodes will create a decentralized network of nodes to support all the nSPV clients, essentially like a decentralized electrum servers, just built into each fullnode, and also will have nearly full node security for the nSPV clients";"";"";
