DEX is going to be very important soon, so will privacy coins. But the problem with DEXs have been they have been hard to use and low liquidity. Hard to use can be fixed by GUIs such as hyperDEX/atomicDEX/Chainmakers so liquidity is the biggest issue. For the liquidity problem, kmd team and my dev are designing the market maker backend. With this, once hooked up to hyperDEX, any grandma can generate API keys for their fav exchange, have some coins in the hyperDEX wallet and be able to set a profit % above CEX prices. Let's say i want 5% profit. When someone buys on the DEX, the CEX will autobuy/sell. Now who does not like free money? But my pal seeing that i am making free money, starts to use this too but to make more money instead of setting 5% he does 4.9% to undercut me. I see what he is doing so i change to 4.8%. Now we have a race to the bottom.

This arb bot will bring in all the liquidity we need, this then brings in users then in brings people just setting limit orders directly without the bot

Now there will be a % at which some think is too small to make a profit from but others will still take it. The market will self balance with people leaving and people coming.
So now we have solved the liquidity issue. Now CEX will want to hook into OUR liquidity as we will have a GLOBAL orderbook.
We will become the center of the crypto space, interconnecting all the exchanges and all the coin communities";"";"";
"459844460625526824";"hyperDEX#6586";"12-Aug-19 11:48 AM";"There will be some game theory in play. Just like BTC miners, when the diff goes up, some stop mining as they are making a loss, once prices go up they start mining again. The liquidity bot will be the same. At 5% every man and their dog will be doing it but with competition it might go all the way to 1.5% above CEX, then most people think it is not worth it. But then since the liquidity is lower people are willing to pay 2% or 3% then people get back in. So the market will have a balance of liquidity providers and the lowest % profit they will take to provide that service.";"";"üÜí (2),üëç (7)";
