The attack was carried out by using a pattern that is becoming more and more popular; publishing a ‚Äúuseful‚Äù package (electron-native-notify) to npm, waiting until it was in use by the target, and then updating it to include a malicious payload.

The GitHub user sawlysawly published this commit on Mar 8th which added electron-native-notify ^1.1.5 as a dependency to the EasyDEX-GUI application (which is used as part of the Agama wallet).

The next version of electron-native-notify was published 15 days later and was the first version to include a malicious payload. Following that Agama version v0.3.5 was released on Apr 13.

Simple instructions to secure your funds: 

0) Search your address in https://kmdexplorer.io , if the funds are there, follow the next steps exactly. If not, follow the next steps to create a new wallet in Verus Agama and use it to submit a claim as described in the following post, if the funds have been swept to our team's address: https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029932-agama-security-announcement

Please join our Discord server for real-time assistance: https://komodoplatform.com/discord

1) Download https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.5.7-4 
2) It is safe
3) First, create a new wallet (new seed)
