I got adviced not to mine to an adress i created with my nano ledger. So im mining straight to that adress.

What a bullshit.. the ledger only serves to consult balance..

BOLOS - their blockchain operating system which acts like a SPV network that does broadcast all the BC data could be overloaded if all users mine into their ledger device. This could potentially have a similar effect like a DDOS attack. 

But again - dont worry ref. your ledger - it does nothing else than holding your keys and signing the transactions. The rest happens on the client-software. So worst case if client-software wont be able to handle the Tx load just reset device - use new seed - import old seed to Agama - transfer funds to new ledger key(s).";"";"";
