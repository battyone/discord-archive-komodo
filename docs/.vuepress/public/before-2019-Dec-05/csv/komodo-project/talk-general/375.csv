I also observe they work too hard on cryptography part, and are like perfectionists.
Where perfection is sometimes a blessing it can also turn curse, depending on how much level they do.
They have already kept the network on transparent transactions enough long that now when they will go to full Z transactions, it at least still won't be a match of privacy of PIRATE.
