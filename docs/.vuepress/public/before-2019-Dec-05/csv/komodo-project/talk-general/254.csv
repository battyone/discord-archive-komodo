Also, BTC is hard to reorg and data that is written once is just as permanent as data written 512 times, the other 511 are spam";"";"üëÜ (2)";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"04-Apr-19 06:08 AM";"also being decentralized and allowing anybody to post VBK notarizations is actually bad from what I can tell as it allows the attacker to simply make a lot of notarizations to notarize the attackers chain. There is no indication this is prevented from the whitepaper and if it isnt in the source code it means VBK can be used to help the attackers do a 51% attack. After all if 300 of the 512 hashes are the attackers blockchain, that must be the right one. this is the fallacy of data aggregation. just doing a tally of notarizations gives no assurance at all to the accuracy. It is much better to have a set of known pubkeys that first agree upon the state of the blockchain, then broadcast that as a proposed notarization, which all nodes verify if it matches the local data. This is far from centralized and in fact it is almost as decentralized as sending out a multisig transaction. Even though only MofN people are signing a multisig, it is still decentralized as all nodes are verifying it is a valid transaction. To look at the limited number of signers and conclude it is centralized is not understanding decentralization.";"";"üíØ (2),üëè (1)";

And without any 51% prevention, then what is the entire point of VBK? Let us ignore that exchanges wont be modifying their code to detect reorgs as they can likely already tell that a chain was reorged by looking at debug.log where it says that the chain is being reorged. block by block. Let us ignore that the attacker can very likely use VBK to support his attack if anybody actually used this VBK notarization though, so it is probably good that nobody uses the data. Which all means that all these BTC tx serve no purpose at all, even if it was just 1 per block, let alone 512";"";"";

wrong! 1 is enough, the rest is just spam that prevents the first to even be included in a block in a timely manner therefore rendering it impaired.. claiming that you get 512 tx in a block is a fallacy and even the 1 that actually matters will be severely delayed by the 50k+ txs sitting in the mempool, unless you(or altchains?!) pay high fees which renders it economically flawed";"";"";
