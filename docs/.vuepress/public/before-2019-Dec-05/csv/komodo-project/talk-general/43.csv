I am myself on another crypto that I keep, yet it is ranked 260th on coinmarketcap and yet there is a lot of activity on the discord, the community and very active ...
Honestly, I have heard from some important crypto personalities just as the boss of Binance say that Komodo would be a very good investment in the long term compared to what it offers and its technology,
I would like if it's possible with simple words that it's finally Komodo's technology please?
I heard about an application that can be created by the komodo platform but it's the same that does not speak to me at all ...
Could you please with simple words and metaphors (if it's too complicated) explain to me what Komodo is.
thanks";"";"";

It gains that value through its necessary usage in delayed proof of work and other applications which are utilized by other blockchains in the ecosystem.   Using Komodo tech to create their own independent but technologically compatible blockchains they (developers and community )retain full autonomy of their project even if in the future they decide to part ways with Komodo.  It prevents projects from having to start from scratch by providing access to bitcoins hashrate for security, BarterDEX protocol for atomic swaps,  anonymity through zksnarks  as well as other features and customizations,  such as tokenization and custom consensus .  People are / will build projects on Komodo. Those people will utilize komodos functionality that require Komodo to use.  This creates a feedback loop/circuit in the ecosystem.  There is a lot more but that's the simple version of it";"";"";

http://pad.supernet.org/staked 
Post an address there, you will receive an equal amount from the initial premine as everyone else. The plan is to snapshot/airdrop every 6 days with 1 day in between.(testing different params each week) If you find a bug or break the chain, you will receive extra coins from the premine of the new chain. We will continually do this until we arrive at a stable chain, and this stable chain will live on as STAKED.(name up for discussion) 

premine will be distributed tomorrow at 3 PM GMT
pay attention to the POSTEST64 channel in the CHIPS discord if you're interested
