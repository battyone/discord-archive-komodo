1. If you think that me ""begging"" as you call it is easy, it isn't. Coming on bended knee and encouraging people to tip you is not an enjoyable pastime.
2. If I wasn't persistent I would get much less by way of tips
3. I have never known (with one exception) what bounty I would receive for my longer format reviews before I publish them. I ask the client to pay what they think it deserves.
4. I am not remunerated in any way for shorter format articles like the one in question, save for community tipping
5. The state of crypto-journalism is a total mess since 90% of all content is cheerleading puff pieces sponsored by the project they review
6. You making comments like ""encourages but doesn't tip"" is entirely unhelpful, and comparing me to a beggar is a foul and malicious insult.";"";"";

Then whatever you got should be sufficient.
`You making comments like ""encourages but doesn't tip"" is entirely unhelpful`
Your unedited comment was ""encourage me and tip me"".
I don't tip writers, but offered encouragement, I can't help that you're offended by encouragement 🤷🏽 
`and comparing me to a beggar is a foul and malicious insult.`
What other term would you find less offensive to describe the electronic equivalent of panhandling?";"";"";

Step 1) Don't take comments, rejections, and/or dislikes personally
Step 2) Create content that fully informs users (the use of some external links is good, but fully engage the reader and shy away from having it feel like an ad)
Step 3) Have patience and followers will come if you follow the above steps";"";"";

He compared me with a beggar and then had the temerity to have a dig about my atomicDEX article in TDC being short, and thus unworthy of recognition. 

I come back here today to inform you that the anger this community member caused me has been fuelled in a creative way. I noted that @KomodoPlatform on twitter got 90 RT's for its atomicDEX public beta tweet, and that mine was lagging behind with 58 RT's. 

I added a 100 ARRR bounty if I could garner 100 RT's. That target should be met shortly and in the meantime **I am proud to say my tweet has now exceeded the official Komodo twitter account in terms of RT and Likes. I out-Komodo'ed KOMODO.

I did not come here today to ""beg"". I came here to run my victory lap and to send a message.**
