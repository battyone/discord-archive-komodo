We are happy to announce a new firmware update to Trezor One, bringing new features, coin support, and enhanced security.

In an ongoing effort to backport Trezor Core from Model T to Trezor One, we have made major architectural changes to Trezor One that guarantee compatibility with future updates, so that your original hardware wallet can continue to function at full capacity for as long as you use it. We also added support for new cryptocurrencies and tokens such as PIVX, Komodo, and NIX.

This update will by default roll out daily to a randomly selected 20% of devices until all are patched. If you would like to access the updates now, please visit Beta Wallet.";"";"";
