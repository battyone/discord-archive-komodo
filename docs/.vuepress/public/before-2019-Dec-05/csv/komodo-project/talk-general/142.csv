This is similar to the daily kmd fee...or gas...or any type of usage based or rental fee.  I'm not complaining about the fee...I'm saying the game theory here seems to be weak...the more the price of kmd goes up the more I pay per day in fees.  It appears to me that this applies to all 'fee' systems that use the same 'store of value' token as the means of fee payment.  With a fixed payment amount for rent, the daily users (those paying rent) have only negative benefit to the 'store of value' increasing in cost or value.
