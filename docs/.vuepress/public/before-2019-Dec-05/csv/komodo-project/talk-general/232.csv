to put this in perspective, during the bull market peak KMD was at 0.15% for a bit but it has usually ranged between 0.05% and 0.1%. Since not so many follow this metric, I doubt there is any ""TA breakout"" mania at 0.1%, just a key metric from my point of view. It means that $1 out of every $1000 value in crypto is held in KMD.

The fact that this is happening at 30k sats is also very important as when KMD goes back above 100K sats, it would mean 0.3%+ of overall crypto marketcap (barring any big breakdown of BTC dominance). I think this means for this bear -> bull market phase, KMD is one of the leading alts. So for all of those that claim that KMD is not doing well outside of tech, this is a bit of perspective.";"";"ü§ô (2),üëç (1)";

 I see many thinking that it is better to charge high fees and that ETH gas model is perfect. But from last years BTC fee market and cryptokitties, we all saw what happens when the fees get too high. you just stop using it. Making a CC design without any gas required, this is a big reduction in barrier to entry.
