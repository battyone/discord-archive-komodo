5. Specific Business Models Involving CVC Transactions that May be
Exempt From the Definition of Money Transmission
5.1. CVC Trading Platforms and Decentralized Exchanges
CVC P2P trading platforms are websites that enable buyers and sellers of CVC to
find each other. Sometimes, trading platforms also facilitate trades as an intermediary. 
Under FinCEN regulations, a person is exempt from money transmitter status
if the person only provides the delivery, communication, or network access services
used by a money transmitter to support money transmission services.72 Consistent
with this exemption, if a CVC trading platform only provides a forum where buyers
and sellers of CVC post their bids and offers (with or without automatic matching of
counterparties), and the parties themselves settle any matched transactions through
an outside venue (either through individual wallets or other wallets not hosted by
the trading platform), the trading platform does not qualify as a money transmitter
under FinCEN regulations";"";"";
