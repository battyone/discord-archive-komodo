Here's a solution:
mine the blocks you're ""supposed to mine"" and let the random transactions happen in the random block they're supposed to be in be mined by who mines it (you know, like mining normally happens when you can't manipulate the probability of getting a specific block)....... But I don't want to start this whole thing again and maybe I should have pm you privat and said that Im agreeing what you are saying.
