I'm in discussion with them regarding whether they'll accept our fix but they're being a bit stubborn. Either way, we can get it to work, we just may have to build our own Ledger app that users would have to load onto your ledger (alongside the official ""Komodo"" app) called ""Komodo Reward"" or similar that you'll have to run on your Ledger to claim interest as opposed to the normal Komodo app.

This won't mean interest claiming will automatically work on their own wallets, our custom app will be needed either way, it's just with the current Ledger KMD firmware it's impossible to sign a claim TX, that's what we need the fix for.";"";"🕺 (2),shexy (3),Komodo (5),yassinheart (4)";

Well the main thing with the claiming app fee is that it will go towards supporting dev costs for other tools myself and the team plan to build within Komodo. Currently HyperDEX is being self funded and due to mm 1.0's limitations, it is like having a lambo doing at 20 miles a hour and breaks down every few miles, no one wants to use that when their GM truck (centralized exchanged) can go faster. So there is no revenue and the dev costs dont stop 😃 

We tried a donation model in HyperDEX, (dont even know if we got any haha) but due to the bear market, that doesnt seem to be working either. So we are forced to look at other avenues and this seems to be a perfect fit. People would pay 5-10% of their reward claimed if it means they keep 90-95%.";"";"";
