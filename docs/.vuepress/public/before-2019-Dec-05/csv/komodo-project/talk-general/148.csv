So developers and entrepreneurs can easily build on ETH and create tokens or dApps. But they do not get a blockchain. They just get tokens or they get a dApp with shared infrastructure (because there is just one blockchain) and this leads to massive congestion, like jl777 said above.  Komodo is better because it's not a single blockchain, like ETH is. Komodo is a platform that gives every project their own blockchain, with independent infrastructure, no shared blockchain, no congestion. And, on top of all that, each chain launched with Komodo has support for smart contracts, tokens, dApps, etc. So basically every project that builds with Komodo is given an Ethereum platform to build with.";"";"";
