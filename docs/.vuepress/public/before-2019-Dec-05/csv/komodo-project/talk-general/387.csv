Moreover, you have a total independence plus the added security of Bitcoin. When you start looking at it deeper though then it gets more complex because of all the features and tech Komodo has.

I got most all the validation working, so the proper data is indeed going from the fullnode to the superlite client and allowing it to validate the segment of blockchain using dPoW. it literally takes 2 seconds to startup, login and spend funds, even on KMD chain. that is even for first use";"";"üòé (10),ü§ì (5),üëè (2),üëÄ (3),ü¶é (2),Komodo (16),PeepoThink (2)";
