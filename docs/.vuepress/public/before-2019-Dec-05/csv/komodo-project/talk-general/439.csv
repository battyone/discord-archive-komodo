The idea (of this BARR project as they called it) was to focus the mana of a gazillion shitcoins into one collector coin, and thus gather something out of them,
like pooling the disperse communites, and also getting rid of a lot of shitcoins...
Sounded like a cool idea, and wouldn't cost anything except people getting rid of  some worthless shitcoins-
only they did it on NXT which was screwed up by the pigheaded control freaks that took it over from CfB in the early days.
Now the same guys have the notion to migrate this project to KMD platform somehow.";"";"";

If Dogecoin adopted this, would this eliminate the need to atomic swap with Doge and Kmd?
```The komodo chain cluster of coda dual-daemons is thus the ultimate solution for scaling transactions.
