looking for someone in the community to market the ROGUE chain, it will be a paid position. Since it combines an rpg which directly creates collectibles in addition to ingame gold become real ROGUE coins, it has a lot of unique aspects. It is a great proof of concept of blockchaining a deterministic random process, but it is also a pretty addictive game and could teach us more about how best to do such things";"";"🚀 (13),🐙 (5),🎆 (3),😎 (2),treasure (2)";
