Something simple, easy, that just works. SPV clients are becoming more and more easy to build, so maybe it would be nice idea to make it available for any SPV client from scratch

And I would say to forget about paying for messging, that would leave the system out of availability for a loot of users. Remember when they asked to pay for whatsapp?  well nobody remembers because that didnt lasted long";"";"";
