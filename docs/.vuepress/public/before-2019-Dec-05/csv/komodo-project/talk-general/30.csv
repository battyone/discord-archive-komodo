This is the response I'm getting from the team;

Likely they didn't buy during the highest bonus, so they get back a little less
It is possible people that bought during the biggest bonus get back a bit more
It is 14 cents vs 15 cents, a small different
Important thing is 100% of funds raised by bloc was returned
Prorated based on the number of BNTN sold
That is fair and so that is what was done
It cannot be helped that market prices went down";"";"";
