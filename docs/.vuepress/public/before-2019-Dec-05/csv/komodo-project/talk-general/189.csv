All the following processes are supported by a deeper Komodo technology called

in each section. This is because Iguana Core is the heart of the underlying technology
that enables the vast Komodo ecosystem to work together. The Iguana Core code
itself is complex and to fully explain would require a separate white paper.
In short, Iguana Core is a collection of code that serves many purposes. One function of Iguana Core is to empower the blockchain technologies Komodo either builds
or adopts to act in coordination with each other. Often, Iguana Core can advance their
initial capabilities beyond original expectations. In the case of dPoW, the code that
underlies notary-node functionality spawned from Iguana Core technology.
Iguana Core is coded in the C programming language—the language of choice
of our lead developer, JL777. The C language is designed to enable computers to
process high volumes of information in a secure manner at high speed. This aligns
with Komodo’s directives to provide security and scalability to our users";"";"";
