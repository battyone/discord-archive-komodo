You CAN have a metric saying, I want to use one node operator that has worked 50.000 jobs and had no penalty/bad data for x amount ot time. I can also go an chose a node operator that is certified by a third party, let's say a known data provider from the non-crypto space. This is gonna be a thing.

Do you think you can pay him enough that he throws away all his reputaiton, losing his revenue he worked for months/years? Let's say you find out which 10 nodes are serving the smart contract and contact them. You would have to convince 50% of them to try and attack the network, sending false data. So either change the data after receiving it from the API, so inside the oracle node, and then  send it (which isn't possible with TEE), or you would have to convince 50% of the actual data provider, the size of bloomberg, which is true as I, who opens the bet with you choose 10 big fucking providers to deliver that data.

An army of sybil accounts don't mean anything, they would be outweighted by a lot. You have for example someone with 100.000$ of Chainlink token. That is just one of ten. So you pay atleast 1 million in acuiring the token for only having more stake. Then you have the reputaiton. If you just newly created these accounts, the reputation is pretty much zero. So no matter if you got 500.000$ of LINK tokens int total of these 5 nodes, they will get outweighted after the reputation get's calculated in";"";"";
