After one year of development Utrum has launched. Utrum had a dICO last year on the Komodo platform (Supernet is one of the largest investors). I encourage everyone here from the Komodo community to create an account and explore what Utrum has to offer. Utrum is a combination of CMC, Crunchbase, Steemit, Revain, Cindicator, Binance Research, Cryptomiso, Coinmarketcal and Medium all in one simple to use site.
You can post Reviews, Predictions, Insights, and Reports, all of which will earn you OOT when doing so. Don’t want to take the time to post? Then just vote on what others have posted and that also earns OOT. Virtually anybody involved in cryptocurrency will find some aspect of Utrum useful. That’s why I believe the potential here is so high.

It has been noted elsewhere that many are looking but few are signing up. This is a project where the community will determine its success. There are thousands of members here and supporting Utrum, as well as other projects launched on Komodo, will help to make Komodo a success. It would be a shame if a project this useful with this much potential isn’t even used by the Komodo community.

https://utrum.io/signup?ref=f7cb1597fd

…and if anyone cares, I am not a Utrum team member nor am I paid by Utrum. I just believe the success of the smart/side chains will help Komodo succeed.";"";"👍 (11),🚀 (6),🆒 (7),👌 (7),shexy (6)";

Most of the fallouts, disputes and issues dont reach the outside world, yet. Most established fortune 500 brands have very few followers in the same channels we associate with successful projects in blockchain. Some of them have less than 300 followers on Twitter for example. The 'investors' as we like to label them, which are in fact non stakeholding contributors, are generally ruled by emotion inline with current price, which is actually not in anyway tied to financial performance.  The types of back and forth, outlandish and unsubstantiated claims and allegations, entitled views and opinions and general ranting, are not 'as' commonplace in more established industries. The individual attacks and personal insults are indicative of market maturity and the speculators it attracts. Big investors dont comb through discord channels, they look at key numbers that substantiate a logical return on investment. I think its fair to say not many take seriously anything that happens in any of these channels between unidentified members. The sentiment in these channels and comments made are possibly a good barometer for industry maturity and determining what type of people the current market attracts. We have a long way to go before mass adoption is reached based on the way people treat each other. At this stage the maturity of the industry is reflected in the arguments that reside in these channels.";"";"💯 (6),👏 (1),👍 (1),🐙 (1)";

I think going to Sunday dinner with all of your friends, to watching them battle royale in a demolition derby, until no single one is left standing------is a good euphemism for life..

Every single developer worth his/her salt in crypto, has experienced something similar, and in some cases they might have been the catalyst.
But that to me, is seen as growth. Like you said, pick yourself up and look at what happened, acknowledge it or whatever u need to do to move on, and move on. Don't move out. You better not go anywhere.
