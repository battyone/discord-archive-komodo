Due to an error on the infrastructure side, all of the wallets that we mined to from funds we spent personally, the majority of what we mined, are gone. Really, truly, gone. One member of our team took it so hard that we started to worry about him, but before you get concerned, he‚Äôs ok. We considered what options we had to deal with this. Generally, we wanted this chain to be fair, pure, and to have absolute integrity. Everyone can make mistakes, and we will have updates as we improve, but we believed a fair coin could be launched thoughtfully, giving everyone equal opportunity, and in a way that could support its development through its growth in value over time.

If we do not have a way to recover our coins, we do not know how to sustain the realization of the Verus vision. Most of the coins we mined, we had planned to put towards future development. So, we have come up with a plan that we believe respects the fairness we intended in this launch, and enables us to move forward. We know how to recognize our lost transactions. We will make an update that will allow us to spend those and only those specific transactions to our development wallet, and we will roll out that update, move our transactions back into addresses that we control, preserve all other earnings and transactions, not modify the total supply, not change anything else, and put ourselves back in a position to carry the project forward. We will not touch any transactions that were not ours, meaning we spent our fiat funds to get by mining or staking along with you. We will not change the supply. We will not roll back and put your hard earned mining rewards at risk. We will identify and recover our transactions, no more. We have already done a post mortem, and I can assure you that an error like this will never happen again.
