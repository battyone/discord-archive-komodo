Do you guys think it's risky to stake multiple coins and download multiple core wallets on a single laptop? Does anyone else do this? What do you guys think are the chances of 'getting hacked one day' or getting attacked by a website or public wifi that was malicious? Could they steal your wallet.dat file and your seed with a keylogger? That's what it would take to jack a core wallet, both of those pieces of information. So, can a hacker ever do this to a fairly savvy crypto staker? It would be interesting to know what you guys think about this topic.";"";"";

Komodo does security checks of third party coins being added to dpow to prevent vulnerabilities. A keylogger can sit on your machine for months without being noticed. It's important that if you're staking coins, make sure the community is well known and there's credibility.
