 WHen I installed the agama-wallet a few months back I sent >550KMD to this address, thinking it was mine, because in the wallet it said ""your KMD address"". It appeared that somehow this address was fraudulently used to receive payments. I contacted @Nabob  and @PTYX  about it back then. @PTYX  assured me, after some messages back and forth, that ""everyone who had sent coins to that address would eventually get their KMD back"", but it would have to wait until after the dICO.  Fast-forward a few months to today, I've tried to contact @Nabob  and @PTYX  again to see if they could give me an update about the status of this issue, but they simply ignore my request. Am I the only one having this problem and/or can anyone point me to a solution, and/or am I missing something?
BTW: I just checked the TXid again and it seems that the transaction cannot be found on the chain anymore...Also, the address I sent it to seems to have not received any coins since the 1st of March, which was BEFORE my tx to it...I'd really like to understand what is going on here, can someone undo transactions on the chain?
