Again, footnote 2 shows you dont know if Google saved these seeds, and the screenshot of the 400 error says nothing about if this was Always the case, or if it is just the case right now. How long has this bug been in the app? How long has it been sending seeds to Google, and at what point did these start returning 400s instead of being processed? Did the spellcheck feature always NOT work in the app, or did it break sometime after it was created. 
For all these questions and your own admitted uncertainty in if Google actually saved this stuff, you sure are certain about trying to drag open devs through the mud, and publicly claiming you're going to sue a panicking guy who lost his money and felt he was robbed by you.

They took someone who knew it was closed source and entrusted it anyway, and held him at arms length while he panicked over losing funds. 
Almost every message they sent him was accusatory and short, or some type of command. There was no personal understanding, they even quoted his word ""stolen"" to openly show they didn't believe him. Basically saying ""you're a scammer, and your life changing issue doesn't mean shit to us, but Skype with us and bring all forms of ID."" Which read as a challenge to a scammer, not as a company trying to resolve a customer's issue. They didn't even have to promise a refund, although he said that's what he wanted and he gave them an ultimatum (blackmailer isn't the way you describe customers either!) Anyone who has been in business knows that upset customers say shit they dont always mean and make threats, the best bet is to LISTEN, EMPATHIZE, and cool the situation down to get to the real problem and try and resolve it if you can. I could teach a course about how Coinomi botched this customer service and lead to a forced ultimatum and tons of negative press.

Then again @Deleted User you may be right about closed source, I'm a business person more than I'm a programmer, so I mostly see business problems/solutions. Basically that saying, when you're a hammer all you see is nails. Lol";"";"💯 (6)";

Considering Warith believed someone at Coinomi backdoored him, it's probably best to break the image of Coinomi into individuals, the one he's speaking with being one who likely had no control over the issue and wants only to resolve it.
