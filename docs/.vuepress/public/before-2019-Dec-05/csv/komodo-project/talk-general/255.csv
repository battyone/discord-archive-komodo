but when the tech part becomes easy, then it is the usage of excess funds that will likely sway voters like me
at scale, I view each NN as a decentralized (at least distributed 64 ways) source of funds for the ecosystem
so if a newcomer to the ecosystem can convince just a single NN that their idea is worth supporting, it gets supported and a chance to become real
the excess NN profits are thus designed to be a decentralization of ecosystem project management
this doesnt work so well at near the 50 cents price
at the $5+ price I think it can start having some real effect and at $50+, then it can be a very powerful 64 stroke engine
yes that is $4 mil per month for the ecosystem at the $50 price
and the logic is that any NN that manages to be in the elected position has earned the right to allocate those funds";"";"";

What helps the ecosystem the most, will help the KMD price the most, a lot more than 0.05% you might get back from kickbacks. Compared to the 5% you are getting anyway, it is just noise. However, if you support the NN who has the most impactful usage of the excess funds, that could boost the KMD price measurably. And if all 64 are all helping the ecosystem grow...";"";"👌 (5)";
