Here's another p2sh with 10.777 kmd inside, this one is a bit more difficult than the last one but still fairly easy (I'll increase the difficulty gradually) 😃

What you need to decipher in order to obtain the secret text: 
cipertext: '`PBRRVCMCZNGVSYW`, ' key: '`NNELECTION`' (the secret text is an english word so you will know right away if your solution is right)
spending condition is still ```... OP_HASH256 ... OP_EQUAL```
Good luck with building the script.
And speaking of the election, let me remind everyone that please vote for your favourite candidate before May 13th 23:59:59, and if that happens to be me, here is my voting address : `RFcGrDLnWh1cMiQqMKncFJ6b9cnt8fwKCM` , thanks for the support 😃";"";"👍 (1)";

wrote my first bot that can check kmd rewards and send notifications if 1 month period is passed or utxos are not generating rewards

Usage examples (or type /help):
/rewards RDPSgU4kmr3Xq3WSfWdeP5wah7HSP8tdsS
/rewards-subscribe RDPSgU4kmr3Xq3WSfWdeP5wah7HSP8tdsS
/rewards-unsubscribe RDPSgU4kmr3Xq3WSfWdeP5wah7HSP8tdsS

Once an address is subscribed rewards are checked every day. Notifications are sent out every day if the above conditions are met. If not met no notifications.

it's a really quick write up at this point so excuse any annoying tg messages if things go wrong
any bug reports are welcomed and will help me polish everything
