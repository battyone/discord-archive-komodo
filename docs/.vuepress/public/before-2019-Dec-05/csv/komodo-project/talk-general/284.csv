Voat seems to be open to discussion and free speech.  I did find quite a bit of racism unfortunately but I'm chalking that up to the double edge nature of free speech. At any rate, if more and more people get fed up and leave reddit for Voat (that's why they formed) then it can be a good opportunity for the smaller projects who already got there first.
