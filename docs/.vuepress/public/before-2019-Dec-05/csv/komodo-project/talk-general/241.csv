`lol maybe they incorrectly assumed guys knowledgable about all the details of the KMD code wouldn't get in the wreck the place?` 

It's irresponsible what they did, Why would ANY dev assume that noone will mess with their shit?  That's just stupid.  

Also, if you watched it play out as it happened, the safe guys were cocky and condescending from the start.  They were assumpitve and accusatory.  Asking someone to ""stop attacking their chain"" when it's not even an attack, is just laughable at best, and recklessly irresponsible at worst.";"";"";

"395274075985018880";"Regnar#6164";"27-Mar-19 05:37 AM";"but 17.46% of all BTC transactions are Veriblock, including all these duplicates? that seems like it needs a lot of work to make it sustainable. My other concern would be this entire system is essentially tied to the volatility of two different chains, and the market values of two different coins.

Some thoughts:
1. the price of VBK. if the price of VBK expected rewards (1/n of PoP miners) is less than the cost of a tx fee, it hurts the economics, though sure people will mine at a loss for a bit expecting a price recovery. The system is entirely betting on (1/n expected PoP rewards > BTC tx fees). The assumption is an increase in BTC fees means decrease in PoP miners (increase in PoP reward share), but still relies on VBK value not declining at the same time.

2. If scenario 1 happens and you have a decrease in PoP miners because of the costs, you essentially are putting the 51% attack protection in the hands of a few pop miners who could be malicious. If worst case scenario 1 (meaning VBK price decreases as BTC tx fees go up, think BTC bullrun) then you have even fewer miners (if any)

Last measure I saw showed Veriblock miners had spent 72 BTC on just transaction fees in a month, roughly $300k USD, what is the value of a VBK?";"";"";
"395274075985018880";"Regnar#6164";"27-Mar-19 05:49 AM";"I guess it can remain profitable to do for PoP miners if VBK price stays above $0.08, market cap of $21.9M.

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"27-Mar-19 06:35 AM";"VBK cost to a chain ~1% of mining rewards, which will end up being 1% of the coins marketcap. To say that VBK is cheaper than dPoW is to say that a few thousand per day is more than 1% of the coin mining rewards, so the breakeven point would be daily mining rewards of about $1000. I guess all the coins that are microcap it would be cheaper to use VBK, but for any real project it would be much much less expensive to use dPoW. However, the 1% VBK cost can easily go up, in fact would have to for the smaller chains as that chains coins wont be enough to pay for the BTC tx.

If there are 10 different VBK chains, will there be 10 different BTC tx? If so, that isnt scalable. 1 BTC tx and the entire KMD ecosystem is secured";"";"";

Since our notaries are by and large publicly known/accessible and have reputation to lose, this would be a one time thing and they are identified. With VBK, I would assume all such notaries gone bad scenarios also apply but with it being fully decentralized, there is no way to stop it from happening, over and over";"";"";
