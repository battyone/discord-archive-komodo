thus far, a 64 chain cluster has been used to optimise as much as possible and debug on a smaller scale of 45k (tx or payments?) /second.

when the docker/kubernetes part has been done.  we may look at repeating tests  on non-AWS infrastructure - but this would require finding a provider with 300-500 servers available at the same scale.  We could use a smaller farm of servers - linkedin has been good for finding organisations looking at (software) scaling solutions because they have the hardware.";"";"";

I am presuming that the difficulty was low and they only needed to change the last few bits of the nonce to find a block. Finding a block means that  
* change the nonce
* Find the hash of the block
* see if the first `N` digits are zeroes (`N` is what the network calculates based on the total hash power available, its called the difficulty)
*If they are zeroes then you have found the block
*If not go to first step agian till you find it.

In this case, the difficulty might be low so that they are easily finding blocks so the nonces for many blocks have the same starting digits";"";"";
