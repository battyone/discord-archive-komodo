I thought the whole point was - if FIAT collapses we will need an alternative method of bartering for product and services - FIAT value would be irrelevant.
you need a new method of pricing - a website that values the currency against a tangible asset.
We need a goldmarketcap (in ounces) or breadmarketcap (in loaves) because that is real value and decoupled from FIAT.";"";"";
