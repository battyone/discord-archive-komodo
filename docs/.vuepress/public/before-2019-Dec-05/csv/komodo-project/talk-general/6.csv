Therefore, as far as I can reason, the following scenario was a possibility for Block.One: Have people buy EOS → Use their funds to buy EOS in your own ICO → Have both the funds and the EOS → Repeat → Watch EOS price rise as it looks like the interest in your ICO is gigantic → Start selling your free EOS on secondary markets → profit.";"";"";

As far as the EOS, if they really did raise $4 bil and will be funding projects to airdrop to EOS holders, it does seem a clever scheme. Not sure if regulations will arise that prevents this, but the larimers have been clever regarding regulations in the past, so it might well be resistant to regulators (for a while). The big problem is what to do with such a large amount of funds. Efficient VC process doesnt throw around more than a few million into very promising startups, unless it is a later stage investment. Having 10x to 100x the funds could easily lead to inefficient investments of capital. Will be interesting to see if they can find the future googles or pets.com";"";"";
