> You need to have 1,000 DASH, currently valued at US$50,000, to own a Dash masternode, and Moo offered two kinds of masternode service.

> One was full hosting where people with 1,000 DASH paid Moo $35 a month (in DASH) to host the node on their behalf. In this case, people would retain access to their own funds, but they probably aren't going to get their $35 a month refunded.

> The other service, which is where all the affected users come from, is shared masternode hosting. Here, users pool their funds to add up to 1,000 DASH and share the masternode earnings proportionally to their contribution. People directly send Moocowmoo their money, and Moo keeps track of who owns and is owed how much.

> There are 4,843 Dash masternodes in operation, which currently lock up about $245 million of DASH. If only 20 masternodes (0.4% of the total) are shared masternodes under Moo's control, the total amount of money allegedly lost here is more than DCG can reimburse.";"";"";
