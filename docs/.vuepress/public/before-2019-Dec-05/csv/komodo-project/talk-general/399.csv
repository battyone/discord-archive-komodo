So from the doc I understand Antara is on by default, right? Because  the doc says If N > 0, Antara is enabled and  the Composer choice is between fungible (ac_cc=100 to 9999)  or not fungible (ac_cc=2 to 99).  There's no ac_cc=0 or ac_cc=1  options.
Anyway my question is since Antara is on, does it mean that all currently ready modules are active by default with their rpc? I see 13 modules in the doc, including channels, faucer, dice, etc...
Perhaps I was confused because I expected you had to pick exactly which modules you need.";"";"";

yes, with the available options in ""clusters"" section currently, the modules will be enabled in every smartchain created

but there won't be 13 modules available, but about 9

```
dilithium, rogue, sudoku, musig
```
are dynamic modules and they require custom compilation of the daemon based on selection, so they aren't available in the composer yet

even among the static modules there is a way to pick and choose which of the modules are enabled, but that too isn't enabled yet";"";"";

@Donnie This is from the recent AMA:

Q. Are there established companies showing interest in Komodo platform? If so, which ones and in which sectors?

We have an active pipeline of potential customers currently evaluating smart chains and Komodo‚Äôs new Antara Framework. We are currently working on a few strategic opportunities while building out a partner network to provide subject matter expertise across all major industry verticals. 

Q. Any fortune 500 companies or big names are testing Antara or interested in it already?

Yes, there is interest from very big companies. We can‚Äôt disclose more at this point.

When they are ready, I'm sure we'll hear about them.";"";"";
