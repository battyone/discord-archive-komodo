It is my personal belief that there is a chance that central governments will begin heavily monitoring the Bitcoin network making it unpleasant to use by your average Joe. Remember that Bitcoin is only pseudo anonymous and if they can tie you to a public address somehow they will. If laws around crypto currency aren't significantly changed for the better and you haven't paid capital gains in certain nation's like the U.S. they will make life very difficult for you. At this point Bitcoin will lose a portion of one of its most important properties. Censorship resistance. No central power or authority seeks to limit it's own power. It only seeks to ever increase it. This is the collective human nature that manifests itself in central governing bodies. This all stems from greed and there is nothing that will stop that. With all of that said. If we are talking network effects and what I believe will win long term as true hard money it has to be a privacy coin. Specifically a privacy coin whose network can scale very well.";"";"pirate (1)";
