With the Permission of jl777c, I am going to create a physical version of the Komodo coin, and I need the community's help in a few ways! First, I'd like to get some input on what you would like the coin to look like (gold, silver, with/without colors, etc). Second, i'll produce a preliminary design and you all can request changes to be made, etc. Once that's done, i'll send to the manufacturer to get digital proofs made and quotes. If everyone is good with how the digital proofs look, i'll start taking pre-orders (i need at least 20 to get the coin to be made, which will be posted on my website). If you want other changes after the digital proofs are in, i'll make them and send it back n repeat the process til everyone (or just about everyone) is satisfied. For reference, I made one for Piratechain, which is for sale on my website: https://physicalcryptocoins.com";"";"";
