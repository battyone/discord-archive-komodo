This will be for dev costs/marketing initiatives /project improvement, etc. Initially this will be used to fund a gui dev for CHIPS, then other KMD projects will be able to apply for funds.
If anyone has requests for fund allocations, shoot me a message, I would love to hear your thoughts. 
As always, please consider me when voting for KMD notaries. Thank you!";"";"🎯 (1),🍻 (1)";
