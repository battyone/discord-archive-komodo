But does the Komodo ecosystem have something like Ethereum has with Uniswap?
I think it's super cool that they have ""pools"" and anybody can create one with an ERC20 token and even earn interest.
Would be great to have something like this for all blockchains created on Komodo.

What I like about Uniswap is that it works as smoothly as a centralised exchange (when you select the ""market price"" for example on Binance etc)... you just place an order and swap.

Each PBaaS fractional reserve chain will know its value relative to Verus, based on the same kind of pricing formula as you can see in the Bancor whitepaper, slightly modified for mineable / stakeable chains. If you want to buy any fractional reserve currency in the Verus ecosystem, you will move some Verus to that chain, and you would buy it on the chain, with no need for a counterparty, meaning you would be able to sell without a buyer and buy without a seller. If you want to sell, you would sell it on the chain and then optionally move Verus back to the Verus chain. The chain's rules, miners, and stakers control the chain's reserves, which are increased when people buy and decreased when people sell. There are other ways to increase and decrease as well.
