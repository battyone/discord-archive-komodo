We know that the bottleneck is not in technology itself, but more in issues such as the disadvantages of transparency and lack of long-term cooperation. How do we organize the food system in such a way that farmers can invest in the food of tomorrow?

During this event we will look with all players at the (im) possibilities of technology for:
- A unique farmers digital identity where the farmer has control over his/her own data
- New business models where, for example, employees, neighbors and consumers can participate in the company
- CO2 neutral business operations. How do we make a tradable CO2 certificate that financially rewards sustainable business?

During Strike Two you are actively introduced to technology. Together with the partners in these 3 tracks you will test the possibilities, accelerators and threats for farmers' income. As a concrete outcome of Strike Two, an innovation roadmap is made per track.";"";"👍 (1)";
