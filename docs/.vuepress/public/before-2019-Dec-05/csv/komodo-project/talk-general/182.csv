They have historically found and fixed flaws in their own code.     zksnarks is 2nd best imo.  I dont like the zcash dev tax but I am interested in other coins that use the tech which don't have that, so I will check out Pirate.  The dPoW is interesting, though I feel like my main investment in dPoW is to own Komodo.  I'm not convinced it actually completely works and provides bitcoin level security to other coins, though I think its very interesting and might work (and at the very least, its a PoW coin with an extra hurdle required to 51% attack, so its still more secure than some other low hash rate PoW coin.";"";"";

The only reason XMR continues to have such strong development is because the majority of devs bought around $2 and have been living off it since.
