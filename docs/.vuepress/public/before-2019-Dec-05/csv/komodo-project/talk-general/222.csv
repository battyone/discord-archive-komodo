"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"03-Mar-19 06:30 PM";"so because there is no payment required other than the nominal dPoW fees for notarization, there is really no reason not to build on komodo. which means a lot more projects will decide to do this";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"03-Mar-19 06:31 PM";"and if KMD gets just a small percentage of the overall ecosystems value, then this becomes a bigger and bigger value over time. like BTC is the center of a very large ecosystem and that gives it a lot of value, even though it doesnt even pay 5% APR.";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"03-Mar-19 06:31 PM";"so when KMD has a very large ecosystem and is paying 5%, then really, what more is needed";"";"";
"376107219017531405";"Edward#3177";"03-Mar-19 06:33 PM";"All true. Patience is key here of course. Just brainstorming a bit outloud. Some incentives would help get KMD into a higher cmc ranking. Of course it would be good for speculators, but that ranking helps to show legitimacy for projects shopping for where to build.";"";"";
