I won't say anything on the exact details of what happened between K64 and RedFox, all that will be soon elaborated by other sources and the entire facts will be exposed. I will only say the entire Komodo community is victim of incredible covert attacks, threats, lies and manipulations that have been going on for a long time. It's mainly been the inside job by a specific person who holds a very important team position (and possibly other insider accomplices). He's been abusing his powers for personal reasons on many occasions, in this case trying hard to kill a rival gaming project. He organized the mudslinging campaign, sabotaged all efforts to finalize the deal and abused all those who dared to question him.

Unfortunately the mountain of dirt being uncovered seems to go much deeper than the mere K64 story. There have been other abuses and serious threats to many people, including a bullet delivered by mail. I've heard that some people have known for a long time but have been too afraid to talk. Myself I'm not at ease since these people can know my address. And they know other sketchy people.";"";"";

If he leads a criminal clique governing this project and doing whatever he wish? You've been played by this manipulator like the rest of the community. @alperC @Deleted User @Alright @siu - Chainmakers @grewalsatinder you are other names that come to my mind, like you, plenty of investors and good people working for Komodo have been betrayed from the inside.

Where does this leave us? Once all facts are exposed we could simply put the blame on the individual and carry on as before, after weeding the bad player(s) out. But what has happened is an utter failure of Komodo governance. We failed to see it coming but it's obvious in hindsight: if the same person has access to the inner team workings with extensive decision and management powers AND at the same time he works on his own business projects... that makes the perfect breeding ground for conflicts of interest, favoritisms and inside jobs. A shitstorm was bound to happen sooner or later.";"";"";
"430818734530101248";"KomodoWorld#8282";"04-Sep-19 12:39 AM";"(Poor @PTYX deserves praise that when he founded Chainzilla he first stepped down from working directly for Komodo. He never took advantage of his position)

I believe the future of Komodo requires that the existing governance gets entirely expelled and then a revamping of its methods, complete separation between a) technical development b) notary nodes c) community management and d) any third party business/project built on its technology. Maybe this could be achieved with multiple independent development hubs and forums, none of which can claim to be in a special 'official' position. For sure it can't no longer be tolerated that any individual hold so much powers while running 2 or 3 ponies all along. Otherwise it's a matter of time before the same abuses repeat.

I want to highly praise @TwilightPunkster K64#7533 and the entire K64 team. I've met the most amazing people and I believe in their success. K64 suffered a mudslinging campaign but its work and its connections are going to have enormous positive consequences for Komodo (if it survives the self inflicted pain). Also I want to thank CoinCollect @barv for making Netherlands one of the main hubs of Komodo technology knowledge and adoption. 

And for now that's all I have to say! More informations will arrive by other parties that will fully validate my statements. I'm furious but in vacation now and just got the greenlight for posting. After my return I'll do my part to help clearing up the mess left by these guys. If a revolution doesn't happen I'm officially out of here and I will dedicate my time to Verus, K64 and other projects.";"";"üëå (1)";

@KomodoWorld you have some serious misunderstanding on the Komodo Platform project, and it's governance. I don't take part in weekly team meetings, but keep up by reading on the team chat when I get time to stay up to date with team work. So far to my experience and knowledge there is no issue in team as you raised, and just assuming and commenting on things you don't have full knowledge of.
Not entirely sure who you pointing fingers to specifically, and I don't want to wrongly answer by assuming any single person and commenting about the subject. Be specific and I'll cover that in my answer.";"";"";

As covered in my earlier comments, I don't see anyone doing this thing from team. It's counter-productive in my opinion, since supporting competing projects only gives the ecosystem more skilled developers and better products utilising Komodo technology. It all helps in ""Network Effect"" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect ) directly or indirectly. Taking actions against each other is exactly like devaluing your own holdings which is absolutely against any developer and investor's own interest if they hold whatever chunk of KMD in their portfolio. So, this comment of yours is nullified in my opinion as per my understanding. I don't see any team member that much of fool to take such actions to destroy it's own project and own portfolio's value.";"";"";

Again, I strongly disagree with this point. Do you really think that person like me is incapable of thinking and taking decision about some technology or project on his own? I have a lot more than a decade of experience in this industry to enough understanding the underlying technologies being developed in various levels and being an entrepreneur of small business(es) I also have a fair amount of understanding on taking good enough decisions on my investments and involvements with cryptocurrency projects in industry. I'm very very picky when it comes to technological investments and I'm allergic to dishonestly. That's my first reason to stay far away from K64 and correcting my own mistake of buying K64 in FOMO like many others from Komodo Platform community I sold my holdings on huge loss, and raised my questions publicly before doing so.

When it comes to money, every single person is on their own. It's their own decisions which leads to profit or loss, and only they own their responsibility for their own actions. It's my own decisions to stay away from such people in K64. I do not trust K64 seeing their actions and claims so far, and don't have any trust even in case the investments part becomes true they ever be progressing good enough, as it all comes to the humans who are running such business, to which I have lost all trust so far and don't think they can gain that trust again even with millions or billions of money poured to their project.";"";"";

I respect your work and support so far you have done with Komodo project from the early days, but your allegations don't have base to my understanding and it is sad to see you going the way where you are going. I still hope you make back whatever you have put in and still wish you the best for your investments with K64, but it's that project which I would never vouch for. I just don't trust that project anymore.";"";"";
"347922216429813760";"grewalsatinder#9653";"04-Sep-19 04:03 AM";"```I believe the future of Komodo requires that the existing governance gets entirely expelled and then a revamping of its methods, complete separation between a) technical development b) notary nodes c) community management and d) any third party business/project built on its technology. ```

To my understanding Komodo Platform's governance is about developing and marketing it's product. It is exactly like an open source forum as I see it where every community member can come forth and contribute helping and enhancing it whatever the need is.

In a more decentralised fashion there are other developers, companies and organisations popping up which further decentralises the same things whatever the Komodo team is doing. NOBODY stops ANYBODY to make technological advancements and market it to public. Take initiative and do what you can. You and everybody else is free to do so. Nobody has any power to stop you to make your project on top of Komodo technology, or stop you from contributing to it's technology, or market Komodo Platform with your own free will with whatever content you make to market it. Feel free to push, point improvements to Komodo and be part of the process instead of complaining and not doing anything or not doing enough to fix whatever in your opinion is not good.

Just because Komodo team taking precautionary steps to stay away from K64 doesn't mean Komodo Platform is bad or it's so far team has any secret agenda. You having vested interest in K64 feeling hurt as it might or may be affecting on K64 token value, which to be honest is total irrational behaviour of yours coming here and complaining on your investment decisions and blaming Komodo Team. I had better expectations from you seeing your valued support from long time for Komodo Platform. Hope you see clearly some day what I'm trying to tell you.";"";"";

Enjoy your vacation. You deserve it.

``` If a revolution doesn't happen I'm officially out of here and I will dedicate my time to Verus, K64 and other projects.```
Your poor judgement on project and it's value going down is not a reason for any action. Feel free to raise specific concerns with proposed solutions which can actually be discussed and applied to raise the existing value of the community management.

Verus is indeed amazing project with such skilled devs in it's team. Hope they get good help from you. They deserve it. You been great help to Komodo project so far, and I hope you still stay supportive, but if you don't feel good around this project nobody can hold you here and do whatever you think is right. Wishing you the best.";"";"";
