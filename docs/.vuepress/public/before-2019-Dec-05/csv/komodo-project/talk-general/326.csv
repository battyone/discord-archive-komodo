When Ben Fairbank visited us in the Netherlands, we put some things in writing - but also had some verbal agreements. That there will be a Komodo Foundation and that K64 will migrate to a Komodo ""Enterprise"" edition in the future. 

For other projects, I have requested our advisor, Lord Ajay Sharma from ASR ventures, former president of Rotary to find the right people to take chair in what we call the K64 Foundation. We already have found a suitable secretary who will be announced on June 14th, and two other positions are still in negotiation. As soon as its passed legal procedures - notary, statutes - the K64 foundation will donate to Komodo Foundation to ensure its health.

Do not worry. Let the Komodo Team investigate and perform fact-finding. We will overcome this.

Together we are strong.";"";"üëç (7),üí™ (6),üá∞ (4),6‚É£ (4),4‚É£ (4),‚ù§ (3),Komodo (4)";
