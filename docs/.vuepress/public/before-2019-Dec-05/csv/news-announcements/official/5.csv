The Komodo Team is pleased to present you the worlds first (pure) web-browser environment executed atomic swap! This means that we will eventually (soon) offer our users a pure web-based atomicDEX application which runs natively IN the web-browser without any external binaries or applications thus making atomicDEX available to pretty much all operating systems, platforms and devices.
Expect a dex.komodoplatform.com or web.atomicdex.io soon which basically offers you all the key features of atomicDEX mobile. This also means that the user data, private keys, etc. will always remain on the client-side and at no time will any sensitive data be transferred or stored on our servers. When a user visits the web-DEX URL the atomicDEX application will be loaded into the client/browser and then operates purely client-sided in a fully decentralised and blockchain based fashion. Special thanks to our DEX-core developers and blockchain architects Artem P. known as @artem.pikulin and Artem G. known as @artemciy_dice who turned a vision into reality, jl777 and the rest of the Komodo developer team. Exciting times are ahead!

The Komodo team is extremely grateful for the overwhelming response we've received for the AtomicDEX Beta stress test. Due to this huge amount of participation, we hit bottlenecks in our infrastructure much sooner than we had anticipated. This led to a high percentage of swaps not matching properly. As such, we're adjusting the requirements for entry into the prize pool. All you need to do is match one swap and you're eligible to win prizes.

This is a high-level transparency report to summarise the events, results and details of this test.

We executed the stress-test with a minimum underlying hardware infrastructure which resulted in network layer failures during the (unexpected) load peak with ~2000 (!) simultaneous traders. This gladly delivered us essential data and metrics that will now allow us to fix this by refactoring the protocol - i.e. the networking part (rebroadcasting, routing client connections and orders, etc.). Our current networking model does increase the load with the growing number of network broadcast messages and thus lead to this unpleasant experience as it resulted in a “network bottleneck” where only a limited number of trades went through. Over 150 testers have been able to successfully execute almost 600 swaps during the stress-test and we want to highlight how important this stress-test in a limited environment is/was for the developers and engineers at Komodo.   Our experts will optimize the affected layer over the coming weeks and as soon as the DEX is ready for a full scale test (with multiple trading pairs and automatic spam clients) we will announce the next stress-test (with bigger prize pool) which will focus on the general trading experience as opposed to the load-test of this time.   

We will announce the winners tomorrow together with the final numbers (successful swap statistics will increase) and our team will also randomly honor testers that have not made it into the leaderboard! Thank you for your time and participation to help us perfect the DEX system.";"";"☕ (28),👌 (45),🙌🏻 (21),🍀 (22),👍 (36),🇰 (18),🇲 (18),🇩 (18),😩 (10),✅ (9),💥 (4),🔥 (10),3040_kingpeepo (10),aw_yeah (15),dancing_penguin (11),ca333 (23),treasure (11),rum (7),tux_gentleman (11),KMD (55)";

Huge thanks again to everyone who participated and kept going during the test. Komodo will announce the next phase of stress testing as soon as the DEX is ready for a full-scale scenario, in which multiple trading pairs will be tested while automatic spam clients bloat the network.

We also decided to send 0.777 KMD to everyone who kept testing but didn't win a prize. Keep testing the AtomicDEX app and send us feedback.

2) There have been daily phishing and scamming attempts on Komodo Discord server. Stay vigilant and help us to ban the scammers.
3) Scammers are using fake Github profiles and spreading fake wallets that will steal your coins. Don't click any links and always verify your download
4) To expose a scammer, you must allow Discord's development mode ('user settings' -> 'appearance') and copy their user ID (mine is 403137719049519106). Report the code to our @Community Moderators";"";"👆 (16),👍 (24),⚠️ (14),✍ (8),⚔️ (8)";
