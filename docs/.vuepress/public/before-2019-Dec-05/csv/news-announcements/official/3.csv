2. At the end of the survey, we'll ask you if you'd like to be involved in live user tests, which can be done remotely, and, if so, ask you to leave us an email address.

3. The Komodo team will select a small group of people from among those who indicated a desire to participate. We will choose participants based on the effort put into the comments in Step 1. This is a great chance to have your feedback and opinions heard in the live user tests.

It’s about creating better paths for people.

I am looking for people to volunteer as moderators to take ownership of some specific spaces within our Discord. As a Moderator, you will already be active on our Discord and you will want to help us to organise and improve our community. This won’t be paid, however, you will get a sparkly mod rank.

What this will mean in practice is that you’ll be responsible for a small number of channels and you will pin important news and clean up any spam. A good example will be the ‘community lounge’ and that may have two or three people who are willing to volunteer to help.

If you’re interested in being a part of the new Discord reorg and want to be included, then DM me and tell me which channels you’re active in the most and what changes you think we ought to make. everyone.

You can check out the test server here which will give you an idea of some of the changes we're considering (and you can leave feedback there too) - https://discord.gg/XcQfbGa.";"";"";

- Sapling Upgrade
- VerusHash algorithm, bringing near-equality between CPUs and GPUs with the fastest CPU mining algorithm in the world
- VerusPoS algorithm, allowing for a 50/50 hybrid blockchain, which can be combined with either 50% VerusHash or 50% Equihash for the proof of work component.
- Time Locking, which allows mined rewards to be time-locked for random release, within a set of parameters.
- The “Eras” parameter (ac_eras), allowing 3 eras of different coin emission schedules to be defined which alter emission, including slow start options, and linear exponential decay at specific, predetermined block height schedules.

If you have been using version 0.3.0, it is recommended to update to this version which comes with some bug fixes and latest Komodo binary. Download Agama version 0.3.1d from here - https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/
There are Installer version as default now and portable versions at alternative download page.
Keep using this version as this is sapling ready. Please don't use any version older than 0.3.0 as those are not sapling ready and send any tx using those version will not confirm on mainnet from 15th December.
If you have funds on any z address, please wait for further announement after 20th December. You need to migrate your private funds to a sapling address. We will announce guides to do so and the required `zmigrate` dAPP.
Please keep your wallet.dat and private keys safely backed up to ensure your funds are safe. With the hardfork there is not going to be any chainsplit, only one mainchain. If you keep using this version you will be on the main chain and your funds are safe as long as you are in control of your private key or wallet.dat file.
If you are a Ledger user please checkout Ledger's announement regarding our Sapling upgrade https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013635173

It basically means any confirmation number it shows for KMD deposit which is more than 1 is secured by dPoW and can't be double spent. With this exchanges are safe to reduce required confirmations to credit any deposits. Works for KMD and AC which has dPoW. Currently, Bittrex and Digital Price exchanges are using this feature. Digital Price already using 20 confs which is pretty fast. We have reached out to Bittrex if they wish to reduce required confs. We well announce we have more info. Thanks for being here. I wish you all a very Happy New Year.
