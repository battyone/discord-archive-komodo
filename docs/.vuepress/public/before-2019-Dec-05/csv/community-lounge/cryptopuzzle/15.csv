What you need to decipher in order to obtain the secret text: 
cipertext: '`PBRRVCMCZNGVSYW`, ' key: '`NNELECTION`' (the secret text is an english word so you will know right away if your solution is right)
spending condition is still ```... OP_HASH256 ... OP_EQUAL```
Good luck with building the script.
