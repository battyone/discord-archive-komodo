1) the instant you make your anti-ASIC case about a single company and not about ASICs, you've already lost any validity your case might have. 

Suspect the 'you' in this case is not myself personally... cause I am not making an anti-asic case. I am not anti or for ASIC, I buy hardware I think will make me money. My point was that the main 'anti-Bitmain' sentiment is that they are doing shady stuff with hardware. I don't see NVidia or AMD doing that... it is downright silly to think NVidia is running a  bunch of GPU's mining somewhere... But according to the 'info' floating around, Bitmain is doing just that. That is why you cannot compare the two.

2) Why should there be a ""why"" statement about nothing changing?(edited)

The statement is needed because there are people asking for a change/pushing for change. There is a 'discussion' in a number of coins communities going on whether coins should or should not change because ASICS, and since KMD decided that it will not change, it would put some (notice I said some!) of the 'you all love Bitmain' bullshit to rest. 
More importantly, it would give the mods an ability to just point to an article and stop rehashing the same arguments. Starting with JL who is prbably spending way too muc time on this.

3) In your theory that the algo should change to prevent BM from silently mining on their own, what's to prevent them from adding RAM, mining on their own, and then never releasing just to spite the assholes who changed 2 variables in an attempt to financially hurt BM?
No idea what theory are you talking about... you may be responding to someone else here...";"";"";
