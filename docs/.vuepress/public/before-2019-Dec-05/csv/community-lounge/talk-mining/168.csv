Intuition and  math guessing says both should be using about 0.693 or 0.88 of ctA.  But the ct's and their solvetimes are supposed to be used the same way by both RST and digi because both RST and digi only want to know the hashrate that those numbers indicate.  When I say ""RST"" here I mean when it looks at the 3 previous blocks.  That is strictly only wanting to know the previous hashrate.  but my more advanced equation seems to be working awesome, getting the correct average solvetime and digi apparently is getting the correct hashrate too.  It's just something to keep in mind.  I  thought RST and digi needed the same ct[]'";"";"";

The W is a simple function of (improbably fast) x  (recency) factor that can be determined by a pre-function that looks at past solvetimes.   We scale W up to be a precise factor.  The same improbability and recovery speed math can be used on the high side to replace exp().    RST is just an SMA * current solvetime/T/W. I am guessing any DA can be used by replacing recent time in it with time*current time.  Soto cover  the full range it needs 2 equations: one to look at the past solvetime distributions to get W and the second equation which is the DA.   This is what I'll test do and test";"";"";
