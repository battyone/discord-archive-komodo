a new Veriblock 9GH/s bitstream today to registered users in the Zetheron discord chat.  The new bitstream with extremely cold ambient and high voltages can hit 600MHz x 15 cores = 9GH/s local hash rate, though some is lost to nonce overhead poolside, and most people with 'normal' ambient probably only get 8-8.5GH/s.
