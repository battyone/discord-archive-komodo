1) exp() was supposed to be last.   
2) Yes, I figured the exp() would need adjusting like you said.  Remember I suggested 2xT for each of the pruior 12 instead of 1xT if it became a problem.   
3) I would like to RST data before you did the min() inside the loop.  My comments there indicate I was expcting it to be a small problem but I wanted some form of not using min() to prevent it from accidentally going into the exp().   
4) The bug of gettnig much harder is expected if your miners are doing point 5) which is finding hard blocks strangely quickly.  The Poisson has has that kind of distribution and this may be a fundamental bug in RST.  I am thinking about how to merge everything into a single equation.  

Changing exp() is fine. But I need to see the RST data with the 2x harder difficulties (1/2 ct[]) stored on the chain before you made changes to it. What block times does that correspond to?    I don't understand what you're doing multiplying that by 2, 3, 4 because that makes it even easier than we had it before where the solvetimes were fast.";"";"";
