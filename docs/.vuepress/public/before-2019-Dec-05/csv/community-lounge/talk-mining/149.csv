have a version in testing that will toggle whether it adjusts the ct[] array and digishield or not, based on that bit. i also added the averaging with prior bnTarget as that seems to prevent the very fast block followed by super hard one and seems to have more consistent results. maybe it slows things down a block or three on hashrate changes, but the volatility at steady hashrate is quite annoying.
