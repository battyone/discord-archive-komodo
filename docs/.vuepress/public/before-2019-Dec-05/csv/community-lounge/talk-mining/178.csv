If you were to look into how Komodo could be used in this situation, it would make more sense. Each planet/colony/ space station could run their own currency(chain) which solves the massive limitation of light lag factors that would be present only using bitcoin. The individual currencies would then be notarized to Komodo (light lag isnt as big of a problem because you dont have to wait for confirmations on your main chain).
Each currency would then have liquidity on the Komodo DEX, which would have light lag limitations, or people could trade direct with each other directly using their native currency using atomic swap tech (p2p atomic swap transactions).";"";"";
