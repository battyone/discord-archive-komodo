That message is ambigious. With the fixed I submitted just after th hard fork, it will now say ""Create block failed"" Which still isnt great, but at least it tells you what the issue is. 
It seems that sometimes a block is built that fails `TestBlockValidity` we couldnt work out why this was happening so I changed the error handling so that it will just keep trying to make a block until it gets a valid one.";"";"";
