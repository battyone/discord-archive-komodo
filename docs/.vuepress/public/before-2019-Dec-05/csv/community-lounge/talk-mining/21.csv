So the real difference is space taken up,  amount of power supplies .   Ports taken up at the switch etc. Still at this rate might as well go with the minis especially considering coupons.";"";"";

Since Bitmain has yet to release any specifics on the Z9 (to actually compare with the minis), it's key to accept the possibility that we're all merely assuming that they are 12 chips per card and thus 4x but they could actually be 10 chip cards that are already punched up to a higher frequency.";"";"";
