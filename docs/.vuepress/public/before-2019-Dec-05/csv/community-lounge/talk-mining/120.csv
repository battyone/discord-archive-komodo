I'm one of the many candidates running for election for KMD NN operator in the `EU region`.
I could really use your support and votes.
Usually I'm hanging out in #kmdlabs, #cc-rogue and a few other channels.
You can ask around about me and also find my proposal (node-9) here: `https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/notarynodes/node-9`
I'd be grateful for any VOTE2019 you send. `RBDivEArcb7aRsYTvtN5MRnaxeDAepSNmW`
Figure I can do a good job as a Notary Node op.
