HUSH Announcement for Pool Operators, 

As you may be aware, HUSH is upgrading from Sprout to Sapling. With that upgrade HUSH will be converting to a Komodo Asset Chain as well. We've noticed that your pool supports mining of KMD, HUSH, or other Komodo Asset Chains and felt that we should make you aware of this change. We would like for you to consider adding or updating HUSH. We are offering bounties for pools both pre-existing and new. There will be bounties of 1,000, 500, 300, 200, and 100 HUSH for the first 5 pools to process any kind of payment on the new HUSH asset chain. There will also be an additional 250 HUSH for the first 5 pools to process Sapling payouts.

Our snapshot is taking place at block 500,000, and we are estimated for a snapshot date of April 14th. Please join us on Discord if you haven't already at https://www.myhush.org/discord and message me (Berg) or post in the #mining channel and I will have you added to our private Pool Operator channel where you'll receive news and support from our developers. 

Thank you for your consideration/support of HUSH. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out through our Discord.";"";"";
