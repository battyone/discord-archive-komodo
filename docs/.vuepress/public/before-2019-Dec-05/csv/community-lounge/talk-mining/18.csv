cryptocurrency as valid proofs-of-work for one or more child cryptocurrencies. It
was introduced as a solution to the fragmentation of mining power among competing
cryptocurrencies and as a bootstrapping mechanism for small networks. Merged
mining was first implemented in Namecoin in 2011, with Bitcoin acting as the parent
cryptocurrency. One of the earliest descriptions of the mechanism as it is used today
was presented by Satoshi Nakamoto in [33]. Apart from the source code of the respective
cryptocurrencies implementing merged mining, a detailed technical explanation is
presented in the Bitcoin Wiki [25].";"";"";
