Just started mining with my GTX 1050 over a week ago, just for the experience. Started mining Verus coin a few days ago, using my cpu for the same reason. 

Conclusion: CPU mining Verus is a waste of electricity (for me anyway). 

GPU mining gets me a few coins @ 190 sols/s, but when I see other miners at 10,000  sols/s and higher, it seems there is a better way. 

Lately it appears that everyone is going the ASIC/Z9 mini route, making the GPU less desirable. I keep hearing how those miners could be doorstops soon because many projects may change their algos. It also makes sense that when everybody Is using an ASIC, then really nobody has an advantage. 

But that doesn’t seem to stop people from buying the Z9’s, sometimes in large amounts, like what ploycryptoblog is doing. I happen to see on craigslist in my area someone is selling 4 Z9 minis for $750/each. My question is: do you think it would be worth picking one up? My thoughts are that I’ll be mining for the future and not selling anything now, so maybe this would be good for the early projects on Komodo where many would be using similar algos. I’m also thinking time is of the essence. 

With so many ASIC equipment starting to proliferate the space and new/better ones coming out (and projects changing algos), I would need to mine as much as I can now. Of course, I do wonder why is that guys selling his z9 minis in the first place?

If you want some kind of in-and-out, then you'd be better off with newer GPUs to give you some ""mobility"" as to what you can do next. If you want to stay with a specific algo ""until the wheels fall off"", then ASICs will always be a good choice. If the latter, then sooner is always better.
Scale of ASICs (or any leading edge hw) is best done with the ""as much as you can, as fast as you can"" mentality. If it takes 2 months to reach positive ROI on deviceX and you can get 12 of them, then you can get 12 more in 2 months. If you only get 1 at a time, then your growth rate will be exponentially slower.
My personal philosophy, as cliche as it is, is ""go big or go home"".";"";"";
