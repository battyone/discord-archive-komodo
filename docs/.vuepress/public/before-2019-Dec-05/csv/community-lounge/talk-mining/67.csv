I have an idea, and I wonder if its possible, or why stratums work the way they do... 
Is not a pool only required to calcualte a PoW? So why does a stratum build blocks ? It seems to do things, like mine a % of block rewards to CC contacts, and such that what we want a pool to do... is calcualte the PoW solution and submit it tothe daemon... and let the built in miner code do everything else. 
It seems that 99% of pool issues disapear if we simply dont  let the stratum build the block.";"";"";
