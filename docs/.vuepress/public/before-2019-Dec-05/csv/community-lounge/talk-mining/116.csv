This is part of the process growing and of welcoming a growing HUSH to the pool as seamlessly as possible.
KMDICE and RFOX show an incorrect number of orphans and those who mined during those blocks will be made whole before the end of the transition.
Also during this transition we will be removing 0.0001 block reward coins in order to fully implement ""profit-switching"" mode by the end of May.";"";"";
