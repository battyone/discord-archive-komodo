The only thing that changing any Equihash K&N values will ever do as far as making any coin ""ASIC resistant"" is change the RAM requirements of any given ASIC.
If there is enough demand, someone will make a 20GB RAM ASIC with variable K,N, and pers values and remove any such ""resistance""
All of the valued Komodo assetchains (including PIRATE) have 51% resistance (which is the real requirement) due to dPoW and none of them have any need to make changes to the algo that are cumbersome to users and/or remove the ability to have some miners even be able to mine them.";"";"";

-- Adds the value of these together (total in sats) try sending heaps of vouts to make a really large tx value and see if it crashes it?
-- Divides by the number of vouts, 
-- if the amount is less than this number the transacion is ignored, not added to wallet. This filter does not work with -rescan or importprivkey(?) so you can add them to wallet by doing a rescan if you need to.
-> if this number is 0, the wallet accetpts NO transactions ... once a notary is funded, likely this should be the setting you use. Only allowing to send from yourself, for iguana utxo split txs.
