"228675911396884481";"Beetcoin#9049";"28-Jun-18 06:37 AM";"Looks like I missed a pretty interesting discussion about mining here. @ComputerGenie I certainly get your stance, but I think the point you keep missing is that by allowing asics, and not trying to become asic resistant, you're effectively allowing for a large corporation to wipe out a union of smaller corporations and individuals both competitively and financially. A simple change to the equihash algo does indeed render most purpose built asics useless, and they'll continue to reshape and repurpose their hardware to create new versions, that's fine with their business model over at Bitmain, and doubly so if you believe they mine on the products before sales. This basically isolates and marginalizes your core adopters whom, admittedly, were well rewarded for doing so, but have grown attached.

I guess from a mining perspective, I don't see the benefit of becoming ASIC Tolerant. Perhaps I'm missing a big picture here, but is there any real benefit towards standing idle while ASICs run up the difficulty and nethash? I can certainly see the downsides of ASIC tolerance. By that decision alone, whether or not intended, KMD is deciding to not support those that have supported them, and will stand on the sidelines and do nothing while a big corporation comes in and makes their chain completely unable to be supported by GPU miners, therefore making it more centralized in practice because you'll have fewer miners carrying the weight.";"";"";
"228675911396884481";"Beetcoin#9049";"28-Jun-18 06:37 AM";".I guess a lot of people are just sitting back trying to figure out how ASICS could benefit KMD more GPU mining in a scenario where they have most of their support wiped out. Its not like you'll have miners mining at a loss just because they are fans, and in cases like mine, I'm holding KMD exceptionally long term because I find its potential to be the most promising, but I'll have to point my rig in a new direction here in a few days as profitability crashes in part to difficulty and market concerns. I think at the end of the day it just leaves a bad taste in everybody's mouth, even if they like the tech, its damaging to early adoption.";"";"";
"440969153227259914";"jansako#3330";"28-Jun-18 07:22 AM";"I got my Z9 mini a few days ago. This thing was so clean there is no way it was run for any relevant length of time before shipping. They may run others before selling them, but not the one I got.
As Computergenie pointed out, the price of a 1080 Ti and a Z9 Mini are almost the same, so your point about a mega corp wiping out small miners is not valid. If you can afford one, you can afford the other.
Wiping out the current, existing GPU miners is  a different question. Money talks, as we say here, and miners do replace their hardware (they should anyway). If using ASIC will get more profitable, even the small miners will buy them, if GPU's are more profitable, miners will buy those too.";"";"";
"440969153227259914";"jansako#3330";"28-Jun-18 07:24 AM";"I would even argue that a z9 significantly lowers the barrier of entry for a miner! I built my first GPU rig some months (yeah I know) ago for ~3600 USD. Again comp[are to the price of a z9...";"";"";

The point is that you have a sketch company, one who not so privately goes out and attacks coins denouncing asics during the launches of their asic platforms by paying for nicehash users to 51% attack the network and/or drive up difficulty so high while failing a 51% attack ,miners are forced off the network for profitability's sake.";"";"";
