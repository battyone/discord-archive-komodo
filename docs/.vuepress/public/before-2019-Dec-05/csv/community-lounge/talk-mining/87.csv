@jl777c this check is failing for @NutellaLicka 's RKT(sapling test chain) pool. I looked at the block and transactions in it. Can't figure out why. 
It's outputting this. `checkdeposit: ht.25019 checktoshis 2.55990000 overflow.0 total 2.56000000 strangeout.0`

What are you really ""stealing"" if you spend 2.56 ARRR to get 2.56 ARRR? At best you're breaking even. Granted it leaves no financial overhead to be a dick and leave the op with a 0 fee; but, currently the only other alternatives are ""Hey, that tx fee you just paid, no one gets it it just gets vaporized"" and rewriting the entire payout system of any nomp fork you want to support";"";"";
