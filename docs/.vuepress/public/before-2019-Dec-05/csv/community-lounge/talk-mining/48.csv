There isn’t a Mega Hash (thousands of hash per second) to Solutions (solutions per second) conversion. Ethereum uses Dagger Hashimoto algorithm, and Zcash uses Equihash algorithm, they are completely different.

Look up the Solutions/s rate based on your Card type: `https://en.m.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=ZCash_mining_GPU_Comparison&stable=0&redirect=no `
(For instance a Nvidia 1080ti gets an average of 650-680 Solutions per Second) then add up your Cards+Solutions and plug that number into:` https://whattomine.com/coins/166-zec-equihash?utf8=✓&hr=680&p=280&fee=0.0&cost=0.1&hcost=0.0&commit=Calculate`
`Then you can calculate your coins/profit per day for your rig.`";"";"";
