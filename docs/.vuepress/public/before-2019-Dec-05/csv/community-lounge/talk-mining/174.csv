"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"12-Aug-19 08:21 PM";"is basically the same as normal switching, but instead of gaining more blocks, you just make everyone else get less";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"12-Aug-19 08:22 PM";"idk, still formulating ideas, I just find it strange that a miner can raise the diff(drastically) at will by changing nTime";"";"";

like can I just keep mining at these massive diffs and the network not reorg to the honest chain(longer but less pow) because of it?";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"12-Aug-19 08:30 PM";"ok let's say chain is at very high diff because of time stamp thing I just mentioned, it's stuck at block 100

honest miners wait until diff comes down and produce block 101 with low diff, then block 102, 103, 104, 105

I ignore their 101-105 and produce my own 101 at block 100+1 second and very high diff

if my 101 chain has >pow than their 105 chain, will the network jump back to my 101?";"";"";

Perhaps someone with 25% HR could assign a +1 stamp whenever he found a block..I'm not sure this can actually raise avg difficulty for others.....but if it can, and if it's like other chains where 70% of miners leave if difficulty rises 30%, then he can simulatneously do 5 to 10 block private mines and submit those.....at much lower difficulty cost due to the public chain not having gained much work due to 70% leaving.
