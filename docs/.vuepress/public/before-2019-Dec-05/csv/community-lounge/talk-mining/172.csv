It's the control of net work.    However, 3 people actually showing an interest (or misunderstanding that I was being both serious and ridiculous)  in ""ball of energy"" got me thinking about it.  The ball of energy is not supposed to be exactly energy, but should store,  transfer, and release of  net work energy.  Joules of heat are completely useless, or at least wasteful if driging a steam engine.   But look at this: we work for money and that work we do puts some amount of net energy into society.  Then we spend that money to extract net work energy back out.  So although it is more immediately precise to say money is control of net work energy, the amount of currency in our hand is a control of a ball of energy floating around in society.  If law and economics are acting correctly we put that energy out there in exchange for the bills and the bills can extract it back out.";"";"";

@jl777c These are the 0.5% per blk numerator constants for W=2 to 16 if denominator is 100.   I could not find a simple equation to generate this.  Let me know if you want to go to a higher or lower trigger threshold than 0.5%  My belief is that they will not provide much help over 2, 3, 6, 12, but if  your code is well-suited to scanning and doing these, here they are.  I just started trying to mimic what you're doing today. This was a preliminary step.";"";"";
