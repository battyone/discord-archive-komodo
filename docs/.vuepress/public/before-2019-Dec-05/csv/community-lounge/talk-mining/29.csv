This is due to two factors,  1) lack of double coincidence of wants 2) overwhelming amount of soft good vendors ( services ) compared to amount of hard good vendors.  (Products/things).  The 2nd exacerbates the first.   Mining will provide a hard good into the barter exchange economy ,  and the icing on top is that hard Good is comparatively liquid.  Eventually the farm will resell miners, lease hosting as well.  FinCEN also has given the green light on selling mined coins as not being money transmission.   The overarching idea with the barter exchange is to create a credit network in the Komodo ecosystem giving it a stablecoin.
