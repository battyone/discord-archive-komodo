As a professional miner, that says to me that you have 0 actual belief in the longevity of the currency itself and I'll address that in a bit, but first I must do a bit of ""window shopping"" to address how off the math is in the selection of a vanilla S9 in the 1st place (and then I'll come back to the insane idea that Core doesn't already have a ""emergency hardfork"" [that adjusts the diff formula] prepared for lack of hash after bcash created essentially the same issue).";"";"";
