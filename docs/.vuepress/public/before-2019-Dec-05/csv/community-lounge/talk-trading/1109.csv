All I can say, is that they are serious allegations about someone we all work with. I for one put my head down and my bum up at all times, and I am firmly of the belief that you respond to what warrants responding to. I value my words so I always choose them very carefully. We have enough to focus on with the development of tech and with running the day to day. There is no time to become involved in such trivial matters, nor is there the need to divert any effort into addressing such matters.
We all have a job to do and we go back to what we have been doing well for an exceptionally long period of time. We focus on the right things and the things that matter.
