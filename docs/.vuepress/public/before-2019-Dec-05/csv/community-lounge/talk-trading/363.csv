@Likewise we hit target 1 yesterday, the most obvious place to pause... similar story in other alts, pausing at key levels but still looking bullish. Up from here is the real breakout, especially on the KMDUSD chart. Next targets are 28000 (which should be less of an issue now IMO) and 33000. But the real targets for this run medium term are around 60k. To me this is conservative, for crypto, and part of me wants to project further for some serious fomo but that may require some strong catalysts to bring in new waves of of speculators, or whatever whales have taken the large positions in the last 5 months to just pump through obvious levels and freak out any sellers into buying back etc - less likely but could always happen, especially if bitcoin has actually found or has nearly found it's low.";"";"üëå (1)";
