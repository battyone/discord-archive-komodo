A crypto token as a warehouse receipt.   Sure you can give a piece of paper receipt or an email .  But those are forgable.  And signing is an additional action required in normal receipts where sending a token implicit requires a personally identifying signature.    When you are trying to bridge the gap between real world and digital there is going to be a need of some gateway individuals and businesses .  But a token is just as much a legal claim as the paper receipt is.  And has more benefits in terms of durability, interoperability, function, unforgability, and immutability.";"";"";
