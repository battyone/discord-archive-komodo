This is the old system trying to fight for their life and keep the old ways, it's always bound to happen. Tax is a big issue with crypto, we are basically going back to the middle ages where you had to go collect in the villages. I believe it's gonna come down to taxing money directly from paychecks. I would like to see a system where tax or anything related to infrastructure is paid on a by need basis, government scale down dramatically, direct impact on what you pay for. you could make a crypto payment directlys for that pothole in your steet and make sure it only get's used for that, you'd have direct voting control over your money instead of giving money out randomly and hoping someone in a high castle does the right choice. utopic dream for now though >_> maybe in 50-100 years i am hopeful.";"";"";
