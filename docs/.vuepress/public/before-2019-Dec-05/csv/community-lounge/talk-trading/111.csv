Also it's possible they could try to influence BTC core to imeplement what they preffer. In the end it's possible the official BTC will be the one strongly connected with officials and controlled by regulators. Of course the other forks and other alts may exist.

In a not so surprising move, the SEC has denied the proposed ProShares ETF, as we predicted would happen in our last post. 

The ProShares ETF is very different from the VanEck ETF. 

The primary reason, and why we think VanEck (due in September) has the best chance of success, is because VanEck intends on settling contracts with ‚Äúphysical‚Äù bitcoin (bitcoin actually owned to back the ETF).

ProShares, on the other hand, is playing around with leverage, on an already volatile asset, and is backed by Bitcoin futures (a 9 month old product). 

It really never had a shot.

Read more from the SEC here: https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysearca/2018/34-83912.pdf

Bitcoin has been extremely volatile as we suspected, it‚Äôs best to wait and see where the dust settles before rushing into any trading decisions.";"";"";
