we have reached out to JL777 who is fixing this issue as we speak. We have had multiple opinions on what to do with the funds, 
from keeping them in our reserve for future developments, to a complete coin burn of all additional coins.
There are currently """"31,742,881"""" coins which have been minted from the founders CC out of a total circulating supply of around 130,000,000.

We would like to reach out to the community and find a solution that works with everyone, while furthering
the vision of √ò CryptoUnion. One of the ideas and feedback we have received is that we should make use of the
 funds in a fair way that  benefits everyone (Early investors, Komodo holders, OCU, New investors and Development)


We have taken into consideration the % of inflation, the current low price of OUR, the fundraiser investors, and the effects
that these extra tokens will have on the price action. We would like some more feedback on whether this would be an appropriate solution and would 
like to hear back from you, whether here or in private DM.";"";"";

‚Äî 15% airdrop to Komodo holders, to gain more interest in the project, to spread the supply out more evenly ensuring fair distribution without having 1 or 2 people holding most of the supply, 
as well as a thank you for the platform which has made this whole project possible for us;

‚Äî 5% reserved for twitter contests and discord drops, to thank you all for being in this community and to have small giveaways and contests;

‚Äî 25% Auctioned off in 30 lots of 250,000 OUR for BTC, the BTC of which will be held in a publically viewable address, with the BTC funds dedicated solely for the purpose of
coin listings and advertisement in the future. This would be a better solution than the current model of asking for donations to list on bigger exchanges, as well as giving everyone a chance to get
some more OUR at cheaper rates. This allows us to receive BTC without having to sell our native token, or causing downward price pressure while solving the issue of raising BTC for exchange listings;

‚Äî 10% Founders to use for further development of the platform.

This small early inflation would also lower the entry point into our OCU investment and loaning platform, allowing more people to get a higher membership tier for the same amount of OUR held.";"";"";

it is more of an interest/publicity problem, and the airdrop will definitely help with that
I think that, along with burning any additional funds on top of whatever is currently in that address, would be a good solution


We think that auctioning off ""additional"" supply minted for BTC for purpose of furthering listings only and allowing more investors in really makes it work out to be a very good thing if it goes ahead";"";"üíØ (3),‚úà (4),üá© (4),üá∑ (4),üá¥ (4),üáµ (4),Komodo (3)";
