Cosmos is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain interoperability project based on the Tendermint consensus protocol. Cosmos and Tendermint aim to provide a fast and highly scalable consensus protocol and reduce the time and complexity involved in building Blockchain applications, providing a stable interface for popular programming languages. Cosmos comprises a decentralized network of independent, parallel blockchains, each powered by the core consensus protocol, with constituent and derivative blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem understood as “zones” operating in proximity to the principal. ATOM is the token powering the main Cosmos Hub.";"";"";

In the beginning, we thought that the advent of this trend was a technological advance. It seemed as if it served as a component of a large ecosystem of blockchain and combined with each other to create technological/social values. however, the development of technology and the diversification/multiplexing of technology are completely different concepts. Since blockchain is a protocol based on machine-to-machine communication, it cannot be considered progress unless it is a single protocol. 

nevertheless, now the most promising time in the blockchain industry than in the past six years. I don't think to ruin party, but I think I was drunk for a while. the more I get to know, the more grand this technology is than I thought, and it's worth spending the time and effort ahead. this time may be the only chance to focus on the essence.";"";"PeepoThink (1)";
