Instead of just putting up an order to sell ark for omg, would the system be able to bring in person B and C?

So if person A is wanting to swap ARK to OMG, and no current orders available. 
Person B wants to go from OMG to NEO. 
Person C wants NEO to ARK. 
Would a system be able to be implemented where person A B and C are automatically matched and swapped? Seeing as fees are low enough for multiple trades to reach the endgoal outcome?

The thing with BarterDex presently, is that if such a multi step path exists with online/active liquidity providers, it‚Äôs just a matter of the client barterdex api user finding that route an executing it. Writing a bot that would do that might not be terribly difficult. You‚Äôd need to listen to the peer network and see what pairs do exist, what the utxo/liquidity of the various players are.
