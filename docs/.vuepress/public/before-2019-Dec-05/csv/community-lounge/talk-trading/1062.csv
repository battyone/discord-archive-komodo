DEX is going to be very important soon, so will privacy coins. But the problem with DEXs have been they have been hard to use and low liquidity. Hard to use can be fixed by GUIs such as hyperDEX/atomicDEX/Chainmakers so liquidity is the biggest issue.

For the liquidity problem, kmd team and my dev are designing the market maker backend. With this, once hooked up to hyperDEX, any grandma can generate API keys for their fav exchange, have some coins in the hyperDEX wallet and be able to set a profit % above CEX prices. Let's say i want 5% profit. When someone buys on the DEX, the CEX will autobuy/sell.

Now who does not like free money? But my pal seeing that i am making free money, starts to use this too but to make more money instead of setting 5% he does 4.9% to undercut me. I see what he is doing so i change to 4.8%. Now we have a race to the bottom.";"";"";
