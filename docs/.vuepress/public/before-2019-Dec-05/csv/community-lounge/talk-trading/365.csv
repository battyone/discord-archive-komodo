Apple reported out of hours, massive spike across many (apparently) related markets due to low liquidity/market closed/gaps on open/mass liquidations, end of story. Ridiculous that the world can literally be pegged to one company, albeit for 5 minutes of stupid algos etc.... as if the stock market = apple, and the stock market = the economy, so economy = apple... what is going on?? markets have become a meme, no reasoning matters anymore.
