It doesn't matter, Komodo ecosystem is like a puzzle and the pieces are coming together slowly but nicely. Bigger picture will be more visible, when all this tech will start to get real usage. 
- Ppl will use DEX, bc it will be easy to use and liquid, trustless and without KYC, atomic-dex will have the easiest onboarding ever. 
- Ppl will use PIRATE bc transacting with privacy makes much more sense then revealing my balance to other party. 
- Ppl will use KMD bc it will be one of the most liquid base pair in DEX. Look at the value of Litecoin, all of that comes from liquidity mostly.";"";"üëå (4)";

```
Everything. And we are taking the necessary steps to protect ourselves and others. At the time, we thought we had a good partnership going on. I had almost daily conversations with their CEO. At the time of the partnership agreement, K64 was under a different company structure and mistakes were made on our side - which nearly cost our funding twice. RedFOX Labs was aware of the nature of these issues and we decided to keep the nature of the partnership under the radar. However, since RedFOX had an opportunity, we decided to back RedFOX with an official statement of our partnership agreement on our Twitter account. 

We (@Meyse and myself) had planned on the day on the live stream to finalize that deal. Out of nowhere, the CTO of RedFOX Labs called us an exit scam. I called the CEO regarding the nature of what was going on, and the response we got is that if we made the transfer all would go away in a second. Then - and I quote ""a line is drawn in the sand"". As Max was also already director, the both of us decided not to continue with the transfer at all. It didn't take long to see certain things being unfold. 

We offered RedFOX Labs to renew the terms of our partnership and since there was a DD planned were, time was of the essence, the CEO needed this to be dealt with before that time. That's why Max flew to Vietnam. However, they apparently weren't going to sign anything. Max who put everything aside, felt quite upset because of this. Eventually threats with lawsuits were made and an insinuation of that the CEO of RedFOX Labs was ""worried about his safety"" (speaking of Max). He called me a liar and Max my puppet. Not the solid base for any partnership.

Sadly, we had to review our situation and more rabbits came out of the hat.
(we will further disclose these rabbits soon)

How is K64 team planning on integration of blockchain into gaming now that KMD and Rfox has withdrawn their support towards their project. How is K64 planning to train their team?
```
We can already build our Antara modules and have enough people on board with the right skills. We are currently doing sessions where team members train each other and are developing our own training materials. 

Regarding the integration of the blockchain, we assume that Komodo is truly decentralized - but assuming things have always worked out bad for us - so, we most likely continue as we are doing now. However, we are considering a fork or reaching out to Verus. However, that is a road that takes planning, time and resources.";"";"";

I will only say the entire Komodo community is victim of incredible covert attacks, threats, lies and manipulations that have been going on for a long time. It's mainly been the inside job by a specific person who holds a very important team position (and possibly other insider accomplices). He's been abusing his powers for personal reasons on many occasions, in this case trying hard to kill a rival gaming project. He organized the mudslinging campaign, sabotaged all efforts to finalize the deal and abused all those who dared to question him.

Unfortunately the mountain of dirt being uncovered seems to go much deeper than the mere K64 story. There have been other abuses and serious threats to many people, including a bullet delivered by mail. I've heard that some people have known for a long time but have been too afraid to talk. Myself I'm not at ease since these people can know my address. And they know other sketchy people.```";"";"";
