The attack was carried out by using a pattern that is becoming more and more popular; publishing a ‚Äúuseful‚Äù package (electron-native-notify) to npm, waiting until it was in use by the target, and then updating it to include a malicious payload.

The GitHub user sawlysawly published this commit on Mar 8th which added electron-native-notify ^1.1.5 as a dependency to the EasyDEX-GUI application (which is used as part of the Agama wallet).

The next version of electron-native-notify was published 15 days later and was the first version to include a malicious payload. Following that Agama version v0.3.5 was released on Apr 13.
