It retraced 90% from the all time high, and is now 40% above it's bear market low. KMD did retrace 90% from it's all time high, and then it's risen 90% from it's bear market low, and now it's at about 52% above the bear market low despite the sell off spike from 25k to 20k and cardano still rallying strong. (Percentages are a bit annoying to talk about as upside percentages are always larger than downside.... 90% correction is like 1000% upside in reverse, I'm sure you know this üòâ  )

Within the bear market other coins have had nice rallies though. KMD has had choppy upswings, seems more of a persistent downtrend, but the lows have also been carved out better (started to find bottom sooner), other coins only recently made lows so they may be ""less stable"" lows. Other coins are more tradable as they are more liquid, so downtrend has had nicer upward corrections to trade I guess.";"";"üëç (2)";

I think projects like Cardano that are flushed with cash, will have a large following and large volume so they trade differently than Komodo which trades more on potential. I also think the recent run on KMD was initiated by one whale (I think it was an insider which I guess would be considered a good sign), with other buyers coming in because of expectations when a whale starts buying. In the end that whale created enough excitement that KMD is now trading at 20k instead of 15K which is fine by me. I think until Komodo comes out with something that creates excitement again (or insider starts buying again before said excitement) it will follow Bitcoin/alt-coin markets (more or less). But it has to be said that I'm a horrible trader so take anything I state with a grain of salt.üòÅ";"";"";

interesting ETH seems like it's not buying it, maybe rallied hard enough already. KMDETH, it's time to shine üòâ";"";"";
