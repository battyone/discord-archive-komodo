 - Komodo doesn't ban people unless they impersonate others or spam pump groups
 - Komodo has not been removing messages from channels even if they critizise us
 - There are rumors going on about threats of violence from the Komodo team, which I have been unable to verify myself nor have I heard any explanation about who's been making them, how it happener, nor what they have said exactly. Just claims, which seems to be an attempt to hurt our reputation.

Please be sceptical about what you hear and try to get to the bottom of it. Most of the time everyone just makes claims. If someone knows more about this you can PM the info to me.

Same goes for why Emmanuel left. We don't know for sure why he left as he never said anything. I wish he comes back as he indeed was contributing to the community and had the balls to stand up and disagree, which is all good.";"";"üíØ (2)";
