Bitcoin structure is in an apex, a constricting triangle with both up and down trends for the last days or so, ethusd is right at a longer term down trend line and should in theory be a place to drop from, KMD has been bouncing on support and volume has increased a little. Apex structure can generally break up or down, however the price behaviour, and traders behind it, to me, is bullish. Every dip is getting bought up on smaller time frames and despite being at resistance and any other number of factors for a bearish case, the price behaviour is holding itself up, very close to the resistance, not reacting and selling off as it should in theory. 

Now we could break down, but to me, we should have already broken down if we were, price is behaving in a way that it's less likely. I believed we would break down at first, but then upside, but the market is behaving like crypto does sometimes, and suddenly becomes more irrational obscenely favouring one direction, e.g. eth trend lately. The other thing is I've seen some reasonable volume sells on lower time frame, sellers are selling the resistance, but each is getting bought up. Could be a market maker making test sells or pushing us to break down... maybe volume will increase and we'll see. Either way next move will be larger IMO.

It's still almost a 5050 from here, I just like the upside, and if it is upside, it's set to be strong due to the shorts that will get stopped out and the buying back that will occur if we break up. Inverse goes for downside, however scope for a major new low is limited, 3k was the target for many, and 2nd chances will get bought up";"";"";

looking at 3500 zone and up for btcusd, until earlier today this seemed more likely to me, so many longs to shake down, especially for eth too 

I just thought market was being irrational today, as crypto does sometimes. Generally it helps to have 2 scenarios in mind, and non traders will say that is so you can say ""you are right"", but it's so as not to be surprised when things don't go your way, and to moderate expectations of what is possible and probable

so when ""everybody knows"" or everyone follows the same TA it actually breaks that particular TA method, and when everybody knows one thing, it's often the time to do the opposite... after all it's a fundamental law of nature that when is something at it's most extreme, that is the reversal point (after the darkest point of night it's going to get lighter etc). When literally everybody knows it's going up and the last person to want to buy has bought, there is nobody left to ""know"" anymore ;)

many indicators do actually show things like moving averages and you can read your tealeaves from those - mean regression, above or below averages = x, whatever you want. IMO most of that is clear without the indicator to tell you you are above an average or you are diverging etc

but yeah when buyers start outweighing sellers or vice versa, it makes patterns, and people see it whether they use indicators or price movements or whatever. I thought buyers were outweighing sellers, and they were, but on short time frame. 


BTC market structure has interesting behaviour and certain predictable indicators of sorts compared to other markets, but in the last year it's started being abused more by market makers and new algo trading. So when everybody does one thing, market maker/bigger players can use that to their advantage (if there are too many buyers at the moment, they can do some heavy selling to create a stop loss cascade and some short term panic exits/selling. Talk of manipulation has been since the beginning of BTC, and it's across all market, but whatever is going on on medium time frames in BTC (15min to hourly candles), it's grown up a bit";"";"";
