If memory serves, projects were being charged 100 kmd per year to notarize.  Even if the prices of dpow got 10x'd and projects were charged 1000 kmd and lets say 1000 projects chose to use KMD.  That is still only 1,000,000 KMD per year.    With a circulating supply of over 111 million, that is less than 1%.  That is unlikely to put any upward pressure on KMD price at all.  Kind of a non-event for KMD investors.";"";"";
