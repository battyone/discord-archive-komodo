think about how you gonna manage that.
You have good amount of time to learn and raise your level of understanding on managing different aspects of such things.
if you think you lack knowledge to manage that level of financial gains you could probably gain in future, you should be investing your time in learning those skills than panicking on prices etc.
Even being a non-developer you have very very rare and good opportunities in your hand, right now.
use it. and be ready for coming years with your newly gained wealth and knowledge.";"";"üëç (2)";
