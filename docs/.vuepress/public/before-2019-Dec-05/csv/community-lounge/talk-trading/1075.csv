Now i am not saying that we need a model, we need someone that is smart and can talk about the tech. If their outward facing attributes help to convey that, not too sure why we should not use that to our advantage. Considering the demographic of crypto users, if i got a man to do it, it probably wont have the same effect.";"";"";

Lots of big aspirations and flashy marketing with very poor leadership and little in the way of showing any achievements. They have shown a lack of understanding or willingness to actually incorporate a smart chain into their games, stating they'll build the game first and then add in the blockchain stuff later. They have also claimed they received a 78million investment from Goldman sachs along with claiming they are investing 5mill into rfox, which both. claims currently have no evidence or proof they are true.

More info:
Early on in the piece, they said they were working directly with jl777 on NFT/Crypto condition code for their SDK and games. They also publically dismissed/ridiculed one of the KMD devs (blackjok3r) when he started asking questions(who was actually eager to help this project), finding holes in their development claims and breakthroughs.
They(with the help of a KMD service provider, who they promised to reimburse with funds, flight to the Netherlands and promotion after helping) created a smart chain that has no crypto condition support and that they received 100% of the 64million coins(mining reward is 0.0001K64).
A member of their team ""fat fingered"" a large sell order on DP early in the piece (not sure of the amount or total KMD they received).
They have promised announcements or releases of information and continously delay the release of any substantial information.
The KMD team have publically stated their opinions on the project. Just look in the archived channels in discord.

Ill admit, after a few promised announcements and publically berating blackjok3r, I've stopped following them as much, so please correct me if I misspoke. Feel free to make your own mind up and dyor, but I'll be gladly corrected if this project is legit and goes on to do great things.
