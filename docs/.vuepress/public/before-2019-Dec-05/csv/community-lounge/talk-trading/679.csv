What he means is he wants the team to blow scarce resources on fluff in order to generate a short term pump to cover his speculative losses. Now he says that refusal to do that is ""dumb"". I happen to think it's responsible stewardship and the mark of a project that is smart and forward looking. Resources are spent on real development, infrastructure, supporting ecosystem projects and, when the time is right, marketing geared to actual end users. I'm long and strong, based on the best ideas development in the space, and a wonderful and growing community of development talent.";"";"💯 (2)";
