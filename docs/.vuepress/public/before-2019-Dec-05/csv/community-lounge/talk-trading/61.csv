The guy before you pitched Ethereum, an established platform with a transparent developer group and functional projects.  You have to pitch KMD and they will ask you who helms the ship.  You will say ""JL777"" and a room full of balding white dudes in their 50's and 60's are going to ask you to repeat it.  It would be outlandish.  The big money makes decisions, right or wrong, the way they have made decisions since forever.  It will be off-putting.   Some may not be bothered by it that much, some may not even care.  But many of those people aren't even going to want to hear the pitch.  Big money is very risk averse, especially if they can't even identify the person heading the show.  It is bad for PR since JL777 cant do actual interviews.  Its just a bad look.  And it doesn't have to be a bad look, which is frustrating.  Its such an easy fix.";"";"";

But, despite JL777 claiming ""everything"" is good except for price action, that isn't accurate.  Marketing is awful.  Do a youtube search for Komodo KMD, look at the top videos, their view count and their content.   It's all third party people stumbling around verbally about KMD.  Google it and you find more obscure, outdated, crap articles about it.  The marketing is awful.  The wallet is, like I said, staring at a bunch of potatoes with random labels on them.  And the only reassurances that team members or community members can give an irritated investor are smart ass comments, calling me a troll for being critical, or straw-man'ing me by claiming I said something I didn't.  So the community is rather toxic towards anyone who has critical questions and the only explanation that anyone wants to give me is, ""you just don't understand how sweet the tech is, bruh.""";"";"";
