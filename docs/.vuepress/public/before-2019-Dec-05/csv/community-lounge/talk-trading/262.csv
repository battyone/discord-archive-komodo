At point-if-sale from CEX’s certainly. If for example Jl777 buys GUSD from BarterDex using jumblered KMD, then later sells GUSD for KMD, seems like he successfully avoided his chickens from being known.  Not that he would necessarily do that, but just saying. The exchanges would have to restrict the flow of new USDC/GUSD from entering/exiting the market, which isn’t out of the question, and probably likely at some point as regulators tighten their grip.";"";"";
