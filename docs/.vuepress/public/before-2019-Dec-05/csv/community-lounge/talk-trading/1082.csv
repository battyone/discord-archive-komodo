TAGLINE: Komodo: An Open, Composable Multi-Chain Platform

MISSION STATEMENT 

Komodo is committed to accelerating global blockchain adoption through a composable multi-chain architecture, an open platform model, and a business-friendly ecosystem that allows developers, startups, and enterprise alike to prosper with customized blockchain solutions.

VISION STATEMENT
