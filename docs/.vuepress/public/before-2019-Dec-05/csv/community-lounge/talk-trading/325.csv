I have bobs configured, most combinations of all had at least a couple trades go through over the past 6 months, for many of the most common pairs and see virtually no buy requests from alices, particularly lately.  Ordermatching, for whatever reason, isn‚Äôt reliable. Most Alice buyers try and give up. A handful of times I‚Äôve seen people here say  ‚Äúwts bch‚Äù or something, I let them know it‚Äôs in bdex, then they just go fill their orders in a cex.  I agree we need to have an easier to setup marketmaker, but I don‚Äôt think that has much of anything to do with the lack of activity on bdex.";"";"";
