RV/CSW are in this boat...how to make BTC be the day to day currency...they neither one wanted the BCH fork but they were 'stabbed' in the back by Jihan/bitmain splitting BTC in the first place.  To sum this up:  1.  Jihan at Bitmain wants 1000's of alts so they can sell equipment....2.  RV wants development...3.  CSW wants the old BTC vision.    They all win with the centralization of money...as they all get richer.  I can see all perspectives...which is needed by humanity now?  I think #2 and #3 are still in the best interests of humanity...but Jihan is just another capitalist corporation imo.  With all of that said...where does that leave the alts?  In the long run they will compete with BCH(by whatever name) and evolve into the transactional  winner.  I personally think that will be KMD or ZEN (maybe ETH)...but they better get some patented stuff in the mix or the next 'new' open sourced solution di jour will vacuum up their ideas and win competitively...the ecosystem is the key differentiator.
