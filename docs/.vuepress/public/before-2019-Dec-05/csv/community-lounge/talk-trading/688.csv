This is the easiest way to claim rewards on your ledger s without a app you need to download.

I have reduced the claim fee from 5% of claimed rewards to 0.5% which is a 90% reduction for the next month or so (this will be set in a few hours). Fees collected are used for development funds to build more apps for Komodo and related coins.
