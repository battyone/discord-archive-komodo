Kids would spend their early childhood in company of other children of varying ages and got 'socialized' that way.
Children picked necesary skills at that point and strong points and weaknesses were recognized early.
Professions weren't choses: you grew into them as a result of your forte and the skills were cultivated.

Nowadays we insist every kid gets the same basic education, with little room for variation. Strong points and weaknesses are missed because the teacher has to many children to teach.
We need to drastically change the worlds educational system";"";"üëÜ (1)";
