>This is how we can implement oracles that deliver external data to the Qubic system. Any source of data can package this data as an effect and ask the Supervisor to send it to an environment. If a qubic entity has joined that environment, it will be triggered to process the effect data. Once the qubic has processed the effect data, its result data can in turn be sent as effect data to an environment, which causes the Supervisor to pass it to entities that have joined that environment for further processing. One such entity could be yet another oracle, which then can function as the data provider for further external processing.

>The processing entities aren‚Äôt necessarily only qubics, either. Effect data can be processed by an oracle by passing it on as external data outside the system. Or a processing entity could be a view that displays the effect data. You can mix and match in a very flexible way.

?5. Specific Business Models Involving CVC Transactions that May be
Exempt From the Definition of Money Transmission
5.1. CVC Trading Platforms and Decentralized Exchanges
CVC P2P trading platforms are websites that enable buyers and sellers of CVC to
find each other. Sometimes, trading platforms also facilitate trades as an intermediary. 
Under FinCEN regulations, a person is exempt from money transmitter status
if the person only provides the delivery, communication, or network access services
used by a money transmitter to support money transmission services.72 Consistent
with this exemption, if a CVC trading platform only provides a forum where buyers
and sellers of CVC post their bids and offers (with or without automatic matching of
counterparties), and the parties themselves settle any matched transactions through
an outside venue (either through individual wallets or other wallets not hosted by
the trading platform), the trading platform does not qualify as a money transmitter
under FinCEN regulations
a fully decentralized atomicDEX fits very nicely into the 5.1 exemption, it appears that we can even make a website that displays info about the state of the DEX and that is ok too""";"";"";
