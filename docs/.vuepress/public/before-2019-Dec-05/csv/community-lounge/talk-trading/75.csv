CC contracts are utxo based. As such it has the advantage that things like a dice CC can be written in a few days and it is totally blockchain enforced. the downside is that it is utxo based and a totally different way of doing contracts. Currently I have written assets/tokens with built in DEX, faucet, rewards and dice. in the last 2 weeks. they are at cli level only.

still in testing, but there are rpc calls that already work. These are native contracts and run at full speed. I think ultimately there will be a large overlap in the types of contracts that can be done via CC and by other methods, but probably some would only be able to be done via CC and there might be some that CC cant do (though I have not run into any such yet)";"";"üëå (2)";
