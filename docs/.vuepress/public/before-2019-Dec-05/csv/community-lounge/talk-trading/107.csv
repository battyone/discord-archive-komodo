learned Foxpro, visual foxpro, visual basic, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Computer Fundamentals.
That was almost of 6+ months of course.
It was also the hardest exams to pass for even top scorers. I did well until I didn't well till I came to C/C++.
Left this course incomplete, and continued with my degree.
then got carried away with Linux OS and that lead me to system administration.
but as hobbyist been deving, animating and designing along side sys admin job.
later got full time job as web developer and increased on that skill more. I never got that joy doing sys admin stuff that I got from doing programming.";"";"";

when it comes to work, I always give the advice of first find out what gives you the most pleasure doing something.
put your mind to that and learn everything possible about that and just focus on that.
either part time, or volunteer or however. that something will always lead you to where you want in financial terms, disregard of what you started with it at first.
