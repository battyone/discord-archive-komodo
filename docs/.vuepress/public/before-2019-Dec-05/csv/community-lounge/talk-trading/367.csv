I'm expecting btc to break down a bit from here, and eth to break down a bit more.... basically a correction in ethbtc and altbtc pairs that are strongly correlated to bitcoin. KMD however is a strange beast, and looking at KMDETH we are at support and seem to be holding. 

Seems somewhat probable that ETH may drop and KMD holds this zone and begins another triangle/sideways correction of sorts... I'm definitely not counting out a slow bleed either, BTC is basically doing that atm... for btc - too many longs open, we need a decent shake down before upside IMO, all their stops are so obvious too, should be a good volume down spike incoming IMO.

So I really don't understand the conflict. Unless there is more underneath the surface. Meybe I'm just naive. But I just think we should promote invester not puch them away. But I see want you want to say about the license. And I really don't know this would it be better if it was gpl?";"";"";
