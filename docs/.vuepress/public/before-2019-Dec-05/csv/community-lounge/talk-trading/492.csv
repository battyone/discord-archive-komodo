the reality is that the market for dPoW is the first few pages of CMC. dPoW primary purpose is to secure the KMD ecosystem. If that is all it does, it is fine. The twitterati are not the customers
Adding more coins is a service we provide, basically at our cost to other projects, so if they want to take advantage of it, then we are happy to help. if not, it is ok too.
We have by far the most efficient notarization service immune to nicehash notarizations as only elected notaries can make a proposed notarization as a group. Cost per notarization is 1 KMD txfee every 10 blocks vs. N BTC txfee every block. Maybe I am wrong about the N BTC txfee per block per chain, but based on the number of VBK BTC tx during testnet (for one coin?), it could certainly be the correct math
so dozens of BTC txfee per block paid for by share of coins mining reward... the economics dont seem to be too good for these chains`";"";"";

if VBK will saturate the BTC blockchain with all the notarizations for coins that cant afford to pay a few thousand a year, then it will take a load off of us to secure just the larger chains. So these smaller chains will end up paying 10x more in their own coin that for dPoW and to miners... who tend to sell, which would cause downward pressure, maybe not so much if it is only 1% of blockreward, but what if it ends up at 10%+ of blockreward
Anyway, if VBK does really well, that puts a rough valuation on the dPoW aspect of komodo, even if it is assumed they are of equivalent value. so this will be interesting to see`";"";"";
