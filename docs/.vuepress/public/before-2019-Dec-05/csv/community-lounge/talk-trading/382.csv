Lack of adoption isn't because it's ""hard"" or much of anything needs to be ""learned""
Lack of adoption is because:
\* We, in the community, portray it as ""hard to learn"" even when it's not (like I said, it's harder to make a call on an iPhone than it is to make a tx)
\* Even still, BTC is ""god"" and all ""average people"" know of it is ""dark web"", ""criminals"", and ""Silk Road"" (usually in that order)
