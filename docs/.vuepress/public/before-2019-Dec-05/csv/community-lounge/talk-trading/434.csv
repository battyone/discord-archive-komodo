I am so grateful we reunited just days ago and in such a fabulous discord channel.  Please don't mind my awful half-brother who constantly gives you grief.  He only got his mama's genes.  I am fully focused on crypto right now and, frankly, frightened of traditional markets which I dont have much confidence in at the moment.  I think the FED may punt here and there, but eventually they will raise rates enough to where the bottom will threaten to drop out and there will be a big dip.   Then we will see more QE or perhaps they will re-brand their scheme--either way, market paaaaamps.  Anyhow, too many manipulative variables for me to be comfortable playing right now.   Its a game I am reluctant to swing trade until I see the writing on the wall.  I have my long positions in equities and bonds.  I am young enough to ride out a significant storm.";"";"💯 (1)";
