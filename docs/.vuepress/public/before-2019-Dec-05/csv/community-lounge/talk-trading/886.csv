OK, I got it guys. Screw D1 for now, daemonising its code is basically impoossible. 
This is my proposal for the first fungible LABS chain. 
-- LottoCC!
--- Someone (anyone) crates a lotto game that expires at some X block height. 
---- Anyone can register to this game only once with some amount of LABS coin. 
---- The total amount received to this ""game"" is the payout to the winner 
---> The winner is decideded by the first notarized MoMoM hash.,  after the blockheight specified at game creation

this means that no miner can take over the chain and spoof the block hash, because it takes MoM hashes from multiple chains then hashes them to find the winner.1```";"";"";
