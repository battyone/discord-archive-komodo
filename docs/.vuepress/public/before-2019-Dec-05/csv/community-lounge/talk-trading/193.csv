In software engineering (or any engineering/science) things are constantly improved and evolved. If we never had such thing as evolving tech, we wouldn't have the computers at all and internet to have this chat communication to talk on. 😅 
I expect dPoW tech to evolve constantly by every year as new Notary Node Operators keeps added to the 64 Notary Nodes team elected by community.
These are the people who will help majorly evolve this very important part of the Komodo Platform ecosystem.
It'll be even more efficient, much more secure and better managed that how it is done today.
If Bitcoin took a decade to reach where it is here today, we are ONLY in 2+ years of Komodo Platform's dPoW evolution!
The second wave of Notary Nodes is multiple X times improved operators than the 1st year.
It's the best architecture design I have witnessed in my career which brings the technology, free open source software and developers, technology enthusiasts together to build and work together at such beautiful and efficient way.";"";"💯 (5),👍🏼 (3)";

It appears obvious to me at least that in order for KMD to really make a splash, we need a very basic interface that provides atomic swaps in real time and drop the utxo that quite frankly confuses the hell outa me.
