Some unknown members joined the discord and started a coin for a dex that was possibly coming soon(yet to use a working product) that has a massive founders reward %. Along with that they refused to release any information on the team that was running it. It came off very scamish, and still does. Although i enjoy bitcoin bennys videos, i dont know if i can support rfox either. Theyre launching a coin, effectively having investors invest in their business, which by the look of their whitepaper, theyre valuing their business at a max of $5.6 (edit: million) dollars. This is a ludicrous amount of money. Not only that, theyre taking 20% of the initial funds for Team and Advisors, in addition to 25% for the rfox enterprise solutions; effectively giving themselves 45% of the TOTAL coin supply.
