I expect a breakout above these levels (should it come) to be quite explosive. That should ""raise awareness"" ;)

Downside is the chart would end up looking like ETH chart, which would be very exciting and great for anyone involved now, but also unsustainable. But that's crypto for the time being, BTCUSD has taken a long time to behave like a reasonable market, but it still moves XX% in a day at times.";"";"üòù (1)";

Corrective has been reasonable so far, anything from this point is worth thinking seriously about for the long term, rewards are lower risk than they ever were (pre 2017). Rewards may not be as high, but risk is less IMO. Something like KMD has a higher reward profile, as I mentioned previously, it should have more ""room to grow"" relative to other cryptos.
