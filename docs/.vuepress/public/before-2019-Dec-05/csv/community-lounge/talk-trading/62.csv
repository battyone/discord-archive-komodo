I have alpha and beta tested software, and the BarterDex Beer swap brought back memories.  Not good ones.  Concurrently the price was plummeting which made mining incredibly unprofitable relative to other options.  All the while I saw a complete lack of marketing with only promises to fix it (for months), I saw KMD announcements about hiring people who only had first names (read: no verifiable identity) and didn't have public resumes, the Agama wallet continued to be a cumbersome tribute to what I might call an art style of GUI Brutalism.  So I researched a lot, bought some, mined some, talked it up to friends when I was intrigued by it.  Perhaps that is not enough in your opinion.  Shrug.  Maybe you think that investing/speculating/mining to secure the network might not be enough, and if so, I didn't do enough, comrade.";"";"";

No one seems to argue against the assertion that KMD has a huge marketing deficiency.  I noted earlier, if you Google KMD or YouTube it, the results are mostly poor quality ramblings by people who cant adequately explain the tech.   And even when I voice concerns here, I just have long-timers telling me I just don't understand the tech like they do, but they are unable or unwilling to actually explain it.  So Google searches don't do KMD justice, YouTube searches result in a bunch of speculative people that can't explain the inherent value it it, and here on Discord critical voices are shouted down as being trolls or whatever.

I am not looking for a hobby.   I don't want to contribute my time or capital to BTC, ETH, LTC, XLM, KMD or any of the other projects/coins I own.  I am not a boy scout, I am an investor.  KMD has disappointed me with their lack of marketing, transparency, ability launch projects, the half baked nature of the Beer swap.  Its just my opinion.  I still root for KMD because I own it, but I am a disappointed investor who wants to be heard and instead of saying, ""I hear your concerns and they are valid,"" most of the KMD people in this thread want to call me a troll or whatever.  This is an echo chamber in here.";"";"";
