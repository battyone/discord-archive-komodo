If bit-yuan are activated, tax evasion, counterfeiting and money laundering will become impossible. It is also feared to have side effects. the chinese government could impose economic disadvantages on minority supporters, those who have antipathy to the communist party and those who support democracy. It is much easier to trace if you use bit-yuan than when you use the yuan.

what will happen to bitcoin's fate? As the U.S.-China war will affect the blockchain ecosystem, bitcoin's neutrality will shine even more. neither the U.S. nor the chinese government can fully control bitcoin. whether the fed issues a ""Fed coin"" or the people's bank of china issues a bit-yuan, facebook issues a libra or whatever, it won't weaken the power of the bitcoin network.

the reason is that bitcoin is a network based on trust distributed without specific control actors. like the relationship between modern nominal currency and gold, bitcoin, called digital gold, should be considered as a key currency for various digital currencies.

It's a miscalculation to think that Libra threatens U.S. dollar hegemony. 
strengthen. by far the dollar will take the lion's share of libra's basket of legal currency. If libra is actively used, the U.S. can take control of the global digital currency ecosystem. the U.S., which controls the real world economy with dollars, will even try to dominate the digital world economy by controlling digital currency issued by Libra or its companies.";"";"";

In fact, the Central Bank of China has officially announced that it will issue a Central Bank Digital Currency. 

In my view, China is likely to issue a ""bit-yuan"" (tentative name) to lead the establishment of an international standard for digital currency much faster than other countries. while Libra is a digital currency issued by a private U.S. company, bit-yuan is issued by the Central Bank of China, which inevitably has a much stronger ripple effect.";"";"";
