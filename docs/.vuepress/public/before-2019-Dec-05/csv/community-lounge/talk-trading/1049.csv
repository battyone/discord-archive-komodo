Marketing has nothing to do with this, unless you think marketing = fomo.

Effective marketing where it leads to user adoption and devs building on KMD is what we need. The marketing team is doing this and the fruits of this will play out over time.

There is no flashy $2m paid partnerships unless the community is willing to fund it. With 32BTC in KMD, it is in your best interest to help KMD get out there. This is where community marketing comes into play https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4b7b/3bd9826fa6da81d8a7a3aa3ede3010dc7b45.pdf

"459844460625526824";"hyperDEX#6586";"08-Aug-19 08:15 AM";"The question everyone should ask themselves, if i believe that the price will keep going down, should i sell? If the answer is you dont want to sell then the next question is, how can i help get user adoption which will result in more people buying/knowing about KMD.

Saying you have no time, is saying that you dont care if your investment goes down, which is fine, it is your money. If you are saying i should get paid to do something, the answer is you dont care if your investment goes down. If you are saying some magical unicorn will appear and they will make the price magically go up, you are saying you dont care if the price goes down.

So at the end of the day if you do want your investment to go up, take some action to make sure that it does. Go out and do dex testing, go on social and let people know about KMD, create a meeting for like minded people to think up of ideas on how we can market better.";"";"💯 (2)";
