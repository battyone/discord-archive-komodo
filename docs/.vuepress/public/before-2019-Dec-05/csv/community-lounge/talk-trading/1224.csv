The theory is BSV is a red herring,  and TPTB intend to use the pre segwit Bitcoin that remains after this attack as the basis for a new global monetary system.  As jl777 said, the safe thing to do is store your Bitcoin in legacy addresses that start with a 1.

The theory is because CSW intends to dump millions of Bitcoin he needs to give advanced warning to the market to comply with securities regulations. My thinking is segwit is an abomination anyway, so using legacy addresses is sensible no matter what, and while I doubt CSW is Satoshi,  he might have been involved with the Satoshi group, and might be the last one alive, and might actually get access to the tulip trust coins on Jan 1 2020.
