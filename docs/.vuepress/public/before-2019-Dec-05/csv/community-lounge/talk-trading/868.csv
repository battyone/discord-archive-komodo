Internet content is free. but consumers have to be exposed to numerous ads. 

the reason why this has happened is because the Internet did not support micro-payment technology. true small payments should be made at 10cent to 20cent, free of three things: cumbersome procedures such as membership registration, personal exposure to financial information, and transaction fees. 

no matter how much online shopping grew, payments were forced to go through the financial network because the Internet did not have the technology to support payment services on its own.

bitcoin showed the possibility of micro-payment without going through financial network. the emergence of corporate-guaranteed cryptocurrency such as Libra will also facilitate micro-payments. 

micropayments change the structure of the Internet. If an article, a webcomic and a video can be paid in small amounts, a portal-like hub that can attract advertisers to one place will no longer be needed. 

In other words, the possibility of small payments could bring down global IT dinosaurs such as Facebook, whose advertisements are a major source of income. In other words, Facebook has taken a step closer to self-destructive territory.

Facebook's logic to persuade the government and intellectuals at the hearing is also likely to be related. this means that the situation is so desperate. 

from the moment bitcoin came into the world, the rules of the game began to change. It's just a matter of adjusting to the new rules and surviving.

zuckerberg will persuade the government to allow Libra, saying it cannot stop blockchains like BTC and ETH.";"";"";
