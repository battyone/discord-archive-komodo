Look at it like this.
We are still two to three years from Mildly mass adoption.
The tech, brains the right people here. But it is still a gamble to think kmd will be here after the dust have settle. There is a good chance kmd and some few others still be here. Delivering amazing tech as always. My biggest concern is the crypto space especially kmd because of the Decentral nature of it is going to be regulated to death. Yes there is a market for it and ppl will use it but like kazar Napster lime wire and tpb was mega huge back in the 00 but now not so much now. What do you guys think? Will komodo be just another tpb?";"";"";
