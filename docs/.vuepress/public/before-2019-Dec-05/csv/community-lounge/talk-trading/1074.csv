Even though more money being printed to correct growth rates should raise the ‚Äúprice‚Äù , crypto‚Äôs utility as a store of value diminishes due to other needs having a higher marginal utility.  An example : a recession hits and the company you work for goes under and it‚Äôs hard to find work due to increased competition.   Would the normal person have an issue of liquidating their crypto for life needs ( still have to eat pay rent etc. ) .  I believe they wouldn‚Äôt . On a larger scale, if credit access is restricted companies may tighten their belts in regard to how much they are willing to exchange for ( crypto will cost more to get and get less if sold ) .   Alts have it worse as it will spark a bank run to bitcoin and other fiat liquid alts.";"";"";
