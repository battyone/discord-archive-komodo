So, not financial advice, and I am not a professional, but you might consider buying a bit now but keeping plenty of fiat on the sidelines.  If it dips again, you can buy more and if come January ETF's are launched and it looks like we are transitioning to a bull market, you will still be able to buy sub $1 KMD on the way back up.";"";"";
