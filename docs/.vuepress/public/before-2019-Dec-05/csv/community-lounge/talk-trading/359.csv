you'd think we'd learn so many lessons about being grateful and expectations and so on from the market, but as soon as it gives us something to be grateful about, we want more. Then if we don't get to have the all time high price as ours, such as when we were sitting there with all our assets and they were ""worth"" the all time high, almost like we actually owned that amount of value for sure, we feel resentful... After that, all price relative to all time high is not good enough... such madness

it's like this stock market bubble, all these passive indexers who are up 100% or whatever, then they lose 15% in value in latest sell off and that's all they can think about, not the fact that they are up 85%";"";"";

In terms of correction it's just not had enough time yet, and ranging with bulls and bears taking positions either side makes more sense. I still have in mind medium term ranging, upwards first, then down to make the lows more solid long term. 

KMD then, let's hope we keep chopping upwards 😉 ""raising that awareness"" with the top 5 gainers each day. Otherwise just expecting more sideways/upwards consolidation before a real good run in the coming weeks once we really get out the zone and the major accumulation is done.";"";"";

I figured that when he THINKS that time is near then he will not remove his bid and let the sellers dump into it. If he doesn't get his fill then eventually he'll just buy up the rest at the ask. When Bitcoin dropped a little bit ago kmd did the same, only the whale didn't budge. In fact it looks like he is now trying to get people to sell into his bid. I take this as good news.

I'm expecting a bit of sideways ranging for now, KMD though, looks pretty good, each level is stronger support and less retrace for the time being. That said, volume has been dying off as we go, which can be the sign of a reversal. But the greater volume further down is good evidence of accumulation and support. I expect volume to pick up again once we start breaking levels and crypto as a whole makes another bull move.
