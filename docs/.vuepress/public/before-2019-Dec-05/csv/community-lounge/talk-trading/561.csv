Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange protocol to unlock data for AI. Through blockchain technology, Ocean Protocol connects data providers and consumers, allowing data to be shared while guaranteeing traceability, transparency, and trust for all stakeholders involved. It allows data owners to give value to and have control over their data without being locked-in to any single marketplace. Ocean Protocol is committed to kick-starting a new Data Economy by bringing together decentralized blockchain technology, a data sharing framework, and an ecosystem for data and related services. Learn more: https://oceanprotocol.com/ 
 
“We are excited to be partnering with the OCEAN protocol to help them raise important funds to advance their blockchain technology and mission to make data shareable and consumable in a safe, secure, and transparent manner,” said Bill Shihara of Bittrex International. “Our mission is to incubate innovation and the IEO process is an outstanding and efficient way to accomplish that goal. We look forward to this offering with OCEAN and to helping similarly innovative teams raise the funds they need in the future as we do our part to move the blockchain revolution onward.”
