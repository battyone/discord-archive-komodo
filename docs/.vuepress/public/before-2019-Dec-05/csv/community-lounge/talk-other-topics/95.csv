A U.S. court has issued a final notice to Craig Wright, who claims to be Satoshi, to come up with a list of early mining bitcoin. Otherwise, contempt of court may be applied.

Craig claims to be Satoshi, but he doesn't have a key with a million bitcoin right now because it's in a common purse designed by Dave Kleiman, who helped with security-related work during Bitcoin operations.

Kleiman died in 2013 and his brother sued Craig to give his brother's share. Kleiman left a USB when he died, and his brother kept it. The USB may contain the secret of the security wallet, but Kleiman's past partners testify that it would be difficult to solve even if it were.

If Craig is really Satoshi, he was been made a good use by Kleiman.

Kleiman's brother, his lawyer, and Craig share the premise that Craig is Satoshi and that Kleiman assisted in his work. Craig is almost the only one who is being sued by people who are convinced of his existence.

It is not until January of next year that the wallet of the security key is handed over to him, and that is what Craig believes and may have to ask the dead Kleiman.

If Craig is a fake Satoshi, the lawsuit itself should be the play of the gang. To prove that Craig is Satoshi. If Craig is Satoshi, he can win an inexhaustible copyright suit on blockchain-related core technologies and share profits later. If so, he is in a position to go to jail by a U.S. court for pushing the play too hard.";"";"";

I shared it because maybe it could be useful to Komodo as there is some work being done on stable coins. Everybody is talking about Libra, but this new project is backed by some huge players including Peter Thiel and Coinbase Ventures and their aim is to replace FIAT with a better alternative.. They have two coins, one is the stable coin that will come out, and one is the one that fluctuates (called $RSR - Reserve rights) and helps the stablecoin keep stability. It's a shame they launched on Ethereum and not Komodo... Towards the end of the talk they do mention privacy and maybe using ZK-Snarks (but as a choice, with also transparent addresses, like ZCash). The interesting concept in this talk is that the stablecoin can be pegged to other blockchains. I think they have a great logo by the way - for what they are planning to offer.
