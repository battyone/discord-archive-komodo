2) Central mixing service? Who has confidence in it? Money can be stolen. If this service also logs, you are deanonymised. 
Both are striking: You now know that the previous owner has about the same amount of coins from mixing. 
3) Coinjoin: Thanks to different outputs it is very difficult to trace which coin comes from where. 
But if you take a closer look, you will notice that the same sum corresponds to the input.

Wasabi solution: 
1) Blind ""Schnorr signature"".  (Signing procedure for the exit of the Anonymized Coins so that nobody knows its destination address) 
2) Before any activity occurs on the network, everything is encrypted using Tor.
