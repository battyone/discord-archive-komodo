It may seem desirable, but it is a very unlikely concept to be realized. communism, which dreamed of equality for all, and democracy, which was aimed at national sovereignty, have both failed or degenerated. blockchain is said to bring out the moldy concept of decentralization to ensure censorship resistance, transparent society and privacy. however, the decentralized philosophy of blockchain has been undermined, and the once idealists are turning into extremely realistic merchants who roll the abacus. all these predictions are based on human history.

privacy. It's a very important concept. however, people are not as sophisticated as they thought they would be in protecting their privacy. this is because the convenience of services in return for privacy is too great. In china, which is becoming an advanced country in digital finance, citizens are giving up privacy and receiving high-quality financial services. If such a step is made, it is predicted that a submissive newcomer who will leave privacy to the nation and post it on Instagram after receiving the first grade in social credit rating will appear.";"";"";
