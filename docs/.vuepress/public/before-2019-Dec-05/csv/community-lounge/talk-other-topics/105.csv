I also asked a friend and this is what he said :
""I don't trust the dVPN that asked for a listing. They have a weak white paper that is short on technicals, and very little explanations about how exit nodes (the people selling their bandiwdth for coins) would protect themselves against illegal activities by end users""
So I decided to don't list it on the directory";"";"";
