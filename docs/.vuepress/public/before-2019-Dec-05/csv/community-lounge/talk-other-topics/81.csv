But as seen in the case of the United States, if the state confiscated gold, the individual's assets were forced to be helplessly exposed to the country's tyranny. What's encouraging is that the alternative to gold has emerged since 2009. A neutral one that is as scarce as gold and does not belong to a particular subject. However, compared to gold, it is not easy for the state to confiscate unilaterally, it is easier to convey values across borders, and it enhances an individual's economic independence. This is the right definition of bitcoin, called digital gold.";"";"";

An error made by the World Gold Association is that it overlooked the fact that Bitcoin has only been in the world for 10 years. Comparing bitcoin to gold at the same time is like comparing the physical abilities of a newborn and a healthy adult. Now, the problem with bitcoin is that most of the time, gold has suffered the same in the past, which can be overcome enough over time. Of course, it is hard to say that bitcoin completely replaces gold in a short period of time. However, if bitcoin slowly builds trust as digital gold, the role of gold, which is used for financial purposes, is gradually transferred to bitcoin.

Given that Bitcoin is slowly evolving into digital gold, it is necessary to seriously think about the possibility of Bitcoin taking over the role it played in the gold standard.";"";"üëå (1)";
