Hal finney is an early bitcoiner.
On November 9, just a week after Satoshi's white paper, he asked a few questions about the concept of bitcoin, and when Satoshi answered, he became a bitcoinner.

He is from Caltech, and he believes that personal freedom through the Internet is in encryption technology, and he has made achievements in it.
Hal finney got a quick understanding of Bitcoin.

He asked Satoshi Nakamoto about the chain fork problem and so on. realized that Bitcoin's system is the solution he's been looking for all his life.

But he says he wants to see some official or concrete work because the white paper is not enough.
Then Satoshi said, ""conversation with him was good, In persuading himself, he said, ""I've already considered writing the white paper before I started writing it,"" and he said, ""I want to show you the source code in the near future.""

As a response to a genius with respect for a craftsman who's been on the same path his whole life,
It's a touching conversation.

(The question wasn't new, but thank you for asking the most necessary questions at this stage.)

Anyway, saw the New York Times down there,
In 2009, Hal finney discovered the outbreak of Lou Gehrig's
he paid for the treatment by selling the initial Bitcoin.
life of a craftsman who had to leave as soon as he met the solution he'd been looking for all his life.

If Hal finney was really Satoshi, we would have to pay tribute to a genius' humble retreat.";"";"💯 (1)";

In particular, the media has disturbed the 'brain of the group' by mention the words bubble, tulip, drugs, and ransomware.
you can't understand this ""serious phenomenon"" unless you wake up and study on your own because the brain of the group is in a sleep of idleness.

On July 24, 2017, Bitcoin's chapter 1 ended and a new chapter began.

CFTC has licensed bitcoin-based derivatives such as futures options. people in the so-called banks of banks around the world have begun to look at Bitcoin as part of their asset list.

'Chapter 1' was perhaps an easy game.

It was a time when patience alone could pay off if one understood that Bitcoin was strong. 
but as the wall-street progresses, the previously unconcerned but belatedly realized financial 'first-class players' come to the plate with resourcefulness and abundant funds. 
If you invest recklessly, you may encounter a disaster.
