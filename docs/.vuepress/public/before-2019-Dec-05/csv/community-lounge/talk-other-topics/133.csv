In addition, during the grin testnet, they relaunched chain from 0 several times. I think that it is possible that Grin is not the final coin, they can launch anogher one. So this kind of pb is tiny. Other privacy features should be released next year";"";"";

"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"21-Nov-19 07:16 AM";"another technically overwhelming blockchain system is unlikely to have a strong impact on bitcoin. 

this is because the technology used for bitcoin is crude. you may think it's rational to push out a crude technology by more sophisticated technology, but because it's crude, it's possible to boast sophisticated techniques. 

bitcoin is not optimized for any particular use. It's the result of choices that give up much of it to reinforce its predictive nature. the fact that coin's creator does not appear in the media also helps to increase predictability, but above all, the neutrality that bitcoin is not influenced by big companies or strong nations is the identity of bitcoin.

acknowledging the fact that bitcoin is or is close to money, this logic that puts the phenomenon ahead is more powerful than you think. the core of money is trust, which is empirical. the undeniable phenomenon that bitcoin is the oldest, the most expensive and the most robust system, and the public's trust in bitcoin is inseparable, and this is a competitive advantage that cannot be reversed until a strong shock comes.

the overwhelming proportion of bitcoin in terms of total value and the fact that strong governments haven't said it's going to ban bitcoin is a 'phenomena' that strongly supports the prediction that bitcoin's crude will be the bedrock of sophisticated technologies.";"";"";
