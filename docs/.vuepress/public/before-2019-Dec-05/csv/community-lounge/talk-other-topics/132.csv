It means that the amount will grow from $81.4 million in 2017 to $3.485 billion in 2023.

Major players who are playing for this goal cited IBM and Microsoft in the U.S., Abra in SAP, Deloitte in the U.K. and BitFury Group in the Netherlands. The report predicted that even after the blockchain changes the rules of the global supply chain, some countries in North America and Europe will take the dominant position in the supply chain. The prediction is in line with some experts' claims that Bitcoin and Blockchain will further solidify the U.S. dominant position.";"";"";

Those who understand blockchain as a technology-based source of evidence claim that China is leading in this area. However, in terms of interpreting the meaning of blockchain and cryptocurrency in terms of global supply chain changes, China's approach is useless to change the game. most government is also struggling to understand the current supply chain. It will take more time for the idea to be able to take full advantage of the blockchain to change people's position in the global supply chain.

Order is the domain of the public It may be more than an empirical rule that those who have put resources into the public domain can seize opportunities in creating a new order. most society as a whole has a low understanding of the nature of the order currently in place, the rules revealed or hidden in the game. This may be the biggest barrier to understanding the meaning of the rule-changer Bitcoin or blockchain.";"";"";
