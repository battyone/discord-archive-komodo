But, there is still an on-chain txn when the channel closes, which will look like a similar BTC txn. So even if the investigator wasn't running a lightning node, they would be able to track the ""tainted"" BTC to every satoshi. But how they will treat people that received this BTC through lightning is upto them.   @Acura";"";"👍🏻 (1)";

Open blockchain should be considered as a protocol, like TCP/IP. If the security model of the system is not competitive in nature, it won’t be sustainable and scalable in practice, and it will be deemed as securities.
These companies that claim to be building the next generation blockchain have no genuine direction. The only direction they have is to creat a less replicated machines to show off their meaningless TPS.
Forcing/convincing others to build apps on their blockchain platform won’t do much. Employees will soon or maybe already have self-doubts and many unanswered questions.";"";"";

The first bitcoin tested their intellectual ability. they would have considered whether they could legally block bitcoin. If it is true that the government can not prohibit bitcoin on their behalf, it is necessary to study and judge by learning the unfamiliar technical concepts.

There are not so many executives of financial firms who have passed these intellectual tests. But even if it were a minority, it was clear that some of them had a reasonable conclusion. It is concluded that the new technology can fundamentally change the financial sector and can not prohibit pressure on the government by using the influence of banks.

After waiting for the bankers who passed this test, the test would have been a moral issue. This is similar to when a place like a theater where many people gathered was lit up. When smoke starts to appear and smells, the crowd asks for answers in confusion.

Honest information is rather dangerous at this time. More confusion can hurt more people than fire. Someone in a position to know the situation can only reassure people once they lie. It is wise to keep order.";"";"";

however, ordinary leaders will prioritize valuable resources to ensure the safety of themselves and those close to them.

Goldman Sachs made a study report on bitcoin early on. In 2014, Goldman Sachs separated the concept of bitcoin, bitcoin's underlying technology, and so-called blockchain, through a report. their conclusion was, 'bitcoin are not, but blockchains are promising.' 

One can see that the proposition of ""bitcoin is fake, but blockchain is real"" is absurd even with a little coolness. bitcoin introduced the technology of blockchain to the world. the technology is so powerful that it has proved unstoppable, including the government. technology is real, but it is hard to accept the proposition that the first invention that proves it to be real is fake.";"";"";

If Bitcoin is real, we should do something about it ourselves, but if it is a problem with blockchain, it is something that majors, experts, the government and banks can take care of. In other words, the proposition appealed to the sluggish public who wanted to watch the movie, hoping it wasn't a fire in the midst of the burning smell.

What is it that bankers have gained by publicly denouncing bitcoin that Bitcoin is a destructive innovation that rocks the existing order?
They've earned time.

when is a more appropriate question than why large financial companies want to use blockchain to make their own currency. 
American banks originally had the authority to issue money. The authority was taken over by the federal government. Money is a broader concept than we thought, and Americans have a tradition of enjoying the autonomy of issuing money. Even if Bitcoin is a threat to large financial companies, the culture has a low level of consciousness that blocks the idea that using blockchain may bring back the right to issue banknotes from the government. 

In the context of Bitcoin's 10-year history, JPMCoin News is an episode that shows one side of the intelligence and morality of U.S. financial business executives. Nevertheless, if you want to reduce this incident to a piecemeal act, you need to look back to see whether you are too trusting or not at all. Human history is full of examples proving that it is hard to completely distrust Elite, but it is not a good end to complete trust.";"";"";
