It's very important to make blockchain economics sustainable. To that end we'll make sure that leasing your Waves will yield around 5-10% yearly interest. This release is going to happen around September. It will entail an increase in tx fees (but not drastic, simple transactions such as token transfer will cost about the same), and of course new Ride will provide for increased tx volume. There are a couple other things to be used that we dicsuss now, it's a little to early to reveal them.";"";"";

In my opinion, as the digital currency war rages, the neutrality of bitcoin is likely to shine. that's because no government has complete control over bitcoin, a money based on distributed trust. like gold. consider the relationship between the legal currency and gold at the time of the gold standard. bitcoin principal system, where bitcoin, called digital gold, becomes the key currency of various digital currencies, is another possible scenario.

In conclusion, the currency war is expanding into the digital world. countries are fighting each other to win the digital currency war. It is ironic that bitcoin, which emerged as an alternative currency for centralized financial power, has rather ignited the empire's digital currency war.";"";"";
"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"24-Jul-19 03:36 PM";"Facebook's optimism that the government would prefer the widespread circulation of Libra, which can be stopped at any time at the command of the U.S. government, rather than the rampant circulation of anarchic bitcoin was overlooking one fatal factor. 

It is the ambition of the banks. It was the banks that took note of Bitcoin's power earlier. Of course, banks tried to keep Bitcoin from growing by trying to distinguish between Bitcoin and Blockchain. But if Facebook is actually trying to issue deposit-based digital currency, banks will try to block it by moving the government and take the initiative. Juche, which held the Libra hearing this time, is also a banking committee of the Senate, and Trump's tweet seems to represent the banking industry.

But the cross-border digital currency itself is closer to a dream that is irreconcilable with the current monetary system. Saying that it will operate Libra while keeping regulations from governments cannot satisfy those governments that think the existence of Libra itself is a violation of regulations. In the end, we need a medium called Digital Gold that allows us to freely cross the border while keeping the national currencies alive. If something like gold, which is virtually a value, exists in a digital form without the need for a guarantee of exchange, banks in each country can run new financial businesses in the digital environment, mediating the exchange of their own currency and this digital gold. The price volatility of digital gold is no longer a flaw. Rather, the more volatile prices change, the better it is to curb ordinary people's access and at the same time to spread stablecoins.";"";"";
