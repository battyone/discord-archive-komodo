`i can answer that somewhat.  KMD implemented dPoW which is similar in concept to VBK's PoP mining except that the difference is the function of submitting merkle roots to bitcoin's chain is distributed and decentralized in VBK's infrastructure to PoP miners (anyone can start PoP mining).  For KMD, they elect 64 ""notary"" nodes annually in February, that perform a similar function to a PoP miner by grabbing KMD's merkle root at 10 minute intervals and submitting it to bitcoin's chain.  The part which makes it kind of centralized is that KMD rewards their notary nodes for performing that function by allowing notary nodes to mine PoW blocks on an easy difficulty, such that 75% of the blocks are mined and rewarded to a notary node whereas only 25% go to GPU miners.  The problem with this, is that their election for each years notary nodes is dependent upon which candidates get the most amount of vote tokens.  Their vote tokens are handed out at a 1:1 ratio to the holders of KMD.  So you get the existing notary nodes getting the majority of the block rewards (KMD coin) and they also end up with the majority of the vote tokens every year.  So obviously they will keep voting themselves in.

From an altchain perspective, KMD also has a yearly fee that they charge to each altchain for performing this ""notary"" service.  Essentially that notary service is the same as what PoP miners are already doing.`";"";"";
