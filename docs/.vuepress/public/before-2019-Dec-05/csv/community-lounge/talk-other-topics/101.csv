Libra Reserve's currency basket consists of dollars, euros, yen and pounds (yuan is out!) It is obvious that the dollar will take up a major part. Libra's success means that the dollar will soon play the role of a key currency within the digital currency ecosystem. In other words, both Facebook and Fed can win.

Stimulated by the Libra, China is stepping up its CBDC development. From China's point of view, Libra has no choice because Libra has ""yuan passing."" China will be the first and most successful country in the world to distribute CBDC. Of course, the U.S. has no intention of giving up the hegemony of the digital currency ecosystem to China. Facebook is cleverly appealing this point.

More than 70 percent of the 28 companies participating in the Libra Association are U.S. companies. Even if the number of Libra association companies increases to 100, there is a high chance that the U.S. company will take up more than a majority. Chinese companies will either be excluded at all or have very limited roles. The U.S. government can monitor and control Libra whenever it wants.

The variable is Wall Street. There are no Wall Street banks in the Libra Association yet. Wall Street is wary of Silicon Valley encroaching on its territory, and if it doesn't get to the banks of Wall Street, which have a lot of lobbying power, approval of the Libra may be longer than expected.";"";"";

With a lot admiration for your work and open-source values in the Komodo community, I wanted to share a project that might interest you:  

https://timetosolve.com

It's an effort to build urgent climate solutions, designed as **open-source tools** that communities can adopt/configure to best serve their needs.

I'm currently looking for collaborators and early members of the project/community, and I feel many of you have experience + values that are an awesome fit for the work to be done.

If you're interested in getting involved, just send a reply/DM, and share a brief intro about what you enjoy working on and how you'd like to contribute  

Likewise, if you simply want to share ideas/feedback and discuss climate innovations, it would be great to have your voice in the mix";"";"";
