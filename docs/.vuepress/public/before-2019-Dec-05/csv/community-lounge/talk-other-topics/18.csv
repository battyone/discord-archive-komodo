The good news is it forced me to 'construct' a much better way to make a living rather than accept working in horrible toxic environments. I now have the perfect job for me, it took a while to 'Make' it, but it was worth the effort. Most people stay in less than ideal circumstances because they can tolerate dissatisfaction much better than me, but the long term effects can be negative on your well being, you can easily become cynical, bitter, jealous, mean spirited. Consider your current feelings as a source of motivation power that can get you from A to B, good luck!";"";"";
