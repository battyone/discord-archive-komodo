If If mob rule takes over here we will have the urban centers calling all the shots for the rural areas. There will likely be a yellow vest style uprising. Only well armed, cause ‘murica. One state already passed a law to recognize the winner of the popular vote and ignore the electoral college.  If that ends up giving dems the win then mob rule it will be.";"";"";

The big question is, if we are successful in decentralizing voting and government, would people act in their best interest? Or could they be persuaded or fooled into voting against their own well being? Do we need a sort of “digital constitution smart contract” to provide checks and balances? This shit kind of boggles my mind. We can already see, feel, and breathe the ramifications of our infinite resource economic models. The real wizardry will be in creating a system that benefits everyone and our environment at the same time.";"";"";

https://www.kleanloop.io

A much better idea is to use waste plastic and or other waste to create electricity to power block chain mining. 

Here are two for use at home technologies that destroy plastic and create fuel. 

https://wastebot.com

http://www.blest.co.jp/eng/service/be-h/

Wastebot ~$12500 creates a synthgas that can be run in a generator to create electricity or further refined into diesel for diesel generator.

The Blest machine ~$5500 is more of a traditional pyrolysis machine and it creates oil.";"";"";

quick division of the numbers gives a good estimate of the payout I guess. 
-They approved 685731182544 JPY according to the document
- They have 135357839701 JPY total assets (JPY+BTC+BCH) at current prices
Meaning the payout rate would be approximately 19,7392%

Just a quick estimation of what we can expect. I also see that the trustee rejected coinlabs claim
