I mean this year the gaming variety of nvidia will be coming out  so no major performance improvements , so it will be 1.5-2years at least before another processing based gpu comes along.  Seems like a decent lifespan.  When 1080ti drop down to 300-400 range that will be a steal. I am interested in not so much mining with GPUs but things like vectordash or vast.ai ,  do you have any experience with them ?";"";"";

It is no use restricting official currency to tokens. That is, any payment method recognized outside the ecosystem can be used. That is also the definition of a valuable ecosystem. 

If the token, which is made of ICO, is universal, it is also used in other ecosystems.

But ICO tries to resemble mileage and falls into a more serious logical leap than economists who explain money, and is going to go on about it. If a worthless ecosystem recognizes an unqualified token as an official currency, it is close to claiming that the ecosystem is worthwhile and the token is money.

The real reason why many ICO are blocking in front of regulation may be hidden by the intellectual frailties of those who try ICO, the lack of reflection, and the belief in superstitious logic rather than the will of the regulatory authorities.

Bitcoin, which marks the 10th anniversary of its birth, is demanding a humble reflection on the nature of this phenomenon. No, forcing you.";"";"";
