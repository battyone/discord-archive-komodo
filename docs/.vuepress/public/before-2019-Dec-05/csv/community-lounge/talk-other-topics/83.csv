bitcoin development scenario I think is largely classified into the first half and the second half, or more specifically, in six stages. 

First, the first half is as follows. first, geeky and criminals who are well-versed in computers, and a small group of young people are dealing with bitcoin. this is the period from 2009 when the bitcoin was born to before the bubble in 2017. 

secondly, companies that are interested in the smell of money while bubbling and bit coin demonstrate commercial viability. However, due to the lack of regulation, the moral hazard of companies dealing with bitcoin is serious, resulting in various incidents. this is the situation since 2017. 

third, as trust in the bitcoin market gradually recovers, it is incorporated into the regulatory financial system. as government regulations are strengthened and institutionalization is carried out, the complicants are eliminated. financial institutions treat bitcoin as legitimate investment assets and include bitcoin in their investment portfolios. from now on, it is likely to be realized mainly in the western region within the next five years.

until the first half, the bitcoin is treated as a speculative asset. however, since the bitcoin market has matured and the volatility has decreased, the bitcoin has become a currency since the latter half of the year. I think the second half of bitcoin development is as follows.";"";"";
"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"16-May-19 01:01 PM";"fourth, the bitcoin acts as an internet key. bitcoin serves as a measure of international value and return of all types of digital currencies. In the digital world, a bitcoin-based system is realized. Internet companies and financial companies cooperate to actively develop businesses that utilize bitcoin, and internet companies encroach on retail finance. since then, central banks and the IMF have begun to seriously consider holding a bitcoin. 

fifth, the global financial system collapses due to the financial crisis, and heads of states meet to discuss measures. depending on the level of gold and bitcoin held by each country, the right to speak at the negotiation table is different. world currencies are emerging under the dominance of hegemony and bitcoin directly or indirectly affects the new global monetary system. the central bank and the IMF incorporate the bit coin into the reserve currency. this is the time when gold and bitcoin coexist. 

sixth, as the transition to the digital age accelerates, digital gold bitcoin gradually replace the role of gold. gold is competing with bitcoin, losing its financial function and being used only for industrial purposes or precious metals like silver.";"";"";
