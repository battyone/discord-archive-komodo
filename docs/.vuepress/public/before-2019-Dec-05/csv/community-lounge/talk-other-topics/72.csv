But smart-contract is a beautiful story that is hard to reach.
 
the simple contract that humans make is much more complicated than the Go game in limited space. 

nevertheless, one of the lawyers' sites in the United States, spellbound by the excitedly of the beautiful story that the smart-contract platform be developed by teen genius programmer.
