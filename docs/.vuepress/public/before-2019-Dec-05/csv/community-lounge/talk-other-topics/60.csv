There is an [open PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14121) to merge the [BIP 157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki) aka [Neutrino light client block filter protocol](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/neutrino-privacy-preserving-light-wallet-protocol/)

tldr; Neutrino block filtering protocol will allow mobile non-custodial LN wallets to exist because it can shrink the disk space required to fully validate on-chain tx to only 3.8 GB which can sync to the tip of the blockchain in under an hour! This is means even years old mobile phones can easily handle client side verification. **This is VERY GOOD.**

Do not get it confused with the Neutrino Company coinbase recently acquired and the whole hacking team fiasco.

**The important Neutrino to remember is BIP 157 neutrino.**
