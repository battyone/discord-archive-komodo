Can't agree more!
I started with a Go based web app for Rogue
found what I needed to code to make it run in web page via web terminal 
Maybe I should have just coded the half-working solution
There is a problem which is one of the core feature of Go language, Concurancey. I didn't get that well clearly understood. Spent another week+ reading books and watching video. Understood that to good part, now doing exercise making that issue coded and confirm if it's working.
In my head I'm doing exactly what you saying, but if you mean I should code a code for public testing and use, I'm not going there yet, since I'm focusing on learning first instead of making a sample or something for someone to use.";"";"";

Windows is pretty much the only system that will give you ""issues"", unless you are working with Microsoft tools; basically Visual Studio which comes with a fancy .msi installer takes care of most things for you and you are pretty much stuck with the .NET family of languages. For everything else - Python, Ruby, JS, etc, etc., you are going to need the  Linux subsystem, which will make life a lot easier, but still will be horrible. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

Now, personally, I'd say if you have to resources is to either get a Mac (a BSD under the hood) or go Linux. If you have never used Linux, I think the experience to work in it for your development will make you a better programmer, administrator and a better power user. Languages such as Python thrive when running under a Unix-like environment. Work ""related"" stuff can easily be done with alternatives, but I can understand your fear for crossing over. That's why there is something called dual-boot ;)

Also these ""missing classes"" are often best practices and nine of ten times, a quick google gets you far; its the hacker way.

If you go Linux, I personally love Debian-like distro's, where Ubuntu is probably the most care free for you.";"";"üëç (2),üíØ (1)";
