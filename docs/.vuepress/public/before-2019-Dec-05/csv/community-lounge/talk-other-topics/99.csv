Practical Advice [Ex.Using Komodo/Verus and Establishing, Using & Maintaining Privacy]

Obtaining privacy used to be very difficult. JUMBLR makes it as simple as issuing two command line calls. Higher level layers can be added to help manage the addresses, ie. linking them at the passphrase level. Such matters are left to each implementation.

Once obtained, it is very easy to lose all the privacy. With a single errant transaction that combines some previously used address and the secretaddress, well, the secretaddress is no longer so private.

The advice is to setup a totally separate node!";"";"";
"566901932757614602";"Cruz X (10)#7512";"08-Jul-19 06:47 PM";"This might seem a bit drastic, but if you want to maintain privacy, it is best to make it look like all the transactions are coming from a different node. The easiest way for most people to do this is to actually have a different node.

It can be a dedicated laptop (recommended) or a VPS (for smaller amounts) with a totally fresh komodod wallet. Generate an address on this wallet and use that as the jumblr_secret address on your main node. As the JUMBLR operates funds will teleport into your secret node's address. If you are careful and never use the same IP address for both your nodes, you will be able to maintain very good privacy.

Of course, don't send emails that link the two accounts together! Dont use secret address funds for home delivery purchases! Etc. There are many ways to lose the privacy, just think about what linkages can be dont at the IP and blockchain level and that should be a useful preparation.

What if you have 100,000 KMD and you dont want others to know you are such a whale? Instead of generating 1 secret address, generate 100 and make a script file with:

./komodo-cli jumblr_secret <addr0>
./komodo-cli jumblr_secret <addr1>
...
./komodo-cli jumblr_secret <addr99>

And make sure to delete all traces of this when the JUMBLR is finished. You will end up with 100 addresses that have an average of 1000 KMD each. So as long as you are careful and dont do a 10,000 KMD transaction (that will link 10 of your secret addresses together), you can appear as 100 different people each with 1000 KMD.";"";"";
