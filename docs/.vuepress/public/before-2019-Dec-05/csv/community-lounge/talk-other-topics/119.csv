1: the GS investment opportunity might have been real, however the agama hack caused issue with this. (There was a lot of boo hooing today mentioning the hack and issues it caused k64) GS most likely stepped away then or definitely now. ( Maybe they are still at the table, but after today....)
2. The k64 fat finger dump was most likely them trying to get some initial funding as GS was just a potential offer.
3: There was also hoops that k64 had to jump through in order to get this GS money. X amount of games had to be produced in X time frame. Basically they had to prove they were capable team. 
4. They hastely threw together an expo as a means to fool investers or to try to prove to GS they could do it.  Expo had fake games, or mockups of what could have been. 
5. They never had any code. KMD devs noticed this.
6. They kept moving offices despite not actually even making anything.
7. Didn't pay bills yet could afford first class plane tickets.
8. Took $1000 from Fishyguts for a project called warchain(never happened)
9. People quiting left right.
10. Promises get made, then excuses get made.
11. Weird shit and threats get throw around.
12. Partners, vendors, and CEOs all quit . The guy that owns the intellectual property quit, therefore they start over. Coincidentally he was also the guy to handle the buyback. The new guy that is supposed to handle the buyback, also just quit.
13. Full blown dumpster fire confirmed.";"";"";
