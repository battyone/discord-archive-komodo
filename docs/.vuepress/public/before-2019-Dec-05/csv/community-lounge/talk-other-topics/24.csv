I speak from experience, it took me years to learn this shit and I had the opportunity to field test in a customer support environment, where you have the biggest exposure and endless test subjects, it still feels like being a chameleon, but it has its use. I am not a natural at all in this, I can assure you that the brain is a wonderful thing and it can adapt. I don't think it's valid to use your situation as an excuse as jl777 suggested.
