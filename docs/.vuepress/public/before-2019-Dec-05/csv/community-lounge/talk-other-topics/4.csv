""This is why interdisciplinary study is so important. There are so many problems that have affected multiple fields but were solved independently.

I know everyone shits on liberal arts degrees, but I'm a software developer with a BA in Biology from a small liberal arts school and I am constantly astounded by how much time my coworkers waste reinventing the wheel.

Software engineers are especially bad about this, they often think they are the smartest people in the room and the only reason a problem hasn't been solved is because nobody has tried using programming to solve it. You can see this in the obits from failed silicon valley start ups all the time:

""We thought we could solve [x], but we ran into the totally unforeseen problem of [y]"", when [y] is a problem that literally everyone who has taken a 200 level course in [x] is familiar with. Everyone uses solution [z] instead because it avoids problem [y].

The first step when you try solving a problem should be to assume someone else already solved it and figure out how to find that person.""";"";"";

A difference in hash rate is a LITERAL FIGURE showing you this is false
>IMO when you have two powerhouse coins like that on the same algorithm no one is incentived to attack.
On the contrary, because bcash is large enough to have multiple locations available to short it, and easily attacked by the abundance of hash rate mining bitcoin, there's is a huge financial motive and easy avenue for a large mining farm or operation to carry out such an attack. IMO when you have two powerhouse coins like that on the same algorithm no one is incentived to attack.
>I think if anything, BTC is the one with the problem, as BitMain controls about 60% of the hash rate, and we know they like BCH.
Producing the hardware =! controlling the hardware. Bitmain are now also losing the development race to Halong and GMO. Don't mistake a temporary market lead for a monopoly
