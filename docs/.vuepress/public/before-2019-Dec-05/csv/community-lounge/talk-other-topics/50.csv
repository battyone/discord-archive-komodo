"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"07-Feb-19 02:03 AM";"What I learned by erasing my previous understanding of bitcoin and re-study

The world is reality in reality. In reality, there is a law, and no matter how technological philosophy is shouted, the market economy finally concludes the technology. Satoshi Nakamoto has a foresight that can not be compared with the block-chain developers who are active now, and it is not only the cryptographic technology but also the economy, legal system, business , game theory to created a 'realistic' system. 
we just did understand what we saw in terms of technology.

Satoshi certainly had the ability to concentrate more on anonymity and decentralization to create a destructive technology like Napster. Instead, satoshi have provided a viable solution for the world we live in. That's because satoshi believed that bitcoin was the only way to survive. On the other hand, whenever new technologies emerge, it is regrettable to see entrepreneurs and academics who criticize the conservatism of political and regulatory authorities unconditionally, and to see the legal community joining the ranks without understanding it.";"";"";
"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"07-Feb-19 02:30 AM";"Satoshi designed Bitcoin to be a real currency, and Satoshi's reality is not just a viable technology but a world where laws, regulations, government, private companies and corporations coexist. In other words, when designing digital currency, the reality of the law has to be considered beyond just a technical approach, and the data of Bitcoin's digital signature play a very central role in reflecting reality.";"";"";
"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"07-Feb-19 02:35 AM";"At a time when most developing countries recognize digital signatures as legally valid, electronic signatures, whether Bitcoin or credit card, are necessary. This is because improper or illegal transactions serve as the basis for dispute resolution or legal punishment. Without these digital signature data, Satoshi designed to insert digital signature information into all transactions, as the country faces a situation where new concepts are inserted into the existing system or changes to the existing system. Why did satoshi add information that was technically useless without a reason?";"";"";
"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"07-Feb-19 02:38 AM";"Of course, the core developers of Bitcoin were mostly from Cypherfunk and many of them had an anarchistic nature, and they would never have understood the design choices taking into account these legislative situations. digital signature information would have been perceived as only data that occupies only storage space and hinders scalability.";"";"";
"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"07-Feb-19 04:07 AM";"pseudonymity and anonymity

Developers with Anarchist tendencies thought that complete anonymity was needed for transparent bitcoin with all transaction details, balances, and wallet addresses disclosed. They argued that a 100% anonymous system would give real financial freedom and solve the problem of fungibility, and based on this logic, the coins of Dash, Monero and Zcash were born.

Did Satoshi not add anonymity to Bitcoin because he did not understand such technologies as mixing technology, ring cignature, and zero-knowledge proof? 
No, the writing Satoshi left for the 2010 Forum shows that he did not intentionally use anonymous technology for Bitcoin.
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=234.msg1976#msg1976

Satoshi targeted not 'out of the government's reach' but rather a fully institutionalized one In order for Bitcoin to be institutionalized, it must first be neutral and secondly be able to provable";"";"";
"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"07-Feb-19 04:11 AM";"neutral means that since each countries have different legal and irlegal standards, it is necessary to maintain the neutrality of the law if Bitcoin is to be accepted internationally (or act as a currency of goods, such as gold, or act like paper money). This means that the use of bitcoin may be used in the illegal or in the legal domain.";"";"";
"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"07-Feb-19 04:28 AM";"This neutrality can only be implemented in networks with pseudonymity, not anonymity, because 'evidence' is possible. In the same context as the above-mentioned digital signatures, it is possible to prove that A sent a transaction to B, which can be accepted within the legal system. While neutrality guarantees that someone will be able to use Bitcoin for illegal activities, it also means that there should be room for evidence to punish if they do something illegal. In other words, a system that guarantees thorough anonymity can never be institutionalized.";"";"";
"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"07-Feb-19 04:39 AM";"vision

There is a vision that someone has set in the birth of every great invention or enterprise. The vision is the possibility of changing the world that an inventor or entrepreneur sees, and they act to make the possibility real. However, the people around the person who showed the possibility of innovation never see the whole possibility because they can only see one side of technology or corporate vision.";"";"";
"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"07-Feb-19 04:44 AM";"Paul Krugman, who said the Internet would not have as much impact on the world as a fax machine.

When Yahoo proposed Facebook to take 1 billion dollars , the reason why there were people like investors who wanted the deal was because they couldn't see the entire blueprint and could only see a section at a certain time.";"";"";
"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"07-Feb-19 04:50 AM";"Likewise, we have not understood Satoshi's intentions. Since Satoshi disappeared too early, the sound of a people on behalf of him was very ideological. It is meant to break down the social evil banks and financial institutions through decentralization and decentralization, to secure freedom of finance and autonomy, and to create a system that can't be stopped by any government or a third party. I also used this way of thinking to technology and to predict the direction of industry.

Satoshi never approached Bitcoin ideologically. He believed and designed Bitcoin as a real-life global currency. 
We just screwed up because we didn't understand.";"";"";
