I started adding some products/articles for a new Shop on my website and I'm using affiliates (referral links) at the moment. They are ITP (Intelligent Tracking Protection) compliant, so they use only first party cookies (not the third party cookies that follow you around showing you the same ads everywhere).

 But I would prefer to sell my own products, also because the profits on referrals are very low, especially for a niche site on privacy. So if there are any logos/designs from the Komodo ecosystem that I can use to design some t-shirts etc please let me know. I found some affiliates for Hush clothing, Monero, Grin, Zcash...but the ones I found for Komodo are still using the old logo";"";"";

1) I create a coin and then put it on any exchanges

2) If I integrate an exchange like Sideshift (and even AtomicDEX I think offer integrations).
