Any suggestions on how to monetise a site without compromising on privacy?

Do you know of any forms of ethical advertising/affiliates where people are not tracked with cookies across the web? 
I read that it's possible...in the sense that if they buy something from a totally unique link given to you, that's what tells the seller the buyer comes from you.

 The other common method is more effective, they usually use an ID that is in a cookie and it tracks visitors, but I don't want to use it - the whole site is focused on Privacy tech so it wouldn't be right.

My other idea is to integrate a form of crypto exchange, maybe something like what sideshift.ai offer to their partners

Would like to also make a utility coin with optional Z-addresses that members can use to pay for premium listings/special features and receive a discount if they use it.";"";"";
