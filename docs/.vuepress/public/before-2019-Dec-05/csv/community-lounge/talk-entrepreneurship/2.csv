UK is a crypto friendly country - i was looking for months for a proper setup and didn't see the trees for the forest

1. main banks are crypto friendly (barclays actually welcome crypto businesses as they are building their own blockchain)
2. company formation is cheap (aprox ¬£150 with all the bells and whistles; cheapest i saw was around ¬£40) and you don't have to be a resident
3. gov has passed **some** crypto tax regulation but they left it at a case by case basis basically meaning don't be a dickhead and pay **some** tax - hmrc (irs equivalent) is more than helpful with info - long term hodlers pay 0% tax, traders need to qualify under what they call ""badges of trade"" and pay cgt (capital gains tax - 20% of profits), trust funds are possible to alleviate %
4. corporation tax is 19% but there are loads of deductibles
5. london is one of the most respected financial centers
6. if brexit happens, regulations are more likely to be even more relaxed - brits in general like privacy, but had to go by eu laws & regulations (aml, etc)
7. plenty of crypto accountants & lawyers offering their services which lets u focus on actually running your business and they deal with all the tax non-sense";"";"";
