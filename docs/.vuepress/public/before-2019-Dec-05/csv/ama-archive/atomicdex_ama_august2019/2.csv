1 - if a group of persons wants to add one coin (BTC clone or Dash clone), should the group ask the KMD team to add the coin ? What if the team disagree to add the coin on atomicDEX ?
2 - I heard that the whole backend would be opensource, can you tell me where the repo is ? (maybe code will be released in the future)
3 - (similar question/topic to @Camilo Lopez ) websites such as zigzag.io allows to do trading between offchain (LN) and onchain (BTC, Dash, ...), do you plan to make this happen also on atomicDEX ?";"";"";

1 - are you referring to the mobile application or to an official config integration on the API (mm2) repo?
2 - yes it is available under https://github.com/komodoplatform/atomicdex-api
3 - we are actively exploring other protocols and integration possibilities to improve our DEX technology - there is a prioritisation based on the github issue tickets. I want to invite you to submit this ideas as feature requests and to open the active dev discussion around this topic. We do want to support as many technologies and protocols in atomicDEX as possible.";"";"";

1 - the question can apply to each one I think (I though it was the same backend for both)
2 - thank you
3 - the problem here is that jl777 have some concerns about LN security (in theory he is right, in reality, it was not exploited yet I heard) and I'm not sure that there is a way to do atomic swap securely between LN and KMD (in theory, it is possible but I'm not 100% sure). One idea can be to restrict topology (as jl777 did for CHIPS) to avoid long routes with possible stealers. I'll put some infos on github";"";"";

Using isolated/custom netIDs on UI side or using a pubkey whitelisting logic on the protocol side. The latter is the goal and more clean implementation.";"";"3040_kingpeepo (1)";

Looking at dex now i don‚Äôt see many users using it + i am sure we will face liquidity issues (remember first dex which was used by few ppl only and was not popular at all). What is the plan?

Adding a new coin to the atomicDEX API repository is trivial for any external party and consists of a simple set of git PRs. This gives any compatible coin native DEX support. For the mobile application listing projects have to reach out to us since this is considered a enduser application/product and being distribution through our official software distribution channels. i.e. we have to validate things and make sure that everything is good. 
3 - technically it is certainly possible to integrate it and to bridge LN<->atomicDEX. However, I do fully share James security concerns.";"";"";

This is the stage where we are still able to modify fundamental layers in the DEX core/protocol but also on the UI/UX side and general system architecture and design. If you are around in other coin communities plz do suggest them to join this beta program and to sign up for the beta. The user feedback is the most valuable thing that devs get from a beta program.";"";"";
