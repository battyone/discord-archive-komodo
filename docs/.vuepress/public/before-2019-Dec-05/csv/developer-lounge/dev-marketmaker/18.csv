> and found that swaps seem to be able to recover after an error event

I might very well be mistaken, but I don't see how this follows from the link. `SavedSwap` is used to continue with the SWAP after the MarketMaker was stopped. This might be particularly useful on mobile, where the operating systems are free to kick us out whenever, and the ability to continue with the SWAP gives us a chance to finish it when the user returns to the app.";"";"";

`> Do any error events prevent the swap from being saved?`

I think not. Events are serialized regardless of whether they are good or bad.

`> Does the swap uuid change?`

No.

`> Is the last event (even after an error) in my_swap_status always ""Finished""?`

It should be, though it might be finished with error.
If the SWAP is never finished, it might indicate a condition we don't know how to handle yet, or a bug.";"";"👍 (2)";

1. orders appear to persist on the books when MM2 is stopped and restarted. I see this with the CLI and the Chainmakers app. 
- set a 'setprice' order
- issue the 'mm2 stop' command, see the confirmation
- wait a while, issue MM2 start order
- check orderbooks, the original order is still there.
Questions 
- is this expected?
- if yes, how to properly clear orders from the orderbook? 
- are these orders fillable?
- If we get people creating orders, then shutting down their MM2 (using AtomicDex, i.e.), we will have a ton of garbage orders in the books with no way of knowing which ones are real";"";"";
