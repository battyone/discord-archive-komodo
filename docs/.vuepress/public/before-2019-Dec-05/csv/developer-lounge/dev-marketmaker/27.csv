- I can't match my own orders. If I create a sell and a buy that should match with the same client, nothing happens (I used ``setprice``)
- I was able to swap if I create orders from atomicdex-api with ``setprice`` then create the matching orders on atomicdex from my phone
- I'm testing but it doesn't seem to work to create new orders with my phone then create the matching order with atomicdex-api using ``setprice``
Should I use ``buy`` sometimes ? How can I know when I should use ``buy``, ``sell`` or ``setprice`` ?
But I don't use <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#note-about-rational-number-type> but it doesn't work with round numbers 0.5 / 1 / 2 so I don't think that it is number type bug.
Thank you";"";"";

I'm not sure i understand this one, but if i'm correct a send / buy is something that is broadcasted on the network. if in 30 seconds no reply comes in, it will be converted from taker to maker and will be put in the orderbook for others to buy / sell";"";"";

This is how it normally works; setprice is when you want to make a market";"";"";
"242635006516658197";"jorian#4555";"29-Nov-19 09:20 AM";"in fact, every unmatched buy / sell will eventually become a setprice, conceptually";"";"";

that is because setprice isn't a taker order";"";"";

sorry I mean that I used ``setprice`` to swap 1 RICK to 1 MORTY and I did a second call with the same client/wallet to swap 1 MORTY to 1 RICK, it didn't work (but I think that it is because it was done from the same client/wallet)";"";"";
