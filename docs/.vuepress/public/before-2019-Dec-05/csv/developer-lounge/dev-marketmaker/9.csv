I’m still unclear how well order matching is working right now with so few users. My bob seems to generally fulfill orders on all pairs I have setup, but I don’t know what the true success rate is. For all I know there are lots of failed matches, or there just isn’t enough activity/attempts. For whatever reason I don’t have much luck when doing Alice buys. Sometimes, but rare.
