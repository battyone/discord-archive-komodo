I have this for the `enable` endpoint:

```
{
    method: 'enable',
    coin: 'MYTH',
    urls: [
        'http://eth1.cipig.net:8555',
        'http://eth2.cipig.net:8555',
        'http://eth3.cipig.net:8555',
    ],
    swap_contract_address: '0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871', // Swap smart contract on the ETH mainnet
    mm2: 1
}
```

Where do I put in the `MYTH` contract address? I'm clearly misunderstanding how this all works.

Here's the MYTH token: https://etherscan.io/token/0x277ab4b9dde09a8e710fd755deeb9d0d9532d047";"";"";

every ERC20 coin on the ETH chain can be enabled with the same urls (`eth1-3.cipig.net:8555`)";"";"";
