Interestingly I seem to have LTC, BTC and BCH running and showing balances etc within bdex, but not KMD. I did notice that the expectation of where these config files reside changed. I changed the path of my config files accordingly, which helped bch/ltc/btc, but not kmd. The path (the path bdex says its expecting) seems odd/redundant. For example: ```/Users/tolken/Library/Application Support/Library/Application Support/Komodo/komodo.conf``` This path isn't the path Agama is using though. Will this cause issues like the one I'm experiencing? To be clear - Bdex finds the path to the Komodo.conf when I place it there, but it won't show any balance (which I know it has)";"";"";
