New swap functions don't currently save the state of swap to filesystem so in case of abortion swap will be stuck. It's planned to finish ETH and Electrum support on next week. So I think we will have something testable in January. The guide  https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/tree/mm2-dice#cmake-build-of-marketmaker-with-linked-etomic-lib-for-etherc20-atomic-swaps is outdated.
Actually we have ""old style ETH/ERC20/Electrum"" nightly builds here: http://195.201.0.6/etomic/, however these might contain same issues as actual release build from my fork.";"";"";

Also some UTXO validation on order matching is removed in these so maybe `alice not eligible` won't happen. But anyway: `use at your own risk`.";"";"👍 (1)";
