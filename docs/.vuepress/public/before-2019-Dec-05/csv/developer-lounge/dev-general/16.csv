IIRC, DHT doesn't have it as a standard of any kind, but some of the major clients implement hole-punching extensions. Thing is, ŒºTorrent isn't OSS and it's hard to say where to look next. (P.S. Googling ""*dht hole punching*"" gives some POC-level OSS results though! - hyperdht, blunty)

UPnP is a separate thing and isn't as reliable AFAIK.

ZeroNet is on our radar, cool that you'd mention it, do you have any further intel?

I2P ( http://www.geti2p.org/todo.html#nat ) doesn't look like a real hole punching to me, and I'm reluctant to start with that kind of message routing because it raises a bunch of different questions, but come to think of it I should still add such message routing to the list.";"";"";

When we do `listaddressgroupings`, that address has 5.12 coins. 

But when we do `getaddressbalance`, that address has 10.29.

In the `curl` command example, I'm assuming I need to change the `http://127.0.0.1:7771/` to the port on my local host. 

I tried both the ports listed in my regtest chain, `9800` and `9801`, from what I saw on the coin daemon launch.

The first returned an error, and the second didn't have anything returned.

I deleted `--user myusername`, since I'm running it locally, but maybe that was a mistake, too.

Nice to see you here. I saw your twitter profile sometime ago. 
Not working on Agama myself, but perhaps there's someone here who can help.

I'm assuming you're in touch with pbca26?

Also, do you want to give more details on what you're looking for?";"";"";

Working through some of our `addressindex` startup parameters. Need just some basic descriptions.

`-timestampindex`: I'm assuming this is simply an index of all timestamps (for blocks, transactions, etc.), just like the `addressindex` is for addresses.

`-unspentindex`: I'm assuming this is for utxos?
`-spentindex`: transactions, txids?

Also, on all of these, including `-addressindex`, does using this automatically trigger a full resync? Or do you have to delete manually?";"";"";

Take a look at where it is currently. 
Just finished the first section - AddressIndex.

Should go much faster now, thanks to help from many in getting a regtest setup.";"";"";
