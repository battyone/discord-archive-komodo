"209024368968204288";"artemciy_dice#0049";"26-Oct-18 09:25 AM";"So my advice would be to go with a fresh SQLite, using a simple table as a KV store, and having the power of introducing more complex structures if and when you need it.";"";"";
"209024368968204288";"artemciy_dice#0049";"26-Oct-18 09:30 AM";"Advantages of SQLite over LevelDB/RocksDB is that the classical B+tree algorithm, when done right, is still faster than the LevelDB layered append-only thing. And that you can connect from multiple processes, watching what's going on in the database while your app works (plus SQL makes it easier to do). And when you need indexing and stuff, you just have it and don't need to compensate with complex database-like layers in your app.";"";"";
"209024368968204288";"artemciy_dice#0049";"26-Oct-18 09:32 AM";"On the other hand, if you need the absolute-best recoverability, or if you want to be able to backup your database always with but a simple rsync, then go with LevelDB/RocksDB. The append-only approach there makes the database pretty much unsinkable (until there's a bug in the implementation, unfortunately LevelDB isn't 100% bug free, but a chance of stumbling upon one is very small).";"";"";
"209024368968204288";"artemciy_dice#0049";"26-Oct-18 09:36 AM";"Ping me if you need further help with [tuning] SQLite.";"";"";
"371114647052615681";"Mylo#8306";"26-Oct-18 09:51 AM";"Absolute best recoverability is handled by the blockchain if resync required if the design/workflow of this app can be handled like this.  Portability and sql-ness of using SQLite sounds much more advantageous imo";"";"";
"371114647052615681";"Mylo#8306";"26-Oct-18 09:52 AM";"But not sure exactly what app is doing, so maybe not a good opinion:)";"";"";
"209024368968204288";"artemciy_dice#0049";"26-Oct-18 09:57 AM";"So, blockchain is a distributed database which is of course cool but an entirely different field. But the local database used by a blockchain isn't always reliable. When you crash or kill `komodod`, for example, you can loose the local blockchain and will need to wait for quite some time for resync. LevelDB/RocksDB approach and implementation, if we look at them in isolation from the distributed ledger/backup aspects, is the most resilient one in that local operation regard.
SQLite is durable as well, but due to the more invasive nature of B+tree operations the durability there is more precarious and can be toppled when hardware misbehaves.";"";"";
"209024368968204288";"artemciy_dice#0049";"26-Oct-18 10:21 AM";"Or when the user misbehaves, like when I copy a database which is being in use (my favorite thing to do with embedded database).";"";"";
