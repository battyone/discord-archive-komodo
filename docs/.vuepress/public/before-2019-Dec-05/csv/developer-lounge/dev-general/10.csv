It's possible that I may be in charge of some of the writing things coming up soon -- adding to the white paper and increasing the UX experience of Komodo documentation.

It's more writing stuff (what I'm already experienced in), but I've told Steve since I first started working here that I'm trying to shift into automation and coding. 

It may be a good fit for me to manage the documentation here and also to write simple tutorials in our education center. That's kind of what I think everyone was thinking.

I'd be happy, since it'd be coding related. I'm just hoping that I can have some kind of coding responsibility in the underlying code for the documentation center, if it would be useful for the team.";"";"";
