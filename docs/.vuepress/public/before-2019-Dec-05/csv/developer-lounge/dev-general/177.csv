it wasn't querying the daemon for the txn, it was manually creating the txn using bitcore-node and bitcore-lib
so from insight-api to insight-ui a newly constructed transaction comes, so the rawconfirmations vs confirmations difference is lost there and there isn't even a field called rawconfs in the insight api's output
for example for getting confs, they are using
```
var confirmations = 0;
  if(transaction.height >= 0) {
    confirmations = this.node.services.bitcoind.height - transaction.height + 1;
  }

I've got the dPoW confs to display on insight exlorer, you can see the progression of a txn's state as blocks get added and notarizations happen from the images above 
right now:
```
daemon - explorer
confirmation - notary confirmation
rawconfirmation - confirmation
```
eventhough this system the daemon uses to convey the info is understandable by devs, to normal people it would be too confusing

So, the above thing is a proof of concept, I will be tweaking it to have only one conf tab. Its behaviour:
red - unconfirmed
orange with number of confs- confirmed but not dpowed
green with number of confs - dpowed
this should be clear to everyone";"";"";
