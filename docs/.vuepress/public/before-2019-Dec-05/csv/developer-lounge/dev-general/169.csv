Thanks for this PR.

When the format for Sapling incoming viewing keys (section 5.6.6 of the protocol spec) was defined, I overlooked that there would not be sufficient information to tell which address it was meant for. We'll need to consider whether the external format should change in order to include that information, before merging this PR or equivalent.
