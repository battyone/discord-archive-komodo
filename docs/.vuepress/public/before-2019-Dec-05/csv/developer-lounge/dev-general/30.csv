This method ""not super clever"" and if funds on other address I'm just receive `""message"": ""Could not find any non-coinbase UTXOs to spend.""` in `z_getoperationstatus`.
For now I found only solution like a:
1) get all addresses list
`./komodo-cli getaddressesbyaccount """"`
2) check balance for each address and provide user table `address - balance` so he'll able to choose needed address which will be used in `z_sendmany`

Other idea to `getaccountaddress` send whole balance on it and then use this address in z_sendmany - but user will lose txfee on each call

Is there some native call to get list of addresses with balances to assist user with sending address choice - maybe I'm missing something?";"";"";

But it does that the side use of determining which addresses have which amount.

The other method I can remember off the top of my head is to do `listaddresses`, and then do a `getbalance` of each address, which may not be bad in a script, but isn't as useful in the terminal.";"";"👍 (1)";

could you set `ac_decay` above 100000000? That would make it so that the block reward increases over time. 

Not sure why you might want a coin that's scarce at first, and then becomes less valuable over time...

but I guess that's what governments do, with inflation. 

Maybe you'd want some inflation, so people are inclined not to hold the asset for too long, but instead keep it moving...";"";"";
