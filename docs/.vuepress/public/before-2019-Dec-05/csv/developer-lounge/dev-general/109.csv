Another question.

I was able to get a curl command working for `z_listunspent` on the BEER chain. 

The returned value has more in it than I expected.

Command:

```
curl --user rpcuser:rpcpassword --data-binary '{""jsonrpc"": ""1.0"", ""id"":""curltest"", ""method"": ""z_listunspent"", ""params"": [1, 9999999, false, [""zs1umhaattx6lna933m9zwfqlmkm2qj49hpa9lnymtj5h5c7cwtd3evfpu29hppprax9cs45fzeyqg""] ] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:rpcport/
```

Response:

```

```


Look at the first line after the command:

```
blockHash 0a4f15fe5425ef8bc6eb84e7bc3625c1ceccb3e49132b696a1841ab17a75a705 height 55200
```

It looks self explanatory, but can you tell me more about this?

Why isn't this showing up in a non-curl command? Is it something unique to z_listunspent commands, or did something change application-wide?";"";"";

I don't deal with that repo much -- I'm not sure how the sidebar is structured.

I only started learning javascript after es6 was released. 

It got rid of many of the worst things, like scoping, semi-colons, and all the weird syntax

As long as you don't get into async stuff or recursive stuff, I find it to be rather straight forward. 

Nothing much else to compare to, though.

I think squashed commits are good when you have a messy history, but I don't think we need to make that a hard rule, like other projects do.

Ofc if you have good commit message and you have two or three commits then it is ok to merge it without squash. But my point is to avoid merging a lot of commits from local development and put them in a major branch like FSM. When I develop most of the time I make commit with 'Fix' message as I'm trying something. When I finish I squash everything in my FSM with good commit message, and then merge it in Komodo FSM.";"";"";

I agree. I'm aware of the incentive many developers get for learning Lisp. I'd like to take a look at it at some point. My to-do list is quite long, and I only get about 15 or so hours a week of personal study time.

But as an easy entry into programming, beyond JavaScript, I'm not aware of anything that's easier to pick up and to make something useful out of it. 

The only thing that comes close is Python, but you can't be as useful on the web with Python. You have to be in the geographical location where your desired line of study is desired.

If WASM changes that, I wouldn't be surprised. 

But I've looked into WASM a bit, and I think the real power from WASM in non-C++, Rust, or Go languages is still a few years away. Maybe two or three, or more.

WASM has some limitations that makes it currently unsuitable for high-level programming tasks -- namely, stitching things together and tying together many disparate resources. This makes WASM good for super powerful and computational intensive stuff, but the ""lego"" effect that you find in other languages is currently easier to achieve elsewhere .

I'd like to head to C++, whenever I feel moderately comfortable with JavaScript and ready to try something new. I really hope to skip Php, even as a web developer, but it may not be possible. Anyway, WASM does look exciting.

Most likely though, I'll probably wind up doing Python next, if anything.";"";"";

The `async` and `await` commands that arrived with es6 make it fairly easy, but you still have to be careful. 

My point is that it's not as straight forward. 

Recursive stuff, however -- JavaScript doesn't seem to be built for it as much as you might find in a language like Lisp.";"";"";
