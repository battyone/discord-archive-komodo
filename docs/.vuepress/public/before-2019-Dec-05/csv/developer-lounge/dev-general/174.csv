can we have a doc similar to this: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/python-rpc-komodod.html
for all the backend programming languages, starting from C, C++ to javascript,  RUST, Go and java ?
the slickrpc module used in the python doc above is just a wrapper around a regular curl command : https://github.com/barjomet/slick-bitcoinrpc/blob/master/slickrpc/rpc.py
it was developed with bitcoin in mind, but it can be used with komodo too

I expect similar things are already available in all the above languages for bitcoin so we need people who know these languages to look for the specific packages/modules/code-snippets and write a simple readme with instructions on how to call an rpc and how to receive its output in the above languages

This will be a valuable addition to our docs and reduce some barrier to newer devs that are experimenting and are not comfortable with bash scripting or just copy pasting comands into the terminal";"";"üëç (1)";
