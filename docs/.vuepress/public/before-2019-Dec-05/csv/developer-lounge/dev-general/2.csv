Because confirmations are reported across nodes, there's a period of time between when a node confirms a transaction and when the confirmation is communicated to the network. I know that each of the independent chains doesn't need to be quite as distributed as the bitcoin network, but they'd still be hosted on multiple nodes, meaning each of them experiences a degree of latency. If they're all mined on a single node, it would be much faster than if the independent nodes were distributed as would occur in the real world.";"";"";

Hello, I'm the lead author of ERC-721 (the ""Non-fungible Token Standard"" or ""Deeds"") which is how collectable crypto-assets can work interoperability with crypto-collecting wallets.

I believe this is the technology that is implied to power MLB Crypto Baseball.

Right now I am skeptical that this project is real. First all of the news is related to ICO/blockchain news/nerd news. Can anybody point to a press release or Tweet FROM Major League Baseball that confirms this licensing deal is authentic? I have seen other crypto companies that announced a deal with Visa and Mastercard, later to find out that those companies did not actually authorize any deal.

Also the website here https://www.lucidsight.com/ [lucidsight.com] does not have a trademark symbol next to MLB Crypto Baseball. Nor does it have a registered trademark symbol next to the MLB logo. Nor does the bottom of the website say ""The MLB logo is a registered trademark of Major League Baseball."" So I'm going to say this is pretty much bullshit. I went to the LIMA licensing conference in Las Vegas this year -- entities like MLB don't draft rookies like Lucid Sight.

In other news, the 0xcert promo video (I'm an advisor to them) did just release a promo video listing collectable baseball cards as a target use case. So we are planning to make this work. And if MLB is reading this, call me.
