for dpow integration of cryptonote protocol, #blur is alread developing on that integration.  maybe you can chat to them about it and co-develop the integration

adaptive pow is very freshly in komodo, i cannot comment on it.

if you want those without spending your development time, you can spin up a smart chain in 5 mins and have the same autonomy you currently have, including working on the dilithium stuff.

what are devs thoughts on governance?```
As @Mylo mentioned we have an on-chain voting mechanism in #kmdlabs.
My feeling is that  votes, polls and surveys are all great basic 'tools' that all have their place in governance.
I have made a suggestion that could really use some feedback.  The suggestion is for a way to make use of these various tools for serious and/or controversial issues.
The suggested method is not a governance model, but a tool that could be used in creating such a system, with the aim of minimizing personal conflict through providing focus on issues and ideas rather than personalities.

Is there any reason why you didn't include addressindex=1 & spentindex=1 in https://github.com/jl777/komodo#create-komodoconf as you did with txindex? Also why error message in API says the pubkey is not specifed when indexes are not enabled?";"";"";

the other indexes are optional for the basic functionality of the chain

the pubkey error message is on a smartchain correct?
if so, it means exactly that, you have to start the chain with a pubkey parameter as it is essential for using Antara modules

-- there will always be a barrier to following Komodo and reading about development and progress. Even visiting the website and taking the time to read the blog post is a barrier

-- We don't want to hide or restrict the TT updates, we want to create an incentive for people to sign up for the email list.

-- if we don't have unique, exclusive content for the newsletter and it's all recycled content/posts/links from the website and Komodo's social media, very few people will read it

-- all important updates and relevant content will of course be published on the website for everyone";"";"";

In the past, the email list has been the same content for everyone. Now, we're looking to provide content that's more customized to people's interests. Developers will get he TT update, Enterprise/Business will get more industry info and competitive analysis, and blockchain enthusiasts will get more info about Komodo, meetups, media coverage, and marketing efforts";"";"";

getting more newsletters subscribers is a good idea, but not at the expense of holding back information. tech tuesdays are an excellent regular read about project progress and good for grassroots social media contributions. personally i've gotten a lot of tweetable stuff from those";"";"üëÜüèΩ (1)";
