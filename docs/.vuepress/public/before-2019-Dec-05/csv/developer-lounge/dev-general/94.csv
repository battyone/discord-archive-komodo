When your online please msg me, I am kind of very confused as to whats happenign with this sync issue. The function returns a valid block as long as the block is not a notary mined block, but only does so when its received in advance, and the height is over 1 million. Maybe as a fix this check can be moved so it only checks when joinging the blocks together rather than in the CheckBlockHeader ?";"";"";

I know exactly why its happening but I dont know what the reasoning behind this code is^^^^ multiplies by 1 if the height is over 1 million blocks. Instantly starts failing. It will still sync (but much slower and goes though nearly all of the avalibe peers, unless you keep doing clearbanned).

Never forget that if you deal with raw transactions and set nlocktime:
sapling opt-out chains (such as OOT) need to use the old format
sapling chains need to use the new format (including nExpiryHeight)
