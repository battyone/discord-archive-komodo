1.  Here's a fork of the platform docs, do not rely on it!!  But these destructions will get you to your own html copy on your local machine https://github.com/imylomylo/KomodoPlatformdocs/blob/master/docs/install.txt
2.  Using the output html, you could maybe include it or some other way (file at a time) into a react component like the answer here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39758136/render-html-string-as-real-html-in-a-react-component

OR

Some other react-inject-html method.

In the instructions of install.txt above, instead of `make html` you could get lucky with `make xml` following http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.5.1/man/sphinx-build.html and from this xml convert it to json with https://github.com/hay/xml2json

And then use the json structures inside your react component to get _the good bits_ 
YMMV of course, but could be a handy way of extracting useful bits of info for side-doc-projects etc.";"";"";

Soon though, hopefully. 

In the meantime, I'm just using Node.js, PostgreSQL (with Sequelize as middleware), and Express.js as well. 

Not sure what that might change for the Travis stuff. I'll take a look.";"";"";

All the python stuff was kind of confusing, but I found a much easier workaround.

Just using a standalone file converter called `pandoc` seems to do the trick just fine.

It doesn't have a whole lot of automation for the file directory structure, but I think I can get enough mileage out of the `fs` module to get by.";"";"";
