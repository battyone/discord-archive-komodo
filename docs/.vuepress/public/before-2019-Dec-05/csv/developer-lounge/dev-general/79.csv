With the PirlGuard Protocol deployed the chances of an attack succeeding are vastly reduced. As we know once the attacker has created a longer chain through privately mining a separate chain they will then have to broadcast it to the network. Once the attacker opens their node for peering it will attempt to peer with rest of the nodes on the network, telling them that they are wrong. However, once this happens PirlGuard will drop the peer and penalize them by sentencing them to mine X amount of penalty blocks due to their un-peered mining. The amount of penalty blocks assigned depends on the amount of blocks that the malicious miner mined in private.""  Couldnt you just have peers on the private chain network, circumventing all of this?   Or even more maliciously,  have pirlguard block out legitimate miners as they wouldnt have been peers in the attackers version of pirl";"";"";

The other, more naive approach is to simply cap reorganisations greater than P blocks. However there are serious problems with this approach, if an attacker can produce a chain of length P+1 and submit it to a different edge of the network as the non attacking chain is being checkpointed, then the network will diverge and will be unable to merge back into a single chain, effectively permanently forking the chain. This attack could, for example, deliberately target an exchange to put the exchange on a fork controlled by the attacker but distinct from the main network until manual maintenance is undertaken by the exchange to re-sync to the proper network chain.
