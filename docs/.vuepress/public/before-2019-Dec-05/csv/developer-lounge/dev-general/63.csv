But doing something like
```
1.  git diff branch-a branch-b > mega.patch 
2.  sed -i ‘s/^\-//g’ mega.patch
3.  sed -i ‘s/^\+//g’ mega.patch
```
1.  Puts output to file `mega.patch`
2.  Replaces first char of each line (^) escaped (\) minus
3.  Same but with plus

That might give you something to work with.
In `mega.patch` you may be able to do some clever parsing to write smaller patches for individual files?";"";"";
