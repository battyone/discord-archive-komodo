Result Aggregation Once the oracles have revealed their results to the oracle contract, their results will be fed to the aggregating contract. The aggregating contract
tallies the collective results and calculates a weighted answer. The validity of each
oracle response is then reported to the reputation contract. Finally, the weighted
answer is returned to the specified contract function in USER-SC.
Detecting outlying or incorrect values is a problem that is specific to each type
of data feed and application. For instance, detecting and rejecting outlying answers
before averaging may be necessary for numeric data but not boolean. For this reason,
there will not be a specific aggregating contract, but a configurable contract address
which is specified by the purchaser. ChainLink will include a standard set of aggregating contracts, but customized contracts may also be specified, provided they
conform to the standard calculation interface.";"";"";
