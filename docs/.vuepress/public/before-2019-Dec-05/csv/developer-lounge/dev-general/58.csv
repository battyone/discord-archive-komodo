I'm seeing a lot of new devs show up.

Just a reminder, the new streamlined documentation that's targeted for new developers is almost done.

You can use it in advance here:

https://siddhartha-komodo.github.io/slate/#introduction

We hope to get it to the main website very soon. Just finishing a few things -- namely, the gateways smart contract and some instructions on creating a cc pubkey address, and then a final check down to make sure all is good.";"";"";
