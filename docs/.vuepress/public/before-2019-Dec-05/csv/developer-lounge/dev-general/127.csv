When you get a chance, can you please review this CC-Gateways documentation?

I have taken it as far as my knowledge of CC-Gateways allows. 

There are many elements in the docs where the nature of how it works becomes foggy to me, so I've done the best I can to describe what I know, and now I leave it up to the dev team to point out technical errors.

If you can find time to help on this, the best way to do it is to fork the dev branch to your own local github repo, make whatever changes you want there, and then send everything back as a single pull request. 

Thank you, let me know if you'll have time.

so, the first task was to figure out how to show this Terminal only game over a web page, for which I'm using GoTTY go code, in combination of Go's native net/http and template library to just make the basic web page for initial tests.
I was trying to modify the behaviour of GoTTY, but for some reason it's not accepting my customisation in it's compiled js, and it's packaged .gohtml file. Spent good amount of time scratching my head around it why. So, not to spend enough time on just that 3rd paty package, I'm gonna use alternative solution which I had in mind. I'll try to use Go concurency, go routines + channels + websockets to manage the behavior I want.
Which is, user input taken from a web page -> Web TTY is displayed to user with game ready to play -> Game ends -> Web TTY session ends -> { At this point the user should be redirected back to the web interface with controls to do further actions }. This last part was where I spent long time troubleshooting. Will test websockets with my test practice code tomorrow.
