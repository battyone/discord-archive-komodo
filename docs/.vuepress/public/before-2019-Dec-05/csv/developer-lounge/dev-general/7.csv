I am trying to implement KMD claim interest button but I am struggeling to find some documentation on how it actually works. 
This issue: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-nano-s/issues/21 is clear to me so ok I know how to get the amount of interest I am eligible to earn from each utxo. I have following qeustions: 
1. Does kmd daemon automatically adds the nlocktime? Or I am supposed to tak the raw hex transaciton and change the last 4 bytes (I believe this is the case)...
2. How does it work? Like who will give me the interest? I suppose somehow the network but how can I tell the network that I want to claim the interest for this specific utxos to that specific vout?

I have skimmed through agama source code and found some referencees in balance.js which calculates the totalinterest and createtx.js which then takes the totalinterest and passes it to transaction builder/creates raw but I still dont see who is signing those txs and where the kmd comes from. Iis it written somewhere else? Thank you for your time";"";"";

So if you receive funds from exchange, the nLockTime is set defaulty by komodod right? I am thinking if I shouldnt be resending funds from my address to the same my address just to make sure the nLockTime is set. What about pools? There the nlockTime is set by default as well right? I just see so many transactions on explorer with locktime = 0 so that makes me wonder why wallets dont just resend the funds to the same address with nlocktime set";"";"";
"208523657398583296";"TheTrunk#1040";"08-Aug-18 12:18 PM";"it also makes it easier to calculate the reward and funds dont just sit but are in circulation which is a neccessity for the reward to be claimable.";"";"";
"208523657398583296";"TheTrunk#1040";"08-Aug-18 12:19 PM";"So if wallets just resend the entire address amount to the same address right after some transaction arrives to that address user will be sure that the entire amount of the address is eligible to claim the amount and not just a portion of transactions";"";"";

Since its less than 10 its not getting rewards, and will be up to the miner to take the coins they've recieved and combine them into +10 KMD utxos";"";"";
