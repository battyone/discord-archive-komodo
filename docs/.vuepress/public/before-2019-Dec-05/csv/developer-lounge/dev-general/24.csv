Both have to come from `komodo-cli help` output otherwise maintaining both src _plus_ external manual edits is more than just cumbersome and sync-hell.

Spreadsheet is a good idea.   The CC testing spreadsheet for example has lots of useful 'future commits' for `komodo-cli help` output.

@gcharang has also found some markdown -> restructured test conversion.  whether they are useful or get in the way yet to be determined, but running 1.sh from https://github.com/imylomylo/mkdocs.sh creates all the markdown in that repo for the difference `komodo-cli help <COMMAND>` outputs.";"";"";
