The danger is that if a trusted node is used to write data to the blockchain, it creates a trust point and a single point of attack. Ultimately there is nothing that can ensure only valid data is written to the blockchain, so what is done is to reinforce good behavior via pay per datapoint. However, for critical data, higher level processing is needed that combines multiple data providers into a validated signal.";"";"";
