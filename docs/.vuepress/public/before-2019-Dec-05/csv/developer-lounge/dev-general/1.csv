P, MySQL but i've ditched a lot of relational stuff in favour of AWS DynamoDB. psql values data integrity like KMD values security.  good for billing systems.

E, enough - plenty of frameworks built on top of express, e.g. sailsjs - others come with handy utilities like data validation (hapijs + Joi) and plenty of docs to implement auth w passport.  No not very familiar with the manual wiring up of it all.  hapijs is out of walmart and scales for all their mobile ecommerce.  Joi is worth a look at to save you debugging time in the future.

R, i never got into react preferring vuejs. i found react too messy and the patent license of facebook a deterrent, i think they have revoked this part since i looked at react.

N, handy.  Check out some of @grewalsatinder  code - he's a beast with nodejs, his use of pm2 is something to learn from.  but like him i have found js backend limiting/annoying.  last i heard he's looking at Golang and i'm more interested in dart/flutter but likely will just stick to vue front end.

I have a hard on for AWS and serverless stuff.

e.g.  https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/imylomylo-acwiz/index.html 

was less than 2 hours of work, and i never have to look at servers and it's within a free tier, even if it was used a million times a week to create ACs.  just needs a cron job to check for submissions to create ACs and viola.

I just checked my laptop for that code, vue + serverless.  it's not in any git, so i'll post later today and i can make a blog post about it if you really want.  i don't use that form library, opting for getting handy with vuetify so styling is material design and i don't have to think about it for https://github.com/imylomylo/komodo-cakeshop";"";"";
