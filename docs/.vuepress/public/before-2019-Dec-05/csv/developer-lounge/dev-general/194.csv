As a species we are incapable of treating ourselves fairly, or even in seeing ourselves fairly. 

Only when we're surrounded by and involved in pure Chaos do we ever approach true fairness.

 100,000 years of evolution and we total suck at manufacturing fairness.

I choose to punt. 

Let's colonize Europa, Mars, and Vega ASAP. 

The universe is but a trough of distractions for humans. 

There's probably some other parallel universe where all the aliens that can actually deal with facts live. They sent us here as a massive distraction to keep us from meddling in the affairs of inter-universal peace.";"";"💯 (1)";
