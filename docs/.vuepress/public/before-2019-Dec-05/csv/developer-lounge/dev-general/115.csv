eos are api docs.  for v1 portal & docs remake, api docs like that are not planned.
marketmaker v1 has api docs like that by ca at http://api.kmd.host/
marketmaker v2 rustdocs i've got artem's instructions for building.  the promise by rust doc is to look like https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/index.html

to make a multi-language api doc, we need multi-language libraries.   currently they are in various stages of development by community members, golang, rust, javascript, python, c++.

tron dev portal is the thing that i'm building, yes it will be nice and focussed, like <link removed>  but with updated content obv. which i'm working on atm.

All the above can be styled similarly at the end of the day.    IBN and doc team were going to be addressing some UX/style in feb.";"";"";

It is all just for my own learning purposes, and as I learn and make notes, I'l share those notes in form of tutorials as I progress.
That's my target 1 - To complete by 15th Feb, 2019.

My target 2 is to learn and create BTC/KMD addresses manually. Already progressing good on that understanding, thanks to 3 things:
- Old links that I have bookmarked from jl777
- btcdsuite/btcutils
- Mastering Bitcoin

If anyone watching kmdgo's repo, I borrowed 3+ package files of go form btcdsuite in it:
- btcec - secp256k1 package for go
- base58
- bech32
and some selected files from btcutils to `kmdutils`, which is part of `kmdgo` package.

Intention is to learn creating addresses, with go in all sorts of ways:
- Using package files - DONE
- Using manually process - In progress
- Wif to other Address types, like KMD Wif to BTC/ZEC address etc
- Agama Passphrase to multi-addresses

Checked your repo - you have separate files for each RPC call.  
I don't know go much so probably it's a noob question: Isn't it possible to unify things as a universal object which sending call body with given arguments / receive JSONs abstracted of what call is it?
Like a in python I've took this module which actually consists of one file:

to interact with RPC creating a connection proxy object and it works with any calls which komodo / bitcoin / zcash or other bitcoin fork daemon supports";"";"";
