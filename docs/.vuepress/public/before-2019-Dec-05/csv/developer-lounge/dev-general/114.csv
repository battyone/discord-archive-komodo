>i mean fixed supply token and then he want to sell that token to raise funds
- On ETH if one project needs raising funds they use smart contract ERC20 to create tokens ""on top of ETH blockchain"", which is dependent on ETH and also subject to any network issues whichever ETH gets in present and future. However it has been widely used, hyped and liked due to their somewhat easiness (I'm not exactly sure if it is actually easy... just heard).
- On Komodo Platform if a project needs raising funds, and wants to have some cryptocurrency, tokens to sell to it's user/client base they instead create their very own blockchain, called Assetchains, and these assetchains has wide variety of options to chose to create all kinds of different economic governed blockchain. For more detailed options please take a look at this link: 
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/create-Komodo-Assetchain.html

Once a project finalized on what assetchains parameters they will use and created their blockchain, they can utilise the Atomic Swaps technology to sell those tokens in an absolute decentralized manner as well as to the wider interoperability options in industry which in my opinion no other project does in industry. You can get some idea by how many different cryptocurrency tokens they can sell tokens to, which I think covers like 90%+ cryptocurrencies in industry.";"";"";
"347922216429813760";"grewalsatinder#9653";"31-Jan-19 10:53 PM";"With ETH it would have mostly just been ETH at first since it being only the ETH on chain token, and if they needed to trade it with BTC or external cryptocurrency, it most probably had to go through some semi-centralized or centralized gateway.

Did I mention Assetchains are absolutely independent blockchains? like Litecoin or Zcash is to Bitcoin. Such independence gives better governance of own blockchain in creating all sort of custom solutions a project wants to.

Crypto-Conditions are not actually equivalent technology to ETH's Smart Contract. Crypto-Conditions (CC) are different and goes far beyond the capabilities what Smart Contracts offers, as with CC a developer can create Core Blockchain Consensus level code with much efficient, ease, security.
Please read through the docs and developer resources to get started, and if you have any questions on Komodo Platform architecture and it's design decisions or anything just ask here. We have many developers and knowledgeable community members around to answer all such questions.";"";"";
