We have some preliminary documentation, as JL777 posted above.

We also have the docs.komodoplatform.com website, but it does not yet have anything regarding the crypto-conditions smart contracts update.

I'm working towards creating a more finished set of documentation for the entire ecosystem -- it's a new-ish endeavor. 

If you would like to provide me with questions and feedback, please do so. I'll be very interested to hear what can make the developer experience better for you.";"";"";

I finally got my computers talking to each other (thank you Nabob, Alright, and Hermes for the help) and mining on a test asset chain.

Both my machines are talking. I added them using the `addnode` command, and used just `onetry` as a parameter.

Curiously, I noticed when I do the RPC `getinfo`, I see three connections, rather than one.

So, I did a `getpeerinfo` rpc call, and I see that my connections have each added tripled with mysterious ports.

Is this normal?

For example, for one machine I'm using local ip address `192.168.1.110`, and the network also added `192.168.1.110:44060` and `192.168.1.110:43812`.

Can anyone help me understand what happened there? Those ports are neither my `rpcport` nor my `p2pport`. They just showed up.";"";"";

Another question in the meantime:

I understand that when you launch a KMD asset chain for the first time (ever, on any machine), you should include all the parameters that you want in the chain.

However, what about later users who join the network? Do you need to include the entire collection of paramters each time you launch a coin to join a network, or if you just use the right ac_name, ac_supply, and a valid node will the KMD daemon figure out all the rest of the details?";"";"";
