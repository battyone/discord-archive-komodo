Yes, weâ€™re considering replacing our ERC20 and were wondering how exactly we would make the payment gateway work if we used Komodo instead of Ethereum. At the moment, weâ€™re just considering and making sure we know all the facts so we can make a more informed decision. 

Essentially, what weâ€™re doing is creating a payment gateway for our coin on our IOS app. A user inputs their address (x) and the number of tokens they are transferring (y) before making a transfer. App then checks if a payment has been received in our wallet (z) by x address with y tokens. If yes, payment is considered successful. 

There is no wallet built into the app. I am not entirely sure how weâ€™re doing this with Ethereum, Maxim would be in a better position to answer that, but I believe weâ€™re using EtherScan APIs. Our question would be if we were using Komodo, what exactly would the process involve and how exactly can we make this work";"";"";
