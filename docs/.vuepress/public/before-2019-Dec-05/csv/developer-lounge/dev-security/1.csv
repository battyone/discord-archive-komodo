Let's say Alice wants to send BTC to Bob and receive ETH in return. My understanding is that Alice initiates the order, and a Bob accepts. Alice sends her deposit, which is 0.15% of the amount of BTC she plans to send. If Alice was malicious, after she sends her deposit, couldn't she sit around for 9 minutes until right before the next block is made on Bitcoin, to see if it is still favorable for her to make the trade (since the price of BTC may have changed by a lot more than 0.15% that she paid as deposit) and if she decides the trade is no longer beneficial to her, just not send her BTC effectively cancelling the trade? sure she would lose her deposit, but it would be a lot less than the amount she may lose on the trade. seems like attackers may try to take advantage of something like this. is this a known issue for atomic swaps? is it addressed by barterDEX?";"";"";
