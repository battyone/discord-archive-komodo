For a cross-shard TX a ""burn"" needs to happen. My understanding is that ""burn"" is an event that happens in a block in the source blockchain (call it chainX). Say the receiving chain is chainY.

Say 90% coalition in chainX creates an invalid chain in chainX that has an invalid block in it far in the past. They then create a block in that chain with an invalid block in which they do the ""burn"" and send such block to the chainY. How would chianY know the chain has an invalid block in it?";"";"";
