OK - what crypto conditions (CC) allows you to do is make custom consensus.  so in the case of DoI-SMS, mine to a CC address (a ""smart contract"" but more powerful because of it's capabilities) and then redistribute based on whatever algorithm you use.

Perhaps the best way to move foward at the moment is:
 - pick any programming language
 - simulate the distribution in a loop (e.g. for loop, while etc.)
 - print out the stats to a file (e.g. csv or json)
 - have a pretty graphs (either using excel, d3 or plotly) to show what actually happens
 - be able to modify the parameters in the loop

This exercise will give you uncomplicated programming practise.

When another programmer can see what is going on, to port it to say C++ would be much easier to collaborate than to try and implement it from just a whitepaper of sorts.

Collaboration is key and so is looking after yourself.   We are all in it for the long game, the debt is just a number - as long as it is managed.  If management of that to you is paying it all out over 3-6 months - great.   If it's a 5 year loan at $50/month, cool.

All the best in the drive etc.";"";"";

Hmmmm I wonder if you are deleted user Calem, cannot mention you.
I remember jl777 saying that the different block reward eras could make and approximate curve.
Verus coin had an interesting launch and block rewards locking feature for the early miners.  Currently BR are 24 and not locked.

I’m not sure the block reward is the place for your DoI-SMS tbh.  Using a crypto condition, it would be able to lock block rewards and redistribute them according to anything you want, over time in portions to the miner, or according to off-chain data oracle-ized shared out (again over time and also cumulatively recalculate this period) like mining pool shares, to spread the distribution or “water down” the concentration of high payout BR to early miners.
