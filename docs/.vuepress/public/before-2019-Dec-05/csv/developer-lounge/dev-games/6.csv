"283395529449406464";"TwilightPunkster K64#7533";"08-Mar-19 03:52 AM";"- don't use games as example that are from Rockstar; they are very hostile towards blockchain gaming and have been a driving force to hold back the industry in blockchain technology adoption. Ubisoft on the other hand, is something different :)
- usage of the Playstation console image is probably going to contradict, because technically speaking, Komodo would breach about five terms of service (there is a NDA regarding Playstation development so I can't be very specific), but if you read the public EULA, a real ""ownership"" of assets on the  console is not going to happen plus there is PSN that is required for distribution of games that would further limit the tech,";"";"";
