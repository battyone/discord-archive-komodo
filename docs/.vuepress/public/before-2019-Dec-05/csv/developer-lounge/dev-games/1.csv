I firmly believe that games will work on the blockchain as well.  Of course we need funding and developers.

There are really good games on NEO and Ethereum already.  We on Komodo have the big advantage of scaling already now.

An example:

I'm a big football (soccer) fan, that's why this example. 
 
A simple football game.  A penalty shootout.  A tournament and everyone pays a small stake in the pool.  The winner of the tournament gets the pool at the end minus small fees.

I was already successful with Flash and HTML5 games.  With game sites and affiliates.  But the blockchain opens new doors for us.

The market is so big!";"";"";

"464378807420452865";"Seko#7408";"22-Oct-18 10:10 AM";"There was once a simple penalty shootout that many fans from Europe played for their club.  It was very simple, but it still worked. 

The name of the game was ‚Äûplay for your club‚Äú.
 
The operator made money with Affiliate.

On the Blockchain you can earn money with fees.  And as an incentive for the game there are rewards, for example if you win.";"";"";
