the best performance is expected from native/core programs, the ones compiles to binary, and that's mostly possible with core languages which are more efficient for this purpose than python.
python fits best for system admin stuff, and clients level code. so a client apps connecting to native code makes sense.";"";"";

- @ashwin made KMD client API package in go.
- Asked if there's anything else he can help Komodo project with any other dev work with his skills
- James asked if he can make a linkable library for Crypto-Conditions in Go language.

The intent is not the have a Go package doing RPC API calls to the CC made in C/C++ in `komodod`, the intent is to make the Go language devs possible to create a CC in Go language, which can be compiled to a library file to link to the komodod code, and used easily.

It is to extend the CC coding devbase to the other languages like Go language.

It might be big task, it I won't say anything to move away from this task to @ashwin 
Instead I highly encourage him to Go for it. Get help from your teachers/professors and from the devs here to understand what is going on under the hood in Komodo code and try to bridge it to Go language dev community.";"";"";

- Calling the C functions from Go code and using them to make further application. It is indeed possible, since Go very much like Rust is friendly to work with C/C++. I am on/off work to move on my Go coding these days, some personal reasons, so just things are slow from my end. I'd love to see this basic thing work as code example. The target for @ashwin can be to us Go language to call Crypto-Conditions specific methods/classes/functions from C/C++ code inside `komodod`. Use that to encrypt/decrypt transaction. I'm still weak in my C/C++ skills, so can't assist much, there are more devs here who can help @ashwin üôÇ 

- The second task would be to make the functions/struct/methods/interfaces etc which are importable/callable in C/C++ code so that even if it makes it possible to  code the half or even the little partial part of the Crypto-Conditions logic in Go language it at least displays what is possible and set some example for others to extend that solution further in the language they understand better.

It has some more automated things like not requiring RPC info from coder and just gets those from the .conf file automatically, and it is extend to be useable by any ecosystem smart chains in KMD ecosystem.

I'd highly suggest you to sync the full node of KMD locally, and just do test each single API with your client package and then make another example go code to display the results in somewhat meaningful way, even just a printf would be fine.";"";"";

I guess you have good help from your teachers, and they can help you there. I just learned much of the Go from online tutorials and moving slow with my learning and coding these days.";"";"";

since C/C++ is still my weaker point I could not go through Komodo code to identify where I need to call things from and what I would need to do which can make me possible to make Go language based CC code.";"";"";

This can be achieved by CGO feature and linking the Komodo dynamic C library to golang library code. Yes C code can be linked directly to Golang code but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend C++. Ive has 5 months of internship experience at Tesla doing this. Ive been writing distributed systems and golang wrappers for C code.";"";"";
