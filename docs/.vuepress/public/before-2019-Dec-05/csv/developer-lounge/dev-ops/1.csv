I'm trying to answer the following questions and open to your input:
- Do we want to use a publicly accessible trello board for managing the tasks related to containerisation: https://trello.com/b/lrL1g3Es
_I'm open to using git project if we have majority suggesting to go with it.
- Which repo would we like to focus on for this work?
- How can we be transparent about the number of hours each of us has each weeks to work on different tasks
- I'm trying to think about the higher level vision of what we want to achieve as part of this exercise. Eg. We want to be able to quickly launch semi baked containers on both local machines for testing and in production on schedulers like k8 or openshift.
- Then, it would be worthwhile to think about what strategy we want to undertake. Eg. Initially, we may just look at the work that @Deleted User and @patchkez did to containerise things and see what's remaining if we were to put that work to use in a new test environment. And we can define tasks from there.

Also, I'm very open to suggestions and changes that can actually help us stay motivated, consistent and get *actual results* - not just for ourselves but for any new person who comes alone for the ride.";"";"";

"347654634199842826";"ns408#8889";"18-Nov-18 11:59 AM";"Why do we need containerisation:

- On komodoplatform, we run a whole range of chains which get compiled, configured and deployed differently. Each of these may have different dependencies and it gets harder to test things *in isoltation* when we deploy all of these on a single server. We  would like to handle this problem through containerisation where self container docker images can be used to launch containers which work exactly the same irrespective of underlying operating system (_and it's version_).
- Compilation takes a while and occasionally we see 3rd party packages being missed. We would like to keep dockerhub images which have compiled version that can just be used without any fuss.
- Local testing on your laptops gets easier because you can just work with a container, make changes and then get it deployed onto your production environment.";"";"";

Yes, that's what - but let's just start with trello and we'll see how things go.

>all coins which are run on NN are containerized. But improvement is needed here. This is up-to-date repo and I run this on my NN https://github.com/patchkez/kmdplatform

Great! We can always improve and even refactor things if needed. Great to have a really good, tested starting point though - thanks to you.

>I made few poor decisions in how I use all containers together, @Deleted User made it better. e.g. I have to re-build iguana image when I want to add new coin
>I made few poor decisions in how I use all containers together, @Deleted User made it better. e.g. I have to re-build iguana image when I want to add new coin

That's cool. We'll learn from it and refactor things to make it better.


>IMHO we should first create plan/vision how our platform should look like, and from that create individual tasks
I have plan already in my head for longer time, I can write it down somewhere and we can discuss it
or what steps do you guys propose?

Absolutely, let's just start populating a few cards. I'm just gonna pop a card on the board so that you can put your plan in there and we can then look at either adding ""docs"" directory in your git repo later.";"";"";
