`To speed things up, the researchers give each new certificate verification information based on a block a few hundred or 1,000 blocks behind it ‚Äî called a ‚Äúbreadcrumb.‚Äù When a new user joins, they match the breadcrumb of an early block to a breadcrumb 1,000 blocks ahead. That breadcrumb can be matched to another breadcrumb 1,000 blocks ahead, and so on.`
