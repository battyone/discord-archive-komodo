Found the bug I suspect that caused it, and made a fix (yet to push to git tho).
I got random stats active on the vis this morning without being tooo late for the day job.  Left it running for about 10 hours, and it seems to be reporting true. 
Will continue to to monitor and tweak until black3joker gets back, and once we switch back from random to real hopefully it will stay that way. 
Noticed my PC at work still failing to load graph due to CORS error despite accessing data on same domain, but added headers to nginx which fixed that over lunch.

Thinking about how to add a simple validation process to be run alongside the main stream to identify issues  (and thier origin) in real time rather than make joker and me lose sleep trying to figure out wtf is going on when it doesnt look right.

Other updates pending (in order of priority) 
-Extra links to more detailed info about the testing (send me links if you have something) - done
-Restoring validated data from previous test runs into graph history
-Aesthitic tweaks after feedback from marketing - ongoing
-""all time high"" tx / pt text (or graph labels)
-video capture of live graph and/or a replay button between user input timeframes
-A review of the 'effects' and metric being used front end

Potential extras down the track
-Something to keep the audience entertained while the timer counts down to the next blast.
-Subtle audio indicator to communicate imminent live blast
-ITTT to push out social media alerts prior to blasts to get more eyes on.";"";"üëç (3)";
