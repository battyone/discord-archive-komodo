Once we have 2 docker images that work perfectly for a single chain, its just a matter of starting X of them.";"";"";

"450158653819846656";"blackjok3r#0000";"27-May-18 10:40 AM";"There is an output from blaster at the end of each loop that gives a TX/s value that it sent to the mempool. The blasters run a fair bit faster than the miners can clear them, so there is a condition after each blast loop that checks if the mempool is under 5mb before running the next loop. I dont have an optimal setup for this yet either, but as long as the mempool is always full thats all that matters really. It took quite a while before it got to a 5MB mempool using 1payment TX/s.";"";"";
"450158653819846656";"blackjok3r#0000";"27-May-18 10:44 AM";"Larger TX (100p) will fill the mempool a lot faster, than small ones (1p). But a single blast node is able to saturate a mempool of a single chain without issues for any TX size. The hardest thing will be starting all the chains at the same time. I might be able to change the block height condition to check for a timestamp instead. That might not be as fool proof though. I dont think it will matter too much if if it slowly ramps up to the maximum, it can pretty much run indefinatly as long as we have disk space for the chains to fit into.";"";"";
