using freq=5 chain to migrate to freq=15 chains is producing results with 0 fails after 24H of sending 1 migrate TX every 120s.

Using 2 chains in their own cluster with freq=15 on both, transfering 1 TX each 120s there is also 0 failed migrate TXs. These chains are both sending back and fourth to each other 1 coin each 120s. 

I will leave this test running for a few more days, to make sure, but this seems to confirm @jl777c's theory that MoMoM issues are due to too fast notarisation frequecny. This has implications, but if this makes it work, we will next try a freq of 10, as this is the default for KMD chains. Also we need to try and see how many chains can be added to a cluster before the issue appears. My guess is that it probably wont, cause any issues adding more chains,as it seems to be an issue with the freq on the receiving chain only.";"";"üëç (3),üéØ (1)";
