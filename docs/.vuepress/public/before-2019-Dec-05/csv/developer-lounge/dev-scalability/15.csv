`US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)` or `US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)` where EKS service is available.
So it is like 1$ per hour for 3 instances, maybe we need to test 7 days (not full 24 hours per day, once we are done with testing for the day we can stop instance in order to not be charged). So it is like 84$ for instances. 
We will use Amazon EKS (managed Kubernetes Service), Amazon Elastic Block store.

i want to ""DoS"" the api for blocknotify to hit and simulate the load for dynamodb.

doing 1000 writes/s, the 'monthly' cost is $483. ($17/day)
doing 5000 writes/s, monthly cost is $2420 ($80/day)


Reads cost only 20% of writes, wouldn't need more than 10 reads/s tbh....so $2/month

If a docker image can be created and 8192 containers fired up over a few servers to fire off a curl command all within 10 seconds or so (passing in an env variable to POST to DynamoDB) should be able to work out DynamoDB costs.";"";"";
