Asicminer.co ASICminer Zeon a big fat piece of garbage for 20k! LOL (ripoff)

Bittmain Z9 and Z9 Mini. What i have to say about bitmain?! now you have to make KYC to buy hardware LOL!


everyone can go in a store and buy a gpu and be part of the network. i think you guys need the big amout of hashes. or payed by these companys.

nowadays decentralised is not important anymore. hope you guys didnt get burned by a 51% attack by these nice asics machines.
