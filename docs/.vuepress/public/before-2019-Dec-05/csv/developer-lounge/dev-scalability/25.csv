As it was I needed to put in the mining pause to fill the mempool for single payment tx, if your not going for full blocks, then it will work fine, you can start a shit load of containers on a very small system, until the chains are of decent length they don't even need much ram.";"";"";

AWS support came to us and provided some ideas how to fix the problem I was facing. Unfortunately I could not make it working. Partial problem was old kubectl binary I was using.
