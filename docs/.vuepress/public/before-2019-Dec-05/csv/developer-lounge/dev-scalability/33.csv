If my customers are on multiple different chains and I want to accept their payments, my options are they burn their coins from their chains when sending to the chain I'm on (which I'm assuming is slower than same chain transactions, correct me if I'm wrong about this), or if I need faster times, I treat each chain as the independent chain they are, and create an address on each chain, simplest way is to use the same keys to make the same address I have posted at my shop. 

Now I have the same address on multiple different independent chains, and need to pay my employees or buy things, if I have my sales spread out on different chains and need to make a single payment that requires me to combine them, for example sending to an employee, supplier, etc who is only on one chain. Is the method I use to do this burning the coins from the multiple chains to get it to the address that's only on one chain? 

I'm not sure if that clarifies what I'm asking?";"";"";
