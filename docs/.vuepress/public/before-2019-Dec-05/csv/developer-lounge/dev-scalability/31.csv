But because I activly tried to break it like I usually do i was able to track it down, and tabulate the data so it cna be fixed.

Trying to understand everything in the whitepaper is quite daunting and I would like to be as accurate as possible for the infographic I'm working on. Anyways here goes. 
```
Question 1

From the website

""Komodo’s notary nodes create a new Merkle Tree out of all the Merkle Roots that have been generated since the previous notarization. This happens for each assetchain in the Komodo ecosystem utilising the Federated Multi-Chain Syncing feature.”


Question: Is the main KMD chain considered an assetchain in this case, thus creating and including its own MoM with the rest of the Assetchain MoMs? (as part of the syncing and MoMoM creation)
```";"";"";
"197075883519901698";"MoldyLunchbox#5734";"27-Sep-18 05:15 PM";"```
IF THE ANSWER IS NO (I'm beginning to think the answer will be no)


Question 2-A


From the website

""Once all the MoMs have been synced with the KMD chain, they are organized into yet another Merkle Tree.""


If the KMD chain is not considered an assetchain and does not create its own MoM as part of the syncing process, is it safe to say that ultimately, the MoMoM is the Merkel Root of the KMD block itself, every 10 minutes

```";"";"";
"197075883519901698";"MoldyLunchbox#5734";"27-Sep-18 05:16 PM";"```IF THE ANSWER IS YES


Question 2-B


From the website

""Next, Komodo’s notary nodes take the MoM from each assetchain and sync them all with the KMD chain.""


If the KMD chain does create its own MoM, does it do so before or after the assetchain MoMs sync to the KMD chain?


Clarification 1: If KMD creates its MoM before the sync, does this mean it stores its own save-state into itself?

Clarification 2: if KMD creates its MoM after the sync, does this mean this particular MoM includes all all the other assetchain MoMs within it?

```";"";"";
"197075883519901698";"MoldyLunchbox#5734";"27-Sep-18 05:17 PM";"```Question 3


From the website

""The fourth and final step in Komodo’s scaling solution process is to notarize the MoMoM back onto every assetchain in the ecosystem.""


Is the MoMoM sent to the very next block of every assetchain right after the last snapshot?



Question 4


From the website

""Every ten minutes, a snapshot is taken of the entire Komodo ecosystem. Then, this snapshot is written into a block on the Bitcoin blockchain.""


Is it safe to say that this snapshot is the MoMoM?



Question 5


From the website

""Re-Notarize Back Onto The Komodo Blockchain – After the backup has been created on the secondary blockchain, the location of the backup is then written back into Komodo’s main blockchain.""


Is the ""location of the backup"" sent to the very next block in the KMD chain right after the last snapshot (the block with the MoMoM)?

   @MoldyLunchbox thanks for your interest.  I think here is an answer to Q3,4,5.

This 👆 output is from an assetchain that notarizes to KMD.
NN's do this:
AC -> KMD 
KMD -> AC
Whether it is the ""very next block"" or not,  doesn't sound likely because it's not something that can be guaranteed.  From the output of `getinfo` you can see there is the last notarization and last MoM info in there.

From the notarized block, to the current block is the ""lag"" or _number of blocks since notarization_

KMD notarizes to BTC.  That's where the checkpoint/save-state is.  I don't think KMD does a MoM of itself, it has the BTC notarization and lag of it's own.    (Someone will correct me if i'm wrong soon no doubt) 😃";"";"";
