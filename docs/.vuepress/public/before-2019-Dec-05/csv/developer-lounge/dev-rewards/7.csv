here's why:
1.  I create some code like a front end to marketmaker.
2. i put an MIT derived license on it, calling it the _dont-be-a-dick_ license.
3. in the license, i put names of the dicks that cannot use this software in any capacity, open source, proprietary, network program, software as a service.
4. some equally dickish group picks up on the dont-be-a-dick license, does a little digging then finds out where these dicks work or their businesses.

you can't work with open source and be a dick. the code is more powerful than the dick.  the only dicks allowed are sociopath ceos of multinationals.  but these dicks do evil things, much more evil that what has happened in this channel.
