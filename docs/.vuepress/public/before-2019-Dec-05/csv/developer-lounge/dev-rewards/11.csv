Any code that doesn’t specify a license is automatically considered ""all rights reserved"" by its author. You could technically assert your copyright at any time in the future and demand people stop using it. So not including a license is actually more likely to stop people using it than encourage use.

If you cba to think about it and don't really care I'd recommend the MIT license. That's what Bitcoin/Zcash/Komodo use and it's what I use for all my projects.

It basically means you waive all rights to the code, anyone can use it for anything without asking you for permission. The only requirement is that they provide attribution to you (normally by distributing the license file with you name in inside their work).";"";"";
