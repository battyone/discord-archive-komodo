"360402743543988225";"lukechilds#2707";"28-Nov-18 11:51 AM";"Requiring nLockTime to be set is a pain because many wallets donâ€™t support setting it. So even if you send your funds to a wallet using nLockTime, any transactions you make which return change will not have nLockTime set meaning you lose the ability to claim rewards on all your change UTXOs. This could reasonably be a large amount of your balance.

Being able to claim rewards without needing nLockTime set would resolve this and allow you to claim rewards on change UTXOs and other UTXOs created by non nLockTime supported wallets.

It also has the added benefit that all the transactions not using nLockTime from users who arenâ€™t interested in claiming rewards (e.g exchanges) would automatically have rewards available. These users would likely not claim them meaning the rewards would then go to miners, increasing mining profitability.";"";"";
"360402743543988225";"lukechilds#2707";"28-Nov-18 11:51 AM";"My proposal would be:

Instead of calculating the reward period as (latest block time - nLockTime), calculate the reward period as (latest block time - UTXO block time). This can be implement as a soft fork.

One downside would be that itâ€™s common practise for people to set nLockTime slightly in the past (often 777 seconds). This would mean that people calculating rewards using the nLockTime way would be invalid because the reward period theyâ€™d calculate would be slightly longer (e.g 777 seconds longer than tip to tip accounting for the extra nLockTime) than the consensus rules and so would be rejected.

So its a soft fork, it wonâ€™t cause a chain split. But it would cause people using the old reward logic to get their reward claim transactions rejected. If they used the new logic, everything would work as expected.

However there is a way to also allow the old reward claiming logic to validate against the new rules. nLockTime is limited to one hour in the past. So instead of calculating the reward period as (latest block time - UTXO block time) we calculate it as (latest block time - UTXO block time - 1 hour). Adding this extra hour accounts for all possible nLockTime sizes so people claiming with the old nLockTime based logic would always be inside the allowed reward period.

As you mentioned, the only difference is performance.

With the current method, we need to lookup latest block time.
With the non nLockTime method youâ€™d need to lookup latest block time and UTXO block time.

I think the benefits are pretty huge, but I have no idea how much that extra block lookup would hurt performance.

How much of a difference would that make? Would it be completely infeasible?";"";"";

It also seems like it's quite common in the Komodo community (encouraged by Agama, BarterDEX) to just have a single address that is re-used for incoming/change transactions and then use a Z address for privacy. Reusing a single address for everything has even less rpivacy than using seperate BIP44 addresses and occasionally consolidating them.";"";"";

the pros are:
- preserves anonymity slighly, all account UTXOs aren't consolidated into a single transaction, it was one TX for 1 address
the cons are:
- requires a seperate TX per address. This is quite a huge pain for the user. Each TX need to be signed on the Ledger device, which is slow, and manually approved by clicking buttons on the Ledger. If they have been using the account for a long time it could have hundreds of UTXOs. This would involve manually verifying and physically clicking the button on the device hundreds of times.
- it isn't actually that much more private than my previous proposal. All addresses in the accounts will probably be claimed very close together and would quite likely make it into the same block. So although they aren't linked in the same TX, it would be quite obvious if you see a block with a large amount of reward claims going from one address to another in the same block that they are all from the same person.";"";"";
