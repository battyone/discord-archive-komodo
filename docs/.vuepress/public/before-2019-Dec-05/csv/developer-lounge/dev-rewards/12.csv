Also there is no PR submitted by Magnum regarding to overwinter support as you claim: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc

And the current overwinter branch has no one's work in it apart from the Ledger CTOs and my own: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/compare/zcash_sapling";"";"";

That means that we'll have it first, before Zcash?
```

Zcash and Komodo share the same codebase. Once they have overwinter/sapling support working they'll likely roll it out to both coins at the same time";"";"";
