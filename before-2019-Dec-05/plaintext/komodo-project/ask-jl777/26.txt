Seperation... Also if the private key for a KMD notary node  is imported into a thrid party coin, they could get the KMD notary node keys... and that would be game over if they were a bad actor, or were over taken by a bad actor.

[01-Oct-18 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Using a seperate keys solves this, BUT likley all 3rd party coins wouls till use the same key.

[01-Oct-18 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If a project wanted ultimate security they would need their own nodes.

There is no reason to have to have 64 of them though, you could use less to save on costs. Also just notarizing one coin to KMD, is very lean on resource.

We are easily doing 10 coins on STAKED with 4 thread, 8GB RAM VPS on VULTR.

[01-Oct-18 03:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So for a single coin, you could use somehting very small... as long as you have enough ram/swap to build the coins deamons and sync the chain. Iguana itself is very low on recource, only RAM and SSD is required.

[01-Oct-18 03:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well yes and no... You would likely need a single perso to be trained up, but the STAKED stuff is extremly easy to use, not having to worry about updates for extra coins etc.... its almsot a set and forget thing, with some kind of notification if out of utxo, or iguana stopped working, login and restart it or send some funds. thats just about it.

[01-Oct-18 06:34 AM] Mylo#8306
@joey thanks for dropping by for discussion üòÉ 

Running your own notaries as per #private-staked may be an option, it increases delay to btc level security if notarizing to kmd is a step involved as well (which I still recommend).  On one hand running your own notaries could be viewed as ‚Äúcentralized‚Äù without a similar voting process etc. but that would be something for FLO ecosystem to work out.  Each app could run some servers, as more apps use FLO, more nodes.  Keep in mind 64 nodes connecting to each other is 4k connections, more would be a new set of problems.

The dPoW has no interference w the apps reward systems on FLO.  If offering the users an opportunity to participate in security, what level of participation?  NNs mark checkpoints in a very expensive system.  FLO users would participate in the NN process, it would be completely insecure for your node to not be operated by a v.small team of trusted ppl.

Further, once engaged in the Komodo community, getting votes from creating ecosystem collaboration would be something the community looks for.  The notary voting is open to anyone, it is a friendly competitive and collaborative effort once elected, but certainly not something that can really be expected to be involved with, with no prior Komodo collaboration or input as there is no history that would appeal to community voters.

Either way, if you‚Äôve got ideas with DEX and the rest of the tech, might see you around more in the future üëç

A coin could run their own notaries, but there is *a lot* of work in getting that setup. They'd need to consider the server costs, man hours of maintaining each, maintaining the network itself, cost of notarization itself, politics behind who can/can't be a notary, how to incentivize notaries to have good up time and not collude

[01-Oct-18 07:46 AM] Alright#0419
none of that sounds that bad until you start doing, trust me üòÇ

[01-Oct-18 07:48 AM] Alright#0419
it'd be a good solution for trusted setups, but keeping it more decentralized than KMD's notaries is close to impossible

[01-Oct-18 07:49 AM] Alright#0419
I have a crazy amount of respect for whoever setup the initial network. Was a *very* hard task

[01-Oct-18 07:59 AM] Alright#0419
@jl777c is there a technical reason why ac_perc coinbases must have pubkey vouts as opposed to pubkeyhash vouts?

[01-Oct-18 07:59 AM] Alright#0419
I know you may have answered that before, but I can't seem to recall why it's a requirement

[01-Oct-18 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it can be added to the check of the consensus rules. since it is a more permissive thing it would be a hardfork

[01-Oct-18 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
but since there is no production -ac_perc chain I can make the change

[01-Oct-18 08:09 AM] Alright#0419
would really appreciate that, thanks. May be using it for STAKED's main chain to pay notaries

[01-Oct-18 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
if any other changes desired for ac_perc, now is the time to ask

[01-Oct-18 08:13 AM] Alright#0419
someone had asked if it's possible to do different %s for block rewards and transactions. I don't think I'd do anything with it, but that'd allow a founder's reward-esque setup

[01-Oct-18 08:14 AM] Alright#0419
Think that was sidd

[01-Oct-18 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah it was sidd

[01-Oct-18 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have thaught of ac_perc as a good way to fund notaries, it doesnt fund the KMD part, but it can be used to fund the coins being notarised.

[01-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
actually, I think that would be useful for staked, If we could do essentially just a founders reward that pays out notaries

[01-Oct-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
however in its current form it requires one trusted entity to pay the noaties from the address.

[01-Oct-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as the utxo's went all dust though, that could be an isue

[01-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
instead of using ac_perc how it currently works, and having unpredictable inflation rates

[01-Oct-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah having it only for block rewards is a pretty good idea.

[01-Oct-18 08:22 AM] Alright#0419
This has me thinking, we may be able to just set a pubkey of a multisig address between all the notaries ü§î

[01-Oct-18 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it can be changed it so the address is specified instead of pubkey, also a mutually exclusive mode of founders reward wont be hard to do

[01-Oct-18 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD has all the tech that is needed as with CC, the consensus rules can be enhanced. so the question is what new tech belongs in a new CC

For some time now wanted to ask JL777 a question. Was the decision of KMD apr cap switched from yearly to monthly yours? Or were there some kind of public vote implemented. I mean, that's a major change to the blockchain protocol. For me personally that made a lot of complications. I keep everything paper-wallet style. It's now a monthly headache for me with generating new addresses, printing, resyncing, deleting and all that long time consuming stuff I was hoping to avoid with KMD. I do what I need to do, I understand, but was that decision voted? Thanks.

[02-Oct-18 04:44 AM] CHMEX#0686
The reason was that this reward should be given to people who make an effort and help KMD.
More transactions on the network increase the value of the network -> increase in price and more z transactions increase the privacy.
On the possitive side this new 31 Days cap forces you to get 5.11% Rewads per years and not 'only' 5%
So it is possible ( not to say this will happen any time soon or ever ) that in the future maybe you will only get rewards if you participate in a z transaction.
As all the Notary Nodes Updated to the new code base, the decision was accepted by them.

[02-Oct-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh, the 1 million block update also removed the free for all, which made running anotary node much easier, so we kind of had to accept the rewards change aswell. üòï

[02-Oct-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not that i think its a bad thing.

[02-Oct-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I like the change personally.

[02-Oct-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It stops whales just buying and holding and getting more coins than active users.

[02-Oct-18 11:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
@noon e FYI if you have UTXOs from before block 1M, they earn interest from pre-block-1M rules, i.e. no 31 day cap

Hi @jl777c  Is there a plan for Komodo to get more community adoption and subsequently end-user adoption? 

For the former, I feel that VeChain have masternodes and x-nodes who can join in on the community ICO round (prior to public round). So it's  not just private VC vs public fundraising. 

For the latter, it is based on the assumption that ICO/dICO is a good way to get more use cases and users onto the Komodo platform by way of the coins/token gamification or incentives and dApps.

[05-Oct-18 10:12 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Fai, I'm sure others will be along to answer your question soon.
Have you had a look through #komodo-team, #team-business-dev , #feed-news, etc channels?  I think you'll find a great deal of information there and give a good idea of what's happening regarding end-user adoption.

they are pretty ignorant of how things work: "Furthermore, sharp spikes in Bitcoin prices can also hurt Komodo users by raising their cost of doing business. Ironically, that means that when the general crypto market is doing well, Komodo users will suffer, creating a damping effect on Komodo pricing."

[05-Oct-18 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC price has no effect on KMD operations, we raised the BTC needed for notarization in the ICO

that article is flawed in so many ways, it is not worth the time to list all the problems. in any case, price behavior of all the altcoins are down against BTC due to BTC market dominance at yearly highs, combined with bear market. KMD has actually gained CMC ranking over the last months

[05-Oct-18 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810

>based on a vulnerability in the code that the Komodo team was aware of but did not patch. While, as with many such things, it is difficult to separate truth from conjecture in this case, leaving vulnerabilities in your code to exploit against competitors is likely to leave many developers cautious about working with Komodo.

Almost all of komodo's security patches are block height triggers. SAFE didn't bother to change any of these. When they launched they had all of the security holes that ever existed in KMD.

@jl777c I am seeking a small bit of advice. I have little to no, programming experience. But I do have a good foundation in computer networking & security--enough to pass a Cisco CCNA cert exam. And, at the moment, I'm spending most of my time in the Verus discord. However I do recognize most all of the Komodo dev team, from researching various cryptocurrencies--or probably just because you are one hell of a talented group of guys--and you tend to value privacy. I am different. I appreciate the developers.
So,  I want to get into programming and, for some odd reason, I want to work with crypto wallets--desktop & mobile. I really enjoy crypto & I was lucky to read the BTC white paper in '11 & I agree with the core argument of the right to individual privacy and the right for financial fair play, at any level. 
Like I mentioned, I'm very happy to be a part of the Verus community & to see what Mike Tout., and the Verus dev team has accomplished, so far. I'm sure that between Komodo and Verus-- you'll probably find the most talented group of developers, in all of cryptocurrency. So for me, to spend time in the Verus discord and Komodo discord, and to read some of the work you guys are doing in Pirate channel in the Komodo channel or Staked, I think it is lol--it made me think what a waste it would be to just not ask, for a piece of advice. Because I want to be involved in cryptocurrency, on the developing side. 

In as short or as long, as you want to answer--what do you think would be the best first step to take? I did jump right into networking & that worked out. But I also understand that a good first step into anything, is so beneficial. I understand that guys ask questions like this, all of the time, and they probably bullshit 99 percent of the time. If you don't have time to answer, it's not a big deal, I don't take it personal. My plan, as of now, is to start with C, and spending time in the Verus GitHub--trying to look and pick up on, what I can.

Thats the best way. I learnt most of my skills but just reading code, then trying to break said code, until i understood how it works. You will find things that nobdy else thaught of looking for. Because they read documentation and followed instructions. Those things help, but ignoring them and just trying things by trial and error are far more productive, if you want to undestand the how and why something works, not just how to use it.

now, once you are able to test effectively. then coding becomes much easier as you are always thinking what sorts of bugs will this have, how can i find them and isolate them, while you are coding. And you dont bother coding something that cant be tested, saving a lot of wasted time. so many devs have no clue about testing they release code that just cant be debugged
