Which email service do you use jl?

[19-Sep-18 03:13 AM] Hegelian#0018
Also, and I'm sorry this is offtopic, but which brands of laptop do you think are good? I use a HP spectre and considering an LG gram or the Samsungs

[19-Sep-18 03:14 AM] Hegelian#0018
I just look at whatever the "topline" model is of the various brands but it's hard for me to differentiate which is more solid and reliable. The price is all about the same and the specs as well

[19-Sep-18 03:15 AM] Hegelian#0018
Or do you not care about brand and just get whatever has the proper specs for what you need?

[19-Sep-18 03:42 AM] Hegelian#0018
Sorry. Wasnt as interested in what he himself uses just if he thinks there are certain brands that are more solid

@Hegelian James will never tell you anything specific about his personal life, hardware or software he uses. is he AI, his previous experience, how many he is, and all these non essential questions I have being reading for many years. Please imagine he is very smart multitasking guy (khmm) who is willing very much! to stay anonymous. That's it. No leads. You can check all his post from 2013 or so. Nothing.                                   
   PS> Not a fan, I just don't remember seeing anything like that.

[19-Sep-18 04:35 AM] Hegelian#0018
I was not looking for any leads or prying into his life

[19-Sep-18 04:35 AM] Hegelian#0018
I was asking if there are any brand of laptop I should avoid

[19-Sep-18 04:35 AM] Hegelian#0018
Or any brand he thinks are particularly good

[19-Sep-18 04:39 AM] BigCat45#4982
nope, not happening

[19-Sep-18 04:41 AM] Hegelian#0018
Asking someone who codes if there is a brand of computer they would avoid or recommend is not prying into someone's life. But it is offtopic. And I already got an answer so its doesnt matter and there is no need to continue this discussion

[19-Sep-18 04:42 AM] Hegelian#0018
The answer was he uses an old computer so it's safe to assume brand does not matter

[19-Sep-18 04:42 AM] BigCat45#4982

I've been reading about the Komodo CryptoConditions. Congratulations! It looks to me like a very powerful technology. My question, which I've not found answered in any of the current texts, is: How a zk-snark transactions can be used with UTXO based smart contracts? Is there any way with the current implementation?

[20-Sep-18 09:21 AM] d3n#0940
Of course I'm thinking on privacy powered Voting system. For such thing we need mainly:
+ A way to sign claims (like address X is able to vote). This might be achieved by just adding a signed claim to a blockchain  block
+ A way to create a temporary assetchain. This seems that can be avhieved using CryptoConditions
+ A way to use this temporary assetchain tokens from a Zk-snark transactions which will have the voting option encapsuled in MeMo field

[20-Sep-18 09:23 AM] d3n#0940
Oh sorry, I did not see there is an specific channel for crypto conditions, I'll ask there.

[20-Sep-18 04:16 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
does Komodo, under its excellent dPoW use a 'normal' PoW as well (like 10 minutes before the dPoW)?

[20-Sep-18 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[20-Sep-18 04:18 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493

[21-Sep-18 06:29 AM] Mylo#8306
Is channels specific to KMD/AC or is it theoretically possible to use pegged/gateways to use channels with external coins?

[21-Sep-18 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
currently channels CC only supports the native coin for the chain. however with my tokenconvert trick, it might be possible to channel send tokens

Can patreon.com be replicated via cc? It needs an address1 for the creator which will receive payments in regular intervals(1 month/1 week) and address2 for each donor that will hold funds to be sent to all the creators the donor wishes

Also oracle cc can be used to replicate the pay per video/music/blog post produced model

[21-Sep-18 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
need to have a bit more clarity on what the rules are but it seems close to what I have in mind for payments CC

[21-Sep-18 10:45 AM] gcharang#6833
Model1: Content creator posts address ---> Donor will tell his dapp send this creator 1 KMD every month

Model2: Content creator posts address + somehow notifies the that he has produced a new  video --> Donor tells his dapp to send the creator 10 KMD for each video produced

these are what are happening at a high level

[21-Sep-18 10:46 AM] gcharang#6833
Donor has the ability to stop this donation any time

[21-Sep-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
oracles CC kind of does this already. donors prepay for content, content providers receive payment when data is posted

[21-Sep-18 10:47 AM] gcharang#6833
Yes oracles cc does model 2
I was thinking about model 1

[21-Sep-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, payments CC will do something similar to that

I see similar behaviour from brc core in terms of backwards api compatibility which we had with nxt.
In your opinion could this be an issue for dPoW somehow? I know we make it with custom raw tx, but still I wonder at what level we may have issues with btc core, if any.

Hello! I have a simple question that might appear pointless, but I must know the answer to.
Is JL777 obsessed with reptiles? I'm asking as an amateur myself. I love the Komodo project and the reptile references are really fun.

[24-Sep-18 06:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
being in this community for so long and have many interactions with jl777 during this time, I'd say the reptile names isn't an obsession.

[24-Sep-18 06:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it all started with a project evolving to new iteration/version and naming it to "iguana"

[24-Sep-18 06:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
we did not had any official cryptocurrency which was made by jl777, there was NXT that jl777 made project on top of, and there was BTCD, which was created by another developer and jl777 joined him help this coin.

[24-Sep-18 06:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Komodo got many technologies jl777 built in "iguana" and it's earlier codebase versions which derived from MultiGateway tech and it's related required parts of evolving code and various different ideas.

[24-Sep-18 06:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and since Komodo was from lizard family, the project's sub features also got names from the same theme

[24-Sep-18 06:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
like Basilisk, Agama, etc.

[24-Sep-18 07:10 PM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
I see. Thank you.

[25-Sep-18 10:08 PM] Regnar#6164
hey jl777 just wondering what're your thoughts on alternative mining algorithms? Obviously PoW is proving to be solid and mixed with dPoW is even better. But I'm curious on what you think Komodo providing additional mining algorithms to be available for KMD ACs (already have PoS and hybrid, as well as MN using nlocktime).

[25-Sep-18 10:11 PM] jl777c#5810
support for other hashing algo will come with verus pull request

[25-Sep-18 10:15 PM] Regnar#6164
You mean the VerusHash algorithm?

[25-Sep-18 10:16 PM] jl777c#5810
specifically, but it adds support for changing of hashalgo

[25-Sep-18 10:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the first one is always the most work, adding a second, third, should be much simpler to do

[25-Sep-18 10:17 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont think many appreciate just how much new territory VRSC has achieved

[25-Sep-18 10:22 PM] Regnar#6164
It's definitely impressive, and the most recent spotlight did a great job showing that. But that makes a lot of sense, changing the algorithm becomes easier after the first time. I was reading about that solar-powered transaction using shortwave radio waves on the Burst blockchain and remember reading a couple years ago about their Proof of Capacity and was curious if those drastically different consensus mechanisms could eventually be available.

[25-Sep-18 10:23 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as the hashalgo is in C/C++, it would be possible to add, really not much interaction with anything else, so it is a relatively safe and easy change to make to consensus. that is why you see a lot of coins where all they change is the hashalgo

[25-Sep-18 10:27 PM] Regnar#6164
Cool, I assumed dPoW could still be a viable option for these non-PoW coins, like PoC, as it's storing the hash of their chain, but would probably need some additional aspect to prevent reversing transactions (not too fluent on PoC). It seemed that PoC could be susceptible to genesis attack.

[25-Sep-18 10:31 PM] jl777c#5810
anything with 256byte blockhash can be dPoW'ed

[25-Sep-18 10:37 PM] Regnar#6164
Cool, good to know, pretty sure their project came from NXT, anyway seemed like a cool algorithm to eventually add to the KMD AC options, seeing as it's based on open disk space and external hard drives are getting bigger and cheaper (5TB is like 110KMD). Thanks for the info

[26-Sep-18 01:00 AM] MeEGaA#2222
Hello

[26-Sep-18 05:59 AM] djay#5234
I wanted to ask about jumblr, how secure is that against blockchain analysis, I understand that blocks are processed at the same hour for everybody but example if I will run 20k KMD through Jumblr from wallet A - it will do the shufling and even if I break it down into 20 or more wallets I will end up having 1K of komodo each but than if I will exchange all those into BTC the wallets will be linked together the alltogether value can be calculated and it's obvious that it was my wallet that shuffled 20k of KMD especially if Jumblr doesn't have any other activity

[26-Sep-18 06:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
@djay  im no expert on this, but just use different wallets on komodos barterDEX, or just use a few different exchanges withdrawing to different wallets, and youll have like 1btc here, 1.4553 there, 2,2424 in another

[26-Sep-18 06:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
nothing will link those btc wallets together

[26-Sep-18 06:47 AM] djay#5234
I think there is no or very few people using jumblr isn't that a point of failure ?

[26-Sep-18 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
yes until there is more JUMBLR usage, external analysis is possible. PIRATE aims to solve this by dramatically increasing the ztransaction activity within KMD

[26-Sep-18 09:07 AM] sœÜldat#8733
pirate and pex, can't it harm jumblr's activity and utility?

[26-Sep-18 09:20 AM] sœÜldat#8733
Or jumblr mechanism will be directly implemented in pex for KMD ? It's not clear in my mind

[26-Sep-18 09:22 AM] SHossain#0007
You can use JUMBLR only using Komodo native mode. Other coins or assetchain doesn't have this tech.

[26-Sep-18 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
@sœÜldat my prediction is that PIRATE and pex (especially) will dramatically increase KMD zaddr usage

[26-Sep-18 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
which in turn should create a critical mass of ztx within KMD to enable JUMBLR to be much more effective

[26-Sep-18 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
since zaddr is required for PIRATE, it will force anybody that wants to buy PIRATE to make KMD zaddr

[26-Sep-18 10:01 AM] sœÜldat#8733
it's clear now, thanks
