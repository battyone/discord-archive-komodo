It's not a nation state, it's just a little canton in Switzerland

[15-Jun-18 08:00 PM] Ludom#5832
We have good support from them already

[15-Jun-18 08:01 PM] Ludom#5832
The State gives us 3000 CHF for the Komodo Meetup

[15-Jun-18 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
we can certainly accomodate a friendly jurisdiction, i will ad to my todo list

[15-Jun-18 08:03 PM] Ludom#5832
They are triing to pay the subvention with Bitcoin

[15-Jun-18 08:03 PM] Ludom#5832
Because Ind√©Nodes don't have any Bank account

[15-Jun-18 08:03 PM] Ludom#5832
üòÑ

[15-Jun-18 08:04 PM] Ludom#5832
But it's complicate for them for legal reasons

[15-Jun-18 08:04 PM] Ludom#5832
And the accounting service is lazy

[15-Jun-18 08:06 PM] Ludom#5832
The old world takes time to change

[15-Jun-18 08:07 PM] Ludom#5832
But it'll change if we help them and give them the tools

[15-Jun-18 08:09 PM] Ludom#5832
We experiment decentralization in crypto world for years

[15-Jun-18 08:09 PM] Ludom#5832
But the non crypto world want to experiment themself too.

[15-Jun-18 08:10 PM] Ludom#5832
They can't trust totaly our own experience becaus "you know, our reality is not the same"

[15-Jun-18 08:11 PM] Ludom#5832
But it's very important to let's them have a try. Perhaps they'll fail as lot of crypto projects fails in the past

[15-Jun-18 08:12 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@Ludom  for blockchains / public leadger I believe full anonimity is needed. See - in bank account no one publicly sees how much money you own. If BTC your addresses can be linked and you can be in danger if you got enough money.

[15-Jun-18 08:13 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Imagine you pay with your BTC somwhere and the guy is linking your payments and wallets / analitical tools, and checks if make sense to rob you.

[15-Jun-18 08:13 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
With bank account he cant do this - not public.

[15-Jun-18 08:13 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
From what I understand Zcash is protecting you

[15-Jun-18 08:13 PM] Ludom#5832
I don't speak about a project that will be about anonymity and wealth holding

[15-Jun-18 08:14 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
The only "problem" may be it's protecting you even from official check üòÉ So also gov, which they may not like.

[15-Jun-18 08:14 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
However BTC  not being anon is a dangerous thing for regular user

[15-Jun-18 08:14 PM] Ludom#5832
If you want anonymity you can have it anyway

[15-Jun-18 08:14 PM] Ludom#5832
You swap your coins with KMD and that's it

[15-Jun-18 08:15 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
ok

[15-Jun-18 08:15 PM] Ludom#5832
Speaking with politic is different as writing on a slack

[15-Jun-18 08:15 PM] Ludom#5832
or discord üòâ

[15-Jun-18 08:16 PM] Ludom#5832
Most of people in crypto don't have to be accountable

[15-Jun-18 08:17 PM] Ludom#5832
They play their own money and they are not elected publicly as a politician is

[15-Jun-18 08:19 PM] Ludom#5832
I really think that anonymity is a good thing to propose

[15-Jun-18 08:19 PM] Ludom#5832
I personnally don't care about it because I actually don't need it

[15-Jun-18 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it helps them get contributions privately

[15-Jun-18 08:20 PM] Ludom#5832
But who know that some day I'll need anonymity to protect myself, I'll be happy to have an easy solution for that

[15-Jun-18 08:21 PM] Ludom#5832
I think if Satoshi made Bitcoin totally anon as  Zcash it wouldn't be a success

[15-Jun-18 08:21 PM] noashh#2802
@elPataDeLana yes, I will create a link to matrix

[15-Jun-18 08:21 PM] Ludom#5832
Because trust is a building

[15-Jun-18 08:22 PM] Ludom#5832
Bitcoin transparency was a first step to trust in the blockchain

[15-Jun-18 08:23 PM] Ludom#5832
The anon coin are a second level

[15-Jun-18 08:23 PM] Ludom#5832
Smart contract are a new level too

[15-Jun-18 08:24 PM] Ludom#5832
And when I speak with autorities (political or economic), they are on the ground zero of trust.

[15-Jun-18 08:24 PM] Ludom#5832
They need to understand things by themself and you can't propose something to complex for the beginning

[15-Jun-18 08:25 PM] Ludom#5832
And something that doesn't change too much their thinking model

[15-Jun-18 08:26 PM] Ludom#5832
Anonymity is a big big step

[15-Jun-18 08:29 PM] Ludom#5832
The common world is not like matrix : if you propose the blue or red pills, the people are feared and take the blue one

Hi jl777, I would like to ask which coins you currently find interesting besides KMD

[16-Jun-18 10:06 AM] Hegelian#0018
Also, how good odds do you give BCH in the long term

[16-Jun-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
all the ecosystem coins like VRSC, CHIPS, OOT, etc.

[16-Jun-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
odds for BCH? for BCH to do what in the long term

[16-Jun-18 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
also this channel is not really for my personal opinions on other coins, more for questions about KMD ecosystem tech

[16-Jun-18 10:13 AM] Hegelian#0018
OK. I really enjoyed reading your views on bch and segwit and blockstream on slack. Unfortunately I cant search for them now

[16-Jun-18 10:14 AM] Hegelian#0018
I meant BCH odds of taking market share from BTC

[16-Jun-18 10:15 AM] Hegelian#0018
That's OK though. I'll come back with KMD related questions later. Thanks!

[16-Jun-18 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
I predict both BTC and BCH will be around a long time

[16-Jun-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
since even dead coins dont die, it isnt such an insight though

[16-Jun-18 01:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I hodl both ETH and ETC for that reason. whatever tiny bit I have in both.

[16-Jun-18 01:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
have no BTC, but I hodl BCH.

[16-Jun-18 01:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
_anyway, topic of trading channel._ üòÉ

[16-Jun-18 09:12 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I'm curious how Komodo could reach 1 million tx/sec without compromising security & centralization, @jl777c  could you explain a little bit ?  If Komodo could be that scalable, then with the upcoming smart contract support + the security of Bitcoin network, Komodo would become the best platform out there

[16-Jun-18 11:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
delayed proof of work

[16-Jun-18 11:54 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@polycryptoblog  can you elaborate  ? as  I understand  with dPoW  Komodo is able to "save its history" on other blockchain such as bitcoin blockchain, but how does it help Komodo reaching 1 million tx/sec ?

[17-Jun-18 12:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
@PHBA2061 the 1 mil tx/s are due to Merkle-on-Merkle, SPV validations and a Burn protocol. Thousands of coins being able to swap against each other thanks to a Burn protocol, maintaining their total emission. And they trust each other because they are being notarized on KMD blockchain (and indirectly onto BTC blockchain).

[17-Jun-18 01:05 AM] Alright#0419
It's my understanding that storing the MoMoM in the KMD chain allows a user to verify a tx on any of the parallel chains by looking at the KMD chain. Is that correct?

[17-Jun-18 01:05 AM] Alright#0419
MoMoM being merkle root of merkle root of merkle root for anyone wondering

[17-Jun-18 01:06 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@PHBA2061  the DPoW provides the security if the application accepting the KMD/assetchain waits for a notarization.

[17-Jun-18 01:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Alright   yes, merkle root is included in block header of parallel chain,  this allows parallel chain to verify tx was good on its own chain,  since the MoMoM is a cascade effect of merkle roots   one couldnt change original merkle root without changing the rest, so you are correct.

[17-Jun-18 01:19 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
you can view the momom in the kmd chain to verify tx

[17-Jun-18 02:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe that can help answer some questions.

[17-Jun-18 02:37 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD chain will be required to be able to generate the proofs for the tx, but any tx on any chain can be validated. it is quite powerful

[17-Jun-18 02:41 AM] jl777c#5810
with each notarization the assetchain sends in the MoM for the blocks since the prior notarization, KMD then calculates the MoMoM for all MoM from all assetchains to add to that notarization. It gets notarized, KMD updates the set of indexes so that now any tx covered by the MoM is able to be proven via nested SPV proofs

[17-Jun-18 02:41 AM] jl777c#5810
building on that is a burn protocol that allows to preserve total coins across  all the chains in a cluster by only allowing to recreate coins that were burnt, onetime on one chain

[17-Jun-18 08:17 AM] PHBA2061#2530
thank you all for your answers

[17-Jun-18 09:20 AM] Hegelian#0018
The coins who use KMD notary service. That arnt asset chains, they have to buy KMD for it to work? What does it cost?

[17-Jun-18 09:23 AM] Hegelian#0018
Another question: how soon after zec does the sapling update, the one that allows z tx with only 40 mb ram, will kmd upgrade?

[17-Jun-18 09:24 AM] Hegelian#0018
Also, is there a timeline for a mobile agama? Do you think kmd will be first zksnarks coin that does mobile z tx?

[17-Jun-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes. about 300KMD/yaer. not sure. probably zec will be the first

[18-Jun-18 03:27 AM] chinmaydshah#6404
Where do the 300 kmd go to? Also I see that notaries are elected - how centralized is the election and reward (deciding who is a notary) process? How much human vetting is involved?

[18-Jun-18 03:37 AM] BlackJesus#6161
holders of the CRYPTO asset chain receive those payments.

[18-Jun-18 03:37 AM] BlackJesus#6161
the notaries do notkeep that

[18-Jun-18 03:38 AM] Hegelian#0018
DEX get dex fees, jumblr get junblr fees, crypto get notary fees and what do the other assets get?

[18-Jun-18 03:39 AM] Hegelian#0018
Like HODL and supernet?

[18-Jun-18 03:43 AM] BlackJesus#6161
hodl is a closed end asset it holds a ton of other coins and trades on face value. Supernet is about the same as hodl except it dividends its holdings of DEX/CRYPTO and whatever else actually is a paying asset

[18-Jun-18 03:46 AM] BlackJesus#6161
mshark is also another fund like hodl

[18-Jun-18 03:47 AM] BlackJesus#6161
supernet has by far the biggest pot and just recently bought 2% of all utrum tokens

[18-Jun-18 03:51 AM] Hegelian#0018
Are all dividends for supernet paid out in kmd?

[18-Jun-18 04:16 AM] BlackJesus#6161
yes

[18-Jun-18 04:16 AM] BlackJesus#6161
all dividending assets payout in kmd

[18-Jun-18 07:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Once the kmd scaling goes live, how will this affect daily tx number on the kmd ‚Äòmain chain‚Äô? Will this also significantly increase these numbers? We recently saw the switch with regards to the claiming of rewards to montly instead of yearly, to increase usage security and anonimity. Can we expect a similar effect from the scaling efforts? Or even bigger?

[18-Jun-18 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless of the tx, each new chain will add its notarizations to KMD. So a one price of 300KMD to pay the notarization txfees and you can have 1 tx per day or a million on one chain. Of course if there are a million such chains, that is millions of notarizations per day, which would use up most of the chain. And 300 million KMD per year of KMD fees... It seems before then we need to deploy the solution for allowing billions of chains

[18-Jun-18 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
all possible, just no need to solve years ahead of time

[18-Jun-18 08:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I was more thinking in the sense that short term it will increase the useage of the main kmd chain

[18-Jun-18 08:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Which is a good thing and the same reason why kmd switched from yearly to monthly reward claiming

[18-Jun-18 08:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But as you say, I dont think it will become an issue or problem that the main kmd chain would be to bloated or whatever

[18-Jun-18 08:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Short term more of an advantage

[18-Jun-18 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
short term advantage. long term even bigger advantage, especially to those who hodl KMD through the bear market

@chinmaydshah notary centralisation is touched on in the whitepaper.  for the hypothetical case that notaries became centralised, the worst they could do is not notarise to btc.  for this to happen, more than 50 out of the 64 notary nodes need to conspire with each other to have that effect.

[19-Jun-18 10:07 AM] Mylo#8306
the voting process is open to all kmd holders.  notary elections are open to anyone.  approximately 30 of the 60 available (out of 64) notary nodes are elected each year.  the other 30 are automatically elected.
what decides auto-re-election?  the top performing notary nodes (the ones that participate in the multisig transaction to btc, "the notarisation"), so it is in the notaries interest to perform their function to be auto-re-elected, otherwise, they must stand for election with freshly enthusiastic candidates.

[19-Jun-18 10:08 AM] Mylo#8306
30+30 != 64.  what about the other 4?
There are 4 notary nodes that are used by dev team afaik

[19-Jun-18 10:25 AM] gcharang#6833
Also the Komodo notary election process is costless to the voter. They get airdropped VOTE tokens equivalent to the amount of KMD they hold. So voters don't need to  actually spend real money to make their opinion heard.
