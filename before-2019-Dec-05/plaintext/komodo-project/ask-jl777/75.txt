and PIRATE already has more than that, KMD is almost there

[30-Jun-19 12:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And what limits you from making Z-nSPV clients?

[30-Jun-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the ability to sign the ztransaction locally

[30-Jun-19 12:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Okay, I'll try to explore Zcash's Lightwalletd project which is working on making a Z Lite clients.

I know @radix42 already explored it, and had some issue trying with KMD. I'll have a look and see what I can understand out of it. Hope that will help.

[30-Jun-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, not sure if that is an SPV client or API wallet, i think more the latter

[30-Jun-19 12:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
true....

[30-Jun-19 12:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
anyway looking forward to your nSPV code! üòÉ

[30-Jun-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
it is easy enough, i dont plan to code it myself

[30-Jun-19 12:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c another question. Right now AtomicDEX uses Electrum based SPV clients in backend. I guess we can also upgrade it to use nSPV when it's available after enough testing and stabilisation? What you think how much of work that will be?

[30-Jun-19 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
my understanding is that the wallet functions are cleanly separated in atomicDEX, so once there is an SPV wallet, it is a matter to use it

i think blackjok3r, dimxy, mihailo are all able to do the required daemon side code and can more fully describe to whoever wants to implement the daemon side. shouldnt be more than a week or two of work. the main work is the nSPV client to become a valid peer on the p2p network. the actual message processing wont be that much work once it is a valid peer

certainly all the devs on that CC list are able to, but likely most are very saturated

[30-Jun-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
and likely nSPV is so simple, none of them would need much help from me

does this feature a solve to the hack problem

[30-Jun-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
not that specific hack, which was essentially a keylogger

[30-Jun-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
but having nearly native level security and api wallet performance that is fully decentralized and scalable...

[30-Jun-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
it is quite a nice improvement across the board

[30-Jun-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
it also allows mm2 to scale to millions of users

[30-Jun-19 04:59 PM] actionslacks#4072
how many nodes would be necessary for mm2 to scale to that level?

[30-Jun-19 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it uses the p2p network of the coin

[30-Jun-19 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
at the 1000 node level, i estimate a million users can be supported

[30-Jun-19 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
roughly speaking

[30-Jun-19 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
and currently KMD has about that and PIRATE has more than that

[30-Jun-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it would still work with less nodes, just slower

[01-Jul-19 08:18 PM] smellycouch#3071
hi there,

I realize KMD isn't really supposed to use kvupdate/kvsearch, but out of curiousity I'm testing it out a little bit on the KMD chain (mostly my own testnet until now, for demonstration only)

it gives even more powers to masternodes. the more powers special nodes have, the closer it goes to centralization. do we know that the majority of MN are not controlled by a single entity?

[03-Jul-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
NN are specifically designed with limited powers, just enough to provide an agreed upon reference using the existing chain consensus

Hey jl, a friend of mine told me about a friend of him who is very active in cryptospace. He told me that he was main dev from waves and his name was tosch...so i asked him if it is the same tosh  who works for nxt. He confirm...so i asked me are you still on contact wirh tosch? What do you think of him and is it possible to hire him for komodo? I heard he is a great dev

[03-Jul-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
i know of tosch, he is good GUI dev. he did the SuperNET GUI years ago, which i think was the starting point for WAVES GUI

[03-Jul-19 01:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
@jl777c nSPV... Following most of what was said so far... All dPoW notarized coins are thus far supposed to have 100% confidence in spends after a single notarization... So would the same not hold true for lite wallet transactions... Would the change to make nSPV real just be trimming the lite wallet to load only the last notarized blocking and be fully confident in spends?

[03-Jul-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
lite wallet is using electrum server, nSPV uses the coins p2p network

[03-Jul-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810

Hi JL, what do you think about the coordicide solution from IOTA. If they manage to make that work, wouldnt that be the ideal decentralized and scalable DLT? Is KMD locked in on dPow or is KMD able to change the mechanism if a better solution comes around (can be coordicide or something else)?

[03-Jul-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
coordicide is a mechanism to remove the centralization of the tangle coordinator

[03-Jul-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD doesnt have a tangle, nor a centralized coordinator to remove

[03-Jul-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
