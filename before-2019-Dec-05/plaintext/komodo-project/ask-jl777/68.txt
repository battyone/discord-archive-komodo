"I did not even know there was a wallet.dat file and just formatted it." <--- once you format your wallet.dat, then how will you have any privkeys?

[10-Jun-19 06:51 AM] alexoh#0560
No,  I have not private key

[10-Jun-19 07:17 AM] PHBA2061#2530
then I'm afraid you can't recover your funds ...

[10-Jun-19 10:31 AM] beor#1569
Hi JL777, the HODL asset rigth now is inside of the secure address, isn't it? because the original address is practically empty rigth now.

[10-Jun-19 10:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@beor      RLVzC4tr9cNKvuw2z4m8KuMfZURwCehx55   is the new address

[10-Jun-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
in order not to take any chances, i swept all funds. at first we had no idea what the specific exploit was

[10-Jun-19 10:50 AM] gobi#1545
What's the best method for determining what assets you had in what particular account in the past?

[10-Jun-19 10:51 AM] gobi#1545
I have about 10 separate wifs and I'm trying to figure out which ones held which assets (SNET, HODL, BET, etc, etc)

[10-Jun-19 10:51 AM] gobi#1545
kmd is easy enough to check historical balances on blockchain, I assume there's explorers for the assets as well?

[10-Jun-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
different explorers

sweet, thanks.

assetviewer is very very handy

[10-Jun-19 10:53 AM] gobi#1545
yeah it is, but it's current only, not historical (at least the way I'm reading it)

[10-Jun-19 10:53 AM] gobi#1545
the explorers should do though

[10-Jun-19 11:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
www.atomicexplorer.com is also handy

you can see which tx were done in the past for every asset

[10-Jun-19 01:08 PM] Donnie#5484
When is there any kind of news or partnership or something like that?

[10-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Donnie#5484

I saw today a clip of terminator 2 on youtube where arnold was replaced with AI video editing software by Sylvester Stallone. I think we have come now on era where it is need for tampered proof video codec. So my question comes now what is your thoughts how this would needed to done. I believe blockchain industry is best option in this case for digital signing to codec. @jl777c

Hi
Is it impossible to recover my funs

[11-Jun-19 03:27 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
If you do not have the private key you can not recover your funds

[11-Jun-19 06:03 AM] designer#4893
let me ask you one question.
can the government stop komodo?
or can't stop it?

james, what do you think?

[11-Jun-19 06:04 AM] jspook16#3059
Can't be stopped. One government can't stop it worldwide for sure

[11-Jun-19 06:07 AM] designer#4893
If governments around the world are united, they can stop it, but I don't think there's much chance of it.

[11-Jun-19 06:20 AM] jl777c#5810
@Mark81 seems that original author would need to register a hash of content to be able to prove it is their work. but modified works... that is much harder

[11-Jun-19 06:21 AM] jl777c#5810
@happy, the day all the countries that follow ussa, russia and china are all 100% united, then whatever targeted crypto would have to live on via meshnets and in the fourth (countries unaffiliated with the big 3) world

[11-Jun-19 06:22 AM] jl777c#5810
however, KMD doesnt support zaddr, so it does not present a lightning rod for the attention of the big 3

[11-Jun-19 06:39 AM] Mark81#4505
Hmmm. What if this AI softaware would change peoples thinking in long term that videos are not trustless unless their hashes had been uploaded to universal ledger to internet or done by with standard video codec that  do hash timestamps in way bitcoin does its checkpoints to blockchain? So preparing to future creating new standard around this thinking might needed.  Every video recording device vould jump to this standard or supoort this once this comes issue in next decade.

[11-Jun-19 06:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be, maybe you start the CODEC chain!

[11-Jun-19 07:15 AM] Mark81#4505
I don't now about that but it's an idea to possible problem. Open source standard, no patents needed since its tokenized via blockchain. Its android solution to this patent centralized world. Maybe an possible idea for RFOX to start running idea?

[11-Jun-19 10:54 AM] Dave123#3592
@jl777c  Did supernet sell all its Iota or why doesnt it appear in the asset list anymore?

[11-Jun-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, notice the KMD balance

👍 

[11-Jun-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing against iota, the KMD prospects seem better to me and this was done well before the recent hack incident

[11-Jun-19 01:06 PM] KomaSteve#4705
@jl777c  hi there, one question please... is it save to send my kmd´s form the save adress to the Utrum wallet? thanks 😉

[11-Jun-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
only the komodo agama wallet was targeted in the attack

[11-Jun-19 01:09 PM] KomaSteve#4705
ok, thanks a lot for the fast answer, i will fill out the form today ! ps: best move in crypto ever 😉

[11-Jun-19 02:47 PM] Philtr#9415
hello, i cant get to my KOMODO Wallet with my Seed. is there any chance to get my Coins back?

[11-Jun-19 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to have access to your old seed

[11-Jun-19 02:48 PM] Philtr#9415
If I use my Seed I get to an other Adress.

[11-Jun-19 02:49 PM] SHossain#0007
then, you are using wrong seed or malformed seed

[11-Jun-19 02:51 PM] Philtr#9415
I only have use this seed. and it worked.

[11-Jun-19 03:06 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@Philtr is your seed a 24 words seed ? When you paste your seed into Verus Agama, does it show the green message `iguana 256 bits` ?

@Mark81 
joker made a program that can stream any data (including video) to blockchain 
if the author declares the pubkey to the world and the chain is dPoWed(time stamp)
then the problem you describe is mostly solved

In the upcoming hard update, do I remember correctly that there were also going to be new implementations so binance could adapt dpowconfigs?

[11-Jun-19 09:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I thought I read a discussion about this over a week ago but cant find it anymore

[12-Jun-19 12:20 AM] RJF#6619
@jl777c  Just want to thank you and the team for what you did, my KMD are back where they should be and all is well. Amazing job all, thanks!!!

[12-Jun-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
@RJF glad you got your funds back

[12-Jun-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
@Cryptoon we dont know how binance is calculating the confirmations, our new support might automatically work, or not. we can only know by testing

[12-Jun-19 06:15 AM] Shabi#2462
@jl777c I was wondering if you could give me some advice Agama was running on my machine as the full client and was showing a balance I followed the instructions to move to a safe new seed but when I put in my seed it is only showing transactions no transactions but if I put in my private key it is only showing transactions back to jan of 2018

[12-Jun-19 06:17 AM] gcharang#6833
@Shabi which version of Agama are you using? and does it display your balance exactly?

[12-Jun-19 06:20 AM] Shabi#2462
@gcharang I had Agama_windows_installer_0.3.5 running but switched over to or tried to switch to Agama-Windows-v0.6.0-13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview

[12-Jun-19 06:34 AM] Philtr#9415
@PHBA2061 I use Agama v0.6.0-13 and it show my address now. With other version of Agama same seed but not my address come.

[12-Jun-19 06:35 AM] gcharang#6833

Hi 
I just launched a crypto merch store (SatFam.com) 
I use shopify and would like to add KMD for payments.
Coinpayments doesn’t work for a German located shop.

Any other options? 

Thanks Steve

[13-Jun-19 02:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Steff   That’s strange coinpayments won’t work in your location.  You can use Veruspay to add KMD payments to Shopify.  https://link.medium.com/eatInJgutX

My stolen KMD is on the move. Do you need this intel? Or should I just wait when you examine my form input?

[15-Jun-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
you were refunded already though

[15-Jun-19 12:34 PM] farl#9964
Really?

[15-Jun-19 12:34 PM] farl#9964
Thought my refunds were examined after 15 june, case by case

[15-Jun-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure, as i processed all the claims that i had for KMD

[15-Jun-19 12:34 PM] farl#9964

[15-Jun-19 12:37 PM] farl#9964
But still, the stolen KMD are on the move. Look like they are coming together to 1 single address. But hell, what can we do about that...

[15-Jun-19 12:39 PM] farl#9964
But this was refunded from your personal account James?

[15-Jun-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
in effect that is what will happen, yes

[15-Jun-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
currently not 100% have been claimed, so it came from sweep address, but we are not far from where all the sweep funds are used up. at that point i will need to contribute to keep the refunds going. which i will do

[15-Jun-19 12:42 PM] farl#9964
Thank you! You are like the matriarch of the herd. Looking after us. 🐘  😉

[15-Jun-19 12:43 PM] farl#9964

jl777 are you considering buying ARRR for SuperNET when viewkeys become available? my current understanding is, that lack of transparency was the reason you were hesitant to buy ARRR for SuperNET

[15-Jun-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe i should buy 100 BTC of PIRATE...
