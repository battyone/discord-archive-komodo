you need to understand API wallet and SPV wallet before you can understand nSPV

okÔºåthank youÔºåmy English is not good so have some problem in understanding

[05-Jul-19 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe there are articles in your language to describe electrum and SPV wallets

yes, it gets some revenue share from DEX

Is it possible to do an atomic swap between a coin like Doge and a Komodo smartchain based token ?

[06-Jul-19 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No, tokens contain extra data that most coins s can't use. Or have not got

[06-Jul-19 01:28 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@blackjok3r   I remember you working on a feeless transaction mechanism, is that working?

[06-Jul-19 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Don't recall that lol, so I guess not. U can just make zero fee txns ifnu like already... Or maybe use paymentscc so u can pay massive amounts of address but I think just making a huge tx would do much the same thing

[06-Jul-19 01:37 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Basically I want to use a coin as a receipt ,  receipts being indivisible is why I‚Äôm looking at feeless.  Original idea was to use a Komodo based token, but then lose interoperability .  using an Eth token  can maintain interoperability via atomic swaps and maintain indivisibility but run into problem of 3rd party fee . Using a Komodo assetchain coin itself has the issue with divisibility

[06-Jul-19 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sounds like tokens are what u want but I hate our implementation of them as they stand tbh, there already exists a poc in started that refactors it to work much better but dimxy wrote it and I'm hesitant to change it the amount it requires for fear of breaking it. 


Even with the new way, the tokens information is stored in a place that basically no chains apart from kmd forks possess. So sending it to another chain would be quite a mission.

[06-Jul-19 02:37 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@blackjok3r  don‚Äôt need to send the token to another chain just need it to be able to swappable with atomicdex.  A regular assetchain could work  with fees and decimals removed but not sure how that would work with atomicdex because of the dexfee.  I guess if the coin was ‚Äúmaker only‚Äù.  It could work , Not sure if that is possible though.

[06-Jul-19 02:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure what you mean, you cant atomic swap a token if it cant get to the other chain üòï

[06-Jul-19 03:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I‚Äôm probably not explaining it right,  trying to say we need something like how we do atomic swaps with Eth Erc20 tokens but with Komodo tokens instead

[06-Jul-19 03:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I can swap between digibyte and augur currently but can‚Äôt swap between digibyte and a TokenCC created token.

[06-Jul-19 03:05 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Which is a bit ironic

[06-Jul-19 03:07 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I mean tokenCC was t around when erc20 swaps started so it makes sense but it‚Äôs odd nonetheless ,  as Eth is typically seen as our number 1 competitor by outsiders

[06-Jul-19 03:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm I think I get it now, so you just want to transafer the token to another pubkey but in exchange for another coin? 
This should be possible without much effort, but I really think we should re do tokens before adding amy more complexity to them.

[06-Jul-19 03:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have been working on a new CC that uses all the new stuff, that allows tokens to work without spagetti code and bruteforceing things, and sent this to dimxy. Hopefully he can understand my example and we can work on the new token format in comming months.

[06-Jul-19 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem with them is that most of the existing tokens cannot use the new format because simply they are too big and will not fit. So we need to design it in a way that still allows all that to work. I got pretty close a while ago, but abbandoned my work about 40H in because it was just changing too much stuff before the hard fork.

[06-Jul-19 03:31 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking to do.   I have in mind using these tokens to represent warehouse receipts used to claim stored goods, specifically standardized commodities but it can and will be expanded to other goods as well.  If these tokens can be atomic swapped with coins like I described above ,  this can effectively solve liquidity issue with Atomicdex, as well as other benefits , in the form many additional chains added to the ecosystem to accommodate other interests ( a different chain with its own tokens for each country or city or warehouse location for instance ) .  Beyond stablecoins(warehouse receipts ),  many chains ( fees to Komodo ),  liquidity ( more things for KMD to trade against )  it provides the ecosystem with a form of ‚Äúgood‚Äù money ( Gresham law reference )  which can siphon from even other coins and their liquidity

[06-Jul-19 03:31 AM] PTYX#6840
Do you guys think it's wise to integrate Bep32 token support into the barterdex?

[06-Jul-19 03:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I‚Äôd rather have our own bitcoin token and other proxies

[06-Jul-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sounds like it would be useful. 
Basically what I came up with for tokens was to create the token, this can use a normal OP_RETURN which will stay as an unspent output that can be referanced by all tokens with this tokenid, so the tokens themself dont need to carry the data, obviously you cant send this data to another chain easily, MoMoM has some functionality for this, but not 100% sure its perfect to actualyl be used, I simply disabled the entire thing on LABS at least for now.

[06-Jul-19 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
However, for a token on a chain beifn able to be sold and brought by people, you can send only a token ccvout with the needed data to referance the OP_RETURN containing the relevent data.. This makes the tokens very small and also very easy to validate.

[06-Jul-19 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Being able to atmic sway these tokens seems trivial becuase they are just a vout, although being a ccvout liekty komodod will need some new RPC calls or something to allow marketmaker to transfer them, as marketmaker cannot construct cc txns.

[06-Jul-19 03:44 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
This sounds like what I need, and the ecosystem at large as well,  ex. Atomic swaps of tokens will be used quite heavily in our blockchain gaming sector.  Rogue player data for coins for instance .

[06-Jul-19 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They kind of work like this already, but its convoluted and a bit inefficant because we didnt know how to properly use CCs for the longest time. 
I hope I have figured that out and created an example that is simple enough to follow here:
`https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/blob/lotto/src/cc/customcc.cpp`

[06-Jul-19 03:50 AM] TonyL#3577
but CC tokens have native dex via RPC calls only

[06-Jul-19 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only now they do.

[06-Jul-19 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once we have token format standardised so that they are only 1 vout per token and not an entire tx with an op_return. Thing will be very easy.

[06-Jul-19 03:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you look at that cuistomcc.cpp/h you will see the entire validation does not even lookup any tx from disk. Everything runs out of addressindex, so its basically isntant reponse even with hundreds of thousands of utxos, at least that is the plan. I hope we can do some ridiulous testing of this, on LABS soon. Like sending 2 million bets to a single lotto game and seeing what happens

[06-Jul-19 03:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or registeing half a million pubkeys for one game.

[06-Jul-19 06:30 AM] rainbro7#4735

Hey @jl777c I am reading your article <https://komodoplatform.com/dpow-demystified/> ... what this second time means here? 

```Each blockchain‚Äôs network still comes to agreement on which transactions and blocks are valid. The whole network then comes to agreement a second time to determine which blocks will be notarized onto the KMD and BTC blockchains. Unless the blockchain is in sync across the network, the protocol that the NN run won‚Äôt reach consensus.```

[08-Jul-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the blockchain has its normal consensus rules to agree on which blocks are the mainchain, right?

[08-Jul-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the first time

[08-Jul-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the second time is when the notary network nodes come to consensus on what they are seeing as the mainchain (time delayed)

[08-Jul-19 04:13 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
This happens for each chain using dPoW.. like if there are 10 asset chains and 6 out side chains are using dPoW.. then NN have to come into consensus for each and everyone?

[08-Jul-19 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[08-Jul-19 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
for every notarization

[08-Jul-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
it is crucial that the normal consensus is allowed to happen and that the notaries get consensus among themselves, if not, it indicates there is some sort of chain split happening, and so the lack of notarizations indicates a possible problem

[08-Jul-19 04:17 PM] Malti#3948
it's also from that action that KMD usages comes right? As they pay for those notarizations in KMD?

[08-Jul-19 04:19 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
if 10 blockchains are using dPoW .. will there be 10 different notarization transaction or only a single

[08-Jul-19 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
each chain is notarized independently

[08-Jul-19 04:21 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
ok.. so If there are 1000 chains using komodo,.,,, Komodo will be taking almost all the bitcoin transaction space?

[08-Jul-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[08-Jul-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
only one KMD -> BTC notarization per cycle

[08-Jul-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless of how many AC -> KMD notarizations there are

[08-Jul-19 04:23 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
so AC notarization  data is on KMD and KMD notarization on BTC....correct?

[08-Jul-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[08-Jul-19 04:27 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
AC get notarized on Komodo chain in every 10 minutes and KMD also get notarized in every 10 minutes on Bitcoin blockchain?

[08-Jul-19 04:27 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
or there is time difference

[08-Jul-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not synchronized at blocktimes are not

[08-Jul-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
that is an estimate of how often they happen

[08-Jul-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
just look at https://komodod.com/dpow/chart

[08-Jul-19 04:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
KMD > BTC is always going to be as it has always been. the same standard time notarisations every 10 minutes. no matter how many asset chains or 3rd party blockchains notarise to KMD.
any asset chain or 3rd party coin only notarise to KMD only, and not directly to BTC.

[08-Jul-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
there are other dPoW stats sites too

[08-Jul-19 04:29 PM] PHBA2061#2530
also,  for each AC notarization, there are 2 multisig transactions, 1 on the AC itself, example <https://rfox.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/d515e8e61dafc88a08131f122c343140dd8cd35c363f63f014f09a59c092bf0f> & 1 on Komodo <https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/4c7a13e29484cc3ead95c5de8b6611a0d2d9cfda6c5ea0b7d0c95147576a4240>

[08-Jul-19 04:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess @coinmonks || CoinCodeCap confusion is if somehow adding more Assetchains and 3rd party chains to notarisation process increases the transactions or the size of notarisation data going from KMD to BTC. That's not the case.

[08-Jul-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
single blockhash validates all tx in that block (and all prior blocks)

[08-Jul-19 04:32 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
ok...

[08-Jul-19 04:40 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
```Notarization process works in two-fold, in every 10 minutes (based on block interval, not temporal), notarized nodes take a snapshot of every smartchains and other 3rd party chains using komodo's dPoW and notarize it on Komodo blockchain. And then these notarized nodes take a snapshot of Komodo blockchain and notarize it on Bitcoin blockchain.```

[08-Jul-19 04:40 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
is this correct?
