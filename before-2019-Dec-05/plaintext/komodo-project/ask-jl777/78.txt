let's assume dPoW support all type of blockchain.. doesn't matter what consensus mechanism ... if it's public or private... 

Now tell me how big is the market?

[09-Jul-19 10:09 PM] actionslacks#4072
how big was the market 3 years ago? this is a marathon

[09-Jul-19 10:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
How many coins are willing to say they cannot prevent 51% attacks? It is a pride issue as well.

[09-Jul-19 10:09 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
"How many coins are willing to say they cannot prevent 51% attacks? It is a pride issue as well." ,,, this is assumption

[09-Jul-19 10:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Most are not looking at protecting their network

[09-Jul-19 10:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That is the truth

[09-Jul-19 10:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We are catering to users we know are there

[09-Jul-19 10:09 PM] phm87#7395
zpool have more than 300 coins, all should be compatible but if ETH and XMR clones can be added, we can go up to 1000 coins easily

[09-Jul-19 10:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Why waste valuable resources on something that may not get many users

[09-Jul-19 10:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
XMR not compatible yet but with blur they are working on it

[09-Jul-19 10:10 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
how much dPoW charges are?

[09-Jul-19 10:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I think like 300 or 500kmd a year

[09-Jul-19 10:11 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Peanuts

[09-Jul-19 10:11 PM] phm87#7395
it can be free if you do everything yourself

[09-Jul-19 10:11 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Well no it is never free, since you would pay the BTC fees?

[09-Jul-19 10:11 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
WTF 500 KMD/year?

[09-Jul-19 10:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
There is the fee for service prived by chainmakers etc, but there is also a dPoW fee

[09-Jul-19 10:12 PM] phm87#7395
if a coin community runs their own Notary Nodes network, they can secure themselves and do not pay anything for notarization (outside of their own servers costs and nota costs)

[09-Jul-19 10:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
How would they dPoW?

[09-Jul-19 10:12 PM] PHBA2061#2530
there is a 10000 sat / vin / notarization , so it will never be free ...

[09-Jul-19 10:13 PM] SHossain#0007
it is not easy to run dPoW servers, let alone decentralized

[09-Jul-19 10:13 PM] phm87#7395
@PHBA2061 that's why I wrote ``nota costs`` at the end

[09-Jul-19 10:14 PM] SHossain#0007
maintenance is very hard

[09-Jul-19 10:14 PM] phm87#7395
if Ethereum (of Vitalik) wants dpow, I think that they can elect 64 NN for ETH NN network

[09-Jul-19 10:14 PM] PHBA2061#2530
so it's not free right lol ?

[09-Jul-19 10:14 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Simple question -- I am IBM, I need to secure my hyperledger blockchain..also need KMD support ..how much it will cost (average)?  and how break down will looks like

[09-Jul-19 10:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
300-500

[09-Jul-19 10:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
kmd

[09-Jul-19 10:15 PM] SHossain#0007
it will be 365 KMD + 365 HyperLedger and service fee which would be few thousand USD

[09-Jul-19 10:15 PM] SHossain#0007
and any integration cost
and, maybe a codebase security audit if the sourcecode is completely new and not based on bitcoin or zcash

[09-Jul-19 10:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The support would be free because it is a win win to onboard them

[09-Jul-19 10:16 PM] phm87#7395
@PHBA2061  if the coin community wants one nota per 1000 blocks or one nota per block, the cost can change (actual cost spent in tx fees). Notary Nodes won't be happy to handle 300 chains (I asked ^^)

[09-Jul-19 10:17 PM] phm87#7395
so solution is other notarization networks

[09-Jul-19 10:17 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
ok so support fee is goes to Komodo team..cool..it will help in development or in future .. independent businesses can provide that.. But In terms of tokenomics it sucks... How KMD will acquire value with such a low fee

[09-Jul-19 10:17 PM] SHossain#0007
if there are over 300 chains, Notary Node ops has to rent another server

[09-Jul-19 10:19 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@coinmonks this is a long term plan. The ecosystem is being built up for people to use our tech, not to tax them.

Overtime a tiny % on huge flow is better than a big fee on small flow.

[09-Jul-19 10:19 PM] hyperDEX#6586
This is what you are missing.

[09-Jul-19 10:19 PM] actionslacks#4072
imagine the value dPoW will have when btc is $100k and higher

[09-Jul-19 10:22 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
We can play some sort of game theory here...less chain --- higher fee (may be token burning) .... more chains --> fee go less.... I am not fully sure here ,,,but we can think how we can capture value in KMD token...not in tech

[09-Jul-19 10:22 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@phm87  `if the coin community wants one nota per 1000 blocks or one nota per block, the cost can change` the closer to "free" you are, the less secure it is, I think 1 nota per 1000 blocks is as good as not having dpow at all ..

💯 ✅ komodo 

[09-Jul-19 10:23 PM] phm87#7395
I agree

[09-Jul-19 10:23 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I wii dig more info about dPoW ,,, will see I can propose something in terms of capturing value on KMD

[09-Jul-19 10:24 PM] SHossain#0007
the approach we have taken is incremental service fee. whoever comes first will have to pay less service fee than the next. this will increase adoption. starting with higher price doesn't make this appealing to projects. and, there are lot of projects that can't pay higher fee

[09-Jul-19 10:24 PM] SHossain#0007
so, get in first pay less. the price per year would be grandfathered

[09-Jul-19 10:24 PM] phm87#7395
KMDLabs launch another notarization network that notarize other assetchains on KMD. I think that this kind of experiment is the future of dPoW

[09-Jul-19 10:25 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
service fee doesn't capture value in KMD token.. I am concern about it ..the whole purpose of this ecosystem/tech  is to capture value in KMD token

[09-Jul-19 10:26 PM] SHossain#0007
projects have to pay 365 KMD per year. they have to buy it from market

[09-Jul-19 10:26 PM] phm87#7395
@PHBA2061  several assetchains and coins notarized have a lower blocktime than KMD so if you replace 1000 in my sentence that you quoted with the number of blocks between 2 notas. Anyway, that's another discussion

[09-Jul-19 10:26 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
what happens to these 365 KMDs ?

[09-Jul-19 10:26 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
they goes to notary nodes?

[09-Jul-19 10:27 PM] SHossain#0007
notary nodes mine KMD at easy diff

[09-Jul-19 10:27 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
those 365 KMDs ...can we burn them?

[09-Jul-19 10:27 PM] SHossain#0007
they mine 1500 to 2000 KMD a month

[09-Jul-19 10:28 PM] SHossain#0007
why would you burn those 365 KMD? they will be used for development.
SuperNET pays for BTC notarizations. they dont' have infinite supply of BTC but enough to cover at least next 10 years worth of notarization. those KMD will help buy more BTC in the future

[09-Jul-19 10:29 PM] SHossain#0007
up until now, BTC notarization is covered for next 10 years. those BTC were raised from the ICO

[09-Jul-19 10:31 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@phm87 my point was to prove that notarization can't be free ...

[09-Jul-19 10:31 PM] phm87#7395
if you do the calculation, I think that SuperNET pays a lot from its BTC fund when BTC mempool is full and BTC tx fee is high. I don't think that the 365 KMDs covers this : SuperNET is using its fund to cover its experiment.

[09-Jul-19 10:32 PM] phm87#7395
@PHBA2061 I agree  about the cost that is not nul but it is not necessary to pay sth to KMD team if you do everything yourself (KMDLabs copypaste)

[09-Jul-19 10:32 PM] phm87#7395
but you need skills that only few have (and all I know are within KMD team)

[09-Jul-19 10:33 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I will read more and come back .. Then this discussion will be more informative.. But everyone should always think in terms of how KMD token will capture value ....nothing else

[09-Jul-19 10:34 PM] allbits#5898
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap that's literally the opposite of the ethos here

[09-Jul-19 10:34 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Why have a token then?

[09-Jul-19 10:34 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
capturing value in token is the whole purpose ..look at BTC

[09-Jul-19 10:35 PM] allbits#5898
BTC does nothing along those lines

[09-Jul-19 10:35 PM] SHossain#0007
we aim to increase usage. value will come behind it

[09-Jul-19 10:35 PM] SHossain#0007
not looking for pump and dump

[09-Jul-19 10:35 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
and where that value get captured?

[09-Jul-19 10:35 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I am not talking about trading

[09-Jul-19 10:36 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I am talking about incentive design

[09-Jul-19 10:36 PM] SHossain#0007
each project buy 365 KMD per year to pay for notarization. now multiply with N number of project

[09-Jul-19 10:37 PM] allbits#5898
We don't care about taxing users to capture value

[09-Jul-19 10:37 PM] SHossain#0007
and each project that uses dPoW that works as a bit of marketing, increases value

[09-Jul-19 10:37 PM] SHossain#0007
we don't want to jump high

[09-Jul-19 10:37 PM] SHossain#0007
less is more

[09-Jul-19 10:38 PM] SHossain#0007
anyway, i'll let jl777 to answer more here as this is his channel

[09-Jul-19 10:38 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm not markeing as well. what i said is what i feel about Komodo

[09-Jul-19 10:42 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
See .. don't think it's tax .. think how we can design a system which can sustain for hundreds of years.. In the start BTC can be mined on the a normal computer.. if you look back you will think that was the free money... but it wasn't ..early adopters didn't even know this will worth in the future on not?

My point was dPoW is spot on usecase ..and komodo already validated it by providing it to more than 3 projects.. we should focus on this value proposition.,,,
and design komodo's tokenomics in a way that protocol capture value in KMD

[09-Jul-19 10:43 PM] actionslacks#4072
if kmd was looking to be the next IBM there would be a thick stack of patent certificates under it's belt already.

[09-Jul-19 10:44 PM] actionslacks#4072
for better or worse to vision is more freedom than profit oriented I think

[09-Jul-19 10:46 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
don't confuse incentives with profit seeking.....

[09-Jul-19 10:47 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
thats why I talked about buring the tokens ..when you burn tokens ..every token holder get benefited from that

[09-Jul-19 10:50 PM] actionslacks#4072
token burning is akin to corporate stock buybacks. it's an exercise in sating greed.

[09-Jul-19 10:50 PM] allbits#5898
And no-one is going to think it's a good idea to stop development and promotion on building your own sovereign blockchain with leading smart chain capabilities. Your idea there is literally not ever going to happen.

always.. but I am "dPoW aka security as a service" minimalist ... I believe you guys will hate me in few days..  all my rational thinking tells me that this is the best product market fit for Komodo

[09-Jul-19 11:24 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Feel free to approach all the coin communities you can and get them to dPoW

[10-Jul-19 01:32 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap Regarding burning coins: 1) Komodo is not a company, no obligation for user gains,  in fact that’s more of a liability because that is an expectation of profit from the issuer and others which is one of the ways we have avoided being classified as a security .  There is a mechanism in play that accomplishes the same goals, lack of reward claiming , with only about 50% claiming their rewards about 12k coins per day never come into existence. Re: 3rd party chains as a focus.    Having experience with soliciting coins for the service,  most aren’t financially or technically in the position to receive it .  Especially if it requires a code audit.  Then there is the chains it would require extensive work to DPoW such as ethereum forks.  Which due to limited number of them it’s not worth devoting efforts to this time.  Most DPoW demand will come from Kmd created chains as it doesn’t require a code audit which costs tens of thousands and takes away from manpower.   I’m not worried about amount of chains joining the ecosystem.  It’s not hard to specialize a purpose into a chain.

[10-Jul-19 02:12 AM] Mylo#8306
We haven’t started 3rd party notarizing tools, documents, transactions.  Think about 1000 companies notarizing their own docs in dealings with others.  Even if they have a notary network of their own of 6 nodes requiring 2 signatures.  That is 6000 nodes requiring kmd to notarize to kmd.

7000 kmd will get 20 years of notarizations.
7000 x 1000 x 6 = 13 million.

That is 10% of current supply, 6.5% of total supply only for notarizing 3rd party documents.

This is ONE application of antara modules that enables logic and data to work in the transactional system.

Bonafide usage of the komodo currency for bitcoin level security on applications.

i hope such discussions can happen in marketing channels, this is nothing to do with me. my position on treating KMD as a token is: https://medium.com/@jameslee777/tokenomics-are-for-tokens-not-for-coins-3f262d0aa4b3

Only a 1000 will participate dose that mean over a 1000 wanted to join,?

Binance is clever. To achieve liquidity on their dex they made a contest where volume winners might get on their cex.
