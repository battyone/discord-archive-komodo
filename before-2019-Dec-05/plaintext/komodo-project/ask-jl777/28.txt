Maybe I don't understand, but it seems like they would gain double the reward. The cheated reward, and then the reward for finding the valid block.

[08-Oct-18 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
remember the entire network is mining the cheating utxo, so your chance of being able to claim it is your percentage of overall hashrate

[08-Oct-18 01:10 PM] Kalash#2884
which if repeated would only compound over time

[08-Oct-18 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
how do they gain double the reward if the first reward is lost?

[08-Oct-18 01:10 PM] Kalash#2884
the first reward isn't lost if they are able to validate their malicious attempt

[08-Oct-18 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
win a block, then cheat and lose it 95% of the time is the outcome if they have 5% the hashrate

[08-Oct-18 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
yes they lose the first one, just to regain it via the cheating claim

[08-Oct-18 01:11 PM] Kalash#2884
But it allows them to make their cheated claim valid

[08-Oct-18 01:11 PM] Kalash#2884
and yes, of course it requires a majority of hashrate

[08-Oct-18 01:12 PM] Kalash#2884
but with a small cap coin that's not very difficult

[08-Oct-18 01:12 PM] Kalash#2884
do that enough times and they then gain an exponentially increasing claim of stake rewards

[08-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
ok so say they have 100% the hashrate, they lose the first block reward, just to gain it via cheat claim

[08-Oct-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
how is that any better than just keeping the first blockreward???

[08-Oct-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
do you realize they lose the original blockreward if a cheat claim is made?

[08-Oct-18 01:13 PM] Kalash#2884
only if one of their nodes doesn't find it

[08-Oct-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and that assumes they are the miner 100 blocks later

[08-Oct-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
but if their node finds it, then either the original blockreward is kept or the cheat claim is not done

[08-Oct-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
how is there any gain?

[08-Oct-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems the best that happens is the same as if no cheating was attempted, but the worst is that the cheater doesnt mine the cheat claim and then loses

[08-Oct-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so we have net neutral or net negative. there is no positive that I see. maybe you can describe how you plan to make gains with this

[08-Oct-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
1 - 1 is 0

[08-Oct-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
1 + 0 is 1

[08-Oct-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
1 is 1

[08-Oct-18 01:21 PM] Kalash#2884
I see what you mean, but it does seem to be a way to allow a "free" doublespend. I need to read more, but something about this doesn't seem right.

[08-Oct-18 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
looking forward to an actual attack scenario. likely would be a VRSC bounty if you can find it

[08-Oct-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt "free" since to do the cheat claim the original blockreward is spent. how you think that is a double spend, i have no idea

[08-Oct-18 01:24 PM] Kalash#2884
I could be wrong, that's why I ask

[08-Oct-18 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
my sense is that you are wrong, but maybe i am wrong, so keep pursuing this

@Alright  @blackjok3r @CrisF @jl777c

Thank you all, very very much, for your advice.. And I sincerely mean that.

[09-Oct-18 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
when I started in crypto, I started by doing tech support

[09-Oct-18 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
granted I was already one of the better C programmers around, but knew nothing about crypto

@jl777c How you ended up with Ripple at start ?

[09-Oct-18 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i found NXT first, but ripple had a very profitable mining program and i needed some capital

thanks for clearing, I had always wondered about it üòÑ

Any chance Maxcoin will be listed on Barterdex?

[10-Oct-18 02:44 AM] Hermes#6934
Barterdex is an open platform,  their team will just need to send their request , they can even advance part of it directly with Github

[10-Oct-18 03:55 AM] DmanXX#2257
Thanks

[12-Oct-18 10:17 PM] criptobear#6402
@jl777c  would it be possible to connect a blockchain on komodo platform with a digital coin on a site , 2 ways? i am asking because there is a token on ethereum that was, and is even now, being airdropped to anybody with a social account, the project is https://powtoken.com/ they are struggling to create a working gateway to let people transform the digital coins in ERC20 tokens, and i was wondering if contacting them to solve their problem might give a push to komodo too seen they have thousands of people that claimed the tokens, i think that seen the incredible talent of the komodo's team this should be a piece of cake.

[13-Oct-18 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
what type of digital coin are they airdropped

[13-Oct-18 04:48 AM] criptobear#6402
POW lite is a digital coin, centralized and to be bridged to POW on Ethereum platform

[13-Oct-18 04:49 AM] criptobear#6402
the main idea of the project was to give everybody on the planet coins using facebook plugin

[13-Oct-18 04:50 AM] criptobear#6402
and to allow people to use it on and off blockchain with zero fees on the off version via their website interface, you can find info on https://powtoken.com/

[13-Oct-18 05:10 AM] Mylo#8306
@criptobear there is work being done in #deleted-channel and a brief update https://komodoplatform.com/tech-tuesday-update-5/ for bridging between these kinds of projects.

Tech Tuesday Update #5: A Summary Of Last Week's Development - Komodo
Komodo Platform is starting a weekly briefing on the progress the Komodo Dev Team is making. It's called Tech Tuesday Update. Here's the first one.
https://komodoplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/tech-tuesday-update.jpg

[13-Oct-18 06:32 AM] criptobear#6402
@Mylo I asked if it was possible a bridge between pow as a digital currency centralized on their server in their database and a POW coin on the Komodo platform

[13-Oct-18 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
just do an airdrop

[13-Oct-18 07:03 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes is the answer.  From their whitepaper however, they‚Äôve already been hacked in the past w centralized approaches.

Converting from erc20 to kmd would be possible once we have fungibility between the two.  But as jl says do an airdrop from a db.

[13-Oct-18 07:05 AM] Mylo#8306
10 billion tokens to the first user may need to be split into 5 separate 2 billion lot transactions.  And what is total supply?  I think kmd max is 764 billion

[13-Oct-18 07:07 AM] Mylo#8306
But these things are not deal breakers, invite them to test what the need.  https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/create-Komodo-Assetchain.html if they need assistance, just ask here in discord

[13-Oct-18 07:12 AM] Mylo#8306
The agama wallet is open source, desktop and android, so the just need a logo and their users have a multi coin wallet too!

[13-Oct-18 07:58 AM] criptobear#6402
And after creating the assetchain it would be possible to swap centralized version of the token automatically with the corresponding asset on kmd like it was done with btcd? The total supply is 230 billions.

[13-Oct-18 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
make a chain with 230 billion, then centrally send coins to registered addresses. why not?

[13-Oct-18 08:20 AM] criptobear#6402
Ok I will try to convince the team to contact Komodo platform thx for the help

[13-Oct-18 07:49 PM] jspook16#3059
@jl777c can the -ac_cc=# value be changed once set? so if it was originally set to ac_cc=2 can i later change it to ac_cc=100?

[13-Oct-18 07:55 PM] Alright#0419
@jspook16 you'd need to source code fork komodo and add an exception for your chain

[13-Oct-18 07:55 PM] jspook16#3059
Copy. Im better off making a new chain then

[13-Oct-18 07:56 PM] jspook16#3059
@Alright I cant sync back up with hollow for some reason. I get two magic bean notifications...one for 30644 blocks and the other for 24 blocks

[13-Oct-18 07:56 PM] jspook16#3059
then it syncs up to the 24block one

[13-Oct-18 07:56 PM] Alright#0419
what's in block 25?

[13-Oct-18 07:57 PM] jspook16#3059
nothing in mempool

[13-Oct-18 07:57 PM] Alright#0419
no errors? just stopped syncing?

[13-Oct-18 07:57 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah it syncs up to 24 and it's ready to go...I may just have to start fresh

[13-Oct-18 07:58 PM] jspook16#3059
so if I set ac_cc to 100 I should be good to go in general right?

[13-Oct-18 07:58 PM] jspook16#3059
if i make a new chain that is

[13-Oct-18 07:59 PM] Alright#0419
I'd like to figure out why ac_ccactivate didn't work as expected

[13-Oct-18 07:59 PM] Alright#0419
would like to try to save the chain even if you are going to scrap it afterwards

[13-Oct-18 08:00 PM] jspook16#3059
I'd rather save it ..... I stopped all of my nodes. I confirmed with hollow his was till running last night

[13-Oct-18 08:00 PM] Alright#0419
maybe stopping all nodes at the same time wasn't a good idea

[13-Oct-18 08:00 PM] jspook16#3059
I restarted my nodes with ac_ccactivate=30635

[13-Oct-18 08:00 PM] Alright#0419
@siu - Chainmakers used it on COQUI, maybe he'd have some insight

[13-Oct-18 08:00 PM] jspook16#3059
well hollowman's was still running

[13-Oct-18 08:01 PM] Alright#0419
and now you can't sync from his even without it?

[13-Oct-18 08:01 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah so now ive stopped all my nodes and am just trying to sync one up to his without -ac_cc

[13-Oct-18 08:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What happen?

[13-Oct-18 08:02 PM] Alright#0419
what are the chain params?

[13-Oct-18 08:02 PM] jspook16#3059
I tried ti activate CC on a chain

[13-Oct-18 08:02 PM] jspook16#3059
./komodod -ac_name=LIZ -ac_supp=100000000 -ac_reward=10000000000 -ac_halving=250000 -ac_end=3000000 -ac_staked=50 -addnode=73.201.153.236:52927

[13-Oct-18 08:02 PM] Alright#0419
siu, he tried to use ac_ccactivate on a chain, and it completely borked it

[13-Oct-18 08:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Whay did he do?

[13-Oct-18 08:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What*

[13-Oct-18 08:03 PM] jspook16#3059
all my nodes are shafted....only @Hollowman9000 s node is still running the original chain

[13-Oct-18 08:03 PM] jspook16#3059
I stopped my nodes.....restarted them with -ac_ccactivate=30635

[13-Oct-18 08:03 PM] jspook16#3059
the nodes started over at block 1

[13-Oct-18 08:04 PM] Alright#0419
did you have -gen set?

[13-Oct-18 08:05 PM] jspook16#3059
i dont remember but i dont believe so because 3 of the nodes have very limited resources....how ever I did pass komodo-cli setgenerate true 2 to my local node once i saw the blocks werent moving

[13-Oct-18 08:05 PM] Alright#0419
I don't think hollow has the port open

[13-Oct-18 08:05 PM] Alright#0419
can't get it as a peer

[13-Oct-18 08:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Was block 30635 ib the future

[13-Oct-18 08:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
M

[13-Oct-18 08:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
?

[13-Oct-18 08:05 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah

[13-Oct-18 08:05 PM] jspook16#3059
I'll check with @Hollowman9000

[13-Oct-18 08:06 PM] Alright#0419
oh why do you have that port appended to the ip like that?

[13-Oct-18 08:06 PM] Alright#0419
that's not the p2p port of the chain

[13-Oct-18 08:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If yoy have hollows node ip. Just resync pulling data from his node

[13-Oct-18 08:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Then try again.

[13-Oct-18 08:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What branch did you do it?

[13-Oct-18 08:06 PM] jspook16#3059
thats what i tried

[13-Oct-18 08:07 PM] Alright#0419
LIZ: p2p.40053 rpc.52928 ü§î

[13-Oct-18 08:07 PM] Alright#0419
why is this not off by 1?

[13-Oct-18 08:07 PM] jspook16#3059
oh i dont even know anymore.....Im sure it was master that had the latest updates for the 1M update
