There is a ac parameter called -ac_feeds, im pretty sure it could be used to import data through oracles and impose a condition to it using gateways.

maybe I missed it but are there any plans to make some easy api for marketmaker so that it could be backbone for shapshift-like services, meaning such service would only make the ui and plug to marketmaker? end user doing payment from blockchain would see different blockchains and fees dependent on spread based on marketmaker values ? or it is what is acually is already and just needs more marketing towards payment processing services ?

[27-Oct-19 07:02 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it would be great to attract all those services doing btc payments - they would provide liquidity and get liquidity; what could attract them would be easy quick implementation/connection to mm

[27-Oct-19 07:05 AM] Audo#5667
I'll answer what I know: yes – it's called AtomicAPI. The full release is still coming but there is documentation already online

would be great to see MM based payment service, where you could specify outgoing addr, amount, currency, and send your preferred currency in relevant amount; that would need to include some buy/sell walls fluctuations to make it mostly instant; probably would need few steps: **1. user fills in outgoing parameters 2. user gets back the amounts (included spread and spread fluctuations) needed from different currencies he owns in the wallet  3. user selects and query selected options 4. if tx is not instantly taken - the form gives back updated values doubleing the spread fluctuations - this way after 2-3 interations there tx should pass through** (user friendly during bigger fluctuations)

[27-Oct-19 07:40 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
additionally if the tx will cost less due to fluctuations - the remaining change could stay on user side not to overpay

[27-Oct-19 07:42 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
actually this could be built in into  atomic dex, and since in there (form + request functions) could maybe be easily ported to external services

[27-Oct-19 07:45 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
now imagine you see as payment BCH QR code - you just click it using Atomic DEX app - already got step 1 done - outgoing params and instantly get the options from your wallet (and the taking the qr code shot could fire step 1 and 2 instantly), then you click selected option (pay if succesful) and see the feedback (paid or updated form in case of bigger fluctuation just happened)

[27-Oct-19 07:45 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
that would be an ultimate payment app

It's the same core but atomicdex is a premium gui on top of the core network

To be listed on the atomicdex gui there is a listing fee

You also have to have SPV or an equivalent

CRW is an open community, anyone can submit a proposal for anything in the project. I’m interested to get CRW in  AtimicDex through a proposal.

Hi, in your Medium article on FSM  it says `For blockchains with DTO...`, what is the DTO that Komodo uses?  It wouldn't be a  tx, as all blockchains have that, would it?

Decentralized trustless oracles (DTO) by piggybacking on timestamp...
Trustless oracles are quite a difficult problem, at least it was until I came up with a simple method that implements them.

[02-Nov-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
@CrisF jl777.com is quite useful

[02-Nov-19 08:10 AM] CrisF#3405
This brings me back to a question from #cc-oracles.
I've been going to conferences, presentations and talks over the last couple of months and Oracles are mentioned often, as something new.  One project made their full presentation on them at the start of blockchain week explaining how they were making theirs. Pretty much all Ethereum-based projects.  The audience was impressed.
Your post is from April and we tested Oracles in Labs over a year ago (Smk762 created DragonHound).
Are they really that far behind, or am I missing something?

[02-Nov-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
why is it surprising komodo is years ahead?

[02-Nov-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
having the core code is just the start though, you need the docs and then GUI and end user services, all those require a lot of time and effort, but without the core functionality, no amount of docs and GUI can make an end user service

[02-Nov-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
if only komodo had hundred million to spend, then we could make a dozen projects worth of end user services, all decentralized.

[02-Nov-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
if you look at my jl777.com in detail, you will see that i have written about a large spectrum of blockchain tech and a lot of this has been in komodo for years, i just didnt bother to blog it till about six months ago

[02-Nov-19 08:26 AM] Sarahz#0662
Oracle can be implemented to blockchain kmd

[02-Nov-19 08:26 AM] Sarahz#0662
?

[02-Nov-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
from a blog post detailing a design, to working code to user friendly GUI and working end user service, that might take a year or two, but fundamentally, all the blockchain level issues are solved

[02-Nov-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
all smartchains can have oracles enabled, DTO is a separate mechanism that requires a custom chain for specific oracle feeds

[02-Nov-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo uses a multichain architecture so we can scale without having any single dapp bogging down the entire ecosystem

[02-Nov-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
and yes, many oracles have already been implemented

[02-Nov-19 08:27 AM] Sarahz#0662
Good 👌

[02-Nov-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
DTO is the most reliable oracles resistant to fake data and it forms the basis of several other solutions, like the decentralized stablecoins, whose conversion price is based on DTO, all blockchain based

[02-Nov-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
we are working on an improvement that will allow any publicly avaiable api endpoint to be used as the source of the data. this then goes through a process to minimize the impact of biasing attacks and creates a consensus 24 hour price that is used for settlements

[02-Nov-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
still a bit of custom code will be needed to parse the data from an arbitrary feed, but that is all that would need to be done, so once that release is out, i expect we can see a lot more DTO chains. built in support for 32 fiats, binance cryptos and stockmarket prices, so for most prices the support is already there. maybe we need to document it better. @gcharang

That's my lack of perspective. Now I'm getting out and researching what business is looking for in gaining a clearer picture of where we are. I thought that big business would have more of a clue than I do.  
I've asked a few times to different people if Komodo is interested in corporate inquiries but not had a response. 
Opportunities to be had in my location.

Would you be adding aPow to DEX an SN chains? (these 2 are stalled right now)
Now that DEX is in atomicDEX it's not good to have 2-3 hour or more block time due to someone bumping the chain diff by mining it for tx fees

From agama, how many can you mine at the same time by setgenerate?

[02-Nov-19 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_will unstick them in a little while if no one else gets to it 1st_

[02-Nov-19 01:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Only one chain per instance prolly?

[02-Nov-19 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw, DEX and SN were GPU mined a ton when BarterDex was actively being used

[02-Nov-19 01:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Could be a good idea to teach the general public they can mine AC’s themselves from agama

[02-Nov-19 01:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Plenty of people that wouldnt mind spending some company time and power running a full node at work 😃

[02-Nov-19 01:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And getting some tiny DEX’s here and there

[02-Nov-19 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Cryptoon most ACs are "on demand" which means that absent a transaction in the mempool Agama will not mine the chains no matter what you tell it

[02-Nov-19 01:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But once a block enters the mempool agama can mine it, right?

[02-Nov-19 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
transaction, not block

[02-Nov-19 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
on-demand chains, by default, do not have empty blocks

[02-Nov-19 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
blocks are only created when there's a demand for a block (when a transaction needs to be processed)

[02-Nov-19 01:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok, but the cpu running agama wont run at however % if there are no tx presenting themselves?

[02-Nov-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There is special software to "get around" that, but that's how it's designed to work

[02-Nov-19 01:15 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
@Cryptoon in Agama you could mine with any native wallet simultaneously. I can't say it'll be efficient though

[02-Nov-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but the cpu running agama wont run at however % if there are no tx presenting themselves?`
correct, no tx = no mining

[02-Nov-19 01:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Only when a tx present itself a block needs to be solved and agama will boost cpu to solve it?

[02-Nov-19 01:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok cool

It doesn't "boost" it, it literally just waits for a tx before doing anything

Boost probably wrong choice of words

[02-Nov-19 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's not an answer to the original question, but....
If chains do get stuck because of diff, there are several of use that can "unstick" them; one just needs to ask...
