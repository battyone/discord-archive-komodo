[21-Jul-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
is BTC a stablecoin?

[21-Jul-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
people have BTC on exchanges to trade it for other things

[21-Jul-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
this gives BTC a lot of value, as almost everything can be traded for BTC at the best spreads

[21-Jul-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
and in crypto, trading is the only proven high volume activity

[21-Jul-19 10:07 AM] acidbird#7266
Hmm, well, this sounds reasonable

[21-Jul-19 10:07 AM] acidbird#7266
But still a way for us to go üòä

[21-Jul-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, atomicDEX needs to get traction

[21-Jul-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
we need the KMD liquidity

[21-Jul-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
but with all the mandatory KYC, it could be that atomicDEX is the only place without the KYC...

[21-Jul-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
so KMD would only be for people who like to trade without KYC and get 5% while waiting for good prices on the orderbooks

[21-Jul-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
and the ecosystem currency

[21-Jul-19 10:08 AM] acidbird#7266
But can‚Äôt they block the app if they decide to change the rules? Regulators

[21-Jul-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
and for whatever other benefits ecosystem projects give to KMD, we see a lot of projects give preference to KMD, even though it isnt required

[21-Jul-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
they can block atomicDEX as well as they can block torrents

[21-Jul-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
how is that working out for them?

[21-Jul-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
will they start prosecuting grandma and their voters?

[21-Jul-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
for bartering

[21-Jul-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
its not even copyright infringement, which they couldnt stop

[21-Jul-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a common law right to barter what you own

[21-Jul-19 10:10 AM] acidbird#7266
Noone knows but it is easier to block an app  or website then a torrent

[21-Jul-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
at worst we need to host the download, maybe via torrent

[21-Jul-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
in any case, atomicDEX is in the regulation safe harbor according to the latest guidance

[21-Jul-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
they realized they cant make grandma have to get a money transmitter license for bartering

[21-Jul-19 10:12 AM] acidbird#7266
Yeah, i saw the guidelines, we are good so far, hopefully will get out of beta soon

[21-Jul-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
also if the only problem is that atomicDEX gets too big that regulators are paying attention,then it is like bitmex

[21-Jul-19 10:12 AM] acidbird#7266
And shake the market üòé

[21-Jul-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
by then it is way too late

[21-Jul-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
as atomicDEX grows, the first thing people will realize is that all the markets are in KMD

[21-Jul-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
what will they do?

[21-Jul-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
ERC20 all require ETH, so they are DOA as the base trading pair

[21-Jul-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
what other coin will have the liquidity on atomicDEX AND pay 5%?

[21-Jul-19 10:14 AM] acidbird#7266
This logic is good, i like it, when we get there KMD will be doing great

[21-Jul-19 10:14 AM] acidbird#7266
I love 5,1%, it is a great idea.

[21-Jul-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
also, for non-ecosystem coins, nSPV wont work

[21-Jul-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
which means they need to rely on the electrum servers or normal headers only SPV

[21-Jul-19 10:15 AM] acidbird#7266
Hmm, i didn‚Äôt know that, good point

[21-Jul-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
the reality is that there will be occasional maintenance issues with electrum servers and headers only SPV is actually quite slow, compared to nSPV

[21-Jul-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD will be the only top coin with nSPV

[21-Jul-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
at least until other ecosystem coins become a top coin

[21-Jul-19 10:16 AM] acidbird#7266
How far away are we from this?

[21-Jul-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
#dev-nspv

[21-Jul-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
i already have a proof of concept working, the fullnode support is in jl777 branch already

[21-Jul-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a non-hardfork update

[21-Jul-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
realistically, by end of year to get the atomicDEX with nSPV support, but by then it is iterated many times from all the feedback

[21-Jul-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
trading within the ecosystem will then be able to scale basically without limits (other than blockchain capacity)

[21-Jul-19 10:18 AM] acidbird#7266
Great, will check it out. ok James, it was nice chatting with you, thank you for answers and info, have a great rest of the day! Cheers!

[21-Jul-19 04:50 PM] willofleo#7505
"atomicDEX listing $700 per year, atomicDEX Mobile Wallet Listing $1500 per year" what is the difference between atomicdex listings and atomicdex mobile , I mean if your listed on atomic dex api then you should be on mobile no? and I guess some project dont need to pay any fee  like coins in the top 30 e.g as they  can bring in volume you just added them already

[21-Jul-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
desktop vs desktop+mobile, i believe is the difference

[21-Jul-19 04:59 PM] willofleo#7505
does the gui set the price ?

[21-Jul-19 05:00 PM] willofleo#7505
or this is at an api level  meaning only payed project as allowed to list on the gui ?

[21-Jul-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
you are confusing general atomicDEX listings with composer

[21-Jul-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
not all coins will be via composer

[21-Jul-19 05:01 PM] willofleo#7505
oh I see this only applies to composer project using antara to make their blockchain

[21-Jul-19 05:02 PM] willofleo#7505
hence launching on DEX will incur a fee

[21-Jul-19 05:03 PM] willofleo#7505
makes sense if it a one time fee, I can not imagine delistings of a very good project that brings in volume

[21-Jul-19 05:04 PM] willofleo#7505
cant*

[21-Jul-19 07:24 PM] Neko#5830
so what will happen after all the kmd is mined, the main security will be off the BTC network ?

[21-Jul-19 07:39 PM] PHBA2061#2530
there will be a tail emission of 2 KMD , then 1 KMD. Source: https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/521735824300310539/529283483244429322

Hi, I tried to run Agama on an raspi 3b.
Tried with ubuntu 18, suse, kubuntu, pi64 and so on... nothing works for me.
You  have an idea?
It would be a big step in decentralization direction, for my understanding if every hardware can participate

[22-Jul-19 10:21 AM] Regnar#6164
@vogelfreund88 there's a guide for setting it up on Nodl, so it's possible on 64bit hardware idk about the older raspberry Pi but the 4 I think could support it. Maybe someone else will chime in on this too.

@vogelfreund88  What is the raspi features?

[22-Jul-19 02:55 PM] Paro#7842
raspi does not work under 3b +.

[22-Jul-19 02:56 PM] Paro#7842
Runs on Armv8-a (64-bit) architecture.

the raspberry pi 4 right now does not have a true 64 bit OS released for it so regardless of its processor it is a no go

[22-Jul-19 03:04 PM] radix42#3743
well, with enough RAM, I'd recommend a 4 gig RAM board

[22-Jul-19 03:05 PM] radix42#3743

but no mining. It is warming up. 70 to 80 degrees.

[22-Jul-19 03:07 PM] radix42#3743
yeah you wouldn't wanna mine on these small boards

[22-Jul-19 03:07 PM] Paro#7842
so it is only used as "staking".

[22-Jul-19 03:07 PM] Paro#7842
or "explorer".

[22-Jul-19 03:07 PM] radix42#3743
well when your wallet is on one of these type of boards its not on a PC where its vulnerable to god knows what

Hi do you need manually change all the fee from atomicdex to komodo? Right now there is like 20 coins in the DEX add but when there is more coins add that could be a very tedious job if it's done manually.

[25-Jul-19 04:34 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I‚Äôm sure our devs can make a way to automate the process ,  some custom tradebot or something ,  users won‚Äôt have to worry about it though

[25-Jul-19 09:17 AM] hastrup#8742
@polycryptoblog i just thought that jl brain power could be used on something more productive then sitting manually and trading the coins to komodo XD.

[25-Jul-19 09:18 AM] crumb#2550
rest assured, James has thought of that üòÉ

[25-Jul-19 09:20 AM] CHMEX#0686
With enough liquidity the fees can be sent to a BOB which will sell it automaticly if somebody wants it

[25-Jul-19 09:21 AM] CHMEX#0686
I would think its just a matter of sending the collected fees to that bob which can be automated.  So should not take him the whole day selling it üôÉ
