@jl777 so notaries have access to blocks of every asset chain in entire tree they verify the header hash and then create a momom hash and stick it in every asset chain including the same hash rooted to kmd chain?

[28-Sep-18 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, notaries are all running KMD and the assetchains they are notarizing. the KMD instance maintains the MoMoM out of all the MoM hashes being notarized and sends back to the notarizer the MoMoM to use

[28-Sep-18 09:47 PM] sidhujag#3327
how are funds protected from double spends? its a new concept to me is it similar to eths merkle root for balances of plasma chains?

[28-Sep-18 09:49 PM] sidhujag#3327
ok so after block gets created kmd then sends the final momom hash to stick into next  assetchain block?

[28-Sep-18 09:53 PM] jl777c#5810
the MoMoM are being sent in via notarizations, and once notarized the block cant be reorged

[28-Sep-18 09:53 PM] jl777c#5810
if it cant be reorged, it cant be double spent

[28-Sep-18 09:53 PM] sidhujag#3327
the notaries can withhold?

[28-Sep-18 09:54 PM] sidhujag#3327
whats the recourse? being voted out? so what if aggregate value to withhold or to modify hash is greator than the bonded value and fees?

[28-Sep-18 09:55 PM] sidhujag#3327
is there BFT on the notarization layer

[28-Sep-18 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
there needs to be a consensus on the current hashes

[28-Sep-18 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
notarization uses a stochastic process that converges toward a majority consensus value

[28-Sep-18 09:59 PM] sidhujag#3327
are notaries chosen using a quorum or all of them are tasked every block?

[28-Sep-18 09:59 PM] sidhujag#3327
is 64 a magic number or dynamic grows?

[28-Sep-18 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
annual election by KMD stake weight for 64 notaries

[28-Sep-18 10:03 PM] sidhujag#3327
so in any block the aggregate value should be below some amount to avoid notary from becoming bad actor?

[28-Sep-18 10:04 PM] sidhujag#3327
or does the consensus on the hashes take care of that thus the trust is distributed to 32+1 notaries?

[28-Sep-18 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no notarization unless there is consensus

[28-Sep-18 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
only 13 nodes sign each notarization, but it is based on a 64 node consensus

[28-Sep-18 10:07 PM] sidhujag#3327
cool.. is there a fundamental num of asset chains where it gets hard for notaries to do their work? it seems notaries need to store all that data across all nodes and that can become an issue.. i guess plasma does fraud proofs instead and exit to parent chain

[28-Sep-18 10:07 PM] jl777c#5810
most assetchains are pretty small

[28-Sep-18 10:08 PM] jl777c#5810
we are working on ways to have multiple nodes per notary

[28-Sep-18 10:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but the notarization process has been made pretty efficient so hundred(s) of chains can be notarized on a node, if all the coins can be run

[28-Sep-18 10:09 PM] sidhujag#3327
each chain would be its own dapp no?

[28-Sep-18 10:09 PM] sidhujag#3327
like an identity chain for example

[28-Sep-18 10:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the idea is that each chain localizes its activity to that chain alone

[28-Sep-18 10:10 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe a few related dapps are running on it, but the sharding is automatic, things are never combined into a single chain so we dont have the problem of needing to shard

[28-Sep-18 10:11 PM] sidhujag#3327
wait dapps are sharded across assetchains?

[28-Sep-18 10:11 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[28-Sep-18 10:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean the concept of sharding is not needed

[28-Sep-18 10:11 PM] jl777c#5810
the data is automatically already "sharded"

[28-Sep-18 10:11 PM] sidhujag#3327
oh ok yea

[28-Sep-18 10:11 PM] sidhujag#3327
same as plasma chain

[28-Sep-18 10:11 PM] jl777c#5810
sharding is only needed as everything is combined together and it needs to be split apart

[28-Sep-18 10:12 PM] jl777c#5810
with assetchains, nothing is combined together into a single chain

[28-Sep-18 10:12 PM] jl777c#5810
just the notarizations are sent to KMD

[28-Sep-18 10:12 PM] jl777c#5810
and a LOT of chains can be notarized to KMD

[28-Sep-18 10:13 PM] sidhujag#3327
right.. no its cool stuff im proud of you to follow through man.. ive had some more time to read what you guys did

[29-Sep-18 12:59 AM] lukechilds#2707
Hey @jl777c currently implementing KMD interest claiming for Ledger, are you able to give me a solid breakdown of the interest/reward consensus rules.

As far as I'm aware it's based on the coinage of any UTXO over 10 KMD. The UTXO value is multiplied by coinage which is then mulitpleied by a specific number to result in the 5% apr.

I'm aware there was also a recent change that caps the interest amount once per month.

I'm assuming age is estimated approximately by number of blocks, so in pseudo code it would be something like:

```
const  interestPerBlock = <interest%earned every block>
let interestAmount = UTXOamount * coinage * interestPerBlock;
const interestAmount = Math.min(interestAmount, maxMonthlyInterest);
```

Is that more or less correct? I need to get this exactly correct to not violate network consensus rules. Feel free to point me to any docs if this is aleady documented in detail.

Cheers

[29-Sep-18 01:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
Perfect @Alright thanks

[29-Sep-18 01:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
a few Qs

[29-Sep-18 01:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
possibly noob Q

[29-Sep-18 01:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
```
to be eligible it needs to be more than an hour old, have nLockTime in the tx set to be a valid timestamp
```
is nLockTime already set on all normal P2PKH transactions?

[29-Sep-18 01:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
```
the times between the current block and the utxo's nLockTime are subtracted and divided by 60 to convert it to minutes
```
Does this mean the time is measured as "blocks since TX had 1 confirmation = 1 minute"

[29-Sep-18 01:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
```
rewards once accrued doesnt go down as minutes since nLockTime never goes down, only up
```
can you expand on this statement?

[29-Sep-18 01:13 AM] Alright#0419
nlocktime needs to be set explicitly if you're creating the raw txs yourself

[29-Sep-18 01:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
```
the rewards amount stops after one year
after one year, the rewards are still all there, the principal value is still there, it never goes away, even after 77 years
there is all sorts of misinformation, stuff like you have to transfer funds every year or you lose your funds, that is nonsense
```
slightly confused by this.
So if I have a 10 KMD UTXO that's 1 year old I get 5% interest.
If I have a 10 KMD that's 2 years old, I still only get 5% interest beacuse it's capped
What if I claim my interest after 1 year. Can I reclaim the next year to get anther 5%

[29-Sep-18 01:13 AM] Alright#0419
the daemon will do it for sendmany and sendtoaddress though

[29-Sep-18 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
that's outdated, it's 1 month now

[29-Sep-18 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
but like

[29-Sep-18 01:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
I believe it's only 1 month for UTXOs past block 1000000

[29-Sep-18 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[29-Sep-18 01:15 AM] Alright#0419
you can claim again after a month, hope that answers your question

[29-Sep-18 01:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
not quite, I need a 100% accurate spec for this so I can implement it perfectly, otherwise interest claims will get rejected from the network

[29-Sep-18 01:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
but you have been very helpful

[29-Sep-18 01:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c are you able to provide this?

[29-Sep-18 01:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
I have been reading through the source and found `komodo_interestnew()` and `komodo_accrued_interest()` which look relevent but I could really do with a concrete specifiaction in writing

[29-Sep-18 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
use komodo_interestnew()

[29-Sep-18 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the (chaintip->nTime - nLocktime) is the elapsed time

[29-Sep-18 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
for specific utxo you can do gettxout and it prints "interest" field (I didnt change it for technical backward compatibility reasons)

[29-Sep-18 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
needs to be >= 10 KMD

[29-Sep-18 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
of course needs nLockTime set, else you cant calculate elapsed time

[29-Sep-18 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
must be over an hour as 59 minutes are subtracted from elapsed time

[29-Sep-18 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo_interestnew() is about 10 lines of code

[29-Sep-18 11:09 AM] ted#5473
what do you think about veriblock?recentlly,the FLO team want to ues veriblock solution to solve 51% attack,they think veriblock is better than kmd.

Proof-of-Proof ...

[29-Sep-18 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems BTC is most secure, but I am glad vericoin team is making new alternatives. not everyone can afford dPoW

[29-Sep-18 11:21 AM] ted#5473
The problem with the KMD solution is that the FLO community cannot participate in running a notary node because:
1. Voting in a notary node happens once a year and only a few of them are re-elected
2. Voting in a notary node requires voting with KMD

The FLO community should not be required to also buy and hold KMD to vote on a node to be able to have a small amount of control over the network. Anyone   can participate in the VBK network at any time
Unless I'm mistaken, GAME credits was the first coin to implement the dPoW algorithm, and they've only been using it for 2 or 3 months

[29-Sep-18 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
to my knowledge, nobody in the KMD community has any significant BTC hashrate. we dont control the BTC network in anyway, yet we still utilize BTC security

[29-Sep-18 11:23 AM] ted#5473
yes,they said that.@jl777c

[29-Sep-18 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
why would they want to be controlling notary nodes? the idea is to not have to worry about such things

they said Still in discussion with KMD devs

[29-Sep-18 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
they wanted duke to basically work for free

[29-Sep-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
the design is that each chain takes care of making its own blocks. having one coin controlling another coin doesnt sound so good, so making that some sort of requirement is strange. if they need that then it is better they use a different solution

[29-Sep-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
it is like not using bitcoin since bitcoin wont let you mine some percentage of blocks

[29-Sep-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
oh wait, you could

[29-Sep-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
just as they could mine KMD blocks, or become notaries. they just dont want to pay for it

[29-Sep-18 11:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ted 
>The problem with the KMD solution is that the FLO community cannot participate in running a notary node because:
this logic incorrect.

Every assetchain in a project or every other 3rd party blockchain (hush, verushash, gamecredits, etc) don't need to participate in notary node elections.
But to pay for their assetchain notarisation. even a community member can donate for an yearly notarisation or a community fund can probably do that. aprox of 300 kmd per year I don't think is huge cost to save a blockchain worth multi thousand/million/billion against 51% attack.

[29-Sep-18 11:33 AM] ted#5473
so they think veriblock is better,and i think many other teams which want to use kmd solution,also worry about those problems

[29-Sep-18 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
making it a requirement to have one or more notary nodes to utilize the dPoW service, this is a totally unreasonable thing

[29-Sep-18 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
if that cannot be understood, then it is ok that they use something else

[29-Sep-18 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
they can just setup their own notary nodes, and pay for BTC txfees themselves

[29-Sep-18 11:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if every new blockchain utilising dPoW notarisation required to have a notary node of their own, there probably would have need of 1000s of notary nodes. doesn't make sense.
only 64 notary nodes.
community elect with their token weight power
notaries don't hold the power to change or manipulate a blockchain
only thing these notaries can do is just send the transaction and do notarisation.

[29-Sep-18 11:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's a little power.

you don't want to hold your money on a backing account with web access without a 2 factor authentication.

just expect that to be this day or another compromised if there isn't a 2fa

[29-Sep-18 11:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
dPoW is similar effect like 2fa

The problem with the KMD solution is that the FLO community cannot participate in running a notary node because:
1. Voting in a notary node happens once a year and only a few of them are re-elected
```
Yes they can participate.  Get voted in.  This is part of any voting process.
```
2. Voting in a notary node requires voting with KMD
```
Voting in the elections is one part of the KMD ecosystem.  If you want to vote, be a part of it by getting KMD around that time of year.  The Vote coin gets airdroped to holders of KMD.  It is a community process.  How else can a community process be voted on?
```
The FLO community should not be required to also buy and hold KMD to vote on a node to be able to have a small amount of control over the network. 
```
Nobody is controlling anything.  Notary nodes don't control anything.  They notarize.  The voting process is how it is, if you think there is a better way, please submit details of a better way.

[29-Sep-18 11:51 AM] Mylo#8306
You actually don't need to hold any KMD.  Just run for elections and get votes from the KMD community - ultimately KMD community decides.
