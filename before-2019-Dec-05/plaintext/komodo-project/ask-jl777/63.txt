couldnt find any

[30-Apr-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
so I built komodo

[30-Apr-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
now other devs like me can have komodo to build on

[30-Apr-19 05:44 PM] jorian#4555
for which we are eternally grateful

Komodo (9) 

[30-Apr-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
so i guess that is the "Guy"

[30-Apr-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
other devs like me that dont want to be locked into a platform, but still have a platform that takes care of all the mundane details

[30-Apr-19 05:45 PM] artik123#2884
I know the whole story, been in bitcointalk about the time that you have also in Nxt

[30-Apr-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if we can get just 6, that is likely more development power than other projects with millions in funding

[30-Apr-19 05:45 PM] artik123#2884
letter of independence and stuff I remember all

[30-Apr-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
we need smart devs who dont like to pay a platform tax

[30-Apr-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
a lot of the trader types want us to add KMD tax so there is some "use" for KMD, not understanding that the more it costs, the more likely they would just fork KMD or use a different project

in open source, you need to be the best

[30-Apr-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
and free

[30-Apr-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
then it gets adopted and improved and becomes better

[30-Apr-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
until it gets invaded by politics...

[30-Apr-19 05:53 PM] artik123#2884
lets continue tomorrow... 
you have taken a different route without lock-in, other than thinking about a moat. . it's a different approach than most projects.

[30-Apr-19 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i take the approach that goodwill will be worth a lot more than temporary lockin

[30-Apr-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
in any case, companies that use komodo tech are free to devise their own business models, as komodo doesnt constrain them

[30-Apr-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems this is the lowest barrier to entry and would maximize adoption

[30-Apr-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe in 10 to 20 years, we can worry about monetizing things to continue to pay for the BTC txfees

Re miketout building on kmd

[30-Apr-19 10:43 PM] artik123#2884
If we take the linux example, is it definitely not a good use for a average joe PC user. windows is much suitable. 
I might say that it is most useful for a technical guys using it as a hobby, 
other target audience would be companies that develop embedded software or some other linux derivatives. 


I've scattered around the examples you gave, and they were good sources! of komodo potential customers...
1. developers that don't have large dev teams and also wish to save a lot of time (miketout example)
2. developers that care about freedom and don't like to be taxed. (things you also mentioned)
3. ?

(mentioning developers twice might suggest that it is a primary a B2B infrastructure platform? meaning that the primary customers are businesses/developers?
and they will create B2C products?)


the reason that I mentioned the bitcoin generator, is that for some people, a zero cost blockchain generator 
(especially PoS chains. with PoW he still needs komodo's security) with very basic parameters, 
that would probably appear in the future for every major project, will make the cut for some people. 
this and a multi million mature ecosystem that he could take advantage of.

I understand that komodo is on a different level. 
I'm just trying to have a clear view of the trade-offs of someone standing at this critical decision point.
and I think that people here should also have a clear view of that, so they could address it in the best way possible.


Moreover, every project/company should first have their own understanding their own dna.

Based on your own story with Nxt which led to the creation of this project, I think that the branding should be based around the word 'freedom'
freedom to create, freedom to use, freedom from taxes etc...
first thing that has to come in mind when someone thinks about komodo is the word 'freedom'.

[30-Apr-19 10:43 PM] artik123#2884
Secondly, I think that story telling is extremely important. 
people live and die on stories. many people still remember the story of microsoft, apple etc.
you could have a story of how we got here ( the lost of millions... and the breakout from Nxt it makes a good story... also help him to understand why he shouldn't use or be under the policies of others...) tailored by a branding story teller.
(let me give you some examples... the anonymous story of satoshi nakamoto 
(and the media attention it got based on his mysterious anonymity, for every project it worth its weight in gold..., 
silly wow story of dogecoin, silver vs gold story of litecoin etc... last 2 would be worthless without the story)

[30-Apr-19 10:43 PM] artik123#2884
In geo politics the things that have led to a very successful countries are:
AAA people, good education system and both political and economical inclusive institutions. open and merit based society.
if you have these properties, the chances of success are huge.
in komodo terms the first 2 would primary mean, I think, top developers and good tutorials of everything both for developers and users or even to have an academy.
all in one place. step by step. categorized with video walkthroughs starting from beginners all the way up to creating a new cc module.


But at the end, ~200 countries are like ~200 experiments of competing values...

Why shouldn't komodo have a constitution? 
to be written what komodo's most adhere to, stands for, and what komodo core values are? the things that it will or will never do.
the things that it could guarantee forever to any new blockchain on the platform.

Maybe this could be the analogy:

life - security
liberty - freedom to control his own destiny
property rights - his own native coin

All to make it a more an easy to understand, and more cohesive project.

[01-May-19 01:59 AM] Mylo#8306
Last years website had freedom to .... freedom to .... freedom to .... with a video.

Komodo offers anyone to create their platform of multi chain and notary nodes.  It is a platform to create platforms.

[01-May-19 02:01 AM] Mylo#8306
Blockchain is not very approachable to regular ppl.  Currency was the first application of this tech - now it is more advanced currency applications.

[01-May-19 02:01 AM] Mylo#8306
Komodo aims to lower the barriers to adoption.

[01-May-19 02:03 AM] Mylo#8306
It is a multi-headed dragon.  The ecosystem is developing more approachable tech.

[01-May-19 02:06 AM] Mylo#8306
All your points are marketing points, maybe you'll get responses from marketing in #komodo-team  or #deleted-channel  and also follow the rebrand

[01-May-19 02:09 AM] Mylo#8306
Thanks for your long post.  It is all being worked on atm.  If you have a blog or social media perhaps you can create content with your experience and help us find ppl who would be curious with what komodo's potential is?

[01-May-19 07:19 AM] artik123#2884
@Mylo It goes deeper than that. 
It was about customer, identity, chances of success and values. do you think usa by knowing it's own values, is doing it for marketing purposes?

[01-May-19 07:25 AM] Mylo#8306

If you agree with me, then you should respond here 😃

[01-May-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
these are not tech issues, i will stay out of it

[01-May-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if it isnt a tech issue, there is no deterministic solution and it can be debated, literally forever and usually end up with two or more sides, totally convinced they are correct.

[01-May-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
there are not obvious compiler or linker errors to fix

[01-May-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
no algorithms to deal with

[01-May-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
non-deterministic

[01-May-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
others are tasked to deal with such issues, I do tech, that can be shown to work without debates

[01-May-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
just one question about end users and linux. how many android phones are there? none of those phones are used by any end users, is your position?

[01-May-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
osx is also arguably a close relative to linux, so apple products are not used by any end users either?

[01-May-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i think you are totally underestimating the pervasiveness of linux

[01-May-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and yes, I know there are many forks of linux that are not linux anymore, but my point is that without linux in the first place, they wouldnt exist

[01-May-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, and a large number of websites running linux, i guess those are all just hobbyists

[01-May-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
so we have a total disagreement about some fundamental things and if your position is that linux is just for hobbyists or embedded software companies, then it seems for you komodo can only be for a very small number of people, but to me I know komodo will allow crypto to be used by the masses. But the gap is too big when your position is that linux is just for hobbyists

[01-May-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
like i said, non-deterministic as shown by how you can believe linux cannot get end users

[01-May-19 08:37 AM] Hegelian#0018
Which version of linux do you think is the best?

[01-May-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no single best version, it all depends on what exactly you need most. the important thing is that regardless of what it is, odds are very good that there is an open source solution that is close to your problem

[01-May-19 09:54 AM] artik123#2884
No one thinks that there is a problem with the tech. the tech is light years a head of any other project.
but since you are founder of this project, you have the overall responsibility, oversight and success of the project. even if you're a tech guy!
and thats why this project is biased towards the tech. (if you were a product guy it would be probably biased towards the product etc.). it's doesn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just the way it is. end result, for each type of founder, there would be a different resource allocations.


Regarding the two sides of the debate, I disagree. would someone be convinced/argue that this project is not about freedom?


I think that there is a misunderstanding here...  why do you think that I'm trying to underestimate the project?
I think it has a huge potential. otherwise I wouldn't be here in the first place...
I just think that at the moment it doesn't get its right place and recognition.

Android is probably used by billion people, but what I said is that they are not the main customers of the creator of linux. same for intel
I specifically mentioned embedded software companies or some other linux derivatives (like andorid...).

[01-May-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
"since you are founder of this project, you have the overall responsibility, oversight and success of the project" <- no

[01-May-19 09:58 AM] artik123#2884
yes

[01-May-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
I do not want the project to be centralized around me

[01-May-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
I am just one person

[01-May-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
I can make technical decisions, that is my expertise. but all this non-deterministic things where the color and font matters, please leave me out of it. that is not my expertise

[01-May-19 10:00 AM] artik123#2884
I know... that's why I was talking about resource allocation. who is responsible of that?

[01-May-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
what resources?

[01-May-19 10:01 AM] artik123#2884
primarily money

[01-May-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
the managers are the ones that manage things. I am part of the escrow of funds, but mostly the others do the signing and release of it

[01-May-19 10:03 AM] artik123#2884
so they can decide how much the tech is funded about how much for other things?

[01-May-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
there is komodo the open source project

[01-May-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
that is separate from komodo team

[01-May-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
and for the independent companies, I have no direct control at all, though I have at times contributed

[01-May-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
i stay out of marketing

[01-May-19 10:05 AM] artik123#2884
I'm regarding how komodo team is funded and for what uses

[01-May-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
your concerns appear to be about marketing, you need to talk to marketing peoples

[01-May-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont directly get involved in the day to day issues of the komodo team. the funds needed are also provided from escrow

[01-May-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
ca333 and steve and bitcoinbenny deal with the komodo team stuff, talk to them about it

[01-May-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont know why you have this idea that it is a company that I am running. i am on the open source side of things and deal with all the code issues. that is enough work to do

[01-May-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
I cant appear in public, so I very well cant be the public spokesperson

[01-May-19 10:08 AM] artik123#2884
"i dont know why you have this idea that it is a company that I am running" - what happens if you leave?

[01-May-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
that is why I want things to be less centralized around me and have avoided anything non-technical as much as possible. If I left, there wouldnt be any changes at all outside the open source side of things. and for that we know have devs that are familiar with pretty much the entire codebase

[01-May-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly i could do things more efficiently in some cases, but nothing that existing devs couldnt figure out on their own if needed

[01-May-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont participate in team meetings

[01-May-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
i am not involved, so they are certainly not dependent on me

[01-May-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
I do have control over the last million KMD from the ICO, but that wont be lasting for much more than a year, the BTC is managed by the ICO escrows and I have never even signed the multisig, even though I am a signer

[01-May-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
in the last months I have shifted to training other devs to do CC and have started writing the blog to explain things in plain english

[01-May-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
I cant sustain 16 hours x 7 days per week for more than 5 years at a time. i need to reduce hours to recharge

[01-May-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
what position?

[01-May-19 10:16 AM] artik123#2884
leading a project, in your case the continuation of the tech involved

[01-May-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
the core tech is pretty much complete now. the rest is a matter to making customized CC, which is a matter to find a usecase and solving it

[01-May-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
and outside of core tech, my skills are much less valuable, as I only know C

[01-May-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont do anything about the build system, websites, etc. even the notary network others are advancing it, not me

[01-May-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
my value is really being overestimated.

[01-May-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810

in virtually every area now (even CC) for implementations and debugging, there is a dev that I usually go to in order to get the best result. I have been working to make myself obsolete for many years and finally it is becoming close. now that others can debug, isolate and fix problems and also code from scratch new ideas, overall productivity is going up a lot

[01-May-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
i can just come up with some crazy ideas now and again and others can make it real, so even if i reduce my hours to only 40hrs per week, i think the overall tech output will increase and its not like the marketing side has been able to keep up with the old level of production

[01-May-19 10:40 AM] artik123#2884
I think that it's a positive change

[01-May-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the heavy lifting is done. now it is time for others to push forward in all the areas, even tech

[01-May-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810

[01-May-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
that has been my goal all along, this is why i refuse to be involved in team stuff and dont want things centralized around me

[01-May-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
if people want komodo to become as successful as it has the potential to, everyone else needs to do their part. if you wait for me to do it all, you will wait forever

[01-May-19 10:52 AM] artik123#2884
"then I can become more a visionary who just write a blog and not do anything directly productive" - how close are we to that in your estimate?

[01-May-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a spectrum, likely it can happen almost immediately but that would cause a transition period, so better to slowly reduce my workload, which i have already done in the last month and nobody noticed!

[01-May-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
just look at #cc-prices, I came up with the idea, spent a few hours on a code outline and handed it off

[01-May-19 10:55 AM] artik123#2884
