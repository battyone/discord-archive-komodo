hey jl777 just a question about the 900MM RFOX sitting in SuperNET. Is that full amount in escrow to be released later on, or does a portion of that belong to SuperNET specifically?

[15-May-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
a small amount will go to SuperNET

I'd like to change something in Komodo but I don't know how to do it properly. Can you help me ?
Few months ago, a virus was injected in few yiimp pools. The BTC wallet was emptied by hacker.
Entry points were identified and fixed into yiimp but we wanted to add a kind of "condom" within bitcoin wallet code.
With existing options, some pools disabled broadcasting of tx and broadcast manually.
I performed few changes into bitcoin code (forbid to withdraw more than 1% of total balance with sendmany and sendtoaddress, forbid dumpprivkey and so on). Changes were tested successfully but with hardcoded values into sendmany and sendmoney
I tried to make it more clean (either use arguments at compilation OR use the coin.conf file) but my code doesn't work. I asked help to some bitcoin devs that I'm in contact with but they didn't help so much. They suggest to use a proxy in front of the coin node but it will reduce perfs and I'm not fan to use additional software
As my pool doesn't have bitcoin and only altcoins, I'm interested to have such a feature into komodo and other altcoins
I discussed it briefly with @metaphilibert he suggested to me to talk about it in public

I discussed this kind of changes with exchange guys and it seems that this kind of tiny change is well-known and used by big hot wallets. I'd like that this option becomes opensource whatever it is about changing 6 lines of codes (with hardcoded values, it is very short and obvious for many developers)

[15-May-19 11:07 PM] phm87#7395
Of course, give me few minutes to gather links. I'll show you some yiimp fixes but I won't show you the "how to reproduce the hack"

[16-May-19 01:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_would be in favor of someone writing such a change if it were non-intrusive and always off by default_

[16-May-19 03:24 AM] Mylo#8306
@phm87 check `src/komodo_utils.h` for the `GetArg()`s that are used to set some globals.   maybe you could make a command line arg `-max1pcsend` for maximum 1% send out.   and add your code from patches above within a check for this global being set in the functions you want to have this 1% send out restriction - `sendtoaddress, sendmany etc.`.

That would be my first attempt.    best asking in #dev-general , recently @blackjok3r james and a few others have added stuff.   the jl777 repo jl777 branch has some new stuff.   do a `grep -ril earlytxid` for some hints. 

ps i'm not a pro coder.

[16-May-19 04:51 AM] jl777c#5810
to make a custom version without some rpc calls, just comment out the lines in rpcserver.cpp

[16-May-19 04:51 AM] jl777c#5810
that way the custom daemon wont have the rpc call available

[16-May-19 04:52 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as limiting sendtoaddress, maybe enforcing a whitelist is a better way? that way only destinations that are already approved gets sent out

[19-May-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
no

[19-May-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
notarization is not payout

[19-May-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
better to use is payments CC snapshot option that does airdrops

[19-May-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
but that doesnt work crosschain and most revshares get crosschain revenues

Very ETH specific. We are thinking about making some standards (pretty much an extension/usage of cc-assets).

[28-May-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the notaries do

[28-May-19 03:43 PM] gcharang#6833
if you understand how lite wallets/spv work, you can see how komodo nodes will be able verify the pow that is backing up the notarised transactions without running btc nodes

[28-May-19 03:56 PM] Alexfrog#1338
hypothetically, if you didnt trust the notaries, would you need to have a synced btc blockchain?

[28-May-19 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, anybody can independently validate

[28-May-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
or you could use SPV servers

[28-May-19 05:26 PM] gcharang#6833
>  if you didnt trust the notaries
the other KMD nodes already don't trust the notaries, they verify(validate) every notarization done by notaries, if a notarization is found to validate consensus rules, it is rejected by the regular KMD nodes

When a coin upgrades to Komodo, I’m wondering about $THC in particular, are the current wallets forward compatible & the swap automatic? Or do you have to send coins to a centralized party who swaps them over manually?

"imo Bitcoin people have the most incentive and will power to effect the change that ripples out. potentially the most leverage due to sound money and decentralization. but if the leaders, who should know better, ignore the problems in the field, tail risks are increased. to conclude, the best marketing is to be aligned with the truth and selling to those who it resonates with. that means setting expectations properly and battling those who oversell and underdeliver for a quick buck."

its not like a bigger block chain uses a different mode of the CPU vs the small block, and legacy coin has big blocks, just as long as it is segwit

so can you definitely say that bigger blocks are not less secure than smaller blocks ?    i guess what i want to undertand is why blocksize doesnt matter if the blockz=size determines the amount of data stored...  if you would have a link to where i can read more about this topic id be amazing, ive been looking online but i havent found a resource

at some extremes too big of a block is not good
