Hmmm... Many kmd team members are starting their own projects or companies. How will that affect kmd in future. To me its seems that they wont have much time for kmd while running their own projects.

[19-Jun-18 01:52 PM] allbits#5898
Like Red Hat has no time for Linux?

[19-Jun-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the idea is to drive traffic and use onto KMD.

[19-Jun-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That can only be a good thing

[19-Jun-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You might not realise just how many people are now working on this lol.

the more independent companies and projects that use KMD, the more decentralzed it all becomes

[19-Jun-18 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
starting with the 64-way decentralizatoin via notary nodes

[19-Jun-18 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
each can grow to be its own mini-project for KMD

[19-Jun-18 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
if each team member made their own company around KMD, that seems a good thing

I hope the next election we can widdle teams down to no more than 2 notaries.

[19-Jun-18 02:17 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm with dwy on his stance of 1 notary 1 team.

[19-Jun-18 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
That's going to be tough with inter-cooperation of multiple teams.

[19-Jun-18 02:22 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Good point.

[19-Jun-18 02:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@ComputerGenie aren't you going to run for notary?

[19-Jun-18 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

If I ever get good enough code wise. To where I comfortably know I'd be able to keep up. I'd run, but I don't see that anytime soon I put in way too much time at my job to even focus much on anything outside of it.

[19-Jun-18 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I quit my job, only way to learn NN operations, although I started with almost zero linux experience. Its been quite a journey.

[19-Jun-18 03:25 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Maybe in the future right now I'm going to swallow up this bear market

[19-Jun-18 04:05 PM] Hegelian#0018
Hypothetically, if zksnarks was shown in the future to be faulty tech. Would it be easy for kmd to get rid of it?

[19-Jun-18 04:06 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Probably not but the only way it's faulty is if the trusted setu is compromised.

[19-Jun-18 04:07 PM] BlackJesus#6161
which has a very high probability of not have been compromised.

[19-Jun-18 04:07 PM] BlackJesus#6161
jl777 helped them with the first interation of zksnarks. Zcash that is.

[19-Jun-18 04:18 PM] Meyse#0952
is jumblr really as easy as it seems? lets forget backend for a second. In the frontend I basically would need 2 addressess where i hold the prkeys for? Send some coin to the deposit address and the coins will be jumblrd to the destination address. Is this right?

[19-Jun-18 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[19-Jun-18 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
i tried to make the api as easy to use as possible, how the addresses are managed is up to the caller.nothing is saved on disk (other than the ztx) so restart the daemon and no record of what you jumblred

[19-Jun-18 04:32 PM] Meyse#0952
thats cool, im doodling an easy to use gui for this

[19-Jun-18 04:37 PM] Meyse#0952
im wondering if theres a case if people would want to look back at some overview or status of what they jumblrd in a gui

[19-Jun-18 04:42 PM] Meyse#0952
so if i were to create a new seed with agama for example, i can use all of these addressess of different coins to jumblr all those different coins?

[19-Jun-18 04:43 PM] Meyse#0952
or are there limitations, some coins cant be jumblred?

[19-Jun-18 04:44 PM] Meyse#0952
or there needs to be a mm available in kmd for these coins?

[19-Jun-18 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
jumblr only works with KMD, we need to aggregate all the jumblr activity

[19-Jun-18 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
no need for mm or any other party

[19-Jun-18 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
single party tumbler

[19-Jun-18 04:57 PM] Meyse#0952
ah alright, so if i wanted to "jumblr" other coins, i would need to swap them to kmd first and then get the jumblr process started

[19-Jun-18 04:59 PM] Meyse#0952
in this whitepaper https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/JUMBLR-Whitepaper it says there is a btc layer, which does the swapping to kmd automatically

@Mylo thanks for the details. One more question. Who assigns the notary role? Meaning who enforces the results of a notary election?

[19-Jun-18 05:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@chinmaydshah it's in the komodo code

Notaries are hard coded?

[19-Jun-18 05:31 PM] chinmaydshah#6404
Jl777 committed those so I guess they do the final assignment

[19-Jun-18 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
in the current design, yes

[19-Jun-18 05:32 PM] chinmaydshah#6404
Or whoever can commit to it

[19-Jun-18 05:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
or whom ever can fork and get more followers than the initial repo

[19-Jun-18 05:32 PM] chinmaydshah#6404
Lol ye

[19-Jun-18 05:33 PM] chinmaydshah#6404
I guess that's fine bcz if they assume control of it they lose community support

[19-Jun-18 05:34 PM] chinmaydshah#6404
But to be decentralized I guess this bit needs to be part of the protocol.. notary elections, nominations and winning. Easier said than done

[19-Jun-18 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a reason half the notaries win automatic spots

[19-Jun-18 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
that way we have half the notaries that will adopt the new version, especially if some of the existing notaries win spots in the elections. There were some people worried about notaries not updating to the new election results, but there is no need to worry with half the spots being existing notaries, at a minimum

[19-Jun-18 09:50 PM] Meyse#0952
about jumblr, if you want to have maximum privacy, you have the choice to add more z -> z transactions? t -> z-> z -> z -> z -> t etc?

i'll check it out (Y)

[19-Jun-18 10:02 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
👍

[19-Jun-18 10:16 PM] Meyse#0952
wait, so lets say i want to jumblr BTC, it slowly swaps itself over time to KMD, then z -> z in KMD, then it swaps back to BTC?

[19-Jun-18 10:18 PM] Meyse#0952
or you use the runsilent API then it doesn't swap back to BTC but stays in KMD

[19-Jun-18 10:51 PM] Meyse#0952
but wait again, jl777 said "jumblr only works with KMD, we need to aggregate all the jumblr activity", other plans?

[20-Jun-18 12:26 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
the runsilent api doesnt complete the last sequence of the jumblr.   Switching back to btc is a function of the dex not of the jumblr

[20-Jun-18 03:27 AM] Hegelian#0018
What are the plans to increase bdex volume?

[20-Jun-18 05:31 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
pretty much broken down into 2 things,   1) recruit liquidity providers  2) make dex more noob friendly.

[20-Jun-18 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
you can jumblr funds that have already been jumblred

[20-Jun-18 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810
also if you use a barterDEX deposit address as a jumblr secret address

[20-Jun-18 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810
then you can barterDEX with jumblr funds that has no links

[20-Jun-18 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so you can directly get BTC without any historybtc

[20-Jun-18 04:05 PM] KillahJon#0036
i think bdex volume can increase if btch gets "advertised" more

[20-Jun-18 04:06 PM] KillahJon#0036
since it's only on coinexchange (barely any volume) and barterdex

[20-Jun-18 04:06 PM] KillahJon#0036
lots of BTC holders can sell their BTCH for "free" money

[20-Jun-18 05:47 PM] Alright#0419
you going to buy it from them?

[20-Jun-18 05:53 PM] KillahJon#0036
depends on the price

[20-Jun-18 05:54 PM] jorian#4555
Why would you buy it?

[20-Jun-18 05:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'll sell all my BTCh for a "free" 200 BTC

Is there a point to btch beyond just being a asset chain airdrop?

[21-Jun-18 10:11 AM] Hegelian#0018
I dont see how advertising it can increase bdex volume

[21-Jun-18 10:12 AM] Hegelian#0018
Only 2 mln bitcoin gold were claimed and it was over $400. Why would btc holder claim $0.20 btch? And that snapshot was so long ago anyways

You'll regret that decision 😛

[21-Jun-18 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
BTCH has as much point as  most of the other BTC forks, it also cloned the BTC utxo set with 250MB of space and it is secured by dPoW and inherits KMD codebase enhancements

[21-Jun-18 11:58 AM] Hegelian#0018
Yes but that is true of every other asset chain, no?

[21-Jun-18 11:59 AM] Hegelian#0018
It shows good way to do airdrop but what reason is there to use it?

[21-Jun-18 12:00 PM] Hegelian#0018
In fact I had btch before and it took me all day to make deposit to coinexchange because I look on explorer and there were hours without a single transaction

[21-Jun-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
what reason to use any of the BTC forks? you can always do some very small tx to get the blocks generating

[21-Jun-18 12:08 PM] Hegelian#0018
Yes, that is what I did, sent the same amount to myself every 5 minutes. As for why use any of the forks, the user here was saying to promote btch to get volume and I said how could it bring volume when it has $2 of volume on coinexchange and isnt even on coinmarketcap

[21-Jun-18 12:09 PM] Hegelian#0018
I just mean I think promoting btch to get traffic for bdex is not the best idea, nothing more

[21-Jun-18 12:10 PM] Hegelian#0018
Oh, I'm sorry he actually said promote to get more btc holder to claim. And I dont see that happening. One btch is worth how much a btc in percentage terms? Most bitcoin gold was left unclaimed and it was $400

[21-Jun-18 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
as far as BTCH goes I think it needs to come up with some specific use case first, if it doesnt, then it wont have any specific use case and while that is ok for coins with a p+d team behind it, we dont do such things

[21-Jun-18 06:12 PM] Hegelian#0018
Yes a use-case. And also something that worries me about btch is that cryptopia controls address to 800k plus btch. That's fine now but I'd be worried if price ever went up

[21-Jun-18 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
at least you always have something to worry about

[21-Jun-18 06:23 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
cryptopia is the last CEX I'd worry about, them doing something with btch would entail them doing something

I have a question about the future of these chain clusters. Let's say there is a cluster that is a national currency. Let's say large companies would each have their own chain.(at least this is how I understand it would work) How would a new company add their new chain to the cluster? Just consensus by the notaries to start notarizing it?

[22-Jun-18 09:53 AM] Hegelian#0018
In the long term I am worried what if there are major vulnerabilities found with zk-snarks? Wouldn't that mean the coin with zksnarks should be abandoned? If the solution in such a case to do airdrop of new coin for holders?

[22-Jun-18 09:53 AM] Hegelian#0018
I'm thinking 5 10 15 years in future

[22-Jun-18 09:55 AM] Hegelian#0018
And the 5% reward for kmd, where do those coins come from?
