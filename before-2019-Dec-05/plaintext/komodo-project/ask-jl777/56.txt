I have whichever kind of KMD wif you want and the goal is to get the BTC wif

[30-Mar-19 05:00 AM] Alright#0419
it's outputting something that starts with `L`, yes?

[30-Mar-19 05:00 AM] Alright#0419

it uses random selection to not notarize... it just provides a way for nodes to select between forks, nothing about it enforces the already existing chain and if a chain adopts this, the attacker could make his chain be the one that is preferred

[30-Mar-19 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
veriblock is just so inefficient to try to do the same thing as dPoW and since it is decentralized there are no controls on it, other than mining profits. Not exactly the best way to secure a chain

I just received an email from bittrex with this "We are excited to that Bittrex International will host an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) of VeriBlock's VBK coin beginning at 9:00am PDT (4:00pm UTC) on April 2. VeriBlock and its novel Proof-of-Proof ("PoP") consensus protocol is the first and only technology in the world to allow any blockchain to inherit Bitcoin's unprecedented thermodynamic Proof-of-Work security in an entirely Decentralized, Trustless, Transparent and Permissionless ("DTTP") manner." Isn't "PoP" a clone of "dPow"?

I read one of Bittrex guys is invested in Veriblock and thus they do the IEO there

PoP isn't a clone of dPoW, the scope is similar but it's a lot more costly and less secure

[30-Mar-19 07:30 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's open to anyone to participate rather than a selection of elected nodes, for this reason they wrote 'Permissionless' but as jl777 said this is actually an attack vector

[30-Mar-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
oh and it costs at least 10x more, might be 100x more

[30-Mar-19 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
on a typical day dPoW does 100 to 120 BTC transactions
veriblock 100,000+ ??? so it seems it is 1000x more transactions (even accounting for lighter weight per tx), it is just a poor design.

[30-Mar-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
I guess the fact that even after 2.5 years, the first real alternative to dPoW is much less efficient (without any debate) and its security level is still remaining to be seen. I would have thought that after all this time, something that was at least equivalent to dPoW might be made, but so far it seems not. And when the BTC txfee kicks in the cost per veriblock tx will go up which will need to be paid by the chains using it, so from an estimated 1% of mining rewards, it goes up with the fee market.

[30-Mar-19 04:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I read in the assetchain parameter docs that the cap for ac_perc  is 1 million coins, is this a hard cap due to an overflow possibility or is it just an arbitrarily chosen amount?

[31-Mar-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
I read somewhere that veriblock "protected" chains dont have to make any code changes and "just" need to allocate some percentage of blockreward to the PoP miners. Is this really true? If so, then it seems there is no protection at all to the altcoin as it wont even be looking at the external reference hashes. I guess it would allow a postmortem analysis of how the 51% attack violated the VBK hashes. Is there any definite answer to whether VBK provides 51% protection and if the altcoin needs to make code changes?

[31-Mar-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
It cant be that altcoin miners are subsidizing the VBK bitcoin spam in order to not get any 51% protection, as that is what their main claim. Which would mean that the altcoin must make codechanges. So one of those two things must be wrong

[31-Mar-19 10:56 AM] Mark81#4505
Link to veriblock whitepaper.

[31-Mar-19 11:02 AM] Mark81#4505
'''To determine which blockchain to accept, the score for each block at each index is calculated 
relative to the other block at the same index, and the scores for all blocks on each chain are 
added together: The first PoP publication for either competing block at fork index 0 was at 
index 1 of the illustrated SP blockchain. The red block at fork index 0, R0, is endorsed by three 
PoP publications which occur at index 1 of the SP blockchain, so its score is 3*(1/((1-1+1)*(1-
1+1))) = 300; R0 = 300. The orange block at fork index 0, O0, is endorsed by two PoP
publications which occur at index 1 of the SP blockchain, and one PoP publication at index 2 
in the SP blockchain, so its score is 2*(1/((1-1+1)*(1-1+1))) + 1*(1/((2-1+1)*(2-1+1))) = 225; O0
= 225. Similarly, R1 = 1*(1/((2-2+1)*(2-2+1))) = 100 and O1 = 2*(1/((3-2+1)*(3-2+1))) = 50. The 
last block in any chain never has any proof weight, because no block has come after it to 
contain PoP endorsements for it; R2 = 0 and O2 = 0. Summing these up, the weight of the red 
chain is 300 + 100 = 400, and the weight of the orange chain is 225 + 50 = 275. Since 400 > 
275, the red chain is the more-endorsed blockchain.''' 😳

[31-Mar-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
no sybil protection

[31-Mar-19 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
no protection against a miner that basically buys the longest chains with PoP

[31-Mar-19 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, without any altcoin changes, it does no harm as it has no 51% protection without the altcoin daemon actually using the PoP info

[31-Mar-19 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
as far as all the voting for a blockchain goes, it is a bit like having a totally separate PoW system battling over which altcoin fork is the real one. So whether this is harmful or helpful would depend on the honesty of the PoP miners and the relative hashrates

[31-Mar-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
so it could be that VBK offers little to no protection (best case if no altcoin code changes), it allowing external PoP miners control the altcoin chain (if they make altcoin code changes), none of these outcomes has it doing anything like dPoW protection of 51% attacks and being true to the real mainchain. but doing 1000x the BTC tx seems to be an established fact

[31-Mar-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
I wonder if they are open to a 51% attack test for a VBK protected chain

[31-Mar-19 02:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I would doubt they would be open to attacks, even would they be 'friendly'

[31-Mar-19 02:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Such a highly publicized system will be under scrutiny soon enough I think

[31-Mar-19 10:04 PM] Alright#0419
Do they have any low hashrate chains using it yet?

[31-Mar-19 10:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Do they have any chains using it?

[31-Mar-19 10:51 PM] Regnar#6164
From the Veriblock white paper. "SI" is the protected chain, "SP" would be the chain being notarized to (Bitcoin)
```In order for PoP mining transactions to later be used for consensus, they must be stored in the SI blockchain. Additionally, the block headers of the SP blockchain need to be stored in such a way that consensus of the SP blockchain can be tracked without requiring peers to interface with the SP blockchain network. As such, the blocks on a blockchain implementing PoP contain a  special  segment to  hold  the  new SP blockchain  block  headers  since  the  last SI blockchain block’s included SP headers.```

@jl777c how is it possible to create a system that recycles BTC's energy and hashing at a negligible electricity cost ?

[31-Mar-19 11:50 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
id think that using all that energy has a pretty significant /resource intensive cost

[01-Apr-19 04:55 AM] Mylo#8306
sending a transaction into bitcoin is not high energy cost to re-use it's high public network security.

[01-Apr-19 04:56 AM] Mylo#8306
re-using bitcoin's "store of value" as a utility for security, for another chain, another ecosystem, other ecosystems tha tuse that ecosystem.

[01-Apr-19 04:57 AM] Mylo#8306
this is what is negligible energy use, the utility / by-product of a secure network being re-used.

[01-Apr-19 05:01 AM] Mylo#8306
maybe if you bought a plane ticket to new zealand it is expensive, but taking a local magazine for a friend and putting it in your bag - doesn't cost the plane ticket or the flight.   the hand-delivery of the magazine to a friend, piggy backed off the plane ticket.
the commitment to mining bitcoin or taking the flight is a "sunk cost" - equipment wise, environmental wise etc. getting more out of the already incurred expense

[01-Apr-19 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
@Regnar ok, so the altcoin needs to have changes made, but there is a third chain in the picture or is SP the VBK chain? So the altcoin has to allocate a percentage of blockreward to help finance the BTC spam

[01-Apr-19 12:28 PM] Regnar#6164
Yes, changes to the altcoin. I'm definitely not the expert, just reading the white paper trying to get a grasp on it. SP, I believe is any high hash chain, I think basically Bitcoin. I don't think I saw anything for VBK chain, but it's possible I missed it in the parts i read. Looks like the smaller chains are allocating blockspace for the BTC block headers. Didn't see how the fees were paid for, but I didn't read the whole thing yet.

[01-Apr-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless of what is in the paper, what is actually released? that is much more relevant
