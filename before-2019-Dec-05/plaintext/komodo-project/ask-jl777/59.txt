@Mark81 in order for people to trade votes?

[18-Apr-19 05:19 PM] Mark81#4505
Yes, that what tried to say.

[18-Apr-19 05:21 PM] Mark81#4505
But i believe that could be probably prevented with crypto conditions at least on chain by allowing transactions only to certain addresses. Of course people can do otc and go around that with it.

[18-Apr-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
with the vote bribery for the most part squelched at the source (NN doing revshare is very limited now) there is not much cash value to the VOTE

[18-Apr-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so how much would people pay for it?

[18-Apr-19 05:29 PM] Mark81#4505
if you can get elected every year from votes like in way that you can run more than one notary node i think there  it depends of revenue that notary mining generates in kmd.

[18-Apr-19 05:30 PM] Mark81#4505
In point where kmd price goes higher and gets stable i think there is your market that you are looking for.

[18-Apr-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
at most it would be worth 0.01 KMD

[18-Apr-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
20% of the 5%

[18-Apr-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
hopefully the whales will take into account the potential harm (or non-improvement) by this practice

[18-Apr-19 05:36 PM] Mark81#4505
i think this is market that will come once people get more familiar with kmd ecosystem.

[18-Apr-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
what would it do.. i guess the buyers would be investing to become a NN

[18-Apr-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
not quite the dynamic that is best, but not the end of the world either

[18-Apr-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the solution is to pay people to vote

[18-Apr-19 05:49 PM] Mark81#4505
Or they might promise certain % of revenue from mining. If i understand its quite predictable income from notary mining if theres not any hardware or software issues to deal with.

[18-Apr-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
i know!

[18-Apr-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we make it so you cant collect rewards without proof of voting in last year election

[18-Apr-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you sell the VOTE, then you forfeit your 5%

[18-Apr-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
which means it needs to be sold for more than 5%, but it is worth at most 1% and more like 0.5%

[18-Apr-19 05:52 PM] Mark81#4505
So newly buyed coins would have to wait year before getting apr?

[18-Apr-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it would seem so

[18-Apr-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
so i hope we are not forced to do something like this

[18-Apr-19 05:53 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Jus to butt in. But ppl can choose not to vote cant they. Like a none vote ?

[18-Apr-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
they could just vote for themselves

[18-Apr-19 05:53 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yes

[18-Apr-19 05:53 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
As a no vote

[18-Apr-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the CC would only check that a VOTE was cast

[18-Apr-19 05:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yea thats fair. I was seeing it as if not voted no 5%

[18-Apr-19 05:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
essentially sedning to ur self is burning them which is a vote.

[18-Apr-19 05:55 PM] Mark81#4505
Also moving coins to new address would drop you off from 5% Apr

[18-Apr-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
only if you lose the privkey

[18-Apr-19 05:56 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Could you lock a utxo to only be able to be sent say once?

[18-Apr-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
I think I could make it so that when you vote, you get credits that allow to collect rewards

[18-Apr-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
and these credits you control and can use on whatever address

[18-Apr-19 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is becoming more complex... let us hope such drastic measures are not needed

[18-Apr-19 05:58 PM] Mark81#4505
There are big downsides what comes to current system, yeah you painted fastly a an tough situation. üòÇ

[18-Apr-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so far there is no problem detected

[18-Apr-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
if this ever becomes a real issue and not just theoretical we can iterate solutions that lessen the issue

[18-Apr-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
this year we went to an ac_public chain to prevent any zvoting

[18-Apr-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
not that there was much of an issue before but this step puts everything transparently

[18-Apr-19 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
of course offchain agreements could be made for future revshares, but in some sense that is a business arrangement and not so sure that is against things anyway. if a whale wants to manage a tech to do the NN, then is that really so wrong?

[18-Apr-19 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
since it seems we cant stop this, maybe the answer is to facilitate it

[18-Apr-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
have a set of qualified tech NN operators and they can match up with some whale

[18-Apr-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the sensitivities about election manipulation is exaggerated, its not like an elected notary can "push the red button" or change policy, pass laws

[18-Apr-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
and ultimately it is what the stake wants to do that decides and if the stake decides to hire out a tech, then so be it

[18-Apr-19 07:15 PM] phm87#7395
if a whale moves the kmd after the votes airdrop then sells the private key controlling the votes, how is it possible to detect that votes were sold ?

[18-Apr-19 07:17 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Anonymous will release the emails on wikileaks

[18-Apr-19 07:18 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
beyond that, it's not

[18-Apr-19 07:20 PM] phm87#7395
we can detect that kmd were moved after the votes airdrop but it can be a normal tx to move the coins (sth about interests to earn if doing some tx but I'm not sure if I understand correctly)

[18-Apr-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
ultimately it is not possible to detect this, that is why i am saying to just allow it

[18-Apr-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
be open about it

[18-Apr-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
its like making drugs illegal, it just increases the price of the drugs

[18-Apr-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
make it legal and its just normal business

[18-Apr-19 07:21 PM] phm87#7395
I agree about drugs

[18-Apr-19 07:24 PM] phm87#7395
we were thinking together with CG and other ppl about your idea to promote AC on explorers and do you want to list all public AC or only dpow AC or another list of AC ?

[18-Apr-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it should just be AC that need/want more people, so they should have a website

[18-Apr-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
if not, then nothing to send people to

[18-Apr-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
some things (dilithium, trustless oracles) maybe just goes to blog pages

[18-Apr-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i asked marketing to come up with the set of text to use

[18-Apr-19 07:26 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you

[18-Apr-19 10:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c there is a claim of the invention of "programming probabilistic payments" here and it sounds like something you already have "invented", what are your thoughts?  https://twitter.com/zack_bitcoin/status/1118953075186835457

I invented programmable probabilistic payments.

state channels are to channels what programmable probabilistic payments are to probabilistic payments.

i didnt make that, though  it would be a simple enough CC to do. it makes payments like solomining instead of pool mining

[19-Apr-19 06:00 AM] jl777c#5810
occasionally big, mostly zero. average of the same. net effect is a lot less traffic

[19-Apr-19 06:00 AM] jl777c#5810
same value transfered (statistically)

Supernet owns 900 million redfox coins?

[19-Apr-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
acting as escrow

[19-Apr-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a SAFT mandated release schedule

[19-Apr-19 08:45 AM] Mark81#4505
Whst does that mean?

[19-Apr-19 08:48 AM] Mark81#4505
There is 50 million being sold in IEO offer and then there is against that  18x supply for in escrow?

[19-Apr-19 08:50 AM] Mark81#4505
i am going through now redfox ann site. clears a bit things....

[19-Apr-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the entire supply is not released for years

[19-Apr-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
redfoxlabs.io should explain it

[19-Apr-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
i just distribute according to the established schedule

[19-Apr-19 08:54 AM] Mark81#4505
yeah noticed that. its looks actually quite good schedule.

[19-Apr-19 08:58 AM] Mark81#4505
having a feeling now that i missed something big üòâ

[19-Apr-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
trading starts soon

[19-Apr-19 09:06 AM] Mark81#4505
i have to hope it start below ieo price... but dont know with these usdt pair ieo offerings..

[19-Apr-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
why would it start beloe ieo price if the ieo sold out relatively quickly

[19-Apr-19 09:08 AM] Mark81#4505
its just a hope.

id like to build a smart contract on KMD that pays users for locking up their KMD on the platform.  the smart contract would take say a 20% fee for every lock up and then pay a high interest like 4% daily for the locked up tokens

[19-Apr-19 05:26 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
has that been done already ?

[19-Apr-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
rewards CC

[19-Apr-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
already done

[19-Apr-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
but it charges nothing more than txfee

[19-Apr-19 05:30 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
that is pretty darn convenient

[19-Apr-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD itself wont have it but it can be done on KMDCC sidechain

[19-Apr-19 05:49 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
thats a very interesting project i wish i do it

[19-Apr-19 05:49 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
but not very good with code

[19-Apr-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is where do the coins come from

[19-Apr-19 05:49 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
why wont komodo have it , is it beccause KMD is more like a metta layer ?

[19-Apr-19 05:50 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
coins would have to be paid to the contract assigning a percentage of that payment to devs

[19-Apr-19 05:51 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
coins cannot be unlocked one they are paid to contract so its non refundable

[19-Apr-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
but who would fund this? usually the creator of chain can allocate coins for rewards plan

[19-Apr-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
but existing coins have a fixed emission rate

[19-Apr-19 05:52 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
ohh i see, so it would be paid in KMD?

[19-Apr-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
plz read the docs
