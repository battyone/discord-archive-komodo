there is a command line parameter -ac_ccactivate that is needed, ask @siu - Chainmakers he did it for COQUI

Does Equaliser need to do a hard fork to get the functionality?

[01-Nov-18 10:27 AM] jellysmash#6680
ok, thanks

[01-Nov-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is a hardforking change

depending on what CC is needed, it might be better to wait, we are fixing some issues found with dice CC

[01-Nov-18 10:28 AM] jellysmash#6680
it's the rewards CC

[01-Nov-18 10:29 AM] jellysmash#6680
basically to setup rewards, eg after 90 days get 5% rewards, 180 days 8% rewards, etc.

[01-Nov-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
no reported bugs with rewards CC

[01-Nov-18 10:31 AM] jellysmash#6680
ok, thanks

@jl777c 
What are the odds of Komodo (Ecosystem) ever developing a blockchain of collectibles--or what's referred to as non-fungible? And I say this thinking of maybe using it, to teach---like smart contracts, for example.

[07-Nov-18 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
assets CC has supported non-fungible token for months

[07-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Mylo#8306
@Privatoshi i asked a similar question only yesterday about bundling unique digital assets
```
non-fungible tokens are possible right now with the tokens contract.
We just need to use 1 satoshi of KMD(or whatever base coin) to create the tokens, 
then only one token with an id is created (so it has a unique token id). 
Later, whoever has the token can add op-return data to it.
GUI side can deal with the rules on how the OP-return data is interpreted

creating bundles of assets can be done with another CC that enforces such restrictions
```

[11-Nov-18 04:16 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
can you make a master komodod that assets connect to? with some api commands? or is this what is happening?  so many devs creating their own komodod - maybe a solution is to only accept certain acceptable comands  - I see komodod becoming extremely bloated very soon.  separate the base with the forks. there has to be an easier way  to have names and CCs connect.with the NNs...maybe I am missing something here . the variants are going to overwhelm  me - probably  not you --- I am guessing you have a value for Master you want to keep. I will continue to imagine the future.

[11-Nov-18 04:17 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
master will be huge in 24 months or less

[11-Nov-18 04:30 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

@jl777c good idea to hoard BCH in order to get SV?

no idea. chaos is very hard to predict

its weird how they get support from exchanges but the project looks terrible

[16-Nov-18 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
vested interest. all big exchanges had a lot of BTC during the BCH fork, so they have a lot of BCH

[19-Nov-18 01:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
There was a payment from crypto777 last Christmas ,  the idea is when the fees collected from the different assets hit 1 million to do a payout

[19-Nov-18 01:53 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
@jl777c did the fork result make you any more bullish on BCH ?

[19-Nov-18 01:54 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
seems like the BCH chain showed a lot of strength just wiping the sv threat with hashing power

[19-Nov-18 03:40 AM] Bob Sandvich#9974
Hey James. What is the current composition of the HODL asset? (Also if this should be moved elsewhere please let me know)

[19-Nov-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
just use atomicexplorer and lookup RNcUaMUEFLxVwtTo7rgruhwYanGk1jTkeU for HODL holdings

[19-Nov-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
@Stephen Daniels having a lunatic involved with BCH does not make me feel more bullish about it

@MarcM9000 SuperNET originally did a crowdfunding on a donation basis.

@jl777c  is there a limit to how many chains can be in a cluster?

[20-Nov-18 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
60000 can be all running on the same node, but you start to run out of ports. however, you can visualize a cluster as a set of non-overlapping subsets, so theoretically there is no limit other than how many can be notarized. likely there will be some practical limit that is there though

[20-Nov-18 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I would like to find this limit at some point, but I think its mostly hardware and network limited rather than. Software which makes it quite hard.

[20-Nov-18 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
you can have nodes that connect to only 10% of all the chains, randomly selected. even with port collision, netmagic would keep the networks separate, so maybe 600,000 chains? at some point the network contention of many chains on same port would likely be an issue

[21-Nov-18 07:18 AM] plazma#1625
@jl777c plz talk about points monero foks will try to say when it comes to monero vs pirate excluding zk snark trustted setup what points can they say about dpow centralisation....plz tell

[21-Nov-18 07:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
- what is your definition of centralisation?
- how many dpow serving nodes there are in komodo network?
- how many operators manage these notary nodes?
- how they become a notary node? or how they got selected to be notary node?
- does it count as centralisation or matches the denifinition of you answered in first question?

about zk-snarks, 
- what was the process used to create zcash sprout trusted keys? learn here: https://z.cash/blog/the-design-of-the-ceremony
- how much confidence your have that Peter Todd, who is one of the trusted keys setup, that he possibly have **NOT** destroyed his setup and colluded with others *Even in case you think others have NOT deleted their setup* and colluded with others.
- komodo will possibly get sapling upgrade in by first quarter of 2019. How much confidence you have that the number of public created trusted keys are compromise able?
- In terms of upgrade not that far from few months from now to sapling, what threats you see from so far sprout trusted keys setup?
