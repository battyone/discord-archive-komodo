Please don't misunderstand. I'm not talking about liquidating anytime soon.  I'm just saying in the event that things don't pan out (which, let's face it, is a real possibility), there should be a some kind of plan to give back to holders if they wanted out.

[20-Nov-19 12:40 PM] richardt#2807
Also, I wouldn't consider holding SN 5-6 years as short-term.

[20-Nov-19 12:41 PM] richardt#2807
I think the majority of holders are long-term at this point

[20-Nov-19 12:42 PM] richardt#2807
@jl777c , how long will that offer last?

`there should be a some kind of plan to give back to holders if they wanted out.`
you're envisioning folks dumping more than 100k SUPERNET?

[20-Nov-19 12:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Looking at the rich list,  seems in some form james has around  half of SN already

[20-Nov-19 12:53 PM] richardt#2807
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  Not at the moment. But maybe in 3-5 years if there continues to be no dividend payout and/or the tech still does not gain adoption.

What's the purpose of having supernet, is it still relevant in any regard?

[20-Nov-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if people would donate more, then SuperNET would lose its relevance

[20-Nov-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
but i have found that few people are actually willing to donate to help out the ecosystem

Just thinking back at @polycryptoblog message about doing the naming service the "real way" through ICANN - I think we should do it like ENS if it means faster launch. The value this adds to UX is exponential and this will inevitably be the new industry standard. What do you think @jl777c

It‚Äôs what you get for it .  Custom gTLD are not new , neither in centralized or decentralized form.  But this requires either special browser or some way of auto updating clients hosts.txt with the info to lead to that domain.  Adoption of this in the past has proven to be slow, as evidenced by Namecoin , Tor and others.

The real way adds the tld to the root DNS ,  it is the industry standard

```https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-namecoin-didnt-take-off-a-cautionary-tale```

```The problem is three-fold:

1.¬†Namecoin wasn't easy enough to use. The wallet still sucks, and there were no resolvers or good tutorials until I got involved. And that was three years after Namecoin existed. If they'd had a great wallet, a good resolver, and good tutorials from day one, Dot-Bit domains could likely be universal by now.

2.¬†Some of the Namecoin developers kind of lost track of the plot at some point. Once they were all broke (and isn't that maybe the market sending signals?) some of the team tried to partner Namecoin with Google and even ICANN. That makes no sense. That's making a technology to circumvent governments and then handing it over to governments.

3.¬†Most people don't care. Despite censorship of the Web around the world, and the threat of more impending Web censorship in the US, most people would rather spend hours forwarding and discussing horror stories of censorship and impending doom than actually spending an hour making their own domain censorship-proof by setting up a Dot-Bit mirror URL and then promoting it.

The biggest flaw is the clunky wallet that takes ten minutes to open. The other biggest flaw is that the near-zero expense of registering domains encouraged domain squatting

Also, Dot-Bit is actually vulnerable to a hostile takeover from ICANN.¬†```

```https://www.freedomfeens.com/blog/?p=6343```
```Basically [my idea is] customizable HOSTS.txt files, with a resolver built off the code of MeowBit, and a way for people with no computer skills to easily customize lists and share them via BitTorrent (without even needing to know what a HOSTS.txt file or BitTorrent is). Making it easy to compete to make and share the best lists would drive adoption.```

Namecoin been my favourite project from it's technical point of view. It actually was doing and offering what it was claiming to do and even more in later years.
Only if the developers of it's project were friendly enough to SuperNET when I approached them and were a collaborative sensible, I would have helped their tech be much easier to use for end users. They didn't listen and just responded and treated me like a troll, so I didn't took any much efforts for that project.
Today, if the same or similar tech is made on Komodo Platform, I'd very much like to be part of that even just being a volunteer.
I can express and probably add some dev work where possible to make a blockchain based domain name system work to help such tech develop and be eased for end users.

[27-Nov-19 10:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And since we have now nSPV, that'd mean we can also have such tech absolutely accessible on every type of platform with such ease and efficiency that any end user expects to have.

[27-Nov-19 10:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm busy with other projects outside blockchain tech for some time now, and aware that Veruscoin is working on decentralised identity. I haven't explored it much, but I hope the same can also be adopted to act for domain resolving with modified or custom resolver if required. Any decentralised naming service can be moulded to behave like a domain name system.

[27-Nov-19 10:50 PM] Mylo#8306
nspv in a browser extension (or phone app) would be able to do similar perhaps.  For Web devs using a js (or wasm) bridge.
A customCC can add many other things.
nspv is P2P super lightweight client.

[27-Nov-19 10:52 PM] CrisF#3405
Interested to see what jl777 thinks.  Might be a good project to consider starting off in #kmdlabs.

[27-Nov-19 10:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not just web browser mate, making nSPV based DNS resolved installed as a system service along with the DNS resolver daemon.

[27-Nov-19 10:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that would be mean a system wide decentralized DNS resolver always accessible just like any ICANN based TLD everywhere.

[27-Nov-19 10:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, agree. even OracleCC can be used to make decentralised DNS üòâ

[27-Nov-19 10:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I guess before using OracleCC there must be specifications set by experts and devs so all things are made in standard way and not with some conflicting ideas.

[27-Nov-19 10:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess even multiple types of specifications be used by individual devs to make different versions of DNS over OracleCC

[27-Nov-19 10:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I still haven't gave up trying to make nSPV as a library to use with Golang project. Have made a bit progress over how can I make it a library and call it's functions in Golang. I really hope I could get it implemented as I expect it to work. Will post my failure or success soon.
