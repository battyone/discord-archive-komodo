i'm not sure THB, its more of a question for James since its his channel üòÉ I would think not, but I could foresee him possibly using smart contracts for dividend payouts or something awesome (james never lets us down in the awesome tech department), so who knows?  if so though, it would probably be better to do it sooner than later when they're hopefully much bigger üòÉ

[28-Jun-18 04:02 PM] jorian#4555
that ceo just mentioned in #komodo-team that we can send ideas to him.

[28-Jun-18 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
@xRobeSx no snapshot necessary, you can just add -ac_cc to an existing chain and it hard forks it

[28-Jun-18 04:58 PM] xRobeSx#5136
ahh hardfork, i thought it might create a new chain

[28-Jun-18 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
wow,I lose internet for a few hours and my channel becomes about naming?

./komodod -ac* -> runtime fork that creates a new blockchain

[28-Jun-18 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
now with millions of possible coin emissions possible

[28-Jun-18 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
CC can be enabled or not

[28-Jun-18 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
if enabled a CCid cluster can be created and a built in fungibility within the cluster activated

[28-Jun-18 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
this is from a SINGLE burn protocol contract implemented in the CCid >= 3 case, which creates a cluster

[28-Jun-18 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
VRSC forked komodo and added many vrsc unique for now -ac options, which in time will come back into komodod

[28-Jun-18 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
now I know people love to debate names, since everybody can have a valid opinion since it isnt technical and you dont have to worry about segfaults or compiler bugs. But that takes it out of the technical domian, which this channel should stick to.

[28-Jun-18 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
VRSC will be automatically spawning new chains (actually the miner will be doing this) and they are called autochains

[28-Jun-18 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
so the name is *chain

[28-Jun-18 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
where * can be anything

[28-Jun-18 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
having one name to describe every possible thing will lead to a name that is overloaded

[28-Jun-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
so no matter what single name is used, people will complain that it doesnt make sense in all the other cases. I try to avoid getting involved in things that dont have a deterministic conclusion as it can easily take infinite time

[28-Jun-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
I suggest that marketing create a marketable name for each different type of usecase. Maybe we can even get press coverage for each different name (usecase) from the same ./komodod -ac* runtime fork ability

[28-Jun-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
when I originally implemented this it was because I was too lazy to make N source code forks for all the different SuperNET assets, so I made -ac_name= option and called it assetchains

[28-Jun-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
then I added ability to be mined as on-demand chains only made sense for infrequently used assets

[28-Jun-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
then I added PoS/PoW and different coin emissions

[28-Jun-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
then -ac_cc=1 with CC enabled

[28-Jun-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
then VRSC added their options

[28-Jun-18 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
then with MoMoM -ac_cc=<clusterid>

[28-Jun-18 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
so it has just expanded and evolved as it has been the path of least resistance from a technical side to add new abilities

[28-Jun-18 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
and what we havent released yet, but have announced are coin specific CC eval functions that allow to blockchain enforce any (and by any, I mean any) boolean evaluator. This might sound not so much, but when you can run native code to evaluate to a boolean, you can do things like evalpokerhand(op-return data of pokerhand, payoutvector)

[28-Jun-18 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
then given a poker hand (signed in realtime) you can approve a blockchain payout of a pokerhand, blockchain enforced and not needing any multiple signers

[28-Jun-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
The burn protocol was able to be implemented so quickly due to the fact that solving realtime poker being blockchain enforced has been the overall goal, with the assumption that most other decentralization problems will be easier to solve and likely some variation of a subset of the realtime poker solution

[28-Jun-18 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
so we can have a bunch of game specific chains, what to call them? is there a single name for chains with a boolean eval function, or do we name each subset of chains that have something in common (card games, casino games, multiplayer games)?

[28-Jun-18 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
this i leave to marketing to solve, it will be enough work to get all this tech working without having to worry about the perfect way to name it

[28-Jun-18 06:54 PM] ProficieNt#3097
what consensus mechanism do scaling chains use?

[28-Jun-18 06:57 PM] ProficieNt#3097

MoMoM - Federated Multi-chain Syncing

[28-Jun-18 11:41 PM] Steve Lee#1967

Branding of scaling solution: InfiniScale

[28-Jun-18 11:42 PM] Steve Lee#1967
Asset Chain rename - Parallel Chains / ScaleChains (dual meaning with scales of a lizard and the literal technical descriptor)

[28-Jun-18 11:43 PM] Steve Lee#1967
Cross-Chain Smart/Simple Contracts

[28-Jun-18 11:44 PM] Steve Lee#1967
Blockchain Bridging - Full interop to blockchains outside our ecosystem via MoMoM

[28-Jun-18 11:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Asset Chain rename - Parallel Chains / ScaleChains"
imo, "ScaleChains" would bring up the implication issue from earlier, whereby the name suggests that those chains are somehow utilized to offset scaling of the network and the intended correlation to the lizard/komodo theme would be lost on most folks

[29-Jun-18 12:05 AM] Steve Lee#1967
good point, noted.

[29-Jun-18 01:50 AM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
What do you guys think of PermaScale/PermaScaling for the solution brand

[29-Jun-18 01:52 AM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
InfiniScale has one too many syllables for my liking

[29-Jun-18 02:17 AM] BlackJesus#6161
@Steve Lee maybe hydrascaling/hydrachain multiple chains/heads 1 body

[29-Jun-18 03:06 AM] Steve Lee#1967
i actually like the sound of hydrascale

[29-Jun-18 03:06 AM] Steve Lee#1967
what's the explanation behind permascaling @ResoluteCrypto

[29-Jun-18 03:25 AM] Evitor#6985
Permascaling sounds like "sperm" scaling.... Think hydrascale would be a great idea... Because... Everybody know about Hydra and also about sperm üòâ

[29-Jun-18 03:26 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

Other than that reading Mastering Bitcoin from Andreas is also good to get better understanding of blockchain and spv

[29-Jun-18 08:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
understanding of Merkle root and SPV is beneficial/essential in our CryptoConditions implementations.

[29-Jun-18 08:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It

[29-Jun-18 09:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It's the bases of Merkle root of Merkle root of Merkle root (MoMoM)

[29-Jun-18 09:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
As I understand to be ready to make a CryptoConditions contract I should have the understanding of creating a raw bitcoin transaction,
so as this first requirement I'm trying to learn bits and pieces and practice when I get time.

[29-Jun-18 09:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c is that good for the start ?

[29-Jun-18 09:16 AM] gcharang#6833
Is merged mining just an implementation detail of mining software or only some kind of coins be merge mined? I am asking as I think that this could be a solution to the problem of splitting hashpower between a lot of fungible chains connected with `ac_cc` for the purpose of scaling tx/s

[29-Jun-18 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hey that's a really good idea!

[29-Jun-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It would require code change, as merged mining is part of the consensus as far as I am aware, you can't merge mine any coin.

[29-Jun-18 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Having a single miner for all chains, or even each 64 chain cluster, would mean we need even less CPUs.

[29-Jun-18 10:39 AM] gcharang#6833
Will komodo daemon source code need to be changed to allow for merged mining?

[29-Jun-18 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[29-Jun-18 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
also miners have to support it

@libscott

[29-Jun-18 11:27 AM] gcharang#6833
```
To do any harm to the blockchains that are getting dPOW(i.e., not add a particular blockchain's checkpoint to BTC), all the notaries that get to sign a particular transaction have to collude and notaries don't get to choose which other notaries to sign the transaction with. On the random chance only the colluding notaries can get together and not notarize a blockchain intentionally, the community would just kick all of the colluding notories.
``` 
Is this statement true?

[29-Jun-18 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the power of notaries is to withold notarization

[29-Jun-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
as each notarization is validated by all nodes

[29-Jun-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
so not sure what "colluding" will achieve, other than reducing the notarization frequncy

[29-Jun-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
and such notaries that are coluding to withhold notarizations will have a lower notarizing total and have to go through election cycle. it wont be easily determinatble that a notary is part of the colluding non-notrizers

Naming suggestions - 
MoMoM -  Grandmother of Merkle. 
Branding of scaling solution:  Moebius scaling
Asset Chain rename -  Spore chains

[29-Jun-18 11:51 AM] PTYX#6840
Coming up with fancy animal names isn't the key thing. The goal is creating a technical name that describes the independent chains. Eth has ERC20, QTum has QRC, and NEM has Mosaics which fits them. An ideal name is easy to use and adds marketing value. If I hear the word Spore chains..... That doesn't tell me much. If I hear KIC and I research and find that KIC stands for Komodo Independent Chain. Then that makes more sense.

[29-Jun-18 11:52 AM] PTYX#6840
Verus calls theirs autochains

[29-Jun-18 11:52 AM] PTYX#6840
Which still has more marketing value than assetchains

[29-Jun-18 11:52 AM] PTYX#6840
Auto can be autonomous or automatic

[29-Jun-18 11:52 AM] PTYX#6840
Which in a way its both

[29-Jun-18 11:52 AM] gcharang#6833
What about `Komodo based Blockchains`

[29-Jun-18 11:53 AM] PTYX#6840
I thought of KiB

[29-Jun-18 11:53 AM] PTYX#6840
Komodo Independent blockchain

[29-Jun-18 11:53 AM] PTYX#6840
But KIC has more of a ring when you say it word by word

[29-Jun-18 11:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I don't mind technical names or unique acronyms. I was thinking more visualy .
