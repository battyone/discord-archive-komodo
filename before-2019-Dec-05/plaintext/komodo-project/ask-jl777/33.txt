So there is really no issue having a huge amount of nodes, it would just get very expensive data wise?

[04-Dec-18 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and the process would get less reliable

[04-Dec-18 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
realisiically going over 64 notaries gives you very little benefit,but the logistics issues keep getting bigger

NN is centralised because you have to rely on a third party who determines for you what the longest chain is and that reorgs, which are a normal thing with blockchains, can't happen anymore

[04-Dec-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
plz ignore that all nodes in the network validate all notarizations, invalid notarizations are ignored

[04-Dec-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the "third party" is actually a set of normal nodes that are generating a consensus among themselves and this hash is then validated by all nodes.

[04-Dec-18 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
claiming NN are centralized is like saying the tx you send out is centralized as only your node was involved in creating the tx

[04-Dec-18 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not the number of nodes involved in creating the tx that determines if it is decentralized, rather it is the number of nodes validating that does

using a third party decentralized solution does not make it centralized, it just makes it a third party enabled solution. which is likely the actual reason. they dont want to rely on any third party as they wrote all their codebase without the help from any third party

[04-Dec-18 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
they dont use any compilers or operating systems

@KomodoWorld @KomodoPlatform @VeriBlock My understanding is that KMD uses elected delegates (similar to block producers in EOS) that publish alt-chains to bitcoin's blockchain. Which, relative to VBK's piggybacking mechanism, is more centralized.

"My understanding is that KMD uses elected delegates (similar to block producers in EOS) that publish alt-chains to bitcoin's blockchain. Which, relative to VBK's piggybacking mechanism, is more centralized. VBK enables any user to Proof-of-Proof mine, which is a way to spend market-competitive amounts of btc to insert an image of the Veriblock blockchain into the Bitcoin blockchain via a BTC transaction. And alt-chains will PoP mine to insert their chain-images onto the VBK chain."

[04-Dec-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
the writeup is good, but I would use a much clearer example to disprove the "dpow is centralized" nonsense

[04-Dec-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the basic logic that is used is that some "small" number of 64 nodes gets to create the notarization and thus it is more centralized than not having these special 64 nodes. This is false logic!

[04-Dec-18 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the level of decentralization is not based on how many nodes are participating in creating a transaction, but rather how many nodes are validating it. since all nodes validate all notarizations, it is as decentralized as any "centralized" tx that you make all by your self each time you create a transaction. Even though only one node is creating this transaction, it isnt centralized. the people claiming dpow is centralized is similar to claiming that anybody that sends a tx made on a single node is centralized.

[04-Dec-18 06:56 PM] Mylo#8306
yep thanks james.   i think this is a key point in veriblock's literature.   one person sends a tx, and then it's validated everywhere

[04-Dec-18 07:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wait veriblock has only 1 node that sends the tx to BTC ... and we have 13 ... so that means we are more decentralsied lol

decentralization is hard to understand

[04-Dec-18 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it is easy to use it as a buzzword

[04-Dec-18 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you keep in mind that all nodes validating all transactions, this is the key to the decentralization as it avoids relying on any other node to tell you what happened

[04-Dec-18 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
i think as long as this is the case, it is hard to argue that it isnt decentralized, let alone that it is centralized

[04-Dec-18 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
blockhashes seen by all nodes, notarized by a subset and then validated by all nodes. compare that to a transaction that a single node makes and it validated by all nodes

[04-Dec-18 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810

Parameter Generation - Zcash
Background Zcash‚Äôs zero-knowledge proofs rely on a set of public parameters which allow users to construct and verify private transactions. ‚Ä¶

[05-Dec-18 10:07 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
it says "For Zcash‚Äôs second set of public parameters, there are two distinct phases referred to as Powers of Tau and Sapling MPC"

[05-Dec-18 10:09 AM] Alright#0419
so is powers of TAU params just not used at all?

[05-Dec-18 10:11 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I understand that powers of TAU was necessary first step to generate Sapling parameters

[05-Dec-18 10:12 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
"In order to ensure the toxic waste does not come into existence, our team designed multi-party computation (MPC) protocols which allow multiple independent parties to collaboratively construct the parameters. These protocols have the property that, in order to compromise the final parameters, all of the participants would have to be compromised or dishonest.

To this date, Zcash has created two distinct sets of public parameters. The first ceremony happened in October 2016 just before the launch of Zcash Sprout. The second was generated in 2018 anticipating the Sapling network upgrade later that year.

In the Sprout MPC, all participants needed to commit to their share of the ‚Äútoxic waste‚Äù in advance in order to protect against adaptive attacks. This meant that all of the participants needed to be available for the entire duration of the protocol, and nobody could abort without causing the entire protocol to abort. Participants needed to maintain custody of their hardware throughout the process, so this meant the ceremony could not scale beyond a handful of people.

The Sapling MPC allows participants join to the protocol, do their part and leave immediately. This allows the ceremony to scale to a large number of participants and take place over a longer period of time. It also decreases the surface area of attack for participants and avoids the need for expensive synchronization."

[05-Dec-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
my understanding is powers of tau was part of the sapling parameters process

[05-Dec-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
anybody that claims that having more people involved makes it worse, when just having a single honest person makes it secure is ignoring some basic math

[05-Dec-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
odds of collusion among 100% of participants is a monotonic increasing function with more participants, ie. the more participants the higher the odds for it to happen. with 100+ people, it seems a lot more unlikely than 6. not that having 6 people all colluding was anything that was very likely

@KomodoWorld @KomodoPlatform @VeriBlock Is it possible for the notaries to collude with a 51% attacker and notarize false data states? Want to emphasize whether it's *possible* not whether it is likely.

[05-Dec-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
since all notarizations are validated by all nodes, any invalid notarization will be ignored

[05-Dec-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not possible to create an invalid notarization that has any effect

[05-Dec-18 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i repeat: all nodes validate all notarizations

[05-Dec-18 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
that is what makes dPoW decentralized

[05-Dec-18 02:19 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
üëå

[05-Dec-18 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is a 51% attacker and a valid notarization is made, then there can only be one notarized chain, so the attacker would stop his own attack

[05-Dec-18 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so the only thing is for the attacker to prevent notarizations via collusion. but the absence of notarizations is in itself an indication that something is wrong, either the chain is not reaching consensus, or notaries are somehow colluding to not notarize

[05-Dec-18 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
which means the worst case of dPoW is that it degrades to the state things would be without dPoW at all

[05-Dec-18 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810

it is just using the "confirmations" field from gettransaction, gettxout, etc

[05-Dec-18 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as normal methods are used to calculate confirmations, that is all that is needed

[05-Dec-18 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe some exchanges remember what block a tx came in and use that value, in such a case they need to add a call to gettxout or gettransaction and check the "confirmations" field

[05-Dec-18 02:25 PM] Alright#0419
Just wanted to point out that even if notaries stop notarizing, a double spend is not possible

So if you could control all the notaries and have them all submit the same invalid chain-states, would the validating nodes know the difference? Sounds like the validating nodes are just accepting some threshold number of replicated chain-states across the notaries.

[05-Dec-18 04:39 PM] gcharang#6833
Is this reply accurate:
"Validating nodes have their version of blockchain too. If one controls all notary nodes they can submit any chain state they wish, but it will only be accepted by the rest of the network if it follows the consensus rules. Once a chain state is submitted to the network, even notaries can't re-org it. So what ever chainstate is submitted, there will only be one valid chain ever. So double spending is not possible."
