the announced bitmain deal is merged mining with btc, using bitmain miners

[28-Nov-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
or half of them

[28-Nov-18 10:21 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
and weaker chain benefits from others higher hash rate

[28-Nov-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no single "BTC miner" you can do a deal with

[28-Nov-18 10:21 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
i see

[28-Nov-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
you would need to pay all the various bitcoin miners to specifically mine your coin

[28-Nov-18 10:22 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
still a positive it seems

[28-Nov-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
this seems like a lot of work and costs

[28-Nov-18 10:22 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
ahh thats true

[28-Nov-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a miner opt in

[28-Nov-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
i needed a system where we dont rely on anybody giving permission, or worse, having to proactively do something

[28-Nov-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
optin by miners, vs. automatically supported

[28-Nov-18 10:22 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
is komodo development going well?

[28-Nov-18 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
why do you ask?

[28-Nov-18 10:23 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
yes i get the automatic support but that doesnt take away from the coins's normal mining

[28-Nov-18 10:24 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
i guess its only been a week since last update

[28-Nov-18 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
#feed-github shows github activity as it happens

[28-Nov-18 10:26 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
how long will it be before KMD gets listed on a fiat exchange such as gemini, kraken, coinbase, etc?

[28-Nov-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
why do you ask me this? how would I know

[28-Nov-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
I can ask you the same question

[28-Nov-18 10:26 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
i ask because overall economic mass is important to success

[28-Nov-18 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i have no contacts at gemini, kraken, coinbase, etc

[28-Nov-18 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
do you?

[28-Nov-18 10:27 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
but i dont matter

[28-Nov-18 10:27 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
im just a buyer/seller

[28-Nov-18 10:27 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
sorry man, dodnt mean to annoy you

[28-Nov-18 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as getting listed maybe you can matter as much or more than me, if you have some contacts there

[28-Nov-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
but this channel is for tech questions, yes?

[28-Nov-18 10:28 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
ahh true

[28-Nov-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
just imagine that I only write code

[28-Nov-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
which is pretty close to what is happening

[28-Nov-18 10:28 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
yeah thats good

[28-Nov-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so what info does a coder have about what some exchange will or will not do?

[28-Nov-18 10:29 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
hmmmm

[28-Nov-18 10:29 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
true

[28-Nov-18 10:29 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
i made a KMD asssett chain a while ago

[28-Nov-18 10:30 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
and i really want to have it trade on barterdex

[28-Nov-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
make a pull request to my coins repo. cipi can help you

[28-Nov-18 10:30 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
cool

[28-Nov-18 10:31 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
is it possible to maintain the asset  chain on a AWS free tier VPS server?

[28-Nov-18 10:32 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
its 1gb ssd, ubuntu

[28-Nov-18 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i have no idea what sort of limits that has or what sort of traffic your chain will get

[28-Nov-18 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
you would need to create VM

[28-Nov-18 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
I think 4GB of total mem is needed

[28-Nov-18 10:32 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
so it would tax my macbook pro

[28-Nov-18 10:32 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
i need to get a desktop

[28-Nov-18 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
you can probably create on aws free tier. then see if it works or not

[28-Nov-18 10:33 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
yeah ill try that , thanks !

[28-Nov-18 10:36 AM] Acura#2748
@Stephen Daniels info for you about KMD Fiat Exchange - look at Bitpanda - you can buy KMD via Fiat on Bitpanda Exchange

[28-Nov-18 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
upbit support KRW

[28-Nov-18 10:44 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
bitpanda is cool but mostly for EU citizens

[28-Nov-18 10:46 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
singapour ohhh very interesting

[28-Nov-18 03:55 PM] BitDaddy#1453
@jl777c sorry for the late response, been working all day. I know that you had doubts about the pirate name from the start. I thought you may have some leverage in a rebrand as you are a lead dev. Sorry if this assumption was wrong but I thought I would reach out anyway as I want Pirate to succeed,  I am sure we all do. but let's be honest the name pirate is not great for any serious adoption. I will stick to the marketing channel from now on thanks for your reply . üëç

@jl777c what do you think about the importance of smart data feeds and oracles that connect real live data with blockchains and feed data into the blockchain for faster settlement and other data manipulation?

[28-Nov-18 08:20 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
theres a project called chain-link that is doing that but i was wondering cant komodo be used to create similar oracles to feed real world data to blockchains? ue cases would be to connect banks, live events, weather, and other data to blockchains and other sidechains

[28-Nov-18 08:31 PM] Alright#0419
@Stephen Daniels komodo already has it 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jl777/komodo/FSM/src/cc/oracles.cpp

[28-Nov-18 11:03 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
thats not the same thing

[28-Nov-18 11:19 PM] actionslacks#4072
@Stephen Daniels #cc-general has some insight into the oracles strategy for kmd.

[29-Nov-18 01:33 AM] Alright#0419
@Stephen Daniels how is that not exactly what you just described?

[29-Nov-18 01:34 AM] Alright#0419
it allows you to push arbitrary data on chain

[29-Nov-18 01:34 AM] Alright#0419
and have dapps and contracts make decisions based on that data

[29-Nov-18 01:35 AM] CrisF#3405
@Stephen Daniels Hi, are you thinking data like price feeds, GPS data, streaming data (video for example) etc?

[29-Nov-18 01:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Put on-chain through an oracle? Then used by other contracts?

[29-Nov-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
@Stephen Daniels oracles CC allows to put offchain data onchain

[29-Nov-18 07:23 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
is the system that collects and filters the accuracy of the date decentrlized?

[29-Nov-18 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
it depends on whatever is implemented

[29-Nov-18 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
usually an oracle is trusted to provide accurate data, hence its name "oracle"

[29-Nov-18 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
oracles CC is a mechanism for getting offchain data onchain

[29-Nov-18 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
but garbage in/garbage out still applies

[29-Nov-18 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
if you put garbage data onchain, it is onchain, but still garbage

[29-Nov-18 12:26 PM] jusoaresf#3291
Good morning @jl777c 
 How close are we to have assets and Oracle CCs ready for production usage?
What about gateways?
Thanks

[29-Nov-18 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it is certainly ready for dapps to be built with them, whether it is production ready would depend on the specific usecases

[29-Nov-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
i would say oracles is pretty much ready as it is not putting any big funds at risk

[29-Nov-18 12:31 PM] jusoaresf#3291
True

[29-Nov-18 12:33 PM] jusoaresf#3291
So an App that uses just assets and oracles could attempt an alpha version already?

[29-Nov-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
why not?

[29-Nov-18 12:39 PM] jusoaresf#3291
:) will put a concept in words in a bit then

@jl777c what are you thoughts on MimbleWimble/Grin project?
Last time I checked, it wasn't possible to do all things what BTC could do (btc prior segwit and stuff). I haven't been keeping an eye on it's tech side much, not sure you might have, but still would like to ask if you know it got any better than what it started as and if does cover some things what BTC level does? Means other than privacy, how else good it can do in cryptocurrency ecosystem? 
Could MimbleWimble tech be of any use for komodo ecosystem either being 3rd party or any other way?

[01-Dec-18 08:24 AM] Acura#2748
@grewalsatinder I'd think James had written that it was incompatible technology. (In terms of pirates)

[01-Dec-18 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
grin is very interesting. but i havent followed it too closely as it isnt in C

[01-Dec-18 08:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
right.... üôÇ 
I hope we could use it somehow with Komodo. I heard good for this project from others. üôÇ

[03-Dec-18 08:03 PM] stefjazar#0319
i would like ARRR to hit more exchanges and CMC aka Coinmarketcap first and then when more people know it consider a rebranding - maybe in 2020 - not before .. that would be a mistake as you can present this ‚Äûproduct‚Äú twice.. 

if you rebrand now you only present it once !!!

think abt. it and you come around (to agree with me)...üòâ  @BitDaddy

[03-Dec-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
talk to the PIRATE team, I am not making any decisions about pirate

[03-Dec-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly not about a rebranding as that is nothing to do with tech

[03-Dec-18 10:23 PM] Regnar#6164
jl777, I've got a question in regards to dPoW. Do the NN run their own full node for each chain being notarized? and if so do they create the hash based on their own Nodes information?

[03-Dec-18 10:30 PM] SHossain#0007
They run full native node

[04-Dec-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries run a normal node to get the blockhash, all notaries participate in a randomized process to get consensus on the blockhash, then all the nodes in the network validate it

[04-Dec-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
to call NN as centralized is like saying that when you send out a tx, it is centralized because only you were involved in creating the tx. it is a nonsensical point of view

{Reactions}
üòÜ 

[04-Dec-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
the decentralization comes from all the nodes validating

[04-Dec-18 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless of how many nodes were involved in creating the tx

{Reactions}
üëå 

[04-Dec-18 08:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
out of intrest what is the maximum amount of nodes who can participate... i.e minsigs?

[04-Dec-18 09:17 AM] jusoaresf#3291
Or a router... if tx goes through a router... is it centralized?

[04-Dec-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
practically speaking minsigs over 18 has a hard time reaching consensus, but it can be set to some crazy high number like 50 and you wont ever get a consensus
