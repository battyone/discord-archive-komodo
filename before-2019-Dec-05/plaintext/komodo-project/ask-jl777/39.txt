is there some way of preventing a chain split even if notaries do collude?

[08-Dec-18 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
@polycryptoblog there is no provision that prevents any to any within a cluster, but the GUI could limit all destinations to a single chain

[08-Dec-18 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
unless it is critical it can only go to a single chain

[08-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Alright#0419
a split notary network, however unlikely, could be a problem

[08-Dec-18 08:57 PM] Alright#0419
could happen with no malicious intent

[08-Dec-18 08:57 PM] Alright#0419
again unlikely

[08-Dec-18 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but it needs to be combined with a precisely timed 51% attack

[08-Dec-18 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
and then to convince the community to allow the double spend as the split chain will need to be resolved by the community

[08-Dec-18 08:58 PM] Alright#0419
get an exchange on each chain, sell same coins on both

[08-Dec-18 08:58 PM] Alright#0419
no 51% attack involved at all

[08-Dec-18 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
the important thing to observe is that even though it is theoretically possible, it would be much easier to 51% attack a chain without dPoW

[08-Dec-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
why add notarization to make things harder to attack

[08-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Alright#0419
in the event of a chain split, it'd be fairly hard to send the same coins to different addresses on each fork

[08-Dec-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
so it doesnt really increase the risk exposure to 51% attacks, in fact it seems to reduce the potential 51% attackers to the notaries

[08-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Alright#0419
not really related to what I was just saying, but I was trying to think of how you would even do that

[08-Dec-18 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
in a chain split, it splits really cleanly into two independent chains

[08-Dec-18 09:00 PM] Alright#0419
we've seen chainsplits that share mempool

[08-Dec-18 09:00 PM] Alright#0419
never understood how that happened

[08-Dec-18 09:00 PM] Alright#0419
DEX split in ~Feb

[08-Dec-18 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so using the chain split notarization for 51% attack, reduces the possible attackers to notaries, from everyone. seems an improvement

[08-Dec-18 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
mempool can have tx that havent been spend on either chain

[08-Dec-18 09:17 PM] Alright#0419

@sgp please come back soon, no letting you go until converted to KMD

[09-Dec-18 01:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@sgp even in case you are intentionally trying to find a problem in dPoW while there is nothing found, I enjoyed the whole conversation. Would love to see more of such conversations here again. 

I agree on the point that dPoW is not perfect, but I absolutely disagree with you that any of the marketing that Komodo Platform Team has done is either false or misleading. 

I still encourage you to feel free to ask as many scenario you can make up.

If you could find any legitimate loophole in the dPoW you for sure be even rewarded for your findings.

So far I see you couldn't find any.

@jl777c is there a name of PoS in for Komodo Assetchains?
I understand now there are 2 PoS ways in Komodo, VerusPoS and the other earlier coded PoS in Komodo for assetchains ?

@Alright

[10-Dec-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes we have pos64 and versus Pos.. I think versus version only works with versus hash low though, and is fixed at 50%

[10-Dec-18 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pos64 generally stable and works quite well, but does see some inconsistent block times.

[10-Dec-18 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have not tested versus pos at all, but it seems to work find for verus. :)

[10-Dec-18 09:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
As I understand VerusPoS is flexible to adjust it's percentage of consens when creating an assetchain. It is possible to create less or more percentage than 50% VerusPoS chain.
Thanks for clearing on PoS64.

[10-Dec-18 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
I call it Pos64. veruspos should work with equihash, but 50% is all it does

[10-Dec-18 09:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay üëç thanks

[10-Dec-18 09:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[10-Dec-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
we use zcash parameters

[10-Dec-18 12:03 PM] Lumbi#8378
How does CMC know that there are 110,928,878 KMD in circulation? ZEC used to have that input blank and is now showing: 5,419,031 ZEC in circulation.

[10-Dec-18 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i think they get it from the dexstats.info api

[10-Dec-18 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
which uses the coinsupply rpc call

[10-Dec-18 12:13 PM] Lumbi#8378
is KMD based on 'zed'-cash params 2.0.0 (sapling)?

do KMD assetchains have their own zkSNARKs keys? or do they adopt KMD/ZEC's parameters by default?

[10-Dec-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
assetchains are runtime forks of KMD

[10-Dec-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
do you understand what that means?

[10-Dec-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
no source code changes

[10-Dec-18 12:41 PM] Lumbi#8378
would it be possible to give an assetchain the option of creating their own zkSNARKs keys?

[10-Dec-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
not as a runtime fork

[10-Dec-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
you would need to make a source level fork and generate your own multiparty computations

Hello @jl777c 

we in the German Telegram Channel are a little annoyed about Dr. Julian Hosp. You know him? Co-founder Ten-X and THE face in Germany, when it comes to crypto.

We know that a few months ago he was informed about Atomic Swaps via Twitter. He was in direct contact with some developers of Komodo.

He now claims that the Comit network, in which TenX is involved, makes Comit the world elite in atomic swaps. In detail, he speaks of an ERC20 swap about Lightning. No one would have done that before and Comit would be the world's elite. 

Can you say anything about that? Has Komodo ever done ERC20 on Lightning?

[12-Dec-18 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
we havent done ERC20 on lightning. years ago i did what I call subatomic swaps, which were incrementally transferring value 1/777th at a time. It was really no big deal, so I didnt make any press release out of it. I didnt like the performance aspect as it required 777*2 small offchain transactions to complete and anything goes wrong during the process and things are left in an inbetween state. with a normal atomic swap, it either happens or unwinds so that it is as if it didnt happen. so any claim of atomicity when using lightning would need to have caveats, like it isnt actually atomic if the channel fails, or is closed, etc.

That's the one. In German-speaking countries, he is slowly being unmasked by those who looked up to him in the beginning and fell into it.
People, who deal more intensively with crypto currencies, see meanwhile the shadow side. But he does it well, is on German TV. Sells well, he used to be a doctor, professional surfer, sunny boy and TenX founder. Slowly the facade of the "Saubermann" (I translate it with "serious business men") is crumbling.
