while it is possible to make CC tx via rawtransactions, it is a lot easier to just use the built in rpc. do a help rpc call and you will see all the rpc

@jl777c when I post about KMD I get thhis alot : "doesn't jl777 just abandon projects at will though? i mean what happened to the other 1,000 he started?" , howmany projects did you start actually?

from what I recall, it seems people confuse "abandoned" with "left a clusterfuk" referring to nxt 😛

there were different assets for different parts of Supernet that are now komodo assetchains: crypto777, Dex, Pangea, etc.. that gave people an opportunity to fud "see, he abandoned x and working on y"

Yes, blacks are on average more stupid than whites. On average they can also dance better, and are better in bed.

NXT broke backward compatibility in 2014 and I was not happy about it and complained. they promised not to do it again. Of course they did it again in 2015 and then to justify breaking one of the few running services, they used the fact that they posted the breaking changes in some obscure dev channel. And then used the fact that since they posted it someone might be using it so they couldnt change it as it would break backward compatibility!

So they prioritized some theoretical possibility of violating backward compatibility for some mythical project that couldnt have been completed yet (if it even existed) over the running MGW service.

clearly they were mocking me. I had 100% of my tech built on NXT and NXT was betraying me... I said that they needed to honor their commitment for backward compatibility or I would be forced to leave NXT.

For this I am enemy #1 inside of NXT and outside of NXT I am some sort of NXT insider doing evil things

That was my perception of what happened too.  I followed all that drama closely. Looking back though, it's so great that that happened. It forced you into a fundamental redesign of how to achieve your crypto ambitions. The iterations of that redesign have turned out to be the leading blockchain infrastructure ... by far. And your dedication and daily perseverance, over many years, has attracted and inspired a deep and talented development team.  I figure that anyone who can't see all that is just doing a drive-by "analysis", which is all too common in crypto and the world at large.

@jl777c Is it possible to apply dPOW on the CryptoNight POW Algo?

[14-Feb-19 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is possible, dPoW makes no assumptions about the underlying consensus mechansm

[14-Feb-19 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
however, i dont think any cryptonight has implemented dPoW yet

[14-Feb-19 06:54 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Wow, great, would it be the same integration as what Hush did? Yes, it would be nice if dPoW would be integrated on CryptoNight based PoW.
How about CC, since CC is like a paper on how to create UTXO based Smart Contracts, do you think it is just solely for BTC based forks, or it can be applied on for example Bytecoin and others?

[14-Feb-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
in principle it would work with any utxo based coin

[14-Feb-19 09:39 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Ok, but Asset Chains "runtime forks" (man! I am amazed by this) should have an infrastructure that is the same with KMD right? Like SuperNET and komodo?

[14-Feb-19 09:40 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
or Asset Chain is `komodo` codebase native

[14-Feb-19 09:40 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
not interaction with SuperNET

[14-Feb-19 09:42 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
oh wow! I was wrong in my paper then, crap, my profs gonna kill me. But anyway thanks, @Deleted User

[14-Feb-19 09:46 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Yes, dPoW is handled in SuperNET right, since SuperNET handles `Notary Nodes`-->(Wrong again?)

[14-Feb-19 09:47 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Notary nodes should have a cnxn of the BTC network right so that it can send the KMD hash snapshot

[14-Feb-19 10:07 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay, so KMD chain is already handling dPoW. SuperNet is just the market

[14-Feb-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
SuperNET codebase has the notarizer that notaries run, but the validation of dPoW is necessarily in the KMD code

[14-Feb-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
also a lot of code is shared between the notarizer and the mm1

[14-Feb-19 10:32 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
okay, so for Asset Chain, I see that in chainparams it is a dynamic creation of some block specific data, so am I correct if the genesis Hash should be the current Komodo Hash at the time the asset chain is created?

[14-Feb-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
actually there isnt a practicalway to do runtime forks without sharing genesis block. the first mined block is really the assetchains genesis block

[14-Feb-19 10:42 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay so all asset chains hash KMD genesis block? Also the all the blocks are shared right? So there is an `is-a` relationship between the `Asset Chain` and `KMD` chain?

[14-Feb-19 10:42 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Or it is  much more complicated than that? it doesn't split blocks right?

[14-Feb-19 10:46 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@Deleted User Thanks, I am trying to look for that implementation in code

[14-Feb-19 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The params for the chain, are added to a random generation, that changes the AC's "magic" value and network ports.

[14-Feb-19 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They share genesis block but cannot sync from each other.

[14-Feb-19 10:47 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Ok thanks to you both, so basically, it is just running 2 KMD nodes with different chainparams, and in a diffrent data-dir

[14-Feb-19 10:47 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
right?

[14-Feb-19 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
params for the chain, are added to a random generation 🤷

[14-Feb-19 10:51 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Oh, data-dir is the wrong term, so its`/data-dir/<Chain>`

[14-Feb-19 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its reandom based ont eh chain params .... it takes an input that gives a determininstic ouput...

[14-Feb-19 10:52 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904

Some noob question again, so how does sending KMDs hash to Bitcoin able to share BTCs hashrate

[15-Feb-19 01:41 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
?

[15-Feb-19 01:49 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So is it like when a 51% attack happens on Komodo, they must compute for the hash from BTC(Which came from KMD NN) then compute again for the hash that in KMD(Original KMD hash)?

[15-Feb-19 02:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
@josephnicholas GMT+8 KMD sends blockhashes to BTC inside OP_RETURN data. Then all KMD nodes have consensus rules that prevent the re-organization of those blocks, hence, you would need to perform a 51% attack on BTC to accomplish the same on KMD.

[15-Feb-19 02:16 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So the dPOW implementation is not merely pointed on `KMD sends hashes to BTC` but because  of the consensus rules?

[15-Feb-19 02:16 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
nodes = NN right?
