this guy seems to not understand much of anything...

[05-Dec-18 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
each validating node is a full node and has the full blockchain, as you say. and thus can easily tell if a notarization if valid or not

[05-Dec-18 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the validating nodes are using the usual satoshi consensus to extend the blockchain. when a notarization comes in, it makes sure that it is valid, ie. that it is in its current mainchain. if not, it is ignored

[05-Dec-18 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is, then it is marked as notarized and will in the future refused to reorganize it

[05-Dec-18 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
this is a block that the validating node already had as in its mainchain

[05-Dec-18 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not trusting any external node about anything

[05-Dec-18 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it is validating on its own that the notarization blockhash is a valid blockhash on its mainchain

if notary nodes are taken over and only invalid notarizations are coming in, it would have the same effect as no notarizations happening

[05-Dec-18 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
which in itself is an indicator that something is wrong and for the nodes that use the "confirmations" field, it will use the dpowconfs logic automatically and basically stop processing any deposits until valid notarizations are happening again

`Got it, that's helpful - thanks! So there is still a problem of, if I know who the notaries are, I can potentially corrupt them. And as jl777 points out, that is as good as there being no notaries whatsoever. Which then opens up the KMD chain to 51% attack. But, I understand that the probability is low of that happening. It's just that, whenever there is a cap on participants who can notarize, that is always a strictly worse arrangement than having a market-based open system for anyone to participate in the notarization process.`

[05-Dec-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
not necessarily true. just because you have a market-baased open system for anyone to participate, doesnt mean that there is consistent participation. especially when it comes to upfronting BTC costs. what if you get only a sparse participation from the market based system as opposed to consistent dPoW notarizations? do you still prefer the market based system?

[05-Dec-18 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
until the market based system is proven to provide consistent notarizations, it is an unproven system to secure a chain

[05-Dec-18 05:15 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
perfect, answered

Anyone can participate in the notary node elections even projects that are outside of KMD ...they can run for a notary node. If they have a big community they could win some notary nodes if they are really interested in having a participation.

[07-Dec-18 04:42 AM] peritonlogon#7708
Is there any way, or has anyone ever tried, or worked toward, making a blockchain that is resistant to forks splitting the chain in two?

[07-Dec-18 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant do that

[07-Dec-18 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD is somewhat there as hte 64 notary nodes determine the "real" chain... but if they have a disagreement ... then the same thing could happen.

[07-Dec-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Chain splits are just going to happen, the best chain will win... Its only a short term problem.

[07-Dec-18 07:17 AM] Mylo#8306
the NN "determine" the chain because they mine 75% of blocks that are verified across the network and every ~10 blocks multi sig agree (notarize) on the current blockhash (fingerprint) into bitcoin network

the process of notarizing into bitcoin every 10 blocks makes it very difficult to fork, because the network consensus (on every node) checks this notarization hash.   making block re-organization in the past very shallow and ineffective.

[07-Dec-18 07:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If there is a community disagreement and half the nodes decide to notarise 1 chain and the other half anohter though... its the same. You cant really avoid a chain split/fork at least I think thats what he was reffering to ... like the split of BTC.

[07-Dec-18 07:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats a political thing ... a winner will emerge in the end.

He is totally wrong: "Well, if my suspicions are correct, then the original chain is dropped in favor of the attacker‚Äôs longer chain. The greyed-out arrow indicates that the network ignores the notarization as inaccurate"

[07-Dec-18 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
once a height is notarized, it is not dropped, reorganized, etc. so his entire premise (dPoW works just like PoW) is incorrect

[07-Dec-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
also he is conflating the easy mining KMD does for only KMD, that is not really linked to dPoW at all, it just happens that for KMD the notaries get easy mining, when notarizing other chains NN have no mining advantages

all nodes verify all notarizations, so it is validated by all nodes and does not allow NN to have any special powers. Once a notarization is validated locally, it will reject any attempt to reorg, so his picture above is totally invalid

he starts from the assumption that dPoW doesnt do anything and then concludes exactly that by demonstrating if it did nothing, what it would be doing

Can do that in one sentence. 
`The nodes need to determine if they will accept or reject the new chain. More on that later, but let‚Äôs suppose that the nodes will accept the chain with more difficulty for now.`
They will reject it.

Hi Justin,
Thanks for the article. I think there are a some misunderstandings. On the recent Tech Tuesday for Komodo [1] I've detailed the process of dPoW that might clear up the caveats section?¬†
Figure 3 in your article is not possible. An attacker cannot mine past a notarization point and have the rest of the network just accept the attackers chain. If you read the Tech Tuesday (last article), the notarization hashes form part of the network wide consensus. The attacker does not have the recent hashes and will be ignored. The way you've drawn Figure 3 is just normal PoW ignoring dPoW features in the consensus.
Also, the KMD easy mining is only for KMD chain. Notary nodes do not get easy mining for any other chains.
Come to the komodo discord to discuss for any further discussion.
All the best with your writing, thanks for taking the time to check out dPoW‚Ää-‚Ääit has a history of protecting weaker chains.

@KomodoWorld @satindergrewal If this is the case, what prevents nodes from notarizing malicious blocks? These nodes could mine their own chain and completely reject the traditional PoW system then.

sigh....

[07-Dec-18 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
ALL nodes in the network need to validate blocks normally. ALL nodes in the network validate that all notarizations are valid. If anybody tries to reorg the chain past a validated notarization, it is rejected.

[07-Dec-18 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
What is a malicious block? If it includes a double spend, then it is invalid, and will be rejected. All blocks need to be valid to be validated

[07-Dec-18 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
Now the blocks that are not notarized are subject to the normal rules, but once notarized (and validated) it is not accepted to change it. any block that tries to change it is rejected. There is no valid block that is malicious, as it is a valid block. Once it gets notarized, then it cant change.

[07-Dec-18 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
At the moment of notarization, there can only be a single spend as at that moment in time the chain is valid, the notarization is valid, ALL nodes validate it. Once that happens, any tx that is notarized wont be able to be double spent as that would violate the notarization rule

the notaries notarize the public chain

[07-Dec-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise ALL the nodes in the network wouldnt validate it as a valid notarization

[07-Dec-18 05:07 PM] sgp#7572
Why do they need to do that though? Why not mine a private chain and only reveal to the network when notarized?

[07-Dec-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
how can it get notarized if it isnt public?

[07-Dec-18 05:07 PM] sgp#7572
They make it public as they notarize it

[07-Dec-18 05:08 PM] sgp#7572
but they notarize the data that doesn't include their transaction

[07-Dec-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i think you are missing that it is mutually exclusive

[07-Dec-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
a block is notarized or not

[07-Dec-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is privately mined, it cant be notarized and validated

[07-Dec-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so the only way is to publish the private blocks and then notarize it

[07-Dec-18 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
once it is notarized, it cant be undone

[07-Dec-18 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
as the nodes already validated it with the initial tx

[07-Dec-18 05:10 PM] sgp#7572
Doesn't the ability to rule over any unruly PoW chains though also mean that they can rule over any non-malicious PoW chains? I don't understand how the scenario would prevent the notaries from acting malicious

[07-Dec-18 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no "ruling over"

[07-Dec-18 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
the notaries run normal nodes

[07-Dec-18 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
then then reach a consensus as to what a specific height blockhash is

[07-Dec-18 05:11 PM] sgp#7572
my point is simply to emphasize that the notarized blocks are valued more in consensus than non-notarized ones

[07-Dec-18 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[07-Dec-18 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
let me finish before you jump to your conclusion

[07-Dec-18 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
the notaries send out a tx with the height + blockhash of a recent block, usually 10 blocks from the last one

[07-Dec-18 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
this then gets mined by some miner (plz ignore that notaries easy mine KMD, that is nothing to do with notarization)

[07-Dec-18 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
now, when that notarization tx gets mined into a block, ALL nodes see it, ALL nodes check locally if indeed at the height that it had the same blockhash that they already had locally

[07-Dec-18 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no forcing a tainted block onto the other nodes

[07-Dec-18 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
if and only if a valid notarization is seen is the notarization height changed locally. this is done by all nodes (including the notaries)

[07-Dec-18 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
once we have this notarized (and validated by all nodes) height, each node then applies it as a test for all new blocks coming in. If it tries to reorg past the notarized height, it is rejected

[07-Dec-18 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so, once a tx gets notarized, it cant be double spent

[07-Dec-18 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
this has been tested extensively internally and also live in the field

[07-Dec-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW does not protect blocks that have not been notarized yet, that uses the normal satoshi consensus

[07-Dec-18 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
@sgp curious as to what problems you see. I am eager to fix any actual problems

[07-Dec-18 05:22 PM] sgp#7572
What would happen in an example were a malicious notary creates a new chain from the point of the last notarization and notarizes the next block at the expected blockchain height? It's my understanding the nodes would drop the other PoW chain in favor of the malicious one

[07-Dec-18 05:25 PM] Mylo#8306
notarization is a multi-signature process between 13 randomly allocated nodes (out of the 64).  a single notary cannot "just notarize if they want to".  it is distributed process.

[07-Dec-18 05:25 PM] sgp#7572

one malicious notary cant do anything, so we need to assume enough malicious notaries are colluding.
