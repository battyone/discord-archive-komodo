Minute 16 and onward?

15:55

[10-Jun-18 07:43 AM] cryptoon#0000
Is that you at 17:45?

[10-Jun-18 07:44 AM] cryptoon#0000
Cool if you would be able to pay taxes in crypto as suggested in the vid

[10-Jun-18 07:44 AM] cryptoon#0000
Would migate a lot of the risk involved with the crypto to usd pairings fluctuations

[10-Jun-18 07:45 AM] ludom#0000
It's not sure but I'm working on it

[10-Jun-18 07:46 AM] ludom#0000
Right now I'm not able to pay taxes in crypto but I hope it will be possible next year

[10-Jun-18 07:48 AM] cryptoon#0000
That’s a problem

[10-Jun-18 07:48 AM] cryptoon#0000
But if the profit is xx kmd

[10-Jun-18 07:48 AM] cryptoon#0000
You can pay kmd taxes regardless of its fiat value

[10-Jun-18 07:49 AM] cryptoon#0000
Let’s say your yearly income is determined at the moment when kmd was 12$ and you have to pay taxes on that amount

[10-Jun-18 07:50 AM] polycryptoblog#0000
You can use the loss to offset other gains

[10-Jun-18 07:54 AM] ludom#0000
If KMD is at 12$, no problem to pay taxes

[10-Jun-18 07:55 AM] cryptoon#0000
<@U0JUJF8RX> but if you have a situation like the first half of the year, where the mcap declines 60-70%

[10-Jun-18 07:56 AM] cryptoon#0000
Not many gains left I assume to actually pay the taxes with

[10-Jun-18 07:56 AM] cryptoon#0000
Because taxes are due after the fact

[10-Jun-18 07:58 AM] ludom#0000
The taxes are in relation with the value of profit

[10-Jun-18 07:59 AM] ludom#0000
And profit are defined at the 31.12 of the year

[10-Jun-18 07:59 AM] ludom#0000
So I just need to know how many I should pay at this moment and convert it

[10-Jun-18 08:02 AM] ludom#0000
It's not so difficult to manage

[10-Jun-18 08:03 AM] ludom#0000
But book keeping with crypto assets and FIAT is a little tricky

[10-Jun-18 08:06 AM] cryptoon#0000

it sounds like EOS is trying to do what KMD has in testing right now

[10-Jun-18 09:43 AM] cryptoon#0000
The EOS ICO was open to investors for 12 months. However, funds paid were not in lock-up during this period and secondary markets for EOS were opened with high liquidity. Therefore, as far as I can reason, the following scenario was a possibility for Block.One: Have people buy EOS → Use their funds to buy EOS in your own ICO → Have both the funds and the EOS → Repeat → Watch EOS price rise as it looks like the interest in your ICO is gigantic → Start selling your free EOS on secondary markets → profit.

[10-Jun-18 09:43 AM] cryptoon#0000
didnt think of this one yet

[10-Jun-18 09:52 AM] jl777#0000
they would never do anything like that, would they?

[10-Jun-18 09:52 AM] jl777#0000
they promise that EOS is... oh, that's right they put in the contract EOS might not have any value...

[10-Jun-18 09:52 AM] jl777#0000
so even if they did the above, it might be within what is allowed with the contract!

[10-Jun-18 01:35 PM] dan#0000
The problem with crypto taxes is it forces you to sell if you don't have the funds . If one bought kmd at ico and sold kmd at 12 cause they want to hold btc, they have to sell their btc (let's say the same year at a lost at current prices) to not owe those taxes

Hi @geforce209ad

[10-Jun-18 09:48 PM] maegus#0000
Yea I wouldn't touch EOS with a 10ft pole way too many promises and nothing delivered but they sure have a ton of money.

[11-Jun-18 12:43 AM] dragonrider-e#0000
At least here i can see the messages.

[11-Jun-18 01:23 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Dan Larimer and most of his family are pretty much scammers. How EOS got such a high valuation is beyond me, but with a year long ICO, they could have used early ETH raised to pump the price quite easily.

[11-Jun-18 06:07 AM] passcombo.com#0000
why you think Dan is scammer ?

[11-Jun-18 06:40 AM] cryptoon#0000
Never finished a project in his life etc

[11-Jun-18 06:41 AM] passcombo.com#0000
so maybe this will be the first one finished? 😛

[11-Jun-18 06:41 AM] passcombo.com#0000
depends how you define finished

[11-Jun-18 06:42 AM] cryptoon#0000
I dont know too much about Dan

[11-Jun-18 06:42 AM] cryptoon#0000
But read some history on Brock Pierce

[11-Jun-18 06:42 AM] cryptoon#0000
And that one was not pretty

[11-Jun-18 08:52 AM] imylomylo#0000
good links, thanks @noashh

[11-Jun-18 09:03 AM] jl777#0000
to be fair, dan larimer got bitshares and steemit to a pretty complete state before moving on. As far as the EOS, if they really did raise $4 bil and will be funding projects to airdrop to EOS holders, it does seem a clever scheme. Not sure if regulations will arise that prevents this, but the larimers have been clever regarding regulations in the past, so it might well be resistant to regulators (for a while). The big problem is what to do with such a large amount of funds. Efficient VC process doesnt throw around more than a few million into very promising startups, unless it is a later stage investment. Having 10x to 100x the funds could easily lead to inefficient investments of capital. Will be interesting to see if they can find the future googles or pets.com

Very good speech on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/komodoplatform/comments/8obh8c/teaser_jl777_discusses_scaling_tech_and_kmd/)
I checked many other projects (like you probably) and never found something as decentralized and secure as POW (for entrepreneurship i mean, for a currency there is already BTC)

But, if there's anyone real here, is there any news on Hush notarization activation? Is there an official announcement coming? I saw a post earlier saying it'd be activating this week.

Also looks like bridgebot is bridging to the wrong chat 😉

[11-Jun-18 07:48 PM] jl777#0000
not all bridges bridge correctly. I am surprised there arent any infinite loops

[11-Jun-18 07:49 PM] jl777#0000
HUSH notarization will likely be a work in progress for a bit, at best this week, but dont rely on this
