@jpsyduck The marketing team has started reviewing all the infographics. For now, the plan is to release a list of finalists at the end of the week and hold a round of community voting. Then the team will take community voting and feedback into consideration, make some tough decisions, and announce the winners next week (~Oct 8).

[03-Oct-18 07:09 PM] jpsyduck#9038

[04-Oct-18 12:00 PM] djwillz#1514
can i use agama wallet from ther site to get 5 percent

[04-Oct-18 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
the blockchain awards the 5%

[04-Oct-18 12:01 PM] djwillz#1514
so im good to go with that wallet

[04-Oct-18 12:02 PM] BlockTech#6895
Yes, just download agama, get an address, buy > 10 kmd, move it to your wallet, and keep it in there. You'll earn 5% "Interest" per years on your 10kmd.

[04-Oct-18 12:02 PM] BlockTech#6895
you just have to claim it once a month

[04-Oct-18 12:02 PM] djwillz#1514
cool i thought it was 5 percent a month i read lol
