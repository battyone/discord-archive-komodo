not sure of details, it seems very similar from user end point. there's a r/Coda reddit if you have questions but it's quite desert

`Also, who accepts 0conf transactions? That's hardly a "double spend"`

I have no idea, I try my best not to use bitpay and dumped the vast majority of my BCH long ago

[09-Dec-18 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has fundamental objections to 3rd party services that "pretend" to pay in crypto, when in reality the service keeps the crypto and pays fiat_

[09-Dec-18 02:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because if I pay $1000 for something and use bitpay and BTC jumps back to $7k, then bitpay makes more off my transaction than the merchant did (even assuming the merchant had $0 production cots)

[09-Dec-18 02:59 PM] PTYX#6840
it makes you a fiat enabler :trollface:

[09-Dec-18 03:00 PM] PTYX#6840
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 the same goes if btc sharts

[09-Dec-18 03:00 PM] PTYX#6840
the merchant isn't exposed to the market price

[09-Dec-18 03:00 PM] PTYX#6840
which is the whole point

[09-Dec-18 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
why should a disinterested 3rd party __ever__ make more off my transaction than the total of the transaction 😕

[09-Dec-18 03:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not to mention the realty that it keeps crypto in the realm of "internet money" and not "actual" currency

[09-Dec-18 03:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes it's convenient to get fiat for a fiat exchange
much like it's convenient to pay a hooker to get laid and actually get laid

🤔 

[09-Dec-18 03:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from a merchant standpoint, it's meaningless hype, they set price in fiat and get what they set (that they "accept crypto" is just "fake news" and a complete farce)

[09-Dec-18 03:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but they really aren't
it's like me saying that I'll sell you my rigs for 100k KMD
*but only if you send your KMD to someone neither of us knows and they actually send me new rigs instead, because I have no actual want/use for KMD

[09-Dec-18 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
bitpay is nothing more than a circlejerk of blowing smoke up eachother's asses

[09-Dec-18 03:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but it is great for their shareholders ....

I could call the moon "a goat"
but that's not true either

[09-Dec-18 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at best, it's a "fiat cul-de-sac"

@Alright 
Simplified Payment Verification:
```
A Bitcoin implementation that does not verify everything, but instead relies on either connecting to a trusted node, or puts its faith in high difficulty as a proxy for proof of validity. BitCoinJ is an implementation of this mode.
```

But the ZKP he is proposing will validate every block from the genesis block in ( O(1) time ) and can store a single state which will be the proof and requirement for validating further blocks. Like in Coda, may be 1 kb of data will be enough to validate the whole chain.

[09-Dec-18 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it has little to do with SPV, the coda

That means that no matter how many transactions are performed, verifying the blockchain remains inexpensive and accessible to everyone.

I shied away from the Agama wallet a long time ago because it was a bit glitchy and stored my KMD in the Guarda wallet. Does anyone know if Guarda will be set up for the fork? Or will I have a hard time accessing my KMD and need to think about transferring my KMD to Agama this week?

[09-Dec-18 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Do you posses the priv keys to the addy in Guarda wallet?

[09-Dec-18 04:55 PM] Nabob#5004
Send your funds to agama wallet or Paper wallet and have seed or Private keys with you. , instead You can use Agama mobile version also.
For any further issues, you can right to our support support@komodoplatform.com @D-Day_68

[09-Dec-18 04:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If have privkey(s) there shouldn't be any reason to "send"/"transfer", just import into updated Agama and you're ready to roll

[09-Dec-18 05:00 PM] Alright#0419
@D-Day_68 Agama has come a long way in past couple months, would recommend giving it a second chance

Yes - I have the PK.

[09-Dec-18 05:02 PM] SHossain#0007
If you have private key, then you are ok. you can use it anytime to login into agama

[09-Dec-18 05:03 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have an Android or iOS device, you can currently get the Agama mobile wallet and use the private key to login and keep using mobile version. they are sapling ready already.

[09-Dec-18 05:05 PM] D-Day_68#7885
Thanks for the responses everybody! Might give Agama a look this week and contemplate moving them over.

[09-Dec-18 05:05 PM] SHossain#0007
I use Agama 95% of the time when i need to use crypto.

[09-Dec-18 05:11 PM] D-Day_68#7885
@SHossain I don't use mobiles at all to access crypto. Only desktop for me.  
Does Agama desktop make it easy to import my PK?

[09-Dec-18 05:12 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, it is easy. you dont' even have to import privkey. you can just choose Lite mode and log in directly using the privkey. no chain database download required

[09-Dec-18 05:12 PM] SHossain#0007
but, if you prefer to use native mode, you can import the key.

[09-Dec-18 05:13 PM] D-Day_68#7885
Sorry - still learning....  
"Native mode"?

[09-Dec-18 05:15 PM] SHossain#0007
Native mode where you have to download the full database before you can start using your funds

[09-Dec-18 05:16 PM] D-Day_68#7885
Gotcha!

[09-Dec-18 05:16 PM] SHossain#0007

[09-Dec-18 10:46 PM] luxgo#9804
i saw 1hr 51% attack cost even for BTC is only $200k in https://www.crypto51.app/ isn't it too cheap for the rest of the coins? Still can dPOW protection work well?

[09-Dec-18 11:01 PM] Alright#0419
@luxgo that cost for BTC is based on SHA256 hash rental rates. There isn't nearly enough SHA256 available to rent, so you would need some connections to find the rest of the hash.

[09-Dec-18 11:01 PM] Alright#0419
Mind you, those connections would be working against their best interest, so it's a very unlikely scenario

[09-Dec-18 11:17 PM] luxgo#9804
@Alright ok, thanks for the kind explanation.

[09-Dec-18 11:39 PM] luxgo#9804
more question about dPOW.. if a coin buy dPOW protection, its blockchain must be delayed to get a confirm or sync with its copy on BTC and KMD?

[09-Dec-18 11:57 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
what's the question? That sounds more like a statement with a question mark at the end?

[10-Dec-18 12:00 AM] luxgo#9804
@NutellaLicka sorry about the text error.. i edited it now.

[10-Dec-18 12:01 AM] Alright#0419
The blockchain itself isn't "delayed". It's just that you would wait until it was notarized to KMD to consider it secure

[10-Dec-18 12:03 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Are all notarisations conducted every 10 blocks? Or is this adjustable?

[10-Dec-18 12:03 AM] SHossain#0007
adjustable

[10-Dec-18 12:03 AM] SHossain#0007
default is 10

[10-Dec-18 12:03 AM] Alright#0419
Can be adjusted, default is just 10

[10-Dec-18 12:04 AM] Alright#0419
every 5 blocks would cost twice as much in notarization tx fees

[10-Dec-18 12:04 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Makes sense

[10-Dec-18 12:05 AM] luxgo#9804
wait what? wait to confirm the every withdrawal and deposit in wallets or exchanges until it was notarized by dPOW protection?

[10-Dec-18 12:06 AM] Alright#0419
you should wait for a transaction to be notarized before you give anything of value for the coins

[10-Dec-18 12:06 AM] Alright#0419
that make sense?

[10-Dec-18 12:07 AM] Alright#0419
take BTC for example, exchange might wait for 3 confs before they consider it secure. An exchange accepting asset chain deposits can just wait for notarization to KMD to consider a transaction secure

[10-Dec-18 12:07 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So theoretically, if an attack was to occur perfectly on the 9th block before notarisation, there would be 8-9 blocks that can't be retrieved? How long does it take to call upon a notarised block and use it in the main chain again?

[10-Dec-18 12:08 AM] Alright#0419
unnotarized blocks are as secure as the hashrate used to secure them

[10-Dec-18 12:08 AM] Alright#0419
notarized blocks are secured by KMD + BTC hashrate

[10-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Alright#0419
Don't quite understand your questions @NutellaLicka, but best practice for an asset chain is to not consider a transaction secure until it is notarized

[10-Dec-18 12:11 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah okay that makes sense. If there was an attack on a chain (say at block 1000), how exactly does a chain use the last notarised block (say 9995) to take the chain back to before the attack?

[10-Dec-18 12:11 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Is it an automatic process, or is it manual?

[10-Dec-18 12:17 AM] Alright#0419
Everything is automatic

[10-Dec-18 12:17 AM] Alright#0419
A notarized block cannot be reorged. It's as simple as that.

[10-Dec-18 12:18 AM] Alright#0419
If block 1000 is notarized, you cannot replace block 1000 in any circumstance

[10-Dec-18 12:19 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Unless it's a double chain notarization with 100% Notary collusion with just a dash of pixie dust :trollface:

{Reactions}
🤣 (3) 

[10-Dec-18 12:23 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So the chain can still be reorg'd prior to a notarisation (inbetween the 10 blocks) if they can 51% the chain hash rate

[10-Dec-18 12:23 AM] Alright#0419
Yes

[10-Dec-18 12:23 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Will the notaries notarise that reorg'd chain then?

[10-Dec-18 12:23 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[10-Dec-18 12:24 AM] Alright#0419
Do you know of any services that will give you something of value in return before 10 confs?

[10-Dec-18 12:24 AM] Alright#0419
please let me know if you do :trollface:

[10-Dec-18 12:28 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I do not 😛 Just trying to gain a better understanding of how it works. I'm sure there are smarter people than me that would try and find a way to exploit that!

[Announcement] A BANK FOR KOMODO
IndéNodes (@Ludom  , @Yassin and @eclips) provide great notary node services and have supported the ecosystem since the launch of Komodo platform.
But today, we are proud to announce a new exciting project:  ØPay, the launch of bank services directly bundled with Komodo. 
ØPay is a service provided by Ø Crypto Union. It's a banking app (currently WIP) that use KMD as native currency, allowing users to make FIAT loans with KMD as collateral.

We invite you to test the ØPay app that already integrates KMD (please note that while in beta caution is adviced). 
Ø Crypto Union has all the benefits of an EMI banking licence and has been developing their services since July 2017.
ØPay technology and services are just at the beginning, and we hope it'll continue to improve in the future. In order to achieve this, they need the support of the Komodo Community!

This project, if successful, provides interesting benefits to our ecosystem:
- A new company and his experimented team (developers, marketing, management, banking experience, and legal advisors) integrate into the Komodo ecosystem and work to develop it.
- A direct gateway between the banking world and our decentralised ecosystem; 
- The launch of asset chains with interesting and unique properties (stable coins, loan interests, etc) with a regulated, legally compliant banking platform.
- Providing banking services for the Komodo users
- Proving the power of our technology to support true banking assets
- Make connections with other cryptocurrencies that can possibly use ØPay services in the future.

[10-Dec-18 08:49 AM] Ludom#5832
We propose today this partnership and ask for the support of the community because we trust in the project. @Ludom (IndéNodes's manager) has signed guarantees that ØPay and Ø Crypto Union will work for the long-term with Komodo ecosystem:
- KMD will be the currency for dividends, interests and other profits of banking assets.
- KMD and BTC tokens will be prioritised for all new services proposed by ØPay.
- We met the Ø Crypto Union team IRL and we noted all the work already realised (development of the ØPay app, obtaining a banking licence, building an experienced team)
- All of the financial services of Ø will be moved and built on the top of Komodo technology where possible: asset chains, atomic swap, etc. 
- @Ludom is now part of the Ø Crypto Union board and no new tokens can be added without his permission. No strategical decisions can be made without his agreement.

Komodo (14) 

[10-Dec-18 08:54 AM] Ludom#5832
After this explanation, I have to clarify what help is needed from the Komodo community:
1) We need people to test the ØPay application and we need your feedback to improve ØPay technology and services.
We invite you into the discord Ø & Komodo for further information.
https://discord.gg/mqQNvUz

2) Ø Crypto Union needs financial assistance. They have worked hard since July 2017 and the key requirements to launch the service have been reached: app and banking licence. Now, however, they are short of funds to develop what they have built. Their needs are reasonable: 125k KMD
To fund this 125k KMD, they don’t propose a traditional ICO. This is not about betting on an idea or a white paper, it’s about delivering projects and services.
You can send KMD to RXQpT2t2FyFSNTWtgMq594nwGrsHtpknxD (address owned by @jl777c who escrows the funds). At each 25k KMD financing milestone, Ø Crypto Union will develop a new service on ØPay:
1) Launch of an asset chain and a new token KSB, a stable coin backed by debt.
2) Migration of our security token (GXE on Ethereum) to a Komodo asset chain (OUR token).
3) Create a line of credit with your KMD in collateral.
4) Standard credit/debit card allowing you to buy natively in Komodo.
5) Further integration of a Komodo Wallet with multisig and other features.

The funds are escrowed until the service is delivered and tested by the community.
To thank all the people who help to finance the projects, you’ll receive 7 OUR token for each KMD you send.
OUR tokens are the shares of the Ø Crypto Union, it’s a security token.

[10-Dec-18 08:54 AM] Ludom#5832
I invite you to visit the dedicated crowdfunding webpage: https://ocryptounion.io/komodo-campaign/

We’ll be very happy to answer your questions on the Ø & Komodo Discord or you can contact privately @forkhembo, @Adli, @I_R_Ben or me.
I really hope this announcement make you as excited as me and I hope the Komodo community will answer positively to the crowdfunding campaign.
Cheers !!!

[10-Dec-18 02:09 PM] Mister.G#3159
will we receive our KMD back if they fail to deliver?

[10-Dec-18 02:11 PM] I_R_Ben#9254
The funds are only unlocked upon delivery of each milestone 👍

[10-Dec-18 02:11 PM] Mister.G#3159
but will we receive our KMD back if OCU fails to deliver?

[10-Dec-18 02:13 PM] I_R_Ben#9254
Yes this is why the escrow, when each milestone is reached Ø delivers proof of the working concept, and onyl then do we receive anything, if the product doesn't deliver then the funds don't get released.
