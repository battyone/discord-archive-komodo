One question, if i activate hush coin on agama wallet, and then i close agama wallet, if i open again hush wallet its not there anymore..why ?

[01-Feb-19 04:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Roxin because Agama would take forever to load if it maintained a running list of coins

[01-Feb-19 04:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There is a way you can have it remember the coins activated

[01-Feb-19 04:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I you add 10 coins and it has to load all 10 at once, performance is actually slower than 1 at a time

[01-Feb-19 04:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think this will help @Roxin

[01-Feb-19 04:03 PM] Roxin#4844
So if i mine hush coin on agama wallet ..after i close agama and open again, i have to activate again hush and coins will be there ?

[01-Feb-19 04:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yes

[01-Feb-19 04:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_wasn't aware that was added and goes away now_

[01-Feb-19 04:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
you theory about it being slower can still be valid though CG

[01-Feb-19 04:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the option is there for those who want/need it

[01-Feb-19 04:04 PM] Roxin#4844
Lite option or native ?

[01-Feb-19 04:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not "can", it factually "is" because of throughput

[01-Feb-19 04:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
both are an option @Roxin

[01-Feb-19 04:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think this feature was added in the not too distant past, saving the added coins

[01-Feb-19 04:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but if mining to a certain adress you will need to select the right one

[01-Feb-19 04:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
couple of months ago at least

[01-Feb-19 04:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and coins will be there ?`
coins stay with the address no matter what wallet you use or how many times you close/open it 😉

✅ 

[01-Feb-19 04:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if you use lite mode, use the same passphrase and you will see the same adress and your coins

[01-Feb-19 04:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if you use native login using the same wallet.dat and you will see your adresses and coins 😃

question regarding the strategic parthership - does it include listing of all KMD tokens there? 😃

Another hint and probably the last one: in order to crack this cryptopuzzle you need the solved sudoku, the heart or brain of komodo aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand a "special feature" of Agama" #cryptopuzzle #kmd #komodo #btc #crackme #hackme - join for discussion: https://t.co/cX3WDq...

I'm start thinking about BIP39 mnemonic ... puzzle got even harder with latest hint )

[01-Feb-19 06:41 PM] Decker#3767
We can generate 9 or 24 words from sudoku solution and use it to obtain BIP32 Root Key, or we can use entire sudoku solution as a "Custom Seed or Brain Wallet" to generate root key ... oh ... tons of variants )

[01-Feb-19 06:42 PM] ca333#0118
no - its not. i will add this to the tweet. 

sometimes something is too complex to understand. but sometimes it is just too simple to get the mind around it!

@grewalsatinder here you have a nice CA quote ^

[01-Feb-19 06:42 PM] ca333#0118
but thanks for the above inputs @Decker - at some point i am going to use your bip39 idea for a puzzle level.

quick access -> tools -> seed to key pair

[01-Feb-19 07:00 PM] Decker#3767
Seed to keypair - is the same as you enter passphrase at login.

[01-Feb-19 07:00 PM] ph03nix#3115
maybe it's the new feature "this transaction is secured with dPoW"

[01-Feb-19 07:00 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
and what does the toggle?

[01-Feb-19 07:04 PM] Decker#3767
The only thing - may be passphrase from solution and brain/heart is not "Iguana / Agama" compatible, may be it's just a SHA256-based brain wallet.

[01-Feb-19 07:04 PM] Strob#3417
I tried all my combinations  with both Iguana off and on...

[01-Feb-19 07:06 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
@Decker  probably you re right.  ca333 said its the key for the seed

[01-Feb-19 07:41 PM] Decker#3767
Agama can generate addresses / wifs from seed 2 different ways:

1. Same way as Iguana Core / Komodo ICO App.
2. With only SHA256(passphrase), as Bitcoin brain wallet.
3. BIP39 things, but seems we shouldn't count it in this puzzle.

So, only 1 and 2 remains. I checked it both ... "Solution + brain/heart"as passphrase doesn't give needed RMwxXySEWXmGAtianHv79pUNWamwTVb2zB address . I checked too many combinations ... but all are failed.

[01-Feb-19 07:43 PM] Decker#3767
@ca333 let's make a deal )) You'll give us other hint ... and i will fund RMwxXySEWXmGAtianHv79pUNWamwTVb2zB by 1 SUPERNET )

[01-Feb-19 07:44 PM] ca333#0118

Like a generate some BTC address and add `jl777` and use as seed

[01-Feb-19 07:47 PM] Decker#3767

yes - its simple @Decker  - just tricky))

[01-Feb-19 07:49 PM] Decker#3767
Plz, don't tell me that it need to use address from passphrase as another passphrase )

no 😂

Passphrase inside passphrase inside passphrase 😂

Feature before login ... Before login we can encrypt seed ... but i don't think that the solution is to encrypt "sudoku solution" with "brain/heart" and try to use encrypted "pin name" as passphrase.
