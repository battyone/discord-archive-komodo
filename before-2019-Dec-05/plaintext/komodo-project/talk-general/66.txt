has "sidechains" for komodo as "in progress", seeing as we have about 35 asset chains in production, that's clearly wrong

[14-Sep-18 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you totally ignore the independent chains and require a strict implementation of a 1:1 pegged sidechain

[14-Sep-18 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
there probably isnt a place for crossh chain contracts

[14-Sep-18 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
or notarization

It should be added to Agama I think. But since the have their own wallet it's not necessary

How many active users per day are trading on the mainnet?  I'm debating Richard Heart.  He claims the dex has "no users."
or... another question.  How many trades are done per day?  Is that knowable?

Lots of great technologies went through lulls in their adoption. I forsee eventuaally people will be forced into DEX's or risk having their wealth captured by the state.

[15-Sep-18 09:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
Dex has low usage now, much as cars had low usage in 1900

[15-Sep-18 09:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
but there were cars in 1900

[15-Sep-18 09:24 AM] actionslacks#4072
and we have the ONLY atomic swap dex

[15-Sep-18 09:24 AM] actionslacks#4072
that works

[15-Sep-18 09:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
And If I'm not mistaken, cmc only polls one Net ID. which means there could be all kinds of trades that are only accounted for via dex fees.

[15-Sep-18 10:04 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
We know it's a matter of time, releasing the improvements both back-end and front-end and growing the ecosystem

Be aware that Ravencoin is a new and experimental protocol, be cautious.

Double spend and 51% attacks are a risk with all crypto projects and are a higher risk for smaller projects.

I didn‚Äôt update my agama wallet in time , how will this effect the kmd I have in it ?

[16-Sep-18 12:10 PM] Hermes#6934
After 1 mm the only effect that could have happened for old wallet users was that transactions wouldn't be broadcasted to the main net , Lite mode users wouldn't have this issue , but to answer your question  if you update your  wallet  even if you were using native now you should be ok @Jonboy05 .

Can someone explain to me what is REVS & revshares ?  I can kinda figure out it's some kind of revenue sharing if you hold REVS tokens, but couldn't  find any details

[16-Sep-18 02:48 PM] CHMEX#0686
REVS get a revenue Share from other assets like CRYPTO DEX JUMBLR in a chart it's mentioned it gets 5% this number might have changed a bit
In december with the last CRYPTO Payout which was approx 50 BTC REVS received 0.00853 KMD / REVS

Hey guys, I'm relatively new to Komodo and want to ask something about the privacy. On the Komodo's website it says " In its most simple form, the Komodo coin can be used to make purchases with privacy." 
Does this mean the Komodo coin is anonymous by default? And only other coins on the Komodo platform have to use Jumblr?

[16-Sep-18 03:06 PM] jspook16#3059
i believe Komodo is transparent by default but allows for private transactions (like zcash). On top of that, jl777 added the jumblr functionality for an added level of privacy.

[16-Sep-18 03:06 PM] Audo#5667
There are two types of transactions: transparent (T) and private (Z).

In addition we have a feature called 'Jumblr' that automatises the process of funneling funds through a Z-address back to a fresh T-address.

[16-Sep-18 03:07 PM] jspook16#3059
yes what @Audo said üòÉ

[16-Sep-18 03:07 PM] Audo#5667
you were faster üòâ

[16-Sep-18 03:08 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah but you're part of the team so your answer is official. Are private transactions only available on native? (as well as jumblr?)

[16-Sep-18 03:09 PM] Ray Uber#2790
Is there also a fee for use of private transaction? Or only if you use Jumblr (0,3%)

[16-Sep-18 03:12 PM] Audo#5667
yes you need to run native mode (download the blockchain) to use the Z-addresses & Jumblr.

That might change though, form what I understand, as the Zcash devs are working on something. I don't have the full picture, but it sounds like we might be able to do lightweidght z-transactions in the future.

I believe z-transactions have the standard tx fee, same as t-transactions. Jumblr has an additional fee, yes.

[16-Sep-18 03:18 PM] Ray Uber#2790
thx, got it üëç 
but does this apply only on KMD coin or on every coin on the KMD platform?

[16-Sep-18 03:21 PM] jspook16#3059
jumblr is kmd specific from what i understand. I am not sure about the private transactions (whether that applies to just kmd or any asset chain). Also, since ive never actually used this functionality in komodo, i dont know if jumblr is an optional feature or if its part of every private transaction. I think it is optional.

[16-Sep-18 03:25 PM] Ray Uber#2790
I mean do the other coins on KMD platform also have the option to choose between t and z transaction. Since they are forks from KMD

[16-Sep-18 03:25 PM] Audo#5667
Jumblr is just for KMD. The private z-transactions are available by default for new assetchains, but that is an optional feature.

The latest development was that now even the T-transactions can be disabled on a new assetchain. That's what the #pirate project is about.... it only has Z-transactions enabled

[16-Sep-18 03:27 PM] Audo#5667
so yes @Ray Uber , a project can chose to have a) T + Z, b) T onlye, c) Z only

[16-Sep-18 03:30 PM] jspook16#3059
Can I make a z transaction without the jumblr functionality or is jumblr mandatory with every z transaction?

[16-Sep-18 03:31 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yes you can without jumblr

[16-Sep-18 03:31 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it is just an address , much like in zcash

[16-Sep-18 03:32 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Jumblr is an extra feature

[16-Sep-18 03:33 PM] jspook16#3059
this is all good info for an infographic

[16-Sep-18 03:33 PM] jspook16#3059
@Audo do you know if an 11x17 inch layout is valid for the infographic contest?

[16-Sep-18 03:38 PM] Ray Uber#2790
What is the additional advantage of using Jumblr over just using z transactions?

[16-Sep-18 03:41 PM] sœÜldat#8733
Jumblr create a private transparent (T) address

[16-Sep-18 03:43 PM] jspook16#3059
jumblr uses time delay as well. i think @jl777c was trying to address the possible trace of transactions based on time and quantity. So jumblr breaks down the balance in the transaction to values of 10, 100, 1000 etc, and those get processed at different time intervals

[16-Sep-18 03:43 PM] jspook16#3059
someone correct me if Im wrong

[16-Sep-18 03:49 PM] Audo#5667
@jspook16 I am not aware of any such constraints. You can double check from @benohanlon though, he's running the contest.

[16-Sep-18 03:52 PM] jspook16#3059
Ok thanks

[16-Sep-18 03:55 PM] jspook16#3059
I was reading some old posts on reddit from 4 years ago related to supernet and jl777. All i have to say is that he has delivered against all of the nay-sayers' comments. Someone even claimed it was virtually impossible.
