[18-Jan-19 02:36 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I didn't understand a part:

[18-Jan-19 02:36 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
is the KMDCC chain a parallel chain on the same KMD cluster using the burn protocol to move coins between the chains?

[18-Jan-19 02:36 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Or it is a pegged sidechain, i.e. the coins are locked on the KMD chain via Gateway CC and 1:1 pegged coins created on the other chain? I read the latter case but I found the terminology confusing.

[18-Jan-19 02:36 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Or has the tech evolved and blurred the distinction between such cases? I try my best to stay updated but really it isn't clear

[18-Jan-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
we are working on an -ac_import functionality that will utilize gateways, but instead of making a token, it uses the crosschain import mechanism to create new coins

[18-Jan-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is a new thing that is a 1:1 sidechain

[18-Jan-19 02:38 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
ah a new thing

[18-Jan-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
and a gateways multisig deposit will be used to create KMDCC automatically

[18-Jan-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
when the KMDCC is withdrawn, it will be burned and the msig KMD withdrawn to KMD

[18-Jan-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
this creates a KMD 1:1 equivalent coin that is CC activated

[18-Jan-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
as soon as KMDCC is finished, which I expect to be late Q1 or Q2, but no promises on dates yet

[18-Jan-19 02:40 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
ok understood

[18-Jan-19 02:40 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it will be useful for marketing to explain the differences and how this evolved 🙂

[18-Jan-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so the KMDCC will be  a native coin on its own chain

[18-Jan-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
CC can be made to work with tokens, but that requires custom work for each CC that wants to support them

[18-Jan-19 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so a need for a pure sidechain existed

[18-Jan-19 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
-ac_import was what I came up with to solve this

[18-Jan-19 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
that way all CC that works on the assetchains coin will work for KMD

[18-Jan-19 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
well KMDCC, which can be 1:1 converted without any counterparty

[18-Jan-19 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
So temporarily, we lose zaddr for KMD equivalent, but the reality was that only 0.1% was in use and this allows the rebrand message to be louder and clearer. no more can people just ignore KMD as being just another zcash fork

[18-Jan-19 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
interesting thing is that KMD mainchain was before zcash mainchain

[18-Jan-19 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
and I think I was the second one to fork the zcash repo, after one of their internal devs

[18-Jan-19 02:48 PM] LocoMB#8593
in any case, there are plenty of privacy options- ARRR, and not to forget JUMBLR...

[18-Jan-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
JUMBLR will migrate to KMDCC
