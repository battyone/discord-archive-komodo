can you operate the Ctrl, C, and V buttons on your keyboard?
If so, then yes

[20-Jun-18 03:37 PM] SHossain#0007

Still in the middle of garden planting and getting all my stuff set back up (I archived and deleted a ton of stuff when I went off the deep end)

[20-Jun-18 03:48 PM] jorian#4555
How did you do that

[20-Jun-18 03:49 PM] jorian#4555
Pulled the plug?

[20-Jun-18 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, that would have been smarter (or at least easier)
I dumped some stuff to a NAS, some to remote, some to server archive and reformatted 3 of my PCs

I think Discord is better. We could not access some of the past information in Slack due to some limitations.

anyone ever happen to get their KMD suprnova login locked out ? gonna switch pools but want to cash out remainder of what I'd mined on Suprnova..

[20-Jun-18 08:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[20-Jun-18 08:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
?

[20-Jun-18 08:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
was gonna set a card or two to continue mining in hopes of hitting my previously set  KMD payout amount but don't wanna waste the time / electricity if it's a fools errand

[20-Jun-18 08:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
No centralized exchange has ever taken crypto from anyone; we freely give it to them in exchange for an implied promise and nothing more

I see it more as a misconfig on their side : some emails are sent (unlocks) and some are not (pw reset).
Had issues a few monthes back and admin just replied to me and did a manual action. I think it may be a spam problem on their side (adding tons of coins wich implies adding potentially a lot of users implies that requests for support grow the same way)...

[20-Jun-18 09:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
every contact with admin address was ok, and I even saw they were at some point aware of mails not sent issue and had a dedicated page for queries about it, it just doesn't work anymore, so best way is just to... wait and resend a : Hello there, could you unlock me every x days

[20-Jun-18 09:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
(not considering it could be fraudulent as I got a few rigs still mining there with working credentials... just one address is stuck on my side)

[20-Jun-18 10:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Dr.Terminus You can try to hit him up on Twitter @ SuprnovaPools or bitcointalk as OcMiner

[20-Jun-18 11:03 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
cool, might do that. thanks for the tip

looking forward to seeing the hyperdex launch

[20-Jun-18 11:12 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
hell yeah. really looking forward to hyperdex too

[20-Jun-18 11:13 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
got barterdex installed but hadnt yet figure how to link it with a couple of wallets i wanted to attempt swapping with

[20-Jun-18 11:35 PM] Tommyboy50#3199
we're all waiting for hyperdex

[20-Jun-18 11:35 PM] Tommyboy50#3199
let's hope it gets the momentum behind it it deserves

[20-Jun-18 11:35 PM] Tommyboy50#3199
every centralised exchange hack is good for this

[20-Jun-18 11:37 PM] Tommyboy50#3199
the timing is perfect for hyperdex launch

[20-Jun-18 11:38 PM] Tommyboy50#3199
today the south korean ministry of science and technology launched an investigation into the Bithumb exchange yesterday

[20-Jun-18 11:38 PM] Tommyboy50#3199
Korean Internet and Security Agency joined in

[20-Jun-18 11:39 PM] Tommyboy50#3199
they found some very worrying facts, they checked the 21 largest exchanges and found they had massive security vulnerabilities

[20-Jun-18 11:39 PM] Tommyboy50#3199
they found 12 with a total absence of security systems

[21-Jun-18 12:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
risk management versus potential profit : if refunding 30M isn't a problem, the profit is huge. Not saying security is not needed, but as it could end up as a substantial percentage of revenue, and imply some sort of  closing activities due to maintenance, one way is just to wait until it costs more to refund than to defend...

[21-Jun-18 12:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
as long as their external view is not risked... and they're not forced legally... that could even lead ... to more trust : "Hey look, they were hacked 30M, but noone lost anything, they did a refund ! you can trust that exchange, even if it is hacked !" -_-

[21-Jun-18 12:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
at the end people may just believe they are absolutely safe using CEX, until... they eventually start not to be able to refund and just decide to remain silent.

@Socal_crypto They have the volume and that's what coins want. But total population liquidity happens when every wallet can trade with every other wallet, on any chain, no middlemen. #atomicswap powered DEXs exist like @HyperDEXApp built on @KomodoPlatform but hardest part...

hey guys is there a komodo testnet ?

[21-Jun-18 03:55 AM] Alright#0419
No

[21-Jun-18 03:56 AM] Alright#0419
You can create a test asset chain though. Depends on what you need to test

[21-Jun-18 04:03 AM] cyrotiv#7483
thx @Alright

[21-Jun-18 04:03 AM] cyrotiv#7483

How do you become a Notary Node? - Komodo
If you are interested in running one of the notary nodes then you need to start ‚Äúcampaigning‚Äù to get the votes of the investors. I am not talking about the normal politics campaign, but this is about running the backbone of dPoW. So what will matter is your experience in ...

[21-Jun-18 04:04 AM] Alright#0419
There was a testnet for notary nodes prior to the election

[21-Jun-18 04:04 AM] Alright#0419
not an actual testnet network however

[21-Jun-18 04:06 AM] Alright#0419
That could also be referring to the actual KMD testnet before launch. Which just turned into the mainnet

[21-Jun-18 04:51 AM] THEblackPANDA#9696
Anyone have trouble with connecting to the SPV server?

[21-Jun-18 07:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Alright saw some talking about the notarization testnet a while back in notary node channel on slack... some notaries wanted to set it up again for some testing, not sure if they actually did end up doing it

[21-Jun-18 07:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Was maybe a couple weeks ago

[21-Jun-18 07:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway, I guess you could consider PIZZA/BEER as the testnets?

[21-Jun-18 07:32 AM] Alright#0419
SHossain has sort of a testnet up right now. He's notarizing TXSCL chains to KMD for MoMoM testing

[21-Jun-18 07:32 AM] Alright#0419
not a KMD testnet, rather a notary testnet
