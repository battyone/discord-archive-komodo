the  lossses are across all of crypto

[14-Aug-18 02:13 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I'm sorry for those who bought KMD for 10$ while there was BTC dump afterwards. But I'm even more sorry I didn't sell my stash at 10$ and rebuy now üòõ

[14-Aug-18 02:15 PM] harry.staal#3321
Sold Komodo at $13 in december

[14-Aug-18 02:15 PM] harry.staal#3321
What will be komodo's revenue model?

[14-Aug-18 02:16 PM] harry.staal#3321
the dico thing was a disaster so was the presentation with the big announcement in September of 2017

[14-Aug-18 02:17 PM] harry.staal#3321
most cryptos are still overpriced atm

[14-Aug-18 02:21 PM] harry.staal#3321
@jl777c answer me bro

[14-Aug-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is an open source crypto, it is not a corporation

[14-Aug-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
blockfolio.com shows KMD usage and usage is what we are working on

[14-Aug-18 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
not blockfolio, the other one: blocktivity

[14-Aug-18 02:24 PM] harry.staal#3321
@jl777c  waves is going to build a closed system called vostok to attract real business

[14-Aug-18 02:25 PM] harry.staal#3321
business isn't interested in open source infrastructures

[14-Aug-18 02:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Soon smart contract integration on kmd

[14-Aug-18 02:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Usage drives price

[14-Aug-18 02:25 PM] harry.staal#3321
waves already has smart contracts

[14-Aug-18 02:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or why else would ETH have its value?

[14-Aug-18 02:25 PM] harry.staal#3321
usage will not drive the price

[14-Aug-18 02:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Explain why ETH has any value then?

[14-Aug-18 02:26 PM] harry.staal#3321
speculation

[14-Aug-18 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC has no revenue model

[14-Aug-18 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
usage and network effect creates value

[14-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Acura#2748
@harry.staal proof / Source for smart Contracts on Waves for Public?

[14-Aug-18 02:27 PM] harry.staal#3321
yes

[14-Aug-18 02:27 PM] harry.staal#3321
atomic swap will follow soon

[14-Aug-18 02:27 PM] harry.staal#3321
BarterDex is not user friendly

[14-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Acura#2748
Can you answer my question?

[14-Aug-18 02:28 PM] harry.staal#3321
Komodo will never be  worth a billion usd

[14-Aug-18 02:28 PM] Acura#2748
AtomicSwaps are delayed on the Waves Roadmap from Q2 to Q4

[14-Aug-18 02:28 PM] harry.staal#3321
Waves is moving to vostok

[14-Aug-18 02:29 PM] Acura#2748
@harry.staal  Can you give me the Proof / Source for smart Contracts on Waves for Public?

[14-Aug-18 02:29 PM] harry.staal#3321
go to waves discord

[14-Aug-18 02:29 PM] Acura#2748
lol

[14-Aug-18 02:29 PM] harry.staal#3321
and ask them

[14-Aug-18 02:29 PM] harry.staal#3321
komodo failed hard with the dico delay

[14-Aug-18 02:29 PM] Acura#2748
Ok - thanks - no proof

[14-Aug-18 02:29 PM] snowdamn#2414
is harry the new class clown?

[14-Aug-18 02:29 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I find it kind of rude you just come and ping james to answer your questions without doing some research or asking anyone else

[14-Aug-18 02:30 PM] xRobeSx#5136
and then shill waves..

[14-Aug-18 02:30 PM] harry.staal#3321
i'm not shilling Sasha fucked over the waves investors just like he did with coinomat nxt

[14-Aug-18 02:30 PM] harry.staal#3321
waves is no moving from open source to closed system

[14-Aug-18 02:30 PM] Deltazulu#2710
does he wants to buy komodo cheaper than now, or why is he here if komodo is a failed project?

[14-Aug-18 02:31 PM] harry.staal#3321
i sold my kmd's in December

[14-Aug-18 02:31 PM] harry.staal#3321
after they kept delaying the dico

[14-Aug-18 02:32 PM] snowdamn#2414
harry:  "Komodo will never be worth a billion usd" - lol been there done that

[14-Aug-18 02:32 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
He claims to have sold at 13 dollars which is when komodo was over a billion usd.

[14-Aug-18 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
dICO is just one use case for atomic swaps, which is just one part of the overall KMD tech

[14-Aug-18 02:32 PM] xRobeSx#5136
imo dico's in general and the delays were more the fault of the projects running them. not KMD. the tech is there. Utrum's dICO went pretty well

[14-Aug-18 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
even if it failed (not saying that they did) it is not a big issue for KMD

[14-Aug-18 02:33 PM] snowdamn#2414
yeah sure harry sold at ATH, not a satoshi less üòÄ

[14-Aug-18 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
many people even complain KMD doesnt get anything directly from barterDEX, so if KMD doesnt get anything directly from barterDEX (dICO) then how could anything with dICO affect KMD in any significant way?

[14-Aug-18 02:34 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Strange how over half the people in crypto claim to sell at the ATH and rebuy at the lowest possible before it rebounds.

@harry.staal There's no any certain date concerning Smart Contracts on Mainnet.  Smart contracts will reach mainnet when all important tests and works will be successfully finished on testnet. So for clariy, there are actual NO Smart Contracts ON Waves for the Public.

Smart contracts on waves since june

[14-Aug-18 02:35 PM] samurai6#5507
Final stages of testing

[14-Aug-18 02:35 PM] harry.staal#3321
@Kitchen Table  don't think alts rebounds this time

[14-Aug-18 02:35 PM] harry.staal#3321
@samurai6  you will join vostok ico?

[14-Aug-18 02:35 PM] samurai6#5507
Mobile app ledger and atomic swap are coming in next month -/+

[14-Aug-18 02:36 PM] samurai6#5507
But komodo and followed their roadmap nicely

[14-Aug-18 02:36 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I will agree that most alts wont, but to claim all wont is disingenuous.

[14-Aug-18 02:36 PM] samurai6#5507
Id hedge your waves bag with komodo 50/50 harry

[14-Aug-18 02:37 PM] harry.staal#3321
Waves and Komodo were my 2 favorites during 2017

[14-Aug-18 02:38 PM] harry.staal#3321
Most waves investors were also huge  kmd supporters

[14-Aug-18 02:38 PM] samurai6#5507
Taking my air drop for vostok

[14-Aug-18 02:38 PM] samurai6#5507
But this is komodo discord

@Kitchen Table when harry drops his mega-BTC stash alts dead üòÉ

[14-Aug-18 02:39 PM] CHMEX#0686
I thnk SN still has 700k waves

[14-Aug-18 02:39 PM] harry.staal#3321
I will buy vaporware

[14-Aug-18 02:39 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I really want to like the Waves but after getting screwed over by Sasha and his coinomat assets, I just can't bring myself to even bother.

[14-Aug-18 02:39 PM] harry.staal#3321
700K Waves strong hands üòÇ

[14-Aug-18 02:39 PM] samurai6#5507
Waves ico was horrible investment

[14-Aug-18 02:39 PM] harry.staal#3321
yes it still is

[14-Aug-18 02:39 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
arent waves aiming at what KMD already got ?

[14-Aug-18 02:40 PM] samurai6#5507
I put a tenth into antshares and stratis

[14-Aug-18 02:40 PM] samurai6#5507
Gave me more

[14-Aug-18 02:40 PM] harry.staal#3321
@Kitchen Table  i'm worried he is doing the same thing again with waves / vostok now

[14-Aug-18 02:40 PM] samurai6#5507
Waves slightly ahead of komodo on most of the major featurez

[14-Aug-18 02:40 PM] harry.staal#3321
lisk, ants, blocknet, metal, monaco and stratis gave me great returns

[14-Aug-18 02:40 PM] samurai6#5507
But i like komodos more open developer oriented comunitty

[14-Aug-18 02:41 PM] harry.staal#3321
stratis still working together with komodo?

[14-Aug-18 02:41 PM] samurai6#5507
And not very far behind. With some features already working that waves is still doing

[14-Aug-18 02:42 PM] harry.staal#3321
trading on Waves DEX can be very profitable even in this bear market

[14-Aug-18 02:42 PM] harry.staal#3321
strange buy and sell orders they still have to adjust bots

[14-Aug-18 02:42 PM] harry.staal#3321
still no use case for mrt and liquid

[14-Aug-18 02:43 PM] samurai6#5507
All pairs leger and smart contract with a mobile wallet makes it complete

[14-Aug-18 02:43 PM] samurai6#5507
The rest is fine tunning

[14-Aug-18 02:44 PM] samurai6#5507
About 2 months for finished product

[14-Aug-18 02:44 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Liquid as in libertynow liquid? I thought he went bust after the "hack" and missing out on the XMR run.

[14-Aug-18 02:45 PM] samurai6#5507
Given no unforseen bugs

[14-Aug-18 02:45 PM] Acura#2748
there is actual no certain date for the Smart Contracts on Waves

[14-Aug-18 02:45 PM] harry.staal#3321
liquid was one of Sasha's shut the fuck up giveaway coin

[14-Aug-18 02:45 PM] samurai6#5507
I think komodo and waves will climb nicely in next bull run

[14-Aug-18 02:45 PM] samurai6#5507
Being two of the known working product platforms

[14-Aug-18 02:46 PM] samurai6#5507
Nope but been going threw extensive heavy testing for 2 months

[14-Aug-18 02:46 PM] samurai6#5507
Reaching the end now. Mainnet and then turring complete versions

[14-Aug-18 02:46 PM] harry.staal#3321
Komodo need to speed things up

[14-Aug-18 02:47 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
That sounds about how Sasha works.

[14-Aug-18 02:47 PM] samurai6#5507
Komodo has the most active github if im not mistaken

[14-Aug-18 02:47 PM] samurai6#5507
Komodo is more of a community coin
