[09-Jun-19 10:37 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
each WIF give you access to a corresponding address

[09-Jun-19 10:37 PM] hastrup#8742
i got all of them on 1 add

[09-Jun-19 10:38 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
you should be able to access asset chain on that address with the corresponding WIF

[09-Jun-19 10:38 PM] hastrup#8742
aaah do i need to import it 4 times becuse i can onbly seed it one dex asset

[09-Jun-19 10:38 PM] hastrup#8742
right now

[09-Jun-19 10:39 PM] hastrup#8742
but will the wif from verus agama work on komodo agama when it safe?

[09-Jun-19 10:40 PM] bushybro#7649
quick question, I've read the different posts in regards to claiming the refund.  My question is, do I need to provide my compromised seed anywhere.  I know initially we were told seeds would not be requested.  I filled out the original claim form but then coin specific ones were provided, I did not fill that one out.  I also sent the fractional KMD from my compromised address.  Will there be anything else required?

[09-Jun-19 10:40 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yes, verus agama and komodo agama is just a wallet, everything is stored in blockchain. So if you have WIF key, you can use it to access the fund on blockchain, using any client/ wallet

[09-Jun-19 10:41 PM] hastrup#8742
@Gordon Komodo thx!

[09-Jun-19 10:41 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
including chameleon, magnum etc

[09-Jun-19 10:41 PM] Teleporter#1797
been holding kmd for 2years+ and all I got as reward was 60 kmd üòÑ

[09-Jun-19 10:41 PM] Teleporter#1797
thanks though

[09-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@Teleporter you would have to claim every month now, the consensus has changed since then üòÑ

[09-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Teleporter#1797
Who knew? I even forgot I had kmd üòÑ

[09-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@bushybro you should not give your seed to anybody. You only need to follow the instruction, including sending the dust kmd from old affected address to the new address.

[09-Jun-19 10:43 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Unless it's your wife wanting to get pregnant of course üòÑ

[09-Jun-19 10:46 PM] hastrup#8742

[09-Jun-19 11:09 PM] hastrup#8742

I do have a small amount of kmd in a different ledger nano device that still has a balance.  Is it possible to have my recovery KMD to be sent there?

[09-Jun-19 11:23 PM] double o#8101
If so, should I fill out another form?

[09-Jun-19 11:26 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes but it will take a bit longer as it will be contested at that point

[09-Jun-19 11:26 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Also did you use your ledger privkey to claim rewards in agama?

[09-Jun-19 11:26 PM] double o#8101
No I didn‚Äôt claim any rewards from my ledger

[09-Jun-19 11:27 PM] double o#8101
I just want this to work,  I can fill out a new form

[09-Jun-19 11:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Ah ok, best to fill in another form with the updated details, i dont know if there is space but you could mention that you are just changing the address but the team will look into that anyway

[09-Jun-19 11:29 PM] double o#8101
Thank you kindly. I really do appreciate your time and effort to help me.  Thank you!

[09-Jun-19 11:55 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[10-Jun-19 12:17 AM] Alexfrog#1338
both my KMD and my MANA did in the same 5 min candle

[10-Jun-19 12:32 AM] suburbancaveman#0303
Okay I believe  my funds were swept up and I am only now catching up to what happened

[10-Jun-19 12:32 AM] suburbancaveman#0303
looks like I can no longer fill out the form to claim

[10-Jun-19 12:32 AM] suburbancaveman#0303
how should I proceed?

[10-Jun-19 12:33 AM] suburbancaveman#0303
I downloaded the versus agama wallet and entered my seed phrase

[10-Jun-19 12:33 AM] suburbancaveman#0303

My Ocean Qt is stuck on "activating best chain" for hours after I encrypted my wallet.  üò¶

[10-Jun-19 03:38 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Any help for that?

[10-Jun-19 03:38 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Ping me, still on Mod duty for Dash Talk.

[10-Jun-19 03:43 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Nevermind, went to roaming and backed up all the folders, will give that a try.

[10-Jun-19 03:59 AM] ecbuddy#8524
question; after this agama fiasco.... I, now that I have KMD back in ocean wallet
wondering, how do I collect interest on this, like I used to on AGAMA?

[10-Jun-19 04:11 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Send your funds to yourself

[10-Jun-19 04:11 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Spends the utxos and claims

[10-Jun-19 04:18 AM] ecbuddy#8524
so basically, just send my whole balance to my own address every once in a while?

[10-Jun-19 04:19 AM] ecbuddy#8524
anyway way to check the amount accrued before doing it?

[10-Jun-19 04:20 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Once a month

[10-Jun-19 04:20 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes you have to do it once each 30 days

[10-Jun-19 04:20 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Or else stops accruing

[10-Jun-19 04:21 AM] CHMEX#0686
dexstats.info/rewards.php
You can check rewards here I believe ocean does not have that feature yet

[10-Jun-19 04:23 AM] ecbuddy#8524
interesting, thank you

[10-Jun-19 04:23 AM] ecbuddy#8524
i didnt know it stops accruing if you dont collect after a month

[10-Jun-19 04:25 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Rewards decentralize coin generation to the hold in a much more equitable way than mining or staking ,  the purpose is to be active user rewards , else a global demurrage effect will occur,  which effectively lowers the bounds of coin supply per given year

[10-Jun-19 04:27 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
TLDR: users have to be active in their coin holdings to take advantage of coin generation profitability

[10-Jun-19 04:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Would be cool to have a way to "claim" the unclaimed rewards for a community pool of funds @polycryptoblog üòÑ

[10-Jun-19 04:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Or just spread to the ones actively claiming rewards

[10-Jun-19 04:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well actually because they are not claiming, it technically increases the value of the ones claiming the reward due to lower emissions

[10-Jun-19 04:40 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes

[10-Jun-19 04:40 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Exactly

[10-Jun-19 04:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
There is a compound effect in reduced emissions

[10-Jun-19 04:42 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Komodo rewards is a game a patience .  13 years could land you substantially ahead in coin holdings relative to peers who did not claim.

[10-Jun-19 04:43 AM] jl777c#5810

[10-Jun-19 06:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if you backed up private keys, you can use them on any other wallet
