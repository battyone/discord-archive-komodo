I just read an article that said, The future of SPV wallets.

[30-Jun-19 02:30 PM] PTYX#6840
So i inferred it from there.

[30-Jun-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
it achieves the benefits of flyclient, but orders of magnitude more simply

[30-Jun-19 02:31 PM] PTYX#6840
ok, understood.

[30-Jun-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
superlight clients

[30-Jun-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
which is indeed the future of SPV, as the block count increases, the amount of headers needed increases

[30-Jun-19 02:45 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
could blockchain network forget old blocks, say keep last 10k block, and in those also store info of old tx , so would not grow for ever ?

[30-Jun-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
coda protocol sort of does that, but there does need to be a history from the genesis block

[30-Jun-19 03:28 PM] SVET5#3137
In simple term, does nSPV works like winrar by compressing the blockchain into smaller chunks?

[30-Jun-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
not at all

[30-Jun-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
it allows proving transactions exist in the blockchain with minimal data

[30-Jun-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
and when the nSPV wallet is done, it is something that can be used by any smartchain

[30-Jun-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
which makes smartchains that much more attractive to have

anyone still stores coins on ledger?

[01-Jul-19 08:11 AM] Oszy#5734
yes

[01-Jul-19 08:15 AM] DugiOtok#1707
because some time ago i read about security issues on it?

[01-Jul-19 08:15 AM] DugiOtok#1707
Did you do any update? Can we claim 5% intrest on it in the meantime or still not?

[01-Jul-19 08:20 AM] Oszy#5734
it's fine for me, using the latest fw

@DugiOtok they did indeed, there are no 5% fee now when you claim. :))

[01-Jul-19 09:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@DugiOtok there was no security issues with the website. I was going to use that claim fee to help fund more development for Komodo but then people were using their ledger privatekeys just to get around the fee. After the Agama issues, i thought it would be best to just let everyone use it for free. Best someone uses it than the development costs go to waste.

If anyone is appreciative of the website, please send tips to the James refund address to help him out.

[01-Jul-19 09:06 AM] DugiOtok#1707
Hi Hyperdex, thanks for the reply. The security issues hat i meant were for the use of NANO ledger in general.

[01-Jul-19 09:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No there were none that i can remember @DugiOtok
