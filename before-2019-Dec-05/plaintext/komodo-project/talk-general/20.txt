Yea, I get tired of people who always try to say mining is wasting electricity...

[01-Jul-18 08:03 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yo genie can you hop in the hangout channel I need to pick your brain

[01-Jul-18 08:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
GPUs use more than 13x the power that the minis take

[01-Jul-18 08:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
per hash

[01-Jul-18 08:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_has no mic or speakers_

[01-Jul-18 08:04 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea my $3k miner was doing 1/5 the hashpower of my z9 mini and consuming 5x the power

[01-Jul-18 08:04 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I literally increased in efficiency by a factor of 25

[01-Jul-18 08:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
23 1080TIs (~266 watts each) put out roughly the same hash as 1 overclocked mini (~ 380 watts)

[01-Jul-18 08:07 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea, I like komodo and the devs, because they put reason before emotional appeals. I feel like the anti-asic sentiment is based solely on selfishness of gpu miners not wanting to progress.

[01-Jul-18 08:07 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Markets change if you don't adapt you will be left behind. i.e. Blockbuster

[01-Jul-18 08:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, the anti-ASIC equihash sentiment is not *entirely* without merit; but the anti-ASIC part of equihash in it's original intention was flawed in concept (the main thought was the it worked because RAM is expensive)

[01-Jul-18 08:12 PM] Extradition90#8046
Very good answer

[01-Jul-18 08:12 PM] Extradition90#8046
I am pro gpu 125gpu

[01-Jul-18 08:12 PM] Extradition90#8046
But want my first asic for komodo

[01-Jul-18 08:12 PM] Extradition90#8046
And jl777 answer is smart

[01-Jul-18 08:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm pro profits and pro chain security; I'm anti-pandering to a minority demographic

[01-Jul-18 08:13 PM] BlackJesus#6161
From all the discussion in mining room there will be alot of asics pointed directly at komodo.

[01-Jul-18 08:13 PM] Extradition90#8046
So i think very good idea to become asic in one moment

[01-Jul-18 08:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"From all the discussion in mining room there will be alot of asics pointed directly at komodo."

theres a couple.

[01-Jul-18 08:14 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'll have my little mini farm as well.

[01-Jul-18 08:14 PM] Extradition90#8046
Yes sure

[01-Jul-18 08:14 PM] Extradition90#8046
Me too alone i am

[01-Jul-18 08:14 PM] Extradition90#8046
I do how i can

[01-Jul-18 08:14 PM] BlackJesus#6161
mining komodo is like a lottery due to orphan interest blocks.

[01-Jul-18 08:14 PM] Extradition90#8046
So lets find z9 mini at good price

[01-Jul-18 08:15 PM] Extradition90#8046
Why like a lottery?

[01-Jul-18 08:15 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I would never play the tradtional lottery. But I will play the komodo lottery

[01-Jul-18 08:15 PM] BlackJesus#6161
You're talking to a lottery winner in @ComputerGenie he hit a what 1500 komodo block of orphan interest

[01-Jul-18 08:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I suspect that @xRobeSx  will eventually use some of the hash to secure asset chains as well (given many of our past convos)

[01-Jul-18 08:15 PM] BlackJesus#6161
when mining on supernova I was a partial recipient of a 2800 komodo block

[01-Jul-18 08:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"You're talking to a lottery winner in ComputerGenie he hit a what 1500 komodo block of orphan interest"
If you saw my investment, $3k isn't winning the lottery üòõ

[01-Jul-18 08:16 PM] BlackJesus#6161
they are lotteries though.

[01-Jul-18 08:16 PM] BlackJesus#6161
2-3 months of revenue in a day.

[01-Jul-18 08:16 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Or is that more akin to a bonus.

[01-Jul-18 08:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

whe're the edited jpegs? looks like a default ubuntu gnome setup with default discord(shield your eyes it's white)

How long are atomic swap orders live for? and what happens when I close BarterDEX after placing an order (fulfilled or not)?

[01-Jul-18 11:40 PM] NNoperator#3835
they time out in four hours

[01-Jul-18 11:45 PM] Regnar#6164
Is it an arbitrary time out?

[01-Jul-18 11:48 PM] cipi#4502
swaps can only be done when BarterDEX is running, if you stop it, no swaps

[01-Jul-18 11:48 PM] Regnar#6164
is there any resources on that aspect in particular I can read up on?

[01-Jul-18 11:49 PM] Regnar#6164
to understand why swaps can't happen when its off (I assume it has something to do with private keys sending the payments etc) but why the 4 hours?

[01-Jul-18 11:50 PM] cipi#4502
swaps can't happen when it's off because BarterDEX can't do transactions when it's off... if you read how atomic swaps work (eg in the whitepaper), it should become clear why it can't work

[01-Jul-18 11:52 PM] cipi#4502
if you place orders in orderbook, eg with autoprice and turn off BarterDEX, this entries will disappear after some time, but it is not that important, since swaps woul not happen anyway, it is just to clear the orderbooks of offers that would not work

[01-Jul-18 11:53 PM] cipi#4502
this should happen much faster then 4 hours, but i don't know what the time is

[01-Jul-18 11:54 PM] Regnar#6164
Sent you a PM @cipi  Thanks for the help

[02-Jul-18 07:32 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@Regnar maybe it's same as p2p file download can't happen when it's off? üòõ My guess - no central DB as decentralized system - so you are part of it /you represent yourself -no central entity DB / must be online to work

[matrix] <soldat:matrix.org> Wow nice article Vasa !

[02-Jul-18 05:56 PM] CHMEX#0686
Curious to hear opinions. The article mentions 'a bit centralized' on eos. Is centralization binary or can it be a partial status?

[02-Jul-18 06:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`a bit` ü§£

[02-Jul-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <polycryptoblog:matrix.org> It's a spectrum ,  but eos is pretty much fully centralized.   Collusion between block producers that banned users without any justification.
