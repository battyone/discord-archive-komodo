np @manouchkov71  your are welcome

[16-Jul-19 01:47 AM] Portman#9202
New website

1. Content is good!

2. The typeface, kerning and 'm' in the new logo are off. 

3. Dropdown menu should happen on mouseover, not by having the user click to access the dropdown menu and then another click to access the submenu item. 

When you click to open the dropdown menu without clicking a submenu option and scroll the page down, that dropdown remains open and blocks content. 
The submenu items do not need a horizontal line spacer, white space is best, people will not get confused if hr is removed. Remove mouseover text underlining as well. This is all just lazy megamenu editing by the devs that should have been changed from the start.   

4. Remove drop shadows on everything. It is 2001 fad, not a clean look.

5. Buttons: Change the button look and animation. The button mouseovers moving the text up and underlining the word and jittering back to default position is bad. Kill all dropshadows, text underlines and button borders.

Keep the buttons simple. On mouseover have the button background color change and that is all. There is a lack on consistency as well with all the buttons - footer, 'view all news' buttons respond differently.

For text links, just change the font color on mouseover, do not underline the text link.

6. The infinite scroll on the news page will not be processed by Googlebots/search crawlers. They cannot not access all individual items in the feed. If crawlers cannot access your content, it is unlikely to surface in search results. SEO will fail there.

7. The Antara animation on the home page is good. Since the rest of the site has fluid edge to edge backgrounds, that section should also have a edge to edge background tying in with the color on the block animation to keep the flow. If at all possible, remove the fade to black transitions and just fade in and out the animations sequences on each other. Also remove the outer dropshadow.


Although the content is organized well, the site itself appears like a plug and play wordpress theme, a megamenu with no tweaking, and general css changes. Designers did not make this site, wordpress hackers did.
