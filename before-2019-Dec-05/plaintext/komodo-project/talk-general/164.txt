@house  I think best would be someone similar to miketout - I've seen the interview with him - very good. Just he seems more interested in development then participating in media for promoting ecosystem

[31-Dec-18 10:29 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
someone like Rick Falkvinge could be good too, I mean someone really skilled in talk and tech understanding same time and liking to explain things to people

[31-Dec-18 10:30 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
someone pationate about tech and education

[31-Dec-18 10:30 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
siddharta's writing is pretty awesome. I vote siddharta 😄

[31-Dec-18 10:31 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it's not about writing - poeple "buy" if they see nice face they like, see most commercials - faces of music and sport stars

[31-Dec-18 10:31 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
in crypto/tech there are also stars or potential stars

[31-Dec-18 10:33 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
the diff is "crypto star" must understand what he is talking about and not doing commercials but lactures and educational presentations on conferences and so on

[31-Dec-18 10:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes I vote for ca333 for that too, if it needs deeper tech talk

[31-Dec-18 10:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
Ok, ok... I’ll do it.

[31-Dec-18 11:03 AM] actionslacks#4072

I can appreciate infinitely the reason that James is not our frontman,

[31-Dec-18 11:24 AM] house#8741
Being the logical choice, but as with satsnaka, it is not the responsible thing to do

[31-Dec-18 11:25 AM] house#8741
I don’t know why I didn’t think earlier but @grewalsatinder is almost certainly top contender as Komodo frontman

[31-Dec-18 11:26 AM] house#8741
He is both subtle and very intelligent

[31-Dec-18 11:27 AM] house#8741
Able to articulate many things technical and with tri-lingual facility if not more

[31-Dec-18 11:28 AM] house#8741
We just need to beat him down a bit more so his head does not inflate too much 😂

[31-Dec-18 11:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄 appreciate your thoughts mate

[31-Dec-18 11:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll try to help. but this time I want to help the technical crowd more.

[31-Dec-18 11:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for that I need to raise my level in blockchain knowledge a bit more.

[31-Dec-18 03:24 PM] SHossain#0007
It is run by our Agama developer. Please read the warnings before starting to use it.

@house @passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 sure, can do an interview if you guys wish - currently pretty loaded with work like mentioned by others... also open doing a talk together with @blackjok3r or @grewalsatinder  if they want. If the community wants maybe a twitch coding session could be interesting as well? not sure - just make a suggestion and we ll try to do it.

2019, Up for the challenge!

For many of us, the New Year is a moment to reflect on the past and prepare for the year ahead.

As I reflect upon 2018, I am filled with gratitude to be a part of this community. I'm particularly thankful for @Ludom , one of our top investors and board members; for @Yassin  and @sφldat , among our very first token holders; and for @metaphilibert and his indispensable guidance. 


We've had the pleasure of finding genuine, warm, giving people in the KOMODO community and we hope that our contribution to the community will also be meaningful as we strive to give back.


Shifting now to thoughts on what lies ahead, I'd like to share a summary of my economic prospective for 2019 (ideas that I plan to develop further on our Discord channel).

[01-Jan-19 09:51 PM] FabØ#8941
2019 & 2020: Years of Opportunity

What I envision happening in 2019 (and something my team members have discussed at length) is a dynamic blend of difficulty and opportunity. First, a global financial crisis hangs on the horizon and may amount to a currency crisis. While this sounds grim, I see it as a chance for our community (and for people in general) to pull together and find better ways to work and interact. 


Looking at what appears to be an impending global financial crisis, the picture does look a bit grim at first. As economic growth slows and profits slump, we may see mounting debt pressure rendering private institutions (especially banks) unable to honor their debts and fulfill their engagements -- likely resulting in default.


In response to defaults, defiant economic actors are likely to significantly raise risk premiums, triggering cost and volume of debts (and proliferating even more defaults). 

In terms of mitigation, governments and leaders are both ill-equipped and stunted by a poor track record. Many have already used and abused the buy-out card, and in many cases they lack the resources, credibility and method to pass it along to taxpayers -- who are still digesting the last bill.

[01-Jan-19 09:52 PM] FabØ#8941
Instead, we will see an increase in protectionist/populist political measures motivated by short term views. The result will trigger the deflagration of traditional monetary spaces.


But here's the silver lining: negative downturns in the global markets may spur a concurrent upswing in the crypto community. Coin prices may surge and relevant crypto asset projects will attract even more people searching for solutions. This could lead to an increase in demand for crypto-related jobs and with it, incentives to contribute and develop the system.


These dynamic shifts can be a positive game changer. It's times like this --when the cards get redistributed--that change be transmuted into opportunity with widespread benefits. 


Based on this forecast and the outcome of many variables, I stake my career and my family's future -- a sentiment that many of us working in the crypto community share. Looking to the future with informed optimism is how we can work to land on the right side of the fence. This is why it is critical that we develop a viable, alternative ecosystem. A major step in that direction is the creation of KSB, a stable coin by design built on a KOMODO asset chain. After numerous exchanges with different protocol leaders, we feel evermore confident about putting our time and effort into to the KOMODO ecosystem, reaching out to new users and developing our services on the Komodo platform.

[01-Jan-19 09:54 PM] FabØ#8941
This is what motives me every day, and I hope to be able to call KOMODO home and to continue collaborating with the people in this community.


I hope to chat and see you around on Discord and elsewhere.

Best wishes to each of you and yours. Let's make this a great year, together. 

Cheers,

Fabien

@FabØ what is ksb backed by?

[01-Jan-19 09:58 PM] FabØ#8941
Minimum 80% usd fiat and up to 20% asset backed loans (125% collateral)

[01-Jan-19 11:48 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Can’t wait to see what oPay will do for Komodo ecosystem!

[02-Jan-19 12:19 AM] mobipoi#5774
@FabØ will there be audit to prove fiat holdings and the asset are they tangible like real estate gold etc not securities like stocks and crypto

[02-Jan-19 12:33 AM] FabØ#8941
Yes we are working on a dashboard that reflect information in real time and the audit will be public starting this month (working on the price tag for this service big name big price) 😃

[02-Jan-19 12:34 AM] FabØ#8941
As for the assets they are clearly intangible  and still clearly very secure

[02-Jan-19 12:34 AM] FabØ#8941
Minimum 80% fiat

[02-Jan-19 12:34 AM] FabØ#8941
Up@to 20% in asset backed loans

[02-Jan-19 12:35 AM] FabØ#8941
Meaning that our loans are secured by contracts, we know the borrowers (individual and corporation)

[02-Jan-19 12:35 AM] FabØ#8941
And can enforced the contract (collaterals)

[02-Jan-19 12:36 AM] FabØ#8941
The mechanism is@also secured by the fact each borrower has to deposit a minimum of 125% in collateral

[02-Jan-19 12:37 AM] FabØ#8941
Which make it secure at 2 levels

Ok as long as things are transparent , it not very hard to forge accounts also will the usd be kept as a treasury bill as bank's could default

[02-Jan-19 01:21 AM] mobipoi#5774
or will these be held in cash?

[02-Jan-19 10:10 AM] FabØ#8941
agreed

[02-Jan-19 10:11 AM] FabØ#8941
the composition at T0 will be 80% cash $, 20% in the form of secured debt in USD

[02-Jan-19 10:12 AM] FabØ#8941
A large % of the cash layer will be turn into T-Bill (USD) the exact % will depend on use, we need to have an empiric and pragmatic approach as the space is still new.

[02-Jan-19 10:13 AM] FabØ#8941
we dont have enough historic on KSB yet and we want be certain than everybody can redeem there KSB

[02-Jan-19 10:15 AM] FabØ#8941
I personally believe on asset backed on a 80% asset backed loan and 20% cash in $ dispatch over the most secure establishments
