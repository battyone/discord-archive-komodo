4 months should put you in safe zone, if you are 100% sure

one year is no problem at all, but you need to switch to a different wallet, like verus wallet, etc

depends, if they were on the same address as kmd that you did move your seed might be compromised

[07-Jun-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
if the KMD was moved, then it is 100% for sure vulnerable

[07-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if on different address/seed your AC's might be fine

[07-Jun-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
even if it wasnt, it could be if you used agama in recent months

[07-Jun-19 12:35 PM] 3rd#6931
i havent touched anything in over a year so

[07-Jun-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810

@Kaed did you send to the claim address? if so, plz the txid in DM

[07-Jun-19 12:39 PM] tafen#3000
If you have the opportunity, could you see if I have any hope of getting a refund from my address. Sorry again for the trouble, but I am very worried. Is it safe to post my old address here?

[07-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Kaed#8040
@jl777c Done ðŸ˜ƒ

[07-Jun-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
@tafen DM me your address

[07-Jun-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
I got a properly done 2), so I can proceed to 3). I hope to be able to get it done by sometime this weekend, but not sure as you all were making a lot of changes to the claims and it will take a full day to sort through all that data

[07-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Dyeles#8347
Hello @jl777c , I've been dealing with this just like everybody else but it has gotten pretty confusing. Funds from 3 of my addresses were moved to your safety one. I filled the original claim where I put the 3 kmd claims into one (Now apparrently has changed) put a paperwallet that in a rush I made, then a message stating that paper might be compromised so I contacted SHossain with a new one from Verus. So now, I haven't get any txd into any of my previous addresses and don't know that to do next. Thank you

[07-Jun-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
for each separate address, you should have a destination address.

[07-Jun-19 12:44 PM] istante#3749
This step special tx is for wallets less the 7777 kmd right?

[07-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Dyeles#8347
yes, the paperwallet one

[07-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Dyeles#8347
is that the one I have to check?

[07-Jun-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
i and currently sending the special tx to all addresses, about halfway done now

[07-Jun-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
after all the of the special tx are sent, you check the compromised address and send 0.0001 (or more) from there to your claim address

[07-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Dyeles#8347
Can I DM my compromisd addresses?

[07-Jun-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
the destination must match your claim address in the claim form, if not, it goes into disputed category for manual reconciliation

[07-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Recieved small amount transaction. I see the three outputs in explorer. I don't recognize the other two addresses, is that normal?

[07-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
one output is compromised address, then two others that I don't have the keys for.

[07-Jun-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
thats ok, those are so you can tell when the refund is done

[07-Jun-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
when the second one goes from (U) to (S) that means the refund has been sent

[07-Jun-19 12:49 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
ok great!

[07-Jun-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the amount is 0.0002 + refund amount

[07-Jun-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you are getting a refund of 1234 KMD, you would have gotten a special tx of 0.00021234

[07-Jun-19 12:50 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
perfect.

[07-Jun-19 12:50 PM] Dyeles#8347
Can I send my 3 compromised addresses to you via DM @jl777c ?

[07-Jun-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
why?

[07-Jun-19 12:51 PM] Dyeles#8347
to check if you already sent the txd to those

[07-Jun-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i am sending to ALL compromised addresses

[07-Jun-19 12:51 PM] Dyeles#8347
I can't see any txd at all

[07-Jun-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
when I am done sending, if you got it, you got it. if not, then it wasnt in the list of compromised

[07-Jun-19 12:52 PM] gcharang#6833
@Dyeles if you have sent your safe new address to shossain, then you are fine

[07-Jun-19 12:53 PM] Dyeles#8347
What? I've been sending all the info to SHossain and he has been guiding me the whole time, plus the funds dissappeared and went to your address

[07-Jun-19 12:53 PM] gcharang#6833
@Dyeles when you do the txn in second step make sure you send to the address you told shossain

[07-Jun-19 12:53 PM] Dyeles#8347
I originaly put a paper wallet in my claim, then I read that paperwallet could be compromised and yesterday I gave him a new one from VErus, but I'm not receiving JL txd @gcharang

[07-Jun-19 12:54 PM] bitcoinstrader#6920

@Dyeles  those who gave more than one application will be considered later.

[07-Jun-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the simplest is one claim for one address

[07-Jun-19 12:56 PM] Dyeles#8347
I only made one, the original one where I had to put my 3 kmd Addresses

[07-Jun-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be ok

[07-Jun-19 12:57 PM] Dyeles#8347
3 addresses, amount on each, txd and destination one

[07-Jun-19 12:57 PM] Dyeles#8347
add more than 15k in total

[07-Jun-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
i am sending to each of your three addresses

[07-Jun-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810

this weekend i will automate detection of the special tx 2)

[07-Jun-19 12:59 PM] lion#5837
and the fraudster will no longer be able to collect these small transactions under the guise of users who have not yet checked and do not know that their wallets are compromised? Not all users who invest in pre-trial checked their funds? Hacker is no longer a threat?

[07-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Can we check the special txid in the Agama Verus with the old seed?

[07-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Buddz1993#5380
and access the old compromised wallet

[07-Jun-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[07-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Buddz1993#5380
right

[07-Jun-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810

[07-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Dyeles#8347
@jl777c I'm trying not to stress to much, so far I have been in good contact with Shossain, but I just checked and I haven't received anything, but I'm trying to not panic, plus Spanish is my first language and I'm trying to express myself so I don't sound rude

[07-Jun-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
1100

[07-Jun-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
60% complete for phase 1)

[07-Jun-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
you can keep asking, but until 100% are sent, not all are sent

[07-Jun-19 01:02 PM] bitcoinstrader#6920
Anything to be done after receiving the small transaction????
