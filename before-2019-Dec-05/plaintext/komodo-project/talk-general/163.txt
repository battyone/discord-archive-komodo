reward accruing stops after 1 month.

[27-Dec-18 01:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
just make a send transaction on self address, get reward and the time starts again from that date.

is there a bootstrap that anyone knows of besides 0x03's? (and yes I'm aware of the hypocrisy in my asking)

[27-Dec-18 01:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I thought @CHMEX also had such options on his website 🤔

I only have a rewards viewer: dexstats.info/rewards.php
I can try to host booststraps if i don't need to stop the daemon I could host it for all Assetchains. I will give it a try.

there is now a Notarization verificator on the page:

it tells you if a trxid is notarized or not yet

Can the team confirm me this information ?

What is the relation with KMD and Amazon

[28-Dec-18 04:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We have an advanced teir partnership and access to vast resources of their Data Centres. It was secured for the 1 millkion tps test, which has been ready for months. Not sure what the go is now. Everything should be ready to run it, might take a few days/weeks to get it all ready again lol. I forgot how most of it works.

Hello merry Christmas everyone .how can i claim my komodo 5% every month?

[28-Dec-18 07:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It's 5% yearly , you just have to send your balance to yourself

[28-Dec-18 07:38 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
After one year?

[28-Dec-18 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181

@SHossain i see coinpayments has now enabled KMD support again, thanks for that, but the merchant I'm paying at doesn't want to support KMD because coinpayments doesn't allow direct conversion of KMD to BTC

[28-Dec-18 11:09 AM] SHossain#0007
I'll check

@blackjok3r is anyone coordinating the scaling test effort? I’m a bit confused about the state of this. It was all the rage then just fell off the map. You seemed to be a very key dev in executing this test, is this just a casualty of decentralization? 😃

ledger's response:

[29-Dec-18 12:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
They did find some very interesting bugs. Also, they all require physical access. IF you think your HW is actually brand new and nobody else has touched it, you are safe. But it points out that it is easier to give somebody a HW wallet that is backdoored

indeed, dukeleto

[29-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Torankoku#4818
start taking extra measures even if it is new though

[29-Dec-18 12:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
never ever ever buy a used HW wallet, based on this data. And even then, be very very paranoid

[29-Dec-18 12:33 AM] Torankoku#4818
yes, exactly

[29-Dec-18 12:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
opendime wallets don't have these issues, I believe. For instance, they use a clear case so you can see if any internal components are different

[29-Dec-18 12:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
but opendime are meant to be single-use, so they are not exactly the same

[29-Dec-18 12:33 AM] Torankoku#4818
personally, i never used hardware wallets

[29-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Torankoku#4818
just brought one recently when it was on sale

[29-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Torankoku#4818
still have not used it to this day

[29-Dec-18 12:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@tolken not sure the go man. Was waiting on marketing then MoMoM was broken so we went off to fix that and it took 8 months... Is fixed now though. So test can be run

[29-Dec-18 01:07 AM] tolken#2655
@blackjok3r that’s odd. Well hopefully we can see this baby fired up son the not too distant future, before you completely forget how it all works anyway 😛

[29-Dec-18 01:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol we already forgot how it works

[29-Dec-18 01:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can make it again tho

[29-Dec-18 01:08 AM] tolken#2655
I think it’s good to always have skepticism about the security of anything. It becomes a management inconvenience, but like everything, usually best not keep all eggs in one basket.

[29-Dec-18 01:10 AM] tolken#2655
@blackjok3r I thought you had it down to a single command to launch that shit 😛

[29-Dec-18 01:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We will be doing a cross chain stress test in #kmdlabs  in the next few weeks, hope to fill blocks with cross chain txs... After that the actual scale test should probably be run, even if just 250k txs a second.

[29-Dec-18 01:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes close to that

[29-Dec-18 01:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Bit more than 1, its just a docker conatainer that polls a URL for the start time

@Deleted User I don't think you can recover your pin. If you have your dat files, most likely you'll need to dump privkeys, then import them into a new encrypted wallet.

[29-Dec-18 06:35 PM] PTYX#6840

[29-Dec-18 06:44 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
BTC got Antonopoulos, ETH got Vitalic, BCH got Roger and Rick... can KMD get someone like that? Maybe Miketout ? Somehow people like faces and emoitions beside intelligence, competence and knowledge
