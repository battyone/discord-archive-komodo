why not?

[18-Feb-19 01:29 PM] sikkan#6377
hey guys.. looong time I was involved in KMD.. just hodling my bag üòÉ is it still mineable? and is it on the original equihash algo still?

[18-Feb-19 01:31 PM] bishop#9773
@sikkan yes and yes

[18-Feb-19 01:31 PM] sikkan#6377
roger that.. no GPU love then üòâ

[18-Feb-19 01:48 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Not quite, unless you have free electricity!

[18-Feb-19 01:49 PM] sikkan#6377
lol.. no I dont üòõ

[18-Feb-19 01:49 PM] sikkan#6377
and even if I did I dont think I would GPU mine an asic coin:P

[18-Feb-19 03:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
@sikkan you mine KMD with Z9/A9 asics. Much better for the environment, because one of these asics replaces dozens of GPU cards yet costs a fraction of the price of the GPUs üëº

[18-Feb-19 03:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD is mineable with exactly the same hardware as ZEC, ZEN, HUSH and whichever other coins still use equihash (200,9) params

[18-Feb-19 03:40 PM] sikkan#6377
@dukeleto I hear you üòÉ and I dont agree on that environment thing.. sure, its more efficient than a GPU, but if asics werent manufactured we would "only" have GPUs running the network. What happens now is that ASICs take over the network and GPUs move to another algo üòâ

[18-Feb-19 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
If you didn't switch your GPUs away from equihash like 8 months ago, you're already way behind the curve

[18-Feb-19 03:47 PM] sikkan#6377
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ I cant imagine anyone mining with a GPU on a coin that have asics.. unless its ethereum

[18-Feb-19 03:48 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_can't imagine mining ethereum_

[18-Feb-19 03:49 PM] sikkan#6377
nah, I tend to mine equihash-based coins üòÉ 144_5 and/or 150_5 type üòÑ

Dash 51% attack resistant now?

[18-Feb-19 06:48 PM] SHossain#0007
if you mean dPoW, DASH doesn't have it. GIN, a fork of DASH was added to our dPoW network

[18-Feb-19 08:51 PM] Tek#5253
heh. Dash is gonna get mass adoption.

[18-Feb-19 08:51 PM] Tek#5253
nah, being bitcoins bitch isn't what Dash needs.

[18-Feb-19 08:52 PM] Tek#5253
lmao you don't know anything about Dash.

[18-Feb-19 08:52 PM] Tek#5253
lDash is on a KMD level if you look at innovation and whats being delivered

[18-Feb-19 08:53 PM] Tek#5253
and the masternode network supports instant transactions

[18-Feb-19 08:53 PM] Tek#5253
where did you see it before then

[18-Feb-19 08:54 PM] Tek#5253
don't know any other reputable chains that have anything that dash is getting

[18-Feb-19 08:54 PM] Tek#5253
DPow isn't Chainlocks, if bitcoin fails KMD is ded

[18-Feb-19 08:55 PM] Tek#5253
Well obviously, but KMD will always be someones bitch.

[18-Feb-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
I like both KMD and Dash for different reasons

[18-Feb-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
no wait

[18-Feb-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
its the same reasons

[18-Feb-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
I just don't like buttcoin

[18-Feb-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
Dash is much better

[18-Feb-19 08:57 PM] Tek#5253
That's true. but the masternode system really sets Dash out to be a global payment network, with no delays

[18-Feb-19 08:57 PM] Tek#5253
the maternodes govern the chain

[18-Feb-19 08:57 PM] Tek#5253
and it's self funding so you don't have that blockstream devs fucking up btc for money

[18-Feb-19 08:58 PM] Tek#5253
I just like dash

[18-Feb-19 08:58 PM] Tek#5253
reeeeeeeeeeeeee

[18-Feb-19 08:58 PM] Tek#5253
yes you can

[18-Feb-19 08:58 PM] Tek#5253
anyone can run a masternode

[18-Feb-19 08:58 PM] Tek#5253
1000 dash

[18-Feb-19 08:58 PM] Tek#5253
it used to be anyone.

[18-Feb-19 08:58 PM] Tek#5253
now you need some actual value, which isn't a bad thing

[18-Feb-19 08:59 PM] Tek#5253
Decred for example lets anyone vote. the masses can decide what happens

[18-Feb-19 08:59 PM] Tek#5253
thats bad

[18-Feb-19 08:59 PM] Tek#5253
with Dash only the masternodes vote

[18-Feb-19 08:59 PM] Tek#5253
decentralized is a meme

[18-Feb-19 09:00 PM] Tek#5253
if you have skin in the game you can get a dash masternode, plebs don't need to be node runners

KMD is great its my second biggest hold

[18-Feb-19 09:02 PM] Tek#5253
most my money is in Dash üòÑ

[18-Feb-19 09:02 PM] Tek#5253
there is none

[18-Feb-19 09:02 PM] Tek#5253
Dash never had any problems, best payment network to date that has reputation.

[18-Feb-19 09:04 PM] Tek#5253
its first seen where the tech doesn't involve being an other chains bitch

[18-Feb-19 09:04 PM] Tek#5253
üòõ

[18-Feb-19 09:04 PM] Tek#5253
then what

[18-Feb-19 09:04 PM] Tek#5253
what other 51% tech besides dpow is out there ? TELL ME NOW

[18-Feb-19 09:05 PM] Tek#5253
is it BCH avalanche?

[18-Feb-19 09:05 PM] Tek#5253
its not the same

[18-Feb-19 09:05 PM] Tek#5253

Several projects have implemented their own 51% attack protection.  Pirl and Loki come to mind.  The main difference is ours is extendable to 3rd party chain and is a piece of the puzzle to crosschain communication and interoperability,  Other projects competing with Komodo with its extendability to 3rd party chains are far behind, namely due to bad engineering.  Veriblock‚Äôs Proof of Proof is an order of magnitude more expensive and Blockstack requires coin burn. Komodos DPoW costs regenerate at least in part.

[19-Feb-19 12:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Those extendable competitors also don‚Äôt have cross chain communication component as part of their offering

@Tek really confused how you see KMD as "bitcoin's bitch". KMD simply takes advantage of bitcoin's hashrate

[19-Feb-19 03:23 AM] BlackJesus#6161
If anything Komodo is making BTC the bitch. Komodo gives their network activity which grows their network effect whilst Komodo inherits their massive hashpower security.

Is there a certain spam protection with the Blockchain Starter Kit?

So you don't spam thousands of chains?

[19-Feb-19 10:46 AM] jorian#4555
the amount of chains possible within KMD platform is so huge it's not worth the time. even if you have a chain with name CHAIN, you can create a different blockchain by specifying a different  `-ac_reward` for example. also, the name of the `ac_name` parameter has a pretty high char limit

[19-Feb-19 10:47 AM] jorian#4555
as for hosting stuff, yes, i guess some limits need to be in place

Really good point @Acura

[19-Feb-19 01:02 PM] PTYX#6840
I assume that to generate a blockchain using the blockchain kit there will be a cost

[19-Feb-19 01:02 PM] PTYX#6840
The cost can serve as a spam filter if it's high enough

[19-Feb-19 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
One man's "spam" is another man's "worthwhile venture"

[19-Feb-19 01:15 PM] Acura#2748
Problem on Waves Dex is that the Fee for Asset Creation is too low - many spam assets are created,  flowing & spaming.

[19-Feb-19 01:15 PM] Acura#2748
Hopefully we can make this better.
