Anyone have link to what Chinese Gov said about kmd?

[16-Nov-19 11:51 AM] Acura#2748
@steinsg8 The official Komodo website received a Chinese translation.

https://twitter.com/KomodoPlatform/status/1195280144086306816?s=19

Perhaps this is due to information from Chinese news sources.

Why do these links say komodo is private? It's not anon anymore, right?

[16-Nov-19 12:01 PM] gcharang#6833
KMD itself doesn't have privacy features right now, but it provides the Smart Chain technology that can create new private blockchains

is there a way to forbid bots that initiate talks? I see this as distinguish feature that could allow to stop fake bots

[16-Nov-19 01:56 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
our bots are usually tools that are evoked by user

[16-Nov-19 01:57 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
fake bots opposite - they evoke a user

@gcharang is there plans to have a more UX friendly solution like MetaMask then for Komodo?

[16-Nov-19 10:37 PM] mrdotboson#5783
Also can you send me a link to this current solution

[17-Nov-19 05:17 AM] gcharang#6833
@mrdotboson 
repo: <https://github.com/jl777/libnspv>
guide: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/nspv.html>
to access the browser version, launch the executable and  visit  http://127.0.0.1:<port>/ in the browser
replace port with the rpcport value in the coins file in the repo, for kmd, the value is `7771`
to launch a coin other than KMD, open the coin's file to verify it is present. then, `./nspv COINNAME`

a completely browser solution is possible and we are looking to port the nspv tech to wasm for inclusion in a webpage or extension

looking for komodo fans to join us this friday near Den Hage we are discussing the futher of food and are planning on using komodo for carbon neutral farming! if you want to attend please let me or @barv know, we can help with tickets!!! also first track is very interesting with digital identity on the agenda

[18-Nov-19 11:56 AM] ascii4rt#4513
Hello

[18-Nov-19 12:04 PM] cascrypto#8206
Together with the Ministry of LNV, NAJK, CTA, Ahold Delhaize, Danone, IBM, Google, Deloitte, Rabobank and another 10 of these partners, we take a look at how new technologies such as blockchain and A.I. strengthen farmers' income. We know that the bottleneck is not in technology itself, but more in issues such as the disadvantages of transparency and lack of long-term cooperation. How do we organize the food system in such a way that farmers can invest in the food of tomorrow?

During this event we will look with all players at the (im) possibilities of technology for:
- A unique farmers digital identity where the farmer has control over his/her own data
- New business models where, for example, employees, neighbors and consumers can participate in the company
- CO2 neutral business operations. How do we make a tradable CO2 certificate that financially rewards sustainable business?

During Strike Two you are actively introduced to technology. Together with the partners in these 3 tracks you will test the possibilities, accelerators and threats for farmers' income. As a concrete outcome of Strike Two, an innovation roadmap is made per track.

lol we are aproaching mainstream corprates! but with @barv in tha house, they will be mentioned in discussions on farmer identity I guess ;0)

[18-Nov-19 12:48 PM] alperC#7758
@Mantrack why should ARRR be mentioned in the Features section? ARRR is not a feature of Komodo it has its own Smart Chain, it is an independent project.

Or did you maybe mean why it's not mentioned as an example?

[18-Nov-19 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
aka "Because PIRATE is not a sidechain"

[18-Nov-19 12:51 PM] crumb#2550
runtime KMD fork with forced anonymity would be a better desctiption?

[18-Nov-19 12:51 PM] crumb#2550
for explaining ARRR tech wise?

[18-Nov-19 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It is a runtime Komodo fork, not a KMD fork 😉

[18-Nov-19 12:52 PM] crumb#2550
yeh, silly crumb

[18-Nov-19 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the difference being the platform and not the coin/chain (they only share the same genesis)

[18-Nov-19 12:53 PM] crumb#2550
used symbol for brevity, but ultimately incorrectly as it seems 😛

[18-Nov-19 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in context, it could be correct, but we live in a world where things get copied out of context and people later get the wrong idea of what was meant/said

[18-Nov-19 02:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
`you can't tax forest fires or volcanos or any other natural cycle` of course you can.. there are countries where you pay a "rain water tax" on your water bill

yes Joe, come and discus it! their are farmers and proffessors in agri in the room ! co2 is being sold from rotterdam harbour to the westland to feed the plants! I m just in sales so please join mr smart ass ;0)

[18-Nov-19 05:12 PM] Mantrack#6402
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 what exactly is the difference between a sidechain and "smart chain"?

[18-Nov-19 05:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in short: the latter is wholly independent and sidechains are "pegged" to a "master"/"parent" chain

[18-Nov-19 05:19 PM] Mantrack#6402
aahhh now that explains everything

[18-Nov-19 05:19 PM] Mantrack#6402
thanks rainbow_unicorn

[18-Nov-19 05:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if it helps any more than that, blockstream's definition is:
`A sidechain is a blockchain that validates data from other blockchains.`
