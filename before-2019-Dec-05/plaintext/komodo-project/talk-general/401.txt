[24-Jul-19 06:20 AM] jl777c#5810
@Exile13 nSPV is automatically in all komodo chains. currently it is in the FSM branch, as it gets validated it will migrate to dev, beta and master

hi, I made an asset chain DICT for test. When I run an equihash mining pool to mine the DICT coin, the daemon always refuse the block submitted by the pool. In the DICT's debug.log,  has some ERRORs like this: '''ProcessNewBlock: CheckBlock FAILED‚Äô‚Äò‚Äô. How should I do?

[24-Jul-19 09:16 AM] gcharang#6833
@ERIC which pool software are you using?

Hi when I have 1000 Komodo after 1 month I can claim 50 kmd ??

[24-Jul-19 01:08 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Or 50/12 months

[24-Jul-19 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
you'd have the 50 more in total at the end of 1 year while claiming once per month
you can't don't get that at one time for 1000

Hi@all. I'm new to Komodo and just configured agama wallet. For claim kmd I have to download all blockchain or lite versions enough? I have now lite version but I don't see claim button,  maybe I have to transfer some kmd coins first?

[25-Jul-19 09:02 AM] taihip#1310
hi, lite version is ok. you need at least 10 kmd in your wallet before able to claim reward

[25-Jul-19 09:05 AM] deviant#4739
Thanks, but for now better to claim on binance or?

[25-Jul-19 09:06 AM] taihip#1310
yes, for now binance is better until 1 Sep

[25-Jul-19 09:07 AM] deviant#4739
1 Sep is snapshot? After that send coins to agama right?

[25-Jul-19 09:08 AM] deviant#4739
My English is very bad, sorry

[25-Jul-19 09:08 AM] taihip#1310
after 1 sep, I don't know. I personally will keep it in banance

[25-Jul-19 09:08 AM] deviant#4739
Ok

[25-Jul-19 09:10 AM] crumb#2550
not your keys, not your coins

[25-Jul-19 09:11 AM] crumb#2550
always keep that in mind

[25-Jul-19 09:11 AM] hastrup#8742
@deviant if you comfortable not owning your coins binance is a great choice

[25-Jul-19 09:11 AM] deviant#4739
Yes I know, it is only because of giveaway, but you all know

[25-Jul-19 09:13 AM] hastrup#8742
Is it worth it? Have you calculated what you are getting? If it's cents why do it?

[25-Jul-19 09:13 AM] deviant#4739
No not calculated

[25-Jul-19 09:19 AM] jansako#3330
If you just have a few KMD, you are getting very little extra. If you have a lot, the risk is not worth it (but that is just me)...

[25-Jul-19 09:19 AM] hastrup#8742
Then try to calculate it. I'm almost sure you are not getting more then a dollar and is your coin safety worth that?

[25-Jul-19 09:20 AM] hastrup#8742
@jansako well said!

[25-Jul-19 09:29 AM] deviant#4739
you're right, last question,  after I send coins to agama I have to do something?

[25-Jul-19 09:36 AM] taihip#1310
you only have to wait , max 1 month before claim
