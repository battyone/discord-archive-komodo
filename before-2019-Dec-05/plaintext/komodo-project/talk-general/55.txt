Hello, everyone. As I've read, "The 5% reward starts accumulating after a few minutes if you hold over 10 KMD in your wallet. " So, if I've over 10 KMD in my mobile wallet, that's all I have to do?

[03-Sep-18 10:57 AM] adriendarki#8952
hello all

üëã 

[03-Sep-18 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
@Tanya Lya Yes. Send over 10 KMD and wait for an hour (60 blocks). Make sure your tx displays locktime in explorer

[03-Sep-18 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
Hello @adriendarki

[03-Sep-18 11:05 AM] Tanya Lya#2332
Ok, I found more info in Komodo's FAQ: "As users know, the more transactions there are on a blockchain the more difficult it is to conduct timing analysis. Over the past year, we have measured the need for even more active movement in order to better support the KMD privacy mechanism. To implement this, the annual time limit on the growing of 5% will be changed to monthly cap of 5%/12. What this means is that you will need to actively use all your funds every month to maximize your rewards for contributing to the activity of the KMD ecosystem. The good news is that compounding will get you rewards of 5.1% over a year. For users that do it just 4 times, it will end up a bit less than 2%. Your contribution to the privacy ecosystem will be more closely linked to your reward.
KMD holders actively earn a 5.1% compound KMD reward annually by holding more than 10 KMD and collecting the 5%/12 reward once every month."  - so does this all mean that I should perform an operation with my KMD funds every month? What exactly does it mean - "actively use all your funds"?

[03-Sep-18 11:06 AM] Tanya Lya#2332
@SHossain thanks for the answer. Could you please also answer the next question? I found more info which made me a bit more confused

[03-Sep-18 11:07 AM] SHossain#0007
You need to make at least one transaction every month. Either to yourself or to another address in order to keep accruing rewards.

[03-Sep-18 11:07 AM] SHossain#0007
That is starting in a week

[03-Sep-18 11:13 AM] Tanya Lya#2332
@SHossain ah, I see. Does the value of monthly transactions matter?

[03-Sep-18 11:13 AM] SHossain#0007
nope. best is to send all to self

[03-Sep-18 11:13 AM] SHossain#0007
do you use Agama?

[03-Sep-18 11:13 AM] Tanya Lya#2332
No, I use Guarda

[03-Sep-18 11:16 AM] Tanya Lya#2332
And what if I miss 1 month, but make 2 transactions the other month?

[03-Sep-18 11:17 AM] SHossain#0007
After 1 month the reward will stop accruing until you claim them. then it will stop again in 1 month from the time of the last tx

[03-Sep-18 11:34 AM] general_grievous#6992
hey, are the trade volumes for barterDEX as listed on coinmarketcap accurate?

[03-Sep-18 11:36 AM] general_grievous#6992
So I take it those figures on CMC are not accurate?

[03-Sep-18 11:40 AM] general_grievous#6992
> Www.dexstats.info
Is the volume in BTC?

[03-Sep-18 11:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
it's in relative volume

[03-Sep-18 11:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd/btch volume, relvol is in btch

[03-Sep-18 11:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362

@SHossain sorry for being so meticulous, I just want to be sure to get things right. So, if I see this in my wallet, that's fine? https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xw5-nmKGRCz2oDdpumkTiybHM7C1MfMZ/view?usp=sharing  When will the funds become available, and does it matter if I claim them directly or wait?

[03-Sep-18 11:54 AM] SHossain#0007
you are not accruing rewards at the moment. LockTime is not set https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/4fc4208ddec64447c65b0f28b08af9f99be4c00c8d7b633a3d4671d5659493d3

[03-Sep-18 12:00 PM] SHossain#0007
did you send the funds from an exchange?

[03-Sep-18 12:01 PM] SHossain#0007
you can send all of them again to your same address. and check the txid in explorer if you see LockTime for the tx.

[03-Sep-18 12:08 PM] Tanya Lya#2332
@SHossain I sent them from the web wallet of Guarda

[03-Sep-18 12:08 PM] SHossain#0007
ok

[03-Sep-18 12:09 PM] SHossain#0007
send all of them again to the same address from mobile

[03-Sep-18 12:26 PM] Tanya Lya#2332
you mean, resend them from the mobile wallet where they are now to the same mobile wallet address?

[03-Sep-18 12:33 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[03-Sep-18 12:33 PM] SHossain#0007
that may set the locktime. in that case, your funds will start accruing rewards

[03-Sep-18 12:35 PM] Tanya Lya#2332
yeah, but I can't just resend them from the mobile wallet to itself. I can only send it back to the web wallet, and from there resend it to the mobile. Will it work?

[03-Sep-18 12:39 PM] Tanya Lya#2332
and, actually, isn't that the locktime already set in the tx? https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mXoTPSn-gijJcAa9wANfj1249yxkwEnH/view?usp=sharing 12:23:13

[03-Sep-18 12:43 PM] SHossain#0007
did you actually check the link i shared above? if you already sent from web wallet which didn't set locktime, why do you want to do it again?

[03-Sep-18 12:45 PM] SHossain#0007
the mobile wallet should allow you to send funds to any valid address. you just need to send all funds to `RSvQTFsEThi5vDhcZ9UqVFmd6QkgqUJVBM` which is your address as you mentioned

[03-Sep-18 12:50 PM] Tanya Lya#2332
no, sorry, I missed the link. Now that I opened it it still doesn't make a lot of sense üò©  I mean, if they're already in my mobile wallet, how can I resend them to the same address?

[03-Sep-18 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@Tanya Lya 'LockTime' is an option setting that is independent from what time a tx was transmitted and/or put into a block

[03-Sep-18 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
when used, it is what determines how old a tx is in order to get a reward

[03-Sep-18 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
when not used, there's no reward because the reward is based on that timestamp

[03-Sep-18 12:55 PM] Tanya Lya#2332
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ hello, thanks. And how can I turn on this option setting?

[03-Sep-18 12:56 PM] SHossain#0007
@Tanya Lya can you send KMD using the wallet to any other KMD address?

[03-Sep-18 12:59 PM] Tanya Lya#2332
hmm, I see two options. Option 1 - I could resend it to my web wallet and resend it back to my mobile wallet. Option 2 - I could ask a friend to receive a transfer from me and send it back to my mobile wallet

[03-Sep-18 01:00 PM] SHossain#0007
where do you see these 2 options only?

[03-Sep-18 01:02 PM] Tanya Lya#2332
in my mind )

[03-Sep-18 01:04 PM] SHossain#0007
don't use Option 1

[03-Sep-18 01:04 PM] SHossain#0007
use option 2

[03-Sep-18 01:05 PM] SHossain#0007
or use Agama Lite mode to create a new address, send the funds there and back to your Guarda wallet
