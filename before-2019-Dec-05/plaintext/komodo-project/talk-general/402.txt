What are the pro and cons, and differences in costs, when choosing this in the composer:
"Choose whether to make your chain part of an ordinary non-fungible interoperability cluster, or whether to make your chain part of a fungible cluster with another existing Smart Chain."

[27-Jul-19 06:58 AM] gcharang#6833
@D2D privacyalternatives.com 
there should be no difference in costs for the moment

this option is about the future

non-fungible interoperability cluster - all the smartchains in the same cluster that are notarised can exchange data (tokens etc.,) among themselves

fungible cluster - all the chains essentially represent the same crypto. can have different antara modules enabled, and coins moved from one chain to another, this is the scalability solution

[27-Jul-19 07:02 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Not an easy choice : )

[27-Jul-19 07:04 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
if the fungible cluster is more scalable sounds good though

[27-Jul-19 07:08 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I'm just testing it anyway, also to understand the costs
If I choose the non-fungible option, it says: "Choose the number of the cluster that you‚Äôd like to join. The number must be less than 100."

[27-Jul-19 07:08 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
How do you decide which number to put there

[27-Jul-19 07:10 AM] gcharang#6833
it is just arbitrary right now, you have to select a number no other dPoWed chain already has

until your chain gets dPoW activated, this option doesn't matter
some work needs to be dne to better explain this option

for now select any number
it will have antara modules enabled

[27-Jul-19 07:12 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
ok thanks

[27-Jul-19 07:17 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
it asks "Remember my Cluster", should I tick that box?

[27-Jul-19 07:21 AM] gcharang#6833
as you wish
it will just auto fill the same number when you are creating another chain

[27-Jul-19 07:27 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
OK thanks

I see that you are using Coinpayments for crypto payments
You should checkout Coingate, I think it's better

[27-Jul-19 07:52 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
they are more privacy-friendly

[27-Jul-19 08:02 AM] Markus#5464
kmd is not a privacy project if thats what u wanna say

[27-Jul-19 08:02 AM] Markus#5464
and u should know that by reading the new website, literally the whole point of the rebrand to get rid of ‚Äùkmd is a privacy coin‚Äù

[27-Jul-19 08:03 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
No, it's just that Coinpayments are really getting into the whole kyc thing
But Coingate, at least for now, seem more relaxed

[27-Jul-19 08:04 AM] Markus#5464
probably there will be multiple options later on

[27-Jul-19 08:05 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I think privacy is still part of the core values of Komodo, that doesn't change

[27-Jul-19 08:09 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I was thinking of launching a coin as part of the privacy tech directory I have, so that's why I was testing the composer.
But it's quite a large investment to start it

[27-Jul-19 08:16 AM] gcharang#6833
@D2D privacyalternatives.com you can start a chain and have all the integrations on your own (except dPoW)
if you have time and go through our docs

the fees are really the minimum requirement to maintain the servers and other operational costs

[27-Jul-19 08:17 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
OK will check that thanks

What would be great is, if Komodo team think a project has good potential, maybe they could accept payment using the coins from the blockchain being created, basically receiving a part of the founders' reward

[27-Jul-19 08:24 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, a framework for such deals is under preparation
For now the composer is just a showcase and it will be continously improved based on ideas we already have and feedback from users

How much does it cost to create a smart chain?

[27-Jul-19 08:38 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
I registered on composer.kmd.io --to check it out...
It looks impressive

[27-Jul-19 08:46 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
@Cruz X (10) I posted the costs a few minutes ago, just scroll up on this thread and you can see them
Or you can go through the process in the composer and at the end it shows your personalized costs in your dashboard

I also wanted to ask the following things:

1.  Does Komodo have (or will have soon) a wallet that interacts with the user through the browser (like Metamask)

2. Is there a guide somewhere to understand what needs to be done for regulations etc when launching a coin.
    For example if you create a blockchain and put the coins on AtomicDEX, Barterlly and other exchanges, what do you 
    need to do for compliance?

[27-Jul-19 09:09 AM] gcharang#6833
```

this is practically impossible to provide as there are too many jurisdictions and contradicting laws based on locations of issuer and buyer

the only thing we can say is trade of crypto from user to user in a true DEX like atomicDEX is exempt from money transamitter lisense

I installed a private gitlab on a server. Maybe we should backup everything from github to private repos. If github is closed or forbid crypto, we can keep history. I did it since 2 years because it happened that the github repo is deleted because of exit scam

[27-Jul-19 08:43 PM] phm87#7395
(I don t do it for kmd : too much repos to copy and no risk of exit scam here but github can be a single point of failure.)

[27-Jul-19 08:46 PM] phm87#7395
I mean to keep history and all branches

[27-Jul-19 08:47 PM] phm87#7395

@Deleted User how a team such as kmd team can use git and collaborate without a central server ? (Github)
I suggest to have a backup solution (to be able to continue to collaborate)
Indeed we can do it after the possible pbs but I prefer to think about solutions in advance and not wait until sth happens

[27-Jul-19 08:55 PM] phm87#7395
We did the same but behind a htaccess htpwd

There's a cool app (in beta) that I'm using that lets you mine from the mobile phone, you just have to tap on the mine button once a day. In a few months they've gained over 150k users/miners. If the Komodo ecosytem created something like this it could be great, even just for the exposure it can give to the ecosystem:

You do not need to leave the app open to mine. Pi does not affect your phone‚Äôs performance, drain your battery, or use your network data . Once you hit the lightning button, you can even close the app and you will continue to mine Pi.
