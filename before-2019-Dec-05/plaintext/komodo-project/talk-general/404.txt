only 0.15% of KMD was in zaddr

[31-Jul-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the new sapling parameters i dont hear any rational flaws against it, the reality is that the odds of a code bug is orders of magnitude greater as we have seen with ALL of the privacy protocols so far, including zcash, cryptonote, zcoin

[31-Jul-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to rely on the zcash scientists and the inventor of the zksnarks to have solved the main vulnerabilities

[31-Jul-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD has no zaddr anymore, if you want privacy use PIRATE

Gents what are the risk for buissnes to use cloud in special financial institutions?

[31-Jul-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
any non-encrypted data will be fully available eventually to anybody that wants to see it

[31-Jul-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
well, the encrypted data will be too, but as long as it has strong encryption, it should just be like white noise

@jl777c i haven't been staying up to date, so i apologize if this has been answered several times, but do u have any idea why arrr is still offline at cryptobridge? its been more than 2 months, and every time i ask for a reason on their thread, they just ignore it or say to wait for an update. hoping that maybe you had other info to share. thanks

[31-Jul-19 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
they keep trying, i think eventually it will be complete but they dont seem to be putting much effort into it, maybe you should ask them

[31-Jul-19 06:06 PM] napa#5694
@jl777c ok. thanks man. yeah i tried a bunch of times and they either ignore or tell me to wait on an update. preciate it man

jl777 implemented `-ac_adaptivepow` 2 days ago https://medium.com/@jameslee777/adaptivepow-the-solution-to-diff-stranding-of-smaller-blockchains-425609df5563
We are testing high hashrate attack on Komodo assetchains in #talk-mining channel. This hashrate attack will run for 30 mins max and diff will be very high. Then, we will stop all ASIC mining and use only 1 CPU thread to continue mining which will bring the diff down and the chain will not be stranded. This test will start at 8PM UTC today which is about 5 mis away.
You can keep an eye on the stats here http://178.159.11.114:8080/stats
If you want to help and have ASIC or hashpower, please point at stratum+tcp://178.159.11.114:3033

Right now $KMD is testing brand new tech that helps against a particular kind of hashrate attack called "diff stalling", where crazy powerful miner makes difficulty so high that the rest of the network could take years to find the next block.
Adaptive PoW can be used with ...

jl777 repo is the main one (but doesn't have pre-compiled binaries)
the KomodoPlatform repo isn't always up-to-date (but has pre-compiled binaries)

[01-Aug-19 10:36 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
every year there's at least 1 mandatory update for Komodo wallets to update the Notary keys for the new year/season

[01-Aug-19 10:36 AM] lc123456#5516
when was it updated recently?

[01-Aug-19 10:37 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
July 14/15 (depending on time zone) was the date this year
