it's strange how the funds moved as he logged in

[05-Jun-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
the hacker was collected the largest addresses that were using agama and waiting for more and more

[05-Jun-19 04:42 PM] tomsmith26#8707
just make some pumps for KMD after the trouble but no risk occured

[05-Jun-19 04:44 PM] DingDongSoLong#0148

[05-Jun-19 04:45 PM] P1#6189
i can change  WIF? i've used a similar to the old one and it is a risk, right? Or i have to generate a new seed/WIF and move them there? (i'm alread on Verus)

[05-Jun-19 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Getnewaddress RPC is your mate

[05-Jun-19 04:50 PM] P1#6189
yes i've already did it already moved the funds to the Verus but maybe i did a mistake and i've put a similar WIF passwrod in this new one on Verus; so it could be a risk? If yes, i will generate a new address with a new seed/much different WIF again on Versus and i move them there (if i can't change the WIF password in the Verus new address)

[05-Jun-19 04:54 PM] P1#6189
i can't change it? better to not have a similar WIF password to the old which can be compromized, right?

[05-Jun-19 04:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
when u say wif password do u mean seed password?

[05-Jun-19 04:58 PM] P1#6189
yes, the one you can choose when you generate the adress, the one you can put it instead of the seed to login

[05-Jun-19 04:59 PM] starfleet#5156
I did export a WIF from the Verus Agama from a new wallet. So I suppose it is save to transfer to that new address corresponding to that WIF?

[05-Jun-19 05:03 PM] DingDongSoLong#0148
Just making sure, now that everything is out of my Agama there‚Äôs nothing else I need to do right?

[05-Jun-19 05:05 PM] P1#6189
oh i think that is not the WIF but is the seed encrypt key PIN, right?  i mean the one i can put it to login and that i've chosen it when i generated the adress; so it's not a problem if is similar to the old one?

[05-Jun-19 05:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
@DingDongSoLong check <https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php> with your address to see if u have any other assets in that address

[05-Jun-19 05:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
@P1 is the seed different?

[05-Jun-19 05:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Deleted User i think he generated a new seed in verus but used the same password for the pin

[05-Jun-19 05:06 PM] P1#6189
yes

[05-Jun-19 05:06 PM] P1#6189
exactly

[05-Jun-19 05:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
which in theory should be fine as the agama seed was compromised

[05-Jun-19 05:08 PM] DingDongSoLong#0148
So if all my funds are out do I need to uninstall agama for other security reason?

[05-Jun-19 05:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
just get rid of it for now

[05-Jun-19 05:09 PM] DingDongSoLong#0148
Thanks for the help

[05-Jun-19 05:11 PM] P1#6189
ok, so that PIN is not a problem; i've  moved all to the new seed in Verus and i've seen it all now so all seem ok, i just uninistall the agama now; thanks for the help

[05-Jun-19 05:12 PM] mrlynch#5735

[05-Jun-19 05:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
quick steps to move your funds from agama lite wallet
1. import agama seed in chameleon pay or magnum wallet
2. download verus agama and create new seed - get address
3. send funds from bad agama to new safe address via chameleon or magnum

these seem to be the quickest ways atm
please see pinned messages for more details

Is there any chances of inside job?  Agama dev? Or how was this noticed? Github picture of agama dev has gone anonymous it seems.

[05-Jun-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810

[05-Jun-19 05:28 PM] verymuchso#9902

[05-Jun-19 05:30 PM] verymuchso#9902

@Tobias Nunes you need to export your privatekeys using your seed to use Magnum

[05-Jun-19 05:31 PM] PTYX#6840
They don't use seeds like Chameleon or Guarda

[05-Jun-19 05:32 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Magnum?  You have a link for the download, I don't spend much time here, I mod another crypto community.

[05-Jun-19 05:33 PM] lwkl72#7664
How you will resolve problem with dp??

[05-Jun-19 05:34 PM] agnewpickens#7393
OK, you all under the gun, I will have to check back later, syncing KMD Qt wallet in the mean time.

[05-Jun-19 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
with our fast action, we rescued about 8 million KMD and over 100 BTC, but as of now it seems about a million KMD has been stolen. I am working on a plan that I hope will be an acceptable outcome to most. Please be aware that even if your funds got swept, there are others that have nothing left and i would like to come up with a plan where nobody is wiped out. in order to do this, we need as accurate of a damage assessment as possible. So please make sure to file a claim with your details as soon as possible so we can get a handle on what actually happened.

once we quantify the actual problem at hand, then we can make a specific plan. I would like to make all the smaller accounts 100% whole, but there isnt enough funds for all accounts to be 100%. I think if the big amounts ends up around 80% to 90%. As long as the damage is less than a million KMD, then I will be able to find the funds to cover it, but if it is more than a million, well we will cross that path if it turns out that way.

So for now, we need to be able to assess the scope of the damage, it could be that we wont have 100% of people claiming and the 5% rewards (400,000 per year) can end up covering most of the claims if they are coming in over time. What does it mean to be a small account? A big account? I dont know yet. I am without sleep for over 30+ hours and I dont want to make any decisions in this state.

Please be patient and file your claims, that is what will help the most. The general plan is to protect the smaller accounts fully, make sure nobody is wiped out, use 5% rewards to cover some of the costs and I will also personally put in half a million KMD. Until we have the accurate numbers, we can only guess as to the specific plan.

[05-Jun-19 05:48 PM] kpprabhu#9635
@costa2439 the new public address created for chips is invalid. When I try to move Chips it says invalid address.
