@Deleted User unfortunately I work with people that are quite a lot older than myself, and meetings in person are a lot more efficient than google hangouts or whatever in that case

on traditionnal work, even if you are disabled, and can t fully move, or it is a pain, even if you demonstrate you can work day and night remotely, they want you to do 2H of train everyday, because, heh, it s so cool to speak with colleagues at the coffee machine
