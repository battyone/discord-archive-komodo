A special thanks to the KMD community from HUSH community, for helping is so many ways to get our DPoW protection started in record time in our new asset chain. I don't want to name names because it's so many people and I don't want to forget anybody. Some KMD members are just purely amazing, HUSH is so lucky to be part of the larger KMD community

Uuh CHIPS went moon 🚀

[16-Apr-19 03:19 PM] jorian#4555
bug in barterdex i think

[16-Apr-19 03:19 PM] jorian#4555
you wanna buy CHIPS at $1.24?

[16-Apr-19 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1 buy of 0.01 CHIPS will moon the price when volume has been anemic

[16-Apr-19 03:21 PM] farl#9964
Volume is 105k

[16-Apr-19 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for the total of the month?

[16-Apr-19 03:21 PM] farl#9964
Day

[16-Apr-19 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and yesterday was?

[16-Apr-19 03:22 PM] farl#9964
Not bad for CHIPS 🙂

[16-Apr-19 03:22 PM] farl#9964
Bug buyer stepping in?

[16-Apr-19 03:24 PM] farl#9964
Don’t know yesterday volume. How can I check?

[16-Apr-19 03:24 PM] jorian#4555
and previous 5 months were?

[16-Apr-19 03:24 PM] jorian#4555
CHIPS is actually on CMC

[16-Apr-19 03:24 PM] farl#9964
Yes, but only with CoinExchange

[16-Apr-19 03:24 PM] jorian#4555
i think coinexchange.io has the most liquid market

[16-Apr-19 03:25 PM] farl#9964
Blockfolio gives a few, but mostly low volume

[16-Apr-19 03:25 PM] farl#9964
You guys talk like the project has no future.

`You guys talk like the project has no future.`
There's no part of us that thinks that or implied that, just saying that you have to look at context

[16-Apr-19 03:29 PM] farl#9964

Is Pondsea still on the CHIPS project?

[16-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I didn't think he ever was. Too busy with Hyperdex.

[16-Apr-19 03:34 PM] farl#9964
Before that. I bought CHIPS from him in the beginning

[16-Apr-19 03:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
He was an early miner I think

[16-Apr-19 03:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Big bags 😃

[16-Apr-19 03:37 PM] farl#9964
Yes, that’s correct now you mention it. Now I remember

[16-Apr-19 03:37 PM] farl#9964
Very BIG bags

@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap  maybe a section on custom consensus, formerly(?) called crypto conditions. (Similar to but Not to be mistaken as smart contracts). Rogue and kmdice are playable games but also cc examples/ modules. Same as soduku and Tetris? Also there are many CC as listed in the doc jl wrote.

[17-Apr-19 05:10 AM] joe2x4#5987
Barterdex, hyperdex, and soon mobiledex all use marketmaker 1 technology and soon marketmaker2 (mm2). mobiledex I believe is just mm2 technology.  So the Dex stuff might need own category as well.

[17-Apr-19 05:11 AM] coingirl87#6489
Hyperdex is still alive?

[17-Apr-19 05:12 AM] coingirl87#6489
I ask because last notarization was in february🤔

[17-Apr-19 05:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap  it looks like there is confusion on your spreadsheet regarding supernet. I'd say, yes it is still definitely part of kmd ecosystem. I believe supernet asset gets Vote tokens for nn elections. Supernet is an asset originally launched on NXT now migrated to KMD. I believe it still contains significant assets that James has curated quite wonderfully since 2014. It also is supposed to function as rev shares for ecosystem profits. Its ticker is UNITY and KMD definitely embodies this. More info about supernet. https://digitalcashassets.com/crypto-coins/currency/UNITY-SuperNET-534.html

I am pretty sure that the whole Supernet Zaibutsu is very much sound and solid- except for the fact that its revenue machine has not really kicked into operation yet

[17-Apr-19 06:00 AM] joe2x4#5987
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap  The way I see it, your spreadsheet needs these categories.

Ecosystem technologies
-Marketmaker, & coins that are compatible
-Agama, & coins compatible

Kmd Asset chains
Ie: Pirate

Kmd Revshare Asset chains
Ie:Dex

Kmd CC  Asset chains
Ie: Rogue

Kmd source forked chains
-ie: Verus

Kmd sister chains
-ie: Chips

Third party Kmd DPOW protected
-ie:EMC2

Kmd services
-ie: Coming, or chainzilla, chainmakers

Maybe even Notary Nodes as these are KMD luminaries.

[17-Apr-19 06:16 AM] gcharang#6833
the one thing I would make clear is 
```
Kmd Source forked chains
-ie: Verus
```
instead of
```
Kmd forked chains
-ie: Verus
```
