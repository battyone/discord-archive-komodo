reward? problem is when i send 1KMD to myself all my interest (which is now thousands) will be send who mines the block 😦

[28-Sep-18 11:49 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Not if they fix it, if not we will have a interest claiming app to do it

@BadAss we don't call it **interest** anymore, we call it Komodo Active User Reward, in short **Reward**

ah ok but how can i claim mine in agama?

[28-Sep-18 11:55 AM] NedBGQ#8462
What great news!?

[28-Sep-18 11:56 AM] SHossain#0007
if you want to claim rewaard using Agama, you need to control your privkey. Ledger doesn't allow that. there is a work around. but, we don't officially recommend doing that as it exposes your privkey.

[28-Sep-18 11:57 AM] SHossain#0007
If you prefer extreme security, use Ledger (no reward)
If you want to claim reward, use Komodo native, Agama, Agama Mobile, KomodoOcean-QT or Paper Wallet

[28-Sep-18 11:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
HyperDEX crew will be making a desktop app that will create the tx to be approved by your ledger wallet, it will send the coins + reward back to the original address, with a fee of 5-7% of the claimed reward going to support the dev costs

Komodo (2) 💪 

[28-Sep-18 11:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It would be a few clicks and you can enjoy your reward whilst still having the protection of the ledger.

[28-Sep-18 12:00 PM] Buddz1993#5380
rewards sounds better

[28-Sep-18 12:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Well that is if ledger doesnt fix it on the firmware level (been 2 years so not holding my breath)

[28-Sep-18 12:24 PM] snowdamn#2414
@hyperDEX  mergers & acquisitions are healthy
why not set a price for Komodo Official to buy app, so that can offer without fee?
but i understand if you expect Ledger to not bother to solve and fees to keep coming indefinitely 
thinking out loud

[28-Sep-18 12:26 PM] snowdamn#2414
you don't have to respond, i respect your entrepreneurship

[28-Sep-18 12:28 PM] snowdamn#2414
more like a jab to Komodo Official to make an offer lol 😂

[28-Sep-18 12:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
@hyperDEX to clarify, they won't be fixing anything, we will fix their firmware, they just need to accept the PR to merge it into their code. I'm in discussion with them regarding whether they'll accept our fix but they're being a bit stubborn. Either way, we can get it to work, we just may have to build our own Ledger app that users would have to load onto your ledger (alongside the official "Komodo" app) called "Komodo Reward" or similar that you'll have to run on your Ledger to claim interest as opposed to the normal Komodo app.

This won't mean interest claiming will automatically work on their own wallets, our custom app will be needed either way, it's just with the current Ledger KMD firmware it's impossible to sign a claim TX, that's what we need the fix for.

[28-Sep-18 07:17 PM] Stashius#2790
liquidity is spelled wrong on the website in the Why invest in KMD? section and BarterDEX Liquidity subsection

[28-Sep-18 08:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Thanks @lukechilds for clarifying. This is why you are worth the big bucks 😄

[28-Sep-18 08:38 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@snowdamn haha. Well the main thing with the claiming app fee is that it will go towards supporting dev costs for other tools myself and the team plan to build within Komodo. Currently HyperDEX is being self funded and due to mm 1.0's limitations, it is like having a lambo doing at 20 miles a hour and breaks down every few miles, no one wants to use that when their GM truck (centralized exchanged) can go faster. So there is no revenue and the dev costs dont stop 😃 

We tried a donation model in HyperDEX, (dont even know if we got any haha) but due to the bear market, that doesnt seem to be working either. So we are forced to look at other avenues and this seems to be a perfect fit. People would pay 5-10% of their reward claimed if it means they keep 90-95%.

[28-Sep-18 08:40 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Currently they keep 0% unless they want to risk playing with the privkeys

[28-Sep-18 08:42 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The alternative is to find another way to get funding, either some sort of Hyper chain or accepting work from other crypto projects

[28-Sep-18 10:55 PM] PTYX#6840
I think we should offer whitelabel dexes to clients.

[28-Sep-18 10:55 PM] PTYX#6840
create an sdk

[28-Sep-18 10:55 PM] PTYX#6840
charge them to brand the DEX or even offer a specialized hyperdex for dicos or something along those lines

[29-Sep-18 12:07 AM] 3D Artist#8842
Hi everyone! Just started reading up on KMD.  Is this compatible with any hardware wallets? Ledger Nano S?

[29-Sep-18 12:08 AM] 3D Artist#8842
Will the 5% Yearly reward decrease over time? Does this still need to be claimed monthly per account to remain in effect?

[29-Sep-18 12:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
Whitelabel DEX is a nice idea but seems a bit gimmicky

[29-Sep-18 12:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
what's the point of a currency having their own DEX as opposed to having a clear market winner that everyone enjoys using

[29-Sep-18 12:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
their currency will likely be supported all all BarterDEX frontends anyway so it makes no difference which exchange people use, it would purely be a marketing thing

[29-Sep-18 12:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what's the point of a currency having their own DEX`
Because of the `D` in `DEX` ?

[29-Sep-18 12:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
it's only their GUI

[29-Sep-18 12:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
it doesn't make the network any more decentralised

[29-Sep-18 12:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm not against multiple GUI implementations at all

[29-Sep-18 12:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
but whitelabelling the same GUI to multiple currencies is just pure marketing hype with no benefit

[29-Sep-18 12:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
To that end carried out, what's the point of 30some notarized assetchains?

[29-Sep-18 12:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 
>what's the point of 30some notarized assetchains?
They all server a different purpose?

[29-Sep-18 12:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As does a Verus Agama and as would CoinX DEX; value is in the eye of the user

[29-Sep-18 12:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm not sure I see your point

[29-Sep-18 12:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because they can start with a "prebrand" and then expand it to their own

[29-Sep-18 12:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
I have no issue with alternative GUIs, I think that's a great thing.
I jsut don't think having a whitelabel DEX that we customise with some colours and a logo is a beneficial to anyone apart from the currencies marketing department.

If they want to expand a DEX and add new features to it why not contribute to an existing project

[29-Sep-18 12:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
no need to slap your brand name all over it

[29-Sep-18 12:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
also, from a business point of view, once we've done two whitelabel DEXs, it would be pretty trivial to just diff the codebases, then any basic devleoper can see which files/images to update to roll their own. I don't think it's a very viable business model

[29-Sep-18 12:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`no need to slap your brand name all over it`
Because they can start from that point, learn wtf it is, and then expand from there to their own (which adds the `D` by Komodo not being the central point)

[29-Sep-18 12:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
Komodo isn't the central point, HyperDEX isn't even a Komodo project

[29-Sep-18 12:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mm is centralized to Komodo; you of all people should be able to see that

[29-Sep-18 12:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
of course

[29-Sep-18 12:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
we are talking about branded GUIs

[29-Sep-18 12:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
that said, a branded dICO fork is not a bad idea

[29-Sep-18 12:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
I can see the relevence in that and it would be useful to strip out the unrelated trading stuff to focus on the dICO pairs

[29-Sep-18 12:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If it's purely intended to be just a GUI branding and no support to make mm their own (eventually), then I agree with you
In my mind, the service should/could/would be to start with the GUI and charge as a service to eventually have their own mm

[29-Sep-18 12:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
making it truely decentralized

[29-Sep-18 12:39 AM] lukechilds#2707

That has been discussed before and I was under the impression that's what @PTYX was talking about.

I'm all for multiple mm implementations, definitely! Although I think we need to get mmv2 stable and performant and draft up a detailed spec before we can realistically go down that route.

[29-Sep-18 04:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
my wish list for pirate:
- the same agama seed able to give me a Z address as well
- Crypto-Conditions on PIRATE. Which is impossible as of now.

[29-Sep-18 04:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
at least I can wish and hope for good future

[29-Sep-18 04:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
until then it's only anon coin for me.

[29-Sep-18 04:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
big thing on it's own as compare to other

[29-Sep-18 04:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I also thought pirate just only being anon might be 1:1 valuable, but I think it's not correct.

[29-Sep-18 04:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
KMD still has a lot, and much more as compare to bitcoin, zcash or any other cruyptocurrency in industry to my opinion.

[29-Sep-18 04:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
from that point I think pirate is either a very high price, or may be from point of view of a miner whatever miner's mining cost is the expected price.

[29-Sep-18 04:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if the wish list comes true, even then I don't think pirate should be more valuable than kmd, of course kmd is the middle one to secure all assetchains and makes it possible to have CC ecosystem after all.

[29-Sep-18 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
if it gains adoption easier there is more liquidity, which seems to be a benefit

[29-Sep-18 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
talking about DEX whitelabel

[29-Sep-18 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
making Zaddress from seed is possible

[29-Sep-18 06:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I see a good enthusiasm among community, very surprised to see that pirate asset chain got multiple x the network hash rate to KMD, which is in every way unexpected.
I think while the block rewards are 256, till first halving, which counts to half of it's supply, miners will probably sell or may be dump to market... 
I have been looking for such blockchain's usecase when we first started talking on private only chains, I yet to see someone giving it usecase other than tortuga exchange, which is great, but would love to see what else can be possible on this private only chain. Then I can think of what value it is to me.

[29-Sep-18 06:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for now to me 0.1 is the all time high/top price for me

[29-Sep-18 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810
what usecase does XMR have?

[29-Sep-18 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE has the same

[29-Sep-18 06:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Pirate and Komodo are two different audiences,  I think it can take off on its own course.  Komodo is more technically elegant and useful,  but some people all they need is a currency. Send and receive
