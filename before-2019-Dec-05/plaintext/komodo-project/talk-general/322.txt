even if it's untouched move the funds

[05-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah

[05-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Caglio#3337
Anyway, an advice

[05-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Caglio#3337
is it safer to put it in that chameleon mobile wallet

[05-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Caglio#3337
or binance ?

[05-Jun-19 02:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
once a mobile wallet the other is a cex - it's your decision which one to use

[05-Jun-19 02:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
which one you trust more

[05-Jun-19 02:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
personally i don't hold large amounts on either

[05-Jun-19 02:43 PM] Caglio#3337
Is chain thing paying interest?

[05-Jun-19 02:43 PM] Caglio#3337
If not, I guess I would rather put it on binance :/

[05-Jun-19 02:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
i don't know.. i think so

[05-Jun-19 02:44 PM] Caglio#3337
thank you for your help

[05-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Caglio#3337
hm binance closed wallet

[05-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Caglio#3337
for deposit and withdraw

[05-Jun-19 02:52 PM] PeterAu#2809
@Caglio , ,, Cryptos were not designed to earn interest  and  binance was hacked ... ... For now, move them somewhere and move them again (i.e.: don't leave them on binance & chain).. ..  Cold storage or Paper Wallet ... ....!!

[05-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Caglio#3337
@PeterAu I was just about to do that

[05-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Caglio#3337
But seems like I cannot do anything üòâ

Are wallet.dat files corrupted by this thing? If I load up Verus Agama, and use that to create a new address in the same old wallet.dat file...is that no good?

[05-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Sdunbar#5064
prob closed wallet to prevent the dumpening i guess?

[05-Jun-19 03:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Potato Guy 9000 assume everything that came in contact with Agama compromised

[05-Jun-19 03:00 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
well shit.

[05-Jun-19 03:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you're using lite mode just generate a new seed in another wallet

[05-Jun-19 03:00 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
I just filled out the damn form with the address I made that way

[05-Jun-19 03:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you're using native .. rename wallet.dat

[05-Jun-19 03:01 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
otherwise I'd have to wait for the whole chain to sync, lite mode wasn't working

[05-Jun-19 03:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
can you not edit?

[05-Jun-19 03:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
you don't need to wait for chain to sync if it's already sync-ed

[05-Jun-19 03:01 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
I wouldn't know how to get back to it to edit it;

[05-Jun-19 03:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
close native wallet .. rename wallet.dat ... start safe wallet

[05-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
ok...so If I fill out the form again, is that an edit?

[05-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
lol

[05-Jun-19 03:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
oh shit... no

[05-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
otherwise they're just getting two forms from Spuddyminer and they'll hate me and not give me back any KMD

[05-Jun-19 03:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
dm SHossain with the details

[05-Jun-19 03:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
he'll pick it up when he returns

[05-Jun-19 03:13 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
Roll back incoming?

[05-Jun-19 03:13 PM] boxalex#9950
Meanwhile, Binance: Wallet Maintenance, Deposit and Withdrawal Suspended for KMD.

[05-Jun-19 03:25 PM] Caglio#3337
@boxalex I know, that sucks

[05-Jun-19 03:25 PM] boxalex#9950
i managed to get my funds there right bevor they suspended it. I just let others know that it's no more an option right now.

[05-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Caglio#3337

no.. agama mobile is not safe

[05-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Sherdogz#6731
@PTYXYes I've moved all my funds but was wondering if i can use a newly generated address with the agama wallet? Or is it the Agama wallet that's compromised?

[05-Jun-19 04:00 PM] mrlynch#5735

```use chameleon pay wallet to import your seed on mobile, and send funds to another address```

[05-Jun-19 04:02 PM] CryptoJesus#3041
Does it have the coins agama have?

[05-Jun-19 04:03 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Thanks its clear now so you could import a never touched agama seed safely in chameleon?

[05-Jun-19 04:06 PM] PTYX#6840
The Chameleon Pay team has checked the code and didn't find the affected package. Therefore, it's safe to use. However, it being a mobile wallet I recommend using it as a spend wallet. Don't keep your life savings in it.

sent KMD to Verus lite on the Agama, now i'm safe? i have just to wait ro recieve it on Verus Lite agama and then i delete the old one?

[05-Jun-19 04:08 PM] P1#6189
confirmations are slow

[05-Jun-19 04:13 PM] starfleet#5156
So is it ok to use the Verus Wallet Agama to generate a new seed?

[05-Jun-19 04:13 PM] starfleet#5156
Ok, because it looks quite same

[05-Jun-19 04:14 PM] starfleet#5156
OK, well just to ask, is it still at risk if I leave the KMD on the addresses that have not been secured by the komodo team so far?

[05-Jun-19 04:15 PM] starfleet#5156
Ok

[05-Jun-19 04:19 PM] P1#6189
ok, but i've sent them to the VRSC lite address, i will recieve them as VerusCoin?

[05-Jun-19 04:20 PM] starfleet#5156
@Deleted User Can I use the old (maybe corrupted) seed with the Verus Agama wallet?

[05-Jun-19 04:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Can I say just for a second that this sucks... I feel awful for @pbca26 and the rest of the team.  
I wish you all positive mental health and a laser like focus to fix the issue.  Do not get concerned with self doubt or fear.  These things happen and it's how they are dealt with that determine the outcomes.   Remember to take breaks for yourself when you can... without energy and rest, the mind can't focus. 

If you're a person of science, remember, Earth was once hit by a planteoid so large, that the rock ceased to exist.... until it fixed the problem and became the amazing thing it is today.
If you're a person of religion, remember, everything happens for a reason.

Battles and challenges provide us with the wealth of knowledge and learning opportunities we can't test for. 
Thank you for your efforts team KMD.

Is there a wallet available where i dont have to download the entire blockchain ie oceanqt?

[05-Jun-19 04:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Also to Pirate Users.... We suggest moving funds.   We have no way to be certain yet if this is limited to LITE mode.

[05-Jun-19 04:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
To be clear, this is not a Komodo issue or a Pirate issue, it is an Agama wallet dependency issue.
With that said, we are asking ALL pirate users to move funds, EVEN if you used Agama ONCE in 2019.
There is no way to know yet if the exploit can be used to access native coins, but this is a case of better safe than sorry. 

Please contact our devs in #wallet-support for help if needed.

[05-Jun-19 04:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@ohweoh - You can use the Verus Agama wallet linked in my tweet above or on their main website.

[05-Jun-19 04:26 PM] ohweoh#0581
thx fishy

[05-Jun-19 04:26 PM] P1#6189
on kdmexplorer.io now i see the new address where i've sent my KMD has rieceved them but in the Verus Agama i will see them as VerusCoin in the VSCR Lite? (i generated a VRSC Lite addreess like it says in the guide)
