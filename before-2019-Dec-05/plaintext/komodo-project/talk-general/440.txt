There are no `plans` if NEM applies for the listing and it will be technically possible with the new chain, then they will get listed.

Votes for komodo please!

[26-Oct-19 02:27 PM] Lennart#9331
this poll just shows that people don't do research beyond place 50 CMC lol

[26-Oct-19 02:27 PM] Lennart#9331
i guess ppl just still don't know

[26-Oct-19 02:48 PM] Markus#5464
can be also that Eth community is probably 300x bigger than kmd community

[26-Oct-19 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
probably more than that

[26-Oct-19 03:02 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821

[26-Oct-19 03:02 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
no connections

[26-Oct-19 03:04 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
5 connections now , maybe just have to wait a little longer than normal\

[26-Oct-19 03:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Is that latest?

[26-Oct-19 03:42 PM] Lennart#9331
yeah just released afaik

[26-Oct-19 04:21 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Komodo daemon in Verus Agama has not changed afaik, so connectivity should be identical to other versions.

[26-Oct-19 05:14 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Are you guys still working with Amazon, a project called chain lizard or any other company trying out your tech?

[26-Oct-19 05:34 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Mr.Cryptodude  chainlizard = Antara Composer ,   A project called Commod has just used it to create their chain,  it is a former NXT coin looking to upgrade

[26-Oct-19 05:40 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Ah okey, but are they still working with you?

[26-Oct-19 06:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Mr.Cryptodude  yes,  we are still working with AWS ,  that is what composer is built on and it utilizes its infrastructure

[26-Oct-19 06:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Currently we are working on getting on other major cloud providers too.

[26-Oct-19 09:45 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Oh nice hope you succeed

[27-Oct-19 08:07 PM] Smedley#8094
What can the antara gaming sdk be used for? The documentation does not appear to talk about incorporating block chain

[27-Oct-19 09:05 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
How is development with defi chains and dual daemon going? Will it be completed before 2020?

[27-Oct-19 09:05 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
You guys have a lot going on it’s crazy, are the amount of devs growing?

how can I mine that coin

[27-Oct-19 10:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"that coin"?

[27-Oct-19 10:26 PM] Artist#0765
versus

[27-Oct-19 10:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pretty much FPGAs are the way to go for mining VRSC (or so I'm told)

[27-Oct-19 10:27 PM] Artist#0765
no I mean mining through Agama

[27-Oct-19 10:28 PM] Oszy#5734
click start mining

[27-Oct-19 10:29 PM] Artist#0765
should I run in native mode?

[27-Oct-19 10:29 PM] Oszy#5734
yes only native

[27-Oct-19 10:29 PM] Oszy#5734
but that is solo mining from the wallet so it could take months to find a block alone

[27-Oct-19 10:29 PM] Artist#0765
any other option?

[27-Oct-19 10:29 PM] Oszy#5734
better join a pool like luckpool.net and use ccminer or nheqminer

[28-Oct-19 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but 120 is BS`
That steams out of last year's paranoia over equihash chains and 51% attacks

[28-Oct-19 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pretty much everyone jacked up confirms that week and the only one's that came down did so after long conversations

They bring out those stats every month or so right and each month the orderis completly different.
I seems to me it's an instrument for them to short and long certain coins and make their living with it
Pretty sure only a handful of people get the to be published version so see

[28-Oct-19 04:37 PM] Aron“XuanLeeeeee“Goldberg#3393
and how was it?

[28-Oct-19 04:38 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the ticket cost to get into komodo island is 14 million rupiah now, excluding transportation

[28-Oct-19 04:39 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it's about 1000 usd

[28-Oct-19 04:39 PM] alperC#7758
It was great! It was back in 2016 there wasn't that much tourists like today, we've combined it with an '3 sisters tour' where you basically live on a boat for 3 days and visit different islands

[28-Oct-19 04:40 PM] alperC#7758
Wow, we paid like $200 each

[28-Oct-19 04:40 PM] alperC#7758
