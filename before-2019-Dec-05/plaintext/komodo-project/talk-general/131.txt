@ColorMeCrypted @VeriBlock @KomodoPlatform In my understanding, KMD only can protect the blockchains under komodo ecosystem, the altcoin blockchains has to be built on komodoplatform. But for Veriblock, any altcoin blockchain can be protected by btc high level security.

currently KMD DPoW protects these external non-KMD coins: HUSH, EMC2, CHIPS, GAME

Has komodo platform considered filing for any patents?

[14-Nov-18 06:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ll our code is MIT licence I think... not sur we can ü§∑

[14-Nov-18 07:02 AM] actionslacks#4072
Seems that the mega corps are on a patent filing spree for anything blockchain related. I‚Äôm all about open source, but I‚Äôd hate for some unscrupulous patent troll to pull the rug out from any of the stuff going on here. Could be considered a defensive measure.

[14-Nov-18 07:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wil be uploading all of staked/KMD into a dpow blockchain as soon as it even close to ready.... to prove I had it first...

[14-Nov-18 07:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not that that does a lot without a very good lawyer I guess...cant just go swearig at them in court with a private key and a blockchain tgz saying its mine first and they are lieing I guess.

[14-Nov-18 07:12 AM] actionslacks#4072
No telling, interesting times ahead for patent law concerning the blockchain I‚Äôm sure. Being that most of the IP created here is distributed across all worldwide legal jurisdictions simultaneously, could just be too big a thing to shut down as well.

[14-Nov-18 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would say so yes.

How goes the battle of getting KMD listed on the assets page for Coinbase?

[14-Nov-18 08:41 PM] Berg#2666
Seeing a lot of random garbage coins in there, figured KMD would make the cut üòâ

[14-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Berg#2666
Ah, looking further into it, it looks like it's based on market cap

hello

[14-Nov-18 10:03 PM] mehrdadb30#9667
i have paper wallet of komodo

[14-Nov-18 10:04 PM] mehrdadb30#9667
if i hold my komodo in paper wallet i get 5% reward per mounth

[14-Nov-18 10:05 PM] mehrdadb30#9667
and another question how many gigs komodo blockchain?

[14-Nov-18 10:12 PM] Hermes#6934
@mehrdadb30  You need to claim the reward at least once a month ...I will recommend Agama to do this ..is the easier way

[14-Nov-18 10:20 PM] mehrdadb30#9667
ok and how many gigs komodo blockchain for sync wallet

[14-Nov-18 10:30 PM] Hermes#6934
With the private key of the public address you claim it on lite mode , but if you want to use native the blocks can take up to 7 GB

[14-Nov-18 10:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
```$ ./src/komodo-cli getblockchaininfo|grep size
  "size_on_disk": 5255912995,```

[14-Nov-18 10:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
that figure seems to under-report, but it available from RPC

[14-Nov-18 10:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
patches welcome

[14-Nov-18 10:32 PM] mehrdadb30#9667
thanks @Hermes  @dukeleto

[14-Nov-18 10:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
that figure is in bytes, so it says 5012MB or 5GB

[14-Nov-18 10:33 PM] mehrdadb30#9667
in lite  mode can i see other token like zilla?

[14-Nov-18 10:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i think that maybe KMD has a bit extra data per xtn and block, and size_on_disk might need to take that into account. It under-reports by ~30% according to filesystem. Put it on my stack of bugs to look into :abusedsmily:

[14-Nov-18 10:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
@mehrdadb30 yes, you can choose lite mode or not, for each coin

[14-Nov-18 10:34 PM] mehrdadb30#9667
good

[14-Nov-18 10:34 PM] mehrdadb30#9667
i use lite mode

[14-Nov-18 10:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
most coins have both light and full modes, some coins might only have full

Great live stream. A lot of good information and thought provoking conversations in there. Definitely worth a watch. Nice work @Bitcoin Benny, it is always a pleasure listening to what you have to say. I am interested to see how Komodo(and the platform) aims to tackle the problems you discuss. I like the point that having the best/fastest tech is great and all, but if everyday people are too scared to use it, how will we ever achieve mass adoption.

[15-Nov-18 03:37 AM] optickle#9937

Now we will really start to see who and what crypto projects are here to build. 

Crypto bear market has always been very bad historically, but it always recovered.

A few years from now, those that stick around will be called "lucky investors" by newcomers.

can the 51% empty block attack be "blocked" some way by auto rejecting chain with many (>N)  orphaned blocks ?

[15-Nov-18 08:10 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
changing consensus rules ? or it's not practical ?

[15-Nov-18 08:13 AM] Raybobo#4279
Morning guysüëã

[15-Nov-18 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
it isnt a 51% double spend attack by reorging, if they are just mining empty blocks then what would be best is to disallow empty blocks. though if there are periods where blocks with tx get confirmations and notarized, it would reset the empty chain attack to that point

[15-Nov-18 09:23 AM] wolfgang#3508
Wow. Btc ded. Crypto ded. Was fun while it lasted kids!

[15-Nov-18 09:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think the crypto mining infrastructure is too heavily built up to just go away.

[15-Nov-18 09:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
10% drop in BTC makes some hobbyist miners turn off their rigs, it does not effect large farms with almost 0 electricity cost

[15-Nov-18 09:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
many GPU miners are probably turning off their machines right now, ASICs are happily making noise and heat for a while still....

[15-Nov-18 09:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
And really, this is nothing... at all.

[15-Nov-18 10:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
BTC went from $1 USD  to $30 back to ~$1 within a few days at one point, if you want to speak of historical volatility, yes 10% is nothing üòÉ

[15-Nov-18 10:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am wondering if BTC dropping 10% is because people are moving money around because of this: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-15/pound-struggles-to-hold-ground-as-may-faces-risk-of-tory-revolt

seems kind of like a perfect storm type scenario. Oil, stocks, currencies, crypto... is this the one?

[15-Nov-18 10:42 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
was just checking metals but they are not doing too great for the year - something is going on with out a doubt, interested to see what comes form this oil dive tbh

[15-Nov-18 10:44 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
its like most 2018 gains has been erased form most charts

[15-Nov-18 10:44 AM] actionslacks#4072
As someone directly affected by the price of oil I am extremely interested as well

[15-Nov-18 10:45 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
anything to do with the saudis threat you think?

[15-Nov-18 10:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
the Saudi's tried to squash the shale boom but the drillers just lowered the cost of drilling. I think it has to do with russia and iran more than anything

[15-Nov-18 10:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
they're playing chicken

[15-Nov-18 10:47 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
yeah you could be right - im hearing now there is too much oil lol

[15-Nov-18 10:48 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
where are people hedging tho in cash?

[15-Nov-18 10:51 AM] actionslacks#4072
electric car production and sales are exceeding projections. ride sharing apps, kids don't buy cars as much anymore. cash is king. the fed is making it more profitable to have liquidity? idk I also have a feeling the midterms did not go as planned and someone is pissed off about it.

[15-Nov-18 10:53 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
agree on electric car market. seen noise around lithium stocks also as they are required for the batterys ever more.

[15-Nov-18 10:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
@actionslacks  the US is pulling more oil out of the ground than ever before, because gov subsidies makes it cheaper than renewables. But renewables are much cheaper by themselves. The Oil market is digging itself into a deep hole...

[15-Nov-18 10:56 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i bet the price of fuel stays the same though, usual case in the uk lol

[15-Nov-18 10:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
most shale drillers are leveraged to the hilt and have yet to make a profit as well

[15-Nov-18 10:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
this will be oil crash number 3 or 4 for me. I'm ready this time.
