I will concede that there is a point where external hashrate loss becomes a centralization issue

[04-Sep-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
changing coin supply?

[04-Sep-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
emission rate of current blocks. that certainly seems like a very drastic step

[04-Sep-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
problem is that there is no way to know the amount of unclaimed rewards ahead of time

[04-Sep-19 03:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`problem is that there is no way to know the amount of unclaimed rewards ahead of time`

@Deleted User binance blocks going away, doesnt mean 100% of unclaimed rewards goes away

[04-Sep-19 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you are conflating things that i said`
welcome to the world you act in

[04-Sep-19 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so there will be > 0 unclaimed rewards, eliminating that would lead to lower hashrate than if it wasnt eliminated

[04-Sep-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
most of the big blocks are in the 5 to 50 KMD range nowadays

[04-Sep-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
because if the mining rewards are less, the hashrate will be less

[04-Sep-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
no, the steady mining hashrate will be affected if the occasional 5 to 50 KMD blocks are gone

[04-Sep-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
any miner that actually benchmarks the return over time, will be able to measure the effect

[04-Sep-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
binance just started claiming rewards, so we dont have any full month of the post-binanceclaiming period yet

[04-Sep-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
but to guess, almost all the big blocks were from binance withdraws

[04-Sep-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so, it could be a relatively small amount that will be and then it will be a moot point

[04-Sep-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
i suggest we track the monthly amounts we are talking about and then we can decide on how much of an issue it is

[04-Sep-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe its not even worth doing a hardfork over. it might sound easy to just cap the block reward, but that is VERY tricky code and would need a lot of testing to make sure it doesnt break anything

[04-Sep-19 03:25 PM] Mylo#8306
the problem reduces how much of a problem it is as time goes on because there are less UTXOs from block <1000000

[04-Sep-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
no change to consensus is easy

[04-Sep-19 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`because if the mining rewards are less, the hashrate will be less`
I think that depends on "public knowledge" of the less
I know it's the whole dead horse and all; however, I'm not sure that the "average miner" outside of luckpool is currently aware of their current less (given the randomness of their random bonus)

[04-Sep-19 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I know that my position on that seems "on both sides", that's mostly because it is (due to being a miner and knowing things that the "average" miner doesn't just by being active in the community)

{Reactions}
🆗 

[04-Sep-19 03:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so you're proposing doing away with rewards entirely? on both sides?

[04-Sep-19 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm lost as to how sending a tx to yourself is "work" and massive hashrate (the literal definition of work in PoW) isn't
`Free rewards make no sense`
it's the basis of rewards

[04-Sep-19 03:38 PM] dukeleto#7326

So you spend $500k and runn a ton of equipment and your reward is 3 and I spend $6k and check a box and my reward is 20 🤔

`because if the mining rewards are less, the hashrate will be less`
If the entire world and its currencies would be revolving around Komodo, that would be a reliable prediction.
However, if the rewards diminish, less coins will be sold on exchanges. If no other factors change, demand would be equal as before. Logic dictates that KMD price will rise.
Although rewards are lowered, it doesn't mean the value of the mining effort is lowered too. As long as the value of the rewards (especially in relation to other chains rewards) remains equal, the hashrate will not change. The cryptomarket will regulate the hashrate on the chain as it does now.

[04-Sep-19 03:44 PM] Audo#5667
no one is blocked, the channel is simply on 'slow mode'. Heated debates can be taken elsewhere.

censorship and ruin  is indeed the "fix" for open discourse @Audo 
`For the record: I'm out of here... I'm not going to wait 5 minutes before I can answer...`
that's the whole point, we wouldn't want to have people actually chatting on a chat forum (the dead silence is much preferred)
`it's not censorship when the discussion can be taken to appropriate public channel`
yes:
`This channel is meant for Komodo technology dicussion [so stop discussing Komodo technology and protocol here]`
....
`There are 100 channels here`
99% of which are more of a problem than a solution
It's neat that the "solution" to people having a dialog is forcing them to write a text wall 👍🏽

[04-Sep-19 03:52 PM] Audo#5667

Some people??? Or the majority???
I made 1 post in the past few hours, yet I'm the victim of censorship... But if we compare general demonization of crypto as being drug-related everybody protests vivdly. How is this different?

Luckpool worked on his pool to get a huge part of blocks with huge reward. Nobody could compete : luckpool tech > all. Decker (and others) worked hard to setup hunting pool in order to get the big blocks: now nobody can compete with hunting pool. I am working on a community mining pool (see my previous msg). Sorry if a new tech willbeat old tech but it is how the world evolves I think

@Audo I don't appreciate the `if no one cares`. I intended to enter the discussion **because** I care.
But apparently my opinion is not appreciated by some. Normally I would ignore that, but since some people abuse their powers and a free discussion is not appreciated, I will mute the entire server...
If you ask yourself why I am in this server: check back the support channels directly after the Komodo Agama hack!

That's the "root" of the issue I've pointed out 100 times, "gigapool" was only contested for a very specific reason and the only profit-switcher ever to be contested

I have no clue about his intentions when he wrote the process, just that he did write it and that it's an integral reason as to why there's any hashrate at a 60-some cent KMD price besides us die-hards

`why should code care about them at all? `
I can only point back to a comment I made a while back that you may or may not have seen (I forget when your role changed, so I'm not sure if you saw it or not):
The simplest answer is because we were told it did.
I came to Komodo because the #tradebots channel on slack was a misnomer.
I stayed because I thought I feked up my pool and node and couldn't figure out why it was telling me that my 3 br was 1200+
This was, at that time, a so often asked about thing that it was answered but in a way that was very much like "How do you not know this?"
That "added incentive", or "bonus", or whatever we call it in whatever context is most times the only thing that makes mining KMD not a straight loss (compared to mining any one of a dozen other chains) when you have any solid amount of hashpower.
tl:dr:
The code should care because we were told by the creator of the code that the code cares

miners get all the txfees. txfee is the sum of inputs - sum of outputs. rewards makes the inputs become larger, that is why you see negative txfee for rewards claims more than 0.0001

[04-Sep-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the sum of inputs (+ accrued rewards) is there, even if you spend it or not

[04-Sep-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont spend it, it becomes exactly like a larger than needed txfee, as that is what it is

[04-Sep-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
miners get the blockreward and all txfees

[04-Sep-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
this is pretty built into the protocol, so changing it is not as simple as you think it is and there could well be some bugs in the implementation

[04-Sep-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
all places that needs to know the sum of inputs value needs to now handle two cases, when it is spent and when it isnt spent
