Send to yourself for every two weeks or else use Agama claim button

[04-Sep-18 03:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or send to self

[04-Sep-18 03:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Basically the same

[04-Sep-18 03:41 PM] Farullalla Fashuk#6832
thx! so claiming means moving?

[04-Sep-18 03:42 PM] Farullalla Fashuk#6832
ok, got it. cheers

[04-Sep-18 04:29 PM] unquale#1948
we don't have assetchain channel anymore ?

[04-Sep-18 04:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@unquale which assetchain are you referring to? There is a whole subset of channels for ecosystem (3rd party) projects

[04-Sep-18 04:31 PM] unquale#1948
@Cryptoon  I want to build our own assetchain via komodo for #marmara

[04-Sep-18 04:33 PM] Nabob#5004
@unquale If you have any use case, discuss about your coin #ask-jl777 , here, Our developers will help you to advice further

[04-Sep-18 04:33 PM] unquale#1948
I was searching in the content of this channel, it's sad not to have it.

[04-Sep-18 04:33 PM] unquale#1948
Thank you @Nabob

[04-Sep-18 04:35 PM] Nabob#5004
Technically, on how  you want to create asset chains you can refer to Pinned items and gets some hands on.

i'm trying to download the DEX for OSX and I keep getting stuck around 72mb and then getting an download error

[04-Sep-18 06:21 PM] shak3nbak3#2279
anyone else have this issue?

[04-Sep-18 06:22 PM] TonyL#3577
@shak3nbak3 I had the same issue - think it's on GitHub side. Used iGetter multithread download manager app to struggle with this interruption

Hi, I'm trying barterdex for the first time. Apparently i need to enable etomic first if i want to exchange ethereum. When i want to do that i get the message "could not get etomic from faucet". Anyone who can help me out would be appreciated...

[05-Sep-18 02:57 AM] bart#6186
you mean i need to ask the question there?

[05-Sep-18 03:05 AM] bart#6186
ok thx

Guys have you all seen the KMD whale that‚Äôs been accumulating 6M KMD over the last few months?? ($9M investment)

[05-Sep-18 04:35 AM] Alecandro#1179
Makes me so excited

[05-Sep-18 05:10 AM] CHMEX#0686
Might be an exchange cold store

[05-Sep-18 05:11 AM] Alecandro#1179
Please explain

[05-Sep-18 05:17 AM] CHMEX#0686
The wallet never claimed rewards. All the transactions going to that address are smaller sized uxtos which looks like a wallet sweep on a exchange.

[05-Sep-18 05:20 AM] Alecandro#1179
Interesting.. so you do think it‚Äôs the same whale with the huge orders in the order book?

[05-Sep-18 05:21 AM] CHMEX#0686
No idea about that

Hi! Just wondering who do I contact regarding listing of a new coin (still in development, but should be ready for launch in the next coming weeks)

[05-Sep-18 02:23 PM] PTYX#6840
@danielkaye listing where? In hyperdex?

[05-Sep-18 02:50 PM] danielkaye#6246
@PTYX BarterDex

[05-Sep-18 02:51 PM] danielkaye#6246
What's Hyper (will google)

[05-Sep-18 02:51 PM] PTYX#6840
HyperDEX runs on BarterDEX core

[05-Sep-18 02:52 PM] PTYX#6840
think of barterdex as the motor and hyperdex as the new car body

Looks good, and is listing also decentralized ?

[05-Sep-18 03:08 PM] danielkaye#6246
On the phone but will read soon! Thanks

[05-Sep-18 03:15 PM] danielkaye#6246
@PTYX, is it's just a UI essentially ?

[05-Sep-18 03:16 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yes its just another UI. If you are listed on BarterDEX, it can be on both. Same core.

[05-Sep-18 03:17 PM] danielkaye#6246
I see, I was looking for a 'how to get listed'

[05-Sep-18 03:18 PM] danielkaye#6246
Or if anyone involved with that is online here

[05-Sep-18 03:18 PM] danielkaye#6246
Kinda defeats the idea of decentralization if you need to "get listed" doesn't it ?

[05-Sep-18 03:18 PM] danielkaye#6246
by, well,  a centralized authority üòÉ

[05-Sep-18 03:19 PM] xRobeSx#5136
You just need to add your coin to https://github.com/jl777/coins with a PR

and test that your coin works by swapping it

[05-Sep-18 03:19 PM] xRobeSx#5136
probably the second one first

[05-Sep-18 03:19 PM] danielkaye#6246
oh, and I just make a pull request on git ?

üëç 

[05-Sep-18 03:20 PM] xRobeSx#5136
once its merged into the coins repo, it will be available in barterdex

[05-Sep-18 03:21 PM] danielkaye#6246
interesting, thanks! Didn't see any of this on google

[05-Sep-18 03:29 PM] danielkaye#6246
How often are requests merged btw? any idea?

[05-Sep-18 03:31 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Usually as soon as they're there afaik. @cipi would be the best person to ask

[05-Sep-18 03:33 PM] Alright#0419
@danielkaye just curious, is the new coin an asset chain?

[05-Sep-18 03:40 PM] danielkaye#6246
@Alright nope, just a fork from pivx with some functions (related to file sharing)

[05-Sep-18 03:42 PM] Alright#0419
Not all that familiar with PIVX, but have you considered using an asset chain?

[05-Sep-18 03:42 PM] danielkaye#6246
I could look into it if it doesn't require some massive code base changes

[05-Sep-18 03:43 PM] danielkaye#6246
PIVX is a fork of DASH üòÉ

[05-Sep-18 03:43 PM] danielkaye#6246
RPC-wise same as BTC more or less

[05-Sep-18 03:44 PM] Alright#0419
What are you trying to accomplish with the coin?

[05-Sep-18 03:44 PM] Alright#0419
An asset chain would likely be easy to use, and it comes with a ton of benefits

[05-Sep-18 03:46 PM] Alright#0419
Does your fork have BIP65 activated?

[05-Sep-18 03:46 PM] Alright#0419
It's required for barterdex integration

[05-Sep-18 03:46 PM] xRobeSx#5136
dash is in barterdex and I think pivx is as well, so that shouldn't be an issue with barterdex

[05-Sep-18 03:47 PM] xRobeSx#5136
but I agree, assetchain is probably a better way to go

[05-Sep-18 03:47 PM] xRobeSx#5136
inherit all the great KMD features, including CryptoConditions

[05-Sep-18 03:48 PM] danielkaye#6246
I see, Komodo is forked from zcash

[05-Sep-18 03:48 PM] danielkaye#6246
but for the functions of our coin we need masternode and budget proposals (and superblocks)

[05-Sep-18 03:50 PM] Alright#0419
there's an existing smart contract that can emulate a MN rewards scheme

[05-Sep-18 03:50 PM] Alright#0419
No contract for budget proposals or superblocks, but I'm sure they would be possible to develop

[05-Sep-18 03:51 PM] Alright#0419
Can add any new smart contracts you might need later on also

[05-Sep-18 03:53 PM] Alright#0419
Alright, I'm done with my asset chain shill üòõ

is an explanation of komodo smart contracts and how someone might build on top of them

[05-Sep-18 03:55 PM] TonyL#3577
In general almost everything you can imagine can be built on CC smarts since they are Turing complete

[05-Sep-18 03:55 PM] danielkaye#6246
haha I'll take a look @Alright - thanks for the info (and shiling lol)

[05-Sep-18 03:56 PM] danielkaye#6246
@TonyL @Alright , could prolly do it but that would require a whole redesign of a lot of already done work

[05-Sep-18 03:59 PM] Ludom#5832
Someone here is in Lisboa?

[05-Sep-18 04:00 PM] Ludom#5832
If you are in Lisboa, could you pm me?

[05-Sep-18 05:18 PM] cipi#4502
@danielkaye please make sure your coin's wallet has BIP65 implemented (DASH has it, PIVX not)... `grep -Ri checklock *` in the source directory should show some results

[05-Sep-18 06:32 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
hi there, I remember there was a way when creating assetchains to avoid getting 0.000X coins created after ac_end=1 and with ac_reward=0

[05-Sep-18 06:32 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
mmm maybe ac_reward=0.0001 & ac_end=1 ??

[05-Sep-18 06:32 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
was it something like this?

[05-Sep-18 06:40 PM] Alright#0419
Sorry, not sure I understand the question

[05-Sep-18 06:40 PM] Alright#0419
what are you trying to accomplish? A chain with no block rewards?

[05-Sep-18 06:41 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
right

[05-Sep-18 06:41 PM] Alright#0419
just ac_end=1

[05-Sep-18 06:41 PM] Alright#0419
ac_reward can be anything

[05-Sep-18 06:41 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
mmm with ac_reward=0 it keeps adding coins every block

[05-Sep-18 06:41 PM] Alright#0419
do ac_reward=1?

[05-Sep-18 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
ac_reward of non-zero

[05-Sep-18 06:42 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
yes thats what I thought

[05-Sep-18 06:42 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
will try that thx

[05-Sep-18 06:43 PM] Alright#0419
@kimmel (Pungo.io) if you want on-demand blocks you can omit ac_reward entirely

[05-Sep-18 06:43 PM] Alright#0419
as in nodes will only mine blocks when there is a tx in the mempool

[05-Sep-18 07:55 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
done üòÉ thx

[05-Sep-18 08:16 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
mmm I created a new one with ac_reward=0.0001 and during first 128 blocks (still on it) it keeps adding coins

[05-Sep-18 08:17 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
will try without ac_reward...
