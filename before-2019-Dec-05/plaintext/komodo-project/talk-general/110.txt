Appreciated by those who have the knowledge and hated by those who stayed ignorant

[21-Oct-18 09:30 AM] forkwitch#6080
@Geocold51 Not much, been rewriting some part of the node stratum to be more efficient when testing 51wns. Lets you just set NUM val for the forklenght var and when external p2p feedbacks the equal forklength it will broadcast your found blocks again. Before it was manual handwork i believe you know... 
And Have you seen the CC in Komodo? Only thing i need to find out how to get all Komodo dpow chains notarisation information on one daemon where my cc is executed. Komodo RPC and my WAND RPC does not deliver this info. I believe the CC is a powerful and disruptive technology but so young and new. Not much of checks are added on CC lowlvl against attacks or bad intentioned data tampering.

[21-Oct-18 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, this is true

[21-Oct-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
even such basic things and making tx a bit differently could still have some issues

[21-Oct-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
i am most concerned with non-preservation of overall token balance

[21-Oct-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
https://komodostats.com/api/notary/summary.json <- api returns notarization lags

[21-Oct-18 09:36 AM] forkwitch#6080
As i am very interested in the CC i am reading and playing a lot and sharing all finding respecfully with you

[21-Oct-18 09:37 AM] forkwitch#6080
I have gotten the komodostats website. Thank you. It is executed on a webserver and we dont know from where the data source is.

[21-Oct-18 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
true, it is a trust required webpage. if you are running all the daemons, you can just do a getinfo and get the info from there

‚òë 

[21-Oct-18 09:50 AM] forkwitch#6080
This is the good decentralized solution. If i understand correct i can then use the oracle CC and create this trustfull source for all assetchain notarisation info that i looked for.

[21-Oct-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes!

[21-Oct-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
a chain that has all the notarization info from all the chains! that would be quite useful

[21-Oct-18 09:57 AM] forkwitch#6080
Then we found a good usecase for my chain. And free DPOW on it is exciting.

[21-Oct-18 09:59 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
what is a good usecase example for such chain?

[21-Oct-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
a decentralized source for current notarization status

[21-Oct-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
it can become a chain that has info on all the ecosystem coins or even outside it

[21-Oct-18 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe with price data, it can be like a CMC but fully decentralized

[21-Oct-18 10:01 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

@Gordon Komodo its a tool of blockchain security central, like notarisationarchive. You can get info of notarisation without running all daemons. Only one daemon. For example electrum server projects or projects with webwallets that dont use a full blockchain database copy can get all security information from this one p2p program!

@forkwitch  you can use the scannotarisationDB to get notarisetiong from KMD

[21-Oct-18 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its under crosschain or MoMoM

[21-Oct-18 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in the output of help

[21-Oct-18 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will return all notrarisations from all chains

[21-Oct-18 10:12 AM] forkwitch#6080
@blackjok3r is it stored into Komodo blockchain DB in realtime? The notarisation information of all DPOW tokens?

[21-Oct-18 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[21-Oct-18 10:12 AM] forkwitch#6080
If yes i can extract this alone with BCDB parse().

I added prints there to print out when each notarisation was added

[21-Oct-18 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can do whatever you want from there.

[21-Oct-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
still has a few issues, but the raw data is likely solid

[21-Oct-18 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
never seen it miss any

[21-Oct-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so just the MoMoM calc sometimes gets timing based offset

[21-Oct-18 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[21-Oct-18 10:17 AM] forkwitch#6080
I will parse through day worth of notarisation and check if all here. Will be thankful to get this as a rpc function for Komodo if data is available already @jl777c . getlastnotarisation 'COIN'; getnotarisationlag 'COIN' getnotarsationstatus 'TX'

[21-Oct-18 10:19 AM] forkwitch#6080
Can i get handy 24h notary statistic with notarisation counter for each dpow token somewhere?

[21-Oct-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
#notarynode has all the notary operators, which would be best place to ask about stats

[21-Oct-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be a good rpc to have, but I am not so good with DB so I prefer to wait for a pull request

[21-Oct-18 10:27 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Shit that was a good read JL. I quite like the end where they stats `If you‚Äôre working on crypto then you‚Äôre building the world of tomorrow but don‚Äôt expect it to arrive next week.`

[21-Oct-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why I say we are in a marathon

[21-Oct-18 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
also, a lot of the required aspects of the needed solution it seems the KMD approach is already doing

So true words, marathon and not a sprint.

[21-Oct-18 10:30 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I also made that connection. I like the way that person writes. The introduction had me hooked until the end

[21-Oct-18 10:49 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
what do you think about " I foresee many algorithmic methods to freeze, roll back and protect transactions, as well as ways to self-escrow money and recover stolen money. Think of them as automated versions of calling the bank and declaring a card stolen. Only systems that provide all the features of the old system plus brand new features achieve mass adoption." in the article?

[21-Oct-18 10:53 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Block manipulation(which is what they're hinting at) is an interesting topic. It goes against the whole point of blockchain imo

[21-Oct-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
I can see CC implementing some sort of conditional payment, where it isnt final until some reasonable time window is passed

[21-Oct-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
this actually wont be very hard to implement at all

[21-Oct-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
now the receiving side would just need to wait for this amount of time to be sure it wont be cancelled, so like having to wait 1000 confirmations

[21-Oct-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe some places will need the business bad enough they would accept this
