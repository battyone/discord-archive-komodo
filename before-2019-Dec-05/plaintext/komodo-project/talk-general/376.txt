No it depends on our capacity to destroy the planet

[23-Jun-19 08:37 PM] nocturnal#2177
lol

[23-Jun-19 08:38 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lol sit and occupy has never been the us strong suit,  it is against the art of war, to occupy you need to have the backing of the locals or else it‚Äôs just insurgent attacks all day

[23-Jun-19 08:39 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Deleted User  worked well in Japan

If you all want a gun in you pocket, be my guest (well, not literally), but nuclear disarmament wouldn't be such a bad idea.

[23-Jun-19 08:39 PM] nocturnal#2177
out of genuine curiousity

[23-Jun-19 08:39 PM] nocturnal#2177
is americas capacity to destroy the planet somthing you feel proud about?

[23-Jun-19 08:40 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Of course,  it‚Äôs the ultimate deterrent

[23-Jun-19 08:40 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
We can share

[23-Jun-19 08:41 PM] Duck Tape#9059
True. It's a paradox: the more countries own nukes, the less likely it becomes nuclear war will break out.

[23-Jun-19 08:41 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The point of deterrence is that all sides do t want the bad outcome. So will figure a way to go along and get along

[23-Jun-19 08:42 PM] nocturnal#2177
suppose the 'point of deterence' is a grim reality of our situation. Thats grim. but something to proud of?

[23-Jun-19 08:43 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Almost a hundred years and we haven‚Äôt wiped ourselves out yet ,  yes seems good

Not quite, I don‚Äôt advocate for war,  rather the opposite, isolationism.

[23-Jun-19 08:44 PM] nocturnal#2177
good luck with that

[23-Jun-19 08:44 PM] nocturnal#2177
but you like crypto?

[23-Jun-19 08:44 PM] nocturnal#2177
a brderless currency that doesnt see nations?

[23-Jun-19 08:44 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Free trade is fine

[23-Jun-19 08:45 PM] nocturnal#2177
so how would you like to be islolated?

[23-Jun-19 08:45 PM] nocturnal#2177

To keep all those nukes safe must cost us so much. Security, security, security. Maybe our obsession with security is born out of our possosion and fear of nukes.

Bitcoin doesn't care for borders, crypto doesn't care.

[23-Jun-19 08:45 PM] actionslacks#4072
perhaps the lack of contact from any alien advanced civilization is due to them always destroying themselves sooner or later.

[23-Jun-19 08:45 PM] nocturnal#2177
yea man, the wrld has moved past isolationism

[23-Jun-19 08:46 PM] nocturnal#2177
for better or worse

[23-Jun-19 08:46 PM] nocturnal#2177
the arguement moved on

[23-Jun-19 08:46 PM] nocturnal#2177

South Korea needs guarding? There were mass protests in South Korea against US military presence

[23-Jun-19 08:51 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I lived and worked in South Korea for a couple years at a few nuclear sites one decent yield bombing run would render the entire southern half of South Korea a radioactive wasteland.

[23-Jun-19 08:51 PM] nocturnal#2177
wow

[23-Jun-19 08:51 PM] nocturnal#2177
that would be cool wouldnt it.............

[23-Jun-19 08:51 PM] Duck Tape#9059
@Deleted User  " One that totally disables nuclear weapons in a determined area." Why a determined area? Why not just all of them?

[23-Jun-19 08:51 PM] nocturnal#2177
tht would make you so proud üòÇ

[23-Jun-19 08:51 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And the north historically has invaded the south, all the way to the furthest point Busan

[23-Jun-19 08:52 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@nocturnal  you want it both ways, you want us protection but you don‚Äôt want us involvement

[23-Jun-19 08:52 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Doesn‚Äôt work like that

i do like a lot of american music film and art. so props for that

[23-Jun-19 08:55 PM] Duck Tape#9059
Yeah, americans do produce nice stuff sometimes.

[23-Jun-19 08:59 PM] actionslacks#4072
the imitation of the american lifestyle and model of building cities is what is destroying the environment

[23-Jun-19 09:00 PM] JimD#9272
Our cities are filled with gang bangers and criminals.  No one wants to raise their famlies  around city centers

[23-Jun-19 09:00 PM] actionslacks#4072
everyone in the world wants to drive a car though

[23-Jun-19 09:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Tesla

[23-Jun-19 09:02 PM] yorklab#7270
@polycryptoblog I agree with all your statements. Like Microsoft and Google, the US is the 800 lb gorilla that everyone loves to hate. I would rather the US be the main power in the world than China, Russia, North Korea, etc. I too was stationed in South Korea in a classified capacity and I can tell you that the North has one singular goal in mind and that's to take back the south; they would attack in a second if they had the chance.

[23-Jun-19 09:03 PM] actionslacks#4072
mostly talking about china building out a suburban hellscape of ghost cities

[23-Jun-19 09:05 PM] actionslacks#4072
the deveopment of suburban area in the usa is icredibly generic and soul crushing as well though

[23-Jun-19 09:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@yorklab  both of my grandfathers served in the Korean War , and when I was over there , I would say 90% of the people were pro American

[23-Jun-19 09:07 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Had some folks who didn‚Äôt like it but not too many

[23-Jun-19 09:07 PM] actionslacks#4072
we do habe some amazing national parks and the formerlly gritty urban city centers are getting gentrified and turned into overpriced hipster utopias

[23-Jun-19 09:08 PM] yorklab#7270
I was there probably before some here were born, but back then most were very pro American. I couldn't tell you what they may think now though.

[23-Jun-19 09:11 PM] yorklab#7270
There is no perfect government/country/place, but even if there was somebody will still complain. Just human nature.

[23-Jun-19 09:12 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The Us is far from perfect , no argument here

[23-Jun-19 09:13 PM] JimD#9272
The liberals told me Denmark was the happiest country on earth and america should emulate them

i dont even have medical insurance anymore. it's such a scam now that 10x cheaper to pay cash

[23-Jun-19 09:21 PM] JimD#9272
I started using HSA after co-worker had a premature baby which incurred massive costs and made everyones insurance go up

[23-Jun-19 09:22 PM] JimD#9272
I eat right and exercise too so I don't wanna pay for some fat bastards insulin because he sits on the couch eating doritos all day

what a racket

[23-Jun-19 09:26 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The health care system needs massive rework ,  personally think it requires deregulation.  The insulin example is a good one,  with deregulation it will allow more competition and drive prices down

[23-Jun-19 09:27 PM] JimD#9272
It could tons of people won't be covered and that will be used by dems to try and get votes

[23-Jun-19 09:27 PM] JimD#9272
all those who work for a living will be better off though

[23-Jun-19 09:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
it's a race to the bottom, i.e. communism. no one wants to be a doctor anymore because of the massive debt you incur

[23-Jun-19 09:28 PM] actionslacks#4072
consolidation and control

[23-Jun-19 09:28 PM] JimD#9272
Yup, I don't really want the government controlling healthcare

[23-Jun-19 09:29 PM] JimD#9272
Big pharma probably needs to be put up against the wall for the opioid issue though

[23-Jun-19 09:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Definitely  they prescribe them for every damn thing, when it should be treated as an option for only bad cases

[23-Jun-19 09:34 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, its a tough issue.  Some people are really in pain and need it but most probably do not, maybe only prescribe it in a hospital.

[23-Jun-19 09:35 PM] actionslacks#4072
it's essentially a genocide

[23-Jun-19 09:36 PM] actionslacks#4072
tens of thousands a year
