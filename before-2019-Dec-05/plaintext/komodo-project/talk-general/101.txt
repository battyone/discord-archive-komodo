I have "a few"

[15-Oct-18 10:29 PM] SHossain#0007
of course not a concern for you 😄

[15-Oct-18 10:29 PM] SHossain#0007
unless you want to mine using CPU, Ryzen 1950x is not much recommended

[15-Oct-18 10:29 PM] Llama#1330
do I... 
a. buy new individual pieces for my PC
b. buy a pre-built pc to avoid the mess

[15-Oct-18 10:30 PM] SHossain#0007
a

[15-Oct-18 10:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
always a

[15-Oct-18 10:30 PM] SHossain#0007
if you know what you are doing

[15-Oct-18 10:30 PM] Llama#1330
honestly I'd be replacing everything

[15-Oct-18 10:30 PM] Llama#1330
so might as well buy a bundle thing and put it together?

[15-Oct-18 10:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`unless you want to mine using CPU, Ryzen 1950x is not much recommended`
It's for my personal rig, but mining is a consideration, and that's why I was looking at the 32 to begin with

[15-Oct-18 10:32 PM] SHossain#0007
get an i9-9900k instead. gonna be nice

[15-Oct-18 10:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Llama unless the "bundle" really includes exactly what you want, always double check pricing and see if there's any real "savings" over what you really want

[15-Oct-18 10:32 PM] Llama#1330
yeah

[15-Oct-18 10:33 PM] Llama#1330
rtx or gtx...?

[15-Oct-18 10:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`get an i9-9900k instead. gonna be nice`
I've always had horrible luck with gen1 chips

[15-Oct-18 10:34 PM] SHossain#0007
that's gen 9 :trollface:

[15-Oct-18 10:34 PM] SHossain#0007
never buy HDD anymore

[15-Oct-18 10:34 PM] SHossain#0007
no point

[15-Oct-18 10:34 PM] SHossain#0007
unless you don't care about your time

[15-Oct-18 10:35 PM] Llama#1330
hdd for important things

[15-Oct-18 10:35 PM] SHossain#0007
4TB HDD are under $100

[15-Oct-18 10:35 PM] SHossain#0007
but, i paid about $3000 for a 750GB SSD

[15-Oct-18 10:36 PM] SHossain#0007
That's a lot of RAM. what you gonna do with all that RAM?

[15-Oct-18 10:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Technically, yes they are "gen 9", but "Core Stepping 0" = "gen 1" in my little mind

Why would one want to use native mode over lite mode in agama?

[16-Oct-18 01:36 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
If you didn't want to download the whole blockchain to your computer 😃

[16-Oct-18 01:41 AM] Hermes#6934
Native mode enables Z transactions to be performed with KMD

[16-Oct-18 01:41 AM] Hermes#6934
This is key for privacy

Here is a small article talking about this, native mode also helps and et the end is good for  the network which is in the end is good for all users.

[16-Oct-18 01:53 AM] DingDongSoLong#0148
Right on! And thanks for the article

[16-Oct-18 02:00 AM] Hermes#6934
Will expand on this article tomorrow there are many reasons why Native and Lite mode have different advantages

Hello sir. Are you interested on buying lbank votes? I can provide you 700-1000votes a day.

[16-Oct-18 05:03 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Can we tempt in selling you some Komodo instead?

[16-Oct-18 05:04 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I understand you don't have any, and that isn't the wisest move. I'd recommend buying some immediately.

[16-Oct-18 05:09 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It must be your lucky day, we happen to have a special on that only happens once in seven blue moons! Today, you can pick yourself up not 3 not 2, but 1 komodo, all for the price of 4!

Im new to Komodo, what is the best way to get involved with Komodo?

[16-Oct-18 10:41 AM] dokrates#8987
I want to know about Komodo, technology, where to get recent improvements, roadmap, projection, etc

[16-Oct-18 10:41 AM] dokrates#8987
i've been googling and im very interested in this project

[16-Oct-18 10:43 AM] dokrates#8987
I saw komodo have been done many parts of the technology, while others are still developing, like: atomic swaps, dex, side chains, token creation, etc...

[16-Oct-18 10:45 AM] BlockTech#6895
Indeed, they are far beyond with technology than most of other blockchain project. Someone will come and help you with those sources, just not me, wait a few minutes 😄

[16-Oct-18 10:46 AM] dokrates#8987
I just want something to start, i checked ANN, starting to follow komodo in twitter, also checked komodoplatform.com

im gonna keep all of this links and check one by one

[16-Oct-18 10:59 AM] dokrates#8987
I also saw komodo was the first in commits in 2017

[16-Oct-18 10:59 AM] dokrates#8987
but i checked their commits in past months and they are almost 0

[16-Oct-18 10:59 AM] dokrates#8987
it means the product is completely ready?

[16-Oct-18 11:00 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
Komodo uses many repositories and Cryptomiso only tracks one that is sparsely used, the real commits are at least 100x than tracked there

[16-Oct-18 11:00 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I wonder if it's better to ask to delist it from the website rather than give misleading info

[16-Oct-18 11:01 AM] dokrates#8987
ah nice
