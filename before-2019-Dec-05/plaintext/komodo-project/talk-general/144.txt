that would be an entirely pointless adventure imo

[07-Dec-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CSW was arrested and stormed by Police in Australia after announcing he was Satoshi... We must remember this. They put guns to his head.

[07-Dec-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or it was all made up. üòÑ

[07-Dec-18 01:45 AM] actionslacks#4072
The fact that just saying that you are satoshi merits that kind of response reveals how threatened govt‚Äôs feel by this tech.

[07-Dec-18 01:47 AM] actionslacks#4072
Or rather the cartels in control of said govt‚Äôs

Love all the shit coin spammers from this shit coin

[07-Dec-18 01:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
What shitcoin? Chainlink?

[07-Dec-18 02:18 AM] actionslacks#4072
It could have been just that, a scene from a play in the theatre. The further along this gets the less sense it all makes.

[07-Dec-18 02:21 AM] PTYX#6840
We can't deny he was involved in the beginning though

[07-Dec-18 02:30 AM] PTYX#6840
yes

[07-Dec-18 02:33 AM] PTYX#6840
he is using @ch6ris username

[07-Dec-18 02:33 AM] PTYX#6840
when i block him, it blocks ch6ris instead

[07-Dec-18 02:33 AM] PTYX#6840
not sure how that is happening.

[07-Dec-18 02:33 AM] ch6ris#5240
I'm really confused. I got the message from @Deleted User

it's probably just some new loophole

Good morning to everyone, someone can explain me if he can what is the story with Corda(R3) many banks are using  and where komodo is better than them if few words,We can see massive influx of companies, corporations, financial institutions and governments trying using Blockchain technology but none of what we know or just build by some private companies where general people doesn't have access,

[07-Dec-18 10:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
Looks like a private, permissioned database system that is not publicly mineable, has no blockchain or proof of work mechanism. Sql with utxo‚Äôs or something.

Unfortunately the company's doesn't care all this is all about to reduce the cost and the company to affiliate them name with the brand named Blockchain

Just bought http://amzn.eu/d/eokBl1W second monitor for my laptop - gonna get some serious productivity increase now lads!

[07-Dec-18 01:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
why so small though

[07-Dec-18 02:21 PM] benohanlon#1119
@Deleted User @Cryptoon cos I want my gear to be portable. So value portability over size.

[07-Dec-18 02:29 PM] benohanlon#1119
You know the idea of EDC (every day carry) being able to get it all into a rucksack.

[07-Dec-18 02:30 PM] PTYX#6840
Let me know how is the quality

[07-Dec-18 02:47 PM] benohanlon#1119
actually it was recommended by @MaJoRa who is a GUI dev that came on the Wales trip and a good friend of mine. He has all kinds of cool stuff.

[07-Dec-18 02:47 PM] benohanlon#1119
@MaJoRa is still a virgin to this blockchain thing... so we need to get him involved üòÑ

[07-Dec-18 02:48 PM] benohanlon#1119
he worked on some very well known projects

[07-Dec-18 02:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
fair enough @benohanlon :p

[07-Dec-18 02:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I just have multiple workspaces, one at the office with 2x 24" and one at home with one 28" monitor

[07-Dec-18 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
combined with the macbook pro screen it's more than enough, and cant really imagine myself with a multi screen setup on an airplane or so üòÑ

[07-Dec-18 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So portable secondary screen isnt really necessary for me

[07-Dec-18 02:58 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
If I had 6 13" monitors and I turned them all portrait and screened them in pairs, I might be able to function like that...

[07-Dec-18 03:01 PM] benohanlon#1119
this is @MaJoRa's set-up

`or why are the screens tilted like that`
if you're looking down, the you tilt the top back
if you're looking up then you tilt the bottom back

all the corporate blockchain projects are missing the point and willfully ignoring the real scaling, security and societal benefits of an universally accessible and mineable blockchain protocol.  While these permissioned projects may be profitable and technologically sophisticated, they are not the competition. they aren't even on the same playing field.

Doesn‚Äôt matter whether they are right or wrong @actionslacks ... tried and proofed results having pole position is their intention. Simply no way they can compete with grass roots, but sheep be sheep. Our job is to educate the sheep to see the wolf

[08-Dec-18 09:18 AM] actionslacks#4072
they're just trying to capitalize on what's trending. It's kinda like all the exchanges that end up taking everyone's money. it never ends. and it never will with centralized systems. bitcoin is crashing but it still works. no one can just arbitrarily turn the lights off and wipe everyone out. cold comfort but thats the difference to me anyway.

[08-Dec-18 02:09 PM] PTYX#6840
@actionslacks at this point in time, services like AWS managed blockchains have certainly become the competition.

[08-Dec-18 02:10 PM] PTYX#6840
Regarding scaling, I don't think they will have problems scaling. There are corporate solutions on permission and public blockchains.

@Acura can you get a hold of the author and tell him about custom CC? the new consensus rules can be added to a custom CC to implement what he talks about. it would be tricky, but at least a lot of the work of making a blockchain is already in place and gradually more and more can be moved into the coda

[09-Dec-18 01:59 PM] Alright#0419
Is there any practical benefit of ZK-sync over SPV?

[09-Dec-18 02:00 PM] Alright#0419
Also, who accepts 0conf transactions? That's hardly a "double spend"

[09-Dec-18 02:13 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
my understanding is that with Zk-synch you don't need SPV servers anymore

[09-Dec-18 02:26 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Acura I wrote a reply too and upvoted yours

[09-Dec-18 02:30 PM] Alright#0419
@KomodoWorld I *kind of* understand what it is, but I'm wondering from a user's perspective if it's any different than SPV
