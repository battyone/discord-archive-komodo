`fair distribution of POS tokens` is an oxymoron

[09-Oct-18 06:48 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
why fair = value ?

[09-Oct-18 06:48 AM] IP#9768
you invest in equipment and electricity and get tokens. with pos someone just gets the token out of thin air

[09-Oct-18 06:48 AM] IP#9768
token distribution matters a lot

[09-Oct-18 06:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`pow is much more fair in distributing tokens`
Said everyone who never purchase a building full of miners and had to pay the power bill

[09-Oct-18 06:49 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
what is the difference in just direct buying gold then to byuing aquipment to get gold? some % of fee?

[09-Oct-18 06:49 AM] IP#9768
people seem to not find value in coins where they think distribution is very much infair

[09-Oct-18 06:49 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
meaningless

[09-Oct-18 06:49 AM] IP#9768
hard to find value in xrp tokens..

[09-Oct-18 06:49 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
well so you just pointed to what people find fair / unfair and as I explained above it's uselss ./ undefined

[09-Oct-18 06:49 AM] IP#9768
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 someone mined that gold and did not print it out of thin air, right

[09-Oct-18 06:50 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
all ocmes to the same point of what people think

[09-Oct-18 06:50 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
you pay the price anyway

[09-Oct-18 06:50 AM] IP#9768
so with gold it is fine to get it either way

[09-Oct-18 06:50 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and distrivbution is not fair - early adopters get more

[09-Oct-18 06:50 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
forget about fair

[09-Oct-18 06:50 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
illusion

[09-Oct-18 06:50 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
gold you min, BTC you also mine

[09-Oct-18 06:50 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
same thing

[09-Oct-18 06:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`early adopters get more`
To that extent, PoS and PoW are pretty much even

[09-Oct-18 06:53 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so it is totally unfair distribution - fair would be when late adopters get same? but here also inflation comes ... and people who do not get it will say this year 103 is > last year 100

[09-Oct-18 06:54 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or there can be also deflation 😃

[09-Oct-18 06:54 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
in terms of USD you get same amount of BTC though so you can same it's "fair"

[09-Oct-18 06:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
distribution of currency will never be "fair" except in some Utopia where unicorns shit rainbows

[09-Oct-18 06:55 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
because fairness does not exist - everyone think fairs is when it's better for them

[09-Oct-18 06:55 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
mathmeticaly when it's fair does not mean people will take it as that

[09-Oct-18 06:55 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
for me it's enough if it seems it make sense and margins not too high

[09-Oct-18 06:57 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ultimately fairness is and idea which is sometimes used by populists :trollface:  to make the world better, but how it ends you know :realpirate:

[09-Oct-18 06:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Even the shittiest of GPUs mining a young BTC in the early days would make you wealthy selling today

[09-Oct-18 06:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Now, $100k and you *might* bank $60k profit

[09-Oct-18 07:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Can recommend this dude's book if you're interested in questions of inequality (applicable partially to crypto-economics as well)

The Organized Mind
Daniel J. Levitin's latest book: The Organized Mind

[09-Oct-18 07:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@TonyL Does that book tell folks that "If you're living 'paycheck to paycheck' then you're **not** in the *middle-class*"?
imo, the majority of people that speak on wanting "economic equality" and "fairness" need that drilled into their head before they can even accept any logic

[09-Oct-18 07:07 AM] TonyL#3577
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 It's historical research on reason of inequity of capitals accumulating in different countries. And main thesis is that inequity is necessary for capitalism. Not sure what did you ask

[09-Oct-18 07:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There seems to be an epidemic of people in the US and EU (more so in the US) that drone one about inequality being a thing that needs "fixed". The worsening part of that seems to come from "working class poor" who are under the delusion that they are "middle class".

[09-Oct-18 07:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, I see. Can't argue on this mater objectively since never lived in EU or USA and have a degree in nuclear physics, not economics 😃

Any economic theory based on the infinite supply model is inherently flawed imo

Equality to the equal , inequality to the unequal

I've started masters in field of cancer treatment by particles accelerators and so on. What demotivated me totally: there were some dudes in my class which already work in hospitals, treat people from cancer and have salary 300-400 usd/month

[09-Oct-18 01:56 PM] plazma#1625
can komodo use zk-snark shielded transaction in mobile wallets or is it only full node wallets....

[09-Oct-18 02:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I believe mobile will only come after sapling updates because of CPU usage

[09-Oct-18 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
currently z transactions are very CPU intensive

[09-Oct-18 02:09 PM] BitDaddy#1453
Is this   v0.3.13c  the latest agama wallet. Does it support pirate chain and chainzilla.

[09-Oct-18 02:18 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
latest on website is 0.2.41d

[09-Oct-18 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Never head of a 0.3 is that a VRSC version?

[09-Oct-18 02:21 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes 0.3.13c is the Verus Agama, it supports Kmd too

[09-Oct-18 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh the fun bits of decentralization 😛

[09-Oct-18 02:24 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@BitDaddy for Pirate you have to use the Kmd Agama

[09-Oct-18 02:24 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
chainzilla is supported in both

[09-Oct-18 02:30 PM] BitDaddy#1453
So I have version 0.2.42c installed  just now but recently downloaded a verus wallet which I noticed is v 0.3.13c. If I install this verus wallet will it uninstall my agama 0.2.42c.

[09-Oct-18 02:38 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Verus is standalone, doesn't install and won't do anything to Komodo Agama

[09-Oct-18 02:38 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I'm using Verus on the same computer with Kmd Agama

[09-Oct-18 02:38 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
and can access my kmd with either

[09-Oct-18 02:39 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I mean I use one or the other, not at the same time

[09-Oct-18 02:40 PM] BitDaddy#1453
Thanks for clearing that up. 👍

[09-Oct-18 04:30 PM] Mörökölli (Boogeyman)#8765
will verus be on the kmd agama wallet or is it only going to be on their agama?

[09-Oct-18 04:32 PM] Mörökölli (Boogeyman)#8765
just confused about the two agamas :d

so my friend has ubuntu on his laptop which i guess is a linix thing. We did all the code up to cd ~
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo
cd komodo
git checkout dev
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh. How do you go down lines like that on ubuntu. It won't let us copy and paste either

[09-Oct-18 07:12 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to follow the guide and issue the  commands 1 line each time after installing all dependencies
