[17-Sep-18 07:12 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
a general question (maybe stupid) - can dex be transformed to allow also no-crypto trades (regular market) meaning I could sell car, music, anything ?

[17-Sep-18 07:13 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
seems to me that those guys trying to make a marketplace are actually missing the most important trades in crypto - trading crypto:crypto

[17-Sep-18 07:13 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but here since the crypto:crypto trades are - maybe make sense to extend the app to make "just any trades"

[17-Sep-18 07:13 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@PTYX ?

[17-Sep-18 07:14 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
a decentralized marketplace ?

[17-Sep-18 07:14 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
reputation points needed for sure, and a search engine ?

[17-Sep-18 07:15 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
plus some "gui changes" 😃

[17-Sep-18 07:15 AM] TonyL#3577
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 at first you have to tokenise your item I guess

[17-Sep-18 07:15 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@TonyL I think to sell a car and make it safe transaction only a escrow kind is needed or blocking funds untill transaction is confirmed

[17-Sep-18 07:16 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so that funds will be accessible by neither of sides if someone cheating

[17-Sep-18 07:17 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
+ actually tere could be trades of services and ann's like "Freelance devs

[17-Sep-18 07:17 AM] TonyL#3577
It's a oracle question mostly as I think

[17-Sep-18 07:17 AM] TonyL#3577
If you trade crypto:crypto on DEX it's possible to proof that both parties have crypto and   lock it

[17-Sep-18 07:18 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
why I'm asking is part is already doen as dex must use gui, and have user acccount, so addind the other parts like reputations and search engine could make it

[17-Sep-18 07:18 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
half way there

[17-Sep-18 07:18 AM] TonyL#3577
But in case of some real - oracle have to proof that you really have it, that you really have full rights on it, that you'll really give it after trade

[17-Sep-18 07:18 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Working on something like this with barter exchange,  unfortunately will have to necessarily be centralized ,  legal issues... but it because it is centralized it allows for legal claims against offending parties .

[17-Sep-18 07:19 AM] TonyL#3577
In future if data on blockchain will have legal power I think it's possible to implement it on CC  - CC sale contract, oracle checking your rights on property in government bases or smth like this

[17-Sep-18 07:20 AM] TonyL#3577
If someone paying crypto - agreement data singing in oracle CC

[17-Sep-18 07:21 AM] TonyL#3577
But needs arbitrary system as well and a lot of stuff )

[17-Sep-18 07:23 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@polycryptoblog  great news! how advances are you with that?

[17-Sep-18 07:23 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@TonyL when selling a car you still need to pass the papars of ownership and so on...

[17-Sep-18 07:23 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
digital goods hardest to escrow

[17-Sep-18 07:24 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@polycryptoblog  what will be the central part? meaning it will noe be a p2p app ?

[17-Sep-18 07:24 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I still believe it can be full decentralized

[17-Sep-18 07:25 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
just like p2p file sharing, just anybody can do it with no control

[17-Sep-18 07:25 AM] TonyL#3577
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 Identification on blockchain, governement documents bases on blockchain and that's it 😃

[17-Sep-18 07:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe in 2050

[17-Sep-18 07:26 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
in decentralize there can be some issues but sghould be solved by community around it, like if someone will be selling sth dangerous or harming other people - community should make some actions to tag such content and make it somehow hard to trade or even ban (by voting?)

[17-Sep-18 07:31 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It's coming along.  Mining farm almost ready just waiting on power company.   Been doing a lot of reading and competitive analysis to try and make a viable economic system .    It is a p2p system however the record keeper is the one who adjusts the account balances not the participants in the trade.   Example:  somebody wants to barter access to your password app.   They would contact the exchange who would broker the deal with you,  your account would be credited and their account debited.  Contrast with normal crypto transaction of the payment variety.   The big benefit of the barter exchange system is that in the example the exchange is done on credit where in traditional crypto payments requires the party to have the crypto at the time ( necessary double coincidence )

[17-Sep-18 07:39 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
is that done for speed purpose (3rd party record keeper)?

[17-Sep-18 07:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No,  for legal purposes.  It would be more speedy to allow people to do the tx themselves,  however there is no way around MSB laws if you allow that.  The secret sauce of the barter exchange is that there is no money per se, just accouting units in a ledger ,  that's how they have been getting around FinCEN and licensing.

[17-Sep-18 07:42 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Legally barter exchange has to file 1099B in aggregate tx  for businesses that are part of it and for each transaction for nonbusinesses

[17-Sep-18 07:42 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I dont get still why you need to make it "legal". To make money on it? Wouldn't be enough to use recent JL invetion - CC - to have a special token which gives you some small fee on every trade? This way full decentralized and if someone cheating: 1. his money will be blocked anyway by escrow system 2. he will get bad or no reputation. What may be hard is some identity and reputation system might be required so that less people will be cheated

[17-Sep-18 07:43 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
What is MSB? How they can block p2p system ?

[17-Sep-18 07:44 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
you operate in US ?

[17-Sep-18 07:44 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The point of making it legal is for real adoption.  To tie in noncrypto businesses with crypto .  MSB is money services business.  Yes I'm in the US.

[17-Sep-18 07:45 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok I guess for professional traders there are some obligations and if they not fullfill it (cause of system) they will not use it ?

[17-Sep-18 07:45 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No,  the exchange would be liable and that's prison time

[17-Sep-18 07:46 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but then it could work 2 ways: professional sellers using 3rd party, single users wanting to be full anon - using no rd party

[17-Sep-18 07:46 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok Dont want to loose your time, I would need to understand much more to get it 😃

[17-Sep-18 07:47 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
hope you make it

[17-Sep-18 07:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
you have to report all transactions of single users,  which is a pain but blockchain makes that easier , can just pull the Json from explorer to spreadsheet and upload to the accounting software.   Here is a link to some more info on barter exchanges. https://beyondmoney.net/monographs/commercial-trade-exchanges-their-present-limitations-and-potential-future/   Blockchain is perfect to revolutionize this industry.

Hi, 
I'd like to send out a big thank you to the many people who have been helping me here over the last few months.
The kindness that's been shown and selfless help that has been given to me was unexpected.  This is how the world is supposed to be.  I'd forgotten that.
Thanks to your support I've gone from an absolute and total noob to a total noob who has his own chain for testing.
It's quite inspiring to watch all of you you do your part in advancing this technology and making it so accessible
Keep up the great work!    :abusedsmily:

Dont forget your chain is notarized 😄

[17-Sep-18 10:33 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, yeah, it has been a good day 😃

How is everyones 💼 looking today?

[17-Sep-18 04:20 PM] nii236#2759
So the orderbooks seem pretty thin on HyperDEX, yet comments and marketing around the internet suggest over 100,000 trades. Where are they?

[17-Sep-18 04:23 PM] snowdamn#2414
100k overall trades, not average daily Volume

[17-Sep-18 04:25 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
there were peaks of 50k - 100k usd volume a few months ago

[17-Sep-18 04:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and tbh, most of those trades were on BarterDEX GUI and not HyperDEX GUI

[17-Sep-18 06:11 PM] dan.#2473
A few months ago there was a poll somewhere asking how many ACs by the end of 2018 (< 100 or > 100) It seems KMD has currently about ~50 including James' ACs?

[17-Sep-18 06:21 PM] Alright#0419
There are currently 35 notarized asset chains, which doesn't include CHIPS or GAME

[17-Sep-18 06:21 PM] Alright#0419
but I can think of about another 10 chains that are not yet notarized

[17-Sep-18 06:23 PM] dan.#2473
Getting close then

[17-Sep-18 06:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`including James' ACs`? 🤔

[17-Sep-18 06:26 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@dan. I think it was me, but I can't find the thread on bitcointalk, it was Komodo speculation or something

[17-Sep-18 06:27 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
oh I found it

[17-Sep-18 06:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright After the events of the weekend, I'm assuming that CALL is not notarized?

[17-Sep-18 06:31 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
hi there, we would like to start testing our fiat gateway for some currencies in South America (Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia) in its local currencies and also CNY for china. It would be interesting to contact people whom could sell some small amounts of KMD/BTC who has local accounts in order to check how it goes. We would add some bonus to sold amounts. Contact me in case you would like to participate! thx!

[17-Sep-18 06:33 PM] dan.#2473
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 there's gotta be more than one, right? 😄

[17-Sep-18 06:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dan. I'm certain there's more than 1 chain, but was specifically curious about that one

[17-Sep-18 06:38 PM] dan.#2473
And soon EMC2

[17-Sep-18 06:39 PM] dan.#2473
i sense a snowball effect coming from external chains wanting to notarize

[17-Sep-18 06:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dan. yes, I was also curious as to what you meant by that ("James'")

[17-Sep-18 06:46 PM] dan.#2473
i was trying to be funny and say there must be many James cause of his coding output. but the joke failed

@KomodoWorld 
> there were peaks of 50k - 100k usd volume a few months ago

Why the huge drop in volume since then? Its almost empty from what I can tell

[18-Sep-18 01:46 AM] nii236#2759
Does KMD sit between all atomic swaps? Or does BTC -> BCH do a direct swap somehow? I'm seeing conflicting information

[18-Sep-18 02:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
BTC to bch direct swap

[18-Sep-18 02:22 AM] farsider350#7618
Anyone use BarterDEX?

[18-Sep-18 03:01 AM] nii236#2759
i tried, but no one was on there

[18-Sep-18 03:01 AM] nii236#2759
plus the UI pales compared to hyperDex

[18-Sep-18 03:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes,  low liquidity now,  improvements in both GUI and market maker are in the works

[18-Sep-18 03:01 AM] nii236#2759
I wish the HyperDEX strategy was a lot clearer. What's happening with BarterDEX? Why are there two GUIs?

[18-Sep-18 03:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Hyperdex and BarterDEX are the same core , just different guis

[18-Sep-18 03:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
BarterDEX was just the first implementation,  hyperdex is a third party project

[18-Sep-18 03:03 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Coincollect will be another implementation and I'm sure more will come in the future

[18-Sep-18 03:03 AM] nii236#2759
Yet the core is in the BarterDEX repo, correct? Its not decoupled from the the BarterDEX GUI

[18-Sep-18 03:05 AM] nii236#2759
Might be worth separating the repo

[18-Sep-18 03:06 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Up to the devs how they want to do it.

[18-Sep-18 03:06 AM] nii236#2759
Yeah fair enough
