Great question! The "legacy" colors are the older logos that Komodo has traditionally used, like the logo

and this shade of green are the "legacy" colors

[25-Sep-18 02:59 PM] Daniel CP#2020
If you have a look at some of the more recent images we've used as banner images on blog posts, they use a darker blue/green color and a light mint green as an accent color

[25-Sep-18 03:00 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Here are a few examples:

By colours composition I mean

[25-Sep-18 03:02 PM] Daniel CP#2020
^we'd like the infographics to be more aligned with these new colors

[25-Sep-18 03:03 PM] Daniel CP#2020
yeah @TonyL ! The light mint green is pretty much an exact match

[25-Sep-18 03:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Looks dope üëç

[25-Sep-18 03:29 PM] mato121#5963
any pirate coins left ? üòÑ

[25-Sep-18 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
190 million or so left

[25-Sep-18 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
to be mined

[25-Sep-18 03:37 PM] shnu#0359
Why PIRATE coin?

[25-Sep-18 03:39 PM] shnu#0359
Sorry to ask..why do we need a PIRATE coin?
Is it good to have these sub-coins for the value of KMD?

[25-Sep-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
is it good for the ecosystem to have a coin that is much more private than XMR that is secured by bitcoin hashrate?

[25-Sep-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
why does there have to be a direct transactional benefit for everything that is done?

[25-Sep-18 03:40 PM] shnu#0359
Isnt that why we have KMD?

[25-Sep-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD has a lot of transparent tx, PIRATE has none, it makes it the ultimate in privacy

[25-Sep-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant do a z->t in PIRATE

[25-Sep-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
you can with KMD

[25-Sep-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so there is now more z PIRATE than any other coin out there and the anon set grows with each transaction

[25-Sep-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
building an ecosystem is not about monetizing every last thing with some explicit lockin to KMD

[25-Sep-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
that is not any sustainable model in an open source world

[25-Sep-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so the idea is to have useful projects in the ecosystem that makes the overall ecosystem better

[25-Sep-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
now if KMD was as private as PIRATE, it would likely get delisted from exchanges

[25-Sep-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is too dangerous and there is no way to know the chickens, so they would likely just ban it

[25-Sep-18 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but I am working on low cost way for people to KMD <-> PIRATE, to enable all of KMD peoples to have the benefit of PIRATE. If they choose to

[25-Sep-18 03:46 PM] shnu#0359
so is KMD is the only gateway to PIRATE?

[25-Sep-18 03:47 PM] shnu#0359
thanks for the explanation jl

[25-Sep-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
right now there is no way other than OTC trading to get PIRATE (or mining)

[25-Sep-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
I made a bounty to create a KMD<-> PIRATE exchange using zdeposit and zwithdraw

[25-Sep-18 03:48 PM] shnu#0359
was a reason it wasn't airdropped?

[25-Sep-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
how can it be airdropped?

[25-Sep-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not a premine

[25-Sep-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not an ICO

[25-Sep-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it is 100% mined

[25-Sep-18 03:48 PM] snowdamn#2414
isn't entry/exit from PIRATE through another crypto equivalent to a t tx?  i'm sticking with z-KMD personally. all you have to do is force recipient to give you a z address to achieve same by sending from z. but i understand the investment opportunity, of course

[25-Sep-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
also where to airdrop to?

[25-Sep-18 03:48 PM] shnu#0359
aah gotcha

[25-Sep-18 03:49 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c where possible to find this bounty conditions?

[25-Sep-18 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, I figured out how to calculate a shared secret address so might be possible to make an airdrop

[25-Sep-18 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
but would need PIRATE whales to contribute to fund the airdrop

no it wont work as people's pubkeys wont be known

[25-Sep-18 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
so people would need to register zaddr, very messy

[25-Sep-18 04:15 PM] shnu#0359
It would be nice to have all the tech developments from 2018 in one place.
Even a simple log of planned activities would be great..e.g updated tech roadmap
There seems to be a lot of development to catch up on, outside the planned tech roadmap.

[25-Sep-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry, I dont work on some planned out roadmap

[25-Sep-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
new ideas come to me, when they do

[25-Sep-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
and I implement them

[25-Sep-18 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
usually a lot faster than can even be tested, let alone fully digested and marketed

[25-Sep-18 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
I plan to continue to make unplanned tech developments as they spontaneously arise

[25-Sep-18 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
For anybody that believes true innovation can be planned and managed like some standard process to make a new house, I have news. It isnt.

[25-Sep-18 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
It is a creative process that combines with technical experience

[25-Sep-18 04:20 PM] shnu#0359
It is good to have direction.

[25-Sep-18 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
my direction is to improve the ecosystem

[25-Sep-18 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
which first required to create it

[25-Sep-18 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
all the while critics were saying I should just do one thing at a time

[25-Sep-18 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
I leave the creation of road maps and having directions to others

[25-Sep-18 04:28 PM] shnu#0359
That comment on roadmap was indeed directed to "others".
But I am sure "others" have a tough time understanding and planning/putting out roadmaps that none wishes to follow. I wish them good luck.
I have faith in Komodo, but hard time to get a global picture of developments.
And here I sit and wonder how KMD adoption can be improved. Clueless for the moment.

[25-Sep-18 04:29 PM] snowdamn#2414
tbh i'd prefer to see a PIRATE <->BTC gateway only at this stage, will suck to see miners constantly dumping the KMD they get through current plans

[25-Sep-18 04:30 PM] snowdamn#2414
but i know it breaks the premise

[25-Sep-18 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
at current rates, it is a whopping 1 BTC of sell pressure per day, assuming 100% of PIRATE is converted to KMD and then dumped for BTC by the miners

[25-Sep-18 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
i guarantee that 100% of the PIRATE wont be sold for KMD and also that 100% of the obtained KMD wont be sold for BTC

[25-Sep-18 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
even at a much higher than expected 50% for each, it is a sell pressure of 0.25 BTC per day

[25-Sep-18 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
I think KMD will survive this

[25-Sep-18 04:34 PM] snowdamn#2414
yeah, KMD die hard here, thinking ahead! üòú

[25-Sep-18 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
My disregard for roadmaps, does not mean others dont follow them. however the speed at which I am innovating means there will be a lag from when i make it to when it appears on any roadmap

[25-Sep-18 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
or I could just take a 6 month vacation every few months waiting for the roadmaps to be updated so I can work on the roadmap

[25-Sep-18 04:36 PM] shnu#0359
Dont waste time jl to my silly comments. You are better off without than any roadmap.
Let roadmaps follow you. Cheers!

[25-Sep-18 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the roadmaps need to follow me üòÉ

any other way to have a z address for pirate than to install komodo node and sync all the blockchain ?

any other way to have secure currency than to personally secure currency ?

i was thinking of some sort of bootstrap officialy supported but ok

[25-Sep-18 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE chain is still very small

[25-Sep-18 04:56 PM] BL0ckchain#6564
i was speaking of the komodo blockchain , i need to have the komodo chain synced before syncing the pirate chain ?

[25-Sep-18 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[25-Sep-18 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is an independent chain

no need to sync KMD

[25-Sep-18 08:03 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
you can mine PIRATE after you sync PIRATE; you can mine Komodo after Komodo syncs

[25-Sep-18 08:06 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
Then what do I do for build Komodo

[25-Sep-18 08:06 PM] xRobeSx#5136
you need to build KMD source. but that's so that you can run PIRATE
