How you feel bout their tech? got 2 nodes myself

[26-Jun-19 09:33 AM] Keppie#5156
TPS will skyrocket with those 200 extra nodes, thanks 😄

[26-Jun-19 09:33 AM] Keppie#5156
Jag asked ya ?

[26-Jun-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
SYS is a sold project and used the masternodes to achieve specific technical goals

[26-Jun-19 09:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You running sys master nodes James?

[26-Jun-19 09:34 AM] Keppie#5156
Would be a waste of those 20m sys locked up aye

[26-Jun-19 09:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What is the returns like?

[26-Jun-19 09:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Running 200 nodes, can see that being a huge headache

[26-Jun-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
i think about 3% APR, which is better than 0%

[26-Jun-19 09:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
True but dont think it is worth the effort since your time is more valuable doing other things

[26-Jun-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
it is delegated

You think heat will come back in any meaningful way?

[26-Jun-19 09:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
Wow running a syscoin node has a 11%roi

[26-Jun-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont think we are getting anything close to that

[26-Jun-19 09:40 AM] CHMEX#0686
Maybe the stats are old....

[26-Jun-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe our 200 nodes reduces the ROI...

[26-Jun-19 09:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
lol

[26-Jun-19 09:42 AM] Keppie#5156
The calculators show the roi for the past 24 hours

[26-Jun-19 09:42 AM] CHMEX#0686
They also state 1200 nodes running so 200 are like 16%

[26-Jun-19 09:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
got a link to that website?

@peddycb the best marketing is word of mouth, so what have you done to market it?

[26-Jun-19 09:48 AM] peddycb#5889
well it lacks many people here the time always to be here...I personally would prefer to read announcements on twitter ...so have the feeling that much does not matter in public

I'm just thinking about how kmd can be better worn to the public

It is hard to make an announcement on twitter when it has not launched

This BTC run up is so surreal, no media coverage, I have told half a dozen people I work with that Bitcoin is up from 3k to 13k and half of them have literally rolled their eyes. Zero interest! I am living in a truly insane world.

[27-Jun-19 09:48 AM] Roxin#4844
it was possible that a seed gives a different address on different versions in Agama ?

[27-Jun-19 09:53 AM] Oszy#5734
no

[27-Jun-19 09:53 AM] Oszy#5734
only a typo

[27-Jun-19 09:53 AM] Oszy#5734
`space`

[27-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Oszy#5734
double check what you enter

[27-Jun-19 11:15 AM] Roxin#4844
@Oszy so i have to put "space" between every word right ?

[27-Jun-19 11:16 AM] Roxin#4844
because i lost all my coins on verus wallet. .and the seed is 100% correctly...now they say its imposible dame seed to give 2 diferent address...but my coins was there 5 6 day ago..with same seed...and now 0 balance

[27-Jun-19 11:20 AM] gcharang#6833
@Roxin 
-  "space" between every word ✅ 

but make sure you are not adding extra spaces before the first word or after the last word
also make sure you are not copy pasting from "complex" programs like MS-word that add a font to the text

use simple programs like notepad, gedit to backup the seed phrase

[27-Jun-19 11:21 AM] Roxin#4844
thats what i did...i save my seed also on paper and also on text document...and now it gives me another adress for hush and 0 balance..

[27-Jun-19 11:21 AM] Roxin#4844
so the seed is 100% sure correct...

[27-Jun-19 11:22 AM] gcharang#6833
did you create this seed phrase in Verus Agama or old agama?

[27-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Oszy#5734
so you are not getting a different address as you first said, you are missing your balance

[27-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Oszy#5734
?

[27-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Oszy#5734
can you see any outgoing transactions with the amount you missing?

[27-Jun-19 11:24 AM] Roxin#4844
@gcharang i create it im verus wallet

[27-Jun-19 11:24 AM] Roxin#4844
@Oszy now when i log in with seed phrase it gives me another address than i receive when i transfer hush
