in effect that is what happened

[13-Jun-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
disproportionate, but that is how i am rationalizing the loss

[13-Jun-19 10:56 AM] Kaed#8040
I understand what you mean and feel

[13-Jun-19 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
for anybody that doubted digitalprice got hacked, there is blockchain proof that they did

Are we flagging those funds should they ever touch a CEX and have them block the account it touches? Would we encourage the hacker to come forward and have him forfeit a portion of the funds towards a fund to make the hacked funds whole again and so we will not encourage exchanges to block his funds?

[13-Jun-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
he is constantly moving the funds

[13-Jun-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
what do we tell the exchanges to block?

[13-Jun-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
any utxo that descends from the combined loot?

[13-Jun-19 11:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm true, I've seen it happen with 'dirty' btc, where an exchange starts asking questions where it came from etc

[13-Jun-19 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
yes and innocent users end up with their funds frozen

[13-Jun-19 11:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but in an era where DEX become more used innocent users will be duped

[13-Jun-19 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
hacker could just send small amounts to random users

[13-Jun-19 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
now all their funds are "descended" from the stolen funds

The only option might be to offer him 0,5 kmd on 1kmd to have him keep it and not make his life as hard as possible or something like that

[13-Jun-19 11:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
400k kmd ish is still a nice payday

[13-Jun-19 11:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And the other half might ease the pain to cover the losses

[13-Jun-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly if he comes forward i can agree to such a deal. how exactly to make him come forward?

[13-Jun-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
what if his goal was to get KMD?

[13-Jun-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
he could have picked any of the top 50 coins to do this to

[13-Jun-19 11:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I wouldnt be surprised if they are keeping an eye on this discord

[13-Jun-19 11:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
a deal like that would be beneficial for all parties, everyone loses a bit less

[13-Jun-19 11:06 AM] Kaed#8040
He won't come for a deal if he has nothing to lose by not making a deal üòÉ

[13-Jun-19 11:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
He has shown himself/herself to be patient enough to wait this out

[13-Jun-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
he targeted KMD

[13-Jun-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
specifically

[13-Jun-19 11:07 AM] Kaed#8040
All he has to do now is to patiently split the funds and sell them over time

[13-Jun-19 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
just collect rewards for a few years, send dust to random accounts, DEX some coins. we really will make a mess if we taint those coins

[13-Jun-19 11:08 AM] Kaed#8040
I'd say "well played"

[13-Jun-19 11:08 AM] Kaed#8040
Yes

[13-Jun-19 11:08 AM] Kaed#8040
I don't think it's possible to do anything

[13-Jun-19 11:09 AM] rob#8269

for now just keep an eye on your old address for the smartdust to be sent, once it arrives, be sure to send it to your new claim address so the refund can be processed properly!

[13-Jun-19 11:20 AM] rob#8269
I can‚Äôt access old wallet now. Electrum error

[13-Jun-19 11:20 AM] rob#8269

[13-Jun-19 11:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
use the latest verus agama version, electrum should be fixed in that one

[13-Jun-19 11:20 AM] rob#8269
Yes. The latest.

[13-Jun-19 11:21 AM] rob#8269
Is a zip file. I extracted. And can even create new wallet

[13-Jun-19 11:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[13-Jun-19 11:22 AM] rob#8269

thoughts?

[13-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362
pamp it

[13-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Malti#3948
they are including an enclave to store private keys from what I understand

[13-Jun-19 11:38 AM] Malti#3948
if they follow trhough with this, and for example put it in a seperate chip in future phones (like they do with TouchID and FaceID) then this could be a cool accelerator?

[13-Jun-19 11:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
havent really read up on how safe their chip is

[13-Jun-19 11:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But jl suspected there to be backdoors into the chip so govts can read out data etc

[13-Jun-19 11:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
What if they have some sort of backdoor to your privkeys? üòÉ

[13-Jun-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
the govt already have a giant fiat backdoor

[13-Jun-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
print fiat, buy crypto

[13-Jun-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
much simpler

[13-Jun-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, do the "crypto is evil" to drive down prices to reduce the amount of fiat needed

[13-Jun-19 11:44 AM] CHMEX#0686
Which saves money on printing the fiat:troll:

[13-Jun-19 11:46 AM] CHMEX#0686
De la rue had to write off 15m or so because the venezuela gov did not pay for the bills they printed

[13-Jun-19 11:46 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Wait until the governments learn about ARRR

[13-Jun-19 11:47 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Print enough fiat to purchase a tonne of ARRR

[13-Jun-19 12:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
would be fun if govt's stats on printing new fiat could added to evaluate adjusted price of cryptocurrencies.

[13-Jun-19 12:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if they start printing too much, the adjusted prices reflect there.... like we see on coin market cap site etc.

[13-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Malti#3948
i'm just thinking it could be good to cater to adoption if there is a "foolproof" way to store private keys to even 'own' crypto

[13-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Malti#3948
but that you own your keys

[13-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Malti#3948
for example, you can also now buy btc using Revolut (the challenger bank), but they won't give you the private keys

[13-Jun-19 12:31 PM] Malti#3948
you just see the balance of what you allegedly own

[13-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Acura#2748
I am curious how Waves Dex will implement the upcoming FATF regulations.
Apparently all exchanges offering Fiat are affected.

ok, i wait your PR that implements it safely

[13-Jun-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i couldnt figure out how to do it

[13-Jun-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
even just sending all the funds in a single tx, he can make a script to do it every 10 minutes, ever changing txid

[13-Jun-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
or just split it into 100 and then forward all the funds every 5 minutes, 100x

[13-Jun-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is not XRP or EOS

[13-Jun-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
we cant very easily freeze funds

Komodo 

[13-Jun-19 01:44 PM] phm87#7395
Several methods were discussed during the XVG hack and @ocminer  suggested different code to forbid the stolen funds to be spent (but each proposed code had some possible bad side effects). In XVG case, XVG dev team didn't had the competences to undestand any of this. I heard that KMD have more experience to ban some funds (but I don't have sources for this info nor code examples)

[13-Jun-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
we would have to create an ancestor hashtable to track all descendants of the stolen funds to have a chance at allowing it to execute in a reasonable amount of time, but then what happens when a lot of unrelated addresses are contaminated with dust from any of the anscestors?

[13-Jun-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it will create a giant mess that would require some sort of centralized process to unfreeze anything that gets caught up in the algo

[13-Jun-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
what do people do monthly?

[13-Jun-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810

[13-Jun-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
which is done how?

[13-Jun-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
combining all utxo into a single one

[13-Jun-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so now, we need to what? allocate what percentage of each utxo is contaminated?

[13-Jun-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so i decide to keep KMD 100% fungible

[13-Jun-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
there are no illegal KMD funds that are able to be spent. some utxo from the early days hack is still frozen

[13-Jun-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
we know exactly the amount that was identified
