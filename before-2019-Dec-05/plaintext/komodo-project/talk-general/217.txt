I think the exchange of ideas and the community here is, in some ways, more valuable than any anticipated financial return. You may have had to liquidate for now. But the return on the knowledge may be much greater in the future. Also,  many of us here have lost exponentially more.

it does appear they send the passphrase to google for spell checking. of all the silly things to do with a passphrase, this is ranking near the top

confirmed by Ledger but seems fixable

[27-Feb-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
everyone  it has been confirmed that the coinimi wallet is sending your entire passphrase, fully intact, to google for spellchecking. This means that google will have your passphrase in their logs, which they (correctly) wouldnt be treating as having any high value. It could just be they have not much security at all as to who can access these logs. How many people work at google? how many can get access to google servers with unprotected logfiles via some means? I do not know if these logfiles even exist or if they are indeed unprotected, but then again I dont know that they dont. The point is that it is entirely possible due to this design flaw of coinimi wallet. Strongly advise to move coins out of coinimi wallets before someone else does it to you

@CoinomiWallet sends your plain text seed phrase to Googles remote spellchecker API when you enter it! This is not a joke!

Is it the coinomi app doing this in their code, or is it the client who is using a keyboard app with remote spelling check?

[27-Feb-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it degrades security to worse than central exchange security as I assume central exchanges protect their coins better than google would be protecting logfiles of spellchecker

@lukechilds it is the main coinimi app doing this spellchecking?

[27-Feb-19 08:35 AM] Jurjen#9294
There are a lot of users with remote spellcheck enabled. And as coinomi is giving a plain text field, then users which such keyboards installed...

[27-Feb-19 08:35 AM] Jurjen#9294
It would be better if coinomi will use a password field instead

regardless having system default behavior to be sending to google is a fatal flaw

automatic spell checking seems impossible to turn off in many places and if that is using remote servers it needs to be fixed so no matter what the system settings, it is not automatically being sent

[27-Feb-19 08:37 AM] Jurjen#9294
And I think (not sure) Google will protect it spell check better then most crypto central systems. Because for example the spell check is also used in Google Docs, which is having a high protection because companies use it for confidental information and so
