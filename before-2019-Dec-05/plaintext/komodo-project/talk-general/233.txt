Hi all, how can I sign up to be a beta tester for the mobile dex?

[15-Mar-19 07:51 AM] Mylo#8306
I have to wait for the instructions to be confirmed - but something to do with play store.

[15-Mar-19 08:18 AM] cryptojace#7102
@Mylo cool, so the beta is open to anyone?

[15-Mar-19 08:18 AM] cryptojace#7102
Surely beta will be tested prior to launching on play store?

[15-Mar-19 08:20 AM] Mylo#8306
"instructions to be confirmed" - no idea, technically it's a closed alpha atm.
you can launch apps on play store in private distribution channels.

[15-Mar-19 08:20 AM] Mylo#8306
ios as well, ios has the "test flight" app to do same thing.  up to 1000 testers or so

[15-Mar-19 08:21 AM] cryptojace#7102
@Mylo ah ok I see. Cheers

[16-Mar-19 07:55 AM] cryptopleb#8063
There way to many channel here now what happen

[16-Mar-19 07:57 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Anyways i finally found what look like general channel and here i will vent.

All this time i think barter dex was best DX choice but i find out just the opposite

[16-Mar-19 07:57 AM] cryptopleb#8063
This is bad both barter dex and hyper dex, i cant even place order

[16-Mar-19 07:57 AM] cryptopleb#8063
And central electrum what is this ?  i dont want central i want full node

[16-Mar-19 07:58 AM] cryptopleb#8063
How is order book relay i cant find   this is bad development i am very unhappy i found this project

[16-Mar-19 08:00 AM] cryptopleb#8063
So much document is hidden by KMD team i cant find anything i need

[16-Mar-19 08:00 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Team dont even explain what happens

[16-Mar-19 08:00 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I will probably be ban for this but no other way to describe month of frustration

[16-Mar-19 08:00 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I rather lose coin on central exchange

[16-Mar-19 08:03 AM] jorian#4555
the dex is undergoing a transformation atm, it's been rewritten and is in alpha testing now

[16-Mar-19 08:04 AM] jorian#4555
the initial dex released a year ago is basically dormant, so it's better to wait for the new dex (dubbed mm2.0) to come out

[16-Mar-19 08:04 AM] jorian#4555
everything you need you'll find on docs.komodoplatform.com

[16-Mar-19 08:04 AM] jorian#4555
granted, that place looks like an explosion, but if you care to look, you'll find what you need

[16-Mar-19 08:07 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I have gone there

[16-Mar-19 08:07 AM] gcharang#6833
Even in the old dex both full nodes and electrum mode are possible

[16-Mar-19 08:07 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Right now i barterdex all over crypto and dont work

[16-Mar-19 08:07 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Very unhappy

[16-Mar-19 08:08 AM] cryptopleb#8063
@gcharang it is not though i was here and had frustration

[16-Mar-19 08:08 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Full node and electrum error both

[16-Mar-19 08:08 AM] gcharang#6833
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/barterDEX/install-barterDEX-CLI.html#activating-coins have you see this?

[16-Mar-19 08:09 AM] gcharang#6833
the reason barterdex can't be used right now is because there is no liquidity.

[16-Mar-19 08:09 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Yes but i dont use terminal

[16-Mar-19 08:09 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Just GUI

[16-Mar-19 08:09 AM] cryptopleb#8063
No but i trade with myself no broadcast

[16-Mar-19 08:10 AM] gcharang#6833
Any other errors, you can ask for help here , our support can resolve it

[16-Mar-19 08:10 AM] cryptopleb#8063
No error

[16-Mar-19 08:10 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Just not work

[16-Mar-19 08:10 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I even have watch address in wallets

[16-Mar-19 08:11 AM] cryptopleb#8063
So barterdex knows but not broadcast

[16-Mar-19 08:11 AM] cryptopleb#8063
And when can broadcast no acceptance possible

[16-Mar-19 08:11 AM] jorian#4555
how do you trade with yourself?

[16-Mar-19 08:12 AM] cryptopleb#8063
2 different machine different IP

[16-Mar-19 08:12 AM] jorian#4555
should work

[16-Mar-19 08:12 AM] jorian#4555
can you see the orderbook on the other pc?

[16-Mar-19 08:12 AM] cryptopleb#8063
This is my thought

[16-Mar-19 08:12 AM] jorian#4555
how do you set the price?

[16-Mar-19 08:12 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Orderbook only 1 in many depending on pair

[16-Mar-19 08:13 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I also notice coin very outdated

[16-Mar-19 08:13 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Directory not even match

[16-Mar-19 08:13 AM] cryptopleb#8063
How send to smartaddress and not even show or see full node

[16-Mar-19 08:14 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I have spend months on this

[16-Mar-19 08:14 AM] cryptopleb#8063
0 successful trade

[16-Mar-19 08:14 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I offer 0.50 LTC for txid of success trade pair and no response but go to support

[16-Mar-19 08:15 AM] gcharang#6833
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/BarterDEX#this-repository-is-deprecated-and-no-longer-supported-please-wait-for-the-mm2-release

This is the official position of Komodo, so the GUI version you have might be outdated. Please wait for mm2 release which will have all the features of the old dex(electrum + full node) and better connectivity between home computers

[16-Mar-19 08:15 AM] cryptopleb#8063
2 week release not sure exact time

[16-Mar-19 08:16 AM] cryptopleb#8063
And hyperdex nice format for i guess DX

[16-Mar-19 08:16 AM] cryptopleb#8063
They have release in 2019

[16-Mar-19 08:16 AM] cryptopleb#8063
But disclaimer on electrum (which is good warning)

[16-Mar-19 08:17 AM] jorian#4555
yes, like i said: there is a new dex coming, it's just not out yet

[16-Mar-19 08:17 AM] cryptopleb#8063
And electrum dont work either üòÇ

[16-Mar-19 08:17 AM] jorian#4555
electrum is perfectly safe

[16-Mar-19 08:17 AM] jorian#4555
not sure why you're warning us for electrum

[16-Mar-19 08:17 AM] cryptopleb#8063
But how safe if 1 member run server?

[16-Mar-19 08:17 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I want to validate on own node

[16-Mar-19 08:17 AM] jorian#4555
you can

[16-Mar-19 08:17 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I try tho

[16-Mar-19 08:17 AM] cryptopleb#8063
No success

[16-Mar-19 08:18 AM] jorian#4555
how do you enable a coin?

[16-Mar-19 08:18 AM] cryptopleb#8063

[16-Mar-19 08:18 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Many more

[16-Mar-19 08:18 AM] jorian#4555
look, i can help you get through all this, but what's the point if the dex is deprecated

[16-Mar-19 08:19 AM] jorian#4555
save your LTC, wait a couple weeks until you can beta test mm2.0

[16-Mar-19 08:19 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I just think it bad for news to come to me

[16-Mar-19 08:19 AM] cryptopleb#8063
And not even work
