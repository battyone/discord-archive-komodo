[04-Nov-19 10:41 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
In crypto, one never has enough, so I would say: continue!

[04-Nov-19 10:42 AM] SHossain#0007

[04-Nov-19 11:10 AM] SHossain#0007

So when will DEX add pirate now that the lite client is working ?

[05-Nov-19 02:54 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Still a lot more to do to make pirate atomic swaps happen

[05-Nov-19 07:40 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
could it be possible to have kind of p2p escrow service? for purpose to exchange through many gates simultaneously so that if one gate appears evil (in whatever meaning possible - or turned of permanently) one looses only part of the funds, but gateways should be rewarder for participation, so that they are being maintenaied?

[05-Nov-19 07:42 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I imagine this as clients network having randomly changed addresses of coin A and Coin B, and when I want to exchange many clients get pieces of coin A from me and coin B from the other party (this could go in sequence to ensure it's really happening) and then AB clients are sending the other one back

[05-Nov-19 07:43 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if for some reason one exchanging client would go offline or not sent what was supposed to - would be marked by network somehow and not used again or sth like that

[05-Nov-19 07:43 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
that could work as long as evil participant is less < X % of the network

[05-Nov-19 07:45 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or to protect from evil it could be required that one client store some BTC in the other clients (network) and that would be relevant value to avg tx it takes single time

[05-Nov-19 07:48 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@polycryptoblog what you think?

[05-Nov-19 07:48 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
kind of alternative for z-addr maybe?

[05-Nov-19 07:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
You had #barterlly but that wasnt really decentralized.

[05-Nov-19 07:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
When atomicdex is fully operational you can perfectly do a decentralized swap p2p on a private net id

[05-Nov-19 12:33 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
yes but atomic will decrease privacy a bit, and p2p network with decentralized escrows might not decrease such (no need to have t-addr again )

[05-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
PSA: if you are Discord nitro user, you now have 2 boosts to hand out, be sure to check if you have already used both, maybe you can give out one to Komodo

"PatentTX (PTX) is a cryptocurrency token issued on the Komodo platform."

[05-Nov-19 05:47 PM] Mark81#4505
Looks like some how relating to Pungo project as they are mentioned on their website as partners.

[05-Nov-19 05:48 PM] Mark81#4505
And komodo also. But with old logo....

[05-Nov-19 05:59 PM] phm87#7395

@Oszy you can store it on verus agama I think

[05-Nov-19 06:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I mined a couple thousand with cpu back in the day :p

[05-Nov-19 06:50 PM] phm87#7395
@Cryptoon can you ping me when you mine sth with cpu or gpu ? I own no asic

[05-Nov-19 07:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But then I cant do it in secret when nobody knows about it 😄

[05-Nov-19 07:14 PM] phm87#7395

[05-Nov-19 07:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[05-Nov-19 07:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
nowadays not sure what nethash is for PTX, maybe if it is still low you can still mine it from agama

[05-Nov-19 10:41 PM] Berg#2666
Hey guys, is there a secure wallet out there where I can stake my KMD for the 5% reward? Binance has bent me these past two months and isn't distributing a damn thing on these....

[05-Nov-19 10:49 PM] jl777c#5810
binance had some problems in claiming their rewards last month. if they can get it right this month, they will have a lot more to distribute

[05-Nov-19 10:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Berg Atomicdex, verus agama, chameleon pay, QT

[05-Nov-19 10:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Chainswap and send funds to self

[05-Nov-19 10:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I wonder if you can keep funds on private wallet and when binance announces airdrop, just transfer funds real quick, or do they account for weighted days held on the exchange?

[05-Nov-19 10:59 PM] jl777c#5810
binance has a custom system they use, it isnt quite right yet, at least as of last month. but they did do a claim tx so they are much closer than originally, when they didnt even claim

[05-Nov-19 11:00 PM] Berg#2666
Thanks

[05-Nov-19 11:01 PM] Berg#2666
@Cryptoon how do I claim on AtomicDEX or the QT wallet?

[05-Nov-19 11:01 PM] Berg#2666
I was using Agama until the whole fiasco happened 😅
