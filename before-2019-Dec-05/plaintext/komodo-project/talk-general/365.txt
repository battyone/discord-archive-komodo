did you read my post?

[13-Jun-19 07:47 PM] bogybogy#3962
Yes

[13-Jun-19 07:47 PM] bogybogy#3962
Ow

[13-Jun-19 07:47 PM] bogybogy#3962
Now

[13-Jun-19 07:48 PM] bogybogy#3962
Hard to get all the Information very technical but I understand now

[13-Jun-19 07:48 PM] bogybogy#3962
Thanks

[13-Jun-19 07:48 PM] bogybogy#3962
So complex

[13-Jun-19 07:48 PM] bogybogy#3962
But really helpful

[13-Jun-19 07:50 PM] bogybogy#3962
If you havent read the satoshi whitepaper, now is a good time to do so‚Ä¶ OK, so what did it say? At first when you realize that all nodes have to keep track of the entire lifetime transaction history, it just seems so impractical.

[13-Jun-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
decentralized solutions are usually quite a bit more involved than any centralized solution

[13-Jun-19 08:02 PM] bogybogy#3962
Kusd coins will be a good step for Komodo platform,many are looking to get involved to have a loan and to not sell them crypto

[13-Jun-19 08:14 PM] Ondalf#1318

[13-Jun-19 08:23 PM] dan.#2473
seems so

[13-Jun-19 08:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Maybe I missed a message, for the other large ACs, like Crypto and DEX, are those being auto refunded like the KMD was?  Same addresses?

[13-Jun-19 08:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Didn't see it in the pin but didn't read the whole article word for word.

[13-Jun-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810

[13-Jun-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810

[13-Jun-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810

I have a strange mistake. when I log in version v0.6.0-13-PBaaS cross-chain technology preview with my seed is all right. If I log in with the same seed in version 0.5.7 I get another address. Since I log in on keepassass I can not make any mistakes when logging in. Anyone else?

[13-Jun-19 10:23 PM] SHossain#0007
0.5.7 has seed input issue. use 0.6.xxx version

[13-Jun-19 10:25 PM] Philtr#9415
So they fix that?

[13-Jun-19 10:32 PM] Philtr#9415

hi - trying move my Chips smartdust to my new  safe address using Verus Agama  and getting invalid pub address error - happening in both (O.5.7 and 0.6.0) Any suggestions?

[14-Jun-19 12:32 AM] mrlynch#5735
use chips qt

[14-Jun-19 05:05 AM] VICTORDOT#1884
hey guys, I claimed my KMD and yet nor received to new agama wallet, is this normal?

[14-Jun-19 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
did you send the smartdust from old address to new address?

[14-Jun-19 06:30 AM] agnewpickens#7393
What is this smartdust, just hearing about it, I am pretty busy on another server as a Mod, checking my old address(es) right now.

[14-Jun-19 06:34 AM] agnewpickens#7393
I see the dust, OK, will reread the instructions.

[14-Jun-19 06:35 AM] jl777c#5810
just send it to the new address you put in the claim form. as long as it matches, it is automatically processed when i run the refund processor

[14-Jun-19 06:35 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Cool, I used the Ocean Qt for my main address, just got is synced, took me a while.

[14-Jun-19 06:36 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Have some Supernet that is supposed to go there as well.

[14-Jun-19 06:36 AM] agnewpickens#7393
See the smartdust for that too.

[14-Jun-19 06:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Other assets will not be processesed before next week. Komodo first üòÉ

[14-Jun-19 06:38 AM] agnewpickens#7393
No worries.  Just want to be able to get my KMD for now, didn't have much in the way of Supernet.

[14-Jun-19 06:38 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Ugh, Ocean Qt giving me an error, hope I don't have to resync.

[14-Jun-19 06:39 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Well, funds will be there when I complete resync, just need to send the smartdust, right?

[14-Jun-19 06:42 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Ya, have to resync, can't rename notarisations folder, ugh.

[14-Jun-19 06:43 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Gonna try rebooting, must have some KMD process running in the background.

[14-Jun-19 06:47 AM] Blackbeard#9921
Morning guys

[14-Jun-19 06:53 AM] agnewpickens#7393
There it goes, ya, need a stronger computer for all the crap I run on this computer.

[14-Jun-19 06:55 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Thanks for the help, think I have it from here for now.

[14-Jun-19 06:56 AM] agnewpickens#7393
send max amount?

[14-Jun-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[14-Jun-19 06:58 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Done for KMD, thanks much, will be easier with other address, have that on Verus Agama, but this was the big wallet for me, wanted Ocean Qt just to be on the extra safe side.

[14-Jun-19 06:59 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Hope y'all can get that partnership with Dash in Latin America going, that is the coin I help Mod, hooked up PTYX with our top Latam project last week.

[14-Jun-19 07:01 AM] agnewpickens#7393
One more wallet to check and then I can go to bed.

George Donnelly has our most ambitious independent project going, would be really sweet, he has an amazing infrastructure already in Columbia and branching out into VZ and Peru.

[14-Jun-19 07:03 AM] agnewpickens#7393
And there are quite a few KMD holders in our chat, so would be a popular fit.

[14-Jun-19 07:05 AM] agnewpickens#7393
And, there's the dust in my other KMD wallet, looks like I am good to go, again thanks much.

[14-Jun-19 07:06 AM] agnewpickens#7393
OK, all done, now I can get some shut eye.

What happened to Komodo solving the oracle problem in one weekend and 500 lines of code? Why isn't Google Cloud using Komodo's oracles?

[14-Jun-19 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
the trustless oracle problem that i solved and getting a service deployed on google cloud, are two different things. nothing stops them, but without some specially focused team to do just that, it probably wont happen on its own

[14-Jun-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
that being said, anybody could deploy a chain using the trustless oracles on google cloud

smartdust was sent, so you can finalize the claim by sending it from the old address to the address you claimed

[14-Jun-19 12:38 PM] CrytoHunter#3593
Thank you for the Great work. I did sent to the new address. Thanks for the update.

I still can't believe more people aren't using VPNs though... especially in this day and age

[14-Jun-19 03:39 PM] bishop#9773
I get that, but unverified accounts still exist at this time and in the near future. Until those go away, people still have flexibility to get around geoblocking

[14-Jun-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
finished todays refunds, only about a dozen. it seems most are stuck waiting for users to send the smartdust from old address to new address. until that is done, not much more refunds can happen.
