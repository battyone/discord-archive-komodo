@jl777c are you familiar with the new bulletproof made by Monero? I saw Andreas talking about it like it was zero knowledge improvement, so I'm thinking Monero got zk-snarks now ?

[25-Oct-18 11:35 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt zk-snark, it is a bulletproof. makes is almost as small as zksnarks

[25-Oct-18 11:35 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it also hides things a bit better

[26-Oct-18 12:48 AM] house#8741

@Geocold51  send him to @siu - Chainmakers

[26-Oct-18 05:09 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã   So the "bulletproof" is a zero knowledge proof of transaction commitment .  It allows them to verify the transaction isn't trying to do an overflow by using a really big number or trying to generate coins out of thin air,  because of the zkp ,  coin amounts can be hidden, and tx size is reduced by 80%.  My guess because a hash of the proof is a lot less data than a proof itself .  It is not a snark as a snark is an argument not a proof.  Note the differences in definition ( An argument is valid if and only if its conclusion is a consequence of its premises .  A proof must demonstrate that a statement is always true .)

@Geocold51 nice to hear from you here. You can refer to two links to any project for dPoW.
- whitepaper of dPoW
- @dukeleto guide on dPoW implementation

@polycryptoblog  so it does not improve Monero anon tech, just speed / load optimization ?

[26-Oct-18 06:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
it makes the coin amounts not visible

[26-Oct-18 06:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

What are zkSNARKs? How do they work?
From my brief exposure to the concept, zkSNARKs seems to be a form of zero-knowledge cryptography.
  What can zkSNARKs bring to the table for Ethereum?
I have looked at projects like this but still

@blackjok3r great project üëè üëç

Yeah its pretty cool üòÑ

[26-Oct-18 07:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just working out how to actually send a file with it now... I have hex string in and out working just fine.

[26-Oct-18 07:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going to write dAPP in python that can send file over blockchain

[26-Oct-18 07:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then some GUI guys can make it work with video

[26-Oct-18 07:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hope to have a video of it in action up tonight

[26-Oct-18 07:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362
How will this affect chain sizes?

[26-Oct-18 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Each stream is a new chain... the chain is ondemand created by the streamer

[26-Oct-18 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If they use dPoW there is a normal dpow TX on KMD.

[26-Oct-18 07:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Aaah only for livestreaming?

[26-Oct-18 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[26-Oct-18 07:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So not to replace youtube?

[26-Oct-18 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can send absolutly anything into the blockchain then retreive it via RPC call... you can use it to store files, so you know the file is exactly as it was when you put it in there, as if it has changed the chain would not sync... each 8kb chunk is in a utxo that is counted by the hashes of the chain and merkle roots etc.

[26-Oct-18 07:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah, but I mean lets say you want to use it to make a decentralized youtube

[26-Oct-18 07:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
This would require insane amounts of storage from the nodes no?

[26-Oct-18 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You would need youtube server farm... üòÇ

[26-Oct-18 07:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah k üòÉ

[26-Oct-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the blockchain adds 10% extra size over the raw data

[26-Oct-18 07:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Just read streaming and thought of youtube and the huge farms google has

[26-Oct-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but you then get the benifits of storing it in a blokchcain, and built in p2p distribution etc.

[26-Oct-18 07:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Could be interesting for stuff like wikileaks/megaupload etc

[26-Oct-18 07:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
To prove a file is the real deal

[26-Oct-18 07:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And not fakenews whatever

[26-Oct-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes .. I think personally its most useful to prove some data existed at some time... and verify the copy against KMD using dPOW

[26-Oct-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Each chain is owned by a private key

[26-Oct-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you can prove you were the person with that data at that time, if someone wanted to steal a song you made or somehting liek that

[26-Oct-18 07:43 AM] $tefano.#3560
could be used for interesting project also in legal way .. very nice work
Just some days ago i was seeing a video from lisk about file on blockchain as a dapp

[26-Oct-18 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the hardest part is going to be the dPoW and how we go about spinning up chains, we have a way for notary nodes to pull chain information off a blockchcain and then start dpow on those chains, but at the moment its only working from one trusted oracle source... Although with some more work, someone could spin uptheir own notary nodes and dPoW their own streams, but obviously cost would be quite high there.

[26-Oct-18 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am pretty sure the stakedNotary repo is a git pull and ./start.sh to fully build and start and sync all chains, and start the notary node.

[26-Oct-18 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if we can put that into docker image ... almsot anyone could spin up a notary network for their chains on demand.

[26-Oct-18 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes its pretty cool, the only thing remaning to be solved is the notary pukeys are hardcoded into the komdodo source code, once I work out how to store those on a blockchain, üöÄ

this video streaming on-demand chain spawning idea is amazing.
It is in actual a "Data Stream" tied directly to "Streaming Money".
On top of that it's Crypto-Conditions [UTXO] based smart contract.
The possibilities with this technology are just limitless.

[26-Oct-18 08:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's all about data streaming on internet if one understands.

this chat is a data stream.

[26-Oct-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
