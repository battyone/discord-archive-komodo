yes its 4 gb

[11-Oct-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
4gb might not be enough, but it should still actually fail ... not just hang

[11-Oct-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
make a 2GB swap file anc start it again

So $DAPS clearly won the last poll over $TRX $XRP and $XVG in regards to who has the strongest community!! Lets match them up with some other strong communal projects like $ICX $NEO and $KMD - this should be interesting!!!

@jl777c i herd from others in discord that u have info about next notary hardfork for komodo and zcash sapling use for increasing mobile shielded address.......

[11-Oct-18 06:18 PM] plazma#1625
any clue plz....

[11-Oct-18 06:27 PM] crumb#2550
@plazma what is it, that you want to know exactly? integrating all necessary changes of sapling into Komodo takes time and care, so there is no point to rush. 
also as it will be a hardfork it will require all miners, exchanges etc. to update 
doing both sapling activation and new notaries at the same time will make the process smoother and less painful
official team members can correct me if i'm on the right track here or missed anything

[11-Oct-18 06:28 PM] plazma#1625
@crumb yes very true....

[11-Oct-18 06:28 PM] plazma#1625
we should see how zcash pay out with sappling....

[11-Oct-18 06:29 PM] plazma#1625
regarding its safety.......

[11-Oct-18 06:29 PM] crumb#2550
verus will activate sapling on the same day as zcash

[11-Oct-18 06:30 PM] plazma#1625

Is the verus solution the nail in the coffin to the POS issues? Or are there still some problems that need to be solved?

[12-Oct-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems it solves the PoS issue

[12-Oct-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
other than initial distribution

[12-Oct-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810

yes, SuperNET aims to get 5% to 10% of VRSC

the 5% is already in place, not sure it can achieve the 10% though

@joe2x4 What is the goal of such rainstorm?

[12-Oct-18 06:17 PM] joe2x4#5987
This is a great question. It seems I pissed off some people with this stunt. I apologise, it wasn't intended as spam. The intent was to produce a unique experience similar to a food fight, but with money. I imagined many people all at once tossing their money in the air and it landing on everyone. The idea is similar to being at a Phish show and watching thousands of people all throw glow sticks around in a massive glow stick war. Anyway some probably liked it, others it annoyed the shit out of them.  So maybe not the best of ideas. :rum:

One of the dumbass things all of those "code rankings" things do is that they only look at 1 branch of 1 repo.
jl777/komodo might have "only" had 520 commits *to the master branch* in the last year, but other branches get that many in a week/month. And other projects stage like that as well.
Imo, any team that has tens of thousands of commits to master per year is repoing wrong to begin with

Too bad, the guy who announced a 51% attack demo on Einsteinium has found that EMC2 implemented #KMD dPoW protection. I had talked with him via pm on Reddit, encouraging to go ahead & also generously tipping the fund address. He's still going to try later in the stream tho...
