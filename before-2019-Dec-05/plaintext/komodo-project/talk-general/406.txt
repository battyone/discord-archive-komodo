This ‘issue’ is completely unrelated to a wallet, which is just an interface between the user and the blockchain.

[06-Aug-19 03:45 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I should even say ‘non-issue’.

[06-Aug-19 03:45 PM] mobipoi#5774
Ok I saw versus and this backdoor stuff and I thought the wallets

[06-Aug-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it only affected the earliest miners

[06-Aug-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and to date, not a single person has claimed their txid was involved, so it appears the verus team identified only their own mined funds

[06-Aug-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
and recovered about two thirds of it, is my guess

[06-Aug-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
until today, this was a totally open and resolved issue for over a year

[06-Aug-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
granted it was unorthodox, but the only solution available and it did not impact any users, didnt increase coin emissions, didnt rollback the chain. what is the big deal?

[06-Aug-19 03:48 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Personally I’m quite disappointed that it has been blown out of proportions and taken out of context, without verifying all details.

[06-Aug-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
calling what is clearly not a backdoor, a "backdoor" surely escalates the issue. there is likely no word for this as it is a pretty unique thing

[06-Aug-19 03:48 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Thank you @jl777c for ~~rectifying~~ clarifying this situation so quickly.

there is nothing wrong about describing technical things, but non-technical people rely on the technical to assess the details. we need to be more responsible about the terms that are used. ie. dont yell "FIRE!" in a crowded theater when somebody lights a cigarrette

[06-Aug-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
technically there is fire involved when lighting a cigarrette, at least there used to be. but that does not mean it is a "FIRE"

[06-Aug-19 03:53 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
That’s a fine example of blowing out of proportion.

[06-Aug-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
backdoor implies a security exposure, here there is a specific list of vetted txids. you really cant call them the same. so let us read the post with "txid reclaimer" instead of "backdoor"

[06-Aug-19 04:00 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
This is not the first time he has done that. I hope he will change his way. It's like he got a beef with VRSC. Instead of asking the devs for clarifications first, he creates panic first.

[06-Aug-19 06:33 PM] gigamesh#3544
was he really oblivious to that bitcointalk post?

[06-Aug-19 06:34 PM] gigamesh#3544

Just looked at NXTer magazine for the first time in a year or so....still makes me sad how the community splintered.  There's not 
a lot that I miss about 2015-16 but the NXT community and the state it was in sure is something I do.  I think the biggest weakness of crypto is how easily it can get splintered, forked, rebranded, divided and abandoned.  The uniting force of the Bitcoin origin story and brand are what have and will keep it strong even against bitter divisions.

[07-Aug-19 12:48 PM] gigamesh#3544
Duke says he didnt know about the May 2018 bitcointalk post. im not suggesting that would have affected his actions. the bitcointalk post predates the TXID reclaim?

[07-Aug-19 12:52 PM] zpajk#7277
*"hidden"*... it's in ``master\src`` as ``veruslaunch.cpp`` **post launch release readiness**. Hardly something I'd call hidden.

[07-Aug-19 12:53 PM] gigamesh#3544
perfect, ty

[07-Aug-19 12:55 PM] gigamesh#3544
in any case the timing of Duke's assault is perhaps correlated with my upcoming VRSC review. No sooner had i finished the HUSH review (and Duke and I were on really good terms) he read about my intent to review VRSC. He was not pleased.

[07-Aug-19 12:58 PM] gigamesh#3544
I mean to cover this topic in the VRSC review and try and put this matter to bed. However Duke is hardcore immutable believer and I doubt it'll sway him. At the same time I completely understand the rationale for VRSC;s actions (which were declared first). VRSC could perhaps have relaunched, but this would have probably created even more furor.

[07-Aug-19 12:58 PM] gigamesh#3544
Abandoning the project would have been a travesty

I have no idea what is it that bothers @dukeleto whenever there's some talk about Verus Project. I don't agree his views on VRSC "txid reclaiming" (which he calls "backdoor") after learning @jl777c explanation, and reference links of Bitcointalk post. doesn't seems like a big issue with "txid reclaiming" and how it all dealt with community consensus and transparently manner.

[07-Aug-19 03:02 PM] PTYX#6840
the options were either lose the verus funds or recover them with a fork right?

[07-Aug-19 03:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
_it's a waste of time talking on this resolved community consensus subject. moving on_

[07-Aug-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
rollback wouldnt have solved it as the funds were already spent on mining

[07-Aug-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and the txid reclaiming was much less of an issue than a rollback would have been

[07-Aug-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess some sort of premine could have been allocated to the team to solve the issue too

[07-Aug-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
basically every single project with any premine at all, has done worse than what the verus txid reclaiming did

it's justified on verus' part. i guess it's not surprising that it was met with resistance though.
