Genie, genie, who can I turn to
You give me something I can hold on to
I know you'll think I'm like the others before
Who saw your name and number on the wall
Geee-nie I've got your number
I need to make you mine
Geee-nie don't change your number....

Hi, I'm looking for information about listing fees on Komodo dex. I'm pretty sure it's free but I don't find a source. Someone can help me? I hope we will have news from the alpha testing soon 😀

@t0sma normally it's $40,000 to list, but right now we can do you one solid and wave the fee. 

See guys, that's how it's done. :troll_hardcore:

[09-May-19 03:26 PM] t0sma#0368
English is not my native language. I'm not sure of the sense of your answer 🤔 @@joe2x4 #troll 

I don't have any coin to list. I'm just looking for the answer about listing fees in order to promote the new dex coming in our smartphone. .  According to the link bellow, I understood that it's free to add a coin on like it should be in a real DEX like barterdex. Someone can confirm?  Thanks

[09-May-19 03:28 PM] joe2x4#5987
This is a free Dex. My comment is in regards to building value based on how it; s presented. The $40,000 number is a rip on binance

[09-May-19 03:28 PM] t0sma#0368
Good👌

[09-May-19 03:31 PM] PTYX#6840
It's more than 40K to list on Binance

[09-May-19 03:32 PM] PTYX#6840
Close to 100K

[09-May-19 03:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its free to add a coin to barterdex IF you test the coin yourself and are sure it works and do a PR to the jl777/coins repo.

[09-May-19 03:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that doesnt mean it will get added to all GUIs using barterdex network.

[09-May-19 04:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hmm, im not sure what you are asking. There is no getinfo rpc call in barterdex

[09-May-19 04:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[09-May-19 04:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

@siu - Chainmakers so was checking requirements for listing ... in guide ... there were list of rpc calls that coin daemon must supports ...

[09-May-19 06:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What coin it is?

[09-May-19 06:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
