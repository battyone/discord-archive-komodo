Hey does anyone know is AWS is partnered with any other crypto projects besides KMD?

[25-Jan-19 05:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
a couple I believe

[25-Jan-19 05:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or at least a couple were boasting an Amazon 'partnership'

[25-Jan-19 05:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not really sure how deep the partnership went compared to the one kmd has atm

[25-Jan-19 05:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think @Steve Lee is in the best position to answer that one

[25-Jan-19 06:02 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yes, would love to hear input. Also if we know if AWS plans to comment or acknowledge the partnership on twitter or anything?

[25-Jan-19 06:24 PM] Anniceris#7260
Qtum, atlas protocol, arcblock to name a few. I suspect there are some more

[25-Jan-19 09:18 PM] Steve Lee#1967
It is important to note that Komodo is  advanced technology partner. From last I checked, QTUM was registered tier and Zilliqa is standard.

[25-Jan-19 09:19 PM] Steve Lee#1967
a joint statement and pr will go along with a major announcement. i'm currently in discussions with them on a few joint solutions.

[25-Jan-19 09:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Good to hear!

[25-Jan-19 09:38 PM] Alecandro#1179
Awesome!!

[25-Jan-19 09:40 PM] Tek#5253
nice

[25-Jan-19 09:55 PM] Steve Lee#1967
We also have our PR agency fully ramped up, so when we announce we will be driving increased coverage with a focus on mainstream media outlets.

It was treated as "joke" emoji

[26-Jan-19 12:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or "sarcasm". I don't like sarcasm, coz I feel too dumb to understand scarcasm sometimes, but anyway.... it was not used for bad purposes, as I remember.

banned?

[26-Jan-19 08:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
:trollface:

[26-Jan-19 08:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@polycryptoblog seems someone thought 1/2 screen of gif was better than small emoji

[26-Jan-19 08:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It was removed because of dumb reasons

[26-Jan-19 08:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because #safespace has overtaken the entire ecosystem?

[26-Jan-19 08:37 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Taken over marketing at least

[26-Jan-19 08:46 PM] Meyse#0952
Its kinda sad to ban trollface gotta say

[26-Jan-19 08:47 PM] PTYX#6840
Why trollface banned?

[26-Jan-19 08:51 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Marketing thought it was too negative and encouraging trolling :trollface:

[26-Jan-19 08:54 PM] Meyse#0952
Big ass gifs are better alternatives of course

[26-Jan-19 08:55 PM] Meyse#0952
I dont think its negative at all here, so why fix a non-existent problem
