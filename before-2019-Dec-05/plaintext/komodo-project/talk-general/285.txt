Either way, ETH gets pooped on a lot in KMD discord. So i was surprised and confused to see ETH mentioned as good company to be in.

[03-May-19 05:45 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
ETH gets pooped on in KMD discord, because KMD is a technical community ,  and ETH is technical disaster ,  doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt do anything good.  They have developed private chain offerings and have great documentation , however relying on completing fool‚Äôs errands like sharding or Layer2 solutions like plasma to increase the technical capability of their ecosystem, foolish at the very least.

I guess I am just more optimistic about ETH's chances at getting their problems sorted out.  They have a lot of brain power working on it and lots of corporate interest and name recognition.  And they are also in a position where they can look critically at other projects and borrow from what those that do things successfully, right?

there is a perfectionism here in KMD that is on one hand cool, right?  because we should all strive for perfection to get better results at what we do.  But so many products out there are imperfect, yet highly successful

not perfectionism, far from it

they just need to solve scaling

I heard that ETH community may split about future of ETH (but unsure of anything but as there are several futures possible, people want to choose a side)

[03-May-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
@meatspoon i am guessing i have a bit more tech background that you do. my assessment is that ETH has a very difficult tech problem to solve and certainly they can transition to PoS and fill the need for easy to write low volume dapps, but the GAS model is just too expensive for any mass market usage

[03-May-19 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe going to PoS, they can do tricks to get fast block times to push scaling that way for a bit, but who can sync an ETH chain from scratch as it is now?

having all transactions going to a main chain , but having it separated out into different shards and making that accurate and secure...

[03-May-19 06:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
You have loads more technical knowledge than I do!  Like, orders of magnitude more.  And I enjoy hearing your thoughts

[03-May-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it is beyond me to solve such things and so they better have a lot of devs that are a lot better than me

[03-May-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
but still they have the GAS model...

[03-May-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it is CPU mining vs ASIC, or more KMD is like fpga mining

[03-May-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
but I agree with you that ETH is here to stay and it has already achieved its success

[03-May-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
but it doesnt solve the scalable smart contract problem, so there is room for some other project to solve that
