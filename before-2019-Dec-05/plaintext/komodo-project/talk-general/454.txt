i can confirm it fails on my ledger nano s running fw 1.6.0
worked fine for months on any versions below that
v 1.6.0 changed ui drastically, maybe internals were refactored as well hence the issues

not really sure
just checked and it's working fine on my electrum wallet fork (python)
i was able to sign and broadcast kmd claiming transaction just fine using ledger nano s fw 1.6.0
so it must be an issue with web alone

If upbit says they will cover the losses, doesnt this mean they need to buy 342k ETH?
