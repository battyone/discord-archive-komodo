🎆  Web DEX 🎆

[27-Sep-19 11:09 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I was told web wallets are unsafe - so how is webdex different ?

[27-Sep-19 11:12 AM] gcharang#6833
It is as safe or if not more than trading in a Centralised Exchange
it is certainly not recommended to hold huge amounts in a address generated by the web-dex
but accessibility wise, it is a huge improvement

[27-Sep-19 11:13 AM] Oszy#5734
web is only unsafe it it sends sensitive info like login seed over the internet, my guess it it can authenticate you locally without having to send your details to a server. after that everything is encrypted.

[27-Sep-19 11:14 AM] gcharang#6833
there can be extensions installed that have permissions to read all data in all webpages, which can be security holes

[27-Sep-19 11:15 AM] Oszy#5734
there's always that

[27-Sep-19 11:54 AM] gcharang#6833
the webdex itself won't transfer any privkeys/seed phrases over the internet, but the browser environment that surrounds the webdex can be a concern for security
if you trust your browser to login to a bank account or a centralised exchange, then our web-dex dealing with trading amounts should be ok as well

[27-Sep-19 12:13 PM] Acura#2748
A user is asking:  What about the storage or transmission of IP address, browser, operating system, etc.? So such data which are transferred when calling a www-address? (Webdex)

[27-Sep-19 12:19 PM] gcharang#6833
```
IP address, browser, operating system, etc.
```
these are basic data that are necessary to communicate over the internet
if they will be logged or not is a different issue
I think they won't be logged
we won't know the situation till we have launched it

[27-Sep-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
logged to where? it will be running as a localhost app

[27-Sep-19 12:23 PM] gcharang#6833
the server that serves the atomicdex webapp will know the ipaddress of a person requesting it

[27-Sep-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
the localhost "server"?

[27-Sep-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
like your node http://127.0.0.1:port

[27-Sep-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
that server?

[27-Sep-19 12:26 PM] gcharang#6833
I mean something like
web.atomicdex.io
where it will be hosted

[27-Sep-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i am not sure we are talking about the hosted version

[27-Sep-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
but yes, for a hosted version such info would be able to be logged

[27-Sep-19 12:29 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, the question was about webdex accessed though a browser

[27-Sep-19 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
through the browser to localhost vs webdex.atomicdex.io are totally different things

[28-Sep-19 09:18 AM] coingirl87#6489
Ok but its not wrong to use 6.0.13?

[28-Sep-19 09:20 AM] gcharang#6833
@coingirl87 lite mode should work ok
native mode will not work

[28-Sep-19 11:57 AM] coingirl87#6489
I only use lite mode :-)  do you know when there will be a new komodo wallet? Not a versus wallet

[28-Sep-19 11:58 AM] gcharang#6833
When AtomicDEX for desktop is released, that will most likely be the Komodo wallet

[28-Sep-19 11:59 AM] gcharang#6833
there is also another wallet in development by our team, that might come out before AtomicDEX desktop

[28-Sep-19 12:16 PM] coingirl87#6489
Ok thank you 👍 i hope desktop version of atomic dex will released this year?!

[28-Sep-19 12:17 PM] gcharang#6833
most likely by the end of the year

[28-Sep-19 02:06 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, but if people can't manage seed phrases, asking them to manage wallet.dats is going too far

I posted in the off topic channel, not sure if it's the best one or if you prefer to move it to another one.

I will never tag a group of such extraordinary creatures again for your time is far too valuable ( you too @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢, and so so many others like @Priva99 ) The only conceivable way I can ever repay you is by simply telling you how amazing u all are......

Gents who can answer in a plain English for General people to understand-Block #597,273 was mined 119 minutes after its parent.

This happened only 10 times in Bitcoin's history, last time in May of 2014.

Assuming blocks come in 10 minutes in average, this interblock time has a 0.000679% chance of occurring.

external coins become assets when they get dpow ?

[01-Oct-19 06:02 PM] Markus#5464
Does not look like dpow is very attractive for external or any coin with significant marketcap

[01-Oct-19 06:02 PM] phm87#7395
When they get dpowed, external coins can choose to migrate/become an assetchain or they can keep their external sourcd code such as Chips, GinCoin, GameCredits, Einsteinium and VRSC

[01-Oct-19 06:03 PM] phm87#7395
I am sad that ETC that had a 400 blocks reorg (deep reorg, double spent atk, 51%) did not ask to have dpow

[01-Oct-19 06:04 PM] phm87#7395
As ETC is not the first coin in terms of hashrate on ethash algo, many eth pools or huge farms can do similar attacks

[01-Oct-19 06:07 PM] phm87#7395
@Markus I was not yet into kmd community when ETC had a 51%, was it discussed here ?
From your trader point of view, does ETC have a significant marketcap ?

[01-Oct-19 06:25 PM] Markus#5464
@phm87 Im pretty sure it was discussed altho dont remember much about it 😋 I dont rly think of marketcaps mostly but what i meant was i dont see any other coin with similar marketcap to KMD using dpow.

[01-Oct-19 06:31 PM] phm87#7395
Did it ever happen a public demonstration of dpow vs 51% ?

I heard about emc2 at kmd meetups but I did not know that some public info was there (and by a researcher, that s cool)

[01-Oct-19 06:42 PM] phm87#7395
I was more thinking of creating 2 assetchains, 1 with dpow, add it on atomicdex (and on the 5 testnet exchanges that I know) then 51% both once per week for education purposes (then add a chdckpoint, ask testers to git pull, rebuild and resync).

[01-Oct-19 07:13 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
marketing team should advertise dPOW to exchanges more -> exchnages and their users have this in their interest and can put pressure on coins to install dPOW while it's cheap
