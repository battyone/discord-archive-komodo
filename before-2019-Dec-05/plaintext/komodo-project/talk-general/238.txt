It's cheaper for me to mine them 😛

all assetchains are minable

[24-Mar-19 03:50 PM] MyName#0491
well, most

I seem to recall a miner or two who became very happy mining two 0.0001 chains last year

obviously hashrate, timing, and markets play into it, but sometimes it does work

Most of Bitcoin’s Trading Volume is FAKE: Time to Wake the F*** Up?
Hands up, anyone who is surprised that a little-known crypto exchange that apparently had the largest bitcoin trading volume on CoinMarketCap has been exposed as a wash trading scam platform. In the world of crypto

Yeah coinbene has nowhere near the volume that they claim

How is it that bots doing wash trading is suddenly "news" to people?

@MyName most normies don't know. But the wash trading exchanges have their days numbered as well as high listing fees. Bittrex was the first to go to $0 fees

[24-Mar-19 09:49 PM] PTYX#6840
Coinbene is known to wash trade. There's been tons of reports on it. Also, most communities might know of washtrading but have never seen it in action. Recently, (I think it was Huobi) that added kmd and the volume was extremely high. Then it just dropped to almost nothing. Many of us noticed it.

[24-Mar-19 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
@PTYX they had a contest based on trading volume, makes sense that it dropped

[24-Mar-19 10:12 PM] PTYX#6840
@Alright yeah I remember it was a contest but the amount was very suspicious.
