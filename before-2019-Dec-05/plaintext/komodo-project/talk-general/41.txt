Hi! How can I generate a new  receive address from within Agama V0.2.41-Beta?

[08-Aug-18 06:42 PM] SHossain#0007
are you using Native mode or SPV/Lite mode

[08-Aug-18 06:42 PM] SHossain#0007
?

[08-Aug-18 06:43 PM] okthen#8167
Lite

[08-Aug-18 06:43 PM] SHossain#0007
when you start Agama wallet, select Lite mode for KMD or any other chain, you will be taken to login screen. there you can create a new passphrase which will generate a new address.

[08-Aug-18 06:43 PM] SHossain#0007
save the seed passphrase before you do anyting in a notepad

[08-Aug-18 06:43 PM] okthen#8167
ok thanks

[08-Aug-18 06:44 PM] okthen#8167
impossible to generate a new address in the same wallet?

[08-Aug-18 06:44 PM] crumb#2550
in lite (spv) mode only one address per seed

[08-Aug-18 06:44 PM] okthen#8167
ok clear

Morning, Komodo team!

[09-Aug-18 02:29 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
Have traded Komodo off and on based on a tip from a friend but am now looking to invest long-term. 😃

[09-Aug-18 02:30 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
Figured I better do a more thorough read-up on KMD and also join everyone here.

[09-Aug-18 02:54 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
Anyone around?

[09-Aug-18 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Bad time of day here, what were you looking for exactly?

[09-Aug-18 03:29 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
First interest is in the "rewards" system. I hadn't realized earlier that KMD offers rewards like staking coins. Tried to read up on this on your site, but it's a bit confusing.

[09-Aug-18 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Easily explained. You just need to make a transcation once a month and you get 5% (calculated over one year, not 5% each month)

[09-Aug-18 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You dont need to stake, or mine to get this. Most of the generated KMD comes from 5% APR.

[09-Aug-18 04:10 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
So, by sending KMD or receiving KMD, I'll get rewards sometime throughout the year?

[09-Aug-18 04:11 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
And this is based solely on having tokens in my wallet? I don't need to leave the wallet live like PoS coins?

[09-Aug-18 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No, there is an extra rule in the mining consensus that lets you spend more vouts, than you have vins based on a calculation of time.

[09-Aug-18 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the coins just "appear" when you make a transaction

[09-Aug-18 04:19 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
So, again, it can be either sending or receiving?

[09-Aug-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sending only.... It will start to accrue when it is received and stop accruing 1 month after it was received, and it will claim when it is sent.

[09-Aug-18 04:21 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
Ah, so I always have to send out. Got it.

[09-Aug-18 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You don't have to... it will just start to accrue again after you send it... Otherwise it will stop after one month.

[09-Aug-18 04:22 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
Right.

[09-Aug-18 04:23 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
Any good articles or primers on this topic?

[09-Aug-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not 100% sure on articles. I think if there is anything it will be in the FAQ of the website.

[09-Aug-18 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The 1 month was only recently changed from 1 year. It actrually activates at block 1 million, which is about 1 month away.

[09-Aug-18 04:26 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
Yeah, I already read the FAQ, which is what lead me here. 😛

[09-Aug-18 04:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ha yeah, there has been a lot of effort in creating new content to summarise things but there is still a lot. KMD is very large and complex, took me months to figure it all out.

[09-Aug-18 04:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bottom line is... make transactions get free coins.

[09-Aug-18 04:27 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
Got it.

[09-Aug-18 04:27 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
Thanks for taking the time, @blackjok3r! 😃

[09-Aug-18 04:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries

[09-Aug-18 05:26 AM] AkiraX#8269
@blackjok3r how are you?

[09-Aug-18 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah pretty good

[09-Aug-18 05:28 AM] AkiraX#8269
Still holding hush

[09-Aug-18 05:29 AM] AkiraX#8269
It's rough

[09-Aug-18 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha, holding nothing really.

[09-Aug-18 07:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@RyanInSiam you can also just use the agama wallet which has an easy claim intrest button which basically just sends your entire balance to yourself to have the accrued rewards added to your balance

[09-Aug-18 08:02 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
Perfect, @Cryptoon ! That's the wallet I just downloaded.

[09-Aug-18 08:02 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
Out of curiosity, can we also get rewards from using Coinomi?

[09-Aug-18 08:03 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
(If so, I fully understand I'd have to manually send out the coins and then get them back again.)

[09-Aug-18 08:04 AM] RyanInSiam#8426
Ah, nevermind. This is covered in @Acura 's link.

[09-Aug-18 12:27 PM] haha#6652
When will latency be fixed with kmd blockchains? I can't really have transactions taking anymore than a couple seconds

[09-Aug-18 12:27 PM] haha#6652
will chains be lightning network compatible?

[09-Aug-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
it goes in the mempool pretty instantly, why cant you wait for confirmations?

[09-Aug-18 12:51 PM] haha#6652
because i can't have people waiting long. payments should basically be instant

[09-Aug-18 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
it appears in the explorer within seconds. so why are people waiting long?

[09-Aug-18 12:56 PM] haha#6652
for confirmations

[09-Aug-18 12:56 PM] haha#6652
and finality

[09-Aug-18 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so you are saying lightning network is needed, but also confirmations are needed?

[09-Aug-18 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
you do realize lightning network transactions dont get confirmed until the channel is closed

[09-Aug-18 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
if LN payments are ok, then so should tx in a mempool that isnt confirmed yet, as those also show on the explorer. Then again I am using logic and not having some attempt to troll

[09-Aug-18 01:07 PM] xRobeSx#5136
KMD also has 1 minute blocks. TX's tend to confirm pretty damn fast

[09-Aug-18 01:08 PM] haha#6652
Yes but LN transactions are very,very trustable. Any disagreements go onchain

[09-Aug-18 01:08 PM] haha#6652
waiting 1 minute is something that I can't do

[09-Aug-18 01:09 PM] CHMEX#0686
Maybe you want to create your own assetchain with on demand blocks notarizing to KMD that might be more instant for you

[09-Aug-18 01:09 PM] xRobeSx#5136
CHIPS has LN and 10 second block times

[09-Aug-18 01:09 PM] haha#6652
Thanks xrobe

[09-Aug-18 01:09 PM] xRobeSx#5136
but chmex's idea of an assetchain is good too. All blocks are on demand

[09-Aug-18 01:10 PM] haha#6652
Last question, why use dpow?

[09-Aug-18 01:11 PM] xRobeSx#5136
dPoW allows you to have bitcoin level security on KMD or your own assetchain. 

TX's are notarized onto Bitcoin Blockchain so its protected by the btc's hashrate

[09-Aug-18 01:12 PM] haha#6652
Thanks

[09-Aug-18 01:12 PM] xRobeSx#5136
The bonus with dPoW, is that you can still use PoW, PoS, or both PoW/PoS as well

[09-Aug-18 01:12 PM] haha#6652
Also do you think sub second block times will ever be possible with dPoW

[09-Aug-18 01:14 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm not sure you'll get sub second block times with an assetchain.

[09-Aug-18 01:15 PM] xRobeSx#5136
dPoW it self only records every set amount of blocks.  So your assetchain would notarize to KMD every say 10 blocks.

[09-Aug-18 01:15 PM] xRobeSx#5136
and KMD notarizes to BTC every X blocks. Not every block is notarized

[09-Aug-18 01:15 PM] haha#6652

[09-Aug-18 01:24 PM] mirel | mindtame.net#7931
is there an official tx/s number out there that has been reached?

[09-Aug-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
20,000 TX/s of sendmany 100 (which was 800,000 payments per second)

[09-Aug-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
using 1024 chains.

[09-Aug-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
using a 64 chain cluster where all chains cna send coins to each other, we acheived ~7000 TX/s

[09-Aug-18 01:32 PM] mirel | mindtame.net#7931
thank you.... would you point me to a link of some sort... I want to distribute this information

[09-Aug-18 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181

The data it loads by default is simulated data, not confirmed. It was to stress test the stats gathering software.

thank you. I'm not a developer ... But I keep hearing good stuff about Komodo and I'm really thinking of investing in this. So I am now on research mode and I'm trying to spark conversations with different groups on themes like scalability, security, anonimity... etc.... and see what people have to say.

[10-Aug-18 07:58 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
That dragon mascotte is somehow not reflecting the serious business komodo means to be.
I see more and more coins being a copy of a smart contract coin offering fast transaction.. scalability etc.. 
Before it was copy that bitcoin.. now it is copy all the smartest looking coins offering the most..

Looking at Metaverse now..

[10-Aug-18 08:04 AM] ca333#0118
which dragon mascot @[TPUX] Djith Wattignies ? we dont have an official mascot. for a long time it was the Komodo Knight, not a dragon but that was removed from our official materials a long time ago.

In general - would you take Michellin or Duracell less serious because of the "Michellin man" or the "hyperactive Bunny"?
