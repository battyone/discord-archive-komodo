@grewalsatinder - Thank you for posting those JL conversations this morning.   Sometimes I wonder if I am crazy, or if I am beginning to actually understand this stuff.

I have KMD and people like yourself, Alright, ComputerGenie and JL to thank for it.

Really big hand to the community for all their patience and understanding through this.

I guess I have only acted just like a Cheerleader this whole time of this incident. I can't take any credit for the wonderful job the rest of the Komodo Team did.

[14-Jun-19 06:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
They are the real Gems of the team.

[14-Jun-19 06:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
See that's part of it too though.

[14-Jun-19 06:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It's not blind cheerleading and support, it's informed positions and ideas being broadly shared.

JL is the best damn teacher ever.  I asked for help one day and he said "try it" and it didn't work but I figured out why mnyself...

Or he can explain confusing concepts so that a 12 year old could understand.   That's how you know someone really knows their subject matter.

[14-Jun-19 07:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If it takes too long to explain, they don't understand it.

[15-Jun-19 12:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
hotness

yes straight hotness and dex appeal

I dont think he used hyperDeX

[15-Jun-19 12:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well there are 2 problems, hotness we have via hyperDEX, usability is being solved by mm 2.0

[15-Jun-19 12:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well 3rd factor that comes with the 2nd is liquidity, that is where all users need to play a part

We spent a year building it but the backend had issues, and they have basically redesigned the backend, waiting for that to be 100% then we can port the GUI

[15-Jun-19 12:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
i think what most people tend to overlook is the fact that it worked. and that is a revolution in itself. crypto was being swapped atomically back and forth to all corners of the globe for the first time in human history. those without the technical chops to play with it should stop bitching.

[15-Jun-19 12:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Whilst i agree, but that excludes 98% of the users

[15-Jun-19 02:02 AM] NNoperator#3835
every bit helps, but I guess whatever we can afford (for us regular joes) to help offset losses will pale in comparison to the hit James took to cover the theft.  But at least we can do our part to give the middle finger to the hacker.   They know they didn't earn what they stole, and are too maladjusted to be able to contribute in a worthwhile manor.   It's a pity that they waste any talent they might have to steal, therefore they are less than worthless.

after going through all this trouble?

[15-Jun-19 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems this is his way of getting enough KMD so the 5% will be a nice revenue stream.

[15-Jun-19 05:40 AM] PTYX#6840
True

[15-Jun-19 05:41 AM] PTYX#6840
Plus their untraceable coins right?

[15-Jun-19 05:41 AM] PTYX#6840
If he "stakes" them to an unrelated address

[15-Jun-19 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it would be hard to tell it apart from a normal spend

[15-Jun-19 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
in any case, i made all his coins fungible as we want to avoid having two types of KMD

Is it technical possible to mark specific coins as stolen?

[15-Jun-19 06:10 AM] coingirl87#6489
In fiat world every banknote have a unique code. When someone rob a bank, normaly the bank know the unique codes and the bank notes can be mark as stolen...so its difficult for thief to use them

[15-Jun-19 06:11 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
unless the thief are your banks and goverments

[15-Jun-19 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem with marking them as stolen is that it creates two different KMD, one that is worth maybe a lot less. and who gets hurt in that case? the small company or individual who dont have the resources to keep up with all the realtime changing state of the blockchain

[15-Jun-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
a bit part of value of crypto is its unforgeable nature

[15-Jun-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
but if there are two classes of KMD, then one seems like a forgery

[15-Jun-19 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810
so losing fungibility is actually quite a big issue and over time this is an attack vector against crypto

[15-Jun-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
notice that it involves getting all the centralized govt establishment all involved in crypto, with the power to look the other way, or to pursue a minor infraction to absurd extremes, at their discretion

[15-Jun-19 06:44 AM] LocoMB#8593
big govs are certainly trying to get a grip on crypto ..just look at Fifi Lagardes talk she gave a cpl months back. she displayed an utter incomprehension of money, crypto, and liberty and free markets, but an even greater drive to edge in on it

_c) Privacy

The third benefit of digital currency I would like to highlight lies in the privacy domain. Cash, of course, allows for anonymous payments. We reach for cash to protect our privacy for legitimate reasons: to avoid exposure to hacking and customer profiling, for instance.

Consider a simple example. Imagine that people purchasing beer and frozen pizza have higher mortgage defaults than citizens purchasing organic broccoli and spring water. What can you do if you have a craving for beer and pizza but do not want your credit score to drop? Today, you pull out cash. And tomorrow? Would a privately-owned payment system push you to the broccoli aisle?

Would central banks jump to the rescue and offer a fully anonymous digital currency? Certainly not. Doing so would be a bonanza for criminals._

[15-Jun-19 06:57 AM] LocoMB#8593
... aaaand about the wonderful solution that a central bank run blockchain would provide:
_The advantage is clear. Your payment would be immediate, safe, cheap, and potentially semi-anonymous. As you wanted. And central banks would retain a sure footing in payments. In addition, they would offer a more level playing field for competition, and a platform for innovation. Meanwhile your bank, or fellow entrepreneurs, would have ensured a friendly user experience based on the latest technologies._
