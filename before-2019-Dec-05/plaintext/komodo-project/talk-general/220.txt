"the bug is fine, people saying otherwise are wrong"

[28-Feb-19 01:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
great way to handle issues on a closed source app that charges tens of  thousands of dollars for listing.

[28-Feb-19 01:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
``` After the dust settles we all need to remember the names of those who chose self-assertion over general public safety and acted irresponsibly.```

This comment really says more about coinomi than about the people involved in disclosing.

[28-Feb-19 01:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Implying @lukechilds is irresponsible in this "official" article is quite telling of your management as a company. How in the world you try to blame the people disclosing the bug instead of getting your security straight? Its not like you are not making money and have a for profit interest with your code, so please, get your shit together before trying to blame people of the open community for your own flaws. @Angelos | Coinomi Wallet there is only one irresponsible and that is coinomi.

@siu - Chainmakers hitting the nail on the head right there

[28-Feb-19 01:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im sure they charge at least $50k per coin listed and that is in the low level, also they charge thousands of dollars for monthly maintenance.

If the issue is a non event then make a public proof that it is a non event and move on.

[28-Feb-19 01:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Blaming and calling the people disclosing it (no matter the method used) is just a shitty way to handle this.

[28-Feb-19 01:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

Coinomi must be far removed from any sense of reality to come in here and attempt to glaze things over after that Medium article, incredible

[28-Feb-19 01:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, i find it quite disrespectful towards lukechilds and the KMD community in general.

[28-Feb-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
Also, they most certainly don't realize that lukechilds in a KMD notary node operator who helps to secure the entire KMD network and all coins that rely on DPoW. Luke was acting in the interest of the greater good, nothing to do with his own self-interest

[28-Feb-19 02:13 PM] Regnar#6164
Not to mention they posted an official medium article with about half of it talking about Luke and a completely unrelated event in an attempt to discredit someone who simply verified the bug. 
Again, footnote 2 shows you dont know if Google saved these seeds, and the screenshot of the 400 error says nothing about if this was Always the case, or if it is just the case right now. How long has this bug been in the app? How long has it been sending seeds to Google, and at what point did these start returning 400s instead of being processed? Did the spellcheck feature always NOT work in the app, or did it break sometime after it was created. 
For all these questions and your own admitted uncertainty in if Google actually saved this stuff, you sure are certain about trying to drag open devs through the mud, and publicly claiming you're going to sue a panicking guy who lost his money and felt he was robbed by you. Anyone who works in customer service is used to upset customers throwing around threats, they are under no obligation to act professionally, you on the other hand are.

[28-Feb-19 02:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Luke was acting in the interest of the greater good, nothing to do with his own self-interest`
Like I told someone earlier:
I don't really know luke that much, but from what I do know I find it hard to imagine that he posted in the wild and *then* they found out
Anyone that spends that much time on a singular issue that they personally don't *need* and benefits others for free, just doesn't do things that way

[28-Feb-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
until coinimi wallet is open sourced and then has some time to be verified, i cannot recommend anybody to use it at all, despite whatever assurances are given

[28-Feb-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
I cant see how that makes me irresponsible. We have the technical facts that clearly show privkey data went to where it shouldnt have. whether it was then actually exploited or not is a he said/she said debate which I dont really want to get into. The fact is that passphrases were sent to external servers, which is worse than if passphrases were sent to coinimiservers

[28-Feb-19 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
being closed source, there is no way to know how many other issues are buried

[28-Feb-19 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if the security promise of coinimi is that it is as secure as central exchanges, then upon that level of security, maybe people can decide to use it

[28-Feb-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
is the mobile client open source?

[28-Feb-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
is there a guarantee that there are no more bugs?

[28-Feb-19 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
with open source there is no guarantee, but at least other coders can look at it. with closed source, well, it can be sending your passphrase in for spellchecking to google servers and nobody would know it without detailed analysis

at least not when passphrases are involved

[28-Feb-19 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
for infrastructure things without passphrases, it seems closed source is not any big issue. probably most people dont have all the source code for their ISP, VPN or VPS provider

Here's the post about Luke reporting issues to Coinomi github before, this is about what Coinomi called Luke out for in their official medium post. If you're having a hard time finding Luke's github comments to them, its because Coinomi deleted them, so use the Waybackmachine links provided.

Luke: Do these insecure alternatives also use plain text?

[28-Feb-19 04:01 PM] Regnar#6164
I personally think the issue isn't necessarily the closed source aspect, people have varying levels of trust in brands and companies, but how the issue was handled by customer service was the problem. They took someone who knew it was closed source and entrusted it anyway, and held him at arms length while he panicked over losing funds. 
Almost every message they sent him was accusatory and short, or some type of command. There was no personal understanding, they even quoted his word "stolen" to openly show they didn't believe him. Basically saying "you're a scammer, and your life changing issue doesn't mean shit to us, but Skype with us and bring all forms of ID." Which read as a challenge to a scammer, not as a company trying to resolve a customer's issue. They didn't even have to promise a refund, although he said that's what he wanted and he gave them an ultimatum (blackmailer isn't the way you describe customers either!) Anyone who has been in business knows that upset customers say shit they dont always mean and make threats, the best bet is to LISTEN, EMPATHIZE, and cool the situation down to get to the real problem and try and resolve it if you can. I could teach a course about how Coinomi botched this customer service and lead to a forced ultimatum and tons of negative press.

Then again @Deleted User you may be right about closed source, I'm a business person more than I'm a programmer, so I mostly see business problems/solutions. Basically that saying, when you're a hammer all you see is nails. Lol

however is running those social media accounts is basically numb to many facts

[28-Feb-19 04:10 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea the Twitter account is one of the most unprofessional I've seen in any industry. Posting tweets saying they're going to sue someone, getting into a prolonged argument in dozens of posts, then deleting things they said in haste which were legal threats or contradictory. Whoever's running that Twitter needs to put down the phone and take a walk to cool off and breathe

[28-Feb-19 04:20 PM] Regnar#6164
Customer care is one of the hardest jobs, everyone blames you for every issue, you get threatened a lot. It's all about defusing situations, not letting ultimatums and threats become reality

[28-Feb-19 04:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah, the deny till you die strategy does not work, blaming anyone else other then yourself is not helping either...

[28-Feb-19 04:35 PM] Regnar#6164
I usually started by showing that I'm a person and not just an automated response lol approaching them as a person and showing that you absolutely understand how stressful the situation is and that you are personally going to work to resolve it, then say what it is you are doing and why you are asking particular questions, not just "Please provide this" "we are working on your claim." "please report responsibly" or w.e. Considering Warith believed someone at Coinomi backdoored him, it's probably best to break the image of Coinomi into individuals, the one he's speaking with being one who likely had no control over the issue and wants only to resolve it.
I'm also assuming Coinomi isn't reading any of these anymore, which is a shame, we're basically giving customer service 101, which based on their current twitter posting, they desperately need.
