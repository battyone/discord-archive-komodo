Guessing you didn't whitelist the barterdex exe or the marketmaker one

[23-Sep-18 12:45 AM] Hermes#6934
@Pumba  just to be sure you have a 64 bit PC right? Also make sure that is not blocked by any AV

@Hermes  yep just unblocked it from bull guard looks like im in, i just generated a passphrase and wrote it down, do i just use this to log in if i have sent funds not sure really how it all works

[23-Sep-18 09:55 AM] TonyL#3577
@Pumba Please use your passphrase to login (input it to the "passphrase" field and click login). It's happens that loading hangs in case of empty passphrase input

Just in case here is the beginning of the guides for Barterdex https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024449-barterdex-explanation-and-basic-functions

[23-Sep-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
recent updates allow a 100% private chain to be notarized. ok, so that makes it so the notarization tx are not z-transactions, but only notaries can even send a transparent tx. the coinbase is also required to be transparent, but all else must be a z transaction. Once dPoW is active, this will be the most private blockchain with BTC level security. Unfortunately, it cant to CC, or even multisig. it is purely a z-transaction coin. which also means it is basically technically complete now!

[23-Sep-18 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
Its emission will be 200 million coins, with a halving every 10 months or so. current blockreward and for the next 9 months is 256 PIRATE. #pirate for more info.

Why change the emission?

[23-Sep-18 08:40 PM] bishop#9773
CHIPs situation?

[23-Sep-18 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it was on pace to halving every 2 months and within 2 years the blockreward too small

[23-Sep-18 08:41 PM] bishop#9773
got it

[23-Sep-18 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
likely enough time to solve it, but this way there is 10 years to solve the issue

[23-Sep-18 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
since we didnt hit the first halving yet, nobody was effected

[23-Sep-18 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
granted a theoretical dilution of the existing PIRATE holders, but pretty sure all agree that it is better to have a 10 year emission than 2 years

[24-Sep-18 07:09 AM] eclips#1570
hi

[24-Sep-18 07:09 AM] eclips#1570
why dPOW and not opentimestamp  ?

[24-Sep-18 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
how can you tell if a blockhash is protected by a timestamp? the whole point is to be able to tell apart competing blocks, that will have very similar timestamps

[24-Sep-18 02:28 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Yoo.. question.
Can i swap kmd for chainzilla on hyperdex?
What fees?

[24-Sep-18 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yoo.. answer.
Yes.
Should be ~2-3x "standard" tx fees if you're selling to an existing buyer

@CryptoSabo @satoshillN @CryptoCoinsNews I just like talking facts. Its also quite brave to call komodo better tech with 120x slower blocks times than EOS but we. Why would you even need so many tps while platform is completely unusable XD

5% yearly of everything you hold

How much Komodo Tokens will there be isgasamt or how much is there in total?

[24-Sep-18 08:43 PM] SHossain#0007
Komodo is not a token, but a coin. It is expected to reach 200 Million over the course of next 12 years.

[24-Sep-18 08:44 PM] eduard#6056
ok, Thanks

[24-Sep-18 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
in 1000 years, there will still be less than a billion KMD

[24-Sep-18 09:19 PM] Tommyboy50#3199
In 1000 years I doubt there'll be much of anything the way we're going

[24-Sep-18 09:21 PM] Tommyboy50#3199
Some really good entries on reddit

[24-Sep-18 09:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
In 1000 years @jl777c will be coding KMD 9.8 and all will be good

PIRATE notarizations has started. only 9 months left before halving

[25-Sep-18 08:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
In my spare time today I figured out my future  :yassinkomodo: Accumulate 100,000 kmd, wait for 7.5b marketcap. Sell with 50% cgt discount and pay taxman to avoid jail time. Walk away with $7,000,000. Buy a 1m waterfront house, invest 4m with expected returns of 5.5% pa after inflation, leaving me with 220,000 interest per year, half to family half to retirement fund. Leave 1m in Komodo claiming 5% per year. 250k in gold and silver bullion as emergency. 250k for travelling the world and eating lobster daily for a year or 2, 500k to fuck around with for the first year including cars boats and a fuck load of cocaine and lsd

[25-Sep-18 08:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
Then retire quietly in some little country with no fucks to give 😛

I mean to be fair it isn’t unreasonable for us to get to the 5-7b marketcap should things go decently well and for the crypto market to see a semi run up from these levels

[25-Sep-18 08:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
Here’s to the crypto gods looking over kmd 🍻

[25-Sep-18 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the more specifically you visualize something, the more focus it has and the more likely for it to become real

[25-Sep-18 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
of course the less likely something is to happen, the more energy you need to put into your visualization, like actually working toward it

[25-Sep-18 08:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
Funny how law of attraction, Buddhism, some of the hippy third eye theories and some ancient magick practises all tie in together with the whole visualise -> reality idea

[25-Sep-18 08:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
You have vision so I’m sure Komodo is in good hands 🦎

[25-Sep-18 09:08 AM] actionslacks#4072
cocaine and lsd seems like an interesting combination. never tried that one

[25-Sep-18 09:09 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
sounds like 'the secret' to me jl

[25-Sep-18 09:11 AM] snowdamn#2414
useless combination but what do i know lol 😶

[25-Sep-18 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
strong visualization makes you stop doing things that dont contribute toward the vision

[25-Sep-18 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
once other people also share the vision, you get more and more people doing things to help actualize it

[25-Sep-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
really, it is a matter of probabilities.

[25-Sep-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
that is why quantum physics and spiritualism have a lot in common at the core, two sides of the same coin

[25-Sep-18 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
We are looking for someone to very actively market PIRATE

[25-Sep-18 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
it is complete and the most private chain in all of crypto that is also secured by dPoW

[25-Sep-18 09:18 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Head over to #pirate for OTC trading and more information!

[25-Sep-18 09:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
otc trading only?

[25-Sep-18 09:21 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
At the moment yes

[25-Sep-18 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
cant atomic swap PIRATE

[25-Sep-18 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it is only for private tx

[25-Sep-18 09:23 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
And as JL has spoken about before, Pirate would be most beneficial being on a CEX

[25-Sep-18 09:35 AM] snowdamn#2414
can't really get into the assetchain thing with KMD still low

[25-Sep-18 09:35 AM] snowdamn#2414
i can see promoting the feature, but not particular chains

[25-Sep-18 09:36 AM] snowdamn#2414
instamine assetchain galore will hurt Komodo at this stage IMHO

[25-Sep-18 09:36 AM] snowdamn#2414
i understand PIRATE has a unique feature, but it's not the 1st to be promoted

[25-Sep-18 09:37 AM] snowdamn#2414
Komodo has a long way to go it seems...

[25-Sep-18 09:40 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think if it coincides with agama integration and some tutorials on z transactions it could be an attention getter

[25-Sep-18 09:42 AM] snowdamn#2414
attention getter maybe due to it having something unique (which won't be true for other assetchains), but many resources and dev sweat away from Komodo with these assetchains, etc.

[25-Sep-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
It took me less than a weekend to add dPoW to PIRATE

[25-Sep-18 09:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
sometimes little side projects blossom into their own things

[25-Sep-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
and PIRATE is its own thing

[25-Sep-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the concept of independent chains is that they are independent

[25-Sep-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
why should all KMD chains have to somehow be centrally coordinated with KMD?

[25-Sep-18 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if a chain is complete and ready to go, it is complete and ready to go

[25-Sep-18 09:49 AM] snowdamn#2414
yes, this is why i said promoting the feature itself will probably be more beneficial at this stage

[25-Sep-18 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
the fact that KMD ecosystem was able to spawn a PIRATE with very little incremental effort is a testament to the power of KMD

[25-Sep-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and a pure privacy coin secured by dPoW has a place in the cryptosphere, independent of KMD, but everybody that encounters PIRATE will not be able to ignore KMD

[25-Sep-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is with independent chains marketing independently, we reach independent markets

[25-Sep-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
and how that is a bad thing escapes me
