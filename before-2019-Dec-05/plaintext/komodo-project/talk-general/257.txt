in PoW mining this is sidestepped by just defining that the one with most hashrate is the real chain, but it doesnt work so well in other cases unless it is very very carefully designed

I think this is a major first in the US, where you previously could only pay taxes with USD.  In Ohio it is now legal to pay your state taxes with BTC.   https://www.marketplace.org/2019/04/08/world/ohio-experiments-bitcoin-tax-payments

Oh how I miss the '80s sometimes when I see all the stuff we used to play with. The computers back then had a certain grace and appeal to them, and as long as I live they will be retro to the degree that I always wish they would come back in some new incarnated form. Even tho...

It has to be intuitive but most importantly it has to work. If you walk away from it, orders can't disappear or get locked so you have to do mental gymnastics to unlock the funds.

`not exactly equal to centralized systems`
true, but if JoeX on the other side of the world "took" the trade you though you were going to, then your trade dies, and that's a fact of P2P that we all have to live with

[09-Apr-19 03:33 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Having good ux doesn't imply that it must work like centralized thing, you can be decentralized and still have a good experience. It only means trying to have as a good ux as possible. And that makes all the difference between having a small niche userbase or a much larger market

`HyperDEX' success proves it.`
I spent 2 weeks trying to use that thing and got 1 trade; so, ymmv

[09-Apr-19 03:36 PM] Regnar#6164
I still think a good initial step to get liquidity and orders up are to convert those who are already providing liquidity to other p2p trading and are cool with 24/7 uptime. My recommendation was OpenBazaar crypto-crypto sellers. I see no reason for them to be using escrow or just trust when we could have great partnership

[09-Apr-19 03:37 PM] Regnar#6164
I doubt OB would be cool with BarterDEX fees though, I think that's against their whole model

[09-Apr-19 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
actually it is, because it's forced electrum which sux for those of us that don't live in a metropolis

[09-Apr-19 03:39 PM] PTYX#6840
I was able to use hyperdex during its first releases. Towards the last ones I complained about not being able to complete a single trade in months

[09-Apr-19 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
mm2 doesn't magically make electrum suck less

[09-Apr-19 03:41 PM] SHossain#0007
but, overall impression is better with MM2 + electrum

[09-Apr-19 03:41 PM] SHossain#0007
compared to MM1 version + electrum

[09-Apr-19 03:42 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I was able to do dozens of swaps on win using  electrum with mm1 GUI ,   It worked and I‚Äôm not too tech minded. Main thing I found the problem was the JS side of things

[09-Apr-19 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
if the guy that's producing 99% of SN blocks can't make a SN trade on electrum (that he can make native), there's an issue with electrum (or the "just an interface" that's forcing him to use electrum is actively blocking it)
imo

[09-Apr-19 03:45 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`because of mm1`
is horseshit
I literally was making thousands of trades native

[09-Apr-19 03:45 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, native performed solid

[09-Apr-19 03:45 PM] SHossain#0007
electrum has/had few downsides

[09-Apr-19 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
mm1 has its issues, but electrum compounds it

[09-Apr-19 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
mm1 didnt have any electrum support intended

[09-Apr-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
after it was working, electrum support was added, but of course it wasnt exactly designed in

[09-Apr-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
so it depends on reliable electrum servers, but they disconnect after 10 errors. cipi modified it to wait until 1000 errors

[09-Apr-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the fact that via cli it works much better indicates the issue is electrum

[09-Apr-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so having a gui that uses the mode that is less reliable.... give us the choice of easier to user gui with less reliable electrum, or harder to use barterDEX gui with native

[09-Apr-19 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
if hyperdex worked with native, then i would imagine it would have been just fine, but then people will say that "nobody wants to run a full node"

[09-Apr-19 04:03 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`if hyperdex worked with native, then i would imagine it would have been just fine`
imo, it would have been better than "just fine" and as pretty as it is I likely would be its greatest proponent

[09-Apr-19 04:15 PM] PTYX#6840
if it works, it works

[09-Apr-19 04:15 PM] PTYX#6840
the hyperdex definitely didn't work most of the time

[09-Apr-19 04:16 PM] PTYX#6840
