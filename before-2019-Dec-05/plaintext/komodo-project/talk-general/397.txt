Would be great if there was a short article which clearly explains the costs of running a blockchain on Komodo/AWS

Also maybe  plugins for building things with Komodo chains on Wordpress could be a good idea...I saw this yesterday for Ethereum (they are also quite expensive by the way):

On the composer, could it make sense to offer a super barebones "starter blockchain", on a monthly instead of annual basis? To entice people to play a bit ...

Running Windows Verus Agama and blockchain seems to be stuck at 1444268.  Is there something going on that I don't know about?
Nothing crashed that I know of, and Agama has been running continuously for a few days, at least.

@suhthern-girl which version of Verus Agama you are running?

You must use 0.5.7-4 version

[17-Jul-19 11:03 AM] suhthern-girl#8418
Ok.  Thanks.  I take it that is newer than the one we were told to use right after the compromised key bug was found.

I'm using Verus Agama v0.6.0-13

And now for real. Swapped @ethereum for $KMD on @AtomicDex in 7 minutes. 
Try to send funds to a #CEX, trade and send back to a wallet in 7 minutes

Won’t be needing that $ETH anymore anyway. $KMD is the future!

Hello everyone! Hope you're all doing well.

I'm wondering what the best wallet would be for a new user using Windows 7. Is the Komodo Agama wallet still compromised? If so, would the Verus Agama wallet be a good substitute in the meantime? Thanks!

[17-Jul-19 04:43 PM] Lennart#9331
yes, use Verus Agama

[17-Jul-19 04:43 PM] Lennart#9331
this is kinda the official wallet now

[17-Jul-19 04:44 PM] Lennart#9331
you can use KMD in lite mode, claim rewards and also it supports a lot of ecosystem coins like VRSC, RFOX, K64, PIRATE...

Under FinCEN regulations, a person is exempt from money transmitter status if the person only provides the delivery, communication, or network access services used by a money transmitter to support money transmission services.72 Consistent with this exemption, if a CVC trading platform only provides a forum where buyers and sellers of CVC post their bids and offers (with or without automatic matching of counterparties), and the parties themselves settle any matched transactions through an outside venue (either through individual wallets or other wallets not hosted by
the trading platform), the trading platform does not qualify as a money transmitter under FinCEN regulations.73 By contrast, if, when transactions are matched, a trading platform purchases the CVC from the seller and sells it to the buyer, then the trading platform is acting as a CVC exchanger, and thus falls within the definition of money transmitter and its accompanying BSA obligations.74
