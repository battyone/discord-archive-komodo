then, is it not available through
"select wallet name" -> input password 
method in the login screen?

[27-Jun-19 11:25 AM] Roxin#4844
i arrive home in 20 minutes..and try again what you say

[27-Jun-19 11:25 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, you should have given it a name and set a password
that should allow you to login

[27-Jun-19 11:26 AM] Oszy#5734
@gcharang Verus Agama does that? I thought it was only in 0.3.6 KMD Agama

[27-Jun-19 11:26 AM] Oszy#5734
I have Verus Agama never set a main password there

[27-Jun-19 11:26 AM] Oszy#5734

[27-Jun-19 02:53 PM] eBit#9525
I found out about the Agama exploit last night by logging into my wallet to stake my coins and seeing that the entire balance was moved to another address.  It was a pretty horrible feeling.  After reading about what happened, it looks like the balance was moved to a safe address. I submitted the claim form for the original amount, but there's also a rewards amount that was generated when the balance was moved. That amount was moved to an address different from the first one hours after the original transfer out. Will this balance also get sent back, or do I need to submit a separate claim for that?

[27-Jun-19 02:57 PM] eBit#9525
@Deleted User  I just submitted the form. I haven't received anything yet.

Did the rfox team contacted someone from Komodo team for advice on how to handle the airdrop to zex holder since the vulnerability of agama wallet ?

[27-Jun-19 09:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
isn't there a couple "someones" on the rfox team on the komodo team? 😕

[27-Jun-19 10:29 PM] BL0ckchain#6564
Dont know but the ping pong between zaddex and rfox is killing me and the only answer is « we are working on it jus check the announcements » with the quick reaction on the agama vulnerability from the dev i was thinking that find a way to make this airdrop was cake

Please remember that zaddex has no control over rfox airdrop

[28-Jun-19 12:08 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Benny originally started zaddex, but signed over to let OCU handle the exchange. The airdrop was to reward early contributors, but we have no control over when and where the airdrop will be occuring

[28-Jun-19 12:08 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
