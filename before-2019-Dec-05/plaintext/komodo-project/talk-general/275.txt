Research and the Internet.  

It only takes 50 keystrokes to claim someone is a scammer.  

And yet 50 months of solid peer reviewed work  will go unnoticed.  

If the truth is too difficult to understand, create your own narrative.  That’s usually what the weak minded do.

[19-Apr-19 08:40 PM] Markus#5464
what is the idea behind that?

[19-Apr-19 08:40 PM] Markus#5464
something like a decentralised smartcontract leverage betting?

[19-Apr-19 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, for any synthetic position constructed out of prices at http://159.69.45.70:8050/ and the iex stock list

what will happen in worst case if contract runs out of money and someone wins more then the contract holds?

[19-Apr-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
they would collect whatever is left

[19-Apr-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
and we make a new iteration with different rules so it wont bankrupt

[19-Apr-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why i need help of someone who does real trading risk management

[19-Apr-19 08:47 PM] Markus#5464
Alright

[19-Apr-19 08:51 PM] Markus#5464
Will it have similar "interest funding" like bitmex where u need to pay something like 0,007% in fee every 24 hour?

[19-Apr-19 08:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it is interest free

[19-Apr-19 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
also first version is charging fees on amount bet, not the leveraged amount

[19-Apr-19 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if that will survive testing

[19-Apr-19 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i want it where the fees are much less than bitmex, where you can bet on nearly infinite different things, using larger leverage, fully decentralized

[19-Apr-19 08:53 PM] Markus#5464
and the contract is going to check the price of lets say btc through the trustless prices cc?

[19-Apr-19 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is what the trustless oracles enables

[19-Apr-19 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
the first of many

[19-Apr-19 08:54 PM] jl777c#5810
the other is a decentralized stable coin/loan against crypto via pegs CC

[19-Apr-19 08:54 PM] Markus#5464
thats amazing

[19-Apr-19 10:07 PM] phm87#7395
But about real trading risk management, he explained to us the rules (pro traders that are employees are fired if they do not respect these rules), I'll try to find one of his tweet to illustrate

[19-Apr-19 10:15 PM] Regnar#6164
Thanks for thinking of me, but I haven't done much financial modeling, at least not enough to consider myself a professional.

Hey guys, have been doing my research about KMD lately and found out how great are the fundamentals

[20-Apr-19 03:47 AM] caribou#3049
Anyway, I have a noob question. Which is the point of staking? I don't get that as it is a PoW coin

[20-Apr-19 03:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
technically not staking

[20-Apr-19 03:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
details here - https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024428-komodo-5-active-user-reward-all-you-need-to-know

[20-Apr-19 03:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
note `Active` User Reward. Funds must move monthly to receive reward.

[20-Apr-19 03:55 AM] caribou#3049
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Thx bro. I see the reward plan in that link. I was meaning about how does staking contributes to the project? Something to do with consensus or what?

[20-Apr-19 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It really depends on what you mean by staking. The 5% KMD reward is not staking. You an however stake chains liek OUR.

[20-Apr-19 03:58 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
do you mean to ask what's the purpose of the reward?

[20-Apr-19 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or KMDLABS when we luanch that

[20-Apr-19 03:58 AM] caribou#3049
@Gordon Komodo exactly 🙂

[20-Apr-19 03:59 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
simply to reward holders  😄

[20-Apr-19 03:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
incentive to hold and use, rather than pump and dump

[20-Apr-19 03:59 AM] caribou#3049
Ok, so "staking" has no impact at protocol level?

[20-Apr-19 04:00 AM] caribou#3049
Fair enought

[20-Apr-19 04:00 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it isnt part of consensus

[20-Apr-19 04:03 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
PoW does consensus, and DPoW checkpoints it to BTC at a relatively low cost to Notary Nodes. Notary nodes are rewarded by occasional period of easy mining. Active user reward balances holder value vs Notary mining reward advantage. 
Election is currently underway, some more info here - https://komodoelection.com/1-about/notary-node-incentives/
