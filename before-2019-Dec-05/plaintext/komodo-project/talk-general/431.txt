I am offered 24 ARRR a few days ago for betting on k64. I will bet my 24arrr and take the position that k64 funding is real.

Somehow I just typed that but it’s hitting me really hard.  Like... really hard.   It’s like starting a car company and asking a stereo equipment company for their support, then saying that the cars don’t plan to include stereos and there’s no work being put toward that end.

with 84 cents?

[11-Sep-19 08:42 PM] joe2x4#5987
Could be $8.40 with the right odds

[11-Sep-19 08:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or you could turn $10k into $100k, if you have that faith
*$300k if you think the bet coin triples

I feel like I'm being hustled here. You gotta let me win one before taking all my money.

I'll up the ante, 24 ARRR and 30 k64

@Deleted User take away all of the blockchain community support for k64 and there are have literally no users.   

In before “ We didn’t get funding because we didn’t have support.”

You don’t have support from Blockchain communities because you don’t have Blockchain under development.
I shouldn’t have to explain this simple scenario.

Vendors such as the holographics people from the expo havent even been paid yet. If you have money you have it. If you dont you dont. There would be no reason not to pay suppliers at the risk of public fallout and fuel to the already raging fire. So if they dont have money yet and 'owe' money to suppliers and partners, they cant cancel contracts or just refuse to pay. The next point is the previous company was bankrupt 4 years ago. Investors wont touch that. Also 70% of all VC funding is based on team. VCs wont let CEOs and founders change during the funding round. This is investment 101. VCs sign founders to golden handcuffs. Also no VC would stand by and let what is unfolding happen. They would protect their investment. Simple. The last point is that E&Y cant pass an audit if there is outstanding invoices to suppliers etc. These must all be settled. This is a safe bet. $1.8 or $1800

@Deleted User 
    ☝️ He's right

All opinions. No evidence or no facts included, except that the previous company went bankrupt 4 years ago, and that would have to be checked.

[12-Sep-19 05:30 AM] Privatoshi#7913

[12-Sep-19 08:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Deleted User 

Other projects have been moved to the ecosystem archive just like K64, so it is not being singled out
K64 brings up drama that Komodo does not need and is a distraction and it has been discussed about on a daily basis for months. Let's get on with building things rather than argue over something we cannot prove.

[12-Sep-19 08:26 AM] Privatoshi#7913
Yup I have one of the better Vpns on that list

[12-Sep-19 08:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unbunch your panties and find a topic that doesn't involve "who's getting what revenue when?"

[12-Sep-19 08:27 AM] LocoMB#8593
@Deleted User the point is that everything about K64 _so far_ has been said, and running around in circles regurgitating the same 'what ifs' and coulda-shoulda-woulda is really inflammatory

[12-Sep-19 08:27 AM] LocoMB#8593
