[08-Oct-18 10:16 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

[08-Oct-18 10:16 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
got it

[08-Oct-18 10:17 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so it is only local and cam be 1111111

@SHossain  Not good enough, get your shit together, get it all in a bag and sell it at the shit store 😂

[08-Oct-18 10:17 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
as long as i trust my device is safe

[08-Oct-18 10:18 AM] ch6ris#5240
As I said earlier, JOB 👌

[08-Oct-18 10:18 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and if I like no pin? can I switch it off?

[08-Oct-18 10:19 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
well actually I cannot sign in somehow :/

[08-Oct-18 10:20 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
only create seed is possible, but not log in with a seed I know

[08-Oct-18 10:58 AM] loneSilentWolf#8570
Umm, so is the app secure enough to use and trust ?

[08-Oct-18 11:05 AM] loneSilentWolf#8570
the app is confusing. Nothing happens on sign in page, selecting a coin is doing nothing, nor is login, etc only seed is created 😂

[08-Oct-18 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i am sure the dev (pbca26) will be more than happy for constructive solutions to  the  ease of use issues

[08-Oct-18 12:16 PM] SHossain#0007
@loneSilentWolf Please wait for a bit. This is the initial release and our presence on official Android store. The development continues. We will push updates and upgrades as they become available and tested.

[08-Oct-18 12:24 PM] PTYX#6840
@loneSilentWolf it's more secure than a web wallet

[08-Oct-18 01:51 PM] D.rabbani#9094
Hi there the problem with the app.is with reducers as no values are passed in the .combine reducers

[08-Oct-18 01:51 PM] D.rabbani#9094
Thats what google chrome initiates :)

[08-Oct-18 01:52 PM] D.rabbani#9094
I am also stuck with the build.of an app hope it will work soon

[08-Oct-18 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@D.rabbani around here you need to be specific about "the app", there are many

[08-Oct-18 02:09 PM] D.rabbani#9094
Sorry the agama wallet one

Head over to #deleted-channel, they should be able to help

[08-Oct-18 02:14 PM] proabiral#6080
I have found a security vulnerability on one of your website.
Does komodo have bugbounty program where I can report it ?

[08-Oct-18 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain @PTYX @Hermes 👆🏼 ?

[08-Oct-18 02:16 PM] PTYX#6840
@proabiral yes, please contact @SHossain with all the details and he will move it along for further verification.

@benohanlon es el administrador de esa campaña. Si no me equivoco, la comunidad elije el mejor por medio de votaciones.

[08-Oct-18 04:03 PM] benohanlon#1119
@PTYX what does that mean in English? 😃

[08-Oct-18 04:04 PM] PTYX#6840
It means that you are the one managing the campaign and that if I'm not mistaken the community chooses the winner of the infographic contest via votes

[08-Oct-18 04:04 PM] PTYX#6840
He was asking about the mechanism of picking the winner

[08-Oct-18 04:05 PM] benohanlon#1119
community voting is part of it but ultimately it's a decision and vote by our team once finalists are announced @house

Hey guys so I've been away for awhile started up hyperdex for the first time today just wondering what happened to all the active asset chains like REVS DEX OR SUPERNET??

[08-Oct-18 04:34 PM] DynamicPimp#0206
Invested a lot last year into the three now wondering what happend....

[08-Oct-18 04:35 PM] jorian#4555
they still exist

[08-Oct-18 04:35 PM] jorian#4555
REVS pays out a revenue share, but since prices are low, there's not really a reason to do a payout

[08-Oct-18 04:35 PM] jorian#4555
same goes for DEX, since BarterDEX volume is quite low

[08-Oct-18 04:36 PM] jorian#4555
so it isn't collecting a lot of fees, so again no reason to do a payout now

[08-Oct-18 04:36 PM] jorian#4555
SUPERNET is a kind of fund, but again since all coins are down, SN is down too

[08-Oct-18 04:38 PM] jorian#4555
those assets are a long term investment anyways, imo

[08-Oct-18 06:53 PM] DRC#7445
@miketout  dude nice fricken work on the POS dilema 👌

[08-Oct-18 07:30 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
will komodo utilize "sapling" feature upgrade from zcash?

[08-Oct-18 07:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
to the extent of what is applicable, yes

[08-Oct-18 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
it will take a while to integrate all the changes, also it requires a hardfork, so it is scheduled to activate in KMD with next years new notary fork

guys, how legit is veruses solution of the PoS problems?

[09-Oct-18 02:51 AM] IP#9768
i mean i'm not a blockchain expert but i know Vitalik and Vlad are very intelligent and passionate about casper ffg so i believe that it is not that simple to make casper right hence the delay

[09-Oct-18 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Those guys just dont have crytpo conditions to solve the problem with.

[09-Oct-18 02:51 AM] IP#9768
and now out of nowhere comes veruscoin with their claimed to be 'ultimate' pos consensus

[09-Oct-18 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well they are, and he dev invented microsoft .net platform, so hes kind of smart.

[09-Oct-18 02:52 AM] IP#9768
so, the point is eth system is more complex? hence harder to solve pos problems?

[09-Oct-18 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
eth is full of bugs

[09-Oct-18 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very hard to fix

[09-Oct-18 02:52 AM] IP#9768
eth is awful code

[09-Oct-18 02:52 AM] IP#9768
fucking enormous

[09-Oct-18 02:52 AM] IP#9768
it is easier to rewrite it from scratch than fix it i'm afraid

[09-Oct-18 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah people around here were saying that all of alst year while it was mooning lol

[09-Oct-18 02:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the solutions being worked on here and Verus, are much better but I mightbe a bit biased seems I lonly know everyhting about this platform not not much of any others.

[09-Oct-18 02:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and now out of nowhere comes veruscoin with their claimed to be 'ultimate' pos consensus`
and now out of nowhere comes Satoshi with his claimed to be 'ultimate' solution for double spending

i'm not a pro coder but i worked with awful software. you could look up GAMESS (US)

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i'm just being cautious

[09-Oct-18 02:56 AM] IP#9768
better be safe and ask people than be sorry

[09-Oct-18 02:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
Im a little concerned about a vhs/betamax type deal where the inferior tech becomes more widely used because of market forces

[09-Oct-18 02:58 AM] IP#9768
there is still one problem i see with pos which cannot be solved in principal

[09-Oct-18 02:59 AM] IP#9768
how do we distribute the pos tokens in fair manner

[09-Oct-18 02:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
But when you’re talking about an information/asset infrastructure it seems like the superior solution should always rise to the top. But I mean, look at windows. Eth could become the windows of programmable contracts.

[09-Oct-18 02:59 AM] IP#9768
with pow people pay for equipment and electicity cost, so they mine and sell at market price. People are forced to sell mined coins to payback equipment and electricity bills

[09-Oct-18 03:00 AM] IP#9768
with pos somebody prints coins out of thin air and decides on how to ditribute them. And PoS coins you can just hoard and get richer and richer

[09-Oct-18 03:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@IP I'm not saying don't be cautious or even skeptical, just saying that one should never offhandedly dismiss a good idea just because it "came out of nowhere"

`But I mean, look at windows. Eth could become the windows of programmable contracts.`
@actionslacks you really believe ETH is *that* bad?

[09-Oct-18 03:05 AM] actionslacks#4072
I dont think eth is bad at all. Once it gets co-opted into some blockstream like entity I could easily see it becoming total shite though.

[09-Oct-18 03:06 AM] actionslacks#4072
Same with anything I guess

@IP  fair distrib of POS token does not exist because fairness does not exist -> it's just a concept and you can find many people who will call your fairness unfair. For example I call it unfare I was not able to buy BTC when it was 1$ :pirate: so why people believe in fair distribution as an argument at all? At best it can be elegant distribution...

[09-Oct-18 06:47 AM] IP#9768
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 well, question is not about absolute fairness but rather pow vs pos fairness

[09-Oct-18 06:47 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
most people comming do crypto this year will call it unfair they could not come 5 years ago... but what can you do ...

[09-Oct-18 06:47 AM] IP#9768
pow is much more fair in distributing tokens

[09-Oct-18 06:48 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
well but why POS vs POW fairness matters in other way then why it matters for people ?
