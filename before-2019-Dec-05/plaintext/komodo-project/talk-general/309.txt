@Audo  They may have used the correct logo, but they flubbed the rewards.  They seem to think rewards are still accruing at an annual time frame.  I left a comment, hopefully they will notify readers that annual only refers to the APR, funds need to move monthly at a minimum to effectively collect rewards...

Hi,
It seemed that something wrong with KMD server, I can't use Agama wallet properly. May I know when it will recover?

[24-May-19 06:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @Scarborough we investigating it at the moment

[24-May-19 06:03 AM] TonyL#3577
@Scarborough Which Agama version are you using?

[24-May-19 06:05 AM] Scarborough#9066
Thanks lot, I think it's the latest version.

[24-May-19 06:05 AM] Scarborough#9066
@TonyL

[24-May-19 06:06 AM] Scarborough#9066
Version 0.1.6

[24-May-19 06:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so it's mobile Agama?

[24-May-19 06:10 AM] Tac#1954
What's the difference  agama vs komodo ocean qt wallets

[24-May-19 06:11 AM] Scarborough#9066
Neither mobile nor desktop can work, thank you.

have you tried a differnt network?

[24-May-19 06:15 AM] Scarborough#9066
Yes, it doesn't help.
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

[24-May-19 06:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Tac main difference is Ocean is native (i.e. chain data stored locally, need to sync). It's worth downloading both to see which you prefer.

[24-May-19 06:17 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Agama can be lite or native

[24-May-19 06:17 AM] Tac#1954
Cool thanks

[24-May-19 06:18 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Scarborough , it seeems to be working on my end. What version of desktop Agama are you using, Lite or native, which operating system?

[24-May-19 06:23 AM] Scarborough#9066
Windows

[24-May-19 06:24 AM] Scarborough#9066
Should be native mode

[24-May-19 06:25 AM] Scarborough#9066
Both mobile and desktop show Connection Error

[24-May-19 06:26 AM] Scarborough#9066
Can't use button Transaction and Send

[24-May-19 06:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
mobile is not native. If desktop native has connection error, its not due to network. Needs full sync tho

[24-May-19 06:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
screenshots of error?

Turns out Microsoft Research were the real zero-knowledge wizards all along. Impressive work - zkSNARKs with no trusted setup, discrete log hardness, and sub-linear verification costs. https://t.co/jOdAEZgXCh

NEWS from  BTCH  ??? is there anything new ? http s://www.coinexchange.io/market/BTCH/BTC

[24-May-19 08:07 PM] Berg#2666
BTCH has been talked about with a few core KMD devs

[24-May-19 08:08 PM] Berg#2666
There were a lot of ideas tossed around, but at the moment there hasn't been a decisive course for it.

[24-May-19 08:08 PM] Berg#2666
It still does receive all KMD upgrades due to being a run-time fork

[24-May-19 08:09 PM] peddycb#5889
Ah, thanks for the information üêº  ‚úå  üêº

[24-May-19 08:15 PM] Berg#2666
Hopefully we can put together a task force sometime and dedicate a few developers to it, between HUSH and KMD

[24-May-19 08:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@peddycb now that HUSH has a new mainnet, BTCH is next in line for upgrades

[25-May-19 05:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Thank you for interest @Alecandro ! It's in closed beta stage at the moment, we'll announce as soon as testing will be public

[25-May-19 05:09 PM] Alecandro#1179

[25-May-19 05:16 PM] mobipoi#5774
Such a long wait for the DEX ,

[25-May-19 05:18 PM] mobipoi#5774
I am calling it 10 billion dollar valuation within 2.5years

[25-May-19 05:19 PM] mobipoi#5774
Dont quote me on this :)

[25-May-19 05:28 PM] yorklab#7270
I'm sure there will be plenty of people using the mobile DEX for the usual reasons, but imagine all the coins that will want to trade on the platform because they were delisted from other exchanges.

[25-May-19 05:31 PM] mobipoi#5774
Yes, and all the GUIs combined , but most importantly lower barrier to entry

[25-May-19 05:31 PM] mobipoi#5774
Which is an important source for growth

[26-May-19 06:27 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
So I hear that DP coin will likely be making the swap over to Komodo systems, as a response to the cryptopia event. Sounds interesting. Hopefully a good usecase can be established as that happens and the coin can finally find ground again. Trading has been great on their exchange, growing.
