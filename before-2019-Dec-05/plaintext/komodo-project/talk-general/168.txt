How are notary fees calculated?

[09-Jan-19 11:23 AM] jorian#4555
i meant BTC lightning in that sentence

[09-Jan-19 11:24 AM] jorian#4555
komodo and / or notary nodes have nothing to do with BTC lightning or KMD lightning or any lightning

[09-Jan-19 11:24 AM] jorian#4555
KMD lightning doesn't exist

[09-Jan-19 11:25 AM] garbonzo607#4659
Is there a free market mechanism or are the fees fixed?

[09-Jan-19 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
#kmdlabs is prusuing a free market model.... really doesnt seem easy....

[09-Jan-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
free market for what?

[09-Jan-19 11:25 AM] garbonzo607#4659
Notary fees

[09-Jan-19 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
however we can think to implement it make some centralised entity to control payments

[09-Jan-19 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am trying to work out a CC contract to pay notaries... but that requires all coins to use KMD AC.

[09-Jan-19 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
just want to clarify that it's a free market for *LABS* chains notarization fees and nothing else

[09-Jan-19 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once it has been made iit has been made anyone can use it

notary fees? you mean  BTC fees with that?

[09-Jan-19 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I assumed he meant the tx for notarisations ... requires coins

[09-Jan-19 11:29 AM] garbonzo607#4659
Notaries pay the BTC fees, right? They can use BTC Lightning to create the hash, right?

It has only kept increasing in usage. Why do you say it's a fantasy?

Sorry, what I mean is that wide spread adoption of it is a fantasy.

correct me if I am wrong anybody- but shouldn't 51% attack on a coin send its price drastically downwards?!?

[09-Jan-19 12:26 PM] Alright#0419
`Gate.io has raised the ETC confirmation number to 500 and launched a new strict 51% detect for enhanced protection. However, we suggest the ETC dev team and the community build a new consensus mechanism (PoS for example) to better protect ETC network from 51% attack.`

How much does it cost for an external blockchain to utilize Komodo's dPoW security features to secure their own blockchain??

[09-Jan-19 04:09 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
About 300kmd a year

[09-Jan-19 04:10 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
its like 0.60 to 0.70c a day currently. Crazy cheap

[09-Jan-19 04:11 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
There is also the dev time required to make the aditions

wowwwww that's crazy cheap. Can I tweet about that price?

[09-Jan-19 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think they have increased, recently. But I'm not on the team, so dont know exact numbers and things. Before you tweet about it, maybe ask someone who is on the team.

[09-Jan-19 04:16 PM] Alecandro#1179
anyone on the team care to answer that before I tweet about it?

@Alright "Sorry, what I mean is that wide spread adoption of it is a fantasy." Why?

[10-Jan-19 06:17 AM] Alright#0419
If it is widely adopted, it will be regulated to all hell. Imagine any large corp setting up payment channels. Do you think they'll allow just anyone to pay them or will they use services that introduce KYC?

[10-Jan-19 06:20 AM] garbonzo607#4659
"blockstream took something that was entirely viable and undermined it entirely in favor of lightning network which is arguably a centralized system" You can say Lightning is centralized, but still trustless. Centralization is the only way to achieve scalable blockchains, but the important part is BTC is the arbitrator if there's a dispute, so it's still trustless.

[10-Jan-19 06:21 AM] Alright#0419
`Centralization is the only way to achieve scalable blockchains` Are you aware of KMD's scaling efforts?

[10-Jan-19 06:21 AM] garbonzo607#4659
You don't have to use payment channels that require KYC. If there is economic need for no KYC, it will be so. Crypto is pure economics.

[10-Jan-19 06:22 AM] Alright#0419
My biggest problem with Lightning is that some middle man can say "we won't let you pay this corp". Surely the corp won't open payment channels with just anyone

[10-Jan-19 06:23 AM] Alright#0419
You will have to use payment channels that require KYC if it is widely adopted

[10-Jan-19 06:24 AM] garbonzo607#4659
"`Centralization is the only way to achieve scalable blockchains` Are you aware of KMD's scaling efforts?" No, that's why I asked how Komodo will use side channels. I don't see how you scale without side channels. If you're writing things to multiple places, that's going to be less efficient than writing to one place.

[10-Jan-19 06:24 AM] Alright#0419
What do you mean by side channels?

[10-Jan-19 06:24 AM] Alright#0419
We have a fungible chain solution that allows for near linear scaling

[10-Jan-19 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You just use more blockchains (or larger blocks) depending on the use case.

[10-Jan-19 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
