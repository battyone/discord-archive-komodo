I had asked the guys from atomicwallet about there atomicswaps & the technical process - That¬¥s the answer: " We‚Äôve already implemented onchain BTC-LTC-QTUM Swaps with BitTorrent distributed order book." On there Whitepaper Page 12/13 is the technical explanation about there swaps  - if somebody wants to read it https://t.co/gfyo9uv963

[26-Jun-18 04:40 PM] Acura#2748
On Page 18 of there whitepaper there compare with BarterDex :Komodo:

[26-Jun-18 04:40 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Acura I read the wp a few days ago, from my understanding it's like a craiglist for OTC trading. There's no ordermatching, the traders must actively agree and swap. This allowed to skip all the utxo part but it's a different use case

[26-Jun-18 04:42 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
OTC trading without escrow

[26-Jun-18 04:43 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031
so its a 100% trust system?

[26-Jun-18 04:44 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's trustless, after both parties agree they can proceed to swap without cheating possibility

[26-Jun-18 04:46 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
this can be done with bdex too, but not sure about exact procedure for otc. Once this gets easy with gui, bdex will serve both OTC and decentralized ordermatching

just use a random netid and you can do OTC swaps, has worked for many months

[26-Jun-18 04:58 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
ok but is there a recommended way to split utxo if we want to swap a specific amount ? Let say I have 100 kmd and other guy has 10 Ltc and we want to trade them

[26-Jun-18 04:58 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
entirely

[26-Jun-18 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
one makes an FR node with netid X

[26-Jun-18 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the other runs a normal node using netidX and seednode the IP of the FR node

[26-Jun-18 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
one side setsprice

[26-Jun-18 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the other side buys

[26-Jun-18 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
and utxo need to be X, X*1.2 for bob, X and X/777 for alice

[26-Jun-18 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing is different other than using a different netid. so whoever needs to hurry up needs to createe a netid

[26-Jun-18 05:01 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
understood thanks! I need to make a test. If put together in a simple guide, it can be a great marketing tool

[26-Jun-18 05:17 PM] jorian#4555

how is that helpful? looking for papers / a wiki

[26-Jun-18 06:48 PM] jorian#4555
it's where the actual scaling solution is being performed. don't know of any good wiki. i remember @Mylo made a blog post about it, i think

[26-Jun-18 06:48 PM] jorian#4555
maybe @blackjok3r knows more

[26-Jun-18 06:49 PM] ProficieNt#3097

very good news if Zec implements NG protocol and then Kmd follows

[26-Jun-18 09:37 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the same tx throughput could be achieved with a fraction of the chains

in eth PoW (this is a fork of eth) what is the meaning of nonce and does predeterming nonce lead to being able to solve blocks easier?

[26-Jun-18 10:26 PM] Jiral#8557
There are some people solving Waltonchain blocks with 0x999999xyz nonce while normally its completely random

nonce is just a part of the blockheader you can change so the hash changes. probably there are other parts of the blockheader that are being changed to keep the nonce constant. you still need to mine by changing the block header, hashing it, checking it, etc.

[26-Jun-18 10:28 PM] Jiral#8557
I see so they are only able to do it after they find a block normally?

[26-Jun-18 10:28 PM] Jiral#8557
hmm weird that they're doing it if they're mining normally, thanks for your answer!

[26-Jun-18 10:54 PM] jl777c#5810
that is how to find a block

[26-Jun-18 10:54 PM] jl777c#5810
change the header, check the hash

[26-Jun-18 10:58 PM] CryptoVegeta#7097

Sorry had to sleep, 5h in 2 days. No I have not written a good document up about scaling, as its evolving every day. I will Have all this done, once testing is finished and the solution is finalised. @jorian

[27-Jun-18 02:20 AM] Mylo#8306
@jorian my blog post was an update as it was for 20k tx/s at the time and how we were working towards building on AWS's scalable infrastructure, the only reason to use AWS is because it's easy to provision enough resources for our scale testing.

thus far, a 64 chain cluster has been used to optimise as much as possible and debug on a smaller scale of 45k (tx or payments?) /second.

when the docker/kubernetes part has been done.  we may look at repeating tests  on non-AWS infrastructure - but this would require finding a provider with 300-500 servers available at the same scale.  We could use a smaller farm of servers - linkedin has been good for finding organisations looking at (software) scaling solutions because they have the hardware.

[27-Jun-18 02:22 AM] Mylo#8306
i think the plan is to ramp up 128x the throughput to hit 1m tx/s (or 100m payments/s)
this "...should be enough for anyone..." - dApp developers especially.

[27-Jun-18 03:41 AM] gcharang#6833
@Jiral  Even now it is completely random. Its just that the randomness in the right most bits of the nonce are enough to find the block. I am presuming that the difficulty was low and they only needed to change the last few bits of the nonce to find a block. Finding a block means that  
* change the nonce
* Find the hash of the block
* see if the first `N` digits are zeroes (`N` is what the network calculates based on the total hash power available, its called the difficulty)
*If they are zeroes then you have found the block
*If not go to first step agian till you find it.

In this case, the difficulty might be low so that they are easily finding blocks so the nonces for many blocks have the same starting digits

[27-Jun-18 03:44 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
" (N is what the network calculates based on the total hash power available, its called the difficulty)"
Technically, `N` is the result of the calculation of time of and between blocks and network "total" rate is inferred from there

is atomicexplorer down for maintenance?

[27-Jun-18 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Mylo The result was 10,000tx/s and ~60,000 payments/s  from a few days ago, this is an expected result, but since then we have had major issues with it. Webworker has been given an SQL dump of the blockchains from last nights test, when he has some free time, he will analyse it like was done for the first large test with 1024 chains and we can then compare the result on Smk702's live stats site. There is either an issue with the cpulimit program I am using on the miner, or the sats calculations in the data aggregator for his website.

[27-Jun-18 04:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ü§û its the cpulimiter... and it kind of points to that, as some chains appear to get `stuck`

[27-Jun-18 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If thats the case it will all be totally resolved by useing the built in docker cpu limiter, but you cant use that on normal containers, it requires swarm or kubernetes.......

FYI : Had to stop my node for maintenance time today, I used that time to send the 2nd quarter rewards for my voters. Every TX is validated. The PR has been done and should be available when confirmed.
