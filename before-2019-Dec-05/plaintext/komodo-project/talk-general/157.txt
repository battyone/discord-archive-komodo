@Artem you can't mine KMD with Verus also. KMD didn't change algo

Pretty sure that was the first multichain hardforking, and was about 50 chains. With the timestamp based activation (newly developed for this), it is now possible to do an ecosystem wide hardfork, regardless of how many chains there are

first post-fork notarizations (not counting the VRSC ones)

[15-Dec-18 03:29 AM] jl777c#5810
would have been much sooner, but I goofed and didnt hardfork the notarization p2p network until half hour ago

[15-Dec-18 03:29 AM] jl777c#5810
that seems to be the only thing that went wrong for the ecosystem hard fork, so far

[15-Dec-18 03:29 AM] jl777c#5810
likely there will be some minor issues here and there, which will we solve after getting some rest

[15-Dec-18 03:30 AM] jl777c#5810
once notarizations are smooth, we will let the exchanges know they can enable wallets.

We have sapling before the next NN election, that's a win

[15-Dec-18 03:31 AM] jl777c#5810
we will come up with easy ways for people to migrate their sprout zaddr funds, as sprout will be deprecated on feb 15th. so lots of time and really it seems only PIRATE has any significant amount in zaddrs at this time

[15-Dec-18 03:33 AM] jl777c#5810

Multichain hardforking with timestamp based activation was a new development in @KomodoPlatform 
This method since worked out perfectly fine, would make it easier for future multichain hardfork upgrades possible no matter what amount of multiple blockchains there'll be.

now that the sapling is activated on all the chains that didnt opt-out, it is time to convert any zfunds you have in sprout addresses to sapling. There is 2 months to do this, but no sense to wait, sapling is literally 100x faster. for all chains other than PIRATE, it is rather simple. Make a new taddr and a sapling address. Then send all sprout funds to the taddr and then all taddr funds into sapling address.

./komodo-cli -ac_name=NAME getnewaddress
./komodo-cli -ac_name=NAME z_getnewaddress
./komodo-cli -ac_name=NAME z_sendmany "sproutzaddr" "[{\"address\":\"taddr\",\"amount\":<total - 0.0001>}]"
./komodo-cli -ac_name=NAME z_sendmany "taddr" "[{\"address\":\"saplingaddr\",\"amount\":<total - 0.0002>}]"

sprout  address starts with 'zc'
taddr starts with 'R'
sapling address starts with 'zs'
total is the total amount in the sprout address

Alternatively, there is a zmigrate cli program that can be built and uses as follows (from ~/komodo/src)
cc/dapps/makedapps
./zmigrate NAME saplingzaddr

Adding it to knowledgebase.

[16-Dec-18 01:54 AM] jl777c#5810
It is STRONGLY recommended that all zaddr usage be converted to sapling addresses as sprout addresses will be deprecated on Feb 15th. Any funds that are still left in sprout addresses after Feb 15th, will just be stuck and effectively burnt. Other than PIRATE, there isnt that much long term usage of zaddrs, but still it would be a shame to burn your coins by not migrating to sapling.

https://www.dexstats.info/explorers.php has a zFunds column, second rightmost. so we can see how much are in zaddrs. If you have put funds into zaddr, please dont forget to convert to sapling, or at least get it back into taddr form
