something in the internal power bits died
not only will it not take a charge, it will not even recognize when it's plugged in

[09-Sep-19 01:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
have you tried different power supply?

[09-Sep-19 01:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or you're sure its something internal

[09-Sep-19 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not the supply it will not read any of the power coming in

`for a flat rate of $325-$425`
for that price I'll ♻ the shell and buy 2 walmart specials and just put debian on them 😛

[09-Sep-19 01:37 PM] SHossain#0007
never knew their price. watched few of his YT videos. but, they are cheaper than Apple repair themselves

before my mac I had several acer and asus laptop which died on my after 2 years max

[09-Sep-19 02:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
only downside is price for mac, but if you factor in the fact that you can keep it running smooth for 4-5 years compared to 2 years for my acers I guess price is pretty even

[09-Sep-19 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

pinebook is going to be ARM

[09-Sep-19 05:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
wont have compatability with a lot of software

[09-Sep-19 05:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
most linux distros will need to get up to day with it.

[09-Sep-19 05:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ARM64 to be specific

Anyone know what is the maximal size of the Komodo's block?

[10-Sep-19 06:12 AM] hastrup#8742
@siu - Chainmakers that true. But Ubuntu mate is compatible. And there is also arch can be used but I hope the different distros will support arm

Ubuntu has yet not published the 64bit arm64 version

[10-Sep-19 09:32 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also manjaro 64bit for aarch64 exists but there is little software ready to be compatible with it

[10-Sep-19 09:32 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
In about a year or 2 this will be a non issue, but right now, there is not much that you can install there

@ElectricCoinCo @ebfull @str4d @feministPLT is it possible to use this new (very cool) discovery on the current Zcash mainnet (via some future Network Upgrade) or does it require an entirely new mainnet which does not contain any old transaction types?
Twitter

[10-Sep-19 04:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD has the most to benefit from that tech, because Zcash mainnet can't use it

[10-Sep-19 04:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
my question is a very respectful way of seeing if they will own up to that

[10-Sep-19 04:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
the tech is awesome, but not "pay ECC $1.1M USD/month awesome", which is why we are hearing about this right now, to get the community to pay them

can you stake kmd on atomicdex wallet?

[10-Sep-19 11:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@IamTrader komodo isn’t a staking coin. They give rewards for active users. To claim you just send yourself the balance from my understanding

[10-Sep-19 11:43 PM] IamTrader#6042
@Crabby Paddy okay does atomic wallet give 5% reward just like other wallet?

@jl777c ... is it possible to just drop these assets to holders so we can manage them ourselves?

looks like BTC core devs have some issues taming the lightning:

I keep getting back to Rick and his analyses of Lightning

[11-Sep-19 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
@house yes, for HODL I was thinking it is time to airdrop all the HODL holdings. to do it properly will need to have a date announced well in advance. now that atomicDEX is about to be able to trade all the assets directly, it seems a good time for HODL distribution.
