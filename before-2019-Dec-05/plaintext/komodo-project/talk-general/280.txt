[25-Apr-19 11:38 PM] willofleo#7505
yeah but what happens if they sell usdt

[25-Apr-19 11:39 PM] willofleo#7505
bad for usdt , but then good for btc or other alts which ever the choose to buy

[25-Apr-19 11:40 PM] modereck#4269
The problem is on tether I dont know why the people sells btc to tether

[25-Apr-19 11:40 PM] willofleo#7505
It would make sense they will want to convert to btc or other anonymous coin

[25-Apr-19 11:41 PM] willofleo#7505
@modereck  for stability and trading purposes there are other stable but usdt is most liquid for a trader

[25-Apr-19 11:42 PM] willofleo#7505
but not sure if it hacked or lost completely big difference

no wonder miket was so quiet for so long, he certainly has been very busy. VRSC shows how much ahead the komodo ecosystem is over the others

[26-Apr-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
by building on top of komodo, projects can dedicate themselves to what makes their project different, which is much more efficient than trying to reinvent all parts from scratch

I am a bit confused about if there is an overlap between VRSC Agama and Komodo Agama, if these are separate wallets, or the same I have to admit

[26-Apr-19 05:55 AM] LocoMB#8593
if they diverge significantly, maybe a rename of VRSC Agama could clarify a bit?

[26-Apr-19 05:58 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is a good idea. definitely there are things in the VRSC agama not in the normal one, however it might be fully backward compatible

Few things getting negative view on komodo. But overall sentiment is good

[26-Apr-19 06:16 AM] Alright#0419
```
Any coin that wishes to be protected by KMD‚Äôs DPoW has to request this from the KMD team. It is a permissioned product. The implementation fee is paid to the KMD developers. This is a centralized process. The users of KMD blockchain nor notary nodes have no say in which coins are protected by DPoW.
```
#kmdlabs shows that this is false

[26-Apr-19 06:16 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I stopped following the dude when he needlessly reverted to personal attacks on people because he couldn‚Äôt explain his position.  He also is a poor fact-checker.  

PoP doesn‚Äôt provide a dPoW solution that we know of.

[26-Apr-19 06:16 AM] jorian#4555
but it is true for external coins

[26-Apr-19 06:17 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Talked about KMD pumping BTcD on Polo.  And was referring to a $95 ‚Äúpump‚Äù

[26-Apr-19 06:18 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Had no specific details on the exit scam he claimed with btcd. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I guess even people like Alex Jones are allowed a voice.

[26-Apr-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
all the BTCD collected is in either the collection address or was burned

[26-Apr-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
we had no control over whatever BTCD remained and there was one exchange reporting crazy volumes and prices with BTCD

[26-Apr-19 06:20 AM] jl777c#5810
and not sure where he comes up with dPoS as dPoW is nothing like dPoS, other than the first three letter are the same

[26-Apr-19 06:20 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe he is saying notary nodes are elected, dPoS elects delegates, therefore they are the same?

[26-Apr-19 06:21 AM] jl777c#5810
and i guess all NN are supposed to be sock puppets or mind controlled?

[26-Apr-19 06:22 AM] jorian#4555
well to me, the article he links to explains dpos as if it was NN. nodes, elected by stake weight, doing special things

[26-Apr-19 06:22 AM] jl777c#5810
but VBK that is closed source, hundreds of times less efficient, unclear on how it can prevent 51%, is the future!

[26-Apr-19 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the logic he uses is that all things that have elections are actually identical in all aspects, since they both have elections

[26-Apr-19 06:23 AM] jorian#4555
```The possibility of implementing PoP into other chains is questionable as of now since the code is closed soruce. If resolved, Veriblock will become all-round the best solution against 51% attacks on the market through it‚Äôs model, which not only protects chains against attacks, but also rewards for doing so in a decentralized fashion with proper market incentives.
```

[26-Apr-19 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the bias is strong, yet even he had to admit dPoW is the market leader

[26-Apr-19 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
they still never explain how an attacker is prevented from using PoP to prove the attacker chain is the real one

[26-Apr-19 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is 100x less efficient, to create something that cant differentiate from attacker or not. also coins are supposed to pay what percent of their coin supply for this? and that assumes it is open sourced and coins modify their daemon and coin supply to support it

[26-Apr-19 06:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So because you have to pay to get dPoW then you must be a centralized entity.  I kinda get that but not to the malicious nefarious intention he‚Äôs pushing.

[26-Apr-19 06:35 AM] jorian#4555
in the end, it's actually the Notary Nodes who decide who to notarize. they can simply not notarize a coin. but that hurts a NNs statistics and possible auto re-election for the next season

[26-Apr-19 06:38 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@FishyGuts  several centralized entities ( service providers ) negotiate on behalf of decentralized operators who are prepaid with the notarization costs and easy mining

[26-Apr-19 06:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The collection of a fee is just recoup of costs .  If it is several , I guess it‚Äôs not centralized ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[26-Apr-19 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
when you are asking a coin to change their consensus algo, it is expected that there is some coordination between the projects

[26-Apr-19 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
to have that process totally decentralized, seems quite courageous

[26-Apr-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
and notarizations are basically an oracle, we know from zack that aggregation does not work for oracles. using elected notaries we dont have just any random attacker on the internet able to submit notarizations. being fully decentralized means you allow attackers to notarize and somehow have to differentiate between attacker notarizations and non-attacker ones.

[26-Apr-19 06:46 AM] Alright#0419
from what I understand, you must watch BTC for VBK early-warning(not prevention.)

[26-Apr-19 06:47 AM] Alright#0419
you *need* the BTC chain or a central entity to give you this info

[26-Apr-19 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe they can copy enough of how dPoW is done to make it as reliable on the enforcement side, but they have had 2 years and so far are up to the spam massive notarizations stage. seems it could be a while before they cover all the edge cases, oh and all nodes need to install BTC?

[26-Apr-19 06:47 AM] Alright#0419
and the whole "dpow is centralized" can be dismissed by the fact that anyone can create their own dpow network

they keep attacking us as centralized, when it is distributed

[26-Apr-19 06:48 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Asking each operator on a case by case basis to add a coin would be inefficient  and down right annoying ( speaking with experience dealing with DPoW inquiries ) , VBK gets away with this because the pop miners front the btc cost,  but the novelty of burning your value will wear off in time especially if what we suspect is true and their system doesn‚Äôt really protect .

[26-Apr-19 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
at the source code/project level it is centralized as how else to get code changes into the daemon? this is a good thing

[26-Apr-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the 10BTC per day miners are spending for PoP will create a death spiral as soon as the daily trading volume shrinks to 100BTC or lower. 10BTC real sells per day will be hard to absorb when it is 10%+ of your daily trading volumes. maybe at some point it will reach equilibrium, but think about burning $50,000 per day for what even VBK admits is totally worthless as no chain is even using it now. that is $1.5 mil per month, spamming BTC chain just because. KMD ICO raised a bit less than $2 mil.

[26-Apr-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
now that the OTC buyers are at loss in BTC and just above breakeven in USD, not sure what will happen in the near term. maybe the OTC buyers will hodl through the losses

[26-Apr-19 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
criticizing KMD for what polo traders did with a zombie coin that we had no control over, while OTC selling at 50% the price of IEO. that seems much more of a problem as all IEO purchasers were at the same time paying double what the OTC buyers were. Did any other offering ever have a 2x difference at the same time?
