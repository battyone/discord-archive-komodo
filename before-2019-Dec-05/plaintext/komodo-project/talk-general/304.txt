Congrats to all the notary winners.

It would be great @CHMEX  if we can keep a log on dexstats of what everyone does throughout their year so we can see what contributions they did for KMD.

@SHossain it is a good idea to add coins with dPoW like GIN to agama, at least using lite mode if SPV servers are already available

@jl777c i'll look into GIN integration into Agama

[14-May-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
do we have GAME also? it seems a good benefit for dPoW customers

[14-May-19 12:09 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, GAME is already listed in both desktop and mobile

[14-May-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and all the other external dPoW coins?

[14-May-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
also mm2 integration is good to have. this will give a couple important benefits for dPoW

[14-May-19 12:11 PM] SHossain#0007
all other 3rd party coins and AC that are being dPoW'd are listed in Agama.

[14-May-19 12:11 PM] SHossain#0007

it will be possible, but Agama will need to talk to XMR-flavored RPCs. Sounds fun

if it cant be done with reasonable efforts, then of course it cant be part of what is offered

@SHossain @jl777c Is it possible also to enable staking for coins like Gin / VRCS?

[14-May-19 12:47 PM] SHossain#0007
no

[14-May-19 12:47 PM] SHossain#0007
VRSC is running in Lite mode via electrum servers. For staking, you need native mode.

[14-May-19 12:48 PM] SHossain#0007
Better to use Verus Version of Agama

[14-May-19 12:50 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Ah okay, although would be a nice idea in the future if its possbile

[14-May-19 12:50 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, if staking via Lite mode is possible, a lot of things will become better 😃

[14-May-19 12:51 PM] SHossain#0007
you could even do that on mobile

[14-May-19 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`staking via Lite mode` would require a very altruistic electrum provider

[14-May-19 12:54 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
@SHossain That would be very convenient for the everyday user
