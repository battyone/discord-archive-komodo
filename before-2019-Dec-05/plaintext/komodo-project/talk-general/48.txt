On Friday, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced plans to raise the minimum wage and create a single exchange rate pegged to his government's petro-backed cryptocurrency, which would effectively devalue Venezuelan money by 96%.

any idea of how many nodes are there? A min observed number?

for KMD?

[21-Aug-18 08:03 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes

[21-Aug-18 08:04 AM] CHMEX#0686
james was one node with has at some point 200+ connections
as its very decentralized there is no way to really know.

[21-Aug-18 08:06 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
ok

[21-Aug-18 08:07 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
as for "# of entities in control of >50% of voting/mining power" I put 42, since NN have 75% of blocks and 42 make 50% of overall blocks

[21-Aug-18 08:07 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
right?

[21-Aug-18 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
42 sounds right

[21-Aug-18 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i estimate approx 777 nodes

[21-Aug-18 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
also from the rich list, it could be about 42 that control half the coins

[21-Aug-18 08:16 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes my calc is about the same, excluding the exchanges and funds

[21-Aug-18 08:23 AM] CHMEX#0686
let me know if you need some sort of api to grab data

[21-Aug-18 08:25 AM] CHMEX#0686
so once again 42 is the answer

[21-Aug-18 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it has always been so

It is revolutionary or do you know another exchange where you can trade 40'000+ pairs while you are in control of the funds at all times?

When the hyperdex is launched fully I can see it being successful

[23-Aug-18 07:15 PM] Tommyboy50#3199
Anyone know the ETA for this btw? Last I read about it was many weeks ago, and the hard launch was stated as within August

Komodo got me thinking with its cool use-btc-security backup dPOW.

[24-Aug-18 06:00 AM] anonanon#1085
Could you use bitcoin for 2fa basically? Say agama wallet asked upon wallet creation if the user wanted to link a bitcoin address.

[24-Aug-18 06:00 AM] anonanon#1085
Then in the future to spend funds, maybe a 6 digit random number is generated that you must sign with your BTC address you linked at account creation.

[24-Aug-18 06:01 AM] anonanon#1085
Well, sign with the private key to the btc address you linked.

[24-Aug-18 06:01 AM] anonanon#1085
Boom, you've got 2fa. Right?

[24-Aug-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
cant enforce this signing to be done on a different computer, so it will tend to be in the same computer, which means it is 1fa twice

[24-Aug-18 11:20 AM] Emil | Altcoin Magazine#8258
@benohanlon so are you rebranding the Komodo name or the marketing plan?

Well, I read the ann and the article but it's still unclear. It's my impression that it's only a visual rebrand.

[24-Aug-18 11:36 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
visual and identity, i.e. how to explain/market Komodo

[24-Aug-18 11:36 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
and later also UX for wallet/dex

[24-Aug-18 11:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Emil | Altcoin Magazine @Daniel CP Daniel CPvandaag om 09:55
@Seko  No official decisions have been made but we will probably be keeping the same name (or at least the "Komodo" part of it, the word "platform" is still on the table since we want to differentiate ourselves from all the other projects calling themselves platforms)
The logo, colors, and typeface will all be redesigned

[24-Aug-18 11:47 AM] Emil | Altcoin Magazine#8258
Awesome. It's just really confusing since the word "brand" refers to the name it self so a rebranding would mean a new name unless it's stated that it will be a visual rebranding only. Just telling you so you can avoid further confusion form other people

[24-Aug-18 11:50 AM] Daniel CP#2020
That's a fair interpretation of the word "brand" but it looks like we will not be changing the name (although this isn't 100% for sure, no major decisions have been made yet)

[24-Aug-18 11:51 AM] Daniel CP#2020
When we say "brand" we do mean things like visual branding (colors, font, logo) but we also mean brand as in how people think about Komodo

[24-Aug-18 11:51 AM] Daniel CP#2020
So perhaps "brand identity" would be a more accurate term

[24-Aug-18 11:53 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We're doing visual rebranding but we'll also be creating new messaging, a new website, and a new UI/UX for an app

[24-Aug-18 11:53 AM] Daniel CP#2020
So a lot of different aspects to the rebrand

[24-Aug-18 02:35 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I can't tell you the number of people messaging me asking if KMD is changing is name, or starting a new chain altogether similar to BTCD -> KMD

This needs to be addressed elsewhere besides just here IMO and look into using a different term for "rebrand"

[24-Aug-18 02:37 PM] Daniel CP#2020
That's fair but I think we covered everything in the official announcement. We've given all the info we have at this time

[24-Aug-18 02:37 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We are def not starting a new chain

[24-Aug-18 02:37 PM] dan.#2473
Did I read somewhere they did Dash? Were they responsible for the name change to Dash?

[24-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Not sure where that idea wouldve come from

[24-Aug-18 02:38 PM] dan.#2473
Every name change I can think of in Crypto has merited results, just thinking out loud

[24-Aug-18 02:39 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I know the chain wouldn't change so that was an easy answer, but seeing that it happened the last time the name was changed its not an unreasonable question/thought.

[24-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Daniel CP#2020
That's valid but we def aren't starting a new chain

[24-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Daniel CP#2020
And while nothing is certain, I think (personal opinion here, not speaking as a team member) its really unlikely that the name will change

[24-Aug-18 02:42 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We tried to put all the info we have at this point in the announcement

[24-Aug-18 02:43 PM] Daniel CP#2020
All I can say is that a lot of things have yet to be decided but we are 100% gonna do what is best for Komodo and will always take community feedback into consideration

[24-Aug-18 02:45 PM] dan.#2473
imo, if the goal is brand image and awareness, everything has to possibly be on the table

Instead of silly rumor and unconfirmed news, just better to rely on official announcements and wait for confirmations, and updates.
