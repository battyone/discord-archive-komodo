Hey @all, I have a general question about the Komodo platform.. If we make an assetchain (what the planning is to go do with the ViisiitCoin), but the SEC sees the essence of the coin as an utility- and security token. So, that in essence we‚Äôll be doing a dSTO in a couple of years after the private sale. 

Is that something that is actually (technically) true? Can we say that we‚Äôre doing a dSTO on the Komodo platform?

[18-Nov-18 09:25 PM] AlvinLeito#0720
Also something totally different.. just saw the telegram community in here linked with a bot... how do you connect the bot with the telegram channel/group?

[18-Nov-18 10:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
STO is just another name for stock offering.   Consult with a securities lawyer on how you should proceed and what is all needed to do such an offering .  The tech can do what you make it do,  but tech is agnostic when it comes to the law it's up to the user / issuer to fulfill whatever compliance they need to

[18-Nov-18 11:25 PM] PTYX#6840
It doesn't matter which blockchain platform you use. If you issue a token, offer rewards or benefits to buyers, promise any sort of a return, and allow any US person to participate in the token sale then you must register with the Sec for approval or exemption

hey guys, just wondering...if I am running AGAMA lite wallet

[19-Nov-18 01:35 AM] ecbuddy#8524
can I create different receiving addresses?

[19-Nov-18 01:37 AM] Alright#0419
one seed = one address

[19-Nov-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
New aees

[19-Nov-18 01:37 AM] Alright#0419
create a different seed

[19-Nov-18 01:38 AM] ecbuddy#8524
how do i create a new seed?

[19-Nov-18 01:39 AM] ecbuddy#8524
bascially create a new wallet on the lite menu page?

[19-Nov-18 01:41 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[19-Nov-18 01:48 AM] ecbuddy#8524
alright, I figured as much...

[19-Nov-18 01:49 AM] ecbuddy#8524
also, how come when I send KMD to a friend, it send out a huge amount from which his small amount gets sent then a another amounts gets returned to me

[19-Nov-18 01:49 AM] ecbuddy#8524
its such a strange way to keep things accounted for

[19-Nov-18 01:49 AM] ecbuddy#8524
is UTXO the reason?

[19-Nov-18 01:50 AM] ecbuddy#8524
I also had a reward of 1.33 listed on my wallet and then when i made a transaction to send to my friend, my reward dropped  to  .5 KMD

[19-Nov-18 01:57 AM] Alright#0419
UTXOs is the exact reason

[19-Nov-18 01:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You didn't spend the utxo

[19-Nov-18 01:58 AM] ecbuddy#8524
and the reward discrepancy?

[19-Nov-18 01:58 AM] ecbuddy#8524
did I somehow claim it partially?

[19-Nov-18 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
if you would have sent the full balance of the wallet in that transaction, you would receive the full amount of rewards

[19-Nov-18 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
instead, like poly said, you only spent partial balance of the wallet

[19-Nov-18 01:59 AM] Alright#0419
if you want the rest, send the full balance back to yourself

[19-Nov-18 01:59 AM] Alright#0419
otherwise, it just keeps accruing. You didn't lose anything

[19-Nov-18 01:59 AM] ecbuddy#8524
yes I spent a small amount, and in a large amount went out, and the balance came back to my wallet...but my rewards accrued showed a it had gone down

[19-Nov-18 02:00 AM] ecbuddy#8524
yeah, I am figuring I didnt lose anything, just wondering why it got auto sent in sense of speaking

[19-Nov-18 02:00 AM] Alright#0419
research UTXOs and change addresses

[19-Nov-18 02:00 AM] Alright#0419
what you're talking about is a change address

[19-Nov-18 02:01 AM] Alright#0419
and is a fundamental principal of bitcoin itself

[19-Nov-18 02:01 AM] ecbuddy#8524
alright I will research it

[19-Nov-18 02:01 AM] ecbuddy#8524
yes, bitcoin seems to be the same

[19-Nov-18 02:01 AM] ecbuddy#8524
sorry, I am not as familiar with KMD as I should be...

[19-Nov-18 02:02 AM] Alright#0419
no worries, if you have any questions, feel free to ping me

[19-Nov-18 02:02 AM] Alright#0419
or just ask here, I'm sure there will be someone to answer

[19-Nov-18 02:02 AM] ecbuddy#8524
I am kinda invested or used to ARK and Pivx as longer holds, but I always thought KMD had great tech and visions

[19-Nov-18 02:02 AM] ecbuddy#8524
so I finally got it at these prices...really a no brainer lol

[19-Nov-18 02:03 AM] ecbuddy#8524
even thought I started buying at 3$ üò¶

@KomodoWorld Who wrote the white paper?

[19-Nov-18 02:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Bryan_Beus

[19-Nov-18 02:55 PM] PTYX#6840
Actually James wrote it. Siddhartha was the editor.

[19-Nov-18 02:56 PM] PTYX#6840
@Cassius do you have a question about the whitepaper?

[19-Nov-18 02:57 PM] Cassius#9158
Not yet. Just wanted to say it was a decent piece of work

[19-Nov-18 02:57 PM] Cassius#9158
Having written a few white papers and seen a good many more, that's not always a given

[19-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Audo#5667
Are you the same Cassius who was here long time ago? I haven't seen you in a while üòÉ

[19-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Audo#5667
back in the Slack days

[19-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Cassius#9158
Yes üòÉ I was closely involved in Nxt, and with SuperNET/BTCD back in the day.

[19-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Audo#5667
Yeah, I remember you. Great to have you back here lurking

[19-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Cassius#9158
At the start of 2016 I had some personal stuff to deal with, then Sasha asked me to help with Waves, Incent took off as a company, etc

[19-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Audo#5667
what are you up to nowadays?

[19-Nov-18 03:00 PM] Cassius#9158
Still working with Waves on content, but because it has coalesced as a Russian initiative my workload is less now and it's less creative. Will be sticking around there indefinitely but I have capacity and interest in more now

[19-Nov-18 03:01 PM] Cassius#9158
Similarly Incent is doing well, creating some really cool software, but post-ICO and after the early days, there's less of a role and I'm not cut out for corporate life anyway üòÉ

[19-Nov-18 03:02 PM] Cassius#9158
I have various other clients, started my own comms company (www.blockworm.net)

[19-Nov-18 03:03 PM] Cassius#9158
But looking for something where I can get my hands properly dirty again and help shape something from the start. I'm involved in one or two grassroots initiatives, which is fun

[19-Nov-18 03:04 PM] Cassius#9158
My favourite projects are the ones where I not only get to communicate the ideas, but help shape them from the start

[19-Nov-18 03:06 PM] Audo#5667
Ok, cool. Feel free to shoot a message to @Steve Lee incase you are interested of getting involved with Komodo. I'm not sure if there are any positions immediately avialable though.

We have been thinking of ways to build a platform that would better empower the Komodo community. Part of that is to encourgae people to blog / write about Komodo. We will definitely need more ideas and help there.

[19-Nov-18 03:07 PM] Cassius#9158
Maybe, thanks. Mostly looking to find out more at this point.

[19-Nov-18 03:08 PM] Audo#5667
I remember talking with one guy in a conference, and he was explaining me how P2P technology requires a P2P community. Otherwise there's just a centralized hub for information (website), and the normal social media channels, and that makes it more like a corporate project versus an open source project largely dirven by its community.

[19-Nov-18 03:08 PM] Cassius#9158
Haven't finished the wp yet and there's a lot to get my head around. I'm curious about the custom chain launcher though

[19-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Cassius#9158
For sure - though people use 'decentralised' as a one-stop-shop without really grasping that you can have centralised/decentralised infrastructure (blockchain), company, information, community... in different combinations

[19-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Audo#5667
The whitepaper might a bit out of date too. We have upgraded our marketing messageing. Best place to get fast up to speed with what we have is our website and the recent blog posts

[19-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Cassius#9158
Sure, thanks

[19-Nov-18 03:10 PM] Cassius#9158
How's everything going with you anyway?

[19-Nov-18 03:12 PM] Audo#5667
oh good, thanks for asking. I have been doing some travelling and I keep hustling üòÑ

[19-Nov-18 03:17 PM] Cassius#9158
Cool

[19-Nov-18 03:17 PM] Cassius#9158
Are you still involved with Nxt or Ardor/Ignis (I lost track)?

[19-Nov-18 03:59 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Cassius @PTYX 

Thank you for the compliment. 

James is responsible for the concepts, I just put his concepts to words.

You're welcome to reach out to Steve Lee to see if there are any bounties. I believe we have someone new just hired for writing content, so it may be awhile before we have another opening.

[19-Nov-18 04:07 PM] Cassius#9158
Yep - not looking for anything specific at the moment, but thanks, will bear it in mind

[19-Nov-18 04:08 PM] Cassius#9158
