I'm not sure I understand why you would feel uncomfortable with me saying it has changed or rather how it can be seen as loaded statement. It seems to be key aspect of the PirateChain, it's mentioned many times in the site. If a project puts out new ways to achieve something, isn't it quite healthy for everybody that people are interested in these changes?

[14-Dec-18 10:01 AM] lord kek#0511
but I guess I got what I came for. Your take on the subject. I have no stake in the success of PirateChain or dPoW and I gain nothing if it turns out to not be good idea.

[14-Dec-18 10:03 AM] lord kek#0511
I don't see my self going to broadcast my views on this to all my 17 followers to sabotage anybodys project, this one included.

[14-Dec-18 10:04 AM] lord kek#0511
But thank you for the answers. Good luck with what you're doing everybody.

[14-Dec-18 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
you asked, I answered. I tried to be clear

[14-Dec-18 10:04 AM] lord kek#0511
sure, your answer is appreciated.

[14-Dec-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
if you find any change to the game theory that is a negative change, let us know

[14-Dec-18 10:06 AM] lord kek#0511
Who controls these notary nodes tho?

[14-Dec-18 10:07 AM] lord kek#0511
You would need to update the notary nodes to be able to hard fork the chain I would assume?

[14-Dec-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries control their own nodes

[14-Dec-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries are elected by the KMD stake

[14-Dec-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
hard fork what chain?

[14-Dec-18 10:07 AM] lord kek#0511
The pirateChain

[14-Dec-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries are updating their nodes as everybody else is

[14-Dec-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
entire community is updating

[14-Dec-18 10:08 AM] lord kek#0511
hmm

[14-Dec-18 10:08 AM] lord kek#0511
so is the assumption here that the community agrees?

[14-Dec-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
with all hard forks that is the assumption

[14-Dec-18 10:09 AM] lord kek#0511
I don't think that's accurate

[14-Dec-18 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
if for whatever reason the notaries didnt update, then they would generate invalid notarizations that will just be ignored

[14-Dec-18 10:09 AM] lord kek#0511
for example segwit2x would be good example of this

[14-Dec-18 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
in a hard fork, if you dont update, you get left behind

[14-Dec-18 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont update to what the community decides

[14-Dec-18 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
i am not clear on what community segwit2x ever had, or what actual nodes. didnt everyone just abandon it other than a few scammers?

[14-Dec-18 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
you are using such an outlier case to say that what? the community didnt agree to hardfork to the next bitcoin ?

[14-Dec-18 10:11 AM] lord kek#0511
they had overwhelming support of industry actors and I think hash rate too, but the fork was abandoned still

[14-Dec-18 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
industry actors?

[14-Dec-18 10:12 AM] lord kek#0511
exchanges, companies such

[14-Dec-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
how many people ran segwit2x?

[14-Dec-18 10:12 AM] lord kek#0511
that's hard to know, because it's basically just signaling and it doesn't mean anything before the fork, because it doesn't tie you into anything

[14-Dec-18 10:13 AM] lord kek#0511
but I mentioned this only to demonstrate that it's assumed that the community agrees on hard forks

[14-Dec-18 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
in a normal non-politicized hardfork, the community just updates

[14-Dec-18 10:13 AM] lord kek#0511
yeah, those are easy

[14-Dec-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
let us agree that btc hardforks cant even agree on changing a maxblocksize #define after 4 years, so any meaningful change is impossible without massive controversy

[14-Dec-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
at komodo, we are a bit more efficient than that

[14-Dec-18 10:14 AM] lord kek#0511
I'm just trying to figure out if there's a component of increased centralization as a tradeoff for the rather clever way to gain additional protection to the "native" hash rate of the chain

[14-Dec-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
all nodes validate all notarizations

[14-Dec-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
that makes it very decentralized

[14-Dec-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
just like all nodes validate all transactions

[14-Dec-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries are not master nodes

[14-Dec-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
they are not delegates that create blocks

[14-Dec-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
they have very small powers

[14-Dec-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
to make valid notarizations

[14-Dec-18 10:16 AM] lord kek#0511
so basically if "PirateChain SV" wanted to hard fork to what ever ruleset, these nodes would not get stuck if the notaries  didn't notarize the new ruleset?

[14-Dec-18 10:17 AM] lord kek#0511
they would just operate as if there are no notaries and rely on what ever hashrate the new "SV chain" has?

[14-Dec-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
correct

[14-Dec-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
notarization is not controlling block production

[14-Dec-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just a transaction that is containing notarization data

[14-Dec-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
which happens to be used by all nodes to update their notarization state, if it is a valid notarization

[14-Dec-18 10:19 AM] lord kek#0511
could someone block this "SV chain" from gaining this notarization?

[14-Dec-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
notarization is a service

[14-Dec-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries would need to optin to offering the notarizations

[14-Dec-18 10:22 AM] lord kek#0511
Hmm

[14-Dec-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
having the notarization being there or not, would go a long way toward removing market confusion as to which is the real PIRATE chain

[14-Dec-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
in any case SV and ABC were different chains the moment of chain split as they had blocks with different rulesets

[14-Dec-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
there was no winner take all hashwar at all

[14-Dec-18 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
there was always going to be two separate chains

[14-Dec-18 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
just without replay protection at the tx level, it made it very risky to use either

[14-Dec-18 10:23 AM] lord kek#0511
that fork was indeed weird occurrence, it effectively resulted in 3 chains

[14-Dec-18 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
even in this insane scenario. if it were replicated with PIRATE, the community would know which PIRATE was being notarized and likely the other chain wouldnt get much traction

[14-Dec-18 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
of course if both chains were to get notarization, then it would be clear that there would be two chains,but we wouldnt notarize a new fork that didnt have replay protection

[14-Dec-18 10:27 AM] lord kek#0511
You don't see that as aspect of centralization? To me it seems these notaries are a player with real power. Even if them picking sides doesn't mean the "other side" (the one without notarization) wouldn't be able to run without the support of notaries, you say they have weight when the "legit" chain is "chosen". And to be clear, I'm not saying that tradeoff would necessarily be bad. I can see it being beneficial even if it came with a cost in form of lesser decree of decentralization

[14-Dec-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries help decide which is the real chain

[14-Dec-18 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
it uses a stochastic distributed consensus method that no single node controls

[14-Dec-18 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
notarizations are validated by all nodes, making the complete process decentralized

[14-Dec-18 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
now in politicized chain split scenarios where central actors are already at play, sure, the notarization provides another reference point

[14-Dec-18 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
since in a a politicized scenario, it has little to do with technology, consensus protocols, etc. it seems moot the effect of having or not having notarization has on the process.

[14-Dec-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in that case, would not the other side just deploy their own notaries? Or thats what I would do if it was me.

[14-Dec-18 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
it can be argued either way, that notarization is helping or hurting the chain split resolution, depending on your politics of the situation. This has nothing to do with the chain consensus. It is as relevant as to whether a node operators prefer McDonalds or Burger King

[14-Dec-18 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
this has nothing to do with dPoW

[14-Dec-18 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
it can be discussed in #fastfood

üòÇ 

[14-Dec-18 10:36 AM] lord kek#0511
sure, but if they chose Burger King, community would likely be rooting for Burger King, because the notaries help determine which one the brave sailors are to consume if they want to sail the "correct" ship. I'm sure the Burger King side of the community would appreciate this

[14-Dec-18 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless, such aspects are not part of non-politicized dPoW analysis

[14-Dec-18 10:37 AM] lord kek#0511
hmm

[14-Dec-18 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
and PIRATESV would just make their own notaries claiming that they only eat vegetarian so are better notaries

sv chain can be notarized if they pay the fee? , so both chains can do whatever they want üòÑ

[14-Dec-18 10:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if its worth it to notarise some forked chain, you can notarise it...

[14-Dec-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
the bottom line is that dPoW does not need to be perfect

[14-Dec-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it just needs to be better than not having it

[14-Dec-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
if so, then it is worth having

[14-Dec-18 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
and personally I wouldnt touch a chain without dPoW or a very high hashrate

[14-Dec-18 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe some PoS chains are not so bad, depending on the genesis details

[14-Dec-18 10:40 AM] lord kek#0511
I'm not sure I would phrase it like that. I'm not sure it's so easy to determine what is better. What I mean is, it's not as easy as looking at a number and seeing one is bigger, hence it's better. Most times these are not about being objectively better, it's about tradeoffs and which ones you're willing to make, what you value most

[14-Dec-18 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
It seems pretty easy to me to decide that having a chain being able to be reorged 300+ blocks vs one that lets you know when it is notarized or not and not being able to be reorged much at all

[14-Dec-18 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
if you want a number, use the max reorg depth

[14-Dec-18 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
or the amount of funds at risk of 51% attack

[14-Dec-18 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are ok with deep reorgs and big money lost from 51% attack, then great, dPoW isnt for you

[14-Dec-18 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
if however you are ok with the type of fastfood notary operators eat, to avoid deep reorgs and 51% attacks, then dPoW should be considered

[14-Dec-18 10:43 AM] lord kek#0511
sure, if you are restricted to one metric. Say you were willing to run master nodes, you don't have to burn electricity, you can scale way easier, but it's not like there is no cost. You might see it as cost worth paying, but I don't think it's so simple

[14-Dec-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
dPoW is much much much less centralizing than masternodes, which is less that dPoS

[14-Dec-18 10:45 AM] lord kek#0511
it was not a comparison, it was an attempt to demonstrate that there are many "numbers" to look at when determining what's better

[14-Dec-18 10:47 AM] lord kek#0511
and what's better is not always simple, because it depends on the tradeoffs you are willing to make and how you value these. I don't think every coin or token needs to be "better bitcoin" I can see the crypto landscape where different projects have different tradeoffs. Right tool for the job type of thing

[14-Dec-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why we dont expect 100% of coins to adopt dPoW

[14-Dec-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
we never said taht

[14-Dec-18 10:48 AM] lord kek#0511
I'm sorry, I have to ask, do you feel I'm adversarial here?

[14-Dec-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
we do say that for a chain without a lot of hashrate, having dPoW offers a lot of protection with minimal downside

[14-Dec-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
are you adversarial?

[14-Dec-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
I just stated that we dont expect all coins to adopt dPoW

[14-Dec-18 10:48 AM] lord kek#0511
that's not my intention at least

[14-Dec-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
