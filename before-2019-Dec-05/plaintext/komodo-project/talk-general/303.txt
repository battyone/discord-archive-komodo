here thanks everyone! Elections for NN2019 are officially over. No need to DM me to ask if I have spare votes (hardly it was effective even before :).
And congratulations to winners!

Meantime if your wallet is in the richlist and you assume yourself winner, but for whatever reason none of the explorers (e.g. komodod.com ) or official github repo have no your wallet published - please - message me ASAP (!) so we can check why.

Later I will contact probably all winners for other details. And winners will be announced officially in a few days.

I also feel that there is no need for me to run a node this year, so I will give my spot to infotech-al, who last year helped out by taking over one of artik nodes. This perception that I control a bunch of nodes is not true and I will demonstrate this by giving up my NN spot.

@jl777c When we fork for the new NNs, will we be getting the pegged private token for KMD? Or when is that scheduled to occur?

[14-May-19 12:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be close, we have sidechains in testing, but not sure there will be time to get it all tested. at worst there will be an update that supports the sidechain after the new NN hardfork

[14-May-19 04:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the ones who's been already active here maintaining, updating, and almost like 24 hr life here will be the good OPs, I guess even without the automation tools, even in case they just use the native provided shell scripts on the dPoW setup.
Automation helps, a lot, but only to some extent. It'll be a deliusional life to rely solely on automation setup. Please don't rely on your automation skills. You'll get hit and will have hard time recovering.
Chose your Vendor of hosting server wisely, if you don't want to get in to the hassle of changing the server/IPv4 later on, which can in turn again hit your notarisation counts, which is THE MOST important thing for any Notary Node.
It is always best to chose to have your OWN HARDWARE. You can own it, mod it, improve it, with much cheaper expsenses as compare to hosting or cloud servers, which are shiny, but not always what they represent. Even with the low grade server of your own, you might do overperform as per your expectations than what you think you can do with hosted or a cloud server.
You will have to spend your nights and days defending the network along with devs. Be present, over the clock, anytime. Your first and utmost priority is the Notary Nodes Notifications and Alerts, can covey this message to your partner ahead of time, so they don't mind you unavailable sometimes. Hope they understand your reasons.
It is not hard job, but very very dedicated job to be a Notary Node Operator.

[14-May-19 04:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Welcoming all new 2019 Notary Node Operators. Those who won, you guys deserved a spot. Those who didn't, you did your best guys, you can still contribute to this ecosystem with your skills and still get rewarded. There is no shortage of being rewarded for whatever you love to do. May be you should feel best that you got the chance to look other places in ecosystem to contribute, and not just tight dedicated Notary Node Operations. You are all needed here.
Wishing you all the best for Komodo Platform 2019 Notary Nodes. 🙂 🎉

@kolo I think @mrlynch is aware.   He is no longer employed by the man but instead is now a full time pirate NN OP.  He will be spending the next year doing his best to provide many contributions to Pirate and the z address ecosystem as well as KMD.  We have already completed / revamped the KMD fullnode port.   My next big goal will be DIscussed with the team for a big privacy upgrade.  We will hope to be  coding and integrating it  into KMD hopefully by the next NN cycle.  👍

[14-May-19 05:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@grewalsatinder Pirate is employing a “follow the sun” strategy and we will have devs on all sides of the planet looking out for the health of the ecosystem.   With NNOPS like genie, web, dwy strob and Lynch, the pirate team will do our best to ensure safe seas for all.
