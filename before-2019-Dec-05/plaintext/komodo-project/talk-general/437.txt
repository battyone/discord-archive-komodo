[19-Oct-19 10:50 AM] Strob#3417
So anyone can tell me what happened exactly with k64? I'm just happy I didn't work on it. I was invited to work on games for it but there was so many red flags right even before the beginning that I didn't want to touch it with a stick. I just hope I could warn others but red flags are not proofs and I didn't want to sound like a party pooper or a fudder. (And I don't even like to work on games either btw)

[19-Oct-19 10:53 AM] Markus#5464

@Strob

[19-Oct-19 11:17 AM] Strob#3417
Anyway what I know is they were promising to create many complete video games in 2 weeks without having a single complete one to show in their portfolio which was just insane! And 2 weeks passed and still just some screenshots from Unity, months passed and still nothing. The guy never answered my DM where I just asked to see his portfolio... So remember a real game that real people really want to play can take a team of 60 people many years to make! So next time you see someone claiming he can make 3 games in 3 weeks alone in his basement, he better have the most brilliant idea in human history and be able to explain it to you!

Hey there!  My church wants to make cryptocurrency a thing here. In the city I live in (G√∂rlitz, Saxony, Germany). Due to various reasons for one being the fading away of cash money. We would like to be more independent from FIAT currency here. Possibly starting our own blockchain. What blockchain tech would you recommend us?

[20-Oct-19 03:06 PM] Fynn#3178
We need something that works on mobile phones as well

[20-Oct-19 03:19 PM] Oszy#5734
Well considering you asked it on the KMD discord the answer is Komodo Blockchain

[20-Oct-19 03:19 PM] Oszy#5734
Have a look at the developer docs or the Antara Composer

[20-Oct-19 03:23 PM] Fynn#3178
@Oszy In a presentation about antara composer I saw that this costs huge amounts of money to release your own blockchain. Not an option for us. How can I kickstart custom tokens in the agama wallet?

[20-Oct-19 03:31 PM] Oszy#5734
`How can I kickstart custom tokens in the agama wallet?` You can't right now, only when they releas PbaaS, and that's Verus not Komodo

[20-Oct-19 03:32 PM] Oszy#5734
On komodo without paying for the services, there's the developer documentation, and we are here to help with technical questions, but there is no "free" plug and play blockchain creator

[20-Oct-19 03:33 PM] Fynn#3178
@Oszy thx for the feedback, but there must be crypto projects which offer the free launch of tokens right?

[20-Oct-19 03:33 PM] Oszy#5734
launching the chain is free on Komodo too

[20-Oct-19 03:34 PM] Fynn#3178
@Oszy I started out years ago with NXT - big sellin point for NXT was tokens that worked

[20-Oct-19 03:34 PM] Oszy#5734
what will cost you is the servers to keep the chain running, wallet integrations, etc

[20-Oct-19 03:34 PM] Oszy#5734
just the chain is free üôÇ

[20-Oct-19 03:34 PM] Fynn#3178
mhm okay

[20-Oct-19 03:34 PM] Oszy#5734
don't even need KMD to use it

[20-Oct-19 03:35 PM] Fynn#3178
how much would a not very sophisticated chain cost? yearly

[20-Oct-19 03:36 PM] Oszy#5734
I advise you to fire up the antara composer which will give you exact amounts that i don't know the top of my head

[20-Oct-19 03:36 PM] Oszy#5734
and if you decide to do it on your own instead, this is a good starting point
