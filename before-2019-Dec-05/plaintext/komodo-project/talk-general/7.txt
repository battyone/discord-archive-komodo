[slack] <CrypToon> Aha roger that re. dsec

[12-Jun-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <blackjok3r> Its for storing a value in a blockchains you can retreive with a key, like an encrypted DB.

[12-Jun-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ASKz> its not really encrypted

[12-Jun-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ASKz> i think?

[12-Jun-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ASKz> but you can store whatever you want (and so on, encrypted data)

[12-Jun-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <blackjok3r> without the key you cant get the value... is what I mean't be encrypted.. maybe it was the wrong word.

[12-Jun-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ASKz> hmhm yeah but you could scan the blockchain and see the data ^^

[12-Jun-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ASKz> so its not encrypted unless you store an encryypted value yup

[12-Jun-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ASKz> hidden maybe ^^

[12-Jun-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> the key is not an encryption key, but just a reference, like an actual database.

[12-Jun-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <blackjok3r> ok got it üôÇ

[12-Jun-18 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810

[12-Jun-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> and the good news:

[12-Jun-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> it's gonna be supported by all assetchains.

[12-Jun-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ASKz> its already supported by all assetchain isnt it jl?

[12-Jun-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ASKz> I see commands in my AC's help cmd

[12-Jun-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> if you're on the latest version, yes, it is

[12-Jun-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> not sure if master branch got it working yet.

[12-Jun-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ASKz> yes it is

[12-Jun-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ASKz> my production servers are on master

[12-Jun-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> there was a bug, test it if the bug is gone

[12-Jun-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
production for NN should be dev or beta

[12-Jun-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[slack] <ASKz> np

[12-Jun-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> And KV is the assetchain that is/was used to test this?

[12-Jun-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> But the functionalities will be built in for kmd and its assetchains if I understand correctly?

[12-Jun-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Or will kmd/AC‚Äôs refer to the KV chain

[12-Jun-18 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it is in all  but the KMD chain

[12-Jun-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ASKz> why not kmd?

[12-Jun-18 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810

All people and businesses who offer KMD chain making please PM your contact info to me.

[13-Jun-18 02:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Meshbits is not offering any advice or chain making help at all.
We are building open source tools to help the businesses who will do so :)
so we ( Meshbits: @ns408 & @grewalstinder) are developers who target developer market.

I have created a free service that allows users to create a custom QR for their public wallet address compatible with the crypto's within the Ledger Manager App. This unique QR is fused with the cryptocurrency logo & makes it easier to identify what type of wallet address is in the QR code.
