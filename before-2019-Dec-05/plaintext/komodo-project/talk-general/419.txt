capping at 3 kmd was refused...

[04-Sep-19 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure this bit isn't going to end up too technical for most to give a fek about and stay in the convo 🤷🏽

[04-Sep-19 02:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I'd be grateful for the past years of free money from unexpected rewards.`
but.....
that's where this all becomes circular and how the conflation will end up back in the conversation
the claim is that they aren't "unexpected" and there's some math that we are too uneducated to understand which makes them known and calculable

[04-Sep-19 02:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
that s the point :(

[04-Sep-19 02:27 PM] Mylo#8306
i like your (b) & (c) reasoning CG - thanks for putting it out there.  i think it is both b&c, not a b or c.

[04-Sep-19 02:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
so just stop hunting and let luck happen ?

[04-Sep-19 02:29 PM] Mylo#8306
there is no luck because of "gigapool" - which is why everything that should happen, didn't happen for a time - and this anomaly/bug/freakish-phenomena became a _social issue_

[04-Sep-19 02:30 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah i'm not blaming, agree 100%

[04-Sep-19 02:32 PM] Mylo#8306
they are taking advantage of an anomaly/bug/freakish-phenomena.    this playing by the code rules is still happening as expected.   if an unknown miner is cherry-picking rewards, in a calculating way - do you expect other miners to not try to cherry-pick in an equally calculating way?

[04-Sep-19 02:32 PM] Mylo#8306
anomaly is big block rewards.

[04-Sep-19 02:33 PM] Mylo#8306
bug

[04-Sep-19 02:33 PM] Mylo#8306
"bug"

[04-Sep-19 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I hate that we're back in the circle now....
the total irony is that all of this is over shares that per node amount to less than I spend on 🚬 but somehow are "undeserved" by a hashrate that dwarfs any major farm
to that end I support abolishment, I was just pointing out that the hope for rewards are what keep many miners mining (even though most of them are unaware that they have almost no chance of getting them any more)
`there is no luck because of "gigapool" `
**and** hunting pool combined
have a look at the numbers and you'll see that before the "hunting pool" existed the average miner's chance was significantly higher than present

[04-Sep-19 02:33 PM] Mylo#8306
sure,

[04-Sep-19 02:33 PM] Mylo#8306
sorry i was wrong.

[04-Sep-19 02:33 PM] Mylo#8306
the anomaly is that you can flap-mine to get the block reward

[04-Sep-19 02:34 PM] Mylo#8306
if every NN flap-mined, the chain would stall

[04-Sep-19 02:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
exactly

[04-Sep-19 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if every NN flap-mined, the chain would stall`
that's an utter myth

[04-Sep-19 02:34 PM] Mylo#8306
ok, maybe "stall" is not the right word.   blocks would not be so regular.

[04-Sep-19 02:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
the problem is proof of work dies with the concept of : This is my block, go away

[04-Sep-19 02:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
people in #talk-general can get an idea how engaging chats are sometimes in NN private channel

👍 👆🏽 (2) 😆 

[04-Sep-19 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Mylo there's on average 7Msol/s on the chain and I can say with 100% certainty that number would *increase* if NNs mined less total blocks

{Reactions}
👌 

[04-Sep-19 02:36 PM] Mylo#8306
but the 25% external miner would take forever, blocks would slow down

[04-Sep-19 02:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
or maybe another totally crazy idea : stop easyming and reward with Supernet's reward claims monthly

[04-Sep-19 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`blocks would slow down`
they really wouldn't in any major way and if they did it's only a matter of minutes (measurably less than you seem to imagine) that it would happen over

[04-Sep-19 02:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
won't fit in dPoW process if removed easy mining

[04-Sep-19 02:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
yet would attract more miners, and so more potential people

[04-Sep-19 02:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
whattomine is a good indicator of flow of new people

[04-Sep-19 02:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
easy mining protects against mining difficulty explosion. but since we recently solved that with adoptive pow, assess your solution in combination to dPoW

[04-Sep-19 02:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree

[04-Sep-19 02:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
100% PoW is better for KMD

current staking can t be achieved competitively by average joe

[04-Sep-19 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Mylo fwiw: not too far back (maybe 14-18 months ago? I'm a little fuzzy on remembering exactly when) external miners carried 30%+ of the chain, the current "slow down" in what they carry is a combination of 2 protocol changes over time

[04-Sep-19 02:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the diff algo isn't perfect (which is why james and others spent a good deal of time working on apow), but it's more adaptive than you might think

[04-Sep-19 02:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`easy mining could only be replaced by hybrid mining/staking`
omfg, please no

[04-Sep-19 02:46 PM] Mylo#8306
ok thanks for historical ref CG   
i guess we won't know what would happen if flap-mining across a large amount of nodes affects things until it is done.   i am of the thinking that if a large number of nodes flap-mined, it would affect the chain - fortunately or unfortunately 🤷

[04-Sep-19 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
actually.....
I'm not on the support team, so why not 🤔

for?

[04-Sep-19 02:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i am of the thinking that if a large number of nodes flap-mined, it would affect the chain`
in short stretches, yes
in the larger scope, not as much because of the max capacity

[04-Sep-19 02:48 PM] TS#7923
So as far as I can understand the current solution is not great (for "governance"; it actually works in every other respect) but it's good enough for now. Would be better to formalize it, and that's something we should aim for in the next hard fork. Is this correct?

[04-Sep-19 02:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you should better go back to private notary node channel.

[04-Sep-19 02:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
leave this general channel for general talk

[04-Sep-19 02:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or just move to public #notarynode  channel

[04-Sep-19 02:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
this last 4+ hours of chat is all about Notary Nodes.

[04-Sep-19 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@TS to which "solution" are you referring (there's a few topics covered under this larger umbrella)?

[04-Sep-19 02:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
@grewalsatinder no, i feed on drama :troll:

[04-Sep-19 02:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you can feed yourself from #notarynode too

[04-Sep-19 02:51 PM] TS#7923
The solution James came up with; it might not be perfect but it's good enough for now. It can be changed / formalized leading up to the next hard fork. Is this correct?

[04-Sep-19 02:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
like anyone else whoever likes wasting time repeating on same thing which is already solved with consensus.

[04-Sep-19 02:51 PM] Audo#5667
I agree, this is not the right channel.

[04-Sep-19 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`this last 4+ hours of chat is all about Notary Nodes.`
as opposed to the 19 posts in as many hrs before that? :troll_lol:

no, no, drama hier :troll: nn drama is no longer satisfying

[04-Sep-19 02:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you disagree that this chat is not Notary Nodes regarding and don't think it belongs to #notarynode channel instead of #talk-general ?

[04-Sep-19 02:53 PM] mrlynch#5735
much respect @siu - Chainmakers 🤘

[04-Sep-19 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@grewalsatinder I've always had mixed beliefs on how much should be publicly accessible 🤷🏽

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you haven't answer my query.

[04-Sep-19 02:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
#notarynode is public 🤷

[04-Sep-19 02:55 PM] TS#7923
@Deleted User that's exactly what I am saying, it's good enough for short term, should be debated / formalized in the next hard fork, but until that, it works

[04-Sep-19 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you haven't answer my query.`
because, tbh, with the new membership only channel rules, I don't know which are/aren't locked anymore 😛

[04-Sep-19 02:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@mrlynch @TS @Deleted User @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 @Mylo or anyone else, please take this Notary Node chat to #notarynode and avoid this topic chat continuation here longer.

[04-Sep-19 02:56 PM] TS#7923
@Deleted User that's fair, it can be properly debated, alternatives presented, etc. Let's go over to the right channel, though. It's public, it's literally for these conversations.

[04-Sep-19 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

`it's temporary solution`
to what some of us believe isn't an actual "problem" 😛

[04-Sep-19 02:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the "solution" is the actual problem

[04-Sep-19 03:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no one saw this as a "problem" until someone decided that a specific miner/group didn't "deserve" what they earned and then it suddenly became "taking it away from NNs" (ignoring that NNs weren't previously getting this amount that was "taken away" from them at any point before)

[04-Sep-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
the numbers showed that before the sniping, notaries were getting close to the expected amounts. the sniping pool really skewed things

[04-Sep-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i knew how to hunt for blocks, years ago, but i felt it best to leave it to random chance

[04-Sep-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
once an external party started sniping, it upset the balance and the 75% wasnt 75% anymore

[04-Sep-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
who is blaming the pool

[04-Sep-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
just explaining that once external miner starts sniping, if the NN dont start doing the same, they end up with less than the targeted 75%

[04-Sep-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and NN sniping is also allowed by the rules

[04-Sep-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but if it isnt pooled, i estimated 10 or so NN would end up hunting and that would make  a significant change from the existing balance. would it be any harm? probably not, but it would be a change and it was safer to minimize the change to the overall balance

[04-Sep-19 03:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`"easymining is a privilege that shouldn't be abused"`
I didn't "ignore" that, I just didn't acknowledge it
I repeatedly asked for the parameters of "abused" and the only answer (other than a vagueish short convo that james and I had about averages) came from webby saying that anyone using the "energy saving mode" script he published should be punished for using it

[04-Sep-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
notaries should be steady mining

I acknowledge that there are several reasons, but tbh "over-mining" and "under-mining" are religated to the Court definition of porn
"I can't say exactly what it is, but I know it when I see it"
🤷🏽

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I have never seen any short conversation between you and @jl777c

well, today is a small sample

[04-Sep-19 03:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is sometimes fun, but many times only annoying coz the conversaton doesn't have an end and it gives 0 solution after hours of chat log read.

sometimes a waste, but often a little pearl of wisdom comes out.   not very efficient though.

removing rewards would lower the external hashrate, which would lower security

[04-Sep-19 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i did not see any consensus on a no-rewards hardfork`
`between CG and i`
about the same consensus that there'd be a dev hunting pool :troll:

[04-Sep-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so i would not be very excited to do that

[04-Sep-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
but it would lower the hashrate

[04-Sep-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
correct, the discussion needs to be independent of what type of miner

[04-Sep-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is important. less so than a chain without, but still the non-notarized chain is secured by hashrate alone

[04-Sep-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
the less NN that is mining, the lower the hashrate, the less the security

[04-Sep-19 03:15 PM] Mylo#8306
we are entering 'what if'' territory soon.  warning, warning.
