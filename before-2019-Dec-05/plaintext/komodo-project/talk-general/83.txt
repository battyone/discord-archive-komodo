So every team that makes proposal decides what he will promise voters ?

[29-Sep-18 09:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
some promise nothing other than doing the job (and get elected)

[29-Sep-18 09:19 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
From what I see it boils down to a promise what u gona do with the revenue from the node ?

[29-Sep-18 09:20 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
What actual job there is once u set up the node ?

[29-Sep-18 09:20 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
I assumed the node does what it does automatically ?

[29-Sep-18 09:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ensuring uptime
ensuring node is funded
Ensuring it's actively notarizing
etc

I would say a very good machine costs about 25k USD to setup and run for a year

[29-Sep-18 09:21 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
Well .. I looked at the machines on some of the winning proposals . I do have better machine that is doing nothing right now

[29-Sep-18 09:22 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
and it is not costing 25k usd

[29-Sep-18 09:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well .... saying that devs belong in kindergarten is a good start to not getting elected 🙂

[29-Sep-18 09:23 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
U are not paying attention to what I said , son

[29-Sep-18 09:23 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
Life is gona slap u right in the face if u are careless like that

[29-Sep-18 09:23 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
take it from the old man

[29-Sep-18 09:24 PM] crumb#2550
@Hungry_BullBear it's not the hardware that counts. it's the technical skills keeping things running smoothly

[29-Sep-18 09:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`answers like " it will be ready when it is ready" belong into the kindergarden
It is not serious way to do business`
Which part did I get wrong? 🤔

[29-Sep-18 09:26 PM] crumb#2550
to get elected you need to convince the KMD holders that you have necessary skills

[29-Sep-18 09:26 PM] crumb#2550
so they could vote for you

[29-Sep-18 09:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆🏿

[29-Sep-18 09:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
We have some notaries that have no personal hw and have skills enough that people voted them in

[29-Sep-18 09:28 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
OK , I see

[29-Sep-18 09:28 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
Maybe I try to get in the next election , maybe I would not but thanks for the info

[29-Sep-18 09:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You might want to take back the whole `It is not serious way to do business` thing between now and then

OK - here it is since u think u got "i got u moment here "

[29-Sep-18 09:30 PM] bishop#9773
School is in session 🍿

[29-Sep-18 09:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't think "I got you", I'm telling you how more than 1 dev took that and that we are on the bleeding edge of tech and it's taken **very** seriously

[29-Sep-18 09:31 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
The statement is 100% valid - the assumption behind it is the devs DONT consider themselves a kindergarten level minds so If that is the case it is obviously directed as constructive criticism . Any other questions I can help u with , son ?

[29-Sep-18 09:32 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
If u can not take constructive , fact based criticism you are not a grown man/woman

[29-Sep-18 09:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You can also start by not calling a black man in the southern US "son"

[29-Sep-18 09:32 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
I dont care if u are black or pink man

[29-Sep-18 09:32 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
and I dont care where you are

[29-Sep-18 09:33 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
and I call u son because I like how it sounds + I`m schooling you on some topics . I do understand the racism dynamics some people are trying to push in USA but I dont care about those games . If you choose to be offended by a word that does not carry any offense it is you personal problem and choice

[29-Sep-18 09:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`+ I'm schooling you on some topics` 😂

[29-Sep-18 09:34 PM] crumb#2550
@Hungry_BullBear don't mind the Genie. you need to spend more time here to get used to his personality. like he admitted earlier today: a lot more people in this Discord trust him, than like him

[29-Sep-18 09:34 PM] crumb#2550
just sayin'

[29-Sep-18 09:34 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
it is cool , I`m not bothered at all 😃 In fact I like my time spent in this discord

[29-Sep-18 09:35 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
I think i`ll hang around

[29-Sep-18 09:35 PM] crumb#2550
cool, wise choice

{Reactions}
🆒 

[29-Sep-18 09:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Remind me, again, what topics you "schooled me" on.... 🤔

[29-Sep-18 09:36 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
U got it written down - go back and check all my lines

[29-Sep-18 09:36 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
especially the one with the smartass

[29-Sep-18 09:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, you had that one 100% wrong, so what was the next one?

[29-Sep-18 09:37 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
U remind me of the kid in chool that is trying to be cool and make other kids pay attention to him

[29-Sep-18 09:37 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
maybe u got some growing up or dady issue

[29-Sep-18 09:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Did KMD have a trusted setup?

[29-Sep-18 10:16 PM] DesignBlock#0184
Notary Nodes only maintain Komodo Platform right? Not the Assetchains in the Platform...

[29-Sep-18 10:17 PM] Llama#1330
its everything @DesignBlock. AFAIK, it takes a snapshot of every assetchain every 10 mins

[29-Sep-18 10:31 PM] DesignBlock#0184
But Assetchains can chose their own consensus mechanism..  right? Notary Nodes just backs up the whole system.. am I right?

[30-Sep-18 01:54 AM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
Would anyone know what is the final time for infographic submissions? It says October 1st, but at what time in which time-zone? Thank you.

[30-Sep-18 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Hungry_BullBear my notary node a-team is a 10 year old server. All you need is boat loads of RAM and SSD's + very good DC internet connection nothing else is important.

[30-Sep-18 04:01 AM] DesignBlock#0184
Are all Komodo Assetchains and Crosschains transactions Anonymous? Mandatory?

[30-Sep-18 04:12 AM] actionslacks#4072
no, they are not and it is not mandatory.

[30-Sep-18 04:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Anonymity in zcash and all it’s fork is opt-in
But with #pirate anonymity is forced, without opt-out option.

[30-Sep-18 05:17 AM] snowdamn#2414
@Hungry_BullBear did you sell all your BTC for KMD yet?

[30-Sep-18 05:18 AM] snowdamn#2414
cause there ain't no way you're getting any votes for becoming NN lol 😂

[30-Sep-18 06:29 AM] shiggidy#4554
Hi had a few questions about KMD and the whitepaper.  It was extremely well written, the best whitepaper i've ever read imo. just wanted a little bit of clarification on the frequency of notary nodes winning blocks using the easy difficulty.  Is it basically one specific notary node will mine 1 block (and be rewarded 3KMD) out of every 64 KMD blocks, with the exception of the 2k block free-for-all period?

[30-Sep-18 06:30 AM] shiggidy#4554
oh shoot cant post the screenshot of the whitepaper section

[30-Sep-18 06:30 AM] shiggidy#4554
The notary nodes’ “easy difficulty” setting operates in a cyclical manner, with each notary node on its
own cycle. At the start of the cycle the notary node holds the “easy difficulty” ability until it mines one
“easy” block. Then the Iguana Core code removes the ability for the next sixty-four blocks. After the
sixty-four-block period passes, the notary node can once again attempt to capture a block on “easy
difficulty.”
Therefore, while everyone else on the network mines at an adjustable level of difficulty according to the
normal PoW consensus mechanism (which keeps the overall speed of the Komodo network stable) the
notary nodes have a chance to step outside the normal rules. For every sixty-five-block period on the
Komodo blockchain11, the odds that a block will be mined by a notary node, as opposed to a normal
miner, are essentially 3:1.

[30-Sep-18 06:30 AM] shiggidy#4554
thats the section im trying to understand

[30-Sep-18 06:31 AM] shiggidy#4554
can i interpret this as that a notary node has a 75% chance of winning a block in comparison to normal PoW miners? (excluding the free-for-all period)

[30-Sep-18 06:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No more free for all period, was changed in last update,  whitepaper needs updated. the reward split is the same 75/25.

[30-Sep-18 06:43 AM] shiggidy#4554
ah ok thanks so its 75% to notary nodes though

[30-Sep-18 06:43 AM] shiggidy#4554
and 25% to PoW?

[30-Sep-18 06:43 AM] shiggidy#4554
isnt that a bit high...

[30-Sep-18 06:46 AM] shiggidy#4554
its my understanding that 4 notary nodes are controlled by devs, 30 are auto-renewed each year and 30 are community elected.  Is there a list of who owns the 30 nodes that are auto-renewed?

[30-Sep-18 06:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
The best 30 are renewed so notaries are incentivized to keep node up as much as possible.

[30-Sep-18 06:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Bottom 30 spots are up for election

[30-Sep-18 06:56 AM] shiggidy#4554
oh thats based on up time

[30-Sep-18 06:57 AM] shiggidy#4554
can one person own multiple notary nodes?

[30-Sep-18 06:57 AM] shiggidy#4554
or is there a limit?

[30-Sep-18 06:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Noyt exactly uptime

[30-Sep-18 06:57 AM] shiggidy#4554
oh really

[30-Sep-18 06:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The system rewards nodes who respond the fastest

[30-Sep-18 06:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There are many ways to game that.

[30-Sep-18 06:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can use a higher clockspeed CPU, or optimize software

[30-Sep-18 06:58 AM] shiggidy#4554
so are the 30 picked subjectively by the devs?

that site counts ll notarizations and tallys them

[30-Sep-18 06:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@shiggidy if one has a loooot of kmd votes behind their team I suppose you could get multiple nodes elected

[30-Sep-18 06:59 AM] shiggidy#4554
ah interesting

[30-Sep-18 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ALso the nodes location relative to other nodes seems very important... which IMO needs to be looked at, becasue to get auto elected all you need is to put your node in a DC where there are already heaps of nodes... which is very bad for network decentralisation.

[30-Sep-18 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My node is a-team and is in Perth WA, the most isolated city int he world, and I have realy struggled to keep it competetive.

[30-Sep-18 07:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am also using a 10 year old server though lol...

[30-Sep-18 07:04 AM] shiggidy#4554
curious for any specific asset-chain what stops a 51% attack during the 10 minute interval that the notary nodes are performing their notarizing duties

[30-Sep-18 07:04 AM] shiggidy#4554
a 51% attack on the asset-chain

[30-Sep-18 07:05 AM] shiggidy#4554
if an altchain is submitting merkel roots to that asset-chain, is it possible that a malicious attacker could potentially 51% attack the altchain and the asset-chain simultaneously during that 10 minute window?

[30-Sep-18 07:06 AM] shiggidy#4554
to double spend?

[30-Sep-18 07:06 AM] shiggidy#4554
especially since those asset-chains typically have low hash rates?

[30-Sep-18 07:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or have one of the team answer

[30-Sep-18 07:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can answer that...

[30-Sep-18 07:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is nothing stopping you 51% attacking in between the 10 block KMD window. But timing it would be very difficult.

[30-Sep-18 07:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Most exchanges use a longer confirm time than 10 blocks anyway.

[30-Sep-18 07:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its best to wait for a notarization to happen, to consider your transaction confirmed.

[30-Sep-18 07:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the TX is reorged out of the chain, you cna just make it again.

[30-Sep-18 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or it should go back into the mempool anyway and get mined in a new block.
