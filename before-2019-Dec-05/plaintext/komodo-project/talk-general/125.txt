Still there are some other guides after this one that you can find in our knowledgebase... but still if this is your first time doing atomic swaps you can also use Hyperdex

[07-Nov-18 05:58 PM] Hermes#6934
it's more user friendly

it uses the same engine as Barterdex but has a simplier User interface

I'm excited for V44 of Agama. However going through the list of included ERC20 tokens, I don't see PayPie (PPP). Does anyone know how the ERC20 list was chosen and if so, why PPP isn't included?

[08-Nov-18 02:22 AM] Alright#0419
the list is based off of which ERC20s were already in barterdex

[08-Nov-18 06:16 AM] LarryBird#5327
@Zoroaster because it's called paypie

[08-Nov-18 06:52 AM] twistedmind#1523

is rebranding/new marketing waiting for scaling test or another milestone to be completed?

[08-Nov-18 10:47 AM] snowdamn#2414
timing can be very tricky in crypto, so concerned

[08-Nov-18 11:15 AM] Daniel CP#2020
@snowdamn  the rebrand is well under way and we're currently working with Ideas By Nature on a new logo, new typeface, new color palette. We're also getting ready to update the website while also working on a brand new website with mew messaging, the new visual identity and logo, and a new layout. It's not really dependent on the scaling test, the process just takes time.

[08-Nov-18 11:15 AM] twistedmind#1523
why rebranding? how about finishing what you started

[08-Nov-18 11:15 AM] Daniel CP#2020
The Dev team is working with AWS to prepare and schedule the big scaling test

[08-Nov-18 11:16 AM] Daniel CP#2020
So that is also under way but not related to the rebrand

[08-Nov-18 11:16 AM] Daniel CP#2020
@twistedmind what do you mean?

[08-Nov-18 11:16 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We're rebranding to improve the messaging, the logo and visual identity, build a new website, create a new GUI for Agama, and generally improve our presence and perception in the crypto space

[08-Nov-18 11:17 AM] twistedmind#1523
