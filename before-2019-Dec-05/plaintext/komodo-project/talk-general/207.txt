Rebrand and marketing is starting to catch on it seems

[11-Feb-19 08:28 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
definitely, and it's barely starting

[11-Feb-19 08:28 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
with the features on the pipeline, we'll be in a very different position by the end of 19'

the icing on the cake would be the option to migrate an Erc20, set the date to take a snapshot or create a tool to take the snapshot and import it into Chainlizard -> assetchain

@KomodoWorld stop pls, my body can only be so ready

[11-Feb-19 08:31 PM] Alecandro#1179
I'll say it again, this project is so exciting. Plus I think that this is one of the best (if not the best) projects out there. Can't wait for the price to reflect that

[11-Feb-19 08:32 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
just an idea, I'm sure something like this is in the works sooner or later

[11-Feb-19 08:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There was a channel on this

[11-Feb-19 08:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Erc20 bridge or something like that

[11-Feb-19 08:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Probably merged with another one

[11-Feb-19 08:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes, "Migration paths into a Komodo blockchain" is on the website roadmap

[11-Feb-19 08:35 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

[11-Feb-19 08:35 PM] Alecandro#1179
lets migrate  the entire crypto space into different KMD chains

[11-Feb-19 08:35 PM] Alecandro#1179
lol

[11-Feb-19 08:35 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes, seriously

[11-Feb-19 08:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
with regards to interoperability that would be amazing tbh

[11-Feb-19 08:38 PM] Alecandro#1179
KMD seriously needs to dethrone ETH as the #2 lol

[11-Feb-19 08:39 PM] ca333#0118
yes @KomodoWorld - that is correct.. our team has been working on 'automagic' migration tools. Here is a little teaser on how this would look for a BTC protocol based coin that would migrate over to KMD:

```
a) run a snapshot on height X (which gets announced as snapshot-height)
b) create new AC chain with coin-cap of a)
c) run a bunch of sendtomany to distribute the coins according to a)
d) ensure the users can access their tokens with their old privkey - so might have to provide a simple tool to calc KMD WIF out of snapshotchain (origin) WIF 
```

```Nothing ever gets changed with feedback like that```
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  In reference to BarterDEX GUI: One of the most important things you and @hyperDEX  can do is have an available help file. Either you can hover over each clickable icon and a pop-up explains what it is, or perhaps a clickable question mark next to each where a text file (that downloaded with the program) pops up and tells you what each icon does.  This will help with the learning curve and cut down on the same questions being asked over and over again.

[11-Feb-19 08:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@yorklab satinder started to add that to BarterDEX GUI and the reception was luke-warm at best (but I will keep that in mind for my fork)
Interesting to note:
When I asked `so, what's "bad" about the layout of BarterDEX GUI?` she stopped responding and this has been the main issue since day 1 ☹

[11-Feb-19 08:48 PM] jansako#3330
Good UX is better than tooltips...  those are just crutches...

[11-Feb-19 08:49 PM] jansako#3330
I am definitely looking forward to v2

[11-Feb-19 08:49 PM] jansako#3330
lots of feedback willb e incoming

[11-Feb-19 08:49 PM] jansako#3330
v2 UI I mean...

[11-Feb-19 08:49 PM] yorklab#7270
Of course, but you can't assume it's perfect and not everyone has the same knowledge, some of us have to start from the beginning.

[11-Feb-19 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL without feedback, v2 = v1 with a different backend that you never see

[11-Feb-19 08:50 PM] jansako#3330
I stopped giving v1 feedback after I was told UI changes won;t be made until v2 comes out

[11-Feb-19 08:50 PM] jansako#3330
chicken-egg problem, but the team decides what is more important

[11-Feb-19 08:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
after a while once you understood the concept barterdex worked fine for me

[11-Feb-19 08:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I stopped giving v1 feedback after I was told it UI chagnes won;t be made until v2 comes out`
there stopped being any real interest a good 6 months before that 😕

[11-Feb-19 08:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
set the price a little bit higher to improve chances of ordermatching, play around with utxo's for a while

[11-Feb-19 08:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
once a trade got through keep repeating that trade untill bob is out of those utxos

[11-Feb-19 08:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
play around untill you find new matching utxo's

[11-Feb-19 08:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but for mm2 those things should be a thing of the past anyway

[11-Feb-19 08:53 PM] jansako#3330
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I am talking more or less a year ago... I helped out on Hyperdex for a bit too, but UX there also stalled on mm v1

[11-Feb-19 08:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`chicken-egg problem, but the team decides what is more important`
BarterDEX GUI was only a "team" project by default of a smaller community at that time; __literally__ everyone was asked to participate in whatever capacity they could

[11-Feb-19 08:53 PM] jansako#3330
I know, I was there...

[11-Feb-19 08:54 PM] jansako#3330
probably did a couple of thousand trades in total

[11-Feb-19 08:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I stopped working on it because I got tired of asking the same question I'm still asking and getting the same 0 response I'm still getting

[11-Feb-19 08:55 PM] jansako#3330
so let's pick it up again once v2 is ready to be shown... so what if on day 1 it looks like v1?

[11-Feb-19 08:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so what if on day 1 it looks like v1?`
You'll hate it as much as you do v1 :troll:

[11-Feb-19 08:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
a lot of user complaints were that they got no matches and they didnt know why

[11-Feb-19 08:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so they think it's a gui issue

[11-Feb-19 08:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
while it was mm

[11-Feb-19 08:57 PM] jansako#3330
I don't hate v1...

[11-Feb-19 08:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's that too @Cryptoon

[11-Feb-19 08:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
once people get to testing, and trades go through easily, they will be able to more specifically point to gui/ux flaws

[11-Feb-19 08:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I don't hate v1...`
"you" in the general sense, not "you" singular

[11-Feb-19 08:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
now people dont know for sure what the problem is

[11-Feb-19 08:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
my plan is to start testing when mm2.0 is there; and just comment as many things as pop into my head as possible

[11-Feb-19 08:58 PM] jansako#3330
it is the job of UX to make sure you never have to wonder

[11-Feb-19 08:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and then designers/devs can use the comments to adjust where needed

[11-Feb-19 08:59 PM] jansako#3330
issues/problems should not even be shown in the UI, it should be solved by the code on the back end... I know, easy to say...

[11-Feb-19 08:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it is the job of UX to make sure you never have to wonder`
That's a great insight, as long as the U can describe their X and tell the GUI dev what makes it a not good X for the U
We aren't mind readers

[11-Feb-19 08:59 PM] jansako#3330
I will leave work at work...

[11-Feb-19 09:00 PM] jansako#3330
For sure.

[11-Feb-19 09:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`issues/problems should not even be shown in the UI, it should be solved by the code on the back end...`
We tried that and got 10000000000000000 complaints of "It's not doing anything when I click it"

...progress bar... :troll_cool:

[11-Feb-19 09:02 PM] ca333#0118
the problems of MM1 were resolved in MM2 - its a very solid/stable piece of p2p/blockchain software. i have actively tested/debugged it and am amazed by its efficiency. not does it only come with native mobile support but also as a standalone enduser product. so each node does cover the full functionality scope. Furthermore does MM2 utilize state of the art p2p network/cryptographic technology: libtorrent/DHT network acts as the offchain layer (ordermatching, orderbooks, net commz, etc.). 

We recently hired a fulltime mobile dev who is currently working on a MM2 mobile GUI app.

`...progress bar... `
and how do you convey on a progress bar that a trade didn't complete? Back to 0? and the user is like 'dafuq? why u no trade? u suck!'

@jansako yes we have a Desktop GUI dev who is also working fulltime for us. He is currently in the final dev-mile of the BaaS (automagic blockchain generator system) before we will initiate the Desktop version of the MM2 GUI app. Here the same path will be taken. Only solid and state of the art technology that is proven stable and solid. (C++ & QT)

let me ask you like this @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 - if you had the choice between Javascript + nodejs/NPM ecosystem OR C++ & QT - which one would you take?

[11-Feb-19 09:09 PM] ca333#0118
for sake of security, etc.

[11-Feb-19 09:09 PM] ca333#0118
QT is certified and used in critical systems...

[11-Feb-19 09:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that it's used does not equate to it being good (case in point: FedEX still uses VB4 applications in many regions 🤦🏽 )

@ca333 hope we get to test/comment on the UI before it gets too far & stuff gets locked down...

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 - which recommendation would you make as for the chosen UI tech and coding lang? We have looked into alternatives like python QT combination (like electrum) and also into rust and rust based GUI libs. However since our GUI dev is an experience C++ dev and knows QT we chose that tech layer before going an "experimental" path.. we really just want to provide smooth/userfriendly experience in the "most secure way possible".

@ca333 I'm in no way saying that QT can't do the job or that it's not among the "better" of the cross-platform options; but that when you say "QT", I (and most people) instantly get the mental image of the same tired clunky apps that QT has been associated with since day 1
