Lets say we start refuting the claims publicly, we give them access to the klout komodo brings

[15-May-19 09:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Might even be what they want... trigger people into engaging with them for more exposure

[15-May-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810

Maybe, sometimes you just got to bite back  in relation to BLOCK maybe an article that logically expresses the inaccuracies  stating  the clear differences to avoid misconception , I think they have a different version of what a DEX means to them

 @Instel7 true, it was historically the whole used for the part; but cocaine itself was available in every corner store in the US for well over 150 years

`it really drags people into a death spiral.`
You're conflating a drug and abuse of that drug

From the latest Zaddex update, "ZADDEX project will use ZEXO and ARRR for its platform".

Why no KMD? Kinda goes against building the Komodo network effect, no?

[15-May-19 03:48 PM] PTYX#6840
maybe they don't like kmd

@Edward How does using something in the Komodo ecosystem "go against" the Komodo ecosystem?
`maybe they don't like kmd`
maybe they support privacy

[15-May-19 03:49 PM] PTYX#6840
or if it's meant to be a private platform, kmd doesn't have jumblr anymore. so sexo and arrr are the goto

[15-May-19 03:51 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
dPOW is using kmd

[15-May-19 03:52 PM] PTYX#6840
Doesnt zaddex have kmd trading pairs though?
