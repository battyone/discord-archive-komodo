seed length can be any thing??

[01-Feb-19 11:30 PM] Decker#3767
Ok, guys ... Let me introduce one "ultra-easy" puzzle "based" on previous one. Rules are simple:

1. https://kmdexplorer.io/address/RKPGAoV72Z53cqTnfRuhLquzmHPyyVuGX3 - here is the address with bounty. **25 KMD**.
2. No hidden rules, no bugs exploitation.
3. Don't need to calc something, solve sudokues, or something like it.
4. I call this puzzle "ultra-easy" bcz passphrase is **ONLY 1 CHAR LONG** . Yes, length of passphrase is 1 symbol.
5. No hints ... with 1 char - you don't need any hints ))

p.s. Except one: This is **crypto** puzzle ))

[01-Feb-19 11:32 PM] Decker#3767
Who will be first? ) He-he ... )

[01-Feb-19 11:36 PM] Gawain#7858
it's not ⯄ heh

[01-Feb-19 11:36 PM] Gawain#7858
i also tried `ONLY 1 CHAR LONG . Yes, length of passphrase is 1 symbol.` 😆

[01-Feb-19 11:41 PM] Decker#3767
What could be easier? Just one character ))

[01-Feb-19 11:43 PM] ca333#0118
haha nice one @Decker

[01-Feb-19 11:43 PM] ca333#0118

starting from there you should be able to build it and launch it. plz let me know if any obstacles.

[01-Feb-19 11:48 PM] ca333#0118
i set up a fresh ubuntu 18.04 and will simulate a fresh install - so will see if anything is missing

ps. @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Agama running fine via new README

[02-Feb-19 12:15 AM] ca333#0118
i additinoally installed build-essential as a dependency

[02-Feb-19 12:16 AM] ca333#0118
i am used to that one and install it automatically since i am gonna build komodo too.

[02-Feb-19 12:16 AM] ca333#0118
i will add this step to the README.

[02-Feb-19 12:16 AM] ca333#0118
bundling and building osx/linux will be fine. for WIN you ll need to go through a crosscompilation hackaround. just ping me whenever you want to build for WIN.

[02-Feb-19 12:21 AM] kolo#1111
So my assumption answer is jl777 was correct, just \n was missing. Yay

[02-Feb-19 12:22 AM] ca333#0118
exactly @kolo

@Decker was asking me yesterday what can be heart. First and only assumption was jl777

Ok, here is ultra simple question to have 25 KMD more: *Who is jl777?*
https://kmdexplorer.ru/address/RUyHtDJ96SamrgapcMEUE3QYdUc5kcfLTb
Seed is the answer, or answer is the seed, whatever fits better.

[02-Feb-19 12:39 AM] kolo#1111
@ca333 it's your chance. @Decker doesn't know answer, but you know

[02-Feb-19 01:36 AM] williamkeffer93#6847
So what was the answer to the riddle? And what did it have to do with a bug? I tried the whole time on agama mobile lol

[02-Feb-19 01:51 AM] Decker#3767
@williamkeffer93 which one? with sudoku or with one-char-passphrase?

[02-Feb-19 01:52 AM] Decker#3767

Hey yall.   Do you like games?
:scallywag: Ahoy mateys! With great pleasure we announce the opening of the first cycle of 

🎉 ARRR LOTTERY 🎉

🍀 ARRR Lottery is a raffle-type lottery game, played in cycles. 

ℹ The cycle is opened by the lottery administrator, and ended automatically by the lottery bot after 7 day(s). The winners will be announced in #pirate-chat .

🏆 There will be 3 randomly selected winners, winning 80%, 10%, 5% from the pot, respectively. The remaining ARRR will be used to start the next lottery cycle. 

🎟 Buy tickets by issuing the !arrrtip buyticket amount command (specify the amount of your choosing; minimal amount to buy is 1 ARRR). You can also buy tickets in direct messages, or in privacy mode by appending private to the command. You can buy an arbitrary amount of tickets - the more tickets you buy, the greater your chances will be in the drawing.

🗒 At all times, all bought lottery tickets for cycle can be audited by issuing the !arrrtip lotterytickets command (data is anonymized).

💡 At all times you can get help by issuing the !arrrtip lotterymanual command. 
💡 To see current lottery cycle info, including the tickets you bought (delivered in DM), issue the !arrrtip lottery command.

Have a great weekend!

you re welcome @Strob - next week we will continue with the next cryptopuzzle. i promise it will be more fun. 1 picture = 3 different seeds hidden (3 different levels: easy, mid, hard)

[02-Feb-19 07:47 AM] ca333#0118
@kolo haha nice - now you did a puzzle too!!? I will check it shortly - have couple of tasks first. @Decker have you tried it? ps your puzzle was cool and i will use the idea for the next puzzle - first i used a bruteforcer on my std ASCII table (even NUL, del, EOF, etc.) but i saw its nothing from there. Then i downloaded extended char table with more symbols (incl. 'crypto') and it worked immdiately.. 😃

just to confirm - you ve did the first part and launched up the frontend process
aftwards you launched up a new terminal (while frontend is running) to spin up the Agama electron app ??

[02-Feb-19 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, I followed the readme exactly

[02-Feb-19 12:46 PM] ca333#0118
ok - i ve tested it on ubuntu 18.04 - i am spinning up my debian 9 machine and will test here
