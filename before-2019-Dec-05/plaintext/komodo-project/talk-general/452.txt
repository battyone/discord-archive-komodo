@zenosama  haven‚Äôt been any for awhile but people are free to do them if they wish

[19-Nov-19 09:39 AM] zenosama#5371
Is there a github repo?

[19-Nov-19 09:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
A dico is just when you use a decentralized exchange to conduct the coin/token sale.   Would need to make an Atomicdex compatible coin and get listed in the GUI then your good to go

And is there support on erc-20?

[19-Nov-19 09:59 AM] Oszy#5734
yes

[19-Nov-19 10:00 AM] Oszy#5734
`not all erc20 are compatible, some have made changes. that is why we need proof of atomic swap before it can be added to atomicDEX app`

[19-Nov-19 10:00 AM] Oszy#5734
you can test first

[19-Nov-19 10:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If you launch your coin as an independent komodo smart chain integration in atomicdex and wallet is pretty easy and cheaper compared to other coins I believe.

[19-Nov-19 10:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
You can check antara blockchain composer or ask @PTYX or @jorian to know what the options are üôÇ

[19-Nov-19 10:25 AM] zenosama#5371
You mean creating a coin with antara composer is better than an erc-20 token?

[19-Nov-19 10:28 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, launching a Smart Chain (either by yourself using the docs or using Antara composer), will give you a new blockchain that has Antara modules enabled(smart contract equivalent). you and your community won't have to pay gas fees for transactions there is no platform lockin etc.,

[19-Nov-19 11:33 AM] sœÜldat#8733
Creating a coin is always better than a simple token

Hi, there are any list of cryptos protected by dPoW? and other list of failed 51% attacks to this cryptos protected?

[19-Nov-19 01:40 PM] beor#1569
And other question, for non english native, there are any resource for how to pronounce crypto words related, i.e.: UTXO, nonce, merkle, etc...

[19-Nov-19 01:44 PM] Audo#5667
here we mention 6 third party chains with dPoW https://komodoplatform.com/blockchain-security-service/

There's also some github link that lists all dPoW protected chains but I don't have that handy right now

AI algo in C/C++ will be easy to put into an antara module

[21-Nov-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
that being said, AI on blockchain is trendy and buzzwordy, but in most cases not the efficient way to do an AI project. the issue is in distributing the training data to all the nodes. for any meaningful AI project, this dataset will be large and evolving and distributing it to different nodes, which then presumably try to create improved models... it is quite inefficient

[21-Nov-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
a much more efficient approach is to just create AI models with the dataset using a centralized dataset, but then the issue becomes why to blockchain the AI modeling at all? if to open up the model creation to "miners" the issue becomes what is a big enough improvement to warrant getting a block. and what prevents things from become stranded or overfitted to the dataset

[21-Nov-19 09:45 AM] LocoMB#8593

I don't know what the situation with the so called DuneDex, which is supposedly going to be related to AtomicDex, but I hope Komodo will stay away from anything which involves Fabien from Zaddex/OUR/Genevieve/Dun etc...

[21-Nov-19 04:43 PM] Oszy#5734
Nothing, they wanted / want to use atomicdex tech is all we know

[21-Nov-19 04:45 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I guess there is little to nothing that can be done from stopping someone from developing a GUI to use the API, but at the least I hope Komodo will not endorse or support it

[21-Nov-19 04:46 PM] FOOTHILLS#3886
I have another question on Agama - just loaded it and restored wallet I havent clamed rewards since july.  I did have a reward to claim but it amounted only to what I would get in one month.  Should have been for 4 months.  FYI opened the lite wallet instead of Native.  Is Agama not generating rewards any longer?

[21-Nov-19 04:46 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Stop generating after a month

[21-Nov-19 04:47 PM] FOOTHILLS#3886
Not sure what that means - I have to open every month to keep it generating?

[21-Nov-19 04:48 PM] Oszy#5734
claim every month

[21-Nov-19 04:48 PM] gcharang#6833
you have to claim rewards atleast once a month

[21-Nov-19 04:49 PM] FOOTHILLS#3886
Oh didnt use to be like that - last year I only clamed one time and got all 12 months.  Thank you for setting me straight.

[21-Nov-19 04:59 PM] gcharang#6833
@FOOTHILLS yes, the mechanism changed since last year
have to claim monthly, but the total for an year still adds upto 5.1%
