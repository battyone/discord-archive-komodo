Bram Cohen invented BitTorrent protocol, so his opinions carry some weight

[12-Apr-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
I wonder if jl777 has maybe invented/discovered some things that Bram has never seen/heard of, I would not be surprised.

[12-Apr-19 12:58 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the research by Phil Daian they're reffering to is related to ethereum DEXs, I asked him about BarteDex that seems immune to the points he raises. I never got a proper answer

[12-Apr-19 01:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@KomodoWorld i highly doubt Bram knows about jl's way of implementing a DEX, and would perhaps change some of his opinions

[12-Apr-19 01:03 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think so as well. It's very different from those other dex

[12-Apr-19 01:04 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
once barterdex is in open beta I can ask him a quote for an indepth analysis, he seems a clever guy

[12-Apr-19 01:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
is this the latest barterdex wp? https://github.com/SuperNETorg/komodo/wiki/barterDEX-Whitepaper-v2

it's like 17 KMD brands ago :abusedsmily:

[12-Apr-19 01:06 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
from what I've read the new core has important differences, perhaps I can ask him once the new wp is ready

[12-Apr-19 01:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
if I wanted to point Bram to the latest WP for BarterDEX, where would I send him?

[12-Apr-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt exist

[12-Apr-19 01:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
I know that the new maketmaker is very new, but the core of BarterDEX API has not changed

[12-Apr-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
we debug it first, then write it up

[12-Apr-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
some important changes to mm2, like it uses torrent

[12-Apr-19 01:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
very interesting indeed

[12-Apr-19 01:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c mostly I want to see what Bram has to say about KMD-flavored DEX, he is mostly talking about ETH-flavor DEX

[12-Apr-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
he is talking about onchain "DEX"

[12-Apr-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
offchain dex with all prices broadcast to everyone... there isnt anything to frontrun or reorder

[12-Apr-19 01:13 PM] PTYX#6840
@saturday make sure your rising the latest kmd app from the ledger manager

[12-Apr-19 01:13 PM] PTYX#6840
To update you delete and reinstall the kmd app.

[12-Apr-19 01:13 PM] PTYX#6840
Let me know if you're still having issues claiming afterwards.

[12-Apr-19 01:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c can you describe why torrents are being used? Which attacks does it prevent or how does that optimize mm2?

[12-Apr-19 01:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't want to say something dumb about torrents to Bram on twitter 👼

[12-Apr-19 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it achieves much better p2p connectivity

{Reactions}
👍 

[12-Apr-19 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
and I can imagine all the ways that makes many attacks harder for network adversaries, thanks

@bramcohen in $KMD world we do off-chain DEX with all prices broadcast to everyone, which fixes frontrunning/reorder issues. This is a very old whitepaper describing it, a newer version is being worked on which uses torrents to optimize P2P connectivity:  https://t.co/YvOK...

a huge number of people piled onto that twitter thread, so at the very least many new people will hear about KMD-flavored DEX, and how our tech sounds orders of magnitudes better than what is happening in ETH world

[12-Apr-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
sounds?

[12-Apr-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe "is"

[12-Apr-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
but not more than one order of magnitude

that sounds silly

[12-Apr-19 01:45 PM] klein#5233
or purposefully hiding

[12-Apr-19 01:45 PM] klein#5233
why?

[12-Apr-19 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think he means along the lines of what this abstract describes: <https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2018/project/Jain-Nene-Noel-Anand-DarkPool.pdf>

[12-Apr-19 01:45 PM] klein#5233
ok thanks I"m a noob on this material

[12-Apr-19 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can only see it if you're an involved party

[12-Apr-19 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, the context is different, but the concept carrys imo

[12-Apr-19 01:48 PM] klein#5233
oh ok I get it

[12-Apr-19 01:50 PM] klein#5233
but the premise is flawed to begin with

[12-Apr-19 01:53 PM] klein#5233
I can see why you would want to obfuscate information from parasites

[12-Apr-19 01:53 PM] klein#5233
or just not have a venue that enable parasitic behavior to begin with

[12-Apr-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that miners that control the order of tx have perfect information and can make riskless trades to take advantage of the orderflow

[12-Apr-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the solution is to not have miners in the process

[12-Apr-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
but that of course requires an offchain DEX with no single orderbook

[12-Apr-19 02:00 PM] klein#5233
I''ve still got a lot to reading to do understand the non financial technical part

[12-Apr-19 02:02 PM] klein#5233
makes sense

[12-Apr-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
its like having a single broker handle ALL trades from everybody

[12-Apr-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to trust that they wont front run

[12-Apr-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and any system that has a single broker who has no reason not to take advantage of free money....

[12-Apr-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i think on some stock markets there are specialists who are charged with making a market, but they have specific responsibilities and would lose their monopoly position if they abuse it

[12-Apr-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
in a decentralized system, it can be anybody, even somebody you are trading with

[12-Apr-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
would you trade against your broker, knowing he knows the entire orderflow?

[12-Apr-19 02:09 PM] klein#5233
correct exchange and mm are supposed to be two separate entities

[12-Apr-19 02:09 PM] klein#5233
unless you are talking cfds or forex

[12-Apr-19 02:32 PM] CHMEX#0686
Is supernet acting as escrow for other holdings it has?

[12-Apr-19 02:32 PM] CHMEX#0686
Maybe MNZ if thats still a thing?

[12-Apr-19 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
MNZ it is holding for people who bought it via private sale, but nobody seems to want it as it seems pretty dead

[12-Apr-19 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the only one I can think of that it is being escrow, but so many projects now, cant remember it all

[12-Apr-19 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_mined 8 MNZ_

[12-Apr-19 02:36 PM] CHMEX#0686
Thanks for the clarification

[12-Apr-19 02:36 PM] crumb#2550
in addition to being escrow how much RFOX does SuperNET hold?

[12-Apr-19 02:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Can i buy the private key for supernet wallet? :-)`
not the one you want, but I'll sell you one of *my* SUPERNET keys for 10000 KMD

[12-Apr-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
RFOX will be released over some years, i am not 100% sure on the exact distribution
