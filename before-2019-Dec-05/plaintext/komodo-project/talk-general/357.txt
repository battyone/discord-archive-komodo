plz wait for larger amounts, i am waiting for an updated claim form and will gradually process larger and larger amounts

[10-Jun-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
as of now, threshold is still 7777 KMD

[10-Jun-19 10:41 AM] bennejoon#8903
I did all the steps for refund but I can`t get back my KMD yet.(below 7777)
Does it mean that I did something wrong? or shoud I just wait?

[10-Jun-19 10:43 AM] gobi#1545
Wait up to 48 hrs total then ask in the support channel if no movement I would say

[10-Jun-19 10:44 AM] gobi#1545
I've literally just sent in my (KMD only) forms just now. Depending on when James runs the daily shunt I might have my KMD in 5 minutes or 23hrs 59 minutes, or a day extra will pass.

[10-Jun-19 10:45 AM] gobi#1545
There's nothing to sweat unless you have a need to close out your position, but then again the exchanges are mostly all halted atm anyway, so yeah.

[10-Jun-19 10:51 AM] gcharang#6833
@bennejoon have you sent the small transaction from old address to new?

[10-Jun-19 10:57 AM] Magnum Wallet#0608
With reference to the recent issues with Agama, we want to remind you that you can use Komodo in the Magnum Wallet, where the vulnerability had not been detected. For added security, you can manage your KMD with the Ledger Nano S/X devices. Remember that you can also claim rewards in Magnum. If you have any questions, we'll be happy to answer them.

[10-Jun-19 11:01 AM] bennejoon#8903
@gcharang  yes I have

[10-Jun-19 11:06 AM] gcharang#6833
@bennejoon then please wait

[10-Jun-19 11:40 AM] SHossain#0007
@bennejoon you have submitted the claims form more than once and each time you put a different refund address. your claim is in the disputed category and will be processed at the end of normal refund.

[10-Jun-19 01:12 PM] lluisin#7655
Hello, I wonder why my sweept address which was larger than 7777KMD got some dust received last 7th? is this a scammer hoping that i move this dust to my safe address to learn which address is?

[10-Jun-19 01:15 PM] SHossain#0007
@lluisin that was verification funds. read here https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident

[10-Jun-19 01:16 PM] lluisin#7655
but i thought you only sent the dust to  claims lower than 7777KMD?

[10-Jun-19 01:17 PM] SHossain#0007
it was sent for all affected addresses

[10-Jun-19 01:17 PM] lluisin#7655
ah understood

[10-Jun-19 01:17 PM] lluisin#7655

[10-Jun-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810

[10-Jun-19 01:23 PM] lluisin#7655

Hey friends is it safe to use Agama again? And was Agama andriod impacted?
Should we be expecting a new release or something? @ca333

[10-Jun-19 01:44 PM] gcharang#6833
@aka222 don't use the KMD version of Agama for now.
Uninstall it if you have it, uninstall the mobile version too
For now use the Verus version of Agama

There might be a future version of Agama from Komodo, but no ETA or confirmation. Please wait for announcements

[10-Jun-19 01:48 PM] bennejoon#8903
@SHossain Yes, I changed my refund address one time and I sent the dust to the last refund address.
So now, What I have to do is waiting for the end of normal refund?

[10-Jun-19 01:51 PM] SHossain#0007
you claimed for 2 addresses. first time you put same address for refund of both address. then, you changed them to receive into 2 diffirent addresses

[10-Jun-19 01:52 PM] SHossain#0007

i processed todays batch, of about 100 refunds, for approx 400,000 KMD. All properly claimed refunds smaller than 17777 KMD has been processed. I still see almost 200 who have not sent the funds from old address to new address. but at least we have about one third of the impacted accounts refunded already. 

if you did not receive a refund, then please contact support

[10-Jun-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
now we are waiting for users to submit claims and do the transaction from old to new. i have the KMD process mostly automated on my side, but support has to manually update the claims data, so it is just a lot of work left to do. I will start on the assetchains later this week as i gradually increase the refund processor threshold
