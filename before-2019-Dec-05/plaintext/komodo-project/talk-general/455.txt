I reported this guy to Discord

[29-Nov-19 12:27 PM] Jeffrey#2716
Discord literally told me they don't care and wont ban him

[29-Nov-19 12:28 PM] Oszy#5734
yeah they don't

[29-Nov-19 12:28 PM] Jeffrey#2716
I called them out, And then they said 2 weeks ago they will investigate but won't tell me the outcome of the investigation

[29-Nov-19 12:28 PM] Jeffrey#2716
Guess they still enjoy his presence scamming users

[29-Nov-19 12:28 PM] Jeffrey#2716
He stole over 3000 usd from users in our channel

[29-Nov-19 12:28 PM] Jeffrey#2716
We need a new system, Discord is pathetic.

[29-Nov-19 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Their support is slack and honestly they don't care

[29-Nov-19 12:29 PM] Jeffrey#2716

What are the dangers of blockchain game platforms? Aren't they more susceptible to cheating since value is attached? Bots would be a big issue I think. Any advantages or disadvantages to current centralized systems?

[30-Nov-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
less cheating as the blockchain can guarantee the game was actually played and not just that someone tweaked some files in the centralized DB

[30-Nov-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
any bots that work on the decentralized version would also work on the centralized, so both share that same issue

[30-Nov-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it isnt any specific disadvantage of blockchain games, just something all games have

[30-Nov-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
disadvantage would be that blockchain games will be slower for the operations as compared to a centralized DB.

@cascrypto I think you are why you tell me and it does not deserve to answer you, that is why I will not notice you. It is also good that administrators do not put all the fools in mind.
