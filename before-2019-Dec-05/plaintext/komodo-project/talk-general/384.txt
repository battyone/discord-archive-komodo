But the Mastering Ethereum  Andreasauthor said that in the first 2017 wave of mania, people used these newly-created programmable blockchains “to build platforms to do massive pump and dumps” instead of building projects focused on privacy and censorship resistance

Debugging is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you're going to start crying at inappropriate times.

the site, the background? its a common used background . I have seen it on many (scam) ico's

interactive background

[04-Jul-19 04:03 PM] Tek#5253
i know the site is not the product

[04-Jul-19 04:03 PM] Tek#5253
but you could have picked something less generic. this does not put trust in

[04-Jul-19 04:04 PM] Tek#5253
tell this to your marketing agaency or something whatever

you don't have to change it. I'm just telling youu what some people will think.

[04-Jul-19 04:39 PM] Audo#5667
Our agency IBN is focusing on the rebranded Komodo site. The AtomicDEX site uses a template we found and implemented on our own.

[04-Jul-19 04:40 PM] Tek#5253
Just letting you know that the theme is very generic and has been used by lots of shady projects.

[04-Jul-19 04:40 PM] hastrup#8742
And a lot of good ones

[04-Jul-19 04:40 PM] hastrup#8742
More good then scams

[04-Jul-19 04:40 PM] Tek#5253
yes many good sites also use it. it's very overused.

I don't think it overused. It's the blockchain theme.

[04-Jul-19 07:22 PM] Steve Lee#1967
@Tek We appreciate your feedback, and I agree it is an overused theme. Due to the agency fully focusing on the rebrand, the atomicdex site was done internally by the team. After we get the rebrand launched we will be working on improving the atomicdex site for its full release.

[04-Jul-19 07:26 PM] LocoMB#8593
I have to admit I agree with @Tek -that pseudo-matrixi-cyberiy-flashy-wiggly is not only annoying and cheap effect, but also associated with a lot of fishy websites .. sorry, just a superficial optical detail, but it literally jumps into the the eye

those who don't like the particle effect, you can just right-click => inspect => right-click again on the selected element then choose 'Delete element' (the `<canvas class='particle...'`) :abusedsmily:

[04-Jul-19 09:42 PM] Malti#3948
If I read the article on atomic swaps correct. Is it correct that you need double of the funds you want to swap?

[04-Jul-19 09:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Which article?

[04-Jul-19 09:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The one on the history of swaps?

@Audo
If I look at the atomicdex.io, it only says komodoplatform at the bottom. wouldn't it be better to mention komodo multiple times on that website? 
If the website gets a lot of attention, I think it would be smart to promote Komodo there also.
Maybe AtomicDEX by Komodo.

Is magnum wallet a Komodo partner? Their wallet is really easy to use (and fast).

[05-Jul-19 01:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@rainbro7 they are a closed sourced wallet provider

[05-Jul-19 01:52 AM] PTYX#6840
@rainbro7 they now support trezor KMD if i'm not mistaken but the claim function is still being worked on. Ledger claiming works fine.
