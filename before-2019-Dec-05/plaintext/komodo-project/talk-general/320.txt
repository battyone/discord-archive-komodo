rather than leave them for a potential hacker to compromise

[05-Jun-19 12:07 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
they did the right thing imo

[05-Jun-19 12:07 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
i think other coins affected too

[05-Jun-19 12:07 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
and no ones kmd has been taken yet

[05-Jun-19 12:07 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
but they are taking all the precautions

[05-Jun-19 12:07 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
and the guide above is how to secure your funds, or how to claim back from the ones which they swept from vulnerable addresses

[05-Jun-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810

[05-Jun-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810

who holds the privkey for that safe address?

[05-Jun-19 12:08 PM] shorn#3406
is it multisig?

[05-Jun-19 12:08 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
My komodo is gone

[05-Jun-19 12:09 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239

[05-Jun-19 12:09 PM] tomsmith26#8707
@Crabby Paddy  yes. it's right

[05-Jun-19 12:09 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
What? The instructions said to move to new address, but funds are gone

[05-Jun-19 12:09 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
move if your funds havent been swept by the team already @Potato Guy 9000

[05-Jun-19 12:09 PM] tomsmith26#8707
How can I get back my kmd  funds

[05-Jun-19 12:10 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
instructions refer to those with funds still in their wallet

[05-Jun-19 12:10 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239

[05-Jun-19 12:11 PM] shorn#3406
ok. funds are showing in web agama but not app

[05-Jun-19 12:12 PM] shorn#3406
so I'll move them. but interested to know who owns the keys for safe address and if this applies to any Komodo wallet I use in future

[05-Jun-19 12:12 PM] gcharang#6833
@shorn taht means you still have them
but please create a new seed in verus agama nad move them out

[05-Jun-19 12:12 PM] shorn#3406
@gcharang will do thanks

[05-Jun-19 12:12 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
(and this missing claims fund form can't be hacked by someone masquerading as someone else on discord - ppl are giving out their deets and kmd addresses and amounts)....???

[05-Jun-19 12:12 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Guide should probably have stated "IF YOU OPEN AGAMA YOUR FUNDS WILL BE GONE" THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL

[05-Jun-19 12:12 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@CheeseBaby  no ones giving out private key

[05-Jun-19 12:12 PM] tomsmith26#8707
@Crabby Paddy  what kind of wallet address is safe for getting back my KMD funds ?

[05-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Potato Guy 9000  doesnt have anything to do with opening or not

[05-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
its wallet creation stages, not opening now which compromises

[05-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@tomsmith26  easiest is download veruscoin.io wallet

[05-Jun-19 12:13 PM] cryptovitamins#5452
so im using komodo web wallet to send coins out,and it says transactions are unconfirmed. how long will it take to confirm?

[05-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
send funds to there

[05-Jun-19 12:13 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
ok cool!

[05-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
(Y) all in the guides posted above in #support

[05-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@cryptovitamins  a few minutes at most

[05-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
usual block times

[05-Jun-19 12:15 PM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
except for agama which komodo wallet can we use ? apart form versus coin wallet ?

[05-Jun-19 12:15 PM] tomsmith26#8707
how about the komodo QT  win wallet ?

[05-Jun-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes oceanQT is a good wallet

[05-Jun-19 12:16 PM] gcharang#6833
@tomsmith26 https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000027990-install-komodo-ocean-wallet-on-windows
but create an address there and send to it as soon as possible

[05-Jun-19 12:18 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499

[05-Jun-19 12:19 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499

[05-Jun-19 12:19 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499

[05-Jun-19 12:22 PM] cryptovitamins#5452
is says wallet is only verified by single server, is it safe to confirm?

[05-Jun-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, cant be too picky when dealing with what we are dealing with

[05-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
on the missing finds form. it's "Coin Name - Address - Amount - TXID" is the Address the destination  address or my address?

[05-Jun-19 12:25 PM] cryptovitamins#5452
just to make sure, so protocol is download verus agama wallet. create new wallet. send funds from old agama to new verus wallet?

[05-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Potato Guy 9000 send funds and your rewards will go back to your address

[05-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239

[05-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499

[05-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
So the address that funds got taken from was created by Guarda wallet.

[05-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
FYI

[05-Jun-19 12:30 PM] gcharang#6833
@Potato Guy 9000 but the seed was used in agama?

[05-Jun-19 12:31 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
I imported the keys into agama

[05-Jun-19 12:31 PM] gcharang#6833
then thats a known issue

[05-Jun-19 12:31 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
ok

[05-Jun-19 12:31 PM] gcharang#6833
either created in agama or used in it, both were compromised

on agama web wallet, its taking a very long time to process a transaction. I confirm amount i want to send, and the following screen the transaction result is just "processing transaction"

[05-Jun-19 12:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you have the seed you can import that in chameleon pay to send to another safe address

[05-Jun-19 12:50 PM] cryptovitamins#5452

It would be nice if the vulnerability was disclosed to other wallets as well before a public announcement of the details is made.

[05-Jun-19 12:58 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Andy I presume that‚Äôs why it hasn‚Äôt been announced what coins are affected yet. I‚Äôm sure they have/will be contacted

[05-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Andy#1801
I was talking to ca333. He told me he would take a look at our code, but he wasn't forthcoming with the technical details. I assume he has a lot to do right now which I understand, but it would be nice to get to know the details.

We strongly recommend moving all funds from Agama (KMD, asset chain coins, and other assets) to a new address as soon as possible.

[05-Jun-19 01:06 PM] angrygnat#7242
ok, i put in the binance address

[05-Jun-19 01:08 PM] angrygnat#7242
@gcharang so now i have just to wait? that address was a staff address?

[05-Jun-19 01:09 PM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
or not working for me to verify versus coin address

[05-Jun-19 01:11 PM] gcharang#6833
@angrygnat please wait for more instructions from us on the claim process
but I won't recommend using the binance address as claim address
please change it when we contact you back for confirmation
if there were problems in the txn we send out, then you will have to deal with us and binance support team
just create a new seed in verus agama and you should be fine

[05-Jun-19 01:11 PM] gcharang#6833
@WorldOfCryptos are you sending verus coin?

[05-Jun-19 01:13 PM] angrygnat#7242
i'm sorry: what is verus agama? the agama wallet?i have to create a neew wallet?

[05-Jun-19 01:13 PM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
