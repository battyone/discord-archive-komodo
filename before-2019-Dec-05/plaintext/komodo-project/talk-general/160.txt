Thanks for this convo. Just saved my fears of privacy coins.

[18-Dec-18 12:39 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
BarterDEX may have a little issue with it, when trading against PoW chains ,  but it would have to be with a pair of nondpowed chains

[18-Dec-18 12:39 AM] haha#6652
Do you know if it's illegal to 51% attack a coin?

[18-Dec-18 12:39 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It's a gray area

[18-Dec-18 01:19 AM] haha#6652
Technically on a private chain you can never be sure the coins you are receiving are fake or not

[18-Dec-18 01:20 AM] haha#6652
For big transactions that's a down side.

[18-Dec-18 01:43 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Same can be said of a public chain

Hey guys, I have had a private pool for about a month, it is doing good. I had some problems but I believe they are all worked out. It is just a basic S-NOMP pool, still the included pages from the download. I am looking for some  asic miners to come and try it out, give it a good testing. Today just concentrating on KMD and looking for some of you to jump on and load it with hashing power. 1% fee to  cover the server and you get everything else you earn. I provide all testers with my contact info including text number if you need to contact me while you are testing. Plus i will be monitoring my PM on the discord. Please come and help me test and let's make some coin,  I have not gotten a URL yet so still using ip address+port for main page. There you will get the coins and ports for mining. Please behave yourself I will ban all IP's immeadiately attempting to poke around where you don't belong. PM me for details,  Thanks David
