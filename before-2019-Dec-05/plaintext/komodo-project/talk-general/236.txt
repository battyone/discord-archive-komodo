@Magnum Wallet not sure why you are spamming this channel with your segwit wallet, when KMD nor ZEC nor any Zcash source code fork has segwit

[20-Mar-19 03:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
and we are glad because of it

I was expecting to click that medium link to find an article that simply says "It doesn't."

Is there a "total supply" API for KMD? Trying to update the CMC page

[20-Mar-19 05:53 PM] Alright#0419
@Regnar no, don't believe there is. You can really only give estimates due to rewards

[20-Mar-19 05:54 PM] Alright#0419
"total supply" or "total circulating supply"?

[20-Mar-19 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
there is coinsupply rpc call

[20-Mar-19 05:54 PM] Regnar#6164
I found circulating supply here: <http://api1.barterdexapi.net/supply.php?coin=KMD>

[20-Mar-19 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
and pretty sure dexstats.info would have some endpoint for this

[20-Mar-19 05:54 PM] Regnar#6164
but not sure where I can point CMC to show what total supply is.

[20-Mar-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
total supply just estimate at 200 million

[20-Mar-19 05:56 PM] Regnar#6164
They may just take official documentation stating what it is, or even estimates

[20-Mar-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i think with the monthly rewards, it will end up closer to 180 million

[20-Mar-19 05:57 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay. I think I can just point them to the white paper, I found a 200M estimate there, what's 20M KMD among friends 😛

[20-Mar-19 06:01 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay I just submitted the max supply request to CMC

So to clarify for my own understanding. Success of future coins like RFOX on the KMD network is huge because it makes the KMD network more and more valuable. Do I understand that correctly?

@Mr.Cryptodude We disabled zk-SNARKs on KMD. Later this year, we will have a KMD sidechain that has zk-SNARKs.

[21-Mar-19 02:03 AM] Alright#0419
Added benefit of sidechaining it is that in the event of another zk-SNARKs coin printing bug, only the coins on the sidechain would be affected. It won't be able to affect the main chain.

[21-Mar-19 02:03 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Okay so its better?

[21-Mar-19 02:04 AM] Alright#0419
it has both pros and cons, but it has added functionality and safety

[21-Mar-19 02:04 AM] Alright#0419
For example, you won't be able to claim rewards on this side chain. You will be able to use zkSNARKs and cryptoconditions though

[21-Mar-19 02:04 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Ah okay

[21-Mar-19 02:18 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Would like to see what JL777 Said about this

[21-Mar-19 03:44 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I think JL would somehow make the exact points @Alright did but in fewer words and even easier to understand than Alright just put it.

[21-Mar-19 03:44 AM] FishyGuts#5085
That man has a serious way with words.    Alright is a very smart dev who knows him and the KMD ecosystem well.   I wouldn't be surprised if Alright was speaking on behalf of the whole team 😃

KMD mainchain without privacy is exciting instead of negative news.
It's already done in last fork/update happened few months ago.
The impact of this change will be amazing on KMD ecosystem.

[21-Mar-19 11:22 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Ah okay thanks for clarifying things guys

I found a project that I haven't heard before, it seems built on a Komodo assetchain because their wallet is a link to Agama: https://www.patenttx.com/
unfortunately the link is to v0.3.1e of Agama that is outdated

[21-Mar-19 03:05 PM] PTYX#6840
A fark maybe?

the guy was in #kmdlabs a while ago

[21-Mar-19 03:07 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Komodo is found on links in whitepaper, the coin is 50%Pow/50%Pos

[21-Mar-19 03:07 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
probably not using dPoW or we would have heard about it

@hypocalese is the one to ask iirc

[21-Mar-19 03:10 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I was curious, I suppose there are other blockchains built w Komodo tech but that we haven't heard much about

[21-Mar-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no way to know just how many there are

[21-Mar-19 03:37 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
"As of the writing of this paper, Bitcoin has the strongest mining presence and provides the best security to digitally notarize
each transaction. The digital notarization is provided by Komodo’s platform and their notary nodes. PTX blocks are periodically
notarized against blocks from the KMD blockchain, KMD blocks are notarized against Bitcoin blockchain. This provides a triple
measure of security as a hacker or bad actor would have to compromise Bitcoin, Komodo and PTX coin to be successful. The
proposed solution allows inventors to safely store, access, and digitally sign their inventions. Our PTX coin is used to digitally
sign the submitted patent and notarize with Bitcoin blockchain. "
