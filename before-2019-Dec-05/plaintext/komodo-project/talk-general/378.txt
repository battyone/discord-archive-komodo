`you are a totally dishonest community believe me`
as compared to the "journalist" who writes some inaccurate, flawed "article" and deletes any comments that point out those inaccuracies?

I lost a lot of Hush on Cryptopia

[25-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Berg#2666
I had just bought roughly 9K before they closed trading...

[25-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Robert Garcia#4595
coz you don't care about anybody losses, the community blame Topia,, go see the stuck wallet in Tradesatoshi

[25-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Berg#2666
If my team orchestrated this, we sure did a bad job

[25-Jun-19 05:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`coz you don't care about anybody losses,`
caring and accepting how/why those losses occurred and the risk involved in giving away ownership are different issues

[25-Jun-19 05:46 PM] Berg#2666
Yes, I should've moved my funds sooner, but unfortunately I work for a living and wasn't able to do so before they went belly up

[25-Jun-19 05:46 PM] Berg#2666
I will take blame for my own personal losses

[25-Jun-19 05:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
we all *care* that other users (including ourselves) lose on bad exchanges
that was never your claim
Your issue was that they were staking shit you gave them and not giving you some profit that you didn't earn

[25-Jun-19 05:46 PM] Berg#2666
But my team did nothing to lose user funds, the exchange had a security breach

[25-Jun-19 05:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when you deposit on an exchange
`coins belong to you and exchange has nothing`
changes to
`coins belong to the exchange and you have nothing but a promise`

[25-Jun-19 05:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that is a literal fact

[25-Jun-19 05:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
does it suck for all depositors when the exchange fails on their promise?
**YES!!** 100% of the time that sucks
Do they *own you* (above and beyond your ledger balance) for what they did with their coins that you willingly gave them?
No! Not now, not ever (unless they explicitly state so in your User Agreement).

@Robert Garcia Trade Satoshi was sent our upgrade months ago. They are completely hopeless as far as tech goes. There are also lots of rumours floating around that TS may go the way of Cryptopia. We have given them step by step instructions to upgrade. It is up to them to apply it. We have nothing to do with their incompetance. There is only so much we can do on our end. I gave you warning not to be rude in our discord yet you continue. Take your drama elsewhere

[25-Jun-19 06:08 PM] RunningMantheCoin#7435
And as mentinoed above..not your keys, not your coins.

Some jackwagon is mad because supposedly tradesatoshi stakes the PoS coins that tradesatoshi owns

Oh. This the guy that lost 10k hush on crytopia?

[25-Jun-19 07:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no clue, this was all about an article about ts staking 1337 coin (market value of $0.000033 USD per)  for 1.337% annually and not giving that 1.337% to depositors

[25-Jun-19 07:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
literally less than $12,000 USD per year if ts held **every** coin in existance
