Did anyone use http://cryptocapital.co?

[28-May-18 02:10 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Some people say they are sketchy as hell

[28-May-18 02:10 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Dunno what i should believe lol

[28-May-18 02:11 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
I get they are sort of licensed and might have hard time wiring some sketchy funds around.

So i guess bitfinex and cex are involved in building cryptocapital?

[28-May-18 03:04 PM] ptytrader#0000
I don't know if they are involved in building it, but they are using it

[28-May-18 03:05 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Well i think thats good enough

[28-May-18 03:05 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Lol

[28-May-18 03:06 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
I dont see a lot of options after 2 days of researching imo

[28-May-18 03:06 PM] ptytrader#0000
What's funny is that cryptocapital doesn't send to Panama anymore

[28-May-18 03:06 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Wut?

[28-May-18 03:06 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Then where

[28-May-18 03:07 PM] ptytrader#0000
And most likely alot of central American companies. From my own research I found out they are using a series of shell companies and European banks

[28-May-18 03:07 PM] ptytrader#0000
In Portugal and Lithuania

[28-May-18 03:07 PM] ptytrader#0000
That would explain the Panamanian ban

[28-May-18 03:08 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
So i am guessing they fucked something up in panama and moved to EU

[28-May-18 03:08 PM] ptytrader#0000
They don't like sending to "offshore" jurisdictions. The irony is that Panama has passed a ban on offshore companies opening bank accounts. If you want a Panam√° bank account you now need to be physically there and operating there

[28-May-18 03:08 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Oh so there is no merit on panama anymore?

[28-May-18 03:08 PM] ptytrader#0000
It's just a big game the banks are playing. Pass the money through where they want you to pass it by and everything is good

[28-May-18 03:09 PM] ptytrader#0000
Panama is good for Icos or companies looking for 0% tax on offshore business

[28-May-18 03:09 PM] ptytrader#0000
So if you open a company in Panama but don't offer services inside Panama you don't need to pay taxes by law

[28-May-18 03:10 PM] ptytrader#0000
As the banking is cleaned up I assume it will gain favor with European banks again. Also there is a fintech boom happening in Central and South America. Tons of payment processors and services the likes of Venmo or PayPal are cropping up

[28-May-18 03:10 PM] ptytrader#0000
Panama is trying to position itself for the fintech and crypto economy.

[28-May-18 03:11 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Can you recommend me some fiat to crypto gateway?

[28-May-18 03:11 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Like cryptocapital

[28-May-18 03:11 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
I need it for moving money around in and out of singapore bank

[28-May-18 03:12 PM] ptytrader#0000
Honestly no. I don't know a reliable one. Cryptocapital might be great for Singapore

[28-May-18 03:12 PM] ptytrader#0000
I never had an issue with cryptocapital

[28-May-18 03:12 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
I see

[28-May-18 03:12 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
What is your volume?

[28-May-18 03:12 PM] ptytrader#0000
I just stopped using them due to the news but nothing happened after it was published

[28-May-18 03:12 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
5 figure?

I need to move 6 to 7 figure

I wouldn't trust them that

[28-May-18 03:13 PM] ptytrader#0000
You don't have any local contacts?

But there is no option lol

Localethereum

[28-May-18 03:14 PM] ptytrader#0000
You might be better off traveling and doing a face to face deal. In Singapore people won't rob you

[28-May-18 03:14 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
I mean not a lot of people can handle that volume

[28-May-18 03:14 PM] ptytrader#0000
I mean they will but then they'll get their hands chopped off
