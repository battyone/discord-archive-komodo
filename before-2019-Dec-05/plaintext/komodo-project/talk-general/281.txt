VBK allocated $4 mil for consultants and advisors, so it seems this is the type of stuff they paid for

[26-Apr-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the real knowledgeable devs like miketout build on komodo to make some really amazing things

[26-Apr-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
miketout got the pbaas release out, and it has a lot more than i had thought it would. It seems to totally outdo bancor! among many other things: https://twitter.com/VerusCoin/status/1121279055414738945

I think he meant Veriblock

[26-Apr-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
no wonder, trading at the whale OTC price of 5 cents, if the standard bail out while you can logic holds... we havent seen the end of the VBK selloff yet, and the daily 10BTC of hard costs in addition to normal hashrate costs... as long as volumes are over 100BTC it shouldnt be that big of a problem

[26-Apr-19 01:31 PM] LocoMB#8593
yeah, Veriblock, sry .. IOTA does not want price discussions in their discord too, but they have good reasons for that, _and_ there is  whole discord dedicated to nothing but speculation  on IOTA price

For anyone who is running or wants to run a WooCommerce store, I've added Komodo support to VerusPay and the new release (v0.3.1) is now available! This is a very different kind of payment gateway, it is "self-sovereign" which means you own the gateway, there is no third party, you host your own wallet(s) and your store becomes a full native node! (or your wallet server does, which is the recommended setup).

If you'd like to check it out and setup a store or try it on your existing store, you can follow the setup guide here: https://veruspay.io/setup

Supported coins so far: Verus, Pirate, Komodo

[26-Apr-19 02:03 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
More coming soooonnnnn - I think this is the first payment "gateway" of its kind, it's essentially a blockchain-integrated tool allowing you to have full ownership over the entire process.  Source code can be accessed at https://github.com/veruscoin/veruspay and the plugin is in the WordPress library (but you'll want to follow the setup guide above to install).

1st private yes, 100%.
This dev make the source code for Komodos standalone plugin that Pirate had made as a thank you gift to them back in December and he forked it from one we did in May which was forked from someone else which.... you get the idea 😛

A new vulnerability fundamentally breaks zerocoin security. Watch out for any zerocoin related announcements in the next few days. Don't trade OTC. PIVX, VEIL, ZCOIN and many more projects affected. It's estimated that this can't be fixed.

"Alright, but trading has nothing to do with it, possibly it's dangerous in Veil's case, but not PIVX, since zPIV is being disabled for weeks already, much prior to vulnerability being discovered."

[27-Apr-19 10:29 AM] LocoMB#8593
PIVX used to be shooting star of 2016... lucky those who bailed, but prly most didnt

[27-Apr-19 11:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So pivx does not have anon capabilities atm? Kind of weird for a privacy coin then :p

[27-Apr-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
just use PIRATE!

[27-Apr-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
optional privacy is no privacy at all: https://cryptolux.org/images/d/d9/Zcash.pdf

[27-Apr-19 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is trading at about 5% KMD price, so one years rewards and you can have 1:1 PIRATE for all your KMD. it seems a very good way to diversify

[27-Apr-19 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
against sophisticated attacker, the only way is a 100% private chain using zero knowledge, like PIRATE. actually I dont know of any other at all

[27-Apr-19 11:37 AM] Blackbeard#9921
Exactly my thoughts @jl777c

[27-Apr-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
miners have been kind enough to sell at small premiums over mining cost and so it is like a 9 month long chance to get good prices

[27-Apr-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
halfing is in about a month

[27-Apr-19 11:39 AM] Markus#5464
problem with Pirate is its too difficult to get a decent position unless u wanna pump the price significantly

[27-Apr-19 11:40 AM] Markus#5464
too low liquidity

[27-Apr-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
10 to 20 BTC per day is too low for you??

[27-Apr-19 11:40 AM] Markus#5464
lets say u have 10 btc and u wanna get in on pirate thats not gonna happen

[27-Apr-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
just put in a bid at close to the mining cost, it will get dumped into

[27-Apr-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
I can almost guarantee that a 10BTC bid would get filled within a day or two if it is priced near mining costs

[27-Apr-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
Renting: 30.0 MSol/s
Nicehash rate: 0.0199 per 1 MSol/s 
Rental cost: 0.597 BTC or 3119.12 KMD 
Current net hash: 147.08 MSol/s 
Block reward: 256 ARRR / block 
Blocks to expect per day: 243.9575
Coins to expect per day: 62453.12000000 ARRR 
Per coin cost BTC: 0.00000956 BTC 
Per coin cost KMD: 0.04994342 KMD

[27-Apr-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so with a bid of 950 sats or 0.05 KMD, 10 BTC worth in a day or two. it is quite amazing

[27-Apr-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
digitalprice is where all the volume is

[27-Apr-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it almost seems like the miners use some automatic dumping script as i see sells 10% below the most recent buys

[27-Apr-19 11:44 AM] Markus#5464
why would ppl sell it below mining cost then?

[27-Apr-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
rental cost is a bit more than mining costs if you are in low electric cost areas. my guess is a lot of miners in china using the 1 cent per kilowatt cost

[27-Apr-19 11:45 AM] Markus#5464
hm k

[27-Apr-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so the really efficient miners seem happy to sell at rental mining costs as they have an even lower cost

[27-Apr-19 11:45 AM] Markus#5464
ye true make sense

[27-Apr-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
after halving, not sure what will happen

[27-Apr-19 11:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
there will be half the arrr available to buy :troll_thuglife:

[27-Apr-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
but what will the hashrate be? and will they continue to sell at close to cost?

[27-Apr-19 11:57 AM] mrlynch#5735
not long until we find out

[27-Apr-19 11:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362

@Markus you could definitely find 2-3 OTC sellers to fulfill that 10BTC order

nice paper to read https://www.bubifans.com/ueditor/php/upload/file/20181016/1539671821227021.pdf

[27-Apr-19 09:12 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
The most prominent player right now is Komodo with their Delayed Proof of Work (DPoW).

The system is an atypical Delegated Proof of Stake implementation with 64 notary nodes. The nodes do not need to hold any KMD, however they get voted once a year into “notarizing” by KMD holders. The node owners are rewarded by block rewards from KMD inflation. Much more info here.

The nodes write the newest block headers from KMD into the Bitcoin blockchain. This way, KMD always has a fallback to the state of its chain in case of an attack, inside the BTC blockchain.

[27-Apr-19 09:12 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Delegated Proof of Stake is a system which brings a fair amount of politics and centralization into the blockchain governance. It is fairly controversial due to holder concentration and the implications on the policies voted into existence. This is especially concerning considering the start of KMD as a Bitcoin Dark (BTCD) ICO, which was afterwards exit pumped.

Any coin that wishes to be protected by KMD’s DPoW has to request this from the KMD team. It is a permissioned product. The implementation fee is paid to the KMD developers. This is a centralized process. The users of KMD blockchain nor notary nodes have no say in which coins are protected by DPoW.

[27-Apr-19 09:12 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
The coins that are protected by DPoW save their block headers using the OP_RETURN command onto the KMD blockchain, similar to the Veriblock solution.

The chains which currently protect themselves using KMD’s DPoW are GAME, EMC2, GIN and other smaller networks.

To successfully attack a blockchain protected by DPoW, the attacker would also have to revert blocks also on the Bitcoin blockchain on top of the attacked altcoin chain, which is unfeasible. The solution in theory prevents all types of 51% attacks that have been explored so far.

[27-Apr-19 09:12 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
DPoW is therefore currently the best available product for projects with minor hashpower or chain security fears. Main concerns come with the underlying assets history (KMD) and the permissioned implementation.
