8 candidates will be elected in each region. So if one candidate is bumped in 9th position at the last minute he won't be elected!

Just can answer : Fell in love with that stuff, and progressively disengaged from classic job, and the current eu node having the contract to redistribute 30% ad vitam(as long as I can be reelected), if I want to have a chance to make Barterlly a success, and be on it 100%, I just prefered to try to candidate instead of asking for funds, or do an ICO ^^. (Even if donators helped me a LOT, I'm dealing with a company now)
