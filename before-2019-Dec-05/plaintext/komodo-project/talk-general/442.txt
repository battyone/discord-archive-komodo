that also depends on how it's utilized, I'm sure that many CryptoBridge users would disagree with your assessment of how good it is

[30-Oct-19 05:09 PM] Flint#6435
just against the backdrop of the above shit, atomicDEX looks like a superman in the world of exchange, but the conditional “batman” Bitshares who have been on the market for a long time and who have not always mentioned him in the Chinese ranking among the leaders! Although I do not like the dead liquidity of BTS, it is a working product and has been working for a long time without failures! this is a rhetorical question not to JL777 but to an article taken not from a student of a copywriter but from the official site and this has the right to discussion without sarcasm

[30-Oct-19 05:09 PM] Flint#6435
And I didnt give a rating of “good” - you interpret it incorrectly - I just pointed out that if those exchanges are listed, then without BTS it seems biased - this is how to throw words out of a song

[30-Oct-19 05:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`atomicDEX looks like a superman in the world of exchange`
because it is

[30-Oct-19 05:17 PM] Flint#6435
it is undeniable! but are we talking about objective comparison? or compare with the weakest?

[30-Oct-19 05:20 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Thanks for the suggestion @Flint , we can def take a look at adding them in

[30-Oct-19 05:21 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We couldve added others-- Binance DEX, for example, but really stopped for the sake of brevity

[30-Oct-19 05:21 PM] Daniel CP#2020
The article is super long as is

[30-Oct-19 05:22 PM] Daniel CP#2020
But with that said, we can always add to it and improve it

[30-Oct-19 05:22 PM] Flint#6435
in healthy and fair competition the best products are born, therefore the fact of objectivity in everything is important

[30-Oct-19 05:24 PM] Flint#6435
@Daniel CP  All the same, atomicDEX would have remained in the win since BTS cannot solve the issue of liquidity and gateways for a year and their smart assets did not save the exchange

[30-Oct-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
what about NXT AE, it was the first before bitshares

[30-Oct-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but it uses proxies that are invariable centralized, so i dont consider it a true DEX

[30-Oct-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the gateway holds the real coins, not you. so how can that be a decentralized exchange?

[30-Oct-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
on the technicality that the trades of the proxy tokens are decentralized, they try to call themselves a DEX

{Reactions}
👌 

[30-Oct-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
at least with the ETH based DEX, they are swapping the actual tokens and are much more a DEX than NXT or bitshares

[30-Oct-19 06:16 PM] Artist#0765
Guys can I only swap in that specific time period for stress test

[30-Oct-19 06:17 PM] Artist#0765
And if you want to check I did some reviews of dex as well but only usage and stuff

the stress test is not only for mobile?

[30-Oct-19 09:20 PM] Oszy#5734
CG, no point spamming from bash, i tested yesterday, makes a lot of failed swaps, better do it the normal way 😄

[30-Oct-19 09:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`makes a lot of failed swaps`
then you're doing it wrong or artem broke it badly 😛

[30-Oct-19 09:21 PM] dan.#2473
what if you go in and change params- worked with mm1

[30-Oct-19 09:21 PM] Oszy#5734
well, Shossain, it stresses the same electrums and the seed node, so i guess cli is okay too.

[30-Oct-19 09:21 PM] dan.#2473
just need to find the code

[30-Oct-19 09:21 PM] Oszy#5734

F10 might not work after you change anything. make sure to use mouse click on Save and Quit normally

[30-Oct-19 09:30 PM] SHossain#0007
otherwise, customized parts wouldn't be saved

[30-Oct-19 09:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I use ssh and tmux, f10 is flaky anyway

[30-Oct-19 09:31 PM] Oszy#5734
I always click, `screen` doesn't like F buttons 😄

[30-Oct-19 09:31 PM] SHossain#0007
even normal terminal on ubuntu desktop/laptop doesn't like F10 key

[30-Oct-19 10:02 PM] Oszy#5734
and how many block you get staking 880K? i think i have tried with 100k before with not much luck

[30-Oct-19 10:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I had a decent amount before the chain swap

[30-Oct-19 10:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and how many block you get staking 880K?`
I'd be lying if I told you that I even keep track
My hope is that someday it'll be a used currency and then 🏖

[30-Oct-19 10:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
----------
the total amount you stake with sometimes matters far less than the size and number of UTXOs

[30-Oct-19 10:05 PM] Oszy#5734
true, just wanted to know if there's any chance staking a block a day with 100k considering how much is out there

[30-Oct-19 10:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if there's any chance staking a block a day`
1440 chances 😛

[30-Oct-19 10:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
granted the UTXO was from July, but I just staked a block that was a flat 72

[30-Oct-19 10:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and a couple more from Aug
