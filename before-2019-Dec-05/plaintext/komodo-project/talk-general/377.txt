I was just wondering about something...I know there are DEX exchanges like Barterdex, Zaddex and Tortuga coming. But I think they are all using systems where a buyer needs to go to a seller directly.
But does the Komodo ecosystem have something like Ethereum has with Uniswap?
I think it's super cool that they have "pools" and anybody can create one with an ERC20 token and even earn interest.
Would be great to have something like this for all blockchains created on Komodo.
Here's the Uniswap website:

OK thanks for explaining.
What I like about Uniswap is that it works as smoothly as a centralised exchange (when you select the "market price" for example on Binance etc)... you just place an order and swap.
I also read (but not sure if that's true or not) that it's good for privacy as funds go into a pool.

[24-Jun-19 07:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@D2D privacyalternatives.com with AtomicDEX if a buyer won't find a seller, it will create a market order, which any other buyer can see in the orders list and fill that if they see and agree it on decentralised orderbook.

[24-Jun-19 07:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Barterlly is an Escrow system, which can be compared with shapeshift.io or changelly.com
It is the only one of it's own kind to my knowledge providing Escrow Service without risk.

[24-Jun-19 07:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Barterlly and Tortuga are same backend, which plans to upgrade/change it's backend to use BarterDEX protocol eventually.

At least Shapeshift are transparent and require KYC upfront.
I don't like Changelly and also Change Now as I read many times that they often freeze transactions even for small amounts

[24-Jun-19 07:31 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
@grewalsatinder AtomicDEX is the name of the technology, or the name of an actual exchange created on Komodo?

Changelly's backend is linked to centralised exchanges from where the coin is swapped and provided to the one using their service in exchange to the cryptocurrency they are swapping for.
Barterlly is using both ends of swapping cryptocurrencies from users alone, and so far with 0 fee.

[24-Jun-19 07:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have used Changelly, and so far they been reliable to me, without requiring KYC.

[24-Jun-19 07:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Shapeshift don't even let me do anything without KYC after login. I hatted it ever since they moved to KYC mandatory.

[24-Jun-19 07:40 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
But I think it's more honest the way Shapeshift do it, at least it's upfront.
Much worse when they let users upload coins, then freeze the transactions...how can they call themselves "non-custodial"

[24-Jun-19 07:42 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667

Is it allowed to create a separate pool of liquidity for one assetchain or coin ?

[24-Jun-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a decentralized system. anybody can create orders

[24-Jun-19 08:35 PM] phm87#7395
yes of course but I remember a recent market crash due to short selling position. I think that you wanted to split liquidity pools (on house side) to minimize such a risk

[24-Jun-19 08:36 PM] phm87#7395
In my case, it is a special usecase where I control both buyers and sellers. i'd like to have an isolated liquidity pool to forbid other buyers/sellers to match my orders

[24-Jun-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
that was prices CC, nothing to do with atomicDEX

[24-Jun-19 08:36 PM] phm87#7395

Plus they have KMD on the list : ) Not sure why but on Coinswitch they don't offer KMD anymore

[24-Jun-19 10:47 PM] PTYX#6840
yeah it's probably just due to the withdrawals being stopped from binance and bitttrex

[24-Jun-19 10:48 PM] PTYX#6840
coinswitch and swap sites often use those exchanges to buy and sell

[24-Jun-19 10:48 PM] PTYX#6840

The liquid reserves being built by Verus are going to replicate the Bancor exchange protocol, which will allow users to buy and sell assets without having to match orders. It will follow a pricing formula. In some ways this could be considered a dex, since it will all be done from a wallet on the blockchain and if I understand it correctly you would have custody until the exchange takes place. @D2D privacyalternatives.com

[25-Jun-19 01:58 AM] stupidfish#4113
is Smart Chains the name of Antara chains or the general name of all chains built on Antara?

[25-Jun-19 04:08 AM] CyberTrucker#5260
Mike Toutonghi of Verus on the liquid reserves: "All the Komodo interoperability we have now should remain, and all PBaaS chains will be able to get notarized independently and interoperate with Komodo/Barterdex and all the chains that they do. The Verus reserve and liquidity protocol will actually enable any PBaaS chain that is a fractional reserve to exchange to and from Verus on the PBaaS chain itself, which will enable us to solve the front running problem inherent in decentralized trading. Each PBaaS fractional reserve chain will know its value relative to Verus, based on the same kind of pricing formula as you can see in the Bancor whitepaper, slightly modified for mineable / stakeable chains. If you want to buy any fractional reserve currency in the Verus ecosystem, you will move some Verus to that chain, and you would buy it on the chain, with no need for a counterparty, meaning you would be able to sell without a buyer and buy without a seller. If you want to sell, you would sell it on the chain and then optionally move Verus back to the Verus chain. The chain's rules, miners, and stakers control the chain's reserves, which are increased when people buy and decreased when people sell. There are other ways to increase and decrease as well. "
