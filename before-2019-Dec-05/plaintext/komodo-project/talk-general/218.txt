[27-Feb-19 08:46 AM] badscrypto#1848
does the mobile version does the same

[27-Feb-19 08:46 AM] badscrypto#1848
?

[27-Feb-19 08:47 AM] Jurjen#9294
@badscrypto is it already clear the app is doing this or the client spellcheck?

[27-Feb-19 08:47 AM] badscrypto#1848
I mean the coinomi mobile wallet is doing the spellcheck also

[27-Feb-19 08:47 AM] Jurjen#9294
If it is the client all wallets with plain text field have the same issue

[27-Feb-19 08:49 AM] badscrypto#1848
OMG i am using it on both.

[27-Feb-19 08:49 AM] badscrypto#1848
anyone know a replacement for it?

that's what I heard from coinomi team

[27-Feb-19 08:53 AM] Nagato Ê≥ï#7244
I guess it's fixed now, but the problem luke reported is still unresolved i guess

[27-Feb-19 08:55 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
coinomi wallet should let users know about this and ask them to generate new wallet if that's the case as a precaution, but so far , no news.

[27-Feb-19 08:56 AM] Tek#5253
if thats what the coinonmie wallet does, I'll never get it

I daily see so many possible security vulnerables, even in password managers. As mostly suggested, use a webwallet / app only for small amount of money. And for the bigger amounts create a key at an offline device and store it safely

[27-Feb-19 09:02 AM] badscrypto#1848

just in case anyone isnt aware - `using the same seed / passphrase in Agama as you used in Coinami means your funds are still at risk!`
Create new addresses from a new passphrase.

[27-Feb-19 09:32 AM] badscrypto#1848
yes thats right will transfer not import the seed

[27-Feb-19 09:34 AM] badscrypto#1848
i have a passphrase for KMD can I use the same for the others coins too?

[27-Feb-19 09:43 AM] bishop#9773
Yes

[27-Feb-19 09:44 AM] bishop#9773
add your coins and you will see the appropriate address for that passphrase

[27-Feb-19 09:44 AM] bishop#9773
asset chains share the same KMD address too

Apparently on the Coinomi deal:  This only was true for desktops only at restore, and it was encrypted with ssl before it hits google apis. Latest desktop exe on the site removed it.

[27-Feb-19 12:08 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
given their history with responding poorly to being told of security issues, I'd avoid using Coinami. Seems the attack surface on the latest issue implies insider involvement. Couple that with them not being open source anymore, seems safer to not trust them

[27-Feb-19 12:12 PM] Regnar#6164
They've been deleting people's messages from telegram that were bringing up this issue/question. Stating that they will be releasing an official statement soon and that "it is not a vulnerability and you will read why in the statement"
"ssl encrypted due to jxbrowser, but 'invalid' request that never was processed by google anyway. the spellcheck is local. please wait for the full official statement that will answer all your questions and again, this was only valid for desktop clients, and only when you restored seed."
Still looks like a terrible idea...

[27-Feb-19 12:23 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
how many people have to report loss of funds by using Coinomi around the same dates as this before they admit culpability?
events like this being responded to like this reminds me of `Bill Coinomisby`

"The spell-check requests that were sent over to Google API were not processed, cached or stored and the requests themselves returned an error (code: 400) as they were flagged as ‚ÄúBad Request‚Äù¬π and weren‚Äôt processed further by Google¬≤" 

That first footnote is a screenshot of the results NOW... I'd like to know if this had in fact been an active API request BEFORE, and at what point it started returning 400 codes? 
The 2nd footnote they cited saying they "weren't process further by Google" is NOT actually sourced, that is their current assumption with no verification from Google. The footnote reads "¬≤ We have asked Google to confirm that bad requests‚Äô text body isn‚Äôt stored on their servers, we will update our statement accordingly."
So they don't actually know if Google logs failed API request information...

Messy

[27-Feb-19 06:07 PM] Regnar#6164
I guess it would be good to use the older version (if someone has it) to check to see if it returns a 400 or 200, and if the App actually performs a spell check on a misspelling?

[27-Feb-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
even if it returns error now and always did, sending privkeys to a server (any server) is not what people are expecting from a local wallet. imagine if they were sending the privkeys to their own server, what is the reaction

[27-Feb-19 06:10 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm definitely in the "That's a bad idea" camp. I'm wondering about their response to the whole thing basically saying it isn't a big deal because it returned 400 codes and Google didn't log these, when we and they don't know if either of those are actually true.

[27-Feb-19 06:13 PM] Regnar#6164
They seem to be saying that the app has always returned 400 codes and Google doesn't log these requests, so no one's keys have ever been at risk, trying to remove any liability they may face for bad key management practice, or what might be considered negligence (I'm not a lawyer, I don't know how that would work).

[27-Feb-19 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
if they have the usual software license, odds are they are not liable at all
