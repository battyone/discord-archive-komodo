@hastrup I liked very much all your suggestions, some are not even on the market yet! (like that PineBook laptop coming out this month) and some are in alpha/beta 👍🏻  I've added them all, you can easily find them because they have the label "New"

[12-Jul-19 12:30 PM] hastrup#8742
I'm getting 3 of them laptops XD ahah thx you work fast :) and great project pm me if you need any help :)

[12-Jul-19 12:37 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
3 of them! Their price is great at $199 and they even have a "privacy switch", a bit similar to the Purism ones. 
OK I'll let you know if I need any help, thanks again : )

[12-Jul-19 12:40 PM] hastrup#8742
My mom, girlfriend and me will get one :) I have some tutorials you maybe could use at some point :)

[12-Jul-19 12:42 PM] hastrup#8742

Hey! How easy it is to integrate a chat option into peer to peer exchange?

[12-Jul-19 03:14 PM] nikita#5134
Having a market without possibility to communicate feels weird

[12-Jul-19 03:44 PM] Markus#5464
why would u want a chat anyway?

[12-Jul-19 03:44 PM] Markus#5464
bitmex is a good answer to why there should not be

[12-Jul-19 03:44 PM] Markus#5464
its a shit show

[12-Jul-19 04:09 PM] nikita#5134
When u set up an atomic order it should match the exact offer of another person to swap, right?
At some point someone might want to negotiate price.

[12-Jul-19 04:13 PM] Malti#3948
that's why liquidity is so important

[12-Jul-19 04:13 PM] Malti#3948
that you find an offer that you want to buy/sell into

[12-Jul-19 04:15 PM] nikita#5134

Hey guys, regarding the rebrand, is komodo still going to be called komodo, or something else?

[13-Jul-19 12:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Komodo will be Komodo, the rebrand is basically telling the wider market we are not a privacy coin, we are much more. @Blake

[13-Jul-19 01:01 AM] Blake#1641
Alright thanks

Has there been an announcement in regards to Hempcoin migrating over to KMD? I'm curious since I haven't seen a mention of it.

[13-Jul-19 09:34 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
When atomicDex beta test ?

[13-Jul-19 09:35 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Also when i click confirm email in the acceptance mail its just directing me to the website with a sign up botton

[13-Jul-19 09:36 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I suppose it's confirmed with that action

[13-Jul-19 09:36 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Or sign up again

[13-Jul-19 09:41 PM] allbits#5898

[14-Jul-19 12:57 AM] LooTz#2749
When creating a chain with komodo's 51% attack protection does that protect a coin initially from pools that have over 51% of the hash power ?

[14-Jul-19 12:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes, it needs more power to attack than 51%, and even then probably fail

[14-Jul-19 01:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Dpowconf doesn't increase confirmations larger than 1 until chain notarize

[14-Jul-19 01:00 AM] LooTz#2749
cool thanks grewal for confirming

[14-Jul-19 01:07 AM] hastrup#8742
Sell all for easy nothing

[14-Jul-19 01:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@grewalsatinder ummm unless they build enough blocks that notarize to KMD right?

[14-Jul-19 01:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So if they could 51% attack  a chain for the minimum number of blocks before it gets written to KMD then that could then be written to BTC.

[14-Jul-19 01:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But every notarization would be a checkpoint and they could roll back

[14-Jul-19 01:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
In any case smart chains should be considered secure to the point they are notarized

[14-Jul-19 01:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It is very much like waiting for 10 min aprox for btc 1 confirmation

[14-Jul-19 01:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If a transaction is 1+ confirmed, it is safe

[14-Jul-19 03:24 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
That is the important part. People need to realise that. If they do what grewalsatinder said, there is no risk. If not, you risk an attack affecting you. 
Also smart chains could pay to have notarisations more often or less often, if they're worried or not. The cost becomes a lot more if its more often though. So I believe most coins do it every 10 blocks

[14-Jul-19 11:41 AM] bogybogy#3962
Hy

[14-Jul-19 11:41 AM] bogybogy#3962
So market take another hit today

[14-Jul-19 11:41 AM] bogybogy#3962
I believe is because of the OTC

[14-Jul-19 11:42 AM] bogybogy#3962
What options we can have to beat this OTC trading

[14-Jul-19 11:42 AM] bogybogy#3962
Moving massive amount of BTC on OTC doesn't help the market
