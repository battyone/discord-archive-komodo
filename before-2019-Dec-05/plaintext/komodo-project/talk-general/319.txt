Is there an actual hacker?

[05-Jun-19 10:31 AM] DLT Novice#2835
That has a list of all seeds used for light login for the last four months

[05-Jun-19 10:32 AM] gcharang#6833
@sopho the funds from the address you posted moved to the address controlled by the team
so you can submit a claim for them as well

[05-Jun-19 10:33 AM] TS#7923
We can't disclose details about the nature of the vulnerabilty yet, but I think it's reasonable to think we wouldn't have done this without a real threat.

[05-Jun-19 10:33 AM] DLT Novice#2835
If the agama wallet in light mode logged in for claim only, every month for the last 6 months, using pin to login, was the seed transferred out

[05-Jun-19 10:33 AM] sopho#0122
thanks  gcharang

[05-Jun-19 10:34 AM] nonapa#2231
hello

[05-Jun-19 10:34 AM] TS#7923
Since it's a vulnerability in an upstream library it might (emphasis on *might*, we do not know, for real) affect other projects too. So we can't disclose details yet.

[05-Jun-19 10:35 AM] nonapa#2231
where can I ask for some help with my kmd in latest agama wallet

[05-Jun-19 10:35 AM] TS#7923
in the #support channel, @nonapa

[05-Jun-19 10:35 AM] DLT Novice#2835
I thought the pin used the seed to unlock the wallet at client side only,  so it seems the seeds were sent out on every login?

[05-Jun-19 10:37 AM] tipmebits#4427
you should summarise what is going on so far and pin it. save some hassle for yourself and people

Im about to send CHIPS to new VRSC Agama wallet address from the web wallet, and it says "WARNING: your wallet data is verified only by a single server!! If you still want to continue, press Confirm".

Is it safe to send funds?

[05-Jun-19 11:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@marlodz kmd devs discovered there was an exploit that a hacker was preparing to use

[05-Jun-19 11:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So they exploited it before someone else could

[05-Jun-19 11:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362

If I'm not mistaken, when moving funds to RSgD2...wJdkbkeF, or elsewhere, a second round is needed to collect the remaining interest

Hi, I just read about the vulnerability you found. Being a wallet developer myself, I'm curious if this vulnerability can affect others, including our wallet. Would it be possible for someone of the team to reach out to me so we can discuss this in private?

[05-Jun-19 11:42 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
seeing that, I think I underestimated my stakers

[05-Jun-19 11:44 AM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
I use agama in native mode. My addresses were generated in native mode. Do I still need to move my funds to be safe?

[05-Jun-19 11:47 AM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
I'm just trying to decide if I do this before or after work. Lol

[05-Jun-19 11:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
native modes are not affected. until you used the WIF from native mode to login into Lite mode

[05-Jun-19 11:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Andy contact @ca333

[05-Jun-19 11:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so if you havent exported/imported your native WIF keys from/into agama you should be fine
