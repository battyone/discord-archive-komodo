im switching off of binance

[07-Sep-19 08:30 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
right now im looking at bittrex or changelly

[07-Sep-19 08:33 PM] actionslacks#4072
I've dealt with bittrex quite a bit in the past. beside govt enforced anal probing. I have no complaints.

[07-Sep-19 08:34 PM] yorklab#7270
I've also had no issues with Bittrex.

[07-Sep-19 08:35 PM] SHossain#0007
if you are NOT in a hurry, put a buy order in AtomicDEX - no KYC, no limit and you hold your privkey

[07-Sep-19 08:37 PM] actionslacks#4072
but where do u put the dollars in? i guess you can buy usdc on coinbase

[07-Sep-19 08:37 PM] actionslacks#4072
havent tried it

[07-Sep-19 08:37 PM] SHossain#0007
opppsss...forgot to mention, you can't buy with USD. BTC or any other supported coin

Buying KMD with BCH is a good option. BCH has many good fiat onramps.  The Bch/kmd pair on Atomicdex is quite deep usually.  BCH transaction fees are very low compared to btc.

[07-Sep-19 08:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Buying KMD with BCH is a good option. `
but then you have to buy BCH 1st 😦

[07-Sep-19 09:20 PM] allbits#5898
It's about the fiat onramps. No denying that they're very good for.BCH

[07-Sep-19 09:34 PM] Privatoshi#7913
I don't know if anyone knows the wallet, O3, for the NEO Network. But, is definitely in the top 3. It has the Switcheo DEX, dAPPS like Travala for hotels and Alchemint to collateralize NEO for a stablecoin, SDS...  They also offer a fiat onramp to NEO, with a debit or credit card. I personally wouldn't use it. But, would it be possible for Komodo to incorporate a way to buy KMD, with a fee obviously, by cc or dc?

[07-Sep-19 09:36 PM] Privatoshi#7913
Or maybe a fiat onramp for USDC

[07-Sep-19 10:12 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

[07-Sep-19 10:30 PM] actionslacks#4072

[08-Sep-19 03:49 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239

You asking once is one thing, but consistently doing it (and then adding my name into the ask) puts you only 1/2 step above a basic street beggar
