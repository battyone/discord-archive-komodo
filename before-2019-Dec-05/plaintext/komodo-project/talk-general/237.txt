Read it enough and the word begins to lose meaning. 

Really fascinating to see that even KMD ecosystem doesn't know what coins are being launched on it.  
That's how you decentralize all the things.!

is it possible to create an option to let the dividends (5.1% of stake) transfer to another address? currently, on claim or a transaction the dividends are credited to the same address the coins are stored.

[21-Mar-19 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
-donation=pubkey will send the claimed amount to the address of that pubkey

Zack is a smart dude.   There is no denying it.   
Seems like a breakdown between scientific discovery to discredit ones claims vs. discorvery to support ones claims.   

The latter being the wrong way to go about it.

[22-Mar-19 06:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Putting external feed on a chain is an oracle,  trustlessness is not necessary

[22-Mar-19 06:41 PM] actionslacks#4072
this discussion may result in onboarding a new dev. seems like that happens quite a bit around here

[22-Mar-19 06:56 PM] MyName#0491
Either way, Komodo wins when FUD dies down and actual conversation happens 🙂

[22-Mar-19 07:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I don't see FUD.   I see brilliant devs in discussion.  Sometimes the discourse doesn't happen as planned but it happens.  
Zack is a smart MFer.   He made Augur and Aeternity and Amoveo is another example of his prowess.   
I just summed my thoughts up in that channel but it will get lost so:
*Thinking to myself:*
TBF - I have always loved VEO since Pondsea introduced me a year ago.
It always made me wonder if KMD multichain architecture could have helped Zack with a lot of things along the way giving him an accelerated development environment.

Having all these Devs as a sounding board but ultimately able to to control the outcome of his own Project.

[22-Mar-19 07:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Someone asked about Oracle projects aon Twitter, and I posted that I like VEO first and that I like KMD and its underrated Oracles.

[22-Mar-19 07:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Now we are here 😛

[22-Mar-19 07:12 PM] MyName#0491
`I don't see FUD.`
Then you missed the 8 times he called it a "scam" and "false advertisement"

[22-Mar-19 07:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Those were mislabellings on his interperetation of a condition.   I have been guilty of this on SEVERAL occassions.

He seems to be more open to discussion now.

[22-Mar-19 07:15 PM] MyName#0491
yes to the latter
I'm not sure I'm liberal enough to go with "mislabellings"

everyone there are scammers impersonating team members with same nick and photo, they pm you asking for money, help or proposing deals. No one will contact you asking for money. You can verify the identity checking the number at the end of the nick (i.e.  jl777c#5810 is the real jl, jl777c#2480 is an impostor)
