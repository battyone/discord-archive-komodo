Super awesome

[04-Dec-18 08:40 PM] barv#0867
Very cool. In Amsterdam I spent some time with Krijn Soeteman while he was writing Cryptocurrencies for Dummies (Dutch version). I pointed him on the right sources of atomic swap history and the active part of the Komodo team on this. Very cool to read this in the book!

Are the pivx spv ztransactions different from zcash's?

[04-Dec-18 09:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Pivx is a dash fork iirc?

[04-Dec-18 09:29 PM] Tac#1954
@Cryptoon at this point the only thing pivx and dash have in common are they both masternodes.

What it the current version of agama

They were a dash fork then went the Zcoin route

[04-Dec-18 09:39 PM] PTYX#6840
Yea, I think they mint coins with zero knowledge proofs

[04-Dec-18 09:40 PM] PTYX#6840
You burn coins and mint new ones that have no transaction history

[04-Dec-18 09:40 PM] PTYX#6840
The burning and issuance happens via zero knowledge proofs. It's something along those lines. But it's still zero knowledge proofs

[04-Dec-18 09:41 PM] PTYX#6840
They claim they did it via spv.... I just thought that could relate to making ztransactions on spv

[04-Dec-18 09:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
PIVX ztransactions are pretty different than Zcash-style zaddrs

amounts are not hidden if i remember right and totally different protocol than zcash

hi all... question...how does KMD benefit from asset chains?

[05-Dec-18 04:03 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
no fees...no gas...

[05-Dec-18 04:07 AM] Torankoku#4818
I believe one must pay fee to be an asset chain no?. so fee is in kmd. so asset chain creators, thinking goes, would hold kmd to pay annual fee, thus driving price up

[05-Dec-18 04:07 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
I just made one...maybe the DPOW involves a fee...just getting to that part

[05-Dec-18 04:08 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
lol...I'll hold KMD anyway

[05-Dec-18 04:09 AM] Captain_Jack#0015

dpow, dex trading, MoMoM, 0confirm swaps.

[05-Dec-18 04:13 AM] Torankoku#4818
personally, reason to hold kmd may actually be simpler than that

[05-Dec-18 04:13 AM] Torankoku#4818
rewards system -- 5.1% annual is quite attractive for users to buy and hold

[05-Dec-18 04:14 AM] Torankoku#4818
future individuals coming into ecosystem may not know or understand merkle roots, atomic swaps, and other stuff

[05-Dec-18 04:15 AM] Torankoku#4818
that is why I think when kmd is able to merge hyperdex with agama for "grandma training", value of kmd becomes quite high, I think

atomic swaps is the only way to solve the proxy token problem

[05-Dec-18 11:22 AM] Flexatron#8809
but that still leaves you with a HFT problem..

[05-Dec-18 11:23 AM] Flexatron#8809
or can you do 1000 atomic swaps per second

[05-Dec-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
you could but the blockchain will bloat very quickly if that is done

[05-Dec-18 03:19 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
problem I see with the game theory of the fees and gas that use tokens...its counter intuitive to increase the price of the the thing in which I pay 'fees' ... using binance coin as an example...the price of the token increases and my fees go up....in this environment I don't want the price of the token to increase and if the price of thing provably increases, I'd be better off saving it than spending it.  This is similar to the daily kmd fee...or gas...or any type of usage based or rental fee.  I'm not complaining about the fee...I'm saying the game theory here seems to be weak...the more the price of kmd goes up the more I pay per day in fees.  It appears to me that this applies to all 'fee' systems that use the same 'store of value' token as the means of fee payment.  With a fixed payment amount for rent, the daily users (those paying rent) have only negative benefit to the 'store of value' increasing in cost or value.  Notice that the mining difficulty changes with market value...but the 'rent' does not.

[05-Dec-18 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why assetchain txfees are not denominated in KMD

[05-Dec-18 03:21 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
ahh...I didn't see that in the dev docs

[05-Dec-18 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
ETH suffers from this to a very large degree, but globally. ie. if a single dapp starts using up a lot of gas, the costs for all users go up

[05-Dec-18 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
independent chains mean independent chains

[05-Dec-18 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
LTC doesnt pay any BTC txfees

[05-Dec-18 03:22 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
I understood the DPoW fee is 365kmd/year?

[05-Dec-18 03:22 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
for asset chain?

[05-Dec-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
and if you do 1000 tx or a million tx, the fee is the same

[05-Dec-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is not an incremental cost, just a fixed cost of maintaining security for a chain

[05-Dec-18 03:23 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
understand

[05-Dec-18 03:26 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
Thats the tx fee...with KMD the only 'rent' from an asset chain is the the DPoW and Komodo dev fee correct?  This ultimately is way lower than these other options...still the game theory will push a behavior of save vs spend as the rent is denominated in kmd

[05-Dec-18 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i think you need to update your game theory

[05-Dec-18 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
if your chain wants to be secure then it pays for dPoW

[05-Dec-18 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
if it doesnt care, then it wont

[05-Dec-18 03:27 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
yes...I think I need to fully updated my understanding of the asset chain costs....

[05-Dec-18 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the game theory and the price of KMD is secondary. its not like you will get multiple dPoW if the KMD price is low and half a dPoW if the price is high

[05-Dec-18 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
other than dPoW, all assetchain costs are denominated in the assetchain coin

[05-Dec-18 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure what is hard to understand about that

[05-Dec-18 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD price can be $1 or $100, the cost for normal assetchain tx is still in assetchain coins and nothing to do with KMD

[05-Dec-18 03:28 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
its like a child learning a new thing...sorry if this is disturbing to you...thanks for responding to my questions

[05-Dec-18 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
now maybe if KMD price goes 100x, it will also raise the price of the assetchain coin...

[05-Dec-18 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
but the assetchain creator has ways to get a percentage of block rewards or even all tx value

[05-Dec-18 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
plus premine, so there are many ways to obtain a sustainable amount of assetchain coins

[05-Dec-18 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
and whether you want dPoW protection is only based on whether you want a secure chain or not, the cost of KMD does not affect the cost per assetchain tx

[05-Dec-18 03:31 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
fully get that...how the game theory affects the DPoW fee is what I was referring to...but you correctly point out that the majority of the 'fees' are tx fees and these are much better on kmd than others as the asset chains are truly independent.

[05-Dec-18 03:32 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
You also point out another benefit..that is the security of DPoW has a cost

[05-Dec-18 03:32 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
but the DPoW cost will increase at a fixed rate as KMD value goes up

[05-Dec-18 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if a project cant afford $300 per year at todays price to secure their chain, it seems they are not serious about providing a secure chain

[05-Dec-18 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
even at 10x the price, it is $3000 per year, not exactly a large expenditure

[05-Dec-18 03:35 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
so DPoW costing is the game theory that seems counterproductive...it is valuable....and the current cost is much less expensive than other methods...its not the value I'm discussing...its the fact that as KMD becomes more valuable that cost will go up considerably?  100xKMD= asset chain DPoW cost 100X...is that a correct understanding?

[05-Dec-18 03:36 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
so if KMD does well, the asset chains will need to discontinue DPoW?

[05-Dec-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
when KMD is $100, the dPoW cost of $30,000 per year might be an issue. in such a case it would be possible to reduce the cost a bit with slower frequency

[05-Dec-18 03:37 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
ok..so my game theory is not 'broken' here?

[05-Dec-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
but with KMD at $100, that means crypto bull market is back

[05-Dec-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
in which case the assetchain coins are worth a lot more

[05-Dec-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
so paying $30,000 wont be much of an issue

[05-Dec-18 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
a long term planning method would be to purchase 6000 KMD at current low prices

[05-Dec-18 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
then for 12 years the notarization fees are covered by the annual reward and another 20 years from the 6000

[05-Dec-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so 30+ years of dPoW for 6000 KMD, just a bit more than $100 per year

[05-Dec-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
in such a scenario KMD at $1000 wont matter

[05-Dec-18 03:40 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
bull market for the winners.  Also this works for me now as I have quite a bit more that that...but for future devs wanting to use the eco system this might not be so easy

[05-Dec-18 03:40 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
I get it...to summarize..this fee is not fixed and can be adjusted as necassary

[05-Dec-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but dPoW cant be free

[05-Dec-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
and not all projects can afford it, but we will have a probono program for deserving projects that dont have funding
