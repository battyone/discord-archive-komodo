@minliangtan @Ripple @KomodoWorld @Omise @DigiByteCoin @orbs_network @OSTdotcom It's @KomodoPlatform Think about it, do you want to be trapped to a chain & their politics, issues, control? or do you want your OWN chain that YOU control, easily scale, secure to BTC with dPo...

[25-Jul-18 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810

KMD looks solid.

@CryptoLex that guy was asked what hes accusations are based on, but he didn't answer. this is of course, because he has no real reason to accuse Komodo. for some reason he just throws baseless accusations

Noon quest here... does having kmd in wallet create blocks?

[25-Jul-18 06:36 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
no, It doesn't create blocks, since KMD is not a staking chain

[25-Jul-18 06:37 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
But gives rewards in kmd

[25-Jul-18 06:37 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yes, 5.1% annualy if you claim every month

[25-Jul-18 06:38 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Put coins in komodo wallet... profit. No other step needed.

Guys please vote for KMDs sister coin HUSH to be listed on https://sonox.io  takes a few seconds and requires no information... HUSH recognition will help KMD grow too! We're only 30 votes from rank 3 which would mean higher visibility for HUSH. Much love xx no homo

So, KMD is a chain supporting a lot of transactions per second, more than Visa (!). PRLPAY is a token on KMD (right?) that is meant to be used in small-shop circumstances. Don't the two compete?

[25-Jul-18 09:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Why would they?

[25-Jul-18 09:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd is a complete ecosystem

[25-Jul-18 09:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Prlpay focuses on microtransactions

[25-Jul-18 09:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd offers the scaling possibilities to its independent assetchains should they require it

[25-Jul-18 09:59 PM] crumb#2550
@Tort do you worry about OmiseGO being a threat to Ethereum?

[25-Jul-18 09:59 PM] crumb#2550
pretty much same comparison

[25-Jul-18 09:59 PM] Tort#9226
No not at all. I am more interested to understand the up and coming projects within KMD

[25-Jul-18 10:00 PM] Tort#9226
we are probably early enough in the game that supporting chains are purely beneficial, not competitive. But, I can't figure out the diff.

[25-Jul-18 10:00 PM] crumb#2550
KMD is about solving big crypto problems, like security, scalability etc.

[25-Jul-18 10:01 PM] crumb#2550
think big

[25-Jul-18 10:01 PM] crumb#2550
have you read Komodo whitepaper?

[25-Jul-18 10:01 PM] crumb#2550
highly recommended

[25-Jul-18 10:22 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
Guys excuse my haste and ignorance but after realising BLOCK ain't something I'm gonna be able to test right now without an all nighter basically

[25-Jul-18 10:22 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
I've moved on straight to BarterDEX and now that I've downloaded it I'm immediately confronted with a form for a "Passphrase", "Net ID", and "Seed Node IP"

[25-Jul-18 10:22 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
I suppose I can guess what those are but have I skipped over some obvious instructions?

[25-Jul-18 10:22 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
Or are newcomers expected to then go and Google these things to find out what the hell they are?

[25-Jul-18 10:24 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
I mean "DOWNLOAD BARTERDEX" is right there on the front page with no indication that there's any significant literature to go through

[25-Jul-18 10:24 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
And yet a quick glance at what I've just downloaded tells me that this one is going to have to wait till tomorrow also

[25-Jul-18 10:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <polycryptoblog:matrix.org> Passphrase is to access your wallet address.  Netid are like channels there are  over 14000 of them.  And seed node is a node that you connect with directly to receive the p2p data.

[25-Jul-18 10:25 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
It says "Goal Now" in the middle of it with separate lines lols what??

[25-Jul-18 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <polycryptoblog:matrix.org> That's if you want to set a portfolio and track it.

[25-Jul-18 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763

Apologies to be one of those annoying dicks but yeah maybe you want to shove a link for that on the homepage or something heh

[25-Jul-18 10:27 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
It's suddenly making a great deal of sense to me why so many traders are flocking to dexsthat can be used within seconds like Bitshares

[25-Jul-18 10:27 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
I'm not saying that's a good thing or anything but yeah it makes a lot of sense now

[25-Jul-18 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <polycryptoblog:matrix.org> Different applications

[25-Jul-18 10:28 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
I'm basically looking to weigh BLOCK and WAVES and KMD against each other

[25-Jul-18 10:28 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
To see which one is really closest to proper decentralisation

[25-Jul-18 10:28 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
But it's difficult when literally all you can find is shill articles

[25-Jul-18 10:28 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
Pros are documented everywhere but cons... Not really

[25-Jul-18 10:29 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
Bitshares's main con obviously being the damn gateways

[25-Jul-18 10:31 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
I'll check this vid but I have a couple of other quick questions if you're still about heh bot that appears to be a human

[25-Jul-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <polycryptoblog:matrix.org> Hyperdex is a 3rd party version that is easier to use.  The cons to atomic swap DEX is confirmation time dependent for completing trade steps.   There is a 0confirm mode but it's experimental.  Soon you will be able to create a waves or bitshares like exchange on a Komodo assetchain.

[25-Jul-18 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <polycryptoblog:matrix.org> Sure ask away

[25-Jul-18 10:32 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
Right yeah heh that's kinda what I expected although I didn't realise the latter was apparently expected to become a reality so soon

[25-Jul-18 10:33 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
When BarterDEX achieves all of its ambitions what will be the remaining drawbacks / tradeoffs versus a centralised exchange by then?

[25-Jul-18 10:33 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
And my other question is whether it's decentralised or **decentralised**

[25-Jul-18 10:34 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
IE is it still a rubber stamp or is it every bit as indestructible as say Bitcoin is already?

[25-Jul-18 10:38 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
BarterDEX operates on a true p2p protocol,  it allows for multi channel trading ,  uses native coins which never leave your control until trade is complete .  Blocknet uses masternodes to do their order books ,  which by definition is a subset of nodes.  Every LP makes orderbooks .  Waves and Bitshares use proxy tokens ,  which means you give up control of your coins .

[25-Jul-18 10:40 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
You have to understand Atomic Swap DEX is not a competitor for centralized exchanges.  It's just for certain types of transactions it is a better tool to use

[25-Jul-18 10:42 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
I know most of the basic fundamentals heh I mean so far what I understand of the dexs with which I'm less familiar is that say BTS and WAVES have decentralisation issues that allows them to compete with centralised exchanges whilst BLOCK and KMD are really only suitable for big trades rather than lunch money but at the same time are properly decentralised on account of that (correct me if I have any of that arse about face of course)

[25-Jul-18 10:42 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Bts and waves can't compete with centralized exchanges,  that's just hype

[25-Jul-18 10:42 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
By virtue of the fact that they're P2P / on-chain as opposed to gateway oriented

[25-Jul-18 10:43 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
Why do you say that about Waves? Legit question heh I hear rumblings of it having problems but I've never seen anybody properly articulate what they are

[25-Jul-18 10:43 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
Bitshares's flaws I'm much more familiar with

[25-Jul-18 10:43 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Confirmation times on trades

[25-Jul-18 10:44 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Even though faster than atomic swap
