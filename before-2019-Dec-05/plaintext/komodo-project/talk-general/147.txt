Hey, someone of you has experience with tax? The situation in germany is following one: cryptocurrencie are taxfree if you hodl 1 year. But when you get revenue than you have to hodl 10 years. I activate my interest after one year...now my accountant say that deadline is 10 years and i have to pay taxes...is that correct?

If you 'claim' rewards these are automatically moved to that given adress

[12-Dec-18 08:14 AM] Daniel CP#2020
And then we'll have all those projects listed on the Komodo page too

@coingirl87 I'd suggest looking about the airdropvenezuela site and doing your due diligence

Ok...can you explain me the differences?

The donation is related to donating funds to random people in Venezuela via airdropvenezuela.org.

The Komodo rewards are a function of the blockchain that rewards users with a certain amount of KMD. It's 5% annually for the Komodo you hold in your address (10 KMD and above)

[12-Dec-18 11:05 PM] PTYX#6840
you should claim rewards every month. If you don't it will stop accruing.

[12-Dec-18 11:17 PM] coingirl87#6489
Thx but for me its important which impact has reward for speculative period in germany. In germany the situation is, that if you get interest from cryptocurrencie the soeculative period will extend from 1 year to 10 years...so i have to wait 10 years to sell without taxes.

[12-Dec-18 11:20 PM] coingirl87#6489
So maybe someone of you has experience with taxman how to explain that reward has no impact to speculative period
