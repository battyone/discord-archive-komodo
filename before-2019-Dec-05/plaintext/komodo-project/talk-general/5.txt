Has anybody considered using Keybase Team chat for Komodo?   Maybe a bot could log in and keep a record of the conversations from here to there.  For free, they give this service and it's all encrypted so that even the host doesn't know what's being said.  As a friend of Komodo and a http://Keybase.io user I'd be happy to start the chat groups and later add in other administrators.  However I'm not familiar with how to echo traffic from here into there.  Just as a user who occassionally logs in to the chat here, there isn't any scroll back feature that goes back months.   

But I will say this about Keybase.  If you create a user or team name on there.... don't delete it.  I wanted to create  a team for RemedyCoin but instead I created a username.  There wasn't an upgrade path so I thought I could delete my user account, use another one and create a team.  But no, usernames and teams cannot be restored, converted and if a name ever existed and was deleted, it cannot be brought back.  So I had to settle for remedycoinCom  as a team name.  

They also have Git archive services for teams that offers pgp signing of patches.

[06-Jun-18 03:08 AM] mitchellroper#0000
just to clarify: dPoW shows interoperability of different blockchain at a basic level or does this only work for KMD due to being a fork of Z-cash which itself was a fork of BTC (if using BTC to notarize)  ?

[06-Jun-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#0000
It only uses, transactions with OP_RETURN, so I guess any chain with that could work. It would depend how much diffrent the code is to BTC on how hard it is to code into the deamon itself.

Thank you very much for the suggestion. http://Matrix.org is encrypted as well and as far as I can tell it will become much better in the future. For the community chat we want to use Discord, for the internal chat we want to use Matrix.

Maybe stupid question, but i wonder why there are 2 sequences NN / free for all and not something continuous (example every 5 blocks easy diff for 1 NN - with the existing system of rotation between NN)

[07-Jun-18 11:00 AM] sapharic#0000
I think when you say "randomness", you mean "the Unability to predict who will get the next block" ?

why bitpanda not on cmc ?

[07-Jun-18 11:27 AM] imylomylo#0000
<@U8BDP1UE8> within the NN mining, there's a selection process - it is random.  but it's not a free for all between NNs and the one with more hash will get next block.  there's some courtesy in the algorithm so-to-speak.   during gpu free for all, it's "random"/"unpredictable"/"chance" and more hashpower increases chances of finding block.

in NNs, there is the "chance" aspect, but then once you are "the chosen one" (and there are more than one "chosen one" per round) you will not be "the chosen one" until others have had a chance to be "the chosen one" for a number of rounds....and then the cycle again goes to a random state with 60+ possibilities.

[07-Jun-18 11:30 AM] imylomylo#0000
so yes....unable to predict who gets next block, but fairly certain who won't get it.  e.g. if komodopioneers_SH got block 870250, it's 99.9% chance it won't get 870251, but maybe a bit of random has happened for that to be the case, when round-robin cycle begins again.

again, this is vague ‚òù don't go writing that answer in an exam and expect full marks üòÑ

<!here> I have a favour to ask you. I'd love the Bitpanda news to be shared far and wide and I've written a little template for anyone who wouldn't mind sharing this news with x 2 communities or groups they're active in. You might like to say...

``` 

"IOTA, Komodo Platform and more coming to Bitpanda" (3 minute read on Medium).

1 - This means a new alternative to coinbase and $BTC transfers to a $KMD $MIOT listed exchange! 
2 - It means $KMD and $MIOTA tokens finally have a direct fiat pair on Bitpanda! 
3 - Trading starts on June 12th.

[07-Jun-18 01:15 PM] sapharic#0000
I understand well what you wrote. I have the same understanding. I was just wondering why you can't consider every 5 block, there is 1 block with easy diff (so for NN). For the blocks with easy diff, you can well follow the "round robin" rule. 

I see 2 advantages : 

1 - miners can play with the 2 sequences, they must always be on KMD.

2 - it avoids the generation of orphan blocks (currently it happens when transitions "NN <-> free for all" occur.

[07-Jun-18 01:22 PM] jl777#0000
it would complicate the logic a lot and already this is a performance bottleneck for syncing
