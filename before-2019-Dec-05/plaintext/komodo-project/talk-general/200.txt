Also, the bottom group of blocks is just an invert of the top group.

[04-Feb-19 10:40 AM] cryptocat#9465
It's a mirror image on the vertical (y) axis

[04-Feb-19 10:53 AM] cryptocat#9465
So the answer may be something like 123454321

@Uvuvwevwevwe @BlackJesus thanks for pointing out the FAQ link - I have fixed that now. Much appreciated.

SO based on the number of links, it could be a few variations...

[04-Feb-19 11:17 AM] cryptocat#9465
Is it the whole link? Do two half links make a whole?

First Hint 🤯: Euclid is one of the first to have really studied the properties of the number direclty related to the seed. 
The image is more a way to understand how the seed is written with this number.

Maybe the angles of the boxes mean something. They could be repositioned to fit with the fibonacci number sequence?

Might be of use

[04-Feb-19 12:00 PM] cryptocat#9465
I'm still curious how we quantify the image into data? The number of links between each have no relevance?

[04-Feb-19 12:00 PM] cryptocat#9465
Can we solve it purely from the picture alone, or is another clue necessary?

[04-Feb-19 12:02 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
any additional hint is really appreciated 😸

not 777 :p

[04-Feb-19 12:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Euclide... gcd 7 blocks divided by 7 771 777 it s stupid but not overcomplicated

[04-Feb-19 12:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don t think we need to count faces divide by pi then hash it and voila

[04-Feb-19 12:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
But that s just a 1 min looking at the picture :p

[04-Feb-19 12:14 PM] cryptocat#9465
From the clue my understanding is that @sφldat wants us to use the golden number? 1.618

@sφldat NICE puzzzle! I am happy that others started making them as well. You re now the 2nd or 3rd person to release a puzzle. I will arrange a subpage on our website [hope our webguru @SHossain can take care of this?] just for the crypto-puzzles and a hall of fame (something like komodoplatform.com/cryptopuzzles) - so we keep a really nice chronological record of this amazing events.
