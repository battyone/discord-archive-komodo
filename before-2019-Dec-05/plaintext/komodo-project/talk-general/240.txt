lol maybe they incorrectly assumed guys knowledgable about all the details of the KMD code wouldn't get in the wreck the place?

[27-Mar-19 02:40 AM] bishop#9773
Again, this is a year old

[27-Mar-19 02:40 AM] crunchycat#0726
when this happened doesn't matter

[27-Mar-19 02:40 AM] bishop#9773
why it is being brought up again when the KMD community offered help is beyond me

[27-Mar-19 02:40 AM] PTYX#6840
no matter how you slice it, the safecoin developers were warned about an issue. it's documented on github. they ignored it, and subsequently someone mined coins using their ignored vulnerability.

[27-Mar-19 02:40 AM] bishop#9773
yep

[27-Mar-19 02:41 AM] PTYX#6840
those people who warned them reached out to safecoin and as far as I know, helped them fix it.

[27-Mar-19 02:41 AM] PTYX#6840
they have helped fix other bugs after that incident too

[27-Mar-19 02:41 AM] PTYX#6840
but they aren't komodo team members and much less attacking safecoin

[27-Mar-19 02:41 AM] crunchycat#0726
okay so I'll move on

[27-Mar-19 02:42 AM] crunchycat#0726
what happens to the coins utilizing KMD if the project dies or stops functioning?

[27-Mar-19 02:42 AM] bishop#9773
each coin created on the platform is its own blockchain

[27-Mar-19 02:42 AM] PTYX#6840
they can notarize themselves to another chain if they wish

[27-Mar-19 02:42 AM] crunchycat#0726
really, so they can just not use KMD and pay the fee or whatever that KMD requires?

[27-Mar-19 02:43 AM] PTYX#6840
they would need their own notary infrastructure or at least a way to create the same type of consensus

[27-Mar-19 02:43 AM] PTYX#6840
it wouldn't be as simple as pressing a button

[27-Mar-19 02:43 AM] bishop#9773
the fee is for the security and consensus KMD's platform provides

[27-Mar-19 02:43 AM] PTYX#6840
but the blockchains would be fine

[27-Mar-19 02:43 AM] bishop#9773
if you have enough hashing power, you don't need to be dpow'd

[27-Mar-19 02:44 AM] crunchycat#0726
lol nobody has enough hashing power but BTC, maybe ETH

[27-Mar-19 02:44 AM] bishop#9773
but many of the small projects do not

[27-Mar-19 02:44 AM] bishop#9773
hell some of the larger projects are vulnerable to nicehash

[27-Mar-19 02:44 AM] crunchycat#0726
yup

[27-Mar-19 02:45 AM] bishop#9773
the fee is reasonable when you think about the cost today. You can build a stash of KMD today that allows the rewards to finance the cost of dpow for the next 10-12 years and then when the rewards stop, you have the underlying principal you can source from

[27-Mar-19 02:45 AM] crunchycat#0726
alright I'll stop peppering you guys with Qs for now, I'll be back

[27-Mar-19 02:46 AM] PTYX#6840
@crunchycat what's your goal with the questions?

[27-Mar-19 02:46 AM] PTYX#6840
aficionado or reporter?

[27-Mar-19 02:46 AM] crunchycat#0726
balls deep in the crypto game, learning what I can about projects

[27-Mar-19 02:47 AM] crunchycat#0726
disclaimer, I'm looking at VBK as well

@notsofast @VeriBlock Could happen since @VeriBlock will give shitcoins better security than BTC itself.  Plus it's completely decentralized, trustless, transparent, and permissionless.  Plenty to hate there
Twitter

[27-Mar-19 03:05 AM] PTYX#6840
looks to me like you're pretty sold on VBK instead of just looking at it

[27-Mar-19 03:06 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@crunchycat If I hard coded the Pirate wallet to allow you to mine at a really low hashrate, you use that wallet?

[27-Mar-19 03:09 AM] bishop#9773
Bet your sweet ass I would ‚ù§

[27-Mar-19 03:09 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
If the answer is "yes", then that would make you an "attacker" according to those fektards

[27-Mar-19 03:09 AM] bishop#9773
Oh misread that, I assumed easy mining pirate. Doh

[27-Mar-19 03:10 AM] bishop#9773
carry on

[27-Mar-19 03:10 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I was drawing a parallel üòõ

[27-Mar-19 03:10 AM] bishop#9773
I know

[27-Mar-19 03:10 AM] PTYX#6840
@crunchycat what's the current cost to PoP?

[27-Mar-19 03:11 AM] PTYX#6840
for example if i wanted to secure my blockchain for one year on a blockchain that has 60 second blocks?

[27-Mar-19 03:14 AM] crunchycat#0726
would depend on how the altcoin using VBK to secure their chain wanted to set it up.  They could have whatever % of their block rewards go toward pop miners for the service they provide

[27-Mar-19 03:14 AM] crunchycat#0726
what they set that % at would determine how many pop miners and how often they mine

[27-Mar-19 03:15 AM] PTYX#6840
so what's the cost for one PoP notarization

[27-Mar-19 03:15 AM] PTYX#6840
at current market price?

[27-Mar-19 03:15 AM] crunchycat#0726
284 byte BTC txn, whatever the BTC sat/b is

[27-Mar-19 03:15 AM] crunchycat#0726
so 284 sats and up

[27-Mar-19 03:15 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
About the vulnerability whining 

If your business is blockchain and coding

And you don‚Äôt know blockchain and coding

What the fuck are you doing in this business?

[27-Mar-19 03:15 AM] PTYX#6840
that includes the btc and the vbk cost?

[27-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Crypto is all about trustless, and you trust

[27-Mar-19 03:16 AM] crunchycat#0726
well the vbk txn cost would be very minimal compared to a btc txn cost

[27-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Gtfo

[27-Mar-19 03:17 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Explain how you expect to be a store of value when you can‚Äôt protect it

[27-Mar-19 03:17 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fuck off

[27-Mar-19 03:17 AM] crunchycat#0726
lol not sure who you're cussing at Hollowman

[27-Mar-19 03:18 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I guess safecoin wasn‚Äôt

[27-Mar-19 03:18 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Incompetentcoin?

[27-Mar-19 03:18 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Misnomer?

[27-Mar-19 03:20 AM] crunchycat#0726
So anyway.... say you allot 1% of block rewards to pop miners, that will use VBK themselves to secure your chain to the VBK chain (and the BTC by extension).  Economics would determine the level of security you'd get, with number/frequency equalizing with the price of VBK and the altcoin

[27-Mar-19 03:20 AM] PTYX#6840
So at current price it would cost me around $19,000 a year to use PoP at 6 notarizations per hour assuming the txfee stays at current price.

[27-Mar-19 03:21 AM] PTYX#6840
I'm using some random website to look at bitcoin fees based on block size. it says a standard tx is 250 bytes

[27-Mar-19 03:21 AM] crunchycat#0726
what do you mean "it would cost me"?

[27-Mar-19 03:22 AM] PTYX#6840
If i launched a blockchain and wanted to use vbk to secure it

[27-Mar-19 03:22 AM] PTYX#6840
i have no idea what vbk can or can't do

[27-Mar-19 03:22 AM] crunchycat#0726
It would cost you a % of your block rewards, for the service of pop miners

[27-Mar-19 03:22 AM] PTYX#6840
but assuming it does what dpow does

[27-Mar-19 03:22 AM] crunchycat#0726
same as how POW miners get paid

[27-Mar-19 03:22 AM] PTYX#6840
so do i pay vbk miners the cost in my own native coin?

[27-Mar-19 03:23 AM] crunchycat#0726
but instead of only 64 notaries or whatever, it would be decentralized

[27-Mar-19 03:23 AM] crunchycat#0726
you allot a portion of block rewards to be used to incentivize pop miners

[27-Mar-19 03:23 AM] crunchycat#0726
fork the coin and change the block reward

[27-Mar-19 03:24 AM] PTYX#6840
where does the BTC come from then to notarize?

[27-Mar-19 03:24 AM] crunchycat#0726
the altcoin pop miners spend VBK to secure the altcoin to the VBK chain, then the VBK pop miners spend btc to secure the VBK chain to the BTC chain

[27-Mar-19 03:25 AM] crunchycat#0726
hell I'm spending BTC right now pop mining the VBK chain to the BTC chain

[27-Mar-19 03:25 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@crunchycat  so you are assuming that miners won't be pooling into less than 64 pools? so more decentralized?

[27-Mar-19 03:25 AM] crunchycat#0726
lol there is no "pooling" of pop miners

[27-Mar-19 03:25 AM] PTYX#6840
ok so it's similar how a komodo assechain notarizes unto komodo and subsequently komodo notarizes unto bitcoin.

[27-Mar-19 03:25 AM] crunchycat#0726
yes

[27-Mar-19 03:25 AM] PTYX#6840
and I pay the miners in my own native coin to secure my blockchain

[27-Mar-19 03:25 AM] PTYX#6840
which can be worthless

{Reactions}
üí© 

[27-Mar-19 03:25 AM] crunchycat#0726
but decentralized in that anybody with the tech knowhow can pop mine

[27-Mar-19 03:25 AM] crunchycat#0726
yes

[27-Mar-19 03:26 AM] crunchycat#0726
but like I said, how many and how often they pop mine will be determined by how much incentive they have to do it

[27-Mar-19 03:26 AM] PTYX#6840
where does VBK get the bitcoin to keep notarizing (forever) if the blockchains that it's protecting aren't adding any value to the network?

[27-Mar-19 03:27 AM] crunchycat#0726
the pop miners, like me, spend the BTC to "notarize" the VBK chain to the BTC chain

[27-Mar-19 03:27 AM] PTYX#6840
yes, i understand that concept

[27-Mar-19 03:27 AM] crunchycat#0726
I'm incentivized to do it based on how many VBK I get and what it's worth

[27-Mar-19 03:27 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
So you sacrifice Btc in hopes the native coin paid is worth it for you financially?

[27-Mar-19 03:28 AM] meatspoon#7860
When i read "crunchycat" and also see a soft mound of poo with an endearing smile, my mind malfunctions.  It is very distracting.  I am formally requesting that you change your avatar to something more crispedly feline.

[27-Mar-19 03:28 AM] crunchycat#0726
@Crabby Paddy yes

[27-Mar-19 03:28 AM] PTYX#6840
right, but if VBK is securing mostly worthless chains, how is this self sustaining?

[27-Mar-19 03:28 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
When vbk drops to single shitoshis?

[27-Mar-19 03:28 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
üê±

[27-Mar-19 03:28 AM] crunchycat#0726
lol @meatspoon then my work here is done

{Reactions}
üï∫üèº 

[27-Mar-19 03:29 AM] crunchycat#0726
just hold tight, I'm sure you'll see VBK isn't going to be relegated to securing total shitcoins with no value

[27-Mar-19 03:29 AM] PTYX#6840
What prevents me from adding 100 worthless chains and paying your PoP miners a lot of my worthless tokens to mine?

[27-Mar-19 03:29 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Do pop miners get to choose what to mine or not mine

[27-Mar-19 03:29 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
What if they collaborate to not mine a chain for their own purposes

[27-Mar-19 03:30 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Or if not, what if they‚Äôre forced to mine 10000 worthless chains

[27-Mar-19 03:30 AM] PTYX#6840
yeah, what about collusion to exclude certain blockchains from the network
