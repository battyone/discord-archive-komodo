Barterlly is an amazing product. Keen to make use of it!

[12-May-19 03:29 AM] PTYX#6840
Agreed, barterly looks awesome

[12-May-19 05:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Great work @Deleted User

[12-May-19 05:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
KYC and AML required above limits/

[12-May-19 05:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What are the limits?

[12-May-19 05:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
10k€/day

[12-May-19 05:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Decent amount

[12-May-19 05:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Is there a way to see open trades that are waiting to be fulfilled without signing up?

[12-May-19 05:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
for public ones, it s basically on the orderbook

[12-May-19 05:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
private ones are not parseable automagically as of now, on purpose

[12-May-19 05:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
How can i see the orderbook?

[12-May-19 05:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
we are mainly working on our first set of "tools" that are using the API to provide services

[12-May-19 05:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
the API will be opened for devs on a specific infrastructure, and sandbox env

[12-May-19 05:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
as everything you see on the current GUI can be obtained from API calls, we want to keep a specific amount on time with just that part opened, and will do the exact same thing for API, than for GUI : open for testers on a dedicated infrastructure, and when validated, go live for users wanting it.

[12-May-19 05:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Cool

[12-May-19 05:49 AM] Acura#2748
@hyperDEX click on public offers

[12-May-19 05:53 AM] TonyL#3577
@Deleted User Are accounts validating automatically?
Registered, clicked on link in email, got `Your email has been validated successfully.` message, but when trying to sign-in receiving: `Your account not active`

[12-May-19 05:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, already reported, the level remains to 0 as of now, the yesterdays update didn t enforce it, I added it to our debug chan listing issues, we will wrap this with other changes and will update

[12-May-19 05:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
in the meantime I ll just handle it

[12-May-19 05:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
as I don't want users to massively report error 500 when I ll have to recompile, I will just make sure it s fixed on separate infra then will post warnings before downtime for update (should be less than few seconds for users, so only browseing ones during the refresh will get an error)

[12-May-19 05:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Acura cool i missed that. Looks good

[12-May-19 05:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
On that page you spelt offers as offres 😄

[12-May-19 05:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah 😄

[12-May-19 05:56 AM] Deleted User#0000

[12-May-19 06:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
reported both issues, thanks ^^, feel free to join the discord and just publish on #support , I wouldn't want to spam the general here :p

[12-May-19 06:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
about the public offers, keep in mind the current orderbook is filled with test swaps, with no link to the reality in terms of price, I ve put like 80 offers with 1 KMD for 1 <insert AC name here>

[12-May-19 06:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
so the numbers and graphs won t make any sense until people will have filled em

[12-May-19 06:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
something possible, and recommended, is to test with chains like PIZZA or BEER for test, or any other coin.
I could have created two chains just for this test with a faucet, but it can't live on the same app that is in prod, cause lawyers could just tell me I m selling coins.

[12-May-19 06:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
but this will be the case when we will open API for devs testing

[12-May-19 06:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
basically on a sandboxed version with no limit for tests

One of the projects I follow recently just released a crypto marketplace, like an Ebay, but payment is in crypto. I'd love to see KMD on there! If someone from the team wants the links to check it out, please direct me to who I should send a dm about this! or send me a dm, either way

@jl777c i could send them over to you if you'd like. i see you are online so figured I'd tag you xD

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 do you object to the above? it is borderline, but i dont remember seeing a post like that in the last week

[12-May-19 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't really "object" to any of it, except when it's like 9 people 1 right after the other 😛

[12-May-19 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
I want to be fair about applying the censorship rules

[12-May-19 02:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my point was more about no one saying:
"Hey asshole, quit scrolling the same post or it will be deleted"
rather than just a "random" deletion with 0 warning as to who did it and why

[12-May-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry, was too tired to explain. at least it made for a good puzzle

This will be 100% the standard in the future! @barterlly acknowledging the usefulness and security of dPoW by @KomodoPlatform. 30 confirmations needed for Non-dPoW coins, 1 notarization needed for dPoW coins, which means 2 confirmations. #blockchain #crypto #51percentattack

@Deleted User 30 is quite low amount of confs for some coins, I think it's best to set confs on a case by case basis if you aren't already

cause if the rawconfirmation is not there it failsafes to 30 or whatever is configured per coin

for low hashrate coins yes it s too small

solutions for this exist, like hashrate fluctuations checks

should change their settings, PIRATE doesn't work that way

I can setup confs by coins btw it s not an overall rule

[12-May-19 05:31 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 why does solo not just mine directly to R address in cb?

[12-May-19 05:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because the z vs R vs shielding is already confusing enough for some folks
and that still doesn't change the old HUSHv2 addy 😛

If you're considering new blood within the notary node community, I believe I am your candidate :) I am dedicating a portion of my nodes mining rewards to a development fund. The initial funds will go towards the chips gui, but will then be available for any projects within the community. I hope this will give projects the little kick start they may need to really get going. Please have a read of my proposal and consider me when voting for a southern hemisphere candidate. Thanks!
Vote for NutellaLicka!

I hope that next year there will be a dedicated site/channel for vote stuff. And it's not allowed to promote one's candidate in any other channel then the vote/site but that could be a bot that send out 6-10 time a day that a reminder that ppl need to check out the vote channel/site, every candidate get promotion from the other channels whit none of the spam/bloat. Is there anyone that feels the same way og have a different opinion? Love to hear it
