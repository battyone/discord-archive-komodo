probably dPow is the more costly in all this if you don't need that you can get away with a thousand bucks a year probably

[20-Oct-19 03:38 PM] Oszy#5734
I am not sure about prices 🙂

[20-Oct-19 03:38 PM] Fynn#3178
mhm okay

[20-Oct-19 03:38 PM] Fynn#3178
thx for the info

[20-Oct-19 03:39 PM] Oszy#5734
feel free to ask in #dev-general  about development questions if you'll have any

[20-Oct-19 03:39 PM] Oszy#5734
and #antara-composer-beta about the composer and prices

[20-Oct-19 03:41 PM] Fynn#3178
thx alot

[20-Oct-19 03:42 PM] Fynn#3178
I will talk things thru with Eugen in about 1 hour, he's the founder of our church. To get a better idea of what we really need here

[20-Oct-19 03:52 PM] Oszy#5734
if you want to accept anonymous private donations use PirateChain (ARRR) 😛 already existing blockchain

[20-Oct-19 03:52 PM] Oszy#5734
it depends what you need you may not need your own chain

[20-Oct-19 03:56 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Pirate chain in a church, why not 😄 Only God knows how much you give

Just forget about the ARRRmageddon 😄

Looks like the COMMOD announcement on Bitcointalk is shadowbanned, but maybe they'll take off the restrictions eventually.  I'm pretty sure the only people who have commented are the ones who followed the link from here, because I've never been able to find the thread by browsing the forum.

[20-Oct-19 04:12 PM] Oszy#5734
the page certainly looks interesting now

[20-Oct-19 04:17 PM] Regnar#6164
@Fynn if you or one of your members has some technical background you can launch your own chain for free by following the documentation here:

 <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/creating-and-distributing-a-new-komodo-smart-chain.html#abstract> 

There's also likely a mobile wallet that will list you for free (many charge listing fees as it is their actual business) but I think maybe Verus Agama mobile as it is open source, you can ask in their channel what the cost is, if any.

[20-Oct-19 04:18 PM] Regnar#6164
but still, dPoW if you want 51% attack protection, will cost money (as it actually costs money to operate for Komodo)

[20-Oct-19 04:20 PM] Regnar#6164
@blackjok3r may know something about dPoW using the KMDLABS notaries if you also want to explore that route, but I'm not too familiar with it.

[20-Oct-19 04:26 PM] Oszy#5734
@runpaint when the chain params will be published, and orders in atomicdex avaiable?

[20-Oct-19 04:28 PM] runpaint#7773
We have orders already for 11 coins: ETH, LTC, DASH, USDC, DOGE, QTUM, RVN, DGB, KMD, BAT, & VRSC.  But there aren't many coins to trade yet, until we get the mining pool fixed at pool.kmd.dev

[20-Oct-19 04:28 PM] Oszy#5734
I can't see any

[20-Oct-19 04:29 PM] runpaint#7773
And the chain parameters are in the .bat file download with the beta wallet

[20-Oct-19 04:30 PM] Oszy#5734
can't download wallet either

[20-Oct-19 04:30 PM] runpaint#7773
The AtomicDEX orders are all buying COMMOD, so you'd have to have some COMMOD to see them.  When the pool is fixed, and we have some COMMOD to spend, we'll put some orders the other way so you can buy some COMMOD.

[20-Oct-19 04:31 PM] Oszy#5734
oh buy orders

[20-Oct-19 04:31 PM] Oszy#5734
ok

[20-Oct-19 04:31 PM] runpaint#7773
What's the issue downloading the wallet, is it your browser's anti-virus censorship?

[20-Oct-19 04:33 PM] Oszy#5734
no there is a space in the URL 🙂

[20-Oct-19 04:33 PM] Oszy#5734

ok i found the issue

[20-Oct-19 04:38 PM] runpaint#7773
We're stuck at block 161, because there is no mining software that allows solo-mining on Equihash, and our knomp pools return "stratum_subscribe timed out".  That was my first question to the Komodo team before we launched: "Will this blockchain be entirely dependent upon 1 mining pool when it launches?" If that was the case, I wanted PoS or a different algorithm, but those aren't available.  They assured me that it wouldn't be a problem, but it is.

[20-Oct-19 04:38 PM] Oszy#5734
your wallet launcher .bat file has an error

[20-Oct-19 04:39 PM] Oszy#5734
and what is wrong with cpu mining this chain?

[20-Oct-19 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`no mining software that allows solo-mining on Equihash`
it shouldn't take long to make one of my solo pools work

[20-Oct-19 04:40 PM] Oszy#5734
not stuck, i am mining, but  `Invalid block mined, try again` for every block 🙂

no indeed! I checked also and find this rather curious!
also, there is the BARR project that also seems to take an interest in KMD- I think these are all good signs,
like natural adoption by resilient grass roots projects  during deepest and darkest altcoin winter!

[21-Oct-19 11:36 PM] MorganJekyll#8355
Yeah I’m just messing around with some swap pairs. How would we describe reasons behind holding KMD other then staking for 5%? What are the utilities behind it? What’s unique about holding KMD vs other smart chain coins? I have a few ideas I just don’t know how I would explain it to someone else

[21-Oct-19 11:43 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
You need it for DPoW fees if you are a dev.   There are modules being made that give KMD its utility , #cc-pegs  is a big one.
