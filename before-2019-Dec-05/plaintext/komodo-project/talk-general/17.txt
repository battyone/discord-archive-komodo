[28-Jun-18 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe GPU will get a competitive miner for VRSC and ASIC are long way away

if you have capital  tied up in old tech, then you need to find ways to keep it generating revenues during its end of life, this is logic. no need to get emotional about it

[28-Jun-18 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
but as a coin, we cant be playing favorites about whose capital investment we will maximize the value of

Hi everyone I have an idea for a 'brief and micro-bounties' community that would create a decentralized resource for our content, comms and marketing and bring it into line with Komodo's ecosystem. I've recorded a video of myself explaining it (not offical KMD video just me talking!).

If you're interested please come and share your thoughts here and leave comments https://forum.komodoplatform.com/t/about-the-komodo-influencer-network-category/117. 

If this gains enough traction and you like the idea I can take this to Steve and JL777 and suggest we try it out. Please make your voice heard! 

P.S. if you just want the video it's here https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=O1LdWU1WEQo.

Bounty0x is a great resource that I'd recommend. Makes the bounty process *a lot* more clear-cut and straightforward.

Can I activate the etomic wallet just by buying Komodo and trading it for etomic in barterdex? I want to trade erc20 tokens.

[29-Jun-18 03:25 PM] gcharang#6833
Etomic is used in the background. You don't need to buy it.

[29-Jun-18 03:26 PM] 12thandgrantco#3354
It keeps saying I need to activate etomic before I can add erc20 tokens and ethereum to my barterdex when it opens

[29-Jun-18 03:33 PM] Hermes#6934
I will suggest that you use Hyperdex for now Etomic is enabled and processed automatically

BarterDEX's coin list system has been changed to allow for so many coins being added (in excess of 256). The change was to reduce the amount of coins on startup, use a call to update the coins list dynamically (rather than waiting for an updated release or having "releases" for the sake of coins list), and have users add whatever they want. @12thandgrantco

[29-Jun-18 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
HyperDEX, being a different app, functions differently

[29-Jun-18 03:38 PM] 12thandgrantco#3354
@Hermes I'll check it out. Thank you

[29-Jun-18 03:40 PM] 12thandgrantco#3354
@ComputerGenie Ok thank you. I'm new to barterdex so I'll have to do some more research and use the app more to get used to it.

The irony

[29-Jun-18 04:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
to trade eth/erc20 in barterdex,
- go to manage coins
- add coins from left pane to the list
- add as many fav coins you want
- restart barterdex. close, open again, login.
- enable coins with add coin button
- must enable ETOMIC, before enabling any other ETH or ERC20 coin.

get help further from community in #dev-tradebots

[29-Jun-18 04:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you'll only need to get ETOMIC from someone.
