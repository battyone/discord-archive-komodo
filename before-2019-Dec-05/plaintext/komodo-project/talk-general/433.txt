Right my thought is that we could expand docs to cover them as well.

it is not free to use as the nodes and related infrastructure needed to launch a blockchain cost money

[18-Sep-19 05:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@groundhog  you can spawn a chain with cli for free ( infrastructure not included )

[18-Sep-19 05:30 PM] groundhog#0062

[18-Sep-19 05:31 PM] groundhog#0062
so we make all the settings on the cli? manual as we would usem them on antara launcher later?

[18-Sep-19 05:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Either that or launch from your Testnet straight to production,  but would have to arrange DPoW and other integrations independently through our service providers

[18-Sep-19 05:34 PM] jorian#4555
the Antara composer is a graphical interface to what you can do on the cli as well

[18-Sep-19 05:34 PM] jorian#4555
the difference is that the composer asks money, the cli doesn't

[18-Sep-19 05:34 PM] jorian#4555
there is a bunch of documentation that can help you set things up on the cli

[18-Sep-19 05:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Composer also deploys servers and includes DPoW
