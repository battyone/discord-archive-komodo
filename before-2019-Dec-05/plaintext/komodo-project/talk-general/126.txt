@twistedmind We hear that criticism a lot and understand your concnerns

[08-Nov-18 11:18 AM] twistedmind#1523
thanks

[08-Nov-18 11:18 AM] Daniel CP#2020
However, there are no failed projects

[08-Nov-18 11:18 AM] twistedmind#1523
i am a long holder and want to see the success

[08-Nov-18 11:19 AM] snowdamn#2414
@Daniel CP awesome! üëç 
i'd do it when not much is going on in crypto tbh
not worth waiting for a milestone and risk it coinciding with a major event in crypto
want as many üëÄ we can get

SuperNET was built on NXT, NXT changed the transaction fee structure without consulting the projects built on top of it, so SuperNET moved on

[08-Nov-18 11:19 AM] twistedmind#1523
its hard to get others involved then having to constantly update them when they cant even keep track of whats going on

[08-Nov-18 11:19 AM] Daniel CP#2020
As far as I know, Bitcoin Dark was not jl777's project. He wasn't lead dev

[08-Nov-18 11:19 AM] twistedmind#1523
yes it was

[08-Nov-18 11:20 AM] Daniel CP#2020
we can ask the man himself for clarification @jl777c

[08-Nov-18 11:20 AM] twistedmind#1523
barterdex is a mess

[08-Nov-18 11:20 AM] twistedmind#1523
no volume and impossible to use

[08-Nov-18 11:20 AM] twistedmind#1523
try it yourself to see

[08-Nov-18 11:20 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I could be wrong but I seem to recall him saying he didn't found the BTCD project. BTCD holders were allowed to swap for KMD but he didn't start the porject

[08-Nov-18 11:21 AM] twistedmind#1523
hyperdex is suppose to be "grandma" friendly?

[08-Nov-18 11:21 AM] Daniel CP#2020
"its hard to get others involved then having to constantly update them when they cant even keep track of whats going on"

--> we are 100% in agreement here. This is what the rebrand is trying to solve

[08-Nov-18 11:21 AM] twistedmind#1523
not a change unless grandma is a techie

[08-Nov-18 11:21 AM] twistedmind#1523
then i can agree with you

[08-Nov-18 11:21 AM] twistedmind#1523
and look forward to the rebranding

[08-Nov-18 11:22 AM] Daniel CP#2020
BarterDEX is tough to use, yes. Artem is working on a marketmaker 2.0 which will improve functionality

[08-Nov-18 11:22 AM] twistedmind#1523
thanks for taking the time to explain in a professional mannor

[08-Nov-18 11:22 AM] Daniel CP#2020
While HyperDEX has a shiny new GUI

[08-Nov-18 11:22 AM] Daniel CP#2020
No worries, we're happy to answer questions. The team shares a lot of your views and we're working to fix these things

[08-Nov-18 11:22 AM] twistedmind#1523
i was taken off guard when i just heard about this rebranding

[08-Nov-18 11:23 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Ah well the rebrand has been going on for about 2 months. We're well under way now, I can't commit to dates but I'd say we're around the halfway point now

what about my agama wallet that is noy giving me rewards? im using the latest wallet

[08-Nov-18 11:33 AM] twistedmind#1523
sept 8th was the last

[08-Nov-18 11:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
does anything happen when you click on the "claim now" button?

[08-Nov-18 11:35 AM] twistedmind#1523
let me check

[08-Nov-18 11:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
also, try #deleted-channel, or #support

[08-Nov-18 11:36 AM] twistedmind#1523
nothing. says i have 0 to claim

[08-Nov-18 11:40 AM] snowdamn#2414
@twistedmind send full balance to yourself to start off with a fresh UTXO
also, it accumulates for 31 days now, not yearly
get rid of old wallet cache before trying the above, maybe it's glitch

[08-Nov-18 11:42 AM] twistedmind#1523
will i get my past rewards?

[08-Nov-18 11:42 AM] twistedmind#1523
my other wallets work fine

[08-Nov-18 11:42 AM] twistedmind#1523
this wallet has 76k kmd

[08-Nov-18 11:43 AM] Acura#2748
@twistedmind i think you have an old agama wallet

[08-Nov-18 11:43 AM] twistedmind#1523
nope

[08-Nov-18 11:43 AM] snowdamn#2414
yes, older APR can be claimed, but they have stopped accumulating

[08-Nov-18 11:43 AM] twistedmind#1523
new one

[08-Nov-18 11:43 AM] twistedmind#1523
on 2 computers

[08-Nov-18 11:44 AM] snowdamn#2414
send 76k - 0.0001 to yourself, make it exact amount

[08-Nov-18 11:45 AM] Acura#2748
@twistedmind which agama you use version ?

[08-Nov-18 11:45 AM] twistedmind#1523
shit, just sent the max

[08-Nov-18 11:46 AM] snowdamn#2414
max is what you want
is balance more now?

[08-Nov-18 11:46 AM] snowdamn#2414
than what was sent

[08-Nov-18 11:50 AM] snowdamn#2414
also, are you using SPV or native?

[08-Nov-18 11:54 AM] twistedmind#1523
waiting for conformations. showing o balance w 2 conf

[08-Nov-18 11:55 AM] snowdamn#2414
wait, is this the same wallet where you enter the others that are working or on different computer?

[08-Nov-18 11:56 AM] snowdamn#2414
are you native? based on the explorer i think you got xxx.xxxxxxx KMD

[08-Nov-18 11:57 AM] twistedmind#1523
no, diff wallet when i sign in the others

[08-Nov-18 11:58 AM] snowdamn#2414
ok, shut down the wallet, delete Agama folder in cache, run again

[08-Nov-18 11:59 AM] snowdamn#2414
if i'm reading the explorer correctly, you're running native, you successfully claimed, and APR was sent to new address

[08-Nov-18 12:00 PM] snowdamn#2414
@twistedmind copy your wallet.dat before deleting anything

@wolfgang as long as there are people willing to sell it for 50% of what it was a year ago, buyers will be happy to buy it at that price and there it will stay

[08-Nov-18 12:54 PM] actionslacks#4072
maybe komodo sounds too much like commode-o.

There are coins out there which are absolute trash - sellings dozen times the price of kmd.

[08-Nov-18 12:56 PM] wolfgang#3508
yet kmd is mind blowingly amazing and selling for peanuts

[08-Nov-18 12:56 PM] wolfgang#3508

a lot of shit coins pay for "interviews" and "reviews" that are nothing more than paid advertisements
hell, a lot of non-shitcoins do too

Man I love this coin. The wallet integration with ERC20s is awesome

[08-Nov-18 02:10 PM] BTC-BTC-BTC#4223
Hi, is KMD still getting 5% per year? is there a minimum time we need to wait before we start getting interest?

[08-Nov-18 02:26 PM] yorklab#7270
You need to claim every month now, but still 5% (or actually 5.1 % I think). After claiming it takes one hour before you start to accrue reward again.

[08-Nov-18 02:46 PM] Nabob#5004
@BTC-BTC-BTC  refer this document for detailed Info

[08-Nov-18 03:12 PM] Meyse#0952
I was wondering if there is a demand for a mobile app to just claim your monthly kmd rewards. Login with your seed, only options in app are to claim rewards (=send transaction to yourself), no send or receive options. With notifications when to claim on best possible time

[08-Nov-18 03:12 PM] Meyse#0952
So actually just 1 button "claim rewards"

[08-Nov-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Well, as far as I understand it, the idea was meant to be a reward for *using* KMD (which is why you get it on a send); that being the case, a "one touch" reward claim (with a phone "alarm" reminding you to do so) is self-defeating to any efforts of getting people to actually use KMD as a currency

[08-Nov-18 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
>I can't buy groceries today, my rewards haven't confirmed yet

[08-Nov-18 03:21 PM] Meyse#0952
A transaction is a transaction, even to yourself? Or am i missing something?

[08-Nov-18 03:22 PM] Meyse#0952
I assume there are many hodlers that just do this already, why not make it easy for them?

The creation of a transaction to yourself is not the same as actual usage of the currency
And none of that even covers the 9999 reasons why continually using the same address (as opposed to the "same" wallet) is a horrible idea

[08-Nov-18 03:24 PM] Meyse#0952
you dont think many people are actually doing this already? hitting the claim reward button on Agama does just that

[08-Nov-18 03:25 PM] SHossain#0007
@grewalsatinder this is a video. please find a gif image

[08-Nov-18 03:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[08-Nov-18 03:25 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
There are many people driving a spike through their hands with a claw hammer; that doesn't make that a good idea to do, either

[08-Nov-18 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`hitting the claim reward button on Agama does just that`
There's no part of me that's a fan of the more recent addition of sending to same addy on that either

[08-Nov-18 03:27 PM] snowdamn#2414
same address is only when using SPV (not native), correct?

[08-Nov-18 03:28 PM] Meyse#0952
just call it "hodl & claim kmd rewards" something something. if there is this need,  it should be catered for. but im not sure if there is

[08-Nov-18 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@snowdamn iirc, there's a new option to send back to same addy

[08-Nov-18 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
even with native

[08-Nov-18 03:28 PM] snowdamn#2414
ok, didn't know that
