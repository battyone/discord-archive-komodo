I got the idea - check out the bitcointalk thread

[22-Oct-19 06:40 AM] LocoMB#8593
way back in 2015 someone had a funny idea to burn SHITCOINS- and put that project on NXT 
The idea (of this BARR project as they called it) was to focus the mana of a gazillion shitcoins into one collector coin, and thus gather something out of them,
like pooling the disperse communites, and also getting rid of a lot of shitcoins...
Sounded like a cool idea, and wouldn't cost anything except people getting rid of  some worthless shitcoins-
only they did it on NXT which was screwed up by the pigheaded control freaks that took it over from CfB in the early days.
Now the same guys have the notion to migrate this project to KMD platform somehow.

[22-Oct-19 07:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I read the Barrcoin thread , but not sure what the use case for it was,  just a currency afaik

[22-Oct-19 08:41 AM] LocoMB#8593
yes, to collect as many disgruntled and burnt shitcoin miners and investors as possible

for me that's related to Komodo.  komodo made dICOs 2 years ago?  what is the difference to mcafees dIEO?
Will there still be dICOs or is the fear of regulation too big?  I have not heard anything about Komodo dICOs for a long time.

"It allows creating a coin that is pegged (bound) to some other currency. In essence a mechanism for creating a decentralized stable coin. Using Tokens CC and Gateways CC other crypto currencies can be deposited on chain in form of tokens and locked in an account so it can back a coin with existing value. "

```https://medium.com/@jameslee777/dual-daemon-chains-to-integrate-non-bitcoin-protocols-6d5b1b1f221
```
```Some custom code needs to be added to the non-komodo coin to implement the burn and import, but once that is done, then a 1:1 fungible dual-daemon can be created```
If Dogecoin adopted this, would this eliminate the need to atomic swap with Doge and Kmd?
```The komodo chain cluster of coda dual-daemons is thus the ultimate solution for scaling transactions. 
Make sure to only do the minimal amount of transactions on the komodo side, ie. exchange transfers and cross chain transfers to other chains in the cluster.```
Does this mean komodo is acting as gas in this instance?

[26-Oct-19 05:09 AM] jl777c#5810
DOGE has no actual functionality other than payments, it would not make sense to do a dual daemon with it

[26-Oct-19 05:09 AM] jl777c#5810
the dualdaemon is at the source level, and would be an independent chain, there is no DOGE protocol

[26-Oct-19 05:10 AM] jl777c#5810
think of dual-daemon as a way to get a totally different protocol into the ecosystem, ethereum, neo, any of the new protocols that are coming out.

[26-Oct-19 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810
so with dual-daemon tech, we can bolt on any new protocol (even ones that are not invented yet) and make it part of the ecosystem

it works at the source level and the dualdaemon creates a new network, but in some specific cases like the codaprotocol, the result solves an otherwise unsolved problem. namely how to do 1 million tx/sec and not get flooded with terabytes of data
