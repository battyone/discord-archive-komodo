There might be a few hundred people who read everything Komodo publishes and we're very grateful for these people but we need to grow beyond that small, dedicated following

Thanks again everyone for all the comments and feedback. I'll make a few adjustments and put an updated version online today

I just wanted to say, I feel that the "2018 End of year report" document is impressive.

To me it is a piece of literary and graphic artistry. Well done to all that worked on it üëå

@openbazaar with your crypto-crypto markets, you & @KomodoPlatform should work together to bring atomic swaps to OpenBazaar! Your sellers could make instant swaps of any coin & share a decentralized liquidity pool with DEXs! real p2p atomic swaps too, not a proxy token on ...

^ Would be a cool opportunity. This idea was from earlier, but with MM2 being in private alpha right now, it wouldn't be a bad idea to start making some headway into new markets üòÉ

[04-Feb-19 04:09 AM] Regnar#6164
I imagine each one of these as an open order in the order book, available to be filled on OpenBazaar, HyperDEX, BarterDEX, or any other GUI running MM2.

Can anyone tell me more about Chainlizard?

[05-Feb-19 03:55 PM] Audo#5667
I'm not sure what has been said, but we cannot share details before everything is finalized. Our team is working on our product strategy which is part of the rebrand process.

[05-Feb-19 04:46 PM] Audo#5667
it's a product code name :)

In general we are looking into what kind of products we want to develop. We have talked about the Agama Wallet rebrand, which is user facing product, but we also want to build tools for the developers/businesses.

Does the upcoming KMD/USD pairing Bittrex have something to do with the rebrand?  Kind of seems like it's coming out of nowhere

[06-Feb-19 02:18 AM] Audo#5667
Bittrex is a quality excange and they want to support quality projects. They contacted us to tell that they have decided to add KMD/USD pair. It's not directly linked with rebrand, but I'm sure our project's activity boosts the confidence of all exchanges in general.

anyone have a good, succinct, twitter length (or slightly longer) explanation of MM2. Preferably with some analogies to compare to lol. Like saying (and I'm just making this up) "Komodo's new atomic swap powered DEX has a superior decentralized orderbook and order matching, similar to how peers find one another when using torrents"

@benohanlon I have a few suggestions for Linkedin contacts if they aren't already in your list

First are the 4 guys of <https://51pct.io/> listed at the end of the main page, they published a 2 parts article for their subscribers about interoperability:
<https://51pct.io/interoperability-and-composability-killer-of-redundant-blockchains-part-1/>
<https://51pct.io/polkadot-vs-cosmos-the-disastrous-issue-and-crowning-a-winner-part-2/>
mainly about Cosmos and Polkadot with some mention of other projects but nothing about Komodo 

Second I found this other article about interoperability on Fitzener Blockchain consulting:
<https://fitznerblockchain.consulting/interoperability-the-key-to-unlocking-the-potential-of-blockchain/> again there are some projects mentioned but not Komodo. There are profiles of 3 founders in the about page

[07-Feb-19 09:25 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I notice that Vaibhav Sani < https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasadev/> hasn't yet updated his ContractPedia  with Komodo: <https://hackernoon.com/contractpedia-an-encyclopedia-of-40-smart-contract-platforms-4867f66da1e5> did he ever answer to your message?

[09-Feb-19 12:12 AM] Regnar#6164
Suggestion for the chainlizards product (I don't know if this was planned already) but I assume there is agama/barterdex integration options, is there an explorer option as well? I'm thinking if they want the explorer it creates a <YOURCOIN.explorer.dexstats> explorer for them. 

With this it might also be a cool idea to have a live demo with modular color schemes, description, and logos for their custom explorer. I'm thinking if they provided a logo, we use the logo on the page and also extract the colors from the logo to create a way to simply click and change the color scheme of their explorer using the extracted colors (add a regular palette too) they could even match it to their external websites colors if they have one. They then fill in a type box of their chain's description, and another field for their website URL if they have one. 

Then while looking at the demo, they finalize it all and we add the Wallet: <link agama> Exchanges: <link BarterDEX>, and some "powered by Komodo" logo or something too. Basically a modular way to build something like the PIRATE explorer <https://explorer.pirate.black/> which looks like a different wrapper on the regular kmd.explorer.


Along with the explorer should be clearer, on-page API documentation so they don't have to go through insight github looking for docs, and also know what APIs will be activated (total supply, circulating supply, active wallets, or other metrics that are useful for businesses and 3rd parties, like if they are building their own mobile wallets) 

With this explorer and the APIs, we can then pass along all this information they have already filled out to this form <https://coinpaprika.com/add/> or perhaps work out a better way with coinpaprika, in order to list their new coin. There's a lot of extra detail they would be better off going to coinpaprika to do themselves, but the initial listing is valuable and only possible with API endpoints to a valid explorer for things like circulating supply.

[09-Feb-19 12:12 AM] Regnar#6164
Basically I laid out a lot of steps, but it would be a huge value add to simply point and click your own custom explorer to be added, have it match your projects colors simply(palette extractor) and have the relevant API endpoints available on the explorer and submitted to Coinpaprika (I use them because they have been super helpful when I submit changes and API updates for Komodo projects)

[09-Feb-19 12:24 AM] Regnar#6164
Eventually you could add more modular options to their explorers, like Faucets, bootstraps, mining pool info, and expand the analytics and charts sections to include transactions, tx/s, active addresses, 2 week value transferred by day, 2 week tx count by day, 2 week address growth by day. Again, all value added stuff. Whether we charge for the value added or not, Idk

[09-Feb-19 09:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
As @PTYX mentioned in general, it would be great exposure and have more projects flock to get dpow for their chain?

[09-Feb-19 07:17 PM] Regnar#6164
@Audo I meant to tag you with that massive message I wrote ^^^ 
TLDR - Click and build project-color themed block explorers, upgrade statistics/analytics charts and trackers on explorers, clearer API documentation on explorer pages, automatically submit new coin info/logos/links/APIs to Coinpaprika, CMC, Coingecko etc for listings. All part of Chainlizard click and build blockchains.

[09-Feb-19 07:22 PM] Regnar#6164
Another idea, again I haven't messed with chainlizard so I'm not sure if it's there already, would be selecting airdrop as a method of distribution. Pick which coin you want to airdrop to (any coin in the ecosystem), select ratio to drop, some basic things like minimum 10 coins in address, max 100k or something, and it calculates how many coins it will create to do the drop (this part is iffy and would probably be better as an estimate) and then pick the date/time/or block number to do the airdrop.

[13-Feb-19 05:22 PM] Steve Lee#1967
@Cryptoon  i've tried to push dpow to binance awhile back unsuccessfully. My assumption is that being a market leader, they would want to build value-add features and credibility in their own technical stack versus endorsing a project. If you remember back to the CZ interview on Fortune.com, he pointed out that Komodo and Tendermint would be the 'future platfoms' to succeed. I'm sure he's aware we're the leader in atomic swaps, but they chose to use tendermint to build a proxy dex. The difference being KMD is a coin listed on their exchange, and tendermint not having one. But then again he endorsed that BTT ICO nonsense. just a bit of speculation on my end.

@Regnar  Any new games should be built on another chain, but that **IS** the point of the current game, to get devs to blockchainify their games on KMD.  Pixel Dungeon seems to be the community picked candidate. I think they might look into it, they've been reached out to several times, myself included. üòâ Their community requesting it from them would be the ultimate approach. I think it would be amazing if Pixel Dungeon built their game on KMD! 
It's *my* understanding that the needed underlying tech for something like Pixel Dungeon to be made on KMD , including it being on mobile, will be finished by the end of the year. (Please do not quote me on that)

I'm still unfamiliar with all the AWS stuff lol

haha I didn't really mean about Vechain, I meant about the AWS announcement

I should clarify, I don't mean about the vechain project, but their description of what their partnership means. kinda irrelevant I guess

There are thousands of AWS partners so it could be a non-event, but here is a little info on the AWS tier program. It does say near the bottom that with the Advance partnership one of several benefits is funding.
