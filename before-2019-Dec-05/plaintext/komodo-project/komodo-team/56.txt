[26-Oct-18 09:07 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
And make a new repo that tracks the important current projects on KMD in one (sry but don't know how these github stuff works)

[26-Oct-18 09:08 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Then simply ask miso to replace the bdex with the real current kmd prjects

[26-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Audo#5667
I believe we are looking into a solution where we would track all of our repos ourselves on our website.

[26-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Regnar#6164
yea that's probably the easiest way.

[26-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Regnar#6164
cryptomiso probably does an API call to a single repo or something

[26-Oct-18 09:25 PM] Regnar#6164
doing multiple calls, and then compiling them by date would be possible, but probably a bit extra work for miso, as they'd have to do it for every coin they track

[26-Oct-18 09:26 PM] Regnar#6164
maybe afterwards we can just give cryptomiso access to our site tracking too

[26-Oct-18 09:26 PM] Steve Lee#1967
Other coins most likely aren't in the same situation as us

[26-Oct-18 09:26 PM] Regnar#6164
yea maybe.

[26-Oct-18 09:26 PM] Steve Lee#1967
we're exploring tracking this ourselves on our website update as Audo has mentioned

[26-Oct-18 09:27 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
cool thanks for the update, glad this is already being worked on üòÉ

[26-Oct-18 09:27 PM] Steve Lee#1967
What's disappointing is that I've been promoting their site to analysts, influencers, and media in all of my briefings.

[26-Oct-18 09:27 PM] Steve Lee#1967
Can no longer do that considering the lack of accuracy.

[26-Oct-18 09:29 PM] Regnar#6164
yep, that is unfortunate. Their tracking shows decentralized ICOs which obviously isn't where work is done on anything else KMD besides dICOs

[26-Oct-18 09:33 PM] actionslacks#4072
It's a bit like comparing apples and oranges at this point. Considering all the new things going on here, we could start our own commit tracking just comparing projects within this ecosystem.

[26-Oct-18 09:37 PM] Regnar#6164
Or if we simply start our own git tracking, show what we are tracking and why, and how we compiled them all to get the end result. we can set the standard for other projects to show their own work

[26-Oct-18 09:41 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Setting new standards is always tricky, because it just adds another level. I was concerned originally that when people try to find and compare coins with high activity, and look at KMD, when on crypto miso it appears as if KMD is dead, although that's not the case. Ideally we'd have something that can be visible / shared on third party sites. So when people do compare to other projects, they see that KMD is active.

[26-Oct-18 09:42 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I see activity in general in high regard. Be it wallets, transactions or in this case github commits.

[26-Oct-18 09:43 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I think more ppl do this and it would spark more interest from ppl who don't know the project yet, bring more ppl in

[26-Oct-18 09:45 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Only need to create visibility for it that can also be used by third party sites. If it was for example only on the kmd website, it would only reach ppl who are already interested in KMD and visit the site to find out more. But if we show up on comparison sites like blocktivity and also get high scores there, then this brings ppl in who haven't even looked into KMD yet

[26-Oct-18 09:47 PM] actionslacks#4072
as far as diy tracking we should also include all the outside projects using dpow

[26-Oct-18 09:48 PM] actionslacks#4072
I agree it would be nice to get an unbiased analysis from outside sites but I'm not gonna hold my breath

üëÜ when kmd address tracking

[26-Oct-18 10:11 PM] Regnar#6164
I was trying to indicate that if we track ourselves, and show exactly how/where we are tracking and why, we could see if third party sites will just mirror our tracking method.

[26-Oct-18 10:13 PM] Regnar#6164
Which means if we track a repo, we need to explain and show how that repo is related to KMD development. which right now a lot of KMD development is done through other Repos like Staked, KMDice, etc. and then there's also development that is technically third party but is on run time forks and can be brought back to KMD like Veruscoin (though this stuff shouldn't be tracked) it's a tricky situation but it's also the nature of a truly decentralized project. clarity is key

[26-Oct-18 10:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
I agree. sorry to insert my skepticism into the conversation. There are so many people doing so many things here that a complete and accurate analysis would be a task in itself. Which I think is wonderful.

[27-Oct-18 07:25 PM] Regnar#6164
Oh @actionslacks I didn't take your statement as skepticism, nor is it a bad thing if it was! haha skepticism is good in crypto! yea it's tough to get an accurate gauge of the development being done, or trusting self reporting, which is why I was saying we openly show what we are tracking and why, so others can verify it.

^good question!

[06-Nov-18 05:22 PM] Regnar#6164
@grewalsatinder  I think it's a way of sending your transparent KMD to a Z address in common lot sizes to blend with other jumblr transactions. I've never used it, but I think it could be a way to atomic swap a non anon coin like BTC, for KMD (t address), then send it to a Z address in common lot sizes (100, 10) then send back to T addresses (multiple?) and atomic swap back to BTC. so you have the same end result of N Bitcoin but with no connection from the initial purchase, to the ending wallet? not sure though
