I would like to see that CMC e.g. at Utrum indicates that it is a Komodo Assetchain and that under the BTC value the KMD value is displayed (as with erc20 the ETH value). Do you think that's possible? For what reason is it done with erc20? did CMC want it or did ETH pay for it?ü§î

It's probably just a request thing

[11-Jul-18 04:29 PM] Regnar#6164
anyone have the link to the github where you can request to add coins to barterDEX?

[11-Jul-18 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
You mean: https://github.com/jl777/coins ?

I assume jl777 owns this?

[11-Jul-18 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
I mostly just blindly approve pull requests

[11-Jul-18 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
just needs to be correct info

[11-Jul-18 04:47 PM] Regnar#6164
@jl777c I'm thinking of adding a couple of steps to this process (for marketing reasons), not to affect the ease of requests or anything.

[11-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Regnar#6164
Basically they already provide their logo (to be used on barterDEX) so we use that for the poster, and they should provide the email of their social media contact. Someone on our team, or me or whatever, would basically add their logo to a template that shows they are now supported on BarterDEX, with Komodo logos, social media handle, etc and theirs. and we provide it to their social media account holder so they can post the promotional material on their twitter, reddit, etc

[11-Jul-18 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
ok by me, just tell me when I can approve a pull request

[11-Jul-18 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
someone that is part of the process needs to give a "ready to merge" comment on each pull request, I can go with that

[11-Jul-18 04:57 PM] Regnar#6164
okay @benohanlon  @Steve Lee I'm not sure who we want to put on this part? I think we could just add an optional step in the readme that says have their social media contact email  X address. or something. in the nature of Komodo, it shouldn't be mandatory to be listed, but should be a way for mutual marketing benefits

[11-Jul-18 05:09 PM] Regnar#6164
2. Icon file (Required)
‚Ä¢    The icon file is required.
‚Ä¢    Icon must be a .png format file.
‚Ä¢    Dimensions of icon file is 82x82 pixels.
‚Ä¢    Icon file name MUST be in small letters.
‚Ä¢    Icon file location is icons directory.
‚Ä¢    Send a (XX) sized PNG file of your logo in an email to (XXX) from your social media/marketing lead‚Äôs email to receive joint marketing material upon integration (Optional)
 

I'm thinking something like this, just put in whoever is going to handle the template, adding their logos and emailing it back. This way they can still add to barterDEX (jl777 doesn't have to wait for merge approvals) and we can still get some joint marketing

[11-Jul-18 05:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
imo, if the repo gets used in any marketing way then "It must be tested and working before it will be added" needs to be in as large and bold lettering as possible

[11-Jul-18 05:13 PM] Regnar#6164
step 0 is The coin must be tested with BarterDEX atomic swaps. So by the time they are applying for it to be listed, including the marketing part in step 2, we assume they are already working right?

[11-Jul-18 05:14 PM] Regnar#6164
but yea, the receiver of the email might have to make sure they have posted the request to github, and if jl approved the merge, we can send out the email? or do we send out the email just before the approval? I don't think there is too big a difference in the order of this aspect. just as long as we don't send the email when it's not going to be listed

[11-Jul-18 05:51 PM] Regnar#6164
any of the marketing guys I tagged have thoughts on this idea?

[11-Jul-18 05:52 PM] Regnar#6164
We should be trying to get coins that we support to post joint marketing material to their social medias and channels. That will give us more more unique impressions and possibly new viewers

We've discussed doing somethinng like this before, @benohanlon had a social media plan to coordinate with all the new coins added to the DEX

[11-Jul-18 06:01 PM] Daniel CP#2020
It's a great idea to add it to github tho, would make it easy for us to reach out and contact people, rather than having to DM on Twitter or whatever

[11-Jul-18 06:04 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea I posted this back on Slack but we were updating barterDEX so frequently that it was impractical tbh. but now that we are pushing out scheduled updates with batches of coins, it seems this would be much more effective, and now that it's done through github I figured I'd just modify this plan to fit this route

@Cryptoon This convo shouldn't be in marketing, however.....
let's take 0.00001124 BTC in fees:
2016: $0.0051704 - BTC was $460
2017: $0.1850104 - BTC was $16,460
2018: $0.0692384 - BTC is $6,160
for the **same** tx fee
fee/USD **isn't** important

[12-Jul-18 10:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Till majority is switched to cryptocurrency only

[12-Jul-18 10:33 AM] benohanlon#1119
Yes @Daniel CP @Regnar I've submitted an idea to @Steve Lee where we would create a series of evergreen posts... each post focuses on one coin that BarterDEX supports with a one line description of what that coin is about + tags their community into it and uses their currency ticker.

These kind of posts can be created once and sent out once or twice a day randomly using a tool like meetedgar to help bring other communities to us and showcase how many coins are supported and educated people.

This is on hold until we have liquidity - I believe @Steve Lee concern is that we'll be pushing people onto barterdex / hyperdex and there won't be enough liquidity to allow them to buy / sell anything.

[12-Jul-18 10:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Do those same people look at their grocery receipt and determine how much the tax cost them when converted into South African Rand? No. Just because some choose to have an incorrect view of the space doesn't mean the space (and especially marketing) should change to their wrong view.

[12-Jul-18 11:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
No but for example over here, sometimes you have to pay extra when you want to pay with card

[12-Jul-18 11:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362

@Cryptoon If people start calling a rabbit a lion, should marketing also call a rabbit a lion or tell people that a rabbit isn't a lion?

@ComputerGenie you know what I mean

[12-Jul-18 11:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Sometimes it's better to explain things in a way normies understand

I can explain crypto to my mother in a way that makes me sound like an asshole and she still wont understand a thing

[12-Jul-18 11:25 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
`you know what I mean`
yes, and I also know it's dumb to let wrong people change the meaning of the space

[12-Jul-18 11:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But it's better off to explain in laymens terms and compare it to stuff they understand

[12-Jul-18 11:26 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
in this instance, it's really not; words matter

[12-Jul-18 11:28 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
on this topic, it's not just a matter of semantics, it's an entire conceptual shift

[12-Jul-18 11:31 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
for crypto to succeed, the `currency` part of `cryptocurrency` must be in the forefront; otherwise, were all just messing about with commodities and no real adoption will ever take hold

[12-Jul-18 11:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes for sure, but for example when we switched to the euro in 2000 over here, a lot of people were (and still are) calculating how much is was in the previous currency. So expect the same thing to happen even when the big shift to crypto happens. It's in the nature of people that change is hard for them and don't think you can change that.

[12-Jul-18 11:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Basically, it's hard to change that it's hard for people to change. (lol)

[12-Jul-18 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
And even harder when no one corrects their wrongness, and even harder still when their wrongness is catered to üòâ
