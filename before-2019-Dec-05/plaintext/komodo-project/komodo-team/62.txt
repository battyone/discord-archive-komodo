[14-Dec-18 08:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So we used the paper wallet data to link to the plugin.

[14-Dec-18 08:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Coinpayments has a .5 fee on the front page.  Wonder if there are other fees.

[14-Dec-18 08:04 AM] Daniel CP#2020
CoinPayments is also free and permissionless to download and install but yes, i think there is a 0.5% fee per tx.

[14-Dec-18 08:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Fiat settlement is pretty cool.

[14-Dec-18 08:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Does anyone have any feedback or experience here?

[14-Dec-18 08:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Using them?

[14-Dec-18 08:05 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I think the new plugin would be awesome if it supported a few more coins and tokens from the KMD ecosystem

[14-Dec-18 08:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Perhaps that is possible.  I hadn't thought of it.  
The dev who did it really likes Komodo and would be eager to see if it's possible.  
Who would I put him in touch with?

[14-Dec-18 08:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
He asked me when he finished if Komodo was hiring üòÇ

[14-Dec-18 08:07 AM] Daniel CP#2020
haha well if he keeps building cool stuff we might be!

[14-Dec-18 08:07 AM] Daniel CP#2020
You can ask him to get in touch with me and then I'll figure out who from the dev team can help more

[14-Dec-18 08:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Give me some ideas?  Should I just see if he can integrate a 2nd coin in for now... and go from there?

[14-Dec-18 08:08 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Which coin should he start with that would be straightforward?

[14-Dec-18 08:08 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I like your thinking.

[14-Dec-18 08:08 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Yeah seeing if integrating more ecosystem coins and tokens to the plugin would be possible a good place to start

[14-Dec-18 08:09 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Then we could add that as part of the deal when projects choose to build with Komodo

[14-Dec-18 08:09 AM] Daniel CP#2020
the marketing team is really trying to create a big list of extra benefits to building with KMD and this would be a cool one

[14-Dec-18 08:09 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Get your own customizable blockchain, then get: integration to Agama, integration to BarterDEX, integration to the WP plugin, etc

[14-Dec-18 08:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Already sent him a message.
He was very eager to take the KMD and then Pirate plugin job.   He immediately asked me if KMD was hiring. üòõ

[14-Dec-18 08:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I said just get through the job and well see.

[14-Dec-18 08:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So I asked him to add EQL, hush or Utrum to the same plugin.  Ill let you know what he says. 

He did this plugin for a different chain I worked with 8 months ago.   He is capable with this work.

[14-Dec-18 08:14 AM] Daniel CP#2020
OK all sounds great

[14-Dec-18 08:14 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Let us know what he says!

@Daniel CP no answer back yet however, the plugin could easily be modified for any KMD asset chains by anyone familiar with these things to change it to a different currency.  
They just need the paper wallet option to generate MPKs or their own wallet to have this option.

Multichain hardforking with timestamp based activation was a new development in @KomodoPlatform 
This method since worked out perfectly fine, would make it easier for future multichain hardfork upgrades possible no matter what amount of multiple blockchains there'll be.

@Mr. HashEm @Steve Lee and @Audo  must be able to answer that better.

There is already a "zmigrate" dapp made, which can be used to migrate the funds via command line from sprout z addresses (starting with "zc") to sapling z addresses (starting with "zs").
I don't know about it's GUI updates, but know somebody is doing it. Read instructions ...

[15-Dec-18 05:24 PM] Regnar#6164
@FishyGuts so the MPK from the paper wallet used in the WP plugin, does that mean all payment addresses are the same? Or can multiple addresses be created and used?

[15-Dec-18 07:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Do you mean as the shopkeeper?   I believe your payment address persists.

[15-Dec-18 07:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Regnar

[15-Dec-18 07:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Chand would know more. 

I think with Komodo using the same payment address for native coins, that it‚Äôs merely a matter of adding a dropdown menu to the plugin and the Price APIs for all that are available.

[15-Dec-18 07:59 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea I guess I'm wondering if there is a way to create new addresses for each shopper to send to, or if that would be beneficial?

[15-Dec-18 08:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Chand would know.

[16-Dec-18 01:35 AM] digital bullion#8223
Is the anouncement about a top 10 exchange endorsing DPOW and reccomending it as a service to all of its smaller chains as mentioned above like a joint press release or something?  @Daniel CP

[16-Dec-18 04:54 AM] Chand#6239
@Regnar nope! All the address generated for each order will be different

Hey, any chance we can get a place for API endpoints for different things for each of the explorers here?
<https://dexstats.info/explorers.php>

[17-Dec-18 01:01 AM] Regnar#6164
We only really have Insight and Iquidus explorers but it would be nice to have the API endpoints for each of them so when new coins get created it'll be easier to send the API end points to sites like CMC, Coinpaprika, and coingecko.

[17-Dec-18 01:04 AM] Regnar#6164
obviously adding them to the explorers themselves would be best, but should be left up to individual teams. It would be nice to have the commands in a single spot so developers/sites know what commands to use for each coin, instead of having to navigate explorers and may or may not find the API endpoint info (most of our explorers don't have the API endpoints listed)

[17-Dec-18 01:07 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm thinking something like this:
<https://liraexplorer.com/info>
Except instead of pre fill the site name, we have a drop down menu to pick a coin, and it will select the right API endpoints depending on the type of explorer we have on file. for example Iquidus explorers use /ext/getmoneysupply to get the circulating supply, but I have no idea what that end point is for Insight explorers...

[17-Dec-18 05:55 AM] CHMEX#0686
@Regnar 
http://api1.barterdexapi.net/supply.php?coin=KMD
There is also a json format:
http://api1.barterdexapi.net/supply.php?coin=KMD&format=json
( Which I need to enrich with the sprout and sapling data )
Returns the supply and works for all notatized chains. CMC coin paprika and coingecko are using it. If you need other calls let me know.

1/ Let's clear the confusions. You need to understand this is important for anyone having their KMD in Private Addresses. Agama by default doesn't use private address, Exchanges doesn't use private address. A private address is also referred as Z address. https://t.co/w00B...

@CHMEX thanks for that! I wanted to fill coingecko and coinpaprika circulating supply for EQLI so they can get their market cap calculated.

1/ Assetchains are the "runtime forks" of "komodo".
"Runtime Forks": It means all the end user need is the exact same `komodod` daemon which they use to run/sync $KMD blockchain. But using this `komodod` with different `-ac_=` parameters creates a new network/cryptocurrency

the arguments against dPoW are like saying the manufacturer of a home security system can tap into the sensors to know when there is nobody home and use the backdoors to get entrance to the house, of course it will be known that they did this and oh, they cant actually steal anything. Since this "attack" is there, it is better to just not have any security system and let anybody just smash the window and break in.
