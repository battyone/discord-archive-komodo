I've been going through their government websites and I can't honestly believe they are doing too well on their own developing a crypto

[24-Jun-18 07:23 PM] Regnar#6164
even the copyrights on the website are from 2011

[24-Jun-18 07:24 PM] Regnar#6164
As per the discussion earlier with jl and john westbrook there was a mention of "jl777: It is much simpler and simpler is much better, yes. It also costs much less per tx, a lot less, it ends up being as secure as BTC. Sort of a magic trick."

[24-Jun-18 07:25 PM] Regnar#6164
How do we come to this conclusion, that it costs much less per tx? and do we have any way of quantifying this?

[24-Jun-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the cost for ETH tx?

[24-Jun-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the scaling chains pay txfee in themselves

[24-Jun-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
0.0001 of $1 vs $5 ETH txfee

[24-Jun-18 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
seems a factor of 100x to 10000x less expensive

Bahamas Central Bank to Launch Pilot Digital Currency - ICO Talk News
The Central Bank of the Bahamas is planning to introduce a government-backed pilot digital currency, Jamaica Observer reported June 22. Speaking at the Bahamas Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference earlier this week, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of the Bah...

[24-Jun-18 07:43 PM] Regnar#6164
yea

[24-Jun-18 07:44 PM] Regnar#6164
It sounds like they were just talking about it and wanting to make it happen, but I'm not sure they have anyone approaching them to help set this up, especially anyone to the caliber of Komodo. Which is why I think a Premier Partnership would be a solid plan

[24-Jun-18 07:45 PM] Regnar#6164
Here‚Äôs my thoughts:

We approach either the head of ministry of finance directly (I provided Steve his contact information already) we will either get him or one of the gatekeepers to him (intern, secretary, etc) in order to try and get a meeting with him to present the Komodo capabilities and our proposal of how we can help build their coin.

some of the key points we should touch on:
Being a nation of islands, roughly 400,000 people. With 255,000 living in Nassau and 50,000 living in Freeport, while the rest are spread out farther, they could start with a pilot program as their own independent chain (built on Komodo) and utilizing dPoW (to give it Bitcoin level security) so they don‚Äôt have the restrictions of Ethereum transaction costs and congestions. They can set their own transaction fees (which can be thought of as sales tax or something) in which a small percent of transaction fee transfers to the governments wallet (I believe this is called Override Commission.) They currently have a 7.5% sales tax but they could offer discounts if people use the coin. This will encourage people to use crypto there (as its cheaper than paying the higher tax, assuming they are honest merchants and report). This lower tax if using crypto will actually help their program be more successful (looks good politically) and allows them to account for tax collections much more efficiently (override commission).

[24-Jun-18 07:45 PM] Regnar#6164
The government could simply do the accounting for all the wallet transaction fees and use those funds to sell on the open market and pay for other things if they choose, or they can pay for redistribute it back to the wallet address via airdrop for whatever reason they deem necessary.
And if they are ready to scale, hopefully our scaling solutions will be ready, and show the burn protocol to combat inflation when people move island to island. There also exists the ability for them to provide a measure of QE if they deem its needed in the future (not a huge fan of it, but the option exists).

They could even offer a period of greater tax benefits or discounts to tourists who use the currency.

[24-Jun-18 07:46 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
if someone can bribe the Bahamas central bank to use Kmd, I will donate Bahamas 100k kmd of my own üòÜ

[24-Jun-18 07:47 PM] Regnar#6164
^haha I don't have that much KMD :/ I'm a pauper

[24-Jun-18 07:47 PM] Regnar#6164
but I'm not saying to use KMD

[24-Jun-18 07:47 PM] Regnar#6164
They likely want their own currency so they can control it. That's what governments do, control stuff.

[24-Jun-18 07:48 PM] Regnar#6164
or.. you know, like to try and control stuff

[24-Jun-18 07:48 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
exactly, not sure that assetchains with zsnark suits them

[24-Jun-18 07:48 PM] Regnar#6164
they don't need Zksnarks

[24-Jun-18 07:48 PM] Regnar#6164
then again maybe they do

[24-Jun-18 07:49 PM] Regnar#6164
I saw they got in trouble with some conflict of interest/fraud stuff a few years back

[24-Jun-18 07:50 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

@KomodoWorld what do you think? any ideas on how to pitch blockchain to governments haha

[24-Jun-18 07:57 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I've really no experience in that. I would use the stick&carrot approach: blackmail + bribe üòÜ

[24-Jun-18 07:57 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
ahah

[24-Jun-18 07:58 PM] Regnar#6164
I figured they'd like the visibility, the trail of accounts, the override commission which is basically automated sales tax collection, and the looking cutting edge

[24-Jun-18 07:59 PM] Regnar#6164
haha government is an interesting beast. It's made up of people, and those people have incentives to perform certain ways. By that I mean no "successful" politician has ever been thought of as such because they didn't make changes (good or bad)

[24-Jun-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
zksnarks allows to collect "contributions" with privacy

[24-Jun-18 07:59 PM] Regnar#6164
are we talking about campaign contributions? haha

[24-Jun-18 08:01 PM] Regnar#6164
What I mean to say is, selling to a government has very little to do with selling to a government, as it does to selling to the people who's incentive is to stay in their position by making changes and "progress"

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[24-Jun-18 08:03 PM] Regnar#6164
If a politician makes no new changes, the people generally think they are doing nothing (even if nothing is the right answer) and their political careers will be short lived. So proposing a solution to something you (finance minister of Bahamas) mentioned, and a partnership to implement it, also with political consulting included, such as the use of override commission for tax purposes, favorable exchange rates with the USD and other top tourist countries etc. would be beneficial

[24-Jun-18 08:05 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
seriously, first thing I would enquire who is the leading tech guy researching this stuff for the Bahamas gov, then approach him via Linkedin or other channels, ask how it's going, what bottlenecks have been found and pitch the advantages of using kmd if it suits their purpose

[24-Jun-18 08:05 PM] Regnar#6164
It's basically saying "hey you promised something that might have been over your head to do yourself, pay for the R&D, implement, etc. but we at Komodo have done all this for you, and would love to help you set it up so that you can deliver on your promise to your people"

[24-Jun-18 08:06 PM] Regnar#6164
I've been searching their website for who their tech guys are, I'm pretty sure they have an IT ministry but this website looks like it was set up on geocities

[24-Jun-18 08:06 PM] Regnar#6164
I definitely like the linked in approach

[24-Jun-18 08:07 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
certainly the ministry is following the advice of their tech expert

[24-Jun-18 08:07 PM] Regnar#6164
in a logical world, yea.

[24-Jun-18 08:07 PM] Regnar#6164
haha I think that's probably the best bet though, going through the tech guys instead of a "gatekeeper" in his office

[24-Jun-18 08:08 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think so, the financial ministry himself has almost certainly no clue of this stuff

[24-Jun-18 08:08 PM] Regnar#6164
yea, also should see if there is a tech heavy university there

@jl777c I believe kind of "banking app" is a must in that case to make it smooth. By banking app I mean sth like in online banking where you can schedule payments / outgoing transfers with 2FA + you can set up 3rd party (not necessary a bank - might be your friend)  as someone who double secures your actions or settings changes / by smart contracts?).  I was thinking to go mainstream people need some kind of "passphrase/settings reset" which might be achieved maybe thanks to smart contracts and setting up some dependiecies 3rd parties who secures your money? BAnking then will switch to creating this security/backing up clients and even obtaining insurance maybe ... I'm thinking from user perspective, people not ready / not really aware security here is even more important, as you all your money are digital - if lost you have no money. Currently it's easier - if uou have these papers with numbers (and you live in US) in your wallet a hacker from Brazil will not take those papers from you.

[25-Jun-18 06:26 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
So actually any gov will abandon this project after realising people not ready / loosing money. At least national bank must be able to easy back it up somehow... To reset/restore keys (or other possibility of transfering account balance) when someone will come with ID to prove identity or sth like that.

How to prevent hacking may be most tricky. Separate token device might be useful. I personally do not use banking on cellphone. So my cellphone is a separate token. But most people use cellphones as primary + token, 2 in 1 which I consider not safe.

[25-Jun-18 06:29 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Cellphone wallet is a must nowadays, so might be a small token device is needed?

Think of the blockchain as a word processor that can write any document you want. Not having any specific document just means you need to write it, doesnt mean that the word processor cant create it. [replace "word processor" with "blockchain" and "document" with "transaction"] I (we) cant possibly write all the possible documents that might ever be desired by anyone. For now, we create the general purpose word processor and write custom documents when there is a big customer
