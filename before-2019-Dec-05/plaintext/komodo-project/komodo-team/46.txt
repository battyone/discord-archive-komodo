@shnu , the team is busy with a lot of other projects, but we'll see if any of our current documentation efforts can be leveraged for submission

"many coins are approaching Komodo about adding 51%/consensus attack prevention, exchanges are requiring it " - this is great news

@brucefenton You are part of an organization called "Bitcoin Foundation" so, I would like to know why you don't say anything about @KomodoPlatform's dPoW mechanism which is directly related and beneficial to #bitcoin?

We look forward to hearing what you have to say.

I read that paris-saint-german team wants to launch its own token. They partner with a firm called Socios that plans to tokenize soccer teams. Socios is partner for the technical part with a project called ChiliZ that wants to use Ethereum to build this tokenization platform for sport teams: https://twitter.com/chiliZ?s=09 
This seems another project going to migrate to KMD in due time. I'm still on vacation but try to shill when I return

Konichiwa good people. Infographic question, I was wondering what do you mean by "social media friendly cover image" cause the sizes vary.. Is it ok to submit 1500x500 Twitter cover as a pitch and then adjust for insta, fb etc if needed?

So many friends are playing this fantasy "American" football league. I'm amazed at the level of dedication to this. 

It's got me thinking. How cool would it be if we started a "Komodo Fantasy League" asset chain. It could be a good opportunity to advertise Komodo brand, onboard new users, show off some crypto conditions, build team spirit, and gambling.
I'm betting that this could be mostly built from the existing CC rpc.
With oracle's it could take the shape of a crypto league, your chosen team of crypto vs another using metrics from say CMC to determine the winner. It could be any sport? The league could take the shape of anything goes, teams could be consisting of weather patterns, YouTube video game players, Trump tweets, stock markets, elections, comic book characters, etc, or even leagues vs other leagues.  
Just a fun seed I wanted to plant.

It wouldn’t be hard to make an esport betting platform right? Many people still using game skins to bet since they can’t directly use cash, but a decentralised betting platform with kmd (which already has value) would work right? 😮

[12-Sep-18 09:59 PM] joe2x4#5987
Did I mention that it could be a K Pop fantasy league. Not sure if that is a thing. Yet!

[13-Sep-18 06:13 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes a fantasy league would be possible with smart contract tech in development

[13-Sep-18 12:10 PM] shnu#0359
Does it make sense for Komodo team to buy back its own KMD, as a campaign to show undervaluation?

[13-Sep-18 01:13 PM] DangerousFELLA#0674
@shnu why do buy back?it is cryptos & not buy back program..

[13-Sep-18 01:26 PM] shnu#0359
@DangerousFELLA 😃 is your argument that buy back can't be done in crypto?

[13-Sep-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
is it worth reducing the number of years of dPoW that can be funded?

[13-Sep-18 01:44 PM] shnu#0359
Fund it in KMD. Don't you see a rise in value for KMD?

[13-Sep-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, we can make a donation address for people to send in KMD for a buyback of KMD?

[13-Sep-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
to do that we would need to sell the KMD so we can buy it back

[13-Sep-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
also I dont expect a lot of donations would come in

[13-Sep-18 01:48 PM] shnu#0359
Why donations?

[13-Sep-18 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
we dont have any funds allocated for buybacks

[13-Sep-18 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
remember, KMD is an open source community, not a corporation

[13-Sep-18 01:49 PM] shnu#0359
So dPoW is funded by BTC?

[13-Sep-18 01:53 PM] shnu#0359
Open source community with a CEO/CTO/CMO.. 
In my opinion, Komodo Platform should fund dPoW through KMD.

[13-Sep-18 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
how to convince the bitcoin blockchain to accept KMD?

[13-Sep-18 01:56 PM] shnu#0359
Clearly, I have no idea.

[13-Sep-18 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
we notarize to the BTC blockchain, that requires bitcoin. there is no other way

[13-Sep-18 01:57 PM] shnu#0359
Is the cost in BTC fixed, to notarize?

[13-Sep-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC txfees are variable, remember last year?

[13-Sep-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
for now it is stable, but it can and has changed

[13-Sep-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
to me it is more important to have a longer dPoW reserves than to do some market support. If the market says the price is X, who am I to argue with it

Best to ask in #ask-jl777 but I think they helped with some stuff or joined in their ico

[13-Sep-18 07:50 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Seko sys was one of the core coins when Komodo was still the Supernet project

[13-Sep-18 07:51 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
