okay, I'll try this tonight hopefully. got to go to class

We need a bot developer to connect to http://riot.im, Discord and Slack that will auto curate all messages from jl777 and a human editor to keep them clean and assign tag.
apart from that, i see only manual way.

[11-Jun-18 12:10 PM] regnar#0000
haha I'll do my best. but I need to get ready for the day. later

<@U9K42AHQW> I know <@U6ZES59AA> is looking at the website - it is being considered.

[11-Jun-18 12:11 PM] stephenyork#0000
if you have information architecture in place for this, that's great! <@U6ZR6LU4F>

<@U4X7GDWT0> I'd love to see you work with Crypto Rich on this as it's a video we could have at the top... can you DM me an email and I'll introduce?

the bot control interface we've got can filter by user i believe, so we can get a daily digest of jl777 stuff

jl777 discussed scaling solutions, privacy, and notary nodes for @KomodoPlatform on @telegram today. Definitely an awesome read, check it out!

discord is primary interface the bot dev has focussed.  twitter added today.  telegram is another channel that is connected but unused.  slack works but he's not doing too much work on it.

[11-Jun-18 12:21 PM] imylomylo#0000
nice.  there's a bunch of stuff on internal docs <@U9LBB4CTG> and i have been c+p from time to time that can be grouped into these collections/vision of the project

[11-Jun-18 12:27 PM] shossain#0000
jl777 doesn't use twitter. if we have all the public channels cross-connected to discord and @discord-bot filter out all the posts from all public channels and put them into a dedicated channel, an admin user can filter out the informative one, we can perhaps link that channel to the http://komodoplatform.com site using a page

yep, current version doesn't quite have an export facility (like csv or json) atm, but this can be requested.
sounds good.

It seems KMD needs to emphasize the privacy aspect of the coin and network. Under marketed I think in that regard.

[12-Jun-18 08:11 PM] Steve Lee#1967

Hey guys! Question for the Komodo team! I'm on the team over at CCI, and we wanted to know if you all would be interested in a video interview to get your project out to about 450k investors

and i'm also curious about komodo 2.0

[17-Jun-18 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Regnar> just a thought, we should have a page on dexstats that shows a list of all coins that are built on Komodo and/or using dPoW. Many of the dICO coins would be on it but GameCredits, Verus, and Kreds too. This page could be linked to from the main http://Komodoplatform.com. or could even be a page on http://Komodoplatform.com that shows the coins using dPoW for 51% protection, as well as a link to whatever announcement page they have explaining their reasons for selecting KMD.

[17-Jun-18 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Regnar> and on the dPoW/Komodo Security Services/51% protection page we could have some options for how other projects could get these features, either by integrating dPoW like Gamecredits (slower) or by migrating to Komodo (preferred)

[17-Jun-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Regnar> thoughts?

[17-Jun-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> James already asked to wait on this, as i remember.

[17-Jun-18 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Regnar> okay.

[17-Jun-18 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Regnar> yea I know the whole adding dpow to existing coins is a difficult process

[17-Jun-18 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> Once there's experience, it will become easier and easier.

[17-Jun-18 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Regnar> and migration is preferred. I think advertising it would be effective.

[17-Jun-18 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[slack] <CrypToon> (I might have already asked this question, forgive me if I did)

[18-Jun-18 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CHMEX> Yes it's something I would like to complete soon also for crypto currently it's a bit tricky to get the balance for notarizations as the explorers to not handle the uxtos properly ( my guess )
for Dex the initial holdings need to be subtracted. There is a meeting this week in neuchatel I hope we have some fruitful conversations there

@KomodoWorld  i don't think DSEC is launched by the KMD platform

[19-Jun-18 11:53 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
my impression is that it's a closely related thing

how could I phrase it better? I can add it's a decentralized group, closely collaborating with but independent
