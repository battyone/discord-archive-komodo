We are however shifting to focus more on creating a better developer community program, along with renewed focus on how we educate, train, and attract more developers to Komodo.

As cool as ‚ÄúJumblr‚Äù is, maybe it deserves to be put on the cutting room floor (marketing wise) like as a DVD  bonus feature. As legitimate of a tool as it is, I don‚Äôt think it clicks with mainstream users. There are so many features to promote, not every amazing one needs to be in the forefront.

[18-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Steve Lee#1967
We've been positioning Komodo as having "a hybrid approach to privacy" - Optional zk-snarks/priv tx (jumblr) along with permission-less and permissioned blockchains

so is KMD falling into the category of "security token" or "currency & commodities" ?

[18-Jul-18 09:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Currency

[19-Jul-18 01:18 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Kmd is much akin to ethereum especially on it's initial distribution.

Digital Price coin is pretty cheap currently (needed for voting) and if we can get a lot of kmd ecosystem coins listed and get KMD base pair. It's a win win for DP and KMD

[19-Jul-18 08:48 AM] Mylo#8306
where'd you hear that @Gordon Komodo ?

[19-Jul-18 10:27 AM] Regnar#6164
That prism model is becoming quite popular it seems, I'm pretty sure that's how Abra works too, which is why many coins on abra you cannot withdraw from the wallet.

[19-Jul-18 11:41 AM] Regnar#6164
It's really a derivative I'd say, you're trading on the coin and portfolio valuation and not necessarily trading the coins themselves. so the volume there does nothing for the volume anywhere else, but it's good to get Komodo logo and idea in front of people.

[19-Jul-18 11:44 AM] Regnar#6164
I also don't think I'd want to be Prism in this case, this whole model exposes them to some insane potential losses. If they hold ETH in contract and allow you to trade against it, any of the gains must be made up from losses elsewhere (either individual portfolios) or their own. Think if you put in ETH, "buy" bitcoin and bitcoin goes back to 20k and you cash out, you have just about tripled your ETH holdings (assuming ETH didn't grow proportionally)...now imagine thousands of people did that. All that extra ETH has to come from somewhere

so Sandy is the main dev and CEO of the project. He seems to be opened to the idea. So what I see is that since his project is on Ethererum , Nxt and Ardor. And if he decides to build on KMD asset chain as well. This will be the best opportunity for a project to have a live comparison of the four platforms.

Cool article - great to see higher throughput from EOS.

TPS record was set by Komodo in May 2018 at 20k tps, data here https://komodostats.com/sca...

And description here: https://i.mylomylo.com/komo...

KMD news article about the method https://komodoplatform.com/...

And a more recent load test: https://en.insider.pro/info... with infographic https://insdrcdn.com/media/...

Komodo will post all details for download and verifiability throughout further testing.

Any details please ask Mylo in the KMD discord (#scaling-test) for further details. We will continue to optimise KMD scaling solutions to 1 million tps.

Cheers

@Mylo  good comment. I would call it more aggressive marketing (contacting 3rd parties co-working with competing solutions to check out KMD for comparison). Might be good if marketing team monitors competing solutions for their partners and emails them with comparison to KMD about the key part for selected 3rd party. Full time for 1 person should be enough to "steal" some partners from time to time üòÉ

[22-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Mylo#8306
i don't mind starting a website that rebutts all these things to highlight KMDs advantages - if the community finds sites claiming things that are not and i can republish things from komodo's perspective that are justified and true - then let's do it.

As part of the Komodo Pioneers notary election, we encourage ppl to start meetups.  Because I'm least likely to participate in meetup activities, I threw the idea of a komodo ecosystem website https://imgur.com/a/n7qG2 (this is the mockup).

If the community wants some way to republish information, i can work towards iKomodo being a community site.  I've got the ways of getting accurate information required through dev/marketing/community here - just need to work on the publishing model.  And once someone works out how (and shares how) to IPFS host  (decentralized web) something like this, then ikomodo doesn't have to be the centralized point of accuracy.

There's reddit.com/r/ikomodo we can use, it's private at the moment but if this is a direction the community marketing wants to go - let's do it.

Need 10 KMD emojis and we start.

I like that idea @Mylo .

I would like to link that website with Komodo forum, meaning that you could submit articles there by making a new thread on the forum (published with forum name). Then that website can just make the formatting more pretty than the forum itself.

The comments can appear on both, the blogging website and the forum, i.e. interoperable comments. I have seen that on few other websites, so it should be possible.
