[29-Jul-18 05:47 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so no MN?

[29-Jul-18 05:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah exactly, if we can add it I guess we should.

that was my opinion.

[29-Jul-18 05:49 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the *ability* to add something should never outweigh the implications of adding it or the direction it would take certain things

[29-Jul-18 05:51 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm not sure I understand you here Genie?

[29-Jul-18 05:51 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
It's all about perspective @ComputerGenie  üòâ

[29-Jul-18 05:52 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so i think  it's comparable to spend money on ASIC, or spend money buying coin to stake on masternode

[29-Jul-18 05:52 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
both are pretty much passive

[29-Jul-18 05:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@WhiteWidow  `Today at 12:51 PM
It's all about perspective`
That's my point, some have a "vision" of what Komodo "is" (be they on the inside looking out or the outside looking in) and things done can change *how* they view the future
A feature **could** be added to telly you to "Go fek off you broke bastid" if you have "insufficient funds" to make a transfer; however, that doesn't mean that it **should** be added

[29-Jul-18 05:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Major protocol changes are no different

[29-Jul-18 05:56 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Gordon Komodo I'm not sure an $850 ASIC compares to a $16,000-50,000 MN

[29-Jul-18 05:56 PM] Regnar#6164
But we're talking about coins building off of Komodo aren't we?

[29-Jul-18 05:56 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@ComputerGenie so set the MN to $850 a piece üòÑ

[29-Jul-18 05:57 PM] Regnar#6164
in which case, why should we have any say in how those coin teams, investors, or adopters, set up their chain?

[29-Jul-18 05:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Regnar because, consensus?

[29-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Regnar#6164
Develop without Limitations
Enjoy the benefits of your own independent chain with zero dependencies or commitments to the Komodo main chain.

[29-Jul-18 06:00 PM] Regnar#6164
Isn't consensus met by the adoption of a coin by its community, fully knowing masternodes are part of the project?

[29-Jul-18 06:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Gordon Komodo tbh, I'd actually be in favor of a MN system with a flat permanent cost that didn't cost $5 for people that found it on day 1 and $10k for anyone that never heard of it until 6+ months later after it hit an exchange and mooned

[29-Jul-18 06:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Regnar `Today at 1:00 PM

I mean that, imo, there should be a consensus of even adding the consensus mechanism for MN consensus (sounds circular, but it's realy not)

[29-Jul-18 06:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`Today at 12:59 PM

There's nothing stopping a dev from adding it on their own (development)

[29-Jul-18 06:05 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
that could be a feature on the masternode

[29-Jul-18 06:06 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
a selling point

[29-Jul-18 06:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'd imagine that if CoinX wanted to both be part of the platform **and** develop good code for a MN system that jl wouldn't be completely opposed to a PullRequest that implemented it well and safely

[29-Jul-18 06:09 PM] Regnar#6164
So I guess it comes down to this here, do we as the marketing team, reach out to MN communities in order to spend our time and efforts to convince them to change their coin design (potentially losing their adopters) because we don't support MN and want more projects to migrate?

Do we reach out to them and offer half baked services and see if they want to spend their own effort to design the MN system that works with KMD AC?

Do we ignore these communities and focus only on those coins that are consistent with the AC structures we can provide?

Real question btw.

[29-Jul-18 06:15 PM] Regnar#6164
Notice I didn't say should we add MN capabilities in house, seeing as that doesn't appear to be something we want to work on.

[29-Jul-18 06:15 PM] Regnar#6164
which isn't a problem, just trying to get marketing/migration focused in on

[29-Jul-18 06:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I can't see any way where I'd consider any solution Komodo has to offer as "half baked"; however, the reality is that dev only goes so far so fast. *Someone* has to dev  anything to be added.
The real question is:
Do you want to over-burden dev just to have a "good marketing plan/campaign" for those that currently have a differing structure than Komodo offers?

[29-Jul-18 06:17 PM] Regnar#6164
Perhaps that was the wrong word choice? I didn't mean it insultingly, just in that we can offer blockchain services, but if we are offering them to a specific group (MN communities) and we don't offer the MN parts...

[29-Jul-18 06:17 PM] Regnar#6164
So it comes down to how do we engage with MN communities about migration, or don't we?

@Gordon Komodo what do you think?

If Magna is anything to go by, anything but a pure conversion is going to make some MN folks pissy

[29-Jul-18 06:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and all they did was add a 2nd coin üòï

[29-Jul-18 06:22 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm not too familiar on Magna conversion, but that's the point I'm trying to make. Do we ignore these communities because we don't have the MN solution their investors and adopters want, which is why they invested in those projects? or do we approach this differently.

[29-Jul-18 06:23 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm personally in the camp that we shouldn't focus on MN communities right now. until we have a solution they will actually want.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[29-Jul-18 06:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
imo, the best solution would be to find a few MN oriented devs and see if they would be interested in doing the work. Like I said before, the code will not just appear out of thin air, someone's gotta do it and there's plenty of existing Komodo irons in the fire as it is

[29-Jul-18 06:25 PM] Regnar#6164
Agreed

[29-Jul-18 06:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know a dev who said he would do it.

[29-Jul-18 06:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
a != a few

[29-Jul-18 06:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
He already ported very basic (rewards only) MN to zcash fork.

[29-Jul-18 06:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am sure hes more than capable, but it needs to be placed into an -ac_mn= parameter

[29-Jul-18 06:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
likely would be more than 1 even. To defin rewards/eras

[29-Jul-18 06:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
a fixed value is usless

[29-Jul-18 06:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
but will he support that code in perpetuity?

[29-Jul-18 06:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Probably not, it was something another community member came to me about asking if it was possible, so I asked this guy, and he said he would port MN for us.  But it was just port MN, discussion never went any further.

[29-Jul-18 06:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
He did say he would do it though, but was busy at that exact time with other work.

[29-Jul-18 06:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`Probably not` And therein lies my whole point

[29-Jul-18 06:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you add params, that define rewards... why does it need support in the code.

[29-Jul-18 06:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once it works it works... its inside an `if`

[29-Jul-18 06:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seperate to everythign else

[29-Jul-18 06:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
because what happens when FeatureX is added and it breaks MNy? current overworked dev is now stuck doing *more* work

[29-Jul-18 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the rewards CC seems to do what the MN does for paying rewards to locked coins

[29-Jul-18 06:32 PM] Regnar#6164
It's also possible the MN would bring in more MN projects and therefore more MN devs?

yes and most of what people want from masternodes

[30-Jul-18 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
which is the ability to earn rewards by locking coins. APR and mindeposit are configurable per rewards plan (there can be many active at any given time), even the required holding period

[30-Jul-18 12:54 PM] Regnar#6164
I've been trying to figure out the true difference in MN and just regular PoS to try and understand this better, but it looks like MN are just PoS but only if a staking wallet has a certain amount (minimum) of coins in it?

[30-Jul-18 12:55 PM] yorklab#7270
Well even Agama needs a minimum amount.

[30-Jul-18 12:55 PM] Regnar#6164
Kind of reminds me, at least reward side, of KMD rewards, obviously they function differently (MN are full nodes etc)

[30-Jul-18 12:56 PM] Regnar#6164
yea that's what I was thinking

[30-Jul-18 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
rewards CC allows to create a MN-like rewards program

[30-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea that's what it sounds like. I'll have to read up on it

@benohanlon @Audo Hi Guys Jp asked me to connect with you regarding the business Expo at London Excel

[30-Jul-18 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Regnar in many MN systems, not only are MN a staking setup but they also get a "stipend" out of the blocks created by others

[30-Jul-18 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
akin to Founders Fee in ZEC

[30-Jul-18 02:26 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I also found a MN variation where the MNs must be voted in position by the rest of holders, beside having the amount required, with max 99 spots available

[30-Jul-18 02:58 PM] Regnar#6164
^yea the max amount I think I've seen before.

[30-Jul-18 04:08 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
hey, I was wondering if a bunch of us emailing exmo to request listing of KMD , It might increase the chance of them implementing it? I did it a few days ago and they said they have forwarded my wish to their management. So here is their contact for those who wants to : https://exmo.com/en/contacts

I personally think the Website needs a serious overhaul.

I have a large position in this company as I think ‚Äî in time ‚Äî it‚Äôll do well. How will you (Komodo) let the world know you‚Äôre better than ETH? You are, now let the world know.

Yes, website getting some love - I think you're in the majority there!  Yes, CTAs (call to actions) - see something KMD can do, use it - for whatever purpose/demographic and one of the 5 pillars of a blockchain ecosystem we are working on is _simplicity_.  Security, scalability, interoperability & privacy KMD is great at.  Simplicity - we are working on getting the tech into more peoples hands - across different desirable markets.
