@Daniel CP sir good day can i still edit my post in reddit?

[02-Oct-18 11:10 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Technically, edits are not allowed past the deadline. The Komodo marketing team has already started reviewing submissions

[02-Oct-18 11:11 AM] Daniel CP#2020
With that said, a few very minor changes to text are OK

[02-Oct-18 11:11 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Major revisions are not allowed

[02-Oct-18 11:12 AM] Daniel CP#2020
But if you've noticed a typo or want to adjust the text a little bit, that's fine @jon008

[02-Oct-18 11:27 AM] jon008#5899
@Daniel CP ok sir thank you i made a post in reddit i hope team will consider thank you. i forgot to upload the image directly in reddit instead i upload it in imagebb and make a text post.

[02-Oct-18 11:49 AM] DesignBlock#0184
@Daniel CP can the edits be traced? Also I have notice many late submissions..

[02-Oct-18 11:50 AM] DesignBlock#0184
@Daniel CP oh yes, ive tried editing because of typo.. still original image appears on thumbnail picture..

[02-Oct-18 11:50 AM] Daniel CP#2020
@DesignBlock the submissions aren't late, they are just now being accepted and approved

[02-Oct-18 11:51 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We will download all submissions and save them locally. I will do this now

[02-Oct-18 11:51 AM] Daniel CP#2020
And those will be reviewed by the team

[02-Oct-18 11:51 AM] DesignBlock#0184
So the date reglecting on reddit in when the admins approve their post?

[02-Oct-18 11:51 AM] Daniel CP#2020
So if you've got changes to make, please make them now

[02-Oct-18 11:52 AM] DesignBlock#0184
@Daniel CP beware of major edits also, to be fair :)

[02-Oct-18 11:52 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We're handling it, don't worry too much about this

[02-Oct-18 11:52 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Just make your edits and we'll take care of the rest

[02-Oct-18 11:53 AM] DesignBlock#0184

Some feedback on the crypto class interview.  It‚Äôs cool to get exposure but I could barely understand a word of what they were asking.  Terrible quality of their mics and overall audio quality.  Would love to see a higher quality feature/interview for Komodo, would help it promote itself much more professionally.

[03-Oct-18 02:42 PM] jon008#5899
