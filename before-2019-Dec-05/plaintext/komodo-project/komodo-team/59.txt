Hi there. I was wanting to speak with someone about a piece of research that Vleppo has concluded on Komodo along with a video interview with Ben Fairbank. Am seeking approval to post this content in Komodo's telegram channel as this information may be of significant value to your community (and obviously don't want to just randomly dump this into any of your channels without permission)

[21-Nov-18 09:21 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
If it's relevant you can post it ,  if it's a sales pitch probably shouldn't

I don't use Bitcointalk as much anymore, but did notice that there is no link to the Bitcointalk ANN page under the "Get Social" links on the Komodo website.
Many of the uninitiated think Komodo (KMD) is a simple privacy coin; this is the title of the Bitcointalk ANN page: ‚ÄúANN][KMD][dPoW] Komodo - Zcash Zero Knowledge Privacy Secured by Bitcoin"
If this was my first visit to that Bitcointalk page I would think it's just another privacy coin too.

Rebrands take time. If this was just a visual upgrade it could be done in a month or two, but it is a lot bigger than that.

At the very root of our discussions is that "komodo is not a platform" and how we position that story. We want to reintroduce Komodo in a new light so that everyone understands the scope and potential of our technology.

[26-Nov-18 02:37 AM] Regnar#6164
just looking at it though, I don't recall KMD having a soft or hard cap. Pre-sale, maybe BTCD counts? the base/quote public sale amounts could probably be updated, accepting currencies could be (btc and btcd?) definitely the ICO start and end dates, bounty detail URL (probably bitcoin talk thread?), amount for sale (denominated in KMD?), KYC required should be False. Anyone else know the answers better for these?

 some coins uses convertion to Usd rates for the ico:
quotes public sale currency: USD
Base pub sale currency: (minimum purchase size possible) 1
Quote pub sale amount: (price of minimum purchase size) (1.9m usd/amount of kmd sold, even if it a really raw calculation) 
,  accepting currencies btc btcd.

[27-Nov-18 01:21 PM] Regnar#6164
It may be already addressed in the rebrand site but if not here's some thoughts:
The Technology/Overview section on the page should have buttons/links after each section that acts as a CTA that either links to appropriate page or contact form. So Security should have button like "Secure my Chain" that links to the security service section, and so on.

Also things like Interoperability, Adaptability, and Scalability should have maybe two CTA buttons like "Make your project scalable" or "Get Started" which lead to "Blockchain Starter Kit" for the new projects and another page that is made for already built projects. I think the "Starter Kit" makes sense for new projects but if we are to help active projects scale, we want them to migrate, so another section under Developer Portal or Solutions should be something called "Blockchain Migration Kit" which is more inviting for active projects who might see "starter kit" and be turned off by the idea of "starting over". The migration kit could show specific features that help them do this. These might be about Atomic Swaps specifically to bring ERC20 or other chain to Komodo etc.

Thoughts?

[27-Nov-18 02:34 PM] Audo#5667
Yes true,

http://komodoplatform.com/technology/ should have a CTA at the end

I've seen this post around, Cosmos and Polkadot are the projects somewhat closer to Komodo architecture

1. Is there one global order of blocks or is relative ordering sequencing only done on as needed basis?
2. How are state changes authorized?
3. How do you exchange state between chains?
4. How do you protect the soundness of the system against invalid state transitions?
5. How do ensure data is available?
6. How does it prevent forks/halts?
7. Expected number of blockchains in the ecosystem?

Vertcoin was 51% attacked, a very deep reorg (300blocks from what I've read) <https://medium.com/@mwnesbitt/vertcoin-vtc-is-currently-being-51-attacked-53ab633c08a4>

I noticed in the reddit thread they believed dPoW was delegating their consensus to a 3rd party chain. and "Except the Komodo nodes have the ability to veto a chain with more work on it"

[03-Dec-18 09:39 PM] Regnar#6164
so looks like dPoW marketing needs to be clearer lol

What is your preferred wallet? Not necessarily Hot/Cold, just the platform you prefer to use, or WANT to use more in the future?
