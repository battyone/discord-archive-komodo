personally, I find it extremely disheartening how it went from "everyone" trying to make an example product that would blow people's minds to "how can I get mine?"

In 6 months, we'll see the fruits of our labour and be able to look back.

Not sure your 250 coin community paying a GUI 2000 usd is accurate , you need  volume at least , to many exchanges out there already listing @siu - Chainmakers

[08-Oct-19 02:27 PM] mobipoi#5774
I agree with attaining volume first, then the rest it easy

[08-Oct-19 02:28 PM] mobipoi#5774
It like charging customers to get into a supermarket

[08-Oct-19 02:31 PM] mobipoi#5774
Or better yet charging traders and merchants to setup a stall before you have created a footfall of customers , traders would rather pay for a stall at a place with higher volume of people

[08-Oct-19 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Get some decent volume for some big name coins and people will be begging to pay *only* 2000 usd

[08-Oct-19 02:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if you see coins paying 2-3btc easy for some crap exchange where volume dies down after a few weeks/months 2k is peanuts

[08-Oct-19 02:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and you get to claim you are atomic swap capable ;p

[08-Oct-19 03:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the thing about volume in atomic dex is that its shared among GUIs

[08-Oct-19 03:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so i dont have to look for volume for "my exchange" but for the network itself.

@PTYX didn't you also want to make a GUI for atomicdex?

[08-Oct-19 05:25 PM] PTYX#6840
We're working on the Chameleon Dex but have a few other contracts that are prioritized. It will likely be available once the dex comes out of beta

[08-Oct-19 05:25 PM] jorian#4555
great

[08-Oct-19 05:26 PM] jorian#4555
is it similar to atomicdex?

[08-Oct-19 05:26 PM] PTYX#6840
Similar yeah, the atomicdex is becoming very polished and there's only a few things I'd change

[08-Oct-19 05:27 PM] PTYX#6840
It will be integrated into Chameleon Pay

[08-Oct-19 05:30 PM] jorian#4555
mobile only?

[08-Oct-19 05:31 PM] willofleo#7505
@siu - Chainmakers listing fee will be a zero sum game then as all GUIs will have to compete to earn their listing fees (or price) , to allow coins to access the liquidity pool which is where the value comes from

[08-Oct-19 05:34 PM] willofleo#7505
which is good competition is great in a free market albeit  first mover will get the listing advantage (first proper GUI , on mm2 I am assuming atomicdex)

[08-Oct-19 05:37 PM] willofleo#7505
which is already playing out atomicdex is asking around 6500 usd and chainmaker is asking 2000 usd (~300% discount)

[08-Oct-19 07:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
66% discount

[08-Oct-19 07:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
(Sorry I’m a sucker for these kinds of things 😃 )

_forks hyperdex, charges $200 USD per, and adds coins on the 1st & 15th of each month_

[08-Oct-19 08:00 PM] PTYX#6840
@jorian mobile only and possibly a web version for dex only.

The thing about adding coins is that you will have to not just work to place some lines of code and test, you will also have a community that will use your app and will require support.

[09-Oct-19 11:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I know there could be better ideas for revenue streams but right now i dont know anything else other than asking for donations or placing a gui fee . At this point in time i dont see any other way to sustain the development. Unless komodo rises in price and NN are enough to sustain it.

[09-Oct-19 11:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
At 60 cents, nn earnings are mostly non existant.

[09-Oct-19 11:55 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
If only there was a multi billion dollar project that was looking to hire us to consult integrate and manage

[09-Oct-19 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I know there could be better ideas for revenue streams but right now...`
imo, literally the problem with the "new" direction... "revenue" is thought one of all things, even over utility

[09-Oct-19 11:56 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Right ... Heheh i see what you are doing there @polycryptoblog  😁

900 bajillion separate projects all working on the same thing and the total sum is that it's less usable than it was 20 months ago when the community was working as one
just my 2 cents

[09-Oct-19 12:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i find mm2 and the guis and tuis being built all really useful

[09-Oct-19 12:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I do see a jump in ease of use and performance from old barterdex

[09-Oct-19 12:02 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Matching utxos for trades was nightmarish in mm1 for us less technically skilled

[09-Oct-19 12:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not saying that having options isn't good
I'm saying that it was better when a body could hear about it, come into slack, and in 5 minutes make a trade

[09-Oct-19 12:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also, i have a real life business, family, wife and real life responsabilities i need to be sure are well taken care of. At this time in life, i need to be sure that all my time is spent in a sustainable way... By that i mean that while i spend time on one thing, it os becoming fuel to maintain tue other things...

[09-Oct-19 12:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe it's just nostalgia 🤷🏽 but I preferred when we were a community and not a "revenue machine"

[09-Oct-19 12:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think we are still a community

chainswap is open source tho :p

what i do think we should be getting attention and efforts to is to pegged coins

granted it's a usually unlikely issue, but still one nonetheless

[09-Oct-19 12:16 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Re: Closed GUI It will be used as a product to raise funding,  basically as part of a turnkey solution for CEXs to have their “own” Dex.   Some level of copy protection is needed.  This is not to mention the cost of the thing was quite expensive and needs recouped

The 3 facets for Komodo growth I’ve been advocating for in team channels are 1) trade filtering 2) pirate atomic swaps and 3) CC peg .  It’s like the fuel injector, drivetrain and transmission  to Atomicdex’s engine.

[09-Oct-19 12:21 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
All are being worked on currently

[09-Oct-19 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw: I represent this viewpoint not as what I, personally, need/want, but as a broad view. Personally I still have all the scripts I wrote for mm1 and can easily adapt them for mm2

[09-Oct-19 12:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
well, do that. I think your argument proves the need of different GUIs, interfaces and approaches.

[09-Oct-19 12:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you dont like chainswap because it uses electrum... fair enough.

it's not that I don't like it
the way internet is here I, literally, cannot use electrum with utility because of the low up speed and I have better than a lot of folks in the world

[09-Oct-19 12:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
others prefer to have it running natively
