To activete community even more: got an idea of  a crypto investments manifest: Buy, Hodl, Add Value. As it totally make sense for all hodlers to make at least any action to increase their holdings value. Can we use that slogan? What I mean by add value (could be deifned by community leaders) is example download app, install it, try it, let us know your experience on reddit and bitcointalk. This way KMD gets testing + small organic marketing (people writing about their tests) AND investors increase value of their holdings. So do you think we can create a new fashion in crypto to move from "Buy and hodl" to "Buy, Hodl, Add VAlue" ? üòÉ

[20-Aug-18 07:55 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Plus for good descriptions, valid bugs found some tipping budget could be set, so that some people will get rewarded, and more people will be motivated to involve. So some small comitee needed to receive emails and judge posts on reddit and bitcointalk?

[20-Aug-18 07:58 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
So like we have AMA Mondays,  Friday Bullets, can we add some "Hodlers Add Value Wedsnedays" ?

"As with many platforms, Tube8‚Äôs plans to tokenize could suffer from problems of scale. VIT is an¬†ERC20¬†token based on the¬†Ethereum¬†blockchain, which presently can handle about 15 transactions per second. With the current number of daily visitors, the only way to tokenize the site without choking up the blockchain, would be to run the reward system on a centralized server."

Curious what you guys think about trying to get attention in particular markets?

[21-Aug-18 03:48 PM] Regnar#6164
I was thinking instead of focusing on exchange listings based on volume, it could be better to focus on exchanges in areas of the world where we don't have as big a presence, but the exchanges have their local Fiat support.

I only have this free sample right now, and we might have a better one but it looks like France traffic is up 41%, Netherlands 15%, and UK 27%. So it might be beneficial to look at exchanges that are located in these regions and request listings

trying to figure out what countries are checking out Komodo website and then target exchanges in those countries with their local currencies. If the French are interested in Komodo and have to use chinese exchanges that's just more barriers.

[21-Aug-18 04:16 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea exchange volumes are often wash trading, that's the reality of having tens of thousands of exchanges across the world, and that's a good reason to not chase exchange volumes, but the location of the exchange and local fiat support is a much better targeting method when it comes to finding interested investors. My inclusion of trade volume above is not to say it's all organic volume, its definitely organic mixed with washing or simply all washing, but that's still a better chance than the exchanges with 0 volume in those areas.

here's a suggestion for marketing and SEO.
Please focus on keyword CryptoCondition.
make as much #CryptoCondition hash tag posts and articles referring to Komodo Platform.
Since Komodo Platform is the 1st one to have #CryptoConditions working on a live blockchain, we should popup first in result whenever people actually start searching on the keyword CryptoConditions.
Another keyword of interest is "UTXO based Smart Contracts".
these 2 should be useful for Komodo Platform.

That picture there makes Benny look like a jokester. I wouldn't have used it.

I think it's important to portray the GM of Komodo in a professional manner.

right, business manners are basic.

[22-Aug-18 03:40 PM] designer#4893
manners are not techniques, but minds. technology-only manners will not only reveal the bottom in a few minutes, but also allow the other person to feel it. what I learned from speaking to a number of companies is that people with true manners survive through.

That wallet is seriously...for lack of a better word... cool!

[23-Aug-18 04:15 AM] Regnar#6164
Also that Union bank idea is definitely a cool one, if we are going after them we should go with the full force of the Komodo official marketing team and in as much of a personal meeting as we can get. Face to Face. Steve and Benny what do we need to fly you out there üòâ
