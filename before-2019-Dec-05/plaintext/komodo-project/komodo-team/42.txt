Okay someone posted about this in Telegram, and I figure I'll pass it along here. IMO this seems sketchy, I haven't gotten to vet the idea in depth but I figure more of us looking at it is better than just me.

@Regnar yes, maybe platform in the name will deleted. komodocoin is good. Komodoblog, too. kmd.berlin could be the solution, but I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt like the ending dotBerlin in this case. Thanks for the brainstorming...1-2 ideas more...

Has anyone done a focus group on the name Komodo and gotten some actual feedback or are the name haters just using their feels to make decisions. I still contend there is nothing wrong with the name. Ethereum, eth is a horrible name. Stellar, Neo,  Tron, Dash, Steem, Waves, these are all stupid names. Whereas XRP, EOS, and other abreviated names, are not necessarily awesome names, but fit better then silly new age names. In that regard just KMD ain't too bad.

Here is SEND platform listing form. It seems like they link a crypto wallet to various social media accounts so you can send funds directly to someone's social media account. Says registration is free, though there may be a listing fee. Admittedly Cryptodude in Telegram found this and told me about it earlier but I kinda dropped the ball on passing the information along, my bad. Schedule had been hectic. Anyway, it seems like it would be a cool/simple feature. Thoughts?

It's obviously a much smaller platform than we generally want, but it is worth exploring since they are attempting to do something we aren't developing native. unless we plan to do that too haha

How and when was Komodo listed on Binance?

[30-Aug-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
about a year ago, not quite that long, not sure. we had to buy a bunch of the binance coins to get the listing

[30-Aug-18 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
top coins and real projects dont necessarily have to pay the retail price. ERC20 vapor projects likely need to pay more

@Daniel CP, That seems logical, though what is your perceived value as to the exchanges that offer listings for free vs the ones who want .25 million. For whatever reason, free never appears as valuable as those who charge. Maybe the solution is to value listing on the barterdex at some really high number. Then offer discounts because you can always lower your price. Any money gained would go to... liquidity providers, or bounties, etc.

[30-Aug-18 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810

"The Microsoft Network failed because it was just one more walled garden. One that was walled-off in two ways. One was from a business standpoint, of trying to keep users locked into it and locked off from the rest of the world. But the other was the technical standpoint. It wanted to make it look like the Network was something you had control over, something you could interact with just like you could with your own data. And it was a lovely idea, but that's all it ever was. The thing itself was never more than a facade. Meanwhile those Internet nerds were off pasting hyperlinks around, doing wreckless things like setting up their own email addresses and adding new things to the network without having to ask anyone first. And despite The Microsoft Network making every object look so real on the outside that you could just squeeze it and watch the AddRefs ooze out, the Web's simple idea of giving every thing a unique readable location won by a mile. It wasn't the Object Oriented dream we might have hoped for, but Open Always Wins."

Don't sell yourself short jl777, $50,000 per line is a small price to pay for sexy code. Just think of the deals these early adapters are getting, $50,000 per line of the best DEX code for the low cost of Free. Act now and you'll get not one but two extra lines of code comments each valued at $10,000. Offer not found in stores. Call now.

[30-Aug-18 04:40 PM] Regnar#6164
ha yea I understand your point Joe, and with some specific marketing it may work well. I am thinking that if we charge for listings, teams are forced to prioritize their funds which could take us out of the running for them. The listing fees themselves I don't think are much of a priority for Komodo as much as getting liquidity through the DEX where we generate dex fees from.

[30-Aug-18 04:42 PM] Regnar#6164
My thought a while back and still think it would be better suited for MM2, would be to make a form on our website with those basic requirements jl just listed, plus a few more like contact information for an actual team member (if we have problems with their stuff) and some of the Icon work and social media contact info. This way it's crazy easy to list (just fill it out) and we make joint social media announcements with each new coin to help spread awareness of Komodo and the DEX.

[30-Aug-18 04:45 PM] Regnar#6164
This additional contact info can also be used for us to reach out to them and request they provide LP's if they can.

[30-Aug-18 04:52 PM] Regnar#6164
Some additional products could be creating Agama and BarterDEX like white labels, and selling customized team skins for projects when they list. like if Xcoin submits for a listing, we could reach out and say we're listing on the DEX for free (and maybe OUR version of Agama) but we could also say we can customize a Xcoin themed skin Agama for a price, and maybe even an Xcoin themed BarterDEX skin. Something like when if they wanted the multicoin wallet with their theme, we basically have it so on opening it has Agama Logo and Xcoin logo and maybe some of their colors (they provide hex#), and it loads up with Xcoin, Komodo, and Bitcoin or something at start, has Jumblr feature built in, etc. 
That way they can get their coin users to download and use it, explore Jumblr, BarterDEX, Agama etc without feeling like they are pushing Komodo products on their users, we instead use BarterDEX, Agama, Jumblr as features and independent brands. It feels more in-house, and not "Komodo" but really it's all running on Komodo engines.
