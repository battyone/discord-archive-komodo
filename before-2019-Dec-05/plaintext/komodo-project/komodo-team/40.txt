[23-Aug-18 12:46 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
how Komodo would appear on this charts? How many nodes run the 20k tps test?

[23-Aug-18 12:52 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
This could be reused after the 1million tps test

[23-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The question is what they mean with # of nodes

[23-Aug-18 12:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
# of nodes needed for the test, or # of nodes as a measure of decentralization?

[23-Aug-18 12:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
In case of the latter in real world utilization the # of nodes would be immense

[23-Aug-18 12:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
(I think?)

[23-Aug-18 12:57 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I have the same question

[23-Aug-18 12:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
In which case KMD would be as far upper right as it could possibly be? üòÑ

[23-Aug-18 12:58 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes at scale with real usage it should be in the upper right

1M TPS and nationscale network

[23-Aug-18 01:01 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I tweeted under it, let's see if I get any answer

[23-Aug-18 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Otherwise just for the 1M TPS test, it's at least 1048 nodes, one for each chain?

[23-Aug-18 01:04 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes, but I think a chain needs at least 2 nodes, so 2096 nodes

[23-Aug-18 01:21 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
*1024 chains, so 2048 nodes

@blackjok3r  how are these "nodes" being defined? Want to make sure we're making a like for like comparison. Is this 16384 containers, or actual instances? I think by containerizing and using less physical nodes it could tell a better story?

[23-Aug-18 11:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
16384 nodes is 16384 komodod binaries. You need at least 2 one to send transactions and one to mine, although in the real world it would require more, come to think of it, for the notarizations it needs at least 3 nodes per chain, but it depends how you want to define it, as I am doing 64 chains (64 komodod binaries) on a single notary server, so is a server a node or the software a node?

[23-Aug-18 11:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think for technical reasons each chain having 3 nodes minimum to work would be the best way to describe it.

[23-Aug-18 11:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That allows all chains in the cluster to talk to each other as a single chain.

[24-Aug-18 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <n2okpride:matrix.org> I believe Zilliqa is measuing nodes in actual EC2 instances.

[24-Aug-18 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <n2okpride:matrix.org> I think we need to do a very indepth competitive analysis against the other projects in the scaling race, and their scaling methods. I'd like to be able to make an accurate like-for-like comparison, and avoid having holes be poked in our stories at a technical level.

Regarding rebranding - maybe I'm wrong but I believe communication strategy more important, so if you do rebranding, but no big change in communication strategy or just marketing strategy then I do not expect big impact.

@xRobeSx , as Daniel said rename is unlikely, it would only make sense if the new name would make a lot of sense, i.e. a brilliant name that fits the rebrand.

I agree that changing the name just for the sake of it is a bad idea.

[24-Aug-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
In several cases, name change for sake of name change has hurt things significantly

[24-Aug-18 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
everything is on the table, but it needs to meet some sanity test requirements and any change of "komodo" name itself brings the risk of this, so by default all rebrands that retain "komodo" have less risk.

[24-Aug-18 03:07 PM] dan.#2473
if its considered there should likely be tons of stats/unbiased surveys to back up data. it's less about the name, but more about what people currently think when they think komodo. If achieving the goal is more likely/easier with a new name, that might be a better choice than trying to rebrand with the komodo name. Personally I don't really care one way or the other, but every single person in this discord is likely bias and likes the name komodo, as we all made our way here so something about it compelled us

[24-Aug-18 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
since most everybody says the problem with komodo marketing is that nobody has heard of it, there seems to be not much gained by changing the name itself

[24-Aug-18 03:09 PM] dan.#2473
could be correct, I think it would be worth it for the agency to get some data to back that up
