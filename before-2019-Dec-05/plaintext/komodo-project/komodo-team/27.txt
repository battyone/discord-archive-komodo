For me the best way to market dPOW notary service so far is to approach the dev of other coins that I am invested in as well on btt forum, especially those that are prone to 51% attack. It's more personal than using twatter blasting the message. üòÑ

@RunningMantheCoin SN= SuperNET and MShark are assetchains that hold various other holdings such as kmd, they are tokenised funds. You can buy and sell supernet and mshark on barterdex and I think supernet on coinexchange as well

These are the kmd ecosystem holdings of mshark, not sure if it holds other stuff as well, there was a cli command to find out I think, but cant remember.

thanks #komodo-team for your KMD emoji responses earlier in the week (Sunday?).  I'll setup the ikomodo site on it's own dedicated VPS in the next cpl weeks.  It is a wordpress site for it's simplicity to publish.  Currently need to organise a bunch of kmd work relating to what the team is working on across  dev/marketing/qa-support.

There is a podcast coming out soon where team member Alright and I discuss assetchains, and if you haven't listened to the BBC radio podcast where KMD's siu talks about the potential in Puerto Rico for a brief section - there's that to keep you occupied and excited with what is happening.

[25-Jul-18 08:44 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
@RunningMantheCoin I've been thinking more about that table, there are some fundamentals differences between KMD and other platforms that is hard to fit them into those categories. You may want to explain this to the author. First is the question about Token Creation, KMD allows to create independent blockchains that can do atomic swaps with each other and they work as the equivalent of colored coins/tokens on other platforms. So answering the question depends if he means specifically colored coins from the technical point of view, then it's a work in progress, or if he means the purpose of token creation, then KMD assetchains can fit both the token and sidechain categories. Then there's a question about transaction costs: the assetchains  are independent and can decide their own tx costs and pay them in their own coins,  they don't pay kmd tx fees

[25-Jul-18 08:48 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not a side chain

[25-Jul-18 08:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Beauty is it's a separate network.  That's a very important distinction.

[25-Jul-18 08:51 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
exact, even that definition must be taken with a grain of salt, some approximation for fitting into the table at all

wow we are at 10% BTC activity level. the other coins use very chatty protocols so the tx count is not directly comparable

[25-Jul-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
this is an unexpectedly high percentage

[25-Jul-18 03:14 PM] CHMEX#0686
To be fair I told the guy to count payments and not transactions as he talks about activity. For BTC the still counts trx. 
I also gave him the scale test numbers.

[25-Jul-18 03:15 PM] CHMEX#0686
For KMD its payments thats why it 28k; trx are around 5.5k

[25-Jul-18 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes payments are fair

[25-Jul-18 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
for BTC, it would probably not even double things as most are single payment tx

[25-Jul-18 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe we are a bit under 10% of BTC activity level and being above BCH shows the KMD usage level in context

[25-Jul-18 03:18 PM] CHMEX#0686
Intressting is that zcash has about the same volume trx wise. But a higer mcap

[25-Jul-18 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
ETH seems to count each opcode as a transaction

[25-Jul-18 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
also we really should be counting the activity of all the assetchains, pretty sure ETH volumes include ERC20 activity

[25-Jul-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We are going to port the cryptocartography website to KMD and all AC after the scale test, it will also have a metric for notarizations.

[25-Jul-18 04:44 PM] joe2x4#5987
When approximately is the scaling test? And is there any complimentary marketing to go along with it? Ex: Evel Knievel markets the hell out of his events before they happen. Kmd going for a world record TPS should be treated like an event and preferably (my opinion) marketed like one. Who here recently  watched those twin rocket booster's touch down at the same time? This is just as epic in my opinion. ü§£

[25-Jul-18 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We cant set a date until we have a working platform to use.

[25-Jul-18 04:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Once the last parts are tied up, marketing will have plenty of notice before the test is run.

[25-Jul-18 04:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The only thing that has made this take so long has been AWS.

@Regnar__ @KomodoPlatform Just so I understand correctly, this scaling is already part of the deployed KMD network? If tomorrow there was a sudden burst of real use of kmd, how would the network cope? Would someone have manually add more capacity somewhere?
Twitter

[25-Jul-18 05:06 PM] Regnar#6164
Thinking of a clear simple response. "It's our proven scaling tech that is in the final stages to remove bugs, we've already tested 45k tx/s using this, but are securing the infrastructure to push that to 1M tx/s to make sure there are no bottlenecks when we turn the throttle up."

[25-Jul-18 05:07 PM] Regnar#6164
thoughts?

[25-Jul-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
he is assuming it is KMD itself that would scale, he doesnt seem to understand about the independent chains

[25-Jul-18 05:10 PM] Regnar#6164
yes, he is assuming it's just KMD and not the use of merkle trees for scaling. but anyway, the answer to his question is it's not deployed as a scaling tech yet

You could also add that the dPoW actually is important for future scaling as scaling chains use dPoW to secure themselves as they are added.
