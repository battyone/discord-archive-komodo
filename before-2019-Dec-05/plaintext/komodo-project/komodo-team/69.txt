the mobile version it will take some time but i do hear ledger  has new bluetooth devices

[11-Jan-19 04:21 PM] PTYX#6840
which could be compatible with mobile implementations

Ledger Blue
Ledger Blue is a premium hardware wallet with an advanced user experience thanks to a large touchscreen interface. It is built around a Secure Element and includes all the security features you‚Äôd expect from a Ledger device.

[11-Jan-19 04:21 PM] tolken#2655
New Ledger with the Bluetooth and something like Chameleon on mobile would be beautiful. Would be nice to have access to that many coins, eth, tokens etc.

[11-Jan-19 04:21 PM] PTYX#6840
actually that's not it, that's the big device. i saw one recently that is a new version of the nano s that is wireless

[11-Jan-19 04:21 PM] PTYX#6840
Definitely, we want to make it as accessible as possible

[11-Jan-19 04:22 PM] tolken#2655
yea, I‚Äôd be all over that.

[11-Jan-19 04:22 PM] PTYX#6840
we are also working on hybrid features like mobile topups

[11-Jan-19 04:22 PM] PTYX#6840
billpayments and such

[11-Jan-19 04:22 PM] tolken#2655
Mobile top ups? Top up of what exactly?

Could be cool if mobile app had a way to conveniently top up balances from a more secure wallet

[11-Jan-19 04:24 PM] tolken#2655
I just don‚Äôt like the idea of holding crypto on mobile, at least not any sizable amount

[11-Jan-19 04:24 PM] tolken#2655
Until a hardware wallet comes into Play.

[11-Jan-19 04:25 PM] PTYX#6840
agreed, that will be great

[11-Jan-19 04:25 PM] PTYX#6840
i've been in contact with coolbitwallet and other wallet providers to collaborate

[11-Jan-19 04:25 PM] PTYX#6840
i'm sure something will give this year with ledger mobile implementation

[11-Jan-19 04:25 PM] PTYX#6840
The magnum team was working on adding KMD to trezor too last time i heard.

[11-Jan-19 04:25 PM] PTYX#6840
the more hardware wallets the better

[11-Jan-19 04:26 PM] tolken#2655
Ahh, got it. Topoff, so in chameleon there would be a convenient/integrated way to use the topoff service directly within wallet?

[11-Jan-19 04:26 PM] PTYX#6840
exactly yeah

[11-Jan-19 04:27 PM] PTYX#6840
with crypto or fiat

[11-Jan-19 04:27 PM] tolken#2655
@PTYX any chance Chainzilla will work toward offering STO options (specifically for the upcoming securities crypto market)? Like Polymath and Securititize?

[11-Jan-19 04:27 PM] PTYX#6840
I think that if it's an app people use at least once a week to do something in the real world it will add that much more value to it

[11-Jan-19 04:28 PM] PTYX#6840
Actually once we finish our ICO in February i have to sit down with our devs to implement the new secion for the STOs

[11-Jan-19 04:28 PM] PTYX#6840
i've already coordinated everything regarding the legality of us offering those services but we haven't promoted them.

[11-Jan-19 04:29 PM] tolken#2655
We‚Äôre exploring those options now, but it‚Äôs all so new. Leaning toward Polymath.

[11-Jan-19 04:29 PM] PTYX#6840
it's going to be a huge market

[11-Jan-19 04:29 PM] PTYX#6840
not only issuance of new securities but migrations

[11-Jan-19 04:30 PM] tolken#2655
I wish KMD was ready to get in on that, but kmd would need some specialists to grow the right legal and use CC to customize the tech accordingly.

[11-Jan-19 04:30 PM] tolken#2655
maybe chainzilla will be able to leverage it soon.

[11-Jan-19 04:30 PM] PTYX#6840
I think it will be possible to launch non-fungible tokens with CC

[11-Jan-19 04:31 PM] PTYX#6840
which is what security tokens are. basically a token that carries an identifier with it or some other metadata

[11-Jan-19 04:31 PM] tolken#2655
I think technically KMD could do it, but there‚Äôs the whole front end dApps that need to be developed for management of securities/tokens, accounts etc.

[11-Jan-19 04:32 PM] tolken#2655
Lots of work, I think Polymath is barely there

[11-Jan-19 04:32 PM] tolken#2655
The exchanges that trade securities have to be compliant with these tokens as well since they go off chain.

[11-Jan-19 04:33 PM] PTYX#6840
i agree

[11-Jan-19 04:33 PM] PTYX#6840
there's an entire infrastructure that needs to be created before issuing and trading securities on the blockchain

[11-Jan-19 04:33 PM] tolken#2655
So the first runners like Poly and Securitize will have an advantage here as they‚Äôve been in constant negotiation/communication with exchanges to establish standards to interoperate with their token specs.

[11-Jan-19 04:35 PM] PTYX#6840
I can see them having an advantage in certain jurisdictions

[11-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Instel7#1416
What @Regnar said about "what is the goal of the rebrand" is something you guys from the inner marketing team should absolutely keep in mind, deciding between spending resources on making a new wallet or the Blockchain generator will drastically change the evolution of this Platform. I agree with Regnar on prioritizing on the blockchain generator as there are other projects from the ecosystem developing nice looking wallets, like the one from Utrum, Pungo, Chameleon from chainzilla, etc.

[11-Jan-19 04:37 PM] PTYX#6840
great wallets

[11-Jan-19 04:39 PM] Instel7#1416
Yes, creating a new wallet may help a little with user adoption, but I think that what Komodo actually needs is to bring here more developers and people that will make different uses and implementation of the platform

[11-Jan-19 04:40 PM] Instel7#1416
that's something Ethereum has that Komodo is lacking

[11-Jan-19 04:41 PM] Daniel CP#2020
@Instel7 I agree with you but the marketing team doesn't control development. We were going with the wallet b/c the blockchain generator was not complete but then the Dev team had some big breakthroughs and were able to make a lot of progress very quickly.  So now we're pivoting. If we had known the blockchain genrator would be finished this soon, we prob would have focused on this from the beginning

[11-Jan-19 04:42 PM] Daniel CP#2020
And yes, bringing in more developers is a key focus

[11-Jan-19 04:42 PM] Daniel CP#2020
That is more of a priority for us than making products for end users

bringing more developers, organizing hackatons and high quality documentation for devs, they're a top priority for me as well, speaking as long term investor

[11-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Regnar#6164
I have a question but I'll wait for Steve first haha

[11-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Steve Lee#1967
The scope of the rebrand is not a new logo and website.  If that was the case, we'd have it completed in a month. The current website was built in 3 weeks which is a clear example.

[11-Jan-19 04:59 PM] Steve Lee#1967
The delays have come from having to make decisions on which product the ux/ui focus will be on as it is a key component of the rebrand launch.

[11-Jan-19 04:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
problem isnt delay ... its that some website was shouting around a date ...

[11-Jan-19 05:00 PM] Steve Lee#1967
that's definitely something we need to better communicate

[11-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Steve Lee#1967
we were planning on an update after we release the annual report and to do a full ama

[11-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Steve Lee#1967
there are other dependencies and decisions that need to be made across the team. gaining agreement and consensus on things, along with understanding developmental timelines isn't something that is easily and quickly accomplished

[11-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Steve Lee#1967
many of these decisions will dictate the strategic priorities of komodo in 2019. these things cannot be rushed and the rebrand is a vehicle to launch all these things together

[11-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Steve Lee#1967
it'd make sense to launch one thing at a time.

Timing is also a critical factor in this industry.

[11-Jan-19 05:08 PM] Steve Lee#1967
Early last year there were lots of pressure for us to invest in more influencers, press announcements, conferences, all of which costs money. Imagine if we spent 100Ks to do that over the course of last year. What would be the ROI on that?

[11-Jan-19 05:09 PM] Regnar#6164
I have a question about ROI and direction.

[11-Jan-19 05:10 PM] Regnar#6164
**Assumptions leading to Question:**
Komodo has been a platform in which products are built on top that either utilize KMD, or utilize services of 3rd parties that hopefully drive back value to KMD and Komodo. Asset chains for example drive back value to the Komodo ecosystem through dPoW costs, tech development (like Verus), bringing more users who may buy KMD, use contracts paid in KMD, use BarterDEX (generate fees), Jumblr(fees) and others.

But technically things like Jumblr, BarterDEX, etc are not exactly Komodo (from my understanding) though mostly developed by the same devs that are on the Komodo team. They are 3rd party programs, apps, services that create more value for the platform. They generate revenue from the service itself being valuable (not a token required to be used for the service) but then use the revenue collected to purchase KMD on open market and distribute to their owners (creating demand for KMD). Broad generalization btw.

**Question:**
As Komodo rebrands (or positions itself in the market building tools catered to certain target markets) is the goal to continue this cycle, 3rd party development of products and services with attempts to tie those services into the value of KMD (without choking innovation and adoption like ETH), or is Komodo going to look to establish it's own products, partnerships, services? and can it technically make partnerships with companies without having a foundation (non code-controlling) or some other "entity" to sign papers?

For example I think of Mozilla Foundation.

Here are some highlights from 2018 @PTYX üòÑ 

We have had no big investments in paid ads or promotions which means all of the growth below has come about from the excellent tech, word-of-mouth and the work we‚Äôve put into our community. 

Email Marketing: delivered 828,419 emails, of which 115,737 were opened resulting in 10,532 clicks.

Infographic Content (viral contest) using Gleam.io generated 10,989 actions and attracted 1047 people to take part. Drove 2.9K users to Reddit which saw a big spike in subscribers and 715 to our email newsletter.

A large rise in the daily views on Facebook in 2018 where we‚Äôre getting many 100s compared to 2017 where we were getting single digit daily views.

Our Reddit community has grown from 1K subscribers in Sept 2017 to 8.2K subscribers in Dec 2018.

Community Onboarding: created welcome posts on Reddit, Discord and via automation in an email to new subscribers via automation was introduced with a welcome email which currently has a 62.2% open rate and 20.4% click-through-rate (very high).

Migrated from Slack to Discord and reorganised the channels for better navigation and onboarding.

Increased our scores on Binance and ICObench as a result of outreach in Dec 2018.

Applied and accepted on three crypto portfolio apps to publish our updates on to their audience.
