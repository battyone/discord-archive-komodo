Also instead of agama wallet just call it the komodo wallet

[26-Nov-19 03:14 PM] LooTz#2749
The more times the words komodo is seen and heard the more self marketable the product is

[26-Nov-19 03:15 PM] LooTz#2749
Google rule of 7

[26-Nov-19 03:59 PM] Oszy#5734
Bagde sounds good, Agama is not a Komodo wallet anymore tho, it's a multi coin wallet for the Komodo ecosystem, nor we have the jurisdiction to change the name i think, maybe Verus team can initiate such name change but I doubt it would beneficial for them.
Komodo Ocean QT is a komodo wallet and it's name reflects that.

[26-Nov-19 04:05 PM] LooTz#2749
cool you guys did it already, I never use the komodo ocean QT

[26-Nov-19 04:05 PM] LooTz#2749
what the Ocean word for ?

[26-Nov-19 04:06 PM] LooTz#2749
Why not keep it simple Komodo QT

[26-Nov-19 04:06 PM] LooTz#2749
anyway I thought of the badging for all coins to add to their site to use the dpow tech

[26-Nov-19 04:06 PM] LooTz#2749
thats really the more important thought here

[26-Nov-19 04:07 PM] LooTz#2749
"Komodo Secured"

[26-Nov-19 04:07 PM] LooTz#2749

lol

[26-Nov-19 04:17 PM] LooTz#2749
thank you for clearing that up

[26-Nov-19 04:17 PM] LooTz#2749
I had no idea a guy named ocean was involved in the name

[26-Nov-19 04:17 PM] LooTz#2749
not very effective

[26-Nov-19 04:18 PM] LooTz#2749
most people will have no clue

[26-Nov-19 04:18 PM] LooTz#2749
as I had no idea

[26-Nov-19 04:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when you're the 1st one to make it, you get to be the one to name it 🤷🏽‍♂️

[26-Nov-19 04:19 PM] Oszy#5734
Speaking of which, Pirate wallet isn't called Pirate wallet either 😛

[26-Nov-19 04:19 PM] LooTz#2749
I know trust me

[26-Nov-19 04:20 PM] LooTz#2749
be nice to uncomplicate things on all fronts for newbs

[26-Nov-19 04:20 PM] LooTz#2749
but it is what it is

[26-Nov-19 04:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
bitcoin-qt -> zcash-qt(never worked) -> KomodoOcean (released as "komodo-qt") -> PirateOcean (released as "pirate-qt")

[26-Nov-19 04:24 PM] LooTz#2749
Simple, Pirate Wallet, Komodo Wallet

[26-Nov-19 04:24 PM] LooTz#2749
simultaneously using keywords for SEO

[26-Nov-19 04:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
PirateOcean will never be`Pirate Wallet` because the guy that works on it knows that `komodod -ac_name=PIRATE...` is also a`Pirate Wallet` 😜

[26-Nov-19 04:26 PM] LooTz#2749
I guess was just a thought,

[26-Nov-19 04:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
On whole, the name being tied to what it is causes more confusion than if it were named `zjhndfkjzyseiurhnxdcy7v`
#BarterDEX
#atomicDEX

[26-Nov-19 04:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo

[26-Nov-19 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You can always fork PirateOcean or KomodoOcean and make it your own PirateWallet or KomodoWallet :troll:

[26-Nov-19 04:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because, decentralized

[26-Nov-19 04:31 PM] Oszy#5734

[26-Nov-19 04:31 PM] Oszy#5734

Hello

[28-Nov-19 03:40 AM] Offshore Crypto#6860
I’m the host of grin talk. On youtube. I have interviewed quite a few people on financial privacy , most notably Charlie lee of litecoin as of a few weeks ago

[28-Nov-19 03:41 AM] Offshore Crypto#6860
I would love to interview someone of the Komodo team that would like to speak about Komodo and the need for financial privacy

[28-Nov-19 04:34 AM] PTYX#6840
@Offshore Crypto do you charge for the interviews?

[28-Nov-19 04:36 AM] Offshore Crypto#6860
Jason is available yes?

[28-Nov-19 04:36 AM] Offshore Crypto#6860
No . I accept donations though in Grin.

Hi, does anyone know where I can find a visualization of Komodo's Github commits, like this one (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYprfBxki7k) but without the contributors names?

I saved one from you tube a while back, but not able to find it on y outube or locally.

[28-Nov-19 01:09 PM] Tom.T#6920
Some of community members dm me that some scamers send a link of fake wallet upgrade for stealing money.

[28-Nov-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
people need to be very careful, especially with DM coming from stranger!

[28-Nov-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
these scammers even make a fake github repo, with the evil wallet

[28-Nov-19 01:18 PM] Tom.T#6920
We should make an announcement for reminding.

[28-Nov-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[28-Nov-19 01:27 PM] Oszy#5734
make sure the repo is reported on github. if you can ask the people Tom

[28-Nov-19 01:59 PM] Tom.T#6920
@Oszy Yes! Will do.

[30-Nov-19 05:25 PM] Berg#2666
Hey everyone, I have a writer from Venezuela who has worked with HUSH to write some great pieces. Would Komodo be interested in having any spanish articles written or translated? @musicayfarandula would make a great ambassador for Venezuelan adoption 🙂

[01-Dec-19 07:38 AM] Audo#5667
hey @Berg , can you ask him to fill out this form and drop us a message? https://forms.monday.com/forms/a88c2459f9a5b716db778415e11cc18f

That way we get his contact details and can reach out when we expand the ambassador program and translation support

Hey team, it might be a cool idea marketing wise and also to showcase what can be done with Antara, to build an Antara smartchain to put these tweets on a blockchain. We could throw an explorer up that lets people view their deceased friend's and family's twitters and give it over to the Internet Wayback Machine. Make the nodes public so others can contribute to maintaining it, and make the blocks mined on demand (when new people are added)
