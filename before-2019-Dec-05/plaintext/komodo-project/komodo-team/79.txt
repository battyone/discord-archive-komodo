@Audo "We will succeed through adoption. Through creating a user base that developers can access via our community. P2P transaction along with  b2b and b2c transactions will allow us to scale tx speed along with user base as we gain traction. This creates a snowball effect. While you may not notice a few flakes of snow now, you cannot ignore the avalanche that is inevitable." <- that seems pretty good. does it conflict with rebranding

[17-May-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
@klein if you are convinced added mm2 KMD trading pairs wont help KMD, then you can believe that

[17-May-19 03:44 PM] klein#5233
I not saying it won't

[17-May-19 03:44 PM] Audo#5667
yes, we can use that, I'll take a note

[17-May-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
however, I believe that having KMD trading pairs in mm2 for all ecosystem projects provides a liquidity conduit for all ecosystem coins, as KMD is already in most of the large exchanges

[17-May-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
so the more ecosystem coins, the more overall KMD liquidity

[17-May-19 03:45 PM] klein#5233
The point I am getting at is KMD is great because there is not platform tax

[17-May-19 03:45 PM] klein#5233
no gas fees

[17-May-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
you want xyx coin, you can get it via KMD on mm2

[17-May-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, no platform tax is good point

[17-May-19 03:45 PM] klein#5233
but conversely there is no incentive to use KMD

[17-May-19 03:45 PM] klein#5233
in the major pairs

[17-May-19 03:45 PM] klein#5233
how about fee discounts like BNB

[17-May-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
using that logic 100% tax rate is optimal

[17-May-19 03:46 PM] klein#5233
when komodo is used to pay fees

[17-May-19 03:46 PM] joe2x4#5987
Kmd is a tool bag, now look at all the cool stuff you can build with it. No need to immediately explain we have the best hammer, the fastest screwdriver, or the sexiest wrench. Just say, hey look at the cool stuff being built with kmd tools. Look at their success, you can too

[17-May-19 03:46 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Is mm2 going to be worth a damn though? Bdex wasn’t. Hell I lost 5k kmd on bdex last year lol

[17-May-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
mm2 fees will be converted to KMD for revshare

[17-May-19 03:46 PM] Dr Debt#0891
They’re still there 😂😂

[17-May-19 03:46 PM] klein#5233
@jl777c not the same thing

[17-May-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
the more mm2 activity, the more KMD gets purchased.

look at the hype with BNB

[17-May-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
having three coins involved in a two coin swap is cumbersome

[17-May-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
proxy DEX is not decentralized

replicating some of the hype of BNB would be smart

[17-May-19 03:48 PM] klein#5233
I cant speak for the technical side of atomic swaps using 3 coins

[17-May-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
BNB hype is a function of binance volumes

[17-May-19 03:48 PM] Dr Debt#0891

what works for binance wont work for mm2

[17-May-19 03:49 PM] joe2x4#5987
Mm2 will explode if people witness successful traders making good money, they will want to emulate success.

Dex is even moderately successful ,  I won’t be worried about kmd price , that’s not to speak of everything else.

[17-May-19 03:49 PM] Dr Debt#0891
While I don’t for a second doubt your tech skills James, marketing is where the wars are won and lost. You can be the baddest man on the planet goin to war but if your enemy recruits @ 100:1 ratio you lose.

[17-May-19 03:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Moderately successful I equate to 50-60s on CMC exchange list

[17-May-19 03:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
So doesn’t need to be crazy volumes

[17-May-19 03:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
But software needs to get there first and it’s getting close

Ethereum has bombs because of adoption

[17-May-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
now we have half a dozen such, all integrated into a single technical platform, without taxes

[17-May-19 03:53 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I’m not saying the tech is an issue bud.

[17-May-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
if all we have to do is say nothing to get end users excited, then lets say nothing

[17-May-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
by "nothing" i mean the sentences above

[17-May-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont see how anything we are doing prevents us from doing that too, they are complementary

[17-May-19 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
so we can have 100 machine guns against 100 whatever

[17-May-19 03:55 PM] Dr Debt#0891
It’s sales/marketing 101.

Guy 1: I have a car.
No sale

Guy 1 with sales tactic: I have a 2019 Prowler with 500 miles on it and ill sell it at invoice minus rebates. 
Sold

[17-May-19 03:57 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Explaining and exciting are two different things.

[17-May-19 03:57 PM] Dr Debt#0891

[17-May-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810

[17-May-19 03:59 PM] joe2x4#5987
Car manufacturer markets car

[17-May-19 03:59 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Car manufacturers make them. Dealers market and sell them

[17-May-19 03:59 PM] joe2x4#5987
Kmd projects therefore are the marketers

[17-May-19 03:59 PM] Dr Debt#0891
With manufacturers dollars

[17-May-19 04:00 PM] joe2x4#5987
True dealers do market, but so do car brands

[17-May-19 04:02 PM] joe2x4#5987
People are less concerned about type of engine, etc then is it just cool and sexy.

[17-May-19 04:02 PM] joe2x4#5987
Market by showing cool and sexy projects

[17-May-19 04:07 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I see it from a different side. If a company is choosing a platform to launch on they’re going to base it on a few things: user base, functionality and scalability

[17-May-19 04:08 PM] Dr Debt#0891
The last 2 are in the bag. But the first is the most important

I’m not saying they aren’t but it needs to be grown significantly.

[17-May-19 04:23 PM] Dr Debt#0891
This should be a 40k user plus server

[17-May-19 04:25 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Then when you drop news and they share it,  it can’t be ignored

There will come a point where so many things will crescendo into utility and use that the underlying foundation will receive more support, input and growth.

I grew a reef tank one time for 5 years.  Every day it was as beautiful as the day before.  
But when I put a day one and a last day picture side by side, the difference was UNREAL!!!!   They were NOT the same at all.

[17-May-19 05:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
My point being that it will take time for an ecosystem to flourish given the proper nutrients and parameters. 
I see both the proper nutrients and parameters in Komodo and the mesozoic is just wrapping up while the Cenozoic is doing it's thing.

Parallel to the komodo marketing, I believe that investors seek profitability and the komodo platform already has that profitability in their assets (Dex, Pangea, Cripto ...) could be promoted that future profitability that is what an investor seeks , most of the holders of these assets are holders in the long term so the accumulation would raise the price Komodo, We take out komodos from the market raising the price and we create need to obtain komodos to buy assets. 

Here I see 2 points 

1 assets are extremely difficult to acquire currently what slows your increase in value 

2 I know it would generate additional work, but you should distribute the revshares (now crypto) more frequently and publish more each release (generate pumps)

sorry for my bad English

[18-May-19 01:31 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
3rd party assets on komodo platform cannot be marketed alongside the tech.     legal considerations

[18-May-19 01:50 AM] designer#4893
the key to bitcoin gaining trust from more people is its neutrality due to the absence of its creator. While all altcoin creators are busy promoting the superiority of their creation, bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto has disappeared. Satoshi Nakamoto does not take part in a meet-up or conference and not make plausible speeches about the development direction of bitcoin. bitcoin is neutral and is entirely based on public trust. this is a bitcoin advantage that other altcoin can never imitate. bitcoin is the right money for an era of distributed trust.

bitcoin is on the verge of a leap of trust. It is not small-scale startups or idealists who play a role in strengthening trust in bitcoin. It is a conglomerate with capital and power. Already, smart conglomerates have seen the potential of bitcoin as well as the opportunity to commercialize it immensely. they are pushing for bitcoin-related projects, sometimes publicly and secretly. when the time is right, conglomerates will show their true colors and try to monopolize the bitcoin-related market.

[18-May-19 03:30 AM] richardt#2807
@Audo or whoever is leading the marketing nowadays:  I think it's best to not over-complicate things when it comes to marketing.  I get that tech is very complex, but the marketing should be simple and easy/quick to understand.  Don't overthink it.  You guys have been trying to figure out how to market/re-brand KMD for a long time now and it seems you're still stuck on the initial stages of "what" to market.  IMHO, the problem lies in making it too complicated.

[18-May-19 03:32 AM] richardt#2807
As others have suggested, maybe just think in terms of end-products rather than the actual tech behind it.

[18-May-19 03:37 AM] richardt#2807
Or perhaps one of the major problems is that KMD is just simply not at a stage where it is ready to be mass marketed
