I think it would be good free publicity üòõ

[14-Jul-18 02:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Any publicity is good publicity, even better if he doesnt shut down our tech

[14-Jul-18 02:19 PM] Regnar#6164
I don't think we can change that. So I think this comes down to do we open ourselves up to that risk of an objective review being biased or unfavorable, and the deciding factor is the upside returns we can expect to gain from the positive review, and the downside we expose ourselves to the downside

[14-Jul-18 02:20 PM] Regnar#6164
and regardless of our involvement there is the chance he comes across our DEX on his own anyway

[14-Jul-18 02:27 PM] yorklab#7270
As a non-Dev, Jackson Palmer has always appeared to be objective in his talks. It would take a Dev to see through the bias. I suspect that 99% of the people that listen to him are like me, so he carries a lot of influence to his followers. I do like that he doesn't appear to shill coins, but he is still trying to make money like every one else.

[14-Jul-18 02:30 PM] Regnar#6164
I think some good points have been made on the pros and cons of this, what's the consensus on seeing if we can get him to look at Komodo for either a DEX tweet, or his weekly show?

[14-Jul-18 02:30 PM] Regnar#6164
I say yea

[14-Jul-18 02:33 PM] Regnar#6164
He does a lot of "what is" videos on youtube. but hasn't done a "what is an Atomic Swap" video. Maybe that's where we could reach out. What is atomic swap video, we send him the github links, KMD atomic swap explanation video, and any other resources

[14-Jul-18 02:33 PM] Regnar#6164
that might be better than the tweet thing

[14-Jul-18 02:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
market to everyone. doesn't matter they favor/like/dislike.

hmm I know ben is away right now, so anyone with a Komodo email want to reach out to him and ask if wants to do a youtube video on atomic swaps? doesn't even have to be about KMD haha just need atomic swap info out there, and by extension we can send him KMD stuff that is about how we're doing them, and mention how we build a DEX with it etc.

It will increase their Liquidity if it's easy enough to really launch your own exchange app

A lot of DEX competition out there.

"Our next release will include a ‚Äúmass exit‚Äù mechanism which ensures you never lose your crypto assets. If we‚Äôre hacked, our servers fail, or we experience malicious behaviour, you can exit our exchange without losing a penny."

I'm not sure I like the proof of authority mechanism. sounds....bancorish

[15-Jul-18 03:57 AM] Regnar#6164
however, the increase in DEX development is definitely a lot of competition.

[15-Jul-18 03:58 AM] Regnar#6164
imo considering how much we place on the development and success/ease of use of hyperDEX, we should definitely make sure that it is well funded for the foreseeable future, even if it is a 3rd party.

@PTYX  retweets can be manipulated by bots -> if any better tip retweets with followers lower limit whatever is reasonable. Joining discord could also be manipulted this way, and adds no value. Tipping might be better to people having personal blogs and writing some decent articles. But make sense only if planned -> simultaneous articles similar time , like 100 a week in different blogs, media and so on. Must be coordinated. @Dr Debt  the airdrop I would suggest to split by weight of followers, meaning calculate avg weight of retweet to measure share of this 10k USD. Will be more resonable to impact and more interesting for bigger players, for whom 10k $ is still nice money for a retweet üòÉ

[15-Jul-18 07:58 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
This way if 5000 people with 1 follower will do retweet and 1 person with 5000 followers, the 1 person will get 5k $  and the rest will get 1$ each, which is relevant for impact and less bot/spam-prone.

yup, we don't have full smart contract capabilities yet.

we do but it just requires custom eval functions and a dedicated chain, so not for people who arent able to code at that level

[16-Jul-18 10:01 AM] Audo#5667
I see

Would it be possible to make some code example? This capability was brought to us from the cryptoconditions & interoperability tech? It would fit nicely to our Komodo 5 pillar campaign.

It would be nice to highlight this with something concrete, i.e. "how to develop X on KMD"

[16-Jul-18 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, working on a demo game that has very simple rules so the work needed for the blockchain side is clear

[16-Jul-18 10:02 AM] Audo#5667
awesome!

[16-Jul-18 10:04 AM] Audo#5667
I have been thinking of ideas for simple games too, but they always end up becoming too complex üòÑ

[16-Jul-18 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be a simple 2 player card vs card game. At the start two players agree to the deck used, like N cards with total value of X. The the players bet a card against the other player. higher denomination wins. Owner of the card, owns the coin value

[16-Jul-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
so fund cards with 1, 2, 3, ... 13 CHIPS (to represent ace high) and then each round one card is dealt by each player. at the end of the round, the results update who has what cards

[16-Jul-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
likely not a very exciting game, but should demonstrate the important parts

What about using existing games like tictactoe or blackjack? I think using known games is more effective to attract ppl than creating a new one.

[16-Jul-18 04:26 PM] tese#3502
In general terms, when you create something new, ppl is more critic and gets frustated early

[16-Jul-18 04:27 PM] tese#3502
In the other hand, If we want to create our own games, we should have graphic designers to make the product more attractive to users

the point of the first one is to be a demo for programmers
