<@U6ZES59AA> I do like "Komodo Security Services" because it is just that. Chainmail, Cluster Chain, Scale Chain, or the sort. I like to think of the dPoW function as connected different blockchains in some way, and they form a type of chainmail for protection.

It is as if the komodo ate the cat (or the ethereum hehehe)

"Amazon is on the verge of releasing its own cryptocurrency.

This could happen tomorrow... it could happen next week... or it might not happen for a couple more months. But rest assured... Amazon Coin is coming out before the end of 2018.

And to tell you the truth, when a major player like Amazon enters the crypto market... it's going to blow Bitcoin, Ethereum... and any other coin... out of the water.

But here's the thing: The way to play this opportunity is not by buying shares in Amazon's stock, although I think it's a great investment. And you shouldn't stock up on their crypto coins either.."

Bruce Fenton has a bunch of followers, is the CEO of a blockchain investment fund, was a host of the Satoshi Roundtable, helped start Ravencoin (which is supported on BarterDEX) Is a board member of Medici Ventures (the crypto investment group set up by http://Overstock.com) is recently added to the board of directors of Tzero investment fund, and was executive director of The Bitcoin Foundation. He's a hard core libertarian and has said multiple times in public that Atomic Swaps are going to change crypto forever.  A bit about this strategy, he LOVES superman and comic book characters and is often seen in a superman shirt even at formal events with a blazer so Senda put his head on Superman's body, changed the logos to KMD and used a Superman quote that we tweaked to bring light to the importance of Atomic Swaps. "You are much stronger than you think you are, trust me" is the superman quote.

[06-Jun-18 12:31 PM] cryptoon#0000
regarding the article you shared in announcements

[06-Jun-18 12:31 PM] cryptoon#0000
The pillar of the Komodo blockchain is their bitcoin level security. The network uses delayed Proof-of-Work algorithm to secure your data. This is because Komodo began as a fork of Zcash, the famous security coin. Businesses that are in the ecosystem enjoy this security benefit that is even affordable to small businesses and startups.

[06-Jun-18 12:32 PM] cryptoon#0000
These sentences don’t make much sense to me tbh

[06-Jun-18 12:33 PM] cryptoon#0000
This kind of implies that it has bitcoin level security because it is a fork of zcash

[06-Jun-18 12:33 PM] cryptoon#0000
And zcash isnt a famous security coin, it is an anon coin, which I think the writer means?

[06-Jun-18 12:41 PM] benohanlon#0000
<@U8QKXKKBM> thank you. I'm going to reach out and look to improve it.

[06-Jun-18 12:42 PM] cryptoon#0000
Yeah the entire article could use some polishing tbh

[06-Jun-18 12:43 PM] benohanlon#0000
I found their telegram and have reached out - as well as asking my team internally if they have a contact.

[06-Jun-18 12:43 PM] malti#0000
Yes, I was going to share it on linkedin after reading, however because of the poor quality of the article I decided not to do so

[06-Jun-18 12:43 PM] benohanlon#0000
I confess I read the title and shared. My bad <@U8QKXKKBM> <@U8QP8LC2E>. Thank you for helping me improve this.

[06-Jun-18 12:44 PM] malti#0000

[06-Jun-18 12:47 PM] benohanlon#0000

Does anybody know how to reach out to JL?

[06-Jun-18 11:25 PM] regnar#0000
just a thought, what if we started a Komodo "like bomb" telegram channel? the rules are no chatting, only posting Komodo related Twitter and reddit posts that we want everyone in the channel to like and retweet/share?

[06-Jun-18 11:26 PM] regnar#0000
right now we have 8500 people in telegram, many of which aren't active and many different conversations going on. so if we post a link to a tweet or reddit we want everyone to like, it gets pushed up and buried with all the other conversations and support requests etc.

[06-Jun-18 11:28 PM] regnar#0000
so if we make a channel and have only our most active members join (those who are active enough to like tweets and posts etc when they are there) we can try and concentrate efforts to specific posts that we want attention to be raised to. for instance mentioning Komodo to a erc20 token on their twitter when they talk about an issue their having. it would be much more beneficial to have 50-100 or more likes and retweets on THAT post, for both spreading awareness, as well as blowing up that erc20 coins notifications

[07-Jun-18 01:02 AM] utrumfoundation#0000

Post it on KMD group, so interested people can join

[07-Jun-18 02:25 AM] regnar#0000
we have the announcements channel and there aren't too many followers in there right now. This would be more about liking particular posts, not necessarily updates and announcements.

[07-Jun-18 02:27 AM] regnar#0000
like if there is an opportunity for Komodo on Twitter, we could post the tweet tagging Komodo and drop it in the channel and everyone in the channel likes, retweets, and tags 3 influencers.

[07-Jun-18 02:30 AM] regnar#0000

One designer's opinion: All in on Komodo tech, jl777 & code team is absolutely incredible. Is Komodo open to design and marketing proposals? What is the actual marketing budget? Is Ben underfunded/staffed? I cannot wrap my head around these marketing desicions; retweeting one of the biggest con artists McAfee, derpy animated gifs, the pandered chinese coin listing where xvg is rated higher than bitcoin. A twitter profile that points to a newsletter form (that doesn't show up if you have ad blocking on or forward to Komodo's website after form completion) instead of the Komodo website with newsletter signup. in10tion pumped out a generic poorly laid out website that looks exactly like all the other poor generic templates they do, voiced an opinion to avoid using in10tion before the revamp, hard red flag. Use of a depressive color palette. These are not professional standards, please invest in marketing as seriously as you take coding. Proper communication and user experience is key.

[08-Jun-18 11:51 PM] benohanlon#0000
<@U8JQ1UV8A> proposals to <@U6ZES59AA> please 🙏🏻

[09-Jun-18 01:18 AM] tolken#0000
<@U8JQ1UV8A> what we have right now is the Komodo v1.5 interim design website. It’s reasonably clean and was definitely an improvement over the last, but not a huge fan of the palette either. I’m hoping the 2.0 is a significant departure from the current green template aesthetic.

[09-Jun-18 01:19 AM] tolken#0000
would be cool if there was some aesthetic cohesion between HyperDex and Komodos new site.

[09-Jun-18 01:20 AM] tolken#0000
Agama as well. Agama/HyperDex/website color/style unification. I think HyperDex is its own thing, but the unification of style is on their agenda afaik.

From someone who has been in marketing 20 years... it's as simple as that.
