What constitutes vote cheating or vote manipulation?

[13-Jul-18 11:13 AM] benohanlon#1119
@Jazzy harassment vs 'ask me questions' is not semantics. It's a fundamental difference in meaning.

[13-Jul-18 11:13 AM] Patziggy#9371
Just wanting to be clear about what's being stated here.

[13-Jul-18 11:14 AM] benohanlon#1119
asking people to visit an AMA ... lol

[13-Jul-18 11:14 AM] Patziggy#9371
Not a fan of Reddit of their censorship, but for the sake of being forthright d:

[13-Jul-18 11:14 AM] Jazzy#0001
Thank you @Patziggy

[13-Jul-18 11:15 AM] Patziggy#9371
IMO Reddit keeps the rules vague to serve their interests, but nonetheless this indeed skirts the line for better or worse ü§∑

I'll take your advice under consideration for future AMAs. Thank you.

[13-Jul-18 11:17 AM] Patziggy#9371
Certainly. With the strength and development behind Komodo something simple like "vote manipulation" on an already censorship-happy platform may give the nay-sayers some unwarranted yet psychologically effective ammo

[13-Jul-18 11:18 AM] benohanlon#1119
Next time I'll do it without the search URL @Patziggy . We can agree on that.

[13-Jul-18 11:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is this any different to posting a link to a tweet which has a link to the ama?

[13-Jul-18 11:21 AM] Patziggy#9371
Given that was that was the express purpose for the link format that may bode most favorable. Less about my agreement and more about the stated rules and public optics, yeah?

Ultimately the format and @ everyone is what makes it a toss up IMO. Just my 2 cents and community management experience ü§∑

[13-Jul-18 11:21 AM] benohanlon#1119
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator prob not - my mistake was to articulate that an upvote would be appreciated. In future I'll give links but not explicitly say that - only factually state the AMA is going on.

[13-Jul-18 11:22 AM] benohanlon#1119
At the end of the day I am answerable to the community so even if I personally disagree with @Patziggy and @Jazzy I think there is more value in listening than arguing. I want us to work together.

[13-Jul-18 11:22 AM] benohanlon#1119
Also - I am wrong sometimes. I can admit that üòÉ

[13-Jul-18 11:22 AM] benohanlon#1119
So maybe this is one of those times.

[13-Jul-18 11:25 AM] Patziggy#9371
No argument here, I love Komodo üòÑ

I'm wrong more often than I'm right, so many good heads with good intentions helps us all go further. Thanks for your hard work @benohanlon!

fair enough. I understand rules exist, and the potential for bad optics is best avoided.

[13-Jul-18 11:27 AM] benohanlon#1119
yeah - we won't use that tactic again

[13-Jul-18 11:28 AM] Jazzy#0001
I think the place to toe the line is generally around asking for upvotes

[13-Jul-18 11:28 AM] Jazzy#0001
Linking and notifying people is fine, but the arbitrary line is suddenly crossed when you ask for support

[13-Jul-18 11:29 AM] Jazzy#0001
The search URL is actually a good way to mitigating risk around being flagged for this kind of activity and is probably good to maintain

[13-Jul-18 11:32 AM] benohanlon#1119

if up voting gets Komodo more visibility, I dont c the problem. Komodo is already being ignored by almost everyone, so I dont see the harm in the above tactics to it very easily foster some needed discussion about how KMD compares to others that have just an "idea" and got tons of money during their ICO. I have tons of CREDITS AND REN PROTOCOL, all great ideas but nothing tangible and the same goes for Vertcoin, ARK, EOS  and the like. I promote KMD whenever possible in response to articles about crypto.

Someone was talking about improving liquidity on the DEX. As I understand it, liquidity comes and goes  with the user's online status.  Is there a Liquidity/trade Oracle?  Ie: a website or app that tracks and notifies users of liquidity(buy/sell offers) so as a user can interact  with DEX at the right time. Maybe even post requests for liquidity to be added to a pair so as someone knows there is interest in a trade. Thanks

Question @benohanlon :  How is Komodo tracking who voted for Komodo on the KuCoin bounty?   I can't seem to find that or where to show we voted on the 5 bullet Friday.

[13-Jul-18 02:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
On the graphics for the email, the reddit Snoo looks like he's smoking komodo üòõ which may or may not be intended.   The credit card says CrytoCard.  Did they name it that or did we drop the p? üòÉ   Sorry i've been so absent lately.

I got Five Bullet Friday Komodo email today, and it does say "CAST YOUR VOTE FOR KOMODO TO BE LISTED ON KUCOIN: and earn your share of 5 BTC in $KMD! " which links to a medium article explaining how to vote. https://blog.komodoplatform.com/kucoincompetition-c0e05fae6c05  But then there is nowhere to register that you did indeed vote. A little janky.

@grizzlehkitteh that is what I was asking @benohanlon about.

I posted the question on Medium, and he answered that he thinks you register your vote on the Komodo telegram

[13-Jul-18 08:11 PM] grizzlehkitteh#8706
although there is nobody posting anything regarding the kucoin vote on the komodo telegram

@benohanlon  mentioned a debit card,  https://peer2.krd/ , in his Friday Five this morning.  In their FAQ, it says  the minimum deposit is  500 Euro, but the maximum deposit is 250 Euro.    

What is the minimum amount of load in cryptocurrency?
The minimum amount of load in Komodo or Bitcoin is ‚Ç¨ 500.
  
What are the conditions of my Prepaid Debit Card?
As of the date of publication of this FAQ, the limits of the cards are:

‚Äì Neither registration nor verification: just one load of up to 250‚Ç¨.

@joe2x4 great ideas. Something like this could be helpful for more obscure coins. For common pairs, major coins, liquidity will come as BarterDex software matures and simplifies the setup process. It doesn‚Äôt take many BarterDex marketmakers to provide adequate liquidity. ‚ÄúSomeone was talking about improving liquidity on the DEX.

The key thing here is not the hack itself - it's the fact the Bancor team had the ability to freeze funds. How many other "decentralized" DApps have a built-in kill switch that's centrally controlled? https://t.co/3XtULafGRD

^ maybe we should get Jackson to check out Komodo decentralization and DEX.

[14-Jul-18 02:00 PM] Regnar#6164
He's been on a tear running through "DEXs" and smart contracts finding back doors, kill switches, and pause buttons controlled by a central authority, and posting them in that thread for different projects.

[14-Jul-18 02:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
then ask him this question on his weekly crypto show and let KMD fans ask and vote on those questions.

[14-Jul-18 02:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

haha yea that's fine though, but he's bringing publicity to the false sense of decentralization

[14-Jul-18 02:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
For business someone's opinion might be less than their own needs and assurance of what one tech solution gives them. Both in short term and long term.
Any major influencers like andreas, vitalik or charlie etc are looked at by those who mostly seek for expert's opinion on subject matters.
I looked at those too at some point. By time I understood the tech and could evaluate myself that their expert view points are not always reliable.

[14-Jul-18 02:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess the same case applies to businesses too.

[14-Jul-18 02:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If they see the Komodo tech useful both in short term and long term for their business, they'll adopt it.

[14-Jul-18 02:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here. I understand that the big names are not always reliable experts.

[14-Jul-18 02:13 PM] Regnar#6164
and businesses know this too, which is why firms hire consultants, "expert brain power" for hundreds of thousands of dollars and then sometimes don't take their advice. "experts" aren't always right, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't look to them, even in crypto.

[14-Jul-18 02:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree

[14-Jul-18 02:14 PM] Regnar#6164
So are you saying getting Jackson to look at Komodo isn't a worthwhile idea?

[14-Jul-18 02:15 PM] Regnar#6164
I guess I'm just trying to understand the flow from Jackson to "their expert view points are not always reliable" haha I'm not trying to argue

[14-Jul-18 02:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[14-Jul-18 02:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
they can still discard that Komodo tech isn't worthwhile while it is. But to them it might not be from their point of view. I keep my bets on my own evaluation.

[14-Jul-18 02:18 PM] Regnar#6164
right, there is a risk "experts" don't like the tech, but that's the whole point of trying to get objective views, the risk being the objective view isn't favorable, or that it is biased, but that's the risk
