alot of misunderstanding

[18-May-19 03:56 AM] richardt#2807
Then again, there are projects out there with less working tech than KMD but have much more recognition and investor interests.  Maybe it's time to admit that whatever marketing strategy that have been used is not very effective and something new needs to be tried.

[18-May-19 04:09 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
We have governments and international organizations and several high profile funds looking at utilizing the tech .

^ now that would be a good marketing point.  Care to share more details? 😄

[18-May-19 04:34 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
When it’s time to. More important to focus on execution.   Komodo operates with lots of parallel developments hence why we can put out a stream  of development updates.  By every metric our growth continues except coin price and a lot of that has to do with Gresham’s law situation surrounding bitcoin.  And the fact that 99.99999% of people are in it for immediate fiat gains doesn’t help either.

[18-May-19 04:35 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
However I do agree we can expand marketing  efforts

[18-May-19 04:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
We need to hit the pavement more so we need need to build the tools and train the troops to do so

[18-May-19 04:42 AM] richardt#2807
I guess that's one of the downfalls of having a "decentralized" team.  Difficult to organize efforts.

[18-May-19 04:45 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not just decentralized teams but many independent projects as well

[18-May-19 04:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`We need to hit the pavement more so we need need to build the tools and train the troops to do so`
This is a thing labs will help with a lot, if it takes off. The idea is to gamify teaching how to build and test the tech while offering ppl financial incentive at the same time. Because 99% of people only want money, we need to make learning about the tech and using it profitable in the short term.

I've begun writing notes on potential `Lab Academy` courses, and how to gamify involvement with badges, comps etc. Big job, but I'll chip away at it.

Thinking of affiliate stuff like external coursera stuff for learning code, VPS referal credits etc.
These can be comp prizes and help fund Labs infrastructure

[18-May-19 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For cc development itself, IMO we have a fair way to go before any normal person can make contracts. I've discovered a lot of things making the payments cc that should make cc development much easier in the future.

[18-May-19 04:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
some of the earlier comps can be reused I think. Just need to modulise and workout how/when etc

[18-May-19 04:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, CC is postgrad 😄

[18-May-19 04:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm starting of with basics. user can unlock advanced by ranking up

[18-May-19 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Contracts can be made without such difficult vout constraints by using a heap of code borrowed from verus, won't be a small job getting some standard working though.

[18-May-19 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And also remains backwards compatible with existing shit

[18-May-19 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the entire way they work needs to be slightly changed. The ccvout can actually contain its own "OP_RETURN" I got basics of this working already in paymentsCC, but there is a far better way to do it even than that I just need to get my head around and make something that uses it.

cool, plan is to build one by one as time goes on, and feedback would be helpful. Ideas are still quite early,

[19-May-19 11:18 AM] Exile13#4458
step by step blockchain learning, kindergarden-doctorate, focus on small steps at first, badges, tokens, and accessibility to "teacher/creator levels" upon completion

[19-May-19 11:20 AM] Exile13#4458
specific sequential increments of said tokens identifies one as 'learned'

[19-May-19 11:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
challenge is keeping up with rate of development here 😄

[19-May-19 11:22 AM] Exile13#4458
by giving these token s away it strengthens your own standing

[19-May-19 11:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
subconscious cant be mesured in the nuits of our dimension. conscious is much slower. 
it's like the relationship between distance, speed, acceleration

[19-May-19 11:27 AM] Exile13#4458
yes

[19-May-19 11:33 AM] Exile13#4458
upon passing the quiz or test the user gets a token granted by the teacher, lessons require at least 1 teacher and 1 student, teacher must supply knowledge that will be tested so that verification of this knowledge can be displayed, after so many tokens users get different benefits from the system maybe can start teaching at some point.

youre doing it wrong, you need a countdown timer for the announcement of the announcement.  then a countdown timer for the announcement.  then you make sure you sell before it runs out.

But it could also be used as a social credit system which is or isn't a bad thing.  I guess that depends on how it's depolyed.

[22-May-19 11:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts many educational institutions give out digital "open badges", for say Python coding, and you can show that badge on your website, and others can cryptographically verify that yes, indeed, you do actually have that badge from that organization. It removes the "lying on your resume" part of the game, or at least makes it a lot harder

[22-May-19 11:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's been around for many years and I haven't checked on it lately, but it's well-funded and well-connected. KMD adding a badge to their system would put KMD in front of the eyes of many people that would otherwise never see it

@Scarborough I believe @cipi  is updating SPV servers.  There is one that should be up right now let me try to find name of it

[24-May-19 06:25 AM] cipi#4502
yes, electrums updated to latest version... one still to go... but should not matter, since the IP of the one that is offline is removed from DNS answer, so you should connect normally, with electrum1 to electrum3.cipig.net and it should resolv to a running electrum

[24-May-19 06:41 AM] Scarborough#9066
Got it, thank you.

[24-May-19 09:21 AM] Scarborough#9066

The problem is that we have no way to change to electrum 3, the only options are 1 and 2, can't add it manually. Thanks.

[24-May-19 04:55 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I just watched a live stream and kmd was brought up. The take was not a positive one but an important one to see as we go forward. The take was: Why would I buy kmd when it literally has done nothing as far as price action in over a year? Sure they’re “developing” but another 5 teams will pop up with marketing and just take the work they’ve done and put it to use. 
On top of that, there are so many bagholders that this won’t have a chance to grow as everyone has been underwater for so long, they will dump the first sign of breakeven or profit.

@jl777c there really needs to be a marketing effort here man. I appreciate the work you all put into this, but without a solid marketing effort all you are doing is paving the road for someone else to surpass you.

if you mean advertising, that is because we have no budget for that
