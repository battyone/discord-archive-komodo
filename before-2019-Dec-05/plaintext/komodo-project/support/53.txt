Hi, I  use native mode. After upgrading from 0.2.41d to 0.2.43d , it takes too long to be fully synced, more than 1 day. Is this normal?

[13-Nov-18 07:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @TShell Are you using same hardware and operating system as before (when you synced 0.2.41d)?

[13-Nov-18 07:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Synchronisation in Native mode depends of your drive IOPS (on SSD it's much much faster) and  internet connection speed (blocks downloading on your PC)

[13-Nov-18 07:37 AM] TShell#0416
Yes, I use the same one. I have also used SSD. All I did is update, the result of which looks like reindexing from the scratch.

[13-Nov-18 07:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Is synchronisation stuck on some height or it's going  but slow?

[13-Nov-18 07:43 AM] TShell#0416
I tried on two different SSDs. The first one was stuck at 94.60%, so I stopped and changed into lite mode. The second is verifying blocks slowly.

[13-Nov-18 07:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Could you please open a email ticket to support@komodoplatform.com if synchronisation will stuck again? By the way which OS are you using?

[13-Nov-18 07:47 AM] TShell#0416
I use Windows7 64bit.

[13-Nov-18 07:48 AM] TShell#0416
Thank you for your time

[13-Nov-18 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577
You're most welcome! Windows OS usually also adding some "slowness" if compare with Linux. There are various reasons why it's started to sync from scratch (e.g. blocks database was corrupted on starts/stops). If there some states when sync is stuck on your side it should possible to get additional information via daemon logs so please feel free to contact us to troubleshoot.

Will Jumblr be possible in Lite mode?

[14-Nov-18 04:49 PM] gcharang#6833
No. Jumblr uses z-Addresses which are not supported in lite-mode

[14-Nov-18 06:10 PM] Seko#7408
With sapling we can solve the problem?

[14-Nov-18 06:25 PM] Hermes#6934
"The Jumblr process is managed locally on the user’s machine and requires no third parties, human coordination, or other mixing services."

[14-Nov-18 06:25 PM] Hermes#6934
I think that the main focus is to do all this process in your own machine to avoid depending on any third party outside of your computer.

Guys is it possible to export a seed? or is it only possible to get the seed when initially creating a new wallet?

[15-Nov-18 04:30 PM] Nabob#5004
You cannot export seed, only created when using new wallet. but you can export private key from Seed

[15-Nov-18 04:33 PM] gcharang#6833
@Psipherious you can do it through `Settings > export keys > enter pin > get seed`

[15-Nov-18 04:41 PM] Psipherious#2635
Okay, found that, ty

[16-Nov-18 09:28 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
@Team  Admin  Hi, thank you very much for your work. I am trying to setup the first atomic swap. ABP is not yet on CMC, which is causing me an issue with autoprice_my. Is it possible to by pass this?

[16-Nov-18 09:29 PM] SHossain#0007
If the coin is not in CMC, you need to use manual/fixed price

[16-Nov-18 09:32 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
Thank you @SHossain how do I do this here? ```curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"autoprice\",\"base\":\"ABP\",\"rel\":\"KMD\",\"margin\":0.04,\"refbase\":\"abpnetwork\",\"refrel\":\"coinmarketcap\"}"```

[16-Nov-18 09:34 PM] SHossain#0007
```
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"autoprice\",\"base\":\"ABP\",\"rel\":\"KMD\",\"fixed\":0.4}"
```

[16-Nov-18 09:35 PM] SHossain#0007
change 0.4 to any price you like

[16-Nov-18 09:37 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
@SHossain Thank you very much sire!

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[16-Nov-18 09:40 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
@SHossain Just tried and it again says ```{"error":"couldnt set autoprice"}```

[16-Nov-18 09:41 PM] SHossain#0007
do you have ABP and KMD coin daemon running?

[16-Nov-18 09:41 PM] SHossain#0007
are both coins enabled ?

[16-Nov-18 09:42 PM] SHossain#0007
the command i posted will work if you are doing everything else right

[16-Nov-18 09:42 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
Yes both are running

[16-Nov-18 09:43 PM] SHossain#0007
post output of `./balances`

[16-Nov-18 09:44 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
Here is the content of my enable_my ```source userpass
./setpassphrase > /dev/null
curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"enable\",\"coin\":\"KMD\"}"
curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:5426" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"enable\",\"coin\":\"ABP\"}"```

[16-Nov-18 09:44 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
```[]``` That is ouput of `./balances`

[16-Nov-18 09:45 PM] SHossain#0007
do you have balance in both coins?

[16-Nov-18 09:46 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
No I don't

[16-Nov-18 09:46 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
I didn't even know we were suppose to have a balance

[16-Nov-18 09:47 PM] SHossain#0007
how would you setup bob node or post order if you don't have balance

[16-Nov-18 09:48 PM] SHossain#0007
if you don't have balance you can't trade

[16-Nov-18 09:48 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
I thought it was possible to set everything up first and then get the coins to try it out

[16-Nov-18 09:49 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
I am going to get balances right now thank you for your help.

[17-Nov-18 02:41 AM] ABP brewmaster#0177
@SHossain I sent KMD to the shown `"smartaddress"` , and now how can I send ABP to its smartaddress?

[17-Nov-18 10:45 AM] SHossain#0007
when you use `./setpassphrase` script, it shows  the smartaddress for all coins.

Lite mode uses electrum SPV server, you don't need to download blockchain data
Native mode requires downloading full chain data
