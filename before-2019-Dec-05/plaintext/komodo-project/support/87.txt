follow this guide https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026360-restoring-an-address-in-agama-lite-spv-mode-with-a-wallet-seed-or-private-key

[03-Jun-19 09:10 PM] taco#7800
Thanks  @SHossain that worked. So the new pin is not deterministic? So from now on the pin and pin file are the two things I need going forward

[03-Jun-19 09:11 PM] SHossain#0007
always keep a backup of your seed. PIN is just to make things easier for you to login every time

[03-Jun-19 09:28 PM] taco#7800
Ok thanks  @SHossain

[05-Jun-19 12:22 AM] go-pye#8007
I'm having trouble with komodo build.sh script on linux, `error: toolset gcc initialization: error: provided command 'armv7l-unknown-linux-gnueabihf-g++' not found`, any ideas?

[05-Jun-19 01:14 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
how do i get a new seed?

[05-Jun-19 01:14 AM] Oso#8487

use paper wallet in a completely offline computer

[05-Jun-19 01:16 AM] Alecandro#1179
Yes, what‚Äôs up?

[05-Jun-19 01:16 AM] Alecandro#1179
Is it safe to login to Agama to send coins to ledger?

[05-Jun-19 01:17 AM] Alecandro#1179
What about other coins that we might hold in Agama wallet?

[05-Jun-19 01:17 AM] SHossain#0007
if you had a seed created or used in Agama in the last 2-3 months, just move your coin please. any coin you had using that seed

If you have already used Agama in the last 2 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out @Alecandro

[05-Jun-19 01:18 AM] private guy#0631
I have an old private key created 2017 ish, am I safe? Never had seed.

[05-Jun-19 01:19 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

[05-Jun-19 01:20 AM] private guy#0631
@SHossain sounds like some scary stuff is afoot, good luck  with getting the message out there and fixing what needs fixing.

[05-Jun-19 01:20 AM] SHossain#0007
you should be safe

[05-Jun-19 01:20 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Is genesis seed safe? I did enter the passphrase in agama

[05-Jun-19 01:21 AM] SHossain#0007
if you had a seed created or used in Agama in the last 2-3 months, just move your coin please. any coin you had using that seed

[05-Jun-19 01:21 AM] ca333#0118
if you entered it into Agama it is not considered safe anymore. Please move funds @Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô

[05-Jun-19 01:21 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Move to Where?

[05-Jun-19 01:21 AM] SHossain#0007
any new wallet address

[05-Jun-19 01:22 AM] Pixelised#9067
Sorry to add to all the questions. I installed Agama on the desktop yesterday and imported my private key (for Hush). Is it safe?

use paper wallet in a completely offline computer
or use KomdoOceanQT wallet for native mode.

does anyone know why we have to move the funds out?

[05-Jun-19 01:23 AM] meatspoon#7860
what does my windows computer need to recognize the QT file type of 7z?

[05-Jun-19 01:23 AM] Pixelised#9067
7Zip

[05-Jun-19 01:23 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
what meatspoon said

[05-Jun-19 01:23 AM] Riff#5486
I just logged into agama and can‚Äôt connect to any servers.  Can someone help?

[05-Jun-19 01:23 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
how do i open that

[05-Jun-19 01:23 AM] Pixelised#9067
Get a copy of 7Zip application.

[05-Jun-19 01:24 AM] Regnar#6164
Is this only relevant for Seed generation? Any issue with those running full nodes in Agama (ARRR, KMD, etc) ?

[05-Jun-19 01:24 AM] meatspoon#7860
is that right?

Hello i need some help about the recent agama wallet seed issue

[05-Jun-19 01:24 AM] Tek#5253
I used my seed recently

[05-Jun-19 01:25 AM] Pixelised#9067
@SHossain, I installed Agama on the desktop yesterday and imported my private key (for Hush). Are my funds still safe?

[05-Jun-19 01:25 AM] Tek#5253
pls advice safe ubuntu desktop wallet ( 18.10 ) and link ?

[05-Jun-19 01:25 AM] ca333#0118
@Regnar the specific issue seems to be affecting only SPV. BUT it is better to consider whole Agama insecure.

[05-Jun-19 01:25 AM] Tek#5253
I am using SPV

[05-Jun-19 01:25 AM] SHossain#0007
@Pixelised move funds

[05-Jun-19 01:25 AM] Old Man Phil#5934
I sent 10 kmd from veruw/agama wallet for test and it triggered tranaction to this address     RQmyYZT9NJaUu77emecfehonvn54rSyokw

[05-Jun-19 01:25 AM] The Big Wan#6408
Would you say ledger is a fine choice?

[05-Jun-19 01:26 AM] Ocash#5347
can we send funds to Coinomi wallet?

[05-Jun-19 01:26 AM] Old Man Phil#5934
92 kmd

[05-Jun-19 01:26 AM] Pixelised#9067
@SHossain, thanks.

[05-Jun-19 01:26 AM] private guy#0631
What wallet is recommended for SuperNET (unity)?

[05-Jun-19 01:26 AM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Is Verus safe on agama if it is on a seed generated in native mode?

[05-Jun-19 01:26 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
how long will it take komodoOcean to sync the chain

[05-Jun-19 01:27 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
is there enough time for the chain to sync and then for me to safely send the funds? is komodo platform under attack, or is this simply to roll out a new wallet

[05-Jun-19 01:27 AM] Coneyboy9#9043
I created an agama account on my desktop about 8 months ago

[05-Jun-19 01:27 AM] Van#5829
do we need to move funds if using agama native mode?

[05-Jun-19 01:27 AM] jiraymond#5665
@FlyingDutchman if you‚Äôre looking for quick and relatively painless, that magnum wallet suggestion appears to have worked cleanly for me

[05-Jun-19 01:27 AM] Coneyboy9#9043
on lite mode

[05-Jun-19 01:27 AM] ca333#0118
@FlyingDutchman you can send the coins to the komodoOcean wallet before it completes the sync. just make sure you always have a secure backup of your private-keys/wallet-file.

[05-Jun-19 01:28 AM] Alright#0419
@The Big Wan ledger is fine 
@Ocash Coinomi is closed source, we can't be sure it's not also affected 
@private guy use KMD paper wallet and send funds there, you can later import it to SUPERNET
@Bernz - Selling LABS VRSC's Agama is unaffected, but if you used the seed in Agama, move the funds. Would recommend moving it anyway though.

[05-Jun-19 01:28 AM] Tek#5253
can top developers comfirm magnum wallet is safe?

[05-Jun-19 01:28 AM] ca333#0118
@Coneyboy9 did you use it again in the last 7 months?

[05-Jun-19 01:28 AM] TSW#6522
Just logged in and ALL KMD IS GONE and showing no history, but it is registered on the blockchain

[05-Jun-19 01:28 AM] meatspoon#7860
@SHossain  I downloaded and installed the 7-Zip that you linked to but my computer still isnt recognizing the file type

[05-Jun-19 01:28 AM] Alright#0419
@Tek it's closed source, we can't know for sure

[05-Jun-19 01:29 AM] SHossain#0007
@meatspoon right-click on the file and extract

[05-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Tek#5253
@Alright do you recommend just a paper wallet?

[05-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Coneyboy9#9043
yeah I been claiming interest  and also buying and adding kmd  to it every month

[05-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Alright#0419
paper wallet, KomodoOceanQT or komodo-cli

[05-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Van#5829
is the native mode safe or we need to move funds as well?

[05-Jun-19 01:29 AM] LordTricky#7840
i use spv with private key / wif... am i screwwed?

[05-Jun-19 01:29 AM] ca333#0118
@TSW - which version are you using?

[05-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Tek#5253
can KomodoOceanQT  run in "light mode"

[05-Jun-19 01:30 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
i cant find the wallet file for ocean. Do i need to generate one or is it pregenerated? if i need to generate, how do i do that

[05-Jun-19 01:30 AM] Coneyboy9#9043
should I send them all to my binance account?

[05-Jun-19 01:30 AM] Alright#0419
@Van Native is not affected, but would recommend moving them anyway.

@Tek no it's a native wallet, you can generate a new address immediately on it without syncing though

[05-Jun-19 01:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ca333 this is not for everybody, but this tool I wrote might be useful for KMD to use or suggest to some people, it lets you make seed phrases on the CLI very simply: `https://github.com/leto/trezor-crypto/commit/edacc1c8f4022e0b017ca0bc22b2145989f34ec7`

[05-Jun-19 01:31 AM] TSW#6522
@ca333  V.0.3.5-beta

[05-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Dark#6473
so agama wallet compromised ?

[05-Jun-19 01:32 AM] meatspoon#7860
OK, downloaded Ocean.... I can safely say it doesnt seem intuitive....

[05-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Alright#0419
@Coneyboy9 sending to an exchange is not a bad option, but just a reminder...  "not your keys, not your coins"

[05-Jun-19 01:32 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
i cant figure out how to use ocean

[05-Jun-19 01:32 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
the receive window is weird

[05-Jun-19 01:32 AM] meatspoon#7860
seriously

[05-Jun-19 01:32 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
i cant find the wallets

[05-Jun-19 01:32 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
files

[05-Jun-19 01:32 AM] LordTricky#7840
v0.3.3a-beta safe?

[05-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Tek#5253
maybe i should just send it all to binance like coney suggests lmao

[05-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Tek#5253
im on v0.3.6b-beta

[05-Jun-19 01:33 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
The two most important questions: will binance be affected by this?, and how short term is this situation? if it is ver long term binance may not be secure

[05-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Riff#5486
Can anyone help?   I my agama is just saying connection error and I can‚Äôt move my coins

[05-Jun-19 01:33 AM] SHossain#0007
which version?

[05-Jun-19 01:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
This is a good time to learn a little more about wallet safety and maintenance, which keeps all your bags safe

[05-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Tek#5253
@Riff yeah uh you need a recent verison I had to change my wallet too last week

[05-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Tek#5253
then i imported my seed

[05-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Tek#5253
now im fucking not safe

[05-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Tek#5253
reeeeeeee

[05-Jun-19 01:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Riff sounds like you are on an older version of agama

[05-Jun-19 01:34 AM] deathsgrip#5269
So I can‚Äôt login to agama wallet to move funds?

[05-Jun-19 01:34 AM] jiraymond#5665
Not to be glib but keeping funds in Agama and off an exchange _was_ supposed to be the safe option
