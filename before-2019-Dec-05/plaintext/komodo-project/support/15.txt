[slack] <rhex1> How do I log out of one kmd wallet and in to another?

[13-Jul-18 11:38 AM] gcharang#6833
If you mean in Agama wallet - lite mode, to get a new address - Generate a new seed. 
Also come to Discord. Slack might be shutdown anyday now. https://discord.gg/SCdf4eh

[13-Jul-18 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <rhex1> No native mode. My brother tried to recreate wallet from seed but we suspect he made a typo and ended up in another wallet basically

[13-Jul-18 11:39 AM] gcharang#6833
seed is used only in lite mode

[13-Jul-18 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <rhex1> hmm he had a long passphrase written down

[13-Jul-18 11:40 AM] gcharang#6833
That means he is using lite mode.

Want to check few things related to BarterDex:
1. Does it (or going to) support trading of Ethereum testnet  (Ropsten, Rinkeby etc.) tokens?
2. If the answer of previous question is yes, than will BarterDex support trading of Ethereum main network and test network tokens in same system?
3. Is there test version of BarterDex? If yes, than does it only support trading of tokens of test networks or also support trading of tokens of main networks (e.g. tokens of main Ethereum network).
Thanks in advance!

[14-Jul-18 09:41 PM] SHossain#0007
@Ara BarterDEX does work with testnet and mainnet ETH/ERC20 tokens.

Having an issue accessing an address in spv mode.  I am not getting the correct address when I enter my private key.  When I ctrl-v the same string in to the paper wallet generator it correctly gives me my public key.

[15-Jul-18 08:55 AM] Bowdo#4054
Not particularly worried, just seems odd

[15-Jul-18 08:56 AM] Bowdo#4054

So here's a silly question for ya... I figured I'd test the "you own your private keys" mantra of BarterDex and add my privkey to Agama. Worked like a charm (https://www.reddit.com/r/komodoplatform/comments/7tbtt3/using_your_komodo_privatekeys_on_barterdex/). But then I realized, if I claim Komodo rewards now using Agama (native mode), all of my beautiful UTXOs will be gone and I'll have to start over! So... can I _remove_ privkeys from Agama wallet in any way? Or do I just have to start a brand new seed in either BarterDex or Agama and use that from now on?

[16-Jul-18 09:04 PM] Hermes#6934
When you say remove private keys from Agama are you referring to exporting your private keys that's always possible

[16-Jul-18 09:10 PM] Hermes#6934
@JvdP  You want to delist the private keys from a native wallet so that you don't have that address imported anymore?

[17-Jul-18 12:55 AM] Nabob#5004
in native mode, when you claim rewards, remaining amount move to changed address, utxo's are change which create on address, instead after claim, you can do another self transactionof all your amount to your original address will solve your query

No, you cannot delete your private keys or address  on native mode.

[17-Jul-18 06:34 AM] JvdP#8992
@Hermes, yes delist 'em, because the Nabob solution I would have to repeat every time I claimed rewards. But I think it's easier to just make a new BD or Agama seed and work from there üòÉ

[17-Jul-18 06:35 AM] JvdP#8992
And anyway, I now know for sure that the privkeys really are mine and can be extracted (as promised of course). It doesn't hurt to be able to verify - learning is part of why I'm in crypto in the first place.

[17-Jul-18 06:36 AM] JvdP#8992
Btw, my BD interface has been like this for a couple of weeks now, when adding coins:

Both dev and master branch are like this, and Electrum servers can't be found for anything. I suppose it's known and being worked on, but figured I'd let you know.

Restart Barterdex
