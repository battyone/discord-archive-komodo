Does it mean thats the peers current block?

[06-Aug-18 07:20 PM] CryptoWrench#6022
Or the block they started their wallet at ?

[06-Aug-18 08:26 PM] Hermes#6934
That's correct @CryptoWrench that's where the block starts loading

[06-Aug-18 08:26 PM] CryptoWrench#6022
okay so its not what block the wallet is actually on

[06-Aug-18 08:27 PM] CryptoWrench#6022
i was wondering if i was connected to peers that are like 10 blocks behind or something

[06-Aug-18 08:42 PM] Hermes#6934
no that will be your current block

is my current block?

[06-Aug-18 09:56 PM] Hermes#6934
"blocks" : 186773, is the current block that you are loading
    "longestchain" : 308867, is the last block that has been added to the network

[07-Aug-18 07:03 PM] Hermes#6934
Hi there can you explain a little bit more about the issue? Do you have Hyperdex not being able to login can you show us the error message you get?

[07-Aug-18 07:03 PM] Hermes#6934
If your connection has an issue it will start showing some electrum server errors

[07-Aug-18 07:03 PM] Hermes#6934
Also which version of Hyperdex you currently have?

[07-Aug-18 07:04 PM] modereck#4269
No hay error, solo que no me inicia sesion, lleva iniciando sesion un buen rato

no tienes barterdex o market maker corriendo ?

[07-Aug-18 07:08 PM] Hermes#6934
revisa de repente el task manager a ver si marketmaker esta corriendo

[07-Aug-18 07:08 PM] Hermes#6934
si eso no funciona quizas debas intentar una instalacion nueva

[07-Aug-18 07:08 PM] Hermes#6934
borrando la carpeta de Hyperdex siempre y cuando no tengas ningun swap pendiente o atascado

[07-Aug-18 07:09 PM] Hermes#6934
en %appdata% borrarias Hyperdex y luego intenta una nueva instalacion.

[07-Aug-18 07:10 PM] modereck#4269
Antes habia iniciado barterdex y se me habia quedado igual, no encuentro el proceso voy a intentar reiniciando el ordenador

[07-Aug-18 07:20 PM] modereck#4269
ahora funciona, es la primera vez que lo uso y no me permitia el firewall ni el antivirus iniciarlo

Hi, for some reason my virus scan classifies Agama's osx-files as harmful categorizing them as adware.mac.generic. Any info on this?

@pbca26

[10-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Keytothegate#8453
Hmm actually think they are pretty much harmless but still

[10-Aug-18 02:42 PM] Nabob#5004
that alert is on windows right, those files going to be  removed in our future, false positive

[10-Aug-18 02:52 PM] Hermes#6934
@Keytothegate  those files are from others binaries it can that it detected linux and mac binaries on the file

[10-Aug-18 08:10 PM] Keytothegate#8453
@Nabob yep windows

[10-Aug-18 09:03 PM] Hermes#6934
most likely this is the reason Windows will detect the other OS binaries sometimes as a false positive, that will be taken out in future releases

[10-Aug-18 10:30 PM] jar#6117
Hi I‚Äôm having trouble setting up the agama Mac wallet. It says existing installation detected. Then I can hit uninstall or re-install. I‚Äôve tried both and both lead to ‚Äúerror running open‚Äù....‚Äùuninstall-agama.app does not exist. the app will exit now‚Äù

how to post sell to orderbook in barterdex
every i sell coin, after logout my orderbook disappear, im using barterdex v 1.1.1 rc

[11-Aug-18 11:31 AM] AndronicusBass#7784
you need to keep it open unless you choose marketmaker

[11-Aug-18 12:03 PM] Nabob#5004
Sell request will be there for 1 min on orderbook, If it never executed, It expires @xcite

[11-Aug-18 12:04 PM] xcite#5750
@Nabob ok

[11-Aug-18 12:04 PM] xcite#5750
how to make it for a long time

[11-Aug-18 12:04 PM] Nabob#5004
@AndronicusBass  Make sure in your conf file has `maxconnections=1` Untill it sync fully

[11-Aug-18 12:07 PM] Nabob#5004
You can use `setprice`  , eventually you have to keep your marketmaker running 
check documentation
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/barterDEX/barterDEX-API.html?highlight=setprice#setprice

[11-Aug-18 12:09 PM] AndronicusBass#7784
Thanks @Nabob however, conf file already has that. I have no idea why it's using so much data to sync. Think I will try on another computer to see if its this one, eliminate all possibilities.

[11-Aug-18 04:07 PM] Hermes#6934
@AndronicusBass  You have Agama 2.41 right?

[11-Aug-18 04:07 PM] Hermes#6934
The current longest chain is around 960,000

I just updated to barterdex 1.1.1rc

[11-Aug-18 06:31 PM] jspook16#3059
looks like i dont have the "explorers" directory in ../.BarterDex/CoinsDB/explorers/[coin]
anyone know what this is about?

[11-Aug-18 06:31 PM] jspook16#3059
when i log I am unable to add any coins in electrum

[11-Aug-18 06:32 PM] jspook16#3059
or native for that matter

[11-Aug-18 06:33 PM] Hermes#6934
Windows version?

[11-Aug-18 06:34 PM] Hermes#6934
I will try a fresh installation and see if it still have this issue

[11-Aug-18 06:34 PM] Hermes#6934
do you have any stuck or pending swap?

[11-Aug-18 06:35 PM] jspook16#3059
linux....i updated via npm

[11-Aug-18 06:35 PM] jspook16#3059
I didnt have any pending or stuck swaps .....i had some failed though from several days ago

[11-Aug-18 06:44 PM] Hermes#6934
hmmm on linux I will suggest erasing the Barterdex folder it should be located in your root

[11-Aug-18 06:44 PM] Hermes#6934
And doing a clean installation

[11-Aug-18 06:46 PM] Hermes#6934
Also if you can find the pair on the Hyperdex I will recommend using it instead of Barterdex is easier and more responsive

isnt hyperdex still limited to buy orders only?

[11-Aug-18 06:59 PM] jspook16#3059
I ended up downloading the barterdex tar file....that works

[11-Aug-18 06:59 PM] jspook16#3059
thanks

[11-Aug-18 07:11 PM] jspook16#3059
I think i realize what the issue was. The latest Bdex requires you to add coins to your local db before being able to add them to your portfolio.

[11-Aug-18 07:15 PM] Hermes#6934
In the Hyperdex you are seeing the same orders as in Barterdex , you can switch  the side of the pair you want to be.

[11-Aug-18 07:19 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah but i thought your order was either filled or cancelled when using hyperdex

Hello and Good Afternoon all. I am here to ask for help from you guys on the issue i am facing. I have been trying to Sync Chainzilla on Agama in Native mode. I am using the latest .41 beta version. At first it starts okay but get's stuck (looses all connections) at 47,xx%

have tried reindexing it, rescan, delete directory without or without wallet.dat and conf files.
but somehow it stays and stuck everytime it reaches block "19758"
Help would be really appreciated. here is a screenshot of the agama stuck at that point

I have some scripts that were getting kmd balances and reward balance amounts from atomicexplorer using the GET api.....that hasn't been working for a while now. Is that no longer going to be supported?

[13-Aug-18 03:19 AM] Hermes#6934
Hi there you were using it on Linux? which API didn't worked exactly ?

[13-Aug-18 03:47 AM] jspook16#3059
GET api

[13-Aug-18 03:47 AM] jspook16#3059

It works for me, Naming convention changed recently, Please use below url

Hi - i have run into a bit of an issue - Back last year i set up a new 12 phrase seed via BarterDex (Sep17 time). I have used ever since and have small amounts of various coins sitting on that seed. Some of the electrum wallets don't work in Barterdex (BTG / LTC)  so went to create a wallet elsewhere via BIP39 to be able to access the funds. But when i try and use the seed in a different wallet via seed or BIP39 i get errors / invalid mnemonic. tried for other 12 phrase test seeds and works fine - just issues with the seed with my funds on it! Any ideas that could assist - many thanks - Miles

[13-Aug-18 04:24 PM] miles#6381
actually - the more i read - the more i don't really know where to start trying to solve this one!! not sure its worth the headache / risks at the mo - are there any plans to have the BTG and LTC electrum wallets fixed in BDex?

[13-Aug-18 05:06 PM] Hermes#6934
Just in case to have a complete understanding could you please send us a report of the coins you are not able to view on Barterdex? I would also try using this guide to extract the private keys for each coin just in case you need to manage the funds shortly https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/299827203/How+to+retrieve+Private+key+from+BarterDEX  ,

[13-Aug-18 05:07 PM] Hermes#6934
Please let us know in the ticket at support@komodoplatform.com the exact coins you are facing issues in order to test it , sometimes the coin developers have to do an update from their side , Also give us the Barterdex version you are using and the OS version
