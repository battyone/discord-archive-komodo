Just getting back from vacation and trying to sort through all the info. Is there a good wallet to use that has the staking built into it that is recommended? Thanks in advance.

[13-Jun-19 02:44 PM] PTYX#6840
@antonio8 checkout the pinned message on this channel. The Verus Agama is likely the best option for desktop.

[13-Jun-19 02:44 PM] PTYX#6840
The ledger nano s is also available and it supports KMD rewards.

[13-Jun-19 02:45 PM] antonio8#3642
@PTYX, thanks. I'll look into the Verus as I don't have the nano.

Hello. Please help. I opened the old Agama wallet, and saw the fractional balance. However, as soon as it shows the dashboard, the wallet turns blank, and I cannot make any transactions. How can I make the required tx to send the balance to my new Agama wallet? Thanks.

hi - trying move my Chips dust to new  safe address using Verus Agama  and getting invalid pub address error - happening in both (O.5.7 and 0.6.0) Any suggestions?

[14-Jun-19 12:12 AM] kalfster#2695
@jl777c  @SHossain  @gcharang   and the rest of the Komodo team; recently and in short succession i was hit by the Cryptopia bankruptcy (loss),  the Binance hack (no loss), the Poloniex Margin Lending Pool Losses (part loss) and the Agama issue. Before that there were more  hacks/scams etc. You can understand this caused tremendous amounts of stress. I want to thoroughly thank you and your team for taking away a huge part of this stress with the actions you took, the quick follow up and the  excellent communications. I received my coins back and am as impressed as i am thankful. You restored some of the faith in crypto that i had lost in recent years ! Very excited to see what the Komodo project will bring in the future and  thanks again !

Can someone explain why, when I send some KMD to an address, my whole balance is sent to a completely new address? And when that happens, the interest/reward that was accumulating is gone?

To stake?

[14-Jun-19 12:10 PM] gcharang#6833
@ionstar the new address is called a change address and that is how native mode works (you have to backup the wallet.dat file regularly)
your rewards didn't disappear. They are claimed and added to the remaining balance in the change address

[14-Jun-19 12:12 PM] ionstar#5362
Is that visible on the blockchain somewhere? Because I can't seem to add it up, while I usually can when claiming the interest. For example, I just sent my whol ebalance back to the original address, and the small interest that was remaining was put in the address I was transferring away from.

[14-Jun-19 12:12 PM] ionstar#5362
But somehow the interest that was built up until a few hours ago is nowhere to be found./

[14-Jun-19 12:14 PM] dxer666#8963
why i get invalid public address when i want send btc? in verus agama

[14-Jun-19 12:19 PM] gcharang#6833
@ionstar you can search the address you are sending from in the explorer: kmdexplorer.io

[14-Jun-19 12:21 PM] ionstar#5362
I have checked, but the interest is not found there. It's only about 2.4KMd, but it shoul dbe visible somewhere

[14-Jun-19 12:32 PM] gcharang#6833
@ionstar dm me the address, I can check

hi, I'm just reading about the vulnerability, and i don't know if i got lucky but my funds are still in my address, so I'm following the guide to move the funds to a new address, would the latest release from https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases be ok to use instead of the advised PBaaS release?

@pand that one is OK, but some users have reported seed input issues

thx @gcharang  can you tell what kind of issues?

[14-Jun-19 12:37 PM] gcharang#6833
@pand not able to input the entire seed or some part of it gets truncated and opens a different address
0.6.0 is secure and it works, any reason you don't want to use ut?

@pand i'm using the pbaas version myself when I moved away from Komodo's agama version.

[14-Jun-19 12:40 PM] pand#8752
thx for the info @gcharang, no specific reason, i just prefer to use the latest release. thx @ionstar  for the feedback

[14-Jun-19 12:45 PM] pand#8752
btw just out of curiosity, does having my funds still on my address mean that my seed wasn't harvested?

[14-Jun-19 12:46 PM] ionstar#5362
@pand I didnt take a chance on that and simply moved it. I was using native mode though, maybe thats why my balance was still there, but better safe than sorry.

[14-Jun-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but if you used komodo agama, better to transfer to secure address

[14-Jun-19 12:49 PM] pand#8752

K.  just checking.  I voted with the compromised address last month.  Now with compromised funds tranferred to the new address, we don't get rewards, right.  So i know not to expect for it..  So it happen for All?  The folks not affected by the vulnerability.. who voted  also will not get rewards from the notary vote?  thanks.

[14-Jun-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, you voted for someone that paid out kickbacks?

[14-Jun-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
probably they will send to old address and if you are fast, you can collect them

Hey, I found out last weekend that the balance for my wallet was sent to the sweep address. I submitted a claim for my KMD following the instructions provided. I haven't yet seen any dust sent to my old address. Am I supposed to just check the KMD explorer daily to see when it arrives or will I get a notification on here (I gave my discord username on the form).

[14-Jun-19 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
all dust has already been sent. DM me your address

[14-Jun-19 07:03 PM] SHossain#0007

[15-Jun-19 07:26 AM] Dirty Moe#2091
Hi all, I haven't received my kmd funds but its most likely due to two claims. I was unable to update the first claim and i changed the receive address as the binance wallet was not working. I have sent the dust to the 2nd address. What would be the eta of getting my funds back?

[15-Jun-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
DM me your address

[15-Jun-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
it is funny, people tend to not do all the steps for a week, then the moment they do it, they wonder why it isnt processed in realtime. i have to run the refund process manually and only do it daily, so if you miss the cutoff, it needs to wait till the next day

[15-Jun-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so the eta is the next day after all the claim process is completed

[15-Jun-19 08:03 AM] Dirty Moe#2091
I did the the first form within 2 days and then refilled over a week ago. Will send you a dm now.

[15-Jun-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
all pending KMD refunds that were properly filled out has been processed

[15-Jun-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
about 90% of funds has been returned

[15-Jun-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
of that about 8% are just waiting for the users to send the smartdust from old address to new address

[15-Jun-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
only about 2% scattered in relatively small addresses are unclaimed, this is a fantastic turnout by everybody. thanks for the quick response to filing the claims, that was an important part of the process

[15-Jun-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
all during this, the team has been tirelessly working on getting the new release out so the exchanges can reopen!
