Can anyone sync NINJA?

[05-Jun-19 11:21 AM] amart89#3711
in the form the Addr is the address where the funds were moved or our address from where it was moved?

[05-Jun-19 11:21 AM] Bowdo#4054
Just to check, I have kmd that I have been accessing via native mode agama (win 10).  Funds are currently there.    Am I cool to just open it up as normal and send to brand new paper wallet?

[05-Jun-19 11:26 AM] fern#2676
Can we confirm these are two of the safe addresses RWXmNq2EgDgknZs2uaJ3ETs2nnhwqczAtQ and RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF ?

[05-Jun-19 11:27 AM] OvidiuC#5232
Ii i have agama by komodo already installed, can i just install agama by verus with no problem?

is there a reason i should be quick with my claim, because i am actually very willing to wait and do the process through DM with a member of the team @SHossain

[05-Jun-19 11:29 AM] cascrypto#8206
is this the one for windows or do i need sha?

[05-Jun-19 11:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF` is safe address. Please fill in form, Discord is not the most efficient way to check etc.
Other addresses may be change addresses where rewards went. They should also be swept

[05-Jun-19 11:29 AM] SHossain#0007
@crumb wait for it then

[05-Jun-19 11:29 AM] crumb#2550
ok. cool

[05-Jun-19 11:29 AM] gcharang#6833
@fern safe address: RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF
RWXmNq2EgDgknZs2uaJ3ETs2nnhwqczAtQ seems to be intermediate address

[05-Jun-19 11:29 AM] willofleo#7505

competing claims will undergo a secondary verification process

[05-Jun-19 11:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@willofleo I assume once all claims are filed you will be contacted to prove you have or had the privkeys to the wallets mentioned

[05-Jun-19 11:36 AM] Bastol#5205
I had some ETH on my agama wallet, when i try to send to safe wallet every transaction fails with "out of gas", what can i do ?

[05-Jun-19 11:38 AM] Zach#9973
So if our coins were transferred to this "Safe address" RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF then once we fill out the form we should eventually get the coins back?

[05-Jun-19 11:38 AM] Entity#5862
This looks like a bad joke

[05-Jun-19 11:39 AM] Entity#5862
I can claim other coins?

[05-Jun-19 11:39 AM] gcharang#6833
@Zach yes

[05-Jun-19 11:39 AM] Entity#5862
How to prove its me?

[05-Jun-19 11:39 AM] gcharang#6833
@Entity you can sign with your old seed

[05-Jun-19 11:39 AM] Entity#5862
Those old seeds, were stolen correct, so anyone who got my old seed can now claim my coins?

[05-Jun-19 11:39 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@Bastol can you try to set a higher gas ?

[05-Jun-19 11:40 AM] Entity#5862
How is that secure, Seed stolen, "sign with old seed" uhm oke...

[05-Jun-19 11:40 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Entity not all stolen, more precaution. So far don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs had anything stolen

[05-Jun-19 11:40 AM] Oszy#5734
they are not stolen, funds were moved For You by the team before they get stolen

[05-Jun-19 11:40 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Only those funds sweeped by devs have the form fill out

[05-Jun-19 11:40 AM] Entity#5862
So no one can ever get access to the seeds

[05-Jun-19 11:40 AM] Entity#5862
Via the same exploit?

[05-Jun-19 11:40 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
So if a hacker had all of them doubt they could just sweep and message the team saying they own all addresses

[05-Jun-19 11:41 AM] Entity#5862
Well the hacker could publish the entire list

[05-Jun-19 11:41 AM] Entity#5862
And all hodlers are fed

[05-Jun-19 11:41 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I‚Äôm sure the team has this sorted out and will be doing it by hand and dm

[05-Jun-19 11:41 AM] Entity#5862
No way to prove who is who

Guys, all my funds are gone; what should I know so far?

[05-Jun-19 11:42 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Once new wallet comes out, import new priv key to access chainzilla

[05-Jun-19 11:42 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@John the Cashist check which address they went to

[05-Jun-19 11:42 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Devs used exploit to get vulnerable funds out and safekeepings

[05-Jun-19 11:42 AM] Bastol#5205
@PHBA2061 any way to do that on agama mobile ? desktop will only show white screen

[05-Jun-19 11:43 AM] Pringle#4720
@Crabby Paddy Ok, thanks for the heads up

[05-Jun-19 11:43 AM] John the Cashist#7046
how can I tell who took them from just ;looking at the address they went to?

[05-Jun-19 11:43 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
yeah, check where they went, or follow it (may be 2 or 3 sends) the dev address is posted above to double check

[05-Jun-19 11:46 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
yep

[05-Jun-19 11:46 AM] Oszy#5734
there is no hacker, and you were asked to move funds before anyone can  find out what the vulnerability is.

^ from what i can see, no one has been compromised yet, no on discord yet anyway. Most people panicking have had the funds moved to safe address

[05-Jun-19 11:46 AM] John the Cashist#7046
shit dude, but moving all of my funds without permission is a bit scary; how can they even do that?

[05-Jun-19 11:46 AM] Entity#5862
Seed stolen, seed will be used to identify true owner of address ...

[05-Jun-19 11:47 AM] Entity#5862
Oke?

[05-Jun-19 11:47 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
There was an exploit found @John the Cashist   to do with the seed function on agama

[05-Jun-19 11:47 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
so the team used the same exploit before a malicious actor could
