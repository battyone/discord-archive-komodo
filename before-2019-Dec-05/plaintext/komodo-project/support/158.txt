wallet.dat for same coin works without changing

[03-Jul-19 03:34 PM] CryptoPope#3579
my ZEX is in the AGAMA wallet.  Looking in the AppData folder I do not see a wallet.dat.  Is exporting within the AGAMA wallet what you're referring to?

[03-Jul-19 03:41 PM] SHossain#0007
reading your first post and the link i posed for you, you come you can't get a wif key?
```
CryptoPopeToday at 16:18
running the agama 0.3.2a wallet.  I'm attempting to get priv keys under settings.  I've selected the ZEX coin and have clicked "Fetch Key's.  How long should it take to show these keys?
```

[03-Jul-19 03:41 PM] SHossain#0007
the guide shows exactly how to get your private key for any address in native mode

[03-Jul-19 03:42 PM] CryptoPope#3579
wif key = priv key correct?  If so I have that.

[03-Jul-19 03:42 PM] SHossain#0007
wif key = priv key

[03-Jul-19 03:42 PM] CryptoPope#3579
ok

[03-Jul-19 03:43 PM] SHossain#0007
that's in the title of the article i posted **Export Private Keys (WIF)**

[03-Jul-19 03:43 PM] CryptoPope#3579
do I take the "key" to the DO wallet?

[03-Jul-19 03:44 PM] CryptoPope#3579
ok, thanks.

[03-Jul-19 03:45 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Can the existence of a wallet.dat file interfere with seed word/PIN entry. In other words if I move the wallet.dat somewhere else might I get different results in a)Native mode or b) quick mode?

[03-Jul-19 03:45 PM] CryptoPope#3579
do you recommend waiting for the DO wallet to complete the sync prior to importing?

[03-Jul-19 03:46 PM] SHossain#0007
@TheFalseProfit Lite mode and Native mode are completely different and they DO NOT interfare with each other

[03-Jul-19 03:47 PM] SHossain#0007
@CryptoPope import keys after your wallet is 100% in sync

I have my Native mode synched but every time I start it up it takes over an hour before it finishes "loading  data please wait". I'm assuming that is normal.

[03-Jul-19 03:51 PM] SHossain#0007
that is normal if you use native mode occassionally. every time you start it has to sync remaining blocks

[03-Jul-19 10:08 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Why does agama always have a pre-filled PIN Name when logging in that seemingly cannot be changed? There's no wallet.dat present if that matters.

[03-Jul-19 10:09 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Where is it getting that pre-fill PIN from?

[03-Jul-19 10:46 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
I just used the cross asset tool on my old compromised wallet and discovered I have NINJA, PIZZA and VOTE2019. I already received my KMD in a new address. What do I do with these?

[03-Jul-19 10:46 PM] CryptoPope#3579
Which wallet if preferred to claim the RFOX drop?

[03-Jul-19 10:52 PM] CryptoPope#3579
I'm syncing the Komodo Ocean wallet but it's taking fooorrreeevverrrr.

[03-Jul-19 10:53 PM] CryptoPope#3579
Thought I would give the Agama 0.5.7-3 a try.

[03-Jul-19 10:55 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
You are not kidding. I presume you have used the bootstrap here: https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php

I do not...never attempted that method before.

[03-Jul-19 11:04 PM] CryptoPope#3579
once downloaded what would I do with the file?

[03-Jul-19 11:04 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Is it true that if I enter the seed words correctly it will ALWAYS show the same address in Lite Mode? Or can Seed words be associated with many address's? Can I assume that if the address is different I MUST have mis-entered the Seed words?

[03-Jul-19 11:08 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Download the 10.9GB file. Use 7-zip to unzip. I then used Winrar to  unzip the next bit. Move  or copy the two folders to the komodo folder in C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Roaming\Komodo overwriting the original folders. %appdata%komodo may also get you there.

[03-Jul-19 11:09 PM] CryptoPope#3579
noted for future, thank you.  I'm halfway through the sync in the qt.  I'll just let it run.

[03-Jul-19 11:11 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
That info was for  Agama 0.5.7-3. I have no idea whether the same blockchain works in Ocean but imagine it does. Still takes ages even after using the bootstrap. I'm not having a good day üòÉ

For the people that received their funds back from KMD hack how long did it take after you submitted the form, anybody contacted you or it's an automatic process? I've completed two forms now because I'm pretty sure I had screwed up the first one (3weeks ago), It's been over a week that I filled the second form and still no tokens. Anybody having the same issue? Any way to get a hold of somebody to help me out? Thanks for advice!

[04-Jul-19 04:15 AM] jl777c#5810

On the login page of Agama Verus I have a PIN field which is autofilled and a password field. Where do I get this password because at no stage have I seen any mention of a password?

[04-Jul-19 01:27 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
What is going on with these address's? I get different address's seemingly randomly when logging into Lite Mode... sometimes the same one, sometimes not. How do I access my previously shown address's?

[04-Jul-19 01:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
same private key = same address

[04-Jul-19 01:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
probably a little change in your private key when typing

[04-Jul-19 01:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or a space in the end etc

[04-Jul-19 01:33 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Nope. Guaranteed the right key. I've been messing about with this for hours now. Private key is not the password is not the wif is not the seed is not the key. Multiple installations to test some of this. Nomenclature and ergonomics is the problem.

[04-Jul-19 02:02 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
same private key=same address is correct. It's getting back to the same address without a private key that's the issue.

[04-Jul-19 02:03 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Nope. Guaranteed the right key I meant seed not key.

[04-Jul-19 02:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
hmm without a privkey, then how do you log in?

[04-Jul-19 02:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
native mode?

[04-Jul-19 02:27 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
I have my seed which initially gave me an address and not realising I need the private key to get back to it I closed the wallet and used the address in Lite Mode. Now I cannot find a way to access that same address.

[04-Jul-19 02:31 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
I would have thought that the seed would be enough for anything. But I haven't been able to do it.

[04-Jul-19 02:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But you have the seed for the original address?

[04-Jul-19 02:38 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Yes

[04-Jul-19 02:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
try to create a new wallet with new pin and use original pin

[04-Jul-19 02:41 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
By original PIN I assume you mean Seed encrypt key?

[04-Jul-19 02:42 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
or custom PIN file name?

Hello! I was trying to install the komodo wallet on mac using this guide ( https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029930-install-komodoocean-on-mac ) I followed all the instruction but once I open the komodo-qt-mac file it gives me: Error: Cannot parse configuration file: Missing komodo.conf. Only use key=value syntax.

[05-Jul-19 11:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Plus it can do lite mode not have to download everything

[05-Jul-19 11:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes you can but instead of a button to "claim" in the GUI, you just send all the funds to yourself

[05-Jul-19 11:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Which is what the script did when you clicked the claim button anyway

[05-Jul-19 11:59 AM] palfrun#5361
