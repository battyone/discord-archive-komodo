@SHossain i can't log into the web wallet and when i do log into the desktop version it won't let me kmd

[05-Jun-19 04:59 AM] SVET5#3137
if that so, safest option would be moving to Ledger since Im a HODLER. Hope Ledger integration will implemented soon

[05-Jun-19 05:00 AM] n64#7103
@SHossain sorry I came in late...using vrsc mode I don’t see my kmd balances...got a guide I can use?

Can i move the funds to a different seed with agama lite ?

[05-Jun-19 05:02 AM] dxer666#8963
i created seed 1 years ago. should i change it?

[05-Jun-19 05:03 AM] n64#7103
mine's also a pretty old seed, but i used it last month to claim rewards

[05-Jun-19 05:03 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@dxer666 

The issue seems to be only for seeds either created or used within the last 4 months. If you have either used or created your seed with Agama within that time, please move your funds.

[05-Jun-19 05:05 AM] SHossain#0007
@jeffjam do not create any wallet address with official agama. use Verus version

[05-Jun-19 05:05 AM] SHossain#0007
If you have already used Agama in the last 2 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php

**How to Generate new address quickly?**
- Use Paper Wallet - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPaperWalletGenerator/archive/master.zip
- Use Verus version of Agama which is not affected -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
1. Start VRSC Lite mode
2. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  **Keed the seed safely backedup** (make a note of that address)

**Alternative method to generate new address**
- Use native mode (best to use CLI) - Safest - Use bootstrap from here if you like https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php
- Use coinbin (may not be most secure as it's web) - https://deckersu.github.io/coinbin/#newAddress

**How to send funds to the new address?**
Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later.
0. If you have Agama 0.3.5 or 0.3.6b, use that to send funds out or
1. Quickest - Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/
2.  You can also use this guide to send all KMD and assetchains to new address. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama

**Where to send funds?**
- Another address created by Verus Agama or native mode
- Ledger wallet
- CEX (they are not affected but if you want to)

[05-Jun-19 05:07 AM] t0sma#0368
As I understand ARRR are dahe on Agama because it's native mode. Correct?

[05-Jun-19 05:07 AM] SHossain#0007
