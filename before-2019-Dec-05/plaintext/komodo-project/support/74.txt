Same for Chameleon. So they wouldn't need to develop their own ledger app. We can piggy back of the kmd app

[18-Feb-19 09:06 PM] PTYX#6840
As far as I know ledger isn't available in Agama so I can't answer that last question

[18-Feb-19 09:06 PM] riseandfall#3726
It should be the recommended option (to use the same keys as for Komodo) to my opinion.

[18-Feb-19 09:06 PM] PTYX#6840
Agreed

[18-Feb-19 09:07 PM] PTYX#6840
They should be the same keys since they are based on the mnemonic seed

[18-Feb-19 09:07 PM] PTYX#6840
The only thing you can change is the derivation path but if it's the normal one you get the same addresses

[18-Feb-19 09:07 PM] PTYX#6840
With Magnum you don't generate new addresses everytime you make a transaction. I believe with ledger it cycles through new addresses but you can recover them all with the same seed

[18-Feb-19 09:07 PM] riseandfall#3726
Exactly....and even considering there are 5000 different chains on KMD the risk of collision is hugely small

[18-Feb-19 09:08 PM] PTYX#6840
So you can use one privatekey on all kmd chains

[18-Feb-19 09:08 PM] PTYX#6840
If you don't generate change addresses it would mean one seed accesses funds in all chains

[18-Feb-19 09:09 PM] riseandfall#3726
It's also interesting to play with the derivations paths

[18-Feb-19 09:09 PM] PTYX#6840
If you use the privatekey in a native wallet though and generate a change address, you can't recover it with the mnemonic seed. You need the privatekey

[18-Feb-19 09:10 PM] PTYX#6840
I've been learning more about the paths recently. I've been playing with a non custodial payment processor

[18-Feb-19 09:10 PM] riseandfall#3726
But what I wanted to say is that KMD  offers security (by dPOW), a integrated wallet (with Agama) and also ease of use (because users can use their ledger device for any new asset)....no need to do specific development for that

[18-Feb-19 09:11 PM] riseandfall#3726
It's important this last point

[18-Feb-19 09:12 PM] riseandfall#3726
Before you talked to me I was thinking about some prefixes to identify the chains...but maybe playing with derivation paths is a good option....but as you said there is something even more simple : using the same keying system as Komodo main chain

[18-Feb-19 09:13 PM] riseandfall#3726
And so this potential new asset chain takes benefit also from the ledger app (using agama with ledger)

[18-Feb-19 09:14 PM] riseandfall#3726
I was just thinking today that it's non n√©gligeable point

[18-Feb-19 09:33 PM] riseandfall#3726
Your proposal (using the same keying system as for KMD) is simple and smart. Someone using just ledger wallet will have access to KMD chain only...And someone using Agama wallet with ledger will have the choice of the chain. And ledger can well sign.
The other option would be to play with derivation paths.
But the most important is that any new chain hosted on Komodo can well propose easily to users the possibility to store this new asset using ledger.
It's important I think for newbies.

[18-Feb-19 10:23 PM] riseandfall#3726
Above all what is important is a clear policy for future asset chains. It will make the job must easier for agama maintenance/updates

if you are not facing any issue with your wallet, you can safely ignore them. most of the time these debug prints are from other nodes

[21-Feb-19 08:05 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
hi, agama invalid pub address ?  want to send some assets from agama but this shows up ....?!
you have an answer for that case?
thanks

[21-Feb-19 08:10 PM] Angelina#6231
@vogelfreund88  Please don't post same query in different channels. 

What's your Agama version and which coin are you trying to send?

[21-Feb-19 08:11 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
V0.3.3-beta OUR is the coin i try to send

[21-Feb-19 08:26 PM] SHossain#0007
OUR is not yet supported in Agama

[21-Feb-19 08:29 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
they have build an our integrated agama v.3.3.0 beta i can see our inside but it shows me this....!

[21-Feb-19 08:29 PM] vogelfreund88#4534

[21-Feb-19 08:37 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
what that means? in your reality ?

[21-Feb-19 08:39 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
next monday, next month, next quartal.... ?

[21-Feb-19 08:39 PM] SHossain#0007
perhaps in the next release of Agama. there is no set date.

He says his company resources are not better useful for cryptocurrencies

[22-Feb-19 03:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I agree with that as it refers to mining

[22-Feb-19 03:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
But I also understand pow is the most better consensus algo

[22-Feb-19 03:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It will take some time to get more creative solutions to make it more better and less resource hungry, hopefully...

[22-Feb-19 05:09 AM] JD ez-mn.net#0489
yes @grewalsatinder  and he was also talking about mining efficiency improvements

dont forget to backup wallet.dat or dumpprivkey as needed

[23-Feb-19 04:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if reindex doesnt work, you'll need to clean out the files and folders in  `~/.komodo`  which are mentioned here - https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024513-how-to-resync-komodo-from-scratch-in-agama-windows-linux-osx-

[23-Feb-19 04:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
then either bootstrap or download chain

does that help?

i'll try dumping the chain

bootstrap is basically just a zip file of the blocks, which you can download and extract into ~/.komodo instead of downloading through running the daemon.

[23-Feb-19 05:50 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

@Gordon Komodo if you have an account there, could you recommend that they use the latest ledger live?

[24-Feb-19 10:43 PM] Alright#0419
they're using a very old chrome app

Could someone give me a resource with information on how to stake KMD using the Ledger Nano

[26-Feb-19 10:04 PM] CryptoCurb#3284
Please

[26-Feb-19 10:05 PM] PTYX#6840
@CryptoCurb currently to get your rewards on ledger you only have to make sure your app is updated on the hardware device. Once it is, you can use any of the wallets that support claiming KMD rewards. there is a tool created to claim rewards and also a wallet called Mangum wallet. I'll link them both.

Agama doesn't support ledger yet

[26-Feb-19 10:08 PM] CryptoCurb#3284
Do y'all prefer Atomic Labs or Magnum

[26-Feb-19 10:15 PM] CryptoCurb#3284
Looks like Atomic Labs doesn't require you to create a password üëç

[26-Feb-19 10:15 PM] CryptoCurb#3284
Thanks for the help

[26-Feb-19 10:21 PM] PTYX#6840
It depends what you want to do. Magnum is a full wallet whereas Atomic Labs tool is a claiming tool

[26-Feb-19 10:21 PM] PTYX#6840
@lukechilds does Atomic Labs tool cost a small fee to use? I wasn't sure if that was added or not.

[26-Feb-19 10:23 PM] PTYX#6840
@CryptoCurb by the way, you need to have 10KMD or more in one utxo to get rewards. I say this because ledger usually gives you a new address everytime you make a deposit. Sometimes you might need to consolidate the balance in one address

[26-Feb-19 10:24 PM] CryptoCurb#3284
Oh I see. Yeah I just sent 1 KMD to make sure it was good, and sent the rest. I have a lot of KMD - top 5 bag for me

[26-Feb-19 10:24 PM] CryptoCurb#3284
Gave me a different send to address on the 2nd transaction to my Ledger

[26-Feb-19 10:26 PM] CryptoCurb#3284
How do you consolidate the 2 addresses? Just send the 1KMD to the other address with more KMD?

[26-Feb-19 10:57 PM] Alright#0419
@PTYX it's 5% of the rewards

@CryptoCurb what is it you're trying to do?

[26-Feb-19 11:19 PM] PTYX#6840
To consolidate it you usually send the full balance to one address.

[26-Feb-19 11:38 PM] CryptoCurb#3284
Just stake my coins @Alright

[26-Feb-19 11:41 PM] Alright#0419
if you send 1 KMD to the other address, it won't accrue rewards
