and after that, we can get back to normal

[15-Jun-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i got the first claims data for the assetchains and it seems that similar to KMD, most are waiting for the smartdust to be moved from old address to new address. i will need a bit of time to get things setup so it can be mostly automated like it is for KMD

I submitted 2 google forms to claim my kmd from 2 different addresses back from the safe adresses at the beginninf of this week. I received one back on Wednesday, but I am still waiting for the 2nd one. Could anyone check what went wrong?

I submitted a google form without a deposit address because I would prefer to send kmd back to binance. Right now it‚Äôs not possible because of wallet maintenance. This would be a kind of verification for the rightness of the claim. Is there a verification?  Hopefully nobody claimed my kmd.

[15-Jun-19 11:54 AM] bashlomi#2213
Thanks ill try and will update

[15-Jun-19 02:37 PM] searchxyz#6399
Hi what's the average turnaround time on returning finds? I sent my smart dust and submitted the form yesterday. Thank you for catching this.

[15-Jun-19 07:03 PM] cryptoboarder#9824
Hello everyone, I filled out the form a few days ago to get your KMD refunded - I've just read that you have to send a small amount to the new address - I've done that now.  What else is there to do ... I would be grateful for help

[15-Jun-19 07:04 PM] cryptoWalker#2263
How can I access my RFOX on the agama wallet v0.6

[15-Jun-19 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i processed a bunch more refunds. waiting on 133 to send the smartdust from old address to claimed address
133
also, i checked the assetchains and is seems not many have sent the smartdust either. please send the smartdust from the old address to the claimed address. the refunds will be processed the next day

[15-Jun-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
@cryptoWalker, please ask verus team to add RFOX to the verus wallet

[15-Jun-19 07:08 PM] cryptoWalker#2263

I sent the completed form on Thursday the 6th and so far I have not received anything in the Agama/Verus wallet. Is it normal or could there be any inconvenience? today is the ninth day after my claim should I do anything else?

[15-Jun-19 07:43 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
did you send the smart dust from old address to new address? @Elmis

[15-Jun-19 07:46 PM] Elmis#0347
I just sent the filled out complaint, is there anything else we need to do?

[15-Jun-19 07:47 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
You need to send the small amount kmd (dust amount - Smart dust) that you received in the old address to new address (the new address in your claim form where you want the refund to go). @Elmis

[15-Jun-19 07:52 PM] Elmis#0347
So I have to come back in to my agama wallet and finnd there some kmd that I have to send to my address into Agama Verus. Is that so?

[15-Jun-19 07:52 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
correct

[15-Jun-19 07:54 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
You can just use Verus Agama to access your old address then send it to the new address.

[15-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Janette#4272
Hello folks, hello Komdo-Team. I just wanted to say thank you. Everything went great and fast! That's exactly what you get out of there stronger. Keep it up.

Did you also enter the pin?

[15-Jun-19 08:10 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
you should have just entered the old seed and leave the pin empty and sign in, because the pin was created for the new address. @Elmis

[15-Jun-19 08:13 PM] Elmis#0347
Yes, I have try again and enter to my old address but says: no history available

In the asset address viewer all have been left at zero

The application should have no bearing on the rewards as it is determined by the code, unless it did not send the tx correctly thus not accruing rewards
