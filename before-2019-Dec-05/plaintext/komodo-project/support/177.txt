@Oszy that doesn‚Äôt make sense if I entered a different word in the seed and got a different wallet that would mean I could theoretically access someone else‚Äôs wallet by entering a different word in the seed. That‚Äôs not secure

[30-Sep-19 05:53 AM] Oszy#5734
Chances that someone has the same seed with only 1 word different from yours are very very slim nearly impossible

[30-Sep-19 05:53 AM] Oszy#5734
Are you typing your seed in or copy/pasting?

[30-Sep-19 05:54 AM] Oszy#5734
@![HATCH] Hatch I believe you won't be able to avoid listing fee just by writing here. `guys from AtomicDEX` here are the same `guys`

[30-Sep-19 05:57 AM] peepypoopy#4480
@Oszy I would hope so, I am doing both

[30-Sep-19 05:58 AM] Oszy#5734
@![HATCH] Hatch  Although you can add your coin yourself to the marketmaker2 platform for free if you have electrum servers and other requirements met. Nothing is `free` but the cost if very far from what exchanges are asking.

[30-Sep-19 05:59 AM] Oszy#5734
@peepypoopy I can only repeat myself, if you see a different address, then you have some extra whitespace or character somewhere, missing/wrong word

[30-Sep-19 06:03 AM] ![HATCH] Hatch#3230
@Oszy Thank you. Yes, we have already created a Pull Reqest to add a HATCH coin to electrum, but it has not yet been accepted. If anything changes please let us know.

There is some work involved with listing, and the price is far less than most alternatives. There are also infrastructure costs (i.e. if you are not running your own electrum servers), so it is not unreasonable to expect fee for service and servers.

[30-Sep-19 06:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Once you have electrum servers up, the next step would be confirming mm2 compatibility by doing a test swap in CLI, and submitting a PR of the resulting transactions here - https://github.com/jl777/coins/tree/master/swaps

Once thats done, you can do atomic swaps with anyone who activates your coin via mm2 in command line. Listing on apps using mm2 like hyperDEX or atomicDEX is another step, and would more likely than not involve some listing fee. You can always use mm2 to build your own app tho, and list whatever you'd like.

[30-Sep-19 07:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Personally, I've done work on a TUI which allows me to trade mm2 compatible coins like LABS which are not yet on atomicDEX (with others whom have activated LABS etc via the TUI or thier own scripts).  Repo is on git, and listing is DIY üòâ

@Oszy okay I really need to talk to admin/support. I am able to access my old agama wallet and see my address but because of the security breach/hack incident it tells me to switch to another server. I have an updated agama wallet which as I says has a different address and therefore does not have my tokens. It is a different pin on the two different wallets, can I somehow enter my old pin into the new agama wallet, help please, this has only happened since the agama wallet hack, before that I was able to access my tokens no problem.

[30-Sep-19 07:09 AM] peepypoopy#4480
Can I dm someone about this I don‚Äôt want to start banding my address about on this public forum

[30-Sep-19 07:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator That other pin seems to point to another address unfortunately. I must have set up a few wallets. I actually have three seeds written down none of which correlate with the address which holds my funds

[30-Sep-19 07:37 AM] peepypoopy#4480
could a previous pin be overwritten in an update of the wallet?

[30-Sep-19 07:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah thats something completely different, that repo is not maintained by KomodoPlatform. Once you have an electrum up and running, PR the server details to our coins repo, then I can link you to some guides to test mm2 compatibility.

[30-Sep-19 07:38 AM] peepypoopy#4480
this is very frustrating, i'm very diligent about writing down seeds

[30-Sep-19 07:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
pins wont be overwritten - old Agama and Verus Agama use different folders

[30-Sep-19 07:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
do you have any wallet.dat from native mode perhaps?

[30-Sep-19 07:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and if you log in to old wallet does it give the address you're looking for?

[30-Sep-19 07:42 AM] ![HATCH] Hatch#3230
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Perhaps you know those who want to create and maintain an electrum server for HATCH for free. Not even for free, we can give them a reward from 1 masternode for the stimulus. We can write all the code for them.

[30-Sep-19 07:44 AM] peepypoopy#4480
If i log into an old wallet which tells me to switch to another server i get a different address

[30-Sep-19 07:45 AM] peepypoopy#4480
If i DM you the address with my tokens are you able to tell me if it was set up in native mode?

[30-Sep-19 07:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cant tell from address alone.

[30-Sep-19 07:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
do you have a wallet.dat file in the data folder?

[30-Sep-19 07:47 AM] peepypoopy#4480
i'll check

[30-Sep-19 07:48 AM] peepypoopy#4480

I have 3 separate seeds written going to try them all again and see surely one of them correlates to my wallet with my KMD

[30-Sep-19 07:55 AM] peepypoopy#4480
nope, im pretty screwed here arent I?

[30-Sep-19 07:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if it doesnt work, use the seed to private key tool, try with extra space at start/end, check spelling, make sure caps lock not on

[30-Sep-19 07:56 AM] peepypoopy#4480
I just tried all three and none correlate to the wallet I want, mental

[30-Sep-19 07:58 AM] peepypoopy#4480
I set this up ages ago but i wouldnt have ignored a whole seed/mnemonic, especially for the wallet where my funds are, bloody hell!!

[30-Sep-19 07:59 AM] peepypoopy#4480
And before the hack thing whatever it was I was able to accesss my KMD!!??

[30-Sep-19 07:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
@peepypoopy do you still have the old agama which showed you the correct address?

[30-Sep-19 07:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
if so export wif key from it and import in new agama or other wallet

[30-Sep-19 08:00 AM] peepypoopy#4480
yes i have 3 agama's on my mac

[30-Sep-19 08:00 AM] peepypoopy#4480
kept the old versions i always do

[30-Sep-19 08:00 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the hack didnt change the address a seed generates. if any wallet you have can generate the right address, we should be able to export the wif

[30-Sep-19 08:02 AM] peepypoopy#4480
@mrlynch Is the wif the seed/mnemonic ?

[30-Sep-19 08:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
wif is private key.

[30-Sep-19 08:02 AM] mrlynch#5735

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Perhaps you know how to contact cipig.net to create an entry or an electrum server?

[30-Sep-19 08:15 AM] peepypoopy#4480
no joy, like i say the 3 seeds i have are all different wallet addresses fromthe one that holds my funds. I just tried them all and saw the addresses. why would i have seeds for addresses I never used, looking at KMD explorer there is basically one transaction from my bittrexx wallet to my agama wallet, and I dont have the seed for that written down, utterly confusing

[30-Sep-19 08:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
have you tried all pins in all wallets?

[30-Sep-19 08:19 AM] peepypoopy#4480

@![HATCH] Hatch @cipi maintains a few electrum servers, but servers aren't free

[30-Sep-19 08:24 AM] gcharang#6833
@peepypoopy you mentioned there was a old agama wallet installed that was showing the correct address
can you access it now?

[30-Sep-19 08:25 AM] peepypoopy#4480
thas weird i just changed the pin in sheperd/pin to an new pin but when i load the agama the older pin is coming up instead of the on i am replacing it with??

[30-Sep-19 08:26 AM] ![HATCH] Hatch#3230
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Do they create a separate coin node for each electrum server or do all three servers use the same node?

[30-Sep-19 08:26 AM] peepypoopy#4480
@gcharang There isnt im afraid the only way I can see my wallet with my funds is via the kmd explorer

[30-Sep-19 08:27 AM] peepypoopy#4480
which is mental

[30-Sep-19 08:28 AM] peepypoopy#4480
Like, why would i transfer all my kmd to a wallet whcih i cannot access, how could I do that even?!?

[30-Sep-19 08:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm not sure about the servers, probably depends on load and webserver settings

[30-Sep-19 08:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
a single domain can have numerous servers behind it

[30-Sep-19 08:29 AM] peepypoopy#4480
I transfered the funds from bittrex, im sure i would have checked they went in there okay at the time, but now i cannot accesss that wallet through agama, nuts!

@peepypoopy can you confirm that you are entering the seed words in the filed named "Wallet seed/wif" and you are seing the green text "Iguana 256 bits" after entering all the words?

[30-Sep-19 08:32 AM] peepypoopy#4480
yes, definitely

[30-Sep-19 08:32 AM] gcharang#6833
can you send me the address you can see in the explorer in dm ?

[30-Sep-19 08:35 AM] peepypoopy#4480
sent, i tried to look on bittrex to see the transaction but looks like bittrex generate a new address each time

[30-Sep-19 08:36 AM] gcharang#6833
you may be able to see previous withdrawal transactions
the transaction id is enough to find the address

[30-Sep-19 08:39 AM] peepypoopy#4480
I definitely checked the funds went in, obviously i would, then left them there thinking they were safe not on ana exchange.  All this happened after i read about the agama wallet being compromised so I went back in and... well here we are..
