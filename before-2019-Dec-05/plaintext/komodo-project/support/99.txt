if funds went to RSgD2cmm......EHoHMywJdkbkeF your KMD was at risk, so we swept it, we are about to announce a procedure on how to claim it

I've (roughly) translated and posted SHossain's emergency Agama post and put it up in #japanese.  Might be worth doing in other foreign language channels if not done so already?

[05-Jun-19 07:46 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@Dany_sof may be you can try the web wallet https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/

It's that address, you mean those coins will come back?
@TonyL

[05-Jun-19 07:46 AM] onebluesky#9439
have to wait until there is at least 1 confirmation before it can be moved

[05-Jun-19 07:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it's whitehat address, we will announce a procedure on how to claim it

[05-Jun-19 07:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Scarborough 

There was a vulnerability in a library that Agama uses. 

To protect our users, the Komodo team exploited this to move all vulnerable funds to a safe location.

[05-Jun-19 07:48 AM] Umaru#8531
@ballistic  what ver u use i use 0.36 b and its ok

[05-Jun-19 07:49 AM] onebluesky#9439

[05-Jun-19 07:50 AM] Jimm B.#9993
I can follow the claim instructions later.  how do you make sure the coins are sent to the right one if the seed is corrupted?

[05-Jun-19 07:50 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@ballistic 

Please reach out to @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator and @SHossain, our support team emmbers.

[05-Jun-19 07:50 AM] onebluesky#9439

[05-Jun-19 07:51 AM] onebluesky#9439

@Bryan_Beus 
May I know the approximate time when those coins will come back?

[05-Jun-19 07:54 AM] onebluesky#9439
@Scarborough I think there will be an announcement on the process of how to receive them back. nothing about that yet.

[05-Jun-19 07:54 AM] PHBA2061#2530
RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF is the address secured by the team  where your funds are swept to

[05-Jun-19 07:54 AM] VainSlay#7979
Regarding the paper wallet generator from the github,

I can just use the single wallet tab to store Komodo projects like ZEXO and RFOX right?

[05-Jun-19 07:55 AM] OsTa#2589
web wallet doesn't move all funds. Always 0.0001 remain on the wallet when you are using "ALL" feature

[05-Jun-19 07:55 AM] PHBA2061#2530
0.0001 is the tx fee

[05-Jun-19 07:56 AM] onebluesky#9439
hmmm @OsTa that's the fee i believe

[05-Jun-19 07:56 AM] Zoroaster#5093

[05-Jun-19 07:59 AM] onebluesky#9439
good question. i found out about this initially through reddit. so hopefully it gets posted around.

Verus wallet  not connecting to kmd or btc,  how to fix it

[05-Jun-19 08:00 AM] SHossain#0007
use VRSC LITE MODE

[05-Jun-19 08:00 AM] SHossain#0007
not KMD OR BTC LITE MODE

[05-Jun-19 08:00 AM] onebluesky#9439
hmmm why make the form require sign in?

[05-Jun-19 08:00 AM] SHossain#0007
just creat a wallet

[05-Jun-19 08:00 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@VainSlay yes you can use the same address from the paper wallet to store Komodo projects    tokens

[05-Jun-19 08:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@onebluesky to prevent spam I can assume

[05-Jun-19 08:00 AM] SHossain#0007
check the second pinned post of this channel

[05-Jun-19 08:00 AM] onebluesky#9439
I know want to reduce spam but not sure that's the best approach for some people either

[05-Jun-19 08:01 AM] VainSlay#7979
@PHBA2061 Great, thanks!

[05-Jun-19 08:01 AM] onebluesky#9439
sure I understand about reducing spam, but I have a feeling some people are not going to want to use that.

[05-Jun-19 08:01 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@VainSlay just make sure to secure your new generated private key

[05-Jun-19 08:01 AM] Dany_sof#4502
Not work for BTCZ https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/

[05-Jun-19 08:01 AM] dxer666#8963
vrsc lite mode  working. also i can add btc to coin but connection error for btc or kmd... so if i deposit kmd or btc everything will be ok?

[05-Jun-19 08:02 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

[05-Jun-19 08:02 AM] SHossain#0007
it's the address only that you need

[05-Jun-19 08:02 AM] SHossain#0007
did you read my post properly?

[05-Jun-19 08:03 AM] VainSlay#7979
@PHBA2061 I'm offline on my second comp that I generated the address with, so I should be good! I'll encrypt it before I get that computer connectable to the internet. Thanks for your help.

[05-Jun-19 08:03 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@Dany_sof select KMD from the LITE SPV drop list, then enter your seed, once loged in you can import BTCZ with the button on the top right.
Then generate a new paper wallet address and send your funds there

[05-Jun-19 08:03 AM] Crypto Rich#0500
I have downloaded new VRSC wallet. Have saved seed and private key. Closed wallet. Closed wallet. Re-opened. Am now getting message that server is not available, and i can't connect manually

[05-Jun-19 08:04 AM] Dany_sof#4502

[05-Jun-19 08:05 AM] Crypto Rich#0500
Can I send to new VRSC agama address - and then  upload the wallet later?  I have seed saved

[05-Jun-19 08:06 AM] Crypto Rich#0500
@SHossain see above

[05-Jun-19 08:06 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, that is good @Crypto Rich

[05-Jun-19 08:06 AM] LocoMB#8593
the paperwallet generatot works really fine! just a few clicks

[05-Jun-19 08:08 AM] Umaru#8531
whats a ninja coin? i have some in my wallet but dont show my balance in agama

[05-Jun-19 08:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Umaru test coins that were used before the vote2019 airdrop

[05-Jun-19 08:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
nothing to worry about and pretty much useless

[05-Jun-19 08:09 AM] Umaru#8531
ok thanks

[05-Jun-19 08:09 AM] Scarborough#9066
@onebluesky
1. May l use Binance KMD address for fund back on your form?
2. May we use Agama wallet in the future? Will it be safe in the future

[05-Jun-19 08:09 AM] TS#7923
1. yes
2. we are retiring Agama anyway in favor of our new wallet (coming *very* soon)

[05-Jun-19 08:10 AM] Umaru#8531
i keep my ninja for war with hacker üòÅ

[05-Jun-19 08:10 AM] shifty252#7855
am i seeing this right? KMD team just swept all funds from everyone?
if yes, kmd just acknowledged that IT IS NOT decentralized
if i'm wrong, please explain

[05-Jun-19 08:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@shifty252 they found an exploit and exploited it themselves before malicious hackers could do so

[05-Jun-19 08:12 AM] TS#7923
@shifty252 Good point but please do not jump to conclusions yet. It is related to the nature of the vulnerability. We promise to publish a proper post-mortem, but believe me, we went with the best bad option.

[05-Jun-19 08:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
that does not mean anything about the decentralized nature of the ecosystem

[05-Jun-19 08:14 AM] Crypto Rich#6241
Should I move my ARRR as well to a new address in VRSC agama?

[05-Jun-19 08:14 AM] shifty252#7855
ok, thx for answering, kinda bad to have an issue like this after years of being live
hope everyone gets their funds and stay safe

[05-Jun-19 08:14 AM] TimC#3334
hey I just opened my wallet and the balance it zero. what can I do?

[05-Jun-19 08:14 AM] BanHammer#8115
I just got here, does this count for all the coins on the Agama wallet?

[05-Jun-19 08:15 AM] TS#7923
@shifty252 We promise more transparency, but there are more urgent considerations at play now i.e., making sure that funds are secure

[05-Jun-19 08:16 AM] shifty252#7855
gl everyone

[05-Jun-19 08:16 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@TimC was your balance moved to RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF ?

[05-Jun-19 08:17 AM] TimC#3334
RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF yes that is where they went. Can you recove them for me

[05-Jun-19 08:18 AM] TS#7923
