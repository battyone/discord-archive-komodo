okay, then no you don't have to do anything with that osx link you posted. 

log into your VPS, install the dependencies, and then build for linux

[31-Aug-18 06:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
the instructions say 2 VPS with 4gb of ram and 2 cpu cores each

[31-Aug-18 06:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
all using terminal?

[31-Aug-18 06:12 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yes all using terminal.

[31-Aug-18 06:12 PM] xRobeSx#5136
you need this one, installing on ubuntu:  https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html#installing-komodo-on-ubuntu-debian

[31-Aug-18 06:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
when i type brew update it says its updated but it says permissiion denied just before that

[31-Aug-18 06:13 PM] xRobeSx#5136
you don't need to do any of that brew stuff. that's if you're trying to install on Mac

[31-Aug-18 06:13 PM] xRobeSx#5136
you're trying to install on Ubuntu

If you still face issues with Agama let us know , I am back in the desk

[31-Aug-18 07:57 PM] Hermes#6934
@Mc Tau  make sure to save your private key and  just in case here are a couple of guides  for Native mode https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/259817495/NATIVE+MODE

[31-Aug-18 07:58 PM] Hermes#6934
Your seed for lite mode stores only a private key , in native mode you are complete different set of ptivate keys for each eaddress

[31-Aug-18 07:58 PM] Mc Tau#7499
thanks for the great support hermes!  all recovered now

[31-Aug-18 07:59 PM] Mc Tau#7499
Pivx implemented zerocoin protocol, and  you can get a master deterministic seed to recover private coins / addresses created in the future. 

Does komodo have something similar?

[31-Aug-18 08:01 PM] Hermes#6934
Haven't heard of this implementation , is more or less like the Ledger implementation of one seed that holds all of your public addresses and private keys?

[31-Aug-18 08:01 PM] Mc Tau#7499
i have a link. am i allowed to post here?

[31-Aug-18 08:01 PM] Hermes#6934

it gives you an awesome permanent backup.

and keeping privacy

[31-Aug-18 08:03 PM] Hermes#6934
ok will read it , I am not a dev but maybe it's something that we already have or compatible

[31-Aug-18 08:03 PM] Mc Tau#7499
but pivx is limited to payments, while komodo is much more than that, so would be great to have

[31-Aug-18 08:12 PM] Hermes#6934
interesting

[31-Aug-18 08:13 PM] Mc Tau#7499
it sure is!

[31-Aug-18 08:13 PM] Mc Tau#7499
how can you import/sweep a private key in agama?

[31-Aug-18 08:13 PM] Mc Tau#7499

[31-Aug-18 08:14 PM] Hermes#6934
This guide is to import your private keys if you are using lite mode you can use the private key to access directly that address

[31-Aug-18 08:15 PM] Mc Tau#7499
oh you can just login with the private key in lite/

[31-Aug-18 08:15 PM] Mc Tau#7499

hi guys,

[31-Aug-18 08:55 PM] sbucks#9553
i updated to v2.41d , is it best to claim the KMD reward before block 1M?  i usually claim the reward once a month

[31-Aug-18 09:01 PM] Bitcoiner#5383
I dont know wat is to do, i need a deamon update

[31-Aug-18 09:02 PM] Hermes#6934
For the new network rules it's mandatory to claim the reward each month.

[31-Aug-18 09:02 PM] Hermes#6934
@sbucks  this will at the create a reward of 5.1 % per year

[31-Aug-18 09:03 PM] Hermes#6934
You need a daemon update for the CLI or you are referring to the general 1 mm update?

[31-Aug-18 09:03 PM] Hermes#6934
@Bitcoiner

[31-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Bitcoiner#5383
I was since may  2018 offline, nothing claimed. I Cant see my  funds  and the wallet ist not connected. Sorry for my Bad english

[31-Aug-18 09:12 PM] Bitcoiner#5383
Is the explain on kmd Homepage the  easyist way to update daemon

If you still face issues while loading the blocks please tell me exactly which is the error that you are seeing.

[31-Aug-18 09:32 PM] sbucks#9217
@Hermes  thanks, i claimed back on the 15th or so, was just wondering if i needed to claim again before block 1M or if i could wait til 15th of september.

[31-Aug-18 09:35 PM] Hermes#6934
With 2.41d you are good to go if you will like to claim on the 15 th ,

[31-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Hermes#6934
You can also claim again before the 15th  just make sure to claim at least more than .01 of rewards always .

[31-Aug-18 10:40 PM] Tac#1954
With the way interest work as long as we claim the rewards is that good enough or do you actually have to send our entire balance to a new receive address?

[31-Aug-18 10:45 PM] Hermes#6934
Claiming the reward is the only requirement , if you send the balance to a new receive address will also make the reward function work because it you have to spend the utxos in order to get the reward. So you can do it either way it won't change the reward.

[31-Aug-18 10:51 PM] Tac#1954
Thank you

@Hermes  Thanks, Where can I find cli on Agama (SPV mode)?

[01-Sep-18 04:13 AM] Hermes#6934
You need to  use on native

[01-Sep-18 04:13 AM] Hermes#6934
Settings then selecting CLI

[01-Sep-18 04:14 AM] Hermes#6934
You can import the private e key into Native mode  and do it from there

[01-Sep-18 04:14 AM] CrisF#3405
Great, thank you very much!

how long does daemon take to sync?

[01-Sep-18 06:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
its been literally hours

[01-Sep-18 06:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Are you syncing main KMD chain or asset chain which you've tried to create these days?

[01-Sep-18 07:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
asset chain

[01-Sep-18 07:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
the daemon

[01-Sep-18 07:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
its been going for 5 hours

[01-Sep-18 07:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Why do you think it's not synced?

[01-Sep-18 07:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
cause it keep downloading blocks

[01-Sep-18 07:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Which outputs do you have for `komodo-cli -ac_name=%youracname% getinfo` on node1 and node2?

[01-Sep-18 07:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
value of best chain and blocks should be equal no?

[01-Sep-18 07:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes it should be same on both nodes

[01-Sep-18 07:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
im still on vps one

[01-Sep-18 07:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
havent even started 2

[01-Sep-18 08:00 AM] TonyL#3577
You can't be out of sync if you runned AC chain only on 1 node

[01-Sep-18 08:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Because only one node in chain, how can it not be synced with itself

[01-Sep-18 08:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
im still downloading komodo

You calling chain status for main KMD chain not yours assetchain

[01-Sep-18 08:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok

[01-Sep-18 08:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
but this is the process to do asssett chain

[01-Sep-18 08:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
i try my best man

[01-Sep-18 08:29 AM] TonyL#3577
To make any calls to your assetchain you have to build it in this way: `./komodo-cli -ac_name=%youracname%` instead of `./komodo-cli`

[01-Sep-18 08:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
bro im still on the first vps

[01-Sep-18 08:30 AM] TonyL#3577
So if you want to check status of your AC you have to call: `./komodo-cli -ac_name=%youracname% getinfo`

[01-Sep-18 08:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
why do i have to out my name ?

[01-Sep-18 08:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
i have already logged in to linnux using my username

[01-Sep-18 08:30 AM] TonyL#3577
-ac_name= it's a parameter with which you start your asset chain

[01-Sep-18 08:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Name of your chain

[01-Sep-18 08:32 AM] TonyL#3577
I advice you read manual for asset chain creating carefully one more time

[01-Sep-18 08:34 AM] TonyL#3577
If you're tech illiterate as you said why you have to run your own asset chain? It maybe kinda complicated thing since some understanding what you do and for what + interaction with Linux needed
