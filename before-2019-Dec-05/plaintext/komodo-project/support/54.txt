hey all. i am trying to unlock my pirate wallet. i had installed komodo wallet, got my address and private key saved to text. i upgraded the komodo wallet and im trying to import the private key, but its asking for a wif key. did i screw it up?
there is a pirate folder, with a wallet.dat file in my appdata folder.

[17-Nov-18 05:47 PM] SHossain#0007
WIF (Wallet Import Format) is the private key

[17-Nov-18 05:48 PM] flhctroll#7452
@SHossain should i just wait till the chain is finished loading? when i put in private key it gives error about syncing best chain

[17-Nov-18 05:49 PM] SHossain#0007
wait for sync to finish before importing the privkey.

[17-Nov-18 05:50 PM] SHossain#0007
importing privkey will trigger a resacn

[17-Nov-18 05:50 PM] SHossain#0007
that is normal

[17-Nov-18 05:51 PM] flhctroll#7452
@SHossain  ok. thank you for your help.

[18-Nov-18 06:53 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
@SHossain Hi Thank you for the tip, but I can't find ABP smartaddress from the output of `./setpassphrase`. Is there anything I need to do?

[18-Nov-18 06:58 PM] SHossain#0007
ABP info must be present in `coins` file

[18-Nov-18 07:01 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
@SHossain We added the info in the jl777c/coins repository, as what was advised. Do we need to add elsewhere?

[18-Nov-18 07:03 PM] SHossain#0007
check if the `coins` file inside `dexscripts` dir has ABP info. if not add there and try again. please contact @cipi at #dev-tradebots channel for issues regrading coin integration

anyone around right now to help?

[19-Nov-18 04:36 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I was re-installing Agama, and I made a mistake.

I did `sudo rm -rf /opt/AgamaApp`, thinking that was the way to uninstall. Forgot that there's a built-in uninstaller.

Now, I can't install or uninstall.

[19-Nov-18 04:37 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If I use the downloadable installer, no matter which folder I extract to, and no matter whether I try to uninstall or re-install, I get a message saying that without `/opt/AgamaApp/Uninstall-Agama`, the program won't run.

[19-Nov-18 06:08 AM] Hermes#6934
@Bryan_Beus  I have reproduced the scenario , it seems that the previous release is still detected for some reason ...but the portable version works https://komodoplatform.com/alternative-downloads/

[21-Nov-18 08:31 PM] Hermes#6934
You mean adding a new coin to Agama @Hades  ?

[21-Nov-18 08:31 PM] Hades#0251
yes

[21-Nov-18 08:32 PM] Hermes#6934
Here is some documentation that can help with this process https://docs.komodoplatform.com/home-agama.html

[22-Nov-18 04:16 AM] okthen#8167
Goodmorning! When upgrading to  agama 0.2.43d should I check both boxes in pic below or one box or none? I just want to upgrade the wallet so I can claim my rewards

[22-Nov-18 04:17 AM] okthen#8167
ah..i cant upload pic, choice is between delete user-date and/or delete Zcash params or none?

[22-Nov-18 04:18 AM] Hermes#6934
This is not needed if you had a previous installation you can continue the installation as usual.

[22-Nov-18 04:18 AM] okthen#8167
so none of the boxes checked am i right? thanks appreciate it

[22-Nov-18 04:20 AM] Hermes#6934

@Team  Admin Hi guys, I am getting this error when doing `./balances` ```curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 7783: Connection refused``` can anyone tell me what I did wrong?

1. The komodo wallet is running.
1. and we added via curl this line for ABP ```curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:5426" --data "{\"Test\":\"atomic\",\"method\":\"enable\",\"coin\":\"ABP\"}"```

I was contacting @cipi  support via e-mail, he told me to contact the support in Discord for this matter, and said I would get better help here.

Thanks Guys!

[23-Nov-18 12:01 AM] Hermes#6934
@Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)  Hello there I guess you have already seen this guide for the Desktop version https://docs.komodoplatform.com/agama/add-Bitcoin-Compatible-coin-Agama-Desktop.html?highlight=agama , if you are already added and have passed the vetting process my guess is that in next versions your bitcoin compatible coin should be added.

[23-Nov-18 12:02 AM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Thanks @Hermes

[23-Nov-18 12:08 AM] Hermes#6934
@ABP brewmaster  Please send us a ticket to look into this  ,  not sure if that output is being prompted for debugging purposes... we will look into this shortly , did marketmaker crashed?

[23-Nov-18 12:11 AM] ABP brewmaster#0177
@Hermes Ok I will check the status of the marketmaker now!

[23-Nov-18 12:11 AM] Hermes#6934
ok let us know  also into support@komodoplatform.com to have this documented...

[23-Nov-18 12:13 AM] ABP brewmaster#0177
Ok I just tried to restart it and this happened ```root@vultr:~/SuperNET/iguana/dexscripts# cd ~/SuperNET/iguana/dexscripts && source userpass
root@vultr:~/SuperNET/iguana/dexscripts# ./client_my && sleep 10
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 7783: Connection refused
nohup: redirecting stderr to stdout
root@vultr:~/SuperNET/iguana/dexscripts#```

[23-Nov-18 12:21 AM] Hermes#6934
ok let's see this in #dev-marketmaker I am seeing some other entries on the same matter still if you can submit the ticket

[23-Nov-18 12:25 AM] ABP brewmaster#0177
@Hermes I sent an email to support Thanks for your help!

[23-Nov-18 10:23 AM] Nabob#5004
@ABP brewmaster  Thats not an error, Client scripts stops the previous Marketmaker instances and starts again. If you start to execute client script  again it shows like this

```DEBUG stop
i got killed
{"result":"success"}
marketmaker exiting in 5 seconds```

You need to make sure, You have have done all the process correct.

1) Update Supernet/barterdex repo
2)  Make sure userpass and passphrase is set
3) Following with  client script, You need to run setpassphrase script and check marketmaker is running on specified port. 
To make sure everything goes fine

@SHossain sorry for dumb question, komodo change algo to versusHash or ?

@[Dev] Alex no algo changes

[27-Nov-18 06:38 PM] j4ys0n#3189
@SHossain @Hermes do we still need to run `./zcutil/fetch-params.sh` if setting up a new node with 0.3.1?

[27-Nov-18 06:38 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249
@SHossain do we need to update pool stratum for support sapling?

[27-Nov-18 06:38 PM] SHossain#0007
@j4ys0n if you want to use 0.3.1, use https://github.com/jl777/komodo `beta` or `dev` branch to compile for testing
