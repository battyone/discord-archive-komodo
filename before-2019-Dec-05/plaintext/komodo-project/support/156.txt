Hi, Is anyone available for a funds/wallet issue from early today?

[28-Jun-19 01:31 PM] Ricishort#4976
Hey guys,
I recieved my funds back now. Thank you alot die your help. Am i right that the Verus wallet is just a safe version of agama ? Because i want to claim my interest soon again.

[28-Jun-19 07:18 PM] rongarvin99#8336
I want to move funds out of a paper wallet. I just downloaded ocean wallet. It brings up the remaining balance on my old agama wallet even though I uninstalled it. How to I transfer my paper wallet funds to the ocean wallet?

[28-Jun-19 07:26 PM] SHossain#0007
you don't transfer from app to app. you transfer from address to address

[28-Jun-19 07:26 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to import prrivate key of your paper wallet into KomodoOceanQT wallet

[28-Jun-19 07:27 PM] SHossain#0007
and, you will be able to access all your funds

check this guide for help with importing key

[28-Jun-19 07:46 PM] rongarvin99#8336
ok, got it. Now, how to I claim rewards with this wallet? I don‚Äôt see any guides for that

[28-Jun-19 07:47 PM] SHossain#0007
send all balance to self address. that will claim your accrued reward

[28-Jun-19 07:53 PM] rongarvin99#8336
so then rewards are automatically added to balance? with old agama you had to click a button to add in or actually claim those rewards

[29-Jun-19 01:54 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The button was just a convienence tool

[29-Jun-19 03:38 PM] Max#3774
Hey all.  I've been working a lot recently, and haven't had a chance to sort out my funds, after the most recent drama.  AND, before any of this security issue with the Agama wallet was discovered, my version of Agama was bugged, (I think I had shut it down incorrectly, and corrupted the blockchain) but I wasn't worried, because I have all of my private keys safely stored.  Basically, it only worked in lite mode, because I think my local blockchain had been corrupted, and it would not sync.  Just stalls out at Activating Best Chain.

Now I'm running into a tonne of issues getting my Agama wallet started up, just to see if I am one of the unlucky people to have had my KMD scooped out of my wallet.

When I start Agama in light mode, my balance is there, but the wallet is not synced, and I can't send the KMD ."Error Unable to get transactions history data. Code ApiElectrumTransactions".  I am running Agama v 0.3.4.

Any ideas about how I can resolve this?

also,
create a new wallet(new seed) and transfer all your coins to the new address
(Verify that the newly created seed phrase gives you the same address every time)

[29-Jun-19 03:51 PM] Max#3774
I'll give that a shot.  Thank you!

anyone knows when the bitpanda komodo wallet will work again? it is possible to buy/sell komodo for fiat there, but not to send it outside the bitpanda site

Need a note: Send an error message from AgamaWalletVerus Pundi NPXS (erc20) to Binance: "Can not push ETH transaction" has someone experienced the same? Thank you for your help.

[30-Jun-19 08:24 PM] gcharang#6833
@cryptopoli it might be because you don't have enough ETH to pay gas fee

Just heard about the hack, i see that my funds were swept to safe by the team..
I made a new address, filled the claim form and transfered the fractions of kmd from my compromised address to my new address which i stated in the form. Now just wait for my funds to be back or do I have to do something more?

[01-Jul-19 09:06 AM] gcharang#6833
@harjuri just wait

[01-Jul-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810

Hi, I received most oft my swept token back after going through the reclaim process. Big thanks to the support team for your rescue efforts! Still missing from the same address are my DEX, HODL and JUMBLR assets. Should I just wait, or is there a problem with this assets? Old address is: RAS5HArp8SMWVWm91Gwxtyno6Tkw9DBQLb

[01-Jul-19 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont see the claim for DEX or HODL or JUMBLR, but it is on chain, so i will add it manually.

[01-Jul-19 11:57 AM] abraxas147#2143
Ok, I claimed these three assets later then the others, using the separate Google forms. Maybe something went wrong with this. Thanks for your support!

[01-Jul-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
processed them

[01-Jul-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
