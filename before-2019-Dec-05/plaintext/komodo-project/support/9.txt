Hey guys, I have a coin that is listed in BarterDEX but my local wallet won't connect when I add it. I did set server=1 in my config file but still no dice. Could it be that I have the datadir on an external HD that is causing the problem?

[02-Jul-18 10:07 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
BarterDEX GUI looks in default locations

[02-Jul-18 10:10 PM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
Thanks. So my next question is, how do I add a coin permanently to BarterDEX? There are online instruction that say "Add coin with ONE LINE of code" but makes no reference where to actually put that one line of code

[02-Jul-18 10:14 PM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
Reference: https://support.supernet.org/support/solutions/articles/29000014804-how-get-your-coin-listed-on-barterdex

[02-Jul-18 10:15 PM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
Example code: {\"coin\":\"LTC\", \"name\": \"litecoin\", \"active\":1, \"rpcport\":9332,\"pubtype\":48, \"p2shtype\":50, \"wiftype\":176, \"txfee\":100000}

[02-Jul-18 10:15 PM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
But where do I put this code?

[02-Jul-18 10:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If it's here: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins
then you just need to add via "Manage Coins"

if not, pop into #dev-tradebots and I'm sure someone can link you to the newer docs

[02-Jul-18 10:18 PM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
Ok thank you. I'm trying to add a new coin. It's a new fork of DASH so there is no pre-existing code addition for it

[02-Jul-18 10:18 PM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
Most likely the first time anyone has attempted adding it

[02-Jul-18 10:20 PM] Hermes#6934
You should send us a request to support@komodoplatform.com with the info from this guide Reference: https://support.supernet.org/support/solutions/articles/29000014804-how-get-your-coin-listed-on-barterdex then we will forward it to our developers

[02-Jul-18 10:22 PM] Hermes#6934
Also you can copy cipi@komodoplatform.com

[02-Jul-18 10:22 PM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
@Hermes thank you! I will do it this evening

[02-Jul-18 11:28 PM] cipi#4502
you can alsd tell me the link to the wallet source and i will take a first look, if it has everything needed, like gettxout and importaddress API call, and BIP65

[03-Jul-18 02:34 AM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
@cipi I sent you a link to the source code

[03-Jul-18 02:43 AM] adaptive_action#2809
hi, i downloaded agama wallet and enabled the advenced features but dash etc coins does not display, can any one help? thanks

[03-Jul-18 02:46 AM] adaptive_action#2809
pls ignore my prev. entry, it is okay now. sorry all for the traffic

[03-Jul-18 02:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ComputerGenie it is suppose to work on windows. it's the same  issue reported last week and pushed it's update to dev branch on git last week.
I have no idea if @Ä°lgar A.  is using dev branch or published build.
and I don't publish builds anymore to git releases. @SHossain and @siu - Chainmakers does.

and just simply showing message on startup for this in quickest way is not good. it will not have any way to disable it.
to have it disable, I need to complete the release notes notification feature that I'm already debugging.
so wait till it's done. that might help.

so far this issue is Support and QA issue.
@Hermes

[03-Jul-18 02:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks for helping with such support queries anyway ðŸ™‚

[03-Jul-18 06:53 AM] adaptive_action#2809
how many confirmations needed to be deposited on agama ?i sent kmd took 40+ confirmations and still counting, it s been 1+ hour , any one familiar ?

[03-Jul-18 06:53 AM] adaptive_action#2809
that can say smthg

[03-Jul-18 06:55 AM] adaptive_action#2809
50+ and counting

[03-Jul-18 06:58 AM] Acura#2748
I think only 1 confirmation you need in agama

[03-Jul-18 06:59 AM] adaptive_action#2809
i bought from an exchange and sent to agama

[03-Jul-18 07:00 AM] Acura#2748
Did you checked the tx id in the block explorer?

[03-Jul-18 07:00 AM] adaptive_action#2809
the amount shows in balance but confirmations continue and the exchange status of the transfer seems processsing

[03-Jul-18 07:00 AM] adaptive_action#2809
sure

[03-Jul-18 07:01 AM] Acura#2748
Ok you see your kmd on agama and confirmations running up ?

[03-Jul-18 07:02 AM] adaptive_action#2809
yes

[03-Jul-18 07:02 AM] adaptive_action#2809
and it seems as  processing on exchange not completed

[03-Jul-18 07:04 AM] adaptive_action#2809
really shocked with this flow, never imagined that komodo transfers take very long time

[03-Jul-18 07:05 AM] Acura#2748
Komodo transfer donâ€˜t take long time - block confirmations ca 1min.
It depends on the Exchanges how much confirmations they need.

[03-Jul-18 07:06 AM] Acura#2748
If your kmd are in your agama then everything is find

[03-Jul-18 07:07 AM] adaptive_action#2809
sorry but it doesn t make sense

[03-Jul-18 07:08 AM] adaptive_action#2809
it is not related with the exchange

[03-Jul-18 07:09 AM] adaptive_action#2809
i asked them

[03-Jul-18 07:09 AM] adaptive_action#2809
anyone had an experience like mine ?

[03-Jul-18 07:10 AM] Acura#2748
If you send your KMD from Agama to a stock exchange - the stock exchange is responsible for how many confirmations they need until your coins are credited to you.

[03-Jul-18 07:13 AM] adaptive_action#2809
i said i sent from excahge to AGAMA

[03-Jul-18 07:13 AM] adaptive_action#2809
not from AGAMA to excgange

[03-Jul-18 07:13 AM] adaptive_action#2809
in other words i am trying to deposit my AGAMA wallet

[03-Jul-18 07:13 AM] Acura#2748
Are the KMD from the Exchange on your Agama? Do you see it ?

[03-Jul-18 07:13 AM] adaptive_action#2809
yes shown on the balance

[03-Jul-18 07:14 AM] Acura#2748
Then it is fine

[03-Jul-18 07:14 AM] adaptive_action#2809
no it is not

[03-Jul-18 07:15 AM] adaptive_action#2809
confirmations counting and i need to learn why

[03-Jul-18 07:15 AM] Acura#2748
ThatÂ´s normal - with every block , thereÂ´s another confirmation

[03-Jul-18 07:15 AM] adaptive_action#2809
as confirmations counting the exchange does not change the satus of the transaction as completed. it is still  in progress

[03-Jul-18 07:16 AM] adaptive_action#2809
and this is ridiculus

[03-Jul-18 07:16 AM] adaptive_action#2809
some one from the team may be can help me , is there anybody that you are familiar here Acura ?

[03-Jul-18 07:17 AM] adaptive_action#2809
from the team i mean..

[03-Jul-18 07:17 AM] Acura#2748
That the exchange has not changed its transaction status has nothing to do with Agama.

[03-Jul-18 07:17 AM] adaptive_action#2809
or anyone tried to deposit AGAMA from an exchange

[03-Jul-18 07:17 AM] Acura#2748
Your KMD are on your KMD Adress on Agama

[03-Jul-18 07:19 AM] adaptive_action#2809
do you have any foresiggt where could the confirmation count rise ?

[03-Jul-18 07:19 AM] adaptive_action#2809
i mean it s 66 now

[03-Jul-18 07:19 AM] adaptive_action#2809
67 sorry

[03-Jul-18 07:19 AM] adaptive_action#2809

If the KMD is in your AGAMA wallet, what's the issue?

[03-Jul-18 07:24 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Just want to get clear

You said above the balance is showing in your AGAMA wallet

[03-Jul-18 07:24 AM] adaptive_action#2809
yes

[03-Jul-18 07:25 AM] adaptive_action#2809
but confirmations counting so the exchange status of the transaction is processing not completed

[03-Jul-18 07:25 AM] adaptive_action#2809
my question is how many confirmations needed ?

[03-Jul-18 07:26 AM] adaptive_action#2809
*or let me ask another way what is the avarage confirmation number in kmd network

[03-Jul-18 07:26 AM] adaptive_action#2809
by the way thanks

[03-Jul-18 07:26 AM] adaptive_action#2809
i do really appreciate

[03-Jul-18 07:26 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I'll have to double check with support but I'm fairly certain that the confirmations just count continuously

[03-Jul-18 07:27 AM] adaptive_action#2809
*continiusly , you mean infinetely

[03-Jul-18 07:27 AM] Daniel CP#2020
So if you have one deposit and you let it sit for a few months, the confirmations would just keep going up into the tens or hundreds of thousands
