You can send me details in PM, and I can follow up on the process / progress üëçüèº

@miraculu ask in #dev-general

[20-Aug-19 08:09 AM] Oszy#5734
i think he asked multiple times recently, but i don't know of a c# or nodeJS wrapper available open-source. (not sure what Agama was using)

[20-Aug-19 08:10 AM] Oszy#5734
@miraculu maybe you could approach one of the Discord Bot devs about what they are using, as those bots are nodeJS

[20-Aug-19 08:10 AM] Oszy#5734
@turinglabs or @owerache

[20-Aug-19 08:12 AM] Oszy#5734
`bitcoinjs-lib-zcash maybe` ?

[20-Aug-19 08:35 AM] turinglabs#2390
@miraculu see my discord bot for komodo, there's a simple module that accepts calls like the cli. https://github.com/turinglabsorg/komodo-tip-bot/blob/master/core/komodo.js

@miraculu I wanted to make an official wrapper, I was told that it was useless... that we didn't understand the interest...

[20-Aug-19 11:13 AM] gcharang#6833
@AkeelZ_STraFe__ yes you can
have you verified if your old address has the coins using an explorer?

[20-Aug-19 11:14 AM] gcharang#6833
@Tropical Miner were you able to recover Verus?

[20-Aug-19 11:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@owerache what language, and who said useless? Dont let it stop you making an unofficial wrapper and sharing it on github.

[20-Aug-19 01:37 PM] miraculu#8334
@Oszy  and @turinglabs  thank you very much.

[20-Aug-19 01:38 PM] miraculu#8334
@owerache  please do, its going to make life very easy for my project.

[20-Aug-19 02:26 PM] turinglabs#2390
@miraculu i can explain the module, it's pretty simple and it haven't dependencies (and it's working yet). PM if you need help

[20-Aug-19 08:51 PM] Lyper22#6886
hi guys i was wondering why i cant access my kmd for over 2 months. i tried the verus agama version to access my kmd via this wallet with my secret seed but unfortunatly i only get errors: unknow method blockchain.adress.get_balance . so the only thing i have is my seed and no way to get my money! we are 4 friends with this problem so far and we cant find a solution

[20-Aug-19 08:58 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
which version are you using?

[20-Aug-19 08:58 PM] Lyper22#6886
trying right now on 0.5.7-4  of verus agama

[20-Aug-19 09:11 PM] Lyper22#6886
well need to go! maybe il be able to get to my kmd someday üò¶ hope so!

[20-Aug-19 09:14 PM] Danger#1604
@Lyper22

[20-Aug-19 09:14 PM] Danger#1604
you can get yours KMD back this is not a issue

[20-Aug-19 09:15 PM] Lyper22#6886
ho really!!! how though!? the only resource i have left is to ask someone to get it for me from barterdex or something but its risky whats your idea?

[20-Aug-19 09:20 PM] Danger#1604
@Lyper22

[20-Aug-19 09:24 PM] Lyper22#6886
can i use the web wallet to get my kmd with utrum?

[20-Aug-19 09:25 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so you can't access using version 0.5.7-4 ?

[20-Aug-19 09:25 PM] Lyper22#6886
no same problem as the other version

[20-Aug-19 09:25 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I've just tried it , it works fine on my end

[20-Aug-19 09:25 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
is it the antivirus?

[20-Aug-19 09:25 PM] Lyper22#6886
i have none

[20-Aug-19 09:26 PM] Lyper22#6886
was working perfectly with agama before the hack after that we all 4 cant access it on different computer with all the same error

[20-Aug-19 09:27 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477

Hi everybody! Antara Composer is impressive! I thinking about using it for a ‚Äúdemo‚Äù, do you know where I can find more information about the white label wallet option? Or who I can ask questions about it?

Received invalid pub address when trying to send from komodo wallet to verus. Any way to retrieve this.  Thank you in advance

[21-Aug-19 06:31 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
which komodo wallet?

[21-Aug-19 08:42 AM] bknox#8456
Agama wallet

[21-Aug-19 09:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
which version?

[21-Aug-19 10:04 AM] skitout#8659
Thank you very much @Instel7. I exchanged few messages with Chainzilla, and it seems an interesting option for a later stage. My question was about the ($500) white label wallet option within Antara Composer. Anyone know where I could find more info about it ?

[21-Aug-19 12:23 PM] bknox#8456
5 .7-4

[21-Aug-19 12:25 PM] gcharang#6833
@bknox make sure you are copy pasting the address exactly without missing any characters and that the capital and small letters are preserved

[21-Aug-19 12:29 PM] bknox#8456
Yes everything is the way it should be in that respect.

[21-Aug-19 12:41 PM] gcharang#6833
@bknox can you send me the address in a DM? I can verify if it is valid

[21-Aug-19 12:59 PM] Oszy#5734
@bknox from KomodoOcean to VerusAgama? are both the latest versions?

[21-Aug-19 01:01 PM] bknox#8456
Komodo agama to verus agama is what I was trying to do

[21-Aug-19 01:02 PM] Oszy#5734
there is no Komodo agama that is currently working, furthermore not recommended for use (daemon is outdated, and Agama versions before 0.5.7 are vulnerable if you missed the news in June),  export your private key from komodo agama, and import into verus agama is what you can do now. reason of the error you get is that you are most likely on a different old chain (before 14th July KMD fork)

[21-Aug-19 01:03 PM] Oszy#5734
then send it to a new address from verus agama

[21-Aug-19 01:03 PM] Oszy#5734
after that delete komodo agama forever

[21-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Oszy#5734
Are you using 12 word seed or native mode?

[21-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Oszy#5734
If seed, login with same seed in Verus Agama, but send to different address immediately.

[21-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Oszy#5734
If native, click on the 3 dots next to the public address you have in the old wallet

[21-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Oszy#5734
Export WIF

[21-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Oszy#5734
Then in Verus Agama, Import Key, paste the WIF.

[21-Aug-19 01:34 PM] bknox#8456
I'm in verus agama with old seed now.  So I export old komodo agama seed or new verus seed

[21-Aug-19 01:39 PM] gcharang#6833
you can just activate the coin which you have sent
then send the amount to te correct address @bknox

This is my first time trying to download a KMD desktop wallet and Im new to this discord. What is the best desktop wallet? I tried to install OceanQT but I keep getting an error that says "Cannot parse configuration file.  Only use key=value syntax." That's what I see as soon as I try to run the komodo-qt-win file. Thanks

[22-Aug-19 02:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you probably need to create a conf file - https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000027990-install-komodo-ocean-wallet-on-windows

[22-Aug-19 03:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Please note that Komodo Ocean is Native only, so you'll have to synch the chain which takes a few hours Here's a selction of alternative wallets - https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000027990-install-komodo-ocean-wallet-on-windows

[22-Aug-19 10:44 AM] Abdullah Ka#4805
I asked at thc support but they couldn‚Äôt help me regarding mac

I deleted the komodo folder and tried again but I got the same problem

[22-Aug-19 10:46 AM] Abdullah Ka#4805
I have new iMacs with latest MacOS

[22-Aug-19 12:22 PM] Oszy#5734
Little sidenote for the problem @Abdullah Ka has, he get's the error beucase he can't compile komodod properly on a mac, same as @BadAss problem, configure: error: Cannot enable RELRO

[22-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Abdullah Ka#4805
That‚Äôs true what is the solution?

[22-Aug-19 02:06 PM] gcharang#6833
@TonyL ^ any idea?

[22-Aug-19 02:10 PM] TonyL#3577
`configure: error: Cannot enable RELRO` @Oszy do you know on what repo/branch Abdullah and BadAss trying to compile?

[22-Aug-19 02:12 PM] TonyL#3577
can try compilation on my side, also it's good to doublecheck that all deps from this guide are installed https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/Installing-Komodo-Manually#installing-komodo-on-osx and `./build-mac.sh` script is using for compilation
