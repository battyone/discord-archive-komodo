True but looking fundamentals at this project is impossible to loose and more importantly you get educated

[24-Apr-19 01:45 PM] ch6ris#5240
no it is very easy to lose. there are no guarantees. It's a gamble. Any significant amount of money and you could be down 10k in one day. should I hodl and hope for the best. Only lose if I sell right.

[24-Apr-19 01:46 PM] bogybogy#3962
True but you try to belong to a strong community with real vision

[24-Apr-19 01:47 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so @ch6ris do you have a support query, or would you prefer to continue botting in #dev-tradebots?

[24-Apr-19 01:47 PM] ch6ris#5240

Gents  a great book to read about the banks in Switzerland and even rich guys they hate now the banks-who got time -Lucifer Bankers-Birkenfeld tells a lot of such things. For example, he says that after attracting a rich man to deposit enormous amounts to them, the bankers thought they would make sure that the man could not take his money anymore. Is that so! They were inventing time deposits and all sorts of gossip. When the depositor wanted to get out of money, which he usually felt and bite on his hat and signed some contracts without reading too well, he was faced with obstacles. There was a "compromise" by which the bank offered to give it a loan (out of its own money!) To which he paid and did

i'm getting an error when i run komodo in native mode

[25-Apr-19 05:56 AM] Draeth#3300
MANIFEST-306787: The handle is invalid.

[25-Apr-19 06:46 AM] Draeth#3300
here anyone around?

[25-Apr-19 07:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not sure on that one. which OS?

[25-Apr-19 07:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can you get far enough to reindex?

[25-Apr-19 07:19 AM] Draeth#3300
i downloaded the bootstrap and when i run agama, it gives me that error and won't load kmd

[25-Apr-19 07:19 AM] Draeth#3300
i even tried clearing out the komodo folder in roaming

[25-Apr-19 07:19 AM] Draeth#3300
and then putting in the bootstrap

[25-Apr-19 09:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
v3.5 portable?

[25-Apr-19 12:19 PM] Draeth#3300
Yep

[25-Apr-19 01:50 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
all I can see relating to that indicates it might be a windows update issue. are you running the chain data from usb?

[25-Apr-19 02:21 PM] Draeth#3300
Negative

[25-Apr-19 02:32 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've probably backup keys etc, purge everythin and try a clean slate install. 
start it up. if it works, stop daemon and exit. backup working data folders, then add bootstrap.
if that works, nice. if not, restore working dataa folders.

[25-Apr-19 02:33 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
reindex first if you can and havent tried.

[25-Apr-19 02:35 PM] Draeth#3300
Here's the thing. I tried doing this on another computer as well, one with no previous wallets. I started up agama in native mode, worked fine. I stopped the daemon, closed agama, pulled in the bootstrap, and when I started agama and put kmd in native mode, it still gives me that error

[25-Apr-19 02:36 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so bootstrap is issue.

[25-Apr-19 02:37 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
could try another bootstrap, or let it flow in naturally.

[25-Apr-19 02:37 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
either something missing or corrupted or in the wrong place or disgreeing with something else

[25-Apr-19 02:38 PM] Draeth#3300
Just to verify that im using the correct bootstrap,  could you shoot me a link?

[25-Apr-19 02:40 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I can link , they update periodically so if error was in lsat grab, might be ok now.
if still no good, I'll test bootstrap on my end to confirm, but I'm not on windows. if it works for me, likely a windows issue. if you;ve tried 2 pcs, doesnt sound like its hardware

Hey guys, I'm having an issue constructing transactions (for KMD and assetchain coins) via the komodod daemon. Used to be working fine, but as of now, it's returning transactions which fail with the tx-overwinter-expired error. I ran decoderawtransaction on one of them, and it seems to be fine, expiry height being higher than block height. Is there any way to tell the daemon to use a 0 expiry height or anything like that? Thanks

[30-Apr-19 04:42 PM] SHossain#0007
@komodoman13 did you compile komodod by yourself or using any prebuilt binary?

[30-Apr-19 04:43 PM] SHossain#0007
are you using latest bin?
is your chain fully synced?

[30-Apr-19 04:43 PM] komodoman13#4364
I think prebuilt, I'm not the one who set it up, but we did update it recently and checked that it's not out of sync

[30-Apr-19 04:44 PM] SHossain#0007
what `KMDversion` you see when you use `getinfo` call?

[30-Apr-19 04:45 PM] komodoman13#4364
0.3.3b

[30-Apr-19 04:46 PM] SHossain#0007
is the chain that you are tyring to use fully synced?

[30-Apr-19 04:46 PM] SHossain#0007
post your command and the error output you see

[30-Apr-19 04:47 PM] komodoman13#4364
Yes, give or take 1-2 blocks.

[30-Apr-19 04:48 PM] komodoman13#4364
The actual command is a little bit more difficult, I don't use the daemon to broadcast it, but I tried this site:
https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/send

With the raw transaction I got from calling the daemon. The error I got was 
`An error occured:
16: tx-overwinter-expired. Code:-26`

[30-Apr-19 04:48 PM] komodoman13#4364
I'm using createrawtransaction and signrawtransaction to create it

[30-Apr-19 04:50 PM] komodoman13#4364
Right, so put a hold on all that

[30-Apr-19 04:51 PM] komodoman13#4364
Was using an assetchain tx on sending here so the error isn't the actual error I'm getting. My bad. Still failing, but I'll see if I can figure out a reason for that. Sorry about wasting your time.

[30-Apr-19 04:53 PM] SHossain#0007
which tx version you see when you decode the raw transaction?

[30-Apr-19 05:04 PM] komodoman13#4364
4, but as I said, the expiry issue is probably not the real error due to me messing up haha, so thanks for the help anyway

[01-May-19 11:48 AM] Lennart#9331
hello, in Agama I have "fetch fiat rates" option, now I noticed that with the DEX coin Agama gets the information from CoinGecko, and that seems to be a very different DEX coin on there

[01-May-19 11:48 AM] Lennart#9331
maybe fetch the rates from coinexchange.io?

Sent some KMD to Digital Price yesterday but still haven't arrived.
On their KMD wallet section it still says: 
"Deposit temporary disabled for this coin
Deposits have been disabled for maintenance"
Any idea when this will be fixed?

I would not post the Give away link here....But yeah, i send them BTC from their link, and you suppose to get 10 time back......i trust them because i though it was from Official Komodo Twitter comment post.

[08-May-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
if it sounds too good to be true, then likely its a scam

[08-May-19 01:12 PM] super55#6449
Somehow in my mind, due to this bear market the BitcoinFoundation decide to do give away for real...plus i though it was post from Komodo Official, lol

[08-May-19 03:52 PM] PTYX#6840
@super55 you trusted someone to send you 10 times the amount you paid in BTC?

If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.

Hi there, i am trying to parse the komodo chain through the komodod api. I've set txindex to 1 in the conf from the beginning and even tried reindexing with txindex set to 1. I however only get transaction id's in the returned block, instead of full transaction objects. Furthermore i see no supported api call to get a whole transaction, the only function documented get's the seperate outputs of a transaction. Lastly  when trying gettransaction (bitcoind's call for returning transactions), i get the following error: "code":-5,"message":"Invalid or non-wallet transaction id"
Anyone any idea how i can get full transactions returned from the API?

[10-May-19 08:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Use `getrawtransaction`

[10-May-19 08:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`gettransaction` only references the native wallet.dat

@Jet I know there are some 3rd party projects with bounties looking for translators for whitepapers, websites, and  GUIs, perhaps you can try looking in that section. But Community Support is, as far as I can tell, all volunteers. perhaps Komodo core team may have something
