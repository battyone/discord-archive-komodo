[matrix] <nabob:matrix.org> please check to compare with explorer
https://explorer.utrum.io

if you are on native mode, check to rescan your wallet

Hi, I'm not able to see my balance for BCH or LTC running native BarterDEX. Any ideas on how to fix this?

[25-Jun-18 09:07 AM] CrisF#3405
KMD native shows my balance.

[25-Jun-18 09:13 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, I might try a rescan üëÜ  too.

[25-Jun-18 10:40 AM] CrisF#3405
No change after rescan.

[25-Jun-18 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
From your errors above, your conf files are in the wrong place.

[25-Jun-18 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
copy a coy of them from where ever they are to the correct folder and make sure they have:
rpcuser=auser

[25-Jun-18 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rpcpassword=apassword
server=1

[25-Jun-18 10:57 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks.  I'll have a look.

[25-Jun-18 11:11 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r  The `litecoin.conf` is in `.litecoin`.  I did `calcaddress` on the password then `validateaddress`.
`ismine` is false.

[25-Jun-18 11:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Do I need to `importprivkey` in litecoin?

[25-Jun-18 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
what is iswatchonly

[25-Jun-18 11:15 AM] CrisF#3405
false

[25-Jun-18 11:16 AM] CrisF#3405
isvalid:true

[25-Jun-18 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
and you ran mm?

[25-Jun-18 11:21 AM] CrisF#3405
barterdex-cli

[25-Jun-18 11:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Many prints like this ```<<<<<<<<<<< A bitcoind_RPC: LTC post_process_bitcoind_RPC.validateaddress
<<<<<<<<<<< A bitcoind_RPC: LTC post_process_bitcoind_RPC.getinfo```

[25-Jun-18 11:29 AM] CrisF#3405
Also, `./litecoin-cli getaddressesbyaccount ""`  shows a different address than `validateaddress` shows for litecoin.conf

[25-Jun-18 12:48 PM] cipi#4502
this prints indicate that mm can't connect to the wallet daemon

[25-Jun-18 03:37 PM] Alecandro#1179
Is anyone able to help me figure out why my agama wallet won‚Äôt connect to servers on Mac? Firewall is good, internet is good, everything looks fine, but wallet won‚Äôt pull balances- shows alert about electroneum servers. Try switching manually in settings > SPV servers, still nothing

[25-Jun-18 03:50 PM] Hermes#6934
Hi there which version of the wallet you currently have?

[25-Jun-18 09:46 PM] Lampon#4666
how to enable atomic swap eth for first time? i cant add coin

[25-Jun-18 09:51 PM] Hermes#6934
Go to add coin then select etomic on electrum mode

[25-Jun-18 09:51 PM] Hermes#6934
You can also use it on native mode , when you enable etomic you should be able to trade eth

[25-Jun-18 09:52 PM] Hermes#6934
depending on the orders that are available remember that barterdex is peer to peer.

[25-Jun-18 10:15 PM] 1TheGhostProject#3962
please need help with the agama  wallet

[25-Jun-18 10:34 PM] Hermes#6934
Hello which issue are you facing ? @1TheGhostProject

[25-Jun-18 10:37 PM] 1TheGhostProject#3962
the wallet wont connect when i create one using svp

[25-Jun-18 10:42 PM] Hermes#6934
Ok already responded in Agama

[26-Jun-18 12:23 AM] Cranky#9935
How long should it take for a deposit to show up once confirmed on the network?

[26-Jun-18 12:41 AM] yorklab#7270
I have a surface 3 tablet and a desktop (Windows). In both machines the Agama SPV had not been able to connect to the SPV server for about a week now. When trying to switch servers in settings nothing seems to happen on the desktop, but the surface tablet will come up with a red box in the lower right hand corner saying ‚Äútcp is unreachable‚Äù. This may be unrelated but at about the same time Agama native on the desktop will reach about 98% then stall there. I tried 2.39 and 2.4 on both machines. The desktop has AVG (I did put in exceptions) and the Surface tablet only has what came with windows (no off the shelf anti-virus). I was unable to change the Socket Timeout and using the proxy did not help. as instructed here:

https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/353075201/How+to+solve+SPV+connectivity+issues+when+using+Agama+in+lite+SPV+mode

[26-Jun-18 12:43 AM] Alecandro#1179
Sweet! Thanks for the share! Will try when I get home

[26-Jun-18 12:56 AM] Cranky#9935
Ticket 9425 logged for above.

[26-Jun-18 01:00 AM] yorklab#7270
I was messing around with both 2.39 and 2.4 and realized when I couldn't change the Socket Timeout I was using 2.39. I loaded 2.4 and was able to change the Socket Timeout but still no luck.

[26-Jun-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <nabob:matrix.org> you need to enable "use proxy" and relauch wallet to take effect

[26-Jun-18 01:34 AM] yorklab#7270
Relaunching did it, thank you. It does say to do a soft logout on the How-to article, which is what I did the first time after clicking on the "Save app config" button.

[26-Jun-18 01:46 AM] Alecandro#1179
so my agama wallet wont let me change the socket timeout by 10000

[26-Jun-18 01:49 AM] yorklab#7270
I had that issue with 2.39. I loaded 2.4 and then it let me change it.

[26-Jun-18 01:51 AM] Alecandro#1179
did you load 2.4 from the link above?

[26-Jun-18 01:51 AM] Alecandro#1179
jk from the agama channel

[26-Jun-18 01:51 AM] yorklab#7270
https://artifacts.supernet.org/latest/

[26-Jun-18 01:51 AM] Alecandro#1179
thanks

[26-Jun-18 01:52 AM] Hermes#6934
let us know if that solves the issue

[26-Jun-18 02:02 AM] Alecandro#1179
so I went from 10,000 to 20,000 to 30,000, soft logout and logged back in and now it just says "synchronization in progress" and nothing is happening. need to wait longer or do the next step?

[26-Jun-18 02:05 AM] Alecandro#1179
ayyy got it. thanks!!

Should my List of Unspent Transactions (UTXOs) always be blank and show Loading... ? I'm getting this on all coins including CRDS which is not showing my missing deposits (ticket 9425)

[26-Jun-18 04:46 AM] Cranky#9935
Anyone?

[26-Jun-18 04:54 AM] Cranky#9935
I've added these to my wallet.conf file for Credits (no idea if these are required as not documented);

server=1
txindex=1
rpcbind=127.0.0.1

Restarted my Credits wallet and then BarterDEX but no change.

[26-Jun-18 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need 
```rpcuser=arandomuser
rpcpassword=arandompassword```
in there too, or marketmaker cannot speak to the native deamon.

[26-Jun-18 05:00 AM] Cranky#9935
Yes they are there by default

[26-Jun-18 05:00 AM] Cranky#9935
Here is the whole file with user/pass changed
```
#Do not use special characters with username/password
rpcuser=notforyou
rpcpassword=notmypassword
rpcport=31050
port=31000
server=1
txindex=1
rpcbind=127.0.0.1
#gen=1
#genproclimit=1
maxconnections=10
#testnet=1
```

[26-Jun-18 05:01 AM] Cranky#9935
could be the maxconnections I guess, I'll comment it out

[26-Jun-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[26-Jun-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
start barterdex, login

[26-Jun-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then exit it

[26-Jun-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then stop your deamon and start it with -rescan

[26-Jun-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the reluanch barterdex and login with the same seed.

[26-Jun-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this will fix it

[26-Jun-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
üëç

[26-Jun-18 05:06 AM] Cranky#9935
ok, I'm running QT, not a daemon. Have restarted the wallet with -rescan at any rate

[26-Jun-18 05:07 AM] Cranky#9935
same seed phrase you mean?

[26-Jun-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> yes, that happens is the marketmaker imports the address as watchonly, to your local wallet.

[26-Jun-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> without a rescan, so if you send funds to it, before barterdex is open i cannt see them.

[26-Jun-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> rescan will fix 99% of the time using native.

[26-Jun-18 06:16 AM] LocoMB#8593
hi guys!
I am having trouble with Agama connectivity.. I increased socket timeout to 20000 and now I get stuck in 'synchronization' and the console throws stuff like:
TypeError: "msecs" argument must be a number
    at Object.exports.enroll (timers.js:398:11)
    at Socket.setTimeout (net.js:385:12)

[26-Jun-18 06:16 AM] LocoMB#8593
and
Unhandled rejection TypeError: "msecs" argument must be a number
    at Object.exports.enroll (timers.js:398:11)
    at Socket.setTimeout (net.js:385:12)

[26-Jun-18 06:18 AM] LocoMB#8593
and a red popup on Agama that says Error 'shepherdElectrumTransactions'

[26-Jun-18 06:29 AM] Cranky#9935

They are working on a solution

[26-Jun-18 01:34 PM] Lyper22#6886
ok cool! thanks!

[26-Jun-18 01:48 PM] Shinsoo#0021
hi guys my seed and pin/pw gives tajes me to different address.

[26-Jun-18 01:48 PM] Shinsoo#0021
it was working on 18th june i deposited some kmd and now i hav lost it

[26-Jun-18 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you got 2 different KMD addys, then you used 2 different phrases

[26-Jun-18 01:50 PM] gcharang#6833
Agama spv servers have some issues right now. Are you sure it is now displaying a different address? If you are not sure, please wait till spv servers are working properly again to check your balance. Or you can check your address in a block explorer to verify if you have the funds

[26-Jun-18 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
extra <space> maybe?

[26-Jun-18 01:51 PM] gcharang#6833
If you are using the password system, there is no way agama will display different address as the seed is stored by agama and you are not retyping it

[26-Jun-18 01:55 PM] Shinsoo#0021
ye doesnt make sense. this pin pw was showing me the address with balance on 18th and now it shows me diffrent address with o balance.

[26-Jun-18 01:57 PM] gcharang#6833
Are you using lite mode?

[26-Jun-18 02:01 PM] Jonathan#3687
When you open the app is the first screen you see the login screen or the screen to activate a coin/pick between native and spv? If it's a login screen sign in like you did before then do a complete logout

[26-Jun-18 02:02 PM] Shinsoo#0021
yes litw mode

[26-Jun-18 02:02 PM] Shinsoo#0021
lite*

[26-Jun-18 02:04 PM] gcharang#6833
Do you login by typing in a field named `password` or in a field named `Wallet seed/WIF` ?

[26-Jun-18 02:16 PM] Shinsoo#0021
password

[26-Jun-18 02:17 PM] Shinsoo#0021
i have tried all the spaces before and at end stil no luck

[26-Jun-18 02:19 PM] gcharang#6833
If you are using password, only the correct password will let you login. So if you are logging in using a password, that means you are logging into the same wallet address as you previously used. First login and copy the address  and search it here: https://kmd.explorer.supernet.org
You might see your balance
