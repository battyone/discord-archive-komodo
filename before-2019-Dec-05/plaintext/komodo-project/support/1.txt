I try to claim the interest from the KMD on my Ledger Nano S. I followed all the instructions from PTYX on Youtube. But balance stays zero.

@Bing  make sure you have the latest version and try a restart

[18-Jun-18 03:09 AM] Bing#9724
I've restarted it tons of times

[18-Jun-18 03:10 AM] Bing#9724

[18-Jun-18 03:43 AM] Bing#9724
ok yeah updated to 1.0.7-rc @Hermes and the speed deposits are still not showing up correctly

[18-Jun-18 03:55 AM] Hermes#6934
Currently I am out of desk please send us a ticket at support@komodoplatform.com and we will look into it

[18-Jun-18 04:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
@J-Mack the reward comes when you claim it, it doesn't matter what wallet you were using the time before the claim. 
You cannot claim reward with a paper wallet (it is paper, right?), so you need to, at least, once a month, claim with Agama or other wallet.

Is there an explorer for SUPERNET?  I tried sending some SUPERNET to coinexchange and haven't seen it arrive.  I have the tx id to look up if there is an explorer..

[18-Jun-18 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
http://supernet.explorer.supernet.org/ but it tends to need manual updating

[18-Jun-18 02:33 PM] ranfoltu#0306
Thanks, yeah seems like that one is broken for now

[18-Jun-18 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's not "broken"; the auto update has been stuck for quite some time
if you pick a block and then keep click ing the "next" arrow, eventually you can get every block to show

[slack] <lsteele> thanks. Can seem to edit the timeout, but at any rate I can telnet to 10001 and promptly connect, so not sure that bumping the timeout is going to help much.

Is it normal that my order on BarterDex is sometimes not shown in the order book for 2 minutes? SPV on both Tradingpairs

[19-Jun-18 09:08 AM] Acura#2748
After that, it always appears automatically in the order book.

[19-Jun-18 09:08 AM] Acura#2748
BarterDex 1.07

[19-Jun-18 10:00 AM] PTYX#6840
it's normal because the orderbooks are p2p

just opened the agama wallet after a few weeks of having it closed and it said  "Connection error!
Trying to switch to another server..."  noticed  there was an updated wallet 0.2.39 so downloaded it but am still getting the server notification.   Also got this notification bellow "Go to "Settings", select "SPV Server List" tab, choose new server and click "OK"., so went to settings and clicked where it says SPV, it showed two different  ones. I tired them both but still get zero balance.   How can i fix this?

[20-Jun-18 06:11 AM] Dragon#3301
first time this happened

[20-Jun-18 06:11 AM] Dragon#3301

@ranfoltu  you can use the api to speed things up and save wear and tear on your mouse.
http://supernet.explorer.supernet.org/api/getblockcount  (returns latest block height)
http://supernet.explorer.supernet.org/api/getblockhash?index=9999   (replace 9999 with the block height number; this call retunrs the hash of that block)
http://supernet.explorer.supernet.org/api/getblock?hash=0e8b23336f9f06e1f024cde809b9c76e64d53f6cf5aa7bf11fd5a8296c89a2ee   (use the hash from the api call above)

Hello, is it best to tranfer from exchange to Ledger or to Agama first and then setup Ledger to claim interest?

[20-Jun-18 02:46 PM] Hermes#6934
@Dean of Crypto You can do it directly to Agama first

If that doesn‚Äôt help you can use the same seed of Barterdex in Agama and you should be able to manage your funds there

In order to be able to use BCH on Agama you need to enable special features on settings tab under app config you will see this option
