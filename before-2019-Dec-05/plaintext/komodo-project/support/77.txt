where are you getting 4% from?

[21-Mar-19 02:17 PM] DmanXX#2257
From my calculations

[21-Mar-19 02:18 PM] DmanXX#2257
How much kmd should I get every month from 10,000 KMD?

[21-Mar-19 02:19 PM] ch6ris#5240
5.1% üòã

[21-Mar-19 02:19 PM] DmanXX#2257
Exactly which is 510kmd

[21-Mar-19 02:20 PM] ch6ris#5240
Yeah it's 5.1% pa on average. lots of variables.

[21-Mar-19 02:22 PM] LeshAft9#0083
DmanXX are you using the atomicwallet Ledger KMD Reward Claim webpage? if so, they take 5% of your reward to support their development

[21-Mar-19 02:22 PM] LeshAft9#0083
oh sorry I see you're using Agama

[21-Mar-19 02:22 PM] DmanXX#2257
No I‚Äôm using Agama Mac OS 0.3.4

[21-Mar-19 02:23 PM] DmanXX#2257
It‚Äôs no big deal it‚Äôs few kmd just want to find out how it‚Äôs calculated

[21-Mar-19 02:23 PM] ch6ris#5240
i.e maybe you claim once a week, locktime needs to be set for 1 hour before rewards start accruing. you could end up with 50 hours over the year without rewards accruing.

[21-Mar-19 02:24 PM] DmanXX#2257
I‚Äôm claiming every month

[21-Mar-19 02:25 PM] ch6ris#5240
at the exact moment in time they stop accruing? I don't know much. But my math shows its pretty damn close to 5%. I have seen very minor variables.

Also I‚Äôm using kmd calc

[21-Mar-19 02:26 PM] DmanXX#2257
Yeap that one

[21-Mar-19 02:26 PM] DmanXX#2257
But I‚Äôm getting less from Agama

[21-Mar-19 02:27 PM] CHMEX#0686
what is your address? maybe you have a lot of small utxo which do not accrue

[21-Mar-19 02:27 PM] DmanXX#2257
No I send it to my self whole amount

[21-Mar-19 02:28 PM] CHMEX#0686
ok

[21-Mar-19 02:28 PM] ch6ris#5240
Well when you claim it should create one utxo plus another for the rewards.

[21-Mar-19 02:28 PM] DmanXX#2257
Yes

[21-Mar-19 02:28 PM] DmanXX#2257
I have large amount plus smaller one

[21-Mar-19 02:28 PM] ch6ris#5240
workaround is send the transaction to yourself twice.

[21-Mar-19 02:30 PM] DmanXX#2257
The thing is that kmd atomic calculator is showing completely different amount from what I am getting in Agama

[21-Mar-19 02:30 PM] DmanXX#2257
It could be a glitch

[21-Mar-19 02:32 PM] ch6ris#5240
I doubt it. It isn't perfect. The change to claiming once a month was only made recently. You would need 12 months of perfectly timed claims to really see the full picture.

Not really in that calculator you have option to see how much you going to get first month

[21-Mar-19 02:34 PM] ch6ris#5240
it went from claiming once every 12 months to once a month. which theoretically increased the possible rewards by .1%

[21-Mar-19 02:35 PM] DmanXX#2257
And my payout is smaller by few kmd

[21-Mar-19 02:36 PM] ch6ris#5240
Someone more experienced could chime in, I have seen no problem on my end they are not always perfect but I assume it will average out over the year.

[21-Mar-19 02:36 PM] DmanXX#2257
Can any of the developers look into it?

[21-Mar-19 02:38 PM] ch6ris#5240
I honestly don't think there's a problem. @CHMEX ^^^

Cool let me know if you need anything from me

`APR rate: 5.111%

Expenses not included in calculation: 0.0012 KMD in transaction fees, 12 hour(s) gap period when no rewards are accrued.

Your actual amounts will be less than what is presented in the table.

Q: What will happen to my KMD rewards after 1 year period is passed.

A: It will stop accruing and remain fixed until it is claimed.`

[21-Mar-19 02:43 PM] DmanXX#2257
Yes I understand but It wouldn‚Äôt be few KMD

[21-Mar-19 02:59 PM] pbca26#5430
5% per year not per month!
have a look at monthly breakdown on atomicexplorer's rewards calc and compare to your actual claimed rewards

`Changes to KMD rewards past block height 1 000 000:

    new KMD coins are rewarded to users when they make transactions
    total rate is ~5.1% per year if done monthly or more often
    you stop getting rewards if you haven't used Komodo network for one month (coins haven't moved in one month)
    new changes don't affect rewards accrued under old rules`

tried ZEN and it didn't work... `op-checkblockatheight-needed` was the error and i think it had something to do with a replay protection they had implemented

[26-Mar-19 10:18 AM] Don King#8901
Is there a kmd block explorer that shows ALL transaction history? The ones I have seen only show last 10 tx

It shoudl not matter but maybe you are on a mobile device?

[26-Mar-19 10:24 AM] CHMEX#0686
On a browser just scroll down and it loads the next 10

[26-Mar-19 10:42 AM] Don King#8901
I'm using chrome on Windows 10, for some reason it doesn't load the next 10. Can I add something to the url to get all tx?

I couldn't get agama csv export to work either, always gets an error. I think my PC needs a kick lol

[26-Mar-19 11:11 AM] CHMEX#0686
I can imagine

[26-Mar-19 11:13 AM] Don King#8901
Would be so much easier if I could get the agama csv export to work, doing each tx by hand is gonna take me ages

[26-Mar-19 11:13 AM] Don King#8901
Maybe I install komodo QT, it has nice easy tx export probably like most other wallets

[26-Mar-19 11:15 AM] Alright#0419
@Don King are you using the latest version of Agama?

[26-Mar-19 11:15 AM] Alright#0419
believe that bug was fixed

[26-Mar-19 11:18 AM] Don King#8901
V0.3.4-beta

[26-Mar-19 11:18 AM] Alright#0419
what happens when you click the export button?

[26-Mar-19 11:20 AM] Don King#8901
It sits there saying 'generating csv' but the file never gets created, then eventually an error message appears in bottom RH corner. Tried adjusting the settings for how many tx but even with only 50 tx it never works

[26-Mar-19 11:21 AM] Don King#8901
Can you do csv on cli ?

[26-Mar-19 12:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
lite mode or native?

[26-Mar-19 12:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I think lite might timeout if too many tx, you'd have more luck in native

[26-Mar-19 12:23 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`komodo-cli listtransactions` would also work, but you'll have to parse the json

[26-Mar-19 12:27 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`komodo-cli listreceivedbyaddress`

[26-Mar-19 12:32 PM] Don King#8901

sendtoaddress balance - 0.0001 <dest>

[31-Mar-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
where dest can be any address you control, but simplest if it is the passphrase based address as you know you have a backup

[31-Mar-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
then the change will be the claimed rewards

[31-Mar-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
getinfo will show the approx amount that is available to claim

Some time ago I asked here if here at Komodo you were going to also create a stable coin with privacy features, but I don't think there was much interest in this. I just realised that there's one called Lumini now being created with MimbleWimble, just thought it might be of interest in case your plans change:
