i'm trying to build a basic komodo asset chain to test with and learn. I have 2 VPS set up with komodo, and i follow instructions to build and connect them. All seems to go well, but when I try to getwalletinfo or query the asset chain, i get "error: couldn't connect to server: unknown (code -1) (make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)"
could anyone help me out? i'm also getting Error: Cannot find the Zcash network parameters in the following directory: "/root/.zcash-params"

[18-Jan-19 10:39 PM] Hermes#6934
This can be the problem Cannot find the Zcash network parameters in the following directory: "/root/.zcash-params"

[18-Jan-19 10:40 PM] Hermes#6934
Please make sure you have downloaded the zcash params

[18-Jan-19 10:40 PM] Hermes#6934
this takes some time make sure both nodes have them

[18-Jan-19 10:42 PM] SHossain#0007
zcash params should be in `~/.zcash-params`

[18-Jan-19 10:42 PM] Justaguy#6181
yeah, I don't have them at all. That must be it

[18-Jan-19 10:43 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to use `./zcutil/fetch-params.sh` from inside komodo dir after cloning the repo into VPS

[18-Jan-19 10:44 PM] Hermes#6934
Make sure you are using this guide first before launching an assetchain https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html

[18-Jan-19 10:45 PM] Hermes#6934
no need to launch Komodo just use till the part where  it explains how to compile the komodo binaries and also the komodo folder-

[18-Jan-19 10:47 PM] Justaguy#6181
ok cool, thanks for the help!

Hi Guys, 
I think I have some trouble running the zmigrate_launcher.exe on windows (I would like to move my PIRATE from zc to zs). 
When I click the "start zmigrate" button the windows prompt briefly appears, a notification box appears, but nothing really happens in agama (even after 1 hour). 
I think I'm not the first experiencing this issue, if anyone could point me the right direction to solve this it would be great.
Thanks !

[21-Jan-19 09:56 PM] SHossain#0007
which actual error is that? it shoould be displayed few lines above.
you can try `./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)` 3-4 times

[21-Jan-19 09:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't see any other error indications

[21-Jan-19 09:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'll try doing it again

[21-Jan-19 09:57 PM] SHossain#0007
run the command 3-4 times. if this is cryptoconditions related issue, it will compile after few times

[21-Jan-19 10:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, now an actual error is showing up.

looks cryptoconditions related.

cryptoconditions/src/utils.c:25:10 

can't find cryptoconditions.h

[21-Jan-19 10:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'll try again (4th)

[21-Jan-19 10:04 PM] SHossain#0007
if this doesn't work after trying multiple times, just delete current source and clone fresh again

[21-Jan-19 10:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, it finally worked

[21-Jan-19 10:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

[21-Jan-19 10:10 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, 4th is the time when it should build. otherwise, i go for fresh clone

@SHossain  Why you keep having documentation showing that Komodo has Z transactions if ...Z transactions are not available for Komodo anymore?

Did you made the last guide? Why in this guide there is no explanation of what a Z transaction is ? Even though this is not going be used anymore in the future.

[22-Jan-19 03:10 AM] QualityASSURANCE#1813
So If I want to look for the actual information I have to look into two guides....hmmmm

[22-Jan-19 03:11 AM] QualityASSURANCE#1813
Good night

[22-Jan-19 04:38 AM] TonyL#3577
@QualityASSURANCE#1813 Thanks for your feedback! It's a good idea to add reference to "What is a Z transaction" article in article about z-transactions performing. If put all the information to the same article it will be not much relevant.
 As you can find in a guide: `Sprout z address will be deprecated in 15th February on Komodo (KMD)` so there is almost one more month for Z addresses usage with KMD chain and it's available at the moment. And even after update there will be an assetchain with Z transactions and CC support so this guide will need just a little adjustment.

[22-Jan-19 04:45 AM] TonyL#3577
There is "Related articles" tab also by the way

[22-Jan-19 05:21 AM] QualityASSURANCE#1813
Both guides explain the same...if you noticed...I think that the person that made the new guide maybe didn't saw this... and by the way....I was seeing that one of the advantages...of not having the Z address implementation was that now....you can encrypt your wallet... in native mode

[22-Jan-19 05:21 AM] QualityASSURANCE#1813
so this guide shouldn't be here neither https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024441-why-can-t-i-encrypt-komodo-wallet-wallet-dat-in-native-mode-

You should erase this section if you are not updating it

[22-Jan-19 05:32 AM] Nabob#5004
@QualityASSURANCE  he added important points to that document, we will takecare of guides after one month when we fully disable kmd z funds. wallet encryption needs to be throughly tested before implementing  on kmd.

[22-Jan-19 05:34 AM] QualityASSURANCE#1813
Yeah most likely the writer of the new guide made the mistake of not seeing the previous one ...thanks for the info @Nabob

[22-Jan-19 05:45 AM] QualityASSURANCE#1813

I love Komodo , I was seeing it since 2017 but entered last year... I have a few observations that users...might be noticing as well... for some reason we stopped receiving Video guides with the new features of the wallet...and all of this type of content went away....I don't know who is the Support Manager but I would like to see more engagement from this person and the community....I think that the last Support Manager was doing a terrific job with this type of content...but I think he is on a separate project with Magnum or Zilla team.... Remember that as a team people notice when things change...so if the new support manager wants to  keep his users...engaged...I would like to see more interaction from him with the help of his marketing team.... Komodo to the moon ! üöÄ

[22-Jan-19 01:26 PM] NexGen#3077
so my real question would be....why this type of content stopped?

[22-Jan-19 01:31 PM] NexGen#3077
I also don't see the CEO of Komodo doing any marketing or videos as well for Komodo...but that's a different subject.

[22-Jan-19 01:35 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I think alot has changed since those videos were made and new ones will need to be made. The devs are working real hard on new tech that is not something to be mass marketed yet. Do not confuse other projects that market fluff more than developing the project.

[22-Jan-19 01:36 PM] NexGen#3077
@QualityASSURANCE  I think that instead of focusing in their guides....if they already have the new features of the wallet in  in their support page...available for all users.... why they haven't made a new video of these features for months ? I like your criticism but your criticism is incomplete üòã

[22-Jan-19 01:38 PM] NexGen#3077
But I like what you did there...for reference in the guides....all of the guides have different types of letters... and font types....you owe me a tip QualityAssurance üòé

[22-Jan-19 01:42 PM] Hermes#6934
@CryptoNinjaa  Yeah I  just wanted to give my opinion in things I have been seeing for months.... remember that even in the videos that they have posted right now...they are using an old version of the wallet...so maybe lets not present the new features until they are complete as you say. But maybe just make a quick video of the newest wallet every 6 months? l Love you all üòÉ
