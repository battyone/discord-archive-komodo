@EC @Punisher send me the old address through DM

[07-Aug-19 07:04 AM] gcharang#6833
`gcharang#4993` is definitely not me
Please make sure the username and tags match from this server before responding to anyone in direct messages

[07-Aug-19 07:26 AM] gcharang#6833
@daro3 I've seen the screenshots
I am not sure what the problem is
you can try using the KomodoOcean wallet
https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-4
https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000027990-install-komodo-ocean-wallet-on-windows

you should be able to use the KomodoOcean wallet directly without moving any files around as you previously used the Agama wallet

and ping me if you need more help

Hello there, I have recently come to realise about the agama hacking incident which took place in May/June. When trying to access my agama wallet I get the following message: ‚ÄúConnection error. Trying to switch to another server.‚Äù Therefore, I am unable to discern whether the wallet has my funds in it or whether it has been 'hacked'. Can I get some support please?

[07-Aug-19 06:32 PM] Jared#8979
^ Similar situation, I put my address into dexstats.info.

[07-Aug-19 06:32 PM] Jared#8979
I guess the KMD is still in there, but i'm unsure how to proceed

[08-Aug-19 03:05 PM] Edu Onochie#6328
Last night I was contacted through DM by gcharang, which I now have realized was gcharang#4993

[08-Aug-19 03:05 PM] Edu Onochie#6328
He told me the following:

[08-Aug-19 03:06 PM] Edu Onochie#6328
I had not done it yet, but I was planning to do it soon enough. I thought it was the same gcharang as the support team member... Thank God I didnt install that shit

[08-Aug-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
DONT DOWNLOAD IT

[08-Aug-19 03:07 PM] Oszy#5734
don't do anything

[08-Aug-19 03:07 PM] Oszy#5734
fake user was banned this morning i realized there were 2 of them

[08-Aug-19 03:07 PM] Edu Onochie#6328
Its probably some fukt up mega virus thieving tool, right?

[08-Aug-19 03:08 PM] Oszy#5734
probably a fake wallet to enter your seed or keylogger

[08-Aug-19 03:08 PM] gcharang#6833
most likely, it will sweep your wallet.dats or pin files

[08-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Edu Onochie#6328
mate, honestly, this crypto stuff is pretty scary... one bad move and you get all your stull stolen from you

[08-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Edu Onochie#6328

[08-Aug-19 03:09 PM] gcharang#6833
yeah, did you see my last message in this channel?

[08-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Edu Onochie#6328
I just read your message in the official channel and thats what rang the alarm. Last night I noticed that your message in the support channel didnt quite match the DM message I got, but it was late and I didnt think it through. Luckily have still not made any moves yet.

[08-Aug-19 03:12 PM] gcharang#6833

[08-Aug-19 11:55 PM] Edu Onochie#6328
@gcharang so i followed your instructions and my KMD funds are there in my wallet. Does that mean they were never 'hacked' by the KMD security team?

[09-Aug-19 07:01 AM] Oszy#5734
If it's there it mean you were not affected, I'd still move the funds just in case.

[09-Aug-19 08:16 AM] gcharang#6833
@Edu Onochie yes, that means the team hasn't moved your coins
now you can create a new wallet in Verus Agama, backup its seed phrase, verify that signing in with the seed phrase gives the same address as the wallet name and pin
then transfer the coins to the new address

Hi guys, I initiated a swap of 1.25 Rick for 0.625 Morty which went through no problem, apart from the swap progress circle only showing two thirds of the circle on my tablet. I then tried to swap 0.625 Morty for 1.25 Rick, I chose a swap and this didn't go through, instead it moved to orders and has sat there since the 1st August and is still there. I then swapped 1.25 Morty for 0.625 Rick which completed, I now have exactly  the same amount of Rick and Morty and one order which is just hanging around, is this correct?

hello, I tried to send some of my KMD to from the agama wallet to binance and the transaction is present on my transaction history but there have been 0 confirmations and I have not received the KMD on my binance account. I have let the wallet up over night to try to connect to the block chain but it sits at 1-4 connections and goes back down to 0. is there anything I can do?

If it has, contact binance support. If not, your wallet might need to be updated.

Hey friends.
I have my Agama wallet address and password. Is there a way to manually input the wallet address? It just keeps providing and address for me and doesn‚Äôt let me edit or type over it.

[10-Aug-19 09:07 PM] Oszy#5734
Are you trying to login Lite Mode?

[10-Aug-19 09:08 PM] Oszy#5734
In native, you can import your private key to add the address to the wallet.

[11-Aug-19 09:32 AM] Oszy#5734

[11-Aug-19 09:41 AM] Razzler04#2552
how do I reindex?

[11-Aug-19 09:41 AM] Oszy#5734
create a shortcut and put `-reindex` after .exe

[11-Aug-19 09:41 AM] Oszy#5734
and start it

[11-Aug-19 09:41 AM] Razzler04#2552
ok

[11-Aug-19 09:42 AM] Oszy#5734
will take a while and do it only once

[11-Aug-19 09:46 AM] Razzler04#2552
i can see that, back to 2 years behind

[11-Aug-19 09:46 AM] Razzler04#2552
I've just done this only a couple of days ago

[11-Aug-19 09:46 AM] Razzler04#2552
I wish you told me this first

[11-Aug-19 09:46 AM] Razzler04#2552
it will take me two to three days now to find out if this evens works

[11-Aug-19 09:47 AM] Razzler04#2552
what is up with Komodo now?  since the Agama bug its all falling apart
