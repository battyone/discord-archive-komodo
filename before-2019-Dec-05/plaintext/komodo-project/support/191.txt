can I find help here to solve a problem with Ledger KMD Reward Claim?

[24-Nov-19 05:34 PM] Arno#3334
probably

[24-Nov-19 05:34 PM] Arno#3334
@Elmis

[24-Nov-19 05:45 PM] Elmis#0347
when I conect my  ledger, open the Ledger KMD Reward Claim and click on Check Rewards to begun the process and after the firs time I press on export public key, I get a red label error: Error
Bitcoin JSON-RPC: Request Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8232

[24-Nov-19 05:45 PM] Elmis#0347
Do you know whay I have to do?

[24-Nov-19 05:46 PM] Elmis#0347
sorry:do you know what I have to do?

[24-Nov-19 05:51 PM] Arno#3334
I got an error like that if it took me too long to make the various confirmations on the ledger hardware. Maybe a developer can help here. Alternatively, you can just use the Ledger Nano S with the magnumwallet, which also supports the rewards claiming, see few messages above.

[24-Nov-19 06:31 PM] KOSIUS#0001
@Elmis update your Ledger

[24-Nov-19 06:44 PM] CoinKing88#1540
I updated my ledger to firmware 1.6, trying to recover the accounts. BTC account is working fine but when i try to make a KMD account (after installing the KMD app via Ledger Live) it gets stuck on "open application" while i have it open on my ledger. Anyone else got the same issue or have a solution? It says "application ready" on the ledger but Ledger live is stuck on "connect and unlock ledger" after opening the KMD program (before that the first step "open ledger and unlock" was ticked off)

[24-Nov-19 06:49 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Got it working, seems to be a general ledger bug. Solotion that worked for me (found online on the Ledger forum): 
1. Close Ledger Live app
2. Open crypto app on your device (to which you want to add the account)
3. Start Ledger Live (without closing crypto app)
4. Add the account (now it should work)

[24-Nov-19 09:35 PM] Elmis#0347
Thanks to the three of you, Arno, Kosius and CoinKing88, I'll try these solutions and hopefully I'll be lucky.

i've added 2 more backup options for api end points here
https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-reward-claim/
in case hyperdex's one will go down again in future
you can select an alternative endpoint if you click on the cog icon in the header

Hello everyone I have a bit of trouble installing KOMODO Ocean QT on my laptop. After unzipping everything and launching komodo-qt-win I have an error "Error: Cannot parse configuration file:Missing komodo.conf. Only use key=value syntax."                       Can someone help me ?

Thanks @gcharang with the link from github looks like it works. Don't know why with the installer on komodoplatform.com it was working.

[25-Nov-19 06:25 PM] gcharang#6833
they are different types of installers
the one I shared is completely automated
with the one in the website, there are some extra steps required

[25-Nov-19 07:44 PM] pcfixecrypto#2852
Is is safe to download the bootstrap from this website https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php  ? I can't find it anywhere else

Hello it's me again after downloading the bootstrap on Komodo Ocean Qt. When I woke up this morning it was stuck at 92.84%. So I restarted my pc in now it's synchronising since 11 am and nothing moved

[26-Nov-19 04:55 PM] Oszy#5734
wallet version?

[26-Nov-19 04:57 PM] pcfixecrypto#2852
qt version 5.9.7

[26-Nov-19 05:01 PM] pcfixecrypto#2852
Ok I've found out that now you can clamin your KMD reward on the ledger nano S . Is it possible to claim all the rewards I have unclaimed on KOMODO Ocean Qt directly on the Ledger Nano S if I use my private key ?

[26-Nov-19 05:01 PM] gcharang#6833
@pcfixecrypto you have all your coins in a single address and know its private key?

[26-Nov-19 05:06 PM] pcfixecrypto#2852
If I remember correctly there is only one adress on my ocean qt wallet. And I have my private key

[26-Nov-19 05:08 PM] gcharang#6833
ok, install <https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/download/v0.5.9-2/Agama-Windows-v0.5.9-2.zip>
login using your private key directly: <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029966-logging-into-verus-agama-with-an-existing-private-key-or-seed>
claim your rewards
then send all the coins to your ledger address
claiming on ledger works, but it stopped working with the latest firmware update
<https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerjs/issues/422>
it should be fixed till the next time you need to claim

I'll try that, thank you

[27-Nov-19 06:04 AM] epitome#2878
Hi there, I'm sure this question has already been answered somewhere but I'm noticing I cannot deposit KMD into either Binance or Huobi. Is there an ETA on when this will be re-enabled?

[27-Nov-19 06:05 AM] epitome#2878
I found the answer. Hopefully it's all re-enabled soon.

[27-Nov-19 11:59 AM] Tom.T#6920
@epitome Hello epitome.
Once the update is completed you can deposit again. Maybe in this week.

[27-Nov-19 08:25 PM] steinsg8#0288
Can I use atomicdex for trades yet? Is it safe? What DeX is safe for use with KMD? (As an alternative to escrow)

[27-Nov-19 09:12 PM] Markus#5464
Yes atomicdex is safe to use @steinsg8
