Hi guys üòÉ I was just working on a scrapper and I see that the 2 komodo explorer give different results : https://www.kmdexplorer.io/ between https://explorer.komodo.services/

[28-Nov-18 04:49 PM] Adli#5025
You can check random adress like : https://www.kmdexplorer.io/address/RPjUmFNcWEW9Bu275kPxzRXyWDz6bfQpPD or https://explorer.komodo.services/address/RPjUmFNcWEW9Bu275kPxzRXyWDz6bfQpPD

[28-Nov-18 04:49 PM] Adli#5025
Have you already know it @metaphilibert

[28-Nov-18 04:49 PM] Adli#5025
?

[28-Nov-18 05:04 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Hmmm as far as I can see quickly from my phone it is not a "random" address, seems it is a Notary one üòÅ
With many many tx
Insight explorer is not accurate for such addresses as I think it has a limited number of indexed tx by address or something like that

[28-Nov-18 05:07 PM] metaphilibert#0926
I know it is horrible to not be able to rely on a block explorer

[28-Nov-18 05:11 PM] metaphilibert#0926
For "normal" addresses (with a "normal" numbers of tx) the 2 explorers should give you same results

[28-Nov-18 05:12 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Not sure about the number of tx needed for the explorer becoming inaccurate. (think I remember something like 10k but not sure at all)

[28-Nov-18 05:33 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Or maybe it is due to reorgs...
ü§î if you reindex or resync a block explorer, these hugely used addresses are displayed with good infos. But after a few days the difference with reality is already growing.
Maybe the explorer should wait a delay of a few blocks (5? 10?) before to get the data
Less practical cause you have to wait 10 blocks to see your freshly done tx displayed on the explorer, but should be more accurate...

[28-Nov-18 05:34 PM] metaphilibert#0926
@Decker @CHMEX as you guys are used to the insight explorer what do think about it?

[28-Nov-18 05:35 PM] metaphilibert#0926
The issue is limited to Notary addresses (or equivalent in term of usage) but still can lead to errors if you rely on the explorer's api for example

@metaphilibert 
kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RPjUmFNcWEW9Bu275kPxzRXyWDz6bfQpPD
dexstats.info/richlistlookup.php?address=RPjUmFNcWEW9Bu275kPxzRXyWDz6bfQpPD

looks to me the komodo.services explorer is out of sync.
the richlistlookup comes directly from getsnapshot

[28-Nov-18 07:01 PM] CHMEX#0686
@Adli use getsnapshot no need to scrap from the explorers

[28-Nov-18 07:03 PM] CHMEX#0686
and here you have a snapshot which updates each 15 minutes https://www.dexstats.info/snapshots/KMD_snapshot.json   in cae you don't want to run your own node

[28-Nov-18 07:05 PM] metaphilibert#0926
oh a snapshot for t-addresses, nice üòç 
wasnt aware about that, thanks @CHMEX

[28-Nov-18 07:09 PM] metaphilibert#0926
for general discussion about explorer, even if komodo.services is out of sync (doesnt seems to), there is huge difference between https://www.kmdexplorer.io/address/RPjUmFNcWEW9Bu275kPxzRXyWDz6bfQpPD and https://kmdexplorer.ru/address/RPjUmFNcWEW9Bu275kPxzRXyWDz6bfQpPD
it is a known issue since mid 2017, and i was wondering how to tune the sync of an explorer to have it reflect the reality, even with those hugely used addresses
i was runnning several iquidus before the built-in insight era, and the problem was already there
not komodo related, it should happen on every blockchain

[28-Nov-18 07:11 PM] metaphilibert#0926
*on every blockchain with crazy projects like komodo that creates many tx (like, hem,  in a real world mass adoption :trollface: )

[28-Nov-18 07:13 PM] metaphilibert#0926
sorry quite under emotion about this because it makes me remember the horrible moment when i realized an explorer was not always a reflection of the reality of a blockchain üò±

[28-Nov-18 07:16 PM] metaphilibert#0926
roooo so happy to discover this getsnapshot function, it will make me sleep better

[28-Nov-18 09:27 PM] CHMEX#0686
it is funny that some explorers are out of sync I guess having different nodes running and comparing would be a good idea making. I think reindexing takes a while.
Also something to mention is that getsnapshot does not show coins send to the burnaddress as they are untouchable

[28-Nov-18 09:29 PM] CHMEX#0686
and there is also coinsupply ( hit it in steps till you reach the current height I suggest 100k steps) which shows you the current supply or coinsupply HEIGHT for a current height same here burnaddress excluded

[29-Nov-18 12:03 AM] metaphilibert#0926
also, thanks @dukeleto for this function üôè

@Hermes there was a forum response I came across stating i would need to run the BitZec node along with BarterDex. Any insight on how to do that?

[29-Nov-18 12:24 AM] Hermes#6934
If the Bitzec node is configured to save the userdata in the default folder that is used inside %appdata%  with it's .conf set up properly it should work...you will need to have the node fully synced and run the native mode in Barterdex ...also here is a guide on how to manage your coins in Barterdex when you want to add them for the first time  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVziQQvjb-I&t=104s

Make sure you have all the dependencies downloaded.

[29-Nov-18 03:01 PM] Subie117#6527
how long until coins deposit onto BarterDex? It's been almost 12hrs and dont see a deposit. I sent 3 small transactions with no luck

[29-Nov-18 03:06 PM] Nabob#5004
@Subie117 are you on native or electrum mode ?

[29-Nov-18 03:12 PM] Nabob#5004

[29-Nov-18 03:27 PM] Nabob#5004
Check for your conf settings, it has these details
```server=1
rpcuser=xxxxx
rpcpassword=xxxx```

[29-Nov-18 03:29 PM] Subie117#6527
@Nabob is it located under the Roaming folder? If cant locate it.

[29-Nov-18 03:32 PM] Nabob#5004
Yes, `%appdata%\Roaming\Bitzec\bitzec.conf`

Yes, Luke, This is our developer documentation  link

[29-Nov-18 04:16 PM] Subie117#6527
@Nabob ah okay yeah I know where that file is. I mistakenly thought you were talking about the barterdex conf file. But going to edit my conf file to what you sent

[29-Nov-18 04:18 PM] Nabob#5004
yeah, just add those params and restart you daemon. Seems coin developer not using those params

hey all. i am using agama for my pirate wallet. it shows deposits, but not any withdrawals. i would like to keep track of them being sent to the exchange. any ideas why it doesn't show withdrawals?

[30-Nov-18 03:21 AM] Hermes#6934
You  can see the opids in the Send tab while your Pirate node is online  but the past transactions that you did in the previous sessions of the node won't be recorderd in the transactions tab. You can also see them in the CLI by using z_listoperationids @flhctroll

Got a Problem: I had deposited/payed months ago kmd for the 0Conf Feature on barterDex. On the 0Conf Finder Site, i see 2 deposits on my Adress - but if i click on BarterDex the "claim deposit" buttcon - i see nothing to claim .. Any Ideas ?

[30-Nov-18 04:23 PM] Nabob#5004
You need to set transaction id on barterdex folder manually and need to retrigger the claim.
