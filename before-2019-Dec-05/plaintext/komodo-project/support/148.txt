Okay, I just re-sent everything to a new address using the "Use available balance" button. Any approximation of how long it should take before the rewards start generating again?

has all the claims of less than 7777 KMD processed?

[16-Jun-19 09:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@amart89  pretty much all KMD refunds have been processed

[16-Jun-19 09:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
People that have not claimed or sent the dust excluded

[16-Jun-19 09:13 PM] amart89#3711
i have filled the form but have not received it

[16-Jun-19 09:15 PM] amart89#3711
sorry but what do you mean by "sent the dust excluded"

[16-Jun-19 09:21 PM] amart89#3711
If you mean this, i do not see any transaction on my compromised address

1. A special transaction will be sent to your compromised address. It will be for a fraction of a KMD.

[16-Jun-19 09:24 PM] amart89#3711
please let me know what i would have to do, should i submit the claims form again?

Hi , can someone help. I claimed my KMD last week, but I deleted my OLD agama wallet before I realized I actually need it to go through the claim process ie send the dust to new address . Do you have a link so I can reload the OLD wallet or can I use my OLD seed phrase and address  to clarify that I am the owner  ? I can send you my old address if you wish ?

[16-Jun-19 10:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
You can use Verus Agama with old seed

is their someone to talk to about the QT wallet? 247bits wants to add kmd to his cold storage card list but says the QT wallet on the website gives him an error

[17-Jun-19 02:19 AM] guttermonk#5375
When I try to create a z-address in the QT wallet, it crashes. Are z-addresses still supported?

After submitting the form, please read this document carefully to understand the refund process. https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident
Summary: We have sent a small amount of KMD to your compromised address as confirmation that we have moved those funds. Send all the funds from the compromised address to the New address you have submitted in the form to prove ownership.

1) login to Verus Agama using compromised seed: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029966-logging-into-verus-agama-with-an-existing-private-key-or-seed
2) send all the funds to the new address you specified in the form

Thanks smk762 and gcharang.....I had that sick feeling in my stomach this morning when I saw all of my coins  gone. I finished the process and now just waiting for the refund. Will let know. This whole decentralization / be your own bank stuff is stressful...lol. Keep up the good work Komodo.

@jl777c do you enjoy larping as someone who solved the oracle problem with 500 lines of code?

[17-Jun-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
i actually did implement a decentralized trustless oracle in 500 lines of code, modified in the existing daemon code. this is real, not any role playing

[17-Jun-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure why you keep harping on the 500 lines of code. was it too much, too fast?

[17-Jun-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
it is more a brute force solution using simple logic, than a complex many layered solution that should work if there are no bugs or design problems

[17-Jun-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
since it is so simple, it is easy to code

[17-Jun-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
PoW mining is actually quite a simple logic, if you dont need it to be max efficient

[17-Jun-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
and i basically piggy backed on top of what satoshi did, so plz complain to him if you dont like that i created DTO in 500 lines of code

Decentralized trustless oracles (DTO) by piggybacking on timestamp...
Trustless oracles are quite a difficult problem, at least it was until I came up with a simple method that implements them.
