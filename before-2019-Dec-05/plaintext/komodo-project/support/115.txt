How long does the transaction take normally? I sent from old (I think) but only ended up on blank screen. Totally white. No buttons nothing. Do I have to try again? Sorry - a bit noob here since I've only accumulated KMD - not sent before

[05-Jun-19 07:28 PM] PTYX#6840
@Viscous Mucus you should be able to use the paper wallet tool and the cli

[05-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Viscous Mucus#9347

Saw the notification (had no time to setup a wallet so, sent KMD to Binance before suspention, KMD sent, Binance suspention started.... now in limbo.

[05-Jun-19 07:43 PM] TI Naugs#4586
Pretty sure I'm stuck waiting and SHOULD have the deposit honoured when Binance lifts teh suspention but damn...

[05-Jun-19 07:44 PM] TonyL#3577
@TI Naugs In such situation funds should be credited after suspension finishes

[05-Jun-19 07:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
as long as you haven't exported wif from ledger and imported in agama or used ledger recovery key in agama yes it's fine

[05-Jun-19 07:52 PM] Tjohnson#5310
So I downloaded the updated Agama and the transactions show it has been cleared out but not to safe KMD address that was listed on the notice; what happens next?

[05-Jun-19 07:53 PM] mrlynch#5735

install ocean, let it sync
then follow litemode instructions to transfer all native KMD to litemode verus wallet
then backup the wallet.dat and don't use it except to dump privkeys if needed
then vreate new wallet,dat in ocean and send litemode KMD from Verus agama to ocean wallet(native)
or skip last step if you want to use litemode

[05-Jun-19 08:00 PM] TI Naugs#4586
@TonyL Thank you üôè

[05-Jun-19 08:02 PM] Tjohnson#5310
so I could create an ocean wallet and use that address for the refund, correct?

[05-Jun-19 08:02 PM] Bitcoinandy#5018
Should I stop mining ARRR to Agama wallet?

[05-Jun-19 08:03 PM] gcharang#6833
@Bitcoinandy yes

[05-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Bitcoinandy#5018
Ok what happens to ARRR that is not yet paid to Agama wallet?

[05-Jun-19 08:05 PM] gcharang#6833
@mrlynch answer the above please

[05-Jun-19 08:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
you should move it as soon as you receive it

[05-Jun-19 08:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
so you'll have to monitor it somehow

[05-Jun-19 08:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
anything that touched agama is potentially vulnerable

[05-Jun-19 08:07 PM] javita#1621
Okay I have the new Agama wallet v06.0-13 downloaded. I need help with how to send

[05-Jun-19 08:08 PM] gcharang#6833
any specific step that is confusing?

[05-Jun-19 08:10 PM] javita#1621
I am looking at the original document sent in the email from support and I have up where it says how to send funds to new address. I dont understand it. ?? The new wallet do I enter my seed or what?

[05-Jun-19 08:11 PM] Oszy#5734
You need to create a new address in any other wallet than Agama, and send your funds to the new address, never use the old again.

[05-Jun-19 08:13 PM] Bitcoinandy#5018
Ocean ok to use?

[05-Jun-19 08:13 PM] mrlynch#5735

[05-Jun-19 08:13 PM] mrlynch#5735

[05-Jun-19 08:14 PM] javita#1621

[05-Jun-19 08:27 PM] QuadraQ#5617
So download the PBaaS Cross-chain Technology Preview May 29 2019 version of agama and use it to create a new key and then send the funds from the old address to the new address?

How do I send using the old Agama? Or will it automatically pick up my previous wallet addresses?

[05-Jun-19 08:32 PM] Bitcoinandy#5018
Is Komodo Ocean the same as Pirate Ocean?

[05-Jun-19 08:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
@QuadraQ you can import your seed in chameleon pay or magnum to send

[05-Jun-19 08:32 PM] Micah68#5652
I've used both in the last 24 hours and have had no issues with either. Just a little wait time for blockchain to update.

[05-Jun-19 08:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Bitcoinandy pirate ocean is for pirate only

[05-Jun-19 08:32 PM] gcharang#6833
@QuadraQ import the old seed in Verus Agama and send to the new address created by new seed
