it says the balance is not equal or less than transaction fee...i think it worked anyway???

[10-Jun-19 03:25 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
what's the address?

[10-Jun-19 03:26 PM] nass55#4501
the new one?

[10-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@cryptopoli 1. a special transaction will be send to your compromised address. it will be for a fraction of a KMD
2. you need to send all the dust amount from the compromised address to the destination address you specified
3. IF and only IF, your address has no disputes, or contradictory claim info, and the proper destination address receives the special payment, a refund tx will be made. PLEASE do not ask when these refund tx will be made,Jl777 is working as fast as  he can, so it will happen when it happens.

what do you need to do?
if your claim amount matches the current batches size range check to see if you got the special transaction. Then make sure you only send it to the address you claimed. after that, just wait. Jl777 will announce status of each batch.

if you didnt get a special tx, that means your address is under dispute or you filed too many claims or it is the wrong size. PLEASE wait until we process all the problem free cases first. They will be done AFTER the easy cases are done.

my balance is not the same as it was tho

[10-Jun-19 03:36 PM] nocturnal#2177
i guess no one checked it on the blockchain and that was my job...

[10-Jun-19 03:36 PM] nocturnal#2177
i just put down estimate as address was not working assuming someone would check the actual amount

[10-Jun-19 03:36 PM] nocturnal#2177

[10-Jun-19 03:36 PM] nocturnal#2177

[10-Jun-19 03:39 PM] nocturnal#2177
i think you guys should probably make your own wallet for such a big coin

[10-Jun-19 03:41 PM] SHossain#0007
@cryptopoli DM me your old compromised address and new receving address

[10-Jun-19 03:42 PM] gcharang#6833
@nocturnal we did have our own wallet: agama
we will have our own again in some time
for now, you will have to use the Verus version of Agama

Thank you @SHossain and @gcharang   ‚ù§

[10-Jun-19 03:53 PM] gcharang#6833
@nocturnal no, agama was built by the KMD team
and other ecosystem projects cloned/forked it to add custom features/skins etc.,

this hack was specifically aimed at KMD version(Original) of agama

[10-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Duat_Yurtold#6833
I missed the part about sending dust from compromised address to new addrrss. I got the dust Saturday but haven't sent yet, is it too late to do so now?

[10-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Duat_Yurtold no definitely not too late üòÉ

[10-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
send full dust to new claim adress and refund will be processed with next batch!

[10-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362

So I also have some KMD in Bittrex, which has locked down KMD withdrawals/deposits - I thought i saw something yesterday how we need to get those out?

[10-Jun-19 04:58 PM] LuxPolo#3037
On a totally different note, I have 100 KMD lost in an address from 3 years ago or so  - I know I mistyped the passphrase (yes for some reason I typed it and didn't copy 'n' paste) when I originally created it, there's an extra space in there or something - anybody have a recommendation on an app that would generate alternate forms of the passphrase I do have, so I can attempt to login? TIA

[10-Jun-19 05:02 PM] SHossain#0007
there is no way to retrieve lost phrase and if you haven't backed it up

[10-Jun-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can remember 95% of the passphrase, i remember seeing some tool that tries random variations of it ,but dont remember where i saw it

[10-Jun-19 05:13 PM] bemmmie#5891
hi, unfortunately I have not received any refund yet. My mistake was, that I filled in the form twice wrongly and only the third time with the correct payout address

1.) without TXID
2.) I did not create the new address with verus agama wallet
3.) the third form is actually the correct one, here I used the Agama Windows v0.6.0-13-PBaas-cross-chain-tech-preview

I sent the small amount I received from the KMD team from my compromised address to the mailing address of the third form. I hope you can help me and apologize for my stupidity.

[10-Jun-19 05:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Best to wait for someone from the team to contact you to resolve the conflicts in the forms

[10-Jun-19 05:16 PM] SHossain#0007
@bemmmie DM me your details

[10-Jun-19 05:16 PM] SHossain#0007
along with correct refund address

[10-Jun-19 05:23 PM] KryptoKnechter#0037
hey guys how long does it take since someone is contacting me? i filled out the form yesterday and i¬¥m a bit nervous regarding the whole issue... üò¶

[10-Jun-19 05:23 PM] gcharang#6833
@KryptoKnechter 
After submitting the form, please read this document carefully to understand the refund process. https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident
Summary: We have sent a small amount of KMD to your compromised address as confirmation that we have moved those funds. Send all the funds from the compromised address to the New address you have submitted in the form to prove ownership.

1) login to Verus Agama using compromised seed
2) send all the funds to the new address you specified in the form

[10-Jun-19 05:27 PM] KryptoKnechter#0037
okay i got my mistake then i guess... just used a komodo adress from an exchange...

[10-Jun-19 05:27 PM] KryptoKnechter#0037
*for the save place... my agama is still close to be empty only the micro amount is in it.

[10-Jun-19 05:30 PM] LuxPolo#3037
I think the problem is I have 101% of the passphrase :troll_lol:

[10-Jun-19 05:32 PM] gcharang#6833
@KryptoKnechter even if the claim address is an exchange, you can follow the above steps

[10-Jun-19 05:32 PM] KryptoKnechter#0037
thanks i guess patience it is then üòÉ

[10-Jun-19 05:34 PM] gcharang#6833
@KryptoKnechter did you send the small amount from the compromised address to the claim address?

[10-Jun-19 05:35 PM] KryptoKnechter#0037
not yet but in a second... i missed that step and will do it right now

Thank you Komodo Team!, specially @jl777c , @SHossain and the community   who were patient enough to guide me during this whole learning experience (the way I see it), yes stressful at times but it got dealt really fast (within 60 hours), faster that any other hack I've seen during my 5 years in crypto. 2 out of my 3 compromised wallets got refunded and I'm confident the 3rd will go smooth as well. I had a good feeling back during the ICO and I'm still feeling it. I will post on my media as it deserves the attention. Cheers.

Is the wallet Seed / WIF the same as the old PIN from the older version of the agama wallet?

[10-Jun-19 08:15 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
you should be able to login using the same seed

[10-Jun-19 08:16 PM] MGuta#6164
Seed = Pin ? üòÉ

no, pin is another extra step that is recently added

WIF= private key in the format of mix number and letters (alphanumeric)

[10-Jun-19 08:23 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
pin is recently added so that user can enter shorter password to login instead of entering the long 16 words /24 words seed everytime
