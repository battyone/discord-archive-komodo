most people don't even know what happened till now

[06-Jun-19 07:15 PM] chilihead#7014

[06-Jun-19 07:16 PM] gcharang#6833
@VinceFfM there will be a better wallet coming in the near future
for now, Verus Agama will do the job for lite mode and 
komodoOCean is always good for Native mode

It will take some time for the team to get all of the information and start issuing payments.

[06-Jun-19 07:24 PM] SHossain#0007
I've updated the form to make it easier to fill up. If you have multiple coins or addresses swept, please submit the form multiple times. this will help us process faster. It may take few minutes extra for you but saves many hours on our end.

[06-Jun-19 07:24 PM] jossjana#7067
I have read this, but im not understand this to 100%😅

[06-Jun-19 07:24 PM] VinceFfM#7122
Can I import my agama wallet into ocean wallet?

[06-Jun-19 07:25 PM] gcharang#6833
@jossjana have you searched your address in the explorer?

[06-Jun-19 07:25 PM] gcharang#6833
@VinceFfM you can do it

[06-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Kaed#8040
@SHossain Do we need to submit again ? If we've already submitted our claim

[06-Jun-19 07:26 PM] SHossain#0007
no

[06-Jun-19 07:26 PM] VinceFfM#7122
Just override the wallet.dat?

[06-Jun-19 07:26 PM] SHossain#0007
existing submission is ok

[06-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Kaed#8040
@SHossain thx

[06-Jun-19 07:26 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have submitted already, they are being processed

[06-Jun-19 07:26 PM] gcharang#6833
@VinceFfM you were using agama native made?

[06-Jun-19 07:26 PM] VinceFfM#7122

Sorry for my question

[06-Jun-19 07:31 PM] gcharang#6833
your discord id: jossjana#7067

[06-Jun-19 07:31 PM] gcharang#6833
txid, you can get from explorer, if you don't know how, send me your address in direct message

[06-Jun-19 07:32 PM] jossjana#7067
And i need a new kmd wallet??

[06-Jun-19 07:33 PM] SHossain#0007
you can also use your valid email address, but discord id is better for faster communication if we find any issue with your cliam. i.e: missing or wrong info

[06-Jun-19 07:33 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, create it by following the instructions here: https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/429676282196787200/586115265545371648

and when I try to export pk I get: Wrong passphrase or WIF key format

[06-Jun-19 07:43 PM] VinceFfM#7122
In the tutorial it says I get asked for Seed or WIF, but Versu Agama asks for passphrase or WIF

[06-Jun-19 07:43 PM] VinceFfM#7122
Seed doesnt work here

[06-Jun-19 07:44 PM] SHossain#0007
and, guys please stop putting my discord id with your claims, if there is anything wrong with that claim, who will we contact?

there is no way to find your address and balance from txid

[06-Jun-19 08:03 PM] Allen#8663

@Allen you used this `RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF` address as where you had funds.

[06-Jun-19 08:10 PM] SHossain#0007
is this your address? is this the right address?
