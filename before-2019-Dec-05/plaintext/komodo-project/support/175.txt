Hi everyone.  I have a question.  In both my Agama and QT wallets, it gets stuck on a a % when I open it  and it starts downloading the recent blockchain.  What do I do?  I have installed the newer version and tried a different wallet.

thank you @CHMEX

@gcharang the old nxt client is what i've been using

[03-Sep-19 11:18 AM] gcharang#6833
@WienerKickstand 
try reindex. If that doesn't work, you should backup wallet.dat then clean the Komodo data directory and then use a bootstrap

Find the Komodo data directory. Depending on the OS, the location is as follows:

Linux: ~/.komodo
macOS/OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/Komodo
Windows: %APPDATA%/Komodo

delete the following files/folders

blocks
chainstate
notarisations
komodostate
komodostate.ind
peers.dat

DO NOT delete wallet.dat
back it up

download https://bootstrap.dexstats.info/KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz
extract it into the Komodo directory

Hello @Rocco.21  what are your questions ?

[05-Sep-19 03:16 PM] skitout#8659
Hi!  I am struggling to get info about the white label mobile wallet option with Antara Composer (like on what wallet is it based on, what are the process once we complete our order‚Ä¶), and CA333 is super busy, does any one know who else I could contact, or where I could find some info?

[05-Sep-19 03:20 PM] PTYX#6840
@skitout we're helping Komodo with the DEX integration and whitelabel sales. Can you please send me an email to ptyx@chainzilla.io with any details that would help us understand a bit about what you're looking for and we'll send you all of the information.

[05-Sep-19 03:21 PM] PTYX#6840
we can also jump on a call and i'll be more than happy to give you more details

[05-Sep-19 03:22 PM] skitout#8659

whenever I download the bootstrap from https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php and extract it with `tar -xvzf` I recieve the following:
```
gzip: stdin: unexpected end of file
tar: Unexpected EOF in archive
tar: Unexpected EOF in archive
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
```
Does the bootstrap need to be updated?

So file must be corrupted

[05-Sep-19 07:57 PM] zatJUM#9924
Not sure about `tar -xvzf`. I use `tar xvzf` (without the `-`)

[05-Sep-19 08:05 PM] Hooftly#1337
hmm ive downloaded a few times with the same result.  Also `tar xzvf` yeilds the same error üò¶

[05-Sep-19 08:06 PM] Hooftly#1337
its all good will have to wait for the nodes to wait out the sync

[05-Sep-19 08:06 PM] Hooftly#1337
is what it is

[05-Sep-19 08:37 PM] zatJUM#9924
Try just to `gunzip` the file first, then another time try `file KMD-bootstrap.tar`

[05-Sep-19 08:38 PM] zatJUM#9924
Perhaps it's not a real `tar` file

[05-Sep-19 11:14 PM] Aquanaught32#4568
I am having trouble with my agama wallet.. I cannot access it because it will not load just says activating best chain. I went through t the steps it recommended and deleted everything in the downloaded file except komodo.conf and wallet.dat and it again is stuck on activating best chain? what can I do from hrer

[05-Sep-19 11:15 PM] Aquanaught32#4568
gets all the wy up to 95% and no further?

[05-Sep-19 11:26 PM] Hooftly#1337
```
gunzip KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz

Hi! I want to use the ($500) white label mobile wallet option in antara Composer, but would like to have some info about this wallet before (like what it looks like, basic specs, the process once the order is completed‚Ä¶). Where could I have this info or who can I contact?

[09-Sep-19 12:02 PM] skitout#8659
I been looking for this info for more than 2 weeks now! CA333 is super busy, different people tried to help (thank you!) but so far I can‚Äôt get any info about this option (It is an Antara Composer option, not the (cool!) Chainzilla wallet)

[09-Sep-19 12:36 PM] gcharang#6833
@skitout ca333 will get in touch with you

"Error: Cannot parse configuration file: Missing komodo.conf. Only use key=value syntax."

[09-Sep-19 09:30 PM] bartwr#6773
Hi @Rut√©, not sure how the issue you have happened. 

1) What is the command that you execute?
2) On what operating system are you (Windows/Linux/Mac)?
3) Did you follow the manual at https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/installing-from-source.html ?

Use the procedure in pinned messages for Komodo Ocean qt sync problems. Works for Verus Agama too.

[10-Sep-19 07:47 PM] QuadraQ#5617
This one?
go to %appdata%
find the Komodo folder
Enter it

delete the following files/folders

blocks
chainstate
notarisations
komodostate
komodostate.ind
peers.dat

DO NOT delete wallet.dat
back it up

download https://bootstrap.dexstats.info/KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz
Extract the bootstrap file to the Komodo folder in %appdata%

[10-Sep-19 08:40 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the second one i think

[10-Sep-19 08:41 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
this one check what block you are in. use getinfo
once you found the block number, e.g: for block 1444008 use getblockhash 1444008
once you have the hash for the block you are stuck at, use invalidateblock <BLOCKHASH> without <> like the command below
once that is done, use reconsiderblock 035ee329fe10944f1b0bf659a8b8d2424322b98532deba0fe225f26eb350fdb2

Hi, on your official website instructions, inside komodo.conf on github, inside komodo-cli you have wrong P2P and RPC ports, everywhere is wrong according to what I can see after start komodod
