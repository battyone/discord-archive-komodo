stay safe

[09-Jul-19 05:00 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have Ledger hardware wallet, use that. you can claim KMD rewards using Ledger

[09-Jul-19 05:31 PM] TimTim#2040
Please bare with me, I'm ultra ULTRA PARANOID.
In fact, before this 'hack' I had an infected version of agama sat on my crypto pc waiting for me to enter my seed so I could crack on and stop losing out on all the 5% interest... 
I had double checked the checksums and installed it, but my utter paranoia stopped me from entering my seed. Then this 'hack' comes to light and my paranoia leaves orbit for another dimension.

So anyway, I have read the reports a couple of times and get the gist of what happened.

The crux of all this (taken from the official komodo site) is thus :-

"......it was a security vulnerability in an external module that the code base of Agama wallet depended upon...."

So can I safely say there is no need at all to rebuild my machine.
Simply delete agama and use oceanQT???

[09-Jul-19 05:48 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, you can use QT wallet

[09-Jul-19 05:48 PM] SHossain#0007
and, also the Verus Enhanced Agama wallet

[09-Jul-19 05:50 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
And if really paranoid about it: check the source code and build Agama or QT wallet yourself from source.

[09-Jul-19 05:52 PM] Alright#0419
probably best to rebuild the machine if you are paranoid

[09-Jul-19 05:53 PM] actionslacks#4072
@TimTim  I once sold a macbook because i clicked on a phishing link.

[09-Jul-19 05:53 PM] Alright#0419
and stop using a desktop computer for holding funds, paper or hardware wallets is the way to go

[09-Jul-19 07:14 PM] stricrypto#3482
That is my new wallet address

[09-Jul-19 07:20 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to click send tab, enter address, enter amount and confirm

Thanks to the feedback from @Hollowman9000 & the troubleshooting of @jl777c :
Michealtoutjr:
```
Hi everyone, just some advice for anyone using our Agama with KMD:

Don't send transactions from a specified address if you have an interest balance you would like to claim. As some of you may know, the Komodo daemon only automatically collects your interest if you send using the API call sendtoaddress, however, with this call, you are unable to select a specific adress to send from, and instead, must let the daemon choose. 

For this reason, the ability to choose a specific address to send from in Agama is a feature that uses the API call z_sendmany. Upon receiving this call, the Komodo daemon will donate your interest rewards to a miner.

In the next release of Agama, a warning will be shown with this information if you are sending Komodo with a positive interest balance, but until then, make sure to collect your interest rewards beforehand using the "Claim Rewards" button on the transactions screen.
```

It also includes a number of UI Improvements and bug fixes, mainly:
-A warning is now shown if going to send KMD with a positive interest balance, and the user must either confirm they are willing to donate their interest rewards, or collect their interest before sending
-Issues with gracefully ending komodod are now resolved
-Private address creation is disabled for KMD
-Minor wording issues on PBaaS test screens are now fixed
-Electrum proxy servers now use https
