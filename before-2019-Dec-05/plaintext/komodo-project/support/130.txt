[07-Jun-19 06:49 PM] 1CryptoTrader#3543

[07-Jun-19 06:52 PM] Petrus#8039
@gcharang how do you guys confirm the correct people get the correct tx's, will you ask for the seed of the old wallet?

[07-Jun-19 06:53 PM] gcharang#6833

@gcharang is there a kmd guide to claiming the user reward on Ocean qt? struggling to find one on the support site

[07-Jun-19 06:55 PM] gcharang#6833
the hacker doesn't know the claim address you have submitted in the form

[07-Jun-19 06:57 PM] Camilo Lopez#8651

[07-Jun-19 06:57 PM] crachel723#7547

[07-Jun-19 07:04 PM] jossjana#7067
@gcharang
I have now send the small amount to the new adress, now i must to do anything or is that all

[07-Jun-19 07:05 PM] spudboy999#5256
@gcharang   When I open Agama wallet v0.3.6b to send the confirmation amount for my refund to my new address, the transaction screen always goes blank before loading any transactions.  I was able to send the small amount I had remaining in my wallet to my new address from the send screen which doesn't blank out.  The amount I sent was  1.21727846 so it was larger than the small amount I was supposed to receive.  Will that send be ok for confirming my claim for the swept up funds?

[07-Jun-19 07:05 PM] gcharang#6833
thats it for now
this is the proof that you control both the old seed and the address submitted in the form
now just wait

[07-Jun-19 07:06 PM] gcharang#6833
@spudboy999 uninstall that agama
please don't use it anymore

[07-Jun-19 07:06 PM] gcharang#6833
use the verus agama nad input old seed

[07-Jun-19 07:06 PM] spudboy999#5256
@gcharang   OK will do

[07-Jun-19 07:07 PM] dxer666#8963
i received small amount in old seed and sent it to new wallet. what is next?

[07-Jun-19 07:07 PM] jossjana#7067
thanks kmd team you since the best. And
sorry for the annoyance

[07-Jun-19 07:08 PM] gcharang#6833
@dxer666 thats it, wait now

[07-Jun-19 07:14 PM] Camilo Lopez#8651
The KomodoOceanQT is safe to use?

[07-Jun-19 07:16 PM] gcharang#6833
yes

[07-Jun-19 07:16 PM] gcharang#6833
it is native mode, downloads blockchain

[07-Jun-19 07:16 PM] Camilo Lopez#8651
Ok thanks

[07-Jun-19 07:17 PM] spudboy999#5256
@gcharang   did I compromise my new wallet key by sending from v0.3.6b to the Ocean wallet?

[07-Jun-19 07:18 PM] gcharang#6833
did you enter any seed other than the already compromised seed in the 0.3.6b version?

[07-Jun-19 07:18 PM] spudboy999#5256
@gcharang   nope just the new wallet receive address

[07-Jun-19 07:19 PM] gcharang#6833
then no problem, just don't use that wallet anymore

[07-Jun-19 07:21 PM] spudboy999#5256
@gcharang   I already unistalled it and opened Verus with my old compromised key.  However the small confirmation amount you sent me was included in the amount I sent  from the v0.3.6b wallet to my new key in the ocean wallet.  Did I mess up my confirmation for funds by doing that?

[07-Jun-19 07:22 PM] gcharang#6833
no, thats how you have to do it

[07-Jun-19 07:22 PM] grizzlehkitteh#8706
Hi, I sent the verification transaction from my old wallet, to my new wallet as instructed. When I did the transaction, it gave a notice that the amount (0.0001) was too small, but I do have a transaction number. Is that what‚Äôs supposed to happen?

[07-Jun-19 07:22 PM] spudboy999#5256
@gcharang   so I should be good to go then?

[07-Jun-19 07:23 PM] gcharang#6833
@grizzlehkitteh if the transaction went through thats fine
search the transaction id in kmdexplorer.io

Hi everyone, do we need to do something else than sent kmd from the old address to the new one to  claim my old kmd's

[07-Jun-19 07:41 PM] ferby22#6687
When we get coins back?:)

[07-Jun-19 07:42 PM] figgy132#7531
What happens with DEX assets (and any others) that were swept from compromised accounts by the SAFU address? I did fill in form yesterday, is that all that's required? I did not use an exchange address for refund, I used an address created by Verus Agama.

[07-Jun-19 07:56 PM] Jimm B.#9993
@Fever√¢n No, that's all you had to do.

[07-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Fever√¢n#9166

[07-Jun-19 08:11 PM] C Adi#8432
I'm a bit confused. Does every sweet address automatically get dust to send to the new address? Or does that happen after you submit a claim?

[07-Jun-19 08:11 PM] C Adi#8432
Swept*

[07-Jun-19 08:15 PM] bergodor#8941
Hello. I have agama app (v0.3.4) and I haven't opened it yet since the end of May. Is it safe to open it now or is there something else I can do to if my funds are stolen or taken by the komodo team?

[07-Jun-19 08:15 PM] bergodor#8941
*to see

[07-Jun-19 08:17 PM] Fever√¢n#9166
@C Adi  it happens after you submit a claim.. fill the form, you can find the link here https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident

[07-Jun-19 08:18 PM] C Adi#8432
Shit

[07-Jun-19 08:18 PM] C Adi#8432
Then someone has already submitted a claim for my address

[07-Jun-19 08:19 PM] Fever√¢n#9166
contact the team, they will doublecheck your informations and they will make sure that the correct person gets it

[07-Jun-19 08:19 PM] C Adi#8432
Will do

[07-Jun-19 08:20 PM] gcharang#6833
@C Adi all the swept addresses got the dust

[07-Jun-19 08:21 PM] gcharang#6833

@gcharang Thank you

[07-Jun-19 08:33 PM] gcharang#6833
@csu yes, in the same wallet, open KMD using the "activate coin" in top navbar's right side
you will have the KMD wallet available
did you send the `0.0001 KMD` from old address to new?

[07-Jun-19 08:34 PM] csu#8410
No, I didn't know I was suppose to? My balance was 0 ....

[07-Jun-19 08:38 PM] bergodor#8941
@gcharang I checked my address on kmdexplorer and it looks like my funds are still in there

[07-Jun-19 08:39 PM] bergodor#8941
shall I follow the instructions to create a new wallet (verus agama) and transfer them from the old one?

[07-Jun-19 08:39 PM] gcharang#6833
@bergodor yes

[07-Jun-19 08:39 PM] csu#8410
@gcharang  is this ok? seems to be less than  .0001 needed:  http://prntscr.com/nz0zup

[07-Jun-19 08:40 PM] csu#8410
Ok, great!

[07-Jun-19 08:41 PM] csu#8410
So I need to keep an eye on this new address to see if/when it comes through?

[07-Jun-19 08:42 PM] C Adi#8432
Should you send all the special tx amount out? That will leave some in in case someone else tries to claim your KMD. Or would only a bad actor do this to make sure the real owner cannot claim? I don't know if I send 0.0001 or all of it!

[07-Jun-19 08:43 PM] gcharang#6833
just send 0.0001 @C Adi 
the hacker doesn't know the address you submitted in the form

[07-Jun-19 08:43 PM] C Adi#8432
Gotcha
