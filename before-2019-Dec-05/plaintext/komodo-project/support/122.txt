I had to use an old agama wallet to move my btc to a new verus address. Is it safe?

[06-Jun-19 10:25 AM] jspook16#3059
Oh thank heavens. Is there a way to move ACs that are native, other than running in native mode?

[06-Jun-19 10:25 AM] Malti#3948
once it's moved to an address of which the private key was never entered in old agama

[06-Jun-19 10:25 AM] Malti#3948

Hi all

Potentially silly q but is holding the komodo on a leger secure ?

[06-Jun-19 10:39 AM] gcharang#6833
yes  ledger is safe
be sure you haven't entered the ledger seed in the compromised agama versions

[06-Jun-19 10:40 AM] MaroofC#0998
Sure. Thank you.

[06-Jun-19 10:41 AM] MaroofC#0998

So the hacker was sending seed/wif variables to a remote server and the staff was able to get them from there?

[06-Jun-19 11:28 AM] gcharang#6833
@bishop yes

[06-Jun-19 11:28 AM] bishop#9773

Kinda surprised that there wasn't more damage considering scripting transactions would have been quite easy to do, especially for someone capable of executing this attack

[06-Jun-19 11:32 AM] bishop#9773
then again, there was open access to the remote server so who knows

Can i get confirmation whether im safe?

Used pos64staker and made 64 addresses. Imported these into agama windows. Then using same server, generated another 64 addresses, sent funds into this.
My windows agama addresses are on my server (0 balance), and my server has other addresses with balance

[06-Jun-19 12:11 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
my windows does not have those. im 99% sure im safe

[06-Jun-19 12:11 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
but just wanted to double check

[06-Jun-19 12:11 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
didnt copy paste wallet.dat or anyhting, just imported those empty addresses in

[06-Jun-19 12:13 PM] gcharang#6833
@Crabby Paddy you are safe
if the server is secure

[06-Jun-19 12:14 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
thanks, was just worried because i imported 64 of the addresses from the server, just in case they had a way to get into the other ones or something haha üòõ

Have they been swept up by the team ?

I used agama desktop wallet 3.6b in native mode and encrypted my wif keys.
Im currently travelling I have however my wif keys written down with me.
Question.
1. Are those wif keys I created in native mode compromissed?
2. If yes what would be the best course of action be?
a. Use agama lite mode  and transfer the funds to an exchange or another wallet?
b. Download native mode and do the same?

@Deleted User  if you have your WIF keys can you import them into  KomodoOceanQT wallet and then transfer your coins? Im currently on my laptop travelling.   Just need to find fastest easiest way to send the coins to verus wallet.

We are all shocked and exhausted, calm down before you say anything in public, I am sure the guys at DP are not holding grudges against you. 
What matters, that We as a community are willing to work together and overcome such issues and losses, and this worth more than anything for future success.

@cabera if you have thw wifs, easiest way to move them is using Verus Agama: https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview
ocean is naticve mode and if you are travelling syncing the chain may be an issue

@cygan get the ETH privkey from there and use any trusted ETH wallet for now
the option would be something like "import privkey"
once you are able to move them, transfer them to a new wallet/seed created in the ETH wallet you selected

of course, you can prove ownership of old address by signing a message with the old seed
we will make tools available to do this

To generate a new KMD address, I used the komodo-cli command prompt in windows under Agama Directory.   Is this a safe way..?  It's in ur support page, so i guess so... just to confirm as you didn't list this way as one of ur recommended way... u only said verus and oceanqt.

[06-Jun-19 03:12 PM] gcharang#6833
@jass thats safe. Just don't open the unsafe agama after you have done this
there are no reports of wallet.dat keys leaking from Agama
but at this point better be safe
