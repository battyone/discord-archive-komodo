Can someone point me in the right direction please? I'm using linux portable agama 0.2.43 version from the website. How do I use command prompt with this version? Specifically for KMDice. Thanks

[25-Oct-18 09:39 PM] Hermes#6934
Command prompt ? You mean CLI ?

[25-Oct-18 09:40 PM] joe2x4#5987
correct

[25-Oct-18 09:43 PM] Hermes#6934
You can use the CLI inside Agama if you launch KMDICE in this particular case using native ....and then select the Settings tab and press the option that says CLI ...you select the coin you want to interact with and input the command that you need.

Excellent, thank you. I guess I'll need to go dig for the commands to use KMDice

Cannot claim KMD reward in native mode. After clicking claim in new opened dialog nothing happens.

[26-Oct-18 06:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Martis have you updated to the last version?

[26-Oct-18 06:45 AM] Martis#7710
Yes. Windows 10, 2.43b Previous versions worked.

[26-Oct-18 06:45 AM] Martis#7710
Also strange, newest version had to sync blockchain from genesis, while older versions just updated new blecks.

[26-Oct-18 07:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And chain is fully synched?

[26-Oct-18 06:26 PM] Omar Samuels#3279
Yes

[26-Oct-18 06:26 PM] Omar Samuels#3279
Yes to mine kmd

[26-Oct-18 06:27 PM] Hermes#6934
Yeah I am also looking into the same I have seen some recent posts in #deleted-channel  about processors and #talk-mining  also

[26-Oct-18 06:27 PM] Hermes#6934
I will recommend an ASIC

[matrix] <bias:matrix.org> I ran the native client mining

[26-Oct-18 08:58 PM] Hermes#6934
You are using then the native version of the wallet not the lite version

[26-Oct-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <bias:matrix.org> 3.3 is stuck syncing though

[26-Oct-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <bias:matrix.org> yes

[26-Oct-18 09:02 PM] Hermes#6934
Please use the latest version of the wallet  on our website https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/ also if the wallet throws you an error while syncing try a  reindex of the blocks as showed in this guide https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024520-reindex-komodo-blockchain-with-agama/en  if you still face the same issue you will need to make a resync from scratch as showed in this guide  https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024513-agama-windows-guide-how-to-resync-from-scratch/en

how do you backup the Agama wallet... get the import key or whatever I need

[27-Oct-18 04:28 PM] SHossain#0007
@tahoeminer you can export the private key (WIF key) and save it somewhere safe. for each native coins wallet you use, you can also backup the `wallet.dat` file from data dir

komodo - agama wallet download onto my mac - version osx-0.2.43d ... untar'd the zipped up tarball, and my norton flagged komodod as a trojan.   I realize that a lot of crypto miners and so on are treated as trojans, but I wonder if I got a bad binary (maybe not official release)?   Is this normal? or should I be concerned

[27-Oct-18 07:20 PM] higgy#2168
got it from komodoplatform .com

[27-Oct-18 07:51 PM] Hermes#6934
Nothing to worry about ...this is a false positive that most AVs are reporting onto crypto related apps ...we have already contacted some of the AV companies to notify them about this matter.

[27-Oct-18 11:36 PM] dael4#1861
agama wallet, had friend trying to get me to do lite mode, so couldn't find passphrase so I had to rescan whole Blkchain in last ver. 2.42c to get WIF and stopped at 99.04%, I restarted and now verifying blocks again. Will new version help with this?

[27-Oct-18 11:50 PM] Hermes#6934
Please send us a ticket at support@komodoplatform.com , If you have the private key from that specific address in the wallet.dat file of that native wallet it's possible to solve the issue. But remember that if you used the lite mode version of the wallet only and you don't possess this private key inside your wallet.dat file  or it wasn't imported into it...that's a different scenario.

[27-Oct-18 11:52 PM] Hermes#6934
By running native mode you should be able to load fully without this issue, but still is mandatory to download the latest version  https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/

hello, I am using 0.2.43d-beta
Added the coin and downloaded blockchain in Native mode.
Imported WIF code and it imports the correct address, but only with 0 balance where there should be some coins.
Any idea what I can do?
Thanks

[28-Oct-18 10:54 AM] SHossain#0007
click the refresh button or stop the wallet by clicking top-left  corner of coin logo and start again in native mode.

[28-Oct-18 10:55 AM] Nabob#5004
@Zurg  after importing Priv key,  rescan your wallet

Hello ,
I created my wallet yesterday, after a few hours and several entries in my wallet, all entering through the password and not typing my seed, I sent some komodos to the address that appeared in my portfolio, being verified letter by letter. I received the funds and requested the rewards, everything going well.
During the night I got into my wallet again and found that I had no more funds in it, and the address on it at that time was different from the address that had sent the funds.
Does anyone know if there is any way to recover them? This error was not mine, but the wallet, which changed the address spontaneously.

[28-Oct-18 12:03 PM] SHossain#0007
https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024514-common-wallet-issues

[28-Oct-18 12:03 PM] SHossain#0007
The wallet never changes any address, unless there is a change in the seed passphrase

[28-Oct-18 12:03 PM] SHossain#0007
Same seed will always display same address.

[28-Oct-18 12:05 PM] Aislan#2105
But they change
The support answered this;

Hi Aislan Monteiro,

If you just created the wallet today as your first stated please make sure that the actual address that was being generated at the beginning with your seed is the same. There is a possibility that you created a pin file based on a mismatch of your previous correct seed and then you pinned this new address without verifying that it was the address that was used to send the funds in your exchange.

If you wrote down your 24 word seed please make sure to type it word by word correctly and please follow the guide to see if you are able to test the scenario that is explained in this cases.

[28-Oct-18 12:05 PM] Aislan#2105
So i think this can help

[28-Oct-18 12:08 PM] coingirl87#6489
Thx @Nabob  it works
