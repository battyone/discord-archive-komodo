sry 15

[28-Jul-18 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it wot combine utxo's

[28-Jul-18 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can only trade the size of the alrgest one... and if there was a "swap never started" it till lock the UTXO until you restart or some X time elapses

[28-Jul-18 01:39 PM] c2k#4915
ok i will restart and try again

[28-Jul-18 01:41 PM] c2k#4915
still get same message

[28-Jul-18 01:41 PM] c2k#4915
you said i can only trade the size of the largest utxo?

[28-Jul-18 01:46 PM] c2k#4915
weird thing is im getting these messages when i use manual offer. but if i use offer bot i dont get that popup. frustrating

[28-Jul-18 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
offerbot will itterate UTXO's and use the largest one.

[28-Jul-18 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
say your balance is 200 but the largest UTXO is 80 KMD, you cannot use 90 KMD as an offer

[28-Jul-18 01:52 PM] c2k#4915
my largest utxo is 30 and im trying to sell 100

[28-Jul-18 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can't do that...

[28-Jul-18 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unless you combine them together first

[28-Jul-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
provided the bob has a UTXO big enough to facilitate that trade.

[28-Jul-18 01:53 PM] c2k#4915
ok. all way over my head really

[28-Jul-18 01:53 PM] c2k#4915
been using bdex for months

[28-Jul-18 01:54 PM] c2k#4915
but never easy for me

[28-Jul-18 01:54 PM] c2k#4915
is hyperdex the same when it comes to managing utxo's?

[28-Jul-18 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its never easy lol... HyperDEX is heaps easier

[28-Jul-18 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it will just use the largest UTXO, so you try sell 100 and have 30 UTXO it will just sell 30.

[28-Jul-18 01:55 PM] c2k#4915
gotcha

[28-Jul-18 01:55 PM] c2k#4915
but on hdex i dont have to worry about utxo?

[28-Jul-18 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not exactly.... It still uses them the same way behind the scenes.

[28-Jul-18 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but it wont throw errors at you talking about it

[28-Jul-18 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as you have at least 2 of them it usually works

[28-Jul-18 01:56 PM] c2k#4915
and i can use my bdex keys so my balance shows in there?

[28-Jul-18 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes they use the same keys

[28-Jul-18 01:57 PM] c2k#4915
ok great

[28-Jul-18 01:57 PM] c2k#4915
latest version of hdex v0.1.0?

[28-Jul-18 01:57 PM] c2k#4915

appreciate your help

[28-Jul-18 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries

[28-Jul-18 02:11 PM] Hermes#6934
Yeah I will recommend Hyperdex also easier for users

[28-Jul-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <geforce209ad:matrix.org> Apparently anti-virus reports barterdex and sometimes agama as malware

[28-Jul-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <geforce209ad:matrix.org> had a few tickets regarding this

[28-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Hermes#6934
One of the reasons for this is because there are some binaries from OSX and Linux on the Windows version of the app. This will be removed in future versions.

[28-Jul-18 06:07 PM] tolken#2655
@cipi the issue turned out to be a couple things at least. The Client_OSX as it comes from github seems incorrect, adding a redundant path. Secondly before bdex would see komodod where Agama installed it, BarterDex this doesn‚Äôt seem to work. To get it to work, I find komodod installed by Agama and explicit path to the config and it worked running outside Agama. Yes I had marketmaker running.

[28-Jul-18 10:17 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I'm playing with komodo and assetchains a bit, have a couple of servers set up & get to create a test chain, but once there komodo-cli give error "couldn't connect to server (code -1)

[28-Jul-18 10:17 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
ideas?

[28-Jul-18 10:24 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
ok right self response, needed to specify ac_name

[28-Jul-18 10:24 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
btw PTYX docs in atlassian are more accurate than readthedocs documentation

[28-Jul-18 10:31 PM] Hermes#6934
Noted we will review this exactly which part is that you see that needs to be clarified ?

[28-Jul-18 10:37 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
the part wich didnt mentions ac_name needs to be especified after creation of assetchain, when doing the getinfo or getwalletinfo with komodo-cli

[28-Jul-18 10:59 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
ups sorry my fault yes, its there, just checked hehe

[29-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Biomech#5602
Mornin' y'all. Not sure this is the right channel, but here goes.

[29-Jul-18 03:12 PM] Biomech#5602
Over at EQL, we had a problem due to me being less dilligent than I should have been on updates, resulted in a fork. That part's fixed üòÑ @siu - Chainmakers and his crew built our servers for us, and I failed to ask some of the important questions.

[29-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Biomech#5602
How do I restart the electrumx server? The wallet is now up to date and properly synched, but I can's seem to get electrumx to start.

[29-Jul-18 03:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yo need to delete everything inside electrumdb_EQL resync the chain and then start electrum service again

[29-Jul-18 03:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, good that you fixed it

[29-Jul-18 10:41 PM] c2k#4915
on the hyperdex github download page but not sure which one to download...would it be .exe?
im running windows 7

@Jonathan and if i want to use my BDEX keys im guessing i select "restore portfolio"?

[29-Jul-18 10:48 PM] Jonathan#3687
Yep

[30-Jul-18 01:47 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Cryptopia sent me an email that they are no longer supporting "1" addresses for BTX and will be converting all deposit addresses to the "2" format.

[30-Jul-18 02:30 AM] agnewpickens#7393
And have tried sending DNR to BarterDEX from both mynode.rocks and now my wallet and not arriving, will open a support ticket.

[30-Jul-18 04:32 AM] AndronicusBass#7784

Hi - i am having issue in Agama (on Mac) running native, syncing Zilla chain - stuck at block 19758. Have latest version - have done rescan / reindex from disk and reinstalled agama but still the same - any suggestions?

[30-Jul-18 11:31 AM] ca333#0118
@miles can you plz check out your debug.log and post the last ~100 lines of it - its located in `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/ZILLA`

looks like my komodo coins got stolen from my wallet :(

[30-Jul-18 12:36 PM] Shinsoo#0021
whats the most secure way of storing komodo coins? Can someone please share?

[30-Jul-18 12:42 PM] yorklab#7270
If using Lite mode, I keep my seed/passphrase on a separate USB that also needs a password for access. Many like to write the passphrase on a separate piece of paper.

[30-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Hermes#6934
@Shinsoo I  would suggest to please send us a ticket at support@komodoplatform.com . Here is not so easy to review what could be the situation that you faced. In the ticket please send us the details of your wallet version and mode. We would make sure to give you back a possible solution if there is.

[30-Jul-18 12:52 PM] yorklab#7270
@Shinsoo Just an FYI. From experience I can tell you that if in Lite mode, most people who think their coins are gone, eventually find that they simply typed in the wrong passphrase/seed, so Agama will display a different address. A space before or after the phrase will give you a different address.

[30-Jul-18 12:58 PM] AndronicusBass#7784
I'm getting the same issue as miles with a different coin, same error in log

[30-Jul-18 01:00 PM] AndronicusBass#7784
agama 0.2.41

[30-Jul-18 01:11 PM] Hermes#6934
Which coin is it?

[30-Jul-18 01:16 PM] AndronicusBass#7784
Equaliser

[30-Jul-18 01:20 PM] Hermes#6934
Have you tried a resync from scratch ? Try this guide when you enter Komodo folder select the EQL and do the same procedure https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/162562089/Agama+Windows+Guide+How+to+Resync+from+scratch

[30-Jul-18 01:21 PM] Hermes#6934
If that doesn‚Äôt help send us a ticket at support@komodoplatform.com with the debug log if possible.

[30-Jul-18 01:26 PM] AndronicusBass#7784
I have unfortunately. It just wont move beyond 96% and tried daemon param selection reindex from disk, rescan and also gen

[30-Jul-18 01:26 PM] AndronicusBass#7784
Deleted everything in the folder except wallet.dat

[30-Jul-18 01:27 PM] AndronicusBass#7784
then executed agama with the command argument zapwallettxes=2

[30-Jul-18 01:58 PM] Shinsoo#0021
@yorklab no mine is gone to a private addresa after 20 days of back and forth email with support

[30-Jul-18 01:59 PM] Shinsoo#0021
@yorklab which usb do u use  to keep ur pw? Also which walet u use?

[30-Jul-18 02:01 PM] yorklab#7270
I have both Lite and Native Agama wallet. You can use any USB drive then, if in Windows, you can use Bitlocker (comes with Windows) you can password protect the USB drive.

[30-Jul-18 02:03 PM] yorklab#7270
I like to use Lite mostly because of the ability to protect my passphrase in a separate secure location.

[30-Jul-18 02:03 PM] Shinsoo#0021
okay thanks york

[30-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Hermes#6934
If what you are saying is correct , then I will suggest for you to see any vector that could have a vulnerability  and create a wallet from another PC  and another network as well because there is no current form that Agama on lite mode would send a transaction if the user is the only one controlling  their passphrase. If you are using native mode a rescan should help in viewing all of the change addresses inside the wallet. If not my personal suggestion would be to create a wallet in a new machine and make sure that your environment hasn't being compromised. @Shinsoo

[30-Jul-18 02:09 PM] AndronicusBass#7784
Siu sent me a DM me and I gave him more info. Will try what you suggested. cheers

[30-Jul-18 02:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

Can anyone else confirm?

[30-Jul-18 02:31 PM] miles#6381
@Hermes  @ca333  - just fyi - i have just followed the resync from scratch for Zilla to see if it solves the stuck block sync issue i was having - gets stuck at exactly the same block again (19758)

[30-Jul-18 02:55 PM] Hermes#6934
ok which version of the wallet you are using Windows , Mac?

[30-Jul-18 03:01 PM] ca333#0118
@miles @Hermes can you check if the daemon got on a fork?

[30-Jul-18 03:02 PM] miles#6381
mac / 0.2.41

[30-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Hermes#6934
I am doing a test on Mac right now

[30-Jul-18 03:02 PM] miles#6381
@ca333 how do i check that?

[30-Jul-18 03:03 PM] Hermes#6934
I am stuck on the same block

[30-Jul-18 03:31 PM] miles#6381
@ca333 - will be offline for a bit soon - but if you let know what config / logs you need to confirm what the daemon is running against i can post back later - looks like @Hermes has exact same issue though

[30-Jul-18 03:31 PM] miles#6381

[30-Jul-18 05:17 PM] nasbats#7785
Hey, been absent for a while, so forgive me if this has already been covered, but I just upated bdex from 1.0.7 to 1.1.0 and on login, it gives me "No electrum server for xxx. Please use native". Is there a quick fix for this?

[30-Jul-18 05:17 PM] nasbats#7785
this is for every coin
