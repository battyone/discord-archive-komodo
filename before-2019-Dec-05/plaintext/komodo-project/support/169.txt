@PacificK2A you will get 1 year worth
then if you claim monthly, then you will get them too

[31-Jul-19 02:41 PM] PacificK2A#4591
OK so to be clear. If I sweep the paper wallet, the staking rewards will be added to the amount I sweep and both will arrive in the new address.

[31-Jul-19 02:42 PM] gcharang#6833
@PacificK2A sweep to the same address. Then rewards and actual coins will stay in that address
if you send to another address, do another transaction that sends the rewards from old address to new one

[31-Jul-19 02:43 PM] PacificK2A#4591
Sweep to same address ? That is safe ? To reuse an address I mean.

[31-Jul-19 02:44 PM] gcharang#6833
why not, use offline signing in Agama

[31-Jul-19 02:44 PM] gcharang#6833

got it

[31-Jul-19 02:45 PM] PacificK2A#4591
Yes yes, I know about offline transactions. I do them with Bitcoin. No problem. But to sweep to the same address. I don't think it is safe.

[31-Jul-19 02:45 PM] PacificK2A#4591
When an address is swept, the pay to hash is revealed.

[31-Jul-19 02:48 PM] gcharang#6833
```

Why address reuse is discouraged:

Reduced security: An unused address is protected by ECDSA AND several SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 operations, but only ECDSA after being used because the public key must be revealed during spending. This has been shown to open up several possible attacks in the past.[1]

Reduced privacy: All participants who you give the address to know it is yours obviously. They can use this information to analyze incoming and outgoing transactions to identify other addresses you own and who you are interacting with, not to mention how much bitcoin you have. This can be serious for businesses in competition or in situations where a payment might might put someone into harms way (politically unpopular donations or as a means for extortion, etc).
```

[31-Jul-19 02:50 PM] PacificK2A#4591
Yes, exactly this is what I said, the pay to hash is revealed "An unused address is protected by ECDSA AND several SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 operations, but only ECDSA after being used because the public key must be revealed during spending. This has been shown to open up several possible attacks in the past."

[31-Jul-19 02:50 PM] PacificK2A#4591
Emmanuel, I wont do that because I will lose my rewards....maybe...

[31-Jul-19 02:51 PM] gcharang#6833
```
if you send to another address, do another transaction that sends the rewards from old address to new one
```

[31-Jul-19 02:52 PM] PacificK2A#4591
OK, so I must live with the reduced security for only a short time after I sweep and until I send to the new address. Got it ! Thanks ! Have a nice day !

[31-Jul-19 02:54 PM] gcharang#6833
@PacificK2A the security is reduced for some implementations in the past where they didn't generate the randomness correctly
for a secure implementation, there is no issue

[31-Jul-19 02:54 PM] PacificK2A#4591
But wait a second. If I sweep to the same address, then how to I access the address from Agama ?

[31-Jul-19 02:55 PM] PacificK2A#4591
sorry typo, the how do I access the address from Agama.

[31-Jul-19 02:56 PM] PacificK2A#4591
right. I still cant send afterwards because Agama needs my private key

[31-Jul-19 02:56 PM] gcharang#6833

@Deleted User no, the app will add rewards automatically if they are available

[31-Jul-19 03:01 PM] PacificK2A#4591
Ahhh, so I need to do 2 offline transactions. For example, I offline sweep the address A to the same address A. Then afterwards I create a new address B and sweep again offline from A to B. The staking rewards will then go from A to B along with the funds in A. Correct ?

[31-Jul-19 03:02 PM] gcharang#6833
see the example sending 0.777 out of 777, the txn will still claim rewards

[31-Jul-19 03:02 PM] gcharang#6833
@PacificK2A that works

[31-Jul-19 03:02 PM] gcharang#6833
or you can do
A -> B
again A -> B

[31-Jul-19 03:04 PM] PacificK2A#4591
wait ? When I do A -> B then what happens to my staking rewards ? Do they show up in A after I have sent to B ?

[31-Jul-19 03:04 PM] gcharang#6833
its not really a risk man
the risk was if the implementation of priivkey derivation was unsecure

[31-Jul-19 03:04 PM] gcharang#6833
```
Do they show up in A after I have sent to B ?
```
yes

[31-Jul-19 03:05 PM] PacificK2A#4591
Ahhhh, OK. Then its easy. I just do two offline transactions from A -> B one after the other. Then there is no risk. 100% safe. Thank you again ! Have a nice day.

[31-Jul-19 03:06 PM] PacificK2A#4591
Emmanuel, in my experience in crypto, you must be paranoid. Never give the scammers a chance. Stay safe.

if you really need privacy, just use PIRATE

[31-Jul-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
if you really worry about Quantum Computers cracking your privkey... then and only then would you need to be doing claim and send to fresh address every month

[31-Jul-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
realistically, the first quantum computers will be going after all the giant amounts of BTC at exchanges and whale wallets

[31-Jul-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
after we start hearing of such things, then maybe it is worth going to such levels of security

[31-Jul-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
address reuse does give up a bit of privacy, but to pretend that using new addresses each time gives you any privacy at all is nonsense

[31-Jul-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if you need privacy, PIRATE is the only thing i know that achieves that.

Hi. I have the following issue with Agama wallet. It has painfully downloaded new blocks for 10-12 hours, but it reached 90-95% completion and then it suddenly jumped back to 3% and started doing it all over again. It seems I can't activate best chain.

Does Binance KMD staking automatically happen by holding it on Binance, or is there something you need to do to qualify?

Why use a closed source app when you can use a hosted one that is open source? (magnum uses our code but it seems like they have some issues)

[03-Aug-19 01:16 PM] hyperDEX#6586
If you are worried about the new address, open the receive option in ledger first to make sure you know the next address before you do the claim ad before you verify the tx

[03-Aug-19 01:23 PM] Seko#7408
I would like to inform you briefly still which observations I have made. I could claim before, but it was curious that Magnum showed me more rewards than the ledger afterwards.
A browser problem?

@Deleted User i think seko was talking about the ledger claim app function in magnum

[04-Aug-19 07:14 AM] Seko#7408
All the more incredible that everyone is talking about Magnum and not Atomiclabs. When the Agama thing happened, there was only Magnum as an answer through social media. Our tool is better and faster, but a lot of people don't even know it. That surprised me.

[04-Aug-19 07:22 AM] Seko#7408
But I have to admit that I haven't been online much in the last 3-4 weeks.

[04-Aug-19 07:22 AM] Seko#7408
But before, I only read about Magnum, good marketing and word of mouth.

[04-Aug-19 08:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Seko originally it had a 5% of the reward amount as a fee to fund more development, then i dropped that to 0.5% and finally when the agama issue happened i dropped it to 0%. Oh also the tool was not made by the team, it is a free tool provided by atomiclabs (all of my open source developments will be under that) so that could be why people were recommending Magnum. (they didnt know about it or were trying to avoid the fee?)
