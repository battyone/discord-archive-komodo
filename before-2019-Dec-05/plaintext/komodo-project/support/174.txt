@gcharang Hi buddy, no not as yet. I am not sure how to retrive the old wallet I have all the details but not sure if i kept the wallet.dat if it was seperate to the kmd. How would one need to proceed? its only a little amount but it'd be cool to have

[23-Aug-19 05:50 AM] Benj_pirate#7250
hello, I try to retrive my funds from my agama wallet where I was staking my coins since more than a year now...

[23-Aug-19 05:51 AM] Benj_pirate#7250
I follow all the steps

[23-Aug-19 05:51 AM] Benj_pirate#7250
but when I reach this step :
5) Then import the old seed (compromised), in the Verus Agama wallet and activate KMD lite mode. Then send all the funds to the new KMD address created previously

I don't understand

[23-Aug-19 05:51 AM] Benj_pirate#7250
Should I install another wallet to import my old seed on ?

[23-Aug-19 06:02 AM] Benj_pirate#7250
Is this the best way to get back access to my coins ? :

@gcharang üôÇ ?

[23-Aug-19 06:07 AM] Benj_pirate#7250
I'm a bit lost as somewhere I found I should use this :
Agama-MacOS-v0.6.0-13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview

And in your message from 13 of august you advice to download this : Agama-MacOS-v0.5.7-4

[23-Aug-19 06:12 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Verus Agama v0.5.7-4 is the latest version and should be used. v0.6.0-13 is an older version and is **not** the recommended version to use anymore.

[23-Aug-19 08:34 AM] gcharang#6833
@Benj_pirate 
as Oink said 0.5.7-4 is the latest version and should be used.
```
5) Then import the old seed (compromised), in the Verus Agama wallet and activate KMD lite mode. Then send all the funds to the new KMD address created previously
```
this means to move your coins from an address created using the old Agama wallet to an address created using the new agama wallet.

Can someone also confirm that by creating a new address (and seed) with this wallet : Agama (v0.5.7-4) 
And by using this same wallet to import my old seed AND transfert my coin from my old seed to my new seed, I'm now safe

@Benj_pirate what is the point of this ?!

@Benj_pirate Some addresses in Agama version 0.3.x were compromised. It's good practice to roate addresses periodically regardless. Verus Agama is ok.

I had an Agama wallet on my old computer.  I have been having difficulty installing an Agama wallet on my new computer.  According to the comments above, version  0.5.7-4  is the current  Agama wallet.  I  was  trying v0.6.0-13 without success and  couldn't access my funds.  Is v0.5.7-4 the official desktop wallet now?

[24-Aug-19 08:20 PM] yorklab#7270
@FredR Yes, that's correct. v0.5.7-4 is the latest wallet.

My wallet lost all the KMD from the issue back in June. I can not get any wallet to synch up, even on a new computer. I "lost" several thousand KMD in this and I tried to claim them, but since the wallet will not sync I can not see the micro deposit to verify my account. Any help from Support would be greatly appreciated.

Noob question ‚Äì I'm trying to dump my private key in Ocean Wallet console, but my wallet is encrypted and it says Error: Please enter the wallet passphrase with walletpassphrase first. (code -13) where do I enter the passphrase

[27-Aug-19 08:09 PM] Alright#0419
@shak3nbak3 `walletpassphrase "<YOUR PASSPHRASE>" <seconds to decrypt wallet>`

[27-Aug-19 08:10 PM] Alright#0419
so `walletpassphrase "myencryptionpassphrase" 60` will unlock the wallet for 1 minute, you can then do any rpc command that requires decryption for 1 minute

[28-Aug-19 05:00 AM] gcharang#6833
the Ocean wallet is a native wallet. It downloads the blockchain and has a wallet.dat
the wallet.dat file has to be backedup after every transaction

what's the most stable wallet that stake KMD in your opinion?

[30-Aug-19 11:25 PM] phm87#7395
komodo daemon and using command line interface or komodo qt if you want a UI

[30-Aug-19 11:30 PM] phm87#7395
And about staking and monthly reward, kmd does not stake technically: the wallet does not need to be online to earn sth. If you do one tx to yourself or another address once per month, you earn thd reward. It is unique to kmd (a kind of interest for active users).
In comparison, a smartchain with staking and pow mining (such as labs) have a part of pos blocks and a part of pow blocks. In this case, wallet of the staker must be online to be able to earn sth. @Yu

@Deleted User Verus Agama does not show the buttons for it, but you can use `settings`, `CLI` to enter `setgenerate true 0` to start staking on any chain that supports it.
