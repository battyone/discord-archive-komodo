[10-Jun-19 03:30 AM] Alecandro#1179
Would mobile be okay too?

[10-Jun-19 03:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Verus agama was forked a while ago without this dependency

[10-Jun-19 03:30 AM] Alecandro#1179

[10-Jun-19 03:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont know if verus mobile has KMD and other coins

[10-Jun-19 03:31 AM] Alecandro#1179
If has KMD

[10-Jun-19 03:31 AM] Alecandro#1179

[10-Jun-19 03:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Then should be fine.

[10-Jun-19 03:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But i would not store too many coins on a mobile app regardless of how safe it is

your refund will go to the address you sent the dust to, as long as it matches the claim form

Could you confirm that for the refund above 7777  we still have   to wait ? Thanks a lot

[10-Jun-19 10:02 AM] gcharang#6833
@istante as far as I know the refund for addresses above 7777 hasn't been processed yet

[10-Jun-19 10:04 AM] istante#3749
Perfect thanks!

[10-Jun-19 10:51 AM] ponzo#9122
hello everybody, I reclaimed my fund according to guide yesterday but my destination wallet still doesn't receive my fund yet. could anybody advise me how long refund takes normally?

[10-Jun-19 10:52 AM] gcharang#6833
@ponzo have you sent the small transaction from old address to new?

[10-Jun-19 10:56 AM] ponzo#9122
yes 0.0001KMD I've sent from old to new

[10-Jun-19 10:57 AM] gcharang#6833
@ponzo is the amount less than 7777?

[10-Jun-19 10:57 AM] ponzo#9122
yes

[10-Jun-19 10:57 AM] ponzo#9122
should I reclaim once more?

[10-Jun-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
send all funds from old to new

[10-Jun-19 10:58 AM] ponzo#9122
okay i'll do it

[10-Jun-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
i have not processed yesterday yet

[10-Jun-19 10:59 AM] ponzo#9122
i'll transfer all from old to new

[10-Jun-19 10:59 AM] ponzo#9122
sould I reclaim again after that?

[10-Jun-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
the more times you submit a claim,the LONGER it takes

[10-Jun-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
only the addresses with a single claim that does the tx from old to new is processed automatic

[10-Jun-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
once there are multiple claims, then it needs to be manually processed and added to the END of the queue

[10-Jun-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
the more you change things, the LONGER it will take

[10-Jun-19 11:01 AM] ponzo#9122
okay, thanks for explanation I'll wait

[10-Jun-19 11:05 AM] ponzo#9122
my remain KMD in old is less than 0.0001 transaction fee so I can't transfer remain all from old to new

I have some HUSH people that need to submit claim forms and so I wanted to verify: Which is the correct claim form for asset chains and/or specifically HUSH ?

[10-Jun-19 01:03 PM] SHossain#0007
@dukeleto we haven't setup HUSH claim form yet. I'll get one done by today.

[10-Jun-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain thanks, I have at least one report of 11K HUSH moved by either attacker or KMD, trying to get more details

hi guys, help please.. today i heard about that agama vulnerability and wanted to send funds to another wallet
but when i log into my agama it shows
Connection error
Trying to switch to another server..
how can i send funds ??

[10-Jun-19 02:43 PM] Pumtchak#0362
@Martins you will have to use another wallet. You can install VerusAgama and use your old seed to access your old wallet

Verus is a multicoin wallet, it has KMD

[10-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Pumtchak#0362
if you were using lite mode, just use your old seed

[10-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Martins#3853
