[17-Jun-19 02:31 PM] gcharang#6833
@Emil  Explorer is showing the correct value
don't use the old version of Agama
Verus version of Agama is safe to use, but doesn't have RFOX yet (they might add it in the future)
Currently, you need to use Native mode(qt-wallet) to move RFOX: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029971-launching-pirate-rfox-and-other-assetchains-in-komodo-ocean-mac-
If you don't need to move them, just backup the seed and wait for a lite wallet to be available: either in Verus-Agama or a wallet by RFOX team

your funds are safe, but they were swept by the team to avoid that a hacker would steal them

@mrlynch tnx, my wallet still contained my KMD.

[17-Jun-19 09:52 PM] matspb#7829
Hello. I am still waiting for return of a small amount of KMD. When the KMD was removed from my compromised wallet, you sent it out in 2 amounts. The larger amount has been returned to me but the smaller amount not yet. The compromised wallet from which it was removed is RHafdDeTXkhchFKiMRDfUdHDF6JMWqjsW9  It's not a lot. The amount is 0.98306723KMD but I'd still like it back please. This may be partly my fault for changing the 'to wallet' address at the last moment but I did mention both amounts in my original claim form. I'd still like this smaller amount to be added to the wallet RD7PbypjtkD6TLLgerbTtegWsA8r7Y85Lt where the larger amount (303KMD) has already been sent. I will soon be away from some of my  crypto access for a month so it would be comforting to have this finalised soon please. Thank you.

[17-Jun-19 10:08 PM] matspb#7829
Yes as above my accounts showed a total of 313.98306723.... when the transfer happened.I have had the 313 back. I know it's not much but it is several weeks of staking rewards for me.

Hi, I need help with the KMD claims process. I sent the small amount to the wrong wallet address, instead of the one I submitted in the original claim form. Should I submit a new claim with the new address?

@alen first of all Magnum has one of the best interfaces for claiming Komodo rewards. If you're having issues though, contact the Magnum team so that they can walk you through the steps.

[18-Jun-19 01:14 PM] PTYX#6840
Magnum doesn't charge or "steal" your rewards.

"use Verus Agama instead. back up your wallet.dat file(s) and privkeys and delete old Agama wallet @TheFalseProfit"

[18-Jun-19 05:28 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Where are my wallet.dat file(s) and privkeys? I have seed words, address, WIF key, wallet name and PIN.

[18-Jun-19 05:32 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
If I upgrade to versus agama BEFORE the claims process do the transactions from the 5th and dust sent by kmd team still show up? Is my upgraded versus wallet OK to then use as the new address?

[18-Jun-19 05:42 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Check `%appdata%/komodo` and its subfolders for wallet.dat files. Make sure to backup them in a logical place if you have more coins (each coin has a separate wallet.dat). If no wallet.dat files are present, you most likely used only lite mode.
Your wallet.dat file contains info about the addresses that work on Verus Agama just as they did on Komodo Agama, so your balance (including dust) will show up.
Verus Agama is safe to use for your new address.

[18-Jun-19 05:43 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
I used only lite mode... does that alter anything?

[18-Jun-19 05:45 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
No, just don‚Äôt bother with looking for wallet.dat. Most important is that you have the data you mentioned (Privkey is also known as WIF)

[18-Jun-19 06:18 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Uninstalled old agama. Downloaded Agama Windows v0.5.7-1.zip. Extracted and moved folder to D:/ where I renamed it Agama. Then ran Agama.exe. I then get a javascript error even though Java is fully updated.

Created a second instance on the desktop and it opened. Win10. I'm going to use it from the desktop for now and wait for a proper installation version that asks for where to store the data and where to install the main program. I can't have blockchains on C:\

You may want to use `datadir=<dir>` in your .conf file...

[18-Jun-19 06:32 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
I may try that. I normally use a junction shortcut, with varying results.

[18-Jun-19 06:43 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
In Agama you could use `Komodo Data Directory`... No messing about in .conf files

[18-Jun-19 06:45 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Your problem may be caused by the inheritance of folder rights, by the way

Hi. I received part of the KMD that was removed from my compromised wallet (RFikcUmokWqh5fd3TRp6XgpRfuAmVQpJbj).
Total amount that was removed was 13.95450207 but only 13 KMD was placed in the address provided in the claim.   
The amount remaining is 0.95450207. It's not a lot but I'd still like it back please. Thank you.
