close agama
Go to %appdata%\Agama
remove config.json file and restart agama

[27-Sep-18 01:27 AM] Hermes#6934
Use this guide  also if that doesn't help completely  https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024854-agama-javascript-error-windows-version/en  .. will add that other solution here @Nabob

[27-Sep-18 01:28 AM] bucksnort70#9150
thanks, that seems to have worked!

Thanks, Nabob

[27-Sep-18 01:40 AM] Alright#0419
@Bryan_Beus are you sure you port forwarded the port properly on your router?

[27-Sep-18 01:40 AM] Alright#0419
and that the machine doesn't have it firewalled?

[27-Sep-18 01:40 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright 

Nabob hopped on with Team Viewer.

[27-Sep-18 01:40 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
My machine is not creating an IPv4 address automatically, and it's somehow related to the wifi

[27-Sep-18 01:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We connected my laptop to teh router via cable, and that solved the issue.

[27-Sep-18 01:41 AM] Alright#0419
just disable ipv6 all together

[27-Sep-18 01:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
we did

[27-Sep-18 01:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
no luck

[27-Sep-18 01:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm wondering how this will affect user adoption

[27-Sep-18 01:41 AM] Alright#0419
assign it a static ip from the router?

[27-Sep-18 01:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It would seem that most newbies won't want to have to buy a VPS just to see what it takes to make their own coin

[27-Sep-18 01:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright 

That would be good -- making a static ip from the router.

[27-Sep-18 01:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm not sure how it's done, though.

[27-Sep-18 01:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I could google search it...

[27-Sep-18 01:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Just would need to play around with it.

[27-Sep-18 01:43 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm wondering how we should present this to newcomers. It's quite likely that an average person will want to test it out at home first, before purchasing a VPS.

[27-Sep-18 01:43 AM] optickle#9937
Can I download the chain to some recent date and kick start agama native?  Looks like it's going to take days to synch

[27-Sep-18 01:43 AM] Alright#0419
it's as simple as making sure the port is open

[27-Sep-18 01:43 AM] Alright#0419
it's not really much of a barrier

[27-Sep-18 01:44 AM] optickle#9937
I selected the "windows 1 connection" fix and it got slower.  Can I undo that?

[27-Sep-18 01:45 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@optickle 

There is a quick sync mode.

[27-Sep-18 01:45 AM] optickle#9937
I'm in

[27-Sep-18 01:45 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm not on the support team, or I would help you. Hermes and nabob can help you figure it out.

[27-Sep-18 01:46 AM] optickle#9937
thanks.  I'm interested

[27-Sep-18 01:47 AM] Nabob#5004
windows one connection is best way for native mode, anyway which coin you loading  ?

[27-Sep-18 01:47 AM] optickle#9937
starting with komodo native so I can do that pirate thing

[27-Sep-18 01:48 AM] Nabob#5004
komodo definetly take time, Launch Pirate straight way, its simple as that

[27-Sep-18 02:48 AM] optickle#9937
Are there addnodes I can try to see if I can get the chain any faster?

[27-Sep-18 02:49 AM] optickle#9937
I have a 250Mb connection fwiw, Atlanta, on comcast

[27-Sep-18 02:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
Pirate by itself should go pretty quick

[27-Sep-18 02:53 AM] optickle#9937
I need KMD to synch native to send KMD though, right?

[27-Sep-18 02:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
Oh yeah, to get the pirate. Ignore me.

[27-Sep-18 02:55 AM] actionslacks#4072
Real pirates never reveal their location though

[27-Sep-18 02:55 AM] optickle#9937
lol  I "might" be in Atlanta   hahaha

[27-Sep-18 02:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
I have a good connection and it takes a little more than a couple of hours.

[27-Sep-18 02:58 AM] Hermes#6934
It should take around 25 minutes to 30 minutes

[27-Sep-18 02:59 AM] Hermes#6934
You can try this node 37.9.62.186

[27-Sep-18 03:00 AM] williamkeffer93#6847
I am having a weird issue for bdex I have downloaded .ultiple times using version 1.1.1

[27-Sep-18 03:01 AM] optickle#9937
@Hermes thanks.  Should I comment or remove the other nodes in the komodo.conf?

[27-Sep-18 03:01 AM] williamkeffer93#6847
All coins are saying undefined when I try to add

[27-Sep-18 03:01 AM] williamkeffer93#6847
Add*

[27-Sep-18 03:01 AM] Hermes#6934
just use addnode and that should work

[27-Sep-18 03:02 AM] Hermes#6934
@williamkeffer93  undefined try restarting the wallet. Which version 2.42C

[27-Sep-18 03:02 AM] Hermes#6934
?

[27-Sep-18 03:07 AM] optickle#9937
ok, dumb question...  apparently at some point I made a second wallet on another computer and put a little KMD in it.  On that computer, can I back up a wallet.dat since I don't have the recovery phrase?  I'll plan to just send the coins out to a wallet I have recovery phrase for.

[27-Sep-18 03:10 AM] williamkeffer93#6847
@Hermes I'm talking about barterdex not agama

[27-Sep-18 03:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @optickle Did you use Native mode (with full blockchain sync and without seed/recovery phrase) on this PC?

[27-Sep-18 03:12 AM] Hermes#6934
@williamkeffer93  Version 1.1.1 right? Ok if that's the version have you tried erasing the coins.json file inside the Barterdex folder inside %appdata%Roaming/Barterdex?

[27-Sep-18 03:12 AM] TonyL#3577
As I remember have to delete `coins.json`

[27-Sep-18 03:12 AM] optickle#9937
@TonyL I was thinking I had used lite mode before, but I just started it up as KMD native and there's a balance on it.  It has been a while.

[27-Sep-18 03:13 AM] williamkeffer93#6847
@Hermes I'm on Mac so appdata isn't a thing I'll look for coins.json and try deleting

[27-Sep-18 03:13 AM] optickle#9937
well, now I don't recall for sure.  I think I did this for pizza/beer in the past

[27-Sep-18 03:13 AM] TonyL#3577
@williamkeffer93  @Hermes routes to coins.json on different platforms:
Windows: C:/Users/<username>/AppData/Roaming/BarterDEX
Linux: /home/<Username>/.BarterDEX
MacOS: ~/Library/Application \Support/BarterDEX

[27-Sep-18 03:14 AM] Hermes#6934
For Mac you will need to press in the file explorer Command+Shift+G and you should be able to access that folder

[27-Sep-18 03:14 AM] optickle#9937
Hmmm.  Maybe I was using barterdex!  lol.  I have the recovery phrase on that.

[27-Sep-18 03:15 AM] Hermes#6934
If that still doesn't help I will recommend a fresh reinstallation ...and yes is coins.json not config.file I mixed it with Agama

[27-Sep-18 03:15 AM] TonyL#3577
@optickle If you've used Native mode and able to see the balance in native mode you definetly can backup `wallet.dat` from this PC. If you used Lite mode you have to backup seed phrase instead

[27-Sep-18 03:17 AM] optickle#9937
ok

[27-Sep-18 03:17 AM] optickle#9937
makes sense

[27-Sep-18 03:17 AM] TonyL#3577
https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/192675854/Location+of+Wallet.dat+File location of wallet.dat file. Might be useful if you used Native mode üòÉ But you have to investigate first in which mode you registered wallet (other words in in which mode you can see funds now)

[27-Sep-18 03:24 AM] Hermes#6934
@williamkeffer93 I will be out of desk but if erasing the coins.json file doesn't work you can try to erase the Barterdex folder and do a fresh installation...Only do this if you don't have any stuck swap or zeroconf deposit pending , after a fresh install it should work without issues.

[27-Sep-18 03:43 AM] williamkeffer93#6847
@Hermes I got it working. Deleting barterdex folder and reinstall did the trick thanks

[27-Sep-18 03:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
I have an issue where it seems like the same pass phrase is generating a different address from one version to another. There‚Äôs  just a few coins in the wallet, but is that possible if you skip enough versions?

[27-Sep-18 03:55 AM] actionslacks#4072
Like From say first bdex to latest

[27-Sep-18 03:58 AM] TonyL#3577
@actionslacks Please try to totally delete BarterDex as @Hermes suggested above  (with your login data backup) data and re-install the latest version. If this problem will be still reproducible after it - you're welcome to drop the ticket to `support@komodoplatform.com`

[27-Sep-18 04:06 AM] actionslacks#4072
Ok thx

I found an additional option, @Nabob .

In the router settings, I was able to "view network," and there I can see the ip addresses of the machines in real time.

I also did a "reserve DHCP address," and now both of my wireless machines are able to ping each other whenever I want! üòÉ

[27-Sep-18 09:39 AM] Nabob#5004
super, thats the good signüòä.

[27-Sep-18 03:45 PM] Elmis#0347
Agama v0.2.42c-beta synchronization is being extremely slow, in almost 5 hours it has only synchronized 8% is a problem of this version or is it just mine?

[27-Sep-18 03:52 PM] SHossain#0007
Windows OS could be slow. Also, sync depends on hardware specs and internet connection along with OS.

[27-Sep-18 03:57 PM] Nabob#5004
@Elmis  You need to enable windows 1 connection, after launch
how many connections you can see on dashboard

[27-Sep-18 04:01 PM] Elmis#0347
@SHossain, in previous versions synchronized in a half an hour, or maybe a little more, this march will take several days, perhaps it will be better to go back to the previous version and wait for a new version after the 42c-beta  @Hermes, now I have 1 conection.

[27-Sep-18 04:23 PM] Hermes#6934
Which coin you are launching Pirate ?

[27-Sep-18 04:23 PM] Elmis#0347
Komodo

[27-Sep-18 04:35 PM] Hermes#6934
Connections should go up after a an amount of the percentage...

[27-Sep-18 04:40 PM] Elmis#0347
I'm using two computers and in one of them I restored the  v0.2.41b and  waiting to see the difference

[27-Sep-18 04:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
How do I get those zcash params

[27-Sep-18 05:13 PM] Hermes#6934
if you are using Agama the zcash params will download automagically

[27-Sep-18 05:14 PM] Hermes#6934
you just need to press download when the window shows you to download them

[27-Sep-18 05:31 PM] Elmis#0347
@Hermes, with v0.2.41b  syncro is  is 15 times faster than with v0.2.42c

[27-Sep-18 05:36 PM] Hermes#6934
did you tried a fresh resync with the 2.42c version?

[27-Sep-18 05:56 PM] Elmis#0347
I tryed and i have restarted synchronization several times and the speed has always been extremely low, i have restored version 41b and now synchronizes at least 15 times faster, there is something strange for my computer in that version, i will wait for the next one to update.

[27-Sep-18 06:21 PM] SHossain#0007
you can then, fully sync KMD using v41b and then, use 42c to continue using. in my computer i didn't notice sync difference. i'll check again.

[28-Sep-18 03:58 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Running into an issue ,  JavaScript error when trying to run 42c

[28-Sep-18 03:58 AM] TonyL#3577
@polycryptoblog Are you running it in Windows?

Try to erase `config.json` file inside the Agama folder as shown in this guide.
Go to `%appdata%/Roaming/Agama`, erase this file and restart Agama.

[28-Sep-18 04:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ok will do
