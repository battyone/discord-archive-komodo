@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  thank you for your reply and advice.......I did the procedure but no success...
Step :4 says to toggle proxy off (it was already off)
       : 5 save app config (done)
      :6 says I should get success message in bottom right corner but this does not happen
So I closed wallet and restarted to try but I still get balance error........before it was server unreachable error

@BOenster SPV may be busy a bit due to the recent load. If no success message on config change, check in settings again just to make sure it applied the change. As it was already off, try turnining it on, save, exit, reload, check if working, if not turn off, save exit, reload

[06-Jun-19 08:21 AM] BOenster#7658
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  ok thanks will try

[06-Jun-19 08:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if all else fails, Native mode deosnt need SPV servers, and is a more secure way to run things TBH, though it will take time and disk space to sync

everyone please use this version of Verus Agama, not the one from website: https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview
the version from website may not work for KMD Lite mode due to connectivity issues

[06-Jun-19 08:33 AM] CryptoJesus#3041
But verus doesnt include hush coin

[06-Jun-19 08:33 AM] CryptoJesus#3041
Why?

[06-Jun-19 08:34 AM] NedBGQ#8462
regarding HUSH and BTCH, what is the solution?

@jeffjam the verus version from website isn't vulnerable
it just won't work

[06-Jun-19 08:36 AM] CryptoJesus#3041
@Deleted User but i cant access the wallet it wont connect. Thats the original wallet which inlcudes Hush. Verus doesnt include Hush so how am i to send the funds?

[06-Jun-19 08:36 AM] CryptoJesus#3041
Nope

[06-Jun-19 08:37 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Use dexstats.info to convert kmd address to hush address

[06-Jun-19 08:38 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Hush native ?

[06-Jun-19 08:38 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Zelcore maybe

Is the attack over anyway?

Would you like to take chances ?

[06-Jun-19 08:40 AM] CryptoJesus#3041
I dont see any option. Hush is only supported by Agama

[06-Jun-19 08:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Extremely high ,  you can convert an address you have the key for to its Hush address format and send there

[06-Jun-19 08:42 AM] Roxin#4844
@CryptoJesus you cand send hush from agama wallet to hushMate wallet

[06-Jun-19 08:42 AM] CryptoJesus#3041

[06-Jun-19 08:46 AM] Malti#3948
@CryptoJesus start a native wallet in agama, send funds to new native wallet and save wallet.dat securely. @Deleted User correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but that should be secure

[06-Jun-19 08:46 AM] Malti#3948
You can extract the wif from that new wallet but don‚Äôt populate it in agama

[06-Jun-19 08:46 AM] CryptoJesus#3041
Yeah might do that but will take all day syncing

[06-Jun-19 08:46 AM] Malti#3948
Cuz that‚Äôs where the exploit is, no?

[06-Jun-19 08:47 AM] Malti#3948
Then, isn‚Äôt a verus public key the same as kmd public key?

[06-Jun-19 08:47 AM] Malti#3948
So even that the verus wallet doesn‚Äôt have the Hush option, normally you could still send your funds to that pubkey

[06-Jun-19 08:47 AM] Malti#3948
I‚Äôm now talking about solution 2 üòâ

[06-Jun-19 08:48 AM] Malti#3948
Ahh. Native it is indeed.

[06-Jun-19 08:49 AM] CryptoJesus#3041
Btw i can sync with native however thats for kmd not hush. Hush is only lite

[06-Jun-19 08:50 AM] Lokom#2178
hi guys, so the solution is to download the Verus agama version in native mode, generate a new address and fill the form the claim the funds right? Or the team is still working on it ?
