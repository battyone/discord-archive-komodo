[06-Jun-19 09:52 PM] PTYX#6840
It's a constant race against new and old vulnerabilities.

[06-Jun-19 09:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Everything else ran on the compromised agama

[06-Jun-19 09:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Verus agama and OceanQT unaffected

[06-Jun-19 09:52 PM] PTYX#6840
What happened to Agama could happen to any wallet and mind you, Agama is open source

[06-Jun-19 09:53 PM] PTYX#6840
In a closed source wallet it would have been more difficult to pinpoint the issue.

That‚Äôs fine they‚Äôll just invalidate the transactions at XRP inc or print $10MM more XRP

[06-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Never heard about hack in the btc core wallet

[06-Jun-19 10:12 PM] dxer666#8963
if i enter old seed in verus agama , it is safe? no problem?

[06-Jun-19 10:15 PM] PTYX#6840
It's happened to blockchain.info

[06-Jun-19 10:15 PM] PTYX#6840
And a few others

[06-Jun-19 10:16 PM] gcharang#6833
@dxer666 its safe

[06-Jun-19 10:23 PM] Alexfrog#1338
this event is very much like the blockchain.info hack from 5 years ago, when Johoe saved a bunch of peoples funds

[06-Jun-19 10:23 PM] Alexfrog#1338
by using the exploit to move them, and then returning them to people

[06-Jun-19 10:23 PM] John the Cashist#7046

[06-Jun-19 10:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
@John the Cashist you can find chameleon pay in app store or play store

[06-Jun-19 10:39 PM] LeshAft9#0083
Coinomi wallet had an incident last year with upstream library on their desktop wallet. Something like the text input component default settings changed in version update to enable spell check by default, it resulted in the seed words being sent to google spell check api for users who restored their seed with that version.

most of us haven't touched the agama 0.3.6 after yesterday's news
so we can't help you troubleshoot it sorry

[06-Jun-19 10:58 PM] gcharang#6833
are you able to run native?

[06-Jun-19 10:59 PM] John the Cashist#7046
Yeah, but it has to download and takes forever

[06-Jun-19 10:59 PM] gcharang#6833
if you want to do it, I can help you with native but with agama 0.3.6 , I can't

@bit_chipper I had the same issue (Komodo Ocean closing on me). I finally closed down lots of programs (browser, Telegram, etc.) I had open and now it seems to be loading.

[06-Jun-19 11:12 PM] chocko#8664
if  old privkey (from komodo qt) entered to old agama wallets

[06-Jun-19 11:12 PM] chocko#8664
are funds safu?

**Moving your CHIPS**

1. Download Verus Agama
<https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview>

2. Login with compromised seed and activate CHIPS

3. In Verus Agama go to Settings > Export Keys > enter compromised seed > Get Private Keys
 - You will see your address and WIF key -> backup that WIF key (it begins with `U`)

4. Logout of the compromised seed

5. Create new, safe wallet/seed in Verus Agama and activate CHIPS 
  -> backup seed and WIF
  -> copy public address - begins with `R`

6. Download Decker's ChipsQT wallet
<https://github.com/DeckerSU/chips3/releases/tag/v0.14.99_decker_2>

7. Import compromised WIF key (from step 3) in ChipsQT - wait for chain to sync

8. Send to safe address (from step 5)

if  old privkey (from komodo qt) entered to old agama wallets
are funds safe?

[06-Jun-19 11:20 PM] chocko#8664
or is it better move to a new address

[06-Jun-19 11:20 PM] gcharang#6833
@chocko no
funds in the addresses that correspond to those privkeys are not safe

[06-Jun-19 11:20 PM] gcharang#6833
better move to a new address

[06-Jun-19 11:21 PM] chocko#8664
becouse privekey was entered to the agama wallet?

why is verus the only wallet being pushed so hard?

[06-Jun-19 11:41 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It shares a common base, and don‚Äôt want to misconstrue that it was affected by the recent event

[06-Jun-19 11:41 PM] gcharang#6833
it has litemode and familiar interface and our team was able to look at the source and verify no known vulnerabilities are in it

[06-Jun-19 11:43 PM] bit_chipper#6010
ok i see, so since many ppl held kmd assets its the best alternative

[06-Jun-19 11:43 PM] bit_chipper#6010
what about the paper wallet generator? is that safe or not?

[06-Jun-19 11:48 PM] bit_chipper#6010
does it have to be a bip38 wallet?

thats fine @madjester but please try the Verus Agama, it works
check if you have this version: https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview
then  disable proxy: https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers/
