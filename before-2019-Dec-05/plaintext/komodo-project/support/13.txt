Yes first time running on native

[11-Jul-18 12:24 AM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
I suspect I need to change my bitnexus.conf file but it is not clear how to properly set the config file based on what I have seen in all of the online instructions and forums. Many people have different settings but say it is working for them

[11-Jul-18 12:24 AM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
Maybe difference between Windows and Linux setup

[11-Jul-18 12:25 AM] Hermes#6934
Ok I have forwarded your message to one of our devs to confirm if there is something missing in the file , we will get back to you shortly

[11-Jul-18 12:25 AM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
Probably RPC settings

[11-Jul-18 12:26 AM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
@Hermes ok thanks

[11-Jul-18 12:35 AM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
What I don't understand is, how can BarterDEX connect to my local wallet if it doesn't know what the RPC username and password are? There is nowhere in BarterDEX to put these settings?

[11-Jul-18 12:45 AM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
Is there a command I can use in debug?

[11-Jul-18 12:49 AM] Hermes#6934
One of our devs thinks that the issue can be in the bitnexus.conf file path

[11-Jul-18 01:00 AM] cipi#4502
yes, because BitNexus wallet uses an unusual path for the config file, the following setting is needed in coins-file ```"confpath":"USERHOME/.bitcoinnodecore/bitnexus.conf"``` and i suspect this does not work properly under Windows: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/BarterDEX/issues/128

Please if you can @./cryptkeeper  try writing into this link to report the issue üëÜ

[11-Jul-18 02:17 AM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
Yes the confpath for Linux is userhome/.bitcoinnodecore/bitnexus.conf

For windows: C:\Users\%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\BitcoinNodeCore\bitnexus.conf

[11-Jul-18 02:17 AM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
I will report the issue on github as suggested

Dear KMD support, i would like to report a two serious bugs here on the Agama wallet

[11-Jul-18 09:10 AM] vinniepinnie123#6489
I just installed the Agama software for windows and have received already 3 different KMD adresses in the same wallet

[11-Jul-18 09:12 AM] vinniepinnie123#6489
first, i opened the Lite mode and send a test transaction from exchange to my new address

[11-Jul-18 09:12 AM] vinniepinnie123#6489
when i opened and closed there was suddenly a different adress

[11-Jul-18 09:14 AM] vinniepinnie123#6489
after that i manually encrypted my seed and again had another adress

[11-Jul-18 09:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@./cryptkeeper I think I answered this in coinsdb repo readme: https://github.com/jl777/coins

please take a look and see if that clears what you need to do with your coins.json setting.

[11-Jul-18 09:15 AM] vinniepinnie123#6489
luckely i did first a test transaction, so it's only a small amount

[11-Jul-18 09:15 AM] vinniepinnie123#6489
however, i can imagine that more people should have this issue

[11-Jul-18 09:16 AM] vinniepinnie123#6489
if needed, i can create a document with print screens and recreate these busgs

[11-Jul-18 09:23 AM] ./cryptkeeper#3265

Hi - trying to get Etomic to start in Bartdex - getting a CoinStatus message saying "could not get Etomic from faucet" First i was trying in Electrum mode and then added Etomic to agama in native and tried - same message - any ideas? thnks

[11-Jul-18 09:43 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@vinniepinnie123 Operator error is not a bug. If you got a different address, then you used a different passphrase. That difference could be as simple as an added space or character.

[11-Jul-18 09:45 AM] vinniepinnie123#6489
no, I used 100% the same passphrase

[11-Jul-18 09:45 AM] vinniepinnie123#6489
i can prove the bug in print screens

[11-Jul-18 09:46 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
`no, I used 100% the same passphrase`
_ComputerGenie is too sleepy to explain why that is impossible and goes to get coffee and his morning bath_

[11-Jul-18 09:50 AM] vinniepinnie123#6489
ok, you don't have to explain me, but then what can be the cause that i have now recorded 3 different adresses when i copy, paste my seed

[11-Jul-18 09:52 AM] Nabob#5004
Please raise support ticket to support@komodoplatform.com
we will check your issue.

Did you extracted Private key as well, for every seed before transferring funds to wallet

[11-Jul-18 09:53 AM] vinniepinnie123#6489
of course a user can make a mistake in the process, but if we want mass adoption of this wallet, user friendly interface is important

[11-Jul-18 09:53 AM] vinniepinnie123#6489
@Nabob thanks, i will make a document and send it there

[11-Jul-18 09:55 AM] Nabob#5004
Please read this quick article:
https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/113410123/Common+wallet+Issues

[11-Jul-18 09:59 AM] Nabob#5004
we had already undergone far more optimisation on user login, and also we are improving 
user friendly interface  has some or other still have effect on user seed handling issue.
If you are using out new 0.2.41 wallet, I have tested couple of times on user Login. It works good. I can retrviee same address

[11-Jul-18 10:31 AM] Nabob#5004
@miles  Please try to add etomic now it works

[11-Jul-18 10:39 AM] miles#6381
@Nabob#    legend üòÉ that does indeed!

[11-Jul-18 10:41 AM] miles#6381
also - are there electrum servers running for ETH? when i add is says they can't find any and to use native

[11-Jul-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <nabob:matrix.org> For Eth, you need to select native coin only

[11-Jul-18 10:44 AM] miles#6381
got it.... thks

I everyone. After reading the white paper (damn that was intense) I've decided to buy couple of KMD ;). I would like to store them on my ledger Nano S but it looks there are some issues with it (balance is not syncing)

[11-Jul-18 01:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
I've tested with 1 KMD. The transaction already has lot of confirmations https://kmdexplorer.ru/address/RW7Fq49JdYgNavYfT8Tzm5ZfuV2cv7JGNk

[11-Jul-18 01:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
I read that the KMD implementation on the Nano is using an obsolete explorer. Could it be the reason?

[11-Jul-18 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Perhaps ask the good folks at Ledger?

[11-Jul-18 01:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sure, but I suppose I'm not the first one to notice üòâ

[11-Jul-18 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Well, the issue is akin to contacting Goodyear tire company when your car will not start.

@Deleted User Let us know the response from ledger there is no reason why KMD is not showing on your ledger device , most likely they need to update their wallet or don't have the correct explorer
