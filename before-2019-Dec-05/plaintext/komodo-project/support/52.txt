from CIpi "could be you are experiencing this issue: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/BarterDEX/issues/128
AYWA has the default datadir/conf-file in an unusual location... ~/.aywacore/aywa.confinstead of ~/.aywa/aywa.conf, so the coins database entry for AWYA contains the additional parameter "conffile": https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins#L78
BarterDEX needs to be able to find and open the coins config file
Look after this config file and check if it contains at least this entries
server=1
rpcuser=whatever
rpcpassword=whatever"

issue relates to electrum, you need to add electrum servers to repo first, without which you cannot load electrum option.  @Aywa Developers

[10-Nov-18 06:54 PM] Aywa Developers#3627
@Nabob  we use native mode. and getting error about electrum. can I raise pull request for 1 electrum server?

Can i switch between litemode and native of kmd in agama and use native pirate at the same time

[11-Nov-18 08:18 AM] Acura#2748
Yes you can use lite mode kmd and pirate native at the same time

[11-Nov-18 08:22 AM] plazma#1625
@Acura i want to use native kmd and pirate native but if situation call like net problem in future then i wana switch back to litemodo of kmd.....is it possible

[11-Nov-18 08:28 AM] Hermes#6934
You should export the keys in Lite mode https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024495-export-komodo-privatekeys-using-agama and import it  in native mode

[11-Nov-18 08:28 AM] plazma#1625
@Hermes yes i use komodo native i got a new wallet

[11-Nov-18 08:34 AM] Hermes#6934
If you  want to switch to lite mode make sure you have the private keys of the address that has your funds in native , with this private key you can enter the lite mode version of the wallet when you need it

[11-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Hermes#6934
The guide above show how this is done , with this private  you can access the lite mode version of the wallet when you need

[11-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Hermes#6934
But I will recommend to see the guides for native first if you started using it

Always Backup your wallet.dat before making any changes!!

[11-Nov-18 08:42 AM] Hermes#6934
When you export the private keys in native mode remember that this private key is only for one specific address

[11-Nov-18 08:45 AM] Hermes#6934
And this private key can be used in lite mode the same way as you use your seed and you will be able enter only  that specific address

[11-Nov-18 08:45 AM] Hermes#6934
Finally I will just advise to read more about in the guides 😉

[11-Nov-18 08:47 AM] plazma#1625
@Hermes thanks i have to study so much

[12-Nov-18 12:36 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
i start HyperDEX to see if there is somebody

[12-Nov-18 12:46 AM] Hermes#6934
Will look into it shortly , that’s a little strange are you seeing the icons of the coins ?

[12-Nov-18 12:46 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
yes but the name is strange

[12-Nov-18 12:46 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
unknows

[12-Nov-18 12:47 AM] Hermes#6934
Try erasing the coins.json file inside the %appdata%Roaming/Barterdex  and restart the Dex

[12-Nov-18 12:48 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
okk

[12-Nov-18 12:49 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
well i dont have any files there

[12-Nov-18 12:49 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
only the komodo.conf  where i insert some line

[12-Nov-18 12:49 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
cause i use Agama App native mode..for  shiled tx

[12-Nov-18 12:51 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
now is working

[12-Nov-18 12:54 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
questions: the offers from barterdex  are the same from HyperDEX  ?

[12-Nov-18 01:04 AM] Hermes#6934
@kmdbrt_test  do it in %appdata%/Roaming/Barterdex i had a typo there

[12-Nov-18 01:05 AM] Hermes#6934
The orders are the same because both of them use marketmaker

[12-Nov-18 01:06 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
yes is working now

[12-Nov-18 01:06 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
but in HyperDEX do i need to   "broke" my  coins in smaller amounts like i was suppose to do in barter dex?

[12-Nov-18 01:07 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
i use barterdex   in February 2018  just for fun

[12-Nov-18 01:08 AM] Hermes#6934
Hyperdex is better because it helps with splitting UTXOs but it’s alway good to have some spare change 😉

[12-Nov-18 01:10 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
i see  is not needed

[12-Nov-18 01:10 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
but i still dont get it

[12-Nov-18 01:12 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
i wanna  swamp some kmd to ltc

[12-Nov-18 01:12 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
i add 20kmd in HyperDEX

[12-Nov-18 01:12 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
i see  3 LTC sell orders

[12-Nov-18 01:12 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
Price KMD    Avg Vol    Max Vol
44.99732208    0.44997322    4.4997322

47.6651535    21.44931907    21.44931907

[12-Nov-18 01:13 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
max vol mean how many ltc is for the  kmd price?

[12-Nov-18 01:18 AM] Hermes#6934
That’s the max volume of LTC  available in that particular case they can swap for KMD

[12-Nov-18 01:20 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
well i do open an order  but is not starting

[12-Nov-18 01:21 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
if there is 4.49 ltc  at 44.99 kmd  then my  20kmd order need to go instant

[12-Nov-18 01:22 AM] Hermes#6934
You can also try doing some doing some secondary orders sometimes it doesn’t go in the first one ...

[12-Nov-18 01:25 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
i will like that  the deposit address to  change after each  deposit ...

[12-Nov-18 01:25 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
to use a new one

[12-Nov-18 01:25 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
but from what i see  no   exchange use that

[12-Nov-18 01:25 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
they give you one address and that s it

[12-Nov-18 01:29 AM] Hermes#6934
Remember that you are entering this the same way via a seed passphrase and yes I think it makes things easier ...to have one address only. For records and also for better user experience.

[12-Nov-18 01:31 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
yess but no for privacy !

[12-Nov-18 01:31 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
will be easy to see how many times i deposit in that address

[12-Nov-18 01:31 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
not safe!

[12-Nov-18 01:32 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
last question and  i will not bother you anymore

[12-Nov-18 01:33 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
why in HyperDEX my offer request is different  then the broadcast one..

[12-Nov-18 01:35 AM] kmdbrt_test#4033
nobody take my order

[12-Nov-18 01:41 AM] Hermes#6934
Remember that Hyperdex is matching the closest order based in your balance and your utxo ...so if you have 20 and the closest utxo that works is for 19 it will take this as reference...this is based in UTXOs not like other exchanges

[12-Nov-18 01:47 AM] Hermes#6934
Regarding to the privacy question Barterdex needs transparent addresses and transactions to be able to see what’s happening that’s it’s main use

[12-Nov-18 02:18 AM] Hermes#6934
sorry I was out of desk for a while driving ...I will try using Jumblr if you need to have more control or privacy ...but I understand your point

[12-Nov-18 06:46 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I keep getting error code: -4 witness for note commitment is null , anyone know what the problem is?  This is when trying to send pirate newest agama

[12-Nov-18 06:59 PM] Hermes#6934
Are you trying to send the whole balance ? Also is the transaction not being processed or not executed ?

[12-Nov-18 07:02 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
No any amount ,  even tried with just one .  It's not being executed failed status .

[12-Nov-18 07:22 PM] Hermes#6934
Strange which OS is this happening in ? Have you already tried restarting the wallet to see if it still persists?

[12-Nov-18 07:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes I tried restarting,  windows 10

@polycryptoblog  If you are in the latest block that shouldn't be happening....I will try first doing a reindex of the blocks or rescan can also maybe help.  https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024520-reindex-komodo-blockchain-with-agama/en and if that doesn't help maybe doing a fresh installation of Agama.  I will test in Windows 10 shortly and will see  if I can reproduce.

can anyone help me please with agama wallet? i have fresh started my laptop after a grafik driver update. now when i will start agama, he sayd i must close other running agama instance. but problem is, i find no other running agama instance. how i can bring my wallet back running? thanks for help.

[13-Nov-18 04:49 AM] Hermes#6934
@Thuerlich  Go to the task manager and check if the process Komodod or Agama is still running in the background....

[13-Nov-18 04:51 AM] Thuerlich#0984
no komodo and no agama found running in taskmanager

[13-Nov-18 04:51 AM] Hermes#6934
if it was a fresh installation it shouldn't happen but maybe the program got executed twice and it was running in the moment...

[13-Nov-18 04:52 AM] Hermes#6934
it just doesn't let you open the program main window  right?

[13-Nov-18 04:54 AM] Hermes#6934
I would make sure restarting the PC again and making just sure that the application is only executed one time when clicking in the .exe file
