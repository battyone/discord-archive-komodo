@Jacobstoon @satindergrewal @KomodoPlatform So Bittrex is already using this feature, but not really using it? A little confused with wording.

@neurobound @Acura6666 Bittrex's system picked this up automatically. But, in order to take benefit from this, they need to reduce the conf number from 30 to 10 or 15 or 20 whichever they like.

Hi I have kmd in my android guarda wallet but I keep getting an 16: tx-overwinter-active error..when trying to sen funds out of my wallet. Can I do something about it

[01-Jan-19 07:24 PM] Hermes#6934
@Sherdogz  have you contacted the Guarda team ? They should be up to date to the latest sapling implementation  but still Guarda is a third party wallet ...so you will need to contact them.

[01-Jan-19 07:27 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Yes I've contacted them they're working on the issue. I thought there was only a problem with claiming rewards but now I realize my funds are stuck. I thought maybe I'd get some information here.

[02-Jan-19 06:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Export private key and import it into agama

[02-Jan-19 01:09 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Is this possible?

[02-Jan-19 01:15 PM] Nabob#5004
Yes, Its possible, Export private key or seed and you can use to login agama Lite mode directly for accessing funds @Sherdogz

[02-Jan-19 02:04 PM] Sherdogz#6731
@Nabob thanks!, so export    key meaning importing seed in agama that's it? Or does exporting the seed require another step?

[02-Jan-19 02:18 PM] Nabob#5004
@Sherdogz  Yes, If you are in native mode you can import private key or you can login seed or private key  when using agama lite mode.

[02-Jan-19 06:44 PM] Sherdogz#6731
@Nabob thanks it worked fine 👌

[02-Jan-19 07:38 PM] Andreas I Andrew I Meatec.io#5823
can someone explain me why i cant claim my rewards ?

[02-Jan-19 07:39 PM] Andreas I Andrew I Meatec.io#5823

hi there anyone knows a Go library or C one that can be called from Go which supports sapling & overwinter?

[03-Jan-19 02:05 PM] SHossain#0007
@kimmel (Pungo.io) better ask dev questions in #dev-general channel.

[03-Jan-19 02:19 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275

[04-Jan-19 03:48 AM] Hermes#6934
@jasonabis  use this guide https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html

[04-Jan-19 03:49 AM] Hermes#6934
when you do git checkout dev you should up to date with the latest dev branch

[04-Jan-19 03:49 AM] jasonabis#8549
will this guide make me do anything that will delete my wallet.dat?

[04-Jan-19 03:50 AM] Hermes#6934
no this files won't be touched. you can continue in the same way as Alright suggested

[04-Jan-19 03:50 AM] Hermes#6934
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo
git checkout dev
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)

if you have made it already this far in to the instructions you are doing a resync from scratch basically and you are also making sure that you are in the latest branch...it should work after finishing the instructions. You will start syncing blocks in the correct chain

[04-Jan-19 03:52 AM] jasonabis#8549
ok,  so i need to refer to the guide? or just continue with what Alright suggested?

[04-Jan-19 03:55 AM] Hermes#6934
continue with the instructions given by Alright no issues , the guide was just for you to see  the git checkout dev command but he has already given you that instruction

[04-Jan-19 03:55 AM] jasonabis#8549
ok. so just skip the git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo command?

just tried and got Fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

[04-Jan-19 03:58 AM] Hermes#6934
Just one question , why you are using CLI if you don't have experience with Linux or CLi commands? Agama has MGNX in the wallet in native mode tab

[04-Jan-19 03:59 AM] jasonabis#8549
because i was helping @MagnaDev with some tests... just following her directions. she's not around anymore to help.

[04-Jan-19 03:59 AM] jasonabis#8549
and I don't know how to get my coins to the agama windows wallet.

[04-Jan-19 04:00 AM] jasonabis#8549
and don't want to screw anything up or lose my coins...

it can take some time ...

[04-Jan-19 04:07 AM] jasonabis#8549
let me ask you, if my ultimate goal is to get these mgnx coins to agama wallet and stake them there, do i even have to do this? i think i tried and it wouldn't let me because i was on wrong chain.

[04-Jan-19 04:07 AM] Hermes#6934
after it's done go back and do this commands ...

[04-Jan-19 04:13 AM] Hermes#6934
Well to be honest you shouldn't because your wallet.dat is located in the same folder it doesn't matter if you are using  CLI or GUI ...so unless you are trying to learn command line you will just need to launch the coin in the latest version 0.3.2a  of the wallet ...here is it MGNX running with no issues so far

[04-Jan-19 04:14 AM] Hermes#6934
Not quite sure why they suggested to use the CLI , I haven't heard about issues while using the GUI version of the wallet .

[04-Jan-19 04:14 AM] jasonabis#8549
it was before the GUI wallet supported mgnx i guess.

[04-Jan-19 04:14 AM] jasonabis#8549
so run in native?

[04-Jan-19 04:15 AM] jasonabis#8549
actually, this is where i am.

[04-Jan-19 04:15 AM] jasonabis#8549
oh, it won't let me paste screenshot

[04-Jan-19 04:17 AM] Hermes#6934
You can use imgur.com

[04-Jan-19 04:18 AM] Hermes#6934
But I would recommend using the GUi in any case here is the link for the latest version of the wallet https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/

the wallet that you are using is no longer up to date

[04-Jan-19 04:21 AM] jasonabis#8549
oy

[04-Jan-19 04:21 AM] Hermes#6934
you need to download the new version ...you are stuck in block 114262

[04-Jan-19 04:21 AM] jasonabis#8549
ok

[04-Jan-19 04:22 AM] jasonabis#8549
ill do that and let it catch up. would you mind if i reach out to you tomorrow for help getting my coins safely from linux wallet to agama wallet?

[04-Jan-19 04:22 AM] jasonabis#8549
i did this command and stopped there.  ./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)

[04-Jan-19 04:25 AM] Hermes#6934
no problem ...you didn't went to a fork for what I can tell so actually after updating the wallet  is possible that your chain starts working normally

[04-Jan-19 04:25 AM] jasonabis#8549
well, i never had my coins in the gui wallet

[04-Jan-19 04:26 AM] Hermes#6934
there is no risk of funds being lost...you haven't done anything for what I can tell that could have erased your wallet.dat file ...the same computer where you were using the command line is the same computer where you have agama currently installed right?

[04-Jan-19 04:27 AM] Hermes#6934
if that's the case when you update to the new version of the Agama wallet and fully sync the chain you will be able to see your coins in Agama

[04-Jan-19 04:29 AM] jasonabis#8549
ahh no, sorry i didn't mention that. linux wallet was on vps.

[04-Jan-19 04:29 AM] Hermes#6934
so your funds are in a Linux VPS?

[04-Jan-19 04:30 AM] jasonabis#8549
yes

[04-Jan-19 04:30 AM] Hermes#6934
the address that has the funds was created in a Linux VPS ok...

[04-Jan-19 04:30 AM] Hermes#6934
you can still do the same procedure in the VPS you can install Agama in the Linux server ...is it Ubuntu?

[04-Jan-19 04:31 AM] jasonabis#8549
i'd rather just get it into my windows wallet. as you can see, i'm all thumbs when it comes to linux.

[04-Jan-19 04:32 AM] jasonabis#8549
can i just use my wif key to get the funds into agama?

[04-Jan-19 04:33 AM] Hermes#6934
If you have the Wif key that has all your funds...that's very easy task you will just need to import the key as showed here  https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024488-import-private-key-in-agama-native-mode/en

[04-Jan-19 04:34 AM] Hermes#6934
If you don't know if that Wif key that you have contains the complete funds of your wallet. I will suggest to use the linux version of Agama in the previous link that I sent before and run the native wallet and export the pertaining Wif key or send it to a new address that you control.

[04-Jan-19 04:36 AM] Hermes#6934
In that way you can use the Agama wallet to manage your funds instead of the CLI in your VPS ...and save some time if you are not used to the CLI

[04-Jan-19 04:37 AM] jasonabis#8549
okay, I will follow the instructions in the link above to move the funds with my wif key. if they are all there, amazing. if not, i will do my best to follow the linux procedure you've outlined. thanks for being so patient and helping me.

[04-Jan-19 04:39 AM] Hermes#6934
no worries here to help...Agama makes things easier you can download it in your VPS and verify your funds ,then you can complete the task of exporting the pertaining WIF key holding  all your funds if needed and import them to your windows Pc wallet.
