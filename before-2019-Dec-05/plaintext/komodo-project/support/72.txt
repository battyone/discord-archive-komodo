it says `virtual memory exhausted` ... -j8 is too much, since every compile thread will use 1GB RAM and more, so if you don't have a lot of RAM, you should lower the value... try with -j4 or less

[04-Feb-19 03:58 PM] SlhCn#0104
i have 4gb ram only..

[04-Feb-19 04:01 PM] cipi#4502
i suppose there are also some things running on this computer, that also uses some of the 4GB... i would remove the `-j` option completely, so just do `./zcutil/build.sh`, just to be sure you are not running out of RAM during compile

this is all of my screen..

[04-Feb-19 05:19 PM] cipi#4502
ooops... weird error... `undefined reference` to whatever... could be that the last compile produced some corrupted files... you could try to either `git clone` from scratch and thus also compile from scratch... or maybe `make clean` and then `./zcutil/build.sh` again

[04-Feb-19 05:20 PM] cipi#4502
with `last compile`i mean the one that crashed with `out of memory` ... when RAM gets full, weird things can happen

ledger firmware up to date?

[11-Feb-19 08:29 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
any airdrops coming for KMD?

[12-Feb-19 07:45 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Im curious about KMD supply

[12-Feb-19 07:45 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
All I find is that Available Supply (KMD) is 111,804,217
Also, Total Supply (KMD) is 111,804,217

[12-Feb-19 07:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
How can this be? what is the current circulating supply of KMD? How many are still out there to be mined?

[12-Feb-19 07:48 PM] SHossain#0007
current supply = 111,800,781
total supply in next 11-12 years = 200,000,000

[12-Feb-19 07:50 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Oh, ok... Is there another halving coming? soon ?

[12-Feb-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
in 12 years it goes from 3 to 2KMD, then in 25 years from now to 1KMD

[12-Feb-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
by the year 3000 there might be over 777 million KMD

[12-Feb-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
but in 25 years the inflation rate will be quarter percent per year

[12-Feb-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
in 12 years at about half percent per year

[12-Feb-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
rewards stops in 12 years

[12-Feb-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
the next decade is what nostalgic people will remember with fondness the 5% rewards

[12-Feb-19 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure what we can do. we have asked them to increase from 4 decimals trading to at least 7, on many occasions over last year.... nothing

[12-Feb-19 10:35 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[12-Feb-19 10:40 PM] SHossain#0007

[12-Feb-19 10:45 PM] SHossain#0007

hi Do I have to send my kmd somewhere before 15 Feb to be able to swap?

[13-Feb-19 09:13 PM] yorklab#7270
If your address begins with an "R" you  are fine.

[13-Feb-19 09:24 PM] chocko#8664

Have my KMD on my ledger Nano. If I understand correctly I don‚Äôt need to do anything

[14-Feb-19 12:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
Likewise, can anyone confirm if ledger is safe?

[14-Feb-19 12:36 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have coins in Ledger Nano S, your coins are safe and fine.

[14-Feb-19 12:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Same with Bittrex, I have a small amount there, anyone know if I need to do anything with those?

[14-Feb-19 12:40 PM] SHossain#0007
you don't need to do anything if your funds are in exchange

[14-Feb-19 12:40 PM] SHossain#0007
only if you used native mode by any means and have funds in address starts with `z`

[14-Feb-19 12:43 PM] Scarborough#9066
Hello, my KMDs are stored in Agama, what I need to do?

[14-Feb-19 12:44 PM] Angelina#6231
If your funds are stored on the address that starts with R, you don't need to do anything

[14-Feb-19 12:45 PM] Scarborough#9066

The receiving address of the Agama wallet starts from R, does it mean I don't need to do anything?

Thank you Angelina.

[14-Feb-19 12:49 PM] SHossain#0007
@Scarborough you don't have to do anyting. R address is good for KMD

Hi. I just seen this on blockfolio. I have my kmd in an agama wallet from 18 months ago. Do I need to move them?

[14-Feb-19 02:16 PM] Angelina#6231
Are funds on the address that starts with R or z? If R - you don't need to do anything

[14-Feb-19 02:17 PM] jr81#8956
Not sure. I was travelling all last year. All my details are safe and secure at my parents house. Which is another state

[14-Feb-19 02:18 PM] Angelina#6231
Do you remember the mode Agama was running in - Lite or Native?

[14-Feb-19 02:18 PM] jr81#8956
I think lite

[14-Feb-19 02:22 PM] Angelina#6231
Then you should be fine

[14-Feb-19 02:23 PM] jr81#8956
Its midnight here. I'll get up in 7hrs and see what info I can dig up... what happens if its not moved in 12 hours??
