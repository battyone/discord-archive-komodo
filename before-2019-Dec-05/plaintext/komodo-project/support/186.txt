Hello! I have a troubleshooting issue üòá

[12-Nov-19 11:14 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
So I've just imported some dev funds for DigitalPrice onto the Verus Agama wallet, fully synced and everything. But my balance remains zero in my wallet, despite the explorer showing many more..?

[13-Nov-19 01:26 AM] Alright#0419
@Zanzarismo check that you aren't on a fork, check that `validateaddress <address>` shows "ismine" as true

[13-Nov-19 01:29 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
CLI response:

{ "isvalid": true, "address": "RVH4EJRNKF8M6vDsBMPBgsw4UvFYVfhiSS", "scriptPubKey": "76a914db5bf6cc01309335b35f320ecf36ce73121060dc88ac", "segid": 21, "ismine": true, "iswatchonly": false, "isscript": false, "pubkey": "021e83abc9a25c0dd66a87d6643232b6b0b7adf6f3cf62d8452c323940cef7fb21", "iscompressed": true, "account": "" }

[13-Nov-19 01:33 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
So the "ismine" is true, üòÖ I'm stuck still üòÅ

[13-Nov-19 01:36 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
Should I restart the wallet?

[13-Nov-19 05:49 AM] Oszy#5734
did you try to rescan manually? do that, and if still 0 then reindex, funds are on chain so your chain data is not correct.

[13-Nov-19 06:49 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
To rescan manually, you just validate the address, no?

[13-Nov-19 07:07 PM] Zanzarismo#6500

Hi there! I recently made a claim to return my coins which was moved to a safe wallet during the Agama hack in June. How long does this usually take?

I talked with gcharang regarding proving ownership of a old wallet to claim my coins from an safe wallet. He went offline. Is there anyone else that can assist me? Somehow all my transactions to the old wallet, seems to get forwarded. Which i belive only i have access to.

[14-Nov-19 05:04 PM] Oszy#5734

If it's on the safe address nothing to worry about

When we had the hack I sent wlc to the veruscoin wallet(even though I can't see them because they didn't have support for it). Noe I want to swap my wlc coins to wlc21 chain so I think I still need to use the agama wallet...

you have to download from the site everytime

they are an ecosystem project, the repos are open source, the founders are public and have a good relationship with our project

We will have our own desktop litewallet when AtomicDEX desktop is released, till then, ocean qt wallet is developed by Komodo team and can be used for desktop native

@CoinKing88 not unsafe
if you are using native, will go on a fork

[17-Nov-19 07:08 PM] Arno#3334
I hope someone from the Komodo team with technical knowledge and access rights can help. In a failed atomicDEX trade, me being the maker, the trade timed out at step 2/3 resulting in my funds (KMD) having been sent into an address starting with "b...", but since the swap failed I have not received the other coins. In the telegram they told me just to wait for 4 hours for an automatic refund, but now almost 6 hours have passed without any result. How can I get my funds back?

[17-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Arno#3334
Who has / where is the private key to that "b..." address to make a refund possible?

[17-Nov-19 07:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Its a multisig addr I believe, not sure how to unlock, but its possible. Best to wait for teammember to assist üôÇ

[17-Nov-19 08:23 PM] Oszy#5734
@Arno  refund will come automatically. If not, you will see an "unlock funds" button in the history.

[17-Nov-19 08:23 PM] Oszy#5734
May I ask what coins did you swap?

[17-Nov-19 08:27 PM] Arno#3334
sell KMD, buy DEX

[17-Nov-19 08:27 PM] Arno#3334
But how long will it take?

[17-Nov-19 08:27 PM] riseandfall#3726
Hello,
I have some KMDs on a ledger but I can't transfer them. Ledger live (ledger software wallet) says that the transaction failed.  (So they are blocked there üòí)
I so want to import my seed to agama wallet. But my seed is 24 words +an additional passphrase (this is a feature of BIP39 AFAIK)
My question is : Will it work if I enter in Agama wallet  25 (24 + 1) words ?

[17-Nov-19 08:30 PM] Oszy#5734
Normally it's 4 hours @Arno  sometimes a bit more, only the multisig address can unlock the funds for you, either automatically after some time, or you manually pressing the "unlock funds" button in atomicdex in case the swap was stuck. 
Wait a bit more and if it doesn't unlock please send your swap log (settings > share log)  to TonyL or gcharang

[17-Nov-19 08:35 PM] Acura#2748
@riseandfall Which Komodo Version do you have on the LEdger? you can also try via Magnumwallet to send.
