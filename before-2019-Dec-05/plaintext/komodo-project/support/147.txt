[16-Jun-19 09:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Looks like the last time it was claimed was nearly 2 hours ago

[16-Jun-19 09:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
1 KMD a day / 24 * 2= 0.04 roughly

[16-Jun-19 09:57 AM] alen#3721
It should have been a lot more...last claim was at 1.13pm on 15.june it should be mlre

[16-Jun-19 09:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[16-Jun-19 09:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I can see in some txs there is no rewards

[16-Jun-19 09:58 AM] alen#3721
Yes

[16-Jun-19 09:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Only Magnum or some devs can answer why there was no claim on some of your txs

[16-Jun-19 09:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Have you tried the Verus Agama wallet?

[16-Jun-19 10:00 AM] alen#3721
Ok thank you..i appreciate it. No i havent. Last time i panicked and just moved all fast to magnum

[16-Jun-19 10:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Or you can put it on a ledger if you have one and claim via the online website

[16-Jun-19 10:01 AM] alen#3721
@hyperDEX thank you i will try

[16-Jun-19 10:01 AM] EC#3791

That is the link to it, basically agama but without the exploit

[16-Jun-19 10:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@EC should be the same as before, each of the KMD assetchains would have the same address from the seed

Where is the rfox coin in this wallet? https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview

afaik it's only in the 0.5.7 version

[16-Jun-19 12:46 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
You can create a new wallet in that agama and send your RFOX to it though. The privkey for KMD wallet will be the same privkey for an RFOX wallet

given enough time, I'm convinced you can write anything, jl.  Honestly, my funds are actually probably safer with you while you work on it than they'd be with me, anyway.

I understand asset chain refunds are starting, do we need to do anything for that? And is there a planning for BTC?

Hi, will all coins that were on the old Komodo agama wallet be transferred to the new Verus wallet along with any KMD?

[16-Jun-19 04:35 PM] SHossain#0007
for every coin you have to submit a claim

[16-Jun-19 04:35 PM] SHossain#0007
there is a claim form for each coin

[16-Jun-19 04:58 PM] qwens#9129
@SHossain Can I contact you in a personal message?

[16-Jun-19 06:01 PM] orange sunshine#8588
if i understood correctly the rev / jmblr refunds went out today. Submitted by forms just yesterday, would that be why i'm not seeing them.

[16-Jun-19 06:01 PM] orange sunshine#8588

[16-Jun-19 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[16-Jun-19 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
you also need to send the dust from the old address to the claim address

[16-Jun-19 06:04 PM] orange sunshine#8588
sounds fine, thanks. have sent the dust.

[16-Jun-19 06:21 PM] Dukem202#8139
reading the instructions i see the safe address does not match. The address that the kmd was moved was RH5H6HXCeai8osbrwAFbiUayBYNMoRkpFk which is not a "safe" address. So my funds are irrecoverable right?

[16-Jun-19 06:21 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477

@TL you'll need to send the dust kmd received in old address to your new address.

Anyone know how to earn rewards with the Ocean (qt) wallet?

[16-Jun-19 06:49 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
you just have to send a transaction to yourself that is greater than 10 kmd

[16-Jun-19 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a "use all funds" button, send all funds to yourself

[16-Jun-19 06:51 PM] guttermonk#5375
I was able to claim rewards that I earned from my Agama wallet by doing that, but since then the rewards stays at 0.00

[16-Jun-19 06:51 PM] guttermonk#5375
not sure if there's something I have to type into console to start earning rewards again?

[16-Jun-19 06:53 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
send "use all funds" to yourself again. It should fix that. It has something to do with nlocktime.
