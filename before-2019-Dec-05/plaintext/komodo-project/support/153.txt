If I need to create a new set of private keys in native mode. Can I just remove the wallet.dat file and let agama create a new one?

[22-Jun-19 01:39 AM] PTYX#6840
yup

[22-Jun-19 01:44 AM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
@PTYX is that a yup to me?

[22-Jun-19 01:50 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

Hi. Just downloaded the wallet, but it won't run. Says: "Cannot parse configuration file: Missing komodo.conf." But it's there in the same folder. üò¶

I'm trying to send LTC from my agama wallet, but it says "Invalid Pub Address" any idea what I can do about that?

[22-Jun-19 05:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[22-Jun-19 05:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

The form is asking me the address where the funds were stored but my wallet doesen't show the history .. i only have the private key and no fund(anymore) in it, what should i do ?

[22-Jun-19 10:07 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Cardano  if you have the key you should have the address

[22-Jun-19 10:20 PM] Cardano#1078

Hi. One last thing to check on before my claims from the swept funds are fully dealt with. I did receive my CHIPS dust, and moved to the new address, but have yet to see the return funds. I think I saw JL say that this is now done once a week, but I think I was in well before it started (moved dust to new address on June 13)

[23-Jun-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810

[23-Jun-19 01:36 PM] nasbats#7785

I should move it and the other coins to a new wallet correct?

[23-Jun-19 07:44 PM] SHossain#0007
how did you check your balance?

[23-Jun-19 07:45 PM] rainbro7#4735
Agama verus

[23-Jun-19 07:45 PM] SHossain#0007
ok

[23-Jun-19 07:45 PM] rainbro7#4735
But I think I checked two weeks ago

[23-Jun-19 07:45 PM] SHossain#0007
then, it seems your funds are safe

[23-Jun-19 07:45 PM] rainbro7#4735
On regular Agama

[23-Jun-19 07:45 PM] rainbro7#4735
Just in case, I will move it

[23-Jun-19 07:46 PM] SHossain#0007
that would be best

[23-Jun-19 07:46 PM] rainbro7#4735
Can I make a new wallet in agama verus?

[23-Jun-19 07:46 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[23-Jun-19 07:46 PM] rainbro7#4735

Hi , Hoping I can get some help as I have tried everything I can think of to get to my non working wallet. A bit of background....I rebooted my system after the coins were pulled out of my wallet and created a new agama verus wallet. I didn't know I had to pull out the existing funds. But either way I was not able to to access my wallet as it went blank and so I rebooted the system and created the new wallet . However my last address where the funds were pulled out I do not have the  seed phrase. I have the pin pasword.  Back in March I created Agama wallet and  moved my KMD coins into it and have the seed phrase. Then I moved them all out into my binance exchange. However, I decided to go back into KMD coin and bought a lot and went back to my wallet typing the seed phrase (not copying and pasting)...and it gave me a different address but I didn't realize that this address was not the same as my oriignial address. So I don't know what letter or space is dfifferent from my original seed phrase. I did a restore point and was able tto access the wallet with the pin word but then goes blank. I contacted the support team and they told me to try the pin file to move...tried that and still can't access my wallet in agama verus to get the seed word. I feel hopeless. Any help would be appreciated.

[23-Jun-19 08:11 PM] rainbro7#4735
Is there a reason why verus agama is safer than kmd Agama?

[23-Jun-19 08:12 PM] rainbro7#4735
Or is it simply because the bad actor was not part of the verus team?

[23-Jun-19 08:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@rainbro7 the bad actors were not part of the komodo team either. Please read about what actually happened. This is and will happen to every coin project eventually unless they write 100% of their own code.

[23-Jun-19 08:14 PM] rainbro7#4735
Sorry, I meant contributed to the github

[23-Jun-19 08:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Correct

[23-Jun-19 08:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Verus Agama was forked from a older code base without this dependency

[23-Jun-19 08:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
and thus did not have that issue

[23-Jun-19 08:15 PM] rainbro7#4735
Thank you KMD team. Great support. All my funds are now safe.

0.5.7-1 is the latest version

[23-Jun-19 08:29 PM] just_xu_it#3246
I don‚Äôt quite remember my address though. Would the only way I can access my address is through the original agama app?

[23-Jun-19 08:31 PM] SHossain#0007
do you have your seed phrase or private key?

[23-Jun-19 08:34 PM] just_xu_it#3246
Yes I do

[23-Jun-19 08:35 PM] Rachel#1921
@Deleted User sorry to ask a dumb question but am new to discord. How do I send a word file that shows the screenshots? I will try to figure this out ...

[23-Jun-19 08:37 PM] SHossain#0007
@just_xu_it use your seed phrase into Verus Agama to login.

[23-Jun-19 08:37 PM] SHossain#0007
same way as official Agama if you used it few months ago

[23-Jun-19 08:41 PM] just_xu_it#3246
Okay sounds good thanks @SHossain. Can you conduct the transfer in Verus?

[23-Jun-19 08:41 PM] SHossain#0007
what do you mean?

[23-Jun-19 08:42 PM] SHossain#0007
never send your seed phrase or private key to anyone to transfer your funds. do it yourself.

[23-Jun-19 08:54 PM] Rachel#1921
@Deleted User Do you know why?

[23-Jun-19 08:54 PM] Rachel#1921
or how I can get back in?

[23-Jun-19 08:54 PM] Rachel#1921
they told me the funds were moved and are safe

[23-Jun-19 08:56 PM] Rachel#1921
ok. I do have the original seedword for my first address. But my second address I don't as I typed it out and not sure what I changed. However the pinword is the same for both.

[23-Jun-19 08:56 PM] just_xu_it#3246
@SHossain sorry, confusing question... is there a function in Verus where you can conduct the transfer of funds from the original Agama wallet to Verus?

[23-Jun-19 08:57 PM] Oszy#5734
Verus agama uses the same wallet.dat so you will see your old address (in native) in light use same seed to send funds to new address.

[23-Jun-19 08:59 PM] SHossain#0007
create a new address with Verus Agama. backup seed and address, login multiple times to ensure you get the right address each time.
login with old seed, activate each coin, send funds to the new address you created

[23-Jun-19 08:59 PM] allbits#5898
What was the version number in affected agama? 0.3.6?

[23-Jun-19 09:00 PM] Oszy#5734
and some older ones

[23-Jun-19 09:01 PM] allbits#5898

Hey @SHossain it looks like I sent my KMD from my original wallet to a separate wallet address I created in the old Agama app and so I show a balance of 0. At this point, should I enter my old Agama app and try and transfer funds to my new address in Verus?

I connected my ledger and I got a txt file of some sort

[24-Jun-19 05:32 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Is this txt file like the private key or something?

[24-Jun-19 05:36 AM] PTYX#6840
No

[24-Jun-19 05:36 AM] PTYX#6840
When you use ledger the txt file is for watch only (public key). Like ledger live without ledger

[24-Jun-19 05:36 AM] PTYX#6840
You need the ledger to make a TX

[24-Jun-19 05:38 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
