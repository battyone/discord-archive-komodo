[22-Dec-18 01:25 AM] agnewpickens#7393
OK thx, I think I need to activate pirate first since I relaunched, will try the command again once pirate launches.

[22-Dec-18 01:25 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Invalid or unsuspected token error after pirate activated.

[22-Dec-18 01:26 AM] agnewpickens#7393
OK, guid says to use client shutting down console.

Waiting on CLI response

[22-Dec-18 01:29 AM] agnewpickens#7393
May take a while?  I'll report back when it responds.

[22-Dec-18 01:30 AM] Hermes#6934
you are using the CLI as showed in the guide?

[22-Dec-18 01:34 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Yes, not doing anything, going to let it get to sync bar and try again.

[22-Dec-18 01:35 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Had to relaunch Agama because my computer locked up, so will wait for some connections.

[22-Dec-18 01:41 AM] Hermes#6934
strange..well after stoping it and rescanning it ...it should get passed that block

[22-Dec-18 01:54 AM] agnewpickens#7393
OK, will try that.

[22-Dec-18 01:54 AM] agnewpickens#7393

Hi, 
I've been trying to track down some KMD I lost in early December while doing a z_transaction (sendmany).
Seems it might have been given to a miner (not a wrong address)??
I'd like to find out what went on so it doesn't happen again.
Can anyone tell me what happened here?

Hey guys  do you know if there will be an  option of buying  KSB with credit cards or debit cards? Because that‚Äôs the only one thing  missing  for Komodo to be completely  independent of Bitcoin

[23-Dec-18 01:40 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Does anyone know what this means when I try and start my coin daemon?
```wallet/wallet.cpp:980: void CopyPreviousWitnesses(NoteDataMap&, int, int64_t) [with NoteDataMap = std::map<JSOutPoint, SproutNoteData>; int64_t = long int]: Assertion `(nd->witnessHeight == -1) || (nd->witnessHeight == indexHeight - 1)' failed.```

[23-Dec-18 01:44 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
My daemon is also stuck on the sapling update block

[23-Dec-18 01:53 AM] Nabob#5004
@NutellaLicka on which block your node is strucked ? KMD  ?

[23-Dec-18 01:53 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It is for PIRATE, so the 152855 block. Which is the sapling upgrade block.
```  "blocks": 152855,
  "longestchain": 0,
  "timeoffset": 0,
  "tiptime": 1544836549,

[23-Dec-18 01:54 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
should I rescan or something

[24-Dec-18 03:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is anyone around right now?

I tried updating manually (not on the machine that has a broken komodod) and got everything updated.

I launched the chain and then tried performing one simple test transaction.

It appears to be stuck, and nothing is showing up in the destination address.

[24-Dec-18 03:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I may have broken my wallet.dat file, and may need to rescan or something?

[24-Dec-18 03:45 AM] Hermes#6934
the chain is stuck? using the CLI?

[24-Dec-18 03:46 AM] Hermes#6934
if the chain stuck the transaction cannot be processed until it's 100% synced

[24-Dec-18 03:50 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I was able to get the new agama up and running.

In the transaction history, it says those are failed transactions, basically.

[24-Dec-18 03:51 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Should just reset.

[24-Dec-18 03:54 AM] Hermes#6934
try rescanning ..the wallet.dat shouldn't be affected ..

[24-Dec-18 04:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I was able to get the t addresses working through agama.

Trying the daemon again.

[24-Dec-18 04:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
See if it will let me send z's

[25-Dec-18 09:46 AM] Diesmaster#5068

Here is my contribution from the German telegram Komodo chat.
Translated with Google

Just my modest opinion: In over 25 years stock market, I have often put on the best technology. In the end, I still work today.
Most of those with the best marketing have won.
Therefore, I would not necessarily recommend today in the circle of friends to buy kmd.c
We absolutely need aggressive marketing, and very quickly. The technology and the ecosystem is absolutely great, but that does not help us if nobody is interested in investing.

@SHossain ‚òù

[27-Dec-18 03:00 PM] SHossain#0007
@lluisin @Nabob Ledger doesn't support sapling signing yet. You need to use Agama offline transaction signing method if you want to use your funds from Ledger. check this post here https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026860-komodo-sapling-upgrade-important-info-for-ledger-users

g'day could someone help me out with a speed mode deposit I made in barterdex?

[31-Dec-18 11:25 AM] ch6ris#5240
It was a deposit made on Oct 10, Can't remember how long I locked it for but can't see it in deposit history or claim deposit section.

[31-Dec-18 11:26 AM] ch6ris#5240
Can see it on the blockchain, from memory I set lock time to before the end of year.

[31-Dec-18 11:33 AM] ch6ris#5240
It's disappeared from barterdex but I can see it siting in a certain address on an explorer. Anyway to check lock time? Funds should be automatically returned?

[31-Dec-18 01:42 PM] ch6ris#5240
Yeah not sure about that. maybe that's it .

[31-Dec-18 01:43 PM] ch6ris#5240
Can't remember how long I locked the funds for.

[31-Dec-18 01:43 PM] ch6ris#5240

i have recently claimed 2 txs which was set for 1 year. my funds came back with accured rewards.

[31-Dec-18 01:43 PM] SHossain#0007

can i pleas get some help recovering wallet, seed gives mee diff address

[31-Dec-18 02:31 PM] Nabob#5004
@Walloom  you need yo make sure correct passphrase with no trailing spaces and typos

[31-Dec-18 02:32 PM] Walloom#8103
@Nabob  did it while revealing seed and typed correctly, just keeps directing to a diff wallet adress

[31-Dec-18 02:32 PM] Walloom#8103
all i did was remove encrypt

[31-Dec-18 02:34 PM] Walloom#8103
think i just lost all mu shit

[31-Dec-18 02:34 PM] Nabob#5004
so, when you login with encrypt seed, you able to see valid address ?

[31-Dec-18 02:34 PM] Walloom#8103
yes, and its the same each time, but diff when i had encrypt

[31-Dec-18 02:35 PM] Walloom#8103
same with the seed , diff when had pin

[31-Dec-18 02:36 PM] Nabob#5004
so it means you have wrong seed, if you can retrive valid address with encrypt seed please get private key first

[31-Dec-18 02:51 PM] SHossain#0007
@Walloom maybe you are using the PIN in seed box instead of the PIN box?

[31-Dec-18 04:22 PM] Walloom#8103
Nope, was reading handwriting wrong on one of seed phrase
