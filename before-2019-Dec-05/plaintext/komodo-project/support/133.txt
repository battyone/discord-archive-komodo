@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Thanks. I've done step 2 and filled out the claim form and I look forward to getting my coins back in my new address. Cheers

[08-Jun-19 07:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
We look forward to returning them! Have a good weekend 😃

Hi! I don't have hacked agama installed, so I can not check the state of my coins because wallet installation link is deleted from komodo site. May you provide a link for hacked agama wallet to me. I have only seed to open my wallet. Or tell me please how can I check my wallet with seed of hacked agama

Thankyou. I see that my balance is not moved. Shoulf I recreate my wallet or it means that everything is ok?

[08-Jun-19 07:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
As a precaution we recommend moving funds to a new address with a new seed just in case

hello, i received the dust transaction, will now transfer that to my new claim address.  only 2 assetchains got swept here though, not KMD. Should I send now anyway, right?

[08-Jun-19 08:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, follow steps here -https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident

[08-Jun-19 09:34 AM] akaneo#3021
just completed the claim form, hopefully this will solve soon...

[08-Jun-19 09:46 AM] akaneo#3021
if i provide screenshots as proof of buying and withdrawing the coins, can this speed up the claim process ?

[08-Jun-19 09:50 AM] Lennart#9331
OK i sent the dust to my new address. habe the tx saved in case

[08-Jun-19 09:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@akaneo if there is a dispute with your claim it might come in handy, but claims will be processed in in order depending on amount, when claim submitted, and whether there is a competing claim

[08-Jun-19 09:55 AM] akaneo#3021
the claim amount is aroun 350-400 splited in 4 wallets

[08-Jun-19 09:55 AM] akaneo#3021
but have proof of buying and withdrawing for all

[08-Jun-19 09:55 AM] akaneo#3021
so if needed i can provide anything you may need

[08-Jun-19 09:55 AM] akaneo#3021
thanks

[08-Jun-19 09:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
when your claim comes up you may be contacted, otherwise the process will proceed in line with https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident

[08-Jun-19 09:57 AM] boxalex#9950
Any idea when binance enables withdraws/deposits again. In the haste i have "evacuated" all my KMD to Binance right bevor they disabled the deposit. However, naturally i would like to have to stake them, hence the question, any talks with Binance when they plan to active withdraws again?

[08-Jun-19 09:57 AM] akaneo#3021
that's good news, thanks a lot

[08-Jun-19 09:58 AM] akaneo#3021
been scared of "may take months" :))

[08-Jun-19 09:59 AM] akaneo#3021
also, what will happen with the stake ? will be lost ?

[08-Jun-19 10:00 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
we're working hard to get it done as soon as possible so we can get back to working on  all the cool tech we have that is nearing release, and so the transtion to the next notray season goes smoothly as possible.

[08-Jun-19 10:03 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not 100% sure on the status of rewards acrued in the interim. Don't quote me, but it may be contributed to covering the losses of those whose funds were swept up by the hacker before we had a chance to do so. It all depends on the relative values which are yet to be determined as we go through all the claims.

[08-Jun-19 10:04 AM] akaneo#3021
ok

[08-Jun-19 10:04 AM] akaneo#3021
thats fair

[08-Jun-19 10:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
AFAIK we recovered around 90% of funds at risk

[08-Jun-19 10:04 AM] akaneo#3021
thanks for saving my coins, hopefully this wont be needed again

[08-Jun-19 10:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
no worries, thanks for patience and understanding during this unfortunate event. Rest assured we maintain a very high priority on security and the wellbeing of our community.

Hi guys. I was traveling. I came back yesterday and now I'm putting myself the part of the whole situation.
So, I already downloaded and installed "Verus Agama". Now what do I do? I enter my old password?
Do I create a new wallet?

[08-Jun-19 02:13 PM] DigitalPunk#0381
Hi Guys , need some guidance please. Hi , I may have misunderstood the claim process to get my KMD back. I received the small amount of KMD into my compromised address and proceeded to then send back the 0.0001 transactions back to the destination address where all my KMD was swept back by the team? Is this correct or was I meant to send this tx  to my new KMD address created on Verus Agama?

[08-Jun-19 02:16 PM] nirrex#2841
my funds are safe for now. but are they safe in 0.3.3a beta ? or should i still move

[08-Jun-19 02:25 PM] gcharang#6833
> meant to send this tx  to my new KMD address created on Verus Agama
@DigitalPunk

[08-Jun-19 02:27 PM] DigitalPunk#0381
Oh no ,  I did specify my new KMD address on Verus as my refund address how ever for the purposes of the refund process and TX from compromised wallet I sent this to the destination address I.e the swept destination address

[08-Jun-19 02:27 PM] DigitalPunk#0381
Should I log a support ticket for this ?

Why do I send only two addresses instead of three?

[08-Jun-19 03:00 PM] Stock Chen#2347
The three addresses:

R9JCEd6xnCxNUSpLrHEWvzPSh7CNXm7z75 (The address sending the transaction)
RF8MWcLGtvd87o2XCrnngGzUHrVpuUihgE (A compromised Address)
RWXL82m4xnBTg1kk6PuS2xekonu7oEeiJG (A marker address controlled by the team to keep track of the refund; more about it later)

[08-Jun-19 03:00 PM] Stock Chen#2347
I sent only one or two addresses.

[08-Jun-19 03:38 PM] gcharang#6833
@farl it could be there was a intermediate address and the whole thing was moved by the team, you can DM me the address if you want me to verify
or you can follow the funds one more hop to see if they reached the team wallet

Hello! My KMD were moved to a safe address and I filled out the form. I also had other asset chain coins on compromised address. I managed to move almost all of them to a new safe address except CHIPS.  I couldn't moved CHIPS at the same day because of the electrum server errors but when I  checked out again on the next day my CHIPS  disappeared. 
It's  a small amount, but still.. how can I claim them?

[08-Jun-19 04:13 PM] Deemon#2021

my recommendation for where to mine is typically "mine somewhere that is helping the ecosystem and not just the pool op's bags"
