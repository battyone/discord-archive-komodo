How do I uninstall Agama on Linux?

[21-Jul-18 10:10 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I have a bunch of files in ./opt/AgamaApp

[21-Jul-18 10:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Trying to update to the latest version

[21-Jul-18 10:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
But this old version seems different.

[21-Jul-18 10:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The new one appears to be portable.

[21-Jul-18 10:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
And self-contained?

[21-Jul-18 10:21 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I figured it out.

[21-Jul-18 10:21 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
üòÉ

[21-Jul-18 11:01 AM] SHossain#0007
`sudo /opt/AgamaApp/Uninstall-Agama`

[21-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Hermes#6934
@Bryan_Beus  in order for the for the portable to work on Linux I will suggest to put the file on the src folder

[21-Jul-18 07:42 PM] SwimedDragon#3996
Hey, when I hover over the i in my wallet, it say's somewhere ''Pay transaction fee 10000'' what does that mean?

[21-Jul-18 07:50 PM] Hermes#6934
on KMD?

[21-Jul-18 07:51 PM] Hermes#6934
thats not the cost of the transaction fee, please post a screenshot , you can send amounts of at least .01 kmd

[21-Jul-18 07:51 PM] SHossain#0007
that is 10000 satoshi which is 0.0001 KMD

[21-Jul-18 07:52 PM] SHossain#0007
or 0.00010000

[21-Jul-18 07:52 PM] SwimedDragon#3996
For Equaliser

[21-Jul-18 07:52 PM] SHossain#0007
it is the same

[21-Jul-18 07:52 PM] SwimedDragon#3996
Ok

[21-Jul-18 07:52 PM] SwimedDragon#3996
Thanks

check in bdex userdata, it has coindb folder or not, earlier bdex worked for you ?

[22-Jul-18 02:12 AM] c2k#4915
earlier versions all worked. just updated today and having this problem

[22-Jul-18 02:12 AM] c2k#4915
will watch the video and try again

[22-Jul-18 02:35 AM] c2k#4915
seems BDEX is buggy for some reason. trying to sell some JUMBLR for KMD but Manual Offer says i dont have enough JUMBLR even if i try to sell half of whats in the wallet. plenty of utxo's too.

[22-Jul-18 02:36 AM] c2k#4915
but when i try Offer Bot for the full amount the order goes out there. bizaar

[22-Jul-18 02:45 AM] Nabob#5004
it depends on utxo's of what you have to compare with bob. try hyperdex if you feel hard, its has  nice ui experience

[22-Jul-18 02:52 AM] c2k#4915
ok. i havent downloaded it yet. guess im gonna have to try

[22-Jul-18 11:22 AM] loneSilentWolf#8570
Is it possible to claim interest on coinomi?

[22-Jul-18 11:45 AM] Acura#2748
@loneSilentWolf no - but you can use the guarda kmd wallet on android for claiming

Hi there the installation of the windows version comes with some MACOSX and Linux binaries also

[22-Jul-18 09:29 PM] Hermes#6934
so some antiviruses are detecting that but that's just a false alarm , also some antiviruses are detecting crypto related software as virus... if you go to virustotal.com you won't see any alarm going off

[22-Jul-18 09:29 PM] Hermes#6934
in the next versions of the wallet those binaries will omitted  @dxer666

the link to "Komodod" seems to be broken. Is there another place to look? There was a guide to download/compile your own komodod, is that still around anywhere? @Hermes

[23-Jul-18 02:15 AM] tolken#2655
This link seems to work: https://github.com/SuperNETorg/komodo/releases/download/v1.0.8-osx-7/kmd_osx_bins.zip

@tolken  above links are not updated ones, please ignore, Agama osx version works good.

Getting an invalid deposit address notification from Cryptopia for BTX to Barter DEX - does an address that starts with "15" look right for BTX?

[26-Jul-18 04:16 AM] Nabob#5004
@agnewpickens  we have reproduced your issue,  I ll check with Our coin integration team and let you know

[26-Jul-18 04:17 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Thanks @Nabob for the quick response.

[26-Jul-18 04:37 AM] Nabob#5004
@agnewpickens  we verified with our dev, address format is ok  "1" or "2", Both formats supported by BTX, Cryptopia is not supporting another address format, Please open ticket with Cryptopia
