I can only start in lite mode

[19-Aug-18 09:17 AM] Nabob#5004
if you want to start in native mode, move contents of komodo user data folder to backup and delete everything except wallet.dat file and then relauch agama wallet

How do i get the Electrum mode to work on BarterDex Windows version? I am running Windows 10. Thanks! üòÉ

[19-Aug-18 03:59 PM] jspook16#3059
for which coin? I dont belive they all support electrum at this time

[19-Aug-18 03:59 PM] Studio 3.14#0995
Bitcoin, KMD, and Etonic

[19-Aug-18 04:00 PM] Studio 3.14#0995
Maybe I'm not understanding Electrum Mode ... Does it make BD connect remotely?

[19-Aug-18 04:00 PM] jspook16#3059
btc and kmd ....you just have to select Electrum when you enable the coin

[19-Aug-18 04:00 PM] Studio 3.14#0995
Ok I did and it's not working

[19-Aug-18 04:01 PM] Studio 3.14#0995
Says it's not available

[19-Aug-18 04:01 PM] Studio 3.14#0995
'No Electrum servers found for BTC'

[19-Aug-18 04:01 PM] jspook16#3059

Hi How to claim kmd  stake reward in windows  command line wallet?

[19-Aug-18 06:29 PM] maki#2419
Is there any special command?

[19-Aug-18 06:31 PM] Sabretooth#9097
I still can't get it to collect.

[19-Aug-18 06:31 PM] Sabretooth#9097
shepherdElectrumSendPromise error

[19-Aug-18 06:33 PM] Hermes#6934
@maki The GUI basically sends the balance to your own public address , so if you send your balance to your same public address in the CLI it will have the same effect.

[19-Aug-18 06:34 PM] maki#2419
thx so I have to send to the same address ? or Can it be new created empty address

[19-Aug-18 06:34 PM] maki#2419
??

[19-Aug-18 06:35 PM] Hermes#6934
You can send it to your same public address.

[19-Aug-18 06:36 PM] Hermes#6934
@Sabretooth We haven't experienced this with the new versions of the wallet. Please send us a support ticket with your OS specifications at support@komodoplatform.com  , also make sure your PC clock is set correctly

[19-Aug-18 06:36 PM] maki#2419
what about if it send to different new empty addresss???

[19-Aug-18 06:37 PM] maki#2419
Will it claim the reward or not ?

[19-Aug-18 06:39 PM] maki#2419
you wrote I can send but the question is I can or I have to send to the same address to claim reward?

[19-Aug-18 06:42 PM] Hermes#6934
you need to send it to the same address to claim the reward this is a network rule

[19-Aug-18 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
not true

[19-Aug-18 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it can be sent to any address

[19-Aug-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
just spending the utxo automatically creates the reward, which goes into change

[19-Aug-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
plz update knowledge base or whereever that has the wrong info about having to send to the same address

[19-Aug-18 06:46 PM] maki#2419
so where the reward  is sent to the old or new address?

[19-Aug-18 06:47 PM] Hermes#6934
if it's on your same wallet as JL mentions this won't have any effect you could do it in either

[19-Aug-18 06:47 PM] maki#2419
asking becouse I have just one chance üòÉ

[19-Aug-18 06:49 PM] Hermes#6934
the reward claiming feature will work in any wallet where you have your private keys ...so in this case for the CLI you are good to go and use a new address or the old address as you refer.

[19-Aug-18 06:51 PM] maki#2419
ok thanks for your help

[19-Aug-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the reward ends up as change

[19-Aug-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the reward ends up as change

[19-Aug-18 06:53 PM] maki#2419
So it wil stay in address "A" as I good understand

[19-Aug-18 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
depends on how you are setup with SPV or native or native with -pubkey, regardless it will be in your wallet

[19-Aug-18 06:55 PM] maki#2419
ok thans again

[19-Aug-18 06:59 PM] Hermes#6934
We recommend using the SPV version of the GUI wallet to claim rewards is user friendlier and it will send the reward to your same public address.

[19-Aug-18 06:59 PM] Hermes#6934
but if you are in native mode you just have to verify the change addresses that are created.

[19-Aug-18 07:05 PM] maki#2419
have a problem with agama in native mode . All blocks are dowloaded but it still report "please wait activating best chain" it take hours

[19-Aug-18 07:06 PM] Hermes#6934
All blocks are downloaded ? but still shows activating best chain?

[19-Aug-18 07:07 PM] Hermes#6934
please send us a screenshot

[19-Aug-18 07:08 PM] maki#2419
blocks are dowloaded through command line windows wallet so maybe that's the issue

[19-Aug-18 07:09 PM] Hermes#6934
you are in the CLI right?

[19-Aug-18 07:09 PM] Hermes#6934
well that shouldn't happen try the command getinfo to see if you are on the latest block

[19-Aug-18 07:10 PM] Hermes#6934
./komodo-cli getinfo

[19-Aug-18 07:16 PM] maki#2419
woring with windows agama 0241 what the right command format

[19-Aug-18 07:16 PM] maki#2419
k

[19-Aug-18 07:19 PM] maki#2419
got message 9 agama) unable to establish rpc connection

[19-Aug-18 07:19 PM] Hermes#6934
the right command ? and you have komodod still running in the background check task manager

[19-Aug-18 07:19 PM] Hermes#6934
you are having komodod running in the CLI and in Agama at the same time?

[19-Aug-18 07:20 PM] Hermes#6934
if that's the case that could be the issue.

[19-Aug-18 07:20 PM] maki#2419
komodod.exe is runing

[19-Aug-18 07:20 PM] Hermes#6934
I will suggest to shut down Agama and make sure the CLI is not running by doing ./komodo-cli stop

[19-Aug-18 07:20 PM] Hermes#6934
and restart Agama again

[19-Aug-18 07:26 PM] maki#2419
I did it. The same problem. During agama starts up komodo in native mode komodod.exe also starts but it is as it should be I think

[19-Aug-18 07:27 PM] maki#2419
but  komodo command line client works well

[19-Aug-18 07:33 PM] Hermes#6934
