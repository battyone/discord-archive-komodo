@LeshAft9 I'm not sure about any issues with non-kmd coins but the chainzilla asset and Komodo coin work great on Magnum when using Ledger

[03-Apr-19 05:28 PM] LeshAft9#0083
OK. there just wasn't any button (that I could find) to have the ledger nano s device do the Confirm Address operation so you can be sure what the web wallet shows you is true

[03-Apr-19 05:29 PM] LeshAft9#0083
I haven't tried with KMD though, I'll give it a try at some point

[03-Apr-19 06:02 PM] PTYX#6840
I'll point the issue you explained to them. Maybe they already fixed it and it's something I don't know about.

[03-Apr-19 10:27 PM] CrisF#3405
FYI:  Hi, back in December I managed to loose some KMD.  After all of this time I've finally figured out what I did.
Posting so hopefully others won't make the same mistake, and to make it easier for support if someone comes in with a similar problem.
At the time I was consolidating funds to send.  Using `z_sendmany` and `z_mergetoaddress`.
On one of the `z_mergetoaddress`es I put an amount at the end of the command, as I had been doing for `z_sendmany`.
Unfortunately, in  this case, a number at the end of `z_mergetoaddress` is the miners fee ü§¶ 
Not a good idea to rush through things and get complacent!

Please don't make the same mistake I did!

[03-Apr-19 10:44 PM] Alright#0419
@CrisF that tx has a normal tx fee

[03-Apr-19 10:47 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, Might have put up the wrong tx?  Will check when back.  Isn't that the 300kmd miners fee one?

[03-Apr-19 10:51 PM] Alright#0419
that is 299.9999 being sent to a z address as far as I can tell

[04-Apr-19 04:57 AM] ferv#4210
Can someone help me, I have my KMD on the blue ledger and has more than 2 months that is not working not updates nothing , what can I donor when this issue will be resolve? Thanks in advance

[04-Apr-19 08:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@ferv not sure what the exact issue is, but might be worth talking to Ledger support.
To recover your KMD, you can use the seed phrase to import into Agama Native Mode.

On blue ledger is not working

no seed phrsae on ledger?

[04-Apr-19 12:16 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
didnt you have to enter 24 words to set it up?

[04-Apr-19 12:16 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
did you write the 24 words down?

hi again! i am working with some js lib which is supposed to validate addresses and i am very curious where did they found out about those prefixes for mainnet and testnet (https://github.com/christsim/multicoin-address-validator/blob/master/src/currencies.js#L103-L108)? i cannot find that anywhere in source code...

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator cool thx

[06-Apr-19 12:30 PM] Jurjen#9294
Hi all. What would be a good channel for reporting a failure in the KSB website?

[06-Apr-19 05:14 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
@Jurjen https://discord.gg/s7kVaTa

[06-Apr-19 05:56 PM] Jurjen#9294
@CryptoNinjaa lol. I asked the same question there in General channel, and told me to go here

[06-Apr-19 05:56 PM] Jurjen#9294
I asked there before going here

[06-Apr-19 05:57 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
what is the website link

[06-Apr-19 05:58 PM] Jurjen#9294
https://ksb.money

{Embed}
https://ksb.money
Home - KSB

[06-Apr-19 05:59 PM] Jurjen#9294
My feedback is that there is a YouTube video there with the link to www.ksb.money, but that one is not resolving / redirected

[06-Apr-19 05:59 PM] Jurjen#9294
So only works without www

[06-Apr-19 06:00 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
That is their website so would be best reporterd on their discord lol. But i will pass it on also

[06-Apr-19 06:01 PM] Jurjen#9294
Did you found a link on their site to discord or so? I didn't, only links in the footer to crypto union and komodo. But maybe I did missed it

[06-Apr-19 06:03 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I was already memebr on their discord, But if you click the ocrypto union logo at bottom it takes you to the ocryptounion main site where there is a discord link

[06-Apr-19 06:03 PM] Jurjen#9294
Yes, but that is the crypto union discord right?

[06-Apr-19 10:36 PM] Jurjen#9294
@Crabby Paddy If you can also pass feedback that it is hard to find contact details? I would suggest to add a link in the footer to discord and a channel for KSB or so üòÉ Btw is there already one? I like to join if so.

[06-Apr-19 11:30 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Jurjen ksb is apart of ocryptounion so the discord there would be the place to discuss anything related! There is the ksb assetchain channel which is pretty empty at the moment. 

Once dex launches and we start doing the crypto loans it should be updated!

[06-Apr-19 11:34 PM] Jurjen#9294
@Crabby Paddy Thanks, found it

[07-Apr-19 04:53 PM] Terran#7829
Hi, I just logged onto my Agama wallet for the first time in like 6 months, and all my KMD is gone. And the wallet says there is no history transactions. It also says it can't connect to a server? Does it show "0" KMD balance because it needs to connect, or I need to update the Agama wallet? OR have I just been straight up robbed

[07-Apr-19 04:55 PM] SHossain#0007
which Agama version you are using @Terran ?

[07-Apr-19 04:55 PM] SHossain#0007
use the latest version 0.3.4 from here https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets

version v.0.2.06c-beta

[07-Apr-19 06:39 PM] SHossain#0007
you must upgrade. use the link above

[07-Apr-19 06:40 PM] Terran#7829
ok, thanks. Will that give me my coins back?

[07-Apr-19 06:41 PM] SHossain#0007
your coins are not lost.

[07-Apr-19 06:42 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, you will get them back as long as you update and use the seed that generates your address with funds

[07-Apr-19 06:43 PM] Terran#7829
that's a huge relief, I'm downloading it now. I hope I do! Thanks

[07-Apr-19 06:51 PM] Terran#7829
does it matter if I download the new version of agama on a different computer and use the seed to get onto my account?

[07-Apr-19 06:52 PM] SHossain#0007
nope, it doesn't matter. you can use any computer or a mobile device. same seed will aways bring same address and the funds in it

[07-Apr-19 06:55 PM] Terran#7829
ok I just used my seed to log on, and it still says 0 balance.. and with no transaction history.. I don't know what the hell is going on :/

[07-Apr-19 06:56 PM] SHossain#0007
does the displayed address matches with the one you had funds in?

[07-Apr-19 06:58 PM] Terran#7829
I never wrote down the public address of the wallet .. I only wrote down the seed

[07-Apr-19 07:00 PM] SHossain#0007
if you change the seed, even a single word or space mismatch, you will get differnet address

[07-Apr-19 07:00 PM] SHossain#0007
different address means your funds are not there

[07-Apr-19 07:00 PM] SHossain#0007
you should check your seed and the source of your funding.

i got on, I must have not been typing the seed exactly correctly. thank you for your help

[07-Apr-19 07:10 PM] SHossain#0007
nice to hear. do you see your balance now?

[07-Apr-19 07:10 PM] SHossain#0007
