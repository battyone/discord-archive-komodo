[19-Oct-18 06:17 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
Still the same problem for me

[19-Oct-18 06:19 PM] Hermes#6934
@TL  Go to the settings tab > select CLI option > Pirate and type getinfo and press execute ...see there if you have loaded any blocks as in this image

say wrong cli string format

[19-Oct-18 06:20 PM] Hermes#6934
@stephenleeholmes118  Did you verified if you had the Zcash params folder inside the %appdata% folder?

[19-Oct-18 06:21 PM] Hermes#6934
Did you pressed enter after typing getinfo? if so don't press enter you will just need to press execute after typing this

[19-Oct-18 06:21 PM] TL#0937
yes execute button

[19-Oct-18 06:22 PM] Hermes#6934
if the issue persists , shut down the wallet as showed in this guide https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024522-how-to-shut-down-agama-native-mode-to-avoid-corrupted-data

[19-Oct-18 06:25 PM] Hermes#6934
If that doesn't help it could be that some blocks got corrupted you will need to enter the Pirate folder and erase the blocks and chainstate files and resync from scractch as showed in this guide https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024513-agama-windows-guide-how-to-resync-from-scratch

[19-Oct-18 06:26 PM] Hermes#6934
You do the same procedure showed here but inside the Pirate folder , you enter the same Komodo Folder and then you should see the Pirate native file folder , inside this folder you will see the blocks and chainstate corresponding to Pirate

[19-Oct-18 06:26 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
I don't have the %appdata% it says file name not found

[19-Oct-18 06:29 PM] Hermes#6934
You should be able to see this folder , that's a path you need to put this path in the search tab in your file explorer see the guide above it shows how to access it

[19-Oct-18 06:30 PM] Hermes#6934
In the guide that shows how to resync from scratch it also shows how to access the %appdata% folder , that's the folder where your programs userdata is stored

[19-Oct-18 06:31 PM] Hermes#6934
every Windows have it, maybe yours could be hidden...after you find that erase the Zcashparams folder and try downloading them again...to see if this time they work correctly.

[19-Oct-18 06:34 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
I will have a look when it's had a go at downloading the keys again this time it's taking longer then the 30seconds it took last time

[19-Oct-18 06:37 PM] Hermes#6934
that's maybe the reason the zcash keys download is longer than 30 seconds...

[19-Oct-18 06:38 PM] Hermes#6934
so it could be that the download got interrupted

well I lost 850+ kmd that I‚Äôve been accumulating for a year lol. cool. thanks for the help that u guys could offer.

[19-Oct-18 07:41 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
Do I have to wait for it to download the chain before adding pirate arrr

[19-Oct-18 07:46 PM] Hermes#6934
You can launch Pirate without launching Komodo

[19-Oct-18 07:59 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
How do o launch pirate

[19-Oct-18 08:00 PM] Hermes#6934
You need first this version of the wallet https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama/releases/tag/multios-0.2.42c

In the drop down menu after you select Activate coin you choose Pirate and launch it in Native mode.

[19-Oct-18 08:06 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884

Can eos be put into the agama wallet?

[19-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Hermes#6934
that would have to be asked to Pbca

[19-Oct-18 10:34 PM] SHossain#0007
Agama currently doesn't support ETH/ERC20 tokens

[19-Oct-18 10:37 PM] Vertigo#0439
Noob question is native wallet any safer than fast?

[19-Oct-18 10:47 PM] Vertigo#0439
Than fast wallet

[19-Oct-18 10:47 PM] Hermes#6934
Both wallets are equally safe , it depends on which one fits you better, if you want a fast approach entering your wallet will recommend Lite mode it doesn't need to load the complete blockchain but still I think every user should always read the precautions of this mode. For instance before sending any type of transaction to the wallet the best practice is to get a pin password for the wallet and most importantly save your seed and verify you wrote it right by entering the wallet with it at least 3 times and finally but not least important saving your private key generated for your specific address depeding on the coin you are using. Here is a good start to learn more about how Agama Lite mode and Native work. Here is a guide for you see regarding lite mode. in a video https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024481-how-to-install-agama-windows-

[19-Oct-18 10:48 PM] Hermes#6934
And also here is a little article regarding the difference each mode https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024425-difference-between-native-and-lite-mode

[19-Oct-18 10:52 PM] Hermes#6934
I am not suggesting that one is safer than the other because in native mode you have all of your private keys stored in your computer and as long as your computer is working and have your files intact you won't loose your funds an even though if that happen you can always save your private keys of the addresses that hold your assets as back up or the wallet.dat file . The only way  that it could problematic for native or  lite mode  is if your computer or  enviorment gets compromised  ... so is a matter of choosing what fits you best at the end

[19-Oct-18 11:48 PM] sir#6225
Hey @Hermes  I appreciate your assistance yesterday, but I still couldn't connect to the Agama v0.2.41d wallet on KMD Native mode. Tried to delete chainstate, blocks, peers.dat, and restart and it didnt work. I was unable to see the komododod or komodoconf (I forget what the name of the background process is) in the task manager. 

Is there anything else I can try at this point? I have searched through all the guides pertaining to this issue online and haven't . I am nervous about my KMD holdings

[19-Oct-18 11:50 PM] Hermes#6934
You already checked if any Antivirus or Firewall could be blocking komodod process?

[19-Oct-18 11:50 PM] sir#6225
Yes, I disabled all AV

[19-Oct-18 11:50 PM] sir#6225
I have had no issues connecting to Native for over 9 months

[19-Oct-18 11:51 PM] sir#6225
I just bought a new laptop, is there anyway I can try to " import" the wallet.dat and run KMD on native on the new machine

[19-Oct-18 11:54 PM] Hermes#6934
go again to www.komodoplatform.com and download the new version of the wallet 2.42.c  , and also if you can please send me a screnshot of the error, if you are going to use a new machine the only thing that you need to do is storing the wallet.dat file in the userdata or %appdata%Roaming/Komodo Folder in the machine and when you run the native mode it will recognize the wallet.dat and show tour addressses. Do this only when Agama is shut down .

if you are referring to pirate chain, make sure you have enough ram available while sending z transaction

Did you try to send funds In small chunks, If you are mining Pirate chain, Like suppose 10 or less
While sending Transactions may be chain struck with Low memory allocation, It may fix some times increasing swap space a little on your host system

Hi! I have some questions regarding BarterDex and Hyperdex on Komodo. 
1. Do you support order books?
2. Do you support market-orders?
3. Do you support limit orders?

[21-Oct-18 11:25 AM] mikeey89#0543
4. Why is my order books empty on both platforms?

[21-Oct-18 11:39 AM] mikeey89#0543
@jl777c :)

[21-Oct-18 12:14 PM] Nabob#5004
order books/market orders  will be displayed in some time, where bids and asks will be updated,

[21-Oct-18 12:16 PM] Nabob#5004
limit orders/ good till cancelled  orders are live untill users cancelled or  order maches. this feature is default  on hyperdex

[21-Oct-18 12:38 PM] mikeey89#0543
Why is mine empty on all pairs?

[21-Oct-18 12:48 PM] Nabob#5004
barterDEX/hyperdex uses a broadcast protocol so all nodes know about all offers in realtime.
it is broadcast to all that are online (via redundant relay nodes whose sole purpose is to relay orders)

[21-Oct-18 12:50 PM] Nabob#5004
On which platform you are looking for your order . ?

[21-Oct-18 12:54 PM] mikeey89#0543
Tried both

[21-Oct-18 12:56 PM] mikeey89#0543
Komodo will never work if it is so hard to use

Hello, I am struggling to get Agama synced properly on KMD Native mode. 

I was originally running 0.2.41d and got the RPC connection error when trying to sync. Before attempting to sync on 10/18, I had a backup version of my wallet.dat from the previous time I had opened agama approximately 2 weeks before. This is the last time my Agama was working properly in Native. 

Since 10/18 I have not been able to successfully sync, and so far I have tried:

Uninstall agama and reinstall - Stuck

[21-Oct-18 02:05 PM] sir#6225
I have tried:
Deleting chainstate, blocks, and peers.dat and rerunning
Disabling AV & Firewall
Updating to 0.2.42c

[21-Oct-18 02:06 PM] sir#6225
Nothing seems to work - is there anyone who can help?

[21-Oct-18 02:09 PM] Nabob#5004
Please let us know on which OS version  you are on ?
