Okay well my Komodo balance shows (I it was swept)  in lite mode... but when I try to access pirate:

Synchronization begins .... is it still linked to my previous pirate account or do i need to replace the wallet.dat I pulled out from the old Agama pirate?

[10-Jun-19 08:35 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
there is a pirate folder inside komodo folder

[10-Jun-19 08:35 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the wallet.dat inside the pirate is for pirate

[10-Jun-19 08:36 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the wallet.dat in komod is for komodo

[10-Jun-19 08:36 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@Mguta agama was design so that even if you enter wrong seed, you can still log in but end up in different address

[10-Jun-19 08:38 PM] MGuta#6164
i understand , but when you are adding the right "Seed" when you finish typing the wallet is showing on the right side one green button named "iguana"

[10-Jun-19 08:38 PM] MGuta#6164
because of that i'

[10-Jun-19 08:39 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
even wrong seed will show that

[10-Jun-19 08:42 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
Do I put the Pirate wallet.dat in Komodo/Pirate/index ?

[10-Jun-19 08:43 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477

Gordon, so i have log into my old agama wallet which is presenting no transaction history, then i have downloaded the newer version and log into with my seed and is still presenting no transaction history ... can this be just an error ?

[10-Jun-19 09:01 PM] MGuta#6164

[10-Jun-19 09:34 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Assets refunds processing will start after KMD refunds process is mostly completed

[10-Jun-19 09:35 PM] jajabanks#1894

[10-Jun-19 09:49 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Keep getting this error on my AWS EC2 VPS instance.

Any ideas? I increased SSD memory to 16GB, and there's nothing else on this VPS but komodo.

```
Error: Out of memory. Terminating.
terminate called without an active exception
```

[10-Jun-19 09:54 PM] PHBA2061#2530
it's probably out of RAM memory, not storage memory, what is your VPS RAM memory ?

[10-Jun-19 10:12 PM] TonyL#3577
`Error: Out of memory. Terminating.` means you out of RAM. Try to encrease swap (or directly amount of RAM)

[10-Jun-19 10:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, trying. Thank you.

hello, my kmd refunded, but btc no. when btc will be added to balance?

[10-Jun-19 10:36 PM] Crypt0Fin#6366
I think the BTC is listed in another address did you give them the address in the form?

[10-Jun-19 10:37 PM] Crypt0Fin#6366
I wonder if they are doing these in batches? I haven't gotten my KMD refunded

[10-Jun-19 10:37 PM] Crypt0Fin#6366
yet

[10-Jun-19 10:37 PM] Crypt0Fin#6366
I had a bunch assets but I think I had them all under the same KMD address

hi, quick question when I create new wallet in the verus agama, do I register or create QR code? What‚Äôs the difference and is there a link to komodo support that explains new wallet set up?

[11-Jun-19 12:58 AM] private guy#0631
what‚Äôs the QR code used for?

[11-Jun-19 01:16 AM] private guy#0631
i found a walk thru on the Komodo Platform but it is visually different

[11-Jun-19 02:02 AM] slr13#5979
I followed the steps and submitted the claim form, but I uninstalled old agama wallet so now I don't know how to send test transaction from the old wallet to the verus agama new wallet.. will I still receive the funds to new uncompromised verus agama address?

[11-Jun-19 02:07 AM] private guy#0631
@slr13  hey slr13f, did u create a new verus agama wallet, u hit register right? do u know what the QR code is about?

[11-Jun-19 02:09 AM] slr13#5979
I did not mess with the QR code-- just followed instructions here--  https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029948-create-new-address-in-lite-mode-with-verus-agama

How can i know if it is all ok with my form and my refund?

[11-Jun-19 03:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Using the RICK asset chain.

Trying to use the `getfaucet` command from the Faucet module.

The hex transaction is created fine.

When I try to do sendrawtransaction, I get this error.

```
error code: -26
error message:
16: tx-overwinter-expired
```

Any idea what's happening here?

[11-Jun-19 03:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@slr13  you can use your old seed in the new wallet and send to your new address

[11-Jun-19 03:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Bryan_Beus  that‚Äôs a zec issue probably best to ask duke

@dukeleto 

any ideas on the above ^

[11-Jun-19 04:01 AM] jenkie#5011
saw a tweet that said all refunds under 17k KMD were processed, which mine would count under, yet nothing so far

[11-Jun-19 04:13 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@jenkie  did you send the dust transaction to the new address

[11-Jun-19 04:13 AM] jenkie#5011
no, my old agama wallet isn't connecting to servers now.

[11-Jun-19 04:14 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You can use your old seed in the Verus Agama

[11-Jun-19 04:14 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You should uninstall the Komodo one

[11-Jun-19 04:14 AM] jenkie#5011
oh, nice, let me try

[11-Jun-19 04:18 AM] jenkie#5011
so I used my old key, but now I can't see my new address lol, sorry. can I even have two diff KMD addresses in same wallet?

[11-Jun-19 04:19 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes

[11-Jun-19 04:20 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lite mode is just one address at a time . So logon new addy copy the new address , load  the old address, send to new address. Log off done

[11-Jun-19 04:21 AM] jenkie#5011
gotcha

[11-Jun-19 04:23 AM] angrygnat#7242

@angrygnat  if you filled in the form and sent your dust transactions  it should be processed within the next batch unless it is contested

[11-Jun-19 04:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just wait for now, if it is not back to you in a day or two,  it likely means it is contested.

if your Pirate address was in the compromised list due to the Agama vulnerability it was most likely swept to safety
please fill in the claim form below ASAP so that we can start the process of returning the funds to their rightful owners
as soon as we have that information i'll post the validation procedure and start processing the claims

please use an address to which you have the keys (not an exchange address)
