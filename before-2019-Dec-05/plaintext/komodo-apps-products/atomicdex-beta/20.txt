@Oszy I do not know if the devs are in here. Saw Komodo posted the Discord in reddit so had to give this a shot.

[17-Jul-19 08:20 PM] Oszy#5734
@MegaManEXE316 there is only a few people out of the 1000 registered allowed to test right now but I am sure someone will check it for you.

[17-Jul-19 08:22 PM] MegaManEXE316#1166
@Oszy Do you know for the people that registered for the beta it will go by waves. Meaning 100 people one day, then 100 another day?

[17-Jul-19 08:22 PM] MegaManEXE316#1166
waves?*

[17-Jul-19 08:22 PM] t0sma#0368
@allbits I still have the issue. How do you fix it?

[17-Jul-19 08:28 PM] Oszy#5734
I don't know exact numbers or the process @MegaManEXE316

[17-Jul-19 08:29 PM] MegaManEXE316#1166
@Oszy Oh okay.

[17-Jul-19 08:32 PM] allbits#5898
I did a "clear data" for the app in settings > apps > atomicdex.  Very important to back up your seed before you do this!!!!

[17-Jul-19 08:39 PM] Oszy#5734
well you pretty much can't start using the app without saving your seed anyway

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #20 NoSuchMethodError: The getter 'coin' was called on null\.
I kept trying to put my full amount of Rick up for swap
Enter details for initial swap amounts
Proceed to next screen
Go back
This allows you to enter a coin amount on the first line without selecting a coin
You can‚Äôt do this the first go around
You must first select a coin
But after you back up from the next step you can
Amount on first line with no coin selected
Hit the select coin on second line

@SHossain it is indeed so that even when in 2/3 you can‚Äôt close the app in iOS. You can however browse around in atomicDEX so not needed to stay on the swap screen. 

When the news page will be activated, that will be the perfect time killer üíö

Yo guys, I registered for the beta with an email address that wasn't associated with Google Play Store. I've updated the email address to one that is on the play store. How/when can I get access to the app?

[17-Jul-19 09:47 PM] Mewnzter#0237
The wallet doesn¬¥t just take any ERC20 tokens, right? You need to add support for each one we should be able to deposit?

with improvements and new features it can be a killer to every CEX

Put a fiat on-ramp straight into this and there is literally no need for CEX anymore

[17-Jul-19 10:29 PM] Malti#3948
Is that a possibility? If someone  created a legit fiat exchange, but also an immediate send to a self controlled wallet? (Basically you sell it as an automated wallet deposit and government can‚Äôt really block it?)

[17-Jul-19 10:29 PM] Malti#3948

[17-Jul-19 10:41 PM] Malti#3948
@SHossain by the way. With all this fuzz. I would create a landing page with a google form for people to put their mail address if they want to be notified by mail if the app goes live to the general public. Would be good to measure future adoption imo + bigger distribution channel once live

[17-Jul-19 10:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Malti  already have it lined up for wire ,  looking into CC

@allbits you mean unistall and everything

[17-Jul-19 11:04 PM] allbits#5898
No. On your Android phone go to settings > apps > atomicdex > storage and hit the "clear data" button

[17-Jul-19 11:04 PM] allbits#5898
Make sure you have you seed backed up before you do that

[17-Jul-19 11:04 PM] 27aume#8635
Ok I'll try this

[17-Jul-19 11:09 PM] allbits#5898
I sent them a log, and they say they've identified the issue and are working on it. The reset is just a workaround for now.
