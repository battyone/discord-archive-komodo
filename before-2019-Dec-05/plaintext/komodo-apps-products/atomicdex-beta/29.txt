Just performed several swaps on AtomicDex. Huge Bravo to the KMD team ! Excellent app !

[20-Jul-19 07:16 PM] Mewnzter#0237
Can someone help me install again after updating to the broken version and now uninstalling?

[20-Jul-19 07:26 PM] ca333#0118
@Mewnzter uninstall the app and reinstall it from the playstore

[20-Jul-19 07:26 PM] SvetJordanov#9163

I have a feature to propose  for github:
From trade history>in a trade detail, add repeat/retry trade. 
It would bring you to make a swap with the 2 asset selected and amounts entered.

Just starting and have a small issue... Grabbed 7.777 Rick from the faucet then tried to kick off a swap 1 Rick for 0.5 Morty. It eventually timed out and is showing 0 confirmation for both the 7.777tx and the initial tx for the swap. If I look for the txs on the explorer it they are not there but if i go back to the faucet it says I've had enough.

[20-Jul-19 07:51 PM] mrflibble#5320
I have successfully completed a swap 1 Morty for 0.5 Rick so it is working for me.

[20-Jul-19 07:51 PM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
Dude Atomic Dex is addicting ðŸ”¥

[20-Jul-19 07:52 PM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
The simplicity of doing swaps is next level

[20-Jul-19 07:53 PM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
@ca333 thank u for the invite

[20-Jul-19 07:53 PM] Mewnzter#0237
Thanks, I'm back successfully swapping again!  @ca333

[20-Jul-19 08:21 PM] Simon#6247
@Oszy Had the same problem, wait for Eth TXâ€™s to sync. Afaik, eth to vrsc swaps donâ€™t work atm

If someone knows how to import trade history manualy on android.
Is it possible to make a little step by step

[20-Jul-19 08:41 PM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
How long does the trade is active ? Its been over 1hr since i placed an order, what will happen if the   order is not matched lets say i placed a trade for some xyz coin at 0.00100 sats but never got processed as the price of the coin went up to 0.00101 and that never goes back to 0.00100 sat price

How can one get his coins back ? That he placed for trade ?

[20-Jul-19 10:06 PM] Oszy#5734
