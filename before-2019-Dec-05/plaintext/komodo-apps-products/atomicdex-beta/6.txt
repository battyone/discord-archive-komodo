thanks @SHossain 👍

@27aume it's not clear now tbh why application not starting on your phone. It's noted https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX/issues/3
If you have another Android phone - please try on it

@SHossain Screen Zoom made no difference, it was all about the font size.

[16-Jul-19 02:08 AM] yorklab#7270
I experimented with both

[16-Jul-19 02:09 AM] SHossain#0007
both reproduces for me

[16-Jul-19 02:09 AM] 27aume#8635
@TonyL yes thanks im on the github issue page ill add details if I figure it out.

[16-Jul-19 02:09 AM] TonyL#3577
thank you!

[16-Jul-19 02:10 AM] TonyL#3577
if you're familiar with such android logging tool as `adb logcat` it would be great if you collect logs @27aume

@SHossain Screen Zoom made a difference when the keyboard came up but not with the "Create an order" pop-up. Either way we now know how to fix it.

Nice deal

[16-Jul-19 02:13 AM] TonyL#3577
@nymkappa there is no KMD->BTC orders at the moment so it should be just a visual issue

{Reactions}
👌 

[16-Jul-19 02:13 AM] SHossain#0007
or maybe someone wanted to sell 5 KMD for 1 BTC

[16-Jul-19 02:13 AM] SHossain#0007
we do not control orderbook

[16-Jul-19 02:14 AM] rainbro7#4735
Quick, make the trade

[16-Jul-19 02:14 AM] rainbro7#4735
😂

[16-Jul-19 02:14 AM] SHossain#0007
do not trade BTC, it's expensive. at least not at this stage

[16-Jul-19 02:14 AM] TonyL#3577
`or maybe someone wanted to sell 5 KMD for 1 BTC` no I dont think so - I think I got it, when there is no orders - it printing my input to sell and receive fields app printing it as a best availiable rate

[16-Jul-19 02:15 AM] TonyL#3577
I can consider it as a thin feature even - there is no orders on market so technically best rate now is in my mind / my phone screen  😃

[16-Jul-19 02:15 AM] rainbro7#4735
Ohh a bug

{Reactions}
🐞 

[16-Jul-19 02:16 AM] TonyL#3577
And when you "Click to create an order" it's order creation actually (you'll act as a maker)

[16-Jul-19 02:16 AM] TonyL#3577
So can set any price

[16-Jul-19 02:16 AM] TonyL#3577
and it'll be the best rate (because no other orders on market)

[16-Jul-19 02:16 AM] nymkappa#9440
Right @TonyL it displays the rate you are about to request

[16-Jul-19 02:16 AM] nymkappa#9440
A bit confusing naming I think

[16-Jul-19 02:17 AM] rainbro7#4735
Yes, change wording

[16-Jul-19 02:17 AM] nymkappa#9440
I made a swap order for KMDBTC at 0.000205 . Could not make real price because of the 0.00777 minimum. Why is that by the way? Thats too much!

[16-Jul-19 02:18 AM] TonyL#3577
It's mm2 protocol limitation (same for all coins)

[16-Jul-19 02:18 AM] SHossain#0007
what's the KMD > BTC price now in atomicDEX?

[16-Jul-19 02:18 AM] nymkappa#9440
But thats quite a big amount...

[16-Jul-19 02:19 AM] nymkappa#9440
Imagine I want to buy something with a game oriented asset. I want to swap my BTC for 10 USD (which is a correct amou t for gaming purpose). I cant :/

[16-Jul-19 02:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Fees in BTC are huge so there is no practical reasons to trade little amount, also taker have to pay fee which may not pass because of the dust limit

[16-Jul-19 02:20 AM] nymkappa#9440
Its like steam asking to deposit minimum 50 USD in your wallet.

[16-Jul-19 02:20 AM] TonyL#3577
There are reasons behind it

[16-Jul-19 02:20 AM] nymkappa#9440
Ah yeah I forgot about BTC fees. Swap on ligthning network soon?

[16-Jul-19 02:20 AM] Mark81#4505
How to download if still showing g registered?

[16-Jul-19 02:20 AM] nymkappa#9440
😋

[16-Jul-19 02:21 AM] TonyL#3577
`what's the KMD > BTC price now in atomicDEX?` there are no orders for it atm

[16-Jul-19 02:21 AM] nymkappa#9440
Would be nice if we can choose the fees to pay as well for the swap.

[16-Jul-19 02:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` I want to swap my BTC for 10 USD`
you're paying 13% in tx fees just for the chain 🤷🏽

[16-Jul-19 02:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain is that normal that I can't see no orders in order book as it's just beta test?

[16-Jul-19 02:21 AM] nymkappa#9440
There is one @TonyL

I tested RICK/MORTY pair to successful trade 😃

[16-Jul-19 02:21 AM] nymkappa#9440
0.000205 BTC / KMD

[16-Jul-19 02:22 AM] TonyL#3577
hehe, doesnt look like a good rate for buyer 😃

[16-Jul-19 02:22 AM] nymkappa#9440
Sorry for the huge premium haha got owned by Bitcoin limitation

[16-Jul-19 02:22 AM] SHossain#0007
@grewalsatinder you can't see orderbook on atomicDEX. need CLI for that

[16-Jul-19 02:22 AM] nymkappa#9440
I need to deposit more. But if its fails I'm screwed hahah

[16-Jul-19 02:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, thanks for clearing 👍

[16-Jul-19 02:23 AM] nymkappa#9440
Let's say its my insurance 😂

[16-Jul-19 02:23 AM] TonyL#3577
orderbook displaying in a next releases todo list

[16-Jul-19 02:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will it be visible on mobile atomicDEX in future? @SHossain

[16-Jul-19 02:23 AM] SHossain#0007
Tony just answered. yes, in the future 😃

[16-Jul-19 02:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
ah yes... shuffling between tabs... missed it... 😅 clearer @TonyL 😉

[16-Jul-19 02:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you don't want to pay large BTC fees, don't use BTC

[16-Jul-19 02:24 AM] TonyL#3577
BTC kinda instrument for value storage in my understanding

[16-Jul-19 02:24 AM] TonyL#3577
definetly not for 100$ trades

[16-Jul-19 02:27 AM] nymkappa#9440
Why cant I create an order when there are already some pending in the order book?

[16-Jul-19 02:27 AM] nymkappa#9440
If I want a custom rate how do I do?

[16-Jul-19 02:28 AM] yorklab#7270
I was about to ask the same.

[16-Jul-19 02:28 AM] yorklab#7270
Have to take best rate already there it seems.

[16-Jul-19 02:28 AM] SHossain#0007
maybe in a future version

[16-Jul-19 02:29 AM] nymkappa#9440
But that basically make the DEX unusuable?

[16-Jul-19 02:29 AM] nymkappa#9440
If I put a stupid rate then the whole DEX is locked

[16-Jul-19 02:29 AM] nymkappa#9440
I can set an order of 1 KMD for 1000 BTC and no one will ever fill it

[16-Jul-19 02:30 AM] nymkappa#9440
And since you cant make a custom rate then its done

[16-Jul-19 02:30 AM] TonyL#3577
@27aume I think I reproduced your problem (happened on my side after I used Google play "update" feature). Can you try to delete app and install again? (just be sure that you saved passphrase)

{Reactions}
👍 

[16-Jul-19 02:31 AM] 27aume#8635
Will do

[16-Jul-19 02:32 AM] TonyL#3577
@nymkappa it's just GUI interface for mm2 protocol - and it's a temporary limitation. CLI nodes are able to create orders with any rate at the moment so on this stage CLI nodes acting as a main market makers

[16-Jul-19 02:32 AM] TonyL#3577
It's just temporary interface limitation

[16-Jul-19 02:32 AM] nymkappa#9440
Okay. Do we have access to it?

You should fix this issue asap because I can basically shut down the full testing phase right now

[16-Jul-19 02:34 AM] allbits#5898
Did two swaps simultaneously. Delicious

[16-Jul-19 02:34 AM] nymkappa#9440
Just by creating ridiculous order

[16-Jul-19 02:35 AM] nymkappa#9440
Also... where is my order gone? Hahaha

[16-Jul-19 02:36 AM] nymkappa#9440
I guess there are not many nodes for now so did you delete it? 😂

[16-Jul-19 02:38 AM] TonyL#3577
It's not possible to "delete" someones order

[16-Jul-19 02:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Please do NOT update AtomicDEX to 0.1.2 - if you're using 0.1.1 continue to use it

[16-Jul-19 02:39 AM] 27aume#8635
@TonyL it didnt solved the issue. Im reading some guides about adb logcat at the moment.

[16-Jul-19 02:40 AM] TonyL#3577
oh, @27aume I think now I know what issue is  - 0.1.2 (with hotfix for logs sending) seems broken and not starting. I wonder playstore update was propagate on your side faster than on mine so thats why you got this error

[16-Jul-19 02:41 AM] TonyL#3577
I have same startup error after update to 0.1.2. Lets wait for @ca333 and @Kiruel  to update the build

[16-Jul-19 02:42 AM] 27aume#8635
Ok thanks. At least the error isnt specific to my device.👌

[16-Jul-19 02:42 AM] yorklab#7270
I crated an order (that I know won't go through) then logged out and logged back in and the order is still there. But will the swap happen if I'm not logged in?

[16-Jul-19 02:44 AM] TonyL#3577
When you acting as a maker your mm2 should be up to perform the swap. On application minimaze mm2 not exiting - it should exit only when you totally kill application

[16-Jul-19 02:44 AM] TonyL#3577
So with just minimized app swap should be performed

[16-Jul-19 02:45 AM] yorklab#7270
But logout = exit or minimize?

[16-Jul-19 02:45 AM] 27aume#8635
@TonyL if i put 'log output level' to verbose(highest lvl). Its gonna fill it with crap right?

[16-Jul-19 02:46 AM] TonyL#3577
minimize doesnt kill mm2 @yorklab

{Reactions}
👌🏼 

[16-Jul-19 02:46 AM] nymkappa#9440
So I request a KMDDOGE swap, there was already a pending order since I could choose the rate. I request it but now there is not order matching...
