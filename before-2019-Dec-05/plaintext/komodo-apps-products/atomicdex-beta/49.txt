That didn't come up this time.

[09-Aug-19 08:50 AM] Oszy#5734
Ok, I am going to report that on github regardless because it happened, you might have to send the logs to someone to see why it fails.

[09-Aug-19 08:51 AM] CrisF#3405
sure.

[09-Aug-19 08:53 AM] Oszy#5734
does it fail after matching? at 0/3? or at 1/3 when it's matched?

[09-Aug-19 08:53 AM] Oszy#5734
I had this with VRSC before, try half the amount

[09-Aug-19 08:53 AM] CrisF#3405
1/3 on old version, 2/3 on new.

[09-Aug-19 08:54 AM] Oszy#5734
so fails at ongoing swap? has fee been taken?

[09-Aug-19 08:54 AM] CrisF#3405
Not sure I can 1/2 the value.  min transactions is .00777

[09-Aug-19 08:54 AM] Oszy#5734

[09-Aug-19 09:02 AM] CrisF#3405

[09-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Oszy#5734
rust

[09-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Oszy#5734

[09-Aug-19 11:25 AM] CrisF#3405
I saw that mm2 was rust.  A wallet dev was asking me about the gui.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #20: NoSuchMethodError: The getter 'coin' was called on null\.
I upgraded from 0.1.5 - 15dcab0ee to 0.153.  Had 2 failed swaps on that too.
A few hour later I had a BCH ETH swap go through.

[09-Aug-19 11:48 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
GUI is built on Flutter framework - Dart language.

Could you tell me how I can use `swap ID` and find out txids for the trade?

@Cris-F do you have failed swap or exception like above on 0.1.53?
If exception: what are the steps to reproduce?

If you have failed/stuck swaps please use this form: https://forms.gle/e18deJDGYB7M5Ek99

[09-Aug-19 11:55 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@CrisF Click on particular swap on `History` page and you will see this screen:

However it displays payments tx id/hashes only and doesn't display spends.

[09-Aug-19 11:57 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
If you're using MM2 CLI you may get full swap status with all transactions details by calling `my_swap_status`: https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#my-swap-status

Great, thanks @artem.pikulin .  I'm just testing out atomicdex.  Will start on a simple Bob node in a little bit.

[09-Aug-19 12:12 PM] ca333#0118
we can add more information to the trade detail view like all related transactions, ...

[09-Aug-19 12:18 PM] CrisF#3405
That would be a nice option at some point.

[09-Aug-19 04:17 PM] ferjr90#9314
I tried to sell some KMD for ETH but I got the next error message: "Base coin balance is too low to cover gas fee, required 0.0002"

[09-Aug-19 04:17 PM] ferjr90#9314
Is it because I have no Ether? I need to deposit ETH to recieve ETH?

[09-Aug-19 04:18 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, any trade involving eth or erc20 as seller or buyer requires gas.

[09-Aug-19 04:20 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
transaction has to go via a "smart" contract, so gas.
