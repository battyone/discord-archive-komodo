[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #101 Order persists in orderbook after withdrawing funds
First noticed this in CLI, reproduced in mobile app. 
Steps to reproduce:
- create an order manually
- withdraw funds from wallet
- check orderbook. Order remains in book, though the funds required to complete the order are no longer in the wallet.

What is the path to get a coin listed on atomicdex?

[04-Oct-19 07:05 AM] gcharang#6833
@johnwhitestar contact @PTYX

[04-Oct-19 07:13 AM] johnwhitestar#1227
@gcharang thank you!

[04-Oct-19 07:38 AM] Oszy#5734
TX history for any coin sometimes doesn't load just spinning, unless you restart the app, is this known issue?

[04-Oct-19 07:42 AM] TonyL#3577
Are you facing it on Android or iOS @Oszy ?

[04-Oct-19 07:48 AM] Oszy#5734
android, but it was kinda always like this, not sure what is causing it, can't be the electrum connecttion because the balances are coming up

[04-Oct-19 07:48 AM] Oszy#5734
i even switched phones recently

[04-Oct-19 07:49 AM] Oszy#5734
want a fresh log?

[04-Oct-19 07:49 AM] Oszy#5734
i am thinking it happens after i made a swap recently

[04-Oct-19 07:50 AM] Oszy#5734
I'll do a rick/morty now to see

[04-Oct-19 07:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Log after catching such state would be very useful, thanks

[04-Oct-19 07:52 AM] Oszy#5734
sure thing üëç

[04-Oct-19 07:56 AM] Oszy#5734
okay it's not the swap that messes it up

[04-Oct-19 08:16 AM] Carsen#3333
Just successfully did a rick & morty swap

[04-Oct-19 08:16 AM] Carsen#3333
Hoping we can get D on there so we can start doing some swaps, its in the COINS under jl777

[04-Oct-19 08:17 AM] Carsen#3333
Amazing so far guys!!! A++ This is going to be a game changer when ready

Says no internet but there is and app works fine. False alert?

[04-Oct-19 09:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Hard to say without the log

[04-Oct-19 09:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Probably you switched from wifi to mobile network

[04-Oct-19 09:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Lets say wifi network signal dissapeared for some time and then reappeared

[04-Oct-19 09:32 AM] Oszy#5734

All electrums are currently disconnected

Negative thing i see in the video from the digibyte guy is that he say "you deposit your funds into someone elses wallet" which is not true? You create your own wallet?

[04-Oct-19 03:32 PM] Markus#5464
around 2:40 in the video

[04-Oct-19 03:36 PM] Acura#2748

[04-Oct-19 08:18 PM] Carsen#3333
They made probably roughly what is that like $15,000 USD to "list" two coins?

$KMD charging #developers $7,500 USD to list their coins on a closed source GUI, that are already coded into the backend MM2 DEX code....

To whom that try to charge #devs fees, FUCK YOU.

[04-Oct-19 08:34 PM] willofleo#7505
I think it fine for big project to pay up , especially with the exchange ban , however I do feel for the tiny cap project that would benefit greatly from atomicdex but cant pay thousunds of usd

[04-Oct-19 08:35 PM] willofleo#7505
maybe a type of access in which they pay only after they reach/surpass  a certain volume and market cap

[04-Oct-19 08:37 PM] Carsen#3333
^^^ agreed

[04-Oct-19 08:37 PM] Carsen#3333
These fees are only going to stifle growth here with atomicDEX

[04-Oct-19 08:37 PM] Carsen#3333
It is hard to advertise a DEX that charges listing fees

[04-Oct-19 08:37 PM] Carsen#3333
That just literally ruins the term Decentralized Exchange

[04-Oct-19 08:39 PM] Carsen#3333
Like as a developer I would want to help work on atomicDEX and improve it and continue to maintain the project, but being charged a fee, just knocks most devs out, especially the ones whom matter and truely believe in decentralized open source software.

[04-Oct-19 08:39 PM] cipi#4502
there is nothing coded in the mm2 backend, everything needed to trade a coin is here: https://github.com/jl777/coins
so to list a coin, make a PR to the repo and add all needed infos, like coin config, electrums, explorer
and don't forget to run a mm2 node for your coin, so it has liquidity

[04-Oct-19 08:39 PM] TonyL#3577
@Carsen AtomicDEX-API (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API) != AtomicDEX mobile GUI

[04-Oct-19 08:39 PM] Carsen#3333
I mean the whole system as a backend

[04-Oct-19 08:40 PM] Carsen#3333
I understand that guyys

[04-Oct-19 08:40 PM] Carsen#3333
Denarius is already in jl777s repo

[04-Oct-19 08:40 PM] Carsen#3333
We are in the HyperDEX

[04-Oct-19 08:40 PM] Carsen#3333
Still shouldnt be charging devs to be listed on one of the GUIs for it

[04-Oct-19 08:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Why?

[04-Oct-19 08:41 PM] cipi#4502
That is the decision of the GUI devs

[04-Oct-19 08:41 PM] Carsen#3333
So those devs shouldnt be in this industry

[04-Oct-19 08:41 PM] Carsen#3333
It is not a DEX

[04-Oct-19 08:41 PM] Carsen#3333
That GUI

[04-Oct-19 08:41 PM] Carsen#3333
Since it is closed source and paid to list

[04-Oct-19 08:42 PM] Carsen#3333
Like how does no one else see this?

[04-Oct-19 08:42 PM] Carsen#3333
That is a money grab

[04-Oct-19 08:42 PM] Carsen#3333
It only hurts devs

[04-Oct-19 08:42 PM] Oszy#5734
So if someone want to get paid for their work it is a moneygrab. Interesting

[04-Oct-19 08:43 PM] Carsen#3333
Yes if they are advertising it as an open source DEX

[04-Oct-19 08:43 PM] Markus#5464
kmd didnt raise millions that they can spend on whatever like many other projects have, yet they manage to spend probably 100k if not more to get listed on certains exchanges and now 7500$ is a issue

[04-Oct-19 08:43 PM] Markus#5464
funny guy

[04-Oct-19 08:43 PM] Oszy#5734
Backend it is open source

[04-Oct-19 08:43 PM] Oszy#5734
Gui devs need to get paid

[04-Oct-19 08:43 PM] Oszy#5734
Simple

[04-Oct-19 08:43 PM] Carsen#3333
You guys are missing the point

[04-Oct-19 08:43 PM] Carsen#3333
That is okay your mods here

[04-Oct-19 08:43 PM] Carsen#3333
They probably paid you at some point

[04-Oct-19 08:43 PM] Carsen#3333
I do all this for free

[04-Oct-19 08:44 PM] Carsen#3333
Ive been maintaining and updating my project Denarius with ZERO funding the past two and a half years now

[04-Oct-19 08:44 PM] Carsen#3333
Any exchanges that did charge a listing fee we typically got donations for to get listed

[04-Oct-19 08:44 PM] Markus#5464
also can u explain ur scam hashtag in ur tweet, how is it a scam

[04-Oct-19 08:44 PM] Carsen#3333
No one wants to donate for a "DEX"

[04-Oct-19 08:44 PM] Carsen#3333
A DEX should just be able to be listed to as a coin developer

[04-Oct-19 08:44 PM] Carsen#3333
A DEX would not charge a coin developer almost $10,000 USXXD

[04-Oct-19 08:44 PM] Carsen#3333
USD*

[04-Oct-19 08:45 PM] Carsen#3333
Because then you have people in here

[04-Oct-19 08:45 PM] Oszy#5734
Show me one exchange dex or cex that lists you for free

[04-Oct-19 08:45 PM] Carsen#3333
Being like, yea open source coming soon, hit up PYTX

[04-Oct-19 08:45 PM] Markus#5464
So u can fork MM2 and make ur own gui, thats fine

[04-Oct-19 08:45 PM] Carsen#3333
PYTX, oh yea, its closed source and $7.5k to list

[04-Oct-19 08:45 PM] Carsen#3333
lmao

[04-Oct-19 08:45 PM] Carsen#3333
That is a scam imo
