@grewalsatinder are you using AtomicDEX released today?

[16-Jul-19 07:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
0.1.1

[16-Jul-19 07:51 AM] TonyL#3577
ok, in next release logs sending feature should work - will help a lot

[16-Jul-19 07:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@cipi how do I spend?

[16-Jul-19 07:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Closed app, gonna open again

Hello, i notice that my playstore Email Adress is not registered. What can i Do now? Last week i get an Email that i have to correct my Email Adress to this Adress which is connected to the playstore. I changed it but now im not preregistred when i Look at the playstore

[16-Jul-19 07:53 AM] cipi#4502
@grewalsatinder atomicdex spends... don't know why it hasn't done so... did you close the app before the swap completed?

[16-Jul-19 07:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
After it showed failed and posting screenshot here

[16-Jul-19 07:54 AM] cipi#4502
hmmm... then it is a bug... swap completed on maker side...

[16-Jul-19 07:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The window was active all time it was going. Switched to another app went back to atomicdex app, unlocked it with fingerprint swap failed. Took screenshot,  posted here, did a lil chat, closed app, opened app

[16-Jul-19 07:56 AM] cipi#4502
i guess taker will spend the KMD later... just leave it running... and look in the swap json... swap id is `49547950-ff80-41ca-ae24-1654b3e78345`

[16-Jul-19 07:56 AM] TonyL#3577
@Stuxator Hello! Could you please DM me your email? At the moment only first batch of testers received an access (around 100 first applicants) so maybe you'll just get it a little bit later during this/next week.

[16-Jul-19 08:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

I don't think I as a user has any access to see that ID details

[16-Jul-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe due to 1980s bandwidth it will just take a very long time?

[16-Jul-19 08:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Not sure I can get it's detailed json

[16-Jul-19 08:09 AM] ca333#0118
@grewalsatinder new build will be available on playstore shortly - already updated. Its changelog says `rename bundle` - please install it when you see it and try to reproduce. Share logs with us if the btc swap fails again.

[16-Jul-19 08:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
How logs are shared? Just by clicking send feedback?

[16-Jul-19 08:10 AM] ca333#0118
yes

[16-Jul-19 08:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Ok will do next time. How to get json detail of this failed swap to get KMD?

[16-Jul-19 08:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Btc are spent. Wallet shows less btc. Kmd are not in wallet.

[16-Jul-19 08:18 AM] jansako#3330
Hi all, lots of exciting stuff here since last night. So if I can only see the 'pre-register' button in Playstore, that means I am not a part of the lucky 100? :troll_hurt:

[16-Jul-19 08:18 AM] jansako#3330
I did register & confirmed email. No prob if that is the case, I will just wait & see.

[16-Jul-19 08:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @jansako ! If you see only the 'pre-register' - yes, it means that you're not in first 100 participants 🙂 More testers will be added eventually during this week

[16-Jul-19 08:21 AM] ca333#0118
not in the current version @grewalsatinder - but we are adding it now and will notify you when its up.

[16-Jul-19 09:05 AM] TonyL#3577 (pinned)
Dear testers, please uninstall AtomicDEX app which you have atm on your phone and install actual one from Play Market. 
It have "Settings -> Send report"  feature repaired - so in case of failed swap please use it to collect the log file.

Thx @vichiet for the logs, can you close the app (kill it) and re-open it ?

[16-Jul-19 09:24 AM] nymkappa#9440
When I have this issue I clear the app cache and it works again

[16-Jul-19 09:24 AM] vichiet#4058
@Kiruel ok I will try

[16-Jul-19 09:26 AM] nymkappa#9440
I've just claimed my Komodo reward and it worked perfectly

[16-Jul-19 09:27 AM] Kiruel#2091
Good to know @nymkappa 😃

[16-Jul-19 09:27 AM] Kiruel#2091
It's great feature 😉

[16-Jul-19 09:27 AM] nymkappa#9440
And its so fast wtf

[16-Jul-19 09:28 AM] Kiruel#2091
It's only a TX you know.

[16-Jul-19 09:28 AM] nymkappa#9440
Tell that to other wallets

[16-Jul-19 09:29 AM] nymkappa#9440
Will AtomicDEX claim all my rewards for all my utxo?

[16-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Kiruel#2091
xD

[16-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Kiruel#2091
Yeah all your balance.

[16-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Kiruel#2091
Your max balance.

[16-Jul-19 09:30 AM] nymkappa#9440
Okay thats nice. It regroups utxos into a single one?

[16-Jul-19 09:30 AM] nymkappa#9440
Or it does it for each utxo separately?

[16-Jul-19 09:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Just checking opening app again in cas it can auto claim the KMD funds to spend and make it available in my atomicdex kmd address. Now the history shows timeout, instead of failed. Same version as before. M not updating till next instructions.

35ac4715-5462-406d-b4e2-43e7d5c3c007.      Swap failed, just one. Have had many successful ones before and after this one, just sending the info over.

[16-Jul-19 09:42 AM] TonyL#3577 (pinned)
If you have failed swaps - please do not delete application and do not clean app cache/data because it'll delete information about swap and will be much more harder to continue swap

Yes, all swaps information is on your phone in local database. Nothing on server.
