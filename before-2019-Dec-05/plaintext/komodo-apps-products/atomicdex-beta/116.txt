Atomic swaps are still in a very early stage. First the users must get more awareness and far later more adoption when it’s out of beta. Patience my friends. 😘

@polycryptoblog D4RK is based on Particl, so I think its privacy mechanism is RingCT as well. How much is the fee for GUI integration?

@ggmesh @KomodoPlatform Hey! We had atomic swaps for BTC-LTC in the previous Atomic version. However removed them in v2 due to low users demand, liquidity issues and complicated implementation for the rest of blockchains. Most likely will get back to swaps next year or add...

@Skelt0r  currently cannot do ringct coins however if their devs want to work on it  we could add them when they get it working

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #126: Wrong sorting of orders
Here's another example. Notice the descending price sorting with the exeption of the top entry:

Looks like the price "0.01" is causing a sorting problem, as can be seen both examples?

Not true news, after testing

[15-Nov-19 11:50 AM] Oszy#5734
yeah and the one thing you can not swap with their fake-dex is KMD

[15-Nov-19 11:50 AM] Oszy#5734
it's just a wallet

[15-Nov-19 11:51 AM] Oszy#5734
with an exchange api

[15-Nov-19 12:01 PM] Goku#9007
Imo they are exploiting with it's misleading wallet name. They create a strong accociation to the atomic swap tech to get famous.
But I wonder why you support this behavior, with fake news.

[15-Nov-19 12:06 PM] Acura#2748
I don't think it was intended to write that.

[15-Nov-19 12:54 PM] ca333#0118
Yea i am sure this was unintended and likely just taken over from an external info - we will correct the post.

[15-Nov-19 12:56 PM] gigamesh#3544
@Goku if u read above you'll see i did a lort of digging re this

[15-Nov-19 12:58 PM] gigamesh#3544
their tweet (see above) indicates that integration with MM2/atomicDEX could be on the cards, and they have a big userbase. therefor it would be foolsih to hassle them re this

[15-Nov-19 12:58 PM] gigamesh#3544
on the other hand, the CEO openly admitted that atomic swaps were dropped months ago

[15-Nov-19 12:59 PM] gigamesh#3544
now says they need to update website to reflect that....

[15-Nov-19 12:59 PM] gigamesh#3544
my reaction is OK... *maybe* that takes time and money BUT not changing your twitter profile is totally unacceptable and misleading

[15-Nov-19 12:59 PM] ca333#0118
we corrected our post - will get in touch with Konstantin ref. atomicDEX integration soonish

if they integrate they wont need to change their website 😄

[15-Nov-19 01:10 PM] gigamesh#3544
i also noticed 2 quirks with their wallet: 1) the password you set can be only 1 char , and 2) recovering from seed words STILL prompts you for the password, which seems odd to me

[15-Nov-19 02:20 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Hey guys!! AtomicDex is working great. 
Quick question. Will you look to list platform coins, like BNB or KCS?

[15-Nov-19 02:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Those coins/communities can apply for listing 🙂

[15-Nov-19 02:34 PM] Trusty#8181
hi guys, i've a quick question on atomic dex, if I have orders open the phone has to be on and connected to the internet for possible matching? If I shut down the phone the orders are still matchable? I asking because in other dex like bisq etc. is that way.

[15-Nov-19 02:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As it is peer to peer, if a peer shuts down, you cannot match orders anymore

[15-Nov-19 02:43 PM] Goku#9007
@Trusty
On bisq you can't shutdown your computer as well

i'm getting timeouts on swaps with DAI

[15-Nov-19 02:50 PM] jorian#4555
```{
        "event": {
          "data": {
            "error": "taker_swap:645] Error waiting for 'maker-payment' data: taker_swap:641] timeout (690.0 > 690.0)"
          },
          "type": "MakerPaymentValidateFailed"
        },
        "timestamp": 1573828698263
      },```

[15-Nov-19 02:50 PM] jorian#4555
this happens right after the takerfee is sent

[15-Nov-19 02:50 PM] jorian#4555
using latest mm2.0

[15-Nov-19 02:58 PM] Trusty#8181
@Cryptoon but the app has to be open too? I have a pin code to go in so I don't know if the app is not open my peer is still active

[15-Nov-19 03:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Which os? Ios or android?

[15-Nov-19 03:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think on ios for now the app needs to remain open, best to keep the screen from going into standby. For android it can run in the background.

[15-Nov-19 03:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Best to doublecheck with @ca333

[15-Nov-19 03:07 PM] Trusty#8181
I am on android 9

[15-Nov-19 03:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm then there is a possibility I think, best to wait for confirmation from a dev 🙂

[15-Nov-19 03:29 PM] ca333#0118
correct @Cryptoon - on android the DEX app keeps operating in the background @Trusty

[15-Nov-19 03:30 PM] ca333#0118
@jorian which coin were you swapping DAI against?

[15-Nov-19 03:30 PM] jorian#4555
I was trying to get some DAI with KMD

[15-Nov-19 03:31 PM] jorian#4555
must say i wasn't using mobile atomicdex, so i might be doing something wrong. i made sure i had ETH balance, but still it only sends the takerfee, then waits a while and then times out

[15-Nov-19 03:56 PM] ca333#0118
ok i see - feel free to DM me your config and i will try to reproduce it through CLI

[15-Nov-19 04:10 PM] cipi#4502
i found the problem: someone bought all ETH from that node, so there is not enough ETH left to pay txfees for other ERC20 tokens
the only solution to this problem is to disable ETH orders... and that is what i will do now...

[15-Nov-19 04:12 PM] jorian#4555
that's what i expected

[15-Nov-19 04:13 PM] jorian#4555
it might be an idea to remove orders from the orderbook for ERC20 tokens, once ETH doesn't have balance.

[15-Nov-19 04:13 PM] jorian#4555
but not sure if that is a workable solution

[15-Nov-19 04:13 PM] ca333#0118
or keep the ETH orders and just set max. volume to a value under the ETH balance to not run into the same situation again

[15-Nov-19 04:14 PM] ca333#0118
it would be like "reserving" the diff. between maxvol and balance for ERC trades

[15-Nov-19 04:14 PM] jorian#4555
could also work

[15-Nov-19 04:15 PM] cipi#4502
orders are updated every minute... with `max:true`, i do not check the balance before posting orders

[15-Nov-19 04:19 PM] cipi#4502
ok, DAI swaps should work again... ETH orders removed...

[15-Nov-19 05:04 PM] paia#7713
When do you expect order matching to work? I am on latest version (iOS), but still unable to match any morty/rick trade. All stuck at 0/3.

[15-Nov-19 05:07 PM] gcharang#6833
@paia ordermatching has always been working
there might be some issue on your device, can you share the log?
```
Settings -> share log file 
```

[15-Nov-19 05:30 PM] paia#7713
cant post file here...

[15-Nov-19 05:31 PM] gcharang#6833
send it to me in Dm @paia

[16-Nov-19 04:23 AM] gcharang#6833
^ device is iOS and the issue seems to be the one where the app won't work when the screen is locked

[16-Nov-19 09:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah, is it hard to implement to keep it working in background like gps apps or whatever? I already checked privacy settings for apps running in background but atomicdex not there to ‘allow’ to run in background

[16-Nov-19 10:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Sorry its: settings/general/refresh on background

How can i pick up it from atomicdex wallet.
My device is android os.

[16-Nov-19 11:07 AM] Markus#5464
@omisu you have to use a legacy btc recieving address, starting with a "1", segwit addresses are not supported yet

[16-Nov-19 11:09 AM] omisu#6895
where can i get starting with a 1 address?

[16-Nov-19 11:11 AM] gcharang#6833
@omisu to which btc wallet are you sending?

[16-Nov-19 11:16 AM] omisu#6895
oh I found it,My using exchange address is starting with 3 but other one is made with starting 1~~~~. 
I solved that, thank you Markus and gcharang for taking care about me.

@gcharang thanks, but wasn't what i was looking for, maybe my questions wasn't clear enough, sorry! 
I mean how do i add a coin that's not supported yet? Can i spin up my own node/wallet for that specific coin or who controls what can be traded?

[16-Nov-19 05:13 PM] gcharang#6833
sorry, 
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-tutorials/atomicdex-walkthrough.html>
in the step that says "Setting Up the Coin List"
you can add the coin you are interested in

for now, most BTC forks and ERC20 are supported out of the box
<https://github.com/jl777/coins> -- see read me here and the files to know how to add a new coin

[16-Nov-19 05:15 PM] gcharang#6833
@HighOnLife this is for adding to the cli, which you can do locally for yourself and submit a PR along with the proof of swaps (5 txns) - this is free
for adding into the atomicDEX mobile, there is a listing fee

[16-Nov-19 05:16 PM] HighOnLife#2453
Ok, thanks @gcharang , i'll have a look into it - what's the listing fee for and how much is that?

[16-Nov-19 05:18 PM] gcharang#6833
the listing fee is for including in the gui, you can speak with @PTYX about the specifics
