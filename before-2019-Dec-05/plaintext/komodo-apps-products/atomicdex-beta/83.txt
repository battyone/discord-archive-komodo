Could there be a bug that a swap is not executed fully? Had 7777 of Rick and 7777 Morty. Now Rick is almost none and Morty did not increase.

[27-Oct-19 12:21 PM] Oszy#5734
well what does your swap status say?

[27-Oct-19 12:21 PM] Oszy#5734
it takes time, how long ago was it?

[27-Oct-19 12:23 PM] Oszy#5734
in case it fails you will be refunded in 4 hours

[27-Oct-19 12:23 PM] Oszy#5734
please read my message above yours, pretty much explains it

@ca333 when will atomicdex be released in      the app store instead of having to use testflight on ios?

[27-Oct-19 12:26 PM] Oszy#5734
When it's out of beta 😛

@Markus after the beta - using testflight means a controlled testing environment and many essential and important runtime infos.

Shouldn't the Dex Asset be added to the current release? can't find it

@Acura it will be in the next release - this was just a hotfix release to address the bug report above.

to trade Ethereum do we need to have all 9 million+ TXs  synced, or can we receive ETH and start right away?

[27-Oct-19 04:26 PM] jspook16#3059
Right away

[27-Oct-19 05:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
New ios build available

[27-Oct-19 05:50 PM] JvdP#8992
@NNoperator, just like with the other coins you don't have to sync the entire blockchain, you can pretty much start playing rightaway. My phone would be really sad if it had to store all those blockchains...

[27-Oct-19 05:51 PM] JvdP#8992
Oh, wait, @jspook16 already answered that one. Just when I thought I was being useful... 😄

[27-Oct-19 05:55 PM] Zombie259#6134
What about the fees to swap ETH?

[27-Oct-19 06:29 PM] Oszy#5734
what about it?

[27-Oct-19 06:36 PM] Zombie259#6134
How much is the fee to swap 1 ETH to KMD?

[27-Oct-19 06:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
1/777 is the dexfee

[27-Oct-19 06:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And normal gas fee to transfer eth to the new addy?

[27-Oct-19 06:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not sure how high gas fees are atm

[27-Oct-19 06:38 PM] Zombie259#6134
@Cryptoon  Thx

[27-Oct-19 06:53 PM] mobipoi#5774
Would be nice to see live orders before depositing tokens , as when you tap the select coin button it says you have no funds also  more use of the news tab will be.great, such as the news of the stress test

[27-Oct-19 06:54 PM] mobipoi#5774
That a great way to engage user's who dont use discord Twitter telegram  etc also less hassle

Hello, I need help, I have atomic dex on my smartphone, but for days I try to enter and the screen only comes out in black, what should I do?

[27-Oct-19 11:24 PM] Oszy#5734
@Bernardo94 uninstall the app and install again, have your seed backed up, you'll have to enter it again.

[28-Oct-19 01:30 AM] ubhillutd#3274
This was dumb in my part, but I have the same problem as bernardo94. I may have misplaced my passphrase. I updated the app and all I get is a black screen. I'm worried if I uninstall and reinstall, I will lose whatever little coins I have on the app. Please advise.

[28-Oct-19 01:35 AM] daemonfox#6136
I see the update listed in play store and applied t. Works fine Google Pixel latest Android 10.

[28-Oct-19 01:41 AM] daemonfox#6136
orderbooks werent showing at first but I see orders now

[28-Oct-19 01:48 AM] ca333#0118
@Bernardo94 delete the application and reinstall it as previously advised - that will resolve the "black screen issue" and also prevent it from reoccurring in the future. FYI This is a backwards compatibility problem caused when you have not done a clean install after upgrading from a pre 0.2.1 to a > 0.2.1 version. 

@ubhillutd contact our support team - they can guide you through the process of manually installing the old version (downgrading) and keeping the application data to hopefully extract your old seed. PLEASE back your seed up the next time as advised in the account setup.

[28-Oct-19 01:52 AM] ubhillutd#3274
I've contacted support. Will do. Sorry for the inconvenience. You guys rock!

I think it should stay closed source until the team recovers the funds they invested in making it.

[28-Oct-19 11:49 AM] PTYX#6840
Once you open source it, forget revenue.

[28-Oct-19 11:51 AM] PTYX#6840
Dexfees aren't significant enough to give it away for free. At least not with the current volume. Licensing is the way to go.

[28-Oct-19 12:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@PTYX makes a good point 🙂

[28-Oct-19 12:28 PM] Acura#2748
I don't like much as a Dex Hodler. (Forget revenue 😬)

[28-Oct-19 12:29 PM] Acura#2748
But maybe I don't have enough understanding for these things either.

[28-Oct-19 12:31 PM] PTYX#6840
@Acura as a dex holder you get revenue from anyone using the dex

[28-Oct-19 12:32 PM] PTYX#6840
Komodo being able to license their premium software doesn't affect you, in fact it benefits you. Without funds development would stall and there would be no incentive for users to use the DEX and hence, no dexfees for dex hodlers.

[28-Oct-19 12:32 PM] PTYX#6840
I'm confused why people think that free equals good. It's almost the opposite without a proper business model.

[28-Oct-19 12:33 PM] Acura#2748

That's different, we had an issue before where everything was fine on Android, and coins wouldn't load on iOS.  It was an ISP issue in certain geo locations.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #6: feature requests
Failed swaps already displaying on the trades history page with "Refund" button in case when auto-refund failed by some reason. So unlikely displaying of failed swaps in one more place will stop the user from actions which deletes data about user swaps such as app uninstalling.

However it's good idea to add push notification about failed swaps with further recommendation as soon as push notifications feature will be implemented in general.
