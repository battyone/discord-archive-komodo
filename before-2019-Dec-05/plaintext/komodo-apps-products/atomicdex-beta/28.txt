Update succesful üëç

[20-Jul-19 03:58 PM] SHossain#0007
@27aume did you uninstall before installing new version?

[20-Jul-19 03:58 PM] 27aume#8635
Yes

[20-Jul-19 03:59 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. this makes my previous assumption invalid

[20-Jul-19 03:59 PM] 27aume#8635
Fresh install. Im able to see version 0.13-a

Also loading histories seems to work properly

[20-Jul-19 03:59 PM] SHossain#0007
i don'tn see any update. will uninstall first

[20-Jul-19 04:01 PM] SHossain#0007
my fear came true. after uninstalling, i see pre-register button

[20-Jul-19 04:01 PM] jspook16#3059
Question: When I go to trade and select coin to Sell (Rick), then select coin to buy (Morty), I am unable to change the rate so that it will create a new order at a different rate. Is that by design? New orders at different rates cannot be created?

[20-Jul-19 04:02 PM] 27aume#8635
Shossain i clicked on the google play link shared yb ca333
Then "download from google play" button.
Then clicked on "installed" and it started downloading even ifs it was showing installed after i unistalled.

updated and completed a KMD / DOGE trade without issues
but going into some of the coins tx history, makes every coin's tx history to stop working, app restart needed if it happens.

Thanks I use IOS. Is it available for IOS?

[20-Jul-19 04:18 PM] ubhillutd#3274
I'm assuming that it's taking time because theres no one on the exchange . Is that correct?

[20-Jul-19 04:21 PM] ubhillutd#3274
Or is it because the btc network is slow in general?

[20-Jul-19 04:21 PM] ca333#0118
@B. G√ºltekin √áetiner yes - we will notify you through the provided email address when the app is approved for iOS - takes likely 2-3 days.

@ubhillutd swaps on the BTC network do rely on the confirmations and may take some time.

So i have some questions about the LP thing. I heard the current LP fee is like 5%? If more people use it, then does it mean that the swap will happen without an LP and the trade will happen on the market value without any slippage on both parties except the dex fee?

[20-Jul-19 05:04 PM] SHossain#0007
LP doesn't pay fee

[20-Jul-19 05:04 PM] SHossain#0007
maker never pay fee

[20-Jul-19 05:04 PM] SHossain#0007
taker pays 1/777 fee

[20-Jul-19 05:04 PM] SHossain#0007
which is about 0.15%

[20-Jul-19 05:04 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
I mean the LP charges a fee for their risk

[20-Jul-19 05:04 PM] ca333#0118

market will reach equilibrium

[20-Jul-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
as soon as someone undercuts the 5%, it goes below 5%

[20-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Daiyox#2701
I recieved an invite, but subscribed with an email that was not attached to my play account .. I can provide the email for my play account assuming that is the easiest way to resolve

yes, anybody can become an LP

The orders placed by the team on rick kmd are for us(testers) to buy kmd with testcoins not the other way. Sorry having some doubts xD

I lost RVN in a swap today. My RVN are received by the other wallet but I never received KMD. I don't understand what happen because I left open the app during the swap. More details in the PDF @TonyL @SHossain
