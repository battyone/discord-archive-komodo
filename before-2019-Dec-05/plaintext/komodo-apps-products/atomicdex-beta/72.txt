@Redman you could use your Verus Agama seed phrase in AtomicDEX through the "Restore" option
just select "Custom seed", make sure your address matches before funding it

[28-Sep-19 08:42 AM] ca333#0118
@rnr nice to see you!! Yes exactly - anyone could provide a browser based atomicDEX soon and the best thing is it would be able to utilize a unified liquidity pool across all DEX apps (web, desktop, mobile, ...) so they would basically be all interconnected.

[28-Sep-19 09:01 AM] gcharang#6833
@Keytothegate what are the error messages?

[28-Sep-19 09:02 AM] Keytothegate#8453

@ca333  where is the benefit for kmd when anyone could provide a browser basedatomic dex?

[28-Sep-19 09:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
dexfees, and the discount for KMD pairs

[28-Sep-19 09:29 AM] ca333#0118
Many benefits like more tech adoption, more dexfees as mentioned by SMK, bigger unified liquidity-pool, much bigger userbase, chance for atomicDEX becoming the DEX standard protocol, and so on. It is also in the sense of the general open-source idea and our interoperability and unity vision.

[28-Sep-19 10:04 AM] scubapanda#2485
What are the plans for liquidity on the Atomicdex?

[28-Sep-19 10:06 AM] gcharang#6833
we are building a tool for LPs

which will allow easy management of funds and orders

[28-Sep-19 10:08 AM] scubapanda#2485
Could someone just start providing Binance prices +1% in a (nearly) automated way? I guess shapeshift alikes are doing that but there you'll have to send your coins first and hope you'll get something in return..

i see a line of text writing "getting prices from coingecko" are those prices up to date or is there a delay when they update prices?

[28-Sep-19 10:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
each time some functions run, it gets prices from Binance or Coingecko API. I've heard CoinPaprika is also good, but havent integrated it

[28-Sep-19 10:16 AM] Markus#5464
does the bot market buy or put a limit order?

[28-Sep-19 10:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've not yet streamlined binance side of things much. Basically not worried about fiat, just use it to maintain a baseline balance of each coin. If I have too much of one and not enough of another, I'll adjust manually. Will automate this more later, but have been careful/paranoid with delegating too much power to API keys early on.

@zephuros from what wallet did you scan the QR code by AtomicDEX?

[28-Sep-19 11:58 PM] Oszy#5734
qr gives back a string it is what it is, atomicdex doesn't change the output, where did you scan it from? scan it with a regular QR app as well you should see the same output

[29-Sep-19 01:03 AM] zephuros#2936
From my ledger wallet

[29-Sep-19 01:04 AM] zephuros#2936
Guess will have to contact them

[29-Sep-19 01:14 AM] TonyL#3577
It standart prefix for some wallet - just need to enchance AtomicDEX scanner a little bit to parse such cases automatically. Also will check `and my keyboard on my phone wouldn't pop up to let me change it` this. Thank you for report!

[29-Sep-19 08:27 AM] Oszy#5734
you have to define a pair

[29-Sep-19 08:28 AM] Oszy#5734
like `"method\":\"orderbook\",\"base\":\"KMD\",\"rel\":\"HUSH\"}"`

[29-Sep-19 08:29 AM] Oszy#5734
do this for each pair you want to see and put ` > coinName.json` at the end

[29-Sep-19 08:29 AM] Oszy#5734
at least it's what i am doing

[29-Sep-19 08:29 AM] Oszy#5734
too lazy to make a web gui for it now

[29-Sep-19 08:30 AM] Oszy#5734
but you can only see orderbooks for coins that are activated at your mm2

[29-Sep-19 08:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@hastrup If you time it right, orderbooks can be seen at https://oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/
To my shame though, server is having some issues until I have time/fiat to upgrade and or move some things around, so it has been failing every now and then, but I can revive it once I am aware.

FYI: For Samsung phone users (s10 or higher probably), there was an update today, you can now use Samsung DEX (funny yes it's called dex), you can connect your phone to the PC and use the phone in full screen on PC. AtomicDex works too.

Using smk's orderbook site I added up the volume using KMD as a base pair, currently there are orders for `658370.7239288847` KMD over all the current coin pairs

[29-Sep-19 03:57 PM] Markus#5464
But thats not unique coin amount right?

[29-Sep-19 04:00 PM] Markus#5464
I assume thats with the coin multipler

[29-Sep-19 04:03 PM] Regnar#6164
yea that's as orderbook shows, so definitely with multiplier

[29-Sep-19 04:13 PM] Regnar#6164
biggest pairs are DOGE/KMD, DGB/KMD, RFOX/KMD, RVN/KMD in that order

[29-Sep-19 04:26 PM] Regnar#6164
though I'm not sure if this is displaying duplicates in some way.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #96 Portfolio Tab Bugged \(v0\.2\.0\)
So I've been using the Android public beta of atomicDEX for about a week. Did my first atomic swap which was neat. 

The issue I'm having is that after the latest update (0.2.0-e634e05ee) my balance is showing as zero and coins/tokens I've added to my portfolio are gone. Trying to add a coin/token again adds an empty space where it should be in the list.

This version is newer than what's on Google Play so maybe it got rolled out by accident? It's probably just a bug with that tab, my tra...

This text is correct - you need to use password to unlock (decrypt) your wallet before the deletion.
And after you input the password there is confirmation popup "Are you sure you want to delete your wallet"

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #97: The password confirmation screen for "Delete Wallet" says "Unlock wallet"
Of course the wallet needs to be decrypted before deletion. But the page doesn't signify that entering this password is only one step away from deleting the wallet.

If a user clicks the delete wallet button by mistake, why should a user enter his password without knowing exactly why they are entering it?

Each page should tell the user exactly what its purpose is, so the page that needs password entry for deleting the wallet should at least have the word delete in it.
