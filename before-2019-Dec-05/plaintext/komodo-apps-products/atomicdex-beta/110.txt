It was just a test coin

If you knew why they were there, they wouldnt be very good ninja’s wouldnt they?

[03-Nov-19 09:57 PM] Acura#2748
I've been able to observe this:

I put in 2 different orders.
Once as an example: Dex/KMD and Dex/BTC
If I now switch the mobile phone to standby and then log in to the mobile phone after few seconds/minutes, then I'm back in AtomicDex and want to place another 3rd order for the same asset, the message "Order book is being loaded" appears - but then no existing orders from other people are displayed to me anymore. I can only create one myself.

I see as virtually no other available orders anymore. If it is a bug I don't know. But I noticed it.

Android system. Android 7.1.2

[03-Nov-19 10:01 PM] Oszy#5734
It doesn't load sometimes

[03-Nov-19 10:01 PM] Oszy#5734
`why?` we could check from logs.

[03-Nov-19 10:22 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
Happens to me some on my android as well. I clear cache and that works sometimes, or I just restart the phone.

[03-Nov-19 10:43 PM] vichiet#4058
I have on strange transaction I don't initiate in my atomicdex wallet. Can someone help me to check where that come from ? 35 kmd goes to unknown wallet

The only task I did yesterday was to try to sell 1 dex coin for 35 kmd . Now I lose 35 kmd . Strange

[03-Nov-19 10:50 PM] Oszy#5734
You sure you didn't try to buy? IT's still on the `b` address so it's an uncompleted swap. Do you see it in your swap history as failed?

[03-Nov-19 10:52 PM] vichiet#4058
See no transaction in my atomicdex wallet

[03-Nov-19 10:52 PM] Oszy#5734
Nothing in swap history?

[03-Nov-19 10:53 PM] vichiet#4058
Nothing

[03-Nov-19 10:53 PM] Oszy#5734
did you delete cache /data since?

[03-Nov-19 10:53 PM] vichiet#4058
No

[03-Nov-19 10:54 PM] vichiet#4058
I put some orders at 17 kmd but no fulfill

[03-Nov-19 10:54 PM] Oszy#5734
we'd have to check your logs then. to see why that 35 KMD landed on a Dex address. 
send it to @TonyL or @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator i am sure it will get sorted out

[03-Nov-19 10:55 PM] vichiet#4058
Ok good

[03-Nov-19 10:56 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
send your logs by DM, we can check. If its a stuck swap it should return after some time

[03-Nov-19 10:58 PM] vichiet#4058
I cannot send the log file ( 17 mb ) limitation at 8 mb

Is AtomicDEX taking too high fees for litecoin?

Litecoin Fees to be Reduced 10x to “Half a Cent” with the LTC ...
Litecoin fees are about to get reduced 10 times with the new Litecoin Core launch due to a surge in its fees after Litecoin hit its all-time high (ATH) at $320.

Default fee should be 0.0001 LTC per transaction.

[04-Nov-19 07:52 AM] Acura#2748
Hey @vichiet , yesterday i had sell 1 Dex for 35kmd - that was me 😅.
But unfortunately the trade didn’t go trough. 

the swap stopped at 2 out of 3 steps.
After a few hours I got my 1 Dex again.

[04-Nov-19 07:54 AM] Acura#2748
I can send also my logs if requested

[04-Nov-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL maybe txfee for LTC is still set to 0.001, if so, should be changed to 0.0001

[04-Nov-19 08:31 AM] willofleo#7505
when can we expect other KMD asset to be listed on the atomic dex , such as MGW, Jumblr, Bot, etc

[04-Nov-19 08:34 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c yes, just checked - it's 0.001 now. Will be changed to 0.0001 in the next patch

Hi - i have observed some strange behaviour in latest iOS version on swaps where the trading fee seems to be taken twice from my address, happened on an OOT > KMD swap which was sucessfull and  DOGE > KMD swap that failed at 2/3.

[04-Nov-19 11:35 AM] Oszy#5734
@miles 
please provide swap `uid` and `tx id`'s  so we can investigate

Is there plans to add Dpow information of secured transactions status for coins?

[04-Nov-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810

[04-Nov-19 01:30 PM] TonyL#3577
maybe we can add "NOTARIZED" for assetchains near this "CONFIRMED" label

[04-Nov-19 01:31 PM] TonyL#3577
all the notartization info will make this page overcomplicated for mobile imo

[04-Nov-19 01:40 PM] Mark81#4505
Maybe on transaction listings right next green dot just show dpow icon for ones that are Dpowed and in details add column for Dpow secured transaction: yes/no.

[04-Nov-19 01:46 PM] ciumete#3212
is somewhere info about the live value of the dex asset ? to see when is closed about 1 milion for distribution ?!

[04-Nov-19 01:52 PM] Mark81#4505
On Atomicdex currently 1 kmd gets you 0.0333DEX.

[04-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Lennart#9331
i think he means the corresponding address that collects the fees. Would indeed be nice to be able to view it live

[04-Nov-19 02:14 PM] Lennart#9331
quite a way to go til 1 mil usd 😛

[04-Nov-19 02:14 PM] Lennart#9331
are the other assets that it holds to be converted to KMD yet?

[04-Nov-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
no, need to get enough in the other coins to convert

[04-Nov-19 02:22 PM] Lennart#9331
ah, so each individual asset collects 1 mio usd on its own and THEN gets converted?

[04-Nov-19 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
well before that it would be converted

[04-Nov-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure what the thresholds will be, depends on available liquidity on atomicDEX

[04-Nov-19 02:26 PM] Lennart#9331
thx

[04-Nov-19 02:34 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Ty for the 7.77 KMD isn't wasn't necessary but much apprech!

[04-Nov-19 03:28 PM] ciumete#3212
thx @jl777c , maybe in future will be some estimates and a progress bar to  thresholds

[04-Nov-19 04:01 PM] Monstar#8630
Is there a way, how to delete the logs from the App? After the last stress test my logs have like 30 MB. I would like to delete them so I can start with clear ones next time again.

[04-Nov-19 04:03 PM] Oszy#5734
1) You can reinstall
2) Go to App settings, delete cache/data

Either way you choose have to set up the wallet again so have the seed backed up.

[04-Nov-19 04:06 PM] Monstar#8630
That should be made simpler in the future IMO. Reinstalling seems like hunting a rabbit with a cannon. It would be great to have one more option, something like "clear logs and cache". Thanks. @Oszy

[04-Nov-19 04:23 PM] Oszy#5734
True

[04-Nov-19 04:23 PM] Acura#2748
On iOS i don’t have an Option to reset/delete the chache inside Atomicdex

[04-Nov-19 04:24 PM] Oszy#5734
Please open a github issue as `feature request`  so it won't just go into the air

[04-Nov-19 04:24 PM] Oszy#5734
@Acura On android it's in system settings not in-app. Not sure about iOS

[04-Nov-19 04:25 PM] Oszy#5734
But it's not an official solution to clear logs, this is the DIY mode.

[04-Nov-19 05:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Large logs on this point actually is the feature to make bug catching process easier. Some edge reported cases reproducing in a few days of active usage

[04-Nov-19 05:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Before logs stashed every time on app restart and in case of iOS was almost impossible to get something helpful from user log

100 KMD for 100 DEX ? I can sell 1k DEX for each 50 KMD if anybody wants to buy :3040_kingpeepo:

[04-Nov-19 09:04 PM] coingirl87#6489
@acura please dump your dex 🙈 i know you have a lot to dump...you are like the people who dump kmd for such a low price

[04-Nov-19 09:05 PM] ronyi#5719
@Acura I intrested 🙂 1k DEX for 50 KMD 🙂

[04-Nov-19 09:06 PM] Acura#2748
1k DEX = 50k KMD

[04-Nov-19 09:06 PM] ronyi#5719
I know just a joke 😄

[04-Nov-19 09:06 PM] coingirl87#6489
100kmd per dex maybe seems to be very high but after atomic dexs will be no longer in beta prices will be much higher

[04-Nov-19 09:07 PM] Acura#2748
I have no rush to sell

[04-Nov-19 09:27 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
so do the trading fees or transaction fee fund DEX?

[04-Nov-19 09:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Trading fees

[04-Nov-19 10:18 PM] MorganJekyll#8355
So who are the people who already have DEX coins? How were they minted or originally obtained?

[04-Nov-19 10:19 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
@coingirl87  there is 1 mio supply of dex and you get reward if the rewards from AtomicDEX get 1mio (kmd or usd?) so you get 1 kmd or usd? for every dex... why should someone pay 100,50 or 30 kmd for one dex??? 😂 do the math...
