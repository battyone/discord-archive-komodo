[31-Oct-19 01:59 PM] Alright#0419
we've done some 12 hour and 24 hour tests before, usually the people who have patience to make it to the end win

[31-Oct-19 02:01 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
might help to target your swap with orderbook listings with higher max volume. I see a lot of small volume offers, which may be cancelled by people waiting to trade and trying again. larger volume also means more than one might match

[31-Oct-19 02:01 PM] CrisF#3405
The BarterDEX 48 hour test was a marathon.  I finally got 1 swap right near the end.
Found a bug, got abounty and got hooked on this stuff, haha.
