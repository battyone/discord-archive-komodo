yeah trade small

[31-Oct-19 09:28 AM] Artist#0765
in smaller denominations, depends on the quantity of trades

[31-Oct-19 09:28 AM] CrisF#3405
There are no limits on sizes, right?

[31-Oct-19 09:28 AM] Artist#0765
but I guess you already know that

[31-Oct-19 09:28 AM] Artist#0765
ooh so you have like thousands of rick and morty xD

[31-Oct-19 09:29 AM] Artist#0765
nop

[31-Oct-19 09:30 AM] CrisF#3405
yeah, I was wondering if I should move them before the start.

[31-Oct-19 09:30 AM] Artist#0765
I would be glad to keep them safe

[31-Oct-19 09:30 AM] Artist#0765

I added RICK and MORTY a few days ago, but today I needed to add them again. Balance is still there. Does anyone keep track of all this feedback?

Can‚Äôt get Rick. Faucet says sent but it never shows in beta wallet have tried now several times with same result. Had no trouble with Morty but Rick just doesn‚Äôt seem to want to arrive.

[31-Oct-19 10:04 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@Yaconx Please wait a bit and retry, as stated above:
>>` faucet is under drainer/abuser "attack" at the moment. `

[31-Oct-19 10:16 AM] Artist#0765
well that is unfair

[31-Oct-19 10:16 AM] Artist#0765
if others get more from faucet then the stress test could get biased

[31-Oct-19 10:18 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Swapped amount doesn't matter, it's about quantity of swaps. You can always trade 0.01 RICKs as example.

[31-Oct-19 10:19 AM] Artist#0765
Well there might be fees associated but

[31-Oct-19 10:19 AM] Artist#0765
Ok

https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX/issues/112#issuecomment-548303029
[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #112:  french translation for "Select a coin" is too long and causes the input field for amount to be too small
Similar issue with russian translation.
While it's just fine with at least 1080p screen resolution, on smaller screens(and so older devices) "MAX" button is too big, so it shrinks input field.

User-submitted screenshot:

![](https://i.imgur.com/SEHkpmj.png)


It should be sufficient to change "–ú–ê–ö–°–ò–ú–£–ú" to simply "–ú–ê–ö–°" or even just keep it "MAX" as in english.

[31-Oct-19 10:25 AM] dudezmobi#1945
A lot of failed swap now

[31-Oct-19 10:28 AM] CrisF#3405

@Sir Seven i am here

[31-Oct-19 11:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
my phone complains that rick explorer's certificate is no longer valid

[31-Oct-19 11:06 AM] Markus#5464
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator your leaderboard page does not register from which kind of device the swaps occur from right? Cause i can imagine that ppl have created desktop bots just to participate into winning this 777 kmd, phone users will have no chance in beating a bot spamming non stop trades with even 1 sec delay

[31-Oct-19 11:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
hmm, no sorry, it only complains about the certificate when opening the faucet from within the atomicdex app. When I open it in safari straight away it's fine

[31-Oct-19 11:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I can tell the difference, though leaderboard doesnt have that info

[31-Oct-19 11:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I thought just participating and having at least 30 swaps was enough to compete in the competition?

[31-Oct-19 11:08 AM] RNI#2666
stress test starts in 1 hour right? got rick but no morty...

[31-Oct-19 11:08 AM] CrisF#3405
Wasn't it 30 trades gets you one chance to win a prize, @Cryptoon?

[31-Oct-19 11:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
as per the announcement :p

[31-Oct-19 11:08 AM] Markus#5464
Not sure üòõ

[31-Oct-19 11:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
just need at least 30

[31-Oct-19 11:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and you are entered

[31-Oct-19 11:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@alperC care to clarify :p

[31-Oct-19 11:09 AM] RNI#2666
morty but no rick .. sorry

[31-Oct-19 11:10 AM] alperC#7758
That's right @Cryptoon, you need to do at leas 30 swaps

[31-Oct-19 11:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
spamming that leads to high fail rates are not recommended üòâ I"ll be offering a few bonus prizes based on high success rates

[31-Oct-19 11:10 AM] Cryptoon#3362
is the faucet empty? Entered my addy in both Rick and Morty like 10 mins ago but nothing shows up, not in app/explorer

[31-Oct-19 11:10 AM] alperC#7758
Worked for me 15 minutes ago

[31-Oct-19 11:10 AM] Cryptoon#3362
wait

[31-Oct-19 11:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
nevermind

[31-Oct-19 11:11 AM] CrisF#3405
It was mentioned above that someone was spamming the faucet.

[31-Oct-19 11:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
as I typed it, it shows up

[31-Oct-19 11:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
looks like there is some backlog on payouts or so üòÑ

[31-Oct-19 11:13 AM] RNI#2666
not able to get any rick.. i'll wait for it

[31-Oct-19 11:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
took me about 10 mins @RNI

[31-Oct-19 11:14 AM] ca333#0118
if you can't get RICK/MORTY from the faucets just post your address and we will send you some

[31-Oct-19 11:14 AM] RNI#2666
@ca333 yes. got my morty immediately .. but rick doesn't seem to woek

QUESTION: We get 1 ticket for 1 swap. Do we also get 1 ticket if somebody fills an order we place?

[31-Oct-19 11:23 AM] gigamesh#3544
does it count as my swap for placing the order or their swap for filling it? Or do we both get a ticket?

I have a feeling the Rick chain has some tx backlog?

[31-Oct-19 11:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Morty <> rick trade stuck at 2/3 which is the morty part of the trade I think for about 15 minutes ish

[31-Oct-19 11:26 AM] CrisF#3405
```All electrums are currently disconnected``` error @Sir Seven

[31-Oct-19 11:26 AM] gigamesh#3544
ty @Sir Seven  to clarify , we BOTH get a ticket then?

I can't swap more RICK than 7.76679099 right? Every time I fill in a bigger number, I get this number.

[31-Oct-19 11:26 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@farl don't forget about tx fees.

[31-Oct-19 11:27 AM] gigamesh#3544
@farl why would u want to swap it all anyway?

[31-Oct-19 11:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
accumulate more morty

[31-Oct-19 11:28 AM] farl#9964
Ooh I am confused about the dot and comma. I only have 7.777 RICK, which is not 7777 RICK right?

[31-Oct-19 11:28 AM] gigamesh#3544
there's that bug with the MAX button which shows a crazy high number

[31-Oct-19 11:28 AM] gigamesh#3544
i have 679099 RICK, except i dont

[31-Oct-19 11:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
max shows 7.76 etc

[31-Oct-19 11:29 AM] gigamesh#3544
only when the swap pair is selected

[31-Oct-19 11:29 AM] farl#9964
In my country we use dots and comma's differently with large numbers. Confusing.
