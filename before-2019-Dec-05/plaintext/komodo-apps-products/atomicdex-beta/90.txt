I'm swaping 1:1

[31-Oct-19 12:16 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
But i show no completed oders

[31-Oct-19 12:16 PM] wookie#7663
Do I have to stay on the confirmation page until 3/3 steps are completed?

[31-Oct-19 12:17 PM] ronyi#5719
I have 0,1 rick to 0,1 morty and 0,1morty and 0,1rick orders, but nothing happening..

Same for me....20 open orders...nothing happened

[31-Oct-19 12:18 PM] Artist#0765
I am creating new order for each seap

[31-Oct-19 12:18 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe having so many orders active at the same time is not a good idea.

[31-Oct-19 12:18 PM] RNI#2666
can't set 1 morty

[31-Oct-19 12:18 PM] Artist#0765
Swap

[31-Oct-19 12:18 PM] Artist#0765
Is that ok.

[31-Oct-19 12:18 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
Same here... nothing yesterday it worked well

[31-Oct-19 12:18 PM] ca333#0118
HINT: cancel your non-matched orders and try to swap against the orders with a big volume (one has 1000 and the other one a five figure RICK/MORTY amount) - this will release DEX network resources

[31-Oct-19 12:19 PM] wookie#7663
Tbf 2 swaps went through before the start time.

[31-Oct-19 12:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you can only trade as many as you have utxos availble for. so if you only have one utxo, one trade until the unspent tx outputs return in next block

[31-Oct-19 12:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
414 orders in the books

[31-Oct-19 12:19 PM] ca333#0118
there are MANY hundred orders ongoing - and the orders that are open in a maker-mode (the ones with the cancel button) are preventing most of you to swap

[31-Oct-19 12:19 PM] wookie#7663
Anything after the stress test start time has not gone through

[31-Oct-19 12:20 PM] dudezmobi#1945

you're better off trading sequentially, not all at once

[31-Oct-19 12:20 PM] Artist#0765
Hello anybody?

[31-Oct-19 12:20 PM] modereck#4269
@dudezmobi  maybe the app is processing the order

[31-Oct-19 12:20 PM] wookie#7663
Do I need to stay on the confirmations screen to wait until 3/3 steps are completed?

[31-Oct-19 12:20 PM] modereck#4269
happened to me

[31-Oct-19 12:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@wookie normally no

[31-Oct-19 12:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
you do need to stay in the app

[31-Oct-19 12:21 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
leave app open is best. if you plug into charger, mine stays opne

[31-Oct-19 12:21 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you can go to other screen but dont close app

[31-Oct-19 12:21 PM] Artist#0765
Creating new order for each swap is that ok?

[31-Oct-19 12:21 PM] Artist#0765

[31-Oct-19 12:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Artist best luck to match orderbook I would think

[31-Oct-19 12:22 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@wookie `Do I need to stay on the confirmations screen to wait until 3/3 steps are completed?`
On iOS - yes, on Android you can swap freely in background.

[31-Oct-19 12:22 PM] ronyi#5719
Nothing happening, i canceled my open orders... created new, but step 0/3... so in my side is useless...

[31-Oct-19 12:22 PM] Artist#0765
But is it ok if you create new

[31-Oct-19 12:22 PM] kmd.dex#8716
fuck. swipe faild

[31-Oct-19 12:22 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
dont have to match book, you could outbid it

0/3

[31-Oct-19 12:23 PM] dudezmobi#1945
This is a  frustratingly good stress test

[31-Oct-19 12:23 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
be patient, there is a flood as we begin and the script spammers try things. it should level out

[31-Oct-19 12:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
0/3 just means you are waiting to match

[31-Oct-19 12:23 PM] Mark81#4505
Background services are overloaded on marketmaker 2.0. that has caused everything yo stall.
