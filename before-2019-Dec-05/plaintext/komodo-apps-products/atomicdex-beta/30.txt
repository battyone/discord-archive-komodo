Here's a few thoughts about the atomicdex. I've tried to think about this from the point of view of newbies and how they can get onboard easier. 
First off, really great job! This is going to be awesome when it's done. VERY easy to navigate and to use. I can't wait to see what you guys come up with in terms of improvements. Here's my set of suggestions.

1) sending coins from coinbase/binance  (PC) to the dex involves actually having to type the address out. This can be a nuisance /liability . So a good addition would be to let the app scan the text or a qr code
2) this might be phone specific, but if you can have the address displayed in one line as opposed to the last few characters on the next line, it might be more convenient for users.
3) if I need to leave the app for some reason while I'm about to enter the amt for the swap, when I get back in, the selections and the numbers are gone. So if you can retain those number while the app gets locked, that would be awesome. 
4)It would be nice if you could explicitly explain what the kmd reward is somewhere in the app
5) same as above for the gas needed for transactions
6) I'm not sure if this was by design, but my Rick and morty addresses were the same. I got my rick coins. And when I tried to put the address in morty faucet provided in the email. It mentioned that it was sent to the address. But it never showed up.

Tests in the email 
1) the Rick and morty swap executed perfectly.
2) I tried to swap some the kmd for eth. I got a msg saying "base coin balance is too low to cover gas fee. Need 0.0002" what does this mean? I need to have some eth to be able to swap kmd with eth? I got that same msg when I tried to swap kmd with usdc as per the email.

Hope this helps! Great job guys! It was awesome to be a part of this

[21-Jul-19 12:48 AM] allbits#5898
Yes you need eth in order to acquire eth or usdt. It's because you need to pay for your smart contract that is executing your swap. It's an eth thing.

[21-Jul-19 12:49 AM] ubhillutd#3274
Of course it does. Damn shitcoin :/
Thanks.

[21-Jul-19 12:51 AM] actionslacks#4072
i still recommend we should set up an eth donation address to help get people into kmd and off of the eth plantation. how its distribution could be implemented is beyond me however.

Please, stop testing chainswap, we have reports of issues.

@siu - Chainmakers test chainswap, you mean stop testing the app it self or its a blockchain?

[21-Jul-19 01:24 AM] vichiet#4058
@27aume we find somes bug on the app

[21-Jul-19 01:25 AM] 27aume#8635
Good, me too the app didnt really performed well today. Only load orderbook and histories stopped giving me problem. 
Let me know if you want my logs

- when creating new wallet2 password, red borders for good password that got accepted anyway.

[21-Jul-19 02:26 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I agree... I should be able to swap a penny for a dime.....

That is my 2 cents

[21-Jul-19 04:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@ubhillutd once the desktop app comes out, you shouldnt have that issue any more

[21-Jul-19 05:46 AM] TonyL#3577
@27aume Please send logs after failed swaps
`- logout, create a second wallet2, erased coin list of wallet1 when logging back in. ` - it supposed to be normal behavior at the moment

[21-Jul-19 05:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Please, if you have failed swap - use `Settings` -> `Send feedback` feature to send log file

[21-Jul-19 05:49 AM] t0sma#0368
Someone could explain what happen to founds when they are locked. I don't expect to recover my RVN but to just understand because if it's happen for a big amount. Could be catastrophic. 🤔 🤔

@Oszy 
`I have a failed ETH / VRSC swap, my VRSC went out, not ETH came in`
Please use "Settings -> Send feedback" feature to send logs from app

[21-Jul-19 06:05 AM] TonyL#3577
`Please, stop testing chainswap, we have reports of issues.` - no need to stop, just please `Use "OPTIONS -> SEND FEEDBACK` feature to send LOG after FAILED SWAP`

For now it seems that there is some specific connectivity problem to electrums and more logs after failed swap will help to isolate it.
  
@ubhillutd thak you for a feedback!  advices are great, nice idea to show information message/popup that ETH is needed when in ERC20/ETH part of the swap

[21-Jul-19 06:51 AM] pjgurung#0064
@27aume ? This  is just a test  #atomicdex-beta duh. ..

Send feedback button in app just asks how you what to send it, gives you a screen with various social media and texting apps, or copy to clipboard. Which do I use? (Android 8.0)  @TonyL

[21-Jul-19 01:06 PM] Cryptosaurus#2742
tx history of kmd, rick and rvn does not load. After checking tx history of these coins, tx history of all other coins is also not loading anymore.
Orderbook also not loading anymore, until app is restarted.

[21-Jul-19 01:06 PM] Cryptosaurus#2742
RVN coin was showing balance 10 min ago, after app restart it shows 0 and tx is not loading.

[21-Jul-19 01:09 PM] yorklab#7270
I had that problem also, but when I updated to the latest, 0.1.3-a, it corrected the issue.

[21-Jul-19 01:10 PM] Cryptosaurus#2742
I already on 0.1.3-a and still the same problem..

[21-Jul-19 01:10 PM] t0sma#0368
for me it dont solve the problem with the last version

[21-Jul-19 01:12 PM] ca333#0118
we found a problem with one of the RVN blockchain nodes that is likely the cause of the RVN issues - this is fixed in the next update.

[21-Jul-19 01:13 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptosaurus from log which you DMed me it seems that you have not latest app version (mm2 is outdated), maybe something not uninstalled propertly by "update" button

[21-Jul-19 01:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Could you please try to uninstall/install app? (if you dont have any fund stuck)

[21-Jul-19 01:14 PM] t0sma#0368
I also update via playstore without uninstall.

[21-Jul-19 01:14 PM] Cryptosaurus#2742
Indeed just updated, now trying complete reinstall..

[21-Jul-19 01:15 PM] t0sma#0368
As we discussed in DM @TonyL  I can't uninstall because of my swap RVN/KMD blocked.

[21-Jul-19 01:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, this issue might be related to RVN electrums thing @t0sma

[21-Jul-19 01:20 PM] Cryptosaurus#2742
Problem of tx history is fixed  after reinstalling

[21-Jul-19 01:20 PM] Cryptosaurus#2742

[21-Jul-19 01:21 PM] Cryptosaurus#2742
Are there some issues with the update process?

[21-Jul-19 01:22 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptosaurus could you please send log from app now?

[21-Jul-19 01:22 PM] TonyL#3577
there is mm2 version on top of log - want to compare

[21-Jul-19 01:24 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptosaurus aha! now you have same mm2 as me 😃

[21-Jul-19 01:24 PM] Cryptosaurus#2742
Great 😃

[21-Jul-19 01:25 PM] Cryptosaurus#2742
Order history is stored locally? Because have no history now

[21-Jul-19 01:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Orders histroy wiping on app uninstall

[21-Jul-19 01:27 PM] Cryptosaurus#2742
thought so, would be nice if it can be loaded again.
Especially when there will be desktop app, etc.

[21-Jul-19 01:28 PM] Cryptosaurus#2742
But it's difficult in a decentralized way I guess?

[21-Jul-19 01:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Info about swaps storing locally, so I think it's possible to keep it on uninstalling

[21-Jul-19 01:32 PM] Cryptosaurus#2742
btw after reinstall, orders as marketmaker does show up

[21-Jul-19 01:33 PM] t0sma#0368
I will wait RVN issue is fixed before try to uninstall /reinstall the app.

[21-Jul-19 01:34 PM] cipi#4502
i am about to setup own RVN electrums, the official ones are no good... it syncs, will take a bit till it finishes

[21-Jul-19 01:34 PM] Cryptosaurus#2742
