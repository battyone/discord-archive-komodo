so you dont see the order after you confirm it @FtrSaroth ??

[17-Jul-19 02:32 PM] Alecandro#1179
Is there no way to specify what price you would like to  get for certain assets? Or is this only limited since it‚Äôs a test version?

[17-Jul-19 02:33 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
Yes, i dont see the order, tried several times with different amounts but still not showed  @ca333

[17-Jul-19 02:34 PM] Tony Stark#4609
@Alecandro I wanted to know the some thing...
@ca333

[17-Jul-19 02:34 PM] Tony Stark#4609

[17-Jul-19 02:45 PM] ca333#0118
try a smaller ETH amount @FtrSaroth

[17-Jul-19 02:45 PM] ca333#0118
e.g. 0.01 and let me know if you still get an error

[17-Jul-19 02:46 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
Ok, gonna try and let you know the results üëå

I think it could be nice if on exchange page after u selected coin that u would see how much of the coin u have available

[17-Jul-19 02:57 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
@FtrSaroth I was having the same issue yesterday and today, I tried to create several orders with BAT but nothing ever showed up in the order tab.  I've been wondering if we are not able to actually create a trade/order, we can only accept the trade/orders that are shown

[17-Jul-19 03:02 PM] Vanncoins#3044
Adding to what @cryptoclueless is saying, it isn‚Äôt immediately obvious that creating an order is possible, at first I was under the same impression

[17-Jul-19 03:03 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
I thought I read something about market makers and liquidity, so maybe those of us that aren't set up for market makers/liquidity aren't allowed to actually create trade.

[17-Jul-19 03:04 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
These are small amounts but if you look, the exchange rates favors the market maker by 5-10 percent.  I thought I might be able to set up something like that with BAT but it didn't work.  I even tried to set up a even trade and it didn't work.

[17-Jul-19 03:06 PM] ca333#0118
pls DM @TonyL , @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator or @SHossain your log files @FtrSaroth

[17-Jul-19 03:07 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
Maybe thats why, lets gonna wait what support says, since we are beta testing  @cryptoclueless üëå

[17-Jul-19 03:07 PM] ca333#0118
@cryptoclueless @Vanncoins - thanks for the feedback guys. It is possible to create orders - so the issue is somehwere else. We will investigate this.

[17-Jul-19 03:15 PM] cipi#4502
@Vanncoins beacuse my VRSC balance is 0.3741035... try to sell me some instead or post your own sell orders
error shown on maker is `"error" : "lp_swap:819] !check_i_have_enough_to_trade utxo:1194] VRSC balance 0.3741035000000000 is too low, required 0.37411348`

Found a pretty important bug: when sending coins from atomicDEX wallets, pressing the camera button (for QR code scanning) exits the app

[17-Jul-19 03:16 PM] Vanncoins#3044
Currently using iOS

[17-Jul-19 03:20 PM] CMaurice#1685
I've been trying that KMD VRSC swap some time as well, always fails at 1/3

so. alices cant set an ask price anymore? at the mercy of the best bob price?

[17-Jul-19 03:32 PM] dan.#2473
thats not bad, i just want to be understanding this correctly

[17-Jul-19 03:33 PM] dan.#2473
i suppose that makes sense if the end user cant be a bob now

[17-Jul-19 03:34 PM] dan.#2473
this also actually gives incentive for bobs to be market makers...

[17-Jul-19 03:34 PM] dan.#2473
pretty ingenious

[17-Jul-19 03:36 PM] Alecandro#1179
Well I mean it‚Äôs cool, but what if I want to set a price to sell my assets at? Doesn‚Äôt seem like I currently can

[17-Jul-19 03:36 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
@ca333 Since @Vanncoins  mentioned trying the QR code  for a withdrawal, I figured I'd try to send some BAT out using the QR code on my android phone.  It did not close atomicdex so thats good, and it looked like the withdrawal was successful, but not tx was actually created.  I've tried twice with no transaction.  Not sure how long I should wait, but my BAT balance has not changed.

[17-Jul-19 03:37 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Alecandro you can setup a LP node

[17-Jul-19 03:37 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Details in the pinned messages

[17-Jul-19 03:38 PM] dan.#2473
@Alecandro  if all pairs have liquidity like last time (wasn't it cipi?) that tracked near CMC prices, this will be fine

[17-Jul-19 03:38 PM] dan.#2473
and yes you can always set up a Bob

[17-Jul-19 03:38 PM] dan.#2473
does anyone kknow if there is going to be a GUI or is it just going to be CLI to be a Bob

[17-Jul-19 03:39 PM] Alecandro#1179
Okay, so its just because we're in testing and theres not a lot of liquidity yet?

[17-Jul-19 03:42 PM] cipi#4502
@dan. i use my own perl-script to set/update prices from coinpaprika: https://github.com/cipig/mmtools
no need for a GUI, servers don't have GUIs üòÉ

this might be a dumb question, but is atomic dex only going to be mobile?

Will there ever be a way to deposit USD to atomicdex to buy crypto with? Or is that not possible because you would need relationship with the bank?

@Alecandro would be possible if USD would have a blockchain :-D
we have USDC instead... and DAI too

yea that's what I thought haha just checking! Just wish there was a way to have an onramp without going through places like coinbase

that is all just "easy" stuff, compared to getting a 100% reliable atomicDEX engine

Is there a limit to the amount of orders? I've tried 3 times to do a 5 Qtum > .1 Eth and it submits order but  doesn't show up in orders tab.  Android 9

[17-Jul-19 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
remember this is the first "public" testing, so there have been some rough edges

[17-Jul-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
@Alecandro it is a joke, but the universal KYC requirement, withdraw limits, etc. that are mandated on the CEX by the govt sure is creating a large demand for a noncustodial KYC-free atomicDEX

[17-Jul-19 04:07 PM] Alecandro#1179

[17-Jul-19 04:09 PM] dan.#2473
are we going to do any stress tests like before? to see how many alices can connect to each LP

[17-Jul-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
i saw shossain had almost 10 swaps going at once, on his phone

[17-Jul-19 04:09 PM] benzo365#8202
@ca333 thanks, will try

[17-Jul-19 04:11 PM] Markus#5464
@jl777c 10 waiting swaps to be matched or 10 on going swaps?

[17-Jul-19 04:12 PM] dan.#2473
i think itd be important to test if dICOs are to be a thing again (which they could be with this tech)

[17-Jul-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
a stress test is a good idea. maybe we can have everyone do swaps to the same LP at the same time

[17-Jul-19 04:13 PM] ca333#0118
@dan. the tech is fully ready to carry out dICOs - anyone could create a chain right now - get it listed on atomicDEX mobile and set the ICO orders up.

[17-Jul-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
@Markus i think half a dozen swaps were pending at once, but you need to ask shossain to know for sure

[17-Jul-19 04:14 PM] vichiet#4058
@dan. do you mean dIEO ?

[17-Jul-19 04:14 PM] Alecandro#1179
So I can't remember if anyone asked this or if it got answered yet. Will there be the ability to start a swap and then close the app while it still completes in the future?

[17-Jul-19 04:14 PM] ca333#0118
we have a stresstest coming on an automated infrastructure - we already ran thousands of swaps through that system and will do this in a more coordinated fashion as soon as all beta testers are onboarded - which thb is already some sort of stress-test.

[17-Jul-19 04:15 PM] vichiet#4058
@ca333 how many tester do we have now ?
