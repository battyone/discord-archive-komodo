[25-Jul-19 01:45 PM] Oszy#5734
i was stupid using the title as well before üòÑ

[25-Jul-19 01:48 PM] wl#4107
you did it?

[25-Jul-19 01:48 PM] Oszy#5734
yeah

[25-Jul-19 01:49 PM] wl#4107
you bastard LoL

[25-Jul-19 01:49 PM] wl#4107
what was it?

[25-Jul-19 01:49 PM] Oszy#5734
first 12 BIP words of the news

[25-Jul-19 01:50 PM] Oszy#5734
which i tried for days i was stupid enough to include a word from the title that's why it didn't work üòÑ

[25-Jul-19 01:50 PM] wl#4107
but i did try the first 12 words

[25-Jul-19 01:51 PM] Oszy#5734
BIP words, not just words

[25-Jul-19 01:51 PM] Oszy#5734
not any word can be a seed word

especially if it's a puzzle and coming from tech guys üòÑ

[25-Jul-19 01:52 PM] Oszy#5734
news article was basically a stegoseed

[25-Jul-19 01:52 PM] Oszy#5734
which you can unhide easily to see only the bip words

[25-Jul-19 01:52 PM] wl#4107
oh, ok

@weldon.gull5 - btw, i forgot to mention: check #dex-hyperdex if you are looking for a Desktop DEX GUI

[25-Jul-19 02:36 PM] nasbats#7785
Not sure if this is the right place for this, but I'm starting to play around with the atomicdex CLI on linux. I've completed the walkthroughs for RICK/MORTY, as well as KMD/LTC in the 'how to be a LP".  I've managed to figure out how to launch an electrum coin, by copying the LTCconnect.sh and replacing the neccesary info to launch, say, RICK, but where can I find the info for launching DOGE, or RFOX for example? I can get RPCports from the coins file, but what about URLs?

i could swear i tried that :/

[25-Jul-19 03:01 PM] dogracer#3298
nice job @Oszy

[25-Jul-19 04:09 PM] dogracer#3298
That little word "you" in the news article kept this from being exactly the first 12 BIP words. @Oszy had wise Spidey sense not to include that one.

Now I'm super curious about the seed words used in atomicDEX. Is it strictly BIP39? Or is it using a modified list of words that excludes words like "you"?

Or perhaps there was another hint tucked away that indicated one should ignore that BIP word...?

[25-Jul-19 05:20 PM] phm87#7395
On android PlayStore, I can preregister but I can't download and install it. Is it a trick ? (Allow unthrusted sources maybe) or install apk manually ?

[25-Jul-19 05:22 PM] phm87#7395
Mmmhhh ... maybe I should register somewhere before. I did no registration nor anything. Should I do sth before ?

[25-Jul-19 05:22 PM] Oszy#5734
did you sign up for beta testing before?

[25-Jul-19 05:23 PM] Oszy#5734
only the invited people can download

[25-Jul-19 05:23 PM] phm87#7395
No

[25-Jul-19 05:23 PM] Oszy#5734
so that's why

[25-Jul-19 05:24 PM] phm87#7395
Who should I ask about sign up as beta tester ?

[25-Jul-19 05:24 PM] Oszy#5734
you can do it on the website

[25-Jul-19 05:24 PM] phm87#7395
Ok thx

Www.atomicdex.io <> atomicdex.io

[25-Jul-19 05:55 PM] Oszy#5734
it was created by letsencrypt i think it has a limit to 1 subdomain

[25-Jul-19 05:55 PM] Oszy#5734
for free

[25-Jul-19 06:22 PM] bartwr#6773
@Oszy LetsEncrypt / certbot is great, and fortunately supports multiple (sub) domains for free. So `https://www.domain` and `https://domain` can both have SSL certificates. To make it work, nginx or similar should be configured for this. /sidenote

[25-Jul-19 06:25 PM] Oszy#5734
ah okay, last time i tried i  had problem setting up  two. my bad  then üòÑ

[25-Jul-19 07:20 PM] Oszy#5734
on ios you need the testflight app

[25-Jul-19 07:21 PM] allbits#5898
I have not been able to see offerings for about half an hour

[25-Jul-19 07:23 PM] cipi#4502
@allbits which coin/pair?

[25-Jul-19 07:27 PM] gnarbill#7799
Play store says app not available when I click the invite link. My account is the same as the email I received the invite. Am I missing something?

kmd orderbooks not showing

[25-Jul-19 07:32 PM] allbits#5898
,,,, and now they're back haha - they were not showing for about half an hour

[25-Jul-19 07:38 PM] cipi#4502
no orderbook at all, or only specific coins? atm, the txfee on ETH chain is gigantic, so my node removed all ERC20 orders... that is why i asked

[25-Jul-19 07:41 PM] Nico79#6373
Stupid question, have just received the mail as an invitation to use the AtomicDex on iOS.  How can I load the DEX?  It's not in the store ü§∑üèº‚ôÇÔ∏è What do I have to do?  Thank you

[25-Jul-19 07:42 PM] allbits#5898
There were no orderbooks for kmd, for any Kmd pair. I did not check others

[25-Jul-19 07:43 PM] acidbird#7266
Where we can get testflight invitation code?

[25-Jul-19 07:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Invitations will be sent to all iOS testers soon, at the moment iOS application fresh release is in propagation/Apple approval stage and will be available for testing in 1-2 days.
Thank you for patience!

Ok, thx ‚úåüèº

[25-Jul-19 08:12 PM] Jcharming#2693
Is this where I can ask questions about the AtomicDEX?  or is this channel only for feedback?

Please reopen app and try again with "fast encryption" mode enabled

[25-Jul-19 08:39 PM] nitrospawn#6261
Went back clicked on fast encryption and still the same will close app and reopen now

[25-Jul-19 08:40 PM] Jcharming#2693
Thanks @TonyL   I just opened up the app and I saw the create or restore option.  Does atomicDEX have it's own wallet  setup process, and if so is it safe/is it different from the agama problem that happened a while ago?   I'm just looking for info before I create a wallet,

[25-Jul-19 08:41 PM] nitrospawn#6261
@TonyL  how long does a decryption take

[25-Jul-19 08:42 PM] TonyL#3577
@nitrospawn usually it taking around 5-10 seconds on my Android phone (Xiaomi Redmi Note 5)

[25-Jul-19 08:42 PM] TonyL#3577
@Jcharming It's totally different from Agama, have separate codebase written in another language and with very low amount of external dependencies. So it can be considered as safe. But please note that it's in beta stage now - so some bugs might presists still.

[25-Jul-19 08:44 PM] Jcharming#2693
Thank you, I don't intend to use it to store amounts, I was just curious about the wallet and its dependencies as compared to agama.  Do you know if Agama is working and safe to start using again?

[25-Jul-19 08:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Verus Agama is safe to use (it dont have vulnerability connected with hack), at the moment Verus developing Agama wallet project

[25-Jul-19 08:45 PM] nitrospawn#6261

[25-Jul-19 08:47 PM] TonyL#3577
@nitrospawn please try to create new wallet - since last encryption attempt hanged on your side maybe this one is unfinished/corrupted on preparation stage state

[25-Jul-19 08:47 PM] TonyL#3577
@gnarbill please DM me your email associated with playmarket account

[25-Jul-19 08:47 PM] nitrospawn#6261
@TonyL ok

[25-Jul-19 08:48 PM] gnarbill#7799
@TonyL will do

[25-Jul-19 08:49 PM] nitrospawn#6261
@TonyL the password creation style might be dificult to remember 12 words !

[25-Jul-19 08:49 PM] TonyL#3577
It's not a password but seed. It's the most important "key" for your wallet

[25-Jul-19 08:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Write down it in some safe place

[25-Jul-19 08:50 PM] TonyL#3577
It's a thing which not changing often so creation/saving process should be reliable so user definetly will not lost access to it

[25-Jul-19 08:52 PM] nitrospawn#6261
Created a new wallet and it took 5 seconds
