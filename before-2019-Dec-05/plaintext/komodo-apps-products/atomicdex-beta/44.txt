since the update when i try to swap after i input the first coin quantity and i want to choose the coin to swap it to, it stops on the"loading orderbook..." process, i tried deleting the cache and one time it worked when i retried immediately after returned to not working.

[01-Aug-19 07:33 AM] gcharang#6833
@criptobear backup the seed and reinstall
we are aware of the issue should be fixed for the next update

[01-Aug-19 08:01 AM] Oszy#5734
@花果山 mate you have like 40 RICK and keep asking, every hour, it's not just annoying but pointless, you're not even making swaps.

[01-Aug-19 08:02 AM] gcharang#6833
he had 7.7 before
I just sent the rest

[01-Aug-19 10:04 AM] 花果山#5224
@Oszy   I have a deal in version 0.14. After the update of 1.5, what transaction records are gone.

[01-Aug-19 10:06 AM] gcharang#6833
@花果山 the rick and morty chains have been migrated
the ones in the 0.15 version are new chains, so there is a need for new balances

[01-Aug-19 10:09 AM] 花果山#5224
I understand that I have asked for it many times, only you gave me a coin. But @Oszy is not clear.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #66: \[Discussion\] \- Orders should be display as cumulated in the order book
Clue is that on CEX by one "buy" action you can fill orders of N sellers, but in DEX your trade performing with one seller only at a time. As I see some additional logic on GUI side is needed to implement trading mechanism similar to what you explaining. If there are two 900 and 900 volume orders, to buy lets say 1100 at once you'll need two swaps actually with first seller and second one what will require double taker fees, tx fees + part of the swap might fail and interface should handle it...

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #66: \[Discussion\] \- Orders should be display as cumulated in the order book
I definitely agree with `So a lot of additional logic is needed`. But I believe this is pure front-end logic.
Maybe the protocol itself could offer such functionality in the future as well.

*I actually believe the benefits would be great for low liquidity markets.*
For high liquidity market it would not really matter.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #66: \[Discussion\] \- Orders should be display as cumulated in the order book
exactly - with the difference that we should not limit the required modifications on the GUI side since all trade-related operations are handled on the atomicDEX-API layer (backend). Although it could be implemented on the frontend, a backend implementation would make more sense and resolve this more efficiently since all GUIs and even CLI traders could profit from this. However, it does sound much like a future feature request for mm2 OR a trading-bot implementation for atomicDEX mobile wher...

[01-Aug-19 11:25 AM] phm87#7395
A small bug (sorry if it was already noticed):
I had orders to sell rick and morty before the new rick and morty chains. When new chans replaced old ones, my portfolio balances of rick and morty went to 0 (ok) but my existing orders selling rick and morty are still there ... I have no clues what will happen if these orders are matched (old or new coins ?).
Thank you

basically, I deposited about 0.0011btc  btc hitting 'max' restricted me to 0.00039, and then there were two orders for btc -> kmd, but as I could only set max of 0.00039 it only let me swap 3.9 kmd, but order looked to have huge liquidity, so i thought I should be able to swop all of my 0.001, not only 0.00039. and then 2 minutes later I got "invalid arguments" when i clicked to select which kmd order i'd like to fill

@goldenman because you need to pay gas to execute the swap contract

@ninjanoel minimum swap amount is 0.00777... this limitation will be removed in future versions

[02-Aug-19 03:52 PM] ninjanoel#2096
oh... so it was misbehaving cause i didn't hit the minimum?

[02-Aug-19 03:53 PM] cipi#4502
yes, looks like the GUI doesn't deal very well with this limitation... the problem will disappear when the limitation is removed from the underlying mm2

@saskboy there are RICK/MORTY faucets in pinned messages.
 1% per hour it's quite good actually, AtomicDEX backend working in background on Android so on you can perform swap even with minimized app. I'm afraid that such "FIX NOW" button will close it.

[02-Aug-19 11:58 PM] saskboy#5198
Because it's Decentralized, I suppose if the app is closed, there's no other server running to maintain communication.

@gcharang i mean i set 11 orders with my max amount of morty and rick vs different coins, on other exchanges you can only set 1 order, i am pretty sure i red somewhere at atomicdex you can set 5 different orders... Still all my orders dissapeared

[03-Aug-19 10:02 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, this is a feature called "liquidity multiplier"
same coins can be offered for different trades and all the offers are valid till atleast one offer is accepted by someone else
then the rest of the offers for the same coins should disappear

do you think something like the above caould have happened to your orders?
i.e., 2 trades matched. one for rick and other for morty; which made all the other offers invalid
