Why is the minimum trading amount so high in this testphase

[08-Nov-19 01:45 PM] CoinKing88#1540
trying to sell 25 KMD for btc but minimum trade is 0,0777. Bit lame that i need to put so "much" on to the app to test it

[08-Nov-19 01:46 PM] cipi#4502
BTC txfee is 1$, so trading lesser then 100$ of BTC makes no sense

[08-Nov-19 01:46 PM] CoinKing88#1540
So if i trade kmd for dex i can do lower trades?

[08-Nov-19 01:47 PM] cipi#4502
yes, min. trade is 0.0077 and it applies to all coins

[08-Nov-19 01:47 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Oh wait, kmd uses btc hashing power

[08-Nov-19 01:47 PM] CoinKing88#1540
i understand, so its a bit of a bottleneck for smaller trades

[08-Nov-19 01:47 PM] Oszy#5734
That has nothing to do with it.

[08-Nov-19 01:47 PM] cipi#4502
yes, for coins with high txfees, like BTC... and sometimes ERC20

[08-Nov-19 01:51 PM] CoinKing88#1540
So basically the DEX is not useful for transferring small amounts of money/value? Edit: wrong example. With mass adoption, most ppl will be transferring smaller amounts i imagine. Not everyone is a whale moving 2BTC around all the time.

[08-Nov-19 01:51 PM] Acura#2748
It's not a bug - minimal swap amount is 0.00777 determined by protocol and the same for all coins. I'm agree that it's quite high amount in USD equialent. But from another side it's better to trade huge amounts of BTC because of tx fees.

[08-Nov-19 01:53 PM] cipi#4502
use something else other the bTC or ERC20, eg BCH or LTC or KMD and you can transfer low amounts of money

[08-Nov-19 01:53 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Ah oke, ill give it a try

[08-Nov-19 01:55 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Oh now i get it, i only activated BTC KMD and DEX so i only saw those available orders to choose from to swap with

[08-Nov-19 01:56 PM] CoinKing88#1540
1 tip: it would be usefull to see not only the logo's but also the names in the "avaiable orders" screen. I don't know all the logo's and the logo for BTC and BCH are the same

[08-Nov-19 02:14 PM] Oszy#5734
it's mirrored üòõ

[08-Nov-19 02:18 PM] CoinKing88#1540
It worked, i am now the proud owner of 0,27 LTC. So the guy who put up the sell order of LTC didn't know what he would get for it in return?

[08-Nov-19 02:18 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Or did he need to accept my swap?

[08-Nov-19 02:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Guy on other side put the order like a sell X of coin A for Y of coin B

[08-Nov-19 02:24 PM] TonyL#3577
So he knew the deal rules üòÖ

[08-Nov-19 02:24 PM] CoinKing88#1540
So he put up a sell for KMD - LTC not just sell LTC @ price x

I made a small recap of my first trade on the dutch Tweakers.net Crypto forum, its a very nice app (looks and tech) and great advertisement for Komodo in general üëç

Does anybody have experience with electron chainswap?

[08-Nov-19 09:18 PM] phm87#7395
@coingirl87 I don't know about the zeros, maybe it is a measurement error and I don't know from where the graph is coming from, here is what I see on google trends about atomicdex : https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=atomicdex

[08-Nov-19 09:51 PM] Oszy#5734
@lollipop you mean the dex chainswap by chainmakers?

[08-Nov-19 10:00 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
@ca333 @TonyL  put an order up.... canceled it and it went through anyway

[09-Nov-19 05:38 AM] lollipop#1682
@Oszy yes

[09-Nov-19 05:58 AM] Jimm B.#9993
have swapped kmd for doge and doge for kmd.  was surprised by the 10 doge transaction fees.  are they really that high?

[09-Nov-19 05:59 AM] Jimm B.#9993
in $ it is not much but when you get used to the 0.0001 of KMD + Ecosystem, it seems pretty high.

[09-Nov-19 06:05 AM] gcharang#6833
<https://multidoge.org/help/v0.1/help_whatIsTheTransactionFee.html>
> 1 doge per 1 kb of txn size

[09-Nov-19 06:10 AM] Jimm B.#9993
so there is no way to get rid of the dust left over?

[09-Nov-19 06:15 AM] gcharang#6833
no way through atomicDEX directly
one solution is to import the private key into a doge wallet with balance and let the dust be used there in a future transaction

any way doge dust should be of very low value
other than cluttering the ui, there is no harm I think

[09-Nov-19 06:20 AM] Jimm B.#9993
You're right, it has almost no value.  I just do not like dustüòè .  first I thought of a donate button in the app ... but if you can not send the dust ...

[09-Nov-19 07:27 AM] coingirl87#6489
@phm87 thanks but there are also sometimes zero request...dont know what it means...also dont know what y axis means....

[09-Nov-19 07:28 AM] coingirl87#6489
Only 100 people searching for atomic dex?

[09-Nov-19 08:01 AM] D3b0#9761
Hi,when we can expect next stress test or full atomic dex? Ty

[09-Nov-19 08:24 AM] Jimm B.#9993
@coingirl87
Interest over time

 The values ‚Äã‚Äãindicate the search interest relative to the highest point in the chart for the selected region in the specified time period.  The value 100 stands for the highest popularity of this search term.  The value 50 means that the term is half as popular and the value 0 means that there was not enough data for this term.

[09-Nov-19 08:26 AM] lollipop#1682
Chow do I get in contact with chainmakers?

[09-Nov-19 08:26 AM] jorian#4555
i am from chainmakers

[09-Nov-19 08:26 AM] jorian#4555
what's up?

[09-Nov-19 08:27 AM] lollipop#1682
Just lost 8 DEX and 200 kmd

[09-Nov-19 08:27 AM] lollipop#1682
Didn't make a swap or anything

[09-Nov-19 08:27 AM] lollipop#1682
It was just randomly transfered

[09-Nov-19 08:28 AM] jorian#4555
let's move to dm

[09-Nov-19 09:19 AM] coingirl87#6489
@Jimm B. ok thank you but a nominal value would be better....100 dont tell us how much people searching for atomic dexü§î

[09-Nov-19 11:40 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Sold some KMD for BTC but the "0/3 order matching" screen is taking very long? What is causing it, the app or the BTC chain?

[09-Nov-19 11:43 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Hmm, i cancelled the order, tried again and it worked instantly

[09-Nov-19 12:12 PM] Oszy#5734
if you tried full available amount for any of the coins, reducing it a little will make it trough

[09-Nov-19 12:19 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Maybe my wifi was gone for a second? I did not try full amount both times.

[09-Nov-19 12:27 PM] Oszy#5734
could be the amount was not avaiable as the maker had another swap started in the meantime

[09-Nov-19 12:27 PM] Oszy#5734
just have to redo it sometimes if it doesn't match in 20-30 seconds

[09-Nov-19 12:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
From experience, if it doesnt match within the first minute, better to remove and retry

[09-Nov-19 02:32 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I dont think cancel order button is working correct....I had a bunch of old canceled Rick and Morty trades go through

[09-Nov-19 02:36 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Needs a redundant double check before it is deleted @local

[09-Nov-19 02:42 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
It would be a "major" "high priority" bug if what I witnessed is true

[09-Nov-19 02:43 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Can you imagine making an accidental trade 1 BTC for 1 KMD - canceling it and it goes through anyway?

[09-Nov-19 02:57 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
There is a check to confirm the order

If you place an order and it gets accepted before the nodes get your request to remove the order then that‚Äôs the way it goes hence the warning when you confirm your exchange request

[09-Nov-19 03:10 PM] MorganJekyll#8355
KMD/AXE swaps keep failing

[09-Nov-19 03:21 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Some were days old

[09-Nov-19 03:21 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Just FYI

[09-Nov-19 03:22 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Make sure to block trade on GUI side

[09-Nov-19 03:22 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
After cancel button is pressed....easy peasy

[09-Nov-19 03:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I just got another Rick morty swap that's not in GUI books

[09-Nov-19 03:27 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
So ther IS a problem

[09-Nov-19 03:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes there is especially with order displays ,  I think this is more than a propagation issue

[09-Nov-19 03:29 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
DB somewhere

[09-Nov-19 03:30 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Maybe (sell until volume = 0) is accidentally left open in code...

[09-Nov-19 03:30 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Probably not

[09-Nov-19 04:00 PM] Oszy#5734
@kmdkrazy  please open a github issue with screenshots explaining it as much as you can

Got an issue with withdrawing: used the camera to scan the qr code of the receive adress from my ledger. The app says that it's not a valid adress.
