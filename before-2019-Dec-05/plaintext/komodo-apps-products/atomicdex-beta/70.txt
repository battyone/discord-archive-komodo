It should be interesting if they can't be listed on normal exchanges. Although it's a tron token. We have to see if they can be integrated

Is there a way to see if there is any liquidity for a coin without depositing it to the wallet?

[23-Sep-19 10:17 AM] gcharang#6833
for now, you can use: https://www.oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/
or the mm2 directly through terminal : <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API>

[23-Sep-19 10:21 AM] scubapanda#2485
Thanks!

[23-Sep-19 10:28 AM] scubapanda#2485
I think the oracle orderbook shows nothing available for HUSH but the Android app shows 2.

[23-Sep-19 10:33 AM] gcharang#6833
@scubapanda thats true
the maintainer: @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator is on a break and didn't update the coins file recently
so orders for coins listed earlier are there but not the new ones

[23-Sep-19 10:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

Ok. Just asking because HUSH trades didn't go through. Others I tried worked ok.

cliff from cardano foundation. dex looks good. havent heard back from marketing. i have the iohk team to help integrate.  when ada? haha

[23-Sep-19 10:35 AM] cliffc#7390
i own kmd too btw

[23-Sep-19 10:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
integrating Cardano would need a chat with the devs, if not a erc20 or btc clone its pretty technical

[23-Sep-19 10:41 AM] cliffc#7390
great i can ask the iohk devs to get in on the convo

Is the volume in kmd?

[23-Sep-19 11:45 AM] hastrup#8742
On the oracle.earth?

[23-Sep-19 11:51 AM] Markus#5464
doesnt volume mean trade amount available on the atomicdex?

[23-Sep-19 11:54 AM] hastrup#8742
@Markus trade amount in what crypto?

[23-Sep-19 11:58 AM] Markus#5464
on the website its the coin u trade against kmd

[23-Sep-19 11:58 AM] Markus#5464
cause i doubt there is 205870 kmd available in trade against doge so it have to be doge

Saw that earlier too.

[23-Sep-19 05:11 PM] cipi#4502
2 electrum servers had this in the log
`[Sep23 12:55] TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 10064. Sending cookies.  Check SNMP counters.`
10064 is the port of the HUSH electrum
times are in UTC
does it match with the above error?

[23-Sep-19 06:04 PM] Seko#7408
18:30 - 18:45 MEZ...

[23-Sep-19 06:30 PM] scubapanda#2485
I think I had that red screen about 9 hours ago.

[23-Sep-19 06:47 PM] cipi#4502
does not really fit
i tuned a parameter, so the synflood should not happen any more
if it is related, the red screen should not return, if it does, it is something else

[23-Sep-19 07:05 PM] PTYX#6840

Hi everyone.  look here.  the swap did not work.  my KMD are still gone!  is there an explanation?

[24-Sep-19 03:12 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Should be refunded within 4 hours or so

[24-Sep-19 03:13 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
In the meanwhile please get logs and give to @gcharang or @TonyL

[24-Sep-19 05:27 AM] cryptoclueless#9519
I've tried 7 qtum swaps and all have failed. 5 to kmd and 2 to Ltc. Each time about 0.01 qtum is removed from my balance.  I'm assuming all funds should be returned with a failed swap, correct?

[24-Sep-19 05:54 AM] ReyMysterio#1026
I did not receive anything back

[24-Sep-19 07:40 AM] TonyL#3577
@ReyMysterio Please DM me your applicaiton log (you can send it via settings)
@cryptoclueless In case of failed swaps please send the logs. `about 0.01 qtum is removed from my balance` it should be the fee - fee not refunding, only payment itself refunding if swap not happened

[24-Sep-19 09:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
my Bob appears to have been on the other side of 4 of those trades - each failed with `TakerPaymentValidateFailed`

@hastrup most LBRY users are non-crypto users, so I don't think we'll be pursuing that anytime soon.  Depending on what the process looks like, maybe a community member can give it a shot. I know there was some Dex that did support LBRY, don't recall if it was Komodo or something else.

I can't find the link on how to add a coin on atomicdex

[24-Sep-19 01:39 PM] cipi#4502
@hastrup LBC already works just fine on AtomicDEX: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins#L2774
but it is not in the electrumx-code, so no mobile usage possible... in order to add LBC, it must be added to electrumx first: https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx

@cipi

[24-Sep-19 01:45 PM] cipi#4502
make a PR to the electrumx repo, just like the other coins, eg: https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx/commit/3fc3a2cc25589e8776e64b08f5dce9596ed6af1c
and then someone needs to run a couple of those electrums, so people can connect to them

We run our own spv servers already as a fork of electrumx ....so we may just be able to use those. It may require some modification on their end though

look here: https://github.com/jl777/coins/tree/master/electrums
there we "collect" the infos about the electrums for the different coins... if LBC electrums are working, we can add them there
