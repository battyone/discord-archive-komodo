being told i need ETH for a tx fee

[21-Oct-19 11:04 AM] gigamesh#3544
i have to send ETH to the address before being able to but ETH?

[21-Oct-19 11:04 AM] ca333#0118
yes thats correct @gigamesh - buying ETH or ERC tokens requires a small amount of ETH for the ETH-side transactions gas fees

How to Restore Wallet from Your Seed Using AtomicDEX Mobile
1. Launch the AtomicDEX Mobile app.  2. Tap the "RESTORE" button.    3. Give a memorable name to...

[21-Oct-19 12:01 PM] gcharang#6833
@gigamesh this seed phrase will be valid in the other Komodo ecosystem wallets like: Verus Agama, Verus mobile, hyperDEX, chainswap etc.,
the same seed phrase may not produce the same address+privkey in other wallets

the best way to have access to your address from any wallet: cli, komodo ecosystem wallets, outside wallets is to backup the wif
wif - a string of characters that start with "U" for Komodo

you can convert a seed to wif in the Verus Agama wallet or the Komodo Ocean QT wallet
Verus Agama:<https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024495-export-private-key-wif-from-a-wallet-seed-or-pin-password>
Ocean QT: <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000030461-convert-your-seed-phrase-from-agama-into-a-private-key->

[21-Oct-19 12:02 PM] gcharang#6833
currently there is no way to login to atomicDEX/export with a wif, but it will come

[21-Oct-19 12:12 PM] gigamesh#3544
so in short the answer is no not now, but soon. thanks for the detailed reply

[21-Oct-19 12:13 PM] gigamesh#3544
as you probably know I am asking for those with tin-foil hats who may not trust you to delete the seed phrase from your servers

[21-Oct-19 12:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
pin encrypted seed phrase is store on device, and not transmitted to servers

Will AtomicDEX be added to blockfolio or will blockfolio retrieve AtomicDEX pricing when selecting BarterDEX?

[21-Oct-19 03:31 PM] Jimm B.#9993
if one assumes that several DEX use MM2, would not it make sense to add MM2 to blockfolio?ü§î

[21-Oct-19 03:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
barterdex is added to blockfolio

[21-Oct-19 03:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I assume atomicdex/MM2.0 volume/prices will be as well after a while when the necessary volume requirements are met and blockfolio can connect to the required API

[21-Oct-19 03:38 PM] Jimm B.#9993
Thanks but that does not answer my questions.üòÖ

@gigamesh that is the whole mm2 orderbook not just atomicDEX

[21-Oct-19 04:00 PM] Oszy#5734
CHIPS and everything in this list: (where it says "mm2":1) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jl777/coins/master/coins 
is listed and can be traded with marketmaker2 which is the engine for the atomicDEX mobile app

[21-Oct-19 04:01 PM] Oszy#5734
atomicDEX is a mobile GUI for maketmaker2, and has it's on listing policy / schedule / cost

[21-Oct-19 04:22 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
*coins on that list with `"mm2":1`

I just tried to pull 3.99 ZEC off Polo and send to my Dex ....they said it was an invalid address??? I copied it right from Dex and verified all the digits. So now my ZEC is gone from my Polo wallet and Not in my Dex either. I went to ZCash block explorer and searched the address that my Dex provided me with ... the block explorer said ‚Äúsorry, can‚Äôt find that address ‚Äú Heeeeellp.

if there is no tx id they did not send it and you can contact them to credit back to you

This sounds like a Polo deal ... like they won‚Äôt allow tx to a decentralized exchange

[21-Oct-19 08:21 PM] ca333#0118
@TonyLipsey thanks for the info - please contact polo and ask them to resolve this. I will look into the wallet now and check if we can just provide t1 address in there. But as stated above - the addresses are valid, just diff. format: https://explorer.zcha.in/accounts/t1V3CMUxXJHWupN1QvQmk4bS1QvzBAjyUjb - micro test transaction is now visible.

Thank you!

[21-Oct-19 08:36 PM] ca333#0118
@TonyLipsey we will update the wallet so it has the expected format with the `t1` prefix - although its already "valid" it likely won't be accepted by most TX engines as these validate an address differently. AtomicDEX decodes the address and manages to send the coins even if an ordinary address validator would return `false` (= invalid). Sorry for the inconvenience. Our internal tests didn't catch this one as the differently formatted address is technically/mathematically valid. I will let you know when the new version is out.

[21-Oct-19 08:37 PM] Oszy#5734
Until then, if anyone wants to withdraw to atomicDEX just put your address in explorer to see the matching `t` address

providing liquidity isn't any team-members responsibility as this could result in various complications - a DEX liquidity pool likely results out of a natural market formation

With the introduction of 2.4 I end in a 'black screen' on my iPhone 8+ iOS 12.4.1. When trying previous builds (2.2 and 2.3) they have the same issue now as well. I did swap succesfully with 2.2 though. Very weird.
