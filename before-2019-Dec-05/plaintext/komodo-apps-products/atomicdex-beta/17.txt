we will never ask for your seed

[17-Jul-19 05:21 PM] Markus#5464
@SHossain do u think it would be possible later on to add so u can see valueation of each coin while creating a trade?

[17-Jul-19 05:22 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, it might be possible

[17-Jul-19 05:22 PM] SHossain#0007
if you don't have a github account, post me with details of what you want, i'll create a feature request

[17-Jul-19 05:22 PM] Markus#5464
Alright will do later

[17-Jul-19 05:24 PM] Malti#3948
I put some more funds on my test wallet and will test the 'claim rewards' function tomorrow

[17-Jul-19 05:26 PM] allbits#5898
What is KMD address for DEX? So we can see fees happening in real time

[17-Jul-19 05:26 PM] Malti#3948
it's nice that the app populates your max amount when you put more then you have (e.g. 100000 eth will translate into 0.008 ETH now for me) , however the 'fee' is not included so when I want to confirm the trade it gives me the insufficient funds box

[17-Jul-19 05:28 PM] Malti#3948
i think it's my balance that is the problem and not the logic

[17-Jul-19 05:28 PM] SHossain#0007
@allbits KMD and DEX coin has same address that starts with `R`

[17-Jul-19 05:28 PM] allbits#5898
I'm asking what KMD address the fees go to

[17-Jul-19 05:29 PM] Malti#3948
@SHossain clicking on a coin and seeing the 'trade' option next to 'send' and 'receive would be nice as well

[17-Jul-19 05:30 PM] SHossain#0007
@allbits this is the DEX fee address https://kmdexplorer.ru/address/RThtXup6Zo7LZAi8kRWgjAyi1s4u6U9Cpf

[17-Jul-19 05:31 PM] SHossain#0007
@Malti it is already there. i requested it a month ago

[17-Jul-19 05:31 PM] Malti#3948
and fee calculation is the failing factor for max amount trades

[17-Jul-19 05:32 PM] SHossain#0007

[17-Jul-19 05:32 PM] SHossain#0007
check this screenshot

[17-Jul-19 05:32 PM] Malti#3948
hmm, can't see it on iOS, possible?

[17-Jul-19 05:32 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to long press on coin name

[17-Jul-19 05:32 PM] SHossain#0007
wait, let me check iOS

[17-Jul-19 05:32 PM] Malti#3948
aha, i more meant when you short click the coin

[17-Jul-19 05:32 PM] Malti#3948
i'm on it

[17-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Malti#3948
ah yes

[17-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Malti#3948
long press then it appears

[17-Jul-19 05:33 PM] SHossain#0007
there you go

[17-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Malti#3948
but when you 'click' it, then there is only the send receive claim

[17-Jul-19 05:33 PM] SHossain#0007
i wanted 3D touch implementation in there

[17-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Malti#3948
trade would also be a good one (or swap to keep terminilogy)

[17-Jul-19 05:33 PM] SHossain#0007
let me create an in issue then

[17-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Malti#3948
3D touch adoption is super limited

[17-Jul-19 05:34 PM] SHossain#0007
you have so many ideas that will be forgotten if we dont' create issues

[17-Jul-19 05:34 PM] Malti#3948
ihahah, but can I just create them in Gitbhub? I don't wanna spam your project

[17-Jul-19 05:34 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, of course you can

[17-Jul-19 05:35 PM] SHossain#0007
anyone with a github account is free to create feature request and report bugs

[17-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Malti#3948
awesome

[17-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Malti#3948
you can also swipe to reveal the send receive swap part

[17-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Malti#3948
nice

[17-Jul-19 05:35 PM] SHossain#0007
the link is in this channel's topic or in pinned posts

[17-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Malti#3948
a little 'boink' of your top coins when you open your app up would reveal that that is an optio

[17-Jul-19 05:35 PM] SHossain#0007
there are lots of feature we already have üòä

[17-Jul-19 05:36 PM] Malti#3948

[17-Jul-19 05:37 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe a swipe left gesture on a specific coin can open atomic swap view with that coin pre-populated would be nice too?

[17-Jul-19 05:37 PM] SHossain#0007
just an idea

[17-Jul-19 05:38 PM] Malti#3948
just something to show that there is the quick menu

[17-Jul-19 05:39 PM] Malti#3948
as the bot didn't post something on my earlier topic, i'll create it now in github (the one where the click on the coin also gives you the trade option)

[17-Jul-19 05:39 PM] SHossain#0007
every issue that you create on the repo will be posted here üòÉ

so, users don't have to repeat same thingss and everyone can see what issues or feature requests we already have before creating a new one

We can claim the 5% rewards too? üòç

[17-Jul-19 05:44 PM] Malti#3948
yes, if they are bigger than x amount. I loaded some more funds on my test wallet to locktime it and test tomorrow, will update

[17-Jul-19 05:44 PM] benzo365#8202
This is great

[17-Jul-19 05:44 PM] Alecandro#1179
so got to have at least 10KMD min right?

[17-Jul-19 05:44 PM] benzo365#8202
Yes

[17-Jul-19 05:44 PM] Malti#3948
to have it to lock, yes

[17-Jul-19 05:45 PM] Malti#3948
but I guess the minimum claim amount is 0.1 KMD

[17-Jul-19 05:45 PM] benzo365#8202
Best to wait a bit of you'll be charged more in fees to retrieve

[17-Jul-19 05:45 PM] benzo365#8202
*or

[17-Jul-19 05:45 PM] Malti#3948
just to confirm @SHossain , when closing the app on 2/3 during swap, it completes

[17-Jul-19 05:45 PM] Malti#3948
on iOS

[17-Jul-19 05:46 PM] SHossain#0007
nice

[17-Jul-19 05:46 PM] SHossain#0007
is it same always?

[17-Jul-19 05:46 PM] SHossain#0007
how many swaps you have completed like that?

[17-Jul-19 05:46 PM] Malti#3948
2 now

[17-Jul-19 05:46 PM] SHossain#0007
i know for sure on Android it works fine for all trades

[17-Jul-19 05:46 PM] Malti#3948
gonna do another one where i put it in flight mode when on 2/3

[17-Jul-19 05:47 PM] Malti#3948
to be 100% offline

[17-Jul-19 05:47 PM] SHossain#0007
we need at least 100 trades like that with 100% success rate :abused_smiley:

[17-Jul-19 05:47 PM] SHossain#0007
if you need RICK and MORTY, DM me your address

[17-Jul-19 05:48 PM] Malti#3948
i activated all coins, but now I don't see where to remove them again (it makes the app take longer to launch)

[17-Jul-19 05:48 PM] SHossain#0007
(if the faucet doesn't give you enough for your 100 swaps)

[17-Jul-19 05:48 PM] SHossain#0007
you can't remove coin as of now

[17-Jul-19 05:48 PM] SHossain#0007
for that you need to delete wallet from settings

[17-Jul-19 05:48 PM] Malti#3948
ok

[17-Jul-19 05:49 PM] Malti#3948
is it already logged? 'able to delete coins from auto loading'?
