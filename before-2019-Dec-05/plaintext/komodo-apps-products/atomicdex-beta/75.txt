[04-Oct-19 08:45 PM] Carsen#3333
At least misleading to say the least

[04-Oct-19 08:45 PM] Carsen#3333
I will do that Markus

[04-Oct-19 08:45 PM] Carsen#3333
For sure

[04-Oct-19 08:45 PM] Carsen#3333
But I just think its bad business and super bad publicity to be charging crazy fees

[04-Oct-19 08:46 PM] Carsen#3333
Your only hurting us devs

[04-Oct-19 08:46 PM] Carsen#3333
That do this for the betterment of the technology

[04-Oct-19 08:46 PM] Andersen#8337
0.9  BTC  is  crazy  fee  :abusedsmily:

[04-Oct-19 08:46 PM] Oszy#5734
Are you spamming this to all exchanges that are charging listing fees?

[04-Oct-19 08:46 PM] Carsen#3333
@Andersen Want to pay it? Put your money where your mouth is

[04-Oct-19 08:46 PM] Carsen#3333
hahaha

[04-Oct-19 08:46 PM] Carsen#3333
I dont get paid anything to do what I do

[04-Oct-19 08:47 PM] Carsen#3333
I just do it

[04-Oct-19 08:47 PM] Carsen#3333
and so do others that dont have a greedy vision in this industry

[04-Oct-19 08:47 PM] Carsen#3333
I do yes

[04-Oct-19 08:47 PM] Carsen#3333
I have called out HitBTC and Binance yes

[04-Oct-19 08:47 PM] Oszy#5734
That is your choice you can't expect anyone to work for free

[04-Oct-19 08:47 PM] Carsen#3333
Bruh it isnt fucking work

[04-Oct-19 08:47 PM] Carsen#3333
Adding a damn coin

[04-Oct-19 08:47 PM] Carsen#3333
Takes like 5 minutes unless your codebase is complete shit

[04-Oct-19 08:48 PM] Carsen#3333
Definiately not warranting a $7,500 fee

[04-Oct-19 08:48 PM] Carsen#3333
That is like 30 days of full time work

[04-Oct-19 08:48 PM] Carsen#3333
in the US

[04-Oct-19 08:48 PM] Carsen#3333
lol

[04-Oct-19 08:48 PM] Oszy#5734
Developing the gui costed much more than listing a coin, i can tell you they didn't even break even yet

[04-Oct-19 08:48 PM] ca333#0118
Using the DEX and adding coins to our DEX is completely free and there is absolutely no limitation - i.e. the tech is fully open-sourced. However - the mobile DEX wallet integration isn't free since we do cover SPV server hosting, support agents, maintenance and the implementation from the 6500 USD "integration" fee. That is more than fair. If you don't like it you can still use atomicDEX core/API for your own implementation @Carsen - but please calm down and stop spreading false information.

[04-Oct-19 08:49 PM] Carsen#3333
I suppose if it is SPV lifetime server hosting

[04-Oct-19 08:49 PM] Carsen#3333
But again that literally would cost me about $10 a month at most

[04-Oct-19 08:49 PM] Carsen#3333
and about ten minutes to setup (maybe longer to get synced fully)

[04-Oct-19 08:49 PM] Carsen#3333
I have five SPV servers running for Denarius (D)

[04-Oct-19 08:49 PM] Carsen#3333
We maintain them etc.

[04-Oct-19 08:49 PM] Carsen#3333
and doesnt cost anything like that

[04-Oct-19 08:50 PM] Oszy#5734
Go do it and stop this nonsense here

[04-Oct-19 08:50 PM] Carsen#3333
I just dont see the cost break down

[04-Oct-19 08:50 PM] Carsen#3333
Why stop man? I have a valid point and this should be a uncensored community.

[04-Oct-19 08:50 PM] ca333#0118
We invested a huge sum into this technology and won't even break even after 100 listings - correct @Oszy

{Reactions}
👌 

[04-Oct-19 08:50 PM] Carsen#3333
Why would you invest such a huge sum into?

[04-Oct-19 08:51 PM] Carsen#3333
it*

[04-Oct-19 08:51 PM] Carsen#3333
Regardless

[04-Oct-19 08:51 PM] Carsen#3333
Why charge developers

[04-Oct-19 08:51 PM] Carsen#3333
You will make money off fees

[04-Oct-19 08:51 PM] Carsen#3333
you could do all sorts of things to create revenue

[04-Oct-19 08:51 PM] Carsen#3333
Other than charging other developers to list their projects which are the entire backbone of your system technically

[04-Oct-19 08:51 PM] Carsen#3333
Also

[04-Oct-19 08:52 PM] Carsen#3333
I highly highly doubt anyone paid $7.5k to list Bitcoin

[04-Oct-19 08:52 PM] Carsen#3333
or Litecoin

[04-Oct-19 08:52 PM] ca333#0118
For the sake of decentralization and interoperability - we can't host a infrastructure, pay support agents, pay admins and infrastructure experts to monitor and maintain the network without charging for certain services - that doesn't work out if you want to offer a A+ service.

[04-Oct-19 08:52 PM] ca333#0118
Thats why we provide the base layer - the DEX core - completely for free. Anyone can literally just clone/fork it and build a DEX GUI on top of it.

[04-Oct-19 08:53 PM] ca333#0118
So you see - atomicDEX mobile is just a enduser product built on top of the free/open-source base technology.

[04-Oct-19 08:54 PM] Carsen#3333
Im just saying man, regardless of all the costs etc. why charge developers.

[04-Oct-19 08:54 PM] Carsen#3333
You didnt charge Bitcoin or Litecoin

[04-Oct-19 08:55 PM] Carsen#3333
Like there would be no DEX without us cryptos

[04-Oct-19 08:55 PM] Carsen#3333
I just dont see the logic in it, I am sorry we disagree, I do hear you though ca333

[04-Oct-19 08:56 PM] Carsen#3333
It does just really really sucks for us smaller cap cryptos that have been hard at work for the past two + years that dont get funding like that

[04-Oct-19 08:56 PM] Carsen#3333
Just a big slap in the face

[04-Oct-19 08:58 PM] ca333#0118
Anyway - you expressed your point - i personally believe its invalid and the statements irrational - have a nice weekend! 

I conclude by saying that if you need any help using the DEX core plz feel free to contact me or our tech support at any time - we d be happy to support you with whatever needed to introduce you to the DEX layer - the mobile wallet is really just on the application layer and does NOT prevent you or any other project from using atomicDEX - i hope thats clear for you now. AtomicDEX is free, open-source and reflects our vision of interoperability & freedom.

[04-Oct-19 08:58 PM] ca333#0118
And thanks for your interest in the technology!

[04-Oct-19 08:58 PM] Carsen#3333
Yes I understand that portion ca333

[04-Oct-19 08:59 PM] Carsen#3333
More than willing to help with HyperDEX atm

[04-Oct-19 09:00 PM] Oszy#5734
Contact Chainswap they charge less. Gui for PC

[04-Oct-19 09:01 PM] Markus#5464
It looks like Carsen want his coin listed for free, dont think it work so well with centralized exchanges either unless u have somthing valueable to exchange with them for a listing. Also it seems that 7500$ is alot but im sure they had a ico or he was a early miner of his own coin

[04-Oct-19 09:02 PM] Carsen#3333
Yes I did, but you didnt answer me on the Bitcoin and Litcoin being listed for free

[04-Oct-19 09:02 PM] Carsen#3333
@Oszy Will do

[04-Oct-19 09:02 PM] Carsen#3333
I mean I dont mind a fee as a developer if it is within reason

[04-Oct-19 09:02 PM] Carsen#3333
We listed on Cryptopia, $30k USD

[04-Oct-19 09:02 PM] Carsen#3333
Before it was defunct

[04-Oct-19 09:02 PM] Carsen#3333
We listed on CoinExchange

[04-Oct-19 09:03 PM] Carsen#3333
TradeOgre, Unnamed, Altily, NovaExchange, SouthXchange, etc.

[04-Oct-19 09:03 PM] Carsen#3333
We had to pay for most, but most were reasonable

[04-Oct-19 09:03 PM] Carsen#3333
Something the community could come together with

[04-Oct-19 09:03 PM] Carsen#3333
We didnt have any ICO

[04-Oct-19 09:03 PM] Carsen#3333
I ninja launched Denarius (D) in 6/14/2017

[04-Oct-19 09:04 PM] Markus#5464
paying 7.5k for atomicdex will probably be worth all those together since u dont have fixed pairs on atomicdex, u can trade whatever u want towards any other coin listed

[04-Oct-19 09:04 PM] Carsen#3333
The premine was small and used for bounties and paying services like Coinomi to add us

[04-Oct-19 09:04 PM] Carsen#3333
So no I dont have any funding currently and I havent for the past two years, nothing at all from this project

[04-Oct-19 09:04 PM] Carsen#3333
Or we could not pay $7.5k and just make an app that rivals it and takes all your users haha

[04-Oct-19 09:05 PM] Markus#5464
dont forget that any dex using MM2 have shared liquidity pool so it would not make any sense

[04-Oct-19 09:05 PM] Carsen#3333
I volunteer my time for D

@Carsen

[04-Oct-19 09:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Carsen If you think that developing your own Dex application will be cheaper than 7.5k you are sadly mistaken

[04-Oct-19 09:34 PM] dudezmobi#1945
actually i dont understand the issue.  is it the 7.5k or why btc is listed? or is it an evolving issue creep?

[04-Oct-19 09:34 PM] dudezmobi#1945
sorry english not my primary language

[04-Oct-19 09:35 PM] PTYX#6840
He's free to build his own app on the atomicdex network and api. However, he can't expect Komodo to list them for free just because he feels so. There's a reason for the onboarding cost and annual maintenance fee of the atomicdex app.

most developers are not that good in business and management and communicating

[04-Oct-19 09:43 PM] ca333#0118
first of all its 6.5k not 7.5k - and to answer the question why BTC or LTC is listed - do you think Binance, Coinbase or ANY other exchange or service charged Bitcoin devs for listing "their" coin? The answer should answer the question. 

It is pretty much always the case that the initial listings on exchanges, wallets, crypto-services,... do orientate towards the market and likely include some of the top 10 - 20 market-cap coins since these have a huge community and userbase. The services do that in the hope to draw attention to their product since the initial userbase likely has BTC, LTC and other top cap coins.

[04-Oct-19 09:45 PM] ca333#0118
Anyway - lets move on. FYI - AtomicDEX mobile v0.2.1 is coming out this weekend and brings some nice improvements!

@polycryptoblog I can do it for free

[04-Oct-19 09:48 PM] Carsen#3333
The core tech is free and open

[04-Oct-19 09:48 PM] Carsen#3333
@ca333 You may want to relay to @PTYX that it is $6.5k and not $7.5k, as that is what I was told.

[04-Oct-19 09:48 PM] Carsen#3333
Exactly man

[04-Oct-19 09:48 PM] Carsen#3333
NONE OF THEM CHARGED BITCOIN DEVS ANYTHING

[04-Oct-19 09:49 PM] Carsen#3333
You need to work with people in this space instead of cutting them off because they dont want to pay your $6.5k fee
