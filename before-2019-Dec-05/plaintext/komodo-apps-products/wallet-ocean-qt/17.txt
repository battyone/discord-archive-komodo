Hi, when my wallet starts up it immediately shuts down after reaching 100%. This started happening recently. I'm on mac v2.0.15. Anyone know where the app error log is? Or if they've encountered this problem before?

If my wallet status bar continuosly reads Connecting to Peers and than the green bar reads 19 weeks behind is this good? How can I correct?

never heard of DeckerSU how long he been on the KMD team?

[03-Dec-19 03:51 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
just taking precaution ya know

[03-Dec-19 03:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`never heard of DeckerSU`
he's, literally, one of the 2 people that created the wallet

[03-Dec-19 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`how long he been on the KMD team?`
longer than I've been around and I've been here over 2 1/2 years

[03-Dec-19 03:59 PM] SHossain#0007
Decker has been with the team since 2016/17

[03-Dec-19 03:59 PM] SHossain#0007
He also created the first and only QT wallet for CHIPS

[03-Dec-19 06:39 PM] LocoMB#8593
I have an embarassing problem there: when I run the build it all starts quite well (no issues w/ dependencies etc);
but at some time the build fails with :
_Fetching libsodium ...
http://supernetorg.bintray.com/misc/libsodium-1.10.11.tar.gz:
ERROR 403: FORBIDDEN_
this looks a bit strange, bcs I am fairly sure that I have libsodium installed w/ simple apt-get, and also, why would it try to fecth that lib from a supernet site?
No real surprise that I cant access there, but can I make the build _not_ try that?

[03-Dec-19 06:43 PM] SHossain#0007
which repo and branch you are trying to compile? are you using latest source?

[03-Dec-19 06:43 PM] SHossain#0007
@LocoMB do a `git pull` and build again

[03-Dec-19 06:43 PM] LocoMB#8593
yep- git checkout Linux-dev-18.04

[03-Dec-19 06:44 PM] LocoMB#8593
and before that simply git checkout  Linux

[03-Dec-19 06:44 PM] LocoMB#8593
ok sec will try

[03-Dec-19 06:44 PM] LocoMB#8593
also, build of PirateOcean and komodod works on that setup, (19.04 Budgie) so should be sort of ok..

[03-Dec-19 06:45 PM] LocoMB#8593
nope, says up-to-date - I just checked out half an hour ago anyway

[03-Dec-19 06:45 PM] SHossain#0007
@Decker seems there are some deps link update required

[03-Dec-19 06:46 PM] LocoMB#8593
happens in branch Linux and in Linux-dev-18.04

[03-Dec-19 06:46 PM] SHossain#0007
thanks for reporting. please wait for Decker to update those

[03-Dec-19 06:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`also, build of PirateOcean and komodod works on that setup`
use the `static` branch of KomodoOcean for the same results

[03-Dec-19 06:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Linux-dev-18.04` = Latest commit on Oct 13, 2018

[03-Dec-19 07:02 PM] SHossain#0007
`Linux-dev-18.04` branch is deprecated

[03-Dec-19 07:02 PM] SHossain#0007
`static` branch is latest

[03-Dec-19 07:04 PM] SHossain#0007
but, fetching libsodium, libgmp and libsnark might fail as this host is giving forbidden message and not allowing download `https://supernetorg.bintray.com/misc`
recently, those packages download link were moved to different URL in the main komodo source

[03-Dec-19 08:49 PM] LocoMB#8593
before the dev branch I tried 'regualr' Linux branch

[03-Dec-19 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
which has been stale since May

[03-Dec-19 08:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when manually updating and building, it's key to look at the commit dates

[03-Dec-19 08:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
<https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/branches/active> may help too

[03-Dec-19 08:52 PM] LocoMB#8593
I see there is also a Linux-static- I'll try that one

[03-Dec-19 08:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or you could read what you're told and stop taking random guesses 🤷🏽‍♂️

[03-Dec-19 09:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"ambiguity"? You were told twice `static` and every release since may links to `static` as well

[03-Dec-19 09:02 PM] LocoMB#8593
srsly- https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean says nothing about static branch

srsly
```
F.A.Q.

Q1. Can't understand the structure of repo and it's branches. I tried to build from master branch, but seems it have old and only Windows version?

A. Yes, you are right. Earlier we have 3 separate branches one per OS, master -> Windows, Linux -> for Linux and MacOS -> MacOS. Since Komodo-Qt (KomodoOcean) have new build subsystem and ability to build static binaries for all 3 OS all of these branches are deprecated. You should use static branch to build latest Komodo-Qt. Static branch is default branch for now.```

[03-Dec-19 09:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from that repo

[03-Dec-19 09:07 PM] SHossain#0007
@LocoMB do you need to compile locally? there are latest pre-built binaries available. i'm even using those

[03-Dec-19 09:08 PM] LocoMB#8593
ambiguity== the _main_ landing page https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean has obsolete instructions, and the latest info that contradicts the main landing page is in a sub-sub wiki...

[03-Dec-19 09:08 PM] LocoMB#8593
I dont really need to build locally

[03-Dec-19 09:09 PM] LocoMB#8593
but it does not build on static either, same error

[03-Dec-19 09:14 PM] SHossain#0007
download and use this one https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/459072527323365390/649904368308453406

[03-Dec-19 09:16 PM] LocoMB#8593
yes I'll do that- running ./zcutil/build-linux.sh on static branch also gave the libsodium access error

[03-Dec-19 09:17 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, you will get that error until Decker fixes that

[03-Dec-19 09:17 PM] LocoMB#8593
in any case, I am running komodod and PirateQT built locally, so I sont need it urgently- I just want to have a look at the DEX integration there- if I understood that correctly

[03-Dec-19 09:17 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to wait for him

[03-Dec-19 09:18 PM] LocoMB#8593
also, having the build setup running, I just want to have them all built locally for geek factor and to be able to stay up to date quickly - once it is up and running a git pull & buils is even easier than dl'ing  binaries (and safer)

[03-Dec-19 09:22 PM] LocoMB#8593
errrm.. also, the binary that has https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-7 
has a version number v2.0.15rc2-a977e49

[03-Dec-19 09:26 PM] LocoMB#8593
probably the build system assigned a different version number under the hood when finishing the build - but with a local build, this kind of confusion wont occur any more

[03-Dec-19 09:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
28-7 = a977e49
is has to do with how the ifs in clientversion.cpp or configure.ac (I forget which) work out

[03-Dec-19 09:33 PM] LocoMB#8593
😅 after all these incidents, getting a bit paranoid seems a good option.. Thanks! 🛏️

[04-Dec-19 03:51 PM] Decker#3767 (pinned)

Also, in this version was fixed link errors with boost during build on Debian 10, Ubuntu 19 and few other Linux distros. Issue with deps mentioned here above - also fixed. So, all who wants to build from sources - now should be able to do it.

[04-Dec-19 03:59 PM] Decker#3767
About versioning it's little bit not clear, i'm agree. Internally we have few different version numbers, but common is:

- `3.0.0.0` (CLIENT_VERSION_MAJOR.CLIENT_VERSION_MINOR.CLIENT_VERSION_REVISION.CLIENT_VERSION_BUILD) - this is daemon version, that equals to `v3.0.0-beta1`. And equals `"version": 3000000` from `getinfo` output.
- `0.5.0` - is a KMD version ("KMDversion": "0.5.0").
- `v3.0.0-beta1-9979ca2` - GitHub Tag of current release.

Earlier (from times when Komodo-Qt was available only for Windows) we used different tag versioning, with `-g%VER%-%BUILD%` at the end, now it will be deprecated.

[04-Dec-19 11:18 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Do we need to sync from scratch?  Was wondering why my Qt Wallet kept crashing, then saw the release.

[04-Dec-19 11:40 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Nice work by the way, seems to be much less of a resource hog than the previous release.
