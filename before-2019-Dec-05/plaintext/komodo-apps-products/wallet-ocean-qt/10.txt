Mmm, didn't know I could do that, first time using Ocean Qt.  Thanks.

your rewards are paid to you for using KMD (even sending to yourself) no matter what client you use

[18-Jun-19 01:52 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Sweet, that makes things easier.

How can I use my Ocean Qt address for HyperDEX?

[18-Jun-19 01:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no clue, I don't use electrum clients like hyperdex

[18-Jun-19 02:03 AM] agnewpickens#7393
I'll ask in that channel, I guess.

I'am having trouble installing the Ocean wallet on Win10. First i downloaded the wallet, started it and everything was fine and after the intial scan it showed all the adresses/transactions from my agama wallet (which funds i have transfered out due the vulnerability to an exchance). Means no funds there. But it reminded me that it's best to begin with a clean installation and NOT use eventually compromised adresses/keys. Closed the Ocean wallet and deleted ALL references/files from everywhere i had from Agama. Tried to restart the Ocean than, FAIL. Error message. Ok, uninstalled the Ocean wallet as a whole including every possible reference in %appdata%. Unzipped the ocean again, installed and again the same error message. No idea how to fix this, any ideas? Below what i get each time i try to start komodo, wasn't able to find the komodo.config anywhere. Error: Cannot parse configuration file: Missing komodo.conf. Only use key=value syntax.

Hello. I have a question: how I unblock the ocean wallet v2.0.15-rc2-6d31f03-dirty

[21-Jun-19 08:21 PM] ParliamodiCrypto#6833
?

unblock through firewall?

How do you claim rewards in Komodo Ocean-qt?

[22-Jun-19 07:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just send your balance to your own address. You can check pending reward here - https://dexstats.info/rewards.php

https://dexstats.info/rewards.php
Dexstats Dashboard - BarterDEX and Komodo ECO System
See your unclaimed KMD Reward

[22-Jun-19 07:45 AM] cryptopoli#6868
And is the manual Reward transfer also displayed synchronized in AgamaVerus 0.6.0?   Ok es gibt eine kleine Reward- diferenz zwischen ocean and Verus Anzeige ~ 64 digit.

[22-Jun-19 08:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
rewards are calculated on chaon via nLocktime parameter

[22-Jun-19 09:00 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Verus Agama and Ocean both set this param

[22-Jun-19 09:00 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
they might not dispaly rewards, but you can check that on dexstats

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator smk762 unblock to get reward (staking)

[22-Jun-19 10:20 AM] Hugh Glass#7861
So I am having an issue with my balance. It says I have 0 available ARRR, but I am showing a balance in “Private”. When i try to send it, nothing happens. I believe the problem is that it is marked as private and not available. Could somebody provide some guidance. Thanks.

[22-Jun-19 10:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Hugh Glass pretend that "Available" reads "Transparent"

[22-Jun-19 10:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As far as the send, you'll have to check the opid in the console to see what it's doing or not doing

[22-Jun-19 10:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"Help"......"Debug window"......"Console" tab...
then use the opid like:
`z_getoperationstatus '["opid-7fe46e63-fc75-48c0-a33e-21fb50746ba0"]'`

[22-Jun-19 10:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
opid is in the Z-Send tab where you send, like this:

@ParliamodiCrypto check out this guide - https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024428-komodo-5-active-user-reward-all-you-need-to-know

[22-Jun-19 11:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
there are a couple of links within to calculate pending rewards. if you are using Verus Agama or Komodo Ocean wallet, sending balance to own address will claim pending rewards

[22-Jun-19 11:46 AM] ParliamodiCrypto#6833
ah ok, so I don't need to unblock the wallet for receive the reward. I close the wallet and once a mounth I open it for get reward?

New version of komodo-qt will be released soon (follow the news on this channel), new and improved features upcoming:

- 99.9% compatibility with jl777/beta branch: support most of newest assetchains.
- `convertpassphrase` internal RPC method to obtain WIF from Agama passphrase for import with `importprivkey`.
- **x5-x7** wallet loading speed (big speed improvements at loading block index db stage)
- other minor & major fixes ...

@Decker is that method available in `komodo-cli` too?

[23-Jun-19 05:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
`convertpassphrase`

[23-Jun-19 05:36 PM] SHossain#0007
no. only in KomodoOceanQT

[23-Jun-19 05:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Can it be? would be super convenient! 😃

[23-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Decker#3767
@grewalsatinder if you will have launched komoqo-qt and will use `komodo-cli convertpassphrase %yourpassphrase%`, yes, you will receive a result.

[23-Jun-19 05:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I don't use qt mate... only jl777 branch command line..that's why requested it 🙂

[23-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Decker#3767
@grewalsatinder i will do a PR in komodod later, if needed ...

[23-Jun-19 05:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 what the difference between load speed of new and old version with KMD chain on your PC? It's like **x5** or more?

[24-Jun-19 11:47 AM] Decker#3767
Just want to collect some reports, how it feels.

[24-Jun-19 11:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It blasts through the init
I haven't done any timings on it, but it's *noticeably* much, much faster

[24-Jun-19 11:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[24-Jun-19 11:50 AM] Decker#3767
ok, thx for the report.

[24-Jun-19 11:51 AM] Decker#3767
for any non-LWMAPOS enabled chain (mean, for any chain except LUMBER, and other VRSC-based) it should be faster now.

[24-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Spaid#3606
have not used this wallet before, but just to confirm... to receive rewards, look up the receiving address with my balance, and send to that same address?

[24-Jun-19 03:30 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, send all balance to self address. that will claim all accrued rewards

[24-Jun-19 09:38 PM] zaza68#4573
ow it works on this lunix

Unless there's some random bit of makefile that I didn't see, I can't imagine a world in which only ZEXO doesn't work and only doesn't work on windows

[24-Jun-19 11:27 PM] Decker#3767
There is no difference between Windows and Linux versions of komodo-qt. As you are see, it works on Windows too:

Make sure that your are used correct ZEXO chain params:
```
komodo-qt-win.exe -ac_name=ZEXO -ac_supply=100000000 -ac_reward=1478310502 -ac_halving=525600 -ac_cc=42 -ac_ccenable=236 -ac_perc=77700 -ac_staked=93 -ac_pubkey=02713bd85e054db923694b6b7a85306264edf4d6bd6d331814f2b40af444b3ebbc -ac_public=1 -addnode=80.240.17.222

@Michael / Buck https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029939-how-to-import-private-keys-into-komodo-ocean-wallet
follow that guide and instead of importprivkey, use convertpassphrase as shown in the right part of the image at: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/459072527323365390/592406624950288396/unknown.png

Installed Komodoocean and its currently synching the headers.  I have my seed from my agama wallet but don't have wallet.dat file.  I can't find a way to reinstall agama desktop wallet.  Are my funds lost?

[04-Jul-19 10:05 PM] SHossain#0007
as long as you have your seed safe, your funds are safe

[04-Jul-19 10:10 PM] SHossain#0007
you can use `convertpassphrase` command to convert your seed into privatekey and import into KomodoOceanQT wallet. follow the example below and replace `agama passphrase` with your own seed
```
convertpassphrase "agama passphrase"
```
output:
```
{
  "agamapassphrase": "agama passphrase",
  "address": "RVHPhunndxxmKBU6nCJHtyopYVYWqER8bX",
  "pubkey": "02f5ea0bf2b72d02f1202247cc294a0c8bf9b70b8e5d6a83852f1421a82be63beb",

  "wif": "UvjTortSCah4Zut4omsHvhhEaX5Pk56gmPEmAEUzhd6KVNkCzgvv"
}
```
you need this wif to import using the following guide

Hello, I was just curious if there's a way to speed up the sync for wallet. My internet speed isn't horrible... about 30 mbps, but progress per hour is 0.71%. It says I'm 2 years 34 weeks behind.

[06-Jul-19 02:42 PM] guttermonk#5375
How do you claim your rewards if your rewards address isn't listed in the Pay From drop down in the QT wallet?

[06-Jul-19 03:12 PM] SHossain#0007
https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000030305-use-komodo-ocean-qt-wallet-to-claim-rewards

[06-Jul-19 03:20 PM] guttermonk#5375
I already did that when I transitioned from Agama. Now, when I click "Use available balance" it just takes the "available" balance and not the "reward" balance.

[06-Jul-19 03:22 PM] SHossain#0007
until you claim the reward, it can't use the reward value. sending all available fund (not including the accrued reward) will claim the reward

[06-Jul-19 03:24 PM] guttermonk#5375
So generate a new receiving address and send my balance to it?

[06-Jul-19 03:33 PM] SHossain#0007
you can send to same address.
