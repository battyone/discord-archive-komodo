@cipi yes, if you use the GUI skin. i'll DM you with details

[26-Jan-19 03:41 PM] Adli#5025
Hi guys, thanks for your awesome work for this great version of komodo and assets chains wallet ! Is there a manner to compile with another branch of komodo, like dev or the Jl777 branch ?

[26-Jan-19 03:45 PM] SHossain#0007
You can't use KomodoOceanQT with other branches from Komodo repo itself. The daemon is built-in and coded directly

[26-Jan-19 03:58 PM] Adli#5025
Okay thank you

[26-Jan-19 03:59 PM] Adli#5025
And you follow the update of the main repo ?

[26-Jan-19 04:00 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[26-Jan-19 04:01 PM] Adli#5025
thanks a lot

[26-Jan-19 04:01 PM] Adli#5025
As I understand in checking the avalaible command, it is possible to stake with -mint ?

[26-Jan-19 04:01 PM] Adli#5025
I'm right ?

[26-Jan-19 04:01 PM] Adli#5025
for staking asset chains

[26-Jan-19 04:04 PM] SHossain#0007
but, it doesn't have CC funtionality

[26-Jan-19 04:04 PM] SHossain#0007
staking works with `komodo-cli -ac_name=COIN setgenerate true 0`

[26-Jan-19 05:12 PM] Adli#5025
great

[26-Jan-19 05:12 PM] Adli#5025
thank you

[27-Jan-19 04:44 PM] Decker#3767
Fast way to activate staking in Komodo-Qt: go to Help -> Debug window -> Console and enter `setgenerate true 0`.

I'm trying to use KomodoOcean with pirate. But I dont see a "launch assets" folder in the komodoOcean folder.

[28-Jan-19 10:44 AM] Decker#3767
If you are using Windows - it's in archive with binaries as always.

[28-Jan-19 10:45 AM] Decker#3767
If you still can't find it in some reasons, you can use this batch script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/master/release/launch_assets/pirate.cmd to launch PIRATE.

[28-Jan-19 10:45 AM] Decker#3767
If you are Linux or MacOS user just launch ./komodo-qt with following args `-ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225` .

[28-Jan-19 01:56 PM] wookie#7663
@Decker Thanks. I'm on a mac. I searched in the komodo ocean folder and there's no "launch_assets".  
I used ./src/qt/komodo-qt & to launch komodo before, so to launch pirate, is this correct? :
./src/qt/komodo-qt & -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225

[29-Jan-19 09:05 PM] SHossain#0007
@wookie it would be like below
```
./src/qt/komodo-qt -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=178.63.77.56 &
```

[29-Jan-19 09:08 PM] SHossain#0007
it is the same way if you were using `komodod` to start a chain. just instead of `komodod` you have to use `komodo-qt` from the location.

Is there a way to import addresses/private keys through the komodoocean qt?

[29-Jan-19 11:05 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, using help > debug window

[29-Jan-19 11:05 PM] SHossain#0007
all functionality like the Bitcoin-core QT wallet

[29-Jan-19 11:15 PM] wookie#7663
thanks, I'm not too familiar other than the basic getting funds in/out. I'm looking through the help menu, can someone help me understand if there's any difference between importaddress and importprivkey? I can just import an address without the the privkey?

[29-Jan-19 11:17 PM] SHossain#0007
with importaddress, you can't spend funds, that is just watchonly

[29-Jan-19 11:22 PM] wookie#7663
got it. thanks!

[31-Jan-19 05:48 AM] Decker#3767
New RPC method `convertpassphrase` will be added in next release of Komodo-Qt. It will help you to get WIF for using with `importprivkey` from Agama passphrase.

[08-Feb-19 04:42 PM] Decker#3767
it looks like you are trying to launch build from `/Users/admin` folder. you'll need to launch build from KomodoOcean folder.

[08-Feb-19 04:43 PM] Gangwa#0821
no im inside KomodoOcean

[08-Feb-19 04:45 PM] Decker#3767
for Mac you should use `build-mac.sh` ... follow this guide https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/blob/MacOS/README.md plz .

[19-Feb-19 08:27 PM] riseandfall#3726
I never understood why AGAMA wants to support LTC, DASH and other altcoins. I strongly think that it's useless and it just bring more work to them. I hope you will not do the same mistake.

[19-Feb-19 08:30 PM] riseandfall#3726
When I see that now they propose from AGAMA to use the API of coin switch for small trades through the wallet UI. I just think :
1 : what is the benefit for the user ? He saves 5 clicks and take the risk of another software layer (the wallet itself) as an intermediary....in other world a very very small benefit.
2 : how heavy it is ? I think it's quite easy to implement....but in a long term view it just gives you more work for maintenance/updates.

[19-Feb-19 09:39 PM] SHossain#0007
Have you ever asked Coinomi why they have that many coins in their wallet?

[19-Feb-19 09:42 PM] SHossain#0007
> I strongly think that it's useless and it just bring more work to them.
maybe this is just useless to you. there are many users who would like to use and manage most of their crypto from one open-source wallet with only 1 key rather than installing different wallet for each coin.

{Reactions}
üëåüèº 

[19-Feb-19 09:55 PM] riseandfall#3726
But for coinomi this is their core business. I mean doing multi-coins wallet is their core business. They are not working for a specific cryptoproject.

[19-Feb-19 09:56 PM] riseandfall#3726
It's not a a team member of a specific crypto who is doing that.

[19-Feb-19 09:58 PM] riseandfall#3726
I mean myetherwallet for example is there to support ETH tokens  (and it was/is a huge a project)....not all tokens there are in the world

[19-Feb-19 09:58 PM] riseandfall#3726
Ps : don't think I'm aggressive...I just say my opinion üòä

[19-Feb-19 09:59 PM] riseandfall#3726
It means that it totally exceeds the perimeter of Komodo....

[19-Feb-19 10:01 PM] riseandfall#3726
You could answer "ok BarterDEX also so ?" And I would say that in this case it would make more sense...

[19-Feb-19 10:02 PM] riseandfall#3726
But to my opinion KMD should more focus on making the life as easy as possible.....*for projects hosted on Komodo*

[19-Feb-19 10:02 PM] riseandfall#3726
Not for the whole world

[19-Feb-19 10:05 PM] riseandfall#3726
You start a new chain on KMD : KMD offers you without effort : safety with dPOW, a wallet (and if possible the possibility to store your new coins on the KMD ledger app if the keying system is smart...and when AGAMA will support ledger), and a gate for exchange on BarterDEX (so you don't have to pray to be listed in an exchange). It means that if you start a project on KMD you propose the essential services in a "turnkey solution"

[19-Feb-19 10:06 PM] riseandfall#3726
But this perimeter seems too narrow as far as I understand. I thinks it's already a huge challenge....but it seems Devs wants to do something even more "challenging"

[19-Feb-19 10:09 PM] riseandfall#3726
If I were you I would consider for AGAMA (and even for BarterDEX) only : KMD chains + Bitcoin....and nothing more.

[19-Feb-19 10:09 PM] riseandfall#3726
Sometimes the feeling you cover more than that... for humanitarian reasons (I'm teasing a bit üòÅ)

[20-Feb-19 08:39 AM] jorian#4555
why are you ranting on agama in a QT wallet channel? üòõ

[20-Feb-19 08:42 AM] riseandfall#3726
Just because I have the feeling that QT has another perimeter : just KMD coins. But maybe I'm wrong ?

[20-Feb-19 08:47 AM] jorian#4555
true, KMD and assets in QT

[20-Feb-19 08:47 AM] jorian#4555
i guess it's just convenient to also have BTC and others in Agama

[20-Feb-19 10:11 AM] riseandfall#3726
You are probably right towards AGAMA. But I anyway think that QT choose the right perimeter.

[25-Feb-19 10:08 AM] omisu#6895
hi,guys . i cant see transaction balance on QT wallet . how can i see that ? all transactions amount is 0.0000000 pirate now. my OS is windows.

@omisu currently on Transactions tab you can see only transparent balance of tx in "Net amount" field. In PIRATE all txes have transparent amout = 0. Use `getrawtransaction txid 1` method in Help -> Debug windows menu to see full detailed info about given txid.

same as you would run the normal `komodod`. for example, to start BEER chain with KomodoOceanQT wallet you need to issue the following command in terminal
```
./komodo-qt -ac_name=BEER -ac_supply=100000000 -addnode=78.47.196.146 &

Hi, All ! Here is some significant changes comes till the end on NN election in Komodo-Qt:

1. We fixed some minor bugs in the wallet in Komodo-Qt, one, according to using of `sendmany` command from Debug windows -> Console (earlier it caused wallet crash), second with wallets containing z-transactions and few others.
2. Well-known that earlier we had 3 separate branches of 3 different OSes - Linux, Windows and OSX. Now i'm working on get all of this build from one `single branch`, like original komodod. There was an issues caused by linking OpenSSL 1.1.1a + Qt + other libs, but now all seems solved. This branch is not released yet on Git, but will be published soon and will called `static`. This also means, that you will able to build static binaries (!) for all 3 OS from single branch.
3. For Windows we will have simple and comfortable NSIS based installer.

There is an unoffical "alpha-test" binaries available, for all who wants to test it right now:

1. https://send.firefox.com/download/5569ea3885affb18/#jqFFWAhGMbAxwRxaygsM0A - komodo-qt installer for Windows.
2. https://send.firefox.com/download/da5af4ffd28a5137/#_GhscCPNq2jUKC7-7w3Fvw - archive with static binaries of komodo-qt for all 3 OS: `komodo-qt-win.exe` - Windows, `komodo-qt-linux` - Linux, `komodo-qt-osx` - MacOS. Linux static binary should work on most distros with `LIBC 2.23` (in Ubuntu, it's 16.04 and higher). You can test it and report here will it work on your favorite distro or not.

https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-3 - new static binaries of Komodo-Qt are available.

`komodo-qt-linux.tar.gz` - static binaries of Komodo-Qt for Linux (should work with any Linux distro with GLIBC version not lower than in Ubuntu 16.04)
`komodo-qt-mac.zip` - static binaries of Komodo-Qt for MacOS (tested with Mojave)
`komodo-qt-win.zip` - static binaries of Komodo-Qt for Windows
`komodo-qt-win.exe` - Windows Installer
