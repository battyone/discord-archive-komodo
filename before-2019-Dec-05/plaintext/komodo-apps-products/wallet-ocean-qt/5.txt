[28-May-19 06:56 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to install QT

[28-May-19 06:56 PM] SHossain#0007

Download Qt: Choose commercial or open source
With Qt, you can reach all your target platforms with one technology and one codebase, minimizing your time-to-market. Qt is available under a dual-licensing model.

[28-May-19 06:56 PM] nishbhim#7439
oh ok will do that

okay so now its doing the same as when i followed the guide

[30-May-19 07:40 PM] SHossain#0007
if you don't have the latest zcash params, it will download. if you have them, it will exit and will tell you they exists

[30-May-19 07:40 PM] SHossain#0007
once done let me know

[30-May-19 07:40 PM] 24052019#7280
This script will fetch the Zcash zkSNARK parameters and verify their
integrity with sha256sum.

If they already exist locally, it will exit now and do nothing else.
MacBook-Pro:komodo-qt-mac-2 (Computername)$

[30-May-19 07:40 PM] SHossain#0007

[30-May-19 07:40 PM] 24052019#7280

wihtout seeing a screenshot i can't tell exactly what that was

[30-May-19 07:48 PM] SHossain#0007
if you want to create a shortcut, open another terminal and type `cd ~/Downloads/komodo-qt-mac-2`

[30-May-19 07:49 PM] 24052019#7280
Typed it but dont think it did anything

[30-May-19 07:50 PM] 24052019#7280
my gyazo failed when i tried to take a screenshot, will try again once ive opened it again

[30-May-19 07:51 PM] SHossain#0007
