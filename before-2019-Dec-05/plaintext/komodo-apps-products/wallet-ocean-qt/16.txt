`$1` is for use in a script where you sent it an option thing
and there can only be one `&` in a given line
....
`Missing komodo.conf.` means exactly what it says; in order to run for KMD, you must have a properly formatted `komodo.conf` file in `~/.komodo`

[20-Oct-19 05:17 PM] hastrup#8742
that is what i have in my folder

Ok I'm still having difficulties.  I am now trying to install from scratch.  I have a new install of windows 10.  Downloaded wallet from https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-4.  When I run komodo-qt-win, i get Error: Cannot parse configuration file: Missing komodo.conf.  Only use key=value syntax.  Can someone please help with this install?

[12-Nov-19 10:15 AM] bushtea#4656
I got past being stuck on a block but now that I have loaded the wallet the balance is showing 0 and no transactions. I only had 1 wallet.dat saved, could I somehow have loaded the wrong wallet.dat? Is there a way to see what addresses are on a wallet.dat file?

[12-Nov-19 10:39 AM] gcharang#6833
@bushtea `File -> receiving addresses` should show your addresses

[12-Nov-19 10:52 AM] bushtea#4656
ughh, the receiving address (address where the funds were sent to from agama) is not the same as the one currently showing for some reason 😦

[12-Nov-19 11:07 AM] gcharang#6833
@bushtea follow this guide and check if you are able to get the private key of the address where your coins are <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024700-how-to-export-your-private-keys-from-the-komodo-ocean-wallet>

[12-Nov-19 11:28 AM] bushtea#4656
It is saying is not known (code -4), that means the wallet.dat i thought was the correct one is not the one with the funds?

[12-Nov-19 11:41 AM] gcharang#6833
seems like it
maybe search your computer and backups for another wallet.dat ?

[12-Nov-19 11:55 PM] bushtea#4656
searched but nothing, just not sure how I would have backed up an empty wallet

[13-Nov-19 05:47 AM] Oszy#5734
the safest way to backup is to export private keys, wallet.dat as a file as in your case could be a different wallet.dat, or it can get corrupted especially under windows, never rely on just the wallet.dat file in the future.

[15-Nov-19 09:25 PM] richardt#2807
When will the newest version of this wallet be released?

[15-Nov-19 10:32 PM] Oszy#5734
the newest is always the last one released 😄

[16-Nov-19 02:50 AM] richardt#2807
I meant after the hard fork

What files do I remove from Oceanqt to have it download the blockchain again? Mine is stuck in July 18 weeks ago. I upgraded the program files tonight, but that didn't work.

At the komodoocean wallet can i send dp coin? (its a kmd coin) and if yes how?

[22-Nov-19 01:50 PM] gcharang#6833
@johnyk which OS do you use?

[22-Nov-19 01:51 PM] johnyk#1034
Windows

[22-Nov-19 01:55 PM] gcharang#6833
@johnyk if you know its launch parameters, sth like: `komodod -ac_name=DP -ac_supply......`
you can follow this guide:  <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000030462-starting-the-komodooceanqt-wallet-with-command-line-parameters-in-windows>
just replace `-reindex` in the example with `-ac_name=DP -ac_supply......`

[22-Nov-19 01:56 PM] johnyk#1034
will try that. Thanks a lot @gcharang

[23-Nov-19 12:29 AM] Johnny Chimpo#2412
Hey all. Uh, i'm trying to setup a kmd wallet but i keep getting the "missing komodo.conf" message. Is there a solution to this problem?🤨 🤔

how to calcualte balance per t addr

[24-Nov-19 06:13 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
getbalance calc total balance

[24-Nov-19 06:13 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
getreceived - only gets incoming but not outgoing

[24-Nov-19 06:16 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
nothing better then gettransaction ?

[24-Nov-19 06:21 PM] Alright#0419
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 listaddressgroupings

[24-Nov-19 09:50 PM] Oszy#5734
or `getaddressbalance `

[25-Nov-19 07:53 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
sometimes there are really strange things when I do listunconfirmed

[25-Nov-19 07:53 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
none addr may be that one of mine

[25-Nov-19 07:53 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and multiple addr on the list vin/vout

[25-Nov-19 07:54 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
seems like even when I run z_sendmany that fails, it produces some unconfirmed strange tx for a moment

[25-Nov-19 08:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
is it good practice to allways add self sending rest of the balance in z_sendmany ?

[25-Nov-19 08:46 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
seems for z-addr the remaining will go to same addr, but for t-addr it can just go to some new addr and that is not really intuitive for wallet user

[25-Nov-19 08:47 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also when z-tx is being process the remaining amount seems gone, didnt notice when to read it

[26-Nov-19 04:12 AM] Alright#0419
not sure what you mean really @passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 , but it's best practice to use a new change address each time generally

[26-Nov-19 06:11 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I mean take a user used to online banking

[26-Nov-19 06:12 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
his account nr does not change after each tx

[26-Nov-19 06:14 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
here when I do t->t or t->z that do not involve whole balance the remains may go to new balance (but also may stay)

[26-Nov-19 06:17 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
since giu wallets keep same addr then I infer they use z_sendmany from t-addr to 2 addr each time not whole addr balance is needed : 1. exernal addr (outgoing payment) 2. internal addr (same self)

[26-Nov-19 06:18 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
handling that seems problematic too - first tim I did it the script calcualted remaining amount with rounding error of 44e-14 and the total balance was not enough for that 😂

[26-Nov-19 06:20 AM] Alright#0419
I'm still not sure what you're trying to accomplish. You should use a new address each time, especially if you intend to store coins on it long term

[26-Nov-19 06:22 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
generally Im working on kmd remote controller

never used cli b4 so I need to learn the logic of rpc's

[27-Nov-19 01:09 PM] erav3n#9290
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 for calc address balance - use `listunspent` with filter by needed address and just sum the amounts of available utxos.

[27-Nov-19 01:10 PM] erav3n#9290
`getaddressbalance` can be used only in case if you have `addressindex` enabled, which is false by default.

[27-Nov-19 01:10 PM] erav3n#9290
so, `listunspent` seems exactly what you want.

[27-Nov-19 01:20 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
thx, Im using now listunspent

[27-Nov-19 01:20 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@erav3n do you have a hint how to display incoming amounts from t-aad and from z-addr

wallet is stuck for me. at 99.99%, 7 hours behind, blocks left 443

[29-Nov-19 07:51 AM] erav3n#9290
@weldon.gull5 version of wallet you used? OS version? screenshot of crash? `debug.log`? without this additional information absolutely not clear how we can help you.

[29-Nov-19 07:52 AM] erav3n#9290
@+dreamTim for which chain? how many connections / peers you have?

@erav3n I have resynchronized, but it is very slow and slow after reaching 3,838 blocks remaining,

https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-7 - new binaries of Komodo-Qt are available. This version is not yet upcoming hardfork compatible, it just includes some pre-hardfork fixes:

- Possible crash fixed in case of receiving some mailformed transaction (kmdnuke fix)
- Latest KMD checkpoints added (this will allow correct determine of initial block download state)
- Added SSE4 optimized SHA256 implementation (by default it's turned off, to enable it you'll need to recompile binaries with `--enable-experimental-asm` configure option enabled)
- Fixed sync from scratch / stuck during sync with error like below:
 ```
    CheckBlockHeader komodo_check_deposit error
    ...
    Error: Failed to connect best block
```

- Other minor fixes and improvements.
