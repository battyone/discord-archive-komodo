[05-Jun-19 06:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
since it's not there, what error did it kick out earlier when you ran `zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)`?

[05-Jun-19 06:59 AM] hastrup#8742
i dont know. can i run the command again to see?

[05-Jun-19 07:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```
cd
cd KomodoOcean
zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)```

[05-Jun-19 07:01 AM] hastrup#8742

[05-Jun-19 07:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, you should start at the top of that readme you linked to and follow *every* step

[05-Jun-19 07:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
boost is one of the things you were supposed to install

[05-Jun-19 07:06 AM] hastrup#8742

I've tried to compile and got same error:
`configure: error: Could not link against boost_system-mt !`

[05-Jun-19 07:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```git checkout -f static
git pull```
then try to build with
`zcutil/build.sh -j3`

[05-Jun-19 07:12 AM] TonyL#3577
I think `git checkout Linux` what is needed (there is no branch `static`)

@CHMEX Excuse me, if I transfer the KMD of the AGA wallet to OCEAN, how do I transfer the token corresponding to the AGA wallet address?

Help please?

[05-Jun-19 02:04 PM] TonyL#3577
@modereck have you modified komodo.conf file?

[05-Jun-19 02:20 PM] CJK19#2704
do i type in my private keys into the QT command prompt with spaces?? sorry for the noob ?

[05-Jun-19 02:22 PM] CJK19#2704
i confused a key with seed, my bad.......where can i find my priv key?

[05-Jun-19 02:34 PM] TonyL#3577
@CJK19 to get privkey from your seed: https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000027703-get-an-address-and-private-key-from-a-wallet-seed

[05-Jun-19 02:35 PM] TonyL#3577
But you should not use it because it is compromised

[05-Jun-19 02:35 PM] TonyL#3577
What you need to do is to move funds to wallet with other seed/privkey generated NOT in Agama

[05-Jun-19 02:36 PM] TonyL#3577
You can install Verus Agama and create new seed/address in it, then transfer funds from your old address which was generated in compromised Agama: https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029932-agama-security-announcement please read this guide

[05-Jun-19 02:37 PM] TonyL#3577
If you want to use QT: wait until it syncs, then press "Receive" then login with your seed to Verus Agama and send funds to address which you see QT

[05-Jun-19 03:22 PM] ecbuddy#8524
@modereck getting the same error

[05-Jun-19 03:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Did you change the `komodo.conf` file?  From error looks like that it's corrupted at the moment

[05-Jun-19 03:28 PM] CJK19#2704
@TonyL  thank you sir for links, will do!

[05-Jun-19 03:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Great 👍 Hope your funds are safe 🤞

[05-Jun-19 03:30 PM] ecbuddy#8524
@TonyL why would I change it? I jus downloaded i from komodo website as is and trying to install it

[05-Jun-19 03:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Because installation guide suggest to change username and password in it

[05-Jun-19 03:30 PM] ecbuddy#8524
need a new address to fill the claim form and need have the wallet installed n synched

[05-Jun-19 03:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Anyway, can you try to change content of

[05-Jun-19 03:30 PM] ecbuddy#8524
oh?

[05-Jun-19 03:30 PM] TonyL#3577
this file to:

[05-Jun-19 03:30 PM] TonyL#3577
And start again?

[05-Jun-19 03:31 PM] TonyL#3577
```rpcuser=komodo
rpcpassword=local321``` needs to be changed to something secure then

[05-Jun-19 03:33 PM] TonyL#3577
As an alternative you can use this Verus Agama to make new address: https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview

[05-Jun-19 05:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, maybe I was not able to reproduce it because already had zcash params on windows machine

[05-Jun-19 05:25 PM] TonyL#3577

use bootstrap from here https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php
