how is hyperdex testing going? did not test since the barterdex days

[27-Sep-18 10:29 PM] crumb#2550
it's going well as far as i know. they just released it in beta around a week ago

[28-Sep-18 04:07 AM] DynamicPimp#0206
So are we good to trade funds on hyperdex now or is it still not recommended?

[28-Sep-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can try it yes... there is no risk of losing funds

[28-Sep-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not many bobs though unfortunatly

@jasonabis
```
How long should the app typically take to load?
```
at the moment there are some major performance bottlenecks in mm that makes login very slow

[28-Sep-18 11:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
we are expecting mmv2 to resolve these issues

[28-Sep-18 11:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
so once that's releases and we update to mmv2 login should be much quicker

[28-Sep-18 11:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
however to answer your question, generally around 5 seconds with the default coins
That's on the latest release where we fixed a bug in mm that was causing 15s+ login times

[28-Sep-18 11:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
however if you enabled more coins it can increas the startup time by quite a bit

@tobiwankenobi
```
what is mm2?
```
as @crumb said, markermaker is the actual decentralised exchange engine, it does all the heavy lifting unver the hood

[28-Sep-18 11:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
HyperDEX is just a GUI frontend to make it much easier to use

```

That disclaimer was more to cover our ass. Loss of funds is extremely unlikely, and as mentioned, we just use marketmaker under the hood, so if you're confident using real money with marketmaker via CLI or BarterDEX GUI then you should have just as much confidence (if not more, we fixed a lot of things) in HyperDEX.

However we did discover a very odd edge case a while ago in mm that resulted in a small loss of funds (fixed now). No code is perfect. I personally don't feel confident that marketmaker has been put under enough testing to guarantee 100% that there is no chance of loss of funds, hence the warning, but that's just me being cautious.

Remember that there is a non-negligable chance of loss of funds when using any centralised exchange.

Hi - i have the latest version but it just hangs at the login splash screen - cant get past that - is this a known issue?

[28-Sep-18 11:54 AM] miles#6381
wheni quite it says login failed - cannot connect to marketmaker

@sindresorhus Hi. I changed the electrum-servers for VIA from our own to some others that appear to be kind of official from VIA (i got them from the config of their own electrum-wallet)
https://github.com/jl777/coins/pull/163
Problem is that our own electrums don't have unlimited RAM and we can't run an unlimited number of electrums for each and every coin üòâ

@blackjok3r how many bobs do we need though? Sure, relative to the gazillion coins bdex supports, there aren‚Äôt nearly enough bobs. However, we seem to have a good number of btc, bch, kmd bobs. I have ltc, btc, bch, kmd in every combination running and am disappointed to see very little activity. At the very least I would hope to see some moderate activity in those markets.

[28-Sep-18 03:56 PM] tolken#2655
I can only guess it‚Äôs the flat market conditions combined with the marketmaker 1.0 idiosyncrasies.

[28-Sep-18 04:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
@miles do you have a fresh install or did you update to a new verision?

[28-Sep-18 04:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
do you see any electrum realted errros while trying to log in

[28-Sep-18 04:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
or any requests hanging in the network tab of dev tools

[28-Sep-18 04:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
If you upgrades try rolling back to an old vesion, disable everything apart form KMD and CHIPS and then see if you can log in with a newer version

[28-Sep-18 06:03 PM] miles#6381
hi luke - i was a reinstall - played around earlier and removed previous install and did fresh one - works now! thanks for following up and nice work on the ledger bug üòÉ

[28-Sep-18 07:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
@miles thanks for the kind words!

Btw, HyperDEX, isn't just me, it's the work of a great development team consisting if @sindresorhus @kevva and a few other contributors, all funded by @hyperDEX (Pondsea)

[28-Sep-18 07:14 PM] miles#6381
Good to know Luke - great effort all !

I got some zec stuck in hyperdex. withdrawal notify success, but nothing happens. it seems like missing electrum server for zec.
is there any way to withdraw? thanks.

[28-Sep-18 08:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Login with agama and chance electrum server?

[28-Sep-18 08:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Use hyperdex seed in agama

[28-Sep-18 08:52 PM] phideas#8309
i tried, but for some reason all non-komodo coins are missing from agama

[28-Sep-18 08:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Enable experimental features and restart agama?

[28-Sep-18 08:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also latest version?

[28-Sep-18 09:16 PM] phideas#8309
advanced features got my zec lite wallet working in agama. can't send out zec anyway.
in step 2 verifying and fee estimate went ok, but it stucks 
in step 3 with a message "Processing transaction..." and a red box "Error: ShepperdElectrumSend"
tried multiple times with different amount, nothing worked out.

[28-Sep-18 09:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm maybe an issue with the latest zec update that made the electrum servers no longer work?

[28-Sep-18 09:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I‚Äôm out of ideas, best to wait for one of the agama devs to weigh in on the issue üò¶

[28-Sep-18 09:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You are sure you are using the latest agama version, right?

[28-Sep-18 09:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Think last is 42c

[28-Sep-18 09:26 PM] phideas#8309
Yes i tried latest 42c, also lates stable 41d. 
No problem i gained some experience recently with cmd line apps.
So i am just syncing the full zcash wallet and gonna import the wiff  key there.
Anyway, thanks for suggestions Cryptoon. I totally missed the advanced features in Agama.
Lots of useful tools there, passphrase to wiff etc. i am gonna use that.

When mm2?

[29-Sep-18 11:38 AM] Mark81#4505
does hyperdex support CALL coin?

[29-Sep-18 02:04 PM] crumb#2550
@jspook16  initial timeline for mm2 is Q1 2019. somebody from official team correct me if this has changed

[30-Sep-18 12:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
Regarding mmv2:

There are certain features we need to build a reliable UI that we don't have in mmv1. mmv2 is pretty much a direct rewrite of mmv1 in Rust with better support for concurrency, along with thread/memory safety and a few other things Rust gives us for free.

So it won't automatically fix all of our problems as soon as the first mmv2 version is released, although it should work much better than mmv1. It will likely still have some of the mmv1 warts due to it being a direct port. But it should mean we'll have a much more solid foundation to work with the mm dev team to get bugs fixed and new API methods and stuff added that we need that just aren't feasible with the current mmv1 codebase.

TL;DR mmv2 isn't a silver bullet that will automatically solve all our problems. But it is a required next step before we can go much further with HyperDEX development.

[30-Sep-18 12:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
HyperDEX dev team has too

[30-Sep-18 12:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
it doesn't appear to be a HyperDEX issue, we've tried rolling back versions and the issue persists

[30-Sep-18 12:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
seems like it could be an issue with mm Bob nodes

[30-Sep-18 12:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
if anyone's noticed the same or has any idea what caused it/ when it started, please let us know, I need to get a detailed report to the mm devs

[30-Sep-18 12:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
@artem.pikulin I think the ETH node is down

[30-Sep-18 12:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
getting lots of errors like:
```
      mm ‚Ä∫ ETH RPC response parse failed: (null)!
      mm ‚Ä∫ curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server
```

[30-Sep-18 01:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
Possibly a false positive actually

[30-Sep-18 01:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
normal trades seem to be working ok for me

[30-Sep-18 01:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
just ETH/ERC trades which aren't

[30-Sep-18 01:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
which seem to be due to the ETH node being down

[30-Sep-18 01:34 AM] lukechilds#2707
but still, let us know if you've noticed a degradation in swap completion

[30-Sep-18 04:04 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@lukechilds Hi, as I can see node is up and running now, could be temporary network outage on server's side.  The server itself and Parity client is running for 2 weeks without interruption since last reboot.

[30-Sep-18 05:09 AM] tolken#2655
I barely get any matches on my alice buys (using bdex cli - artem mm as recently as a week ago. Tried Hyperdex, about the same luck. I seem to get a trade here and there on my bobs though. Had a handful of kmd/zilla go through the other day. And see a kmd/bch happen maybe once or twice a week.

[30-Sep-18 09:21 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
hey guys does hyperdex allows private swaps? meaning I set I want to make a swap with a friend using dex and we wish nobody interrupting it (settin price in between) ?

[30-Sep-18 09:22 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
ok such transaction could be done just sendin coins to addresses if we trust enough, but let's use friend as a general person you set an agreement

[30-Sep-18 09:23 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
but maybe a stupid idea

[30-Sep-18 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
use a netid that nobody knows about

[01-Oct-18 02:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
@passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã there have been discussion about adding this functionality but no, it doesn't exist in HyperDEX currently

[01-Oct-18 02:34 AM] lukechilds#2707
@tolken thanks for the feedback, sounds like it's not a HyperDEX specific issue then as I had suspected but mm in general

[01-Oct-18 02:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
we still really need to get to the bottom of it as the success rate seems to have reduced massively recently

[01-Oct-18 02:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
@artem.pikulin I literally cannot get an etomic swap to go through

[01-Oct-18 02:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
running my own Bob and connecting directly to it

[01-Oct-18 02:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
I see `reserved`, `connect`, `connected` on the bob logs, then after a while:
```
SWAP completed! 2326339491-975690583 {"error":"swap never started"...
```

[01-Oct-18 02:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
and on Alice a whole lot of:
```
      mm ‚Ä∫ curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server
```

[01-Oct-18 02:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
I will try playing with a few different mm versions and testing network on my and and see if I can get to the bottom of it and provide you with logs

[01-Oct-18 03:14 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@lukechilds Hi, thanks. Please check if you experience any packet loss on your Bob. Is it a dedicated server/vps?

[01-Oct-18 03:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, it's a VPS

[01-Oct-18 03:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
never had any issues with before

[01-Oct-18 03:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
well I have haha

[01-Oct-18 03:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
but it was unrelated to the VPS, it was issues we resolved in mm before

[01-Oct-18 03:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
I've had the same Bob VPS running the entire time

[01-Oct-18 03:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
issue appears to be on Alices end

[01-Oct-18 03:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
the swap matches but Alice never sends dexfee

[01-Oct-18 03:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
only for etomic based swaps

[01-Oct-18 04:37 AM] tolken#2655
I believe that‚Äôs what I was seeing before, no Alice payment, but I‚Äôm not even getting matches lately.

[01-Oct-18 04:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats an old issue, me and Alright were extremly vocal about it months and months ago, and it was never fixed... I think it has somehting to do with the FR nodes getting messed up and requiring a restart.

[01-Oct-18 04:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you will find if you ran yor alice with canbind:1 it would not happen üòâ

[01-Oct-18 05:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
I don't think it's that, checking logs it appears I match correctly with another node, alice just never sends the tx

[01-Oct-18 05:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
even tried a trade where alice was KMD and bob was ERC20 and that killed mm

[01-Oct-18 05:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
so definitely seems to be some ERC20 related bug

[01-Oct-18 05:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The swap never started is 99% due to the alic and bob not connecting.

[01-Oct-18 05:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they match, but for som reason after that they refuse to connect and it times out

[01-Oct-18 05:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
I see

[01-Oct-18 05:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
I have logs

[01-Oct-18 05:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
will upload...

[01-Oct-18 05:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mayeb this is a new bug though that also gives the same error message üòï
