@_PureHate_ sounds like any security or antivirus program is blocking the connection

Does anyone ever use HyperDex. I recently discovered this and wanted to try it out. I posted a transaction to convert some BEER to PIZZA and waited for several hours and did this on several different occasions, but no takers. Also when I check for offers under popular pairs like BTC/ETH or BTC/LTC, etc. I never see any pending offers. Is anyone using this yet?

[01-Dec-18 01:14 AM] actionslacks#4072
there is not a lot of participants right now. There’s an updated back end being built right now to add capability and grow usage. You can check the progress in #dev-marketmaker

[01-Dec-18 03:52 AM] tolken#2655
@osyed what do you mean by pending offers? There are btc/eth and btc/ltc sell offers (bobs), just very few people ever try and even trade/buy them.

Could not connect to marketmaker. How can I fix this?

[01-Dec-18 05:03 AM] Dzimmy#4304
Is there something else that I need to download?

[01-Dec-18 12:52 PM] osyed#0739
@tolken >what do you mean by pending offers?
I mean that when I go under "Exchange" and select BTC on the left and ETH on the right, I don't see any orders in the "Open Orders" area; even if I click on the BTC/ETH tab. Doesn't matter which pairs I select I never see any open orders. If I submit an order to exchange BEER/PIZZA I see it in the open orders area. But even after leaving it sit for hours, it does not get filled. Could it be that I'm not actually connected to the Dex?

[01-Dec-18 12:55 PM] osyed#0739
When I start HyperDex I do see a message saying "Could not connect to DNR Electrum server", but then the HyperDex UI still opens and appears usable.

[01-Dec-18 01:00 PM] osyed#0739
I just took DNR out of the list of coins in my wallet and now I don't get this message.

[01-Dec-18 03:58 PM] tolken#2655
@osyed there aren’t a lot of trades on bdex. But there certainly are orders waiting to be filled - so this appears to be a problem specific to your end. I wouldn’t think the electrum would affect your view of the orderbooks as I don’t think electrum plays any role in them, but it is perhaps a sign of a network configuration/firewall issue?

[01-Dec-18 04:13 PM] Nabob#5004
dnr electrums are removed from our coins database, because of their outdated servers

[01-Dec-18 04:35 PM] osyed#0739
@tolken I installed Hyperdex on another computer. Now under "Exchange" CHIPS/KMD I see some buy and sell orders listed. I don't see them on the first computer. So it seems like a network issue on the first computer. Both computer are behind the same home NAT and both are Windows. I'm using version 0.2.1 of Hyperdex.

[01-Dec-18 05:36 PM] tolken#2655
Great to hear. Have you tried restarting your router?

[01-Dec-18 05:38 PM] osyed#0739
I didn't try restarting the router, but after leaving the first computer on the CHIPS/KMD page for awhile I see a few buy and sell orders. Although the second computer shows more orders listed.

[01-Dec-18 05:40 PM] osyed#0739
I had another issue though. When I added and deleted another coin, my BEER entry disappeared from my portfolio. This happened on both computers.

[01-Dec-18 05:58 PM] osyed#0739
Posted an issue on github about this.

[02-Dec-18 01:20 AM] osyed#0739
@Nabob > dnr electrums are removed from our coins database, because of their outdated servers
It would be good to also remove DNR from the default coin list, so that the "Could not connecto to DNR Electrum server" does not cause confusion for beginners.

[02-Dec-18 03:26 AM] osyed#0739
@tolken > Have you tried restarting your router?
Just tried it. It made no difference. On the first computer, when I go to the Exchange CHIPS/KMD page I don't see any open orders, but after about 10 minutes I see a few orders. On the second computer, I see the orders right away and more orders are listed there.

[02-Dec-18 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Are the two computers on the same network?

[02-Dec-18 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant run more than 1 marketmaker on each public IP

[02-Dec-18 09:45 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
that's a pretty dire restriction - anyway to force it onto IPv6, then problem solved?

[03-Dec-18 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure it works with ip6 ... best way I found was to get very very cheap VPS and load marketmaker into it, then ssh tunnel to it to conncet the GUI. be hyperdex or barterdex

[03-Dec-18 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then also you dont close trades when closing the app.

[03-Dec-18 01:49 PM] kmdstudent#8905
Hi everyone I am learning about hyperdex, which it is cool.
But I want to know how it works with orderbook.
I am  going to swap between `ZIL` and `ETH`.
When I clicked `Buy ETH` with some `ZIL`, it appeared in `OpenOrders` list.
But I could not see anything in `ETH Buy Orders` or `ETH Sell Orders`. It seems the orderbook does not work.
Could you anyone let me know how you manage orderbook?

[03-Dec-18 02:03 PM] cipi#4502
ZIL/ETH orderbook is likely emtpy... try ZIL/KMD

[03-Dec-18 02:04 PM] kmdstudent#8905
Who will orderbook then? I cant myself?

[03-Dec-18 02:05 PM] cipi#4502
every node in the network can make orderbook-entries... don't know how GUI is handling this, i do it with CLI

[03-Dec-18 02:06 PM] kmdstudent#8905
With CLI, you call `setprice` to add an order to orderbook?

[03-Dec-18 02:07 PM] cipi#4502
autoprice, setprice won't last for long

As I looked hyperdex code, I could not find calls of autoprice or setprice.

[03-Dec-18 02:09 PM] kmdstudent#8905
And I could not find from debug as well.

[03-Dec-18 02:10 PM] cipi#4502
then it is not implemented in HyperDEX GUI

[03-Dec-18 02:17 PM] SHossain#0007
HyperDEX GUI is primarily for Alice. Bob functions are not in the GUI

[03-Dec-18 02:17 PM] kmdstudent#8905
Do you have a plan to have Bob's function?

[03-Dec-18 07:29 PM] The Big Wan#6408
Hey, is there a place where I can view the volume of trades going through the DEX?

[03-Dec-18 08:05 PM] Acura#2748
@The Big Wan https://www.dexstats.info/ Actually quite low Volume, Upgrade of MarketMaker V2 is coming for better experience

Oh of course, It's still in development after all.

[04-Dec-18 12:27 PM] cipi#4502
@sindresorhus @pbca26 need to save some RAM on the electrums, so i changed BCH electrums to external ones: https://github.com/jl777/coins/pull/209
there are a lot of public BCH electrums, no need to host our own
same with LTC: https://github.com/jl777/coins/pull/210

[06-Dec-18 10:46 PM] Jonathan#3687
Alot of times if you are running native on Agama it will conflict

[06-Dec-18 10:47 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033

[06-Dec-18 10:47 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033

[06-Dec-18 10:48 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033
soo should i uninstall Agama  ?

[06-Dec-18 10:51 PM] Jonathan#3687
Wouldn't say that, try running Hyperdex by itself......some scenarios can be iffy sometimes, like which one is open first. I get the same issue sometimes but it isn't consistent

[06-Dec-18 10:52 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033
Agama  is closed

[06-Dec-18 10:52 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033
i try some sell some zec and i wanna use hyperdex

[06-Dec-18 10:53 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033

[06-Dec-18 10:55 PM] Hermes#6934
Yes I am also trying to match some orders here...I have an open order right now

[06-Dec-18 10:56 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033
i create 4 users

[06-Dec-18 10:56 PM] Hermes#6934
wonder do you have any change in your network lately ? any Av that could be blocking marketmaker o?

[06-Dec-18 10:57 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033
after i uninstall the hyperdex   and reinstall it   those usernames are still there

[06-Dec-18 10:57 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033
hmmm i dont think so

[06-Dec-18 10:57 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033
let me check the   ETC file from windows /system 32/

[06-Dec-18 10:58 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc hosts

[06-Dec-18 10:59 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033
could not connect to DNR electrum  i see an error in bottom right of the screen

[06-Dec-18 11:01 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033
i am pretty sure  the  accounts that i create don t need to be there after i uninstall the  hyperDEX

[06-Dec-18 11:01 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033
cause after reinstalling   the accounts are back thre

[06-Dec-18 11:03 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033
barderDEX is working without problem

[06-Dec-18 11:03 PM] Hermes#6934
Those files you are seeing are userdata files...Hyperdex application doesn't touch those files

[06-Dec-18 11:03 PM] Hermes#6934
they don't get erased when you download the latest version.

[06-Dec-18 11:04 PM] Hermes#6934
I saw your same message with DNR , this is because DNR electrum servers were delisted because of lack of updates from this coin

[06-Dec-18 11:05 PM] Hermes#6934
Still after this message the Hyperdex launched...and yes market maker crashed for me as well...but was able to open at the second try.

[06-Dec-18 11:06 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033
hmmm

[06-Dec-18 11:06 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033
at least barterDEX work  but nobody  trade zec to  btc and  vice versa

[06-Dec-18 11:07 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033
i am angry cause ppl dont wanna use this system and choose the fucking coinbase

[06-Dec-18 11:07 PM] kmdbrt_test#4033

[07-Dec-18 10:06 AM] cipi#4502
look for orders with KMD as base, not BTC

[08-Dec-18 06:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi,
I'm looking for an article or guide to HyperDEX that explains to beginners basically what it is and how to use it.
I'd like a link to put on a website.
Any suggestions appreciated!!

[08-Dec-18 07:06 AM] Acura#2748
I think on YouTube there was several Guide Videos

[08-Dec-18 07:58 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, @Acura!  Hadn't thought of youtube 😩
