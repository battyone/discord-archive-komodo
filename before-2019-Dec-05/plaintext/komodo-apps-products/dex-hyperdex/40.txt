@FTL_Ian you can use the seed words from hyperdex in Verus Agama to export private key
the private key can be used in MEW or other wallets
https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024495-export-private-key-wif-from-a-wallet-seed-or-pin-password
you need to enable the coin "ETH" in lite mode to see the privatekey corresponding to it

I'm confused. Which software do I use for hyperdex?
https://github.com/chainmakers/Chainswap/releases
or
https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex

which ever one you prefer, they are both GUIs for the same network (think Ford and Chevy on the same highway)

If I leave one exchange window open for lets say 10 minutes, and i swap to another pair, orderbooks are not loading in anymore for any pairs, and has to restart the app. 
Can I provide any logs to investigate or is this already a knows issue?

Okay so withdrawals are not currently working, though balance is showing correctly now, prices are not working on the dashboard, but seem to work inside of the exchange/swaps

[27-Sep-19 07:13 PM] Carsen#3333
Upon withdrawal, it states it was successful via a notification but does not actually go onto said chain

[27-Sep-19 07:13 PM] Carsen#3333

I will get that looked into @Oszy but it might take a while.

Can everyone stop using hyperDEX until there is a official release please.

[27-Sep-19 09:24 PM] Carsen#3333
Ah thought you needed testers hah and Oszy was just a regular withdrawal after doing a deposit waited a good amount of confirms

[27-Sep-19 09:24 PM] Carsen#3333
Great work though so far!

[27-Sep-19 09:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I did but i think just for now, i am going to hold off until we get a better release out. Unfortunately the devs that have been working on this for the last 2 years, are burnt out and would like to do something else. I have reached out to the team and they will assist with a dev resources, so until i get this sorted, dont think there is much value in wasting the testers time until we can fix issues promptly.

Just tell me what needs working on or fixing or updating

[28-Sep-19 03:40 AM] Carsen#3333
Just need to investigate the codebase more, is there a build guide?

[28-Sep-19 06:54 AM] Oszy#5734
You can git clone https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex and run it with nodeJS afaik

I think it should be well established by now that Cryptobridge is a corrupt exchange.  I was notified that I need to verify my identity to Cryptobridge/Fractal ID in order to have access to MY funds. I have submitted my drivers license, name, legal address, source of income, a photo of me holding my license and a credit card statement. This is enough! yet CB requested my latest tax return. That is too much information. They have more than enough information to verify my identity and yet I can't access my funds. I have emailed them and thus far received no response. If anyone knows how to remove funds from this exchange please let us know it can be accomplished. I hope we, as a crypto community, spread the word so that others avoid this exchange. I hope there is a special place in hell for the thieves that work at Cryptobridge. They are truly scum. For all those who have been ripped off by Cryptobribge please take the time to post these types of warnings on as many other forums as possible.

what a joke. I only traded RVN there at the beginning, after 3 wallet mess-ups  and initial kyc announcment i stopped all trading there, looks like it was the right decision

How goes HyperDEX?

[04-Oct-19 10:40 PM] Carsen#3333
If any testers are needed let me know I can put up liquidity

[05-Oct-19 02:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Carsen thanks for the offer. The komodo team are helping me with a dev resource. They are looking at the code base and hopefully will start working on completing the gui refactor for mm2.0

[05-Oct-19 02:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Once that is done then we can start with the testing once again. Also since HyperDEX uses the same netid as all the other GUIs, you can add liquidity to them now and they will show up on hyperDEX once we get a release out.

[05-Oct-19 02:31 AM] Carsen#3333
Perfect!

[05-Oct-19 02:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Carsen I dont have twitter anymore but i just saw a tweet thread with you and PTYX. hyperDEX is free because i have footed most of the bill for it (i pay the devs). That is a choice that i made to give back to the community, probably not the best financial decision. If it was about the numbers, hyperDEX would not be free because there would be no way to justify the expense.
