@Riddlez666 that would be a question for the marketmaker devs, HyperDEX is just a GUI.

Maybe @artem.pikulin or @artemciy_dice can give you an answer

the same info would be needed for dex listing. Prepare it, and submit a PR

[14-Apr-19 07:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
oh sorry, if by "ETH clone/chain" you mean "ERC20 token" then yeah it's trivial

[14-Apr-19 07:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
I thought you meant an actual clone of ETH as in a fork like ETC

[14-Apr-19 10:13 AM] Riddlez666#9550
sorry not a token

[14-Apr-19 11:37 AM] Riddlez666#9550
@lukechilds there quite a few ETH clones around doing different things will they be supported?

[14-Apr-19 12:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
Then that's a question for the marketmaker devs

[14-Apr-19 12:04 PM] Riddlez666#9550
@artem.pikulin how does one work towards getting an ETH clone onto this ecosystem.

[14-Apr-19 12:09 PM] Riddlez666#9550
@artemciy_dice maybe you have the answers im looking for?

[14-Apr-19 12:25 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
Hi, @Riddlez666 !

I might be wrong, but I'd start with finding the coins file and adding your coin there. The file format is described at https://github.com/jl777/coins.

You can probably experiment with this by modifying the coins file that comes with the HyperDEX, I think they have it somewhere (cf. https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/blob/1d4ed3234b482e769124725c7e979eef5cd72d24/app/marketmaker/supported-currencies.js).

@artem.pikulin#0794 should be able to help you further tomorrow, and you're welcome to ask in #dev-marketmaker and/or the older #dev-tradebots channels.

[14-Apr-19 12:29 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
`> there quite a few ETH clones around doing different things will they be supported?`

If they have a compatible wallet API and/or Electrum servers, or if there's interest in helping us implement the necessary changes, then sure, why not?

[14-Apr-19 12:31 PM] Riddlez666#9550
thats why im hear as all info ive found seems slim and sparse, and want to be able to swap on the platform with our chain

[14-Apr-19 12:33 PM] Riddlez666#9550
should i take my chat to another channel @artemciy_dice as i have questions and don't wanna hijack this chan

[14-Apr-19 12:35 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
Yeah, I think that #dev-tradebots is closer to the subject of coin integraions.

[14-Apr-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is a infuria type of support that can be used, it shouldnt be too much work to add

[14-Apr-19 01:14 PM] Riddlez666#9550
just need a list of requirements of API and i can make it happen as i would love to work towards getting the other ETH variants on the platform

[14-Apr-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it needs to provide the same thing ETH does

[14-Apr-19 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont know the details, but if we are using ETH infuria servers (which I think we are), then the clone would need to be running infuria servers on the clone ETH

[14-Apr-19 02:55 PM] cipi#4502
we are running parity nodes for the ETH chain. They are defined here: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/ethereum/ETH together with the "swap_contract_address". I think the same contract must be deployed on the other chain.
ETH is enabled like this: `curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"enable\",\"coin\":\"ETH\",\"urls\":[\"http://electrum1.cipig.net:8555\",\"http://electrum2.cipig.net:8555\",\"http://electrum3.cipig.net:8555\"],\"swap_contract_address\":\"0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871\",\"mm2\":1}"`
it contains the parity nodes defined in the above file and the contract address from the same file. I suppose this would also work with other ETH clones, but @artem.pikulin can tell us more for sure.

Sounds good @lukechilds just waiting on standby still the domains should be working

[16-Apr-19 06:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Carsen , if you update the PR when the domains are working it should be good to merge

[16-Apr-19 06:50 PM] Carsen#3333
Gotcha will do today

[17-Apr-19 05:11 AM] Carsen#3333
Does or will HyperDEX have an API for market trades?

[17-Apr-19 05:11 AM] Carsen#3333
Or does the old BarterDEX stats still work for it?

[17-Apr-19 05:16 AM] Carsen#3333
@lukechilds Is there a build guide on HyperDEX?

[17-Apr-19 05:16 AM] Carsen#3333
For Win mainly

[17-Apr-19 05:16 AM] Carsen#3333
Well building on Win? Node v10 required and anything else?

[17-Apr-19 05:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Carsen HyperDEX is just the GUI, it doesn't have an API, we just bundle in the `marketmaker` binary and use it's API

[17-Apr-19 05:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
You can find build instructions here: https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/blob/master/MAINTAINING.md

npm should handle everything for you

[17-Apr-19 05:27 AM] Carsen#3333
Gotcha and it is beautiful luke, great work man really

[17-Apr-19 05:28 AM] Carsen#3333
Also node v8 or v10?

[17-Apr-19 05:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
higher the better but should work ok on v8

[17-Apr-19 05:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
thanks!

[17-Apr-19 05:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
it was a team effort

[17-Apr-19 05:30 AM] Carsen#3333
Yea seems v8 doesnt work, says requires v10.x

[17-Apr-19 05:31 AM] Carsen#3333
node-sass is what complains I believe mainly

[17-Apr-19 05:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
ahhh

[17-Apr-19 05:32 AM] Carsen#3333
Otherwise running through a build no prob with v10 after node-sass rebuild

[17-Apr-19 05:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
sweet

How to get listed as a main crypto as well?

Would love to get the DEX working, if anyone can assist

[17-Apr-19 06:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
You can see what's going on in dev tools

[17-Apr-19 06:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
check the console and the network tab for balance requests

[17-Apr-19 06:13 PM] Carsen#3333
Okay

[21-Apr-19 05:11 AM] klein#5233
Do you guys need more testers?

[21-Apr-19 02:08 PM] chagidel#6952
how many confirmations before asset should show up in hyperdex gui ?

[21-Apr-19 04:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
1

[25-Apr-19 10:06 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Put in a % how far is the mm2 project?

[25-Apr-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
90

[25-Apr-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
which is saying a lot as mm2 is aiming for a very high goal

[25-Apr-19 10:11 AM] CoinKing88#1540
I have 2 Dex now, will that be enough to get a piece of the distributed fees or do i need more to not be a fraction and miss out?

[25-Apr-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
2/1000000 would be your revshare

[25-Apr-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
probably not enough

[25-Apr-19 10:13 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Do you have ballpark figure what i need?

[25-Apr-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
no idea what percentage of revshare you need

[25-Apr-19 10:15 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Is it right that the higher the volume on the Dex the amount dex needed to not be a fraction gets lower?

[25-Apr-19 10:16 AM] CoinKing88#1540
100 fee x 2/1.000.000 is almost 0 but 100.000.000 fee x 2/1.000.000 isnt.

[25-Apr-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
2 DEX will get 2/1000000 of the revshare

[25-Apr-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it is proportional to the number of DEX you have

[25-Apr-19 10:18 AM] CoinKing88#1540
I understand but is the amount of fee to be distributed over all 1 million Dex a variable to determine if a revshare is sent to the Dex holder?

[25-Apr-19 10:18 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Or only the x/1.000.000

[25-Apr-19 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
when there is $1 mil worth to distributed it will be sent out, since DEX gets 50% of all revenues, 2 DEX will in that case get you $1

[25-Apr-19 10:20 AM] CoinKing88#1540
But earlier you said 2 Dex is nog enough to get that 1 dollar?

[25-Apr-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i didnt say that

[25-Apr-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
2 DEX will get 2 millionths of revshare

[25-Apr-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i keep repeating this

[25-Apr-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just simple math

[25-Apr-19 10:22 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Ok my bad, a comment from you a few weeks back confused me. Then you talked about fractions being too small to receive revshare. I may have interpreted that wrong

[25-Apr-19 10:22 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Thanks for your responses

[25-Apr-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
if it ends up being less than 0.001 or whatever the dust threshold is, then it wont

[25-Apr-19 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
but with million dollars flowing into it, having even 2 you will get some

[25-Apr-19 10:23 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Ok, my job is to gather Some more Dex then. Not an easy task 😊

[25-Apr-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
indeed, the hodl is strong with DEX

After mm2 implementation would be possible to run HyperDex mobile app?

[06-May-19 11:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We dont have a mobile app but we will try to get it working when mm 2,0 fully complete and if the community wants to help fund development of it.

[06-May-19 11:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@criptobear not much in the way of orderbook/trades with mm 1.0 probably wait till mm 2.0 is complete but you can shoot me the error to have a look

[06-May-19 08:02 PM] criptobear#6402
@hyperDEX no error just does not log in continues mumbling

[07-May-19 06:00 AM] klein#5233
Is fee discounts for paying exchange fees with KMD a possibility and is it something that is currently being implemented like BNB?

[07-May-19 06:02 AM] klein#5233
Would also reduce the amount of obsurce coins collected in fees that need to be converted back to KMD

[08-May-19 10:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@lukechilds any ideas for @criptobear ?

No discount i think.

[08-May-19 10:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
No error?

[08-May-19 10:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
Does it the log in spinner show?
