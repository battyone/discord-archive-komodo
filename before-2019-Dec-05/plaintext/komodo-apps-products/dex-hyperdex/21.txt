SmartCash is enabled for atomic swaps by RPC, is it possible to add to BarterDex as well as show it on the website? I remember something about maybe needing Electrum, which SmartCash has now. Thanks for any info you have!

[07-Sep-18 10:04 PM] cipi#4502
Smartcash is integrated: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins#L1503
including the electrums: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/electrums/SMART

Hey guys, just realized a pretty cool marketing opportunity for HyperDEX/Komodo

[10-Sep-18 10:17 PM] Regnar#6164
Maybe we should try to be the first DEX to integrate the new Gemini Dollar? lol regardless of how I feel about usd pegged coins

Sure, it's ERC20 so should be trivial to implement

[11-Sep-18 09:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
Does anyone have a Gemini account that could send us a small amount of GUSD for testing?

[11-Sep-18 09:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
I can reimburse you in KMD

[11-Sep-18 10:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
Or alternatively like/RT this so we get some from Gemini

@hyperDEX @sindresorhus Thank you for linking the SMART .svg. I really appreciate it being added to the webpage and anywhere else it can be included.

[12-Sep-18 01:13 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
Nice to see Gemini Dollar being added @lukechilds

[12-Sep-18 01:21 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
Tried to send you some, but they won't let me have any yet ... "Gemini dollar is not yet available in your country or state of residence. We're working with regulators to get you started as soon as possible!"

[12-Sep-18 02:01 PM] Hermes#6934
It will be good if the smart cash community engaged more with Hyperdex in the South American community

[12-Sep-18 02:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
@Mark-SmartCash thanks, hopefully we can get some for testing

[12-Sep-18 02:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
but it's just ERC20 so should work fine

hey @lukechilds,  @Jonathan  may be able to get you some Gemini Dollars for Atomic swapping in HyperDEX

[13-Sep-18 02:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
That would be great if so

[13-Sep-18 02:36 PM] Jonathan#3687
it's already on their exchange, it's not tradeable but there is a "withdraw as GUSD" option - when I get some BTC I'll be able to test it üëç

[13-Sep-18 02:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
Awesome, thanks @Jonathan , it's should be live in the latest HyperDEX nightly

[13-Sep-18 02:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
or if you'd prefer once you get some I'll buy some off you and reimburse you in KMD

[13-Sep-18 02:38 PM] Jonathan#3687
Nice

[13-Sep-18 02:38 PM] Jonathan#3687

Can we use optional Jumblr in BarterDEX? Is it possible to use in HyperDEX, too?

[16-Sep-18 06:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
You need native to use jumblr and hyper only works with lite mode for now so probably not.

[16-Sep-18 10:00 AM] Seko#7408
Thx Cryptoon, that is the information which I need...

Is it possible to use a hardware wallet for storing the funds within HyperDEX / BarterDEX or are they stored in a "wallet.dat" file or something? How and where are they stored exactly... Want to know üòÉ

[16-Sep-18 04:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Wallet.dat is only generated for native, so only for barterdex

[16-Sep-18 04:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Iirc hardware wallets use some sort of lite client?

[17-Sep-18 09:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
We encrypt your seed and store it on your machine, similar to how electrum does

[17-Sep-18 09:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
when you login and enter your password, your seed is decrypted

[17-Sep-18 09:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
so if someone gains access to your machine or your backups, your funds are safe, assuming you have a sufficiently strong password

[17-Sep-18 09:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
hardware wallet support isn't possible for us to add at the GUI level, but if it's first supported upstream in `marketmaker` it's something we could implement

[17-Sep-18 03:08 PM] nii236#2759
Are there any plans to migrate the codebase to TypeScript to avoid common JS gotchas? Might be worthwhile for an app that handles crypto-currencies.

[17-Sep-18 05:27 PM] lukechilds#2707
There are no plans right now, and a full re-write isn't really feasible currently. But we have already run into a few bugs that static typing would have probably prevented so I wouldn't say it's totally out of the question in the future.

[17-Sep-18 10:28 PM] jspook16#3059
As a side note. While hyperdex is running, if you grep the process, the key will be in the information returned. I'm just noting this so folks are aware

[18-Sep-18 01:33 AM] nii236#2759
Thanks for the information @lukechilds , do you accept contributions?

I could've sworn that HyperDex was under the lukechilds organisation, was it moved to atomiclabas recently?

[18-Sep-18 01:41 AM] Jonathan#3687
There is a donations button in v13 of HyperDEX @nii236

[18-Sep-18 01:42 AM] nii236#2759
Ah I meant code contributions üòõ

[18-Sep-18 11:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jspook16 Just to note this is the `marketmaker` process not HyperDEX doing that

[18-Sep-18 11:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
@nii236 Yeah, https://github.com/lukechilds is my personal GitHub account. We set up an Atomic Labs organisation (https://github.com/atomiclabs) and migrated the project there alone with other related projects we're working on.

[18-Sep-18 07:28 PM] Hermes#6934
Which version of Windows you are using? ,  Also guys remember that if you are going to delete the previous version make sure that you have your seed passphrase saved. I also saw a login error on Mac will try again.

[18-Sep-18 07:35 PM] lukechilds#2707
If you can create issues on GitHub with as much information as possible about the errors you're experiencing that would be very helpfull

[18-Sep-18 07:35 PM] lukechilds#2707
If you get an error message can you copy/paste or screenshot into the issue

[18-Sep-18 07:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
that helps us a tonne in tracking down the issue

I made one @lukechilds for Windows - there weren't any errors just couldn't log in

[18-Sep-18 07:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
When you say couldn't log in, was it just loading for a long time?

[18-Sep-18 07:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
with the logging in loader spinning?

[18-Sep-18 07:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
or did it literally not do anything when you clicked the login button?

[18-Sep-18 07:50 PM] Jonathan#3687
Nope it just resfreshes the screen/clears out the PW field

[18-Sep-18 08:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
when you click the login button?

[18-Sep-18 08:02 PM] Hermes#6934
Just to be on the same page users could experience issues because of their resources , the minimum requirements are the same as Barterdex right?

[18-Sep-18 08:02 PM] Hermes#6934
The login issue was solved in Mac by doing a fresh installation

[18-Sep-18 08:03 PM] Hermes#6934
will write you on github also if I see something else

>Just to be on the same page users could experience issues because of their resources , the minimum requirements are the same as Barterdex right?

Technically yeah but the minimum requirements should be pretty low. We do use Electron which can be a bit of a resource hog but I most of todays laptops should be able to handle it fine

[18-Sep-18 08:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
we don't have any official minimum requirements but if you can run Slack you can run HyperDEX

[18-Sep-18 09:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
@Jonathan That's very odd

[18-Sep-18 09:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
previous version being the actual previous release v0.1.0-alpha.13?

[18-Sep-18 09:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
or just the version you had previously installed?

[18-Sep-18 09:21 PM] Jonathan#3687
Yep @lukechilds - alpha 13

[18-Sep-18 09:23 PM] lukechilds#2707
