@miles Can you try relaunching the app?

[24-Jul-18 08:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
then go to the exchange view

[24-Jul-18 08:07 PM] lukechilds#2707
if it hasn't completed within a few minutes the copy the debug data (button at the bottom of the swap modal) and paste it here

[25-Jul-18 07:52 AM] miles#6381
Thanks @lukechilds - Have been doing restarts over the course of the last couple of days and it cleaned up all the swaps bar this one

[25-Jul-18 07:52 AM] miles#6381
which wont paste because the message is too long üòÉ

[25-Jul-18 07:54 AM] miles#6381

i installed hyperdex v0.1.0-alpha.10 but a error is ocurred. error message is ‚Äúmarketmaker is crashed‚Äù and then hyperdex  was restarted.  i use windows 7

[25-Jul-18 02:20 PM] Hermes#6934
Did you have any other program running like Barterdex or Dicoapp_

[25-Jul-18 02:20 PM] Hermes#6934

When did InstantDex get renamed?

[25-Jul-18 07:13 PM] Hermes#6934
Hyperdex is different GUI running marketmaker

[26-Jul-18 04:01 AM] cheeweon#5786
@Hermes i installed bdex and hyperdex  on my notebook. but i did not run both together. today when trying to login hyperdex error message ‚Äú market maker crashed‚Äù was pop- uped .

[26-Jul-18 04:43 AM] cheeweon#5786
i  heard to be listed on bdex or hyperdex , token or coin must be bitcoin-based. i cant understand what ‚Äúbitcoin-based‚Äù  means.  for example stellar is not be bitcoin-based?

[26-Jul-18 05:56 AM] cipi#4502
"bitcoin-based" means the wallet has a RPC-API with this calls: https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#bitcoin-core-apis
so calls like "gettxout", "importaddress", "sendrawtransaction" and so on are supported...
btw. ERC20-stuff works too

[26-Jul-18 06:08 AM] cheeweon#5786
@cipi i am not a pro dev. so i cant understand it .  generally centralized exchanges are listing many coins or tokens like stellar,btc  etc  .  bdex is limited ?   i have a coin - on testnet currently, mainnet q4 2018 , not erc 20 token-  that want to list on bdex .

[26-Jul-18 06:12 AM] cipi#4502
yes, BarterDEX is limited, because it must deal with every coin in part, so every trade on BarterDEX is onchain, means transactions are made on the blockchains of the involved coins... means BarterDEX must know how to create transactions of the coins... centralized exchanges do nothing onchain, in fact you are not even trading coins there, only some database entries and you must trust them that the coins you trade there really exist and are not only database entries üòÉ

[26-Jul-18 06:17 AM] cheeweon#5786
i understood  what   you mean. so is not stellar bitcoin-based? if yes then stellar cant be listed ever?

[26-Jul-18 06:20 AM] cipi#4502
no, unfortunately not... else, i had integrated it a long time ago üòÉ if it will be possible to ever list it, is another question, but i don't know the answer, @jl777c has to answer this

[26-Jul-18 06:25 AM] cheeweon#5786
what questions should i ask dev of project that i want to list on bdex?

[26-Jul-18 06:28 AM] cipi#4502
if he wants to integrate a ERC20-token, the contract must be really ERC20 (not ERC223)  and it must have the methods "approve" and "transferFrom" (99% of ERC20 have this)
if he wants to integrate a bitcoin-RPC-compatible coin, the wallet must support some basic calls, like "gettxout" and "importaddress" and it must have BIP65 activated: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki

we will have to test each coin in part, to be sure it is working

[26-Jul-18 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
in theory ripple and stellar could be supported as long as they have multisig

[26-Jul-18 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
support via ILP might be a more practical way

[26-Jul-18 07:26 AM] cheeweon#5786
@jl777c i would like to ask you to check Whether or not it is possible  to be listed on bdex (hyperdex) , if you dont mind.

[26-Jul-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
@cipi is the one who qualifies coins

[26-Jul-18 07:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
If it's HyperDEX specifically you want you need to go trough the normal process with Cipi and also submit your icon here: https://github.com/atomiclabs/cryptocurrency-icons

@Hermes in app settings menu  of hyperdex, I cant see custom marketmaker URL .  maybe this is a reason about my  loging error ?   when logging , marketmaker crashed  message was pop uped and returned to login mode . this is repeated

Any way to add Tether to HyperDex?

[26-Jul-18 02:46 PM] AndronicusBass#7784
It's not in the coin selection option list

[26-Jul-18 03:09 PM] jorian#4555
tether is an omni coin or something right?

[26-Jul-18 03:09 PM] jorian#4555
there is TUSD

[26-Jul-18 03:09 PM] jorian#4555
but maybe not for hyperdex yet

[26-Jul-18 03:44 PM] xRobeSx#5136
They were said to be issuing a TetherUSD as an erc-20 token, that would work with BarterDEX, but I'm not sure where that token stands

[26-Jul-18 08:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

thx already asked in there üòÉ I think i already know the answer but just to be sure. If i want to test a ERC20 token on barterdex, i need to have the native wallet running before i can add the coin right?

@hyperDEX  what do you need?

[29-Jul-18 06:18 PM] monokh#4656
Hi, i found the HyperDex really interesting, i had a few questions
- i notice it uses these "SuperNET" node. what is this? does it have any implications for centralisation?  i couldn't find any details about this software
- Is it using a true chain to chain atomic swap? I.e. as a user i hold my own private key and i can execute the swap using my own block chain nodes?

[29-Jul-18 06:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
HyperDex uses electrum servers, so you hold the private keys, but the transacton is broadcast on a server so you dont need the entire blockchain. BarterDEX supports Native coins.

[29-Jul-18 06:37 PM] monokh#4656
thanks @blackjok3r  is there no dependency on komodo? If i'm trading bitcoin to litecoin for example, does anyone of the process hit the komodo blockchain?

[29-Jul-18 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is not needed

[29-Jul-18 06:42 PM] monokh#4656
thanks @jl777c  as you developed the Supernet library, would you mind  explaining it's function? It is a pretty large library but i cannot find any info on what it's role is in the atomic swaps

[29-Jul-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it implements all but the low level crypto libraries

[29-Jul-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
all the atomic swaps, rawtransaction handling, networking, orderbooks, api, etc.

[29-Jul-18 06:47 PM] monokh#4656
i see, so with this library, I could technically run my own barterdex with orderbooks etc. with the use of the supernet node? 
there aren't any centralised points of information that the barterdex/hyperdex needs?

[29-Jul-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
correct. you could setup marketmakers on one of the 14000+ netids and not use any of the existing barterDEX infrastructure

[29-Jul-18 06:58 PM] monokh#4656
that's really amazing...

[29-Jul-18 06:58 PM] monokh#4656
but what really is the incentive for the developers? i noticed there is a fee involved, how do you setup which person can take the fee?

[29-Jul-18 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the dexfee goes to a special address

[29-Jul-18 07:08 PM] monokh#4656
at which level is the fee defined? The ui application which facilitates the transfer i.e. barterdex/hyperdex or the network like supernet?

[29-Jul-18 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
built into the atomic swap protocol

whats teh simplest way to make a transaction...swap or exchange?

[30-Jul-18 12:31 AM] Hermes#6934
Its very easy you just have to go to the exchange tab and select the coins you want to swap.

[30-Jul-18 12:32 AM] Hermes#6934
Swap should go easily depending on the volume that the pair has
