thanks, fixed

[20-Jun-19 11:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is there a way to revive a pending order? It's in order history as `awaiting payment`, but cant see how to get back to the cart with it loaded up

[20-Jun-19 11:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Have you made payment? @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  Actually this status "Awaiting payment" is when you initiated payment with coinpayments but chainlizard not received it yet

[20-Jun-19 11:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I made one a couple days ago, went into coinpayments, then used "back" in browser.

[20-Jun-19 11:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it returned to an empty cart, so I made another

[20-Jun-19 11:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so maybe some timeout is needed

[20-Jun-19 11:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
paid for the second one

[20-Jun-19 11:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
noticed first one still on list later

There are two channels so if we write different things in two channels it quite confusing

[20-Jun-19 01:37 PM] naezith#9757
@TonyL you wrote that this is your transaction https://www.coinpayments.net/index.php?cmd=status&id=CPDF6UU0MTU0AYM115YERBE49W&key=96d9cd785a06a0f439ac9bb63b4cd6f7

oh yes, it's timeouted since this time

[20-Jun-19 01:37 PM] naezith#9757
URL has 
```id=CPDF6UU0MTU0AYM115YERBE49W
key=96d9cd785a06a0f439ac9bb63b4cd6f7```

[20-Jun-19 01:38 PM] naezith#9757
id I have in my database

[20-Jun-19 01:38 PM] naezith#9757
but key is secret I think

[20-Jun-19 01:38 PM] naezith#9757
if I change it

[20-Jun-19 01:39 PM] naezith#9757
so I can't construct that URL

[20-Jun-19 01:39 PM] TonyL#3577
I see

[20-Jun-19 01:39 PM] naezith#9757
though you put the link `You can view the status of this payment or leave feedback for the seller for the next 30 days at https://gocps.net/4xb6nk5aotkd2zy7t2y1xrn0l/ `

[20-Jun-19 01:39 PM] naezith#9757
I don't have that ID neither

[20-Jun-19 01:39 PM] naezith#9757
they only exist in email I think

[20-Jun-19 01:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Btw payment window is 2 hours

[20-Jun-19 01:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's too long to store chain in "awaiting payment" status for 3 days. After 2 hours we can give user possiblity to re-initiate payment for same chain params

[20-Jun-19 01:43 PM] naezith#9757
that 2 hours is not same for all currencies I think

[20-Jun-19 01:43 PM] naezith#9757
there is even paypal option for example

[20-Jun-19 01:43 PM] naezith#9757
is this good?

[20-Jun-19 01:43 PM] naezith#9757
basically

[20-Jun-19 01:44 PM] naezith#9757
if you opened that coinpayments page but did not continue, then it is stuck in `Awaiting payment` state

[20-Jun-19 01:44 PM] naezith#9757
which you can open again from here

[20-Jun-19 01:44 PM] naezith#9757
and initiated ones, `check your inbox for coinpayments email`

[20-Jun-19 01:45 PM] naezith#9757
that email has the `continue paying` link

[20-Jun-19 01:45 PM] naezith#9757
or status whatever

[20-Jun-19 01:45 PM] naezith#9757
and if it times out at coinpayments side, then user needs to go through chain creation again

[20-Jun-19 01:46 PM] TonyL#3577
imo it looks good - since there is possiblity to initiate payment if user accidently closed coinpayments tab but haven't sent funds (Pay with coinpayments button on picture) and also instruction where to find information where to get information if funds were sent

[20-Jun-19 01:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Sad that its not possible to generate same link for payment status page as coinpayments sending in email

[20-Jun-19 01:51 PM] naezith#9757
@ca333 coinpayments support requires login, can you ask them if this is possible?

[20-Jun-19 01:52 PM] naezith#9757
they send an email with `view transaction status & continue`

[20-Jun-19 01:52 PM] naezith#9757
url

[20-Jun-19 01:52 PM] naezith#9757
and I need to construct the same url

[20-Jun-19 01:52 PM] naezith#9757
I have transaction ID but not the viewing key

[20-Jun-19 02:00 PM] naezith#9757
I checked again @TonyL some transactions don't send that 'failed/timed out' notification

[20-Jun-19 02:33 PM] naezith#9757
update
```
- Did some minor changes which might have fixed "ERROR: No 'merchant' set in the button!" error.
- All status icons in Create Chain page are grey by default now.
- Added Pay with CoinPayments button to Orders page, allows user to initiate payment for orders with "Awaiting Payment" state.
- Cart redirects to orders page if it's empty.
```

[20-Jun-19 02:34 PM] naezith#9757
can someone test that pay button in orders page

[20-Jun-19 02:50 PM] TonyL#3577
working fine on my side @naezith

[20-Jun-19 03:45 PM] ca333#0118
yes will check with coinpayments @naezith - plz DM me the exact request

[20-Jun-19 05:58 PM] Diesmaster#5068
where can I get my wallet?

[21-Jun-19 10:45 AM] TonyL#3577
@naezith could you please check why chain from screenshot above have "Launch failed" status?

[21-Jun-19 10:48 AM] naezith#9757
will do

[21-Jun-19 10:49 AM] naezith#9757
`An error occurred (InstanceLimitExceeded) when calling the RunInstances operation: Your quota allows for 0 more running instance(s). You requested at least 1`

[21-Jun-19 10:50 AM] naezith#9757
our current amazon account allows only 20 servers to be live at the same time

[21-Jun-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
@ca333 this seems a very severe limitation

[21-Jun-19 10:51 AM] naezith#9757
there are 3 system servers

hmm two pubkey1 chains at the same time

[21-Jun-19 10:51 AM] naezith#9757
that's not good

[21-Jun-19 10:52 AM] naezith#9757
that's before the name patch I guess, lemme check

[21-Jun-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
what if we get 100+ chains started at the same time? or lifetime? we cant have such small limits

[21-Jun-19 10:52 AM] naezith#9757
you mean 20 instances limit?

[21-Jun-19 10:53 AM] ca333#0118
@jl777c i set that limit.

[21-Jun-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so how many customers can be handled?

[21-Jun-19 10:54 AM] ca333#0118
we are currently using a virtual prices for chain-creation so that our team can test - a chain with full setup costs 0.1 USD for full integration. This is just to ensure that for the case that someone gets the URL wont be able to spam us and cause high costs on our AWS infra. 

Once the internal tests are considered finished i will update the prices to the real ones and remove that limit. So even if someone wants to spam us it will result in good revenue for us.

[21-Jun-19 10:55 AM] ca333#0118
tl;dr - the 20 instance limit is a spam prevention due to the low-price we set for the test-phase (0.1 USD per chain).

[21-Jun-19 10:56 AM] ca333#0118
@naezith i just saw a redundant chain-name above - did you check that?

[21-Jun-19 10:56 AM] naezith#9757
which one

[21-Jun-19 10:57 AM] ca333#0118
`PUBKEY1`

[21-Jun-19 10:58 AM] naezith#9757
tony launched that, though as I said it is not supposed to be doubled

[21-Jun-19 10:58 AM] naezith#9757
I was checking it atm

[21-Jun-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so when in production, we can scale arbitrarily high

[21-Jun-19 11:08 AM] naezith#9757
one thing is still in to do list:  cleaning of tools when the chain is deleted

[21-Jun-19 11:09 AM] naezith#9757
like the name is being inserted to all those repos, pull requests etc.

[21-Jun-19 11:22 AM] naezith#9757
okay I figured out the chain being launched twice

[21-Jun-19 11:23 AM] naezith#9757
not a bug. I was running the server on my local computer too at that time, so that order got processed on my pc too before it was marked as `launched`

[21-Jun-19 11:25 AM] naezith#9757
removed the duplicate one, SMK762 creation should run without issue now, let's see
