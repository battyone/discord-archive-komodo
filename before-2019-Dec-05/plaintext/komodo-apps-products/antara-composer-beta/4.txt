until they want to make the testchain real chain. this should be a GUI level enforcement

[04-Jul-19 08:10 AM] TonyL#3577
` tell him i will get back to him when i have time to do so` ok, it's MM2 release related seems urgent since he worry much

[04-Jul-19 08:11 AM] ca333#0118
I know @TonyL - already ACKd him.

[04-Jul-19 08:11 AM] TonyL#3577
gotcha

[04-Jul-19 09:11 AM] TonyL#3577
@naezith could you please check `htop` on mining node (loading on CPU and RAM)? Seems it started to generate blocks again - maybe it have not enough resources because of mining thats why daemon not react on RPC calls

journal is going crazy

[04-Jul-19 09:21 AM] naezith#9757
I'll check my scripts

[04-Jul-19 09:21 AM] TonyL#3577
I see, thank you üëç I propose to use multithread CPU instance for mining node

[04-Jul-19 09:22 AM] TonyL#3577
100% loading on CPU explains temporary mining issues

[04-Jul-19 09:23 AM] TonyL#3577
t2.small have only 1 vCPU so even if you mine on 1 thread it's loaded fully

[04-Jul-19 09:23 AM] TonyL#3577
At least t2.medium with 2 vCPU is better - possible to generate blocks on 1 core and second core will do other stuff

[04-Jul-19 09:24 AM] naezith#9757
okay

[04-Jul-19 09:24 AM] naezith#9757
I'll upgrade to t2.medium

[04-Jul-19 09:24 AM] TonyL#3577
I think @ca333 should confirm first

[04-Jul-19 09:37 AM] naezith#9757
that heavy cpu load was my fault, tiny mistake in code

[04-Jul-19 09:37 AM] naezith#9757
will fix now

[04-Jul-19 09:49 AM] naezith#9757
t2.small is probably enough btw

[04-Jul-19 09:49 AM] naezith#9757
my code has a flaw as I said

[04-Jul-19 09:49 AM] naezith#9757
I'll try again with t2.small

[04-Jul-19 09:49 AM] naezith#9757
it will take a while to cook a new AMI though

[04-Jul-19 09:49 AM] naezith#9757
please don't create any chains or something

[04-Jul-19 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
minig uses the lowst priority so 1 core should be fine üòÉ

[04-Jul-19 10:08 AM] TonyL#3577
it's very little cores on these instances it's like a 10% from real core maybe üòÉ

okay journal is calm now üòÑ

[04-Jul-19 04:53 PM] Alright#0419
@naezith the text for `public transactions only` vs `public and private transactions` could mention that wallet encryption is supported on `public transactions only` whereas it's not on `public and private transactions`

[04-Jul-19 05:23 PM] naezith#9757
I am not the one who prepares those texts. all of them will be replaced but I don't know who will give me those

[05-Jul-19 03:10 AM] TonyL#3577
@naezith Did you have a chance to reproduce this problem? I just clicked many times on pay with coinpayments button I think

I did not fix that yet

[05-Jul-19 11:30 AM] naezith#9757
fixed now @TonyL

[05-Jul-19 12:46 PM] TonyL#3577
@naezith when I'm selecting PayPal and then click "Pay with coinpayments"  I'm getting coinpayments page where I can pay with cryptocurrencies only. Before I was able to pay by PayPal
Have we disabled this feature?

[05-Jul-19 12:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Issue with button seems to be fixed. Smacked ~5 times before coinpayments page loaded but have only one chain

[05-Jul-19 01:30 PM] naezith#9757
what happened to paypal @ca333

[05-Jul-19 03:18 PM] ca333#0118
dm'ing you details @naezith

[05-Jul-19 03:19 PM] naezith#9757
@TonyL so yeah it's not on my side

[05-Jul-19 03:19 PM] ca333#0118
@TonyL paypal will be re-activated during the next days. We will let you know.

it's used to receive miner node balance

[11-Jul-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
seems no need to hide it

[12-Jul-19 05:31 AM] TonyL#3577
@naezith I input lowercase chain name input warning box saying about KMD address - seems this warning is static for all form

[12-Jul-19 05:35 AM] TonyL#3577
As an ultimate solution we can just auto capitalize the input into this field ( @Mylo s catch and idea)

[12-Jul-19 08:05 AM] naezith#9757
alright ill try auto capitalize

[12-Jul-19 08:05 AM] naezith#9757
thanks

[12-Jul-19 09:18 AM] naezith#9757
done @TonyL

[12-Jul-19 09:20 AM] TonyL#3577
text is autocapitalizing now, but right after I start to input ticker text this `Please enter a valid KMD Wallet Address.` message appears

[12-Jul-19 09:21 AM] naezith#9757
yes

[12-Jul-19 09:21 AM] naezith#9757
that must be entere

[12-Jul-19 09:21 AM] naezith#9757
d

[12-Jul-19 09:21 AM] naezith#9757
it's for whole form

[12-Jul-19 09:23 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe show it by default on form opening until user enter valid address? it's just a little bit confusing imo that message about valid address input appears when I'm starting to input ticker

[12-Jul-19 09:23 AM] TonyL#3577
but it's quite minor thing for sure

[12-Jul-19 09:23 AM] naezith#9757
hmm I can make it wait until the save button is clicked once at least

[12-Jul-19 09:26 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe make for this field same popup as for public key?

[12-Jul-19 09:26 AM] naezith#9757
can't

[12-Jul-19 09:26 AM] TonyL#3577
if I input not valid pubkey and press save - appears popup near pubkey field with message that format not match

[12-Jul-19 09:26 AM] naezith#9757
we do something really special

[12-Jul-19 09:27 AM] naezith#9757
using a lib which makes sure it's a valid KMD address

[12-Jul-19 09:27 AM] naezith#9757
let me try this first

[12-Jul-19 09:27 AM] naezith#9757
then I'll search if that one you say is possible

@naezith great! one more little thing in this form: when input not valid things to fields with such popup and start scroll - they stick to screen (in other forms parts fields too actually)

Beside of this popup and sticky warnings can't notice anything now. Animations are not so smooth as in chrome - but it's browser engine issue I wonder
