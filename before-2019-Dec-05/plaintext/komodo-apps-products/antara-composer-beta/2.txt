[21-Jun-19 03:00 PM] Diesmaster#5068
Yeah, the payment link is not working

[21-Jun-19 03:02 PM] Diesmaster#5068
It wont send me through to the payment site to be precise

[21-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Diesmaster#5068
Last time it took 1 min but now it is not working

[21-Jun-19 03:09 PM] naezith#9757
im a little confused. @Diesmaster can you tell me what do you do step by step

[21-Jun-19 03:09 PM] naezith#9757
you go to blockchain generator, set stuff up

[21-Jun-19 03:09 PM] naezith#9757
then go to cart

[21-Jun-19 03:09 PM] naezith#9757
click to Pay with CoinPayments

[21-Jun-19 03:09 PM] naezith#9757
then what happens

[21-Jun-19 03:10 PM] Diesmaster#5068
Nothing happens

[21-Jun-19 03:11 PM] naezith#9757

[21-Jun-19 03:11 PM] naezith#9757
this does not open?

[21-Jun-19 03:16 PM] naezith#9757
maybe an extension blocks that button, try in another browser?

[22-Jun-19 09:29 AM] naezith#9757
@Diesmaster

[22-Jun-19 09:30 AM] Diesmaster#5068
No it does not open

[22-Jun-19 09:30 AM] Diesmaster#5068
Good idea maybe it is my adblocker

[22-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Diesmaster#5068
working now

[22-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Diesmaster#5068
cool cool

[23-Jun-19 09:18 PM] naezith#9757
changes: 
- Hiding komodod launch line until block height hits 129.
- Displaying KMD Wallet Address in Chain Details page.
- Added 'Miner Node' tool.

[23-Jun-19 09:18 PM] naezith#9757
don't test miner node yet, I'll add some more features about it

I really liked it

[23-Jun-19 11:26 PM] naezith#9757
it is exciting to wait and watch how it mines, then you click after 1 coin mined üòÑ

[23-Jun-19 11:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, I claimed on PUBKEY1 - sorry if you're needed these rewards for test üòÉ

[23-Jun-19 11:27 PM] naezith#9757
np np it just keeps mining

[23-Jun-19 11:27 PM] naezith#9757
and implementation is almost done

[23-Jun-19 11:27 PM] naezith#9757
it won't work for new coins until tomorrow

and this button is hidden till block 129

[23-Jun-19 11:28 PM] naezith#9757
premined coins are automatically sent at 129

okay I think `Miner Node` is ready, you can test now @TonyL

[24-Jun-19 02:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Should I wait for rewards accumulating on `TONYL1` or it's better to create a new chain? @naezith

[24-Jun-19 02:59 PM] TonyL#3577
As I can see PUBKEY1 not alive anymore üòÉ

[24-Jun-19 03:02 PM] naezith#9757
I killed pubkey1 because miner node tool was enabled manually by me

[24-Jun-19 03:03 PM] naezith#9757
```
- Chain Details page displays Miner Node balance.
- Miner Node can send whole balance to the KMD Wallet Address when requested in Chain Details page.
- Changed AWS Instance AMI
- Moved CoinPayments merchant_id to .env
```

[24-Jun-19 03:03 PM] naezith#9757
make a new one so other changes also can be verified

TONYL1 does not have `Miner Node` enabled

[24-Jun-19 03:04 PM] naezith#9757
wait, it shows enabled, I'll check that now

[24-Jun-19 03:36 PM] naezith#9757
okay fixed that TONYL1 thingy

[24-Jun-19 03:45 PM] TonyL#3577

[24-Jun-19 04:11 PM] TonyL#3577
5 minutes ago received an email from coinpayments that payment is complete:
```Hello,

upd its online

[24-Jun-19 06:27 PM] naezith#9757
yes that delay is caused by coinpayments

[24-Jun-19 06:27 PM] naezith#9757
they wait around 7 minutes dunno why

[24-Jun-19 06:28 PM] naezith#9757
until they send our server "ok good money"

[24-Jun-19 06:35 PM] TonyL#3577
withdrawn funds fine, founder percentage paying correct also

[25-Jun-19 02:26 PM] naezith#9757
removed TONYL1 and ARTI to make space for new chains

[25-Jun-19 02:26 PM] naezith#9757
GirlPower chain got stuck in Launching state as I see, I'll check that now

[25-Jun-19 02:40 PM] naezith#9757
the generated launch line of it is missing `-addnode=` somehow. will check why

[25-Jun-19 02:40 PM] naezith#9757
that's why nodes could not connect

[25-Jun-19 02:53 PM] naezith#9757
when I launch AWS instance, I wait 30 seconds, then ask for `public_ip`. that was enough for all the chains so far. seems like it wasn't ready for GirlPower. I'll make it ask over and over again until `public_ip` is there

[25-Jun-19 03:22 PM] naezith#9757
don't launch anything for now please

though at two new chains, premined coins are not sent somehow, though it's possible to withdraw so not a big issue but I'll check now

`"balance": 0.04868065,` it's actually sent... the value on button was not being updated. checking it now

[25-Jun-19 08:15 PM] naezith#9757
gave a break for that thingy, working on removing tools at chain deletion

[25-Jun-19 08:15 PM] naezith#9757
it's hard as to enable them üòÑ

[26-Jun-19 12:25 PM] TonyL#3577
POS chain needs some additional staking scripts/software configuration - I propose to temporary disable POS chains creation possibility until we implement the resolution @ca333 @naezith

[26-Jun-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i agree, PoS chains are much trickier to setup properly

[26-Jun-19 12:29 PM] naezith#9757
I don't mind implementing it, though it might take time if it's that complex

[26-Jun-19 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181

coded the removal of spv server tool. wallet and dpow are left

[26-Jun-19 05:45 PM] naezith#9757
which are mostly about repositories, branches and pull requests

[26-Jun-19 06:30 PM] ca333#0118
lets deactivate PoS chains for now until we replicate the logic from Alrights "staking chain creator" @naezith - so we will add this for post-beta features.

[26-Jun-19 07:06 PM] naezith#9757
put an info and slider is not movable

In Development and Testing

Proof of Stake (PoS) chains are available from the command line of Komodo's software but are still in the process of being integrated to the Antara Blockchain Composer. For now, your Smart Chain will be 100% Proof of Work (PoW).

I think this will work @ca333

Make sure verushash11 or assetchains n and k works so they have some kind of asic resistance or their chain is prone to stalling attacks

[27-Jun-19 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
100% POW on normal equihash is very insecure unless the chain expects a decent amount of hashrate

[27-Jun-19 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
I'd say don't allow it at all or slap massive warnings on it

[27-Jun-19 09:16 AM] Alright#0419
I can censor all transactions on a low diff equihash chain.  Could probably do about 20 chains at once with a single z9 mini. Also you can stall one indefinitely with about $10 of nicehash or a GPU. It takes manually fixing or days(possibly longer) for it to unstall

[28-Jun-19 06:06 PM] naezith#9757
alright, I'm done with the tool cleanup at chain deletion

[28-Jun-19 06:06 PM] naezith#9757
I did couple tests, it was fine

[28-Jun-19 06:09 PM] naezith#9757
changes: 

```
- Chain creation asks AWS for public_ip over and over again to make sure it gets one.
- Fixed ac_supply=0 was not allowed server-side.
- Miner Node reports balance after block 129.
- Sending email about atomicDEX Listing and atomicDEX Mobile Wallet Listing when a chain is killed.
- Disabling SPV Server when chain is killed.
- Renamed "The server is down" to "Connection Failure" because it also happens when client connection drops.
- Disallowed Proof of Stake chain creation.
- Disabling Wallet and dPoW when chain is killed, tool clean-up is done.
```

[28-Jun-19 06:10 PM] naezith#9757
removed GMWR chain to test btw, sorry about it, not a sexist act

@Angelina hope you were not using it

[28-Jun-19 06:11 PM] naezith#9757
I need to cleanup the `KomodoPlatform, KomodoOcean, komodo` repositories because they have leftovers of all test chains so far

need to test Miner Node again, though since it needs the chain to reach  block 129, I will launch one and sleep now, will test tomorrow

[29-Jun-19 10:44 PM] naezith#9757
but you can start testing all other stuff

[29-Jun-19 10:58 PM] Alright#0419
@naezith what do you mean it must wait until block 129?

[30-Jun-19 06:32 AM] naezith#9757
lets say we entered ac_supply 250000,
