`transaction too large`

[03-Aug-19 02:22 PM] naezith#9757
code runs when I click the withdraw button

[03-Aug-19 02:23 PM] naezith#9757
can you explain @jl777c

[03-Aug-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
too many inputs

[03-Aug-19 02:23 PM] naezith#9757
`/home/ubuntu/komodo/src/komodo-cli -ac_name=${ac_name} sendtoaddress ${withdrawal.kmd_address} $(/home/ubuntu/komodo/src/komodo-cli -ac_name=${ac_name} getbalance) "" "" true`

[03-Aug-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
send smaller amounts

[03-Aug-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you have no guarantee that you can send your entire balance

[03-Aug-19 02:24 PM] naezith#9757
can you give me a safer line

[03-Aug-19 02:24 PM] naezith#9757
which would work

[03-Aug-19 02:25 PM] naezith#9757
though I do exactly the same when I send the premined coins

[03-Aug-19 02:25 PM] naezith#9757
250,000

[03-Aug-19 02:25 PM] naezith#9757
that works and this doesn't, why

[03-Aug-19 02:30 PM] naezith#9757
okay ca explained the reason why it happens nicely

[03-Aug-19 02:30 PM] naezith#9757
now I need to definition or implementation of `smaller amounts`

[03-Aug-19 02:30 PM] naezith#9757
what is the highest safe amount

[03-Aug-19 02:56 PM] naezith#9757
and will it be same for all chains
this value I'll find

[03-Aug-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
you can use about 500 inputs

[03-Aug-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so if it is mining and has a lot of block rewards 500x blockreward would be the cap

[03-Aug-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
all depends on actual utxos

[03-Aug-19 03:32 PM] naezith#9757
`1000` works

[03-Aug-19 03:32 PM] naezith#9757
I'll set it 500 then

[03-Aug-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no one size fits all

[03-Aug-19 03:36 PM] naezith#9757
what should I do then

[03-Aug-19 03:37 PM] naezith#9757
something smaller like 100?

[03-Aug-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
for 250,000?

[03-Aug-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
i would try to send all, if it fails, send half

[03-Aug-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
if that fails send quarter

[03-Aug-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
until it works

[03-Aug-19 04:34 PM] naezith#9757
okay so there is no pure math we can get from supply or something

[03-Aug-19 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
depends on exact state of wallet

[03-Aug-19 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
the limit is that each tx cant be larger than 200kb

[03-Aug-19 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
each input needs to be signed, so that is 120 bytes or so, but depending on the type of input, can be a lot bigger

[03-Aug-19 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
its like trying to figure out exactly how many drops of rain a specific area on earth will get, and not knowing where or when

[05-Aug-19 07:45 AM] gcharang#6833
I am not sure if it is clear, the problem is not the "amount of coins"; atleast not directly
the actual problem is the number of inputs the total value is in

Ex: 250000 coins available in 1 input vs 1000 inputs that each have 250 coins
the transaction to send 250000 in the first case will be very small (in terms of data size)
the transaction to send 250000 in the second case is very large(in terms of data size) as it needs to include details about 1000 different inputs and sign all of them

as there is a limit on the maximum size a transaction can be, the above difference matters

[05-Aug-19 09:30 AM] gcharang#6833
you could run this script or similar: https://github.com/TheComputerGenie/Misc_Stuff/blob/master/Wallet%20stuff/Consolidate.sh
on a crontab to consolidate the coins from a large number of utxos on mining nodes

and is it looking as you wanted

[06-Aug-19 08:41 AM] gcharang#6833
@naezith 
that looks correct

for the first option, 
```
don't include -ac_cc in the chain parameters at all
```
that would disable Antara modules

Regarding the texts, the content is accurate. @Daniel CP would be of more help making the copy better

[06-Aug-19 08:43 AM] naezith#9757
yeah it does `don't include -ac_cc in the chain parameters at all`

[06-Aug-19 08:43 AM] naezith#9757
I'll type that instead then

''Do not include -ac_CC in your Smart Chain's parameters''

@TonyL 
here is an update which might create issues:

```
- Reimplemented "Antara Modules" UI.
- Improved ticker input box, space and letters like ≈û √á √ñ are not being typed.
- Tiny UI tweaks.
- Fixed and tested the withdraw issue fully.
- Added Subscription Month Selectors to Cart Page, Cart Sidebar and Tools Page.
- Changed prices.
- Website is served built/statically instead of in development mode.
```

[07-Aug-19 05:52 PM] naezith#9757
so now we have subscription length option

[07-Aug-19 05:52 PM] naezith#9757
1-3-6-12 months

[07-Aug-19 05:53 PM] naezith#9757
though subscription is not implemented on server-side yet

[07-Aug-19 05:54 PM] naezith#9757
like they don't cancel after 1 month atm, that's the next thing I'll be working on now

[07-Aug-19 05:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Thank you for updates @naezith ! For now we're fine with video I shown you yesterday. I can help to fully test subscription logic when it's ready and make another one with different scenario - lets say another business case with some tricky rewards scheme and monthly payments

I reset password, and after a couple min got reset link. Entered/confirmed new password, screen says to check email for verification link. 30 min later, still no email. 
Clicked resend... waiting.

[08-Aug-19 09:17 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Is email verification after password reset neccessary? Seems duplicate action after already using the password reset link which was emailed to same address.

[08-Aug-19 09:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
verification link arrived after manual resent button clicked.
email link text != href makes spam detection unhappy

- confirm space and special chars not being input for ticker.
- suggest dynamic $ value next to subscription item values, and column each for monthly / total for item
 - cancel and return from coinpayments page clears pending chain order (not sue if intended, just mentioning). Assuming payment works, did not test.

[09-Aug-19 09:31 AM] naezith#9757
I thought about this but there is no space in the row `- suggest dynamic $ value next to subscription item values, and column each for monthly / total for item`

[09-Aug-19 09:32 AM] naezith#9757
I can add it inside the select dropdown maybe

[09-Aug-19 09:32 AM] naezith#9757
yes `- cancel and return from coinpayments page clears pending chain order `

[09-Aug-19 09:54 AM] naezith#9757
whoa that email link thingy is so weird

[09-Aug-19 09:54 AM] naezith#9757
it's basically plain text in the code

[09-Aug-19 09:55 AM] naezith#9757
sendgrid turns it into their own url somehow

[09-Aug-19 09:55 AM] naezith#9757
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator there shouldn't be any email verification after password reset

this happens for me

[09-Aug-19 09:56 AM] naezith#9757
email verification should occur only if you didn't do email verification before

[09-Aug-19 09:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I recall having some problem recieving the verification link testing early on, I think I used gmail on the second attempt to get in so that makes sense. The address used last night probably wasnt verified until yesterday

[06-Sep-19 02:00 PM] naezith#9757
Nodes got been separated to "Base Nodes" and "Nodes", latter is being extra

[06-Sep-19 02:01 PM] naezith#9757
@Daniel CP

[06-Sep-19 02:02 PM] naezith#9757
that "You need at least two nodes to run a Smart Chain" is now the "Base Nodes"

[06-Sep-19 02:02 PM] naezith#9757
though I think we should hide that "two" so quantity will be a mystery

[06-Sep-19 02:44 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Hi @naezith I'm happy to help but not sure what you need

[06-Sep-19 02:45 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Should I write 3 new lines for the "NODES" page on the right in the image you sent?

[06-Sep-19 02:50 PM] naezith#9757
both needs to be updated I think

[06-Sep-19 02:50 PM] naezith#9757
doesn't have to be `new` lines but I need to fill them, so 6 lines

[06-Sep-19 03:59 PM] Daniel CP#2020
OK sure, no problem. I'll get it done shortly

[09-Sep-19 09:50 AM] naezith#9757
@Daniel CP any update?

[09-Sep-19 09:52 AM] naezith#9757
btw the site is updated, now we have Subscription working fully.  also it's possible now to add new tools and nodes, or extend the tool subscription of existing chains

[09-Sep-19 09:56 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Sorry, forgot to get this done over the weekend

[09-Sep-19 09:56 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I still need a bit more context. What is the difference between Base Nodes and Nodes?

[09-Sep-19 09:57 AM] Daniel CP#2020
If we are requiring two base nodes for every Smart Chain, would it make sense to remove that from the UI completely? And just encourage people to add more nodes?

[09-Sep-19 10:05 AM] naezith#9757
since we have subscription system, nodes get terminated when subscription expires. but we need two base nodes to stay alive because the tools depend on them. so we have a fixed price for the base nodes which will live as long as chain is alive, and extra nodes can be created and expire/die separately @Daniel CP
