@owerache you have an idea how are designed this kind of bot usually ?

[24-Jul-19 01:09 PM] owerache#0341
Yes, I did mine for #barterlly... If you have a json that I can curl all the time I can post you the information

A json shouldn't be too hard to generate (but I've just started reading about crypto recently)

[24-Jul-19 01:14 PM] owerache#0341
yes very simple ðŸ˜ƒ

[24-Jul-19 01:19 PM] Slyris#2880
I mean the design of a whales bot

Whale Alert | Home
Whale Alert. Live tracking of large crypto transactions from and to exchanges

[24-Jul-19 01:25 PM] owerache#0341
it seems to me that you have access to the blockchain data after that it's just setintervall: D which is connected either in RPC or via an API but it's obvious

[24-Jul-19 01:26 PM] Slyris#2880
We talk around 6pm I will explain you why it's can be little bit tricky

[24-Jul-19 01:28 PM] owerache#0341
if you want... but I really think there's a way to produce this via a KMD node and a small API

[24-Jul-19 01:31 PM] Slyris#2880
Yes but this is probably ot of scope for the moment

[24-Jul-19 01:31 PM] Slyris#2880
But if we can have some exchange volume from #atomicdex-beta I would love to add this feature

[24-Jul-19 01:33 PM] owerache#0341
Well the same, via API you could share all public offers in real time on discord/twitter and other network as well as daily volumes

[24-Jul-19 01:35 PM] Slyris#2880
Yes this I can do it totally

[24-Jul-19 01:36 PM] Slyris#2880
But I suspect whales alert to put a watcher on big wallet and periodically check for new transaction from them

[24-Jul-19 01:36 PM] Slyris#2880
(I don't like it personally, but if this is a needed feature why not)

[24-Jul-19 03:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
this is already really easy to do from a node and a few hours of work, funds tracking is a walk in the park

[24-Jul-19 03:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
(I already did this in production, but don't report the values, it was used to track the hacker's funds)

[24-Jul-19 03:21 PM] Slyris#2880
May be but do we really need this feature urgently ? To tracks whales !

[24-Jul-19 03:21 PM] Slyris#2880
?

[24-Jul-19 03:21 PM] Slyris#2880
Because to be honest is like a toy for me

[24-Jul-19 03:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
goind back to genesis and mapping an use of all addresses involved

[24-Jul-19 03:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
it s not just about whales

[24-Jul-19 03:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
but cointing the "real" value aside of tx

[24-Jul-19 03:22 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok why not then !

[24-Jul-19 03:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
obviously dummy transaction may fake it, but this is easily traceable

[24-Jul-19 03:22 PM] Slyris#2880
We will plan it for mid term support then

[24-Jul-19 03:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
there s a huge difference betweek reported values and fake volumes submitted via API

[24-Jul-19 03:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
blockchain never lies, if you know how to gather infos

[24-Jul-19 03:23 PM] Slyris#2880
I think that if I can have the volume from mm2 Dex it's can be cool

[24-Jul-19 03:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
you can do far more than that

[24-Jul-19 03:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
relying on specific tools you also can parse which coin gets the most volume for a specific pair

[24-Jul-19 03:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
and adapt the marketing strategy

[24-Jul-19 03:24 PM] Slyris#2880
Doesn't hesitate to open issues for feature request !

[24-Jul-19 03:25 PM] Slyris#2880
On the GitHub repository so I can follow everything

[24-Jul-19 03:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
I need to get used to the API before, hopefully in a few weeks, but this is really something easy to do once you got any node running

[24-Jul-19 03:26 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok great !

[24-Jul-19 03:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
back then I developped a tool to gather all NN infos to check and multiparse data to give live alarming of forks

[24-Jul-19 03:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
https://notarystats.com, now private

[24-Jul-19 03:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
there is also an android app that did this

[24-Jul-19 03:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
live alarming of hashrate spikes etc

[24-Jul-19 03:27 PM] Slyris#2880
I'm still new in the blockchain, that's why all the concept for me are not evident.

[24-Jul-19 03:27 PM] Slyris#2880
But I think once I understand everything become really easy.

[24-Jul-19 03:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
hint : calculate deltas between network hash

[24-Jul-19 03:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
based on an extended timeframe

[24-Jul-19 03:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
so you ll spot quasi instantly any attempr of attack

[24-Jul-19 03:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
and parsing the values may also be used to track "dwyattacks" attempts

[24-Jul-19 03:28 PM] Slyris#2880
Nice.

[24-Jul-19 03:28 PM] Slyris#2880
Pretty neat

[24-Jul-19 03:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
it s all about security and automation

[24-Jul-19 03:29 PM] Slyris#2880
I need to think about what we really want in this clone of coinmarketcap

[24-Jul-19 03:29 PM] Slyris#2880
And not over engineer to much too

[24-Jul-19 03:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
I managed to build standalone libs

[24-Jul-19 03:29 PM] Slyris#2880
For the moment I use coinpaprika API which do a great job for me.

[24-Jul-19 03:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
ready to go with a fresh server, installing, monitoring, fixing and reporting being done auto

[24-Jul-19 03:30 PM] Slyris#2880
This is really nice, it's public ?

[24-Jul-19 03:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
it was back then but not anymore

[24-Jul-19 03:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
noone was really interested, and now it s totally rebuilt to be fully stable and errorproof  in python, there is a learning curve

[24-Jul-19 03:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don t want to use js personally

[24-Jul-19 03:32 PM] Slyris#2880
I'm currently writing this application in Golang

[24-Jul-19 03:32 PM] Slyris#2880
For ease of use mainly.

[24-Jul-19 03:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
yep

[24-Jul-19 03:32 PM] Slyris#2880
But I'm originally from c/c++/c#/ASM/Nim/Haskell

[24-Jul-19 03:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
the important is not the code but interaction and logic

[24-Jul-19 03:33 PM] Slyris#2880
Well, I'm a big fan of TDD to be honest with you. I try do to the cleanest API possible

[24-Jul-19 03:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
distributed reports are really a good way to do and don t forget you got potentially 60+ NN that can act as a base for data gathering

[24-Jul-19 03:33 PM] Slyris#2880
Not exactly API agnostic at the moment for obvious reason

[24-Jul-19 03:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
as long as it is audited and validated, there is no harm, specifically if you don t use any external lib

[24-Jul-19 03:34 PM] Slyris#2880
I use some external library that already under review'

I want to know and control every single line of code

[24-Jul-19 03:35 PM] Slyris#2880
Well this is true but in a langage like Golang you won't do this.

[24-Jul-19 03:35 PM] Slyris#2880
Especially when you write webapp

[24-Jul-19 03:35 PM] Slyris#2880
If you need some speed and low memory consumption

[24-Jul-19 03:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
py is very very light

[24-Jul-19 03:36 PM] Slyris#2880
It's will take years to recode from scratch a package that have the quality of fasthttp

[24-Jul-19 03:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah but don t forget that some parts are not intended to be ran on individual computers, users gathering data makes no sense, nodes do

[24-Jul-19 03:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
and nodes at least have a dedicated core and a little amount of ram

[24-Jul-19 03:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
core or thread, but it depens on what you want to achieve

[24-Jul-19 03:38 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah I perfectly understand.

[24-Jul-19 03:38 PM] Slyris#2880
But I'm rewriting from scratch only when it's totally needed like writting a specific algorithm

[24-Jul-19 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
then auditing is key :)

[24-Jul-19 03:38 PM] Slyris#2880
That's why I opened the issue

[24-Jul-19 03:38 PM] Slyris#2880
For the security team

[24-Jul-19 03:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah

[24-Jul-19 03:39 PM] Slyris#2880
With all my explanation

[24-Jul-19 03:39 PM] Slyris#2880
I carefully choose my dependencies

[24-Jul-19 03:39 PM] Slyris#2880
And I lock specific commit, they are not revertable or falsifiable.

[24-Jul-19 03:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
even py use some like requests or all, but ad long as it s a core one and not an external one it s safer

[24-Jul-19 03:39 PM] Slyris#2880
Advantage of Golang modules.

[24-Jul-19 03:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
I should really look at this
