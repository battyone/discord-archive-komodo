[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> @Privatoshi - Ambassador hehe, i was gonna ask about dark mode 🙂

[10-Sep-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> At least Sri knows now I'm asking for legit things lol

[10-Sep-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I like the white/blue

[10-Sep-19 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> @gigamesh What do u think of the portal?

[10-Sep-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Sri said he will address the dark theme etc, a little after some more important stuff first

[10-Sep-19 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Sep-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> no

[10-Sep-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> what projects compete with utrum?

[10-Sep-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> and why is it called utrum?

[10-Sep-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Cant just name one because every module we have is a different project

[10-Sep-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Its a combination of over 8 projects

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Our cryptos page is cmc, reviews is revain, prediction is cindicator, steemit - feed and content rewards, binance research - reports,  news - medium coin blogs, so on

[10-Sep-19 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> What does Utrum mean?

Utrum is the Latin term which means "whether", as in "or", and we chose this for a portal where members are voting and choosing between two opposing viewpoints..." whether this or that."
What is the significance of OOT?

Utrum is pronounced "Oothrum" in Latin, so we took the first three letters from this pronunciation, "OOT", for our Token symbol. However, for our project, Utrum is pronounced "You Trum" and OOT is pronounce exactly as it's spelled, "OOT"

[10-Sep-19 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I think we are better than all 8 combined.

[12-Sep-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Luke - DE Ambassador> hey guys. I am writing an article about utrum. can somebody explain in words whats the difference between a report and an insight?

[12-Sep-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Insight can be an article - research, opinion, code reviews or SWOT analysis

[12-Sep-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Report is more detailed analysis

[12-Sep-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Luke - DE Ambassador> ok

[12-Sep-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Reports can be like binance research, more detailed, covers every aspect of project

[13-Sep-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> Hi @Sri - Lead - i put up by last review on utrum and got a message saying it has to be moderated and checked if its original. It has been published elsewhere so will flag ur system. To be clear it is my review, but how will such conflicts be resolved in future.. on a case by case basis?

[13-Sep-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Mixic - RU Ambassador> I think it's just the usual protection against spam. It's okay.

[13-Sep-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @gigamesh yes, it's case by case. Moderators will look into it

[13-Sep-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ok thanks

[13-Sep-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> copy/pasting from the wordpress site was pretty easy. couple things were wonky and needed fixing but thats usually the case in these sorts of situations

[13-Sep-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> e.g. youtube vids never copy across well

[13-Sep-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @gigamesh Its approved now

[13-Sep-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> why cant I edit after submission @Sri - Lead ?

[13-Sep-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> It goes to blockchain

[13-Sep-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We can do it like steemit but for now, you cant edit

[13-Sep-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> can u show me the txid for my Loki review?

[13-Sep-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> or how can i find it?

[13-Sep-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yes, it appears after voting

[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> voting closed? why closed?

[13-Sep-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Voting is open only for 3 days

[13-Sep-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> for every post

[13-Sep-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> why?

[13-Sep-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Because the whole system is based on member voting and we cant keep it forever

[13-Sep-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Based on member voting, rewards and reputation are assigned

[13-Sep-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> this "voting" is not the  same as the moderator check, right?

[13-Sep-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> if yes why not 30 days?

[13-Sep-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> yes, its member voting

[13-Sep-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 30 days is too long for people to receive rewards and urs

[13-Sep-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> moderation is different, it only happens for 3 things

[13-Sep-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> copied content, flagged posts and spam

[13-Sep-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> so i publish... get rewards first 3 days... then what?

[13-Sep-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> nothing

[13-Sep-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> still rewarded or not?

[13-Sep-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ouch

[13-Sep-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Your post can be viewed forever but you wont receive rewards or reputation for that

[13-Sep-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> if it goes "viral" after 3 days i get nothing?

[13-Sep-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yeah nothing

[13-Sep-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> u dont think thats harsh?

[13-Sep-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> But you get more followers

[13-Sep-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> It means more votes for your next post

[13-Sep-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> There has to be some deadline and we chose 3 days

[13-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ok i didnt read ToS, do u plan on sharing ad revenue?

[13-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yes

[13-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> so i will b rewarded after 3 days? in future?

[13-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> for ad revenue?

[13-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We need to revisit that

[13-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> For now we thought 3 days is a good window because most people read it and vote it by then

[13-Sep-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> how did u arrive at  3 days and r u prepared to change this number thru community vote?

[13-Sep-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yes ofcourse

[13-Sep-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> If community thinks 3 days is very less, we can change it

[13-Sep-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> @Privatoshi - Ambassador im interested in ur input here

[13-Sep-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> But I bet everyone likes 3 days

[13-Sep-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> 3 is IMHO waaay too little

[13-Sep-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Reason, being rewards

[13-Sep-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> but maybe im missing something?

[13-Sep-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Imagine we have 1000 posts on portal per day

[13-Sep-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> then every one cant vote every post

[13-Sep-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> People are impatient giga

[13-Sep-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Initially I thought of 15 days

[13-Sep-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> if u tell them wait and get more money... they will wait

[13-Sep-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> in my experience

[13-Sep-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Once we grow, we go for community vote and decide then

[13-Sep-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ok, sounds good 👍

[13-Sep-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 3 days, 7 days, 15 days, 30 days

[13-Sep-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Let people choose

[13-Sep-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> i say x10

[13-Sep-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
