[13-Sep-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Those safeguards give the platform credibility

[13-Sep-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763

[13-Sep-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I inquired

[13-Sep-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I was curious

[13-Sep-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> They do HUSH & KMD too

[13-Sep-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> anyway I digress...

[13-Sep-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> More questions Giga

[13-Sep-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Do you like the Portal?

[13-Sep-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Utrum is for the community... that's no so prevalent in crypto, in general.

[13-Sep-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @gigamesh

[13-Sep-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Time Based

Example - If everyone votes at the same time within a shortspan of window, then our algorithm detects it and our moderators check if any manipulation is involved

Distribution

Example - If everyone votes in the same rating, excellent or bad, then our algorithm detects it and our moderators will check if any manipulation is involved

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Detailed explanation of algo is on White Paper

[13-Sep-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> @Privatoshi - Ambassador actually yes I do, more than I thought I would @Sri - Lead the only 2 methods I am aware of which can prevent a Sybil attack (assuming that is the correct term in this context) is 1. Fee-for-service, or 2. a proof-of-work, or some other non-trivial  proof ..... are the counter-measures u mentioned above enough to stop a determined attacker?

[13-Sep-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> For this system, for the portal, these safeguards are very strong.

[13-Sep-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> For now we have this, as we move forward, we will revisit the strategy based on attack vectors

[13-Sep-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> i could creat e 1000 accounts at 0 cost, right?

[13-Sep-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> fee as a service, we considered it

[13-Sep-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> it was emmans suggestion

[13-Sep-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Look at Revain  @gigamesh

[13-Sep-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> I will

[13-Sep-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> They mail out bounties to get users to come post reviews

[13-Sep-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> As we are new, most people wont pay, so avoided it for now

[13-Sep-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> That's our competition lol.

[13-Sep-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I think we stand up very well, to anyone else that offers a similar product

[13-Sep-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> From day 1

[13-Sep-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I used Revain, Cindicator

[13-Sep-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @Zafer - TR Ambassador You need to do something special to get oot from emman

[13-Sep-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763

[13-Sep-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @gigamesh You might bypass our antispam and create accounts

[13-Sep-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> But you need to enter your 2fa code for every post and vote you make

[13-Sep-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Hahaha

[13-Sep-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> so thats 1000 times you need to enter

[13-Sep-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Too many clicks

[13-Sep-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> unprofitable

[13-Sep-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> 😂

[13-Sep-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We setup a slider for that reason 🙂

[13-Sep-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Voting is a slider, bots cant do it

[13-Sep-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> 🍿 🍿

[13-Sep-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We spent enough time to think about all possible scenarios @gigamesh

[13-Sep-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So if a bot has to be successful, it needs to do 3 things right

[13-Sep-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 1. Bypass our antispam

[13-Sep-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 2. Auth code for post and vote

[13-Sep-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 3. Slider for voting

[13-Sep-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Its slide and click

[13-Sep-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> ☝️☝️☝️

[13-Sep-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> If we ever see a bot succeeded with all these 3, we come up with a 4

[13-Sep-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Let there be no doubt about that

[13-Sep-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Fee to signup is not effective method according to me, see  Steemit  for example

[13-Sep-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Most products will only have 1, at most 2 safeguards, Utrum has 3. 
KuCoin has 3.

[13-Sep-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> EOS requires a fee, to create a wallet
