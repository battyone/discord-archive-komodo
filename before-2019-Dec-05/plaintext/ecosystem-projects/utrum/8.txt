[dscrdutrum] <StewieBlue> Hi team! Still no reply from zelcore?

[19-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - Blockchain Dev> @Sri - Lead i filled the form with your address, they didn't write back, right?

[19-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> They dint

[19-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - Blockchain Dev> These things take time, @StewieBlue

[19-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <StewieBlue> Why my address? What address?

[19-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - Blockchain Dev> Sri's address, not yours.

[19-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Apr-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> we did, they said they will check us at later date, same is said by bittrex

[19-Apr-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> so when alpha launches we have a good chance to get into both

[19-Apr-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Mr.Cryptodude> I hope they do, when did you apply?

[19-Apr-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Mr.Cryptodude> If we get listed on both this coin will prob 5-10 x

[19-Apr-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Its been months

[19-Apr-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> They want to see Live Project

[19-Apr-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> September I guess

[19-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> They have doubts as we dont have working product, so they are playing wait and see

[19-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Now, when we release alpha, they will be confident to list us

[19-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Lot of things will change when we release Alpha

[19-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We could find new VC, we could get listed on major exchanges, normal investors will feel confident to invest

[19-Apr-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So hopefully we will get the traction we deserve

Hi here :).
Barterlly is now open on BETA mode, and will provide tools for users and CoinOwners to perform OTC trades in a safe way.
Any KMD assetchain dPowed will be listed, and supported, for free.
Other coins not already listed can submit a listing application at : https://barterlly.typeform.com/to/iqpS1H
During the BETA, Barterlly won't charge any fee other than the transaction ones. after the release we will charge 1% on top of every transaction.
Our goal is to provide premium tools for coins listed on the platform. (Discord swapbot, twitter integration, public orders, wallet integration, API, custom templating, and many more).
Feel free to join us on our Discord.
https://discord.gg/RHc95zw
The app link is located at : https://app.barterlly.io
We are open to suggestions, and partnerships.

See you soon !

Barterlly's team
