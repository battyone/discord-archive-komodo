[05-Dec-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Employee Benefits are salaries

[05-Dec-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Other expenses are Exchange Listing fees

[05-Dec-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> that's a lot, @Sri - Project Lead

[05-Dec-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Every exchange wants 3 BTC minimum Emman

[05-Dec-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> HitBTC asked 30 BTC lol, Coinbene 15 BTC

[05-Dec-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> Hitbtc is one of the worst!

[05-Dec-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> are we going to do something about verushash fork? are we cool?

[05-Dec-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> @Zafer - TR Ambassador you mean the KMD fork that implements changes from VRSC and activates Sapling?

[05-Dec-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> yeah

[05-Dec-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> We're cool, yeah,  we decided to not implement sapling yet.

[05-Dec-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> But we're preparing for the next mandatory fork, we'll implement Sapling then.

[05-Dec-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> awesome

[06-Dec-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> Welcome back, @Cruz

[06-Dec-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> @Emmanuel  What's up, Emman?

[06-Dec-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> Or should I say, Utrum Dev Ops? Lol

[06-Dec-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> doing fine, a lot of work lately

[06-Dec-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> That's bc you are a big shot... Congrats man

[06-Dec-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> Ive always liked Utrum

[06-Dec-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> How did you think I knew that Bin Info comparison, off hand?

[06-Dec-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> @Emmanuel  Anything I can do to help? 
If so, just ask.. I have no problem doing that...

[06-Dec-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> Yes, #marketing  always needs help. And next week we'll ask all of our community members to test the new software, the wallet.

[06-Dec-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> Will it run on 32-Bit?

[06-Dec-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> Can I make a suggestion? Or just say a few things about wallets @Emmanuel

[06-Dec-18 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> not sure about that, probably no 32 bit

[06-Dec-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> The 2 examples I'd look at and look at their successes are, O3 Mobile Wallet and Trust..  And I'd look at the APH wallet, bc in my opinion, it's the best looking wallet in crypto--even if the project has tanked....

[06-Dec-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> O3 started out just as a Neo wallet...
Then it was able to integrate a working Dex for Switcheo, in a matter of one or two weeks...
Now it is a wonderful app....
Should be a crypto project, in my opinion

[06-Dec-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> Trust---started off as an Ethereum wallet, for tokens, too.. Ran smoothly... Then CZ bought it... It looked just as good when it wasn't Binance's Wallet

[06-Dec-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> @Cruz Most wallets are using shapeshift, changelly

[06-Dec-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Did you check Exodus, I guess that's the best in my opinion

[06-Dec-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> I just meant, in my opinion for overall use, O3 & Trust have been the most successful---with the time they have had & what they've done with it. They seem like good models, or examples... And Aphelion, it just looks good, imo...

[06-Dec-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> interesting

[06-Dec-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> This is the Dex integrated into O3

[06-Dec-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> That is damn impressive. 
It started out as a wallet, just for holding NEO...
Then it became the Switcheo DEX.. And they've upgraded it twice now.. They integrated it in a matter of weeks, if i remember right

[06-Dec-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> That is another screen within the app...
It's pretty nice ..

I think Utrum's wallet looks really good too...
I like the White/Blue

[06-Dec-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> I'm going to start buying, smaller amounts of Utrum, on a regular basis--maybe weekly... I like the project. The devs aren't too bad, either.... 
How can I help out with Marketing? I'll go ask there

[06-Dec-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> Binance Info, is using average Binance User's Submissions, to fill it out its Platform---and paying BNB as a bounty to do it...

You guys should document this, just in case

[06-Dec-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763

But that is a useful thing, to offer

How does OOT Holding Reward (OHR) work?
Example, if you hold 1000 OOT for 60 days, you get 1010 OOT at the end of the time period.
