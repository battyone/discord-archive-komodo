@Sri it would be nice to add oracles CC for the reports and all the data that will be used.

[03-Nov-18 09:16 PM] Sri#6686
Yes, @siu - Chainmakers

[03-Nov-18 09:16 PM] Sri#6686
We plan to use it for rewards payments on portal

[03-Nov-18 10:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But that is the rewards cc

[03-Nov-18 10:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Oracles cc would help with managing data feeds for the reports

[05-Nov-18 07:40 AM] Sri#6686

Do you think people should stop saying #HODL & #BUIDL and start saying #HOLD & #BUILD ?

What do you prefer? 🤔

[28-Nov-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Jimm B.> there are not many votes but I think it is time to become more serious and no longer use the term hodl.

[28-Nov-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> @Jimm B. I agree. What could we use instead?

[28-Nov-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Jimm B.> @Emmanuel I do not have an alternative yet but I'll think about it! Maybe you can let the community vote when you have collected several ideas

[28-Nov-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> Yes, that's a good idea.

[28-Nov-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> For now, the wallet will be released with its HODL tab, where you can time lock your coins and get rewards for it.

[28-Nov-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> But if you have a better name for it, i want to know.

[28-Nov-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> Me too, i'll think about it.

[28-Nov-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Lets call it Hold then

[29-Nov-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab> I agree with Hold.
