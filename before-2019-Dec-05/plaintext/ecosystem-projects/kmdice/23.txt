the forkwitch pool has been weird at least from my limited pool experience

[22-Oct-18 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
thinking there's probably a tx in mempool that is breaking a consensus rule

[22-Oct-18 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
stratum's continually trying to put it into a block

[22-Oct-18 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
who has a good amount of hash rate, want to test if it's that?

[22-Oct-18 03:15 PM] Llama#1330
I do

[22-Oct-18 03:16 PM] Llama#1330
But I probably can’t help you

[22-Oct-18 03:17 PM] Alright#0419
Pool node needs to restart with `-minrelayfee=99999999`

[22-Oct-18 03:17 PM] Alright#0419
it'll reject all txs from the mempool

[22-Oct-18 03:21 PM] Llama#1330
I’m on pool.forkwitch

[22-Oct-18 03:22 PM] Alright#0419
@forkwitch can you try that?

[22-Oct-18 03:23 PM] Alright#0419
I need to know what error the daemon is giving when stratum tries to submit a block to it

https://gist.github.com/DeckerSU/1c161fd93b0a1dbaa722343f9e18020d - gotcha ... now need to analyze what's wrong with the block format.

[22-Oct-18 03:30 PM] Alright#0419

[22-Oct-18 03:30 PM] Alright#0419
oh nope, nevermind sorry

[22-Oct-18 03:31 PM] Alright#0419
is that latest block height

[22-Oct-18 03:35 PM] Alright#0419
can't even use submitblock on that 🤔

[22-Oct-18 03:35 PM] Alright#0419
bash shell doesn't seem to like that

[22-Oct-18 03:41 PM] c2k#4915
i put 1msol into blackjoker pool earlier but pulled after seeing the problems discussed in here.
i can try again if someone wants

[22-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Alright#0419
someone running a pool needs to try mining empty blocks

[22-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Alright#0419
see if it works

[22-Oct-18 03:42 PM] c2k#4915
ah not me. sry

[22-Oct-18 03:47 PM] forkwitch#6080
@jl777c  Try https://pool.forkwitch.com, finds lot of blocks.

[22-Oct-18 03:48 PM] Alright#0419
not right now it ain't

[22-Oct-18 03:48 PM] Alright#0419
lol

[22-Oct-18 03:48 PM] Alright#0419
try mining empty blocks @forkwitch

[22-Oct-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
something happened in the last 10 blocks

[22-Oct-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
taking hours for them to be found

[22-Oct-18 03:48 PM] Alright#0419
mempool is huge

[22-Oct-18 03:49 PM] Alright#0419
couldn't begin to try to go through it looking for something weird

[22-Oct-18 03:49 PM] Decker#3767
we just need to investigate what's wrong with blockhex i posted above ... block header is correct ... need to check every of 432 txes in it ... may be one of these txes has wrong format.

[22-Oct-18 03:49 PM] Alright#0419
when you submit it, what error do you get?

[22-Oct-18 03:49 PM] forkwitch#6080
TX spammer maybe.

[22-Oct-18 03:49 PM] Alright#0419
should give you some info as to why it's rejected

[22-Oct-18 03:50 PM] Decker#3767
@Alright i already noticed it )

[22-Oct-18 03:51 PM] forkwitch#6080
Should i remove TX from mining to get one block minted?

[22-Oct-18 03:51 PM] Alright#0419
try it

[22-Oct-18 03:51 PM] Decker#3767
we don't need to mine empty blocks, it's easy to modify pool to ignore txes ... we should find a root of issue.

[22-Oct-18 03:52 PM] Alright#0419
trying to do that

[22-Oct-18 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
seems there is a tx that gets into the mempool that will be rejected

[22-Oct-18 03:52 PM] forkwitch#6080
If we have TXhash i can only ban this one. Maybe better than to remove all transactions.

[22-Oct-18 03:52 PM] Alright#0419
if it can't mine empty blocks, it's not a tx that is the problem

[22-Oct-18 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it is mining a small number of tx

will reject all txs from mempool

[22-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Decker#3767
and root of issue in incorrect block format ... pool generates a block and trying to submit it with `submitblock`, daemon reject the block, bcz it can't decode it ...

[22-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Alright#0419
oh change the transactions.js file in node-stratum-pool module

[22-Oct-18 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a consensus bug where it gets into mempool but it is invalid in a block

[22-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Alright#0419
yea so that doesn't sound like a tx that is causing it

[22-Oct-18 03:54 PM] Alright#0419
submit block would work if it were a specific tx causing it

[22-Oct-18 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the error message is a catch all, somethings they arent to be trusted literally

[22-Oct-18 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`daemon reject the block, bcz it can't decode it`
I can't see how that's the issue when he says there's nothing in daemon debug

[22-Oct-18 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
most likely is that mempool accepts it, so it is mined into a block and then fails validation

[22-Oct-18 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Block notification via p2p`

[22-Oct-18 03:55 PM] Decker#3767
now we have a blockhex ... and we can put any debug printouts in daemon to find the issue. just use `submitblock` with this `blockhex` ...

[22-Oct-18 04:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its been more than 3 minutes waiting for the hex to paste 😂

[22-Oct-18 04:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
2 blocks went thorugh

I've got 400k aimed at a solo pool that I know works, will see if it errors the same

Lmk when the pool is fixed

[22-Oct-18 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, confirmed that issue is not pool related fwiw

[22-Oct-18 04:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
how?

[22-Oct-18 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The codebase for my solo pool is one I trust
While it shares the same origin as webbys, the overwinter and taxes removal was done differently and more thoroughly

[22-Oct-18 04:52 PM] jorian#4555
mempool isn't cleared yet, somehow those transactions aren't mined

[22-Oct-18 04:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there have to be blocks for txes to be mined *in*

[22-Oct-18 04:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
:trollface:

[22-Oct-18 04:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's only been 3 blocks in last hr

[22-Oct-18 04:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But blocks are empty while mempool is full

[22-Oct-18 04:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Do these txs eventually timeout?

[22-Oct-18 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
last block had 11 txes, so not really "empty"

[22-Oct-18 04:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Sorry, not empty. But not as full as they should

[22-Oct-18 05:02 PM] manfromafar (poolofd32th.club)#2786
good there are only 6txs in the mem pool

[22-Oct-18 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`only 6txs in the mem pool`
Then we have different mempools 😛

different nodes see different mempools

[22-Oct-18 05:04 PM] Llama#1330
Is it an easy fix?

[22-Oct-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to find the killer tx that gets in the mempool but is invalid and makes the block rejecte

[22-Oct-18 05:05 PM] manfromafar (poolofd32th.club)#2786
_slowly mines with 14ksol_

@Decker how can I get nomp to output raw hex of block

[22-Oct-18 05:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
DeckerToday at 9:37 AM
btw, may be this will useful, to print hex block simply edit pool.js with this:

   ` function SubmitBlock(blockHex, callback) {
        var rpcCommand, rpcArgs;
        if (options.hasSubmitMethod) {
            rpcCommand = 'submitblock';
            rpcArgs = [blockHex];
        } else {
            rpcCommand = 'getblocktemplate';
            rpcArgs = [{
                'mode': 'submit',
                'data': blockHex
            }];
        }
        emitLog('Block hex : ' + blockHex);  // add this line
        _this.daemon.cmd(rpcCommand,
            rpcArgs,
            function(results) {
                for (var i = 0; i < results.length; i++) {`
