[25-Oct-18 08:12 PM] Alright#0419
there's another really simple dos vector

[25-Oct-18 08:12 PM] Alright#0419
besides that bug

[25-Oct-18 08:12 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`jok3r seems to have a KMDICE pool killer script
running

AlrightToday at 3:11 PM
based on what?`
Based on what he said he was doing

[25-Oct-18 08:13 PM] Alright#0419
where did he say that

[25-Oct-18 08:13 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
somewhere back where he posted screenshots

[25-Oct-18 08:13 PM] jorian#4555
we assumed that because his butt hurts

[25-Oct-18 08:13 PM] jorian#4555
just kidding

[25-Oct-18 08:13 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
no, I think he was doing same as I was, an auto-play script

[25-Oct-18 08:13 PM] jorian#4555
no he was not really destroying it right? more like testing

[25-Oct-18 08:14 PM] jorian#4555
yes, playing

[25-Oct-18 08:14 PM] Alright#0419
it works, I tested it

[25-Oct-18 08:14 PM] Alright#0419
prevents people from betting

[25-Oct-18 08:15 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
methinks it would have been far worse than 300-400 if it were intentionally to do damage

[25-Oct-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
uses up all entropy tx and also gets the mempool to where it cant be mined

[25-Oct-18 08:15 PM] Alright#0419
separate isssue from the mempool thing entirely

[25-Oct-18 08:16 PM] Alright#0419
even after that is fixed, this still exists

[25-Oct-18 08:16 PM] Alright#0419
min bet needs to be upped

[25-Oct-18 08:16 PM] Alright#0419
or just 1000s and 1000s of entropy UTXOs at all times

[25-Oct-18 08:16 PM] Alright#0419
like enough to where the script won't spend them all before the next block is found

[25-Oct-18 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
most of those 300 were a bet of 1+

[25-Oct-18 08:18 PM] Alright#0419
separate isssue from the mempool thing entirely

[25-Oct-18 08:18 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
ok, I'm going back to bed now 游녦游낖

[25-Oct-18 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
not getting blocks makes thing massively worse

[25-Oct-18 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
new block create the entropy tx from the change

[25-Oct-18 08:28 PM] Alright#0419
someone try bets, want to see how effective this is

[25-Oct-18 08:37 PM] Alright#0419
@jorian @siu - Chainmakers needs to raise min bet of the dice plan, add entropy utxos constantly or have multiple diceplans

[25-Oct-18 08:37 PM] Alright#0419
eating up all the UTXOs every block is cheap as dirt

[25-Oct-18 08:37 PM] jorian#4555
wallet can't handle all those utxos

[25-Oct-18 08:38 PM] Alright#0419
what do you mean?

[25-Oct-18 08:38 PM] SHossain#0007
use latest FSM branch

[25-Oct-18 08:39 PM] SHossain#0007
rather than dev or beta

[25-Oct-18 08:39 PM] jorian#4555
my server got slow with all those utxos i sent

[25-Oct-18 08:39 PM] jorian#4555
am rebooting now

[25-Oct-18 08:39 PM] Alright#0419
I already ate up every single one

[25-Oct-18 08:40 PM] Alright#0419
see my point here? 游땐

[25-Oct-18 08:40 PM] SHossain#0007
UTXO eater!

[25-Oct-18 08:40 PM] jorian#4555
hehe

[25-Oct-18 08:40 PM] jorian#4555
so now what?

[25-Oct-18 08:40 PM] Alright#0419
somehow raise minbet?

[25-Oct-18 08:40 PM] SHossain#0007
how to edit existing dice plan?

[25-Oct-18 08:41 PM] Alright#0419
yea... about that...

[25-Oct-18 08:42 PM] Alright#0419
if two txs spend the same input, which one does a miner mine

[25-Oct-18 08:42 PM] Alright#0419
the first one or the one with higher tx fee?

[25-Oct-18 08:45 PM] wookie#7663
i'm not sure if this matters. I ran KMDice from cli about a week ago, then shut down the wallet. I've been mining KMDice on/off since. I just now downloaded the 43b agama wallet. I'm just now syncing the KMDice native wallet. I'm seeing that all the mining rewards are coming in dated as right now, instead of the dates that I mined them.
I also seem to be stuck on block 9172...

[25-Oct-18 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
maybe solution is add a txfee option to dicebet

[25-Oct-18 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
and just out bidding spammers on the txfee

[25-Oct-18 08:46 PM] Alright#0419
you're on a fork

[25-Oct-18 08:47 PM] wookie#7663
游뱑

[25-Oct-18 08:47 PM] Alright#0419
not sure why it's forked, but I keep seeing messages in debug.log about that chain

[25-Oct-18 08:48 PM] wookie#7663
hmmm, should I just (save wallet) delete blocks and reindex?

[25-Oct-18 08:54 PM] Alright#0419
delete blocks and chainstate dirs and resync

[25-Oct-18 08:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think the house node needs to become a high capacity server too

[25-Oct-18 08:54 PM] Alright#0419
stop the daemon first

[25-Oct-18 09:02 PM] Oszy#5734
I resynced now, getting bet pending result

[25-Oct-18 09:05 PM] Alright#0419
stopping my spam script, bets will start working again in a minute

[25-Oct-18 09:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Lol

[25-Oct-18 09:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Oh well

[25-Oct-18 09:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We will need to fix this

[25-Oct-18 09:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So you cant actually steal the funds. But you can spam the house

[25-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Alright#0419
prevents everyone from betting

[25-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Alright#0419
for cheap

[25-Oct-18 09:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So we need a kiddie pool

[25-Oct-18 09:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I mean another plan for lower size bets

[25-Oct-18 09:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But anyway. The best way to do this is by having just one pool for everyone

[25-Oct-18 09:26 PM] Alright#0419
try to figure out the cost of it at different minbets values

[25-Oct-18 09:26 PM] Alright#0419
and make it cost more than it's worth doing

[25-Oct-18 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
what I don't quite understand is why the script was able to bet so many times here

[25-Oct-18 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
http://kmdice.explorer.dexstats.info/block/000000027da0d1d87acda1098b7fda96f32c68d90c52e2da685fbc6739974ac0

[25-Oct-18 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
then the following blocks there's only a couple utxos

[25-Oct-18 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
how long does a dicebet lock a utxo for?

[25-Oct-18 09:28 PM] Alright#0419
until dicefinish?

[25-Oct-18 09:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It may have been related to doing more entropy tx at the same time as your script was running

[25-Oct-18 09:32 PM] Alright#0419
well yes, I used them up immediately

[25-Oct-18 09:33 PM] Alright#0419
but they should be reusable after dicefinish is called on those bets

[25-Oct-18 09:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jorian

[25-Oct-18 09:33 PM] Alright#0419
so my question is, where are the entropy utxos in the next block coming from?

[25-Oct-18 09:34 PM] Alright#0419
or the block after or after that

[25-Oct-18 09:34 PM] Alright#0419
if dicefinish didn't happen yet, how are there more utxos available once those ones confirmed?

[25-Oct-18 09:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We might have to get some more higher size entropy utxos

[25-Oct-18 09:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Not sure

[25-Oct-18 09:41 PM] Alright#0419
what size are you doing?

[25-Oct-18 09:42 PM] Alright#0419
I think .0001 may only get used once

[25-Oct-18 09:42 PM] Alright#0419
the change of it would be reused each time, but with .0001 I think there is no change

[25-Oct-18 10:15 PM] Llama#1330
is mining working again?

[25-Oct-18 10:16 PM] Alright#0419
@Llama it will until there are 129-255 txs in the mempool or until @forkwitch updates his pool

[25-Oct-18 10:16 PM] Llama#1330
oh rip

[25-Oct-18 10:16 PM] Llama#1330
i guess ill stop then

[25-Oct-18 10:17 PM] Llama#1330
is there another pool?

[25-Oct-18 10:17 PM] Alright#0419
solo mining would be fine

[25-Oct-18 10:17 PM] Alright#0419
but forkswitch's pool will stall when there's between 129 and 255 txs in it's mempool

[25-Oct-18 10:18 PM] Alright#0419
there's https://kmdice.poolofd32th.club/getting_started also

[25-Oct-18 10:18 PM] Alright#0419
but no idea if it's updated

[25-Oct-18 10:19 PM] Alright#0419
can someone ping whoever's pool that is and tell them they *need* this https://github.com/z-classic/node-stratum-pool/issues/39

@Alright my pool is fine. What is the problem?

[25-Oct-18 10:34 PM] Alright#0419
it's not

[25-Oct-18 10:34 PM] Alright#0419
either that fix doesn't work or you haven't applied it

[25-Oct-18 10:35 PM] forkwitch#6080
I mined first block after oversize mempool with 500+ transaction in it.

[25-Oct-18 10:35 PM] Alright#0419
Yea that's expected

[25-Oct-18 10:35 PM] Alright#0419
you can't mine blocks if your mempool has 129-255 txs in it though
