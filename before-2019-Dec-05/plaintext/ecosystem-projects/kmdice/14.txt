It already CPU mines chains under diff 50 automatically

more importanly most blocks have tx, seems we have regular players?

any pools we can mine at?

[20-Oct-18 12:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
only solo atm

[20-Oct-18 12:19 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@furshure123   you would need to setup your own pool

[20-Oct-18 12:20 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
or just point it at the one above,  use address as username

[20-Oct-18 12:21 AM] furshure123#1929
so no pools have been created yet? but cool thanks for the info

[20-Oct-18 12:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
there are mostly solo pools

would it be pointless to mine as a solo miner at this point? i avg 300 sols i think

[20-Oct-18 12:22 AM] Alright#0419
that is the pool stratum

[20-Oct-18 12:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
300 sol, as solo you can t

My pool has a pretty low Max diff I think? Is it working OK or so I need to increase Max?

[20-Oct-18 12:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I also need to set a fee :trollface: 7%

[20-Oct-18 12:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Increase max  ,  it's going to be asic and nicehash dominated soon

Apparently community is up; solving, testing and figuring solutions for KMDICE Assetchain. A pool is up. Explorer is there, and it got now significant hashrate too. I’d just call it a speculative mining.

will there be a BTT ANN?

[20-Oct-18 03:28 AM] hypocalese#3688
I setup a KMD mining pool no problem.  However having trouble with doing the same for an Assetchain i created.  Is there something different about Assetchains to consider for mining?

[20-Oct-18 03:32 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, you need to set the block reward to just the blockreward and not include txfees if you are using coinbase to distribute to miners

[20-Oct-18 03:42 AM] hypocalese#3688
I set it up as a POW/POS coin.  Could that be contributing to my issues?

[20-Oct-18 03:43 AM] hypocalese#3688
Symptom I'm seeing is RPC Calls timeout to Daemon

[20-Oct-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sorry won't be able to update pool diff anytime soon.

[20-Oct-18 03:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I set it up as a POW/POS coin.`
@hypocalese How do you mean?

[20-Oct-18 03:57 AM] hypocalese#3688
I did the parameter -ac_staking=50 when creating.

[20-Oct-18 03:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OH, you made your own chain, I missed that bit

[20-Oct-18 03:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
to mine it you just need to `setgenerate false` and run your stratum same as you would any PoW assetchain

[20-Oct-18 03:59 AM] hypocalese#3688
ok cool

[20-Oct-18 03:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

hello does the kmdice community still need a miningpool with dynamic diff adjuster?

[20-Oct-18 11:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hi @forkwitch welcome. A mining pool was done yesterday. But i guess that the more there are the merrier

[20-Oct-18 11:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Btw, arent you the guy who was trying to hack dPOW?

[20-Oct-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
@forkwitch try to be gentle with the 51% attack on revealing entropy. it is a known vuln, and needs to be fixed for dice2, but certainly a reasonable bounty for implementing the attack

[20-Oct-18 12:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Seems like people are playing... or trying to break it.

[20-Oct-18 01:10 PM] forkwitch#6080
Thank you@siu - Chainmakers i detected a 'risk' and exploited it but also saw the effect of the Notarisation technology when testing attack on EMC2. I have tweeted my finding and information that notarisation hash can safe you when you respect it. 

*try to be gentle with the 51% attack on revealing entropy. it is a known vuln, and needs to be fixed for dice2, but certainly a reasonable bounty for implementing the attack
@jl777c i gonna respect this

[20-Oct-18 01:11 PM] forkwitch#6080
in any way i am not gonna do crash attacks or steal tokens when i make 'tests'

[20-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
community is in the process of making a list of desired features for dice2 CC

[20-Oct-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
51% immunity would be one of them, but it would need to change the entropy reveal process and add a step. my goal for initial dice CC was to make it realtime

[20-Oct-18 01:13 PM] ciumete#3212
hi, is some kmdice pool to be mined ?

[20-Oct-18 01:15 PM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r 
Is this correct for your pool?
stratum+tcp://103.6.12.112:3067

[20-Oct-18 01:15 PM] ciumete#3212
same algo equihash ?

[20-Oct-18 01:16 PM] CrisF#3405
@ciumete I'm not sure if this is still correct.  Maybe @siu - Chainmakers knows?

[20-Oct-18 01:17 PM] ciumete#3212
kmdice is only a test coin ?! i know the chips are for this kind of gambling games !

[20-Oct-18 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
@forkwitch nothing prevents it, i just didnt have time to code and debug the extra hash reveal step

[20-Oct-18 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
being able to prevent usage of the revealed secret is quite tricky, maybe i didnt have a clean solution yet

[20-Oct-18 01:22 PM] forkwitch#6080
I know it is hard to code than to speak. But when the output from the secret is locked until event Y happen it could be a solution? So secret is revealed but not the full requirement to spend connected outputs.

[20-Oct-18 01:23 PM] forkwitch#6080
I am certain you understand though.

[20-Oct-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
i think an atomic secret reveal is needed, so the dicebet side needs to commit the hash of his entropy and then somehow both sides need to reveal the raw entropy at the same time, otherwise the side that didnt could reorg the chain when it is advantageous

[20-Oct-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
some sort of commit followed by reveal phase that cant be 51% attacked would be needed, sort of the opposite of channels CC that relies on a revealed secret to still be revealed even if the payment tx is invalidated via reorg
