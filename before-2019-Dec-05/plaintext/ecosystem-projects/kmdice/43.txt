I don't remember transactions closing or not closing with Peter.   Just use escrow to be sure.

[26-Oct-18 05:42 AM] Elasken#7789
I can not sync kmdice through block 9172. anyone know why please help t

[26-Oct-18 05:51 AM] jl777c#5810
@jorian @siu - Chainmakers using entropy tx of 0.0001 is likely requiring the constant making of entropy tx as it gets used up in one txfee
maybe make entropy tx of 0.01 or even 0.1 ?

[26-Oct-18 06:22 AM] Elasken#7789
Sell 2k kmdice. Pm me

Sent through various warning signals to @Alright about peter @FishyGuts  from last week, escrow for sure ...

@houseOf course I will deposit. You do not have to go around smearing me so. selfish man

[26-Oct-18 06:46 AM] house#8741
1st you need to understand what selfish means
2nd I do not trust you
3rd yes to repair your name is best to use escrow

Can I ask how do you know namdoan89 ?

[26-Oct-18 06:48 AM] Elasken#7789
I do not know him. One time he invited me to sell arrr. and I bought. then he impersonated me. that's what i know

[26-Oct-18 06:49 AM] house#8741
He used your name as sock puppet ?

[26-Oct-18 06:50 AM] house#8741
There is a record here in discord of that transaction ?

i made entropy txns of 0.001 KMDICE

[26-Oct-18 08:00 AM] jorian#4555
i'll set up a crontab today for 0.01 and 0.1 KMDICE entropy txns

[26-Oct-18 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wonder if there is a way to get the number of entropy txs and split if under X like we do with notary nodes utxos

[26-Oct-18 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that seems to be an ideal solution to me.

[26-Oct-18 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I asked for entropy tx total in diceinfo about 400x but so far noone has been able or tried to do it

[26-Oct-18 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
it isnt hard to do, just call CCutxo and count

[26-Oct-18 10:40 AM] Oszy#5734
I still get  "status": "bet still pending" since yesterday, resynced the chain didn't help. Is it still broken?

[26-Oct-18 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
there is definitely something funny going on, but not 100% reproducible and other bets are happening

[26-Oct-18 10:49 AM] Oszy#5734
And i get this endless flood of hex numbers in the daemon while the bet is on, i wasn't getting that before.

[26-Oct-18 10:50 AM] Oszy#5734
Anyway, I seems like I lost what i had somewhere in between these errors

[26-Oct-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a feeling that maybe when so many bets are happening at once, multiple bets pick the same entropy TX's ?

[26-Oct-18 10:59 AM] jorian#4555
i cant even talk to the daemon containing the dicefund anymore

Found interesting thing. Yesterday, when somebody broadcast 200+ bet txes they exists in mempool, but appears in blocktemplate with a big delay:
```komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getrawmempool | jq length
192
komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getblocktemplate | jq '.transactions | length'
8```
192 txes in mempool, but in blocktemplate only 8 ...
But now, when i'm sent ~1500 normal txes it appears in mempool and blocktemplate immediatily, as a result all 1500 txes included in last 2 blocks:

wow

[26-Oct-18 11:04 AM] Decker#3767
Why bet txes doesn't go to `blocktemplate` immediatily - it's a question.

[26-Oct-18 11:05 AM] Decker#3767
Normal txes - mean not bet, just send funds from one address to another.

I was doing a loop but it hasn't caused a problem before on this script.

I'll resync.

I started 1000 loops of dicebet to fork my node last night

[26-Oct-18 11:20 AM] CrisF#3405
This was only 9 bets into a loop of 100.

@blackjok3r ) and i thought "who is this blockchain spammer? and it was you" ... )

[26-Oct-18 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha yeah... I stopped it this mirning, but my node had not received block for 10H already ... it was not long after I started that it just got stuck.

[26-Oct-18 11:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, your giant balance has probably inspired many people, @Decker !

[26-Oct-18 11:21 AM] Decker#3767
you are right, sending high amount of bet txes in row cause your node to stuck ...

[26-Oct-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes definatly... I'm not 100% sure on this, but maybe its that it cannot process all the EVALs in time, and then sees a block with confrirmed CC TX that it thinks is invalid.

💯 

[26-Oct-18 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
using auto bet scripts is only good to stress the chain out and find bugs

[26-Oct-18 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you just keep betting, you will always lose

[26-Oct-18 11:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Would 10 loops of 10 be better than 1 of 100?

[26-Oct-18 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if trying to win, just bet once

[26-Oct-18 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
knowing when to stop etc, are key as always

`if you just keep betting, you will always lose`
true

[26-Oct-18 11:26 AM] CrisF#3405
I am curious if I could win 50 of 50 bets.  I lost 50 of 50 before.

[26-Oct-18 11:27 AM] Decker#3767
try the following:
1. bet 1 
2. if lose -> bet 2
3. if lose -> bet 4 
...
repeat until win ...

[26-Oct-18 11:28 AM] LocoMB#8593
15x red _IS_ possible -  so you end up betting 2**15 your initial bet

[26-Oct-18 11:29 AM] LocoMB#8593
dunno about casino databses- but should be possible to verify if 15x RED has been seen somewhere

[26-Oct-18 11:30 AM] LocoMB#8593
oki:
 n = 10 it goes down to 0.07%.

Depends on how dodgy the casino and how good the dealer is :trollface:

[26-Oct-18 11:32 AM] LocoMB#8593
hahaha - ouch:
There are no exceptions that the same color appeared more than 20 times in a row in practice. The record was registered in 1943, when red color came up 32 times in a row! The probability of such event in French Roulette is (18/37)32 = 0.000000000096886885 with the corresponding odds 10,321,314,387:1.

TBH, and that is a personal idea / thought, I believe that if it is clearly stated that in case of a chain restart, because atm it is used for testing, if ever the chain get stuck, and it is announced people are "safe" and holding will live even on a new chain just using a snapshot, it would create value and trust on the coin

[26-Oct-18 11:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
would drag more outsiders to take the bet and start investing / playing

[26-Oct-18 11:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So far no funds have been lost other than the funds you lose when you lose a bet :trollface:

[26-Oct-18 11:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah but the fear of a chain restart may stop people from thinking : ok, I know coins won't be wiped out

[26-Oct-18 11:42 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But yeah, we need to make it clear that even of somday the chain need to be forked into a new one, all funds will be airdropped to kmdice holders

[26-Oct-18 11:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
(am not in charge here, just an idea, and a concern as early miner / investor)

[26-Oct-18 11:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
the fact that it is not stated clearly makes me step back and slow down investments on it

[26-Oct-18 11:43 AM] Decker#3767
good idea, but i think people don't start inversting / playing bcz it's still little bit buggy.

[26-Oct-18 11:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
creating value over it may even fidelize GUI devs

[26-Oct-18 11:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
and create an opportunity for em to be sure their work is valuable on actual chain

[26-Oct-18 11:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Definitively. We have always been 100% sure that any restart will make holders accountable.

[26-Oct-18 11:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
that s very nice, makes me feel confident then

[26-Oct-18 11:46 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its an experiment sure. We are at the frontier of utxo chains here. As it has turned out, we are not just testing the dice cc tech but also utxo tech too.

[26-Oct-18 11:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Holding kmdice might even get you airdrops of new game coins, different from kmdice

[26-Oct-18 11:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That would be a nice promo for any new game chain, like casino or whichever other chaim gets created

[26-Oct-18 11:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
thing is if we rewind a little what happened here, PIRATE was announced as a test chain, and when people saw what could be done with it it became serious

[26-Oct-18 11:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
I feel KMDICE can go the same way

[26-Oct-18 11:50 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also although the house doesnt have an edge... nothing stops a gui dev to get an edge from a good gui that people are willimg to use even if they need to pay a small fee per play

[26-Oct-18 11:53 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We did make this chain with the intent for it to be public from start. As in serious... well, its a dice game and we dont have a financial gain from it, its mostly a community chain. So i dont think we will go serious with this as in creating business models and such. That will be in the hands of the community

[26-Oct-18 11:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
