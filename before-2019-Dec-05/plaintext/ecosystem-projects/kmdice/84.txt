But in this case, not being able to see the dealer, I didnt know ... I wonder why that is the case ü§î

[09-Nov-18 12:22 AM] TonyL#3577
My bets should be usual now

[09-Nov-18 12:23 AM] TonyL#3577
But getting on dicestatus
```Diceinit error in finish
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "Diceinit error in finish"
}```

[09-Nov-18 12:25 AM] TonyL#3577
stopped all bets so

[09-Nov-18 12:34 AM] jl777c#5810
diceinit would be from wrong name or funding txid

[09-Nov-18 12:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i saw some dicebet for the other plan and that was confusing things

[09-Nov-18 12:34 AM] jl777c#5810

[09-Nov-18 12:39 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL is that one of your bettxid?

[09-Nov-18 12:39 AM] jl777c#5810
if so it has the wrong plan name or fundingtxid

[09-Nov-18 12:57 AM] TonyL#3577
All my bets were placed on `KMDICE 5be49570c56d036abb08b6d084da93a8a86f58fc48db4a1086be95540d752d6f` betplan

[09-Nov-18 01:00 AM] jl777c#5810
so 55965c202dbd8375bd409cff27f9be2fe0df80c4f31ca07151f15e5416ec7943 is not yours?

[09-Nov-18 01:00 AM] jl777c#5810
must be someone else then

[09-Nov-18 01:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Just doublechecked - it's not mine @jl777c

[09-Nov-18 01:14 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm not so KMDICE whale - dont have more than 100 on any of my nodes üòÉ

[09-Nov-18 01:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Btw just tried to bet - still getting:
```Diceinit error in finish
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "Diceinit error in finish"
}
```

[09-Nov-18 01:17 AM] jl777c#5810
all dicebet gives that?

[09-Nov-18 01:19 AM] TonyL#3577
I guess it's just stopped to get dicestatus immediately

[09-Nov-18 01:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Just tried to do bet and check status manually and it's worked fine

[09-Nov-18 01:19 AM] TonyL#3577
But via script status not getting now, so problem should be on script side

[09-Nov-18 01:20 AM] jl777c#5810
try the latest

[09-Nov-18 01:21 AM] TonyL#3577
```notmine.0 or not CC.1``` what this printout means?

[09-Nov-18 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810

So it's even less than a second sometimes

[09-Nov-18 01:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i am quite pleased with the performance

[09-Nov-18 01:25 AM] jl777c#5810
and now it is running stable, no deadlocks no crashes for an hour

[09-Nov-18 01:25 AM] TonyL#3577
I'll try now to play from 3 nodes

[09-Nov-18 01:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Just have to update

[09-Nov-18 01:25 AM] jl777c#5810
all the various edge cases seem to be handled, at least it is completing all bets and having just a dozen or so pending, waiting on confirmation

[09-Nov-18 01:26 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe 3 nodes will crash it

[09-Nov-18 01:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Done, run gambling on 3 nodes

[09-Nov-18 01:33 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r you might want to study how I sped up the dealer node 1000x, dicefinish() is a dedicated thread and actually not that complex considering what it does

it was looking a bit bleak for a while, but I finally managed to get it stabilized

[09-Nov-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Great work

[09-Nov-18 01:34 AM] jl777c#5810
the dicestatus loop uses the same DiceQueue that the realtime validation does

[09-Nov-18 01:34 AM] jl777c#5810
mutexes to protect data structure

[09-Nov-18 01:35 AM] jl777c#5810
queueing and I will change the linear search with hashing tomorrow, but everything is all in nice little functions already

[09-Nov-18 01:35 AM] jl777c#5810
so dice CC can now be a model for high performance mempool processing for games or any challenge response

[09-Nov-18 01:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the 51% secret reveal attack vector is also defended against, just need to actually validate the refund tx

Are things stable now with 3 nodes?

[09-Nov-18 01:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i am not seeing any problems on the dealer node

[09-Nov-18 01:37 AM] jl777c#5810
things still seem to be instant response

[09-Nov-18 01:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Great

[09-Nov-18 01:38 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Were there any changes in RNG model ?

[09-Nov-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will have a play with it myself too, and do some reading of the code.

[09-Nov-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have something else I want to finish first, that I was stuck on last night.

[09-Nov-18 01:38 AM] TonyL#3577
If so I can re-check RNG fairness

[09-Nov-18 01:39 AM] jl777c#5810
I disabled 1:1 odds for RPC, but we should really validate the fairness. i didnt change the RNG, but maybe something in the system changes

[09-Nov-18 01:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh it's not a big deal that there is no 1:1 since we have all others üòÉ

[09-Nov-18 01:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Will re-check it tomorrow

[09-Nov-18 01:42 AM] TonyL#3577
Now such test will be much much more faster than before because it's possible to place much more bets/minute

[09-Nov-18 01:42 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, maybe 5 million bets can be made in a day

still not sure if more than 1000 bets per minute can be sustained

[09-Nov-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats a pretty incredible rate for a single node ot handle

[09-Nov-18 01:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Will one block size fit 1000 bets?

[09-Nov-18 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810

[09-Nov-18 01:45 AM] jl777c#5810
2 tx per bet

[09-Nov-18 01:45 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm not totally sure how many I'm placing now in single block

[09-Nov-18 01:45 AM] TonyL#3577
But should be around few hundred

[09-Nov-18 01:46 AM] jl777c#5810
6500 tx possible if to extrapolate that one

[09-Nov-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not easy to place a full block, with the utxo selection.. Even if your node has 5000 utxo to choose from, it wills till choose the smae ones somehow if you bet too fast

[09-Nov-18 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe something like dicefinish is needed. i allocate utxo for all the pending bets at once

[09-Nov-18 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so one iteration through the utxos and all pending bets have their utxo

[09-Nov-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh who is going to be betting that many at once ... its mostly for testing the limits that we need it .. Normally a single node would be betting only 1-2 at a time.

[09-Nov-18 01:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe not dice but some other CC

[09-Nov-18 01:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a slots

[09-Nov-18 01:48 AM] TonyL#3577
In slots you may do like 50-60 spins for a minute

[09-Nov-18 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
only the wins need to do the normal utxo scan, but at 1:2 odds, it is only one third the tx. I didnt bother batch selecting the dicewin utxo as it seems faster now than a dozen test nodes can blast

[09-Nov-18 01:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm just had an idea (not connected to dice) - make a chess game based on oraclesCC. Each game is a oracle, 2 players are publishers publish moves one by one - after game can check moves from it.  Will it be a good demonstration?

[09-Nov-18 01:54 AM] jl777c#5810
a dapp could validate the moves

[09-Nov-18 01:54 AM] jl777c#5810
when we get the bet CC, people can play for money

[09-Nov-18 01:55 AM] TonyL#3577
There are physical chess boards which broadcast moves

had to take the dealer node offline for a few minutes. had a 200 bet backlog, which it cleared in a few seconds

[09-Nov-18 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it not only seems to keep up in realtime with plenty to spare, but i think i can catch up thousands of bets per block if ever it is offline for some time

[09-Nov-18 02:18 AM] jl777c#5810
and best of all, it appears to be processing every last dicebet. no edge cases that confuse it anymore

[09-Nov-18 02:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181

fixed a deadlock (maybe more exists under high load)
added basic refund validation
automatically creates 0.0002 utxos for the parallel txconstruction and also creates 0.023 utxo that are needed to fund the sendmany 0.0002
reduced CPU usage now it ranges from 1% to 20% maybe under stress test it will go up

[09-Nov-18 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
all that seems left is to fix whatever bugs a massive stress test finds, oh, and changing the silly linear searches to hashtables, that will make it go even faster

txdecode fail is when your dicebet conflicts with another nodes

just finishing up what I have been working on and will run some tests on this and get to reaading the code.
