yes, before knowing the fact it's vulnerable contract.

[21-Oct-18 07:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
even before any of that conversation

[21-Oct-18 07:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you forgot to tell that part ?

[21-Oct-18 07:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
at that point there was not even a price floor for this coin.

[21-Oct-18 07:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@siu - Chainmakers any other point left you want to say that I am a fool?

[21-Oct-18 07:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no, no

[21-Oct-18 07:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you are an early adopter

[21-Oct-18 07:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the vulnerability part is still theoretical... not yet achieved in practive.

[21-Oct-18 07:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
would be nice for people to really try though

[21-Oct-18 07:37 PM] SHossain#0007
Yes @grewalsatinder, you are an early adopter. sell them at 0.15 and that will be double profit for you :abusedsmily:

[21-Oct-18 07:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain give me your kmdice address please.

[21-Oct-18 07:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not sure why you would be pissed at kmdice mate? 🤔

[21-Oct-18 07:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not sure what is the reason to giving them back

[21-Oct-18 07:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
simple. I sometimes don't get jokes.
you might have joked. I did not like it.
I felt it. I gave those tokens back. I did no valued it anyway.

[21-Oct-18 07:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i didnt make fun of you

[21-Oct-18 07:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i actually narrated what you did

[21-Oct-18 07:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you asked for price and then complained about it being to high

[21-Oct-18 07:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that is what people that are bargaining do

[21-Oct-18 07:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i actually thought you were looking to buy lower... thats it.

[21-Oct-18 07:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
anyway... i have no financial gain at all from KMDICE

[21-Oct-18 07:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
would have been nice for you to help on getting some gui models and stuff... but whatever.

[21-Oct-18 07:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[21-Oct-18 07:56 PM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers if there is a community or marketing funds, let me know the address. i'll send those coins there. i won't resell them to anyone as they already been sold once and Satinder didn't take back the KMD

[21-Oct-18 07:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[21-Oct-18 07:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
`also, there is #safespace if you feel uncomfortable`

[21-Oct-18 08:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[21-Oct-18 08:03 PM] Alright#0419

[21-Oct-18 08:03 PM] SHossain#0007
that is a multisig address

[21-Oct-18 08:03 PM] SHossain#0007
chainmakers has access to that

[21-Oct-18 08:03 PM] Alright#0419
Doesn't need to be a special vout to send to multisig?

[21-Oct-18 08:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no

[21-Oct-18 08:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[21-Oct-18 08:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no, no one has set an mm

[21-Oct-18 08:06 PM] Alright#0419
should focus on bdex usage instead of OTC

[21-Oct-18 08:06 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll setup some orders once i become free of my current testing schedules @Alright

[21-Oct-18 08:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

I did not say anything to you @siu - Chainmakers

[21-Oct-18 08:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[21-Oct-18 08:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no, i got upset cuz you gave me the finger and did a drama out of nothing.

[21-Oct-18 08:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but its ok... im cool

[21-Oct-18 08:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if I don't like your comments and I tell you that I didn't. that's why you get upset back?

[21-Oct-18 08:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I told you that wasn't intended.

[21-Oct-18 08:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you want to take it that way.

[21-Oct-18 08:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
dude, you surely got upset and intended the finger.

[21-Oct-18 08:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[21-Oct-18 08:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[21-Oct-18 08:10 PM] Llama#1330
I feel like the nethash is wrong...

[21-Oct-18 08:10 PM] Llama#1330
It says 2.

[21-Oct-18 08:10 PM] SHossain#0007
2.25

[21-Oct-18 08:10 PM] Llama#1330
Mining reward is 36k daily

[21-Oct-18 08:10 PM] Llama#1330
Right?

[21-Oct-18 08:11 PM] SHossain#0007
2.25 is what i see on a pool

[21-Oct-18 08:11 PM] Alright#0419
yes, @Llama

[21-Oct-18 08:11 PM] Alright#0419
have to consider that more coins could be emitted based on luck though

[21-Oct-18 08:11 PM] Alright#0419
as half the supply is in that dice plan

[21-Oct-18 08:12 PM] Alright#0419
more coins could also be locked though, so....

[21-Oct-18 08:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there is a halving every 210k blocks.

[21-Oct-18 08:13 PM] Llama#1330
So that person mined for 4 hours at 1 msol and only got 160 ish

[21-Oct-18 08:13 PM] Llama#1330
Shouldn’t they have gotten 6k?

[21-Oct-18 08:13 PM] Alright#0419
no?

[21-Oct-18 08:13 PM] Alright#0419
were they 100% of the hashrate?

[21-Oct-18 08:14 PM] Llama#1330
50%

[21-Oct-18 08:14 PM] Llama#1330
3k*

[21-Oct-18 08:14 PM] Alright#0419
who is this person?

[21-Oct-18 08:14 PM] Llama#1330
Me lol

[21-Oct-18 08:14 PM] Alright#0419
is your diff set properly on pool

[21-Oct-18 08:15 PM] Alright#0419
you might have port diff set significantly higher than network diff

[21-Oct-18 08:15 PM] Alright#0419
which would make you find a lot less blocks

[21-Oct-18 08:16 PM] Llama#1330
I set it to whatever it said to put it at

[21-Oct-18 08:16 PM] Alright#0419
what said?
