blame it on late night chainmaking

[19-Oct-18 06:10 PM] SHossain#0007
so, KMDICE not broken?

[19-Oct-18 06:11 PM] jorian#4555
KMDICE undedded

[19-Oct-18 06:11 PM] jorian#4555
please point your miners again

[19-Oct-18 06:11 PM] SHossain#0007
i never stopped mining 😂

[19-Oct-18 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if you have only 7  utxo, you can only have 7 bets pending

[19-Oct-18 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are not finishing the bets, they wont be finished

[19-Oct-18 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
until the timeout

[19-Oct-18 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
in this case 10 hours

[19-Oct-18 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
...

[19-Oct-18 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
please do not be saying the chain is dead when it is being misused. it is like flying an airplane into the lake and saying it doesnt fly very well

[19-Oct-18 06:12 PM] jorian#4555
```{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "no pending bets"
}
```

[19-Oct-18 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
also, the chain should have continue to be generating blocks the entire time

[19-Oct-18 06:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
obviouslt lost 10 at 1500 odds 😂

[19-Oct-18 06:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
thinking if I should mine kmdice too 🤔

[19-Oct-18 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
the isolation of utxo based CC means that at worst, the utxo in play are lost/burned

[19-Oct-18 06:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
speculative mining

[19-Oct-18 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
is there a mining pool?

[19-Oct-18 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dice works on all AC ... this is a good chain to test but I cant see its speculative value... #justsayin

[19-Oct-18 06:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
none I know

[19-Oct-18 06:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

@blackjok3r any chance you will setup a real pool? let me know, i wont setup one then

[19-Oct-18 06:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seriously tho ... if anyone wants to mine that pool .. I cna try to set payment up if someone gives me pool_configs/KMDICE/json

[19-Oct-18 06:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jorian @siu - Chainmakers you oue mining for @blackjok3r now :trollface:

[19-Oct-18 06:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
never use payment processor

[19-Oct-18 06:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my Knomp is level with webworkers  bfore pirate added

[19-Oct-18 06:20 PM] 0x03#8822
....do i setup a pool or not?

[19-Oct-18 06:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can do if you tell me how to enable payment processor

[19-Oct-18 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so anybody know why it is bad to allow anybody to create entropy tx?

[19-Oct-18 06:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@0x03 setup pool

[19-Oct-18 06:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
liek the dealer can

[19-Oct-18 06:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
2 pools is beter but plse tell me @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 @webworker01  or 03 what to change to anable payemtns?

[19-Oct-18 06:22 PM] 0x03#8822
wait until my pools done

[19-Oct-18 06:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a stratum ming every single AC is a apublic one ... but its all set to my address

[19-Oct-18 06:22 PM] 0x03#8822
i'll just send over my config files then

[19-Oct-18 06:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks

[19-Oct-18 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it allows cheating unless neither side knows both entropy

[19-Oct-18 06:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can change to public ... but the 0.001 reward wouldtake a while to payout ... I ave z_mergetoaddress and wallet reset script to handle them

[19-Oct-18 06:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if people so desire to mine them

[19-Oct-18 06:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can make it so ..

[19-Oct-18 06:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just need to update the template

[19-Oct-18 06:24 PM] 0x03#8822
meh. so an unmodified pool won't work for payouts

[19-Oct-18 06:24 PM] 0x03#8822
fek

[19-Oct-18 06:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with template update .. its litteayl 10 mins to convert to public pool

[19-Oct-18 06:24 PM] 0x03#8822
y so little reward?

[19-Oct-18 06:25 PM] jorian#4555
