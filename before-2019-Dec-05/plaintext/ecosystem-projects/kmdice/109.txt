so i stopped to play

[06-Nov-19 07:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe because you were as vague then as you are now?

[06-Nov-19 07:00 PM] ciumete#3212
i was not vague i provided the tx

[06-Nov-19 07:00 PM] ciumete#3212
i will search the log to reproduce

[06-Nov-19 07:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
good, because without details and logs, there's nothing anyone can do (including understand what the "bug" actually is/does)

[06-Nov-19 07:02 PM] ciumete#3212
ciumete06/04/2019
about 450 but not this is the problem, if is a bug must be fixed
i bet 100 bets in a loop with amounts between 0.001 and 0.13 and odds between 2 and 1500

[06-Nov-19 07:02 PM] ciumete#3212
so the balance dropped at that time with 450 KMDICE

[06-Nov-19 07:02 PM] ciumete#3212
in that conditions

[06-Nov-19 07:03 PM] ciumete#3212
so it wwas imposible

[06-Nov-19 07:03 PM] ciumete#3212
450 kmdice lower balance with 100 bets with amounts between 0.001 and 0.13 and odds between 2 and 1500

[06-Nov-19 07:05 PM] ciumete#3212
ciumete06/04/2019
o observed in 2 hours the balance drop down from 960 to 506 kmdice
i bet only between 0.001 to 0.13
so is imposible in 2 hours to bet 460 kmdice
a bet durring about 5 secs
i loked in the explorer and i see that strange transaction !

TX  5e38a057c75dc4a9c36b54ee2071a79f226664065fc372fd473f867096f79281
kmdice address REDht3gAK9eSVZgE1nBkR8jyNeJ31ZtcRd

[06-Nov-19 07:08 PM] ciumete#3212
so, if u calculate 5 sec/bet , 2h that means about 1440 bets with amounts between 0.001 and 0.13 so can't bet about 450 kmdice !!!

[06-Nov-19 07:09 PM] ciumete#3212
investigate that TX...

[06-Nov-19 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and what script did you use for this loop?

[06-Nov-19 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and what client did you run?

[06-Nov-19 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and who built the client?

[06-Nov-19 07:09 PM] ciumete#3212
a script made by me on windows

[06-Nov-19 07:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and the contents of the script are.....

[06-Nov-19 07:10 PM] ciumete#3212
based on the windows commands with komodo-cli

[06-Nov-19 07:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"contents" = I can't see what is on your PC, so you will have to share your code

[06-Nov-19 07:13 PM] ciumete#3212
u suspect my script when this issue i talk about with jl777 jorian, etc and in that poin they see is something went wrong, and now u find the dealer node was drined the funds !!!?!?

[06-Nov-19 07:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as someone who has written over 20k personal scripts, I find it impossible to operate on the assumption that any script (even my own) is 100% free from errors just because the author assumes it is

[06-Nov-19 07:16 PM] ciumete#3212
i telled u a logical reasons , i gived u the suspect TX , i played about 6 months and i monitored all bets

[06-Nov-19 07:18 PM] ciumete#3212
if u don't trust about what i tell, or u think is not logical, u can investigate why the dealer node drained the balance, i think is same reason why my balance was drined...

[06-Nov-19 07:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`u can investigate why the dealer node drained the balance,`
because you formatted the tx to do so?
because you bet 71.67930937 KMDICE through a bad script call?
because your script doesn't round the way you assumed it would?
and 100 other reasons that might be on your end before it even got to the daemon...

none of which anyone can know without seeing the source of the script

[06-Nov-19 07:24 PM] ciumete#3212
in that time i buld many time FSM branch

[06-Nov-19 07:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if u don't trust about what i tell, or u think is not logical`
through years of experience, I'm saying that just because one believes a script is error free doesn't mean that it is (I've feked up more than my share)

[06-Nov-19 07:27 PM] ciumete#3212
ok, my script is bad, forget about my problem, why the dealer have so low balance ?!

[06-Nov-19 07:28 PM] ciumete#3212
don't tell it was so much big winners !

[06-Nov-19 07:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because it took all the funds it stole from you, multiplied them by 50000x and gave them to someone else?

[06-Nov-19 07:31 PM] ciumete#3212
lol, very funny

[06-Nov-19 07:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
see, I can be silly too 😛

[06-Nov-19 07:31 PM] ciumete#3212
i was not silly, i was curious if u find why the dealer have so low balance

[06-Nov-19 07:31 PM] Alright#0419
@ciumete just reindex your node

[06-Nov-19 07:31 PM] ciumete#3212
so u don't know
