there are no KMDICE wallet? or use komodo wallet?

[22-Oct-18 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
GUI wallet on the works. currently only usable via CLI

[22-Oct-18 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
@Yellowstone if you are an windows user, please read few pages up to start with the CLI. ask any questions to @Llama to get help

[22-Oct-18 11:05 AM] Yellowstone#1138
ok get it!

Wasn't KMDICE first up on the 18th?

[22-Oct-18 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
about 7382 minutes ago

[22-Oct-18 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
18th sounds right

[22-Oct-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
now there is a solution for the 51%, that is the same as PIRATE getting the dPoW

[22-Oct-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
though the 51% fix isnt live yet, there is a path to a solution and it should arrive before fancy GUI

house is still 1000 ahead

[22-Oct-18 12:06 PM] jorian#4555
i just funded house with 900 entropy txns

[22-Oct-18 12:07 PM] jorian#4555
do we want moar?

[22-Oct-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as there are more entropy tx than bets per block, it is enough

[22-Oct-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
900 might be too much...

[22-Oct-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but better than too few

[22-Oct-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
just might get a bit slow

[22-Oct-18 12:07 PM] jorian#4555
better safe than sorry

[22-Oct-18 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
yes and with solution for 51% defined, it is not long before it will be safe for bigger bets

[22-Oct-18 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
and hashrate more than VOT, CMM, HUSH, BTCP

[22-Oct-18 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
not bad for the fifth day!

[22-Oct-18 12:12 PM] jorian#4555
cool!

[22-Oct-18 12:12 PM] jorian#4555
i guess KMDICE needs to airdrop then?

[22-Oct-18 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure where the supply will come from... i guess you can always entropy grind and extract from the locked funds

@forkwitch is there a limit to mempool tx that the pool can handle? blocks are not being mined anymore

my pool has no visible errors but its hash rate has fallen a lot, ad likely cant find any at this difficulty

[22-Oct-18 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
over 460 tx im mempool

[22-Oct-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
could it just be diff stranded?

[22-Oct-18 01:04 PM] jorian#4555
460 tx that's me

[22-Oct-18 01:04 PM] jorian#4555
I used a timer

[22-Oct-18 01:04 PM] jorian#4555
Not long enough apparently

@jl777c  My pool is reporting `invalid solution` to shares

[22-Oct-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
seems a pool bug

[22-Oct-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if all pools have the same bug...

[22-Oct-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I had a feeling sometimes CC TX were being rejected by pools ...

[22-Oct-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but couldnt really work it out

[22-Oct-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it looks like it is not solving equihash properly

[22-Oct-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wonder which TX it is ? or if just because full block of them or something ... maybe it just the miner sending them to me... I am not mining any more.

[22-Oct-18 01:10 PM] jorian#4555
So I'm the first to flood a chain solely mined by nomp pools?

[22-Oct-18 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure. maybe the CC confuses it but really it looks like a normal tx

[22-Oct-18 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think forkwitches is znomp and mine is Knomp .. os they are not the same.

[22-Oct-18 01:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Chainbreakers is not a misunderstatement :trollface:

[22-Oct-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I ried to restart my pool ..and it didnt work ... it stopped printing to console and I cant stop it in the back ground 😂

[22-Oct-18 01:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Shit

[22-Oct-18 01:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 we might need help here.

[22-Oct-18 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I got it restarted ut my hash is very low now most people rentals ran out or they chainged pools.

[22-Oct-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe the hash rate is just too low atm ... its always a possibility the invalid solution errors have heppened in the past also.

[22-Oct-18 01:22 PM] SHossain#0007
This kind of stuck can happen when a chain been hit with too much hash for a short time and if you take away the hash (seen that behaviour on smaller hash chains)

[22-Oct-18 01:23 PM] SHossain#0007
in that case, it may take few hours before the next block is mined

[22-Oct-18 01:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I guess diff needs to adjust

[22-Oct-18 01:23 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[22-Oct-18 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
wont adjust without blocks

to speak in CG's terms: chain is feked

[22-Oct-18 01:26 PM] jorian#4555
can the pools handle large blocks?

[22-Oct-18 01:26 PM] jorian#4555
AC is 2MB right?

[22-Oct-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, we have mined big blocks before this makes no sense

[22-Oct-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
we need @Decker

[22-Oct-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes

[22-Oct-18 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can mine full blocks just fine ... the onyl error I saw was invalid solution from a miner ... but its not on every solution submitted so seems unrelated
