OTC should be moved outside of the pirate sub if it is expanding beyond just pirate trades

[23-Oct-18 01:05 AM] Llama#1330
idk if otc is a good thing to have long-term

[23-Oct-18 01:05 AM] Llama#1330
it will attract scammers and such

[23-Oct-18 01:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`OTC should be moved outside of the pirate sub if it is expanding beyond just pirate trades`
If only there were some channel called something like #talk-trading ..... 🤔

[23-Oct-18 01:08 AM] bishop#9773
so then I guess we can get rid of OTC then :eyeroll:

[23-Oct-18 01:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
#deleted-channel is a sub of PIRATE because it's a PIRATE channel, just like #deleted-channel or #deleted-channel

[23-Oct-18 01:09 AM] bishop#9773
and how does that change anything I said initially

[23-Oct-18 01:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the fact that what you said initially ignores that #talk-trading exists

[23-Oct-18 01:10 AM] bishop#9773
then otc is redundant

[23-Oct-18 01:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no

[23-Oct-18 01:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
#deleted-channel is PIRATE specific

[23-Oct-18 01:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what you're saying is like:
A Ford dealership parts department shouldn't exist because O'Riley's sells Ford parts

[23-Oct-18 01:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
#deleted-channel is PIRATE specific, #talk-trading is not

[23-Oct-18 01:13 AM] bishop#9773
it makes more sense to consolidate into one channel

[23-Oct-18 01:15 AM] bishop#9773
exactly....

[23-Oct-18 01:16 AM] bishop#9773
so broad otc trades should be consolidating in their own otc-related channel to leave the market and day trading discussion to the trading channel

[23-Oct-18 01:16 AM] bishop#9773
and since otc only exists in pirate, it makes more sense to bring it out of pirate if it is expanding beyond pirate pairs

[23-Oct-18 01:18 AM] bishop#9773
which part of bringing it out of pirate don't you comprehend?

[23-Oct-18 01:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the part where you don't bring a part of a project outside of that project

[23-Oct-18 01:19 AM] bishop#9773
if, and the keyword being if, it expands beyond pirate pairs

[23-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Llama#1330
