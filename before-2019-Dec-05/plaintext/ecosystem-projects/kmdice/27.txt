solving this via ad hoc methods, is unlikely

[22-Oct-18 08:23 PM] Alright#0419
yes, seems very hard to do

[22-Oct-18 08:23 PM] Alright#0419
pangea whitepaper was *way* over my head

[22-Oct-18 08:23 PM] Alright#0419
I think using some arbitrary data feed that no one can likely influence would be a good solution

[22-Oct-18 08:24 PM] Alright#0419
say hash of all tweets that happened in the last minute

[22-Oct-18 08:24 PM] Alright#0419
that kind of thing

[22-Oct-18 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
what if entropy txs required multisig between many parties?

[22-Oct-18 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
could a single signer influence the entropy if it were set up like that?

[22-Oct-18 08:50 PM] jorian#4555
gonna need testers soon

[22-Oct-18 08:50 PM] Alright#0419
for example, could a single notary influence the txid of a notarization tx?

[22-Oct-18 08:50 PM] Alright#0419
if answer is no, that's a good source of entropy

I'm way too lazy to load that mess up

[22-Oct-18 09:17 PM] Alright#0419
should push users towards bdex instead of OTC

[22-Oct-18 09:18 PM] Alright#0419
no technical limitations on doing so

[22-Oct-18 09:18 PM] Alright#0419
as there was with pirate

[22-Oct-18 09:18 PM] Flexatron#8809

we should wait a week or two before advertising a bit... not for personal gain or anything of that sort...

how to add kmdice

[22-Oct-18 09:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`should push users towards bdex instead of OTC`
*after* you fix it so that coins can be altered **before** logging in

[22-Oct-18 09:21 PM] Flexatron#8809
I use barterdex v0.8.8rc

[22-Oct-18 09:21 PM] jorian#4555
`after you fix it so that coins can be altered before logging in` still not fixed?

[22-Oct-18 09:22 PM] jorian#4555
i thought you were doing some GUI work before your 'vacation' :trollface:

protip: learn the mm cli

[22-Oct-18 09:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by whom? we pretty much all left it waiting on mm 2

[22-Oct-18 09:22 PM] Alright#0419
although bdex GUI is great once you understand how it's actually interacting with the mm

[22-Oct-18 09:22 PM] Alright#0419
not so great if you're just pressing buttons hoping they'll do something

[22-Oct-18 09:22 PM] SHossain#0007
@Flexatron that is a very old version of GUI

[22-Oct-18 09:22 PM] Flexatron#8809
yea downloading now

[22-Oct-18 09:23 PM] jorian#4555
@siu - Chainmakers did you add KMDICE to barterdex?

[22-Oct-18 09:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i thought you were doing some GUI work before your 'vacation' `
tbh, I'm not sure I did anything this *year* on it

[22-Oct-18 09:23 PM] Alright#0419
do you guys want a listing on safe.trade?

what is safe.trade

[22-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Alright#0419
SAFE's CEX

[22-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Llama#1330
doesn't sound very safe

[22-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Alright#0419
I know that isn't exactly a great listing, but could be used *for now*

`doesn't sound very safe`
Imagine Komodo screwed in every way you can think of and you have 'SAFE'coin

[22-Oct-18 09:25 PM] Llama#1330
sounds fun

[22-Oct-18 09:25 PM] jorian#4555
they don't even trade KMD

[22-Oct-18 09:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and they never will 😛

[22-Oct-18 09:25 PM] Alright#0419
could get a btc pair

[22-Oct-18 09:26 PM] Alright#0419
could probably talk my way into a KMD/KMDICE pair 🤷

[22-Oct-18 09:26 PM] Alright#0419
just throwing it out there, have a bunch of SAFE that I don't know what to do with

[22-Oct-18 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
could start getting tons of coins listed on their CEX with it

[22-Oct-18 09:28 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 it's more like "imagine a couple web devs that didn't understand BTC, ZEC or KMD at all made a fork of KMD"

[22-Oct-18 09:29 PM] Alright#0419
then their community was conditioned to hassle people asking technical questions

[22-Oct-18 09:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`just throwing it out there, have a bunch of SAFE that I don't know what to do with`
You and everyone else; it sucks so bad that kev (their utube guy)sold 3 of his rigs and now only has 1 😂

[22-Oct-18 09:34 PM] Alright#0419
haven't paid attention to the project in months

[22-Oct-18 09:34 PM] Alright#0419
occasionally check in on it, but progress is rarely made other than on their CEX

[22-Oct-18 09:35 PM] Alright#0419
it's a "community coin", but it's only "unique"(not unique) feature is a for-profit CEX

[22-Oct-18 09:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I watch his vids when I'm bored and keep a running count of how many times he says "uhhh" and "ehhhm"; thinking about turning it into a drinking game to see if anyone in the world can stay sober if they do a shot each time he says one

[22-Oct-18 09:36 PM] Llama#1330
what's your count at?

[22-Oct-18 09:36 PM] Llama#1330
lol

[22-Oct-18 09:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
usually ~ 30-100 each per vid 😛

[22-Oct-18 09:49 PM] SHossain#0007

[22-Oct-18 09:52 PM] Alright#0419
you have to understand what size UTXOs you need

[22-Oct-18 09:52 PM] Flexatron#8809
for a buy order as well?

[22-Oct-18 09:52 PM] Flexatron#8809
will try something

[22-Oct-18 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
for alice side(buyer), you need UTXOs in ratio of 1(+txfee) and >1/777(+txfee)
