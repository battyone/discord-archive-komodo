[10-Nov-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
why make the dealer hande thousands of simultaneous bets

[10-Nov-18 03:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We need to be able to let those people play with granma friendly gui

welll tbh ... the chain will be so large soon no grandma will be able to sync it on her smartphone :trollface:

[10-Nov-18 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, so I'm saying that pool(s) still aren't patched for the 128-256 tx bug

[10-Nov-18 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Height     Age     Transactions     Mined by     Size

[10-Nov-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
make more bets ? every block must have more than 256 bets in it 😄

[10-Nov-18 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you sure of that?

[10-Nov-18 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its a daemon issue not the pool as such

what was said and what reality seems to indicate...

[10-Nov-18 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the pool can try and make a block with that range of tx but the daemon will reject it

[10-Nov-18 03:24 PM] Alright#0419
surprised no one has done it on zcash yet

[10-Nov-18 03:25 PM] Alright#0419

[10-Nov-18 03:26 PM] Decker#3767
if it's needed for tests - i can launch a pool and rent nicehash for ~7 hours ...

[10-Nov-18 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright I'm too cowardly, do it and let me know results

[10-Nov-18 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
in some places, bitcoin requires optimal varint encoding

[10-Nov-18 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you use 2 bytes for 129 to 255, it could be rejecting it, even though it is valid varint, it isnt optimal

[10-Nov-18 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
the code fix for the pools that i saw used non-optimal varint

about to test some fixes that might break the chain.. trying to properly fix the entropy reused detection

[10-Nov-18 03:30 PM] Decker#3767
with this:
```        /* https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#Variable_length_integer */
        if (this.txCount < 0xfd){
            var varInt = new Buffer(txCount, 'hex');
        }
        else if (this.txCount <= 0xffff){
            var varInt = new Buffer.concat([Buffer('FD', 'hex'), util.reverseBuffer(new Buffer(txCount, 'hex'))]);
        }```
i mined 180 tx in block without any issues ... and it's not rejected ...

I'm still thinking that there's other parts of znomp that contribute to the issue (given that I didn't always experience same thing with 'aayanl/equihash-solomining' derivitive pool)

[10-Nov-18 03:39 PM] Alright#0419
@forkwitch can you verify you have decker's above code?

Hyper-V in win10 isntall ubuntu 16.04

[10-Nov-18 04:32 PM] jorian#4555
@Decker might help you with a windows build

[10-Nov-18 04:32 PM] Decker#3767

in 15mins you can have hyper v with ubuntu 🤷

yep ... wsl in win10 is easy to use ...

btw, does anyone know if a build of KMD for raspberry pi exist?

[10-Nov-18 04:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not PI doesnt have enough ram

[10-Nov-18 04:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ah

ther is a build for arm64 though @radix42  wsa working on that

also, i was able to build mm in raspberry pi some months ago, now it doesnt build.

i just found my pi collecting dust and im looking to use it for something, dont know what :/

@siu - Chainmakers offline signing?

[10-Nov-18 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
There's a project that uses 2 raspi 2s, one online for broadcasting txs, one offline for signing

[10-Nov-18 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
connected via io pins

[10-Nov-18 04:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but if i cant get kmd to run there....

[10-Nov-18 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
you don't need daemon to sign things

[10-Nov-18 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
nor for broadcasting txs

[10-Nov-18 04:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[10-Nov-18 04:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but anything else?

[10-Nov-18 04:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
any other idea?

[10-Nov-18 04:55 PM] Alright#0419
you can at least make it build, sign and broadcast txs

[10-Nov-18 04:55 PM] Alright#0419
don't need a daemon to do that

[10-Nov-18 04:55 PM] Alright#0419
can use insight api for necessary info to build the txs

[10-Nov-18 04:55 PM] Alright#0419
plenty of libraries for signing

[10-Nov-18 04:56 PM] Alright#0419
and insight api for broadcasting

[10-Nov-18 04:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i was thinking on getting mm build there to use it as electrum wallet.

[10-Nov-18 04:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but that either works now 😦

[10-Nov-18 04:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i could do the signing thing to move chainmakers funds

[10-Nov-18 05:08 PM] 0x03#8822
ok so whats the issue with 300tx that stopped the chain before? is there anything i can update?

[10-Nov-18 05:09 PM] 0x03#8822
other than that i see my pool finding blocks and paying out to miners

[10-Nov-18 05:09 PM] 0x03#8822
although there now seems to be another working pool again by the look of things
