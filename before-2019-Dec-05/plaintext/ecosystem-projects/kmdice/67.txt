or the tx will never leave your node

[01-Nov-18 05:04 PM] Decker#3767
seems something wrong happened with KMDICE ... my latest bet tx f518c162834bee5b3a7466333ba7893896d68a939ddea2ec698c2acd04d67d95 , right after send result was:
```"result": "success",
"status": "win",
"won": 3000```
and i saw these 3000 in unconfirmed balance ... but after some blocks these 3000 it's just disappeared from `unconfirmed_balance` and now `dicestatus` on this tx returns `couldnt find bettx or spenttx %s\n` )

may be it comes to me when 69 txes from mempool will included in block ... but anyway looks bad ... you have 3000 KMDICE and after some time haven't ))

[01-Nov-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it got orphaned

[01-Nov-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
just as often losses will be orphaned as it is a random process

[01-Nov-18 05:07 PM] Decker#3767
he-he ... then i'm super lucky ... just lose ~8000 in orphaned )

[01-Nov-18 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
with KMDICE whether your dicebet gets orphaned is also a gamble

[01-Nov-18 05:11 PM] Decker#3767
yeah ... i think bet tx with "lose" can be orphaned same way and funds will return ...

[01-Nov-18 05:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Instead of it forking now the bet you sent is orphaned

[01-Nov-18 05:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What my script does...

[01-Nov-18 05:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is after sending bet.... resends raw transaction every 2s

[01-Nov-18 05:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
until its confirmed

[01-Nov-18 05:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if it stops being able to be sent, it makes a new bet

[01-Nov-18 05:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I ahve 3 nodes doing crazy amounts of bets atm

[01-Nov-18 05:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
100 paralell loops of 20 each ..

[01-Nov-18 05:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on each node

[01-Nov-18 05:16 PM] Decker#3767
seems good stress-test ...

[01-Nov-18 05:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
needs to be done, the first time I did this, it just broke  isntantly

[01-Nov-18 05:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this time one node has almost no errors

[01-Nov-18 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It started with 1000 utxo ... and I added loop on utxo selection in CCtx.cpp so that it skips 90% of utxo,

[01-Nov-18 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because noramlly if you bet to fast, each bet will pick the same utxos and it will fail to send

[01-Nov-18 05:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Do notice after a wile though the daemon gets very bogged down and slow...

[01-Nov-18 05:23 PM] cipi#4502
FSM branch does not compile on the electrums
```rpccrosschain.cpp: In function ‘UniValue crosschainproof(const UniValue&, bool)’:
rpccrosschain.cpp:54:1: error: no return statement in function returning non-void [-Werror=return-type]```
and some others errors of the same type from other files
i have gcc-8 on the electrums...
will stop KMDICE there

[01-Nov-18 05:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@dukeleto  Any idea on this one?

[01-Nov-18 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix

[01-Nov-18 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
at least it seems it is a stub, not sure if code got removed but it was empty

[01-Nov-18 05:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So kmdice can hold some pressure now?

[01-Nov-18 05:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems to be handling it pretty well

[01-Nov-18 05:29 PM] jorian#4555
don't lure blackjok3r

[01-Nov-18 05:30 PM] jorian#4555
oh...

[01-Nov-18 05:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But te dealer wil get backed up soon if its not already

[01-Nov-18 05:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the chain itself seems good though

[01-Nov-18 05:30 PM] jorian#4555
it's bogging down already

[01-Nov-18 05:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
3 nodes betting 2000 bets each

[01-Nov-18 05:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when its finsihed I will see percentage of fails etc

[01-Nov-18 05:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
might take a LONG time

[01-Nov-18 05:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if that dealer gets really stuck, restart it and call dice status just once, rather than cron

[01-Nov-18 05:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
let it just run through ... could take a few hours to clear out

[01-Nov-18 05:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can definitavly say, that the jl777 FSM branch does not like to send loads and loads of bets ...

[01-Nov-18 05:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
most there are failing to send TXs

[01-Nov-18 05:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
due to utxo selection

[01-Nov-18 05:42 PM] jorian#4555
2000 bets in how much time?

[01-Nov-18 05:43 PM] jorian#4555
i don't see a lot of transactions either

[01-Nov-18 05:43 PM] cipi#4502
found some other compile errors
```rpcserver.cpp: In function ‘UniValue stop(const UniValue&, bool)’:

looks like gcc-8 is very rigorous

[01-Nov-18 05:44 PM] cipi#4502
i can also switch to gcc-6, it is still on the servers...

[01-Nov-18 05:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jorian  Its 2000 bets in total,

[01-Nov-18 05:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It bets, waits for a result, then a confirm of sent bet, then sends another

[01-Nov-18 05:45 PM] jorian#4555
ah, slow death

[01-Nov-18 05:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
100 of them running alongside each other

[01-Nov-18 05:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on 3 nodes

[01-Nov-18 05:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
starts off really fast then usually breaks

[01-Nov-18 05:45 PM] jorian#4555
i have a dicestatus every 15 minutes

[01-Nov-18 05:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wallet ends up full of dust

[01-Nov-18 05:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and my own nodes just stop sending bets

[01-Nov-18 05:46 PM] jorian#4555
lol

thanks for reporting them. best to fix these types of things, 2 of them could have caused problems

[01-Nov-18 06:46 PM] cipi#4502
yes, i am not a dev, but things like `directive writing up to 255 bytes into a region of size between 219 and 238` sounds bad
looks like gcc-8 could be useful to find such things

[01-Nov-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
considering the amount of code, it is good sign that so few of these stric warnings

[01-Nov-18 11:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
all my bets are stuck in pending on latest jl777/FSM

[01-Nov-18 11:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I broke the dealer node

[01-Nov-18 11:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Need to multi thread it or have more than on table

[01-Nov-18 11:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you broke it?

[01-Nov-18 11:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
as in... a restart wont fix it?

[01-Nov-18 11:40 PM] Llama#1330
selling bulk KMDICE at a reduced price. dm me.

[01-Nov-18 11:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well ... I wanted to actually get some data I can use to work out how to fix the next part and it still isnt finished betting 😂

[01-Nov-18 11:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
8H later or somehthing

[01-Nov-18 11:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not broken ..

[01-Nov-18 11:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its just that the dealer node can only process 1 bet every 1s

[01-Nov-18 11:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
adn I am sending 10x that amount or more

[01-Nov-18 11:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when it stops sending the dealer should eventally process them all and it will work again

[01-Nov-18 11:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I wont spam this chain again btw... I think thats not needed anymore

[02-Nov-18 12:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
People can now play at once, provided they play it properly and not just repeat bet over and over

[02-Nov-18 12:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
before 2 ppl coudlnt play at the same time ...

[02-Nov-18 12:04 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we need a mechanism to block spammers like you 😂

[02-Nov-18 12:05 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
though i think your fixes have been awesome, thanks for your help and dedication.
