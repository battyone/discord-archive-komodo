[12-Nov-18 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its minng a chain with 0 BR and I changed the walelt code to ignore all coinbase with 0 value .. .as the wallet ends up full of them and you littterally cant send them to merge them together 😂

@Mylo my secret hope is that I can literally use 'literally' enough times, and in the proper context, that eventually it will go back to literally not being its own antonym

setting up a dealer node gui is done for the time being, on a test chain http://176.9.138.124:8081/#/contracts
hit the pink plus button, should work

[12-Nov-18 07:56 PM] Mylo#8306
if you run a dealer node on KMDICE, you can run this on localhost and ssh with tunnel to proxy your browser to it so it all remains on localhost.

[12-Nov-18 07:57 PM] Mylo#8306
i'll have instructions later in the week (maybe tomorrow)

[12-Nov-18 07:58 PM] Mylo#8306
click on console link and generate a block.  only 631 funds left in this (test) wallet.
These are not real KMDICE ❗

[12-Nov-18 08:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Mylo i think that this type of console would work great for marketmakers

[12-Nov-18 08:22 PM] Mylo#8306
totally agree.   it's next on my list after dice/oracles.   i think you have all the mm bash scripts.   we can collab if you want in a few weeks on it.

[12-Nov-18 08:24 PM] Mylo#8306
ssh tunnel and only exposing localhost (and if you really want, just start it when you ssh onto box) with browser control to mm RPC.    can be done from android/ios with the right ssh tunnel settings in your app.  and firefox plays nicely on mobiles for such things.

[12-Nov-18 08:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This is actually the mm killer app that is needed, a gui for marketmaking.

i found a small edge case, about 30 bets were not processed

about 2000 entropy tx got used (net) but all the rest looks fine

Just counted - placed more than 200,000 bets already 😂

did you win expected amount?

[13-Nov-18 08:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Waiting for result at the moment (taking a while)

[13-Nov-18 08:53 AM] TonyL#3577
To check on one node have to call dicestatus 70,000 times or so

[13-Nov-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
dealer node ran stable, thought maybe the stress test wasnt running

[13-Nov-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess that is a good sign

[13-Nov-18 08:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe just stress test isn't stress already

[13-Nov-18 08:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Have to double nodes amount 2night

[13-Nov-18 09:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Do it more than 5-6 I think will not have a much sense since whole dAPPS in the universe don't have such txs amount atm as  I think

[13-Nov-18 09:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think the segfault issue from my script is coming from the fact that it uses 0.1M of RAM with each loop 
seems that reusing a var doesn't have an implied "unset" so it just keeps growing

@jorian is dealer=0 node running? number of entropy tx is dropping

[13-Nov-18 09:23 AM] jorian#4555
gonna check

[13-Nov-18 09:23 AM] jorian#4555
yes, still up and still responsive

[13-Nov-18 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
so just not making the entropy tx fast enough?

[13-Nov-18 09:25 AM] jorian#4555
probably, it still is at 100% CPU

[13-Nov-18 09:25 AM] jorian#4555
i forgot to set it in a screen, so can't check current output anymore

[13-Nov-18 09:25 AM] jorian#4555
will do it when i restart the daemon

[13-Nov-18 09:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Now that i notice. From the 4million transactions a day eos is claiming, 25% is the dice game.

[13-Nov-18 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@TonyL  So you are only spamming dicebet as fast as you can ? In y experaiance that meant in the past that it just send hte same tx over and over

[13-Nov-18 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My script is sending a new bet only after a result is known and the last bet has been confirmed in a block.

[13-Nov-18 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Might be the new entroy selection I added ...

it kind of cant make the same tx over and over any more as it chooses a diffrent entropy
