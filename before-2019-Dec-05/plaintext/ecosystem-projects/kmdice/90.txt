I couldn't get my remote wallet to sync for fek, so I'm just uploading local to it 🤦🏽

should only take like 30 years (estimated time to transfer wallet.dat is 10 minutes)

had a node sync from scratch fine

[10-Nov-18 07:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Main issue is still sending enough bets from one wallet ... lot sof bet send failed... still its 100x better tha it was...

[10-Nov-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, before this weeks fixes, dice CC was only working if you were really nice to it

[10-Nov-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
now it seems it works pretty well, really the only issue is two nodes picking the same entropy utxo

[10-Nov-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and it isnt a money costing issue

[10-Nov-18 07:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes a better random selection will help there, my soution was very hacky and fast solution, doesnt really choose over the whole list of entropy.

[10-Nov-18 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
about 1% of the bets were having their dicefinish tx orphaned and even though I had handling in there for it, it somehow just got into a state of not making any progress

[10-Nov-18 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
deployed a fix to just refund these as they are rare enough

[10-Nov-18 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so now need to see if any other type of bets get stuck

[10-Nov-18 09:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jl777c have you worked on dice since commit `17d91e14f1324edbd2385cfb02bd14c42a981ddf`?
Something before that and after `9841d2984e853a06ccc736cfa9d91e5b8405bbe6` broke something

[10-Nov-18 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810
what is broken?

[10-Nov-18 09:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Reindexing break the chain

[10-Nov-18 09:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I posted above what the console printed

[10-Nov-18 09:28 PM] jl777c#5810
what about a full resync?

[10-Nov-18 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
bets work for me and others, no problems seen on dealer node

[10-Nov-18 09:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok. Will try tp delete everything and start over

[10-Nov-18 09:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Last time i saw those errors it was in the dealer node

[10-Nov-18 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that there was a single notarization done on the fork by notary nodes that didnt update

[10-Nov-18 09:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The issue was the wallet.dat

[10-Nov-18 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
if you get that one, then it wont sync properly

[10-Nov-18 09:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok

[10-Nov-18 09:31 PM] jl777c#5810
when all the notaries update, this problem should go away

[10-Nov-18 09:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok

[10-Nov-18 09:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`The issue was the wallet.dat`
@siu - Chainmakers will it work if I delete wallet and import or do I just need a clean, new wallet?

[10-Nov-18 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
so the problems are syncing and not dicebet?

[10-Nov-18 09:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dunno, can't bet if I'm 100 blocks behind 😛

[10-Nov-18 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe invalidateblock where it forked

[10-Nov-18 09:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Only issue is sending enough dicebets still .. no matter what I try on a single node after a little while it just floods -25 errors .. likely need a bot net of 100+ nodes/wallets to fill a block. 😂

[10-Nov-18 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
I imagine I could make a betblaster

[10-Nov-18 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it wouldnt need to be complex

[10-Nov-18 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
get the list of entropy utxos, get a list of your local utxo

[10-Nov-18 09:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the problem is just that its eelecting the same inputs... I have a skip of 80% in the uxto selection in CCtx.cpp but its not enough

[10-Nov-18 09:41 PM] jl777c#5810
allocate enough for a dicebet and construct a dicebet tx, proceed to next utxos

[10-Nov-18 09:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the trick is to allocate for all the bets at once

{Reactions}
👌 

[10-Nov-18 09:41 PM] jl777c#5810
see how i did the dicefinish

[10-Nov-18 09:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ive read some of it but not in depth yet.

[10-Nov-18 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
you dont need anything so fancy

[10-Nov-18 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
just make two utxo lists

[10-Nov-18 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
and construct a valid dicebet tx

[10-Nov-18 09:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 it should

[10-Nov-18 09:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I understand what you mean, does not seem difficult at all really

[10-Nov-18 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
mtx.vin.push_back(CTxIn(entropytxid,0,CScript()));
        if ( AddNormalinputs(mtx,mypk,bet+2*txfee+odds,60) > 0 )
        {
            hentropy = DiceHashEntropy(entropy,mtx.vin[0].prevout.hash,mtx.vin[0].prevout.n,1);
            mtx.vout.push_back(MakeCC1vout(cp->evalcode,entropyval,dicepk));
            mtx.vout.push_back(MakeCC1vout(cp->evalcode,bet,dicepk));
            mtx.vout.push_back(CTxOut(txfee+odds,CScript() << ParseHex(HexStr(mypk)) << OP_CHECKSIG));
            return(FinalizeCCTx(0,cp,mtx,mypk,txfee,EncodeDiceOpRet('B',sbits,fundingtxid,entropy,zeroid)));
        }

[10-Nov-18 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
you just need to use a different entropytxid/v0 for each one

[10-Nov-18 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if you make it broadcast after each one is created, then AddNormalinputs will check the mempool

[10-Nov-18 09:46 PM] jl777c#5810
now if you made the bet a fixed size for the blast and premake the correct sized utxo, then you can change the AddNormalInputs() call to just be:
mtx.vin.push_back(CTxIn(txids[i],vins[i],CScript()));

[10-Nov-18 09:47 PM] jl777c#5810
since you are allocating from the same array in an incrementing fashion, you wont conflict with any of your own dicebets

[10-Nov-18 09:47 PM] jl777c#5810
really, that is all that is needed

[10-Nov-18 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
just hinge off of funcid.E they are valid entropy utxo, so you can scan for them

[10-Nov-18 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
in any case, being able to construct a valid CC tx is very useful as we really need to test making illegal tx and make sure the validation catches them properly
