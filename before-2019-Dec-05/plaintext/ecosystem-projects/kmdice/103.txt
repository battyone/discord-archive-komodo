can other dice games be made for kmdice to play with?

[09-Jan-19 10:58 PM] Mylo#8306
with updates

[10-Jan-19 01:19 AM] Mylo#8306
eg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cee-lo that game they play on street corners in american movies

{Embed}
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cee-lo
Cee-lo
Cee-lo is a gambling game played with three six-sided dice.  There is not one standard set of rules, but there are some constants that hold true to all sets of rules. The name comes from the Chinese Sì-Wŭ-Liù (四五六), meaning "four-five-six". In America it is also call...

[10-Jan-19 07:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Current Dice CC can't return random value in given diapason, it returns Win or Loss with given probability for Win

[10-Jan-19 07:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Actually I think "Dice" name for this CC quite confusing - since people starting to imagine the usual dice where you getting a random number in range after throw, but this CC provide only result - kinda "GambleCC". Actually a lot of games possible to make but with pseudo RNG on already known result GUI representation part (I've posted example of such implementation in #cc-dice - same way possible to make blackjack and other games) what players might don't like. On current contract only possible to build a game which provides RPC calls of contract (gamble bet with odds)

[10-Jan-19 07:52 AM] Meyse#0952
How do you mean "what players might not like"? If the GUI is good the players won't even notice that the result has been given already and the GUI just is a representation of that.

[10-Jan-19 08:26 AM] TonyL#3577
I mean that player might not like that blockchain returned "won" but he see "5" or "6" instead. If you're playing usual dice game your result is a number from 1 to 6 (each one you can get with probability 1/6) but DiceCC can't return numbers - it can return only won or lose with given probability

[10-Jan-19 08:37 AM] Meyse#0952
Ah right, but I don't think it matters, cause the player won't see the difference anyway. You can present the player a number, even though the blockchain just says "won". The player probably won't even care, or even know about this, as long as it's all fair. 
This can be done with all games, roulette, slot machines, whatever

[10-Jan-19 08:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Let's say you want to make blackjack. There are 52 cards in deck. You need to draw one. 
Probability 1/52 so you placing a bet do diceCC with odds 51 (1:52). You get a result "won" - which card you'll show to player?

[10-Jan-19 08:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Or you want to roll dice: dice have 6 numbers. You placing a bet with odds 1:6 and get result "loss"

[10-Jan-19 08:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Which number you will show to player?

[10-Jan-19 08:46 AM] Meyse#0952
Im not great with the rules of gambling games. But roulette should be easy

[10-Jan-19 08:47 AM] Meyse#0952
It doesn't matter which number you show, as long as it's the one that the player didn't bet on, your dice example

[10-Jan-19 08:50 AM] Meyse#0952
For me it's easy, for the user it doesn't matter what you show exactly. If the blockchain says "loss", you just let the GUI pick a random number that's not the winner

[10-Jan-19 08:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Best implementation of roulette which I can imagine on it will be very boring - player will be supposed to bet on one result only (number, colour,  dozen or something else) and no multiplayer is possible

[10-Jan-19 08:54 AM] Meyse#0952
I thought about the logic, you can do multiple bets

[10-Jan-19 08:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Since if you put multiply bets which have only won or loss results it's possible that conflicting outcomes will happen

[10-Jan-19 08:55 AM] Meyse#0952
No, conflicting outcomes won't be possible, you just let the GUI pick the number the ball will roll into, based on what the blockchain says how the bets went

[10-Jan-19 08:57 AM] TonyL#3577
I place bet 1 coin on number 5 and place bet 100 coins on number 6 - both numbers have same probability to come 1/38. You placing bet to CC 1:38 and getting result "won"

[10-Jan-19 08:59 AM] Meyse#0952
Oh wow didn't think about that lol, then you can only do 1 unique number maybe. Roulette has many options

[10-Jan-19 08:59 AM] TonyL#3577
And on some point diceCC RNG sense missing at all and you can use "traditional" RNG which you want to put into GUI and use blockchain only for payments

[10-Jan-19 09:00 AM] TonyL#3577
If you playing roulette all you want on spin is random number from 1 to 38, not won or lose - thats why I think for other games other CC needed

[10-Jan-19 09:01 AM] Meyse#0952
You can do red,black,even,uneven,and other number things

[10-Jan-19 09:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah - such things are possible - where no need exact thing like a number 5 or Jack of spades card to evaluate other bets/things.
Btw odds 1:2 not working correct atm and disabled 😃

You could always make some custom roulette rules as well

[10-Jan-19 09:04 AM] TonyL#3577
I think it's closer atm to what you want to see

[10-Jan-19 09:04 AM] TonyL#3577
And already possible to play poker in CLI with lightning payments 😃

[10-Jan-19 09:05 AM] Meyse#0952
I really want to help create guis for these betting dapps, I think they could be huge. So if you need any ux/ui help pls let me know too

[10-Jan-19 09:05 AM] Meyse#0952
Yeah poker is crazy cool, I can't do cli tho :p

[10-Jan-19 09:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah GUIs is definitely what needs to deliver. Actually good looking webapp GUI for diceCC might be a first step

[10-Jan-19 09:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Where you can choose odds and place bet. Not sure if there any bounty for that but you may put some rake or commission on withdrawals let's say hehe.
 I made one as a prototype https://github.com/tonymorony/DiceCC-GUI but it's super ugly and desktop

You can also always make money with putting up an exchange service in the dapp, convert your just won kmdice or whatever to kmd, get a lp and take a margin on trades

Oh I'm learning programming almost from scratch too last months 😃

[10-Jan-19 09:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, it's good idea for monetisation

[10-Jan-19 09:17 AM] Meyse#0952
Yeah I'm trying a bit, it's steep though haha, my skills are really design,ux,ui

[10-Jan-19 09:34 AM] Mylo#8306
Just make mock ups, others can code it!

[10-Jan-19 09:54 AM] Meyse#0952
i might just do that

[10-Jan-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
dice CC is internally calculating numbers

[10-Jan-19 02:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the output of dice cc selects a number based on the entropy tx selected

[10-Jan-19 02:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think that a game could be done just by the number of entropy tx selected

[10-Jan-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
i use the standard method for blockchain dice to convert the entropy bits into win/loss based on the odds

[10-Jan-19 09:31 PM] Meyse#0952
Alright so Ive made a mockup, picked the game from @TonyL with the cards from cc-dice channel. Let me know what you guys think
