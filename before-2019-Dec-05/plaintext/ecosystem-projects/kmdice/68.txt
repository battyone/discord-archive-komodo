please...

[02-Nov-18 10:43 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
dont see any positive outcome on spamming the chain like this

[02-Nov-18 10:43 AM] Alright#0419
needed data on whether the fix worked

[02-Nov-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah

[02-Nov-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt think it would go tis long lol

[02-Nov-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems maybe the dealer stopped ages ago

[02-Nov-18 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As soon as si have some time I iwll check the resullts out

killing the dealer node and expecting it to be offline for more than 10 hours?

[02-Nov-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[02-Nov-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
kill it and the just keep on betting

[02-Nov-18 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its ok, I will try to fix the dealer node

[02-Nov-18 11:30 AM] jorian#4555
kill it, keep betting and then what?

[02-Nov-18 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
justkeep betting and betteing

[02-Nov-18 11:30 AM] jorian#4555
and then?

[02-Nov-18 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
way more than I did

[02-Nov-18 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the node will time out and you win all bets

[02-Nov-18 11:31 AM] jorian#4555
really

[02-Nov-18 11:31 AM] jorian#4555
ðŸ˜®

[02-Nov-18 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes this is why hte dealer node needs to be "fixed" not that its broken, but having a single table, means it needs to be able to handle all players

[02-Nov-18 11:31 AM] jorian#4555
when the dealer node is off line, bets are still allowed?

[02-Nov-18 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[02-Nov-18 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the funding is in a CC contract, all the deler does is process dicefinish

[02-Nov-18 11:33 AM] jorian#4555
why would you always win bets when the node is offline? doesn't make sense conceptually

[02-Nov-18 11:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they time out

[02-Nov-18 11:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it has to be offline for uite a while

[02-Nov-18 11:36 AM] jorian#4555
600

[02-Nov-18 11:36 AM] jorian#4555
blocks or minutes, don't know anymore

[02-Nov-18 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lucky my bets were all very small lol

[02-Nov-18 11:37 AM] jorian#4555
lol my node is still processing a lot of stuff

I sent a huge amount of bets lol

[02-Nov-18 11:38 AM] jorian#4555
i propose you rape a chain of your own, next time ðŸ˜…

[02-Nov-18 11:39 AM] Alright#0419
dude fixed it

[02-Nov-18 11:39 AM] Alright#0419
@jorian what the dealer is doing by doing dicefinish is sending a transaction that reveals the entropy, so it can be determined if it's a win/loss

[02-Nov-18 11:40 AM] Alright#0419
if dealer doesn't submit the entropy(dicefinish tx) after 600 blocks(time out set on plan), the better can do dicefinish and it's an automatic win

[02-Nov-18 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which was what my nodes was doing all day so I lef tit going

permaded?

[02-Nov-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
how much RAM in the node?

[02-Nov-18 12:01 PM] jorian#4555
16gb

[02-Nov-18 12:01 PM] jorian#4555
no

[02-Nov-18 12:01 PM] jorian#4555
32

[02-Nov-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
strange... that is deep in the networking code

[02-Nov-18 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
hopefully as you process the pending tx, it will stop doing such things

[02-Nov-18 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
the dealer node code needs to be optimized to handle unlimited bets

[02-Nov-18 12:02 PM] jorian#4555
i'll keep an eye on it

[02-Nov-18 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
next on the list

[02-Nov-18 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i see "only" 377 left in the mempool, not sure how many still need to be dicefinish

[02-Nov-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It wil be alot ... I hav stoped them all though

[02-Nov-18 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is due to some edge case in dealer node

[02-Nov-18 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
is it doing the dicefinish tx still?

[02-Nov-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe its trying to gfinish a bet thats alreadsy finished ?

[02-Nov-18 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it wasnt updated to latest code.

[02-Nov-18 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, definitely can have some unexpected cases with such a backlog. hopefully it can be cleared and get back to being responsive

[02-Nov-18 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I just did and restarted, seems like its now processing all bets

[02-Nov-18 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i mean, the old ones.

[02-Nov-18 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
the dealer node didnt have the mempool fix?

[02-Nov-18 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
no update in many days?

[02-Nov-18 12:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not updated from latest... maybe 2 days?

[02-Nov-18 12:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
now it is up to date.

[02-Nov-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
so all the bets are being processed?

[02-Nov-18 12:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes.

[02-Nov-18 12:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
now it seems so

[02-Nov-18 12:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think it finished.

has anyone been tracking dealer funds?

[02-Nov-18 12:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i have a oracle tracking it.

yesterday ðŸ˜‚

[02-Nov-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
the miner does seem to have a problem with large mempools full of dependent tx, if it misses any, then a lot of them dont look valid

[02-Nov-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
we really should have more than one mining pool

[02-Nov-18 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
how are you getting that data for oracles @siu - Chainmakers

[02-Nov-18 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
diceinfo?

[02-Nov-18 12:40 PM] Alright#0419
if so, how are you making sure there's none in mempool?

[02-Nov-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I added entropty tx to diceinfo

[02-Nov-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and there is over 10k of them still

[02-Nov-18 12:40 PM] Alright#0419
