yes, we are working out some fixes, should be ready to be played in a couple of hours

[02-Nov-18 06:12 PM] jorian#4555
when was the last time @forkwitch was here?

[02-Nov-18 06:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Last Wednesday at 3:30 PM

[02-Nov-18 06:22 PM] jorian#4555
we should hardfork to get the miners on a respectable pool

[02-Nov-18 06:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright can tell you why that's a bad idea

[02-Nov-18 06:24 PM] Alright#0419
announce it with plenty of time before hand if you do

[02-Nov-18 06:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think I've got CentOS to where I can run a halfway decent pool, so within a day or 2 of getting the CC sorted out, I can add another pool

[02-Nov-18 06:39 PM] jorian#4555
but mining pools are like fiat

[02-Nov-18 06:39 PM] jorian#4555
once people are accustomed, they won't move

[02-Nov-18 06:39 PM] jorian#4555
unless forced

[02-Nov-18 06:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, that depends on if they want income or not
stay with pool that pays 0.002 per block in fees or move to a pool that blocks as many txes as possible....

[02-Nov-18 07:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ill remove forkwitch pool from the ANN

[02-Nov-18 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
why? there doesnt seem to be any other pool, which is the fundamental problem

unconfirmed txs got stuck at 1254, wont go below that.

[02-Nov-18 07:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jl777c i did since it was bringing issues, i can add it

[02-Nov-18 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
what was the issue?

[02-Nov-18 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it is running latest version, mining isnt stuck

[02-Nov-18 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
the issue is there is no other pool. i keep saying this

[02-Nov-18 07:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok.

[02-Nov-18 07:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
added it to the ANN again, but dice game is unplayeable

[02-Nov-18 07:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it has been since yesterday

[02-Nov-18 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the answer is to get a second pool configured to mine nofee tx

[02-Nov-18 07:56 PM] jorian#4555
@0x03 or @webworker01 maybe want to set up a new one?

[02-Nov-18 07:57 PM] jorian#4555
I'll point my nicehash to it when that's up

[02-Nov-18 07:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what about @blackjok3r pool?

[02-Nov-18 07:58 PM] jorian#4555

[02-Nov-18 08:20 PM] 0x03#8822
whats the block reward of this AC?

[02-Nov-18 08:23 PM] Alright#0419
25 KMDICE until halving at block 210000

[02-Nov-18 08:23 PM] Alright#0419
then every 210000 blocks after that

[02-Nov-18 08:36 PM] 0x03#8822
ah, this should actually be easy then. for a reason i had a sub-1-reward in mind

[02-Nov-18 08:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The chain has the same supply and halving schedule of btc

[02-Nov-18 08:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We just premined 50 coins reward era

[02-Nov-18 08:50 PM] 0x03#8822
should be done within ~30

[02-Nov-18 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the pool needs to be setup to mine 0fee tx

[02-Nov-18 09:00 PM] 0x03#8822
i assume thats the `    "txfee": 0.0001` param in coins/kmdice.json (which should be 0 then)

[02-Nov-18 09:00 PM] 0x03#8822
let me research that

[02-Nov-18 09:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
iirc, that json param is for you sending out, not for recognition

[02-Nov-18 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
just need to launch the daemon to accept zerofee tx, you dont want to be sending out zero fee

[02-Nov-18 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i think you posted the required command line arg?

[02-Nov-18 09:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`-minrelaytxfee=0.00012 -blockminsize=950000 -blockmaxsize=1000000`
Is what my pool node was using

[02-Nov-18 09:05 PM] 0x03#8822
thus `-minrelaytxfee=0`?

[02-Nov-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes i think so

[02-Nov-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
that should be all that is needed

[02-Nov-18 09:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```ComputerGenie 😠Today at 9:07 AM
you don't want it 0
basically, you want a full block and in this order
paying over min
paying min
paying some
paying none```

[02-Nov-18 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, so forcing a minsize forces it to fill it with zero fee tx?

[02-Nov-18 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
what if there are not enough tx?

[02-Nov-18 09:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
min isn't `never build a block smaller than this`
it's more like
`if there are a shit tone of "good" txes, then this is the least size to put those that pay us`

[02-Nov-18 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so if only 10kb of tx, it will still make a block. i guess some overloaded syntax

[02-Nov-18 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess your options will the clear out the mempool? not sure if it will even add the 0fee tx into the mempool

[02-Nov-18 09:10 PM] 0x03#8822
well if NH wouldn't fucking log me out after every single click, i could in theory run a test

[02-Nov-18 09:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess I should have said it's (relay) kind of like
You're building a block with known stuff
someone has more stuff for you
you only want that stuff during this block if it helps you with this block

[02-Nov-18 09:13 PM] 0x03#8822

_isn't the greatest at explaining stuff :P_

[02-Nov-18 09:14 PM] jl777c#5810
basically adding: -minrelaytxfee=0.00012 -blockminsize=950000 -blockmaxsize=1000000
will fix the current problem and still also be ok for normal conditions

likely will take a long while to find a block though, but at least if you nodes mempool gets the backlog things will clear out

@jorian @siu - Chainmakers you might want to rebroadcast the tx so it gets into the mempool
