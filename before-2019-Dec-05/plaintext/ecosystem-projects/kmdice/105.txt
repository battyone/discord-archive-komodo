Hi hi. Quick question: how are the random numbers generated for the betting results?

[25-Jan-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
entropy utxo are created (with hash of entropy)

[25-Jan-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
player selects a random one and attaches his entropy

[25-Jan-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
both are combined to create the two values (entropy revealed)

[25-Jan-19 03:04 PM] Mick de Graaf | Dexwallet#8098
Aha nice! thanks for the quick answer

[25-Jan-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
so provably fair, immediately revealed, jointly calculated

[25-Jan-19 03:16 PM] Mick de Graaf | Dexwallet#8098
Another question hehe. What if I place a bet  await the result and if I lose 51% attack the network to revert the tx before it the blockhash is submitted to the komodo chain? Would my loss be reverted?

[25-Jan-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
if a 51% attack is detected, then it is canceled

[25-Jan-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
but the first bet would stand

[25-Jan-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not about the tx confirming . or not, but the usage of the entropy tx

[25-Jan-19 03:37 PM] Mick de Graaf | Dexwallet#8098
Ok thanks. Sounds interesting. Will read up on it

hey , lads . how many kmdice i expect to receive with mini z9 asic per day and how do i play this kmdice game . i did installed agama wallet and done all setting in kmdice ( syncing and validate pubkey ) now its said i can play from any kmdice gui available !

[31-Jan-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
700ksols network, if you get 10ksols. that is 1.5% hashrate of 36000 coins per day -> about 500 per day

[31-Jan-19 06:50 PM] prigo#8525
@jl777c  that strange its shows network hashrate only 400k but hashrate 750k . so 500 per seems its better to buy on market than mining

[31-Jan-19 07:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@prigo what is "it"?

[31-Jan-19 08:18 PM] prigo#8525
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 it better to buy kmdice than mine ! now i need assist how to install the game . any run go software or like ibsaw so many command abd string to run

[31-Jan-19 10:01 PM] ch6ris#5240
As far as I know gui is not ready. You can play from cli. Did someone make a video? GUI would be fantastic.

@ch6ris I want to start make "unofficial" one with graphics from gif in a few days

[31-Jan-19 10:09 PM] TonyL#3577
My idea is run it on KMDCC chain rather than KMDICE but it will be possible to use it with any chain actually

[31-Jan-19 10:25 PM] TonyL#3577

[06-Feb-19 01:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Deleted User The basics of the GUI are done, the dev still needs to get more functionality working and make the wallet page. But the dev got busy again with MM2 integrations on AtomicDEX so it will take a bit longer than expected to get the GUI done

[06-Feb-19 01:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

**Attention miners! Should you currently be mining on kmdice.komodopool.xyz (or have kmdice.komodopool.xyz set as one of your backup pools) - this one is for you!**
Effective now, the main pool host has been migrated to `kmdice.pool-mining.xyz`. The port number for the high diff/NH/MRR port has been changed from 18888 to 8889. Please adapt your miner configs accordingly and reconnect as soon as possible!
Additionally, the pool is now reachable within TOR directly: http://fkusu6b4kuadebew.onion (if you're really brave you can mine to the onion host as well, it works, but it's not recommended)
The old infrastructure will stay online for about a week to not interfere with anybodys potentially open NH/MRR orders. Thank you!
BTW and the new pool website is https://kmdice.pool-mining.xyz

c'mon kmdice, I really want blackjack 😍

[04-Mar-19 07:01 AM] TonyL#3577
If someone can describe model by which it's possible to make blackjack game logic on current DiceCC - I can  connect some simple GUI like this: https://github.com/momo-ozawa/blackjack-gui. It shouldn't take much time.

I don't see any ways how it's possible to make blackjack on DiceCC RPC calls - maybe somebody else see

[04-Mar-19 07:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because it's 2 numbers and the 2nd is higher or lower than the 1st, you can't
especially since the 1st is static based on odds

[04-Mar-19 07:07 AM] TonyL#3577
I see one way of cards drawing but it need very reliable and fast response from DiceCC (now result may be void and changes on next call what is not suitiable):
Full deck
1) Making dicebet with some not significant sum like a 0.0001 on odds 52
If first bet won you draw 2 of hearts, if second you draw 3 of hearts... if only 52th - it's ace of spades

on  next draw you do same but up to 51 and keep in memory that you have one card less now

[04-Mar-19 07:07 AM] TonyL#3577
And so on

[04-Mar-19 07:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Since its' without edge these "service RNG calls" will give 50/50 result

[04-Mar-19 07:09 AM] TonyL#3577
But it burns txfee on each card draw. Hope oneday someone will make a new VegasCC contract which will allow to create games (CC should combine adjustable RNG which returns random things from diapason/list + ability to create games and accept buyins  / make payout)

[04-Mar-19 07:18 AM] TonyL#3577
I think in theory it's possible to make "gambling-complete" CC on which will be possible to implement any game based on odds and payouts

[04-Mar-19 07:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I agree, it could be done with CC; I just don't see a way to do BJ with DiceCC

[04-Mar-19 07:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Yup, I think the same. Just wanted to explain for those who are waiting for blackjack or something else like this 😃

[04-Mar-19 07:26 AM] TonyL#3577
DiceCC just very confusing naming for current contract functionality imo. People imagine usual dice - usual dice return you a number in range of dice edges. Current contract saying did you win or lose, it's something like a WinLoseCC

[04-Mar-19 07:29 AM] TonyL#3577
You even can't make usual dice (craps) casino game on DiceCC because you need to know exact number
