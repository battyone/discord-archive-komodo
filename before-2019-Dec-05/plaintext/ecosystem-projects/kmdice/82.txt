got that and then forked

[08-Nov-18 09:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me try set little delay between executions - maybe it's related to hardware limitation

[08-Nov-18 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
ba2db4051858acdad5c5c132577dabc27e6587a8ed306d5f5705ac79a3554787 is only 13 blocks in the past, but it is valid

[08-Nov-18 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
is your computer running hot?

[08-Nov-18 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
dont laugh, I had a system that had secp256k1 errors due to some hardware issue, my guess was overheating

[08-Nov-18 09:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
36C

[08-Nov-18 09:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
max 42C

[08-Nov-18 09:11 PM] TonyL#3577
I've set two 1 second delays: 1 second after hex generating, 1 second after broadcasting attempt.
Still getting quite much 
```error code: -22
error message:
TX decode failed
```🤔

[08-Nov-18 09:11 PM] TonyL#3577
When trying to brodcast such hex manually getting "missing inputs" error

[08-Nov-18 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
what if you wait until the txid is in the mempool?

[08-Nov-18 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
what is happening i think is that you are reusing the inputs as it doesnt use the wallet and checks the mempool

[08-Nov-18 09:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a until previous one is in mempool?

[08-Nov-18 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so no need for a 1second delay, but wait until it ends up in the mempool

[08-Nov-18 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
with some max time like 10 seconds

[08-Nov-18 09:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah it seems to be like this since odds and bet amount are the same

[08-Nov-18 09:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe generate betamount as some random number

[08-Nov-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
or have 0.001, 0.002, 0.003, ... bets along with 0.0011, 0.0021, 0.0031 utxos

[08-Nov-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so it would pick the different utxo for each one

[08-Nov-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
then you can issue N dicebets of different amounts

[08-Nov-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
then check to see which ones confirmed

[08-Nov-18 09:16 PM] TonyL#3577
I think better to do way like this since if I'll wait to much between bets there is a big chances that block will be mined and it'll be not proper "spam same block" test

[08-Nov-18 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, you could just accept a 40% dropout

[08-Nov-18 09:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah test showing that even some crazy gambler will decide to bet 500 bets with same amount and odds in 20 seconds he'll able to sucessfully place more than a half

[08-Nov-18 09:19 PM] jl777c#5810
which is actually not so bad

{Reactions}
➕ 

[08-Nov-18 09:33 PM] TonyL#3577
If I'm just incrementing bet amount it's making situation even worser (I guess my wallet just running out of UTXOs)
When I've bet 0.0010, 0.0011, 0.0012, 0.0013.... Just 105 from 200 bets were placed

[08-Nov-18 09:33 PM] TonyL#3577
So have to prepare UTXOs first

[08-Nov-18 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
fixed a crash, rebooted node, was behind 200 dicebets, caught up in 8 seconds

[08-Nov-18 09:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Dealer node crashed?

[08-Nov-18 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[08-Nov-18 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
amazing thing is nobody noticed 😃

[08-Nov-18 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
including the time to debug, though maybe the crash is still there, it only crashes under heavy load

[08-Nov-18 09:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Should I continue? 😃

[08-Nov-18 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
as you see the issue with blasting a bunch of dicebets, the dealer node has to process the bets and also deal with the same issues

[08-Nov-18 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, node is running, plz try to crash it

[08-Nov-18 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
sometimes the tx doesnt go in the mempool

[08-Nov-18 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
sometimes it gets and error and a new utxo set is needed

[08-Nov-18 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i tried to cover all cases,without having it use up a lot of CPU

[08-Nov-18 09:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, attacking 😃

[08-Nov-18 09:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_forked again and wasn't even doing anything_

[08-Nov-18 09:42 PM] jl777c#5810
CPU usage is 20% to 50% of a single core for the most part, with occasional spikes to 100%

[08-Nov-18 09:42 PM] jl777c#5810
how many peers do you have?

[08-Nov-18 09:42 PM] jl777c#5810
what about the -connect trick?

[08-Nov-18 09:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Not sure how peers or `connect` is going to change it refusing to accept a valid block

[08-Nov-18 09:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it should automatically reconsider it

[08-Nov-18 09:46 PM] Decker#3767

@TonyL gimme your address, on next block i will send you some coins.

[08-Nov-18 09:54 PM] Decker#3767

caught up with 200+ bets

[08-Nov-18 10:04 PM] TonyL#3577
I've set both on 1000 blasts

[08-Nov-18 10:05 PM] TonyL#3577
It's even not means 1000 bets but 1000 attempts, so at least 600 will be placed I hope 😃

[08-Nov-18 10:10 PM] jl777c#5810
a refund will show as a "win" of the amount bet

@jl777c Hmm maybe possible to add some "refund" status? It'll be quite hard to test RNG if actually non won bets will get a "win" status

[08-Nov-18 10:15 PM] TonyL#3577
And reflect in GUIs as well will be confusing
