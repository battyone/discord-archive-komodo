Pending usually happens if the dealer node is backed up...

[30-Oct-18 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The only other thing that can happen, is if the dicebet tx was sent, but another dicebet is confirmed in a block, and the dicebet tx can get orphaned

[30-Oct-18 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There likely needs to be some check added... To dice scripts, or GUI that tries to resend rawtransaction every few seconds. As once hte TX is invalidated by an incomoing block it will then fail to send, and the dAPP will know to create  a new one.

[30-Oct-18 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also the code that chooses utxo locally, isnt randomised and in real time, so you can create bad transactions with it espicially if you create them too quickly... there is some commented code in my commit you can uncomment to fix that, but it then allows nodes to spam contracts.

[30-Oct-18 12:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it eventually confirmed

[30-Oct-18 12:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
unlike the orphaned ones that end up saying something like "couldnt decode txid"

[30-Oct-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so any problems since the latest update?

[30-Oct-18 12:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so far none... other than the pending tx that confirmed eventually, nothing bad

[30-Oct-18 12:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but needs more traffic to be sure

im gonna be rich!!! must bet moar!

[30-Oct-18 12:27 PM] ciumete#3212
very slow...

[30-Oct-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  before I start on trying to pay a percentage of a block reward to a multi sig address is there any way to test the cause of a slow result ?

[30-Oct-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Like when it just loops bet pending for ages and then evenutally passes ?

[30-Oct-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Is there a way to tell why its pending, as it is meant to be close to real time

[30-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
pending because dealer hasn't done dicefinish yet

[30-Oct-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats what I thaught

[30-Oct-18 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so its just a matter or someone multithreading the dealer, or simply having multiple tables to spread the load out.

[30-Oct-18 12:45 PM] Alright#0419
dealer should really wait until bet is notarized if they want to be careful

[30-Oct-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doent seem like something I can easily do, so will leave this unless what I made to fix mempool conesnsus problem has some issues

[30-Oct-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then it wouldnt be in real time.... which is the whole point

[30-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Alright#0419
mitigates the reorg attack vector

[30-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Alright#0419
lol you're betting in real time

[30-Oct-18 12:47 PM] Alright#0419
just don't know if you won or lost real time

[30-Oct-18 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
I can describe ways to speed up dealer node processing and details on how to block the 51% attack

[30-Oct-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
those seem the last bottle neck here

[30-Oct-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I think we need to test some other contracts on a chain with the mempool fix and make sure it doesnt break them

[30-Oct-18 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, lets make sure things are stable now then we can speed it up and make it 51% secure

[30-Oct-18 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
one easy way to speed up dealer node processing is as follows:

[30-Oct-18 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
make 4 dealer nodes, dealer0, dealer1, dealer2, dealer3

[30-Oct-18 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
for each incoming tx, mask all but the last 2 bits of the bettxid and only process the one that matches the dealer nodeid

[30-Oct-18 12:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so, do we do a campaign to get more betters or do we do scripts?

[30-Oct-18 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh without a dealer node speed up there isnt much point trying ot stress it..

[30-Oct-18 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
using 3 bits you can have 8 nodes

[30-Oct-18 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the issue with forks have stopped no?

[30-Oct-18 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to make sure forkwitch pool is updated

[30-Oct-18 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
then stress it as much as we can with scripts

{Reactions}
ðŸ‘Œ 

[30-Oct-18 12:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, no forks in a couple of days

[30-Oct-18 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I left some comented out code in my commit that allows a single node to do a LOT of bets at once.

[30-Oct-18 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but the pool isnt mining enough txs at this stage ... the pool with the most hash rate should never fork even on old version, as its choosing txs out of its own mempool, so should never be able to invalidate its own block.

[30-Oct-18 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but for a clean test, the biggest (only?) pool should be on the latest version

[30-Oct-18 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes has to be

[30-Oct-18 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats why I stopped sending thousands of bets

[30-Oct-18 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
@forkwitch

[30-Oct-18 12:56 PM] SHossain#0007
i have a small pool running with 2 minis

[30-Oct-18 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
public?

[30-Oct-18 01:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
do you think that having the house node running in various servers at the same time would fix something?

[30-Oct-18 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
not until there is a way to have dealerids

[30-Oct-18 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah that would likely cause more problems than it would solve... So the idea is to spread the load over multiple dealer nodes

[30-Oct-18 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think just having more tables does much the same thing ?

[30-Oct-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
if different pubkeys make different tables, then it would spread the load

[30-Oct-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
just having a way to set dealer id, make sure you have all 4 running and then you get 4x capacity

[30-Oct-18 01:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think your idea will be very useful for other contacts though, so it might be a good thing to work on next to keep learning about them. I wil have to write a contract at come point so I should get more experiance with them in any way possible.

[30-Oct-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
additionally, making it have more of an internal state machine control flow, with different queues for different states would get 10x or more capacity

[30-Oct-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
right now one node is queuing all dicebets to process

[30-Oct-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
then in the background processes them serially

[30-Oct-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess that can just be made into multiple threads to make things go in parallel as long as the proper locks are done

[30-Oct-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
multithreaded dapp code is a bit tricky though

[30-Oct-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
there really isnt that much processing, most of it is waiting for it to appear in the mempool

[30-Oct-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so I would suggest breaking down the dealer node dicebet processing into as many different steps as possible

[30-Oct-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
making a queue of requests for each step

[30-Oct-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
launching a thread to handle each queue

[30-Oct-18 01:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the problem for KMDICE is that all funds where used in one table so there isnot much capacity to do more tables now :/

[30-Oct-18 01:08 PM] SHossain#0007
sorry, James. my pool doesn't have payment processing setup. anyone point hash in there will not receive payment

[30-Oct-18 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
figure out how to take them out

[30-Oct-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats actually fine, because it allowed to find bottlenexks not apparent in testing before

[30-Oct-18 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
and recreate with more tables

[30-Oct-18 01:09 PM] SHossain#0007
if anyone wants to point hash there, please let me know and i'll post the address

[30-Oct-18 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
figure out how to deactivate that table entirely then change block subsidy for 1 block

[30-Oct-18 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
and recreate it

[30-Oct-18 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that mempool issue, would ahve broken many contracts down the line of not found and fixed

[30-Oct-18 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
yep, good find

[30-Oct-18 01:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im going to opt for a snapshot and airdrop to a new chain as last option

[30-Oct-18 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
yea best to keep the chain

[30-Oct-18 01:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think that is the easy way out of the problems :trollface:

[30-Oct-18 01:10 PM] Alright#0419
if you snapshot/airdrop, you can stream bootstrap of original chain to the new chain

[30-Oct-18 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doent really solve anyting unless we break the chain totally by trying to fix bugs

[30-Oct-18 01:10 PM] Alright#0419
other dealers can open up shop

[30-Oct-18 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
i think we can keep making it faster and fixing bugs with existing chain

[30-Oct-18 01:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so far its working great for me today.

[30-Oct-18 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
not sure what the incentivize would be to use another dealer though

[30-Oct-18 01:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
imo using many dealers just spreads out the fun

[30-Oct-18 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if the dealer node could process 100x the tx, what would the issues be?

[30-Oct-18 01:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its like everyone is playing on their own table

[30-Oct-18 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That will fix it... and allow many more high throughput contracts to be based on its logic.

[30-Oct-18 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Think I will have a go at it... seems a great challenge.

[30-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
do you have enough to implement the multiple queues approach?

[30-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yes it is a bit beyond what you have done so far, but i think within reach

[30-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea is to not have any sleeps

{Reactions}
ðŸ˜‚ trollface (2) 

[30-Oct-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is 100% of the time processing a new bet

[30-Oct-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
from what I remember the time from when it is broadcast to when it appears in the mempool was a bit slow and I had to add a sleep

[30-Oct-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
what you do instead of putting a sleep, is to put it into another queue

[30-Oct-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
then the first loop is done!

[30-Oct-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
so it can then keep up with a lot of dicebet coming in

[30-Oct-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
then there is another thread that processes the other queue, what it does it iterate through the list and sees if it is done, if it is, it removes the entry and completes the processing

[30-Oct-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
probably a 10 millisecond sleep at the end of the queue before starting again to prevent eating up 100% of a core just looping over and over

[30-Oct-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the above will increase throughput immensely as it removes the sleep 1 entirely

[30-Oct-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so if 10 tx can be processed in a second it is 10x capacity increase

[30-Oct-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
but 100+ can be done in a second
