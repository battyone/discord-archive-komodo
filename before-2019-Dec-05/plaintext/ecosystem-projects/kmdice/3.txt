@CrisF I'm rewriting the chat dapp in python at the moment. I plan to have two modes, threads and chat rooms

[18-Oct-18 12:51 PM] Alright#0419
threads will act as a forum, where you can edit posts and they will always show in the correct order

[18-Oct-18 12:51 PM] Alright#0419
chat room just acts as a chat room

#dev-scalability has been silent unfortunately

[18-Oct-18 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah MoMoM bug ... I was asked to upgrade the test to use them, and CC transactions... but with a ~5% fail rate on migrates, and the coins are lost forever, if anyone scrutinises it ... we are screwed.

[18-Oct-18 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems a very minor issue on the surface ... but clearly it must not be.

[18-Oct-18 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my bet its its some silly bug .

[18-Oct-18 12:57 PM] jorian#4555
and libscott needs to fix it?

[18-Oct-18 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It appears so yes.

There's a downside to working with things that only a handful of people in the world are smart/educated enough to know and understand 😦

[18-Oct-18 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I understand how it works... probably more than anyone apart from him... but i dont understand C++

[18-Oct-18 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
at all... im far too noob at it

[18-Oct-18 01:03 PM] Alright#0419
if you're a noob at it, idk what that makes me

[18-Oct-18 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol....

[18-Oct-18 01:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, that's what I mean, I know x, you know y, soandso knows z and only like 2 people in the world know x,y, *and* z

python cannot do MoMoM migrates

just cant

extremly doubtful that this can be written in python, sort of rerwiting the entire bitcoin codebase and all of KMD in it

[18-Oct-18 01:04 PM] jorian#4555
:trollface:

[18-Oct-18 01:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so, no one is breaking the contract?

[18-Oct-18 01:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The worst thing about komodo code is that its C AND C++ mised together everywhere, and finding where it referances structures/objets is very confusing

[18-Oct-18 01:05 PM] Alright#0419
what do i get if I do? :trollface:

[18-Oct-18 01:06 PM] Alright#0419
that unlimited buy offer at .001 would make me very happy :trollface:

[18-Oct-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
he put ip the offer ... I mean we cant force him to honour it... but he has in the past

[18-Oct-18 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what do i get if I do?` the $1.50 that it's worth 😛

[18-Oct-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there were no rules stipulated on it

_was being facetious_

[18-Oct-18 01:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Alright that would be 10.5k KMD

[18-Oct-18 01:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not bad at all

[18-Oct-18 01:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
maybe i should add a couple more entropy tx :p

[18-Oct-18 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
yea, but that seems pretty shitty

[18-Oct-18 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
he obviously wasn't thinking he'd have 1/2 the total supply dumped on him

[18-Oct-18 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in fairness, I can't imagine anyone paying for coins they can't use

[18-Oct-18 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
more entropy tx doesn't make it harder

[18-Oct-18 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You could attack it, get all the coins, and the redistibute them so it works better ?

[18-Oct-18 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know that uses up your time, but maybe you should just do that

[18-Oct-18 01:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah... im not thinking anyone will pay for it.

[18-Oct-18 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
smks TUI can bet on all tables at once ... fund X tables

[18-Oct-18 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you empty it

[18-Oct-18 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then make 100 tables

[18-Oct-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there really is no attack vector... unless flood betting all the tables at once does somehting... not sure we tested that.

[18-Oct-18 01:13 PM] jorian#4555
suddenly i'm bullish on CHIPS again

[18-Oct-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should have launched this on chips

[18-Oct-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once CC was ported

[18-Oct-18 01:14 PM] jorian#4555
yes :abusedsmily:

[18-Oct-18 01:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
why break CHIPS when you can break KMDICE

[18-Oct-18 01:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
definitively minable assets are more attractive in KMD ecosystem

[18-Oct-18 01:23 PM] SHossain#0007
true

I think PoS also has a future with the right plan and right marketing

[18-Oct-18 01:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
until then, though, if it makes them 2 cents, *someone* will dump mine 😛

@blackjok3r Regarding MoMoM issue, I haven't yet touched anything about MoMoM just have coarse picture about the principle. So I would take probablly too much time to figure it out...

If I was to work out most of if can yoy help me with C++ ?

[18-Oct-18 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a lot of time, *if* I spend all my time on that one problem...

[18-Oct-18 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was getting boggesed down, and figured anything else that helped me learn c/++ in the mean time would help

[18-Oct-18 01:32 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yep, if you have problem understanding something or how to do it in C++, I'm at your service...

great .. once I have finished this streamer, if libscott isnt back, I will be in touch. thanks you... I think i still need some more experiance... finishing this streamer should get me far enough to have basics down.

[18-Oct-18 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the iguana code base is so hard to follow ... so I an going to just write my own queue from scratch, even though there are already functions there for it.. 😅

[18-Oct-18 01:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That streamer idea is awesome

[18-Oct-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its pretty cool yes ... surprisingly also wasnt that difficult

[18-Oct-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
however, the hardest part remains ot be solved and thats getting the data into the blaster...

[18-Oct-18 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can fill a chain with randomly generated or static data and theroeticaly remove it ... but I think getting the iguana side working first to put the data in is the most importnatn, once I know how to do that, gettig it out seems pretty easy ..

[18-Oct-18 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was most imporant to simply never use the wallet

[18-Oct-18 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you never send or receive any transactions with it, becasue if you did it would bodgdown and stop receiving instantly.

[18-Oct-18 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Quite easily solved by useing a new chain for each stream however.

[18-Oct-18 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
getting data into blaster is easy

yeah streaming idea was brilliant PoC of tech, showing flexibility and scalability of the platform.

[18-Oct-18 02:10 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I agree

[18-Oct-18 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
easy for you ... you know how the queues work ... taking me a long time to find the structures they use so I know what data to put whree.

[18-Oct-18 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
I prefer time spent to get the streaming chain working

[18-Oct-18 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
you make your own structure

[18-Oct-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there are functions there enquue and dequeue

[18-Oct-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
was just going to use them... as they store a string

[18-Oct-18 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
struct datachunk { struct datachunk *next,*pref; uint8_t data[8192]; uint16_t datalen; };

[18-Oct-18 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
next and prev with * infront

[18-Oct-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once I started reading it... you need to mutex the structure to add or remove and stuff... and there was already code dthat did that.

[18-Oct-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so I figured just use that

[18-Oct-18 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
portable_mutex_init once

[18-Oct-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
made 2 new APIs add and remove

[18-Oct-18 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
portable_mutex_lock

[18-Oct-18 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
portable_mutex_unlock

[18-Oct-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once I can add and remove... then i can just call the remove funciton form inside the blaster

[18-Oct-18 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
not the most difficult

[18-Oct-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
DL_REMOVE_SAFE

[18-Oct-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
the one with SAFE you dont need mutex

[18-Oct-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
yes inside the blaster use REMOVE (safe) variant

[18-Oct-18 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
still not quite understanding how to find what though

[18-Oct-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
you get a point to a structure

[18-Oct-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
ptr->field

[18-Oct-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
did you find where I use it?
