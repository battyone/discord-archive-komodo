[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> Plus I'm sorry that I'm  talking about hush here

[17-Sep-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> ^ That is exactly why I haven't reached out to them in approximately two months, we had reached out beforehand but I figured proof of progress would give us a leg up.

[17-Sep-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> BTCH is planned to be supported by NG as well.

[17-Sep-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But as far as BTCH getting on Bittrex, I'd say there's no realistic chance right now. Hush has somewhat of a shot with NG and dPoW

[17-Sep-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> The messenger is going to be something very special

[17-Sep-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Much more established

[17-Sep-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @Berg I do not want to get into your sphere of work, just decided as a member of the community to write to them) I think you know better than me when you need to do this)

[17-Sep-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> That's what I think too... Hush has a much better chance of getting listed once the messenger is ready

[17-Sep-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Oh, I was just giving you my Bittrex account info if they absolutely need it and want to move forward

[17-Sep-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> If you think that it's too early for BTCH to be published on Bittrex, can it wait?

[17-Sep-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> IMO, let's first wait for completion of messenger and then get hush listed. After that, there'll be more understanding of the messenger and btch listing application would make more sense.

[17-Sep-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> Just my opinion though.

[17-Sep-18 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> BTCH at least needs to revitalization done in my personal opinion. Once mining and algorithms are worked out and we have some traction back it'd be worth giving a shot. We wouldn't really want to be listed just to have an instant hardfork

[17-Sep-18 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Plus I don't think BTCH is an attractive project to an exchange of that magnitude yet, we'll build up to it as the ball gets rolling on the upcoming changes.

[17-Sep-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Well, I agree that the best candidate is HUSH, probably really it is worth waiting for the release of the messenger to come to Bittrex and say: Guys see what a unique and interesting project I have, you must have to list me!)

[17-Sep-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Combined with dPoW I believe we honestly have a shot at it

[17-Sep-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Good,  we must just wait

[17-Sep-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> When I look at some coins that are traded on Bittrex, I think why are you so good that you were added here?)

[17-Sep-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it is actually a lot more than only smart contracts

[17-Sep-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> As I understand it, BTCH will receive opportunities and updates from Komodo, what special role and distinctive feature will BTCH receive?

[17-Sep-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> Plus this won't be something created *only* for btch, it's for all KMD chains. Hush, OTOH, is going to have its very own messenger.

[17-Sep-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> yes, but having the capability and doing something with it are two different things. CC is a blank canvas for each coin to use to make its own from it

[17-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> try to see beyond

[17-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> to what is possible with CC that is actively used

[20-Sep-18 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MrMoyolo> where can I find info on how to retreive my btch?

[20-Sep-18 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MrMoyolo> And are there exchanges yet that list btch?

[20-Sep-18 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> coinexchange.io and digitalprice.io have listed BTCH

[20-Sep-18 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> BTCH can be claimed through agama wallet

[20-Sep-18 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MrMoyolo> thanks!

[20-Sep-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MrMoyolo> what are the plans for bitcoin hush? volume is 0 on both exchanges

[20-Sep-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> there are plans to increase supply and make it 50% PoS/50% PoW and possibly make it mineable with only CPU's using Verushash algorithm. the other big thing is CC(Crypto Conditions), basically smartcontracts.

[20-Sep-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> BTW we need a good summary of what is planned because i'm forgetting something 😃

[21-Sep-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <paia> Verushash algo is no longer a CPU-only... You can mine it with nvidia cards now.

[21-Sep-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> at a higher power cost and equipment cost. so both are viable and depending on if you have fully paid hardware or not and your electricity cost, CPU or GPU will be better. neither totally dominates the other and I would say a slight edge to CPUs

[dscrd-hush] <Dochteur> So would it be a good idea to stockpile some available BTCH traded at coinxchange for future staking? Would it be announced at the BTCH main site, once available, or just via discord? What amount of it would make any sense to make reasonable passive income from it before it hits next bull market prices?

[19-Nov-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Dochteur amount is relative term, but I would not recommend you more than few % of your portfolio. As future directions of coin are unclear I consider it as high risk investment. Possible high reward one, but also high risk. I am also buying, but it will be a long way before the final destination. The main argument why team has to do something with the coin? They are holding a big bag (150k coins of dev funds) which should be around 10% (+/- 5%) of realistic circulating supply. At one stage they will have to unload them, so it should motivate a team to do something with that bag.

[06-Dec-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Takoy_Nahal , @Berg , were you recently in contact with Cryptopia about opening BTCH markets? What are Cryptopia's conditions? It's possible they don't know anything about BTCH progress. As there were dozens of forks that days it's also possible they forgot BTCH fork occured. I would imagine they don't follow the progress of unknown forks. People come and go, it's possible they have other people in charge now compared to january/february 2018. They might not know what a big player they are in BTCH sphere. On the other hand, bringing them into the game means massive staker when POS will be activated.

[06-Dec-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Consider something within HUSH/BTCH team. It's not impossible they would open BTCH markets for free. But you can also bring another whale along. If we are playing a fair game I would contact them about BTCH progress. Now or when HUSH markets will be back online. But one must notice there is a risk they can stake only and not open BTCH markets. Do your risk management. As I can't predict coin's directions I can't be the one who is making a decisions. I can only make a suggestion or reminder.

[06-Dec-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> I think this is more a question of Berg or Duke.

[09-Dec-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiveBuddha> @halo kitty rules there are no external developers for btch, and no internal marketing. So there is no exchange ambition at the moment. However if external development started to yield significant results (maybe through crypto conditions) there would be incentive for marketing and btch would pick up. Time will tell. Not at the moment.

[09-Dec-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> ⚰

[09-Dec-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Just kidding.

[09-Dec-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @JiveBuddha  Yes, we already get it at the moment there isn't much of anything in HUSH and BTCH. Devs must survive also in bear trend and must do something other beside work on these coins. But that shouldn't be the case for ever. Progress will follow but so will listing fees rise up. It's not an ideal time only for shopping, it's also an ideal time for widespearing to the new areas. And if speaking about Cryptopia, they have at least 500 complete shitcoins under their belt. I don't see a problem to go out with unfinished project as BTCH. Marketing and development are two different species of animals. Even if development is slow or on HODL, marketing can work undisturbed.

what is that you are trying to do achieve?
you can use Lite mode to login and access the funds if you have the private key of that address

[04-Jan-19 09:34 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have a backed up wallet.dat you need to use native mode and fully sync chain data before accessing funds
