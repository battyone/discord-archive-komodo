Is btch not available on agama mobile?

[02-Jun-19 04:49 PM] SHossain#0007
it is available

[02-Jun-19 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> Sorry for what might be a dumb question.  How can BTCH have a 21M supply if it was airdropped 1:1 with multiple chains adding up to way more than 21M supply?

[02-Jun-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> snapshot of the chains at the time was not the ultimate coin supply. how do you calculate the existing supplies at the time of the airdrop as being "way more than" 21 mil?

[02-Jun-19 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <aledel> He is calculating Max supply + Max supply :Surprised_Pikachu:

[02-Jun-19 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> my understanding from the website is BTCH has a max supply of 21M (same supply as BTC).  so the dropping 1:1 with BTC would create the full supply, no?  and then add in the other chains...

[03-Jun-19 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> BTC does not have 21M coins circulating though...

[03-Jun-19 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> You‚Äôre talking max supply, not circulating supply.

[03-Jun-19 12:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Cryptographic You most likely missunderstanding terms ¬®circulating supply¬® and ¬®maximum supply¬®. BTC and BTCH maximum supply is 21M. Only 21M of each will ever exist.. On the other hand circulating supply represent number of coins into existance at any given moment. At the moment BTC circulating supply is 17.7M and rising.

[03-Jun-19 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> On feb. 1 2018, when snapshot happened (BTCH ¬®appeared¬®) there were 16.8M of BTC and 3.2M of HUSH into existence. Also 2 minor coins and some premine were taken into account, alltogether still combined for less than 21 M.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> But you're right that fork details were poorely shared with public. That was due to lack of time and personel.

[09-Jun-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Chippiru> Ok. Up to 1M BTCH for DEX holders, 778k for UNITY, harder to calculate BTCH for BTC holders. What is the circulating supply for BTCH now?

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I've taken advantage of recent Agama breach for study of BTCH realistic supply and major ownership. Due to security breach huge movement of BTCH happened. On BTCH explorer I've took a look at every single june block so far.
In my timezone first june block was 182097,while  last block analyized was 182554. Also I reviewed a destiny of BTCH balances, which directly originated from the richest HUSH balances. I'll post results in Word and pdf shape and also in plain text. But please note that Discord can slightly rearenge form and drop off some of characters.
At fork time there were 38 addresses of 10000 or more HUSH (BTCH). They were looked under microscope. Owners of the biggest balances probably should take the most care of their funds. They should be a good indicator of happening at the rest of the ownership. It includes feb. 1 2018 balances with t-HUSH addresses, original BTCH addresses and status.
Some findings are interesting, some pointless. The research has been primarly made for my own understanding of overall picture, but I can share the results. My intention was not to bash anyone or anything.

[11-Jun-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> As I'm missing data about transfer of DEX and SUPERNET balances to BTCH chain, some conclusions are part of speculation. At some points I might be just interpreting things wrong.
From block 182097 up to block 182160 value transfer was basically 0. Block 182161 happened 1.5 hour prior to ca333's announcement of Agama security breach (KMD official channel on Discord). In that block team moved 265k BTCH of SUPERNET holdings and movement has begun.
From up of block 182161 until now, 1.5 million of BTCH were moved. Since blocks 182404 and 182405 were mined, there was only 1 transaction of 10000+ BTCH. That is 1 transaction in last 5 days. Right now movement is normal again, namely it is going back to basically 0. It is good time to draw the line.

[11-Jun-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Including block 182161, there were  5 moves which included balances of 100000 or more coins. 4 of them are sure in control of KMD team, while for 5th transfer I can say it is just likely under KMD control.
As said, block 182161 contains SUPERNET holdings, namely 265000 of coins.
Block 182175 represent old MSHARK funds, it carried 100000 of coins. Block was recorded 2 hours after ca333's announcement.

[11-Jun-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Block 182184 had 153000 BTCH inside. These coins originated from pre-airdrop (18th january 2018). We are talking about original address. It can only be premine, now called dev funds. Block was recorded 2.5 hours after ca333's announcement.
Block 182190 happened 3.5 hours after announcement.  It included 361000 BTCH, which originated from SUPERNET and DEX. Add that with block time and my conclusion is: these funds are also in control of KMD team.
So far there are already 879000 of BTCH within KMD command.
At blocks 182251 and 182252 additional 28000 BTCH were transferred to 361000 bulk. KMD sum is already at 900000+ BTCH.

[11-Jun-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Block 182383 was recorded much later (06.06.2019). There were 192000 BTCH within. According to atomicexplorer, this BTCH is coinsiquence of 180000 DEX and 12000 SUPERNET. In chaos funds were likely forgotten and claimed day later. It is very likely these funds are property of KMD people.
So that leaves me with 0.9 M or 1.1M of BTCH whale addresses within KMD control. The second of the two is more likely. Of course, some other (smaller) balances are also of KMD people, but I haven't dug deeper.

[11-Jun-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Interesingly, balances of 10000 or more BTCH and without proof or clear indication of KMD ownership were very scarce. There were only 13 of them so far:
 block 182185 had 23300 coins (which happened just a single block after transfer of 153000 coins)
182195 had 10600 of them,
182245 had 20000,
182261 had 13200,
182299 had 22500,
182331 had 11500,
182340 had 15400,
182365 had 12700,
182391 had 28500,
182399 had 15800,
182404 had 19900,
182405 had 15000 and
182535 had 21300.

[11-Jun-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> All 13 balances combined for 229700 BTCH. That means that balances of less than 10000 BTCH leave us with only roughly 150000 BTCH.



Conclusion 1:
I've underestimated the amount of BTCH under KMD ownership and the amount of claimed BTCH. KMD controls more than 1M of coins, while overall I can describe 1.5M of coins as active. However, there are probably another 0.5M of coins which were claimed earlier, especially in early 2018. So with term circulating supply I would describe 1.5M or 2M BTCH. Coins are heavily loaded on only a few addresses, addresses with middle-to-low amounts represent the minority of overall balance.

(##)‚Ä¶ addresses shared by same entity. Transfered to same address. With other minor balances combined for 50000 BTCH. Active in august 2018. No. 1 candidate for massive Coinexchange selloff, which happened the same day as transaction occured (aug. 10 2018). It was biggest daily selloff/volume in BTCH history, both fiat or BTCH measured.
(###)‚Ä¶ send to Coinexchange and sold the same day. Now ¬ªowned¬´ by Coinexchange or their users.

[11-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> (####)‚Ä¶ when BTCH market opened on Coinexchange, claimed funds ASAP. Very likely sent to Coinexchange and sold everything.
(#####)‚Ä¶ linked with KMD. Funds ended on R9JCEd6xnCxNUSpLrHEWvzPSh7CNXm7z75 . That account is BTCH whale, controlled by KMD.
(######)‚Ä¶ Cryptopia's balance.

Interesingly:
- almost none of the biggest HUSH whales has claimed his coins
- only a very few of HUSH whales have sold their coins
- not many of these balances could be described as active

[11-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Conclusion:
I've expected much higher % of these funds would be claimed. I can argue that the majority of BTCH out there is mainly of DEX and SUPERNET origin. I can barely name BTCH as HUSH's fork or airdrop.
That could explain why HUSH community doesn't care about BTCH. It has never cared and I can't blame them for that. HUSH has been seen as a coin for private messanging, while BTCH is without a vision. Maybe HUSH and BTCH development/community should split apart.

[11-Jun-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> One could argue that other than "free money", many people never cared about BTCH (especially after the price dropped) ü§∑üèΩ
