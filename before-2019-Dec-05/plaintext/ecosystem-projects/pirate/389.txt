[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> much praised wasabi mixing at its finest, tracking down both the source and destination of funds. if this illustration doesnt kill the wasabi usage, it seems it is not based on the tech: https://medium.com/@ErgoBTC/tracking-the-plustoken-whale-attempted-bitcoin-laundering-and-its-impact-on-wasabi-wallet-787c0d240192

[09-Nov-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> next time anybody asks how good wasabi (and any other mixers) work, the above article shows it works great for the side wanting to track source, destination and balances

[09-Nov-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> at least that would be really cool

[09-Nov-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> It sounded far fecthed when we first discussed it

[09-Nov-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> then it it didnt the more house talked with Mel (Fesival Director and Council Woman)

[09-Nov-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> and now after the meetings they had there, seems  a very realistic possibility! 
Just the being the festival currency alone is amazing!

[09-Nov-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> gotta start somewhere. eventually there will be a lot of value stored in privacy coins, might as well be the one with the best tech. if we can get to where PIRATE is the answer whenever someone in the caymans asks their financial advisor what is the most private way to store wealth, then it seems a good achievement

[09-Nov-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <joe2x4> It would be interesting if it was possible to send message via blockchain to the address that has those 20,000 BTC (plustoken) tell them to use pirate.

[09-Nov-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> Absolutely Jl, that might be very soon. Locals are EXCITED about it.  There really are lots of investors around.... hanging out at a Pirate Festival. 🦜🎉🙌

Wolf has even been able to break down the tech to people who knew very very little about crypto, furthering the reach of adoption.

[dscrd-prt] <PaddedLA> I have someone that want to pay me $40 through their bank and they don’t know how to do crypto or anything. Is their an easy way to have them pay me in ARRR the same day, instead of Cash? Without taking days of exsplaning or verification processes? What the easiest way you can think of to change $40 for ARRR the same day?

[10-Nov-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> Don't think there is any (easy) way to do that same day.

[10-Nov-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `What the easiest way you can think of to change $40 for ARRR the same day?`
give me $40 and I'll give you 1 ARRR
easy and 1 day

[10-Nov-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> jokes aside:
If you want someone that isn't in crypto to get in crypto then you (or someone else) is going to have to walk them through the entire process of getting into it
They didn't just wake up one day and know exactly how USD worked either, it had to be taught to them

[10-Nov-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <wolf || pirate.black ||> Yup, it's a process, it's not good for us to just give them coins they may easily lose or not use correctly.

[10-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <wolf || pirate.black ||> You have to really want to teach them

PIRATE exited with code 1, crashed?

[10-Nov-19 10:07 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I reindexed pirate and then after that every time I open agama it now says this ^ only way I get it to run is by reinidexing and that takes about 10-12 hours

[10-Nov-19 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> bobot, windows most likely corrupted your wallet

[10-Nov-19 10:18 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
any way around having to reindex ? takes so long

[10-Nov-19 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> reindex usually fixes it. if it doesn't, export ALL your private keys once it loads, save them carefully, stop wallet.. rename `wallet.dat` in `%AppData%\Komodo\Pirate` if you are on windows to `wallet.dat.bak`, restart wallet and import the private keys you saved in the beginning

[10-Nov-19 10:29 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
