Yes but we know the crypto market standards, I mean you buy  coffee today, and maybe tomorrow the same amount is worth half or double. Most people outside of crypto think it's unusable because of this.

[05-Oct-18 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so?

[05-Oct-18 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as crypto prices are up in the long term, people who have crypto will have more purchasing power and as long as purchases can be made, that is what matters

[05-Oct-18 06:27 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
So, I think if somehow there was a way to add stability with an algorithm, it could be be used much more.

[05-Oct-18 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
commodities dont work that way. try stabilizing the price of oil

people can choose to have whatever currencies or assets and their values fluctuate relative to each other

[05-Oct-18 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
fiat prices are always changing

[05-Oct-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
it just seems that is it stable as all the major fiat currencies are inflating in sync with each other

[05-Oct-18 06:30 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Yes, nothing is stable, not even gold etc, but they are relatively stable, they don't really double in price the way crypto does

[05-Oct-18 06:30 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
(I mean in a short time)

[05-Oct-18 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
well, before we make PIRATE price stable, i want to to unstably multiply in price a lot

[05-Oct-18 06:31 PM] 0x03#8822
yes please

[05-Oct-18 06:31 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
ahah, yes I know, I mean it's great for early adopters

but if you want to build something really useful that can change the world, I think it would need some stability

[05-Oct-18 06:32 PM] xRobeSx#5136
`I think if somehow there was a way to add stability with an algorithm` you're talking about trading bots

[05-Oct-18 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
after it achieves 100 billion marketcap, I will work on making it stable

[05-Oct-18 06:33 PM] xRobeSx#5136
once the market and userbase grows, the market will stabilize

[05-Oct-18 06:33 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
that's another possibility yes

[05-Oct-18 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
you are making an issue out of a non-issue

[05-Oct-18 06:34 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
it's not an issue really, it's a thought. If you build something, it should be useful and used, not just good for a few early buyers or for trading

[05-Oct-18 06:35 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
At least that's how I see it, but you have every right to think differently

[05-Oct-18 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing stops a million people from buying PIRATE

[05-Oct-18 06:36 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Useful and used comes with users. I would argue even BTC isn't very used or useful. That's why it's not mainstream yet

[05-Oct-18 06:36 PM] 0x03#8822
what about the 'binary coins' in terms of hoping to add stability like verium reserve and... the other one

[05-Oct-18 06:36 PM] 0x03#8822
(noob question as usual)

[05-Oct-18 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
asking for PIRATE to solve what BTC hasnt solved. that seems quite a tall request

[05-Oct-18 06:36 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
yes, that's why I said it's not easy.

[05-Oct-18 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, using two coins, one to absorb the volatility is one way to do it

[05-Oct-18 06:39 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
But if someone managed to add some stability to the best privacy coin, that would be amazing. And yes when I said algorithm, they use bots to keep the price stable, that's what I read, unless the coin is backed by real money or gold

[05-Oct-18 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
that changes the coin into tokens of what is "stabilizing" it

[05-Oct-18 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
if you just want tokenized gold, fiat, trees, etc. just use assets CC

[05-Oct-18 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
though I guess I need to implement some way to bind it to the coin, then zaddrs will be possible

[05-Oct-18 06:40 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
but none of the stable coins have privacy, quite the opposite, they all have kyc etc

[05-Oct-18 06:41 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@D2D privacyalternatives.com market stabilizes prices by itself when correct valuation happens

[05-Oct-18 06:41 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
at least the new ones coming

[05-Oct-18 06:41 PM] Acura#2748
@D2D privacyalternatives.com Pirate is only few weeks old, give it time to growth

[05-Oct-18 06:41 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
stabilizing prices = communism, socialism ...  highly regulated market -> artificial -> not natural -> dead

[05-Oct-18 06:42 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I think it's a great project, but was just trying to imagine it used in the future

[05-Oct-18 06:42 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
you are talking against nature

[05-Oct-18 06:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it's alrady used - people trading it :pirate:

[05-Oct-18 06:43 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
on a practical level, for every day things

[05-Oct-18 06:43 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
as a currency

[05-Oct-18 06:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
next century

[05-Oct-18 06:44 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
get hibernated

[05-Oct-18 06:44 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
No problem

[05-Oct-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, I think I can make a price stable 100% zaddr coin

[05-Oct-18 06:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
kill it to zero ? :pirate:

[05-Oct-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it would require some special gateway

[05-Oct-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and some changes to mining

[05-Oct-18 06:46 PM] xRobeSx#5136
IMO stabilizing any market requires controlling the people buying and selling. As you said before, even gold isn't stable. Even "stablecoins" aren't stable because the USD supposedly backing it surely isn't stable.

[05-Oct-18 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it wouldnt be any normal coin

[05-Oct-18 06:46 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
market will do it without any changes needed when times comes, just naturally evolving

[05-Oct-18 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it would just be a fiat backed asset

[05-Oct-18 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
that has a dedicated zaddr coin

[05-Oct-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
would immediately be called totally illegal

[05-Oct-18 06:47 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I think it could be a hit, because people want stability but also privacy, and nothing like this exists yet

[05-Oct-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it can use gateways CC

[05-Oct-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
that type of method

[05-Oct-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
so it isnt a freely trading coin

[05-Oct-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
just a coin that represents deposited fiat (gold, whatever)

[05-Oct-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
and this coin would have zaddr

[05-Oct-18 06:49 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@jl777c are you talking about a -ac_private=1 assetchain that its somehow linked to USDT or something similar in a MGW type situation. Where you'd transfer USDT over to the USDPrivate chain?

[05-Oct-18 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
something like that

[05-Oct-18 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
but since taddr dont work neither does CC, so probably need to use mining to create the coins and a special burn to withdraw

[05-Oct-18 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
not impossible, but a lot of work for something i dont think would be so much used

[05-Oct-18 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
all these variants would need a trusted gateway

[05-Oct-18 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
if to use a USD coin, then I guess there could be two chains, one with the CC and gateway and the other that is a special 1:1 pegged zaddr only version

[05-Oct-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
like i said, possible, but a lot of work

[05-Oct-18 06:53 PM] scubapanda#2485
If you have 10-100m in verified gold you could launch a 'stable' coin on what ever chain. The issue might have to do with trust and the fact how one can withdraw the gold if they would choose that.

[05-Oct-18 06:55 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I think with the new stable coins and the "cashless society" we are moving to a society with less privacy. With cash, people still have some privacy now. So there will be a demand I think for an alternative

[05-Oct-18 06:55 PM] xRobeSx#5136
most of the big U.S. exchanges would go bust if people wanted to withdraw their gold 😂

[05-Oct-18 06:56 PM] scubapanda#2485
ok

[05-Oct-18 06:56 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
DGX (Digix Gold Token) is an interesting project as it's backed by gold. But obviously it's not a privacy coin

[05-Oct-18 06:59 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and who is actually keeping eye on reserves? it's not trustless system in such case ?

[05-Oct-18 07:12 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
It's on the Ethereum blockchain. But yes you are right, to have that stability it relies on a company

[05-Oct-18 07:12 PM] CHMEX#0686
PIRATE is about at 5% of ZEC hash rate now

[05-Oct-18 07:17 PM] scubapanda#2485
With the daily hashrate growth of about 10-15% we will be 10% very soon 😃

[05-Oct-18 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
and this goes against any stabilization

[05-Oct-18 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
as anything that is price stable should also be hash stable

[05-Oct-18 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why the only way to have a price stable coin is for it to be a pegged asset coin that can be redeemed

[05-Oct-18 07:18 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
so the best way would be for the coin to reach some sort of stability organically with the market

[05-Oct-18 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
at a big enough scale it will be hard for it do be changing in value so fast

[05-Oct-18 07:20 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
that makes sense

[05-Oct-18 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
the fact PIRATE is rising in value so fast is that is like a cork that is in deep waters

[05-Oct-18 07:21 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
yes, it just started it's normal

[05-Oct-18 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
the difference between where it is and where its equilibrium is a big distance

[05-Oct-18 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
ones it "surfaces" then it will do the more normal up and down waves action

[05-Oct-18 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
from what I am seeing as long as the hashrate keeps its gradual increasing, PIRATE is soon the #2 equihash coin by hashrate

[05-Oct-18 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
all this before being on any miningsite, let along exchange

[05-Oct-18 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
I believe it is unprecedented

[05-Oct-18 07:22 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
they say Bitcoin's price might also become more stable in the future

[05-Oct-18 07:22 PM] crumb#2550
@D2D privacyalternatives.com why do you keep bangin' on about the stability. we get your point, you want more people to use it. so when you sell something for pirate-s, try to pay for your inputs also in pirates. skip the conversions. simple.
this will come with enough time passing and increasing adoption. so be patient. 
this 'stable' coin thing is something that does not need solving right now

[05-Oct-18 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
