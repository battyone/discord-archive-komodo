[30-Aug-18 10:03 PM] SHossain#0007
i didn't bring beasts in yet as i was waiting for more miners to join. so, there will be a level playing field

[30-Aug-18 10:03 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[30-Aug-18 10:05 PM] SHossain#0007
that would be nice

[30-Aug-18 10:05 PM] SHossain#0007
small miners can join forces

[30-Aug-18 10:09 PM] SHossain#0007
we need an honest operator

[30-Aug-18 10:10 PM] SHossain#0007
do you want to operate a pool?

[30-Aug-18 10:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
current viewing keys, yes

[30-Aug-18 10:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
next gen viewing keys for Sapling can do both

[30-Aug-18 10:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD has sprout viewkeys, which are incoming-only

[30-Aug-18 10:11 PM] dukeleto#7326

solo pool mining works

[30-Aug-18 10:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Plz keep engaged with BTT ANN to help ppl and point them to Komodo Platform.
BTT ANN is mostly like an advertisement for KMD in my views, showing KMD capabilities.

Hmm if there is a pool I may fight against minis :)

[30-Aug-18 10:31 PM] Mylo#8306
ha. mining went up 15x overnight

[30-Aug-18 10:34 PM] Mylo#8306
So what is the point of the PIRATE coin?  Is it a test or a serious currency?    what happens when it gets attacked by 200TH of mining to fork it.  it is not being notarized because it cannot.

[30-Aug-18 10:35 PM] Mylo#8306
bitcointalk thread should address the questions of seriousness/test.   To me i think it is a test coin.  Nothing too serious.

[30-Aug-18 10:35 PM] Mylo#8306
```To play with some community folks made a TEST Assetchain and named it PIRATE. üòÖ```

[30-Aug-18 10:35 PM] Mylo#8306
settled.  should have read closer.  just in case there are some serious ppl that don't read the ANN properly.   i don't have a bct account.
