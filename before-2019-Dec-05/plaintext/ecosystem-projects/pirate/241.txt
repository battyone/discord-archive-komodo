[30-Oct-18 04:37 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
yes seems they don't care actually about their exchange (no CMC Api), small volumes, kind of side project for them ?

[30-Oct-18 04:39 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
if they were for doing business = make CMC api -> more coins apply to get listed to be on CMC -> more volumes -> more money

[30-Oct-18 04:39 PM] Flexatron#8809
no idea, they did take the effort to add erc-20 and z-add

[30-Oct-18 04:39 PM] Flexatron#8809
that must have costed some manhours

[30-Oct-18 04:39 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
maybe manager of that is strictly tech guy (Server admin or so) / not marketing/sale guy understanding market

if you are technical you waste time doing some tech dev, but if you dont understrand business you just waste it, and CEX is business not only tech

[30-Oct-18 04:47 PM] Flexatron#8809
apparently they are waiting on CMC to approve it
