[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> is it morning already?

[22-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <joe2x4> Morning gents. I compiled a quick list of sites and organizations who value privacy. Instead of focusing on random PBS viewers or Caribbean pirate parties, it would seemingly make sense to  try to team up with those who are already lobbying for privacy. Privacy advocates maybe should be a good audience to target with the limited funds.

[dscrd-prt] <joe2x4> A main theme is "privacy policy" for your business.

[23-Oct-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <stealth> I sent some arrr to altsbit from agama wallet about 7 hours ago and no evidence of any transaction now. Balance emptied in agama but nothing in altsbit and no transaction number visible

[23-Oct-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <stealth> I def sent to proper exchange address

[23-Oct-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <stealth> Anyone know what I can do to check the transaction?

[23-Oct-19 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <CHMEX> did you get a transactionsid from agama?

[23-Oct-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <stealth> I did at the time but then it disappeared

[23-Oct-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <CHMEX> was it somethng like 8dfgjh7dzfghi4t57z78
or
optid-8458-3333

[23-Oct-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <stealth> Would there be a log of it

[23-Oct-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <stealth> I think it was more like the former

[23-Oct-19 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <stealth> 8dfg...

[23-Oct-19 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <CHMEX> ok that would suggest it was sent to the network

[23-Oct-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <CHMEX> if you know who to open the console you could run
z_getoperationstatus
Which should return the transactionid

[23-Oct-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <CHMEX> it can do that aslong as you dont close agama

[23-Oct-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <stealth> Ok thanks. Will try soon

[23-Oct-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <stealth> ok did it and the CLI says it was success. Must be a problem on the exchange side

[23-Oct-19 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> Write to their support then

[23-Oct-19 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> And include the tx id

[23-Oct-19 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <stealth> Thanks

[23-Oct-19 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[24-Oct-19 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Mantrack> do you guys use anything else beside Discord? I mean, there are more private alternatives, right?

[24-Oct-19 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Mantrack> to talk about ARRR, that is

[24-Oct-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> only telegram

[24-Oct-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> These communication channels are supposed to be public after all, i.e. everyone is welcome to join.

[24-Oct-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> But I'm sure many people are also using other programs to discuss stuff in a closed group, which may or may not include ARRR.

[24-Oct-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> I only use discord because Komodo abandoned slack
I've never used telegram and I doubt I'd be inclined to add another app for general conversations

[24-Oct-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> Telegram is pretty meh for larger groups anyway imo

[24-Oct-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Brobrowniz> There is also an option to link telegram and discord chats thanks to bots.

[24-Oct-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> bot links look like shit imo

[24-Oct-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zafer> elementary OS is best UI which is Ubuntu based.

[24-Oct-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <bishop> Unity was one of the worst things to happen to Ubuntu

[25-Oct-19 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> That is one reason I liked 18.04 better than 16.04. But I‚Äôm not a hardcore enough user to say why I didn‚Äôt like Unity.
