I kinda like the idea of onboarding doing its own mining, not only would that hash help a bit (granted a small bit) those selling for onboarding could sell for market and have more funds to devote to mining

[07-Oct-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
onboarding mining likely totally offsets whatever negative effect on price. it just gives whoever buys in an instant paper profit and a good feeling about PIRATE

[07-Oct-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
when you see the marketing tech that it implements, i think you will agree it will be a strong positive

[07-Oct-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
notice the usage of "marketing tech"

The automation process was well thought out and works wonders.  It would be a lot of work to make someone do alone.

[07-Oct-18 04:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Down the road, we're working on a way to make the onboarding page a portal for more people to access easier as well as something that is "fun" and brings people back for more than just onboarding.

[07-Oct-18 04:12 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I'm not sure what I'm missing with the whole "negative effect on price" thing other than price being massively over cost and needing a correction anyway. Even if onboarding cuts market price by 20%, no one that wants any sizable amount is going to buy 5000 small amounts at 1 transaction each, just to save 20%. (well, no one except @blackjok3r maybe, sounds like some script he'd come up with)

[07-Oct-18 04:14 PM] house#8741
you know the gamers 'll game it ... but you're right ... it would be a lot of effort

[07-Oct-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
if time is money, it wont be worth doing for anybody that is able to make money in other ways

[07-Oct-18 04:16 PM] house#8741
Face value, as a marketing strategy, for an interim period, it is a rock'nroll idea

[07-Oct-18 04:17 PM] house#8741
allllll the way up to Tortuga

[07-Oct-18 06:13 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Tortuga!!!

[07-Oct-18 06:16 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
What if instead of onboarding with some larger amount to all 100,000 people, there is some sort of contest entry. That each new person is given 1 pirate,  those addresses are entered into a treasure chest and a booty multiplier is awarded to select address. Fpr example, x7, x77, x777, x7777 and maybe a single x77777...something like that so the nboarding has teh same affect but with a smaller pool of funds overall

[07-Oct-18 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
dont worry about the onboarding. it is designed to be supply/demand neutral, but creates awareness and a not of new pirates

[07-Oct-18 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
without any cost per user acquired

[07-Oct-18 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
marketing tech

[07-Oct-18 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
$0 cost per new user

[07-Oct-18 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
that is something that cant be beat, and if there are some short term buy/sell issues on the otc market, well, sorry. the greater good trumps such concerns

That‚Äôs kind of saying screw everyone who‚Äôs mining is it not?

[07-Oct-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[07-Oct-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
the bid/ask spread now is very big

[07-Oct-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
this will reduce it

[07-Oct-18 06:44 PM] Dr Debt#0891
The idea of 0 customer acquisition cost is unbeatable

[07-Oct-18 06:44 PM] Dr Debt#0891
So that‚Äôs great for marketing

[07-Oct-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but it will be reducing naturally anyway with external miners coming onto the PIRATE

[07-Oct-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and small volumes are small, any self-respecting dolphin and whale will buy bigger amounts otc

[07-Oct-18 06:45 PM] Dr Debt#0891

Just weighing short/long term projections.

[07-Oct-18 06:46 PM] Llama#1330
you're a barnacle now, but once the price goes up you'll be considered a dolphin

[07-Oct-18 06:48 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I‚Äôm seeing hashrate go up everyday, we have about 5-7% of zcash hashrate

[07-Oct-18 06:48 PM] Dr Debt#0891
At least that was the figure last I checked.

[07-Oct-18 06:48 PM] Dr Debt#0891
What‚Äôs total supply on pirate?

[07-Oct-18 06:49 PM] Llama#1330
200mm

[07-Oct-18 06:51 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
~120M circulating in one year. That's an estimated $32M circulating market cap at current prices

[07-Oct-18 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810

[07-Oct-18 06:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
100 m after 7 months.

[07-Oct-18 06:59 PM] Llama#1330
where is that spreadsheet with the values?

[07-Oct-18 06:59 PM] Llama#1330
and what are the chances that the community can send you 2500 pirate to pay mcafee?

[07-Oct-18 07:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs going to.  It was a joke response I made to someone saying pay him 100k Pirate.

[07-Oct-18 07:00 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360

above llama

[07-Oct-18 07:00 PM] Llama#1330
oh lol

[07-Oct-18 07:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yeah youre close @ghost.in.the.dao kings .The next 7 months will emit 50m coins so 120m is a fair estimate.  Maybe a bit more after 1 year.

[07-Oct-18 07:01 PM] Dr Debt#0891
You want me to call him fishy?

[07-Oct-18 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
100 million after 9 months, then another 15 million or so

[07-Oct-18 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
so close to 120 million after a year, and since he said a year from now, add more to the 115. it is a close estimate

[07-Oct-18 07:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
üëç

[07-Oct-18 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
and if hashrate and therefore price stays the same, indeed it is in the $30 mil+ range

[07-Oct-18 07:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Dr Debt I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre allocating the kind of funds macabre would want nor do I think we want to go that route.

[07-Oct-18 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
however to do that we need an aggresive onboarding process to ensure there are always new pirates

[07-Oct-18 07:03 PM] Dr Debt#0891
It‚Äôs a shit show

[07-Oct-18 07:03 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Lol

[07-Oct-18 07:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Literally?

[07-Oct-18 07:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
üòú

[07-Oct-18 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
without that, it is very difficult to keep the hashrate growing

[07-Oct-18 07:03 PM] Dr Debt#0891
You‚Äôd do better with notsofast needacoin and mocho

[07-Oct-18 07:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[07-Oct-18 07:04 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Mocho is good ppl

[07-Oct-18 07:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Will hit up needa and notso here soon.

[07-Oct-18 07:04 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I talked to mocho about it earlier this week

[07-Oct-18 07:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have spent my first week just getting my bearings and infrastructure beginning to be built.  I still have work there.

[07-Oct-18 07:05 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Well if you need any help buddy, I‚Äôll help where I can.

[07-Oct-18 07:05 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Have a lot on my plate, but this is helping to fund the other.

[07-Oct-18 07:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We‚Äôre gearing up for an info campaign next, if anyone wants we could use some high quality info graphics on privacy coin comparisons.   I have a list on the public Trello board.   
If community wants to make them great otherwise we will be making them on our own over the next couple of weeks.

[07-Oct-18 07:07 PM] Llama#1330
I don't know much about the other privacy coins. If you made a list of points I could put the graphics together.

[07-Oct-18 07:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The list of points is the important part üòú

[07-Oct-18 07:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Looking for people who know or who can analyze the other protocols and their means for providing privacy.

[07-Oct-18 07:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That‚Äôs a good helpful starting point.   
It is important to remember zcash privacy is increased by the number of shielded coins in the chains... and they are at 7-8% opposes to our 98%

[07-Oct-18 07:10 PM] Llama#1330
I guess I'll do some research

[07-Oct-18 07:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
This is one of the biggest weaknesses in zcash, other than that... it‚Äôs damn strong. 
Pirate solved it by not allowing public sends.

[07-Oct-18 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the total number of ZEC tx vs total PIRATE tx

[07-Oct-18 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
once PIRATE tx is more than 8% of ZEC tx, PIRATE can claim to be the most private

[07-Oct-18 07:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
A number that will certainly have an increasing daily disparity.

[07-Oct-18 07:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We should have a ticker.

[07-Oct-18 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont think you can conclude that

[07-Oct-18 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
how many PIRATE tx per day

[07-Oct-18 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
how many ZEC tx per day?

[07-Oct-18 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to know that

[07-Oct-18 07:12 PM] Llama#1330
zcash is 3.5 - 4k per day

[07-Oct-18 07:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As pirate grows our ztx pool will grow too...

In that monitors the total number of ZEC vs ARRR shielded transactions?

[07-Oct-18 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so if PIRATE does more than 400 tx per day, then yes, we are gaining ground

[07-Oct-18 07:13 PM] Llama#1330
how can we check the tx/day?

[07-Oct-18 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
in debug.log it should display the total transactions

[07-Oct-18 07:15 PM] zatJUM#9924
Can someone please confirm to me  that a shielded coin is a coin that belongs to a z-address? And that a shielded tx is a T -> Z tx?
