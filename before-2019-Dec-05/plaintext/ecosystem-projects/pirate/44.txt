[25-Sep-18 10:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Just to check... Once I D/L the chain in the wallet above, I can add Pirate as a native coin inside Agama?   Or is there a separate step I missed?

[25-Sep-18 10:03 PM] SHossain#0007
just like any other native coin

[25-Sep-18 10:03 PM] SHossain#0007
once Agama syncs chain, you are good to go

[25-Sep-18 10:04 PM] SHossain#0007
You will find PIRATE in latest Agama and only can activate using Native mode.

typically a coin needs to be on an exchange before it can be listed on WTM, not sure about some of the other smaller ones but I would assume they need a price for the calculations

[25-Sep-18 10:48 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
I guess CryptoCompare does not require and exchange. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jC5rzzOsK0Mwhlr9A4eRv01km9u5IeRZjmWTGPeddDE/viewform?edit_requested=true

Does ask for coin relation so I wonder if a "dev" should submit?

[25-Sep-18 10:51 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
I am a miner though so maybe you should wait 8 months or so before submitting  this coin publicly üòâ  lol

[25-Sep-18 10:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the full value of PIRATE can only happen if it is widespread

[25-Sep-18 10:52 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
Yes, the full booty! But only after we have mined the first halving, lol

[25-Sep-18 10:52 PM] jl777c#5810
if just a few dozen miners half the supply they will have half the supply for a far smaller marketcap

[25-Sep-18 10:53 PM] jl777c#5810
if we get thousands of miners, then it can challenge XMR for the top spot

Too bad the PRT ticker is taken

[25-Sep-18 10:55 PM] jl777c#5810
it wont matter as no central exchange other than our own would list it

[25-Sep-18 10:55 PM] jl777c#5810
we can use PIRATE as ticker

[25-Sep-18 10:56 PM] bishop#9773
I'm just going to say it... the ticker should be "ARR"

üçª (3) pirate (5) 

[25-Sep-18 10:56 PM] jl777c#5810
I was thinking that too

[25-Sep-18 10:56 PM] bishop#9773
Looks available on CMC, not that it matters

[25-Sep-18 10:57 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
yeah I suppose the is true.  In ffact, for me it is the interesting part. Imagine a coin that challenges XMR that is OTC only. That would really shake things up  in a fantastic way

[25-Sep-18 10:58 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
@bishop  HA! I agree. "ARR" should be the official ticker, thats great!

{Reactions}
üòÜ 

[25-Sep-18 10:59 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
Especially since CMC lists the ticker after the name: PIRATE (ARR)

[25-Sep-18 11:00 PM] actionslacks#4072
Perfect

[25-Sep-18 11:06 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
I am LMAO. Pirate really has something to offer here. It has the potential of a fun  and strong community. It can offer memes like the DOGE community, only it will actually have  useful tech to bring to the table. It seems the crypto bear season is coming to an end and everybody is just waiting for the next big thing to beleive in. I am onboard, lets go!

[25-Sep-18 11:08 PM] Flexatron#8809
Lmao

[25-Sep-18 11:19 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@mountaindrifter I've already sent an email to Crypto-Coins and What to Mine about adding BarterDex as a reference for miners as well as a way to add Pirate.   @jl777c had a solution that should work so I am waiting to hear back from them.   I will reach out to the community if I need further assistance.

[25-Sep-18 11:19 PM] Flexatron#8809
Following closely

[25-Sep-18 11:19 PM] FishyGuts#5085

@FishyGuts  Nice! I have been through that process a few times so just let me know if there is anything I can assist with. I am happy to help any way that I can

[25-Sep-18 11:30 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
@webworker01  Nice! I see the "getting started" page still shows the old url for the startum, is that correct, or will this one work as well?

[25-Sep-18 11:33 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
So should miners migrate  to stratum+tcp://piratepool.io or stay on stratum+tcp://stratum.pirate.komodostats.com?

[25-Sep-18 11:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Should we call PIRATE mining pools Oceans?

[25-Sep-18 11:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It's easier toa TX to get lost in an ocean than a pool

[25-Sep-18 11:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181

ok shitballs, i just send 15kmd from reading the pinned message, wasnt thinking about how i will receive the pirates üòÑ i send it from a lite wallet. what do i need to do next? load up pirate native, and then?

[26-Sep-18 12:14 AM] bishop#9773
yeah, took me forever to sync it

[26-Sep-18 12:15 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
create a z address

[26-Sep-18 12:15 AM] Meyse#0952
ah apparently i already have it, mined 3 pirates some while ago

[26-Sep-18 12:15 AM] Meyse#0952
a z address

[26-Sep-18 12:16 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
z-addr balance is only viewable with a patch on one eye. Yeah, code is weird on this one.

[26-Sep-18 12:16 AM] Meyse#0952
do i send the z-address to someone here? to receive the pirates?

[26-Sep-18 12:17 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
@Meyse  This coin is only traded OTC at the moment. You will just need to make a post that you want to buy and hope a seller comes along. Not many people selling right now

[26-Sep-18 12:17 AM] Meyse#0952
whats up with the pinned message then? send 15kmd get 777pirates?

[26-Sep-18 12:17 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

ok cool good to know

[26-Sep-18 02:43 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
Been trying to get the creative juices flowing to get some momentum on a logo. There was a conversation earlier that the logo should not be a play on Komodo's logo. I agree with that as PIRATE is its own chain, its own coin, and the logo should be unique. I am wondering, what are some thoughts on a logo? What are people thinking in general?

[26-Sep-18 02:45 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
There seems to be a common theme in crypto logos, would be nice if pirate stood out and was a bit different. Obviously the logo should be Pirate themed.
