You all have spent more time taking about it here than I have thought about it over the course of a week 🤣

`with a sweetener of 2 btc`
so I get $13k for all the work and you get $250k? What about me suggests that I'd ever do something so silly?

[05-Oct-18 05:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm a miner just so that I'm **not** working for someone else 😛

[05-Oct-18 05:11 AM] house#8741
ok I surrender :white_flag:
No malice here Genie ... was just making a point about the associated cost of mining

[05-Oct-18 05:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[05-Oct-18 08:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jorian what you had thought when you executed that assetchain command ?

[05-Oct-18 08:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
😅

[05-Oct-18 08:46 AM] jorian#4555
hehe, i thought: 'who wants this really' 😅

[05-Oct-18 08:47 AM] jorian#4555

@jorian :D
and I kinda jumped in the ocean without thinking much of it's consequences, and hoping I"ll reach a shore, with good experience. 😛

[05-Oct-18 08:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
who were the first miners ?

[05-Oct-18 08:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I remember I joined hours later

[05-Oct-18 08:55 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
And here I am, joining in the year 2548 where you’ve built binance city with flying cars

[05-Oct-18 08:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in that mean time it had many blocks already mined

[05-Oct-18 08:55 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
You all joined in the Fertile Crescent days

[05-Oct-18 08:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think @siu - Chainmakers and some others were

[05-Oct-18 08:55 AM] 0x03#8822
i was amongst the first miners, i mined ~12 blocks with cpu

[05-Oct-18 08:56 AM] 0x03#8822

[05-Oct-18 08:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hehe... I was able to mine 10k with my server cpu, then it was too much competitive

[05-Oct-18 08:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I stopped

[05-Oct-18 08:56 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
😎😍

[05-Oct-18 08:56 AM] 0x03#8822
yea, i stopped when the fork happened

[05-Oct-18 08:56 AM] jorian#4555
those z9's pretty much mined most

[05-Oct-18 08:56 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Thanks ye scallywag

[05-Oct-18 08:57 AM] house#8741
Arrr !

[05-Oct-18 08:57 AM] jorian#4555
cpu mining isn't fun anymore when all those z9's are taking on so much hashing power so easily

[05-Oct-18 08:57 AM] 0x03#8822
yea, that was a very short phase during which CPU worked on pirate

[05-Oct-18 08:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was just talking and exploring the params wishing for a bitcoin similar assetchain with verushash and there came this already mining message 😄

[05-Oct-18 08:58 AM] 0x03#8822
oh god pirate on verushash

[05-Oct-18 08:58 AM] 0x03#8822
this would be another wet dream of mine

[05-Oct-18 08:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
A week later it was already too late to think of going back.... since miners had too much power put in to it

[05-Oct-18 08:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you want you can start one now 😄

[05-Oct-18 08:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have the params

[05-Oct-18 08:59 AM] 0x03#8822
who's in? 😛

[05-Oct-18 08:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not

[05-Oct-18 08:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[05-Oct-18 08:59 AM] 0x03#8822
see, cause it doesnt make sense 😉

[05-Oct-18 08:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[05-Oct-18 08:59 AM] 0x03#8822
PIRATE is there and is good

[05-Oct-18 09:00 AM] FishyGuts#5085
56 minutes seems like a long processing time doesn't it?

[05-Oct-18 09:00 AM] actionslacks#4072
How long did it take to go from 0-100msols?

[05-Oct-18 09:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
just over 1 month

[05-Oct-18 09:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think it started as an idea the last days of august

So at current trajectory we eclipse zcash in a month or so

[05-Oct-18 09:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if pirate will ever hit zcash level hash rate, it will be a major marketing on it's own by the miners indeed 😮

:realpirate:

[05-Oct-18 09:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the whole market will probably research how this thing came to existence and why it is getting so much hash rate

[05-Oct-18 09:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so how likely it is ? I don't expect that to happen, but we never know. it's cryptocurrency wild land. 🙂

Make no mistake about it.   Privacy coins are becoming more popular and we have the best protocol IMO

[05-Oct-18 09:22 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We will put together proper material for explaining why to the average user.

[05-Oct-18 09:22 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We will get wallets out that are easier to use (mobile)

[05-Oct-18 09:22 AM] 0x03#8822
a bunch of news headlines related to banks and countries will be enough

[05-Oct-18 09:22 AM] FishyGuts#5085
And then we will moon.

to elaborate on the 'why'

[05-Oct-18 09:22 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I mean explaining why on the tech side.

[05-Oct-18 09:23 AM] 0x03#8822
choose these you can counter with 'with PIRATE, this couldn't have happened'

[05-Oct-18 09:23 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The privacy side is easy.  We will just have a constant google news feed with financial privacy as the keyword.
