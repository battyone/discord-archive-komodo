oh i meant in `listunspent` the utxo with `generated: true` cannot be used for nota

[30-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Alright#0419
I was just thinking that the coinbase may be the only way to store arbitrary data

[30-Aug-18 01:10 PM] Mylo#8306
dunno...maybe z ->CC multisig ->t nota.   but i'm just talking smack...wouldn't have a clue.

It would be fun if possible to airdrop this 1:1 to xmr holders, they complain that optional privacy in zec is bad

[30-Aug-18 01:15 PM] Alright#0419

mined 1792 coins with 8 threads

[30-Aug-18 01:27 PM] CHMEX#0686
so its always possible to get less mining rewards from coinbase?

[30-Aug-18 01:27 PM] Alright#0419
yep

[30-Aug-18 01:28 PM] Alright#0419
undoing that now actually

[30-Aug-18 01:30 PM] CHMEX#0686
so if you claim less than the current btc reward would that mean less than 21m coins will be issued or is that number coded at 21m

[30-Aug-18 01:31 PM] Alright#0419
less than 21M

[30-Aug-18 01:31 PM] CHMEX#0686

[30-Aug-18 01:31 PM] CHMEX#0686
aha wonder if that ever happened

[30-Aug-18 01:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So no t-t tx

[30-Aug-18 01:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
No

[30-Aug-18 01:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But there are t addresses

[30-Aug-18 01:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Only for mining

[30-Aug-18 01:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is t-z-t possible

[30-Aug-18 01:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or if only for mining, one can never go back to a t

[30-Aug-18 01:38 PM] Alright#0419
I did send coins from z to t

[30-Aug-18 01:38 PM] Alright#0419
check the burn address

z to t ^

[30-Aug-18 01:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
So is that a bug?

[30-Aug-18 01:40 PM] SHossain#0007
that mines in the same block

[30-Aug-18 01:40 PM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c can explain better or confirm

[30-Aug-18 01:41 PM] Alright#0419
if that were my t address, I'd have to immediately send them back to a z address

[30-Aug-18 01:41 PM] Alright#0419
not sure it's a "bug"

[30-Aug-18 01:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Whoâ€™s t addr is that @Alright ?

[30-Aug-18 01:42 PM] CHMEX#0686
I guess thats fine

[30-Aug-18 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
it's the burn address

[30-Aug-18 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
null privkey address

[30-Aug-18 01:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Ok null key

[30-Aug-18 01:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then who is http://pirate.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RUx6gufG9VyvPD8LfRM7rkz5fvDeP9zuTh

[30-Aug-18 01:43 PM] Alright#0419
Could have been to any t address. Was just demonstrating that z to t is possible

[30-Aug-18 01:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Interesting

[30-Aug-18 01:43 PM] SHossain#0007
not my address @Hollowman9000

[30-Aug-18 01:44 PM] Alright#0419
lol that's not something you could easily do by accident

[30-Aug-18 01:44 PM] Alright#0419
or at all

[30-Aug-18 01:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So signing t transactions with the corresponding priv key wonâ€™t be accepted by the pirate chain?

[30-Aug-18 01:44 PM] SHossain#0007
that is the mined block. mined coin goes to t address first. then you move to z address

[30-Aug-18 01:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It does

[30-Aug-18 01:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
In kmd mining goes to t addr by default

[30-Aug-18 01:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
In Zcash mining goes to z addr by default

[30-Aug-18 01:46 PM] Alright#0419
can't mine directly to a z address

[30-Aug-18 01:47 PM] Alright#0419
zcash is similar to what's happening here

[30-Aug-18 01:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If this behaviour could also be controlled we could set that default to z addr ðŸ˜…

[30-Aug-18 01:47 PM] Alright#0419
don't think you can do joinsplits in coinbase txs

[30-Aug-18 01:47 PM] Alright#0419
really wouldn't want to either
