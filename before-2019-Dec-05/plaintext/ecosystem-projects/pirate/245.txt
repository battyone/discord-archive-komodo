For me ARRR solves ZCash's biggest weakness:

[31-Oct-18 12:33 PM] JiuCrypto#6900
OPTIONAL privacy only

[31-Oct-18 12:33 PM] JiuCrypto#6900
Which results in an overall mainly traceable ecosystem

[31-Oct-18 12:34 PM] JiuCrypto#6900
And is misleading for new users

Who fall for "privacy", "anonymity" and "untraceability" advertisements while the most txs are open

[31-Oct-18 12:35 PM] JiuCrypto#6900
@Flexatron yeah, very cool as well!

[31-Oct-18 12:38 PM] Flexatron#8809
I got an article coming up which also reinstates this

repeating my pro tip from this morning: when you go trick-or-treating today, choose the houses that are not decorated. you will be able to sack in top-amounts of sweets there :trollface:

[31-Oct-18 01:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We give out big bars.   Kids know now.  It’s always a mad house at my place.   There are two other neighbors who go as big as I do.    It’s great.  One ladies husband is a special effects guy so they have an awesome setup every year too.

Cant believe it has been 10 years tbh. Amazing how this monetary system created by a citizen has stood up this long. Proves the middle men are not required and we can manage without.

[31-Oct-18 01:36 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
anyone seen any main stream headlines regarding btc 10 year bday ?

[31-Oct-18 01:52 PM] JiuCrypto#6900
Question: If overall supply rn is 40 million and 20 million are circulating, where are the other 20 million? Can we read up on that somewhere?

[31-Oct-18 01:53 PM] Oszy#5734
Are you talking about pirate?

[31-Oct-18 01:54 PM] Flexatron#8809
Overall is almost 23M

[31-Oct-18 01:54 PM] Oszy#5734
Btc then

[31-Oct-18 01:54 PM] Flexatron#8809
Overall=circulating

[31-Oct-18 01:55 PM] Oszy#5734
fyi Pirate has Total supply of around 200 million PIRATE  and 22,961,152 mined so far.

[31-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Acura#2748
@Oszy TheBigCoin is a cool service, but if you order an item that cost more about 1000€ - you need to make a KYC on thebigcoin Service

[31-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Oszy#5734
Hmmm.

[31-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Acura#2748
i can prefer a other service for that 😉

[31-Oct-18 01:59 PM] Flexatron#8809
Bitdial.eu

[31-Oct-18 01:59 PM] Flexatron#8809
That's excellent

[31-Oct-18 02:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@JiuCrypto where are you seeing supply vs circulating differences?  
Coin supply is currently block height x 256.

[31-Oct-18 02:02 PM] Oszy#5734
i think he was talking about bitcoin

[31-Oct-18 02:04 PM] Flexatron#8809
That doesn't make sense

[31-Oct-18 02:05 PM] Oszy#5734
nothing made sense in that question 😄

[31-Oct-18 02:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I’m sure he wasn’t.   @JiuCrypto is a knowledgeable dude.

[31-Oct-18 02:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That’s why I asked where the info was coming from.

[31-Oct-18 02:07 PM] Flexatron#8809
Yea..

[31-Oct-18 02:11 PM] Flexatron#8809
Glad to have him around

[31-Oct-18 02:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
About 6 months ago he made a post asking if what we’re doing is possible and wondering if so why no one has done it.  
The dPoW was probably the final keystone yes?

[31-Oct-18 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[31-Oct-18 02:15 PM] JiuCrypto#6900
@FishyGuts Well, some days ago I read that current total (not max) supply is roundabout 40 million while circulating supply is a little bit more than 20. Was just asking myself where the rest is.

[31-Oct-18 02:15 PM] JiuCrypto#6900
Or did I get something wrong?

[31-Oct-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
wrong

[31-Oct-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
current total is height * 256

[31-Oct-18 02:16 PM] JiuCrypto#6900
Thx, will recheck where I read it...

[31-Oct-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
whereever it was is incorrect

[31-Oct-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
height * 256 is the supply

[31-Oct-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
no doubt about this

[31-Oct-18 02:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That’s why I asked.   That would be something I would want to amend or correct if it’s our data 👍

[31-Oct-18 02:22 PM] JiuCrypto#6900
Total supply around 40 million was from the bitcointalk ann

[31-Oct-18 02:22 PM] JiuCrypto#6900
What is this number referring to then?

[31-Oct-18 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
that was before emission was 5x, so the 40 -> 200 mil

[31-Oct-18 02:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Old data.  Will need to update.

[31-Oct-18 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it is updated, but maybe not made clear that it has been changed

[31-Oct-18 02:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
💪🐙

[31-Oct-18 02:25 PM] JiuCrypto#6900
@jl777c thx. But this rather seems that MAX supply was meant, right?

[31-Oct-18 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
yes max, unmined coins

[31-Oct-18 02:25 PM] JiuCrypto#6900
Afaik the term "Total supply" is sometimes used with another meaning

[31-Oct-18 02:26 PM] JiuCrypto#6900
Like circulating supply plus dev fund etc...

[31-Oct-18 02:26 PM] Flexatron#8809
Yea there's none of that here

[31-Oct-18 02:42 PM] JiuCrypto#6900
Ok, was a bit confused by that numbers and used terminology

[31-Oct-18 02:42 PM] JiuCrypto#6900
Thanks for clarification

I saw at "getting started" on piratepool.io  that username is my wallet Z adress right... The username is the same as worker name is MRR right? This is my first experience with mining so this sounds like so dumb.

[31-Oct-18 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
most people confuse the 2 terms
technically the format goes
`user.worker`
but you can just use `user`
and your z addy (for pirate) is your `user`

[31-Oct-18 03:58 PM] TheGemologist#6023
so technically the correct when adding the pool on MRR "workername"  field is (z-adress).(workername)

[31-Oct-18 03:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
correct

[31-Oct-18 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
part of the confusion comes from language barriers

[31-Oct-18 03:59 PM] TheGemologist#6023
and worker name is random so i can choose whatever i want, right?

[31-Oct-18 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
correct
