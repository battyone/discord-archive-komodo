Anyone here can explain me "PM" why i'm so wrong about supply/demand (computergenie's point of view) and probably most of yours also. Would be great :) thanks in advance.

[09-Nov-18 01:23 PM] BlockTech#6895
(I'm dumber than the village idiot 😅  have mercy)

[09-Nov-18 01:24 PM] Oszy#5734
@macwinny  use GUI if you are not familiar with cli

[09-Nov-18 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because, peanutbutter

[09-Nov-18 01:25 PM] BlockTech#6895
I know your time is very valuable (seriously) so i'm asking someone else ^^

[09-Nov-18 01:25 PM] macwinny#1922
@Oszy it wasn't working but i've fixed it now no coins or addresses where showing up so i did a rescan and everything came up

[09-Nov-18 01:25 PM] Oszy#5734
good 🙂

[09-Nov-18 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@BlockTech if you want 10k ARR and you know someone will dump it at 0.1 in the next 30 hours, will you buy it now at 0.14 or wait?

[09-Nov-18 01:27 PM] BlockTech#6895
I'll wait of course.

[09-Nov-18 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and there's your explanation

[09-Nov-18 01:27 PM] BlockTech#6895
But how could i know someone would dump in advance ?

[09-Nov-18 01:27 PM] BlockTech#6895
Because dumpers b'd umping ?

[09-Nov-18 01:27 PM] Oszy#5734
they always do 😄

[09-Nov-18 01:28 PM] Oszy#5734
don't want to brag but it's true and it's how i tripled my bag this week

[09-Nov-18 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`But how could i know someone would dump in advance ?`
red = dumpers dumping
green = buyers buying
the fact that 99% of all trades in the last week are red

[09-Nov-18 01:28 PM] BlockTech#6895
There he is, bragging about his bag again 😉

[09-Nov-18 01:29 PM] Oszy#5734
i am on digipri 18-20hrs a day i see what is happening 😄

[09-Nov-18 01:30 PM] Oszy#5734
we are indeed in a dumping phase

[09-Nov-18 01:30 PM] BlockTech#6895
Yes thank i'm not that stupid but without demand i don't see how the price could go up ...

[09-Nov-18 01:30 PM] Oszy#5734
low price can create demand and sheeps will fomo follow 😄

[09-Nov-18 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i don't see how the price could go up`
if no one sells(dumps) for less than 0.12, then there will either be 0 trades or buyers will start buying at 0.12+

[09-Nov-18 01:32 PM] BlockTech#6895
That's kind of a cartel but holder/miner cartels to drive the price up no matter the supply is

[09-Nov-18 01:32 PM] BlockTech#6895
And the demand is.

[09-Nov-18 01:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
markets don't work like grocery stores

[09-Nov-18 01:33 PM] Oszy#5734
haha i like that

[09-Nov-18 01:36 PM] BlockTech#6895
My vision of the blockchain market was to pink sun shining and rainbow unicorn. But that's like every market it's not fair but "corrupted" by cartels alike and bad wealth distribution. (Sorry for my vocabulary, i don't see any other word to qualify that) but it's still better than others market.

[09-Nov-18 01:36 PM] BlockTech#6895
(Because you've probably guessed, i'm not a native speaker)

[09-Nov-18 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by your theory, if I start mining PIRATE again and I mine 1/2 of the supply, then the price should double, right?

[09-Nov-18 01:39 PM] BlockTech#6895
Grow yes, double depend of the demand.

[09-Nov-18 01:40 PM] BlockTech#6895
But then you can fix the price when dunpers be dumping ^^

[09-Nov-18 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if the demand is the same and the dumpable supply is half, then price should double (by your logic)

[09-Nov-18 01:40 PM] BlockTech#6895
Let's say that yes.

[09-Nov-18 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_then goes back to mining so that he doesn't have to sell his bags for a loss @ 0.1_

[09-Nov-18 01:41 PM] jansako#3330
not double, just find a new equilibrium higher...

[09-Nov-18 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jansako shush I'm making a point :trollface:

[09-Nov-18 01:42 PM] BlockTech#6895
That's what i meant yes.

[09-Nov-18 01:42 PM] jansako#3330
😃

[09-Nov-18 01:42 PM] jansako#3330
OK, gone...

[09-Nov-18 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[09-Nov-18 01:42 PM] BlockTech#6895
But i saw he would make me say what i'm not saying so let's say that xD

[09-Nov-18 01:45 PM] dokrates#8987
is there something like a rich list of pirate?, i suppose no, because its anon coin :realpirate:

[09-Nov-18 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there is one, but it's only miners that have yet to shield

[09-Nov-18 01:47 PM] Oszy#5734
just what is left on T addresses

[09-Nov-18 01:47 PM] Oszy#5734
but you can't put it back on a T

[09-Nov-18 01:55 PM] Oszy#5734

[09-Nov-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i like dumpers, otherwise, I wouldn't have coins now` <- @BlockTech see my point yet?

[09-Nov-18 02:04 PM] dokrates#8987
what point @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ?

[09-Nov-18 02:04 PM] Oszy#5734
it's a long story you can read it back 😄

[09-Nov-18 02:06 PM] P3L3#1096
Only started mining a week ago when the price was .14 to .16 and at one point .24
Didn't have any to sell then, kinda don't have any to sell now (hodl)

[09-Nov-18 02:17 PM] BlockTech#6895
`while me as a buyer, i wish it to be the lowest possible to fill my bag ;).` <- @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  Yes I see it, that's also what i told i was doing. But when i talked about fair, i didn't express myselft correctly and i was talking about "pink butterfly market populated with unicorn shitting rainbows". 😉 
But of course in the real use case, you're absolutely correct, i understand it now.
If most of the supply is freezed by every holders/miners and they accord on one price (what i was calling kind of a cartels). Price will inevitably rise, that's the law of market because "manipulation" or "strategy", and supply/demand are then obsolete to dictate the price. And that's what you're trying to do when you say "dumpers b' dumping and stupid people selling at 0,1KMD" you want people to agree on a in your opinion fair price (that's legit -> more benefice). But that wouldn't be what i call a "fair" price. 

anyway, thanks for your time and for sharing some of your teaching skills 😉

I want 100000000% returns and I need to find plebs to dump on

[09-Nov-18 02:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Daddy needs a new pair of lamboz

[09-Nov-18 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
(1.20\*0.14)-(1.20\*0.1)=$0.048 difference between 0.1 and 0.14, if buyers will not buy for less than five cents more, then we might as well all give up now

[09-Nov-18 02:20 PM] BlockTech#6895
I agree.

[09-Nov-18 02:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As if we needed a thinner order book... 😜
#Crex24 is at the midway point.   How do I know?   They asked me to send them Pirate to test to an R address :trollface: - old habits die hard.

One of the **real** issues is ARRR price is still oblivious to anything
hash doesn't matter
diff  doesn't matter
supply doesn't matter
demand  doesn't matter
KMD value doesn't matter
BTC value doesn't matter

About a week ago I said “be prepared for a lull”.  This lull will last a month or two.  It’s very common for coins at this stage.  Especially when we have no metrics to measure against or pursue for adoption yet. 

I’m very happy everyone is picking up the ball and pressing campaigns.

I’m going to get a video or two made... one will be about “why privacy in crypto” and the other will be “Why pirate as your go to crypto”.

[09-Nov-18 02:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Then during all this I have at least one group of people looking into the trading post idea... maybe two.     That has to be a non pirate operated outlet.   I have two options right now and in fact, I may try to get them both to collaborate and work together.

[09-Nov-18 02:26 PM] FishyGuts#5085
This week I have been terribly busy with my real job and life.  
I’ve got a lot I want to wrap up myself in the next few days.

[09-Nov-18 02:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
- We will hopefully have the art this weekend @Hoffenbrau seems confident the first phase is ready to go.  

- The Pirate Lottery bot may be ready in the next 7-14 days.    It’s a discord lottery bot just for fun.   We will offer it to ALL discord’s to use.  

Do get ready to become a lottery shill.  😂

- Crex24 may be open by next weekend for trading.  
Excited to be on an exchange with 2M+ daily volume and with mostly shitcoins, we should stand out.
