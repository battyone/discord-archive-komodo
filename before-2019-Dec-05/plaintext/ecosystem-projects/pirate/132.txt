@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 And what I meant is that short time (10-30 min) hash rate for Pirate is 125-200Msol when it was down to 60 Msol a while ago.

[06-Oct-18 08:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, but "back" is relitive to how much time PIRATE miners stay on top of not being outbid

[06-Oct-18 08:22 PM] scubapanda#2485
Never mind.

suppose those unlimited orders on NH may have something to do with it?

[06-Oct-18 08:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL the one keeps upping price and nh will not give it any from the lower price 😂

[06-Oct-18 08:55 PM] jansako#3330
stoopid... just keep the order up... or could be his pool is funky & won't take the hundreds of connections that order would generate

[06-Oct-18 09:18 PM] mato121#5963
is 130.5Msol/sec ATH?

[06-Oct-18 09:19 PM] jl777c#5810
seems so

[06-Oct-18 09:20 PM] mato121#5963
Whats with the remaining 15 procent of coins that are unshilded?

[06-Oct-18 09:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Nada.  They will be 5% soon enough.  
Theyre just miner rewards

[06-Oct-18 09:21 PM] jl777c#5810
only 0.1% are unshielded now

Whoever was Rpir4tes... if you have evidence,  you can even send it from an anon account.  I'll pay up 😃

[06-Oct-18 09:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
depending on the miner/pool and time of day, 10k isn't that much 😃

[06-Oct-18 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
64 of them notaries, then the rest likely from mining

[06-Oct-18 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so PIRATE is now 99.9%+ shielded!

Shoot... I thought I had a nice rig but apparently, It's time to upgrade.   This lappie is 3 years old.  It has served me well.

[06-Oct-18 09:41 PM] wookie#7663
something I don't understand: I thought PIRATE is z-addresses only? Mining can only be z-addresses? How is there Pirate on a t-address?

`something I don't understand: I thought PIRATE is z-addresses only? Mining can only be z-addresses? How is there Pirate on a t-address?`
Your mining through a pool and the pool can only send z
If you mine on your own, you need t in the coinbase tx (just like your pool does now)

[06-Oct-18 09:46 PM] wookie#7663

[06-Oct-18 11:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@siu - Chainmakers What would stop guyX, guyY, and GuyZ from posting in the manual book that they filled 15 orders of 20k @ .5 each, thus driving up the charted price with no actual sales?

[06-Oct-18 11:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Maybe a system similar to a tip bot can be done?

[06-Oct-18 11:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So people whk have orders pending already have the coins within the bots address

[06-Oct-18 11:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Although im not sure how that would work with z addresses

[06-Oct-18 11:23 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I may be able to hook that up.

[06-Oct-18 11:23 PM] Dr Debt#0891
My boy auscoin made our bot tipsy. She’s pretty efficient

[06-Oct-18 11:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
exactly the problem and I've had a few sales that were z both for KMD and PIRATE, so tracking couldn't even be done via seller's KMD addy

[06-Oct-18 11:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Right

[06-Oct-18 11:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So there is no way to know balance even in a txid?

[06-Oct-18 11:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, that's the whole point of it

[06-Oct-18 11:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[06-Oct-18 11:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the entire point of PIRATE is you can't track someone else's doings without them giving  you their key (or at minimum a viewing key)

[06-Oct-18 11:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
hence "100% privacy"

[06-Oct-18 11:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Was just trying to think a way around it for chsrting purposes

[06-Oct-18 11:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But it seems like unless voluntarily users tell their trade volumes there is no way to know

[06-Oct-18 11:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd love charts and a plotted price, I'm just saying that I can't see a way to stop if from rocketing just because someone "said" they did x

[06-Oct-18 11:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
True

[06-Oct-18 11:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is a challenge for any exchange then

[06-Oct-18 11:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for any DEX, yes

[06-Oct-18 11:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for CEX, the challenge is just in payments in and out

[06-Oct-18 11:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Oh wait, but a cex cab have balances since they own the zaddresses

[06-Oct-18 11:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That can be then done with a tip bot style

[06-Oct-18 11:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
right and trades are all on a balance sheet in a CEX

[06-Oct-18 11:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Since the tip bot will own thw addresses

[06-Oct-18 11:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
now you just need to get everyone to trust you and your bot 😛

[06-Oct-18 11:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Nah, i wouldnt take that much responsability... im limited...  not retarded, but limited 😂

[06-Oct-18 11:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But maybe it can be done by community memebers that are more capable and trusted

[06-Oct-18 11:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's what they're doing in #deleted-channel but not in tipbot form

[06-Oct-18 11:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But tortuga would be an actual cex right?

[06-Oct-18 11:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ya

[06-Oct-18 11:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
