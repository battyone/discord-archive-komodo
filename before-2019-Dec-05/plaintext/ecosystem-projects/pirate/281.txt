Wait how do you even see this?

[08-Nov-18 12:22 AM] yorktronic#2703
@Oszy under transactions in the agama wallet with the PIRATE chain chosen

[08-Nov-18 12:22 AM] Oszy#5734
I've never seen anything like this in Agama for pirate 🤨

[08-Nov-18 12:23 AM] Oszy#5734
Mine is empty 🧐

[08-Nov-18 12:23 AM] yorktronic#2703
that's odd

[08-Nov-18 12:23 AM] yorktronic#2703
I'm mining it, so I get a lot of transactions

[08-Nov-18 12:24 AM] Oszy#5734
Only thing i see is my adresses and the balances.

[08-Nov-18 12:24 AM] yorktronic#2703
click on the "Transactions" button

[08-Nov-18 12:25 AM] Oszy#5734
I know

[08-Nov-18 12:27 AM] yorktronic#2703
it is weird that mine show as "public" even though they obviously aren't public

@webworker01 has done a great job on this. If you have any questions, hit me up, otherwise message webworker. I'm sure he has fielded a tonne of questions already.

[08-Nov-18 01:13 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Hey, so he did make it public!

[08-Nov-18 01:13 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
It used to be proprietary back in the day.

[08-Nov-18 01:16 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
@NutellaLicka, it is a pool for Komodo but seems to support asset chains such as pirate, yes?

[08-Nov-18 01:52 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
That is correct. The instructions give you guidance if you are making it for komodo

[08-Nov-18 02:18 AM] Steve10#5203
Mining question..I mined on piratepool and trying Polly now. The balance in my agama wallet is about 16 less than what both pools say they paid out. What would cause this difference?

[08-Nov-18 02:42 AM] Steve10#5203
Even though the wallet is synched, would there be a long delay between when the pool pays out and when it arrives in the wallet? Just wondering.

[08-Nov-18 02:44 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
yes

[08-Nov-18 02:46 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
I have a long delay too

[08-Nov-18 02:46 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
it's OK

[08-Nov-18 02:54 AM] damodar#8781
What is minimum payout for pirate pool

[08-Nov-18 02:54 AM] damodar#8781
Since 1 days payments are made abnormal

[08-Nov-18 02:54 AM] damodar#8781
Did payout increased

it's his trade i guess

[08-Nov-18 11:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I sold over 1.2M OTC setting whatever price I wanted, markets are no different
once the "don't care" dumpers get out of the way, the rest is selling a small % at a decent price

[08-Nov-18 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and tbh, 50+% of what I sold OTC was *higher* than that

[08-Nov-18 12:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
*100% when KMD goes back to where it should be

[08-Nov-18 12:21 PM] jansako#3330
Look, we all have sells placed at those levels (mine go all the way to 6k Sats). does not mean I expect them to be filled tomorrow. Same goes to the order sizes. I don;t actually know if the number DP shows on the KMD/ARRR pair is in KMD or ARRR. If that is ARRR, that is an OK volume, but won't be filling no 20k+ orders any time soon. If that is in KMD...

considering the exchange has just recently started offering ARRR, I would say the growth rate is pretty good so far

[08-Nov-18 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's real simple, if no one sells under a pseudo price of 20¢ then the price will **be** 20¢

What’s the exchange?

[08-Nov-18 12:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the longer the price stays depressed by dumpers and smarter buyers is the harder it will be to ever come up (not just ARRR, but any market)

[08-Nov-18 12:43 PM] AndrewK#3947
the more coins I buy, the less coins there are to dump.
