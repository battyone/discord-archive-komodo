Don’t worry.... I’m working hard on breaking down that wall, or showing everyone that the one we built is better, stronger, faster. 

Pay no attention to the man behind the orange and black curtain.

Fell asleep reading on XMR protocol last night.    😆

[10-Oct-18 08:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Isnt it like midnight where you are now as well @FishyGuts ?

[10-Oct-18 08:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
😴😴😴

[10-Oct-18 08:14 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I fell asleep at 7:30 reading and woke up a little bit ago.   I’m a pirate addict so I can’t go to sleep again. 😂

[10-Oct-18 08:15 AM] FishyGuts#5085
This was my favorite article last night.... all except how one of the researches was a zcash dev.   Wish that wasn’t the case.

@FishyGuts  I believe good marketing for Zcash and forks and also Arrr would be to prove - show you can praticaly track Monero. Until it's just theory people don't care. Until osme researcher or even better police will demonstrate a succesfull attack.

[10-Oct-18 08:20 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I think this is good for "crypto community " to actually make 51% and other "attacks" as much as possible to prove and show which solutions are worse, which are better and to point scams or useless projects. Might be even good to form a team for that :pirate:

[10-Oct-18 08:20 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
this would be a true crypto piracy 😛

click on the + in the inputs

[10-Oct-18 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i see 7 pubkeys for each of the 2 inputs

[10-Oct-18 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
that means one of the 7 is from the actual spender

[10-Oct-18 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
so for each of these 7 pubkeys, a statistical link to the two outputs can be made

[10-Oct-18 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
this is not theoretic, but right there in the explorer

[10-Oct-18 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
work backwards to the unshielded amount days, or the no-mixin period and it might be that it is directly linked to a known address

[10-Oct-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
sure, its better than BTC, but when there is data on the blockchain to analyze forever, the data is there forever to be analyzed

[10-Oct-18 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
here is a pirate z->z: http://pirate.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/a1d7a1a94f13590f9dbe3217ea7178c40704f11316360a533e706d797a64c035

[10-Oct-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
there are no amounts or pubkeys visible for inputs or outputs. there is nothing to analyze. only when there are taddr involved is there anything to analyze, so we get to see coinbase -> zaddr (let us ignore the notary activity as that is essentially an isolated set of activity)

[10-Oct-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
So we have something to analyze vs. nothing to analyze

[10-Oct-18 08:28 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so what for is tor added?

[10-Oct-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
that is for ip level

[10-Oct-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
so that way it is hard for people to know you are even using PIRATE

[10-Oct-18 08:29 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
where is ip written? not in a blockchain ?

[10-Oct-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
no, just at the network level

[10-Oct-18 08:30 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so some dns storage or? how you can actually connect dns/network with blockchain info ?

[10-Oct-18 08:30 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
meaning how ip can prove using blockchain ?

[10-Oct-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
the attacker can run a node and log all packets

[10-Oct-18 08:31 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok I see, so atacker can become a part of internet knowing your IP and historical packets

[10-Oct-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
so the ip address of someone using the network can be determined, in addition to correlating the tx a node is involved in

[10-Oct-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
part of the PIRATE network!

[10-Oct-18 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
that must be assumed is happening

[10-Oct-18 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
as it is, all they see is "somebody sent some amount to somebody"

[10-Oct-18 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
so really it doesnt tell them much, other than you are using PIRATE at this time

[10-Oct-18 08:32 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I think it's worth to describe and put a new not too long article on steemit :pirate:

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-Oct-18 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
but if they can also know that something happened at that time, then you might be suspected of some activity

[10-Oct-18 08:33 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so you need to protect IP only if Pirate network will be banned illegal

[10-Oct-18 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
or if you want your usage of PIRATE to be private

[10-Oct-18 08:34 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or if you got some special hardware installed you can be attacked in another way, spied or sth,

[10-Oct-18 08:34 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
get a mail trojan

[10-Oct-18 08:34 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or sexy photos of some nice girl on instagram / any kind of trap

[10-Oct-18 08:40 AM] Seko#7408
I'll read it through later, I'm busy right now.  If I have any questions, I will contact you again. Thank you all!!!

[10-Oct-18 08:45 AM] CheeseBaby#1954
So ARRR + Tor provides complete transaction privacy for both sender and receiver, privacy on the amount in the transaction and send/receive wallet balances, and network anonymity

[10-Oct-18 08:47 AM] 0x03#8822
and if you ask nice, it will pour you a glass of rum, too

[10-Oct-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, PIRATE on Tor is like you arent even doing any transactions that dont have any info about sender/receiver/amount

[10-Oct-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you are tweeting your transaction details, or your wallet is confiscated, nobody else will know

[10-Oct-18 09:23 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I `z_mergeaddress` , then sent some funds, and have been in `executing` for about two hours now. Has anyone else experienced a similar issue?

[10-Oct-18 09:31 AM] 0x03#8822
your cpu every now and then spiking up?

[10-Oct-18 09:36 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah, `komodod` is spiking my CPU %

[10-Oct-18 09:39 AM] 0x03#8822
it's probably still ongoing then. i remember users reporting in with even longer wait times

[10-Oct-18 09:39 AM] 0x03#8822
it will likely change to 'error' or anything else if it's fooked

[10-Oct-18 09:40 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
okay thanks

[10-Oct-18 09:41 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
ill standby to standby

[10-Oct-18 09:41 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The output of `z_getoperationstatus` now is 
`[
]`

[10-Oct-18 09:45 AM] 0x03#8822
now try `z_getoperationresult`

[10-Oct-18 09:46 AM] 0x03#8822
😃

[10-Oct-18 09:46 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
`[
]`

[10-Oct-18 09:46 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
😛 It looks like the transaction is being process i'm guessing. I have no funds in my wallet, and haven't received the funds in the wallet I was sending it to yet either.

[10-Oct-18 09:46 AM] 0x03#8822
neither status nor result lists it?

[10-Oct-18 09:46 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Nope

[10-Oct-18 09:46 AM] 0x03#8822
awesome 😛

[10-Oct-18 09:47 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Is that supposed to happen..

[10-Oct-18 09:48 AM] 0x03#8822
james? 😃

[10-Oct-18 09:51 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
damn pirates took my money?

[10-Oct-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
until you do z_operationresult, it shouldnt go away, so it should show in z_getoperationstatus

[10-Oct-18 09:53 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_getoperationstatus '["opid-x"]'
[
]```

```./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_getoperationresult '["opid-x"]'
[
]```

[10-Oct-18 09:53 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
They're the outputs

[10-Oct-18 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
are you 100% sure that opid-x is exactly the correct one?

[10-Oct-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is one that lists all of them ...

[10-Oct-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and they dont go away

[10-Oct-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least they didnt on my node... forget what sone it was

[10-Oct-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just used the help

[10-Oct-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and tried every command

[10-Oct-18 09:55 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
100% sure. 
Was it this one
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_listoperationids
[
]
```

[10-Oct-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will need to check one minute

[10-Oct-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
getoperationstatus with no arguments

[10-Oct-18 09:56 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Still nothing

[10-Oct-18 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
:S

[10-Oct-18 09:57 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
lemme start/stop the daemon

[10-Oct-18 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my node lists all ... either the coins were sent or not ... if the deamon is crashed/bugged then they didnt send, a reindex shoudl get them abck

[10-Oct-18 09:58 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I think I have an idea of what I've done

[10-Oct-18 09:59 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I changed the .conf file (trying to get nomp working)

[10-Oct-18 09:59 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Maybe that would have fucked it

[10-Oct-18 10:06 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Could someone buy pirate through atomic swaps say in Barterdex? I assume not.

[10-Oct-18 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[10-Oct-18 10:08 AM] That_Guy8#4893
anyone able to shead some light on pool config for payment processing please?
Default is:  ```paymentProcessing": { "enabled": false, "daemon": false },``` in the PIRATE.json in pool_cofigs

or should if be set like other pools:
```    "paymentProcessing": {
        "enabled": true,
        "minConf": 10,
        "paymentMode": "prop",
        "_comment_paymentMode": "prop, pplnt",
        "paymentInterval": 180,
        "_comment_paymentInterval": "Interval in seconds to check and perform payments.",
        "minimumPayment": 1,
        "maxBlocksPerPayment": 8,
        "daemon": {
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": 27486,
            "user": "USR",
            "password": "PASS"
        }
    },```

Can I assume it as 100 % zcash functionality available in Komodo? I mean Komodo with no public accounts.

[10-Oct-18 10:15 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Correct.  The only public txs are notary node checks and mining rewards.

[10-Oct-18 10:15 AM] FishyGuts#5085
You can buy on dexstats onboarding site pinned here or in #deleted-channel and you can buy OTC as well.

[10-Oct-18 10:25 AM] ch6ris#5240
soo. who's gonna man up and create the first pirate ship darknet market?  🚀

[10-Oct-18 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Been saying that since the start ...but as I said it so much, now I cant make it.. .as I will be the first person the feds come looking for 😂

[10-Oct-18 10:27 AM] ch6ris#5240
damn good point, guess I'm out too 😢

[10-Oct-18 10:27 AM] ch6ris#5240
or am I? 😂

[10-Oct-18 10:29 AM] ch6ris#5240

always wondered how in the hell people feel comfortable picking up packages from darknet markets ?
you can achieve bullet-proof privacy with some of these coins, but still have to send products somewhere
online services would be the most i would pay for, don't have the balls for more than that and i doubt i could find some n00b to go pick up the package that would not snitch once caught
