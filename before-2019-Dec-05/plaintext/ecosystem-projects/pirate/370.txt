[08-Jun-19 08:11 AM] ionstar#5362
Why is the exchange rate on the onboarding page relatively high compared to prices on the exchanges? Is this a matter of  "the price of convenience"?

[08-Jun-19 08:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CHMEX ?

[08-Jun-19 08:40 AM] CHMEX#0686
The price updates each 30 minutes and has a 5% surcharge yes.
I believe in this moment its cheaper than buying o  DP some other momenta its a bid more expensive it averages out over time... @ionstar it also has a referral program for up to 10% in order to be self sustainable it has to be a little higher.

[08-Jun-19 08:41 AM] CHMEX#0686
I also want to mention that webworker and computergenie have made this possible with tremendous support of work and donations

[08-Jun-19 09:27 AM] ionstar#5362
The difference is actually closer to 30% if I calculate the exchange rate on the onboarding page back to USD, and do the same with BTC/ARRR on the exchange.  I assume you're basing the exchange rate on the ARRR/KMD rate on graviex, which has almost no volume on that pair.

[08-Jun-19 09:27 AM] ionstar#5362
And thus has quite a large spread.

[08-Jun-19 10:55 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
The ARRR/KMD pair has had the most volume out of any pair for most of the time. The reason it doesn't right now is because digital price has closed KMD trading temporarily

[09-Jun-19 07:25 AM] ionstar#5362
Never heard of digital price. Tbh i never heard of graviex either before I looked it up yesterday, and only found out about it on coinmarketcap (which doesnt show digital price as a market).

[09-Jun-19 07:54 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah DP isn't on CMC yet unfortunately. Should be within the next few weeks,

Is there a lottery element on the onboarding page? There was ARRR available at 0.05, yesterday as well for about 30 minutes.

[14-Jun-19 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ionstar onboarding price is relative to market price
