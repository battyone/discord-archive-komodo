@radix42 - @miketout - @jl777c  - If you guys have any ideas as to when Pirate might be sapling ready for mobile or hardware wallet integration, please let me know.  
I have spoken with the CakeWallet team about our coin and they are going to try to add us when we can.

Is anyone else having this issue w/ARRR in the Agama wallet? I can see the transaction times when I click the "Tx Detail" button, but on the Transactions page they aren't visible.
