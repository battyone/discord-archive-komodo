@plazma How centralized is it for you if a notary is  only writing a Hash in the BTC Chain ?

[21-Nov-18 07:37 AM] plazma#1625
@Acura so the point we can say monero foks in debate that notary r not centralised but if they ask how..
Then what

[21-Nov-18 07:38 AM] ph03nix#3115
that's why documentation is needed

[21-Nov-18 07:39 AM] Acura#2748
What should be centralized about writing a hash value into the BTC blockchain?

[21-Nov-18 07:39 AM] ph03nix#3115
people don't understand and it's hard to explain

[21-Nov-18 07:41 AM] ph03nix#3115

it is a hard lesson to learn when depending on a decision to others for your own money.
either learn and decide your self and lose, or gain
or let others decide and then you lose or gain
in choice of easiness, people forget the possibility of what they can learn and where they can use that learning next.

[21-Nov-18 08:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
learned thing can be 1000x more profitable if the first thing learned goes to loss, the same knowledge can gain a lot more next thing or in other places.

[21-Nov-18 08:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
more than money making, focus on learning. and by side make money.

[21-Nov-18 08:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
money will come back if you know how to make it.

When sapling gets activated this project is ideally positioned to offer the first totally secure mobile z-to-z address private text messaging system. I imagine this could be huge if it could eventually be as simple as texting

[21-Nov-18 02:04 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
When sapling activate - a game changer

[21-Nov-18 02:06 PM] Godballz#9524
People could communicate privately without fear of interception, this can be done now but with sapling it could be made mobile and therefore more akin to traditional text messaging

[21-Nov-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
sapling alone is not enough

[21-Nov-18 02:07 PM] Godballz#9524
Why isnt private communication a large focus in crypto right now? It seems the potential could be huge

[21-Nov-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
there also needs to be zSPV

[21-Nov-18 02:07 PM] Godballz#9524
Sorry what is that?

[21-Nov-18 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
electrum servers that do sapling ztx

[21-Nov-18 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
just taddr sapling is a lot of changes as the signing mechanism is changed

[21-Nov-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so dont expect mobile pirates anytime soon after sapling

[21-Nov-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
we need for there to be a lite wallets that to sapling tx, which even zcash does not have yet

Something is starting to happen on digitalprice I received my withdrawal for ARRR! üëç They may be processing them manually? Got it! That is all that matters and of course hopefully the price will increase and hold whoever keeps dumping it ?

[21-Nov-18 08:57 PM] BlockTech#6895
It's a matter of time before withdraw is enable again. So an HoDler won't care if he has to wait a few days for the end of the maintenance. He is in for the long RUN. Better buy while it's "cheap".
