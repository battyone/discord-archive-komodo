[26-Sep-18 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
0.00001000 fee?

[26-Sep-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
0.0001

[26-Sep-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
unless it is coinbase, z_sendmany automatically takes care of these details

[26-Sep-18 01:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh nice, doing that with just full amount then. thanks 🙂

[26-Sep-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
well it cant create coins out of air... so if it fails then do it at 0.0001 below

[26-Sep-18 01:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I just filled full amount, and it failed as it was adding fee to that amount, next attempt subtracted fee amount and used the result number, and it's executing now 🙂

[26-Sep-18 01:31 PM] Hot#2427

[26-Sep-18 01:38 PM] Hot#2427

Hey.  Been seeing more and more talk about this asset. I'm still figuring out why I would choose this or JUMBLR...it seems PIRATE is the latest/greatest, so what good is JUMBLR anymore?

[26-Sep-18 01:39 PM] Hot#2427
oh it's exchange ok

[26-Sep-18 01:40 PM] Hot#2427

WTB 25k PIRATE for 0.175 COQUI each

[26-Sep-18 01:41 PM] NedBGQ#8462
so how can one obtain pirate

[26-Sep-18 01:41 PM] Flexatron#8809
Mine

[26-Sep-18 01:41 PM] NedBGQ#8462
ahem, and the "non-miners" alternative

[26-Sep-18 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
buy them from a pirate miner

[26-Sep-18 01:42 PM] NedBGQ#8462
good idea, any pointer to find any willing to sell

[26-Sep-18 01:42 PM] Hot#2427
what is a good price

It might be counterintuitive, but PIRATE and tortuga.exchange will help JUMBLR

[26-Sep-18 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
think about it...

[26-Sep-18 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if still unclear, ask how PIRATE and tortuga.exchange helps JUMBLR

[26-Sep-18 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Only because I know you want to say it...
how?

[26-Sep-18 01:46 PM] Flexatron#8809
How

[26-Sep-18 01:46 PM] snowdamn#2414
it's true

[26-Sep-18 01:46 PM] nasbats#7785
I have no idea what tortuga.exchange is, so I guess I'll have to figure that out first

[26-Sep-18 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
since PIRATE requires using zaddr and so will tortuga.exchange, in order to get PIRATE people will need to use KMD zaddrs, which increases the overall zaddr activity in KMD, thus helping JUMBLR

[26-Sep-18 01:47 PM] Flexatron#8809
Mind blown

[26-Sep-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
additionally once you have used zaddrs, they are not so scary anymore and more likely to use JUMBLR

[26-Sep-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
tortuga.exchange is the dedicated KMD <-> PIRATE 0fee exchange we are setting up

[26-Sep-18 01:48 PM] nasbats#7785
ahh ok. So I think I get you.  JUMBLR can be used as an onramp to aquire PIRATE, and helps spread comfort using Z addresses

[26-Sep-18 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is expected to increase the number of people who use agama native and zaddr

Is this official last update for Agama? Cannot seem to have separate Agamas (for Verus, Komodo and Pirate)

[26-Sep-18 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[26-Sep-18 02:03 PM] Keytothegate#8453
Stable?

[26-Sep-18 02:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
latest I guess is `d`, PIRATE is in `c`

[26-Sep-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
