I was just trying to figure out if I actually have an urge for some rum, or if it is just this blockchain. :rum:  üòâ

[13-Oct-18 05:32 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
I was sitting here having some thoughts about pirate. I keep seeing people in other sites shill pirate chain by pointing out that 99% of the unspent transactions are shielded. That always sounds strange to me. I mean, people can say whatever they feel, but it just seems irrelevant (mostly just miners acting according to the parameters). I would think it would be more accurate, or at least more meaningful, to suggest "Pirate is a blockchain with required, zero-knowledge, anonymous transactions". I would assume it would be more clear to somebody hearing about pirate for the first time. The requirement to shield the transactions creates the largest anonymity set, in that analysis can not be performed on various data-points found in other anonymity methods depolyed by other coins. In addition, true anonymous transactions (actually no identifying information) are different than encrypted transactions. :pirate:

[13-Oct-18 05:32 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
I have seen the transparent transaction chain rules come up a few times, but the concern is misdirected. The chain rules require coinbase rewards to be transparent, which increases the strength of the network's security in having an accountability of newly generated pirate. If the coinbase is never spent, no data-points are created to be tracked. If it is ever sent, it is required to be zero-knowledge. There are no transaparent, and more importantly, no encrypted balance data to analyze.

[13-Oct-18 05:32 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
The other transparent transaction rules are a key function of the first notaries to exist on a anonymous  blockchain which are a main component in one of cryptocurrencies strongest 51% attack defenses. IMO, having special utility transaction types that function transparently and does not weaken the anonymity set is just a none point of contention. Seems to only come up when we discuss the 99% thing as it raises the unfounded questions.

[13-Oct-18 05:33 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
Anyway, just my two pieces of eight.

[13-Oct-18 06:28 AM] Flexatron#8809

Click the three dots and choose ‚Äúget WIF key ‚Äú.  Save that in at least two separate places.  If you use USB drives put it on two in case one gets corrupted.

[13-Oct-18 07:48 AM] plazma#1625
thanks...

We have applications to be listed with three exchanges out currently.   For now OTC channel is the best place to buy in bulk.

[13-Oct-18 08:19 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The 42c wallet is also pinned in this channel.

[13-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Godballz#9524
Oh cool thank you

[13-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Godballz#9524
I will look into it further

[13-Oct-18 08:21 AM] Godballz#9524
If I have verus on agama 0.3.13c would I need to download that or update this?

[13-Oct-18 08:21 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@FishyGuts you may wanna unpin the logo submissions too

[13-Oct-18 08:23 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I don‚Äôt know about the Verus situation.   Best to ask someone more versed in this.

With your seed

[13-Oct-18 08:29 AM] plazma#1625

[13-Oct-18 08:29 AM] FishyGuts#5085
And pirate in native after that?

[13-Oct-18 08:30 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Activate coin button in the top right

[13-Oct-18 08:30 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Then pick pirate. Give the chain at least an hour to sync.

[13-Oct-18 08:30 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Then go to receive

[13-Oct-18 08:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Generate new private address.

[13-Oct-18 08:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Then next to the zc address click the button to save your WIF key.

[13-Oct-18 08:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Save it in two places.

[13-Oct-18 08:32 AM] plazma#1625
but now i m in pirate native full sync...

[13-Oct-18 08:32 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yeah

[13-Oct-18 08:32 AM] FishyGuts#5085
That‚Äôs fine.

[13-Oct-18 08:32 AM] FishyGuts#5085
You can run lite KMD and native pirate

[13-Oct-18 08:32 AM] FishyGuts#5085
After the sync you can get your wallet address

[13-Oct-18 08:33 AM] plazma#1625
i have saved both komodo seed with 10 KMD + funds and pirate taddress private key and zaddress private key

[13-Oct-18 08:34 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[13-Oct-18 08:34 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The seed is the most important.

[13-Oct-18 08:34 AM] FishyGuts#5085
You won‚Äôt have a seed with pirate though.

[13-Oct-18 08:34 AM] Godballz#9524
Are there mining pools? Not even sure on price, max supply, algorithm or any info on it. Looking now

[13-Oct-18 08:35 AM] plazma#1625

[13-Oct-18 08:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
