[29-Sep-18 12:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if that date is right, then that's nowhere near the right one

[29-Sep-18 12:55 AM] ch6ris#5240
I have a question is https://piratepool.io/ a solo mining pool?

[29-Sep-18 12:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no

[29-Sep-18 12:56 AM] maki#2419
@ch6ris  thanks

[29-Sep-18 12:56 AM] ch6ris#5240

[29-Sep-18 12:56 AM] ch6ris#5240
thanks Genie!

[29-Sep-18 12:56 AM] ch6ris#5240

[29-Sep-18 12:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
afaik, the best way to get the latest precompiled version for windows is to get the latest Agama

[29-Sep-18 12:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@maki

[29-Sep-18 12:57 AM] maki#2419

Looking to buy a few hundred coins. any offers?

[29-Sep-18 01:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't know of anyone selling small amounts like "a few hundred"

[29-Sep-18 01:05 AM] ch6ris#5240
yeah seems to be like 6000kmd for 60,000 coin

[29-Sep-18 01:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've got a couple lots left of 10k PIRATE for 900 KMD

[29-Sep-18 01:06 AM] ch6ris#5240

[29-Sep-18 01:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, in that range

[29-Sep-18 01:07 AM] ch6ris#5240
yeah im not risking 900kmd for pure speculation.

[29-Sep-18 01:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has risked a hell of a lot more than 900 on PIRATE_

[29-Sep-18 01:07 AM] ch6ris#5240
that was 10k not long ago

[29-Sep-18 01:08 AM] bishop#9773
Where we're going, we don't need roads

[29-Sep-18 01:08 AM] bishop#9773
just shoddy boats with torn flags

[29-Sep-18 01:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL I've spent almost $10k on mining PIRATE

[29-Sep-18 01:08 AM] ch6ris#5240
good for you, mistakes were made and I'm poor.

[29-Sep-18 01:09 AM] ch6ris#5240

[29-Sep-18 01:10 AM] ch6ris#5240

[29-Sep-18 01:10 AM] ch6ris#5240

[29-Sep-18 01:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's not even 2 block rewards 😕

[29-Sep-18 01:11 AM] ch6ris#5240
hmmm. dunno then.

[29-Sep-18 01:12 AM] ch6ris#5240
on https://piratepool.io do I actually need to find a block to be paid anything? looks very solo payout to me. sorry to ask again.

[29-Sep-18 01:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, you get paid based on your contribution

[29-Sep-18 01:13 AM] ch6ris#5240
alright thanks just the stats are very basic.

[29-Sep-18 01:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you = 1% of shares, then you get 1% of rewards

[29-Sep-18 01:14 AM] ch6ris#5240
hmmm, Shares: 0.32

[29-Sep-18 01:15 AM] ch6ris#5240

[29-Sep-18 01:16 AM] ch6ris#5240
134.77 Sol/s

[29-Sep-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
With a 256 block reward, even a smll amount of hash is goign to get your coine.

[29-Sep-18 01:16 AM] ch6ris#5240
guessing I won't do pretty good.

[29-Sep-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just remeber half of the total supply will be minied in 270 days since launch

[29-Sep-18 01:17 AM] ch6ris#5240
you guys are on piratepool?

[29-Sep-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so its kind of required to mine in that period. Thats why the hash rate is so ridiculous

[29-Sep-18 01:18 AM] ch6ris#5240
yep alright makes sense.

[29-Sep-18 01:25 AM] ch6ris#5240
I have seen a few screenshots of pirate in agama, how is that possible?

[29-Sep-18 01:26 AM] ch6ris#5240
