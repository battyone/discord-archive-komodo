[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> and it is very crypto-friendly

[02-Dec-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> indeed .. Switzerland is a good option - but also expensive, and a bit buraucratic

[02-Dec-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> but you do need money

[02-Dec-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> frined of mine been living there for 10 or 12 years now - and also working.. if you have 1 or 2 million Franks in the bank, it is not so difficult

[02-Dec-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> why not luxembourg? üôÇ

[02-Dec-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> too close to Brusseles - no real identitiy, like Switzerland

[02-Dec-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> those Finca Bayano guys are a bit too off the grid for may taste, but they picked a really good spot for sure

[02-Dec-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> the place is ¬π 500m height above sea level, so : no mosquitos, no hurricanes, only 100km or so to Panama, always sweet weahter

[02-Dec-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Or you could just move to the caymans

[02-Dec-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> :pirate:

[02-Dec-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> true!

[02-Dec-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> meh.. can get nasty weahtwer there

[02-Dec-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> also, I am not so sure about affordability

[02-Dec-19 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> Paraguay has one of the largest hydroelectic dams in the world.. I need to do some more research, but it does look interesting

[02-Dec-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> if I get my stuff together, I'll let you guys now ! I am looking at maybe spending a cpl weeks holiday in Paraguay in half a year or so

[02-Dec-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> reading wikipedia, the caymans sound very interesting

[02-Dec-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> hmm... I'll include them in my research list

[02-Dec-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> what about dependnce on international trade and industry?

[02-Dec-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Panama has a lot going for it- uses USD for currency, has reasonable laws, safe from hurricanes, good weather, still some privacy. But honestly it‚Äôs not the best anymore; I‚Äôm not sure what is.  For U.S. citizens Puerto Rico offers a huge tax haven that is appealing to crypto users if they have/make enough..

[02-Dec-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> After that, the SA countries have some government issues with either instability or human rights

[02-Dec-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> But Uruguay is def a possibility for many people.

[02-Dec-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> And Paraguay

[02-Dec-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> in Paraguay it is possible to get a permanent residence permit for a few thousand dollars - not sure the exact amount, I think 2-3k$ per person

[02-Dec-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> you have to grease the skids a little bit by using a local service provider, but it is not outrageous- this kind os small scale corruption pales in comparison to the gargantuan systemic corruption we see e.g. in EU countries

[02-Dec-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> :rum:

[02-Dec-19 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> I agree with what you mean about "greasing the skids"

[02-Dec-19 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> I'd rather pay some guy $10 to "fill out the forms" for me to make it "go faster" than deal with bullsh!t AML laws and other invasions of privacy that are ripe to be used in abusive ways when cultural changes create law changes

[02-Dec-19 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> 8-10 years ago I was really strong on the idea of relocating to Panama and getting the pensinado visa.  But even in those few years, things have changed.  "The Panama Papers" didn't help.. lol

[03-Dec-19 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> malta?

[03-Dec-19 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> I was on a 2 week holiday in Malta - nice place, but too tightly integrated into the EU, and very small island between Africa and Italy-
you can alomst spit over to Libya, which has become a worse than mediaval shithole since it was liberated by Clinton, Obama, Sarkozy and NATO in 2011

[dscrd-prt] <Brobrowniz> Hello here, I have seen a partnership between Protonmail & https://privacyinternational.org/ (London - UK based) in order to make a survey on "privacy". 
After digging a while and get caught by their productions, I saw some interesting articles & campaigns. I do not know if Pirate Chain has tried to contact them, but I was wondering if it could be interesting to collaborate with them to build a campaign - 'Empowering people thank to financial privacy' (just an idea).

[04-Dec-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Privatoshi> I'm not kidding. 
They locked me out and my $1000 crypto, for 30-40 days
