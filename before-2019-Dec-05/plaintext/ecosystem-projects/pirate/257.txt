did he give you the `z_getoperationstatus` results or just tell you that he sent it?

[03-Nov-18 12:29 AM] Philtr#9415
He give me a Foto of sending

[03-Nov-18 12:29 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Did the status show pending or executed?   You will want the z_getoperationstatus

[03-Nov-18 12:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If I give you a photo of a truckload of gold, will you believe that truck is on its way to you?

[03-Nov-18 12:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blubbi unless it was you he was dealing with, you can't say that for sure, one way or the other

[03-Nov-18 12:40 AM] Philtr#9415
But it was the 3rd deal with him.

[03-Nov-18 12:40 AM] FishyGuts#5085

Also @twistedmind you’re looking at basically 1 hour of volume on pirate. Deposits were halted as the exchange is still testing wallets.

{Reactions}
💯 

[03-Nov-18 12:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
There are viewkey API to view a tx

[03-Nov-18 12:46 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So you have 20k arrrr posted and 4-5 k KMD trying to buy it.  

Pretty healthy volume for 90 minutes of trading on a new coin on a new exchange.

[03-Nov-18 12:47 AM] FishyGuts#5085
.5 btc in opening hours of trading.

[03-Nov-18 12:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@FishyGuts just ignore @twistedmind, he's more of a contrarian than I am 😛

[03-Nov-18 12:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Philtr if @blubbi is correct and you dealt with the user we know in here as @And1_89, then I'd say you'll be fine and he'll make it right if it didn't go through (bearing in mind those are ifs because I don't know for sure whom you dealt with)

[03-Nov-18 12:53 AM] Philtr#9415
I have an transaction ID

[03-Nov-18 12:55 AM] Philtr#9415
Ah ok. Maybe he write me tomorrow. Today evening he dont answer...

[03-Nov-18 12:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If it's the same user, then he's gone to bed

[03-Nov-18 12:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
bad part of the internet: your evening might be someone else's 2am

[03-Nov-18 12:57 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Philtr See if he is on discord here.  I am not on telegram.  @Seko and @Acura might be of more help.

[03-Nov-18 12:58 AM] Philtr#9415
I know Acura

[03-Nov-18 12:59 AM] Philtr#9415
I go to bed. Hope ARRR arrived tomorrow

[03-Nov-18 01:01 AM] Philtr#9415
the AgamaWallet must start if i want get ARRR?

[03-Nov-18 01:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
How much did you try to buy @Philtr ?

[03-Nov-18 01:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If you have a receiving address the wallet does not need to be open to receive coins.

[03-Nov-18 01:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Hope it works out for you.

You did great with that one.  I was impressed.

[03-Nov-18 01:34 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Is it being translated to other languages I assume?

[03-Nov-18 01:38 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Does anyone here play sea of thieves?

[03-Nov-18 01:42 AM] dyorguy#3319
What exchange is pirate working on now

[03-Nov-18 01:43 AM] Cryp_Toad#8327
How do you guys find an escrow?

[03-Nov-18 01:43 AM] dyorguy#3319
Also isn’t there a website you can swap kmd for pirate

[03-Nov-18 01:44 AM] Cryp_Toad#8327

@Cryp_Toad usually a colored named person her is trustworthy to handle an escrow if they are around.   We will also vouch for known good sellers to save you guys on escrow fees.

[03-Nov-18 01:47 AM] Cryp_Toad#8327
@FishyGuts ah thanks. Can you vouche for @Angel09 ?

[03-Nov-18 02:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I have not traded.   I do not know.  I can go fire up my wallets if you need an escrow.

[03-Nov-18 02:24 AM] AndrewK#3947
@Cryp_Toad be careful of angel09 - a lot of scammers with new discord accounts

[03-Nov-18 02:32 AM] yousurnayme#1631
Do we know if DigiPri is working to fix deposits? Or are they chilling for the weekend?

[03-Nov-18 02:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`a colored named person`
🤐

[03-Nov-18 03:01 AM] Cryp_Toad#8327
Thanks, really appreciate the offer @FishyGuts Just to let you know, he didnt want to use an escrow. : )

[03-Nov-18 03:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Angel09 why no escrow?

[03-Nov-18 03:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I know @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 every time I type it I cringe a little.    How else should I phrase it?

[03-Nov-18 03:04 AM] Angel09#8202
@FishyGuts I will escrow. but after 3 hours. I'm working

[03-Nov-18 03:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085

I know  this is probably not the right place but maybe someone can help.   Knomp  communicating with kmd daemon for pirate keeps telling me I don’t own the address but the wallet says I do.  Any ideas?

[03-Nov-18 04:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Laviathon -bcmonster.com taddy for the pool or zaddy for payments?

[03-Nov-18 04:38 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Private mining is t addr - pool mining is z addr.
