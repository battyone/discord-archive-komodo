if I never have encounter Linux, I would have never explored and made career in this FOSS industry. it taught me a lot.

[27-Sep-18 09:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I found and supported SuperNET in days where I saw many were discarding it.

[27-Sep-18 09:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I remember IOTA founder David calling me crazy directly helping Komodo not so recently üòÑ

[27-Sep-18 09:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I know, and I'm fine if that craziness help this project even a single bit

[27-Sep-18 09:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[27-Sep-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
in open source, if the code doesnt matter, then what does?

[27-Sep-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
crazy

[27-Sep-18 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not open source any more

[27-Sep-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810

[27-Sep-18 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
cant somebody just fork linux and start without CoC?

[27-Sep-18 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[27-Sep-18 09:16 AM] 0x03#8822
also, there was this 'it is so hard to contribue to linux' argument

[27-Sep-18 09:16 AM] actionslacks#4072
openBSD?

[27-Sep-18 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but then they will try and buy you too

[27-Sep-18 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810

[27-Sep-18 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[27-Sep-18 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was retorical i meant anyone not you

[27-Sep-18 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, you need to know how to code

[27-Sep-18 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
its so unfair

[27-Sep-18 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810

[27-Sep-18 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
doesnt matter

[27-Sep-18 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we need to change all usage of "short" since it offends the short peoples?

[27-Sep-18 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
komodo linux the new world standard in the internet

[27-Sep-18 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810

[27-Sep-18 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
lets just call all integers equaloutcomes

[27-Sep-18 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810

reassuring to read your opinions

[27-Sep-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
I am amazed how they politicized C code

[27-Sep-18 09:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think they removed "slave" and "master" from python because people found it offensive

[27-Sep-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i saw that

[27-Sep-18 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810

well, oracle thought, their 'processes' and experience with their DB products would work 1:1 in solaris land

[27-Sep-18 09:26 AM] 0x03#8822
that was their first big mistake

[27-Sep-18 09:26 AM] 0x03#8822
when it was sun, a RMA for broken RAM was a 5min issue, oracle made sure we had to put in like 30-45min for that from then on

[27-Sep-18 09:27 AM] 0x03#8822
considering most RMA actually probably was RAM and disks i still wonder how they survived requiring all the broken parts to be sent back

[27-Sep-18 09:27 AM] 0x03#8822
(to the USA, overseas, DHL express)

[27-Sep-18 09:28 AM] 0x03#8822
yea and then all of a sudden the expert engineers of oracle changed all service contract requirements

[27-Sep-18 09:28 AM] 0x03#8822
it just cost everybody involved a lot of money, and thats not even talking about software quality (which, regarding to people that should know, has gone to shit a bit)

[27-Sep-18 09:30 AM] 0x03#8822
one should maybe focus on FreeBSD. it can haz zfs and is a proper done unix
