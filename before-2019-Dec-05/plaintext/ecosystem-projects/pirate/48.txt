@blackjok3r wasnt PIRATE/KMD like 1/1 in the very beginning?

[26-Sep-18 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it started of by hijacking #private-staked

[26-Sep-18 07:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I wouldn't be buying again if I had enough left after 250,000 PIRATE giveway and supply increase 😄

[26-Sep-18 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IMO it should not have its own discord.

PIRATE:kmd parity makes sense, anything else would be some fun for day traders, but as a store of value PIRATE needs a stable kmd price, and the most stable would be parity. I think we might rapidly accelerate to parity, it's the logical value for PIRATE, can't think of a scenario where kmd survives and not PIRATE, or vice versa, so if PIRATE is the ultimate store of value, and we all agree an unofficial peg with kmd is an advantage, then the most likely outcome is parity, and could happen quickly.

[26-Sep-18 07:38 AM] Don King#8901
I predict a singuparity will happen eventually

[26-Sep-18 07:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
when?

[26-Sep-18 07:39 AM] Don King#8901
Once we all appreciate the benefit of parity peg, then it becomes a self fulfilling event

[26-Sep-18 07:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
Interesting but wouldn’t you need enough buyers for it to stay stable/reach parity? I can imagine the early comers dumping at a cheaper level and not many people need the anonymity of pirate nor buying it. I’d say 50% of kmd investors don’t even know what kmd does 😂😂

[26-Sep-18 07:41 AM] Don King#8901
And the traders with big cajones get us there, and the store of value users keep us there

[26-Sep-18 07:41 AM] Don King#8901
Betting on parity now would make some big profits, but if I'm wrong, well big loses lol

[26-Sep-18 07:43 AM] Don King#8901
I see PIRATE and kmd as two parts of the same 'thing' now, so it's logical they would move together, up and down

[26-Sep-18 07:44 AM] Don King#8901
PIRATE is to komodo what z tx is to t tx

[26-Sep-18 07:50 AM] Don King#8901
Market price is partly psychological,  and a parity peg makes PIRATE an unambiguously good store of value, so if we all start to expect parity it will happen. Goòd news for kmd is same for PIRATE , and so too for bad news , PIRATE and kmd are connected now, so an unofficial peg eventually is logical, and parity would provide a stable store of value.

[26-Sep-18 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
alll that would do is double the supply of KMD hurting both coins 😕

[26-Sep-18 07:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
Nah both will double. Magic internet money remember? 😂

[26-Sep-18 07:53 AM] Don King#8901
Yes, if people fomo into PIRATE by selling kmd then maybe that is the short term result, a balancing out where PIRATE goes up and kmd goes down. I guess time will tell, no one is engineering this

[26-Sep-18 07:54 AM] Don King#8901
PIRATE definitely adds HUGE ultility to the whole komodo ecosystem, so I think more likely PIRATE rises up to meet kmd at approx current price

[26-Sep-18 07:56 AM] Don King#8901
My point is PIRATE and kmd go fantastically  well together,  so we get some excellent synergy that adds value from having the perfect store of value hodl coin, and a peg is useful, and the most stable peg is parity.

[26-Sep-18 07:57 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
My opinion is the PIRATE needs to be valued separately. It is a separate coin. It has different uses. I don't see why it should be pegged?

[26-Sep-18 08:00 AM] Don King#8901
Any peg would be in the collective consciousness of the market, I'm assuming PIRATE is going to be used for storing wealth like an offshore bank account, Panama papers etc,  if it get used as a transaction coin on dark markets, then supply demand would take over. I am just speculating, who knows what will happen

[26-Sep-18 08:01 AM] Don King#8901
But an unofficial parity peg is possible

[26-Sep-18 08:03 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think it could pretty big. the fact it popped into existence right when bitmain started shipping the z9's to mine seems like good timing as well

[26-Sep-18 08:06 AM] actionslacks#4072
and the exchange is being built right now! this coin just serves to display the collection of talent and creativity under the komodo umbrella

$100 PIRATE is possible

[26-Sep-18 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
$1000 KMD is possible

[26-Sep-18 08:11 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah, well if we hit $1000 can we launch some cube sats?

[26-Sep-18 08:11 AM] Don King#8901
PIRATE will attract miners into komodo now, and many will learn what jl777 has been doing all these years for the first time, and many will see the light on how good the tech is

I think PIRATE is the best thing in the cryptosphere I have seen since IOTA,  very simple tweak to an asset chain parameter but it flicks the switch on something extremely useful jl777 has created, right at the time  privacy is about to become a huge issue

PIRATE clones will need a reason for being, clones for clones sake won't work,  but a darknet market might try and start their own PIRATE , or some other niche market. Competition is ok, we should welcome it!
