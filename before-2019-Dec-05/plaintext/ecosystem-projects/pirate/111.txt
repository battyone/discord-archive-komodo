and i would argue you need to have a good grasp of the english language to be expressive.  in other languages it is easier to be more expressive and passionate.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 what chains has more hash power than PIRATE now?

[04-Oct-18 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
ZEC and ZEN are the only equihash with more

[04-Oct-18 01:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbh, I haven't looked

[04-Oct-18 01:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay 👍

[04-Oct-18 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is about 3% of ZEC hashrate

[04-Oct-18 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
almost half of ZEN

[04-Oct-18 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
something like that

[04-Oct-18 01:32 PM] Mylo#8306
did ZEN rebrand as hoizen?

[04-Oct-18 01:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
WOW, just looked ....ARRR diff (and total hashrate) has been higher than ZCL for days now

@Mylo my mother is Ph.D in Hindi and Punjabi Language. Seen her work. 
my Grandfather knew Urdu in written/spoken. Learned a bit of lil things from my family.
I am not literal, but if my guess is good, then I think almost all verbal languages humans speak has silly rules. 🙂
_I can read/write/speak 3 langauges. English, Punjabi, Hindi, and understand few other languages from India _

since PIRATE is better than ZEN in all ways and ZEN is at 80 mil marketcap...

[04-Oct-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
once the mainstream miners find out about PIRATE and it gets a CEX for easier trading...

I think PIRATE turned out to the most valuable gem, and will keep being such a treasure for long time. thanks to z tx only and dPoW, only waiting to be used as payments currency.

[04-Oct-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, with CEX (in progress) and payments, then PIRATE is ready to get to the next level with just sapling and mobile left to do next year

[04-Oct-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
crypto now is somewhat similar to internet in the 90s

[04-Oct-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
there are the pets.com and the yahoo and google

[04-Oct-18 01:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree 🙂

[04-Oct-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
at the time pets.com was praised for its marketing

[04-Oct-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810

`the "conservative" will have the yahoo (seems BTC is similar to this)`
I'm thinking BTC will be more like ask.com. Or is that just my personal wishful thinking?

[04-Oct-18 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC has become so entrenched it will be decades before it can disappear

I always look at current block diff, but for perspective the "average" diff was at 200-300k (KMD normally ~80-110k) and the sustained rate for the last 36hrs has been 450-550k (and any movement has been increasing)

[04-Oct-18 02:01 PM] CHMEX#0686
1415 Blocks in the last 24 hours now none for 11 Minutes

[04-Oct-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that means the diff algo is just about right

[04-Oct-18 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The issue is more of what is available than what I can afford
All that is here is DSL and we live a bit passed the "1 mile limit", so the quality is the real issue

[04-Oct-18 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by the time cable and/or are an option here, they will be the equivalent of dialup and DSL 😦

"A recent study published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, based on an analysis of nitrogen and carbon isotopes extracted from the bones of 80 18th-century British sailors, indicates that they ate just what the Royal Navy’s Victualling Board ordered as official rations: bread, beef, an occasional dollop of butter and cheese, and a gallon of beer a day."

[04-Oct-18 04:18 PM] wookie#7663
Thought I'd start a Pirate trivia of the day: Pirates didn’t always bury (hodl) their treasure. Some pirates didn’t bury their treasure right away because they wanted their share of the loot beforehand (selling early). And a pirate’s treasure didn’t always include gold (BTC) or silver; most of it was food, lumber, cloth, and animal hides.
