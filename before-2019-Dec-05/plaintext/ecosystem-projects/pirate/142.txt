`Actually ... Genie ... you as good at talkin' as you are at typin' ?`
sadly, no - I'm a redneck who got dentures at 40 and hasn't worn them but once a week in 5 years 😣

[08-Oct-18 03:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085

That;s the beauty of a podcast.... it's not visual.  Just audio!

exactly

[08-Oct-18 03:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Besides, strap on a pirate hat, eyepatch and you could really pull off the old salty pirate look it sounds like.

[08-Oct-18 03:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the audio is my point, have you ever listened to some old guy talk without his dentures?

[08-Oct-18 03:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I bet we could get a privacy buff to join in.  
You are too critical of yourself... besides.. just put the dentures in once a week then!

`Hehe, well it is out there and the community thinks you should do it.`
Yes, because I'm the type of guy that does things other people think I should, right? 😝

[08-Oct-18 03:49 PM] snowdamn#2414
i forgive all of Genie's trespasses for that one

[08-Oct-18 03:49 PM] house#8741
If we do it ... I would like to ensure that it is really smartly done ... casual but clever programing
Give me the next week to organize ... no rush

[08-Oct-18 03:50 PM] house#8741
and no pressure ... we can have a mock call in ... like "caller on the line Mr x"

[08-Oct-18 03:51 PM] house#8741

Will @cz_binance accept our proposal for a z addr and z tx only coin on his wonderful platform?  They can easily handle the AML issues internally.

`Will we have any visual update of the main pirate site?` the 1990s style theme doesn't appeal to you?

Thanks @bhteam for the help with integration.  
If you need anything from us you can DM me or let us know in this channel. 😃

[08-Oct-18 05:49 PM] bhteam#7725
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 try again now. I know it will be really hard for you to use the site, and 0*0 is still 0, but now you have the ability to input a 0% pool fee and 0$ electricity cost.

[08-Oct-18 05:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@bhteam it still requires at least 1 watt and $1 hw cost

[08-Oct-18 05:52 PM] bhteam#7725
you mine without using any Watts?

[08-Oct-18 05:52 PM] bhteam#7725
how is that useful ?

[08-Oct-18 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it is rare, but I think some people get free electricity

[08-Oct-18 05:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, personally, most of my hash is rentals, but even if I just went with my own hash, my equipment cost is $0 because it's already paid for itself

[08-Oct-18 05:53 PM] bhteam#7725
hm

[08-Oct-18 05:53 PM] bhteam#7725
ok

[08-Oct-18 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810

unis don't like it when you use the comp lab for scrypt mining either, for some reason

I sent you a barterDEX api @bhteam - Let me know if you need anything else to integrate that excahnge into your calculators.   I appreciate your help.  We should have banner ads ready in a week or two.

[08-Oct-18 06:19 PM] bhteam#7725
yeah I saw it

[08-Oct-18 06:19 PM] bhteam#7725
sorry for the late reply

[08-Oct-18 06:20 PM] bhteam#7725
actually CHMEX gave it yesterday

[08-Oct-18 06:20 PM] bhteam#7725
but it will take some time

[08-Oct-18 06:20 PM] bhteam#7725
all pairs are ALT/KMD and I need to relate that to the ALT/BTC pairs of other exchanges

[08-Oct-18 06:21 PM] bhteam#7725
so its not that simple of a plug and play API

[08-Oct-18 06:21 PM] bhteam#7725
😃

[08-Oct-18 06:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`all pairs are ALT/KMD` technically speaking, all pairs are CoinX/CoinY and KMD "happens to be" the most used base because it's a Komodo product (KMD isn't a requirement)

[08-Oct-18 06:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has been contemplating setting up an future LP for ARRR/SUPERNET and ARRR/REVS (except for the fact that mm doesn't currently do zs)_

[08-Oct-18 06:30 PM] bhteam#7725
there's nothing bad in been paired with KMD or anything else, but an additional level of normalization has to be introduced so the BarterDEX feed can be compared side by side with the other CEX feeds

[08-Oct-18 06:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The pirate API has the btc kmd base priced adjust daily as well, if that helps you @bhteam

[08-Oct-18 06:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Thanks for your work on this.

[08-Oct-18 06:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
right, I was just adding that KMD doesn't "have to be" the base and there *may be* other pairs (__including BTC__)

[08-Oct-18 06:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
one can quickly go down a never-ending rabbit hole thinking of all the possible BarterDEX pairs

[08-Oct-18 08:12 PM] Flexatron#8809

it is the highest profitable equihash by 60% https://www.crypto-coinz.net/crypto-calculator-asic/

[08-Oct-18 08:14 PM] Flexatron#8809
People buying?

[08-Oct-18 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
profitability site for miners to compare coins and decide which to mine

[08-Oct-18 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
just disable all but equihash algo and look at the list

[08-Oct-18 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it lies

[08-Oct-18 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
according to that I should have 5BTC per day in profits

[08-Oct-18 08:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
even if you calculate 750000000 watts for 40Msols

[08-Oct-18 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
total revenues and coins seems pretty accuracte

[08-Oct-18 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
the cost side seems a bit on the low side

[08-Oct-18 08:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_hasn't made 5BTC per day, much less in profit_

[08-Oct-18 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe changing the cost per kw, that go the profits to a reasonable level, but I think all the coins are using the same algo

[08-Oct-18 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so however the costs are calculated, using the same basis, the PIRATE revenue is the mostest

[08-Oct-18 08:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
to that extent, yes
