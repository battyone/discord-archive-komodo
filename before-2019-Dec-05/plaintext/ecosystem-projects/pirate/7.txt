thanks. send me your z addr. i'll send you PIRATEs when i'm back

[31-Aug-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
@scubapanda yes, PIRATE is like 99% of all the other chains, feels dangerous just like a PIRATE should

[31-Aug-18 12:16 PM] scubapanda#2485
ðŸ˜ƒ

[31-Aug-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
without dPoW it is standing alone on its hashrate

[31-Aug-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
and only native nodes, local wallet is the only way to even know if you have the coins

[31-Aug-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
everyone has buried treasure, and only buried treasue. I guess other than the miners

[31-Aug-18 12:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
