as that translates to per ARRR fluctuates wildly

My rigs are done is why lol

[06-Oct-18 03:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
hashrate being "level" for 24 hrs is not near long enough for me to do assumptive math

[06-Oct-18 03:44 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Wen “price increase” genie? 😂😂

[06-Oct-18 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
an "even" rate for a week and I might start calculating cost per ARRR

[06-Oct-18 03:53 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
On Piratepool.io, which was mentioned earlier on this channel, it mentions nheqminer and gives suggestions for Linux and Windows. Is it not possible to mine with a Mac?

[06-Oct-18 04:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think there's a build of nheqminer for Mac,  not 100% certain though

Haha

[06-Oct-18 04:12 PM] Dr Debt#0891
there definitely should be an increase with the hashrate as high as it is.

[06-Oct-18 04:15 PM] Dr Debt#0891
but Im just going to sit back and see how this unfolds.

[06-Oct-18 04:15 PM] Flexatron#8809
According to nutellalicks it should be more like 1:7

[06-Oct-18 04:17 PM] Dr Debt#0891
lol

[06-Oct-18 04:17 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I'd say that as well if I were trying to accumulate I guess.

[06-Oct-18 04:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ballpark napkin math that has no real meaning since it's a pseudo price 4 markets deep:
$0.05 per ARRR is mining cost at this minute

[06-Oct-18 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810
hashrate crashed down below 100Msol, best to cash in profits and sell. I have a big buy wall at 0.11, sell before the costs go to 1 cents

[06-Oct-18 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
sell now, buy later, always best

[06-Oct-18 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810

from all the DM i am not getting

[06-Oct-18 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
not that they beep or anything, but I imagine a sound

[06-Oct-18 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Flexatron the problem with math is that you must know all of the knowable variables in order to compute the calculation

[06-Oct-18 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
also i have found that the displayed calculated Msols is almost always below the actual Msols for some reason, possibly by a significant factor

[06-Oct-18 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
I have seen the sum of the pool Msols being more than the reported Msols, and I know there are a lot of solo miners

[06-Oct-18 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
so I did a little nh test and ended up with a 17 cents mining cost based on a 0.08 price, that was based on BTC out and PIRATE in, using 6500 USD for BTC cost

[06-Oct-18 04:31 PM] Flexatron#8809
Hmm okay

[06-Oct-18 04:31 PM] jspook16#3059
does that mean onboarding price is coming down? :trollface:

[06-Oct-18 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
if that is typical then the 0.15 KMD price is at about the breakeven for this test period and for CHMEX it is a good price to buy for onboarding inventory

[06-Oct-18 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is ridiculous to expect miners to sell at a breakeven after taking all the risk

[06-Oct-18 04:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no it does not mean that @jspook16 
onboarding is at or below where it needs to be

[06-Oct-18 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so if the typical miner is wanting to make money for things like food, rent, rum, etc. they would sell above the breakeven price

[06-Oct-18 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if they ask for too much, then people will just start mining more, so there is sort of an equilibrium

[06-Oct-18 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
the mining cost could have easily been 20 cents

[06-Oct-18 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
it could also end up being less

[06-Oct-18 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
but buyers cant really expect miners to perform a 1:1 USD to KMD conversion service

[06-Oct-18 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
20% seems too low a markup for any miner to do any sustained amount of mining

[06-Oct-18 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe their equipment is all paid for so it is just electricity costs

[06-Oct-18 04:35 PM] jspook16#3059
what should the markup be in your opinion?

[06-Oct-18 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
now, PIRATE clearly has a lot of potential, and if the miner knows this, then the price needs to be enough to make it worth the miner's lost opportunity

[06-Oct-18 04:36 PM] Flexatron#8809
Finally some sense

[06-Oct-18 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The real problem, atm, is that until mining reaches a sustained level, "cost" is just a guestimate
If I do the factual math and say cost is x and the rate moves by even 10M sols, the math is off

[06-Oct-18 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because diff:hash is not linear

[06-Oct-18 04:39 PM] scubapanda#2485
If you have a lot of time you can mine without substantial increase in the total hashrate, ie you are not competing against yourself. If you want 180k Pirate tomorrow, you will pay double the current price (because you will need to double the hashrate to get your coins).

[06-Oct-18 04:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`ie you are not competing against yourself. `
You have no idea how many people do that to themselves 😦

[06-Oct-18 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's not good for marketing to say this, but I wouldn't be surprised if the hashrate were 50% higher than it "needs" to be

[06-Oct-18 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`If you want 180k Pirate tomorrow, you will pay double the current price (because you will need to double the hashrate to get your coins).`
Actually, more than double

[06-Oct-18 04:44 PM] scubapanda#2485
Ok?

[06-Oct-18 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because diff:hash is not linear

[06-Oct-18 04:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
doubling the hash in 1 day more than doubles the diff

[06-Oct-18 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
long term it will fall back to 1:1, but short term it's more than double

[06-Oct-18 04:47 PM] scubapanda#2485
Yes, short term. Long term I don't know the exacts but I would guess it would adapt quickly enough to be almost insignificant at 24h.

☕ rum 

[06-Oct-18 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
without a non-profit miner willing to take all the risks, the sale price needs to be above the actual mining costs

[06-Oct-18 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem with PIRATE is that once you have it, it is very strong temptation to just keep it

[06-Oct-18 04:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when you add nh and their fekupedness into the mix it creates a yo-yo effect with the diff if you double the sols of the entire chain (at this point in the diff), so "quickly" is a relative term @scubapanda

[06-Oct-18 04:50 PM] scubapanda#2485
True 😃

[06-Oct-18 04:53 PM] scubapanda#2485
It might change once Pirate is bigger with miners outside NH.

[06-Oct-18 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The main philosophical question to answer is: Do you want the coin to grow in the field of miners?
If yes, then ARRR needs to be more profitable than other coins (price goes up)
If no, then ARRR price needs to be what the local community is willing to pay

[06-Oct-18 04:55 PM] jspook16#3059
I'm keeping mine. Potential is very high the way I see it

[06-Oct-18 04:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`It might change once Pirate is bigger with miners outside NH.`
That will never happen until miners get paid > than CoinX

[06-Oct-18 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
basically by paying more for PIRATE, buyers are incentivizing miners to mine PIRATE, which increases its hashrate, which increases the floor price

{Reactions}
👆🏼 (6) 💯 (4) 

[06-Oct-18 04:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
99% of PIRATE miners are in this community and care about this community
99% of all miners care jack about the coin they are mining, they want 🏎 👯 and 🍚

[06-Oct-18 04:57 PM] jspook16#3059
Lmao

[06-Oct-18 05:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And none of that even touches the fact that the "average miner" will pass on coming to a "random" discord to find a "random" channel to find a "random" person to sell to (even if it means more income)  - that's what makes nh even work.
We're in a complex realm of paradoxes here and, imo, time will solve all

[06-Oct-18 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes the lack of easy liquidity should be a strong suppressant to price (and hashrate), yet here we are

[06-Oct-18 05:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, that's why I "" average miner, not all miners and traders are lazy 😛

[06-Oct-18 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
but vast majority of hashrate is controlled by the average miners, right, so it seems a 10x increase in hashrate is not impossible, other than the fact that it would mean taking half the hashrate away from ZEC

[06-Oct-18 05:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well the only way to take more than the fringe away from ZEC is that the profitability of ARRR (including that new hash) > ZEC
and as much as I hate to say it, I don't see that coming until after tortuga

[06-Oct-18 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the profitability of ZEC?

[06-Oct-18 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
at current hashrates?

[06-Oct-18 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
using 0.08BTC per Msol/day just for some reference point

[06-Oct-18 05:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by wtm figures:
0.06404 is the ZEC miner revenue of 1M per day
0.07020 is the NH miner revenue of 1M per day
so, if you base it on a NH rental, you'd need to be at significantly higher than that to cover the cost of renting and then the profit

[06-Oct-18 05:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
eg 0.155

[06-Oct-18 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so how is ZEC profitability so good?

[06-Oct-18 05:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because idiots buy it?

[06-Oct-18 05:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
:trollface:

[06-Oct-18 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems to be not far from PIRATE profitability at current levels?

[06-Oct-18 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
7200 ZEC per day * 125 = $900K USD from 2000 Msols = $450 per Msol per day

[06-Oct-18 05:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it seems to be not far from PIRATE profitability at current levels?`
Right, but as I said before, as hash is added price needs to rise just to maintain current
The more hash rises is exponentially the more price must rise to match/exceed ZEC (or any CoinX)

[06-Oct-18 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
i see, yes assuming the price is increasing to support the hash

[06-Oct-18 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
370K PIRATE per day at 30 cents = 111K/day from say 100 Msols or $1K/Msol per day, so actually the spot rates are double ZEC

[06-Oct-18 05:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`7200 ZEC per day` is that with or without their taxes?

[06-Oct-18 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
seems that will get PIRATE to more than ZEN

[06-Oct-18 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
but not much more

[06-Oct-18 05:30 PM] scubapanda#2485
ZEC price is the same as 30 days ago. Hashrate has doubled.

[06-Oct-18 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless, it is all absorbing the new ASIC, so it is the comparative that matters
