is it normal for the hashrate to go up this fast? not familiar with miining of new coins

[26-Sep-18 08:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if typing 1 send is a "PITA" then crypto isn't the thing for you

[26-Sep-18 08:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Quick estimate math: ZEC diff is ~372x KMD diff

[26-Sep-18 08:46 PM] wookie#7663
I wonder, is the hashpower of pirate new hashpower or taken from kmd? Or taken from other coins? Just wondering how much new mining power we're bringing in?

[26-Sep-18 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD hashrate is pretty much unchanged, maybe just slightly lower today, was higher yesterday

[26-Sep-18 08:48 PM] wookie#7663
So this is mostly new mining power from outside the KMD ecosystem then.

[26-Sep-18 08:48 PM] Flexatron#8809
Nice.

[26-Sep-18 08:49 PM] wookie#7663
All of this is fantastic publicity for the KMD ecosystem!

[26-Sep-18 08:49 PM] Flexatron#8809
We should suck zcash dry

[26-Sep-18 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Given that 95-99% of the hash is rentals, there's no real accounting where it "came from"

[26-Sep-18 08:51 PM] 0x03#8822
most of it probably is http://piratepool.io/workers/zcZcu6aPvVijn84s45Gp38rBWvi6eecoNyJjQt1tVLC3ENJgSJ1US5WzViywubMX4hEzFunC4wYr2TeWZMF3Gz796FY1Xs3 🤣

[26-Sep-18 08:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ZEC miners are as married to ZEC as BTC miners are to BTC

[26-Sep-18 08:56 PM] ideamachines#8156
lol

[26-Sep-18 08:56 PM] ideamachines#8156
so the idea is to compete with ZEC and XMR?

[26-Sep-18 08:56 PM] ideamachines#8156
for the privacy wars?

[26-Sep-18 08:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, that's just an added benefit

[26-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Flexatron#8809
Weird to compete with your own fork
