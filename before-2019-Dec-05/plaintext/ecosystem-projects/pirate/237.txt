As soon as Arrr is tradable on different Exchanges, Whitepaper and Roadmap etc. everything is ready we have to introduce Pirate to Snowden.  He had recommended ZCash as the only currency.  Then he will love Arrr and possibly recommend him publicly. @FishyGuts

So with a bigger privacy set and systemic risk reduced greatly, ARRR is the best of both worlds?

it says:
"shielded transactions are being enforced by crypto conditions"

[29-Oct-18 01:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
PIRATE blockchain DOES NOT support crypto-conditions.

[29-Oct-18 01:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The enforcement of shielded transactions is done via the source code change done to `komodod` C/C++ source code.

[29-Oct-18 01:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
by adding an assetchain option `-ac_private`

Monero Germany laughs about Pirate.

But they also have zero knowledge.  Pirate should be centralized, bla bla. They say Pirate was developed by one person.  A German person.  First it was @Acura , now it should be me. I'm getting more and more prominent. 😂😂😂

Hi, is it possible to mine piratecoin solo?

[29-Oct-18 03:42 PM] totoundco#8823
Without building an own pool

[29-Oct-18 03:44 PM] Exile13#4458
probably not profitable @totoundco

[29-Oct-18 03:44 PM] Exile13#4458

Folks: after extensive study, consultation with other people in the industry, and public discussion on this forum and many other places, the Zcash Company has decided we’ll support a new version of our zcashd software which implements changes to mining.  When?  Nothing will...
