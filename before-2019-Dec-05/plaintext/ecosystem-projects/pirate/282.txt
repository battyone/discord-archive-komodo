@AndrewK only if it happens in a certain time, the longer a price stays in a range is the longer that range becomes the "accepted normal price"

@AndrewK evidence of my point is KMD: people are, quite literally, praying that a 🐳 will push the "accepted normal price" floor up to 50% of what the "accepted normal price" was last year; ffs, people are getting excited over the price moving 10¢ on a $1.14 value of a coin that was $2.40-$14

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 don’t worry. Brief period of accumulation at these levels and then we will have some fun. Money will move from weak hands to strong hands.

Thing is people have different goals. I have accumulated a lot buying Pirate OTC & mining before the exchange opened. Now I am working on 'reaccumulating' KMD while keeping my ARRR stash as large as possible. That does entail mining, selling some ARRR, buying some KMD and keeping some of the surplus Pirate...

Tron is doing well by selling their below average rip off of Ethereum to normies but what will Pirate do to appeal to the normies?

[08-Nov-18 01:32 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@IsekiSolari   There is a marketing foundation on the public trello, and the comparison articles will eventually have a wonderful effect for bringing in new users.   I saw the plan for the paper wallet (a build-able treasure chest) and think that alone might get some great visibility just because its fun.

[08-Nov-18 01:34 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I have a pile of ideas (I have exp and background in marketing)  but i'm holding on to most of those til I manage to actually build a nice hoarde of ARRR.... before I whip them all out.

Since its a  *fully* decentralized project  (no true central team) it is up to each one of us to push ARRR out into the world through our various connections and avenues.

What's the PIRATE's default P2P and RPC port?

[08-Nov-18 02:36 PM] PTYX#6840
usually they will string you along until they tell you "send me 0.1 so that i can verify your address"

[08-Nov-18 02:36 PM] PTYX#6840
yes but i'll send it right back you seee?

we are also a little different because we have seen it all. however, it's in most people's nature to trust or at least to want to trust.

[08-Nov-18 02:40 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
@PTYX Do you somehow know the default P2P and RPC port of PIRATE?

[08-Nov-18 02:40 PM] PTYX#6840
although this one might not be a sophisticated scam, i've seen some crazy one. I remember a while back some guy coded a smart contract with some erc20 but no eth. so people would send eth to spend the erc20 and the smart contract would remove the eth.

WTB Pirate for DEX

[08-Nov-18 03:02 PM] wookie#7663
I have a noob question: besides mining and promoting publicity, are there other ways to support the pirate/kmd network? If I understand correctly all the work falls into the 64 notary nodes. Would it be useful (maybe down the road) to have "junior" notarynodes process some of the "less critical" functions?...Or maybe I am jumping the gun again...

[08-Nov-18 03:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`If I understand correctly all the work falls into the 64 notary nodes. `
You understand incorrectly (that's only partially true for KMD, and not at all true for PIRATE)

[08-Nov-18 03:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
One of the best ways to support any crytpo is to run a full node; it's easy, nearly free, and does a lot of good
