that too. PIRATE is a much better name than XMR or ZEC

everybody secretly (or not so secretly) wants to be a pirate

[27-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Yassin#3685
i want a boat!! :trollface:

[27-Sep-18 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
I look forward to the PIRATE marketing that will go viral

[27-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Alright#0419
Who dares to make a DNM?

[27-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Alright#0419
that's how XMR took off

[27-Sep-18 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
but first we need tortuga.exchange and an automated way to onboard new users

[27-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Regnar#6164
So I guess when this goes lunar we should all chip in and buy an island somewhere?

[27-Sep-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
I suggest a PIRATE bounty for an automated onboarding system

[27-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Yassin#3685
if i am whale, i sent bounty!! 😉

[27-Sep-18 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
looks like close to ATH hashrate (again)

[27-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Yassin#3685
link?

[27-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Regnar#6164
curious, but anyway we can make a KMD CC that is a faucet for PIRATE? instead of clicking "Claim Faucet" the requirement is 15 KMD sent to an address?

[27-Sep-18 09:07 PM] SHossain#0007
who is mining with `RPir4tes9Yq2DgQLDZgEcX2iQeTR5mE7z2` ? please donate some to community funds and shield your :treasure:

[27-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Alright#0419
not joking about a DNM either, if you look at XMR's historical charts all the pumps have to do with DNMs

[27-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Alright#0419
aurora and alphabay

[27-Sep-18 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
until there is an externally verifiable and liquid price, PIRATE cant really be used for general commerce

[27-Sep-18 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why the next step is tortuga.exchange

[27-Sep-18 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
then automated onboarding

[27-Sep-18 09:09 PM] Buddz1993#5380
thats great 😃

[27-Sep-18 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe automated onboarding can be done in parallel. it would require monitoring for KMD deposit and then sending out a ztransaction

[27-Sep-18 09:09 PM] Alright#0419
how to prevent abuse?

[27-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Alright#0419
I'll buy as much PIRATE as that server has if you automate it

[27-Sep-18 09:11 PM] SHossain#0007
we need abuse protection

[27-Sep-18 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
abuse? it would be at market price

[27-Sep-18 09:11 PM] Alright#0419
Ah right, by onboarding I thought you meant 15 KMD for 777 PIRATE

[27-Sep-18 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
that wont last much longer

[27-Sep-18 09:11 PM] Alright#0419
but yes, that would be very very useful

[27-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Alright#0419
xmr.to esque

[27-Sep-18 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
price did 4x since we set the price

[27-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Alright#0419
seriously, xmr.to, mymonero.com and DNMs was why XMR thrived

[27-Sep-18 09:12 PM] SHossain#0007
That makes sense

[27-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Alright#0419
I was there, I saw it all happen

[27-Sep-18 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont think PIRATE needs DNM to thrive

[27-Sep-18 09:13 PM] Alright#0419
not saying that 😛

[27-Sep-18 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody that needs financial privacy will need PIRATE

[27-Sep-18 09:14 PM] Alright#0419
nor will I be involved with that 😅

[27-Sep-18 09:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380
blockrewards for pirate expire in 8 months you said right?

[27-Sep-18 09:22 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I dont know why but I'm seeing if we keep going like this a 0.5 Kmd trade not that far way from lol

[27-Sep-18 09:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is good with a 0.5 KMD price 😎_

[27-Sep-18 09:22 PM] jl777c#5810
at hash rate of 100 Msol, it would be close to 0.5 KMD

[27-Sep-18 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe at the price of 0.5 KMD, hashrate will be around 100 MSol

[27-Sep-18 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it is hard to know which is the cause and which is the effect

[27-Sep-18 09:23 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Imagine what is was supposed to be a test coin surpassing other privacys coins in market cap lol

[27-Sep-18 09:23 PM] actionslacks#4072
Sounds about right

[27-Sep-18 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
addition of dPoW made it clearly not any test coin

[27-Sep-18 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
@Regnar no need to say that

[27-Sep-18 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
tortuga.exchange will be a very powerful engine for KMD

[27-Sep-18 09:25 PM] jl777c#5810
no sense to make a big red flag, when anybody that understands the tech will understand this

[27-Sep-18 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810
due to relative scarcity, if PIRATE gets massively popular over next few months, it could easily go above 1 KMD

[27-Sep-18 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810
but over the next 8 months there will be a very large amount of PIRATE created

[27-Sep-18 09:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so unless there is some crazy viral growth, it seems a > 1 KMD price would be hard to sustain, but then again 1 KMD price is no magical ceiling. PIRATE is a totally independent chain and it will trade at whatever  price the market deems it should trade at

don't forget that there will be a tipping point where miners start being larger holders, as well

[27-Sep-18 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
does that really happen to coins with willing buyers?

[27-Sep-18 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it does if they are smart

[27-Sep-18 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the more you hold back is the higher what you sell *can* sell for

[27-Sep-18 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
well if the miners dont make the inventory available, that could create some sort of price spiral that might not be sustainable

[27-Sep-18 09:31 PM] jl777c#5810
miners need to sell at cost plus some small profit to help with the distribution!

[27-Sep-18 09:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's a fine balance that we weigh on a regular basis

[27-Sep-18 09:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"we" being those that look to do it at any sustainable level

[27-Sep-18 09:33 PM] jl777c#5810
exponentially growing mining capacity, paying bills, accumulating the good coins. it is a multidimensional and quite complex problem, likely with no optimal solution that can be guaranteed to be found
