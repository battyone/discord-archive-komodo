I have a flaw in my solo pool that it doesn't drop the share diff minimum

[26-Sep-18 06:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay

[26-Sep-18 06:53 AM] 0x03#8822
what pool software are you mining against

[26-Sep-18 06:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
since I normally come in under what it will be or I mine a coin like KMD (that has minimal fluctuation) I never got assed to find the issue

[26-Sep-18 06:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what pool software are you mining against`
a massively modified version of aayanl's solo pool

ah, while we're at NH again: wtf, i can raise order prices arbitrarily, but lower them only in 0.01btc steps, every 500s?

[26-Sep-18 06:55 AM] 0x03#8822
scam much?! 🤣

[26-Sep-18 06:55 AM] 0x03#8822
it's not like they'd be going a bit of a way to get more money out of their customers, i gotta say 😃

Hello, anyone else mining on pirate.komodostats and does not receive the payouts?

[26-Sep-18 06:56 AM] 0x03#8822

[26-Sep-18 06:58 AM] 0x03#8822

[26-Sep-18 07:00 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Would be mining here if he knew how to setup a pool.   Someday... *stares off in distance*

[26-Sep-18 07:01 AM] 0x03#8822
i've published a working copy of my setup if you scroll up, around midnight (thus 9hr ago) iirc

I got a BarterDEX node to run on Linux a few months back.  That was an accomplishment for me.

[26-Sep-18 07:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I think I could get a solo pool going just need a couple hours to set aside for it.

Question for you tech guys.  
Could a BTC relay be setup somehow for ARR (I’m officially calling it ARR)

[26-Sep-18 07:04 AM] 0x03#8822
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you didnt mention that on the last round of connecting @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 to @computergenie 😄

[26-Sep-18 07:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ARR ... Arbitrary Retirement Revenue?

[26-Sep-18 07:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
As opposed to an exchange could we setup a BTC relay for people to get in/out of pirate?   I mean who would want to get out but you get my point yeah?   Since we can’t have an exchange.

[26-Sep-18 07:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yet... 😜

[26-Sep-18 07:06 AM] 0x03#8822
i have a feeling this might change in not too much amount of time

I hate that luck is a part of mining

[26-Sep-18 07:08 AM] 0x03#8822
after all it's a lottery

[26-Sep-18 07:09 AM] 0x03#8822
but one where you can be kinda sure you're not being ripped off at least

[26-Sep-18 07:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I actually found more blocks when the diff was 2.5x higher than I am now 😭

[26-Sep-18 07:10 AM] 0x03#8822
what occurs to me, i wonder how much time was effectively burned 'since the first pool there ever was' by wondering wether or wether not its bad luck or a nonworking pool 🤣

[26-Sep-18 07:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a feken ton

[26-Sep-18 07:11 AM] 0x03#8822
definitely. i contributed some hours o the 'grand total' as well

[26-Sep-18 07:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1 pool op actually spent 2 days doing "math" to show that a specific version of S9 fw was "bad luck" 🤦

[26-Sep-18 07:12 AM] 0x03#8822
there we have it, another promising candidate for the definition of 'too much time'

[26-Sep-18 07:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, he's just an idiot with just enough education to think he's not an idiot

its pie it really is so easy.... I did it while I was drunk.

[26-Sep-18 07:23 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
On a blockchain where no one can see who has what and with a feeless exchange to alternate between it and kmd as well as it's coin supply similarity to KMD .  Pirate seems to be destined to be eventually at parity .  Just wishful thinking😇

[26-Sep-18 07:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
*still has 110k but wont sell it*

[26-Sep-18 07:25 AM] 0x03#8822
so there was a public working pool software?

[26-Sep-18 07:25 AM] 0x03#8822
just, nobody knew about it?

[26-Sep-18 07:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats solo only

[26-Sep-18 07:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[26-Sep-18 07:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
