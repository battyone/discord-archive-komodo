[26-Sep-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
I am making a PIRATE bid of 0.02 and ask of 0.05 for large amounts. I am sure others will have better prices on both sides, but I can do very large transactions

[26-Sep-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
All PIRATES, please shield your coinbases. almost 20% is unshielded! a true PIRATE never leaves his coins out in the open!!

[26-Sep-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the less in taddr, the more value for all PIRATE as the anon set is bigger

[26-Sep-18 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_shieldcoinbase "*" zaddr

[26-Sep-18 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
just do the z_shieldcoinbase with a zaddr in your wallet and it will automatically handle things, it even prints out how many utxo you have left

[26-Sep-18 10:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
.02 kmd?

[26-Sep-18 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, I pay 0.02 KMD per PIRATE, sell for 0.05 KMD

[26-Sep-18 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i know, insane spread

Hi, where can I obtain pirate coin?

[26-Sep-18 10:27 AM] snowdamn#2414
"but I can do very large transactions" - do we need to wait for PEX to see how large? do you mind sharing approximation?

[26-Sep-18 10:27 AM] 0x03#8822
i'd assume if jl says large you can probably use any scale that makes sense
