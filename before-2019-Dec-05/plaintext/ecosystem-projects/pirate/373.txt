[dscrd-prt] <LoPhatMelk> @mrlynch I got busy with work and just now saw your reply. I agree with everything you said, I was just posting what they had said. I think it was a little harsh on the internal bickering part myself, but it was obviously the perceived situation. Anyway, wasnt trying to pick at a scab, just wanted to clarify. üôÇ

[dscrd-prt] <polycryptoblog> People will need privacy when the AI doppelg√§ngers come about .  In an age where we have deep fake videos / images , voice mimicking software , access to pretty much everyone‚Äôs personal data,   It‚Äôs only a matter of time til someone trains its program to become someone

[dscrd-prt] <camthegeek> There was an article I read about a week ago.. it talked about how we live in a world of surveillance.. and how it's became a norm. One day, it will burn out and privacy will become very valuable.

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> it's as safe as trading on any exchange with no UA or known owners (aka: as safe as it's ever been, even when it was "DP")

[19-Oct-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `should it be exploited by a badge?`
When you give someone physical access to your device, they have physical access to your device.
It's not like these cops are hacking into phones, people are giving them over (unlocked) and somehow "shocked" that they have access to the device üòï

[19-Oct-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> Don't want cops to have your data? Then a) don't store it on your phone, or b) lock the feker down.

[19-Oct-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <PeLe ‚öì> I misunderstood. Thought police suspected, arrrested or detained and accessed phone without consent..

[19-Oct-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <PeLe ‚öì> But yea, look it down. Simple

[19-Oct-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> I do have to admit that `without consent` is kinda relative in some places. There are some places that have passed laws that require you hand over/unlock, but I'm not sure how far those have gone in challenge courts

[19-Oct-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> which is why the a) option; they cannot see what's not on there

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> as long as there's a thing to be known, there will always be someone that wants to know it; whether you want them to know it or not

[20-Oct-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763

[20-Oct-19 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <actionslacks> Yeah, after watching a few videos it seems a little low budget production-wise for what they are charging. I watch PBS, but I'm old

[20-Oct-19 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BooYaCa$harrr> Targeted advertising would be more effective for our audience

[20-Oct-19 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> "Morland said that the decision to go on the show came down to a simple cost-benefit analysis. It was less about being featured on a public television segment, and more about the value of having a highly produced company video."

[20-Oct-19 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Strob> To advertise on a tv show you need precise reports about when and where it was aired and how many people watched it.

[20-Oct-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> I have an old email from CoinTelegraph from when i asked about advertising my store, they charge $6k for a youtube commercial production video

[20-Oct-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <actionslacks> It's hard to predict what angle they would take or what we would get as a finished product. Would be better to build around a message than an interview in my opinion. But honestly I have no idea what such a production would cost. I have a couple friends I can ask about it.

[20-Oct-19 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `you need precise reports about when and where it was aired and how many people watched it.`
I agree that without demo info, it's kinda pointless

[20-Oct-19 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> you guys think it would be better to have places like cointelegraph and coindesk produce videos for us and post em on their sites?

[20-Oct-19 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ üë¥üèºüì¢ true, but could it be worth the money to have a high quality production video made?

[20-Oct-19 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> and if it is, maybe i can talk to them about the costs

[20-Oct-19 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <actionslacks> I think framing Pirate as one of the only possible alternatives to the banking system, in a future cashless society, would be a pretty compelling user story. I would think even with fancy graphics, dialog, and music you could make it for well under $20k

[20-Oct-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `Host Laurence Fishburne` = what? 20-25 seconds?

[20-Oct-19 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> it's not so much about him hosting, it's more about having a doc style video broadcasted

[20-Oct-19 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> but in light of the things that were dug up, it's sounding like a resounding "no, don't do this"

[20-Oct-19 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Strob> Maybe it would be better to try to find a YouTuber we could pay to help promote Pirate. One with a large and crypto aware audience... If that's possible. At least with youtube we have a good idea about how many people saw the video.

[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> if anyone searching to buy arrr - lets recommend tradeogr more - arrr needs some visible volumes on CMC to be seen attractive and gain adoption; most people just watch cmc liquidity to evaluate crypto projects
