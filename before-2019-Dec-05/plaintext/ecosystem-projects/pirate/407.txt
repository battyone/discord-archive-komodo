[dscrd-prt] <Hember> I could make a comparison video about ARRR and some other currency. Maybe Beam.But that would be in Finnish. And I might add puppies.

[24-Nov-19 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> thats a 0 byte file...

[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> it's a blank text file üò≠

[24-Nov-19 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ph03nix> chmex is pretty quick when it comes to fixing these things

[24-Nov-19 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> seems like all (the ones i checked) on https://na.bootstrap.dexstats.info/ are 0 byte files

[24-Nov-19 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> cool no worries, it's way faster than downloading the thing

[24-Nov-19 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> why is it so big btw? the db size should be 4.5 GB but i've downloaded like 11 gigs and got only 180k blocks

[24-Nov-19 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> not why is it so big, i mean what is all the data that is being transferred when downloading the chain?

[24-Nov-19 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ph03nix> i can't answer that, but someone here will

[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> with bootstrap i keep getting "error in HDD, corrupt blocks, you need to update and if that doesn't work you need to resynch"

[24-Nov-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> the 2nd thing on üëÜ that guide is update komodo

[24-Nov-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> pirate uses the komodo binaries

[24-Nov-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> when applying bootstrap make sure the daemon is stopped

[24-Nov-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> thanks it was stopped

[24-Nov-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> i dont have komodo built, do i need to do that? it says update komodod with 
cd komodo
git checkout dev
etc

[24-Nov-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> i have only pirate folder

[24-Nov-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> those instructions are written for using JL777/komodo, if you use PirateNetwork/pirate, then just make substitutions where appropriate

[24-Nov-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> ... i should have thought of that üòÖ

[24-Nov-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763

[24-Nov-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> follow what that says but use `dev` or `master`

[24-Nov-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> ok thx

[24-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <CHMEX> Looks like you have an outdated version of the binaries if the bootstrap did not work

[24-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `PirateNetwork/pirate` needs some pruning since master and dev are the only non-stale brances

[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> will sync again after this coming update

[24-Nov-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> sorry, use master or dev

[24-Nov-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> yeaaaaaaaa synched with the network!

[24-Nov-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> that fixed it, thx guys

[24-Nov-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> do i need to do 
./komodod -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225 &
ever time or can i just do ./komodod -ac_name=PIRATE after the first time?

[24-Nov-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> always all of the params
change a param and you're on a different chain

[24-Nov-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> you can also make a short script for it (like a shortcut)
```#!/bin/bash
cd $HOME/pirate/src #komodod location
./komodod -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=178.63.77.56 &
