He could list Verus.  Does he have it as an algo on the site?

[12-Oct-18 03:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
Wasn't there a chain reset on PIRATE a while ago?  I think my node is so old it's on the old chain or something

[12-Oct-18 03:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have a wallet.dat from the original chain, payouts from piratepool.io don't show up

[12-Oct-18 03:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
i see this in `getinfo` which doesn't look right ``` "notarized": 0,
  "prevMoMheight": 0,
  "notarizedhash": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",

[12-Oct-18 03:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
the halving changed, right?

[12-Oct-18 03:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
```  "reward": 25600000000,

[12-Oct-18 03:22 PM] dukeleto#7326

[12-Oct-18 03:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
are my vintage CPU-mined shade grown UTXOs worth more than these shiny new ASIC-mined UTXOs?

[12-Oct-18 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sadly, no 😦

[12-Oct-18 03:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
I CPU mined PIRATE for like 6 hrs and then the asics attacked, but I got some good rewards that first day 😃

[12-Oct-18 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I mined 5 whole blocks before the dPoW boom 😛

[12-Oct-18 03:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
a Pirate GUI wallet (TreasureChest) is on my radar, but I am so busy preparing for winter right now, that it's going to take a few weeks. I can get a simple source-only-and-ugly-release pretty quick, then I will need help from the community for images/graphics/CSS stuff to make it look pretty, and maybe some bad pirate jokes

[12-Oct-18 03:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
like, every time you get an RPC error, it also tells you a bad pirate joke

[12-Oct-18 03:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's the wave of the future

[12-Oct-18 03:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If you give me sizing, I'll get you graphics.

@dukeleto health and family first. Be winter ready, we’ll be waiting for ya here 😉😁

[12-Oct-18 03:51 PM] jspook16#3059
Winter is coming?

[12-Oct-18 03:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don’t know. NZ AU got summer started 😄

[12-Oct-18 03:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
winter has begun in NA where I am, pipes already tried to freeze once 😃

[12-Oct-18 03:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
and a readme, it's basically done

[12-Oct-18 03:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's fun to write READMEs and commit messages in Pirate lingo

[12-Oct-18 03:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Nice commit comment 😂

[12-Oct-18 04:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
it still needs a few small changes to actually talk to the Pirate daemon, and look at that, my coffee is ready

[12-Oct-18 04:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
i can make it work at a very basic level with a few tiny changes. Making things pretty and taking into account pirate-only stuff, will take some time

[12-Oct-18 04:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
but I can make it basically functional pretty fast

[12-Oct-18 04:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
it will assume you have a running Pirate daemon already, for now. there is code to try to auto-download and start things, but it's fragile and annoying

[12-Oct-18 04:04 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@dukeleto  did you try to merge solution of heating froms asics you use for mining, so that oyu could recycle heat to warm those pipes for example ?

[12-Oct-18 04:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 been thinking that for a while, I need to get ethernet and GFCI outlets in there, then I can. Just installed my first GFCI outlets yesterday, so I could install pipe heaters 😃

[12-Oct-18 04:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
right now, all my miners warm me. I don't use any external heat at all, they keep me at least +40F from ambient

[12-Oct-18 04:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's below freezing outside and over 70F in here, just from miners 😃

[12-Oct-18 04:06 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Me also got some house working last 3 months / moved from capital to small vilage. Just intalled heating, hot water and internet 😃

[12-Oct-18 04:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't put any heat to waste 😃

[12-Oct-18 04:06 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
not perfect yet but sth works, real stuff not virtual 😃

[12-Oct-18 04:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
We need a Pirate translation

[12-Oct-18 04:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
we can actually make a translation, and the entire UI will be rendered in Pirate talk

[12-Oct-18 04:07 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
you mean the pirate language in eng ?

[12-Oct-18 04:08 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I can hardly understand that 😃 , even worse then that startrek language of Chthulu or sth

[12-Oct-18 04:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackbeard speaks fluently in pirate

[12-Oct-18 04:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don’t understand that language, must be good 😅

[12-Oct-18 04:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[12-Oct-18 04:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
we might need some UI code to enable pirate mode

[12-Oct-18 04:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
because currently it looks at your LOCALE stuff and auto-chooses

[12-Oct-18 04:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I will put together a list of pirate words.  Blackbeard can come up with the error message phrases.

[12-Oct-18 04:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts that file lists all the languages the UI has been translated into

[12-Oct-18 04:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
hush-ng has a bunch more, but they aren't fully merged. So we inherited English + French for now

you don't need to understand code

[12-Oct-18 04:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's just key + value pairs. The GUI uses the key to look up what the text should be, which is how translating into various languages is implemented

[12-Oct-18 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
if lang == FR, use the french text for "shielded balance", stuff like that
