[04-Nov-18 03:19 PM] Llama#1330
But it takes 2 hours to deposit kmd onto Binance :/

[04-Nov-18 03:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Llama don't know... don't really know you. no offence, but i'm paranoid when it comes to my funds 😃

[04-Nov-18 03:25 PM] mrlynch#5735
he probably has his funds in kmd and needs to trade for btc?! don;t know

[04-Nov-18 03:25 PM] Llama#1330
Yeah

[04-Nov-18 03:25 PM] Llama#1330
Genies simple mind cant comprehend that

[04-Nov-18 03:25 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Llama  how would you see this transaction move forward?

[04-Nov-18 03:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what if I told you that binance isn't the only exchange in the world.....

[04-Nov-18 03:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
it has the lowest trade fees though 😄

[04-Nov-18 03:26 PM] Llama#1330
I would sell some kmd and then either use escrow or u send first

[04-Nov-18 03:26 PM] Llama#1330
I’ve done like 25+ arrr trades

[04-Nov-18 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it has the lowest trade fees though`
true, the 0.000001 KMD sure will make a difference 🙄

[04-Nov-18 03:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
:))) point taken genie

[04-Nov-18 03:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
that's the spanish gold right there

[04-Nov-18 03:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
any1 willing to escrow Llama's btc? while i send $$ via paypal to him/her?

[04-Nov-18 03:30 PM] Oszy#5734

Been told by the owner that I need to alter static diff to 100,000.

[04-Nov-18 05:29 PM] B.B.Symphony#1809
Any suggestions?

[04-Nov-18 05:30 PM] B.B.Symphony#1809
It is an Innosilicon A9

[04-Nov-18 05:40 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm not sure why you'd need that high diff?  Maybe try another pool or port. http://minethepiratechain.black/getting_started has details on our asic port

[04-Nov-18 05:49 PM] B.B.Symphony#1809
@NutellaLicka Thanks! That one is working. I don't know why the other one wouldn't start

@FishyGuts  @blackbeard Hello everyone. I have a problem with BlackBear. I made the trading of the Arrr to him. Fishguts said he was reliable. But when I turned Arrr to him. He blocked me and said I was a scammer. I need justice. Need an explanation

[04-Nov-18 06:03 PM] candy#2951
@jl777c  I need a person who owns this trial.

This is why OTC is closed.

I don't have time for this crap on a Sunday morning trying to work on listings and answer emails and enjoy my coffee 😂

[04-Nov-18 06:09 PM] BlockTech#6895
@candy  anyway, what do you expect ? Even if you where to be scammed (and we know you're the scammer here) no one will give you back your ARRR.

[04-Nov-18 06:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Nor on a friday night, or a wednesday afternoon  😛

[04-Nov-18 06:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[04-Nov-18 06:12 PM] cantptalblonit#9346
Enjoy your coffee there are always people who ruin a good thing. Too bad we don't have the instant Karma where they transport instantly to a ship of Pirates with sabers forcing them to walk the greasy plank.

I need an explanation. I sent Arrr. But he did not get it. That's the lie.

[04-Nov-18 06:14 PM] Oszy#5734
You did not send anything! You transaction is not successful!

[04-Nov-18 06:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
According to the court your transaction is not succesful.

[04-Nov-18 06:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Executing means noting.

[04-Nov-18 06:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I once saw a guy try to execute a backflip.... 
Didn't work out so well.

You must be legit using 6 different names in one week.

[04-Nov-18 06:18 PM] Oszy#5734
What the hell you want? You've been told to get out. End of story.

[04-Nov-18 06:20 PM] candy#2951
@FishyGuts  @blackbeard I think there are a lot of scammers who are deliberately covering each other. The people will pay the price of what you did. The scums

[04-Nov-18 06:21 PM] Oszy#5734
You are the only one here trying to cover for yourself calling yourself scammer on other names.

[04-Nov-18 06:21 PM] Oszy#5734
