This guy better get this right or I'll be walking the plank for sure.

pulled from @CHMEX 's nice api

[15-Oct-18 05:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If he does, it'll be his most traded coin 😛

[15-Oct-18 05:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@FishyGuts i hope that exchange told you about their "$200 per update per coin" policy, or maybe that policy is only for the coins they don't make txfees from

[15-Oct-18 05:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes, but it's 300 now, and yes volume = no change fee.

[15-Oct-18 05:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So vrsc has no change fees now I think... but others would.

[15-Oct-18 05:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fek, to get it working, I can't think of any of us that wouldn't send $200

[15-Oct-18 05:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have a little more for the cost... if he comes back with a SOLID "we can do it and it's X more", I will reach out.

[15-Oct-18 05:17 PM] CHMEX#0686
Wow duke that looks nice!

[15-Oct-18 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX fyi, my wallet gui code aggressively caches that price data, and doesn't update it as frequently as the rest of the UI updates.

[15-Oct-18 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
i ported the hush-ng code, which did USD/EUR/BTC, it changed nicely into USD/KMD/BTC

[15-Oct-18 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for a non-trading wallet, cache seems reasonable thing to do

[15-Oct-18 05:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
the wallet updates every 10 seconds or so

[15-Oct-18 05:18 PM] CHMEX#0686
sounds good yes.

[15-Oct-18 05:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
GUI wallets are the best way to DoS yourself via RPCs

[15-Oct-18 05:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
and find race condition bugs deep in daemon internals

[15-Oct-18 05:19 PM] CHMEX#0686
I remember barterdex gui 'ddosd' windows marketmaker in the beginning

[15-Oct-18 05:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX so TreasureChest uses 20 seconds and only updates stats 1 per minute

[15-Oct-18 05:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the best way to DoS yourself via RPCs`
We had that issue with a couple things we tried in BarterDEX too

{Reactions}
💯 

[15-Oct-18 05:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
if once per minute is not enough, you have a problem, and it's not the wallet

[15-Oct-18 05:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX i can also slow it down if you see too many requests on your server, let me know

[15-Oct-18 05:20 PM] CHMEX#0686
I keep an eye on it thanks!

[15-Oct-18 05:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
so every Pirate user that has an open TreasureChest wallet, will generate 1 request per minute to your API

[15-Oct-18 05:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
do you have a caching layer serving the json?

[15-Oct-18 05:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
or is it actually executing a php binary every time?

[15-Oct-18 05:22 PM] CHMEX#0686
Great and if we have 10000 open wallets simultaneously I upgrade the service

[15-Oct-18 05:23 PM] CHMEX#0686
it's executing the binary each time but the pricing data is cached

[15-Oct-18 05:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, 10K simultaneous Pirate wallets means 10K hits/minute to your API

[15-Oct-18 05:24 PM] CHMEX#0686
let me do something I create a subdomain so if it hits hard I can change the server instantly

[15-Oct-18 05:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX do you have nginx in front of the app server?

[15-Oct-18 05:26 PM] Flexatron#8809
They must be close if they already display arrr

[15-Oct-18 05:26 PM] CHMEX#0686
https://pirate.dexstats.info/pirateprice.php

[15-Oct-18 05:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, will use that subdomain

[15-Oct-18 05:27 PM] CHMEX#0686
I have the service hosted if you use the above I can very easy change it and redirect it to a ngnix server or anything else

[15-Oct-18 05:27 PM] CHMEX#0686
like the explorers that run on hetzner

[15-Oct-18 05:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@CHMEX @dukeleto that means it can tell pirate userbase count based on its wallet use?

[15-Oct-18 05:29 PM] CHMEX#0686
😃 add a uniqueid to it like the zaddress :trollface: 
But yes I think we could track it.
( maybe make an option to deactivate that for real private pirates )

[15-Oct-18 05:30 PM] CHMEX#0686
even better yes

[15-Oct-18 05:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I recommend pirates to go through tor for this 😅

[15-Oct-18 05:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder your similar concern is valid for many wallets, also, we can make it optional and/or default to on/off

[15-Oct-18 05:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
it was inherited from hush-ng, which defaults to talking to CMC and defaults to on

[15-Oct-18 05:33 PM] CHMEX#0686
btw that CMC API will be shutdown in case you use it someplace

[15-Oct-18 05:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think they shut down their v1 api? but their newer api is still staying on?

[15-Oct-18 05:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
hard to keep track of stuff

[15-Oct-18 05:33 PM] CHMEX#0686
I believe last I read you will need an api key

[15-Oct-18 05:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder if you want to scare yourself, think about where everybody downloads the zcash seed files from, which person can identify every single person that uses any kind of Zcash or Zcash fork wallet?

[15-Oct-18 05:34 PM] CHMEX#0686
expect markets to act funny on December 4th, 2018

[15-Oct-18 05:34 PM] snowdamn#2414
VPN+Tor and then you only have to worry about NSA backdooring in and stealing your dough 😂

[15-Oct-18 05:35 PM] cipi#4502

[15-Oct-18 05:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX those scammers are trying to charge money for their api now?

[15-Oct-18 05:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
that free plan don't work for GUI desktop wallets

[15-Oct-18 05:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@dukeleto very good point

[15-Oct-18 05:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder that person is radix42 😉 Good thing he is on our side

[15-Oct-18 05:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😂😅😎 yes

[15-Oct-18 05:37 PM] CHMEX#0686
they are charging bloombergish money for the api yes

[15-Oct-18 05:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is the end of the respect I had for CMC, there is goes

[15-Oct-18 05:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
i guess everybody migrates to coinlib or whatever until they start charging

[15-Oct-18 05:38 PM] CHMEX#0686
pretty much yes.
They are now apparently a business not sure who bought it maybe bloomberg...

[15-Oct-18 05:39 PM] Acura#2748
https://www.coingecko.com is a good site for Infos

[15-Oct-18 05:39 PM] Acura#2748
Maybe we can contact them for ARRR

[15-Oct-18 05:40 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes gecko already uses the realtime coin supply

[15-Oct-18 05:42 PM] Flexatron#8809
*ctrl f5 Digitalprice*

[15-Oct-18 05:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Coingecko and Livecoin watch are on the list to add once we get an exchange with support.

[15-Oct-18 05:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I don;t think DigPri will pay for integration in to CMC.

[15-Oct-18 05:43 PM] CHMEX#0686
CMC never charges money for integration

[15-Oct-18 05:44 PM] CHMEX#0686
they have some internal rules which are not always clear

[15-Oct-18 05:44 PM] CHMEX#0686
to list or not to list

[15-Oct-18 05:44 PM] CHMEX#0686
livecoin is an exchange?

ah these are the guys that get data from cmc

[15-Oct-18 05:47 PM] Flexatron#8809
*is afraid it will get dumped to 0.1 on digi*

[15-Oct-18 05:48 PM] CHMEX#0686
at what volume 65 ARRR

[15-Oct-18 05:50 PM] BlockTech#6895
I don't think it will (dump under 0.1), maybe the first few days, but as soon as masses, or big investors hear about this coin, it will skyrocket. What i'm afraid is not to be able to buy enough until this moment.

[15-Oct-18 05:52 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
@Flexatron Arrr on dp soon?
