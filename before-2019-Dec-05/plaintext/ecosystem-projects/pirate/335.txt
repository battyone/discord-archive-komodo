after that, mine and play with transactions

[24-Nov-18 06:47 AM] house#8741
cool. can you walk me through how to find out what chain Im on

[24-Nov-18 06:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
komodo-cli -ac_name=ROCKET getbestblockhash

[24-Nov-18 06:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you guys have the same one

[24-Nov-18 06:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then your chain is the right one... try sendign txs to each other

[24-Nov-18 06:49 AM] house#8741
I have same -> 027e3758c3a65b12aa1046462b486d0a63bfa1beae327897f56c5cfb7daaae71

[24-Nov-18 06:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROCKET getinfo | jq '{blocks, longestchain}'
{
  "blocks": 591,
  "longestchain": 591
}```

[24-Nov-18 06:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
those 2 things are important to know

[24-Nov-18 06:51 AM] house#8741
yup same

[24-Nov-18 06:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then we have 2 chains, at least

[24-Nov-18 06:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_deletes blocks and tries to resync_

[24-Nov-18 06:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_gets stuck at 137_ 😕

[24-Nov-18 07:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol looks like ther's at least 4 chains

[24-Nov-18 07:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```JSON
$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROCKET getpeerinfo | jq '.[]|{addr,synced_blocks}'
{
  "addr": "94.130.224.11:22653",
  "synced_blocks": 137
}
{
  "addr": "54.36.126.42:22653",
  "synced_blocks": 137
}
{
  "addr": "178.159.11.114:22653",
  "synced_blocks": 497
}```
then there's the chain you 2 are on and the one I killed and who knows dafuqelse

[24-Nov-18 07:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
has anybody tried to send to a notary address on ROCKET, such as RNJmgYaFF5DbnrNUX6pMYz9rcnDKC2tuAc ?

[24-Nov-18 07:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am seeing it get rejected in my regtests

[24-Nov-18 07:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is somehow on a fork where he has 0 funds 🤦🏽_

[24-Nov-18 07:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
in any case, i just wrote the first ARRR regtests

[24-Nov-18 07:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
is it a valid NN in this fork? I didn't even look at any of the code yet

[24-Nov-18 07:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
all assetchains have fixed notary pubkeys, which translate to the same transparent address on that chain

[24-Nov-18 07:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
I used https://deckersu.github.io/notaries_addresses.html but there is a header file in the komodo git repo that lists them

[24-Nov-18 07:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`all assetchains have fixed notary pubkeys`
I'm aware of that in Komodo, I meant that I hadn't looked to see if it was stripped out of the pirate fork of komodo

[24-Nov-18 07:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
hmm, i didn't look. I am using jl777/komodo repo FSM branch, and creating a new asset chain in regtest mode, with same parameters as ARRR

for getting a node synced, sure

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you are supposed to say "thanks for writing the first automated tests for ARRR", instead of being a 💩

[24-Nov-18 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
i pushed to my FSM branch a possible improvement to node sync

[24-Nov-18 07:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And since when have I ever said what I was "supposed to"? 🤔

[24-Nov-18 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
the only difference that matters is the timestamps in the komodo_defs.h file

[24-Nov-18 07:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@jl777c i hope i didn't break stuff, by bailing out early if height < 30. Helps to reduce unnecessary prints in regtest

[24-Nov-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
that is a good optimization

@jl777c what broke with `Error: z_mergetoaddress is disabled.`?

[24-Nov-18 07:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
is it because it isn't as needed?

[24-Nov-18 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
zcash just didnt implement it until very recently, wasnt part of the big merge

[24-Nov-18 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it is also less needed

it cant be FSM, it needs to use the komodo_defs.h from the rocket repo

for whatever reason I cannot get ROCKET blocks to/from peers without stop/start

[24-Nov-18 10:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it just sits there and no movement
stop it and restart it and get new blocks from same peers

[24-Nov-18 10:58 AM] SHossain#0007
same in my end. @jl777c needs to have a look.

[24-Nov-18 11:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from whatever point it stops syncing, it's like it can't get the next 7-10 blocks and then rejects from that point on because of the blocks it "never got"

[24-Nov-18 11:07 AM] KNOX#9338
