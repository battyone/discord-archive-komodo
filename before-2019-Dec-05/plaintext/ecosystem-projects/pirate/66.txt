[27-Sep-18 06:16 PM] Alright#0419

who is buying for 0.05KMD?

[27-Sep-18 06:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
better question: `Who's selling that cheap?`

[27-Sep-18 06:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_literally has standing orders for 0.08 KMD that he can't mine fast enough to fill_

[27-Sep-18 07:00 PM] AchtSechs#1592
1000 for 50 KMD

[27-Sep-18 07:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[27-Sep-18 07:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[27-Sep-18 07:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[27-Sep-18 07:38 PM] 0x03#8822
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 that wasnt me. i'm running with 22ksol avg

[27-Sep-18 07:39 PM] 0x03#8822
i suspect another 0.01MSol order and NH decided otherwise

[27-Sep-18 07:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was trying to be funny, because NH has taken my 5.4 limit order and ran it from like 10-20

[27-Sep-18 07:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a joke that no one laughs at is still a joke 😦

[27-Sep-18 07:40 PM] 0x03#8822
yea i read that.

[27-Sep-18 07:41 PM] 0x03#8822
i had ... yesterday? 7msol with a 0.01msol order

[27-Sep-18 07:41 PM] 0x03#8822
as i said. it's getting out of control 😄

[27-Sep-18 07:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, I figured that was isolated because of the small size, but their whole system is feked

[27-Sep-18 07:44 PM] jorian#4555
wait so you get more msols than what you pay for?

[27-Sep-18 07:45 PM] jorian#4555
or do i not understand NH

[27-Sep-18 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
NH biz model is to sell as much hashrate as possible as fast as possible

[27-Sep-18 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
buyer specified limits to hashrate is taken as a very rough guideline

trollface 

[27-Sep-18 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
maximizing profit is what determines how much hashrate

[27-Sep-18 07:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jorian the end result is the same amount of shares, but more shares sooner = less overall time of rental

[27-Sep-18 07:54 PM] snowdamn#2414
are most Asks being filled? i understand it's hard to track due to the nature of OTC, but most people here seem to not mind sharing. give us an Aye if you're getting your Asks filled, don't have to mention amounts, although price would help give a better picture

[27-Sep-18 07:56 PM] snowdamn#2414
something like Aye 0.065

[27-Sep-18 07:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My asks are beyond filled, I have a waiting list, so:
Aye Aye Aye 0.08

[27-Sep-18 07:56 PM] snowdamn#2414
congrats!

[27-Sep-18 07:59 PM] snowdamn#2414

[27-Sep-18 08:00 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I guess some time soon we are gonna have 1 pirate for 0.1 kmd?

[27-Sep-18 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
already some trades at that price

[27-Sep-18 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
mining cost is about 7 cents, maybe a bit more as hashrate looks like it is up a bit more

[27-Sep-18 08:02 PM] Buddz1993#5380
wow that's srsly huge.

[27-Sep-18 08:02 PM] Buddz1993#5380
