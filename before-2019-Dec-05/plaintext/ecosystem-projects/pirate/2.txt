[30-Aug-18 10:10 AM] jorian#4555
that's a special privilege

[30-Aug-18 10:14 AM] Mylo#8306
You need to update your tweet @grewalsatinder , no longer at #private-staked channel.  Also where is your tweet storm about CC contracts you split up into chapters?   (or was that a different tweet storm)?

1/24 KMD forked from Zcash.
Has all privacy tech like zk-SNARKS from Zcash.
Developed and delivered delayed Proof of Work (dPoW), and made $KMD more secure than Zcash to defend against 51% attacks.

yes, a CC contract that locks funds and can only be released to z-addresses is possible

if we had used this then command would have been:
`./komodod -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=5000000000 -ac_halving=2100000 -ac_private=1 -addnode=`

[30-Aug-18 10:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
with verus compiled binary which also has private ac param the BTC equivalent chain with verus algo would have this command:

`./komodod -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=5000000000 -ac_halving=2100000 -ac_private=1 -addnode= -ac_veruspos=0 -ac_algo=verushash`

[30-Aug-18 10:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
can has second chain named BAY :trollface:

[30-Aug-18 10:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or may be snapshot PIRATE

[30-Aug-18 10:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and move to verus algo chain

[30-Aug-18 10:47 AM] jorian#4555
snapshot z-addresses?

[30-Aug-18 10:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
üòÑ I don't know throwing ideas

[30-Aug-18 10:47 AM] jorian#4555
a snapshot basically means discovering all funds in z-addresses

[30-Aug-18 10:47 AM] jorian#4555
don't think that'll work :p

[30-Aug-18 10:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hehe true

[30-Aug-18 10:48 AM] jorian#4555
gonna be a new chain then

[30-Aug-18 10:48 AM] TonyL#3577
```
{
  "transparent": "0.00",
  "interest": "0.00",
  "private": "1023.9999",
  "total": "1023.9999"
}
```
When it will be possible to exchange PIRATEs on rum?

[30-Aug-18 10:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
you can buy BEER

[30-Aug-18 10:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

vanity z addresses?

[30-Aug-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
OTC trading seems the only way

[30-Aug-18 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Some kind of proxy token? Using the Z-mempo feild to tell who sent coins to the pooxy?

[30-Aug-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it might be possible to use a onetime zaddress, publish the viewing key and have public details in the memo

[30-Aug-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but this is quite a bit of work...

@grewalsatinder is PIRATE pool minable?

[30-Aug-18 12:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Don‚Äôt know

[30-Aug-18 12:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Mining goes to t
These t funds can only be sent to z addr

[30-Aug-18 12:17 PM] Mylo#8306
you'd have to trust pool owner by the sounds of it üòÉ

[30-Aug-18 12:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Pool must have such management

[30-Aug-18 12:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Check my tx outputs in stacked

[30-Aug-18 12:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I copied results there

[30-Aug-18 12:18 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll try to setup a pool when i have some time

[30-Aug-18 12:18 PM] SHossain#0007
just for some tests üòÉ

Arrgh!!

[30-Aug-18 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant do a pool as normal... as all the funds will go to a single T address

[30-Aug-18 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was going to do it earlier

[30-Aug-18 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but there is no way to pay it out

[30-Aug-18 12:43 PM] SHossain#0007

i can easily become the deadliest pirate here :abusedsmily:

[30-Aug-18 12:53 PM] SHossain#0007
btw, does this chain needs notarization?

[30-Aug-18 12:57 PM] SHossain#0007
how would we deal with forks?

[30-Aug-18 12:57 PM] Mylo#8306
haha yeah i was wondering when you'd arrive and what would happen .  network hash is only 187 atm.  did you stop?

[30-Aug-18 12:57 PM] SHossain#0007
i can mine away and be on the main chain

[30-Aug-18 12:57 PM] SHossain#0007
by myself

[30-Aug-18 12:57 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah this is what we're probably going to discover.

[30-Aug-18 12:57 PM] SHossain#0007
@Mylo it was a 1 minute test

[30-Aug-18 12:58 PM] Mylo#8306
and you mined that many coins?

[30-Aug-18 12:58 PM] SHossain#0007
if i continue, the diff will be so high

[30-Aug-18 12:58 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah diff would go crazy.  PIRATE arms race

[30-Aug-18 12:58 PM] SHossain#0007
it will be hard for others to mine if i continue

[30-Aug-18 12:58 PM] Mylo#8306
ha wow.  a block every cpl seconds.

[30-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Mylo#8306
just use 1 thread

[30-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
Could use the coinbase to notarize possibly?

[30-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
NN would have to mine blocks though

[30-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Mylo#8306
i'm using 4 atm, but will drop to 1 just to keep it ticking over

[30-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
a single NN at a time unfortunately

[30-Aug-18 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
*starts selfish mining* :trollface:

[30-Aug-18 01:00 PM] Mylo#8306
i don't think `generated: true` works for nota

[30-Aug-18 01:00 PM] SHossain#0007
it should work

[30-Aug-18 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
What?

[30-Aug-18 01:00 PM] Mylo#8306
how come we can't use mined rewards for kmd?
