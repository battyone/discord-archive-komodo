thank you for rain

Thanks genie.   Good call on discussing it in the open.  @TheGemologist never fear admitting to needing knowledge.   It’s the thirst for knowledge and learning yourself that compels people to help you.   

Trust me - that is not a typical @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 response!  🎃☠️🏴

The same Username model applies if im buying from Nicehash correct?

[31-Oct-18 04:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
correct

[31-Oct-18 04:32 PM] Oszy#5734
Yes

[31-Oct-18 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
In the `user.worker` model, `user` identifies you (in 99% of pools, this is your wallet address) and `worker` allows you to keep track of individual rigs/cards/rentals

[31-Oct-18 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a lot of this can be confusing at 1st, but the more you do it is the more most of it makes sense

[31-Oct-18 04:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If you have a lot of workers it’s nice to separate them.

[31-Oct-18 04:40 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Yeah, your explanation lighted my mind nicely

[31-Oct-18 04:42 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Now i will ask a question about nicehash interface..

[31-Oct-18 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

The "Miners" columns means there are this number of person selling hash for that price?

it's picked by NH to match the buyers speed requirement. sellers there don't get to choose their prices to sell.

[31-Oct-18 04:46 PM] Oszy#5734
But yes that's the number of miners for that price

[31-Oct-18 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`The "Miners" columns means there are this number of person selling hash for that price?`
Those are the total number of other people's "workers" assigned to that bid
It's mostly meaningless except to 🤓s (1 "miner" could = 1M or 200 "miners" could = 1M)

[31-Oct-18 04:51 PM] TheGemologist#6023
hmmm understood

[31-Oct-18 04:53 PM] Flexatron#8809

[31-Oct-18 04:54 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Is it better USA or EUROPE for piratepool ?

[31-Oct-18 04:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Given modern internet, I usually decide by price and available hash rather than ping times

[31-Oct-18 04:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, it matters more for the hash provider than it does to those renting

[31-Oct-18 04:58 PM] TheGemologist#6023

Do you usually change the limit from 0.1 ??

[31-Oct-18 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the "limit" is the most amount you want to rent
If you want to rent 100k sols, then 0.1; if you want to rent 1M sols, then 1

lol at putting a bag with 3 digit code around your ledger nano s which already has a 5 digit pass code in

[31-Oct-18 05:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because lag, shares, and such it's not a "hard cap", so from time to time (or sometimes "usually) your order will go as much as 10% over the "limit"

[31-Oct-18 05:04 PM] Flexatron#8809

I started with 0.1 in the beginning, then went for 6.0, you’ll not regret the extra hashing.  @TheGemologist

[31-Oct-18 05:08 PM] Flexatron#8809
diff down -> up hash a little -> diff up lower hash a lil

[31-Oct-18 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you have a bid that's high enough to get hash, then it should be less than 2 minutes before you get some

[31-Oct-18 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

stay*

[31-Oct-18 05:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can either edit to stay above, or just take whatever hash you can get whenever you can get it at the price you set

[31-Oct-18 05:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
don't go higher than any price you're willing to commit to, though, because you can increase at any amount, but they limit how much and how often you can decrease

[31-Oct-18 05:48 PM] Flexatron#8809
you can also make a new order

You can decrease 0.0001 every 600 seconds if i remember correctly

[31-Oct-18 05:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
