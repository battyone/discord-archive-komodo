[26-Nov-18 11:02 AM] CHMEX#0686
I believe the explorer bails on RKT executing at the following function.
It's JS maybe somebody can read it and know that it means?

It throw here:
  if (n <= Math.pow(2, 53)) {
        return n;
      } else {
        throw new Error('number too large to retain precision - use readVarintBN');
      }

Does that have to do with zcash not caring about bitcore?
I read something yesterday here about characters that changed mentioned by duke and james but not sure if it's related. I looks like.

BufferReader.prototype.readVarintNum = function() {
  var first = this.readUInt8();
  switch (first) {
    case 0xFD:
      return this.readUInt16LE();
    case 0xFE:
      return this.readUInt32LE();
    case 0xFF:
      var bn = this.readUInt64LEBN();
      var n = bn.toNumber();
      if (n <= Math.pow(2, 53)) {
        return n;
      } else {
        throw new Error('number too large to retain precision - use readVarintBN');
      }
      break;
    default:
      return first;
  }
};

[26-Nov-18 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
what number is it reading?

[26-Nov-18 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
there should be no number so big. it seems it is trying to parse a raw transaction? if so, sapling tx is totally different serialization

[26-Nov-18 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
need to find what is calling the failing function

[26-Nov-18 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is for something not critical?

[26-Nov-18 11:12 AM] CHMEX#0686
I will try to get the number and yes maybe just bypassing the code can be an option.

[26-Nov-18 12:12 PM] mrlynch#5735

@CHMEX I haven't looked too deep, but `https://github.com/zcash-hackworks` looks like it may have a few repos to look at and things to maybe change

Quick Q: is sapling addresses usage forced after 15 feb?

[26-Nov-18 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[26-Nov-18 01:27 PM] Flexatron#8809
good

[26-Nov-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, exchange is having hard time processing all the sprout we need to transition to sapling

[26-Nov-18 01:30 PM] scubapanda#2485
I guess there will be a GUI migration tool to move the coins to a sapling address? Agama?

[26-Nov-18 01:32 PM] CHMEX#0686
can somebody post a sapling transactionid

[26-Nov-18 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810

@scubapanda hopefully people will be able to run:
./zmigrate PIRATE zsaplingaddr

[26-Nov-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be much easier than integrating it into gui

[26-Nov-18 07:31 PM] Ocash#5347

[26-Nov-18 07:31 PM] Ocash#5347
?

[26-Nov-18 07:32 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
They won't be lost, there must be an error and it isn't processing past it. It can happen from time to time. It may be somebody has input an incorrect address and it is failing to payout

[26-Nov-18 07:32 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Once webworker has a look i'm sure he will fix it.
