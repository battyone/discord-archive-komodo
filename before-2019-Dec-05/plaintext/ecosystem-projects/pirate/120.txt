i'm a bit scared by the fact that nobody knows really how deep 'the agencies' are in this internet andhow much traffic they actually can analyze. they won't be able to break a lot of it

[05-Oct-18 12:03 PM] 0x03#8822
but they will be able to correlate

[05-Oct-18 12:04 PM] 0x03#8822
thats why i say: in the big picture, no, they cannot shutdown the internet

[05-Oct-18 12:04 PM] actionslacks#4072
going after tortuga would just increase demand

[05-Oct-18 12:04 PM] 0x03#8822
in the small picture, lets just have 'laws'

[05-Oct-18 12:04 PM] 0x03#8822
and thus outlaws you can lock away

[05-Oct-18 12:04 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
they can close CEX Arrr and make liquidity down which will decrease value a lot or totally make it unstable value -> unusable ?

@0x03 I think you dropped this on the ground:

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 while it reads like tinfoilhattery, just read about what the current plans of the EU are for bitcoin

[05-Oct-18 12:05 PM] 0x03#8822
it is not

[05-Oct-18 12:06 PM] 0x03#8822
it's basically hoping that they will fuck up as much as they always did so far with anything IT related

`nobody knows really how deep 'the agencies' are in this internet andhow much traffic they actually can analyze`
hat aside, the answer is :all of it that they know about

[05-Oct-18 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
they would need to confiscate wallets to see how much PIRATE you have

[05-Oct-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so for normal law enforcement, when they catch criminals, they can find their PIRATE

[05-Oct-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you are not doing anything criminal, then it is not anybodys business how much PIRATE you have

[05-Oct-18 12:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
cops around here can't find their own wallets, much less a crypto wallet

[05-Oct-18 12:07 PM] scubapanda#2485
The ability to sign zk-snarks offline would be an important step.

[05-Oct-18 12:07 PM] 0x03#8822
btw, i am not assuming there is some conspiracy going on, rather some common sense

[05-Oct-18 12:08 PM] 0x03#8822
a system and its actors that will slowly realize that they, upon which their wealth is built, will fight back

[05-Oct-18 12:08 PM] 0x03#8822
and common sense will have them protect 'their' system

[05-Oct-18 12:08 PM] 0x03#8822
thats my 50ct on it

[05-Oct-18 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
next year's sapling release, zSPV servers and local signing of ztransactions are needed for lite-PIRATE wallet

[05-Oct-18 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but PIRATE is just a meme

[05-Oct-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it cant be a serious thing

[05-Oct-18 12:09 PM] scubapanda#2485
😃

[05-Oct-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
just ignore the silly PIRATE

be it as it may, i think there will be a time when 'us crypto nerds' will be put (the power of the overton window) in the spot where you can just stamp us as bad.

[05-Oct-18 12:15 PM] 0x03#8822
just like selling porn movies in a store was once a complete unthinkable thing, for example

[05-Oct-18 12:15 PM] 0x03#8822
or... drinking alcohol in the usa.

[05-Oct-18 12:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's already been the way, the "Average Joe" hears "cryptocurrency" and that equals BTC and that = SilkRoad and "darkweb" and "criminals"

[05-Oct-18 12:16 PM] 0x03#8822
yet, it seems to happen on a level where you can open peoples eyes with a bunch of sentences (which dont have to be overly technical)

_yet_

[05-Oct-18 12:16 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
why sapling delayed to next year? afraid of bugs in the new code of zcash ?

[05-Oct-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
is sapling out yet?

[05-Oct-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
are there zSPV servers?

[05-Oct-18 12:16 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
end of October

[05-Oct-18 12:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
thankfully, yes;however, it's hard talking to 7 billion ppl 1-by-1

[05-Oct-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
is there local signing of ztransactions?

[05-Oct-18 12:17 PM] 0x03#8822
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you can always try to educate your peers at least.

[05-Oct-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
realistically all the required parts will take some months to get all working

[05-Oct-18 12:17 PM] 0x03#8822
dammit i have to run to the store

[05-Oct-18 12:17 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok I see, was thinking afraid of bugs 😃

[05-Oct-18 12:17 PM] 0x03#8822

[05-Oct-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810

there is no danger that it just gets done overnight

[05-Oct-18 12:18 PM] 0x03#8822
and even if, that means it's finished earlier and we can have it earlier

[05-Oct-18 12:18 PM] 0x03#8822
doesnt it

[05-Oct-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure there will be people that complain if it is finished earlier, but if it is, then it is ready sooner

The tin hat ox don’t forget the hat

[05-Oct-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
I think until the first halving there wont be much chance of zSPV

[05-Oct-18 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_doesn't even want to contemplate the overhead costs to run a zSPV server (even with improvements)_

[05-Oct-18 12:26 PM] 0x03#8822
@house i laid out above why i think it's not tinfoilhattery. care to do the same to show me why you think i'm wrong?

[05-Oct-18 12:26 PM] 0x03#8822
thats btw something that goes for everybody who quickly shouts 'tinfoil hat', just sayin

[05-Oct-18 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I could tell you where you're wrong, but then the NSA would know too

[05-Oct-18 12:28 PM] actionslacks#4072
@0x03  I fully agree. we may not yet understand the ramifications of being a part of this thing. If it keeps going like this it could turn into a real interesting time.

[05-Oct-18 12:30 PM] 0x03#8822
some ramifications are visible already: take KYC

[05-Oct-18 12:30 PM] 0x03#8822
in essence 'putting back trust to the system that doesnt need it'

[05-Oct-18 12:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as AML/KYC, crypto is just a "fear" excuse like any other 😦

[05-Oct-18 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
simple people accept simple "reasons" for giving up their liberty in the name of "security" and end up with neither

[05-Oct-18 12:37 PM] house#8741
@0x03 ... I was simply reminding you as you were leaving to go to the store [to remove the tinfoilhat]

[05-Oct-18 12:39 PM] house#8741
my bad ... not meaning to imply you were wearing one

[05-Oct-18 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no need to imply, he admitted to wearing his backup

[05-Oct-18 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[05-Oct-18 12:42 PM] house#8741
hence my comment

[05-Oct-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the govt have deanonymized vast majority of BTC blockchain, have control over most of the major exchanges

[05-Oct-18 12:48 PM] house#8741
`I think until the first halving there wont be much chance of zSPV`
I take it that potentially we could have sapling integration well before halving (native)

[05-Oct-18 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
after the VRSC pull request, we would have sapling in the dev branches, but it will not be until next year new notary hardfork that it will get to master

[05-Oct-18 12:49 PM] house#8741
ahh, ok

[05-Oct-18 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
some people still dont understand that each new ecosystem project is good for KMD

[05-Oct-18 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
they miss the simple idea that there is tech sharing

[05-Oct-18 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My only wish is that the growth would slow down to the point where I can keep up 😝

[05-Oct-18 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
even PIRATE that has no actual code of its own will push the boundary on zaddr integration

[05-Oct-18 12:52 PM] house#8741
there is so much to consider with kmd, it is not surprising

@house it seems few understand the skill level of miketout. I dont hold his .net thing against him and his being CTO of Parallels is quite well deserved

[05-Oct-18 12:54 PM] house#8741
Purely his discourse stands on its own merit ... I did not know Mike from bar of soap at first ... after one conversation with hime I knew he was a man of extreme depth

[05-Oct-18 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
at the coding level, few are able to assimilate as fast and as accurately as he can and he is not limited to C

[05-Oct-18 12:55 PM] house#8741
thus ... I was very early to the mining

[05-Oct-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
I was very skeptical he could make a GPU resistant mining algo, yet here we are and arguable CPU still has a slight advantage over GPU, even after all this time trying to make a GPU miner

[05-Oct-18 12:57 PM] house#8741
It is quite the accomplishment indeed
Sometimes ... for me at least, even though I have a fragment of understanding the coding language ... my understanding of human activity provides much better insight

[05-Oct-18 12:58 PM] house#8741
Mike is very well adapted

[05-Oct-18 01:00 PM] house#8741
There are those who can and therefor do ... and those who can and question their ability to do
Mike (present company included) seems to have no barriers but challenges

[05-Oct-18 01:00 PM] house#8741
therefore they/you do

[05-Oct-18 01:03 PM] wookie#7663
question from a non-coder/non-dev person: given there are literally dozens of PIVx forks out there. Is it easy/difficult for an "average" coder to fork Pirate? From my meager understanding, it's not possible because forks won't have access to the NNs?

[05-Oct-18 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
VRSC about to get listed on cryptopia and that gets it onto CMC. so the days of VRSC being at current prices might well be limited

[05-Oct-18 01:03 PM] 0x03#8822
there are some within the verus community that perceive PIRATE as a scam

[05-Oct-18 01:04 PM] house#8741
