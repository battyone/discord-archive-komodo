[26-Sep-18 10:30 AM] 0x03#8822
it's not saving a lot of time yet, but it could help others off the fork, or whatnot

[26-Sep-18 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181

there is a special 15KMD onboarding process, or OTC here

[26-Sep-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
first step is to get PIRATE synced and generate a zaddr

[26-Sep-18 10:35 AM] klunex#3191

[26-Sep-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810

[26-Sep-18 10:36 AM] Iwither#3590
I just wait? Is it because it is syncing?

[26-Sep-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810

when the market price moves significantly the 15 KMD for 777 PIRATE offer will be adjusted

[26-Sep-18 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
check debug.log to see if it is still syncing

[26-Sep-18 10:37 AM] Acura#2748

[26-Sep-18 10:38 AM] actionslacks#4072

[26-Sep-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
not so deep as there is only a total of 10 million PIRATE, mostly buried

[26-Sep-18 10:38 AM] Iwither#3590
Yup looks like it's syncing. GMT00:00 I guess

[26-Sep-18 10:38 AM] Iwither#3590

[26-Sep-18 10:41 AM] SHossain#0007
@Iwither you need to use latest agama or latest komodo source to run PIRATE. check pinned posts to find the 15 KMD > 777 PIRATE deal

[26-Sep-18 10:55 AM] SHossain#0007

[26-Sep-18 10:55 AM] Iwither#3590
I have not

[26-Sep-18 10:55 AM] Iwither#3590
z_importkey "zkey"

[26-Sep-18 10:55 AM] Iwither#3590
this command?

[26-Sep-18 10:56 AM] SHossain#0007
do you have priate coins in your z address already?

[26-Sep-18 10:56 AM] Iwither#3590
I have mined on the address and got paid 2 times, and My address still shows 0

[26-Sep-18 10:57 AM] Flexatron#8809
Yo, owning supernet is like owning iota, kmd, Heat, hush etcetera right?

[26-Sep-18 10:57 AM] Flexatron#8809
Use Z_gettotalbalance

[26-Sep-18 10:57 AM] Flexatron#8809
Or download latest agama beta wallet

[26-Sep-18 10:58 AM] Iwither#3590
Imported privkey aswell, still shows 0

[26-Sep-18 10:58 AM] Iwither#3590
