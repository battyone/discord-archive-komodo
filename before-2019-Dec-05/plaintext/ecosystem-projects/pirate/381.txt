[dscrd-prt] <kp> tradeogre is awesome imo

[29-Oct-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> happy we are there

[29-Oct-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> i made some sweet buys there 😛

[29-Oct-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Flint> I managed to withdraw almost all ARRRs from the GRAVIEX exchange to AGAMA but the last transaction was frozen - the support service thawed the deposit but the withdrawal was still not open - I suspect that they just ran out of the required number of ARRR that's why I am looking for an alternative to graviex and looking at TradeOgre

[29-Oct-19 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptoon> Altsbit (digitalprice) has always been solid as well

[29-Oct-19 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptoon> Havent heard a bad thing from tradeogre either

[29-Oct-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Flint> there was only one problem for ARRR - liquidity and trading volumes for the acquisition of liquidity and everything is fine with the rest! ffefe

[29-Oct-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> I think it is a bit naive to say that being listed on exchanges is more or less irrelevant. Having the best tech in the world doesn't matter if no one knows about it. So while I also think tech, usability and use cases are the most important area, it's simply a fact that most crypto "users" are just buying and holding for speculative reasons - and that's not bad at all. They simply are a different type of users, but they also increase the visibility and the attractiveness of a coin and ultimately make it more known by talking about it and what not, attracting more and more users. Most of them will just hold, but a portion of it will start actually using the coins for payments and what not. Increasing usage requires both available use cases as well as people knowing about them. Both sides go hand in hand and both sides should get attention to some degree. E.g. hubi has only 22 coins listed with very few new listings, so getting listed there will catch many eyes of their users and give us good exposure on CMC and co. The current CMC page shows only tradeogre and graviex for ARRR, with graviex showing 0 volume and tradeogre showing 2500$ volume. Now imagine someone hearing about ARRR, many of them will go to CMC to check price, market cap and where it can be bought. Guess how many of them will give it a chance after seeing such a sad exchanges/markets list?

[29-Oct-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> Then there's the talk about fake volume and actual user numbers again. Yes most exchanges fake volume and yes that sucks. However, by actually looking at the liquidity and the activity of the order books you can get a good estimation if there's actually also a good amount of real volume or not. LBank had very little order book activity, i.e. likely very little real volume. Hubi does have good liquidity and a very active order book - of course no guarantee, but a very good estimation that they have a good amount of real volume and real users. Then there are also different measurements to guess the user base, such as similarweb visits as someone noted. For reference, similarweb shows 90k visits per month for LBank, 550k visits per month for Hubi and 2M visits per month for kucoin. And besides Hubi indicating to actually have a decent user base, 1 BTC listing fee is also low for the current market. As I see if we decline that chance it would be hard to justify paying for any exchange other than the top 5-10 known ones - and as we have seen so far not only would they charge a shit ton, they also won't list us for now for multiple reasons.

[29-Oct-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Flint> it seems that the TradeOgre order book is not empty - there is something to buy - its a sin not to buy at this price - I used to buy ARRR 10 times more expensive than the current price and therefore it’s inexcusable not to use this price sagging while the coin is underestimated - with the development of AtomicDEX, I think a happy future and demand awaits the coin - this is a digital offshore and not a joke

[29-Oct-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Mantrack> Honestly guys, I think the era where getting on new exchanges was a way to raise awareness is over

[29-Oct-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Mantrack> now there truly a HUGE amount of exchanges available

[29-Oct-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Mantrack> being listed on many small exchanges don't raise awareness much or at all

[29-Oct-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Mantrack> being listed on big exchanges with top volume can

[29-Oct-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Mantrack> so basically quality over quantity

[29-Oct-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> the real top exchanges aren't available for us at this time, simple as that

[29-Oct-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Oct-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> if community can raise the listing fee, then go ahead and list assuming they are technically competent

[29-Oct-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> anyone looking at this would deem the coin dead

[29-Oct-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Mantrack> can't we negotiate the listing fees? Latoken asking for 6 BTC is surprisingly high

[29-Oct-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> adding another exchange with 0 volumes wont help the impression

[29-Oct-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> 1BTC for a large exchange is not bad, relatively speaking

[29-Oct-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Mantrack> yes

[29-Oct-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> if hubi is really a quarter the users of kucoin and they are technically  competent, it might be worth a risk, but if their $1 billion per day volume is 99% fake, then it is 1BTC to list on a $10 mil per day exchange, only a small fraction of which will go to ARRR. if hubi requires KYC for withdraw, then who will actually use it?

[29-Oct-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> personally, i never heard of hubi until this discussion

[29-Oct-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> I think *if* we want to take the risk of paying a seemingly decently large exchange, it should be hubi

[29-Oct-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> if we don't want to pay for any listing in the future .. well fine

[29-Oct-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> assuming they pass mylynch technical test

[29-Oct-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> i stop nobody from paying for listings

[29-Oct-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Back from my meeting

[29-Oct-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> yes, the impression of their technical comptetence is also crucial of course

[29-Oct-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `can't we negotiate the listing fees?`
That really depends on the exchange; like james pointed out earlier, that's the main (if not only) revenue source so some just will not budge

[29-Oct-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> and at 1 BTC it is small enough that the community might be able to raise it.

[29-Oct-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @jl777c every time an exchange is considered,  @mrlynch is contacted and pulled into the discussion with the exchange itself

[29-Oct-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> _still thinks this should be a community thing and not an "official" thing_

[29-Oct-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Also,  it's .5 BTC and .25 BTC worth of ARRR

[29-Oct-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> oh?

[29-Oct-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> for hubi?

[29-Oct-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> even better

[29-Oct-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Yes

[29-Oct-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Read the announcement I made

[29-Oct-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> *poll

[29-Oct-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> and mylynch thinks they can handle it?

[29-Oct-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> if so, start raising funds for it

[29-Oct-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> would the previously collected 100k arrr be used for the arrr part?

[29-Oct-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> He hasn't been brought in yet. There's no point in involving him if the community says no anyways

[29-Oct-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @Diablo_ yes

[29-Oct-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> seems the next step is to make sure they are technically able

[29-Oct-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> regarding priorities may be makes no sense to directly market

[29-Oct-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> aarrr to random users

[29-Oct-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @Draeth are they on telegram or discord?

[29-Oct-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @mrlynch telegram

[29-Oct-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> ok, can we setup a group chat with them?

[29-Oct-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Flint> binance has already at least carefully scrutinized ARRR about listing, but attention alone costs a lot

[29-Oct-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> market to the users that use BTC mixers

[29-Oct-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> allocating some percentage of portfolio to ARRR should be a no brainer especially with Zatomic swaps on the horizon

[29-Oct-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> when it is ready, it can be more actively marketed to that crowd, but even now the concept can be introduced

[29-Oct-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Flint> a binance would be enough for liquidity and then AtomicDEX will start working as it should

[29-Oct-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> preferably via the top tier crypto sites

[29-Oct-19 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> 2 ideas: 1. make Arrr giveaway to dedicated users (hackers testing Arrr dpow, high profile crypto people to try anonimity) etc 2. focus on attracting activist/community builders -> community builders and activists will do the job , every activist coutns 100x the avg user

[29-Oct-19 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> binance listing is not very realistic

[29-Oct-19 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> reg 2. what Im saying forget about avg user totally, focus on super users who will attract avg users

[29-Oct-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @KOSIUS 👆 sharpen the knives and get on some wasabi vs samourai twitter fights

[29-Oct-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> it's like switching focus from b2c to b2b that will do b2c for us

[29-Oct-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> value of ARRR is not for the avg end user, that is true. go after the advanced users who care about privacy

[29-Oct-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> there is the "allocate small percentage of portfolio to ARRR" market among the people who want "offshore" accounts

[29-Oct-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> I think targeting mixer users is a great idea .. in theory. But in practice it will also be very hard, as 99% of the people just recommend the known mixers and would be very sceptical about ARRR, likely judged as some scammy shitcoin by most

[29-Oct-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> i believe that is what will be marketed at the pirate festival

[29-Oct-19 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> but that market is likely much easier to get after ARRR is the de factor trustless Zmixing champion

[29-Oct-19 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Flint> but they are writing off other Confederate coins that will be removed from other exchanges! They value Komodo and ARRR as part of an ecosystem, it can be interesting if trading volumes allow them to earn binance - this is the essence of their business - earning commissions and sufficient volumes in any market now or in the future

[29-Oct-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> @jl777c doesnt the entire atomicdex mixing procedure require a lot of liquidity for ARRR?

[29-Oct-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> you have it backwards

[29-Oct-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> or where can i read about it?

[29-Oct-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> the entire atomicDEX mixing process will bring a lot of liquidity for ARRR

[29-Oct-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> the way to do it is trade BTC for ARRR

[29-Oct-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> and then ARRR for BTC, or anything else

[29-Oct-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> what is there to read about?

[29-Oct-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> what i mean is, if the market cap of ARRR is too small, then that should cap the amount that is able to be mixed, no?

[29-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> I think both sides are correct

[29-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> if there are only a tiny amount of ARRR available to buy without pumping the price it will be hard to be used for mixing

[29-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> chicken egg problem

[29-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> yeah that was what i meant, probably worded it wrong

[29-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> evolution takes time

[29-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> but then again people wanting to mix using arrr will also bring liquidity, or at least demand which usually is followed by liquidity

[29-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> exactly @passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋

[29-Oct-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Flint> digital offshore is better than Monero and that’s it! People will still appreciate it - the time has not come yet but awareness will grow. Do not be lazy to help the project with reposts and likes in social networks and on thematic forums!

[29-Oct-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> true

[29-Oct-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> that's why I also say that increasing ARRR use cases, usability and user base all goes hand in hand and are correlated to each other

[29-Oct-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> we might need to have some community funds to ensure there is always 1 BTC of liquidity on both sides at low spreads

[29-Oct-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <FlyingDutchman> isnt that market manipulation

[29-Oct-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> not at all

[29-Oct-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> as long as there is always 1 BTC worth available, that will be enough for people to get a 1 BTC mix, which will lead to more BTC being on the ARRR orderbooks

[29-Oct-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> it would be a community market maker

[29-Oct-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> i like this a lot

[29-Oct-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> having orders on the orderbook is not manipulation, it is being a market maker

[29-Oct-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> Market makers usually get some sort of benefit, right?

[29-Oct-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> cipi already has mm2 marketmaker bots, so the tech is already there to provide whatever spread we want

[29-Oct-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> once we have mobile lite wallet with app for private texting we have product to market and liquidity should start building

[29-Oct-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> marketmakers make the bid/ask spread

[29-Oct-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <FlyingDutchman> @passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 that and zatomicex
