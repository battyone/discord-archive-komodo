@grewalsatinder u interested?

[29-Sep-18 07:53 AM] LocoMB#8593
you guys using escrow here?  a few of our regular peeps certainly would not need escrow ut I haven't been following adequately

[29-Sep-18 07:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Hot yes I'm only interested to sell. you buying?

[29-Sep-18 07:54 AM] 0x03#8822
@LocoMB not yet i think, but i dont think anybody will not want it either if a party asks to do so

[29-Sep-18 07:54 AM] Hot#2427
@grewalsatinder seems like we are both interested in selling 😂

[29-Sep-18 07:55 AM] Hot#2427
peace to you, my pirate brother

[29-Sep-18 07:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
exactly 😄 👍

[29-Sep-18 07:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the only problem I've had with escrow is finding a neutral, mutually-trusted 3rd party that is also willing to do the work

[29-Sep-18 07:57 AM] 0x03#8822
i don't see why anybody should trust me (yet) but i'll happily do escrow

[29-Sep-18 07:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[29-Sep-18 07:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The irony of PIRATE is that I've found that there are more people that trust me than like me

[29-Sep-18 07:58 AM] 0x03#8822
eh, thats a strange compliment

[29-Sep-18 07:58 AM] 0x03#8822
but a compliment nevertheless 😛

```WTS 2500 PIRATE @ 0.095 KMD

(tell me if the formatting sux, i can remove it still)

[29-Sep-18 08:00 AM] 0x03#8822
but that kind of catches attention also while scrolling up for older prices

[29-Sep-18 08:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
only recieved 1 private messge, and that too doesn't accept 0.1 KMD price

[29-Sep-18 08:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
even for 1000 PIRATE @ 0.1 kmd price

[29-Sep-18 08:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so how do I trust there are 0.1 KMD price market in private messages ?

[29-Sep-18 08:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

ummm ... maybe this can also go here instead of noob channel 
yesterday I upgraded to Agama 42c and I completely synched Pirate in native mode, and did  nothing else with it.
today I start Agama but Pirate does not appear in the coin list on the entry screen- and only 6 or 7 coins in total, same on Lite mode..- does anyone have a hint for me?

[29-Sep-18 08:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
support must be of some help

[29-Sep-18 08:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there is no Lite mode for PIRATE

[29-Sep-18 08:15 AM] LocoMB#8593
I'll remove it an reinstallm, then ask in support

[29-Sep-18 08:15 AM] LocoMB#8593
I know- I had it running in naitve

What is the difference to zcash?

The protection via Bitcoin Hashrate, scaling and speed? 

What are the advantages of Pirate?

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 cool! thanks for trade 👍

@LocoMB `rm -rf ~/.agama` did the trick for me btw

[29-Sep-18 08:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@0x03 dangerous command, wallet.dat backup is must

[29-Sep-18 08:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I do think that this kind of trades would get messy af if more than 1 pair tried it at once

[29-Sep-18 08:21 AM] 0x03#8822
@grewalsatinder i'm not going to think for people. also a find on ~/.agama showed anything but `wallet.dat` which is in ~/.komodo

[29-Sep-18 08:21 AM] Seko#7408
Why exactly is Pirate better than all other privacy coins?

[29-Sep-18 08:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@0x03 oh yes, I overlooked... true

[29-Sep-18 08:22 AM] Acura#2748
@Seko look in Telegram

[29-Sep-18 08:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Seko because privacy is forced, it's the z part of zcash with the added benefit of no one ever knowing what chunks are moved without you actively telling them
and because it's Komodo, it's better than zcash, anyway

but mainly what computergenie said

[29-Sep-18 08:26 AM] LocoMB#8593
ha! 😈 to rephrase that then: Why is Komodo a better coin than Pirate then?! ⚖

[29-Sep-18 08:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it can do crypto-conditons smart contract and tradeable on BarterDEX.

[29-Sep-18 08:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and is the main delayed Proof of Work source for all other blockchains in ecosystem

[29-Sep-18 08:29 AM] LocoMB#8593
👍 well- Komodo is the Pirate Bay :realpirate:  ⛵ ⛵ 🛳 🏖 🏖 :realpirate: so to speak

[29-Sep-18 08:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Why is Komodo a better coin than Pirate then?!`
Q. Why is a hamburger better than a steak?
A. context - neither is "better", sometimes you want a burger, sometimes you want a steak

[29-Sep-18 08:35 AM] 0x03#8822
now i'm hungry

[29-Sep-18 08:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

good thing that mcd breakfast time ended 5min ago

[29-Sep-18 08:36 AM] 0x03#8822
so 20 more and they'llhave burgers ready 🤣

[29-Sep-18 08:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
heh, we don't have one of those pink-stuff selling places within an hr of here

[29-Sep-18 08:37 AM] 0x03#8822
oh, disclaimer: i usually prefer doing them myself, as much as i can produce myself. ask cipi, he tried them already 🤣

[29-Sep-18 08:37 AM] 0x03#8822
its just sometimes mcd ...its there and full of geschmacksverstaerker to make you regret it afterwards

[29-Sep-18 08:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
All that stuff that you wouldn't eat = the pink shit they make their burgers out of

'luckily' BK fucked up once, big time (biggest contractor was busted of ....you name it)

[29-Sep-18 08:39 AM] 0x03#8822
mainly hygiene/food quality issues

[29-Sep-18 08:40 AM] 0x03#8822
so since that happened we can kind of be sure that at least McD is selling half decent meat

[29-Sep-18 08:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
since it's cattle trimmings, pink stuff still counts as "100% all beef" 😉

[29-Sep-18 08:41 AM] 0x03#8822
if we are very unlucky we'll get some overseas quality of meat soon too

[29-Sep-18 08:43 AM] 0x03#8822
the pink shit is what we call 'seperatorenfleisch' i think
