[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @napa no worries. I understand your comments and they are valid

[21-Oct-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> maybe not for you big baller, and its not a lot for me too but am sensible enough to know its a bunch of money for a majority of the population. and just to show how disconcerted you are for reality mr big baller, i grew up in the project, and made it out. a lot of my family is still there and 23k is a bunch of money for them and some earn btw 25k-30k a yr

[21-Oct-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 👴🏼📢.... so you're saying that you were put into a lamp? :trollface:

[21-Oct-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> then u willknow that 23k is a lot of money. cos it stops been a lot for you those not mean its so for a majority of the poulation and  what you prob consider as a lot of money is also chicken shit to someone else.

[21-Oct-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> PS- project folks have more inherent opportunities than were ever afforded to me

[21-Oct-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `then u willknow that 23k is a lot of money.`
I know no such thing, because I understand basic economics and inflation

[21-Oct-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> so i guess 100k is alot of money to you then? cos that like 2k for someones else. anyway, why am i having this convo. take care mr baller.

[21-Oct-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> that you are here says you either have disposable income or are a poor manager of money
If you have disposable income, then you should understand the larger values of currency

[21-Oct-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Realistically,  the amount of money $25k is to a person depends on where you are, hiow much you currently have and the opportunities immediately available to you

[21-Oct-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> exactly

[21-Oct-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `so i guess 100k is alot of money to you then?`
In most regions of the US, that doesn't even buy you 1/3rd of a home; so, no, it's not

[21-Oct-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `the amount of money $25k is to a person depends on where you are`
👆🏽 It buys a home with acreage in some, not even a full year of rent in others

[21-Oct-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> i always find it funny when i run into ppl that make a little money and then act like there shit don't stink. @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 👴🏼📢 i bet 23k was a lot of money to you when you got out of that prison cell. well, guess what a lot of ppl are still in that position and all have not been lucky enough to make it out like you did.

[21-Oct-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `i bet 23k was a lot of money to you when you got out of that prison cell. `
That it would go a long way does not make it "a lot of money".
Free your mind of the chains of perception you wear. 😉 
PS- luck had nothing to do with it; hard work, determination, and living within my means got me to where my crypto start began

[21-Oct-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `guess what a lot of ppl are still in that position`
and 99.99999% of them do not live within their means

[21-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> final comment cos this is a stupid discussion but am originally from Africa, a few of us migrated to the states with limited opportunity. i happen to be one of the few that attain some form of success, but the rest of my family is hardworking and making by with what they can. Crypto is  global situation. 23k is a lot of money for someone scrapping by in Nigeria where am originally from. 23k is a bunch of money for my uncle in america who has limited English ability and has a custodial job. he works very hard. so get off your fucking high horse and qui with the bs, cos b/c you lucky to make a little change doesn't mean its so for a majority of the population. also, what you and your lil change might consider big money is prob nothing to someone else. take care mr baller

[21-Oct-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <camthegeek> A bit hostile with your point, but it's clear you're thinking on a global scale vs national.

[21-Oct-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> sorry like i said i find it funny when i run into ppl that make a lil money and act like their shit don't stink. i will drop the convo cos it serves no use to the project at hand

[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> So..... hows the weather by wherever you all are at?

[21-Oct-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <camthegeek> I mean, 20k is a lot. But it's a drop in the bucket for some. Insert that 'perspective' image here.

[21-Oct-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <camthegeek> (and use that same image in ANY situation)

[21-Oct-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> likewise a million is a lot but a drop in the bucket for some

[21-Oct-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> @napa I'll bet you 1000 KMD that anyone in the US that thinks $23k is "a lot/bunch of money" irresponsibly spends that much in 3 years time (we will not even get into the cost of living difference in Nigeria where it's significantly lower)

You seem to confuse "doing what one needs to do" with "doing what one wants to do" (as do most people that see $23k as "a lot/bunch of money")

[21-Oct-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <camthegeek> @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 👴🏼📢 I know quite a few fast food workers that are in to crypto. Let's not take a look at their salary 😛

[21-Oct-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> my uncle is  a custodian and barely makes 25k a yr. so yes 23 k is a lot for him and he lives in america and tries to live within his means. sorry everyone does not have the opportunities you were exposed to. By the way, i could use the same sentiment, and say that only a dumbass ends up in jail but i been there and know that its not true cos life sometimes throw you curveballs you can't handle. even my current co-workers who make above 6 figures a yr, have multiple kids, a house and bills to pay and it will be hard for most to just easily cough up 20k, so yeah its a lot for the majority. and like you said usa, and crypto is not localized to us. its a global scenario. all of arrr members are not from us, and everyone is not ballling like you. anyway, since you got it like that, am sure @Draeth or any other dev wouldn't mind providing you with a donation address to give the project 23k, we all will really appreciate it and it could be put to good use towards improving the project

[21-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> @camthegeek he is one of those ppl that a few dollars he made went to his head. u tend to see it in ppl who never expected themselve to be rich. everyone does not have the opportunity to go to school/gain a vocational training cos life threw them some curve ball. some of my friends who are felons for dealng weed can't get a job even if they got the education, so again get off you high horse, or maybe stay on it an ddonate some money to our donation fund. the arrr family will really appreciate it

[21-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Ok,  let's end this topic, as it's not pirate related anymore

[21-Oct-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> As others have said everyone has their own perspective how much is "a lot" of money. It's useless to discuss this. I think most of us agree though that collecting 23k $ in community donations wouldn't be easy for us and thus should be well spent.

[21-Oct-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> On an actual pirate related note, let's think of initiatives we can take to increase our exposure

[21-Oct-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763

show me a single person in the US that doesn't have the "opportunity" of living on the street and "showering" in the rain.... and I'll donate them 10k ARRR

[21-Oct-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> PS: regarding marketing. The best way to spend bucks imo is for a decent exchange listing (if we get such a chance) which not only acts as "marketing" but also gives ARRR more usage/liquidity etc.

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `The best way to spend bucks imo is for a decent exchange listing (if we get such a chance) which not only acts as "marketing" but also gives ARRR more usage/liquidity etc.`
I'm sort of in agreeance, except for the fact that I've never really been convinced that multiple non-KYC/AML exchanges actually provide any utility

[21-Oct-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> anyone remember the reddit spam DMs right before ETH's huge bull run?

[21-Oct-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <camthegeek> I'd honestly not push for more exchanges; but start marketing everything you have so far. You can buy [items] with ARRR. You can use ARRR from your [device] with [wallet]. Reach out, cross lines with other communities to attract people from there to here.

[21-Oct-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Fyi we've applied to over a dozen big exchanges recently

[21-Oct-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> Well it is a barrier for many people to start using small and mostly unknown exchanges as those we are listed on. If we list on another one with a decent user base, they can start buying arrr right on their exchange.

[21-Oct-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `You can buy [items] with ARRR. `
imo 👆🏽 that is still **everything** in a viable crypto

[21-Oct-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> we *definitely* need better exchanges as right now liquidity sucks and spreads are awful...no idea how anyone could argue against that

[21-Oct-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <camthegeek> Spreading out your market (buy/sell) isn't very helpful when it's quite tiny as is. It's typically the same people buying/selling daily (or bots). You need fresh faces, which typically comes from marketing (social media marketing is typically free!).

[21-Oct-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> New exchanges call get us more exposure too

[21-Oct-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <camthegeek> They're the easiest route to it, but also quite the more expensive route

[21-Oct-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> rather than spending money on pbs etc, i would say we try to get a large sum like that and turn it it into arrr. and start paying/gifting whatever you want to call it for detailed you tube /vimeo or generalized education videos. we can create a tip bot that generates a certain amount of fund according to the engagement a video has and also maybe have a maunal qr that verifies that the engagements are organic.

[21-Oct-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> Exchange markets keep it a commodity
If the want is for it to be an actual currency, then there must be actual utility beyond novelty items
Can I buy food with it? Can I buy "normal" clothes with it? Can I pay bills with it? <- these are the things that all need to be answered with a "Yes!"
Like someone said earlier, "Can I pay for a tow with it?"

[21-Oct-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> "You need fresh faces, which typically comes from marketing"
I think listing on exchanges is some of the best marketing for us. Possibly a few thousand crypto users will read the announcement of the listing and maybe look closer into ARRR (either because they want to make quick bucks from price swings at listing or to check if it is an interesting project). e.g. I have only heard about ARRR from the cryptobridge listing, if it wasn't listed there I would have likely still not heard about ARRR.

[21-Oct-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <camthegeek> I've been actively involved in 3 different crypto-communities and getting exchange listings. The amount of traffic GAINED from listings is typically less than the traffic gained from a twitter message spread across many people, or a few good informative posts on bitcointalk, or even some good reddit posts that get crossposted. All 3 of those methods require a tiny bit of time and a tiny bit of collaboration from community members to spread the word. They're more effect at attracting and don't attract the wrong crowds.

[21-Oct-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> well if you want to buy goods with arrr, then you need another layer that not currently available. someone needs to provide a website that uses the aforementioned integration and use only arrr. i.e a site where you can order anything from amazon, newegg etc using an instant arrr conversion to fiat. i can't code it, but if one of you have the technical know how. then plz proceed

[21-Oct-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <camthegeek> I've watched one of these coins literally get bossed around by a China group that invested into their coin. It's pitiful to watch. These people from exchanges are typically driven by coin value instead of what the coin does.

[21-Oct-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> @Diablo_ exchanges are good but with the whole governmental scrutinty, i wonder if its worth it. can't imagine paying sevral thousand to an exchange, just for them to close in a yr without no refund

[21-Oct-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> It is very hard to get tweets, reddit posts etc. past the borders of our community. I would say our community is somewhat active on the social media channels, but probably 99% of the times it is just other arrr users liking, retweeting etc.

[21-Oct-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <camthegeek> That's why I said cross lines with other communities.

[21-Oct-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> if you offer them an incentives they will come. thus the reason i say the fund for something like pbs will really reach far for providing incentive for education post/engagement. ppl will do a lotjust to gain 1-2 dollars in tips.

[21-Oct-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> that means if the community ever agrees to donate such a fund

[21-Oct-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `It is very hard to get tweets, reddit posts etc. past the borders of our community.`
Objectively, why would they care? Most people are just beginning to grasp the concept of why privacy matters, so the rest of them can't see any distinction between ARRR and 30 million other coins/tokens

[21-Oct-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <KOSIUS> While we're on the topic of marketing, I've contacted a few crypto news websites aswell

[21-Oct-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> Yes, getting past our community is hard. As you say, it isn't surprising that people not knowing ARRR don't care about anything we post, the chances are good that they just consider it another shitcoin.

[21-Oct-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> @polycryptoblog so does purse.io have a money transmitter license? cos i have used it to purchase with bitcoin, but their fees are ridiculous. Also, wondering if its possible to bypass such law by basing the business in a different country with lenient regulations.

[21-Oct-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> i also have moon and have used it a few times but i was think more of something similar to purse rather than an extension like moon

[21-Oct-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <polycryptoblog> Moon is behind LibertyX , they are “sponsored”.  Purse.io is a different format,  haven’t used it in awhile but if I remember right it’s a matching service, it doesn’t do the exchange from crypto to fiat itself

[21-Oct-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <polycryptoblog> Person wants something , btc put in escrow , other person purchases the thing wanted , when completed btc gets released.   Biggest difference is the other person isn’t accepting your btc, converting  to cash and then buying the requested item

[21-Oct-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> @polycryptoblog yeah come to think about it you right. its more matching. it does not do a direct convert. anyway, there is prob a country where you can base this and bypass the loophole. Might be good idea for me to investigate it.
