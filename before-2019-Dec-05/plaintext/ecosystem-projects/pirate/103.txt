There comes a point in every young chain's life where people begin to troll `When Lambo?`, since Lambo was last Thursday, what are we supposed to `When ....?` now? :coolpirate:

Too close to the slums of AC for me :trollface:

[03-Oct-18 05:52 AM] matt#3084
does anyone use the portable wallet?

[03-Oct-18 05:52 AM] matt#3084
agama

[03-Oct-18 05:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As opposed to one that needs an oil tanker?

[03-Oct-18 05:52 AM] matt#3084
as oppossed to the one that has a windows installer..

[03-Oct-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Only use portable here

[03-Oct-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181

ah ok.. do you have to 'activate' the coin each time u open it?

{Reactions}
👍 

[03-Oct-18 05:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have it on my new computer though because its take a while to figure out how to set the CPU voltage with P states .... Gigabyte for some reason decided not to have a CPU vcore setting on their flasgship RYZEN motherboard ... lol

[03-Oct-18 05:54 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Lol I liked living in brigantine haha lived behind the wawa there.

[03-Oct-18 05:54 AM] matt#3084
seems like i do and then it has to sync the entire blockchain everytime I open it even after is has done that already multiple times

[03-Oct-18 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it shouod not do that, if you are on the latest version

[03-Oct-18 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there was a PIRATE hardfork...

[03-Oct-18 05:55 AM] matt#3084
0.2.42c

[03-Oct-18 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah thats right

[03-Oct-18 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it definatly should only activate not sync the whole chain

[03-Oct-18 05:56 AM] CHMEX#0686
@0x03 
Can you host PIRATE aswell here? bootstrap.0x03.services

[03-Oct-18 05:57 AM] matt#3084
well I'm going to d/l the windows installer version to see if that helps..

[03-Oct-18 05:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`seems like i do and then it has to sync the entire blockchain everytime I open it even after is has done that already multiple times`
@matt It doesn't download any blocks while offline, so each time you open it, it will rescan the last x blocks you do have, and then sync all the blocks you do not

[03-Oct-18 05:58 AM] matt#3084
it starts at 1 each time I open it

[03-Oct-18 05:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😐

[03-Oct-18 05:59 AM] matt#3084
and i have to 'activate' the coin each time I open it.. I was suprised my balance was there

[03-Oct-18 06:00 AM] matt#3084
do I need to select a daemon param?  options are none, background process, reindexing blocks from disk, rescan, gen. .

[03-Oct-18 06:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and i have to 'activate' the coin each time I open it.`
That is just to say that you want to "open" or "use" CoinX

[03-Oct-18 06:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
leave param as default

[03-Oct-18 06:02 AM] matt#3084
ok reopeneidn it.. started at block 10023 this time.. even tho I just did all 49k or whatever it is..

[03-Oct-18 06:03 AM] matt#3084
next question when I send KMD to get that 777 pirate, do I just use the zaddress?

[03-Oct-18 06:03 AM] matt#3084
oh nvm I see a KMD deposit address

[03-Oct-18 06:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's possible that you/it started a rescan at one point and it didn't finish, in which case it will attempt to do it the next time as well (and everytime until it's allowed to finish)

[03-Oct-18 06:06 AM] matt#3084
probably.  I'll rescan it all then close it and open it again to see what happens..

[03-Oct-18 06:06 AM] Flexatron#8809
Can you close agama after hitting send?

[03-Oct-18 06:06 AM] Flexatron#8809
Takes way longer now

[03-Oct-18 06:07 AM] Flexatron#8809
Last time 257 s

[03-Oct-18 06:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Can you close agama after hitting send?`
You *can*, but that doesn't mean you *should*

[03-Oct-18 06:07 AM] Flexatron#8809
Processing is client side?

[03-Oct-18 06:08 AM] Flexatron#8809
Or partly

[03-Oct-18 06:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
most likely, especially if it's a PIRATE z send

[03-Oct-18 06:08 AM] Flexatron#8809
Yea

[03-Oct-18 06:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
depending on complexity, z txes can take a while

[03-Oct-18 06:10 AM] Flexatron#8809
1157 s

[03-Oct-18 06:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can tell you how to make if **much** faster, but it requires work on your part

[03-Oct-18 06:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Remove Windows, install Linux, and use the daemon to maintain your coinage instead of the GUI

[03-Oct-18 06:16 AM] matt#3084
guis are nice

[03-Oct-18 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
never use them any more

[03-Oct-18 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wait no I do for KMD spv lfor my personal wallet, find it slower tham cli though

[03-Oct-18 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
better than running a full kmd node on laptop but

[03-Oct-18 06:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`guis are nice`
They are, but, they lack many many functions (even the best GUI leaves options and commands out)

[03-Oct-18 06:19 AM] matt#3084
true.. well maybe I'll switch.. I'm just going to aquire 10k of these and chill.. hopefully it goes up in $$

[03-Oct-18 06:20 AM] matt#3084

moving to CLI opens up a can of worms... once you learn what is possible you will have no life 😂

[03-Oct-18 06:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_will be up-pricing his sells starting tomorrow_

[03-Oct-18 06:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$40 in beer coolers, $30 in duct work, $50 in fans to make $30 👍🏼

[03-Oct-18 06:23 AM] matt#3084
yeah maybe not the best move.. BUT DCR will make a comeback one day!

[03-Oct-18 06:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
So will the Ford Model T :trollface:

[03-Oct-18 06:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Jokes aside, I wouldn't anyway; imo, it should go to someone that "needs" it

[03-Oct-18 06:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my hope is that the winner has 0 hash

[03-Oct-18 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
7000 PIRATE per Msol at 50 Msol network, 9000 PIRATE per Msol at 40 Msol network

It’s getting rough in these waters.

[03-Oct-18 06:37 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Didn’t I read that half of supply would be mined in first year or something along those lines?

[03-Oct-18 06:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Pirate is super hot right now

[03-Oct-18 06:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the macbook starts to overheat`
Well, that's a combination of 2 things:
1) It's a Mac
2) z txes are CPU intensive to create

[03-Oct-18 06:45 AM] actionslacks#4072
About 7 times the difficulty of zencash which is # 70 on cmc
