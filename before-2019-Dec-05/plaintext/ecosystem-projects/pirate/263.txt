Actual market cap is around 4million $, that kind of project should be more about 50-200 millions by end 2019 in my opinion.

Hello there. I just learnt about pirate and I would like to get some.   I see that they currently sell for 1KMD = 6.6667 PIRATE, has this price changed or its been like this since the launch?

[04-Nov-18 11:45 AM] lluisin#7655
what's the max supply, currently supply, etc?

[04-Nov-18 11:48 AM] Oszy#5734
Hello.

[04-Nov-18 11:49 AM] Oszy#5734
That price is matching the ask price on the exchange. It has been more and less as well before. 
You can use onboarding for small amounts, if you want to buy more, visit the exchange at https://digitalprice.io/?inviter=f6d942 and place your order in the orderbook. 
Max supply is 200Million, current supply is block height * 256

[04-Nov-18 11:51 AM] lluisin#7655
Many thanks for the info

😄  finally, that guy who planed to launch another PIRATE with great privacy, like Monero fork or Dash (like he planed in the begining), did it. But did it with SCRYPT 😂

I asked jl777 a few backs about copycat forks. many will create forks, but none will have the dPoW done by the notary nodes that secure pirate onto BTC's blockchain. The absolute privacy + btc security is why I believe ARRR is truly unique.

this isn't even a fork copy just a name copy trying to get advantage of pirate's success

pos + masternode on scrypt i don't know who's still interested in that.
