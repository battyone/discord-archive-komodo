@jl777c mentioned it’s feasibility and requirements for constant updating... but is anyone doing it?  💪

[27-Sep-18 02:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"working on an api" implies there's something to hook *to*

[27-Sep-18 02:17 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Forgive my lack of technical knowledge.   I’m a@fucking idiot when it comes to a lot of this stuff.

[27-Sep-18 02:17 AM] FishyGuts#5085
He mentioned we would have to update it daily.

[27-Sep-18 02:18 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Just based on OTC trading action for now.

[27-Sep-18 02:18 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Maybe there’s a way to label trades in #deleted-channel so that it can draw data from there.

[27-Sep-18 02:18 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Like pulling data from specific post formatting.

[27-Sep-18 02:19 AM] FishyGuts#5085
$WTB could trigger a pull on the data or something ?

[27-Sep-18 02:19 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I’m not a computer genie so maybe I’m dreaming or being too complex

[27-Sep-18 02:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can slap up a web page that pulls a few coins and gives a list of what the equivalents would be based on a static average OTC price, if that's what you mean

[27-Sep-18 02:20 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Just looking for PIRATE price.

[27-Sep-18 02:20 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So their calculator knows what to value the coins being generated at

[27-Sep-18 02:20 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If pirate was on bdex this would be easy. 😜

[27-Sep-18 02:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Just looking for PIRATE price.`
You have to peg it to *something* in order to have a "price"

[27-Sep-18 02:21 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So btc or kmd.  Right?

[27-Sep-18 02:21 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Since most calculators are done in btc.... I assume there’s a way to translate the KMD price (since most sales are KMD) into a BTC equivalent for them?

[27-Sep-18 02:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was thinking KMD, SUPERNET, DEX, REVS, and a few other assetchains as well as maybe BTC

[27-Sep-18 02:22 AM] ecbuddy#8524
hello...

[27-Sep-18 02:22 AM] ecbuddy#8524
how does one buy pirate?

[27-Sep-18 02:22 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yeah cool.  You’re the genie on this.   If you have ideas to make it better faster stronger... ducking do it!

[27-Sep-18 02:22 AM] ecbuddy#8524
i was looking at it earlier, and thought its something i might want to be part of

[27-Sep-18 02:22 AM] ecbuddy#8524
also, cpu mining?

[27-Sep-18 02:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ecbuddy there's a 15KMD deal going on in #deleted-channel or you can make an OTC deal with someone

[27-Sep-18 02:22 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@ecbuddy currently@all@pirate trades are done OTC.  You can rent from nicehash to mine or mine yourself as well.

[27-Sep-18 02:23 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Also the pinned messages has the info for the 15KMd deal.

[27-Sep-18 02:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
CPU mining PIRATE is a "no"

[27-Sep-18 02:23 AM] ecbuddy#8524
gpu?

[27-Sep-18 02:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure GPU is even of much value atm

[27-Sep-18 02:23 AM] ecbuddy#8524
lol?

[27-Sep-18 02:23 AM] ecbuddy#8524
isn't this thing brand new?

[27-Sep-18 02:23 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It’s Equihash so Z9s are best but GPU willl probably still be more profitable than other coins.

[27-Sep-18 02:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We will hopefully be on mining calculators here shortly.

[27-Sep-18 02:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the current block difficulty of PIRATE is close to the current block diff of KMD

[27-Sep-18 02:24 AM] ecbuddy#8524
interesting

[27-Sep-18 02:24 AM] ecbuddy#8524
how old is the project?

[27-Sep-18 02:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
True but the coin emission ratio is higher than what you can buy pirate for with KMD correct?   Speaking on a possible daily mining yield perspective.  

About one month @ecbuddy

[27-Sep-18 02:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`We will hopefully be on mining calculators here shortly.`
I can make a hash to block find calc on my site in the morning if you want one

[27-Sep-18 02:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I’m doing it for exposure and new stowaways.

[27-Sep-18 02:26 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Your time is better spent on other things too I imagine.

[27-Sep-18 02:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, other than making it pretty, it doesn't take that long 😛

[27-Sep-18 02:26 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Unless you think it’s useful.   Again. I don’t know shit.

[27-Sep-18 02:26 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We will spam it for you on social media.  👍

[27-Sep-18 02:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mining calc is just some simple math

[27-Sep-18 02:27 AM] FishyGuts#5085
True add in some variables and you’ve got your calculator.

[27-Sep-18 02:27 AM] FishyGuts#5085
You should make a mining calc site and sell ads then!  😜

[27-Sep-18 02:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol spamming my site would make people be like "wtf? 😣 "

[27-Sep-18 02:28 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Hey man.  I’m here to support the ecosystem whether you’re on a sloop or a galleon.

[27-Sep-18 02:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[27-Sep-18 02:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$100 a month and I have 1 page for personal use  😂

[27-Sep-18 02:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
anywho, I'm off to 🛏 for a nap

[27-Sep-18 02:36 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Who does the Agama wallet updating?   Can we add a “night mode” or “pirate mode” just to make it black and look more piratey?  Thanks @Regnar for the idea.

[27-Sep-18 02:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
👆

[27-Sep-18 02:51 AM] actionslacks#4072
What he said

[27-Sep-18 03:20 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So.    Serious question....   
Who here would donate a z9 mining pirate for 24 hours for a rig giveaway exposure contest?

I am putting all 10 of my rigs up.  9 minis and a big.   
24 hours.  5 winners.

Any additional z9s will be distributed evenly amongst the winners or perhaps I will add more to the winners list.  

The last time I did this for KMD it garnered 77k interactions.

[27-Sep-18 03:22 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Fishyguts you are the man.. just sayin

[27-Sep-18 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@ecbuddy  I put Z9 minis on PIRATE on the second day I think it was, and mined 100% of the supply for a while, which made a few people annoyed, and started a HASH WAR! Which has since gone totally out of control, and created one of the funniest meme coins ever! Its actually a thing now.

[27-Sep-18 03:22 AM] Dr Debt#0891
ok I gotta update my wallet and buy some pirate

[27-Sep-18 03:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think pirate is gonna be a big thing soon.

[27-Sep-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I agree .... my amins issue with its was the stupid coins supply ...

[27-Sep-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now thats fixed

[27-Sep-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it can really go places... if it can have spling merged in...

[27-Sep-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and a darknet market

[27-Sep-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🌕

[27-Sep-18 03:27 AM] actionslacks#4072
So sapling would enable easier mobile transactions?

[27-Sep-18 03:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[27-Sep-18 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the current sprot based Z transactions, require an incredible amount of processing power, that pool of webworkers is destroying his server.

[27-Sep-18 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it just cannot take it

[27-Sep-18 03:30 AM] actionslacks#4072
Wasn’t there a bunch of other bs being proposed to be thrown in with it? I guess we could pick and choose the features required though.

[27-Sep-18 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, we need to wait for Verus to port it in and see how they go with that. Mike is very talented so once he has done that, I would say he would understand exactly what does what. All we want for pirate is the faster transactions, becasue at the moment its almost unualsble for commerce.

[27-Sep-18 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
A high volume exchange or a marketplace with lots of withdraws, would criple the best infrustructure.

J/k.  I appreciate when you all talk about stuff in this fashion.  It helps me learn more about it and god damn am I eager to learn more.

[27-Sep-18 04:03 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Just curious as to if it would be better to rent some mining power or just buy some pirate?

@cz_binance Would you add a coin to @binance which can only do zk-SNARK tx but no transparent tx at all?

Hi all.  Looking to generate a Pirate wallet.  Only instructions I have found are for Linux.  I'm on Win10.  Have Agama.  Any instructions available.  Thanks.

[27-Sep-18 05:58 AM] Flexatron#8809
Activate pirate in native mode, wait 20-30 mins

[27-Sep-18 05:58 AM] Flexatron#8809
Selling 10K for 500 KMD, can send in 13h

I don't see pirate in the list of options available.  I just updated Agama a few days ago to 2.41d

[27-Sep-18 06:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It's undetermined @Paul

[27-Sep-18 06:14 AM] Paul#0981
So can I still send tomorrow to get the 777?

[27-Sep-18 06:15 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I can't say for certain.

[27-Sep-18 06:15 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Do you have your zaddr now or no access until tomorrow?

[27-Sep-18 06:16 AM] actionslacks#4072
Wasn’t the goal 100 people?

@FishyGuts Ok install Agama now and send 15 Kmd from Binance.
