I include ZEC

[24-Sep-18 05:34 PM] jorian#4555
wondering how zcash is doing indeed

[24-Sep-18 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
there is less than 5 million ZEC

[24-Sep-18 05:40 PM] Flexatron#8809
120$ a pop

[24-Sep-18 05:48 PM] scubapanda#2485
So I guess I'm on a fork and need to recompile the right stuff.

[24-Sep-18 05:50 PM] SHossain#0007
master branch will work too

[24-Sep-18 05:50 PM] scubapanda#2485
git checkout dev
Already on 'dev'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/dev'.

[24-Sep-18 05:51 PM] scubapanda#2485
300ksol is on the same chain with me according to getmininginfo.

[24-Sep-18 05:52 PM] scubapanda#2485
Should I just delete the blockchain and see what get reloaded?

[24-Sep-18 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[24-Sep-18 05:55 PM] SHossain#0007
keep a backup of your wallet.dat or privkey

[24-Sep-18 05:56 PM] scubapanda#2485
Thanks, I will!

[24-Sep-18 06:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so what's the buy price offers now?

[24-Sep-18 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i saw some sells at 0.05, buy at 0.015

[24-Sep-18 06:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, I'm okay to buy at 0.015 price too 🙂

[24-Sep-18 06:14 PM] tuppydog#8084
hey guys, how do I update my windows pirate wallet?  Do I just stop the chain and restart it?  Or do I need to download an updated zip file for komodo_win_master?  Thanks for any info!

[24-Sep-18 07:00 PM] Decker#3767
Latest komodo beta branch compiled for Windows.

[24-Sep-18 07:14 PM] scubapanda#2485
Does Agama support PIRATE now?

[24-Sep-18 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
about 10 million now, max will be about 200 million

[24-Sep-18 07:15 PM] SHossain#0007
@scubapanda next release of Agama will support PIRATE

we have been testing the dev version and PIRATE works fine using Agama. i also used it to send and receive funds.

[24-Sep-18 07:18 PM] SHossain#0007
`Node Connections: 31`

[24-Sep-18 07:21 PM] Flexatron#8809
That would kick ass

[24-Sep-18 07:21 PM] Flexatron#8809
Hate using cmd

[24-Sep-18 07:23 PM] SHossain#0007
using CMD makes you an advanced user

[24-Sep-18 07:24 PM] SHossain#0007

Ok, deleted ../Library/Application Support/Komodo/PIRATE. Recompiled everything to a new location. Clearly on the new branch "PIRATE halving changed to 388885 270.1 days". After restarting komodod with PIRATE parameters log gets filled with "ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: joinsplit requirements not met." Any ideas what to try next?

Look at the no. of workers

[24-Sep-18 07:36 PM] Flexatron#8809
Lmao

[24-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Flexatron#8809
Why does pirate tell 8 nodes compared to 31 of shossain? :)

[24-Sep-18 07:40 PM] SHossain#0007
if you are using home node, it can be normal

[24-Sep-18 07:40 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm using dedicated server and i accept connection

[24-Sep-18 07:41 PM] SHossain#0007
so, more nodes can connect to mine and sync the chain.

[24-Sep-18 07:46 PM] SHossain#0007
after i opened port on my Notary Nodes, i have 22 & 18 connections

[24-Sep-18 07:46 PM] SHossain#0007
before opening 8

[24-Sep-18 07:54 PM] Flexatron#8809

@jorian @blackjok3r @webworker01 how about if we extend the 250,000 PIRATE airdrop acceptence until end of next month? More users will be able to participate.
And, extending the Logo submission date until 14th of October and we announce the winner of Logo competition.
The 10,000 PIRATE I offered can be used for signature campaign on BTCTalk forum. I need someone to manage the signature campaing for me. Anyone available to volunteer for this task?

[24-Sep-18 08:07 PM] Meyse#0952
There is an airdrop?

[24-Sep-18 08:08 PM] Alright#0419
@grewalsatinder still buying?

[24-Sep-18 08:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Alright yes

[24-Sep-18 08:10 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alright probably put in some nicehash 😃

[24-Sep-18 08:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Difficulty at 8.8 million now`
Network diff or actual block diff?

there was a required update today

[24-Sep-18 08:18 PM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 make sure you are running latest source from today

[24-Sep-18 08:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@wookie NH uses an algorithm to set share diff, which means that often times the min submitted is way higher than need be

[24-Sep-18 08:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
k, my build isn't today, it's Friday, I think

[24-Sep-18 08:19 PM] SHossain#0007

you can update without stopping any other chain or komodod

[24-Sep-18 08:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not if I want shit to work right 2 days from now when I forgot I updated 😛

[24-Sep-18 08:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dev branch?

[24-Sep-18 08:26 PM] SHossain#0007
all branches has update now

[24-Sep-18 08:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
anyone calculated how much it costs using nicehash to mine as of now? per pirate ?

[24-Sep-18 08:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
too much :trollface:

[24-Sep-18 08:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, I expect that, but any calculated number in either BTC or KMD ?

[24-Sep-18 08:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_spent $30k on miners and got off cheaper than renting from nh_

[24-Sep-18 08:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh it's that expensive with nicehash? 😮

[24-Sep-18 08:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you bought miners ?

[24-Sep-18 08:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or renting miners or something ?

[24-Sep-18 08:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ya, I bought a few batches of minis

[24-Sep-18 08:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

mine are stuck with nz customs 😄

[24-Sep-18 08:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I had 9 that were "unaccounted for" but "definitely not lost" for 4 days, if that makes you feel any better @grewalsatinder
