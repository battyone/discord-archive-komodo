[09-Oct-18 02:49 PM] That_Guy8#4893
Would anyone have some info on pool setup, specifically the pirate.json in pool_configs. Curious about the “address” zAddress” and “tAddress” fields. If all are needed / used due this being zAddress only.

[09-Oct-18 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@That_Guy8 what pool fork are you using?

[09-Oct-18 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
znomp? knomp? something else?

[09-Oct-18 02:52 PM] That_Guy8#4893
knomp

[09-Oct-18 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from webworker01?

[09-Oct-18 02:52 PM] That_Guy8#4893
correct

[09-Oct-18 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ok, are you solo mining?

[09-Oct-18 02:53 PM] That_Guy8#4893
got the conf files ready but wondering if i populate the "address" and tAddress" specifically

[09-Oct-18 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, you  need a t addy as the pool's addy

[09-Oct-18 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and you also need a z to shield to

[09-Oct-18 02:53 PM] That_Guy8#4893
ahh so they dont only use the zAddress

[09-Oct-18 02:54 PM] That_Guy8#4893
thought since miner miner with the zaddr might not be used

[09-Oct-18 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all transactions are z, but the coinbase for the block is to a t addy

[09-Oct-18 02:54 PM] That_Guy8#4893

[09-Oct-18 07:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe when my keys get here I should just wait a couple more days and script buy from onboarding instead of mining :trollface:

[09-Oct-18 07:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Zach `means that someone has sent a transaction to the network mempool that does not meet the requirements for inclusion in a block.`

[09-Oct-18 07:06 PM] Resistor#1215
how do you sell and buy pirate coins?

[09-Oct-18 07:06 PM] Resistor#1215
what is the onboarding thing?

[09-Oct-18 07:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for now, person to person buy/sell in #otc-project 
onboarding is small amounts at a discount rate to ensure that newcommers can get "some"

{Reactions}
🍆 trollface 

[09-Oct-18 07:08 PM] Zach#9973
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  so me seeing that error doesnt mean it is an error on my end even though I am trying to send ARRR currently?

[09-Oct-18 07:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
onboarding allows folks to get enough to "practice" without great expense

[09-Oct-18 07:09 PM] c2k#4915
what is the onboarding rate for pirate virgins? 😱

[09-Oct-18 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Zach yes, most likely coincidence

[09-Oct-18 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if it's your error, the tx will fail completely

[09-Oct-18 07:10 PM] Zach#9973
OK good to know, this transaction is taking longer than usual so I checked the debug log and saw that

[09-Oct-18 07:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Do a ``komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_getoperationstatus '["opid-here"]'`` and it will tell you if it's executing, failed, or success

[09-Oct-18 07:14 PM] Zach#9973
I assume its still executing because my CPU is almost pegged haha but I will check

[09-Oct-18 07:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Well we had a close comp for the voting.   
@wookie okie went the extra mile and recruited new people into crypto and pirate while trying to get his logo some votes.  
The P with the eyepatch had too many iterations or it would have swept first place I think, so @Ignacio Figueroa (FIG) , @Llama and @Hermes let's collaborate next time 😃  @Hoffenbrau came out of nowhere with a last minute submission to place.   
Here are the tallied results.

[09-Oct-18 07:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
After removing the votes Wookie had with no z addresses or other issues, he ended up with 11 votes too.   A shocking three way tie.   
So @wookie , @Ignacio Figueroa (FIG) , @Hermes  - DM me your Zaddresses!   @Llama and I just squared up.  I sent @Hoffenbrau a message since he has yet to frequent the discord.   He will though soon.

[09-Oct-18 07:19 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We will use the Sabre and Eyepatch logos to represent the coin until we get an entire design deck completed for the project.   
We really appreciate all the hard work everyone put in and we don't want you to spend all your booty in one place....  Unless that place is Tortuga... then feel free to make it rain.

Good ones

[09-Oct-18 07:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The designer is taking all the logo creations and using the ideas to help with the final layouts.   He will have some mockups in a week or two.

[09-Oct-18 07:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So in essence, all these have helped to shape the future feel of pirate so again, thank you all.

[09-Oct-18 07:23 PM] Flexatron#8809
Personally have an odd feeling by the colour of the saber one but really like the others

Hi everybody, I just downloaded the Agama wallet, but Pirate coin is not listed?

[09-Oct-18 07:36 PM] OliverDay#5571
Can someone please point me to a link where I can download the correct Agama wallet?

Thanks very much, I appreciate it.

[09-Oct-18 07:45 PM] OliverDay#5571
I installed V3.13c from the Verus website

[09-Oct-18 07:45 PM] SHossain#0007
You can't run PIRATE using VerusCoin verison of Agama wallet

[09-Oct-18 07:47 PM] OliverDay#5571
Yeah I saw that.

[09-Oct-18 07:47 PM] OliverDay#5571
Thanks

[09-Oct-18 07:47 PM] OliverDay#5571
I mine Verus too, so was actually hoping for an Agama wallet that has both.

[09-Oct-18 07:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can mine both at the same time if you use both clis, but not with 1 wallet atm

[09-Oct-18 07:49 PM] OliverDay#5571
Yeah i need 1 wallet...

[09-Oct-18 07:49 PM] SHossain#0007
There were some PIRATE specific changes in Komodo source. Miketout needs to merge them to his repo and compile the daemon and build the next version of Agama using latest Agama source as it has specific changes for PIRTAE. doable, but can take long time.

[09-Oct-18 07:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
convenience aside, why do you "need" 1 wallet?

[09-Oct-18 07:51 PM] OliverDay#5571
I just downloaded v2.42c - I can’t see the Pirate Coin listed in the list of coins inside the wallet?

[09-Oct-18 07:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
did you click activate?

[09-Oct-18 07:51 PM] mato121#5963
Pirate head is really nice looking logo :d

[09-Oct-18 07:51 PM] SHossain#0007
don't use shortcut, use Activate coin button

[09-Oct-18 07:52 PM] OliverDay#5571
You first need to select the coin, then “Activate”?

[09-Oct-18 07:53 PM] SHossain#0007
no, click Activate Coin then selection coin
