How is pirates related to komodo?

[22-Nov-18 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Hi folks, In case anyone is interested, I am not giving up on my crex24 deposit. https://imgur.com/a/fBIxfK3

I will keep asking them nicely while I am travelling, reserve the more serious steps for once I get back to Europe...

thte amount should not matter

[22-Nov-18 06:28 PM] jorian#4555
no, true, but when you're making such a fuss it will be a lot i guess

sorry if it appears that I am, it is not for getting sympathy or anything...

[22-Nov-18 06:29 PM] jorian#4555
heh, no need to say sorry, i was just curious 😄

[22-Nov-18 06:29 PM] jansako#3330
I am keeping it alive because of the way they approach the issue

[22-Nov-18 06:30 PM] jansako#3330
sort of like... we did not tell others on 'social media' that you can deposit, so you should have ignored the deposit address displayed on your account...

@jansako send a diplomatic tweet on twitter.   Or maybe @Crex24 can help out here.   
If they have the wallet created...I assume they have a way to salvage it unless they didn’t get that far in development.

[22-Nov-18 06:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
DM me for how much you sent. 
@HellBlazeSRB let us know what happens.

[22-Nov-18 06:41 PM] jansako#3330
Would be colossally st***** to create wallets, post them and not have the private keys.... it was 20k... I do not use twitter, or telegram... thanks though!

[22-Nov-18 06:44 PM] HellBlazeSRB#6211
@FishyGuts sure... i do propose that DC turns off both D and W until its 100% solid... i did a W because it was seemingly allowed after I bought a big bag and then maybe 3 mins later they killed it... now tx says aborted but coins are neither on there nor in my wallet... good thing i am in for a long but would definitely want to salvage that 50k

withdrew small amount of ARRR (not 10's of K) from DP -> safely arrived in wallet within seconds

`Don't forget to do it daily

Yeah, be a damn shame if some random shitcoin got a spot on an exchange that doesn't exist yet 🙄

[22-Nov-18 10:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
if it will exist, well that's 1 more exchange where ARRR is present... if not, we only spent a few clicks 😉

[22-Nov-18 10:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
(if they can implement ARRR that is... after the crex experience)

[22-Nov-18 10:12 PM] dustblaze#1349
Being that txbit is backed by Solaris, a privacy centric coin that implemented zerocoin protocol a year ago, I think pirate would go hand in hand on the exchange

[22-Nov-18 10:15 PM] mrlynch#5735
i won't hold my breath until i see it listed. z tx is no easy thing especially for exchanges
