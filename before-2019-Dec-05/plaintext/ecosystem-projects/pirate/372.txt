[dscrd-prt] <Zanzarismo> Weekly Pirate chat starts in 15min!

[17-Oct-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Domoo> I just discover "Arrow chain" on one pirate page (the one for pirate freelances) 

I was wondering to ask you since their pirate grade was at 9.4/10 , how pirate is better than Arrow , or if they are very similar as it seems to be according to their description ?

[17-Oct-19 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <actionslacks> Pirate is not susceptible to 51% attacks thanks to dpow

[17-Oct-19 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <actionslacks> Largest anonymity set in crypto. Arrow pretty much copied arrr. Pirate was the first z-transaction only chain

[17-Oct-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Domoo> Yes true 51%

[17-Oct-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Domoo> Oh alright they copied pirate

[17-Oct-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Domoo> Thats good to know

[17-Oct-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Domoo> Do you think they can become more important than pirate ? If for example they have a lower total supply they may be less impacted by our miners dumper process I dont know

[17-Oct-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <actionslacks> I see that Arrow arrow has a nice parallax bootstrap website, but really the only thing that matters in crypto is hash rate and the dev team. I think Pirate has an advantage in that regard. That being said, we are all in this game together and the more privacy focused projects the better.

[17-Oct-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Domoo> Yeah

[17-Oct-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Domoo> Alright I dont really know tbh what is an parallax bootstrap website, but would it make sens for pirate to have one ?

[17-Oct-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <actionslacks> Bootstrap sells website templates, parallax is a website effect. While gimmicks can sell coins, this project is more focused on real usage than gimmicks.

[17-Oct-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <actionslacks> But really it comes down to devs. Zcash updates their protocol at a rapid pace. If the team behind a zcash fork is not robust, they get left in the dust :trollface:

[17-Oct-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Domoo> Oh alright ok thanks for this

[17-Oct-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <actionslacks> Of course, if you're new to crypto, you've found a good place to learn. welcome

[dscrd-prt] <Keppie> 7/10 : The project shows signs of strength and promise in various aspects of its community; development; metrics; and/or pricing; but there are key weaknesses in one or more of these areas that need to be mitigated. Low risk of abandonment. Some degree of liquidity available.

[17-Oct-19 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> did they add that info page all on their own?

[17-Oct-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> ah nvm, saw their tweet now

[17-Oct-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LoPhatMelk> ```More impressive is the genuine and
palpable excitement the community has for PirateChain; if I‚Äôm honest, this community (at
least within Discord) seems to be one of the most engaged I have come across. This is critical
in the longevity of a project. ``` From the binance report. ‚ù§

[17-Oct-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> we ARRR pirates, and we drink rum :rum:

[17-Oct-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LoPhatMelk> TLDR on the report, Pirate is awesome and doing great things, needs more volume, community is awesome but needs to stop the internal bickering, website info is good but needs updated, price needs to break the 530 sat resistance and people will start buying in.

[17-Oct-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> there is no internal bickering, only slight disagreements in the past that have been resolved since, website is currently being reviewed and rebuilt to deliver useful information in a more user-friendly manner
can't do anything in regards to the price though, however adoption might contribute.
i urge all pirate community users (and more) to engage in e-commerce - buy and sell products and services with arrr
there is a new community effort underway to work and hire and pay/get payed in ARRR -> http://piratepay.us/ however i believe it is still under construction so new freelancer on-boarding should speed up testing process

[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> Nik mentioned that once liquidity improves he will revisit the rating

[17-Oct-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> however, (reported) liquidity won't be that bad once altsbit is listed on CMC - ends to which i'm doing my best to assist them with

[17-Oct-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kaks> regarding for the price will break soon
Show them your talent to get some Pirate :scallywag:

[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> 1984 coming to a country near you

[17-Oct-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> i hope big companies see the threat in this (if they hadn't noticed the trend in the past decade) and relocate their businesses elsewhere

[17-Oct-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> ```The Chinese government understands that foreign companies and individuals will be reluctant to simply turn over their information to the Chinese government when asked. For that reason, the Chinese Cybersecurity Bureau does not plan to politely make a formal request for the information. The fundamental premise of the new cybersecurity systems is that the government will use its control of communications to simply take the information without discussing the matter with the user. All data will be open to the Chinese government.```

<https://web.archive.org/web/20190214130454/https://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/2000s/ADA435563.pdf>

[17-Oct-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> china looks so scary with all their surveillance, social rating and crap like that

[17-Oct-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> imagine how it will be there in 5-10 years ... scary

[17-Oct-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> i just hope no western country (or at least a somewhat free country) emulates the full extent of their surveillance

[17-Oct-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> imo the social credit system is even more frightening, especially if they start incorporating all their surveillance data into

[17-Oct-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> as for the social rating system it's nothing more than orwell's though police - put the average person's well being in danger and most will simply comply with whatever you ask them to do

[17-Oct-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> "hello sir, you have criticized the state in your family chat group, we cannot grant you a credit"

[17-Oct-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> jaywalk in a big chinese city and the fine is taken from your bank account in a few minutes

[17-Oct-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> it still baffles me how a population of 1+ billion can be subdued in a relatively short timespan (this all started what, 3-4 decades ago and only being ramped up in the last decade)

[17-Oct-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> the dangers of technology

[17-Oct-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kaks> Just the beginning

[17-Oct-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> the dangers of technology will begin when general ai will dictate what it does with humans. until then it's still the dangers of corrupt people imho

[17-Oct-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kaks> imo there wont be any privacy in couple of years

[17-Oct-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> I have read a few articles some time ago about how the chinese party cannot properly handle/manage/control the whole country simply because of its vast size and huge population and that instead there are also many almost purely locally working authorities without much cross communication and work... but technology actually will make it possible to control all the people centrally - if used maliciously

[17-Oct-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> `if used maliciously` that is their intent and they don't hide it. of course, malicious in this context means voiding people of their personal lives, identity, personality, etc

[17-Oct-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> yep

[17-Oct-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> they're merely workers in a big factory

[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> üôÇ

[17-Oct-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> so, what can one do about that?

[17-Oct-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> give powers to the people

[17-Oct-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> but how?

[17-Oct-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> (like we try to do)

[17-Oct-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> private money/crypto, private communication medium

[17-Oct-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> most people don't want to accept said power, personal responsibility

[17-Oct-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> but ofc it's not easy if the officials ban and punish that

[17-Oct-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> because then you have to think long and hard about your family's and your well being

[17-Oct-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> even in the west, we see how the legislation landscape changes.. what is "ok to protect your private life" today might become illegal tomorrow. are you willing to risk becoming an outlaw? and are you willing to fight as an outlaw?

[17-Oct-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> in the end enough citizen will have to rebel .. but the longer they wait the stronger the government will be and the easier it will be to silence them

[17-Oct-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> i'm unsure of that, humans are being slowly reprogrammed

[17-Oct-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> "are you willing to risk becoming an outlaw? and are you willing to fight as an outlaw?"
exactly, most people won't risk that

[17-Oct-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> biologically, a human being is a social creature and the social system is confined within communities of size no bigger than 150 - apparently that's the maximum of meaningful relationships a human being can keep
with the social media revolution humans are being "encouraged" to have more and more relationships regardless of their quality

[17-Oct-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> it's the numbers that matter in the new social system. the more people like you, the better it is therefore propagating an idea becomes easier once humans accept it because it increases their chances of being liked.

[17-Oct-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> critical thinking and care for the immediate social community (family, neighborhood, village, etc) are detrimental in the new social system

[17-Oct-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> just observe the twitter lynch mobs and you will understand what is, in reality, scary.. technology is just a tool

[17-Oct-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> in conclusion, most will not risk becoming an outlaw not because of the lawlessness factor, but simply because it won't be fashionable

[17-Oct-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> not sure about your last statement

[17-Oct-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> I would argue more people care about not breaking laws to not face punishments, than it not being fashionable

[17-Oct-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> Even now that privacy is a legal option, people completely neglect its importance. I guess when things get tough it will be even worse.

[17-Oct-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> Privacy is also very time consuming for the average person.

[17-Oct-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> Luckily, in most of the western world average persons don't (yet) need privacy that much

[17-Oct-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> As long as you don't do anything extreme your (private) communication usually have no impact on your life (yet)

[17-Oct-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> But I still strongly support privacy, for the sole reason that people can opt in IF they choose so (and that should be and stay their right)

[17-Oct-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> Everyone needs privacy no matter where they live.

[17-Oct-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> Not only because they have secrets to hide. But mostly because their information is used maliciously

[17-Oct-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> `I would argue more people care about not breaking laws to not face punishments, than it not being fashionable` after snowden 2013 revelations, cambridge analytica and others (these 2 were heavily publicized) one would argue that most people would take measures, but it didn't really happen not because it was illegal, but because it wasn't fashionable. most adopted the "if i have nothing to hide why should i care?" stance

[17-Oct-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> i wonder how the landscape would have been if you had celebrities promoting use of vpn, tor, xmr and other privacy enhancing technologies non-stop

[17-Oct-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> On the other hand average people have associated privacy and cryptography with terrorism and illegal activities. Most times when I talk to people about crypto and Private messaging they immediately mention that they are used by terrorist organisations.

[17-Oct-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> Maybe if some credible celebrity mentioned that they are using them, folks would change the way they see all this.

[17-Oct-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> so we need a celebrity to do a short video on the importance of privacy?

[17-Oct-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @Draeth ?

[17-Oct-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> Someone of Royal descent would be nice

[17-Oct-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> Guess it would be important that it at least seems like that celeb means it serious, and not just like a paid ad

[17-Oct-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ocash> Ideally someone who already has a lot of money and can do it for free

[17-Oct-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> mcaffee :trollface:

[17-Oct-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
