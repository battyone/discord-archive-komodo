Currently more miners then buyers, price must decline

[14-Oct-18 10:31 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
People have limited supply so current people can buy infinitely from you... new people are "needed" for that

[14-Oct-18 10:31 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
can't sell to same people over and over again - isnt obvious?

[14-Oct-18 10:32 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and it's even worse - after some time = Tx some buyers (not miners) will also dump even taking loss, this will kill price even more

CEX for Arrr (liquidity allowed easy) and strong shilling team (marketing attraction and education) in every private coin btc talk thread +twitter + reddit can sustain the price or even growth. 100 NEw users weekly could do the job ?

[14-Oct-18 10:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 imo, the key that people seem to be overlooking is that until we bring in those outside people (which miners will not come to OTC without larger incentive than just a fractionally higher profitability to compensated for manual involvement) we need to set a base value (equation if you will) for what we feel what we are doing is going to be worth.
If we say it's of low value, then why should outside investors be interested?
Conversely, if we over-value and "present to the world", then newcomers are going to be put off by that as well.

[14-Oct-18 10:39 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
It could work if you are monopolist - you can set basica value. But what is other will suddenly need money? Obvious - sudden dump. BEcause you never know what happens. And when it goes t oscale (many miners) you can count on it - even if you agree with everyone - soime people will break because reason - chaotic nature of universe 😃

[14-Oct-18 10:40 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
So it's not pratical think to do, but you can try  and see and get frustrated until you see it's obvious

Superstron marketing is needed even if you have outstanding product. Unfortunately human brains work that way

[14-Oct-18 10:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, a dump could/would/should lower price, but that's not where we're at now.
At the right pricepoint, you can dump 1M, right this second, and it have 0 effect on price

[14-Oct-18 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
each coin is basically the mining cost at the time encapsulated. over time based on demand, the price for past coins will change, regardless of its cost at the time. all we would really know is that at any given moment in time, each coin is worth the mining cost as that is what the miners are buying them for

[14-Oct-18 10:42 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Im talking about scale and "statistics". You cannot control that much.

[14-Oct-18 10:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
True, @jl777c, but imo we've reached a point were only 2 of us even know what that cost is 😕

[14-Oct-18 10:43 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and demand must be sustained... imagine you set price 1 KMD = 1 ARR and other miners agree and keep the agreement, but same time everyon in here already spent all KMD to get Arr and no new people incoming. Result? Price is virtually high, but nobody trading.

[14-Oct-18 10:44 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
And it will be followe by collapse.

[14-Oct-18 10:44 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
CG the cost does differ depending on your setup/how much you're willing to pay for NH

[14-Oct-18 10:44 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Soon we shall see that in global finance.

[14-Oct-18 10:44 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I think it goes back to what JL was saying before. A stable mining presence is needed for a stable price. The influx of NH miners on a coin doesn't provide longevity.

[14-Oct-18 10:44 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Because NH miners need to sell in order to mine

[14-Oct-18 10:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@NutellaLicka I'm aware, that's why I say most don't know the "average" cost

PIRATE has been consistently more hashrate than ZCL. factoring in the different coins per block, it gives an approx  value of 15 cents or so, and that correlates with many of the trades. back when hashrate was almost double, then the price was almost double

[14-Oct-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as marketcap goes a few million marketcap now and 15 million at halving, gets it the same marketcap as ZCL

[14-Oct-18 10:45 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
you are right as long as demands for Arrr and ZCL are comparable as well

[14-Oct-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
if you think that is an unreasonably high comparison, sell all day long at 0.15

[14-Oct-18 10:45 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
prices determined by both = demand and production , equally important

[14-Oct-18 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
with marketing it wont be so hard to have more ARRR demand than ZCL, as ZCL appears to be pretty weak

[14-Oct-18 10:46 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
agree? anyone ? 😃

[14-Oct-18 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810

we have a many month mining period at 256 block reward. if anything this is the time the price is the most suppressed

[14-Oct-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
and we havent really deployed much actual marketing yet

[14-Oct-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
still the hashrate is already what it is

[14-Oct-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing keeps going up in a straight line without corrections along the way

[14-Oct-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
that is the nature of nature

[14-Oct-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so month to month, it is clear that this month PIRATE has made a lot of progress compared to its first month

[14-Oct-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
for the next month to be better than this month, that is what needs to happen

[14-Oct-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
and as long as most months we have either more hashrate, or higher price, or more users, or some combination, that is progress

estimation: to sustain price we should double that in 1 month ?

[14-Oct-18 10:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if anything this is the time the price is the most suppressed` Well, that was kinda my point and the ZEC comparison was along the lines of what I was looking for.
Does the community, as a whole, think that 15-20 cents is unreasonable to a 10-12 cent cost?

[14-Oct-18 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
I am very happy for the low premium over mining cost 😃

ultimately it is clearly worth more than a $15 mil marketcap coin considering how it is better tech than XMR and we expect some pretty good marketing

[14-Oct-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
but we do need to be onboarding dozens of new pirates per day

[14-Oct-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810

[14-Oct-18 10:52 AM] Flexatron#8809
Ironic

[14-Oct-18 10:53 AM] Oszy#5734
buying bigger amounts for 2-3 cents more is reasonable because if you were to mine that yourself quick you'd have to pop a lot of MSols which would increase the "cost" of the mining as diff rockets. better just buy for a bit more in my opinion

[14-Oct-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
onboarding should be a good price to make the onboarding experience a happy one

[14-Oct-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
and as we all have seen when the influx of new pirates dwindles, so does the hashrate and price

[14-Oct-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
there shouldnt be any more complaints about how the onboarding is killing the market price

`Onboarding just went to 0.13`
That was to be my next question, how do we keep onboarding of any value when people keep undercutting it so they can make $2?

[14-Oct-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
$2 is $2 more than $0 , so I guess some people will do it

[14-Oct-18 10:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
true enough

[14-Oct-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
we just need to count on the hassle factor to prevent the majority from doing this

[14-Oct-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
we are in the initial distribution period

[14-Oct-18 10:55 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
not an issue at all, just good to reflect current prices to miners using calculator will not be disapointed

[14-Oct-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
planting as many seeds as possible

[14-Oct-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, we make the mining calculator use the 0.1 price as a basis regardless of market as they can always sell at that price

[14-Oct-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
so miners wont be disappointed

[14-Oct-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810

each new pirate increases the market potential

[14-Oct-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
the larger the pirate army, the higher the eventual marketcap

[14-Oct-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I think XMR is the more valid comparable than ZEC

[14-Oct-18 10:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`onboarders save a few bucks`
In theory, yes; in practice, CHMEX would have a full-time job keeping up with the panic sales of late

[14-Oct-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
we have to assume that the average sales will be more than mining cost + 10%

[14-Oct-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
though to make that $2, maybe a 9% margin is worth it 😃

[14-Oct-18 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess what a lot of the "flippers" (not sure that is the right term) dont realize is that as unlimited as the PIRATE supply feels like now, it will get halved and then the $2 profit is $1, and halved again. If you really, really need the $2, then it seems it is reasonable to do

[14-Oct-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
the really low cost early PIRATE all seems to have been traded, several times over, so we now have the PIRATE in hands of long term hodlers or close to 10 cents cost basis.

[14-Oct-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
As long as we can keep onboarding new pirates, all will work out fine

[14-Oct-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810

[14-Oct-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
so our feeling that PIRATE is special, is not misguided. there is numerical proof of this

[14-Oct-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
something like 3x from komodoplatform.com, but not sure if I understood the stats correctly

[14-Oct-18 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
all the remaining tech items for PIRATE is pretty well known and making progress, so we should have the complete package (minus mobile) soon enough. In the meantime if the hashrate drops a lot, that would just mean I can buy more at even lower costs

[14-Oct-18 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, pirate.black sent a lot of traffic to agama download page.

[14-Oct-18 11:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` In the meantime if the hashrate drops a lot, that would just mean I can buy more at even lower costs`
Well, that's kinda what I'm looking for from the OP, but isn't pegging price solely to hash just as bad of an idea as any? If I, personally, opted to double the hashrate for a week, does that mean the price should be 0.3 over the current 0.15?

[14-Oct-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it does mean it would cost that much and disincentivize selling for lower
