We atleast need an exchange for price discovery and an app for usage

[12-Sep-18 11:38 AM] ollsanek#8340
as always needed: 5-8 pools, gui wallet,  at least  1  exchange.

I agree, an exchange and a good application is what we should focus on now, very ironic how the tech is super positive at the moment, but the bear market is kicking everyone in the nuts psychologically

Hi, i'd like to mine pirate. I'm quite new to mining. Been mining komodo on miningspeed pool but they recently shut doors on me.. Didn't investigate why. Anyways, would love to mine pirate for the time being. I do not have lots of hash, only one GPU in my desktop computer. So, a few info on where to mine pirate and a link to setup script guide would be much appreciated. Thanks

[12-Sep-18 12:57 PM] P3L3#1096

It would be easy to support PIRATE in Hush-NG, or create a PIRATE-branded version of Hush-NG, so PIRATE has it's own dedicated full node GUI wallet

I have an account in bitcointalk, the problem is that I can not access by a forum error and administrators do not answer the help requests. I can use another account but do not have enough messages to send the mail. I have been following this project since nxt, I have an account in nxtforum since 2014 with this same name. But if it's your decision, I understand it.

[12-Sep-18 11:19 PM] Flexatron#8809
What can we do as a community to stimulate the development of a pirate version of hushng?

[12-Sep-18 11:19 PM] Flexatron#8809
Im not a developer, but I can donate funds

[13-Sep-18 09:09 AM] Don King#8901
We probably need some input from dukeleto on what needs doing for PIRATE integration with hushng , most devs in komodo ecosystem have pretty full agendas now and are very busy already, so probably a medium term goal, unless another new dev wants to help out and make a name for themselves. I'm not a dev either, but can help with other areas

[13-Sep-18 01:10 PM] wookie#7663
I went to the HUSH webpage and read about Hushng. Can someone help me understand why private messaging is important? I understand some people want to talk without being recorded or organizations don't want their business plans leaked, but is there a significant demand? I'm honestly am just curious and want to learn about the field. I have seen several other tokens implement different variations of this but I never understood it. thank you.

[13-Sep-18 01:55 PM] wookie#7663
ok thanks. Is there a significant demand for this kind of service? From a business standpoint? I'm not in the crypto/tech field, just wondering.

[13-Sep-18 02:14 PM] wookie#7663
oh, good to know and learn. Thank you, @Deleted User , I appreciate you taking the time to respond.

@wookie in the whitepaper I describe various use-cases where somebody would want this stuff, such as human-rights activists or whistleblowers: https://github.com/leto/hushlist/blob/master/whitepaper/protocol.pdf

Hushlist is compatible with any ZEC fork, which means KMD and every KMD asset chain like PIRATE

[13-Sep-18 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
the most basic form is just using the Zcash protocol memo field, then there are more advanced uses that use "viewing keys" and some features that only some ZEC forks might have/etc. But at it's core, every KMD AC can use Hushlist

[13-Sep-18 03:13 PM] wookie#7663
@dukeleto Thank you! Good examples of use cases at the end! Also good that's it's interoperable on any ZEC forks!

[13-Sep-18 03:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
I thought Zcash Sapling would be ready by now, and kind of went into a holding pattern, because Zcash was changing so many things

[13-Sep-18 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
but now I see many coins will never upgrade to Sapling, which *might* be ready in a few months from now, and others will take a long time, because it's not easy. So supporting "old skool" Zcash viewing keys, as the system uses now, will be around for a while

[13-Sep-18 03:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
the word on the street is, new Sapling shielded transactions are in the ~5 second range, instead of ~45 seconds, which is huge. But Zcash still does not persist their new Sapling private keys to disk (with less than 6 weeks to their block activitation), so yeah. üçø

[13-Sep-18 03:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is 5 seconds versus 45 seconds *per JoinSplit*

[13-Sep-18 03:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can currently send to up to 54 people in a z_sendmany, which means roughly 45 minutes to embed a 27KB file into a transaction

[13-Sep-18 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
fine for some use cases, like if you want to prove something after the fact, but store it encrypted for a while in a blockchain. But any type of chat or real-time use case is out the window

[13-Sep-18 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
so Sapling support, if it ever gets delivered, makes everything a lot more usable for normal folks

[13-Sep-18 03:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
and also opens up mobile usage, right now a few shielded transactions would kill your battery

[13-Sep-18 03:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
Here is a quick thing for something to try, read this commit and make equivalent changes for PIRATE, on a `pirate` branch: https://github.com/MyHush/hush-ng/commit/cabd6a30ab29d8050c0f5c51081108af87fce739

that will let you see how Hush-NG works with PIRATE, and it will let you read and send encrypted memos

[13-Sep-18 03:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you try to use a taddr with PIRATE, some RPC error will pop up to tell you that is not allowed on PIRATE. Hush-NG has very good error-handling and gives you nice notifications with details

[13-Sep-18 03:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
even better would be a drop-down that let's you choose which coin to connect to. If PIRATE wants a PIRATE-centric wallet, then most of the work is making binaries for people, because most people don't want to git clone from github

[13-Sep-18 04:06 PM] Flexatron#8809
Makes sense

More single miners aside from the pool

@Flexatron can you show me where to go to see that?

[14-Sep-18 02:34 PM] metaphilibert#0926
If you compare the global hashrate with the pool hashrate, you have an idea of hashrate outside of the pool

[14-Sep-18 02:34 PM] wookie#7663
I see. @metaphilibert thanks!

someone by the username "TakeItEasy" over on bitcointalk followed the instructions and got 0 balance in their PIRATE wallet. Can someone help?

I just followed the instructions and started the PIRATE wallet. It said that the wallet is already running. How do I stop the wallet so it's not always sync'ing in the background? I assume closing the terminal window does not stop the wallet.

[14-Sep-18 10:22 PM] Alright#0419
Also, that number is just an estimate

[14-Sep-18 10:23 PM] Alright#0419
it will only ever be close to the real number when blocks are consistently 1 minute apart

[14-Sep-18 10:23 PM] Alright#0419
which they are not atm

Net hash is a representation of difficulty

[14-Sep-18 11:13 PM] abcd#1803
If we get really lucky and find 10 blocks back to back, diff will rise and in turn nethash will appear higher than it is

[14-Sep-18 11:14 PM] abcd#1803
Same goes for if you are unlucky, nethash can sometimes be lower than actual hashrate.

[14-Sep-18 11:16 PM] Alright#0419
basically, if blocks are coming in in <1 minute intervals, that number is lower than actual network hash rate. If blocks are coming in >1 minute intervals, that number is higher than actual network hash rate

[14-Sep-18 11:17 PM] Alright#0419
the estimate is based on block times and difficulty

[16-Sep-18 09:41 PM] wookie#7663
I created a tricorn style Pirate Hat, with a Komodo logo. Under the hat is a bandana and eye patch, all being nods to the PIRATE name. There are 2 versions, one with and one without a face to emphasize on anonymity and privacy. The logo pack comes with KMD colors or a grayscale. It also includes options with a shadow tone.

binding transparent bitcoin script to z-outputs...

[19-Sep-18 02:20 AM] BigCat45#4982
So the bottom line is (in my opinion), there is a very high probability PIRATE is nothing more then a fancy token created somewhere in 2018 to see how these specific parameters would work, but since it required too much (unnecessary) work, we can congratulate pirate-whales with fancy badges. I liked the idea actually. Might get one of those once mm9 is commenced...
