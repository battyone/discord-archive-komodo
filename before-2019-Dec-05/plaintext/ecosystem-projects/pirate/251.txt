[01-Nov-18 02:52 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
my experience with withdraws on dp is that they are processed evry 10-15

[01-Nov-18 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
you followed all the steps for withdraw?

[01-Nov-18 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i think there is some code via email that needs to be added

[01-Nov-18 02:52 PM] Bakes#0367
they are working with me now

[01-Nov-18 02:53 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622

[01-Nov-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Digiprice > binance ? :trollface:

[01-Nov-18 02:55 PM] Bakes#0367

[01-Nov-18 02:55 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Withdrawam process seems screwed

[01-Nov-18 02:56 PM] Flexatron#8809
i can imagine with 20 trades per day total :trollface:

[01-Nov-18 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if it was a busy as binance its service would be terrible... digi price service is great ... when i signed up I had the wrong email address and suppprot answered me for that in liek 15 mins! üòÆ

[01-Nov-18 02:56 PM] Flexatron#8809

[01-Nov-18 02:56 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
there is no info on the page afrter withdrwawal request -> I need to figure out myself to check emai lmaybe -> got email with code but no idea where to put that code into

[01-Nov-18 02:56 PM] Bakes#0367
the volume difference is a clearly obvious in the difference in response rate

[01-Nov-18 02:56 PM] Bakes#0367
just sayin it's nice

[01-Nov-18 02:57 PM] Flexatron#8809
yea it reloads and then adds a verification code form

[01-Nov-18 02:57 PM] Flexatron#8809
kind off weird

[01-Nov-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well... maybe after adding Pirate they will get some more volume ?

[01-Nov-18 02:57 PM] Flexatron#8809
yea that's why I bought some shitcoin DP

[01-Nov-18 02:57 PM] Bakes#0367
that's what I'm thinking

[01-Nov-18 02:57 PM] Flexatron#8809
and a shit masternode

[01-Nov-18 02:57 PM] Flexatron#8809
lmao

[01-Nov-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
first exchange with Z -tx deposit and withdraw is pretty huge tbh

[01-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Flexatron#8809
if only you could pay fees in DP

[01-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Bakes#0367
no successful deposits so far in my experience

[01-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Flexatron#8809
then DP would have a usecase as well

[01-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Bakes#0367
DP does have a usecase

[01-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Flexatron#8809
withdraw still not initiated

[01-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Bakes#0367
google "DP" with no content filter

[01-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Flexatron#8809
lol

[01-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Bakes#0367

[01-Nov-18 02:59 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[01-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Bakes#0367
thought so

[01-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Flexatron#8809
yea it has exactly ""2" usecases

[01-Nov-18 02:59 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
there is also a flwa with noreply email - there are buttons with "I confirm" which actually send email to noreply

{Reactions}
trollface abusedsmily 

[01-Nov-18 02:59 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
+ no form to actually use the code they send

[01-Nov-18 02:59 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
and confirm withdrawal

[01-Nov-18 03:00 PM] Bakes#0367
meh going to bed, hopefully magically solved in the morning

[01-Nov-18 03:01 PM] Flexatron#8809
still no withdraw

[01-Nov-18 03:02 PM] Flexatron#8809
will keep checking later

[01-Nov-18 03:04 PM] Flexatron#8809
almost 20 mins since withdraw (5 ARRR)

[01-Nov-18 03:20 PM] Oszy#5734
when you withdraw you can enter the e-mail code where you put the amount in. a new box will appear under the amount.

[01-Nov-18 03:21 PM] Oszy#5734
if you set up 2fa you can turn off the email thing

[01-Nov-18 03:22 PM] Flexatron#8809
No withdrawss

[01-Nov-18 03:23 PM] zatJUM#9924
trade / deposits and withdraws are suspended

[01-Nov-18 03:23 PM] Flexatron#8809
1h cycle?

[01-Nov-18 03:23 PM] Flexatron#8809
Okay

[01-Nov-18 03:23 PM] Flexatron#8809
I see

[01-Nov-18 03:25 PM] Flexatron#8809
Testing is proving to be important again

[01-Nov-18 03:25 PM] Oszy#5734
To everyone who deposited and it's not been completed yet, I talked to Steve @ DigiPri he said:
`We are currently in a testing phase, your current deposits will be ok. There is nothing to worry about.`

[01-Nov-18 03:26 PM] Oszy#5734
Actually my deposit went to completed after 24 hours, after the 20 confirmations. Took long enough but got it now.

[01-Nov-18 03:41 PM] Tihocan#1946
Where can I buy ARRR?

[01-Nov-18 03:42 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
DP got in touch with me and my deposit has appeared now. they have tunred off deposits and withdraws atm

[01-Nov-18 03:42 PM] jansako#3330
My deposit showed up too eventually. I sneaked one in during the previous testing window.

[01-Nov-18 03:43 PM] jansako#3330

[01-Nov-18 03:43 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
