[19-Oct-18 07:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@TrueCryptoMiner How is it "weird" that a new coin that has features that no one has implemented in any exchange yet, isn't on any exchange?

[19-Oct-18 07:17 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
next step is for me to understand the sell/trading

[19-Oct-18 07:18 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
im just new

[19-Oct-18 07:18 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
ive only minded coins that are on exchanges

[19-Oct-18 07:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so is PIRATE 😉

[19-Oct-18 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810

Are you running an overclock on ur z9's ?

[19-Oct-18 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
I have an open ended buy offer for 100K ARRR at a time at 0.1 KMD

[19-Oct-18 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
based on the hashrate the otc price seems to change a lot

[19-Oct-18 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
but at least my WTB is there

[19-Oct-18 07:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
this past week, hash hasn't had much impact on pricing

[19-Oct-18 07:21 PM] Algorismus#9195
Hello pirate miners!
i downloaded the agma wallet about 7 hours ago and it's still syncing how long did it take you to download the entire blockchain??

[19-Oct-18 07:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Algorismus are you sure you activated PIRATE and not KMD?

[19-Oct-18 07:21 PM] Algorismus#9195
yes i am

[19-Oct-18 07:22 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
i am overclocking z9 mini

[19-Oct-18 07:22 PM] TheMiningPool#9076
@TrueCryptoMiner Let mi know if you need some help 😃

[19-Oct-18 07:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then you have connection issues either on your end or with the network

[19-Oct-18 07:22 PM] penguin#0544

[19-Oct-18 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810

[19-Oct-18 07:22 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562

[19-Oct-18 07:27 PM] Llama#1330
I'd like to know why someone is mining 42Msol/s lol

[19-Oct-18 07:27 PM] penguin#0544
this explosion of asics is quite the game changer... bit troubling tho in general :<>

[19-Oct-18 07:27 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
i agree

[19-Oct-18 07:27 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
but i think asic will take over soon

[19-Oct-18 07:27 PM] TrueCryptoMiner#5562
thats why i went with asic

[19-Oct-18 07:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I'd like to know why someone is mining 42Msol/s lol`
Because they want more than 2 coins a day?

[19-Oct-18 07:28 PM] penguin#0544
yeah, likewise -> Hopefully things like x16 and such remain untouched !!!

[19-Oct-18 07:29 PM] Llama#1330
42 Msol/day makes it less profitable for them lol

[19-Oct-18 07:29 PM] penguin#0544
but then again, there's the fpga and acorns rolling out....

[19-Oct-18 07:29 PM] Llama#1330
more profit but less % return

[19-Oct-18 07:30 PM] penguin#0544
yeah, how ironic !

[19-Oct-18 07:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`42 Msol/day makes it less profitable for them lol`
Actually, no; but 60 would

[19-Oct-18 08:08 PM] TheMiningPool#9076
oh nice.. I'll ask him

[19-Oct-18 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
