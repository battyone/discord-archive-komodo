U changed ur name yesterday

[26-Oct-18 12:33 AM] yousurnayme#1631
Does anyone know why the piratepool.io hashrate is around 80 MSol/s, yet the network hash is around 50 MSol/s? Shouldn't the pool hashrate be lower than the network hashrate?

[26-Oct-18 12:33 AM] Llama#1330
it takes a bit to update.

[26-Oct-18 12:33 AM] Llama#1330
I think the "nethash" is a 2 hour avg.

[26-Oct-18 12:34 AM] yousurnayme#1631
Ah okay

[26-Oct-18 12:34 AM] yousurnayme#1631
Is there a more frequently updated number somewhere?

[26-Oct-18 12:37 AM] Llama#1330
just add it up

[26-Oct-18 12:44 AM] yousurnayme#1631
As in add up the hashrates of all the pools?

[26-Oct-18 12:45 AM] yousurnayme#1631
Thanks for answering earlier btw

Anyone has successfully sold pirate coin here???

[26-Oct-18 01:01 AM] house#8741
absolutely @godgreat ... many successful OTC trades ... just be sure to qualify any trader with known community members here if you don't wish to use an escrow (of which there are a few about)

[26-Oct-18 01:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
getnetworkhashps

[26-Oct-18 01:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

[26-Oct-18 01:03 AM] at#4177

[26-Oct-18 01:03 AM] godgreat#0235

[26-Oct-18 01:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

[26-Oct-18 01:05 AM] godgreat#0235
I am new. Sorry for noob questions.  What is escrow?

[26-Oct-18 01:05 AM] house#8741
many guys here are long termers and will not damage their reputations ... you just need to find someone you are happy with

[26-Oct-18 01:06 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Trusted 3rd party that holds the funds ,  both parties send to the escrow,  the escrow sends it to the participants when everything checks out

[26-Oct-18 01:07 AM] at#4177
thanks

[26-Oct-18 01:08 AM] house#8741

Mr @SMR Hashem , ye shall find yerself a willing buyer/seller
ye both shall send me yer agreed funds 'n I shall make the swap ta both yer accounts
I take no fee fur me service
jest to ensure a peaceful trade is all```

[26-Oct-18 01:09 AM] godgreat#0235
He is trusted @Blackbeard????

[26-Oct-18 01:10 AM] house#8741

[26-Oct-18 01:11 AM] house#8741
Cap'n @FishyGuts is our most honourable Community leader

[26-Oct-18 01:12 AM] house#8741

[26-Oct-18 01:13 AM] house#8741

[26-Oct-18 01:16 AM] godgreat#0235

Officials of pirate or komodo are not interested in buying arrr??

[26-Oct-18 01:18 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I bought about 30K ARRR to date.

[26-Oct-18 01:18 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[26-Oct-18 01:19 AM] house#8741

Yes, you use a z address (as you would any other t or R address for other coins)

We’re a 100% privacy coin.

No public sends.  The most private protocol available.  Better than zcash according to their own devs..

Better than XMR in that we have no metadata to analyze on chain and we will have better integration support come Sapling.
