tbt, without jq for json I wouldn't have traded 1/1000th as much on barterdex as I have

[11-Oct-18 06:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If we weren't nerds, we wouldn't be up in the middle of the night talking to you on the interwebz 🤓

jq is a life saver once mastered I agree.

[11-Oct-18 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although I keep thinking there are better ways to do certain things.

[11-Oct-18 06:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I always just come back to jq filters and bash scripts just because they are now easy for me, and I have hundreds of lines of working code I cna copy paste to create scripts in very little time.

[11-Oct-18 06:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's a ton of jq I haven't even tried to use that's likely better than the way I do things

[11-Oct-18 06:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its extremly complex tool.... and the docs are not very good.

anyone know how to setup a pool to solomine off nicehash?

[11-Oct-18 06:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
same as to solo alone

[11-Oct-18 06:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
config a port, open it up, and let it fly

[11-Oct-18 06:15 AM] FishyGuts#5085

@AndrewK I think @blackjok3r  has a script.   He has a script for everything.

[11-Oct-18 06:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I have a pool that makes itself

[11-Oct-18 06:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

there's a guide for ravencoin, but the wallet option fields are different

that script will create the configs.. I think

[11-Oct-18 06:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
don't confuse him, he's new to backend of a strat 😛

[11-Oct-18 06:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@AndrewK most of the questions you'll have would likely be best asked in #talk-mining, rather than filling up this channel

[11-Oct-18 06:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
given that there's like 5 of us that could literally talk about nothing else for days and still have more to say 😛

[11-Oct-18 06:35 AM] AndrewK#3947
Thank you for the advice

@0x03  ... Pool Down !

[11-Oct-18 06:58 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Pool is down!!!! Xyz @0x03

[11-Oct-18 06:58 AM] 0x03#8822
relax

[11-Oct-18 06:58 AM] 0x03#8822
i'll have to pay closer attention whats happening there, as the pool itself is 'ok-ish'

[11-Oct-18 06:58 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Well if I hadn’t just dropped .25btc I’d be better relaxed lol

[11-Oct-18 06:59 AM] 0x03#8822
i'll probably say it a dozen times more: my pool is free.

[11-Oct-18 06:59 AM] 0x03#8822
if you expect anything from me, donate to me.

[11-Oct-18 07:00 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Sure. You’re right.

[11-Oct-18 07:00 AM] 0x03#8822
for now, pool is restarted. i'm getting a lot of 'socket hang up.' errors which are the cause for this ...hanguppy behaviour.

[11-Oct-18 07:01 AM] 0x03#8822
guess that means a change of plans for today.

[11-Oct-18 07:01 AM] 0x03#8822
i'll make sure to have a stable pool by tonight. sorry everybody

[11-Oct-18 07:02 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Well shoot guess I’m lucky I saw it. Out of bed to redirect miners. Lol

[11-Oct-18 07:11 AM] 0x03#8822
setup for the new pool stuff is now underway. i expect to be done by 2-3PM UTC

[11-Oct-18 10:04 AM] 0x03#8822
just in case somebody would like to help test the new pool; see https://arrr.pool-mining.xyz/

[11-Oct-18 10:05 AM] 0x03#8822
the sooner y'all use the new setup the better.

[11-Oct-18 10:05 AM] 0x03#8822
it has just gone up, so there may be issues, as it usually goes with new stuff.

[11-Oct-18 10:05 AM] 0x03#8822
but it's `properer` than the last one 😄

[11-Oct-18 10:39 AM] 0x03#8822
as soon as all miners have switched to the new infrastructure, the old pool will be restarted with an insanely low payout limit and without any stratum ports just to flush out the leftover payments.

[11-Oct-18 10:39 AM] 0x03#8822
and then the old pool setup will be sent to the hacksaw. should the old pool fail again, just switch the stratum hostname in your miner to `stratum.arrr.pool-mining.xyz` - the ports are the same.

We need to hardfork the emission down:trollface:

[11-Oct-18 11:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
emission isn't the problem

[11-Oct-18 11:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in fact, lower emission would actually exacerbate the problem

[11-Oct-18 11:39 AM] jorian#4555

[11-Oct-18 12:29 PM] Llama#1330
why am I only mining at 1/3 of what I'm supposed to be mining?

[11-Oct-18 12:31 PM] Llama#1330
hidden hashrate?

[11-Oct-18 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hash rate in daemon RPC is average

[11-Oct-18 12:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Llama emissions = how many new coins are created over a given time
as for what you're mining, you need to be more specific as to where you got "supposed to", what you're mining with (ie hashrate), and what you're getting

[11-Oct-18 12:32 PM] Llama#1330
I mined for ~ 12 hours with 12 msol/s

[11-Oct-18 12:32 PM] Llama#1330
only got 20k

[11-Oct-18 12:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
short term amounts will never be 100% in line with estimated rewards (especially if you increase *after* you calculate)

[11-Oct-18 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as "only 20k", I dunno why you imagined you'd get more

[11-Oct-18 12:35 PM] Oszy#5734
current estimate is 33k for that. but that's why it says  estimate only

[11-Oct-18 12:35 PM] SHossain#0007
i mined 8k in 1 minute using the z9 mini first time. miss those days :p

@Oszy is that with or without his 12M?

[11-Oct-18 12:35 PM] Oszy#5734
without

[11-Oct-18 12:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
his 12M would raise the diff and lower returns

[11-Oct-18 12:35 PM] Oszy#5734
exactly

[11-Oct-18 12:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because math

[11-Oct-18 12:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[11-Oct-18 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Llama all calculators need to be used *after* you add hash, in order to include that amount into the equation

[11-Oct-18 12:37 PM] Llama#1330
i know lol

[11-Oct-18 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and at the best of times it's just a rough educated guess

[11-Oct-18 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
luck is a factor in mining

[11-Oct-18 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
one which cannot be calculated

[11-Oct-18 12:38 PM] Oszy#5734
also someone else can get another 10msol while you mining and that straight flips up any calculation

[11-Oct-18 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that too

[11-Oct-18 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mining with rentals is not for the faint of heart

[11-Oct-18 12:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as an example, the diff has risen 148% in the last 25 minutes

[11-Oct-18 12:42 PM] scubapanda#2485
@Llama If you just finished mining now it might be a few hours before the pool has sent you all the rewards.

[11-Oct-18 12:42 PM] Llama#1330
I'm just looking at the `paid` and `immature` slots

[11-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Llama#1330
I guess I need to check right before my `immature` balance updates so it's more accurate

[11-Oct-18 12:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Welcome to the magical world of speculation mining; buckle your seat belt, you're in for a bumpy ride....

but thx for the late welcome 😛

If you've been mining at 12M for 2 weeks, I want your job
