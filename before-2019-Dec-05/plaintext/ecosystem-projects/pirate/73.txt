wouldnt this need to hit $10 a coin for it to be #50 CMC ?  thats 15,000,000 coins with a marketcap of 150 million

[28-Sep-18 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in 270 days I think half the supply is mined...

[28-Sep-18 05:36 AM] matt#3084
not half.. the block reward halves so only 128  coins per block are rewarded..

Give or take.

[28-Sep-18 05:40 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I think it is very achievable.   The people working here are already killing it.

[28-Sep-18 05:40 AM] matt#3084
sounds nice..  I'll keep mining it for now.. hope the nicehashers slow down some..

[28-Sep-18 05:40 AM] matt#3084
to lower the difficulty.

[28-Sep-18 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IMO the NH is unsustainable ... at some point those people have to run out of BTC.

[28-Sep-18 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are mining it and not selling.

[28-Sep-18 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but a coin emmission like this means for the first 270 days it will likley see huge hash rates

[28-Sep-18 05:42 AM] matt#3084
well u get new people buying.. trying to get those gainz! ha

[28-Sep-18 05:44 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

Yes

[28-Sep-18 05:45 AM] matt#3084
Z9s?  must be paying lots of tariffs!

[28-Sep-18 05:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes,  I lucked out a bit though ,  they didn't come til later and the tariff amount was reduced to 10%+2.7% instead of 25+2.7.

[28-Sep-18 05:47 AM] matt#3084

[28-Sep-18 06:48 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I remember looking at this when I first got my z9 minis and told myself.... Naw, I should try and ROI at least a few of these first.

[28-Sep-18 06:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Back when you and I would have been fighting for blocks!

[28-Sep-18 06:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[28-Sep-18 06:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

I'm having the feeling this fomo isn't good.... It feels like too much like a hype....

a gradual price increase I was expecting....

[28-Sep-18 06:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well mr whale... start selling at a lower price üòâ

[28-Sep-18 06:55 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Investors are different nowadays.    They often do want to jump in on the ground floor.  
Hopefully the efforts we are all taking to push awareness and adoption will take shape.  
Sapling and exchanges will be the catalyst to increase adoption.

[28-Sep-18 06:55 AM] FishyGuts#5085
And seriously... Someone better not make a DNM.    Just dont üòâ

[28-Sep-18 06:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The last i sold was at 0.06 and the going rate at that time was 0.08 ... I tried to lower the price, but there just are not enough people selling, I only had so much pirate to sell.

[28-Sep-18 06:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You bought all the rest üòâ
