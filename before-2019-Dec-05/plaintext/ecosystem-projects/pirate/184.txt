@VoskCoin  yea down haha

[19-Oct-18 03:17 PM] Flexatron#8809
And a lot of mini's on it now

[19-Oct-18 03:18 PM] Flexatron#8809
Your followers are small players:trollface:

[19-Oct-18 03:19 PM] BlockTech#6895
No seriously this morning hashrate was around 40Msol/s, a few hours after your video it went back to 80Msol/s. Maybe it's just a huge miner that got off a few hours, but the number of workers incresed drastically.

[19-Oct-18 03:19 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@VoskCoin - please DM @miketout about Verus.   The man is a wizard.   If you’re not familiar with his history... check him out and youll be blown away at his knowledge and likeliness to provide a huge benefit to the Komodo ecosystem.  

You’ve heard of .net yes?   Ask him about his involvement.   👍💪

[19-Oct-18 03:19 PM] VoskCoin#1869
@BlockTech do you have a rough number for works prior and after

[19-Oct-18 03:19 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Thanks again for your time yesterday.  Looking forward to doing a follow up.

[19-Oct-18 03:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
@VoskCoin something you might want to mention in your VRSC video is that VerusHash will be able to chosen instead of default Equihash for new KMD coins (and some will switch to it), so miners will have more than just VRSC coin to mine in the future, with their CPU/GPU rigs. And that means more future video material for you 😃

[19-Oct-18 03:20 PM] Flexatron#8809
Yea no. Of small workers increased

[19-Oct-18 03:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
i might be an old skool VRSC solo miner, before I was an ARRR CPU solo miner for 5 minutes, then the ASICs attacked

[19-Oct-18 03:20 PM] BlockTech#6895
https://dexstats.info/piratehash.php
And from around 60 Workers to 144 Workers, most of them with low hashrate, but it's nice that there is more people.

[19-Oct-18 03:20 PM] VoskCoin#1869
@dukeleto I am expiring as mining does 😄

[19-Oct-18 03:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is anyone manufacturing motherboards for the sole purpose of CPU mining rigs?

[19-Oct-18 03:22 PM] 0x03#8822
yes, there were multiple such boards

the mobo's that are geared towards miners/gamers are overpriced, with fancy lights

@Hollowman9000 check 'asrock h110 pro btc+ ' for example (lol)

[19-Oct-18 03:23 PM] 0x03#8822

Binance maintenance maybe had a hand in the hash drop as well

[19-Oct-18 03:24 PM] Flexatron#8809
Wanted to mine much earlier but had to get btc from elsewhere

@FishyGuts To bring back a couple days ago...
The last time my wife and I talked about Donzis was back in the 90s, so she didn't get the reference I made.
I went to show her a pic from a "for sale" ad.... 2010 model ....$189k 😲

[19-Oct-18 03:33 PM] modereck#4269

@FishyGuts Here is the guy at Morgan who supposedly working with ZCash
Umar Farooq, JPMorgan’s head of Blockchain initiatives
https://www.linkedin.com/in/umar-farooq-bab7ab47/
Based on format of media contacts I would guess his email is umar.farooq@jpmorgan.com
I wouldn't be qualified to engage him about Pirate. I worry the name might rattle a company like JPMorgan.

[19-Oct-18 03:57 PM] dukeleto#7326

@dukeleto Well they need some coin to recommend to their customers to hide money. Why not use Pirate instead of ZCash?

New to mining Pirate, how often does piratepool pay out?

[19-Oct-18 05:18 PM] 0x03#8822
according to https://piratepool.io/payments "about" every hour

[19-Oct-18 05:19 PM] Steve10#5203
@0x03 it sends to our wallet every hour?

[19-Oct-18 05:19 PM] 0x03#8822
check the timestamps on the page i linked, this is how often money is sent to the miners.

[19-Oct-18 05:19 PM] 0x03#8822
for all other questions, please ask the pool operator who is webworker01

[19-Oct-18 05:21 PM] ronyi#5719
~1hour, if balance >=1 PIRATE https://piratechain.org
