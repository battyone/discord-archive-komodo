[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> Well, there's your answer üòù

[05-Nov-19 10:57 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
how do you create a pirate address in the agama wallet?

[05-Nov-19 10:58 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I click generate new address and nothing happens

[05-Nov-19 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptoon> Are you fully synched?

[05-Nov-19 11:00 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
yes in native mode , I'm going to try litemode see if that works

[05-Nov-19 11:02 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
ok no litemode I guess, let me try reindexing

[dscrd-prt] <FishyGuts> Who wants to start a fundraiser to support this cause?

[06-Nov-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Ok I asked this in Hush, no response yet so I‚Äôll through it out here

[06-Nov-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> I hope I don‚Äôt get flamed for this, but....  what‚Äôs the short answer of the difference between Hush and Pirate?
What I see is: Pirate- all z-addr txs, sapling and sprout in chain, dPow. Hush- pruned chain so sapling only, z-addr optional, messaging, dPow.

[06-Nov-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <polycryptoblog> Pirate has sprout locked

[06-Nov-19 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <polycryptoblog> Main thing is the messaging application.  Pirate is more of a currency layer , Hush for private communications . At least that‚Äôs how I understood it

[06-Nov-19 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> pirate has private messaging as well

[06-Nov-19 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> supported in seven seas and in the new pirate wallet lite (not yet released, still in testing)

[06-Nov-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Hmmmok

[06-Nov-19 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> We're a heaping heckload more fun.  @Cam [Trivia Challenge!] üòú

[06-Nov-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Hahahah yeah, I can‚Äôt say anything too crazy, but my miners have been on pirate for a long time. I like hush for sure but never mined hush. I like the idea of the pruned blockchain because I see sapling mobile wallets as a useful future, but the zcash implementation of an electrum-like wallet has a really interesting future as well.

[06-Nov-19 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> @Cam [Trivia Challenge!]  Except the currency layer Hush purpose is not only 1:1 msg but also 1:many and possibility to publish sth staying anonymous.  Arrr is only 1:1 private communication.

[06-Nov-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Philtr> I just got this message. How to deal with it?

Hi, I see your project is taking LBank votes. Our team has a large number of LBank users, ensuring sufficient ticketing sources and secure victory. The voting process was conducted by the team in a confidential manner.

[06-Nov-19 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptoon> They are selling votes?

[06-Nov-19 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Philtr> We have no interest in that, I'd say. We need larger exchanges without fake volume.

[06-Nov-19 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Philtr> That would also explain the fake volume. Nothing is left to chance.

[06-Nov-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptoon> Yeah

Yes, I will vote for your project, but I know you have to pay $14 for 10,000 votes

We're a voting company, and we have enough votes for you to win

[dscrd-prt] <Philtr> #I think we dont need people who want to enrich themselves to get us ahead. That goes also in such a way. It just takes a little longer.

[07-Nov-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> this year is a test run therefore our sponsorship of the event was minimal

[07-Nov-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <zebedee> brilliant, ill be coming hopefully next year

[07-Nov-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> assuming all things go well, we'll ramp up the sponsorship in coming years and establish a foothold in Cayman's Financial Community

[07-Nov-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <zebedee> yeah i was thinking may be good idea to visit some solicitors and accountants and give some info

[07-Nov-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <zebedee> must have many clients interested in securing financial privacy

[07-Nov-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> that is in the plan, assuming there is enough time on hands

[07-Nov-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[07-Nov-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763

Since the markets are .. fluid- can anyone give me a reasonable estimate if it is safe to trade on altbits.com? like, after DP rebrand?
personally, I never had any issues there, but they got some bad rumours during the rebarnd ..

[07-Nov-19 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> well it still has the largest arrr volume and afaik there isn't anything bad known about it

[07-Nov-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <wookie25> yes, the altbits exchange works well. the issue during the rebrand was about ownership, but that doesn't seem to have affected the function
