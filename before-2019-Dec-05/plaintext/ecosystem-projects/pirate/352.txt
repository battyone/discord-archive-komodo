``` wishes everyone would be as excited about enamel pins as himself```

[29-Nov-18 12:57 PM] Cryptofist#7504
OH and I wanted to send a grass roots promo pack to those I could afford the shipping.

[29-Nov-18 01:30 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Some questions /comments I posted earlier
1. I have a short run pirate shirt just for the contest winners. 
2. I might make a second version of it.
3. Does anyone want an old logo shirt ?
4. Any ideas on layout for new logo (some were posted more are welcome!)
5. What should we do as an enamel pin ? 😄
Any other merch product ideas toss em at me!

[29-Nov-18 01:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
1. 👌 
3. Old logo is dedded 😂

[29-Nov-18 01:35 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Figured i would asssssssssssk

[29-Nov-18 01:35 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Not sure how many people got the voskcoin version

[29-Nov-18 01:35 PM] Syndicate.David#3850
@Cryptofist as we have discussed, I am in 100%.  Also, where are these contests being held??

[29-Nov-18 01:36 PM] Cryptofist#7504
The contest I did is over, winners were selected from mining pools.

[29-Nov-18 01:36 PM] Cryptofist#7504
The z9 and invite contests will be posted next week. (i think)

[29-Nov-18 01:36 PM] Cryptofist#7504
and plastered everywhere

[29-Nov-18 01:37 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@mrlynch  but you didnt respond to the enamel pin idea. 😜

[29-Nov-18 01:38 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I was looking at what I had on the flash sheet I made.

[29-Nov-18 01:38 PM] mrlynch#5735
5. The skull or the coin P logo

[29-Nov-18 01:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
I like the skull but it's not really foretelling of ARRR

[29-Nov-18 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`3. Does anyone want an old logo shirt ?`
Which logo and how many ARRR you want for them?

[29-Nov-18 01:44 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I was referring to the P eyepatch logo that got replaced recently.  Undecided, im flexible here $8-$20 usd per shirt (paid in ARRR), i'd like to print 12 at least total though.... Ill make one for rmyself so at least need 11 more.

[29-Nov-18 01:44 PM] Cryptofist#7504
is there interest in the red sword one? Ill make whatever you guys want, no problem.

[29-Nov-18 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh, if not already made, I can't see much point in you making a special order for older 'P' logo - I could see interest in the 'P/sword' one though

[29-Nov-18 01:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Making around a dozen to order isnt a big deal. I dont mind as long as it isnt ONE shirt. I get lots of one off shirt requests this time of year.

[29-Nov-18 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
personally, if I were to buy something, we'd have to agree that 1 ARRR > 2.7 cents though 😛

[29-Nov-18 01:51 PM] mrlynch#5735

well $0.3675 to $0.027 is a bit more of a value drop than I can take for spending on novelties

[29-Nov-18 01:57 PM] Syndicate.David#3850
I am in for a shirt...and a hat

[29-Nov-18 02:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
You can pay however you want, doesnt have to be ARRR.

[29-Nov-18 02:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504

@hfaz63 try deleting all files except `wallet.dat` from `C:\Users\Hadikhan\AppData\Roaming\Komodo\PIRATE\` and start again

[29-Nov-18 02:43 PM] KNOX#9338
make sure you have a backup of `wallet.dat` before deleting any files

[29-Nov-18 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`make sure you have a backup of wallet.dat before deleting any files`
yes, that 👆🏽

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 @Alright @Deleted User @ronyi @mrlynch @webworker01 and ANY testers, please test this new pre-compiled builds for Linux and Windows for zmigrate. `zmigrate` dAPP is included in the zip files. Thanks to @Decker for compiling Windows binaries for us. Please test on RKT chain first. All the steps required are already there on the release page. You can also test the `zmigrate` dAPP on VRSC mainnet (you need to be running VRSC specific wallet). Decker successfully tested using VerusCoin.
https://github.com/PirateNetwork/komodo/releases/tag/0.3.1-sapling-test
P.S.: macOS version will be there as soon as we can.

[29-Nov-18 03:19 PM] SHossain#0007
what happened?

[29-Nov-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was replacing the 8700 with a 9900 and it slipped, hit the socket and bent like 90 pins

[29-Nov-18 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it mostly works atm, but killed at least 1 RAM slot, somehow

[29-Nov-18 03:21 PM] house#8741

DP withdrawals off again, anyone knows for how long ?

so far, my opinion is:
2 more cores...

[29-Nov-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
until sapling, i think DP will be disabled. too many pirates mined directly to DP deposit addrs

sapling upgrade will help DP on that issue

it is critical, yes

use `sudo apt-get install libcurl4` and try again

[29-Nov-18 03:39 PM] KNOX#9338
i followed official instructions to build this Linux version. maybe try your locally compiled linux binaries for testing on Linux

[29-Nov-18 03:40 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@jl777c  could they just block withdrawals for wallets with > 10 utxo's ? or the issue is different one?

[29-Nov-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
what do you mean

[29-Nov-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
the exchange has a single wallet

[29-Nov-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
for all users

[29-Nov-18 03:41 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
well I thought there is many addresses so many wallets 😛

[29-Nov-18 03:41 PM] Cryptofist#7504
You guys are all badasses. I hope you know that. Thanks for you contributions to the project and space overall!

[29-Nov-18 03:41 PM] Cryptofist#7504
*high fives everyone*

[29-Nov-18 03:41 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but the problem is withhdrawing from specific address or wallet overall ?

[29-Nov-18 03:41 PM] Syndicate.David#3850
Hell yes! All around, the community is amazing.

[29-Nov-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
from the wallet

[29-Nov-18 03:41 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if I understand correctly problem is withdraw from addr where utxo count > N. Then blocking that addr would be sufficient

[29-Nov-18 03:41 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Blocking all is killing trades

[29-Nov-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[29-Nov-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
internally, all deposits are swept into a single main address

[29-Nov-18 03:42 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok so it's a diff problem

[29-Nov-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why i warned against mining to exchange address

[29-Nov-18 03:42 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
internal processing too hard

[29-Nov-18 03:44 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
when the solution is to expect people behave correctly and scale + anonymity is in the game we can forget people will obey

[29-Nov-18 03:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
good sapling is coming

[29-Nov-18 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810

If I have 46 Z9mini miners would Pirate be the best thing to mine ?

[29-Nov-18 04:07 PM] Madzi#5769
You think it’s worth mining and holding this coin till it goes on more exchanges ?

[29-Nov-18 04:09 PM] Cryptofist#7504
it is my personal opinion but, I would absolutely mine a large chunk to hold for .... a long time.

[29-Nov-18 04:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
One of the contributors is definitely looking at different exchanges to get ARRR on to.
After the updates.... it looks like this will be less of task for exchanges to list ARRR.

[29-Nov-18 04:31 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'd actually use this to see how many ARRR you'd be expecting to get, based on current difficulty.
