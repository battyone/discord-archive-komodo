[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `without arcane commands required`
the word arcane was arcane until you got educated

github is consistant

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `with basic setup questions`
what questions? define the exact level of "basic"...

[28-Nov-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `it should work predictably, with minimal need for debug commands or restarts`
No one here can control when M$ft decides to add the RandomDataCorruption feature to Windows setups, that is wholly at their discretion

[28-Nov-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> @Cam [Trivia Challenge!] feel free to elaborate any of those points at your convenience

[28-Nov-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Both Apple and Microshaft publish human interface guidelines.  There are also standards coming from different schools. 

arcane = understood by few, so it goes with "basic"   make a wallet that a peson new to cryptocurrency can understand.  

github is not currently consistent, in terms of where the pirate wallets are.  As I mentioned, the sevenseas on piratenetwork git doesn't work. 

I'm really not talking about microshaft in this instance, but predictable still applies. No matter the platform, the install process should be similar. 

And this is all coming from a perspective that I'm happy to help where I can, but I'm not a coder. I'm not trying to argue; I hope my answers give my perspective clearly.

[28-Nov-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `make a wallet that a peson new to cryptocurrency can understand`
tell me what that means.....
what is it that cannot be understood?

[28-Nov-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `Both Apple and Microshaft publish human interface guidelines.`
The Office Metro guidelines are like 397 pages and almost no user like it, so there's that.
`I'm not trying to argue`
I'm honestly not either
The problem is that we keep hearing the same thing, but with no defining bits that really say anything other than "make it different, I don't know how different, just different"

[28-Nov-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Well the answer is predictable and as few clicks as possible, with zero command line needed.  New users don't know what ```./pirated``` means or is doing in their system.

[28-Nov-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> I honestly think for Linux, the best answer is Snapcraft snaps.  Work in most amd64 linux distributions

[28-Nov-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> For mac a DMG that drag and drop to applications shortcut works

[28-Nov-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> For windoze, a stock install program that many QT wallets use with the option of changing the default data dir is best.

[28-Nov-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `the answer is predictable`
In stead of continuing to ask "what does that mean?", I'll ask it this way......
What **isn't** *predictable* and what are you expecting when something else happens/appears?
Give specific examples that can actually be remedied and the remedy.

[28-Nov-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `for Linux, the best answer is Snapcraft snaps.`

Snapcraft - Snaps are universal Linux packages
Snaps are containerised software packages that are simple to create and install. They auto-update and are safe to run. And because they bundle their dependencies, they work on all major Linux systems without modification.

[28-Nov-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `as few clicks as possible`
so your answer is to install an app that installs an app to install apps?

[28-Nov-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> SevenSeas and pirateocean both don't always work when I've downloaded them. I've done about 6 diffeent linux installs in the last few weeks (one drive I have has four partitions, each for a different distro) and I download the wallets and sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. They hang, or they say they need the daemon.  But which daemon? komodod or pirated? or both?  Sometimes one works then after reboot it doesn't work. Or I have to start it manually, sometimes not.  (Not ranting about the behaviour, I like testing stuff, just trying to answer your question).

[28-Nov-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Snaps are actually quite cool.  I hear what you're saying and probably would have said the same thing 3 months ago.

[28-Nov-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `I download the wallets and sometimes they work and sometimes they don't`
what doesn't work in PirateOcean?
I can't fix what I don't know is "broken"

[28-Nov-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Download pirate-qt-linux, if you click on it in file manager you get an error that there is no application installed for "shared library" files

[28-Nov-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> in terminal ``` ./pirate-qt-linux``` returns ```bash: ./pirate-qt-linux: Permisssion denied```

[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> ```sudo ./pirate-qt-linux``` returns ```sudo: ./pirate-qt-linux: command not found
```

[28-Nov-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> I forgot chmod +x pirate-qt-linux

[28-Nov-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kaks> @Cam [Trivia Challenge!] execute 
chmod +x  pirate
Then ./pirate-qt-linux

[28-Nov-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> this is good feedback

[28-Nov-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> and now, just talking about predictability, I closed sevenseas which DID start my daemon this time, but it doesn't stop the daemon, so now pirateocean can't get a lock.  and the sevenseas doesn't include pirate-cli so I can't issue a ```./pirate-cli stop``` command

[28-Nov-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> so I have to kill the process after looking it up with htop

[28-Nov-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kaks> Move your topic to #pirate-ocean pls

[28-Nov-19 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> This really started as just the thought process of making Pirate easy to use- I know it devolved into specifics of wallets, and it's not as much trouble shooting as it is trying to make ARRR more accessible to the masses

[28-Nov-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `this is good feedback`
except for the fact that permissions is an issue that is beyond our control

[28-Nov-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `This really started as just the thought process of making Pirate easy to use`
yes, and that's why I didn't move to a chan because Pirate isn't just any one wallet
for all we know the best solution that might come out of this is a wallet that doesn't even exist yet ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[28-Nov-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> CG: Th `chmod` could be handled in a one-click install-script...

[28-Nov-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> agreed

[28-Nov-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> @salmonskinrolI I've given serious thought to having 2 bash files (one to "install" and one to run), but I fear that more files than what we have now would be more confusing than what we have now (I still haven't been able to find a way through first timers understanding the install zcash-params error)

[28-Nov-19 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> hmmm, let me look up some code snippets.. brb

[28-Nov-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Yeah the zcash params are something that people may need some hand-holding through.

[28-Nov-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> BTW I am succesfully running pirateocean now. It worked great with my existing wallet and params and chain.  I forgot that one reason i switched to sevenseas is because PO doesn't show tx info (just feedback for you Genie. some people may prefer that)

[28-Nov-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> yeah, I haven't learned how to do that yet, but it will be added as soon as I do

[28-Nov-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> I do think the interface is better (simpler more predicable LOL)

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> that's literally what we already have

[28-Nov-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> just no `-` in the script name

[28-Nov-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> In the run script you could include this to check if the daemon is already running:
```
count=$(/opt/pirate/pirate.sh getconnectioncount)
case $count in
    ''|*[!0-9]*) dstat=0 ;;
    *) dstat=1 ;;
esac
if [[ "$dstat" == "0" ]]; then
    /opt/pirate/start.sh
fi
```
Obviously you need to put a path parameter in there.

[28-Nov-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> and who is explaining to folks how to get it into /opt/ if running from Downloads is confusing? üòõ

[28-Nov-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Hence the path parameter...

[28-Nov-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Basically what you need is one install script and an explainer how to run it on the download page... the script can check and install zcash parameters, bootstrap (if desired), set rights... The whole shebang.

ZCoin employs Proof of Work with the Lyra2 algorithm, and has a total supply of 21.4 million coins. XZC uses the zerocoin algorithm, which essentially works by ‚Äúburning‚Äù a coin (and its history), and ‚Äúminting‚Äù a new coin. Zerocoin has its merits, however, it does not hide the transaction value. Moreover, zerocoin minting is an optional feature for ZCoin. At the time of this writing, less than a 10% of ZCoin‚Äôs transactions use minted coins. This leaves over 90% of the transactions as datapoints for chain analysis and reverse transaction lookup. ZCoin transactions hide the sender‚Äôs identity, however, receiver addresses and the transaction values are broadcast on the blockchain, this is only pseudo-privacy.

[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> ```While the Zcoin team states in one of their blog posts explaining the issue they ‚Äúbelieve that Zerocoin can be fixed given sufficient time,‚Äù they have decided to not spend more resources to try to fix it, abandoning the protocol for a new one called Sigma. This new development has accelerated that substitution. Sigma resolves several problems Zerocoin presented, and improves the blockchain security, they claim.```

[29-Nov-19 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> ```However, electing not to wait, developers released a new mandatory security update that disables Zerocoin mints and spends in anticipation of the Sigma release. Zcoin was not the only cryptocurrency impacted. PIVX, another project that uses Zerocoin to implement privacy spends as a feature on their network, has also decided to abandon it and convert all their zPIV (the currency minted using Zerocoin) to a non-privacy coin and disable privacy spends.```
