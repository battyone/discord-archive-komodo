probably a good thing too, cause no way the pool system could handle a z transaction every minute

[12-Nov-18 06:08 PM] jansako#3330
at this point at least

[12-Nov-18 06:08 PM] jansako#3330
And, you would not know who generated what to begin with üòÉ

[12-Nov-18 06:09 PM] jansako#3330
just coins magically appearing but not able to tell if the pool paid out or not...

Questions about the tipping and raining.  Do I have the discord app open to receive that,  also how does the bot know what my $arrr address is?

[12-Nov-18 06:18 PM] Flexatron#8809
you have a unique one attached to your discord account

[12-Nov-18 06:19 PM] Flexatron#8809
from where you can withdraw to your actual wallet

[12-Nov-18 06:19 PM] Flexatron#8809
you have to be online to have a chance to receive rains and squals and what not

[12-Nov-18 06:19 PM] Flexatron#8809
except for direct tips

[12-Nov-18 06:20 PM] Flexatron#8809

Where do i find this account? Checked settings...didn‚Äôt see it.  Sorry, little new to discord.

[12-Nov-18 06:29 PM] Flexatron#8809
you have your own dedicated conversation with the arrrtip bot

[12-Nov-18 06:29 PM] Flexatron#8809
then type !arrrtip help

[12-Nov-18 06:29 PM] Flexatron#8809
in that conversaton

[12-Nov-18 06:30 PM] Flexatron#8809
click home in the left top button

[12-Nov-18 06:30 PM] Flexatron#8809
then under direct messages you should have it

I think coinbases (initial block reward) are transparent for coin supply and auditing reasons.

It offers theoretical untraceability benefits, but the project is far too small to provide better protection for most users.

It is definitely less secure than Monero. I do not buy their "backed by Bitcoin's PoW" argument. Just because no one has bothered attacking a service does not mean it is secure.

[12-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Flexatron#8809
As Einsteinium has been attacked before right?

Hey guys... just a heads up... Digital Price was updating their wallets this morning.   
They have a LOT of ARRR on the exchange hotwallets and we are going to have them move some of these coins to cold storage for safety and security.  
You may experience some wallet delays today so that is something to keep in mind.  
That could also be part of the hangup this morning. 
Please let the exchange know if you are missing any coins for more than an hour with their ticket support system.  

Thank you for your patience.

[12-Nov-18 07:47 PM] Flexatron#8809
I assume a million or 2 must be sitting there atm yea..:rum:

[12-Nov-18 07:48 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
