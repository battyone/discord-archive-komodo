[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> I've got some RVN on CB but I'm not going to KYC to get them out. It looks like it's their final way to sell our personal data and walk off with the coins of those who don't KYC. Absolute Wankers !

[02-Dec-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> > ...final way to sell our personal data....
that was literally my 1st thought when I read their statement

[02-Dec-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> $0.20 - $0.90 / profile - times must be really hard

[dscrd-prt] <aDamboi> question is when

[02-Dec-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> @Bradbury you can sell your coins for bts and withdraw them (using "send" button) without kyc

[02-Dec-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Wtf lol

[dscrd-prt] <KOSIUS> @Draeth fake account

[02-Dec-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <KOSIUS> was looking at it earlier and I was like wtf, but then saw it wasn't the real one

[02-Dec-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <KOSIUS> they deleted all of their accounts so...

[02-Dec-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Ahhhh

[02-Dec-19 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> @Diablo_  this doesn't work as it will not even let me trade unless I KYC

[02-Dec-19 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> blocking trading is just on client side. use the official bitshares client to trade https://wallet.bitshares.org/#/

[02-Dec-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> remind me again please anyone who remembers: were CryptoBridge the arrogant shitheads that wanted a 3 BTC listing fee for ARRR?
which the community luckily did _not_ give them, although there were some serious considerations to do so?

[02-Dec-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> unfortunately we were listed on cryptobridge and they caused a bit of a debacle with poor bookkeeping methods

[02-Dec-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> ooops ... and did were they the ones that got 3 BTC?

[02-Dec-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <KOSIUS> 2.5

[02-Dec-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> fuck .. I vaguely remember the discussions .. about how they should be given a chance and all that shit

[02-Dec-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> well, we did the right thing

[02-Dec-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> ... ?

[02-Dec-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> paying 2.5 BTC for getting listed on a scam exchange that exit scams 3 weeks later?

[02-Dec-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> as in, not given them a chance once we found out what they were doing

[02-Dec-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> we got listed in march iirc so, probably before they had the exit in mind

[02-Dec-19 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> was that in March? maybe I am confusing some things here, bcs I remember the listing fee discussion some time in October/ or so

[02-Dec-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> but good that the damage was contained somewhat

[02-Dec-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> you have a different event in mind

[02-Dec-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> :rum: üë®‚Äçü¶Ω

[02-Dec-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> i'm talking about this
<https://pirate.black/pirate-chain-press-release-01/>

[02-Dec-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> i guess now that they're closing down i can release some details that will showcase their incompetence
for entertainment purposes of course :troll:

[02-Dec-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> ah sure- now I remember, the CB thing was when 1.8 million ARRR got snarfed there, and then dumped

[02-Dec-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> yes please do! always fun!

[02-Dec-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> a little bit like cryptsy in small

[02-Dec-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> it wasn't 1.8M arrr that was snarfed, but more like 2 M bridge.arrr (their token)

[02-Dec-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> they only had around 140k arrr in their accounts when i discovered what they were doing, but a liability towards their users of 1.8M

[02-Dec-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> I shamelessly admit: I bought 300,000 ARR @ 400Sat after that- so either I will look very stupid or like an investment genius eventually

[02-Dec-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> interesting thing to do, sleuthing such amateur incompetence/ shenanigans

[02-Dec-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> what happened was that a few users discovered the bug and simply ripped them off.. they created bridge.arrr tokens out of thin air, withdrawed as much arrr as they could (when you withdrew arrr from crypto-bridge, you essentially burned bridge.arrr tokens 1:1 with how much arrr you wanted)

[02-Dec-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> when they could withdraw no more they simply dumped for btc and withdrew that thus shifting the liability of unbacked bridge.arrr to other users

[02-Dec-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> sounds a bit like what went down in cryptsy, only smaller

[02-Dec-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> and the handling of the situation was just appaling.. i told them half-heartedly what the issue might be (after exhausting all other possible logical explanations) and it took them a week to come clean

[02-Dec-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> 1 week in which users continued to be ripped off

[02-Dec-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> and months before that when they simply refused to stop trading until we figured out what was going on

[02-Dec-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> trading fees must go on

[02-Dec-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> Karpeles syndrome: half-assed amateurs in the deep, way over their heads.. üêë üêë üêë  ü¶à

[02-Dec-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> all the while stating in public that the pirate daemon is faulty ü§£

[02-Dec-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> seems they now demand KYCed stool samples from the remaining depositors in the hope that they can keep a few coins

[02-Dec-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> `sounds a bit like what went down in cryptsy, only smaller` not really.. cb did it over a lengthy period of time
rvn had this 3 times, denarius at least once, i think they did it with vrsc as well

[02-Dec-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> yes and that claim of theirs that under eu law all withdraws need kyc is false
under eu law you only need to kyc if you handle fiat, or if withdraws are higher than 5-10k eur / day / user

[02-Dec-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> depending on the country

[02-Dec-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> so it is just an attempt at holding on to coins and potentially get some money out of kyc profiles (selling data is a thing)

[02-Dec-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> <https://docs.developer.fractal.id/user-integration/user-information-retrieval>
whether you kyc or not, they win
disgusting

[02-Dec-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> `under eu law you only need to kyc if you handle fiat, or if withdraws are higher than 5-10k eur / day`
That's not quite true

[02-Dec-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> oh really?

[02-Dec-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> dunno- we have been waiting for AtomicDex for a long time now- and ARRR on ATomicDex will take some more tweaking as I understand - but ultimately, there seems no other robust option

[02-Dec-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> where are they incorporated?

[02-Dec-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> denmark

[02-Dec-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> ARRR! ... loool!

[02-Dec-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> of all places

[02-Dec-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> aml5 is not in effect yet

[02-Dec-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> and under aml4 there are no overly dramatic provisions for kyc.. yes you need to do it as an exchange but only after certain limits or if you handle fiat

[02-Dec-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> AML5 is in effect in most countries already

[02-Dec-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> and mandatory for all countries by jan 2020

[02-Dec-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> even if you handle fiat there is a limit after which kyc is mandatory

[02-Dec-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> but you can still get away with few hundred eur without

[02-Dec-19 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> AMLD5 requires KYC and AML counter measures for custodian wallet providers even

[02-Dec-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> it does, trying to find if denmark adopted it or not

[02-Dec-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> amld5 - another tool of opression btw

[02-Dec-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> afaik denmark was called out by the eu comission already for being late with AMLD5 implementation

[02-Dec-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> that's likely also the reason why CB made it without any phasing time

[02-Dec-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> üçπ üèùÔ∏è Cheers guys! I'll chill

[02-Dec-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> europe doesn't seem to be a good place anymore

[02-Dec-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> the good places become rarer and rarer üò≠

[02-Dec-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> a place with no eu and us influence? where some form of liberty exists?! ü§î

[02-Dec-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> I have been looking at Paraguay

[02-Dec-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> CHINA! :troll:

[02-Dec-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> i said liberty

[02-Dec-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> South America certainly has its peculiarities, but I am looking at getting me a residence there

[02-Dec-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> may be a pipe dream, but won't know w/o looking closely

[02-Dec-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> idk if many south american countries qualify as good places to live

[02-Dec-19 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> me neither, but it SA is a big place with big differences

[02-Dec-19 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> sure

[02-Dec-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> there are certainly many places with a well earned bad reputation, but also some quiet ones that usually don't get that much attention

[02-Dec-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> Paraguay for example, or Uruguay / Monte Video

[02-Dec-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> I fear it won't be easy to find a place with low criminality, good economy, good health system, good education system, no opression, no corruption etc.

[02-Dec-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> thats a tall wish list, will rply need to make some amends on few ot those üìú

[02-Dec-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> `I fear it won't be easy to find a place with low criminality, good economy, good health system, good education system, no opression, no corruption etc.` if you have enough $$ you could get all private no?

[02-Dec-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> but yea, of course people have different needs/wishes. Maybe someone enjoys a small village as long as it is peaceful

[02-Dec-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> what about Panama?

[02-Dec-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Dec-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> and they can be very difficult with foreigners

[02-Dec-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Dec-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
