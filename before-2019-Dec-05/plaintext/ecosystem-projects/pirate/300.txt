That's not true.

[12-Nov-18 02:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
A single Z9 costs as much as a high end video card and hashes 10-15 x as strong at the same electric cost.

[12-Nov-18 02:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Z9 mini*

[12-Nov-18 02:05 AM] FishyGuts#5085
A single Z9 or A9 costs less than a 6 GPU rig and hashes well over 10X as strong at a similar electric cost.

[12-Nov-18 02:05 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Now...

[12-Nov-18 02:05 AM] FishyGuts#5085
What you ARE betting on is hardware obselesence...

[12-Nov-18 02:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
But some people are still running ASICs 2 years in....  a GPU from 2 years ago is not going to remain competetive much longer.

[12-Nov-18 02:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Now, I would argue that the ASIC will out earn the GPUs so much so that the resale value is a moot point.

[12-Nov-18 02:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
THat and the amount of hardware and environmental waste created is less with ASIC's ( is my guess).

[12-Nov-18 02:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Then again...

[12-Nov-18 02:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I have 21 GPUs running and would argue for those too 100%.

[12-Nov-18 02:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So really @Captain_Jack it boils down to a lot of things and ones position on the issue.

@Captain_Jack `My question isn't about 51% for asic resistance...it is mass participation`
Then you phrased your question wrong and, as @FishyGuts points out, you're misinformed

[12-Nov-18 02:08 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
I do think asics are the new norm...just sucks that the system seems to let the rich get richer...btw...i use asics myself...but I do miss the time a kid could participate...nostalgia i guess

[12-Nov-18 02:09 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
I may well be misinformed...open to correction...I'm a developer nothing more.

[12-Nov-18 02:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`just sucks that the system seems to let the rich get richer`
Given that a new ASIC costs less than a new GPU, I can't see the logic in your claim

[12-Nov-18 02:11 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
I may be misinformed...I've read that large farms can purchase asics before general public...in bulk amounts...is that really true?

[12-Nov-18 02:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, and in the same context, if you spend $30 million, you can have thousands of 2080TIs delivered by Friday

[12-Nov-18 02:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at a discount per

[12-Nov-18 02:13 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
yes but everyone has opportunity to that product...the issue as I understand it (not first hand) is that not everyone can purchase said asics?

[12-Nov-18 02:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The fact that a given country may have embargoes or whatever should not dictate the algorithm of any currency, ever

Haha same as gas vs diesel.

[12-Nov-18 02:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Redbeard except thousands of people haven't been slaughtered over GPUs and ASICs :trollface:

[12-Nov-18 02:16 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Captain_Jack I purchased 10 asics when they came out recently for Equihash.   I'm wishing I bought 90 more 😃

[12-Nov-18 02:16 AM] Redbeard#8343
The truck argument genie not the slaughter for oil

[12-Nov-18 02:16 AM] FishyGuts#5085
And I am just a garage miner running to his electric limit.

[12-Nov-18 02:17 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
@FishyGuts thanks for the perspective...I agree.  As I said I use miners and sold all my gpu's because I really like Pirate and think we have a limited mining window before the big boys make mining it 1/2 as productiive

`I'm wishing I bought 90 more` I'll sell you 50 minis @ $4k each

6 BTC volume on ARRR on Digital Price.

[12-Nov-18 02:18 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
because I'm not rich and wanted to go all in on ARRR

[12-Nov-18 02:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`6 BTC volume` right after I move all my offers back to KMD 😭

[12-Nov-18 02:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
GPUs still make bank, you just need to do something else with them 
_sells nothing_ 😉

[12-Nov-18 02:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I love that the VRSC GPU miner came out right after everyone offloaded their GPUs 😈

[12-Nov-18 02:21 AM] FishyGuts#5085
1 BTC.    5 BTC worth on KMD.

[12-Nov-18 02:21 AM] FishyGuts#5085
26,400 KMD volume 24 hours 💪

[12-Nov-18 02:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@dyorguy its the same price as the floor price on the exchange but you can only buy 77.7 at a time.

[12-Nov-18 02:33 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Potato Guy 9000 You're a fun character.   Are you mining this?  Or Perhaps KMDICE?   I finally switched a few rigs to KMDICE today.

@FishyGuts any mining calculator for kmdice?

[12-Nov-18 03:17 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@at I don’t know.  @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 would know. 

Net hash / your hash x blockreward daily= your daily estimate rewards.

[12-Nov-18 03:17 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I think.
