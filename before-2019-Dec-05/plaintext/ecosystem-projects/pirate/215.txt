[24-Oct-18 08:31 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@Flexatron  I think 10% growth daily is reasonable

[24-Oct-18 08:31 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
as long as Fishy runs these fine contests

[24-Oct-18 08:31 AM] Flexatron#8809

[24-Oct-18 08:31 AM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
i guess i just read it wrong.. 50 online and idle users.. assumed it would say 25 online and 25 idle users, however it seems it soaked on 50 people both online and idle

[24-Oct-18 08:31 AM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
got it, sorry

[24-Oct-18 08:32 AM] Flexatron#8809

[24-Oct-18 09:26 AM] jeezy#3408

[24-Oct-18 10:03 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
once this exchange listing becomes live i reckon more hash will turn up

[24-Oct-18 10:06 AM] jeezy#3408
@Dr4gonTrader   just point your  miners towards the pool,  info in getting started tab

[24-Oct-18 10:06 AM] jeezy#3408

[24-Oct-18 10:40 AM] jeezy#3408
will try to put a steady stream of 10 MSol on it to provide some hash for the next couple days

[24-Oct-18 10:40 AM] jeezy#3408
should be getting some blocks if we take 100-150MSol global

[24-Oct-18 11:33 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Same one I’ve used from day one

[24-Oct-18 11:33 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
It was the one on the website I think it’s called dtsm or something

[24-Oct-18 11:34 AM] ronyi#5719

@jl777c  is that possible to detect "weak computer" and 3+ utxos for z address, so that a button will pop up to send to onself to merge utx o's ?

[24-Oct-18 11:39 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
some miners sending really long time like 1h

[24-Oct-18 11:39 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if they pre-send to themselves before (and if they new they should seein some popup button) might be easier

[24-Oct-18 11:39 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or maybe does not matter as sapling will come soon ?

[24-Oct-18 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
GUI can do this, but sapling will solve all this

[24-Oct-18 11:41 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
since the "Fishy" :pirate:  marketing already works hard good to not get rejected by some user % due to usability  if a quick fix doable... maybe gui guys good insert some notification with proper message

[24-Oct-18 11:41 AM] 0x03#8822
omg. can we have the 'Good GUI Greg' meme?

[24-Oct-18 11:42 AM] 0x03#8822
(i'll show myself out)

[24-Oct-18 11:44 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also to hid the T address / small ui fixes but good for newbies

[24-Oct-18 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
yes new version in testing pretty sure hides the taddr
