in equihash the meaning of hash vs sol is malleated

Difference Between Hashes vs Solutions?
Sol/s measures the rate at which Equihash solutions are found. Each one of those solutions is tested against the current target (after adding to the block header and hashing), in the same way that in Bitcoin each nonce variation is tested against the target. That is what we m...

i seem to fail at google sometimes, sorry

[05-Oct-18 02:19 PM] 0x03#8822
so sol/s is like h/s - but the actual meaning of the terms would differ?!

[05-Oct-18 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
meh that wasn't the one I was actually looking for; there was one explanation that was deeper (the whole 'solve for x' analogy)

[05-Oct-18 02:20 PM] 0x03#8822
i understand it like this: hash/s shouldn't be called hash/s

[05-Oct-18 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
99.9999999% of the time 1 sol=1 hash

Can someone explain me where the essential difference are between Monero, Zcash and PIRATE?

[05-Oct-18 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
XMR requires all tx to be private. ZEC doesnt, but has better privacy tech.

[05-Oct-18 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is the best of both, required zero knowledge tx

[05-Oct-18 02:51 PM] Seko#7408
Zksnarks is better than ct-Ring? Which essential difference?

[05-Oct-18 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
a 10way ring sig means your tx always has your signature in it

[05-Oct-18 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
so you get plausible deniability, but still need to deny it was you

[05-Oct-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
with zksnark, there is no info about who sent, who received, and how much, it is zero footprint

[05-Oct-18 02:57 PM] 0x03#8822
with XMR and such others could break your privacy. with zero knowledge, you'll have to help them

[05-Oct-18 02:57 PM] 0x03#8822
a lot

[05-Oct-18 02:58 PM] Seko#7408
This means 10 rings check the transaction.  With all 10 you could draw conclusions?

[05-Oct-18 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
well yes that and the big issue is that for a tx that you do, you are one of the 10

[05-Oct-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so imagine a trail of all these transactions, each has your signature in it along with 9 others

[05-Oct-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
with PIRATE,  you cant tell who is sending, who is receiving or for how much. nothing to deny

if that is XMR's only argument over PIRATE, it is relatively short lived

I wonder if the weekend will result in higher hash or lower

[05-Oct-18 04:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As it seems most hash is rented, so maybe in weekends more people have time to rent out some hash to point to ARRR?

[05-Oct-18 04:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
"\nReturns the estimated network solutions per second based on the last n blocks.\n"
yes Msol is just average over last 120 blocks
diff adjustments over 17 block window, so that is why diff is more volatile
which means the diff will appear to lead the Msols
like SMA 17 vs SMA.120
but not exactly as diff has caps per adjustment and isnt a pure MA
thanks! I never knew this until now

I was thinking about PIRATE coin today and privacy coins in general. And even if you build the best privacy coin, the price volatility problem remains. You might have small groups of people trading it, maybe some even using it as a currency, but it would probably never have large adoption. If it had the features of a stable coin, pegged to FIAT money or gold, but with strong privacy features, that might be used more widely. But not easy to do I imagine.

[05-Oct-18 06:23 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@D2D privacyalternatives.com after Pirate will be shiped to some CEXes liquidity will jump and price should be more or less stable (as for crypto market standards)
