Our biggest hurdle is public / government sentiment on privacy coins we feel.

[01-Dec-18 11:57 AM] gets#8925
do u guys think veruscoin might switch to ouroboros with snarks since that paper was released?

[01-Dec-18 11:57 AM] FishyGuts#5085
No way.

[01-Dec-18 11:58 AM] gets#8925
haha ok

[01-Dec-18 11:58 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@miketout the Lead dev at Verus is a wizard.   He has things well under control there.     We’re big fans of that project too.

[01-Dec-18 11:58 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The man helped create windows 95, java, and .net. Most recently was the VP at Microsoft.

[01-Dec-18 11:59 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Has worked in other tech startups in innovation industries.

[01-Dec-18 11:59 AM] gets#8925
well, I still think having private proof of stake is a huge advantage, and up till that paper it could only be done with zerocoin

[01-Dec-18 11:59 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Know he’s found his life love in blockchain.   Spoke to him a week ago for a half hour.  I was genuinely floored and impressed.

[01-Dec-18 11:59 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Sounds like innovation.

[01-Dec-18 12:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I like innovation.

[01-Dec-18 12:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I’ll read into it and talk with mike.  👍

Thanks for stopping by.  Feel free to send over your new developments.   We’ve got some people and referrals we could discuss too if applicable.  

I’m off to bed. It’s 4 AM.

[01-Dec-18 12:01 PM] gets#8925
sadly they start off the paper with a falsehood

[01-Dec-18 12:01 PM] gets#8925
stating it’s the first private pos

[01-Dec-18 12:01 PM] gets#8925
as PIVX had private staking with zerocoin back in may

@miketout - https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1105.pdf

[01-Dec-18 12:02 PM] gets#8925
but it’s the first one using snarks

[01-Dec-18 12:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As to the info and validity... with so many small projects and large projects making so many moves and so much innovation, I can forgive them for making that assumption.   For certain.

[01-Dec-18 12:03 PM] gets#8925
yea, I mailed them and they seemed to have honestly missed it

[01-Dec-18 12:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
☝️

[01-Dec-18 12:03 PM] gets#8925
hope they’ll add it in a revision though

[01-Dec-18 12:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Much good comes from people who have pride in their work. I’m genuinely curious to see it and when they fix it.   Keep me posted. 😜

@FishyGuts (FishyGuts#5085)
You tipped @gets **499.9999 ARRR**
A network fee of 0.0001 ARRR was deducted from the amount.
This operation is pending. You will be notified when when it has finished.

[01-Dec-18 12:04 PM] gets#8925
wow thanks, now I need to download your wallet haha

[01-Dec-18 12:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The bot will hold them securely... you will have to transfer to a sapling address after 12/15/2018 and before 2/15/2019

[01-Dec-18 12:05 PM] gets#8925
or maybe I’ll stick around and tip the good folks here

[01-Dec-18 12:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
No rush.  👍

[01-Dec-18 12:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The bot works in a few other servers too like Space Peso. (Don’t ask, because I don’t know but they seem like good people. 😜)

[01-Dec-18 12:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If you want that or the KMD tipbot or a referral to the dev, let me know.

[01-Dec-18 12:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That being the arrr tip bot.

[01-Dec-18 12:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We provide them free to any other servers that want them.  👍

Any idea when withrawals will be available on digitalprice??

[01-Dec-18 01:00 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
after 15 Dec

[01-Dec-18 03:05 PM] Cassius#9158
What's the best wallet for ARRR, or is it worth waiting until after 15 Dec to get set up now?

[01-Dec-18 03:08 PM] SHossain#0007
Agama 43d or above or plain CLI

[01-Dec-18 03:08 PM] SHossain#0007
after 15 Dec it will get faster to process z transaction if you use sapling only

[01-Dec-18 03:09 PM] SHossain#0007
sprout will be disabled by 15 Feb 2019

[01-Dec-18 03:17 PM] Cassius#9158
Thanks. Having some problems with Agama. Maybe my laptop though

just wanted to let ya'll know I'm selling 2500 ARRR for 1.49 ETH on DP if you're interested since KMD wallets are down...

[01-Dec-18 05:36 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
wow is pirate really only going for .035 cents ish?

[01-Dec-18 06:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$0.035 not 0.035 cents, but yes

[01-Dec-18 06:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$0.033 is the cost to mine 😣

[01-Dec-18 06:16 PM] mrlynch#5735
some folks just gotta make a profit 🤦

[01-Dec-18 06:16 PM] mrlynch#5735
well.... it's a good time to buy 😁

[01-Dec-18 06:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
moving some btc to DP 😄

[01-Dec-18 06:18 PM] Flexatron#8809
Yup

[01-Dec-18 06:19 PM] mrlynch#5735
if ARRR goes up to just $1 in 3 - 6 months that's a ROI of 3233% 😳

[01-Dec-18 06:20 PM] Flexatron#8809
Will get dumped to oblivion then unless the hash goes up dramatically

[01-Dec-18 06:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`some folks just gotta make a profit `
not sure where $0.512 a block ($11.78 per $200 investment) is "profit", but OK

[01-Dec-18 06:20 PM] mrlynch#5735
at BTC prices

[01-Dec-18 06:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
i know... to actually make a difference to the portofolio you'd need at least 100k to f8ck about with

[01-Dec-18 06:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Will get dumped to oblivion then unless the hash goes up dramatically`
You know anyone willing to shell out $20-60k a day to make 1.5-2% returns? Me either....

[01-Dec-18 06:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
my point exactly... it's not worth the hassle / risk... so, why people do it beats my logic

[01-Dec-18 06:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
but hey... that's better for me... snatching coins at silly prices 😄

[01-Dec-18 06:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` so, why people do it beats my logic`
they don't, that's the problem
small to middlin sized dumpers cut the rug out from under profit miners and that's why hash is down 50-80%

[01-Dec-18 06:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
**if** there were a buyer at current price (0.05) for my last *1 day* of mining, I'd take a 7650 KMD loss selling

[01-Dec-18 06:30 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
death spiral = less buyers -> less miners -> less buyers ...

[01-Dec-18 06:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
till Dec 15 market off

[01-Dec-18 06:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, as long as dumpers be dumpin, only a moron would pay 0.1+

it's buy time. once sapling is integrated value will rise, hopefully price will follow.

[01-Dec-18 06:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
vosk vid so early and people not understanding sprout needs merged did a bunch to curb enthusiasm

[01-Dec-18 06:35 PM] SHossain#0007
not sure why people are dumping when sapling is being activated in 2 weeks time

[01-Dec-18 06:36 PM] SHossain#0007
or they just don't realise the power of sapling

[01-Dec-18 06:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because they made $4 and that sounds "good enough" to them

meh, that's just a pile of 💩

[01-Dec-18 06:49 PM] bishop#9773
I actually like DP... sure volumes aren't anywhere near larger exchanges but that's expected. Being able to regen fresh deposit addresses, supporting a bunch of Komodo ACs, KMD pairs, and Z-deposits is a win in my book.

if thers only one exchange which is less known, theres the first risk to invest in an new project

[01-Dec-18 06:55 PM] bishop#9773
Well considering all the trading was initially OTC....

[01-Dec-18 06:56 PM] gets#8925
I assume(for me personally atleast) people are waiting for development from the pirate team themselves, for instance if they get zspv before zcash or something else thats made by them

[01-Dec-18 06:57 PM] bishop#9773
Sapling and spv, put a fork in it, it's done.

[01-Dec-18 06:58 PM] gets#8925
judging by the work that went into getting zerocoin in spv wallets I assume it wont be that easy 😛

[01-Dec-18 07:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Well considering all the trading was initially OTC....`
every reason that I said it was shit that the claim is "small" "unknown" exchange
If you can trade with some rando that just showed up in some random discord channel, then you can trade on a small exchange that's been up for close to a year

So does this mean an Ethereum smart contract can duplicate Pirate?

So is this just bad news for Zcash & Monero?

[01-Dec-18 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure about the effect on them, but relying on smart contract does not create the same level of privacy as PIRATE
