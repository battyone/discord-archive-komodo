`is the only way to get through to you to also throw insults`
Seems not, because you tried that before and I forgot about you in under 5 minutes

@Deleted User you need some Ritalin or someting

[06-Oct-18 04:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The only thing you've said all night that was correct was that I misread your 1 offer
beyond that, you got some straight up tinfoil hat shit going on

[06-Oct-18 04:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My cost to mine is currently going up to 3 BTC a day

Which Komodo team member isn't honest here?

[06-Oct-18 04:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
He isn't even a team member 🤦🏼

[06-Oct-18 04:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
he deleted his own and the entire off-topic rant you went on is being pruned (everyone's posts, not just yours)

[06-Oct-18 04:08 AM] ph03nix#3115
he needs to be revoked of that privilige

no clue

[06-Oct-18 04:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
anywho, simple fact: mining costs doubled and miners seek to increase price
If you don't like that then buy from non-miners or pass altogether

[06-Oct-18 04:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is soooooooo tired of feeling the need to say this_

[06-Oct-18 04:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`mainly just mean spirited` I'll bet every crypto I have that neither in here nor in the old slack is there a place where you can find one instance of me claiming otherwise

[06-Oct-18 04:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, seems no one wants to dump their CHIPS to you, so I don't know what to tell you

[06-Oct-18 04:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not "special ranked" you fekwit; it's a simple tag that makes it easier to tag a specific group of testers and I already offered to give it up if it would make you stfu about it

[06-Oct-18 04:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can't be held liable for your delusions

I hold myself to a higher standard than I do anyone else, and if you knew fekall about me, you'd know I set a high bar

[06-Oct-18 04:28 AM] Dr Debt#0891
I am at fault... lol yes I am a master manipulator who looks to build houses for the homeless.. lol yep Im definitely a scammer. Stupid ppl make me wish the gentlemen's dual was still a thing...

[06-Oct-18 04:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`cowboycrypto is at fault`
Because he asked if we should raise prices?

New Rule: No more open forum discussions about pricing, from now on if you want to talk to others about raising prices do it in DMs (because public conversations are "manipulation")

[06-Oct-18 04:36 AM] Dr Debt#0891

`then you should step away from the computer because why are you even involved in this beyond being complicit`
Because you keep doing dumb shit like posting a pic of my comment `https://image.ibb.co/jiTpZK/cg.jpg` and then saying it doesn't involve me
If it doesn't feken involve me, then stop feken involving me

[06-Oct-18 04:46 AM] Dr Debt#0891
lmao this individual needs attention. Nothing more nothing less. I would offer a hug but they are blocked.

That's what she said

[06-Oct-18 04:47 AM] Dr Debt#0891
I told her to say it.

`you inserted yourself for no reason`
I'm one of the largest miners in the ecosystem, all conversations that involve mining involve me (or at a minimum involve my financial interests)

[06-Oct-18 04:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The actual price of mining is 3BTC per day for my hashrate
every feken day

[06-Oct-18 04:48 AM] Flexatron#8809
Just realised today is exactly a month ago I started mining..but I wont.undercut you @ComputerGenie  :trollface:

[06-Oct-18 04:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
“you inserted yourself for no reason” thats what she said.

[06-Oct-18 04:49 AM] Flexatron#8809

[06-Oct-18 04:49 AM] Dr Debt#0891
but did she wait 30 years to say it?

A month and 6 days ago I mined 5 blocks and walked away, doesn't that count?

[06-Oct-18 05:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  we were discussing yesterday the posibility of this:
1) Sending coinbase -> Z gets you 1% extra coins. This rewards people to sheild but doesnt FORCE them too!
2) Not allowing notary node address to do Z TX at all... making them totally seperate entities whos ony job it is to notarise.

[06-Oct-18 05:25 AM] Flexatron#8809
Hmm

[06-Oct-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think both changes are really good ideas, and dont seem that hard to make, but I assume if any notary address has made a Z TX already it would instantly hardfork the chain.

[06-Oct-18 05:26 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
How big of an issue is transparent coins ?

[06-Oct-18 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think it is, all my cons have beein in T since the start unless I sold them.

[06-Oct-18 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but amrketing really wanted to say 99% of all coins are sheilded 😂
