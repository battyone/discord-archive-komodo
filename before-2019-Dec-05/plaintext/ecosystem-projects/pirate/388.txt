[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> We have a meeting with the owner of coinpayments today too :pirate:

[09-Nov-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @Draeth 2 paracetamols and 1 ltr of water with lemon/lime squeezed in it

[09-Nov-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> and a hearty breakfast

[09-Nov-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @LocoMB all (biological) life ends in death.. at least for the next 50 years

[09-Nov-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @mrlynch noted

[09-Nov-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> The bigger issue is venue.....

[09-Nov-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> The timing wont work well because of the parade that is a big deal and people wont walk away from the festival for a conference, which no one knew til the team talked to locals for a few hours.

[09-Nov-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> get one of those protest loud speakers and do it on the beach, bar, roll down the street

[09-Nov-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> Yeah thats the easier part, showing the presentation though is harder.

[09-Nov-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> or push it for tomorrow?!

[09-Nov-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Nobody will be in this area tomorrow

[09-Nov-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> At this point, our focus is on the coinpayments owner

[09-Nov-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> Theres probably more people interested online to watch than the over partied people in the caymans

[09-Nov-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Which is today at 4pm

[09-Nov-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> I may just do a livestream on updates

[09-Nov-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> Luckilly i pulled any hard promotions the second  you guys said something, but we still need to publically say what is going on.

[09-Nov-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> I think you can do it next weekend..... from home

[09-Nov-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> True

[09-Nov-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> Better that than trying to force something thats going to have a hell of a lot of tech issues with tired people

[09-Nov-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Btw  @mrlynch, I paid for the listing today

[09-Nov-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> dont wanna pull a 2017 komodo video.

[09-Nov-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @Cryptofist true

[09-Nov-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> i've seen that 👌

[09-Nov-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> Draeth, about how many people have you guys spoken to? I feel like I want to couple a delay with a nice list of activity thats happened

[09-Nov-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> if people there don't/can't attend the conference maybe just continue engaging people

[09-Nov-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> I think I have all the other info

[09-Nov-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @mrlynch that's the plan

[09-Nov-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> we can organize a conference or more later at different locations in the world

[09-Nov-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> or meetups

[09-Nov-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> We've accomplished just about everything we came out to do so far

[09-Nov-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Minus the conference

[09-Nov-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> "Direct enagegment is really high and we've been consistently told that locals would not be able to make it out bla bla blah"

[09-Nov-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> keep engaging then

[09-Nov-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> 😉

[09-Nov-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> 💯

[09-Nov-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> maybe ask people you talk to to follow us on twitter and join discord to keep up with developments

[09-Nov-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> we're getting lots of traction on normie socials

[09-Nov-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> Ill check the qr code later too

[09-Nov-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> at this point establishing relationships in a friendly, familiar manner seems better than having a corporate-ish conference

[09-Nov-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> pirates are for and with the people

[09-Nov-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> Ill post an update after I finish writing it...
@Draeth can you do the live stream next weekend? i can brief you on how to do it via OBS pretty easily.
We can set up a real privacy conference that isnt invading a party at another time.

[09-Nov-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Yea I can do that

[09-Nov-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> The only other info I need is an estimate of how many peopel you talked to so far or each day...

[09-Nov-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> bueno

[09-Nov-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> (and some help with typos lol)

[09-Nov-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Bout 50-100/day

[09-Nov-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> Thats what it seemed like! awesome

[09-Nov-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> I think I engaged about 100 people myself while I was on stage last night 🤣

[09-Nov-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> I'll leave CP out of it and just say we have set up meetings with prominent crypto businesses that just happened to be in the cayamns or something liek that

[09-Nov-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> DUDE i saw the crowd on insta lol
