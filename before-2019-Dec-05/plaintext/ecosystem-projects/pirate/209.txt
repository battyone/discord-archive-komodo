I much prefer an over-valued but stable 6400 btc than some shit that makes a roller coaster look level

[23-Oct-18 02:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm only guessing.... but since wall st money got in cryptocurrency more last year, bitcoin is looking being played. all kinds of un expected things happening. wasn't expecting stable btc so soon 😄

[23-Oct-18 02:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[23-Oct-18 02:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[23-Oct-18 02:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

I'm mining pirate now with my asics. 🙂 
moved these miners to a friend's place, where he got bunch of other miners hosted.

[23-Oct-18 02:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[23-Oct-18 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[23-Oct-18 02:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
now let's figure how the tax peeps calculate how much were actually mined 😄

[23-Oct-18 02:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can add or subtract from that amount too 😄

[23-Oct-18 02:42 PM] scubapanda#2485
Lots of people might be selling when they need to pay taxes on 2017 profits..

[23-Oct-18 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[23-Oct-18 03:52 PM] RunningMantheCoin#7435

If you log in to the contest from a different email than your discord, you may have to sign in to the contest via discord.

[23-Oct-18 04:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Sometimes they are a bit picky but the entries all seem to be working.  
I am not entering but if anyone knows there is an issue across accounts, let me know.  Thank you.

[23-Oct-18 04:09 PM] CombatWombat#0279
So far all good here

[23-Oct-18 04:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have a different email on Discord and Twitter so it hangs up on me a little.

[23-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Oszy#5734
Mine is different too but i haven't had any issues with any of the entries.

[23-Oct-18 04:22 PM] RNI#2666
hello. i have a question about the z9 mini contest.

[23-Oct-18 04:25 PM] RNI#2666
what is meant by "get 25 pirates each day..." ? i post the image of the retweet in the #pirate-marketing channel and send my z adress to @FishyGuts  to get 25 pirates? but what is meant by "25 each day"? 25 for every re-tweet?

[23-Oct-18 04:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@RNI atm a z9mini can mine ~ 25 ARRR per day

[23-Oct-18 04:28 PM] Jaki#9826
