the price has no reason to go up without buyers, just from a market standpoint.

[10-Nov-18 01:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
I'm just a face in the crowd and the crowd is f8ckin yuuuuge

[10-Nov-18 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`or arrr becomes not profitable for dumping miners` <- that was weeks ago, but they like that $5 and it's "good money" to them 😣

[10-Nov-18 01:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
Lol. It's still the most profitable coin to mine on equihash ;)

[10-Nov-18 01:10 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
and the reason they are mining and dumping

[10-Nov-18 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the price has no reason to go up without buyers, just from a market standpoint.`
There **are** buyers, the daily volume is more than 40% of every coin mined that day

[10-Nov-18 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and the reason they are mining and dumping` <- because they can't math or market

I'm joking of course 😉 
But yes, there is buyers, we are just waiting to bottamed out.

[10-Nov-18 01:11 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
Yea I guess I just thought it had found a floor, but it looks to go down more with these dumpers.

[10-Nov-18 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@LoPhatMelk i'll bring in the btc situation again. When gpu miners and small asic miners started mining at a loss, they've dumped their stashes and walked away, making room for the hodlers to trade appropriately. Then all the hype with silk road & co came about and brought the wales in

[10-Nov-18 01:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
Guess what happened with those stupid, short sighted dumpers (meself included) - they kicked themselves in the nuts

I would not love to see a huge adoption on the deep web.   I would prefer a legitimate up front marketplace with legitimate items and goods for sale.

[10-Nov-18 06:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
our question is... is it ok for pirate though?

[10-Nov-18 06:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
since all 99.99% of tx's are going through z-addresses? excluding the mining pools

[10-Nov-18 06:46 PM] Flexatron#8809
New Sapling transactions are different. They clearly show the number of inputs and outputs used. This helps isolate the type of shielded transactions sent.

A little context. Previous research has identified most of the shielded pool as related to "mixing." Users send a specific amount to the shielded pool and back to the transparent pool a short time later. Research has shown heuristics can help trance transactions by following their amounts.

Researchers and attackers now will have an additional method of tracing transactions, since these "mixing" transactions will typically follow a specific behavior. It will look as follows:

User sends any number of transparent inputs to one shielded output

User may optionally make fully-shielded transactions from one shielded input to one shielded output

User sends one fully-shielded output to one or two transparent inputs.

While there can be some variation depending on user behavior, this is approximately what will happen for most cases. This is distinctly different than most transactions, eg: with a merchant. This would look like one or more shielded inputs going to two shielded outputs. Thus, a researcher or attacker could look for transactions that either:

Use more than one shielded input, or

Use more than one shielded output

to determine a set of fully-shielded transactions that are likely not involved with mixing. If a transaction is 1-in and 1-out, then there is strong evidence this transaction is associated with mixing, unless a sender is sending the full value of only one of their outputs and receiving no change (unlikely to happen unless they shielded only the exact amount needed for the purchase, which would be likely subject to amount heuristics)
