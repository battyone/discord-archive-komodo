[03-Nov-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-prt] <Domoo> Maybe it can be interesting to write an article about how its hard for exchanges to list an truly private coin , what you think ?

[03-Nov-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Domoo> (Its not if they use a "pirate token" instead of trading the actual arrr, but all the fear from exchanges and so on, are still showing that we dont deal with an truly private coin like we deal with an other "private" one)

[03-Nov-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Domoo> Just thinking

[03-Nov-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LooTz> no wieprz is working on it, its not tails. @dogracer

[03-Nov-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> It's not necessarily "hard" to list ARRR, just different.

[03-Nov-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LooTz> but it will be a private wallet installed

[03-Nov-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> Similarly some exchanges had problems listing ETH when they previously only had BTC like coins listed etc.

[03-Nov-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Domoo> Yes exact its different, showing arrr privacy is different

[03-Nov-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Domoo> Yes then imo its showing how innovative/different is pirate

[dscrd-prt] <LooTz> fun fact

[04-Nov-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LooTz> According to UPI, aspartame is made from "the excrement of genetically modified E. coli bacteria." That's right, your diet soda contains poop

[04-Nov-19 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh> "Everything that lives on earth poos in some way

And that's how the cycle happens each and every day.

Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky!

It's all here because of poo and now I'll tell you why -

Grass is eaten by the cattle

Which is eaten by women and men;

Defuses with their bodies, and becomes poo again.

And that poo goes through the sewer

which is dumped into the sea

and it's eaten by the plankton which becomes the fishes' meal.

And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside;

Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive

By a grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand

So that it can spring to life and become food for the land!

It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe."

[04-Nov-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <NutellaLicka> I don't see any obvious reasons?

[04-Nov-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <digital bullion> Why would one change the name, it has almost universal recognition.

Hollywood has spent the last 10 years marketing the name to the world.

The franchise (Pirates of the Caribbean) has grossed over $4.5 billion worldwide; it is the 14th-highest-grossing film series of¬†all¬†time, and it was the first franchise where more than one film grossed $1 billion worldwide"

[04-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <zebedee> by obvious i mean, the negative connotations that go along with pirate , illegal,unlawfull,dodgy etc.. &  ARRR being pretty memecoinish

[04-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763

It is literally impossible to change the name without starting over

[04-Nov-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> most seem to see only negative connotations and yet most seem to forget or not know pirate history

[04-Nov-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> it is said that aprox. 90% of pirates were former slaves (back in those days most slaves were poor europeans signing years of their lives in hard labour for a chance at the better, New World - sound familiar?)
pirates also made considerable efforts in freeing slaves whenever they encountered ships engaged in the trade

[04-Nov-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> pirate life was also harsh, sometimes going months on end with little to eat, drink and almost no luxuries - a small price to pay for freedom

[04-Nov-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> and all that üëÜüèΩ and it's fun
