it doesn't detract from the privacy that the core users already have

[30-Oct-18 06:21 PM] AndrewK#3947
but it creates a gateway for people to learn about and have Pirate

[30-Oct-18 06:21 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
well sorry but this is new experimental tech, not mainstream - any coins is liek that even BTC

[30-Oct-18 06:21 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it's for tech people mostly

[30-Oct-18 06:22 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and private coins even more

[30-Oct-18 06:22 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
still many people cant use computers, dont understand to have strong password

[30-Oct-18 06:23 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it can go really mainstream when > 10-20% will use strong passwords (privacy+security awarness)

i wonder who bought me ARRR

[30-Oct-18 06:38 PM] Seko#7408
Can someone tell me extensive the difference between BTCP and Pirate?  Both use zk-snarks.  I'm trying to write a comparison.  But I'm just being stopped at the technology.

[30-Oct-18 06:38 PM] Acura#2748
i think BTCP is using transparent adresses

[30-Oct-18 06:52 PM] Seko#7408
@Acura ok, that means, that when I know a BTCP address, I know how many coins the user have. This is the point to continue with the comparison. Thx...

[30-Oct-18 08:02 PM] Exile13#4458
@mrlynch backflips!

[30-Oct-18 08:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
So... sell arrr and then go to onboarding and restock?

[30-Oct-18 08:08 PM] Exile13#4458
thats an option as long as the exchange trade is higher than the onboarding trade price

[30-Oct-18 08:09 PM] Exile13#4458
assuming you can exchange ARRR

[30-Oct-18 08:12 PM] Flexatron#8809

Arrr, might they be critical system updates to keep the boat afloat... Just sayin'. A little tar here and there to keep her dry.

[30-Oct-18 09:56 PM] Steve10#5203
Arrr can't find Pirate or Chainzilla on Blockfolio...updated and still nothing
