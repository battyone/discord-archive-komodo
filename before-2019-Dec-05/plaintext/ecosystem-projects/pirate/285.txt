[09-Nov-18 10:52 AM] dokrates#8987
so what is the involvement with kmd?

[09-Nov-18 10:52 AM] dokrates#8987
it only uses technology of kmd?

[09-Nov-18 10:52 AM] dokrates#8987
wow, syncs fast, now 10%

[09-Nov-18 10:54 AM] ch6ris#5240
it is an assestchain, similar to etherum's tokens.

[09-Nov-18 10:54 AM] dokrates#8987
ah nice

[09-Nov-18 10:54 AM] ch6ris#5240
but completely independent of komodo.

[09-Nov-18 10:54 AM] dokrates#8987
sorry if i ask too much

[09-Nov-18 10:54 AM] ch6ris#5240

[09-Nov-18 10:58 AM] Oszy#5734
it's a good entry point for new people

[09-Nov-18 10:59 AM] ch6ris#5240
if you would follow the lead of anyone it should probably be him.

[09-Nov-18 10:59 AM] Oszy#5734
should lower onboarding a bit

[09-Nov-18 11:00 AM] ch6ris#5240
yeah onboarding doesn't seem to care anymore.

[09-Nov-18 11:00 AM] Oszy#5734
I thought it's using the API to set price but clearly not 😄

[09-Nov-18 11:00 AM] ch6ris#5240
1 PIRATE = 0.13 KMD

[09-Nov-18 11:00 AM] Oszy#5734
should be 0.11 now

[09-Nov-18 11:00 AM] Oszy#5734
lowest ask

[09-Nov-18 11:01 AM] ch6ris#5240
true.

[09-Nov-18 11:01 AM] ch6ris#5240
huge 10k buy @ 0.1

[09-Nov-18 11:02 AM] ch6ris#5240
1000kmd is huge in my mind anyway 😋

[09-Nov-18 11:03 AM] Oszy#5734
still good if you mined it 😃

[09-Nov-18 11:19 AM] dokrates#8987
pirate is pos or pow?

[09-Nov-18 11:19 AM] CHMEX#0686
Miningcost is higer than 0.11

[09-Nov-18 11:36 AM] ch6ris#5240
pow

[09-Nov-18 11:37 AM] ch6ris#5240
yes mining cost is higer, market doesn't care.

[09-Nov-18 11:37 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Ahoy, morning lads.

[09-Nov-18 11:43 AM] Oszy#5734
Oh dorry didn't know that 🙂

[09-Nov-18 11:52 AM] BlockTech#6895
@CHMEX  depend of what you call mining cost ^^. If you mine with an ASIC you're still making 4 to 10 times more than expense (electricity cost only) 0,1$ to 0.25$ per kwh. But if you rent a RIG, then yes it's around the same price right now with 120Msol/s. (for 0.1KMD).

[09-Nov-18 11:52 AM] BlockTech#6895
@dokrates It's a PoW coin, secured by komodo dPoW.

[09-Nov-18 11:55 AM] dokrates#8987
nice

[09-Nov-18 11:55 AM] Flexatron#8809
Nice, then Im gonna buy

[09-Nov-18 11:56 AM] BlockTech#6895
ARRR is still the most profitable equihash coin out there to mine.

[09-Nov-18 11:57 AM] BlockTech#6895
Yes i'm gonna buy to if this 0,1KMD wall breaks ^^ to lower my average buying from 0.16KMD to 0.1KMD that would be great ^^

[09-Nov-18 12:10 PM] CHMEX#0686
I consider 'miningcost' the rent of 5-10msol  for 24 hours. I understand that  running a few minis might have lower costs....

[09-Nov-18 12:18 PM] dokrates#8987
how old is pirate?

[09-Nov-18 12:20 PM] Oszy#5734
at 0.06 btc/msol/day it's still only 0.08 according my calc. maybe i am wrong..

[09-Nov-18 12:20 PM] Oszy#5734
@dokrates 2 months

[09-Nov-18 12:20 PM] dokrates#8987
wow, its a baby

[09-Nov-18 12:21 PM] dokrates#8987
mining cost is 0.11 ??

[09-Nov-18 12:23 PM] BlockTech#6895
@dokrates According to oszy renting a Z9 mini cost around 0.08KMD to mine an ARRR. And it's sold on exchange for 0,1KMD for now. But if you own a Z9 mini per exemple, it's the most profitable coin for now, cost around 0,02KMD per pirate mined. (with a pretty high electricity cost 0,2$ approximatively.)

[09-Nov-18 12:24 PM] Oszy#5734
5 Msol costs 0.3 BTC,  gets you about 19K pirate, that' s 1581 sats each = 0.08-0.09KMD

[09-Nov-18 12:24 PM] Oszy#5734
and i have added the msols to the nethash you rent

[09-Nov-18 12:24 PM] Oszy#5734
So i don't know  where 0.13 comes from cost wise

[09-Nov-18 12:25 PM] dokrates#8987
if mining cost is so cheap, why people buying for 0.1 ?

[09-Nov-18 12:25 PM] dokrates#8987
🤔

[09-Nov-18 12:26 PM] BlockTech#6895
They don't want to mine it. Or maybe no more miner to rent ^^. They take the easy way to have a bag of PIRATE now.

[09-Nov-18 12:26 PM] Oszy#5734
they are not familiar with renting hash

[09-Nov-18 12:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if mining cost is so cheap, why people buying for 0.1 ?`
Because they are smarter than those that can't math and dump for that amount

[09-Nov-18 12:27 PM] Flexatron#8809
Math is hard you know

[09-Nov-18 12:27 PM] BlockTech#6895
And not everyone own a Z9 mini, so 0,1KMD is a pretty fair price ^^ (For now)

[09-Nov-18 12:27 PM] Flexatron#8809

[09-Nov-18 12:29 PM] BlockTech#6895
We get it you want the biggest margin you can have and that's normal as a miner. But it's simple math to say with the actual hashrate and the actual reward per block, 0,1KMD is a fair price, and for an owner of z9 mini it's the best coin to mine and sell a this price

[09-Nov-18 12:30 PM] BlockTech#6895
Saying people are dumb because they don't try to sell it 10 times the price of mining is not fair in my opinion ^^

[09-Nov-18 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`0,1KMD is a fair price`
sure, if you want it to stay a little coin that no one new comes to and investors run away from because `dumpers be dumpin'`

[09-Nov-18 12:32 PM] BlockTech#6895
An investor will see oportunity in a small price and recent project, but if he discover that it's overvalued and his only easy option to get in is paying 5 times the  price of mining, he will just pass, we need dumpers to have small and big investors coming in early at low price. it's probably not time to pump the price up now, this project is too new, there will be new miners and dumpers a few more month i guess.

[09-Nov-18 12:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no one sees "opportunity" in a price that keeps dropping

[09-Nov-18 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`is paying 5 times the price of mining`
true, they go to BTC where price = 30x the cost of mining

[09-Nov-18 12:34 PM] BlockTech#6895
It's dumping because of the hype that has been built in this discord in the beggining when hashrate was mooning from 20Msol to 80-100Msol, and people started speculating and selling 0,3KMD per ARRR

[09-Nov-18 12:35 PM] BlockTech#6895
Now there is a correction, for new investors to come in before we moon. (I'm a simple man but that's how i see it right now).

[09-Nov-18 12:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`It's dumping because of the hype that has been built in this discord`
No, it's dumping because small miners working at their local gas station think $50 is "big money" and they want it now

[09-Nov-18 12:38 PM] BlockTech#6895
well, we have different point of view , you can say people not agreeing with you are dumb, i don't mind, i'm probably dumber than lots of people here =D. And i totally understand as a miner and a HODLer you wish the price to stay/get expensive, while me as a buyer, i wish it to be the lowest possible to fill my bag ;). 

But math doesn't lie, and any mining calculator taking ARRR in consideration will tell you this is the most profitable equihash coin out there.

True, but when you have bad inputs, you come out with the wrong results

[09-Nov-18 12:39 PM] dokrates#8987
what is the purpose of pirate besides mine and sell? heheh

[09-Nov-18 12:39 PM] dokrates#8987
its anonymous coin right?

[09-Nov-18 12:39 PM] BlockTech#6895
Total privacy

[09-Nov-18 12:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what is the purpose of pirate besides mine and sell? heheh`
For dumpers to dump and it to be relegated to the status of "just another random coin" because a handful of guys need $5 to pay their light bills 🤦🏽

[09-Nov-18 12:42 PM] dokrates#8987
hahaha

[09-Nov-18 12:42 PM] guoyi#2237
I was tempted by the profit of the completion. Haha Someone told me how to mine? A0_______

[09-Nov-18 12:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As long as everything is full of people saying `0,1KMD is a fair price`, dumpers will dump at that price, and it will never rise above it; because, logic

Upvote on reddit ye salty dogs. Monero folks have awaken

[09-Nov-18 12:46 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@dokrates  Mainly pirate is a juggernaut of a privacy coin., that will hopefully be more user friendly than the rest of the privacy coins. There is no data to analyze so its safe from the attempt of trying to track transactions.  It's "feature complete" pulling the best from all other privacy coins. 
Second, an online store hub will be created to feature stores accepting  ARRR making a marketplace of pure privacy. 
Third, a place to enjoy your time in crypto with a fun crew who appreciates making a killer project but still having fun while doing it.

[09-Nov-18 12:46 PM] BlockTech#6895
logic is also knowing price is fixed by demand and supply. Big miners are actually holding lots of ARRR because they want to sell at higher "fair" price (computerGenie) but if the small miner, getting a few hundreds ARRR a day and selling is enough to DUMP the price, there clearly is not enough demand, and price is OVER valued. That's where we are right now (could change in a few days/weeks) not talking about the value of the project but the  current value of the coin. So yeah with the actual demand 0,1KMD is fair clearly fair and supported by JL777 because of his buy order.

[09-Nov-18 12:46 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Correct me if im wrong here guys^

OK, here's the last thing I'm going to say, and then retreat back to the land of reality...
That is among the most delusional of statements I've ever feken read.
Current price has nothing to do with demand, any village idiot can see that `dumpers be dumpin'` and will wait a day to buy the volume they want at 50% less
