@sclear to the rescue, people wanna give me free money and it's not working again! üòõ

[31-Oct-18 10:32 PM] P3L3#1096
anyone here mining on stratum.arrr.pool-mining.xyz?

[31-Oct-18 10:32 PM] P3L3#1096
whats the port for asic?

[31-Oct-18 10:33 PM] P3L3#1096
and is there a password or should i leave it blank?

[31-Oct-18 10:33 PM] 0x03#8822
i'm not mining on it, but i operate it :trollface:

[31-Oct-18 10:34 PM] 0x03#8822
password can be left blank

[31-Oct-18 10:34 PM] 0x03#8822
and i think you may wanna try the low diff

[31-Oct-18 10:34 PM] P3L3#1096
ok and the port is ?

[31-Oct-18 10:34 PM] 0x03#8822
...on https://arrr.pool-mining.xyz/ üòâ but `8888`

[31-Oct-18 10:35 PM] yorktronic#2703
@0x03 what amount of hashrate would you say is the cutoff for low diff vs high diff?

[31-Oct-18 10:35 PM] P3L3#1096
whats the difference between 8888 and 18888

[31-Oct-18 10:36 PM] 0x03#8822
i never did any actual math on it. but as soon as it's more than a single asic at a time i'd probably go for hidiff.

[31-Oct-18 10:36 PM] 0x03#8822
i tested with min-order-size from NH on both, hidiff worked better

[31-Oct-18 10:46 PM] P3L3#1096
@Flexatron i'm first time user.. i was asking, if i have 30k sol/s, do i use low or high diff port?

[31-Oct-18 10:47 PM] Flexatron#8809
depends on your equipment right, dunno

[31-Oct-18 10:47 PM] sclear#0274
why be so rude at the bot.. check your balance, see if you have unconfirmed funds, e.g. if you have had an operation recently. That amount cannot be spent

[31-Oct-18 10:47 PM] P3L3#1096
2 z9 minis

[31-Oct-18 10:47 PM] Flexatron#8809

I should have walked up and down the steps for some good decorative touches.

[31-Oct-18 10:52 PM] P3L3#1096
usually there are 3 ports.. one is for gpu, another for asic and one for cpu @Flexatron

[31-Oct-18 10:53 PM] P3L3#1096
i',m using th ehigh diff port

[31-Oct-18 10:53 PM] P3L3#1096

[31-Oct-18 10:53 PM] P3L3#1096
we'll see how it goes

[31-Oct-18 10:53 PM] Flexatron#8809
asic: stratum+tcp://stratum.piratepool.io:2097

[31-Oct-18 10:53 PM] Flexatron#8809
the highest is good as z9 mini are asics

[31-Oct-18 10:54 PM] P3L3#1096
tnx, figured so

[31-Oct-18 11:01 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
Any chance Sapling gets implemented on Pirate?

[31-Oct-18 11:02 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I believe it's being looked into, yes.

[31-Oct-18 11:05 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
i just saw on the roadmap, thanks!

[31-Oct-18 11:06 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
faster sapling adopted, sooner exchanges will make sense üòÉ

[31-Oct-18 11:11 PM] yorktronic#2703
@FishyGuts you should go to urgent care if it was that deep

[31-Oct-18 11:11 PM] yorktronic#2703
surface cut that gets infected is one thing

[31-Oct-18 11:11 PM] yorktronic#2703
deep in leg infection = much worse of a thing

[31-Oct-18 11:12 PM] yorktronic#2703
you don't have to go to ER, urgent care can stitch you up

[31-Oct-18 11:15 PM] mrlynch#5735
@FishyGuts pour some rum over it

[31-Oct-18 11:15 PM] mrlynch#5735
Hope you're ok though

[31-Oct-18 11:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
