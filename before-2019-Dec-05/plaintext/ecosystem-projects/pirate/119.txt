@ummjackson @monero @zcashco @grinMW yeah.... understood by hearing the ending of that video. 😅
Do you have any idea on MW's production level blockchain? I mean which ppl think is tradable? As I understand Grin is still R&D.

Can someone help me out. I can't get `z_getoperationstatus` to work.

Thanks, so in the help when it says ```z_getoperationresult (["operationid", ... ])
z_getoperationstatus (["operationid", ... ])```
It doesn't mean use the ()

[05-Oct-18 11:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in help,
() = non-string stuff
"" = string

there are a few exceptions where () is also used to separate out optional params, iirc

[05-Oct-18 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
until dPoW was added, PIRATE was essentially a test chain and selling for 0.001 to 0.01

[05-Oct-18 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
during the process of adding dPoW that took hours instead of the expected days to get working, the real PIRATE was born and for the record, that is the coin that has gone hashrate bonkers. As much as Alright wants to complain about his lost coins, the reality is that he missed the launch of the real PIRATE chain with dPoW and on that day, it was still selling for mere fraction of what it is now. This shows the value of dPoW that it can make a chain only good for testing into one that can compete with XMR. Curiously, with the current hashrate, the dPoW protection is likely never going to be invoked as it will cost so much, but it wouldnt have been able to bootstrap itself to this level as it was in a state where Alright could (and did) reorg many blocks to his chain. Also, long before dPoW was added, satinder removed all the "test chain" language from BCT, combined with the airdrop that now has a value of about $100,000 I think it is fair to say that all things considered PIRATE was fairly launched

[05-Oct-18 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
I didnt have any PIRATE during its test chain days.

[05-Oct-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, it seems 100 MSol is now the average hashrate? at this rate of growth, by next week PIRATE will be #2 hashrate equihash coin!

`by next week PIRATE will be #2 hashrate equihash coin`
The miner in me hopes not (I liked having 25% of the hashrate), the enthusiast and holder in me hopes so (as reaching a price equilibrium would be nice)

for anybody that claims we give insiders some sort of advantage, historical fact shows that there is no such thing

[05-Oct-18 11:42 AM] 0x03#8822
eh, i could've been what you possibly mean with 'an insider', yet the fork lost me 20k PIRATE (which werent PIRATEs) too

[05-Oct-18 11:42 AM] 0x03#8822
so.... no, no insiderstuff here

[05-Oct-18 11:42 AM] 0x03#8822
just bad timing

[05-Oct-18 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
also, it was shossain that did the notary taddr tx on PIRATE that caused the fork, granted I should have realized it would happen, but I was just working toward getting ac_private chain notarizations working and not worrying about existing test PIRATE miners. I figured there were only a few active nodes

[05-Oct-18 11:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm personally torn over the Alright thing. As a friend, I feel for him being hurt because we all LOLed. As a miner, I've told him how silly it is that he's passed on making tens of thousands of dollars because he's in his feelz about the lulz over $1100

[05-Oct-18 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it wasnt any $1100 the first day

[05-Oct-18 11:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the cost of the rental he slept on

[05-Oct-18 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, didnt know he was renting hash for the test PIRATE chain.

[05-Oct-18 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we could compensate for that. I just assumed people were using their own hashrate

[05-Oct-18 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
he had a rental going and the fork had him mining on a void chain

[05-Oct-18 11:45 AM] SHossain#0007
there was no insider info. i sold 150k ARRR for only 750 KMD and next day i bought 46K ARRR for 1000 KMD. if i knew internally that price will go up. i would never sell that amount

[05-Oct-18 11:46 AM] SHossain#0007
also, the first PIRATE sale was at price 0.00125 i guess

[05-Oct-18 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
a lot of pirate was selling for 0.001 during the test days

[05-Oct-18 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
but I think most of the early PIRATE was resold for nice profit during the 0.1 days

[05-Oct-18 11:48 AM] 0x03#8822
also, this 'insider' discussion, wouldnt Alright, by his discord roles, also at least look like an insider?

[05-Oct-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so other than a few stubborn PIRATE hodlers, most of the PIRATE has cost basis around 0.08 to 0.1 or above

[05-Oct-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[05-Oct-18 11:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
misses the time when he could mine 100k in one day 😭

[05-Oct-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
Alright is most definitely what people would consider an "insider"

[05-Oct-18 11:48 AM] 0x03#8822
well if he does then this discussion is pointless

[05-Oct-18 11:48 AM] 0x03#8822

[05-Oct-18 11:48 AM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i miss that too. now, i can mine ~184 ARRR a day

[05-Oct-18 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
price goes up 300x, along with hashrate

[05-Oct-18 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
what used to mine 100000 now mines 300

My rentals are so big now that I'm not even sure there's any point to still pointing my minis at PIRATE :abusedsmily:

[05-Oct-18 11:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Statistically 10M vs 10.5M isn't much

[05-Oct-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
what is more profitable to mine now than PIRATE?

[05-Oct-18 11:52 AM] 0x03#8822
is there something?

[05-Oct-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
the difference between 10 and 10.5 shouldnt affect whether $1 is more than $0

[05-Oct-18 11:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what is more profitable to mine now than PIRATE?`
Depending on the day, KMD

[05-Oct-18 11:52 AM] 0x03#8822
VRSC and PIRATE seem to be profitability _BOMBS_

[05-Oct-18 11:52 AM] 0x03#8822
still cannot believe it

`the difference between 10 and 10.5 shouldnt affect whether $1 is more than $0`
Yes, the extra $50 a day is more than $0 extra per day (except for the lovely KMD rewards blocks)

[05-Oct-18 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
aha, so the KMD lotto 😃

[05-Oct-18 11:57 AM] 0x03#8822
`jl777c: PIRATE is the best new coin to arrive in quite a while` i dont think i have enough insights to confirm, but it seems a reasonable claim

[05-Oct-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
I just base it on the organic growth and tremendous demand from day 1

[05-Oct-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it was all the activity that #pirate had that inspired me to work on dPoW for ac_private chains the other weekend

[05-Oct-18 11:58 AM] 0x03#8822
by that it is rather obvious, yes.

[05-Oct-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
I have never seen a coin with so much built in demand

[05-Oct-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it is what zcash was supposed to be

[05-Oct-18 11:58 AM] 0x03#8822
it maybe just solves a longstanding problem in crypto

just imagine in the 10 months after the first halving, it will be 64 PIRATE per block
