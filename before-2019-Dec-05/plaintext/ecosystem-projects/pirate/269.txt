Question will pirate and komodo use same method as zcash at sapling to verify no extra coins have been created like old zksnark zaddress funds migrating to transparent address then to sapling zaddress

[05-Nov-18 11:20 AM] TheGemologist#6023
Hello guys

[05-Nov-18 11:20 AM] TheGemologist#6023
Could someone tell me whyevery time i restart my computer and reopen Agama wallet i have to “Activating best chain” from block 0 ?

[05-Nov-18 11:21 AM] TheGemologist#6023
This is fucking annoying

[05-Nov-18 11:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
“Activating best chain” = "checking to make sure you're not on a fork
'from block 0' usually only happens if is gets in rescan or reindex mode and you never let it complete (are you seeing a redownload of all 96k blocks *each time* in the debug.log?)

[05-Nov-18 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
@plazma yes

[05-Nov-18 11:26 AM] plazma#1625
@jl777c komodo i can understand but why pirate r their no solution to keep it at zaddress only

[05-Nov-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
not the was zcash implemented it

[05-Nov-18 11:27 AM] jansako#3330
@plazma it is a design decision for the Agama wallet, not really JL's bailiwick...

[05-Nov-18 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
we will be using a onetime taddr with a capped amount so there wont be any meaningful correlations

[05-Nov-18 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a zcash zksnark internals issue

[05-Nov-18 11:28 AM] jansako#3330
sorry, my mouth is running ahead  of my brain

[05-Nov-18 11:29 AM] plazma#1625
it ok

[05-Nov-18 11:29 AM] plazma#1625
thanks

[05-Nov-18 11:32 AM] plazma#1625
@jl777c so is their difference between zcash and komodo zaddress funds migration to taddress then to z address......if so, whats r the pros and cons of both aproach in regards to privacy.......

[05-Nov-18 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
there is only one way, the zcash say

[05-Nov-18 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
way

[05-Nov-18 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
to change it requires changing internal zksnark code

[05-Nov-18 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure it is worth doing for a onetime mass migration

[05-Nov-18 11:39 AM] plazma#1625
Thanks for ur reply

[05-Nov-18 11:54 AM] damodar#8781

[05-Nov-18 11:56 AM] crumb#2550
