No pirate for me üòü

[20-Nov-18 08:31 PM] Flexatron#8809
"Pirate is a Privacy coin using zcash parameters, zksnarks, to require private sends only on the blockchain. There are no public send transactions on the chain. This arguably makes Pirate one of the most private cryptocurrencies, even according to zcash and monero developers, anecdotally. Additionally, Pirate is secured by dPoW from Komodo making it one of the most secure cryptocurrencies as well with 51% attack resistance and double spend protection."

[20-Nov-18 10:10 PM] mrlynch#5735
you can mine it

[20-Nov-18 10:16 PM] Steve10#5203
I want to thank the entire Pirate team and @FishyGuts for offering a great contest a few weeks ago where the 1st place prize was 10k ARRR or a Z9 mini. I won that contest and chose to support the project by taking the miner. I was excited to get the miner but very grateful to find out a psu would also be supplied! Today I received the miner and I'll be setting it up tonight and start getting some ARRR as soon as I can.  Thank you again and may we all survive the rough waters of today to sail on to beautiful blue seas to find our treasure chest!

What is PIRATE
- Pirate coin is a privacy focused cryptocurrency that is fully decentralized, meaning there is no third party in charge of your funds at any time.¬†Private transactions are confirmed in a trustless manner on the blockchain.¬†This means you do not need a third party to verify...

@jl777c when ever debate pop up about pitate vs monero excluding zk snark trusted setup if salping is not used can monero foks talk negative points about notary nodes centralization stuff...plz comment on this.....

[21-Nov-18 07:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
How are Notary nodes centralized ?  They are elected by coin holders with hardware all around the world,  with many nodes operated by more than one person.

[21-Nov-18 07:03 AM] plazma#1625
Only that

[21-Nov-18 07:05 AM] plazma#1625
no tradeoff if compaired to monero

@plazma you bring up a good point, regarding fud

[21-Nov-18 07:07 AM] ph03nix#3115
