`only thing bought was the meat `
You make your own cheese and buy milk from the store 😕

[30-Sep-18 09:18 AM] 0x03#8822
no, you're right, i ignored the cheese.

[30-Sep-18 09:18 AM] 0x03#8822
i susually buy all animal products as i'm not farming any animals

[30-Sep-18 09:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lamb isn't all that big here in the middle of "cattle country"

[30-Sep-18 09:19 AM] 0x03#8822
thats sad!

[30-Sep-18 09:19 AM] 0x03#8822
at times it's more expensive than beef here

[30-Sep-18 09:19 AM] 0x03#8822
and some (including me) would argue, it's the tastier meat

[30-Sep-18 09:19 AM] 0x03#8822
but it's no beef replacer

[30-Sep-18 09:20 AM] 0x03#8822
anyways, my latest batch of merguez. some of them still asleep in the fridge.

even if we had such things, it would just be a bastardization of it (look to TacoBell as a prime example of what we do to cultural foods 🤦🏿 )

[30-Sep-18 09:21 AM] 0x03#8822
hmmm.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 anyways i'm sure in any american 'chinatown' district i'll get better 'cultural food' than we get here

[30-Sep-18 09:22 AM] 0x03#8822
so ... while you may bastardize cultural food in popular culture (yes taco bell)

[30-Sep-18 09:23 AM] 0x03#8822
you have a way of 'preserving' more of the culture of the food than we have... lets stay at the chopsuey dudes

[30-Sep-18 09:23 AM] 0x03#8822
any chopsuey you can buy here is 'lets try to make authentic chop suey with the stuff we get here'

[30-Sep-18 09:23 AM] 0x03#8822
which works for vegetables

[30-Sep-18 09:23 AM] 0x03#8822
but not for soy/fish/whatever sauce

[30-Sep-18 09:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
We're 1600 km from any edible fish that would go in a dish like that

[30-Sep-18 09:25 AM] 0x03#8822
thinking about it, it could as well be the consume culture of the USA where it's usually easier to get specialized 'abroad ingredients'

[30-Sep-18 09:28 AM] 0x03#8822
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 whats the top premium beef type you'd go for in the USA, if price doesnt hinder you? not talking about 'kobe fakes done in the usa', but what you would think the best 'local' beef is

[30-Sep-18 09:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

...also, i was talking about these poor cows you can buy at the butchers

[30-Sep-18 09:30 AM] 0x03#8822
not about your (hopefully) happy ones 😛

i'm actually thinking about buying nokias 'new' bananaphone

[30-Sep-18 09:35 AM] 0x03#8822
any thoughts?

[30-Sep-18 09:35 AM] 0x03#8822
i mean its 80us so what can go wrong

[30-Sep-18 09:35 AM] 0x03#8822
but does somebody own it?

[30-Sep-18 09:40 AM] 0x03#8822
eh, but there seem to be cases for that one on sale that allow you to run over it with a f'in tank

[30-Sep-18 09:41 AM] 0x03#8822
holy cow, the nokia bananaphone is more expensive in the us than here

[30-Sep-18 09:41 AM] 0x03#8822
is that.... is that reality?

these are like that, I've dropped it in the rain and kicked it across the parking lot into a puddle and it never stopped working

[30-Sep-18 09:41 AM] 0x03#8822
@Flexatron you're welcomed at all times

[30-Sep-18 09:41 AM] Flexatron#8809

dont feel ignored matey

[30-Sep-18 09:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_isn't ignoring you, he just ascribes little meaning to network diff_

[30-Sep-18 09:42 AM] Flexatron#8809
*aight*

[30-Sep-18 09:42 AM] 0x03#8822
woulndt be the percentage of total nethash i have much more useful as a number?

[30-Sep-18 09:43 AM] 0x03#8822
'there are 3m lotto tickets, and i have 1k of em.'

[30-Sep-18 09:43 AM] 0x03#8822
isnt that.... it?

[30-Sep-18 09:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, because "total net hash" is just a backwards estimation

[30-Sep-18 09:44 AM] 0x03#8822
sure, it is the number that was true when the last block was found

[30-Sep-18 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
if Msols is known, then can use that

[30-Sep-18 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but total Msols is not really knowable

{Reactions}
👆🏿 

[30-Sep-18 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
but based on current diff, estimated Msols, recent time between blocks you can make a probabilistic assessment of where the actual Msols are and from that what the actual diff is

[30-Sep-18 09:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`sure, it is the number that was true when the last block was found`
It's an estimate based on what hash rate is likely to have found x blocks at y diff

[30-Sep-18 09:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or the smart words that jl used 😛

[30-Sep-18 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
there is also the lag from the diff adjustment algo

[30-Sep-18 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
so a simple 4 dimensional problem that is changing in realtime as hash is being added/subtracted

[30-Sep-18 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
like right now we see a lot of blocks in recent minutes

[30-Sep-18 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
that means real hash rate is bigger than the implied one by diff

[30-Sep-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i see 6 blocks in 3 minutes...

[30-Sep-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
that means true hashrate is close to double implied by diff

[30-Sep-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
or a string of good luck

[30-Sep-18 09:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all I ever look at is the literal target of the current block, beyond that (even if we assumed the other numbers are accurate) the other numbers have a minimal impact on me

[30-Sep-18 09:48 AM] 0x03#8822
45181-184 happened all within 1 minute

[30-Sep-18 09:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, which raised the diff and the "network hashrate" and could have merely been several "lucky" finds

[30-Sep-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
diff will take a lot longer than a few blocks to adjust

[30-Sep-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
more like 100 under hashrate stable conditions

[30-Sep-18 09:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll say that it's both fairly accurate and totally not 😛

[30-Sep-18 09:51 AM] 0x03#8822
hm, so diff adjustment lags may explain the 'found block waves' i get on the pool

[30-Sep-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, a lot of hashrate is added. so blocks can be found in 30 seconds

[30-Sep-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
diff takes a while to adjust it to 60 seconds

[30-Sep-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
in the meantime more or less hashrate

[30-Sep-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
changing the blocktimes

[30-Sep-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
toss in some luck

[30-Sep-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810

[30-Sep-18 09:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`diff will take a lot longer than a few blocks to adjust`
I meant in the context of target diff

[30-Sep-18 09:52 AM] 0x03#8822
@jl777c new server is being made ready until tomorrow 😄

[30-Sep-18 09:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`[PoolWorker][Thread 0][09/30 04:44:15] Current diff: 302993.257272864
[PoolWorker][Thread 0][09/30 04:54:21] Current diff: 337787.43971687`
13 blocks in 10 minutes

[30-Sep-18 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
so a 30% faster blockrate boosted diff 10%

[30-Sep-18 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
now the difference is less so the adjustment less steep for the next 13 blocks

[30-Sep-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
when I say 100 blocks, I mean under steady hashrate, we will end up with a diff that is very close to the 60 seconds per block

[30-Sep-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
at 50 blocks it is already close

[30-Sep-18 09:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[30-Sep-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it is gradually approaching a target that is bouncing all about, if that makes sense

[30-Sep-18 09:58 AM] 0x03#8822
😄

[30-Sep-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
similar to how MA on trading charts never quite catches up to the raw price, but it lags

[30-Sep-18 10:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and it never helps that miners look at diff in the exact opposite way as protocol (min diff vs max diff)

[30-Sep-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
it is an approximation, just like the temperature

[30-Sep-18 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
if it says it is 35 degrees, that is an average for your region, not the temp outside your window

[30-Sep-18 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
especially if there is a fire burning

[30-Sep-18 10:06 AM] Flexatron#8809
Lollll

[30-Sep-18 10:06 AM] Flexatron#8809
So true though

[30-Sep-18 10:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
