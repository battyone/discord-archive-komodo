ah... just noticed that i need node.js and npm

[24-Oct-18 07:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
is that correct?

[24-Oct-18 07:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you run from source, rather than precompiled release, yes

[24-Oct-18 07:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
bash: ./Agama_LINUX_installer_0.2.42c.run: No such file or directory ... hmm :?

[24-Oct-18 07:37 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's definitely there and chmoded +x

[24-Oct-18 07:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you're on nix, do yourself a favor and use cli (and komodod) or precompiled Agama (agama from source on nix takes a bit to sort out and the readme is a bit off)

[24-Oct-18 07:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
that's what i've downloaded though 
Agama_LINUX_installer_0.2.42c.run.zip
81.9 MB

[24-Oct-18 07:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, you extracted `Agama_LINUX_installer_0.2.42c.run.zip` to `Agama_LINUX_installer_0.2.42c.run`?

[24-Oct-18 07:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
yup

[24-Oct-18 07:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'm trying the source now... maybe i get lucky :_))

[24-Oct-18 07:45 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Why not build from source?

[24-Oct-18 07:46 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Ahhh - my bad - Agama from source not cli from source - yeah stear well clear

[24-Oct-18 07:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
i take it the ./install.sh isn't that great then 😃
