if you're in the US mining is treated as income as you earn coins, so you have to keep track of that, and then you write off your expenses (power, rent, hardware)

[02-Nov-18 09:46 AM] yorktronic#2703
I had to write shit in python to do this for me

[02-Nov-18 09:47 AM] Oszy#5734
Alright got it. Not in the US and not huge amounts so I don't really track it.

[02-Nov-18 09:47 AM] yorktronic#2703

[02-Nov-18 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
find any and all issues, this one might be stable, but if not we need to find out

[02-Nov-18 03:23 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@jl777c there is improvement - input form for email code

[02-Nov-18 03:24 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
however notification is missing so that some users may be confused

[02-Nov-18 03:24 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
after sending withdrawal the page reloads but there is no info what is next step

[02-Nov-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
did you get an email?

[02-Nov-18 03:24 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I figured out to check email and scroll down to see there is the input code

[02-Nov-18 03:25 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
yes email is fine

[02-Nov-18 03:25 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
it's just that I need to figure out by myself what to do - so it's not idiot proof üòõ

[02-Nov-18 03:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Trading wasn‚Äôt open a few minutes ago.  It might be now.    Mostly testing wallets in / out I think.

[02-Nov-18 03:33 PM] TheGemologist#6023

[02-Nov-18 03:33 PM] TheGemologist#6023
After rescan wallet i got balance showing up

[02-Nov-18 03:33 PM] TheGemologist#6023
but it‚Äôs just showing up 6 transactions in transaction history

[02-Nov-18 03:34 PM] TheGemologist#6023
and balance is completely incorrect

[02-Nov-18 03:34 PM] Hermes#6934
Is the wallet fully synched?

[02-Nov-18 03:34 PM] Hermes#6934
100%

[02-Nov-18 03:35 PM] TheGemologist#6023
I ve mined like 7-8k since yesterday accordingly to piratepool

[02-Nov-18 03:35 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Yes..0

[02-Nov-18 03:35 PM] TheGemologist#6023
it‚Äôs just showing up transaction history from yesterday night

[02-Nov-18 03:35 PM] TheGemologist#6023
when i installed this wallet on new PC

[02-Nov-18 03:36 PM] Hermes#6934
You had the wallet running in a previous PC before?

[02-Nov-18 03:36 PM] TheGemologist#6023
things before are not showing up

[02-Nov-18 03:36 PM] TheGemologist#6023
yes

[02-Nov-18 03:36 PM] Hermes#6934
is it using the same z address that you used before ?

[02-Nov-18 03:36 PM] TheGemologist#6023
yes

[02-Nov-18 03:37 PM] Hermes#6934
If you are fully 100% synced you should be able to see the full balance on the addresses that you control

[02-Nov-18 03:37 PM] Hermes#6934
Did you imported the private key of the previous wallet into this new PC?

[02-Nov-18 03:37 PM] Hermes#6934
Or you imported the wallet.dat file?

[02-Nov-18 03:38 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Yes. I wrote down the WIF key, downloaded the wallet on this new computer and click import key

[02-Nov-18 03:38 PM] TheGemologist#6023
didn‚Äôt use wallet dat

[02-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Hermes#6934
and that WIF key that you imported reflects some balance?

[02-Nov-18 03:39 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@jl777c  it's been 20min and my withdrawal is accepted by no txid still

[02-Nov-18 03:40 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
also no info/fedback how long should I wait or anything

[02-Nov-18 03:40 PM] TheGemologist#6023
yes it‚Äôs showing some balance, but i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs no correct... When i left home yesterday i had like 1800 pirate on wallet and something like 6700 coins paid by piratepool in ‚Äúworker stats‚Äù... Than now i have 2450 in wallet and 13000 paid in worker stats

[02-Nov-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
even normal withdraws take 30 minutes to an hour at times.

[02-Nov-18 03:40 PM] TheGemologist#6023
the transaction history in my wallet are just showing up since 12 hours ago

[02-Nov-18 03:41 PM] Hermes#6934
