selling 10.5k PIRATE for 735 KMD

[27-Sep-18 09:44 PM] Buddz1993#5380
lol amazing in such a short time this project evolved quite a lot

[27-Sep-18 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
seems a good price

[27-Sep-18 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess it was good I had some time last weekend to get dPoW working. also thanks to shossain to find the bugs

[27-Sep-18 09:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Alright I already have emailed them and sent fredeq (what to mine dude) a DM here on discord.

[27-Sep-18 09:45 PM] Buddz1993#5380
lol  that would put pirate more than half the price of KMD lol

[27-Sep-18 09:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@jl777c when you say onboard new users.... what data points are you trying to hit?

[27-Sep-18 09:46 PM] jl777c#5810
I have no preconceived ideas, other than to do better than XMR

[27-Sep-18 09:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Wallet active? 
Here in discord? 
Follow on social media?  
What additional objectives.

[27-Sep-18 09:47 PM] jl777c#5810
number of active wallets seems to be what matters most

[27-Sep-18 09:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I guess my question is... what constitutes an onboarded member?    
Are you able to run a world map of all the active pirate chains on the globe?

[27-Sep-18 09:47 PM] jl777c#5810
we can get an estimate to the number of nodes

[27-Sep-18 09:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Where we can show a map of the world with that appealing image of dots all over the map where they originate from?

[27-Sep-18 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
getpeerinfo from a node that doesnt limit peers ->geoIP map

[27-Sep-18 09:48 PM] Hot#2427
there is no richlist üòÑ

[27-Sep-18 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
no rich list but we can get a list of ips of peers, of course many might be using Tor

[27-Sep-18 09:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What if they use for though

[27-Sep-18 09:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol

[27-Sep-18 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
we end up counting tor ipaddrs

[27-Sep-18 09:49 PM] jl777c#5810
I think ultimately the hashrate and market price are the only publicly validatable metrics

[27-Sep-18 09:49 PM] jl777c#5810
could also measure number of tx

[27-Sep-18 09:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Number of tx on a chain like this would be very interesting. I would do something like calc the CPU time it takes for each one then display a number of how many cut down trees that equals.

[27-Sep-18 09:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
:trollface:

[27-Sep-18 09:52 PM] Flexatron#8809
What's a dmn

[27-Sep-18 09:52 PM] wookie#7663
dnm = darknet market

[27-Sep-18 09:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That will be our most important feature IMO

[27-Sep-18 09:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Make or break so to speak

[27-Sep-18 10:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Just like noone could stop Pirate from getting created.... We won't be able to stop a DNM.

[27-Sep-18 10:02 PM] Flexatron#8809
Ahh

[27-Sep-18 10:02 PM] Flexatron#8809
Yup

[27-Sep-18 10:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We should actively encourage someone to make it

[27-Sep-18 10:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It will moon the price to insane levels

PIRATE recently began life as an interesting test coin. The community interest has been huge. With dPoW it is the most private coin in all of #crypto, secured by #bitcoin's hashrate. We asked @satindergrewal to share his notes https://t.co/nRPu0UYbjz #PIRATE #blockchain #p...

[27-Sep-18 10:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
How does one even get listed on dnm, is it by the admin, or user requests, or demand from sellers

[27-Sep-18 10:36 PM] Yassin#3685
YDX chain?

@Alright many of those things are dev team items.   If they want us to have one or if we want a public one, I can make a board for it.   I‚Äôm going to have a marketing board done tonight too.    Would be easy to do both but again... if the team already has one, theirs will be far more comprehensive than mine.

[27-Sep-18 10:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I‚Äôve got lots of notes and integration items too so I do think one could be made.   Let me get it done and we can fiddle wit it.

[27-Sep-18 10:46 PM] Alright#0419
Who is the dev team?

[27-Sep-18 10:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Well developers I gues.

[27-Sep-18 10:47 PM] Yassin#3685
before it is me, but now it is another person

[27-Sep-18 10:47 PM] Yassin#3685
it is first exchange OTC for IOTA

[27-Sep-18 10:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I don‚Äôt know if there is a totally set one.  I belive a handful of guys are working on it specifically but I hesitate to confirm that.   I‚Äôve not been on this ship very long.

[27-Sep-18 10:48 PM] Alright#0419
I would like to see separate clients for PIRATE so a hard fork is much harder to accomplish :trollface:

[27-Sep-18 10:48 PM] Alright#0419
kind of serious about that though

[27-Sep-18 10:50 PM] Alright#0419
not trying to knock jl, but right now we use his repo for the definitive PIRATE code, if there were competing clients we would have to reach consensus
