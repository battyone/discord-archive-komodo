nope, it's correct

[24-Sep-18 01:26 PM] wookie#7663
@SHossain sorry, but I need a bit more help. I got my wallet to stop. There's no komodo folder where the pirate application is. my pirate_7776 is in a subfolder inside agama. can I just run the rest of the lines from the same folder of where komodo_cli is?

[24-Sep-18 01:31 PM] SHossain#0007
wookie, if you are using Agama, you need to wait for the next release

[24-Sep-18 01:32 PM] SHossain#0007
unless, you can follow the guide and compile komodo from source https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html

[24-Sep-18 01:33 PM] wookie#7663
@SHossain the guide is quite specific and very clear. I should be able to follow that! Although, will it conflict with Agama?

[24-Sep-18 01:34 PM] SHossain#0007
no

[24-Sep-18 01:34 PM] SHossain#0007
shouldn't conflict

[24-Sep-18 01:35 PM] wookie#7663
so just install komodo, then install pirate from there, then update, then move my wallet over?

[24-Sep-18 01:36 PM] SHossain#0007
just install komodo and run the start command of PIRATE. that's it

[24-Sep-18 01:37 PM] wookie#7663
ok, will try it. Thanks! @SHossain

[24-Sep-18 01:38 PM] Herman#8264
