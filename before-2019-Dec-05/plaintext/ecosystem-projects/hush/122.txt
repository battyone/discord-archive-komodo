[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but yes, most messages will be small

[15-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> like emails, chats, texts

[15-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Text, PDFs, images (memes) will be small.

[15-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> imagine being able to send a meme pic via encrypted memo field!

[15-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is one of my goals

[15-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 200KB is a lot of room for meme pics

[15-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> small files take the least work, since they fit in 1 transaction

[15-Jun-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> next level of complexity is medium files, which take up multiple transactions but still inside one block (but could straddle multiple blocks)

[15-Jun-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then finally files which take up multiple blocks to store

[15-Jun-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so it's like baby steps to the market, little steps to bigger steps

[15-Jun-19 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pixelised worst case is you break up your 1 logical file into multiple files on Hush blockchain, like "will part 1", "will part 2", etc..

[15-Jun-19 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Worst case would be having a zip archive across multiple 3.5 inch 1.44MB floppy disks. üòõ

[15-Jun-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I remember those days very well

[15-Jun-19 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> My first Linux install was Slackware 3.3 which took about 12  floppy disks

[15-Jun-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hush is back on whattomine.com, you need to select Graviex from the list of exchanges

[15-Jun-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I liked it better when I was mining in secret.

[15-Jun-19 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I don't recall.  Is there any block halvings for hush

[15-Jun-19 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Every 210000 blocks

[15-Jun-19 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Found it

[15-Jun-19 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Yes,

[15-Jun-19 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Reward Halving: Every 4 years (same as Bitcoin)

[15-Jun-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> When was the last halvings?

[15-Jun-19 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush has never had a halving, yet

[15-Jun-19 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> block 340,000 on our new mainnet will be our halving

[15-Jun-19 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it would have been block 840,000 on our original chain

[15-Jun-19 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 210,000 for hush, you are right, it's 840,000 for BTC, who has a block time 4 times longer

[15-Jun-19 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's every 4 years, for both

[15-Jun-19 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> same as Zcash as well

[15-Jun-19 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash halving will happen first, then Hush not too long after that. I think our halving is in November 2020 (because our genblock was November 2016), but i would need to write some code to get better estimates.

[15-Jun-19 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> our hashrate has been changing a lot so it's hard to estimate when a block will happen over a long period of time, but late 2020 will be our 1st halving, total block reward will go from 12.5 to 6.25

[15-Jun-19 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so get in on all these good block rewards for the next 1-ish year üòÉ

[16-Jun-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @anglersec as mention, lot people will not sell below a certain amount. 
Base on the average(@current BTC prices - $9200) as mention to lot people that pm me.
Currently there lot buy orders at 900sats, I myself is eating all 900 sats orders as quick as I see it.
Order of 10000 hush will fullfil in 72 hours 1000 sats
Order of 10000 hush will fullfil in 24 hours 1100 sats
Order of 10000 hush will fullfil in 6 hours 1200 sats

[16-Jun-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Order of 10000 hush will fullfil in minutes at 1250 sats

[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I know by month end their be some good news like Nova Exchange listing or Tradesatoshi exchange back online.
I see Duke has made incredible progress on silent dragon wallet, jl777c and duke also making huge updates on kmd + hush base. 
I feel in 3 months we be in a extremely good spot. As for now we need volume on altilly. I waiting for my position to close and bitmex to give btc on Tuesday so I can put up some buy walls on altilly.

[16-Jun-19 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I don't like trading on bitmex, its feels like a gamble. I still prefer my old fashion trading. Buy when I feel price is good. Sell when I feel the price is right.

[16-Jun-19 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> you end up with fiat / alts / btc. still a win win win

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> How does bitmex work?

[16-Jun-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You put in BTC and you lose it

[16-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It allows leveraged positions, which many people do not understand

[16-Jun-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Most people end up losing money on Bitmex, but some people are good/lucky

[16-Jun-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @AkiraX You long or short bitcoin with leverage. Bet against the price. 
I first long bitcoin 7700, it went down, had to rebase/level of my entry by buying more. then 8100 I close and open a short with profits only. Loss all profits. I open a long again since 3 times my shorts all got REKT (liquidated). Hard to rebase/level off on a short. My long 8300 => 9300. I close and open a short. I did make lot profit. But 4 days no sleep. Profit was  0.19btc.

[16-Jun-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i saw some stats recently but i don't have them handy, about average bitmex user profit

[16-Jun-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM very interesting account! 0.19btc is a nice profit, but the cost of 4 days of no sleep is hard to calculate

[16-Jun-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto true, I only put 0.01btc to play around.

[16-Jun-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I can see why so many people are attracted to it

[16-Jun-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto people get too greedy, When price was $3500, I had no much money to buy up and I knew it will go up, so I put in bitmex and use leverage to buy contracts.  I cashout $4800.

[16-Jun-19 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @penguin it is, I got pure lucky and I don't believe in luck, if price went 9800 I will have lost it all. 
I advice stay away. I cash out and have to wait for 48 hours to receive btc back. To learn whats it about I will wait until next weekend until all settle down.
