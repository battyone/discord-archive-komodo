[dscrd-hush] <Seko> Is Hushlist decentralized and completely anonymous? Unbelievable how strong the ecosystem is, together we are stronger... @dukeleto

[13-Jun-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Seko> Is it possible to send me the whitepaper of Hushlist as a text file? Then I can use the translator, so that it‚Äôs easier for me to unterstand...

[13-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> sometimes giving a reason for the tip (which I like to do) makes the tip bot confused, it seems

[13-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> There are many guys, who deserve it much more than I do.

[13-Jun-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> My plan is to update HushList paper for Sapling, then translate it to some languages. Doesn't make sense to translate it before updating for Sapling, the paper is pretty old and needs some updates

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `the only alt i have left
btc and hush`
that's 2 alts, not 1

[13-Jun-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> No, that's 1 alt. We all know BTC is scam.

[13-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> BTC is the thing that Ponzi's wet-dreams were made of

[13-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I bought Onecoin instead.

[13-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> If you can't tell, I don't like BTC :troll:

[13-Jun-19 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> The only real BTC is BTCH. Even BTC is part of BTCH's name.

[13-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> btc = usdt ?

[13-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> hahah

[13-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> usdt ü§£ üòÇ

[13-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> when you can follow an audit trail of usdt, let me know

[13-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> 1 USDT= 1 BTC

[13-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> when usdt.

[13-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `USDT is backed by real funds, I know this because they told me so`

[13-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> USDT is backed by BitConnect

[13-Jun-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> this is true

[13-Jun-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> basically almost true üòõ

[13-Jun-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> so much madness

[13-Jun-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> too much propaganda

[13-Jun-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `so much madness
too much propaganda`
that describes both USDT and BTC üòõ

[13-Jun-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> don't FUD USDT. It's digital gold.

[13-Jun-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> but usdt is fudding me :\

[13-Jun-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Then sell everything and buy BTC.

[13-Jun-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> when 1 usdt = 1 btc ofc  !

[13-Jun-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `Then sell everything and buy BTC.`
I did that once, then I traded it for KMD miners and made income instead :troll:

[13-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> When BTC holders lost 500%, I made 300% üòé
