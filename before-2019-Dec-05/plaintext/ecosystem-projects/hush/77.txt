[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> The thing about open source, someone can always pickup any project where it left off.

[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> The one (dodgy) exchange that CMC gets it's stats from has their Hush wallet in maintenance. No Hush deposits or withdraws from there at the moment.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pixelised the miners mining old Hush most likely have no idea there is no more 51% attack prevention, and that the Sprout inflation bugs makes it so one day people will print infinite money there. Hush Classic would be quite the bad idea

Hi. Where can I find the information on using my t address with the portable windows wallet. Do I use the WIF to WIF in the tools?

[30-Apr-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> WIF-to-WIF in agama will translate your private key format, to make it importable by the new Hush. Or you can copy over your wallet.dat

These funds currently remain in the HUSH Founders Reward wallet and will be used to reimburse all who were stolen from at Cryptopia, which will enable HUSH trading to resume. Any remaining funds will be used for additional exchange listings.

[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> Hi, I have some hush in my wallet in transparent balance. Do I need to do anything  for the new chain? Thank you

[30-Apr-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @CrypThor Hi, your balance have been transferred to the new chain. You should no longer use the address beginning with 't1' but where new addresses start with 'R'.

[30-Apr-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> By connecting to the HUSHmate wallet or web wallet, you will get your new address and you will see your balance.

[30-Apr-19 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> see pinned messages for various good links

[01-May-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> @dukeleto curious whose suggestion it was to reimburse cryptopia for the stolen funds. Was it brought up from Hush team or exchange side?

[01-May-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> @gilardh  Thank you for that. I have downloaded the new hushmate. Do I  just add the old DAT file in the new wallet folder for my coins to show up?

[01-May-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CrypThor see pinned messages

[01-May-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Eddy O it was my decision because that is what I thought was the right thing to do. And I see it as reimbursing HUSH HODLers (95% of which had their funds on Cryptopia), not the exchange. HUSH v3 has the ability to give back all funds to all people who were stolen from, via Cryptopia, but we need Cryptopia's support in that. We cannot directly give back the funds, only Cryptopia knows exactly how much HUSH each of their customers/addresses has

[01-May-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you would like to see your HUSH on Cryptopia sooner, please open a support ticket with them

[01-May-19 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We are waiting on them at this point, and if they see that a lot of people care about HUSH, maybe that will make them move faster.

[01-May-19 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Be nice, be respectful. But also "the squeaky wheel gets the grease" is a saying for a reason

[01-May-19 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> @dukeleto  I have and it's a bit confusing as to where we add the commands. Sorry for being so illiterate in this regard.

[01-May-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CrypThor it's ok, we are improving docs, trying to make things easier. None of this is easy and nobody went to school for it ðŸ˜ƒ

[01-May-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CrypThor what OS are you using, and what familiarity with the command line do you have?

[01-May-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are still improving our GUI wallet situation

[01-May-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you are on the bleeding edge ðŸ˜ƒ

[01-May-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> Thank you. I have windows 10 and both wallets downloaded and both DAT's backed up.

[01-May-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ok, if things are backed up, that is very good

[01-May-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Here is the high level deal

[01-May-19 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You can use an old Hush wallet.dat with the new HUSH v3, but you just need to give it a special CLI flag the first time, `-zapwallettxes`, which clears out old transactions from the old network, which would not be valid on HUSH v3

[01-May-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `./hushd -zapwallettxes` from the terminal

[01-May-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> after you have backed up everything, and then copied your old wallet.dat to the new location

[01-May-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't use windows and don't have that file path memorized

[01-May-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's ~/.komodo/HUSH3/ in Linux or ~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/HUSH3/ on a mac

[01-May-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i think my brain purposefully forgets anything related to windows ðŸ˜…

[01-May-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> see, we need this better documented. I can see how this is not as easy as it could be

[01-May-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> I know where the folders are but I'm still getting lost on where to add these  -zapwallettxes,  and ./hushd -zapwallettxes

[01-May-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ok, then we are close

[01-May-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there should be a `hushd.bat` or something ?

[01-May-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CrypThor you need to open a terminal

[01-May-19 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> sorry hush.bat is not in the appdata folder. I thought that was the folder you were referring to.

[01-May-19 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> so I am lost on the file path

[01-May-19 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> as well as opening a terminal.

[01-May-19 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> Shall I just wait for the updated instructions?

[01-May-19 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> I think that will save you time and effort here

[01-May-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> I have to be away from the pc for the next half hour BRB

[01-May-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CrypThor it's best to wait for easier GUI stuff, I think. You don't want to be learning the terminal while doing this stuff

[01-May-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <rjanetzek> oh hush was stolen on cryptopia?

[01-May-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> @dukeleto good move, imo. Glad to see you being proactive on fixing the cryptopia issue.  Hopefully cryptopia appreciates it, even though you are right that it's essentially reimbursing hush holders and not necessarily the exchange

[01-May-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
