[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If I haven't heard of them, it's not a good sign

[30-Oct-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That most likely means they are not open source, not secure, or both

[30-Oct-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Never store anything more than test amounts in a web wallet, I hope you know that üôÇ

[30-Oct-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> Trust wallet is from Google app store.  I have been using that wallet since day 1.

[30-Oct-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Is it open source?

[30-Oct-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> My web wallet holds just enough to creat NFTs once

[30-Oct-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Naming a wallet "Trust" gives me immediate red flags üôÇ

[30-Oct-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> I would have to ask my husband

[30-Oct-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> The trust wallet I use

[30-Oct-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ok, it is open source, that is good

[30-Oct-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> seems to be focused on erc20 airdrops and stuff

[30-Oct-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Woody The Flipping Woodpecker if you want, ask them to add Hush üòâ

[30-Oct-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> I know my husband does his research before letting me download apps ü§£ he's always telling me don't click those links you don't know what it is lol

[30-Oct-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Yes, he is wise

[30-Oct-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> Yes he is old and wise ü§™üòÅ

[30-Oct-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Most cryptocoin wallets are made by shady orgs and often get malware, on purpose or accident. Mobile wallets are really shady

[30-Oct-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You must know what you are installing

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you want a mobile wallet that supports Hush, AtomicDEX is what we recommend: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.komodoplatform.atomicdex&hl=en

[30-Oct-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Woody The Flipping Woodpecker ask him what he thinks of AtomicDEX. Tell him there is no kyc/aml, fully open source, supports hundreds of coins

[30-Oct-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> Awesome I will take a look with my husband.

[30-Oct-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you don't even need to use atomic swaps, you can just use it as a multi-coin wallet. But it can also do swaps across coins, too

[30-Oct-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> He is in this server too. @RingMasterJr-ETHPoker.Club  is my husband!

[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Some big buys on the books at Graviex

[31-Oct-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> 25k-30k from 3700 sats to 4000 sats

[31-Oct-19 01:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> ?

[31-Oct-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 graviex allows another decimal in order pricing, so that is actually 370.0 sats to 400.0 sats, and then rounds to closes sat for total order price

[31-Oct-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I'm so accustomed to having 8 decimal points to the right

[31-Oct-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Why 9? If you need 9, you should have a Litecoin market.

[dscrd-hush] <pal> but as long as my wallet.dat is all right, somehow I will recover my coins, right?

[31-Oct-19 07:22 PM] phm87#7395
please keep ALL old copies of your wallet.dat
Do NOT share wallet.dat or private keys with anyone. Old wallet.dat can still save you if your current wallet.dat is corrupted

[31-Oct-19 07:23 PM] phm87#7395
I heard that Hush changed of chain in the past but I don't know details (I was not in Hush/KMD at that time). If you know your address (Raddress), you can check your balance on a Hush explorer

[31-Oct-19 07:23 PM] phm87#7395
<https://hush.explorer.dexstats.info> as example

[31-Oct-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> can I still use the swing wallet?

[31-Oct-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> Well, I dont know if that might be the cause, my wallet.dat was generated in 2018 with the old chain, the transaction that happened after the new chain disappeared so I lost 38k it seems

[31-Oct-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> can this be a potential bug?
