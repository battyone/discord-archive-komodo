[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> while working on raw zaddr xtns, it's nice to fix little easy things

[28-May-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have written 95% or more of z_createrawtransaction, and the RPC docs. And some basic tests, now I am "knee deep in blood"

[28-May-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> since shielded transactions don't work in regtest mode, i can't fully test this is regtest mode, which is probably going to make me fix zxtns in regtest. We need really good tests for raw zxtns

[28-May-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there are so many different cases!!!

The Tradesatoshi company
Tradesatoshi‚Äôs website does not have an About Us page, and nobody knows surely who the actual owner is and where is the company based out of.

TradeSatoshi Ltd (Company number 09878766) in the UK was dissolved on 24 July 2018

[28-May-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the company behind TradeSatoshi has already been dissolved, think about that

[28-May-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This all gives me flashbacks to MTGox. The exchange is already dead, it's just that most of the world doesn't know it yet. Just like what happened with Cryptopia recently

[28-May-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> i sold/transferred all the crypto's i had in there a while ago, weirdly they have never asked me to provide any kind of KYC

[28-May-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> MTGox asked every user for KYC about a year before it went out of business, to make it look like they were operational

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and would ask you to re-send your selfie because it was blurry or not official or some made-up reason. Not much has changed since then

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am sorry for all who have funds on TradeSatoshi, it seems it will go the way of Cryptopia. I suggest all people with Hush on TS to make a support ticket, as them to re-enabled deposits/withdrawals and GET YOUR FUNDS OFF THAT EXCHANGE
